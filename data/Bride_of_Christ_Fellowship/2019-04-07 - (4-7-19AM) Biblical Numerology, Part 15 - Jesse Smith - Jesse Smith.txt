verse 1 it's good to be in house the Lord with everyone we're thankful for another week of God's grace I like to look at biblical numerology this morning and then tonight we'll look at God's purpose tonight look at times and seasons I just kind of felt you're not gonna be wrong the Holy Spirit can take a sermon any way he wants I just kind of felt like I deal with this one this morning and then look at times and seasons tonight are you looking forward to communion praise the Lord amen the Lord's Supper praise God it's a showdown right it tells where we stand with God amen whether we take it right or take it wrong or don't take it at all one of those three shows where we stand so we want to we want to stand in truth we want to stand with pure hearts praise God Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil so God allows this temptation a 40-day temptation we'll look at the number 40 this morning and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread let's all read verse four if we can on three ready one two three but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God let's have a word of Prayer let's bow our heads and ask the Lord one more time if you ever need on your heart make it known unto God let's ask God to minister he promised to be here we feel his presence and we just must humble ourselves here this morning Heavenly Father we do humble ourselves father were nothing you're the only great one amongst us Lord God we're gathering here because you taught us Lord you commanded us to gather more as we see that day approaching you commanded us to preach your word Paul gathered with the Saints on the first day of the week he preached he had communion he taught the Saints the Word of God and so father we patterned ourselves after this book of Acts Lord and we asked Oh God it the same God who anointed Paul Lord God would anoint me and each every person today Lord - to do what you've called us to do Lord God that we might be edified that we might be strengthened Lord God that we might be fed spiritual food Lord for this time and season of our lives prepare our hearts for communion Lord may this sermon Lord as well as tonight Lord this time of worship may Lord each time be Lord another time to feast at your table to commune with you to talk it all over to hear your word Lord God and hear what you'd say to us to speak to you Lord and listen to you speak back Lord no doubt we've said prayers this week or maybe this year Lord or I don't know Lord the time that we prayed it but we know Lord this could be the time you can answer Lord back to us Lord God so let's hear your voice this morning through your word and we ask it all in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you to be in ct2 praise the Lord so like to look at just the number 40 this morning I believe that's as far as we'll get and then Lord willing tonight we'll look at times and seasons those 14 times and seasons that we all go through by God's grace so I have do have some quotes I like to share in some scriptures help us understand we kind of ended Wednesday night with 40 we just started 40 and we kind of looked at quoting the word how brother branham talked about that so I just want to start back up with that and then see where the Lord will will take us here by His grace so we read our text and there's a couple meanings here 40 could mean temptation or like a test that God allows of course we can't have one except God allows it and we can't have one that's more than we can bear it has to be a test that we can handle by God's grace and in every test God makes a way of escape there's always an exit sign right there's always a way out if we just seek God for it amen so we also know it means rest and that's what kind of look at maybe maybe we'll get close to that at the end and then 40 kameena generation by the grace of Lord as well so I like to just pick up where we left off on Wednesday night the brother Graham said this is the evening messenger I'm gonna skip down here we're familiar with some of these he said he's perfected in in threes five is number of grace seven is number worship 12 so the word number worship 12:40 is a number of persecution so we'll see a little bit of that today from the scripture out 40 can mean persecution and then we'll see how he says here and serves we would see Jesus 40 is temptation 50 is Jubilee and he says you know the mathematics of the scripture do you know better now I hope you know better by the grace of Lord mathematics now so we saw here the Bible said he fasted for 40 days 40 nights he was to be tempted by the devil so God ordained that Jesus his son would go out into wilderness and just be kind of alone and fellowship with with God the spirit we'd say the flesh fellowshipping with the spirit for 40 days in order to be prepared for the temptation right so it's 40 days of tests 40 days of being alone with God to face this mighty temptation and isn't it Church isn't it encouraging to know that the strongest devil you'll ever face can be defeated by quoting the Word of God we're not encouraging you you're never gonna face a demon stronger than Satan right because he's the chief he's the Prince of demons the Prince of Darkness you're never gonna face one greater it's comforting to know that no matter what you face no matter if you face even seven demons no matter if you face a legion of demons no matter what you face they can all be swiftly defeated if you just stand behind God's Word quote God's Word and you don't act upon anything sinful if you just walk in the spirit God will wit be with you he'll deliver you and he'll let you see what it's like to be more than a conqueror amen just standing behind the protection of God's word just using the shield of Revelation and using the word of as a weapon to attack and say it is written that the weakest Christian will be able to defeat any demon the same way Jesus did just upon the basis of God's Word what a privilege we have this morning - to see the power of the word spoken and remember Jesus was freshly filled with the Holy Ghost amen Alleluia he wasn't just sanctified he wasn't just justified he was freshly filled with the Holy Ghost and God was showing him the way to overcome temptation forty days here of waiting and forty days of separation from his disciples that wouldn't it be soon meet his disciples forty days and all of this all the trials and tests and everything would be able to be conquered God was showing this then this lesson before his ministry so that he could be successful in his ministry amen and you and I learn same thing when we get born again by the Holy Spirit God will teach us quickly right away that every battle can be won by quoting the word and that will prepare us for our ministry amen because the Bible said Satan left not forever just for a season so this was a season for Jesus to be born again right he got baptized and then a season of testing which we'll get to Lord willing later tonight there's a time to be tested there there's a time to cast away right and gather that there's a time for this so the time came he was born again we'd say at the River Jordan and then a testing season came and we wouldn't really think about it in that order but that's the order God gave to his son Jesus amen I don't know he as soon as he's born now test him see if what he received was the real thing and that's why you are you and I can rejoice when we overcome a test and we come out victorious on the other end and we didn't fall and we didn't go back to the world we can rejoice and say that yes this test proved what I received was deity Amen hallelujah this test that I just went through proved that what I received was the genuine inoculation the genuine power of Almighty God amen and that's what God allowed Christ to see that what he received was the genuine inoculation was deity Amen hallelujah and all it took was just squirting the Lord and not not giving into the flesh but walking in the spirit because Jesus was now under the law of the Spirit see you and I are going to live under one law one or the other the look at the curse of the law of the letter or the law of the holy spirit because listen if people don't receive the law of the Holy Spirit if they won't live under the law of the Holy Spirit then they'll be condemned that they're at the white throne judgment you're going to choose you we're going to choose to live under one law the other the letter or the spirit let live under the spirit so go to Romans and I'll prove with you Romans 8 go to there you're gonna live under one law of the other and this is the law Jesus was obeying the law of the Holy Spirit Romans 8 and remember what did Paul say he said on that day when God will judge men by the secrets of their hearts according to my gospel memory said that see everyone's going to be judged by law it's either the law of the letter which is ah I better do this out of fear I better do I better do this because I know it's right but they really don't want to or they're gonna be judged by the law of the Holy Spirit that they said they accepted the Holy Spirit and then if the Holy Spirit guide them amen either they fight against the Holy Spirit I'll do it myself or I guess I have to do this the the letter or the spirit but the Spirit gives life amen because there is life a little yeah thank you Lord amen Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so this is what Jesus was doing he was leaving the wit of the the the baptism when Jordan got the Holy Ghost and now he's gonna walk in the spirit I mean oh the Bible said he just the bottom just said he was led of the spear in the wilderness ha ha ha amen so as soon as he got the Holy Ghost the spirit led him to be tested and tempted and tried to see to prove to him that what he received was the right thing amen the dove he received the purity and the sweetness of the dev of God's leadership amen so look at verse 2 isn't this striking the law makes you free so when you worry when you walk under the law of the Spirit it makes you free from sin and death over Jesse you're preaching the law again yes I am the law of the holy we're not the law of the letter like brother bang you better do all these things if not you're going to hell if you don't do all these things remember they're 613 Old Testament laws if you don't keep all these 613 laws you're you're lost but the Bible said that's true if you live under the under the law right the Bible said your curse if you don't do all of them but see the Spirit teaches us that Jesus paid for our curse so that requirement that 613 commandment was nailed to the cross amen oh yeah the Bible said he nailed it to his cross and Christ took the curse of the law for us and then offers us the law of the Holy Spirit she here to take the ruling of the letter or you'll take the bullying of God's Spirit amen oh and let's accept the Holy Spirit amen because that gives us life to live this word and live by love and not live by law hallelujah or guilt can I say like that maybe that'd be better we don't live by guilt we live by love because we're falling in love with Jesus all the time that's right see look at verse 2 Romans 8:2 for the law of the spirit of life where's it at where is this law of the Holy Spirit it's in Christ see it's a law hath made me free from the law of sin and death so this law or this policeman we say Jesus the policeman set me free from the law that had me in bondage so you and I were tied up in bondage we couldn't keep the word slave to our sins just in bondage to sin but then the law or the higher our or the policeman Christ come by and loosed us from that and now under the law of Jesus amen now under the law of the Holy Spirit and he's made us free or the power say like that now under the power of the Holy Spirit not the power of sin does that help this morning see you're under the law you're going to be judged by the law the law of the Holy Spirit some people like that word but it's a Bible word so may God help us to grow up and mature by God's grace me too all of us look at verse 3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteous of the law might be prepared in us see who won't not after the flesh but after the spirit teachers there's something out you and I we can read that Old Testament and we say my so righteous is so holy and in our own flesh we can't keep it but with God's power God gives us power in the anointing to fulfill the righteous part of it amen killing animals is no longer righteous hallelujah but honoring your father and mother is still righteous are you with me hallelujah so God gives us gives us the Holy Spirit now he gives it to us that we can fulfill all the righteousness of God by grace and it's no longer us because I'm not doing it by the flesh yep the spirit amen hallelujah that's why we serve God since I came to the message not by my flesh but by the love of God by the spirit and law of the Holy Spirit amen praise God is it a fight yes in the next chapter of the previous chapter Paul says a wretched man that I am it's a fight there's a part of you that's wretched that you have to make it obey but once you finally get out of the flesh and you start walking the spirit then it's a joy to walk in the spirit there's a joy to obey the laws of God it's a joy to live righteously when you're walking in the spirit but the flesh doesn't like to do that so we got to stay in the walking in step with the Holy Spirit and not walk in the flesh that's right Church that's Romans 8:1 through 4 so see you're under the law and I hope that's plain that's what Jesus walked on that's why Jesus could do this he walked in the spirit he walked into a temptation right he walked right into kinda like Elijah walked right into that that army that wasn't arrest him they say where's Elijah he said I'll take you to him right he walked right into danger and he didn't fear like the four Hebrew children they walked right up there and they're gonna walk right into the fire they didn't fear why cuz they were walking in righteousness amen they were walking in obedience and when you and I walk into any situation or any meeting or any trial or any test as long as role banging the Holy Spirit we're walking in power we're walking in righteousness and we have nothing to fear because God is with us because we know God will always backup somebody who walks in the Holy Spirit oh that's right church amen now since we're in Romans go back to Romans 2 I think it's 16 or 17 that just came to me again yeah now let's read 15 Romans 2:15 which show the work of the law written in their hearts now Paul's talking about heathen Gentiles God has written the law in their consciences so any native group you go to any Aborigines or anyone that never heard the gospel no matter which group you go to God already wrote right and wrong in their hearts it's already there that's because no man is without excuse Paul says in the previous chapter chapter 1 everyone has to answer because God already put it in their hearts to know their conscience also bearing witness see they have a witness and their thoughts the meanwhile excusing or else excusing one another right oh this is right for you or it's not rot right it's wrong for you see the excuse are they pardon one another now look at verse 16 in the depth you and God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my good news name my gospel see God has to judge by something and he judges by the Lord so the Holy Spirit that wrote this word is the law that we must live by because everybody's going to be judged by a law book right you get in trouble with the law you're going to be judged by Ohio's Revised Code and you can look it up online if you want to know the Revised Code and all the laws are C dot zero zero five six dot whatever you know you can look it all up well god is the same thing he has a lot of judges by and it's his word but it was inspired by the Holy Spirit so we walk by the law of the Spirit all right that's a good start dear hope that's a help to you by God's grace that was just quicken to me a few weeks ago about we are all under a law whether we like it or not now think about the natural you're governed by the laws of gravity yeah you'd like to fly you know it'd be nice you know for vang to fly back home and you'd have to you know go on a plane you could just run and jump across the you know the Pacific Ocean or Atlantic Ocean go home to Laos or something like that it'd be nice but we're all governed by laws and if we're governed by laws in the natural even more so the spiritual because that dimension is more real than this one amen hallelujah amen now remember but man said Jesus was tempted above any man that can ever be tempted so you will never have a test as hard as this would earnest test right that's what program says the 40 days of temptation in that temptation it was the hardest temptation any man's been tempted I wonder about the gardener guess 72 I wonder that's interesting I never thought about that till now he says now look in Jesus said if you abide in me my words on you you're back to the word again the word of promise he walking in the law of the Spirit walking in the holy spirit fulfilling the righteous of the holy spirit doing the right things now I'm just going to skip because if I would preach on that now let's move now let's look at some 40s here Noah endured the forty days of rain right the bottom said the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights now Church I like our program said this he says he had to endure which means this was the test for Noah think about it it's a test for you and there's a storm outside and wonder if my power is gonna go out or let's say your power does go out that's a test for you isn't it last year my basements are leaking that was a test for me I didn't stay up to almost 3:00 a.m. with my shot back in there mmm fill it all up and then take it outside right away knowing that it's just all flooding back in load after load after load it's a test we must endure the test because something is going to come after the test look at by themselves why does God let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in his mouth I like that and makes it obey Him hey sorry whatever test God has allowed you to go through it was God making that test obey Him so God had to allow it and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God if you stop and think about a church any trial you've gone through will ultimately draw you closer to Christ you'll make it far more love with Jesus alright that's what everyone everywhere every fire will produce gold eventually right if you put gold and miry clay to put it all together hey whatever it whatever fired it you keep it in there long enough gold is going to come forth so any test will bring you closer to God because remembered although the Bible said about Jesus the Bible said that only suffering comes obedience amen right so we want to obey the spirit we want to walk in the spirit so God has to allow tests to teach us to walk in the law the spirit a very to not live in the flesh God has to allow trials so that we'll choose to walk through obedience the next time praise God that right I love this look at that look what he says about Noah there had been no rainbow till the flood came you like that I don't want to see God's rainbow honey one to see God's covenant but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in the storm and the little Ark pitching up and down the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of promise went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation amen see Church you will see you will see hope you will see God's promise you will see God's everlasting covenant if you can just make it through the 40 days amen is that right you can just make it through the trial the current trial that you're going through this 40-day test if you can just make it through here God will show you the great hope that's to come hallelujah Oh God give me grace to make it through the storm give me grace to hold on amen give me grace not to doubt the Ark that we're floating in can I say like that give me grace not to be discouraged by the rains falling and the darkness it seem like I'm just drifting know about it felt like he was drifted all that is he was in the hand of God the whole time hahaha he was drifting but he never left God he hand hallelujah amen and if he could just endure for 40 days and 40 nights he sees a hope eventually now it wasn't even after the 40 days right he didn't see the Covenant after the 40 days because then the waters had to recede then he had to come out then he had to sacrifice then he saw the rainbow oh my aren't you glad Church God will be with us what do we need we need strength we need hope we need courage we need endurance we need per survey to keep pressing through the trial because God promised if we can just get through the tribulation then we'll see the promise fulfilled Oh beautiful that's the way you see it - amen that's where you see it go through the tribulation and after you've gone through that sister Wendy then you see God's promise that's right but you must endure the temptation first Moses was in the Mount to receive the law forty days is that right a type of Christ and then did you know afterwards when he saw Israel make the molten calf he fell down before God forty more days and that's striking the Bible said you've been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you well whatever huh you've been a rebellious congregation since the day you came to church I don't want God to tell me that thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights as I fell down at the first because the Lord had said he would destroy you amen so he went to lay before the Lord for forty more days to intercede for those who have fallen into sin the first time he laid forty days was to receive the word the next forty days was the help the people that couldn't receive the word and God help us to see that we need to do the same thing we need to get God's Word and then we need to intercede for those who rejected God's Word but a period of tests both were a period a time period of tests we must be tested and wait for the word and there must be testing and wait or to intercede that God may have mercy on others that's beautiful so God uses 40 days to show this test or temptation now look it's a temptation right I think we preached on this last Sunday I mentioned it Sunday Sunday night after her brother David preached it's a it's a temptation to give up on our loved ones and it could have been a temptation Moses could have given up remember God Church God even offered him he said I'll kill off everybody else and then I'll start a nation out of you Moses look how God tests him look how that would have sounds so good to his flesh oh well I have been a pretty good guy maybe him maybe the Moses tribe would be a good tribe what it says look how God will test you right God told Abraham take your son and kill him what loving God human sacrifice God said it in order to test him to see if he'd obey God never wanted Isaac to be killed like that but he said something so outrageous to test them to see if they would obey his word and then God said now I know that you love me more than the gifts that I gave you oh god help us to do the same maybe we love God more than the gifts that he's given to us or the external blessings may God help us God to have a heart that loved you for who you are your word your righteousness your holiness your character may God give us Grace and love him no matter what he gives or takes away in this carnal realm but to love the law of the Spirit to love his holy presence amen so he stood in the gap he said no said remember he even said blot my name off instead of theirs Lord God and he did it he didn't do for one day church like we do he did it for 40 days that's why I said last week god help us to confess salvation for our family members keep confessing keep believing don't doubt it don't don't give up right god help us God's testing us to see if will believe in pray hallelujah like Abraham prayed for a lot right God's looking to see if we will obey the Word of God if will intercede or not so Moses fell down 40 more days to intercede for God's people another test and God wants to test us are willing to pray or willing to wait to see if everyone the church will be saved if all of our family are willing to wait long enough are willing to intercede and let God move remember Church even God told Ezekiel he said go make a dumb cake and eat it and that was unclean and God let him do that because it wasn't as a dietary thing it was as a sign for the for the rest of Israel wait with me God will sometimes ask outrageous things but we must know why he's doing it now that doesn't give us a license say well I can break the word that doesn't give us a license for that but it goes to show that God will test us sometimes in great powerful may be hard to understand ways but he's looking to see if we'll go through the temptation and honor him and not say anything bad against him he's purifying us that we might come out better on the other end look oh man about Moses and oh how his work how he was a lawgiver went up in the mountains and stayed 40 days come back out with the law and he said his be setting sin was temper you you know anybody like that you say one thing ah they blow up in your face that was Moses pastor Moses Khan shoot what do you mean ask me a question so sometimes we can be thankful that some people have different miss etting sins right praise the Lord and guess what so is the poorest temptation herba setting sin was tempered to write his mother answered they had many arguments in the wilderness imagine me married to someone who has the same besetting sin as you he broke the commandment he went back up showing that the priests and must die must pass away just as Jesus went the wilderness for forty days when he came out Jesus Satan met him just in his weak spot yo Jesus had a weak spot where was his weak spot the same thing yours is your flesh his weak spot was hunger he said if that would be the son of God command these stones to be turned to bread and he said it is written oh god help us amen church may God show us our weak spots this morning that we might take the Word of God and fight Satan off our weak spots then it becomes a strong spot Amen that's the point of this that's why numerology give me a good sermon to write it doesn't matter it's all God's inspired Lord and so this is what God wants us to do we know Satan is going to come to our weak spot so we've got to build up word we got to have word prepared when he comes that weak spot you might remember this but when I first came in the message I could not stop chewing tobacco does anybody remember my story on that so I didn't even know it but I just I found a picture of a guy who lost his whole cheek have his cheek - chewing tobacco and I wrote this scripture on it and I quoted it all the time first Corinthians 6:12 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient or beneficial all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any so I wrote 1st Corinthians 6:12 and roll I will not be brought under the power of any and I just read it a few times wasn't like I was like standing up and pretend like I was fighting the devil or not I just quoted it a few times I just pray it I just went to church and pretty soon I threw out my last 10 and for two weeks after I threw it out I never thought about chewing tobacco for two weeks until two Sundays later and I knew at that moment that I was so glad Jesus Christ had set me free I made a vow I'll never go back so if my weak spot was lost of the flesh that I needed the Lord to fight against that so it's not a weak spot anymore it's a strong spot amen so in other words my life it was like this it is written I will not be brought under the power of demons that try to a dick to substances glory now what are you gonna fight with that's what I fought with now what are you gonna fight with what what what do you got for Satan now you know you how many know you got a weak spot well your hand better be up or at least in your heart it better be up or you're lied and the Friends of God and you don't want to lie in God's presence right everybody's got weak spots so the thing to do is find the word and know this you know sometimes sooner or later whatever season it's gonna be you know Satan's gonna come along and try to fight you so get your sword ready hey get the load ready hang it up read it quote it play it whatever you've got to do get the word ready for that word defeat Satan anytime anywhere that's right his weak spot was hunger so Satan said if you're the Son of God make some bread here jesus said it is written God has not lead me to do that I will not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God he knew he hadn't met Moses then I like that Satan's like whoa well you're not Moses I you know a couple thousand fifty nine years ago I met Moses and I tempted him out there forty days and he fell right away what a difference this man is the most I wonder if I who is this man because last time he just tricked Moses is one thing look at him look how evil look how wicked they are they don't even love you they don't even love God and Moses got so angry he saw the smoke coming out of his ears smoke coming out nostrils oh is that right but then seems like look how smooth that yeah I'm the Prince and power of the air I'm such a fine guy I got him in his weak spot I know his weak spots but then Jesus come along he was looking more humble than Moses Moses was a strong great military man he thought st. without well I'll surely get Jesus look he's just a humble little nothing and Jesus stood there he might have been 5 foot 2 he might have been 5 foot 3 but he pulled out this huge seven foot long sword and what /you let's say it is written man does every word that proceedeth amount of God amen Moses didn't have that right Moses led his weak spot kind of show but Jesus took his weak spot and he had to learn ready and when that weak spot was tested he fought against the deceiver and he overcame him and now it was a strength spot ha ha ha amen he said I've met somebody more than Moses ah this guy actually knows how to fight let me try them one more time so he pulled up his sleeves I'm gonna get this guy now I usually don't get punched like that you know he got punched oh yeah I'll take two more shots but we know it happened after the third he gave up and said I give it as they're different he's the Holy One in Israel I don't know how I'm gonna kill him but I'm gonna kill him but the Bible said they know what death would have done to Jesus they never would have crucified him oh yeah because they set him free that's it him free to go and pay the price in hell and take the keys of death and hell and destroy all house dominions amen hallelujah they would not have killed him because do death he conquered death and he condemned death and then he defeated death and rose on the third day hallelujah see he was shown he took this he took the strength of the world in order to protect his weak spots and then even after that he was so tired the angels of God came to help him out oh that's how faithful God is right if you fight to your last breath get out here Satan and you fight to your last chance get out of here and you give all your efforts I'd love nothing else that's the time Satan will leave and God will send His angels to bring your angel food oh yeah that's if you could just hang on just hang on God is gonna give you relief bad will give you a new season in life how many been a witness to that you can just endure the season a little longer you just make it through those 40 days God will strengthen you at the end and there's anything that the church ought to know today is God's Word does anything you and I ought to know today it's quoting God's Word how to send reply to your heart search I'll close in like 30 minutes okay so just give me your everything but if you don't know what scripture you need to apply it to your heart ask me or ask ask the Lord under saying like I can be a help to you and you can be a help to me right we can help one another but that's the only way you and I are going to defeat Satan at our weak spots is if we know how to set the word together and apply it to our hearts besetting sins the Bible said we all besetting sins right knee bruise chapter 12 lay aside the sin which none is Li beset you this we got to do that you know on your phone you have like you have widgets on your phone right like that are shortcuts on the left side of my phone I'll go to the widgets and I'll see the weather well I put news on there for a while and pretty soon it was very helpful with that for a while they started putting like news about celebrities on there and then there's articles like with half-naked women on there and I'm like this is of the devil I'm trying to seek God I'm trying to pray to God and even though these pictures are like this big I can still see immoral clothes so what do I got to do I gotta take that word and apply it to my heart I will set no wickedness before my eyes praise the Lord it started out as a good thing oh I just want to see the news how is Trump doing with the Democrats saying you know just like what's the new phone looking like away but then pretty soon Satan tried sneaking it in there and I caught that I said I have to look at this kind of I all set no wicked thing before my eyes that doesn't please the Lord God help me to be pure I took the Lord and applied to my heart if I want news I'll just go into the Google app itself because I realized Satan is trying to attack me the the weak spot of my eyes right because most men have a weak spot of their eyes most men I saw Satan's trying to attack my weak spot so I quote the Word of God I will not send a wicked thing before my eyes that's just that's it for from this week praise God good lie challenge Israel for forty days oh he stopped out there which one of you you defy the God of Israel you're like your God is even God said one man to fight me and whoever wins will serve the other one the army will serve the other army of the victorious one and he mocked and made a mockery of God of the message I'll say like that he mocked the message for forty days and pretty soon God got fed up and said that's fine I'm gonna send David in there you've mocked me long enough you've gone through this test long enough I'm gonna send a deliverer I'm gonna send a giant killer in there haha God a giant killer a little tiny teenager I've got a giant killer let's see you saw he's a foot taller and everybody else no I can't use him he compromises on the word all the time put him under political pressure he'll compromise and he'll blame the church for it that's what he did he won't wait he does that patience he's not a judge there I want that guy who's out the weirdness that loves his sheep he's willing to invest with his little sheep out there protect his sheep he's seeing songs all the time he dances in the spirit he's got a hurt that's after the heart of God after 40 days God said I got I got right just the right giant-slayer oh yeah well Adam said every one of them other big degrees they was shivering with their degrees they were scared that fellow Goliath because he's the big man so he boasted like that for 30 days you ever notice forties a number of temptation certainly Moses in the mountain for 40 days come back was tempted Jesus one of the wilderness forty days was tempted 40 days of temptation he said rain 40 days of service for it is God's number of temptation think about that just make a just make a little kind of calendar in your mind most of your battles lasts about what a month or so of something lasts longer right Abraham had to be tested for 25 years we don't like that one but rather take 40 days but see think about that sometimes you have battles there like this whole month versus this whole month has been and what is it going to compete Church it could be God is testing us God is letting us go through and endure temptation that we might learn how to apply the Word of God to our lives now look at this Israel's unbelief after 40 days of searching the land - 40 days they sought the land and because they rejected it each day was a year a punishment God said I'll give you 40 days try this out you'll see four four after four days look at this they're bringing back all these fruits you're more than conquerors listen God just brought you through the Red Sea you just saw millions of Egypt Egyptians die come on God can take us in here and after all those miracles they still would say no there's no way I can be born again right because that's what it represented what the promised land represent being born in well God got saved me from cigarettes and smoking and drinking lesson but I don't know if God can fill me with all the ghosts see we must not doubt God we must remember just like David and remember all the previous victories and that will build up in order to overcome the present move trial that looks so great it's great in all eyes but it's tiny in God's eyes hallelujah see they're saying we're like grasshoppers we're like grasshoppers but from heaven God was seeing them they were like a great invincible army because the angel of the house was with them amen whichever side the angel is on that's the winning side we are stopped looking at ourselves in ourselves of course we always look a flimsy of course we always look weak but with Christ in us were more than conquerors in Christ Jesus the angel the Lord is with us amen the messenger kevin is with us praise God why cuz we're stepping on the heavens word heavens Laura brother Ram called it punishment forty more years of punishment because of unbelief now let's go to this though it's a terrible thing to think of unbelief look how God so punishes unbelief your eternal destination rests upon your faith and your actions speak Allah so loud that your words can't be heard your attitude towards the things of God may God help our attitudes this morning God you can do great things you can save my you can save my mother you can save my father right you can fill me with the Holy Ghost you can heal my sickness it's our attitude God so God so hated that attitude of unbelief because they forgot remember the Bible said they tended in 10 times 10 times God allowed them in the wilderness to tempt him and after he'd done all those great miracles they turned him down and God said I just can't stand unbelief and he says your actions speak so loud that your words can't be heard that's why church if you don't if you don't come up to the altar you ought to get on your face or do something and you ought to speak the Word of God you you you've got to bring your body into subjection to God's Word you've got to have an action sometimes you might have to put on this altar day God take it out of me I don't want to do that again but you need to action actions are louder than words you need to beYOU and I need to pray and confess the word until we know we're gonna be overcomers anybody can say the right thing well god bless you brother we love the message god bless you sister we love that anybody can say that and that's good but we need to be doers of the word and not hearers only terrible to disbelieve God's Word oh god help us to believe amen that's when I will punish people is because they saw the miracles of God and yet they still test him and doubt him and tempt him and then see all these great things and turn down where he's taking them in life I don't want to turn down where he's going where he's taking me I want to go where he's taking me right I want to reach God's destination for me I don't want to come short of it I want to achieve it remember the Bible said look at this he's our God we are the children of his pasture don't you love that I love that song and the Sheep of his hand today if you hear his voice harden not your heart see have the right attitude as in the provocation as the day's in temptation wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years long was I agree with the generations and is the people that do err in their heart and they have not known my ways under whom I swear my wrath but they shall not enter into my rest see they saw God proved to them by separating the Jordan right I'm sorry Red Sea God proved to them like they actually walked out of Egypt and people like here take my rings here take my jewels here take just just take it just take like yeah God's paying us back for all these years of slavery right they they actual actually went through that and then doubted God could deliver them from these heathens out here in Canaan God just delivered them from the greatest military force in the whole world history up to that point and now they're doubting that God could we're scared of a few giants oh god help us guys deliver us from Satan right and all the wrath of our sins if God's alluded us from our sins how much more can he defeat all these trials that stand before us amen he's already done the great deliverance he already took me off the streets he only took me other boys yeah it took me other movie theaters how much more will they take me to my destination amen Laurie in other words how much more will he take us to the rapture to the third Pole how much more will he do that if he already brought me this far it's our attitude god I remember saying this is my life I don't know if I could ever quit chewing tobacco God proved to me he can do it right God I don't know if you can ever save cam but God did it with me and so it's our attitude we've seen the work of God we've seen God prove his word to us now it's our attitude we can take this rapture not shy away let go make this excuse like well before I can't heal a headache well how am I gonna do the body change don't condemn yourself start first change your attitude towards that headache say God give me faith for the headache Amen or whatever your struggle with whatever your back is well I don't know if I could ever do my marriage Rider I don't know if I ever did finances right however ever get these lessons of the flesh right change your attitude first toward that let God prove his word to you and then got you open the gates of heaven for the latter and for the rapture Amen thank you the hard C attitude you talk to people all the time go to church and they got the worst attitude well I'm just always gonna be a smoker I'm just always going to be a custom I'm just always gonna be addicted this I'm just always gonna be sick that's the kind God gets mad about right I swear my wrath they would because they don't believe they don't really believe God can do it may God raise our faith to believe now I looked at this Ezequiel aid 40 days to represent 40 years each day was going to be a year now this is the second time around church they already had those the the Israel that came out of Egypt they already had 40 years wandering around this is after they had Kings than all these things and now they're get ready to get kicked out land again and God gives him again forty days for 40 years God shows him the same thing 40 40 tests temptation you know I like this though this is a good one for us Church the angel Lord came to him a second time touched him and said horizon II because this journey is too great for thee how many would say amen to that this journey is too hard for my flesh Satan is awfully powerful against my flesh and I don't have enough strength I need divine strength for this test it's too great for my flesh and he rose and it eat and drink it wasn't the strength of that meat forty days and forty minutes on the order of the Mount of God hahaha that's why the Bible says that the weak say I am strong glory see we just got a feast on God's Word if we feast on God's Word won't be strong enough for the journey hallelujah that's why you don't miss church that's why you listen to Wednesday night that's why you you listen to Sunday night that's why you come all the time because there's one thing that will give us strength for the journey and that's God's holy word we find the Prophet next then coming to the cave I just wonder what the kind of ottoman was in those cakes needed eat it kept in go good condition for 40 days must've been some really supernatural protein in there don't you imagine the scientists of the day would like to take one of those ho cakes and examine it down in the laboratory and find out many chemicals in it how much vitamins they could keep a man in good strength for 40 days walking God still got a laboratory full of them and they're for journeying purposes God has a laboratory full of spiritual vitamins that his people can still feed on today it's called the Holy Bible Church and it's for journeying purposes hallelujah and while he was laying there into the tree weird upset God quite his nerves fed him woke him back up again fed him again put him back to sleep you know I've often wondered what was in those cakes what kind of vitamin D to get in those cakes however what well that was in their last in 40 days 40 nights he went the strength of those cakes God knows tonight I need some of them and I'm sure that this church needs some of them come aside oh wow from the world and let's rest a while let's talk a while no what did I said you had to leave here to run away form Ahab and Jezebel he had to slip us up the things of the world lay out here in their juniper tree so God could every separate yourself God could deliver the case that would empower him for 40 days of journey and brother Branham said I need some of those tonight glory let's stand to our feet here I'm gonna stop right there how many would say I son this morning I'm so glad Church who came aside to the house of God today you could have been out there you might have had some really important errands to do I've had that numerous times like on a Wednesday night usually I could've did that alright maybe I mean all these years of passing right thirteen years we could add all these things that could attempt you to go but I'm so glad I stepped aside from the things of the world and came out here to have some fellowship with God some vitamins Church are you weary this morning is anyone laying under the juniper tree weary this morning maybe you're upset maybe your nerves are shocked whatever vitamin was in that food we know that spiritual vitamin exists today in God's Word and then I just had this thought maokai you can come here to the piano I just had this thought again and Gees answered and Senator Martha Martha our careful and troubled about many things Martha you have so much on your to-do list you have so many emails you got to get to there are so many voicemails you have to return Martha there's all these spring cleaning things you never got done there are so many things that are troubling you do we realize that church sometimes we let we let this little thing right here like this thing trouble us now before before smartphones it was this little thing [Music] that a little piece of paper troubles and God's got this heaven this laboratory in heaven full of spiritual vitamins for us glory if we can just set aside from those things and come out into a quiet place and talk it over with the Lord [Music] they're so troubled he said you're soaked you care so much about these things many things plus the bills it's the children it's my spouse it's the job trouble with all these many things but Jesus said you need ones thing that's spiritual vitamins amen and Mary chose to take her vitamins she chose the good vitamins should not be taken away from these vitamins are so powerful they come into you and they become part of you your body doesn't get rid of them by doesn't flush them out Bob body doesn't sweat them out they become part of you they become part of your character it's true ever since I started quoting that I will not be brought in the power of any I've never gone back to smoking cigarettes chew I've never got drunk on alcohol because it's now a part of me I've character as a Christian the vitamin has become one with me I become one with the word jesus said there's one thing needful that's to sit and have this conversation come aside and rest a while let's talk a while programs in the midst of it although every age and every profit that's better would be there's going to be a certain amount of people that's predestinated to hear that message and they'll follow it those ignore the crowds they ignore the criticism of the unbeliever they have no argument with them they've got one thing to do and that's believe and to get every bit of it that they can and soak it in like Mary who said at the feet of Jesus Martha was fixing his dinner jesus said there but Martha you're so concerned about the other things Ameria sought the better things see the things of eternal life I mean like those things today I'll get to Jonah maybe tonight I didn't I thought I'd get a lot farther on the message boy I didn't get halfway done that like has never happened in life I mean thankful for the Lord today let's just if we can just bow our heads for a moment here I remember I said earlier I feel like the Holy Spirit brought that back to my remembrance there's an action if you need a scripture on something to help you take action God is grieved when we don't take action on something we've got to act upon it [Music] someone on each one of us to think about this for just a moment what is your weak spot just take a moment think about your weak spot I'll think about mine remember there's three channels lust of the eyes lust lust the flesh pride of life before any contention there's pride proverbs says [Music] many of our battles will be against pride I hope so which means I hope you're not giving in the lust of the flesh and lust of the eyes I hope you're not an addict looking at wrong things or lusting after fleshly pleasures that's the sanctification issue the church many of us battle pride don't we what's your weak spot Satan found Moses's but he never found one in Christ because he was fortified with the word let's pray for a moment I'm gonna ask God to show you your weak spots show me mine and to give us a scripture that we
