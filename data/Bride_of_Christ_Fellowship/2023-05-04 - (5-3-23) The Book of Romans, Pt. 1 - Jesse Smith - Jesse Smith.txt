let's go to Romans chapter 1 verse one I'd like to can actually start this series here on the book of Romans by the grace of God tonight I want to thank everybody for the support on Sunday it seemed like the live stream worked out okay by God's grace so thank you for everybody who played a part there I sent a text to brother amen thanking him for his music Ministry I sure appreciate all the efforts that everybody did we had a wonderful time there as you saw chapter 1 verse 1. we just had a good good time the Lord I asked you know before there's a number of people that come up for prayer at the end and I said we're any testimonies from the first time we had a real long prayer line the first time and one of the brothers said he said I think the greatest blessing he said was that we were all got delivered from the spirit of fear because they were a fearful of their previous Pastor was a legalistic guy now that guy goes to a we say a worldly Church and they were so happy and they were just saying we Yeah we actually were delivered from the spirit of fear we no longer live under fear of man Hallelujah in the Bible said cursed is the man that trusts thin man right so it was a great Victory and then a young sister come up and she said that's right brother Jesse I had a back I really some back pain and then God healed me slowly but surely a few days afterwards each day got a little better she said now I'm completely well by God's grace so thank the Lord for touching him back Hallelujah and then she's the one to come up for prayer and she said I want to be the first one to dance for Jesus she said in other words she said I want to be the Miriam in the church and I said well obviously bless you somebody's got to be the Mary and praise God but it's the first time you know after we close the service I don't know if you saw I don't know if you saw that part or not but I said let's all stomp our feet and clap it's the first time they've ever stomped and clapped in his service their whole lives some of them are 50 and 60 years old they've never stoned like you get to do here tonight they never got to do that until Sunday by God's Christian we did it in a gentleman's garage we had service in the garage as you saw press all the gas tanks on the floor really wonderful by God's grace God's great great to see the Holy Spirit working in people's lives amen like it does in your your life all of our lives it's nice to see it in a fresh group of Believers so Romans chapter 1 verse 1. I appreciate everybody's flexibility there for Sunday we'll just read verse one together let's read let's read this we get on three one two three Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle

we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God all right so we'll have some slides here I'd like to show and we'll to be right with the word of God here tonight Romans chapter one we'll go there Church we're starting a letter tonight that some people believe is the greatest letter or epistle ever written in the Bible some people believe that The Book of Romans it is one of Paul's longest letters if not the longest he ever wrote and you'll see why this is such an important letter here as we get going on and uh you know I love I love teaching and preaching through books of the Bible we've now made it I think through five if I'm not mistaken you'll see I'll show some quotes from Brother Brown brother Branham did that too he would just preach straight through a book of the Bible praise God and so we're very grateful for that and and hopefully by God's grace we'll have a fresh understanding here of the importance of this book here the book to the Romans and remember our whole purpose behind this is you know it struck me back in 2016. brother Branham was in his vision he was in his body was there on the bed but he went up beyond the curtain of time he went up we'd say to the probably the sixth dimension and he was told by a voice he said Jesus will come someday and he'll come to you first and then you'll be judged and then he uh the voice said these people are your converts that you've LED and I said you mean by being a leader that he'll judge me yes I said does every leader have to be judged like that yes I said what about Paul he'll have to be judged with his well I said if this group goes in so will mine because I preach exactly the same word amen that is I said where he baptized in Jesus name I did too I preached and the millions screamed out all at once were resting on that let's shout that out time ready we're resting on that let's try it again ready we're resting on that praise God what are we resting on the fact that brother random preached Paul's gospel that's what we're resting on and I thought my if I don't only know this before I come here I would make people come here they can't afford to miss this why looky here that's from the fifth seal praise God so I thought you know I'd refresh that each time I start a new book I try to just read that quote as a help there remember and now we're in this book and God will judge every person's heart by Paul's gospel that Jesus Christ gave him it's the Judgment standard so brother random even says in the church age book he said you know what he said you want to know where you stand with God he said look at the word of God and see if you're obeying it that's how you know where you stand the thing about a church you know many of us God's helped us to overcome you know eyes and and anger and greed and frustration and addictions and uh lust of the eyes lust of the fresh pride of life don't look at just don't don't look at the things you're struggling look at all the victories God's given you as well praise God because we could all look at well this area of my life right the enemy gets one one punch on us all the time right but we can't just look at that area we've got to look at all the areas God helped us to overcome how many grateful for all the victories he's brought to you praise God oh there's so many churches there's so many victories God gives us amen so we want to rejoice in that here tonight so for resting on Paul's gospel we need to know what he said for he he wrote and preached the whole Council of God and I remember this quote brother man tells us he said there's there there must be someone rise up that's got to come for it's thus said the Lord Malachi the fourth chapter that's exactly what he said would be the sign just before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord I'll send you Elijah and what'd he do he turned the hearts of the children back to the doctrine of the fathers back to the Bible out of these denominational difference and come back to the Bible back to God that's what he do notice what a great time we're living in now Church let's look at the Simplicity of that every time you come back to your Bible to really understand the Bible you're returning to God right whether it's in the morning or the afternoon or mid morning whenever you really come back to the Bible for a fresh Revelation or a a time to spend with God you're coming back to God you're saying God I need more of you God I want more of you now we know Brothers you know all the doctrines he's pointing us back here but I just want to bring it on a personal level every time you open your Bible every time you get on your knees and pray every time you're seeking God you're coming back to your heavenly father praise God and he's going to give you he's going to give you what you have need of for that hour praise God so uh here's the quotes I want to share brother Ram taught series on numerous books of the Bible I'm not I'm not certain how familiar you are with these you know some of them I had to refresh myself on brother Ram said he taught numerous books of the Bible but here's some quotes where he talked about the Book of Job the book of Hebrews and the Book of Revelation and then of course there's others this is in 1955 this was the year Joseph his son was born Joseph one year I was staying out I preached The Book of Job taking me about a year and a half to get through it year and a half that's a long time on one book right after a few weeks you think brother Jesse are we still in Colossians what do you mean we're going to open up to Philippians again imagine doing a year and a half on Joe when I got him over on the ashy I kept him there for about six or eight weeks preaching on the ash heat now brother man I'm always exaggerated right or often exaggerated so we don't know how long it was but he said one of the members of my congregation she didn't want to hurt my feelings but she wrote me a letter now for today a person would send me a text right and say brother Brandon when are you ever going to get job off to ashy in other words brother Jess when are you ever going to preach on something else right now hopefully I have a variety of sermons that you enjoy especially says I'm the pastor if not that's why I said that's why I asked for uh you know topics for the Sunday School right I remember last year a couple Sundays ago and anytime you want me to preach on something you just let me know I try to follow the Holy Spirit the best I can uh by the grace of the Lord and I you know like I said we've had different people you know Sister Naomi a few months ago said some of the sermons that she that the God had me preach in this last year were some of the most important sermons she's ever heard in her life so it's awesome to get testimonies like that wow just this last year were the most important sermons in someone's life that I preach I said well thank God for that thank God for that that Lord just helped me to be a servant help me just preach what you want me to preach praise God so I hope I don't get any texts anytime soon are you still going to preach on Romans because I'm just starting here by God's grace but also brother I preached on uh 10 sermons on Hebrews chapters one through seven now he never went past chapter seven for whatever reason he stopped in September of 57. but if you go count them there's 10 sermons he preached from chapter one all the way to chapter seven so he didn't cover 8 9 10 11 12 13. so you got about I didn't get halfway done with the book and then he moved on made the Holy Spirit moved him on uh but just interesting to know that and then in 1954 uh he said this is a brand new thing for me to start teaching the word that's because he was on all he was doing uh Evangelistic work from 1946 remember uh and here it comes back 54. it's a of course this was New York though he said now years ago as the pastor up at the Tabernacle as a Baptist Minister we used to have great classes and we would run them maybe a series of subjects for a complete year start in the book of Genesis and just tie the Bible together start in the book of Exodus and run it the Book of Daniel whatever and maybe the Book of Revelations and just take the entire book wear it from place to place all of God's word is written by inspiration that's what I've Loved about preaching I started there in Galatians and Ephesians Philippians and just finished Colossians that's what I love all those sermons apply to all of our lives like remember a couple weeks ago I preached on you know how we have to do our best at work and then people come up for prayer and said that's just what I needed for that time I needed encouragement that I got to be the best worker I can be now who knew that only God knew that you and I don't know these things it just shows every word is always applicable to our lives and God will give us the meet and due season praise God so brothers would preach on Genesis and The Exodus and then Daniel in Revelation because it's all inspired amen I love this one he says and now as you read this marvelous Book of Revelation in my home church I take it once almost a year and a half to go through it slowly each night teaching on just the Book of Revelation and comparing it with the rest of the Bible and the ages and so forth that have passed on oh I love that praise God imagine not just taking a whole year on The Book of Revelations or a whole year on The Book of Job praise God what a what a lesson praise God what a time to be now here's the progress I've made so in yellow are the ones I preached through to our church here starting back in 2016 I started in Galatians and then Ephesians and of course they've been spread out you know I'll I'll stop preaching on them for a while then I always come back to them so now I want to jump up there to Romans and we'll kind of see maybe I'll do Corinthians after that and Thessalonians and so forth all the way down uh finishing Paul's books if I'm not mistaken then Philemon would be the final book and I read a lot of that last week maybe the final one from Paul if I'm not mistaken so those are the dates you know I preached five sermons only five on Galatians 24 on Ephesians 17 on Philippians and just 10 on on Colossians there and I'm not going to go through these I you know I went through these last time I kind of want to get to the Book of Revelations I didn't have I didn't have it all done but here let's look at the impact Romans had on two Church age Messengers I'm not certain how familiar you are with the history but the book of Romans was Major it was Major in the life of Martin Luther right because what was his whole message the just shall live by faith what book is that in Romans Romans Romans God used Romans to bring the the the the the fifth Church age messenger out of the denomination it's beautiful praise God and that was quoting habakkuk praise God so God used the prophet Paul from another prophet's message praise God Hallelujah now this is from this website Ligonier out there they're Reformed Presbyterian I think I don't even know what that means we remember John Wesley giving his testimony I'm sorry this is Wesley let me go yeah let me go to uh Martin Luther when we think of the agonizing struggle of an augustinian monk in Germany who sought desperately in every corner of the church to find peace and Assurance of Salvation and something that would soothe this conscience from The Assault of the law of God that left him as it were hanging suspended by his own testimony over the pit of Hell so that that's what a denomination will do to you it'll feel like you're hanging over hell but church we don't want to feel like that we want to feel like we're seated in Heavenly places amen hallelujah thank God Amen Lord don't let me feel like I'm hanging over hell make me feel like I got Assurance like I'm seated in heaven hallelujah oh I love that don't you amen hallelujah I don't want to feel like you know I'm just barely hanging over hell and and the the Flames of hell are so close to me I'm so close to hell I want to be so far in heaven that I know I'm sealed into heaven praise God I'm sealed in the kingdom of God hallelujah amen until the day of my Redemption praise God but that's what a denomination will get you well that's what guilt will get you That's what Satan wants you to feel like you're just hanging over hell barely even saved and almost ready to be lost we've already shown it to you you can't be lost you've already passed from Death unto life amen it's impossible because Jesus went to hell for us praise God Amen thank God Amen that's what the domination will do it'll make you feel like you're almost in hell this scholar one evening in the tower Was preparing lectures and he was doing research into the lectures that he would give on tomorrow he came to an illuminated understanding of the word of God that would change the course of his life and think of it all of church history think about that in other words brother random wouldn't be where he was unless Martin Luther got this revelation right neither would John Wesley and you can go through all the William Seymour we preached on that right earlier in the last year he wouldn't have got where he was except Martin Luther had the Revelation that came out of the book of Romans Hallelujah thank God change though course of history praise God now church I don't know if we're going to change the world history but one thing we can change our family history right when you're the last Laramie left you can change the family history praise God hallelujah thank God Amen Church let's change the history of our families amen let's leave a mark If time should go on like brother I said let's leave footprints on the sands of time so people can know Jesse and Kristen serve God hallelujah this is the testimony they left God forbid if I should pass away and you go through all my things you'll find hopefully a testimony of God's grace boy this man really walked with God Amen that's what I want you to find Hallelujah that's right where I live my life amen and may the same be said about each one of us praise God that you change the history of your family praise God oh thank God I'll say like this we're changing the history of Akron amen there's a light in Akron amen Souls can get saved in hacker and praise God oh thank God Amen thank God when Martin Luther came to a fresh understanding of the book of Romans he said when I understood this text the doors of paradise swung open is that how you feel when you read the Bible come on Church come on somebody say Amen is that how you feel you feel like the doors of Heaven are swinging open that's what I felt like when I come to the Bible wow I'm no longer a fear of slade I'm not a slave to fear anymore I'm not a slave to my sins anymore I feel like heaven has accepted me I'm a brand new person I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man praise God old things have passed away I've been born again amen I love that song more than a conqueror that's what I am I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man Hallelujah oh thank God when I read the Bible when I read the book of Romans it's as if the paradise Gates swung open and I walked inside and I walk through oh my I walked into Paradise after reading the book of Romans oh praise God sure sometimes I just realize you know we just need a reminder of what God's done for us right we've been saved we've been Sanctified we've been filled with the Holy Ghost but sometimes we just need to remind her what did God actually do for us praise God because we're so busy which we ought to be you know we're working and family and all these things but thank God for these times where we can look back and say look what God actually did for us Lord I I thank you that when I got saved as if as Heaven Heaven's Gates opened wide for me and not just the gates open wide actually the windows open wide too amen I tell you when you pay your times and offerings he said I open up the windows and I pour out a blessing you can't even receive Hallelujah oh that's the truth of the word of God Amen not only are the gates open the windows are open praise God I just struck me here amen Glory he said it was the book of Romans that awakened Luther to the doctrine of justification remember declare righteous as you wish to be by faith alone and persuaded him that this was the article on which the church stands or Falls amen let me know today you're standing because of you're Justified by faith that's what you stand on right you're not justified by works right the church said now we know Paul talks about that but it's faith it just means faith faith does work right because you believe because you're saved you show appreciation and you do works but you're not justified by works you're justified by faith Hallelujah and then if you're really justified by faith then you go to working for Jesus amen oh that's right that's right amen all these great Mysteries he lays out in this book oh it's beautiful thank God I'm standing on the justification of Jesus blood I'm not standing on brother branham's testimony I'm not standing on Martin Luther's testimony or anyone else I'm standing on Jesus Christ's blood amen that's the foundation that's my rock that my life has built on praise God that's my cornerstone amen oh thank God as a result of this experience the book of Romans became the central point of theological controversy in the 16th century and became known as the book of the Reformation well I guess maybe then the Book of Revelation will be the book of The Rapture for us thank God Amen Hallelujah how do we love the Book of Revelation praise God that's what these Amish people are telling me they're like brother Jesse the way I know brother man was a prophet is because all these Amish preachers they they told us not to read the book of Revelation too often they said you'll go crazy imagine if a preacher stood from this pulp and said now you don't you don't read that too much you're going to go crazy if you read the Bible too much that's what they told them their whole life and they always knew something's not right with that he said I know the Bible says blessed are those who keep these words and hear these words why are we going a little blessing instead of a lot of blessing and then he said as soon as he heard brother Brown preach on the book of Revenue Revelation he said it all made sense the Bible became a new Bible praise God oh thank God and it's like the Gates of Heaven the gates of paradise were open to the Amish community praise God oh that's right church amen God give us the book of The Rapture praise God the Book of Revelation oh thank God we remember John Wesley giving his testimony to his powerful conversion experience as he listened to a sermon at alder's gate where during the sermon he said he felt his heart strangely warmed and that sermon that night was from The Book of Romans praise God so Martin Luther the Sardis Church age messenger the Philadelphian Church age messenger were both enlightened and inspired by The Book of Romans praise God isn't that beautiful Hallelujah beautiful now there's so many beautiful subjects in here I'm going to get to this later but chapter one has the power of the Gospel chapters one two and three the Jews and Gentiles and the entire world are guilty having fallen short of God's glory justification by faith the meaning of baptism in four five and six marriage and divorce remember we preached on invisible Union and it's as if you never did in this first place where'd brother bam get that out of Romans 7. Roman seven right the battle with sin remember Paul said I hate what I do but then or he said I serve god with the with the law of my mind I love the law of God but then I do things that I hate that's right here that's right here Romans 7. the Assurance of God love God's love nothing can separate you 16 things Paul says nothing these 16 things cannot separate you from the love of God death sorrow sword famine nothing shall separate us from God's love amen amen hallelujah he tells us to walk in the spirit praise God there's no condemnation to them that walk in the spirit and then we see the sovereignty of God right Jacob have I loved Esau have I hate it I raise up Pharaoh for this person he's a vessel of Destruction unto me right we see the sovereignty of God God chooses whoever he chooses for whatever purpose because of predestination he knows what they're going to choose as we looked at a few Sundays ago and we in this book we have the mystery we have one of the 12 mysteries in this book The Mystery of Israel's blindness and then we have Liberties as Christians and we have Kingdom truths like the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but it's righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost I forgot to say let's have a communion this Sunday night by God's grace I forgot I was going to announce that I forgot to say that let's let's take the Lord's Supper on Sunday night by God's grace sometimes I give announcements right during the middle of serving so it's a little out of order brother Jesse I know I forgot so forgive me forgive me sometimes I forget let's take I want to take the Lord's Supper here let me write that down here by God's grace it had come up there and I listened to the sermon I was trying to find a sermon in case there was no preacher for Sunday so I was listening to communion 1957 brother Graham had some really beautiful quotes in there now here's some important quotes just from Brother random just just random quotes about the book about Romans in general remember when brother random would get blue and discouraged which book would he go to Romans he'd go to the scripture that says and Abraham staggered not at the promise of God Hallelujah where do you go when you get discouraged well the ram goes to Roman he went to Romans 4. Romans 4. beautiful every time he got a little blue a little sad little depressed a little Melancholy what would cheer him up Abraham's testimony would cheer him up Abraham was not weak in faith and he considered not his own body now dead but he staggered not at the promise of God he was strong given God glory church if you're if you're discouraged tonight just give God glory because that's what heaven is going to remember praise God Heaven can't remember your sins because Jesus blood already done away with him praise God but let Heaven remember let there be memorials in heaven that you and I praise God in the hard times we were strong in faith praise God we staggered nods at troubles we overcame struggles and heaven will say we never staggered amen we were over covers we never turned back and so I'm turning my back on God no even though we fail even though we struggled we still got up we still kept moving forward we never turned our back on God heaven where we heaven will record our divine commentary brother Adam says our divine commentary is that we were strong in faith we never gave up we never staggered we were Overcomers amen thank God Amen thank you Jesus if you notice Paul couldn't teach the Corinthians deep things they were they were a baby Church they were a baby they couldn't go in them deep great deep messages that he did to the Ephesians and into the Romans to teach them the Deep things of God because they wasn't able to take it they just depended too much on little Sensations and little things like that just well praise the Lord I got it I have a revelation come to me I have a Psalm I have a prophecy now I don't know how much of that you know I don't know how far to go on that because remember he told the Corinthians he said you're a chaste version of Christ I've espoused you they were engaged to Christ now there's a brother in there that was having the sexual relations with his stepmom he had to be removed from the church right so there was definitely some immaturity there and the church had not yet mourned over it so that was we'd say a backflip in church right they didn't mourn over sexual sin but by the second book they all repented praise God so here we just see this this this thought that the book of Romans is a deep book it's full of great truths and great Revelations praise God so I preach a year and a half on this book I don't want to get any text messages saying brother Jesse when are you gonna got a book of Rome no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm just joking Like the quote from Brother Branham it's a deep book church and we need to understand these truths praise God church that's my prayer if somebody can just come in here and feel like Heaven's been open for him then I've done my job and I just surrender to God if I can just come in here and somebody leaves out here a better Christian they got more praise for God they got a hope for the future they got some great blessing then I can say hallelujah it was worth it all praise God amen praise God that's what Martin Luther got out of the book of Romans he got out and experience where it felt like he'd entered into Paradise through the word of God Hallelujah door is your husband how many see your life as you living in a paradise right now because of God's blessings think about that who's living who feels like I'm in a paradise of God's blessings if we don't it's time to rub our eyes with some eye salve so we stopped looking at the natural things and look at some spiritual things but Amanda said you need some Joy he said go get the ladder in in this arcade room he said go get the ladder and start climbing up and grab you some Joy up there and the church said Hallelujah anybody need any faith tonight he said go get the ladder he said go climb the ladder and go up there and get a hold of some faith and say this was bought for me this is my possession this is my inheritance Jesus died so I can have faith amen Hallelujah and I know you wanna I'm just trying to encourage you by God's grace I'm just trying to just trying to give you some courage right by God's grace we've been together a long time and I plan to be together a long time as well by God's grace I was reading the book uh oh yeah this is oh yeah this is beautiful yeah I mentioned this earlier I just kind of jumped ahead I was reading over there in the book of Romans the fourth chapter where Paul wrote The Divine commentary on the life of Abraham now we know Abraham many times got kind of frustrated like we do don't raise your hands with who's been frustrated this week but when the commentary was written there wasn't any of his flusterations mentioned you see never mention them at all Oh you mean that uh that Pride you struggle with that's not going to be mentioned in heaven not a word about it that sexual Temptation you struggle with you mean that's not going to be mentioned in heaven not a word of it that lying problem you have when you lie like Abraham lied and Isaac lied that line problem I got you mean that's not going to be mentioned in heaven not a word of it why God's only going to let his Divine commentary be rich and praise God he forgives amen he ever lives to forgive praise God he'll only let the good be recorded that's a blessing that's the heritage of God's people praise God amen think about that how would you worship tonight how would you act tonight if you knew heaven was not going to record any of your doubts fears flustrations how about complaining anybody could say Amen to that amen God is not there's not going to be any record of our complaining up there in heaven there's just going to be record of all the times you exercise faith you praise God in the midst of the trials you were strong in faith giving God glory Heaven's going to record that uh we have somebody ought to say Amen to that praise God Amen see that's the way I hope mine will be wrote up there Oh you mean you're going to have it you're gonna have a testimony in heaven yes it's called the Lamb's Book of Life praise God hallelujah and there perhaps there's a book of life like uh like sir night and The Splendid way perhaps there's a special book of life amen and it's got your name on it praise God and it tells the story of your testimony amen I Hope Church how many hope they got a good book like that there is not my mistakes but just what I tried to do for God oh granted Lord that in heaven only the things that are recorded are all that I tried to do for you praise God not the things I did selfishly for me but only the things I try to do for you let that be recorded in heaven sister who I hope that's how it is Amen brother Austin I hope that having only records what we tried to do for Jesus amen we tried to sing some songs and record some songs for Jesus amen hallelujah we tried to give God praise we tried to give God glory we tried to win souls we tried to preach to those of them a preacher we try to do everything we could and it was all done for Jesus Hallelujah oh my only the intentions of my heart for God's people oh I hope that's how it is church I hope Heaven records all the times I tried to have the right intention I wanted to help the Saints here I wanted to encourage them I want to help them to overcome I wanted to hear them shout and praise the Lord I wanted to see them give victories I wanted to see them overcome I hope Heaven sees my good intentions praise God oh thank God they studied the scriptures day and night generation he's speaking of the Jews and they still got blinded their eyes said God did that's what he said God knows what he wants so here brother I'm saying in Romans we learn God does whatever he wants we don't tell God what to do God tells us what to do we cannot tell them what to do did not Paul in the Book of Romans 8 chapter say God raise up pharaoh and hard in his heart blind his eyes for the same purpose that he might that I'm sorry that his will might be worked was not Esau and Jacob Esau refused before the boy was ever born God despised him you see it's all working according to God's Great predestination he's not one that's asleep he knows exactly Church let's have him let's have courage for our lost loved ones tonight that God has orchestrated everything by predestination first be thankful that you're in the faith but now have some courage that God's Got A Plan amen God still has a plan it might not look like it might not feel like it not might not sound like it but God's got a predestinated plan and God knows what he's doing and God's plan is perfect our plans would be awful but God has the best plan Hallelujah amen he's not the one that's asleep Church we're the ones that go to sleep we're the ones who get tired of praying we're the ones who give up we're the ones who get discouraged sometimes but God is faithful praise God thank you Lord I'm going to skip this one this one this just shows how Paul got the inspiration uh that's from the fifth seal this just shows brother random proves Jews can be saved in the fist seal through the book of Romans so think about that again to prove a mystery of God brother Ram to prove a mystery in Revelation brother went to the Book of Romans to prove it praise God it's not only does it open up the gates of paradise it also opens up the seals and the church said right how did Brother Bear improve the seals are right from other scriptures in the Bible right because not one word can contradict another Hallelujah we ought to be the most confident people when we do uh debating with people Austin and I would do it on text you know we debate with people or I debate online or whatever we ought to be the most confident people because we know God's word cannot fail and if God has given us or thus saith the Lord that we know it's true from Genesis to Revelation praise God Hallelujah now before we get into chapter one here I didn't set a timer schofield's outline I think Scofield was inspired on many things not all he was a trinitarian but many things so here it says yes seven steps plus the introduction it doesn't come the introduction so we get the introduction The Book of Romans the first section is the whole world I will whole hole that's wrong I meant to say whole world the whole whole of the world the whole whole people are guilty before God from chapter 1 18 to chapter 3 20. the second section is we're justified by faith and that's the solution for all of our guilt if anybody feels guilty tonight let's take your attention to the blood of Jesus Christ because that's where you can lose your guilt right that's where you can lose your depression that's where you can lose your bad attitude you can find all Deliverance in the cross praise God it all flows out because love thrown out of the Cross Hallelujah God's mercy God's grace it all flows out of the Cross praise God if you need hope look to the Cross if you need forgiveness look to the Cross if you need courage look to the Cross amen if you need Victory look to the Cross if you need anything look that Jesus's cross amen oh Hallelujah praise God Church be encouraged keep seeking God you know there's a saint one of the Saints there I forget her name but she's seen a vision of the Lord she saw a vision of the Lord recently I know a young girl who saw a vision of the Lord too of course this was an adult lady but she drew a picture of it do I have it yeah I think I got it she drew a picture of her she was so shocked she woke up just uh in in shock yeah here it is maybe I can airdrop this here to show it to you just be encouraged God is speaking to people and that's what I love here's a here's a person fresh in the out of the domination and she's hungering after God and God shows her vision beautiful okay I think it's coming through right now there it is all right I'm gonna make this larger here we go so she had this vision and she drew it out she said now it's hard to see in here but this is a throne she said I think this was the throne and you have this blue glory and this yellow anointing and then all this she saw this in a vision and she sent a copy of this to all of her Amish family even the ones that won't come out and she said Jesus is Alive amen praise God that look familiar cares I don't know hopefully it does but see when people are hungering for God gods are showing up in their dreams amen hallelujah praise God you're hungry for God God's gonna show up on the job Hallelujah God's going to show up in the school praise God he's going to show up when you're doing chores amen washing dishes or whatever you're doing there by the by the bathroom by the sink window praise God he's going to show up in your car sister that's right amen hallelujah let's keep our hearts and Minds on God he's real he's here to bless us he's here to encourage us he's here to show us how real he is praise God that's one benefit technology right there pretty nice just so you know I put out videos about all these lies coming out of random Tabernacle put on a new one today if you're interested in those kind of things brother Jose gave me a comment he said I love this brother Jesse God bless you I said God bless you buddy I miss you praise God somebody's got to do it those preachers told Brother Brown said brother Branham it's not your job to ball out the women with uh Bob's hair and wear her makeup he said it's the past program it's the pastor's job to do it remember Ram said well if the pastors don't do it somebody's got a ball out against it so I put that quote on the first video I said if they ain't gonna do it I'm gonna do it praise God I'm gonna let my voice speak against the lies because I got a revelation amen the Gates of Heaven have opened unto me praise God I've got a revelation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and if we've got discernment if anybody's gotten discernment in this church we ought to know the right Spirit from the wrong spirit and the church said I'm glad I got the Holy Ghost I'm glad I got the sermon amen I can judge that's not from God that is from God you see the people that won't say something that shows they don't have the gift of discernment or that it's just so weak and frail they can't even use it because it's so it's so lazy that so how do you say unexercise it's not even a word it's so uh it's so neglected there's the word all right try to get better at English here because that's the solution church for all of our guilt is the cross and then we see the Believers walk in in the Holy Spirit from chapter 5 12 on to six I'm sorry 813 and then the final result the blessing of God that's that that section on the love of God nothing can separate us from God's love what is the whole conclusion of this nothing can separate us from God's love nothing nothing can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus do you feel loved tonight by Jesus you want to even if other people don't feel you don't feel people loving you you ought to feel that Jesus loves you because he does he's faithful and then God's promises to Israel chapters 9 through 11. and then the Christian Life and service now remember that Asbury Revival was started by preaching Romans in that interesting Romans 12 that denominational Revival of justification it was started by preaching Romans 12. I'm glad we had a Revival out of Psalms 49. hey that's what we had amen that's what I got praise God Amen where's the Acura Revival right here right here here I am here you are you're the actor Revival praise God when you're revived you feel alive in Christ you're the Revival praise God I'm not waiting for it to come it's in me praise God hallelujah I'm revered I'm not feeling dead to Christ I'm feeling alive hallelujah thank God I feel alive amen thank God Glory I'm so revived I got to make sure I don't hit my head when I'm jumping around in their garages over there so they got the garage door things hanging I gotta make sure okay make sure I don't hit that praise God jump like David jumps amen Lori now here's a brief description of Rome and I got the websites you know if you're interested in reading more but I wrote more on my book there about the um the city of Rome in the first century but I didn't have a chance to review it so maybe Lord willing we'll look at that next week by God's grace now I don't know if you knew this church but the Roman Emperor Claudius banished all the Jews from Rome around 49 A.D now they already had they already had Christian churches in Rome they were Jew and Gentile churches but then he Claudius banned all the Jews I forget why but then he only lived five more years and after he died all the Jewish Christians came back but they found it in different conditions so when they were there they would they would all they would preach Jesus but they'd also preach Moses they could see the connections well five years later if all the Jews are gone and nobody knows the Torah what are you going to preach well you're going to preach Christ and Kim crucified right well now that makes sense why did Paul have to write the things he did in the Book of Romans because he's dealing with churches that had a little bit of Jewish Foundation they forgot it all and now the Jews come back and there's problems in the church now there'd never be any problems in our church there would never be a problem in the bride of Christ Fellowship of course there are right we all we at one time uh all of us are problems at one time or another right we all we all we all get in the flesh sometimes but you you know with with Gentiles they wouldn't know the Old Testament the Jews would be more prone to be what more legal right or more more disciplined things like that and so created some problems so Paul had to write a letter that would clear up ever all the arguments in the church and he ends up writing the most beautiful piece of literature some preachers say in the entire Bible now of course that's Up For Debate yeah well I think the Book of Revelation is more beautiful no brothers brother it's Romans brother let's not argue about that let's keep the peace of the church now Paul writes this letter you know three to six years after the Jews came back and they've been having some trouble understanding and loving one another think about and think about Romans 12 think about the things Paul addressed to these people just do not be overcome with evil but overcome in the church brother Paul yes in the church in the church overcoming evil with good oh my God that's right church sometimes churches have evil in them don't they it's called leaven right it's called sin unconfessed sin or it's called complexes that doesn't mean we deserve every time we get a complex I'm leaving the church well pretty soon you're gonna have no churches to go to whatever Church you go to You're gonna take your complex there the thing to do is clean out your heart and talk to the person or people about it so there's no more complex and then you can keep moving on with God right I'm thankful there's not a lot of churches around here because in the other part of Ohio there's lots of churches close together and people just church out from one Church to the other well I don't like how it's going here I'll go to this one then pretty soon I don't like this one I'll go to the other one when you're going to get a revelation of of your flock you little sheep you sweet little humble sheep when are you going to get a revelation of where your flock is when when in the natural do you see sheep changing flocks oh my that's a good thought well Shepherd I'd like to take my fellowship card and go somewhere else is that okay sir no they want to stay with their family Glory so should you amen you should want to stay with your spiritual family praise God well you're my third Shepherd and in as many years can I go see my four Shepherd now how many Shepherds do you need can't you find which one did God which one did God I thought I'd pray they ought to pray which one did God ordain to feed my soul now people have a choice you can drive an hour 15 away or I guess you could drive 30 minutes south right if you go to Dalton but the main thing is we don't care where you go the main thing is have a revelation that you're in the right spot praise God because if you keep running from problems if you keep leaving problems you're going to be the problem eventually more problems are going to come up so Paul wrote this letter how can I bring peace to a lot of these situations in the church praise God I got this from a different website the ESV now I don't believe in the ESV but I had a pretty good write-up and I had some good scripts so go to I go to Romans 15 22. you got your Bibles there I mean by Malachi Lydia Emma Reed up here maybe Romans 15 22. it's just a good thought I never had seen it like this before Romans 15 22. um so here this website said the theme of Romans is the Cross of Christ God judges sin and at the same time he shows saving Mercy that's a pretty good summary you know and if you summoned up in one sentence that's a pretty good summary now the purpose Paul wrote Romans to unite the Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome in the gospel I don't that sound familiar we just got through Colossians what happened in chapter two he had to he had to tell the Jews not to make Revelation I'm sorry regulations about New Moon days or keeping this sabbath day or that Sabbath day so in any church you have people that are more legalistic and then you have more people that are less more Carefree because they like that care remember he's a better word and they get too Carefree so think about which one are you well bro Jess I'm always right down the middle of the road I hope that's true something tells me that's probably not right see all of us are either you know a little more legalistic and rules regulations or just Carefree I'm just I'm just God's blessing to the world you know it don't matter if I pray or not don't matter if I read my Bible God is Anointed me come on somebody my goodness we all need a good balance right down the middle praise God the Bible says search out your own salvation with fear and trembling and then the Bible says Rejoice always and again I say rejoice amen Hallelujah that's what we need we people who are balanced praise God they got some regulations in their life they know they got to keep this thing up they got to keep good habits or else they're going to get in bad habits but they also know there's freedom and liberty if I make a mistake or if I get tired if I get frustrated if I get flusterations my Divine commentary will still say no charges Jesus dropped the charges amen hallelujah but still say no charges Satan can can lay no charges to God's elect Hallelujah ah I feel like preaching tonight praise God hey man thank God Amen thank you Jesus now this was new to me I never realized this part of the reason he wrote was because he was going to make Rome a pit stop on his way because he wanted to go to Spain think about that from Jerusalem to Spain by boat and foot the church said I need to calculate how many miles that is now which one of you are willing to do that what am I am I willing to do that now like I said I want to do Outreach work like I told the Amish down there in the sermon I think you heard it unless that was the moment when the live stream went out so sorry about that but I said you know you got to give tithes and offerings and you do something with that let the pastor live off it you can just study preach and pray or I said put it to missionaries I said you could buy a van and preachers can go preach to the Amish that I've never heard the message and you should have heard I got some of the loudest amens when I was in that little garage there they're like amen oh yeah I hit something good there praise God thank you Jesus see and I love that they want their people to hear the word of God like they've heard it Ah that's all I wanted I just want my family to hear it like I got to hear praise God and my friends amen that's why I make those YouTube videos it's one reason so my family and friends if they're afraid to go to church maybe they'll click on that little link there like Pam Parsons did or whoever else would do it I really enjoyed your testimony brother just oh you listen to my you wrote my YouTube channel well praise God Amen Hallelujah that's what's there for praise God it's for those Nicodemus type that just like to come by night time I don't want to come during the day I'm too ashamed I'll talk to a message person someone who's in a culture someone who's like that but I'll I'll sneak and watch it in late night in on my smartphone well that's fine Nicodemus praise God there's even room for Nicodemus at the cross he was born out through Jesus anyway and praise God Bible's transformed my life it's the power of God under salvation to me praise God and all those that believe in Christ Jesus amen ah Hallelujah I'm also preaching First Corinthians 1 now my God all right Malachi read uh verse 22 15 22. so now this was a new goal he had he said if I can straighten out the problems there in Rome I can make it like a center stop I'll stop there on my way to go to Spain so Malachi 22. all right now read 23 there Emma thank you amen and 24 Lydia amen that was brand new to me she had a purpose I've got a I've got to clear up all the all the divisions among Jews and gentiles in other words all the legalists in the church and all the Carefree people in the church I gotta find a way to unite people that have two different World Views but they both say they believe in Christ how can I unite them I know how by the word of God because faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God the word of God will always unite True Believers that's exactly right Hallelujah all right now get your Bibles here I'm gonna that was my last slide because I took my other notes Here on the uh phone here didn't have a chance to put them on the slides but I know you don't care praise God I don't care either it's just nice it just kind of slows me down that's why I do the slides it slows me down sister Emma slows me down and also it you know when I use without I used to preach without the Powerpoints I used to have to scroll like where's that part at where's that part at where's that it was a really really frustrating for me but now sometimes I still do that but not as much okay Romans 1 verse one all right now we'll try to get down to verse 12 okay we'll try to finish up here I'll make it hang on for a few more minutes praise God if you're sleepy like brother Cam said or like uh brother uh what's the other brother said that just rebuke that sleepy Spirit praise God I'm gonna stay awake I'm gonna hear the word of God this is the open Gates of paradise for me amen praise God if it was open gates for Martin Luther it let it be the open gates for me praise God that I can rejoice in the Book of Romans first one Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God in our church we've got to see this too God has called you and God has separated you to be a Christian there's there's a reason you're here in Akron you are separated unto God's work in other words God knew you couldn't do the work anywhere else you had to do it here praise God you're called and separated remember in Acts 17 God knows the boundaries of your habitation he determined where you would live on purpose because that's where he called you to Hallelujah that's right verse 2. I mean you can ask my wife how many times have family and friends told me boy brother Jesse I wish you lived close to us we go to your church well they have a choice they could leave and they could come to Akron they really if they really like my Precision that much they really feel the spirit of God they'd come here and God would bless them praise God but instead they choose to live a foolish virgin life or something like that that's their choice but they don't have to live like that I'll tell you you take a stand for God God will stand for you praise God amen I have an Uber family family members Emma some of our family members said well brother Jesse if you were here uh you we go to your church no you wouldn't because if you love me that much you come here praise God now verse two which he promised a four what he promised a separated gospel he promised the gospel of four by His prophets in the Holy scriptures now later you'll see that in Romans 9 10 11. remember it talks about Hosea and Isaiah all their prophecy Jeremiah they all prophesied that the Gentiles would receive salvation thank God we got it amen ah thank God we can be saved Hallelujah right verse 3 concerning his son Jesus Christ Our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh of course that traces him that satisfies the Jews right there they care about that Gentiles not really a big deal satisfies the Jews verse four now look at this and declare to be the Son of God with power now don't the Bible say when you get the Holy Ghost it's power you're not the Son of God but you're a child of God and you've got power too praise God amen Jesus Anointed with the Holy Ghost right in Acts 10 48 I believe how God anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and he went around doing signs Miracles and wonders because of the anointing that was on him amen may God anoint us with his power to do the works that he wants us to do in this place praise God I'm talking about Akron that's what I'm talking about or Doylestown right is that where we all live in actually I could endorse town Barberton yeah that's right Barbara there we go Barbara thank you any other place uh Coventry I'm not sure your address but in this location here this General location and he's got power according to the spirit of Holiness now see what gives you power living a holy life remember brother can't preach on consecration brother Brooks preach on it too consecration brings power when you're consecrated to God's word you'll see power in your life more power how many can say Amen to that when you're really doing when you're really trying to follow God the best of your ability you find more power in those moments Spirit of holiness praise God because God is God has a law right the law of the Holy Spirit what a man uh what a man sows that's what he reaps praise God now by the resurrection from the dead for finishing verse 4. I want to stop just I want to make a few comments on verse five by whom we have received Grace and apostleship so Jesus Christ gave you Grace how many could say thank you for that gift he gave the Bible said he gave you Grace how many received it now see Jesus tried to give Judas the grace but he turned it down right but you and I have not just just been given it we've kept it we've received it church we live by it praise God and if you read Paul's writings he said I labor by the grace of God ah I work by God's grace oh God help me always to work by your grace your favor your unmarried favor in my life an apostleship so Paul I'm sorry Paul received an apostle from Jesus Christ for what why do you get Grace and apostleship for what for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name so God called you God Gave You spiritual power over Satan so you would obey the faith and glorify his name so it's power to obey it's power to keep the word of God tonight it's power to keep the word of God tomorrow praise God for this nation for those of us in this nation it's power for us to obey the word of God while we're living in the United States of America praise God let the whole nation do whatever they want but we are called to obedience in this nation Hallelujah verse 6 among whom here also called of Jesus Christ thank God to all that be in Rome now here he gets to the Romans beloved of God called to be Saints grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ so again Church who's God's beloved who is God's special love person the Saints the Saints God loves his Saints you are the app like the Bible said Solomon and this unified you're the apple of his eye in other words when he looks at you he really likes you I mean I look at all the sisters I say God bless you Sister but when I look at my wife I'm thinking I love I love it I love you darling she's the app on my eye I don't give those looks to anybody else I give to my wife because she's the out and that's where the Bible said you're the Beloved of God you're God's beloved praise God he's called to be a saint he's called you me which means a separated one they're called of God church every time you come up for a prayer or whenever you got saved that was you responding to God's call God was calling sisters are I'm calling you brother Austin I'm calling you Garris I'm calling you and what'd you do you respond to the call you said yes Lord yes Lord whatever you want me to do I'll do it praise God you preached to me three times a week and then I'll listen to my own at home and I'll do what you call me to do you give me visions you give me dreams you give me you've been giving me healings I'll testify of them amen praise God Amen you caught me I'll do what you called me to do praise God that's what we need today we need people to do what God's called us to do verse eight first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all I can say the same I thank God for everybody in our church I thank God for every saint in Akron don't you aren't you grateful don't you miss the Saints when they don't come to church I'm like oh Lord help him Jesus where are they help them Lord have mercy so first of all I thank God for all you all through Christ that your faith is spoken of throughout the world now this is something I want to stop on for a moment this church must have had testimonies that were so powerful they were spread all around the world all around the world now we're not in a competition right but there's some testimonies that travel further than others so like my wife and I we're part of the Lima Revival it's traveled around the nation I don't know if it's probably not the world but it has traveled around the nation and people say oh you're in that group with brother Brooks and okay that was you you were in there yeah that's that was by God's grace I didn't know what was going on I was just I just felt like the gates of paradise were open to me I just walked in the gates amen I was baptized and started serving the lord and loving God but that people hear about your faith and it spreads that's why I love the podcast that we got to do and the testimonies in the videos so now people all around the world can know what God's done in our lives that's the nice thing about technology people can hear about the faith of sister Hua people can hear about the faith of brother amen and brother Austin's face which his testimony is the highest downloaded testimony out of all of ours part one brother they really like part one part two and three are a little bit far behind but part one is the that's higher than my testimony and the amen testimony everybody's testimony Austin testimony shook somebody up I think it's around 200 downloads or something like that oh we just passed 2 000 downloads on all of our podcasts so that was pretty neat to see that we just been doing it for a year you know it's nice to see wow 2 000 people wanted to download our our testimonies but there's some testimonies like the the sister healed there in Tim Pruitt's church that one's gone around the world she's healed of cancer and she was she was going to the doctor on Monday it's a beautiful story if you haven't watched it I'd encourage you to watch it I think her last name is Sister butts I think is his last name if I'm not mistaken was it olena Alina right and you've been to their church that's right there you can well she was diagnosed with cancer and a terminal cancer and she went to church you know as usual on a Sunday she was going the next day for a scan the next scans and brother Tim started singing uh leaning on the Everlasting Arms and I think the holy spirit said you are completely cancer free and she started dancing they got the video she started dancing around the church like this ah hallelujah thank you Jesus she went around the church around the church and sure enough Church they went she went to the doctor the next day they did the scans she put her hands up like this no cancer the previous one because you can see it it's on Facebook and everything big old cancer right there next scan no cancer who did that Jesus ah I've heard of your faith evening light Tabernacle it's going around the world praise God now we thank God for that that's wonderful but now who wants to get cancer for that kind of a testimony let's see let's think about these things no I think it's just God's grace God's mercy and so the Point Church I want to bring out is that some testimonies go around the world others are less known but they're all known to Jesus absolutely this and you can make them known to your family and friends not all of them are going to go around the world but they can go around your family like that dream that sister had there yeah that's good that's good time I didn't think about that she sent a copy to everybody in her family look God show me a vision look at that she got a glimpse of the Throne of that I've never had that I've been serving God for 23 years I've never had that thank God Amen thank God I'm happy for a praise God I got some Godly jealousy sure yeah of course but in a good way Lord speak to me give me dreams missions okay I'll come back on Sunday with a dream revision if not I'm still serving Jesus remember Church the world may not know but God knows amen this is what Jesus told the Saints in the church ages in Revelation 2 2 Revelation 2 9 Revelation 2 13 Revelation 2 19 Revelation 3 1 Revelation 3 8 and Revelation 3 15 Jesus said I know your Works let's say it again Jesus said I know your work he's watching you praise God he's seeing all of us you're trying to do amen and he writes it down he's keeping track even if the world doesn't know it Jesus knows that praise God he's going to bless you for that Hallelujah remember church he can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities so in the midst of your hardest trial when you feel pain or you feel discouragement or you feel rejected or you feel guilt that's the time to reach out to somebody who understands how you feel praise God that's the time to reach out to Christ because he knows your Works he knows the testimonies he knows what you're going through Hallelujah Hebrews 7 25 says he ever lives to make intercession for you in church the world like I've said before I don't care if my little humble insignificant life I don't care if anybody knows about me like that song says I only want them know about Jesus I don't care if they know my name I just want them to know Jesus's name because I can't do nothing for them but Jesus can change their life Jesus can give them eternal life amen oh thank God thank you Jesus but they had a faith that was worldwide known like brother Branson known around the world all right here we go verse 9 for God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit how do you serve God church with your mind remember your soul is always your soul is never going to sin and the church said but you've got to bring your mind into a servant to the word of God that means you've got to choose not to think about the lies you've got to choose and serve god with your mind you got to bring your mind and your thoughts into subjection he didn't say I serve God with my soul now of course if the Holy Spirit float out of his soul but he said I serve God with my thought life I have to surrender my thoughts to God Hallelujah I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers and that's something didn't we read that in the other in the other book he's always praying for the Philippians he's always praying for the Colossians and he's always praying for the Romans God help us to always pray for somebody that's why I put that on there I'm gonna pray for brother Jim's church I'm praying for the brother canisters if I can't pray for anybody else I ought to pray for them praise God as good as they've been to me it's wonderful we've had services with all their preachers you know I ought to remember somebody praise God he said just praying for myself all the time I want to pray for somebody else right Church verse 10 I'm almost done making a requests if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you see he was just praying I just wanted to come see you and eventually he did go to Rome church he ended up dying in Rome he died in Rome he just wanted to see the Saints but is it interesting he longed to see them but he actually went there to give his life as a sacrifice for Christ and the spirit kept telling him right like agabus the spirit kept telling you got to go to Rome give your life as a testimony give her life give her life he really just longed to see the Saints but he was actually achieving his Destiny to die as a martyr he was actually led to Rome he wrote to them this beautiful letter but he was actually LED there to give himself as a sacrifice as a lamb going to the slaughter so no doubt he wanted to see them so bad because he was also being drawn there to fulfill his destiny to give his life as a martyr for Jesus Christ bye by the will of God he did that remember Jesus said I must show him which which things he must suffer from my name's sake suffering was part of this right you can't know Jesus if you just know power and Glory Miracles you can't know him unless you also know his suffering as well we've got to have both churches Gotta Have what we've got to have power Supernatural experience got our visions but we also got to have the suffering of Christ as well all right I'm going to close with 11 and 12. for I long to see you why Paul that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end you may be established you know what established means confirmed steadfast or strengthened the reason I want to see the Saints is so they can be stronger when I leave in other words I know God's called me to preach like Paul said and so I just want the Lord to use me so the people walk out of here stronger they're more steadfast rather than getting quickly uh distracted by the enemy as soon as they leave church or tomorrow rather than that they'll be steadfast and they'll keep their Focus On Christ that's a beautiful request by the prophet of God I long to see the you that you can be stronger in faith when you leave verse 12 that is that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me so I'm closing with this Paul long to see them so the Holy Spirit could move and give them some spiritual gift and church that's my honest desire to I just want to see Lydia get a gift some some special gift maybe it was like the right what she needed to hear at that right time before sister Beatrice leaves us now I want her to receive a gift of the Holy Spirit praise God some spiritual blessing amen amen that's right Glory when Jose comes in here banging see all the saints I want them to receive some spiritual gift where they're stronger when they leave out here they're not discouraged or beaten down or depressed but they actually leave out of here stronger in their faith why so that they're comforted and Paul said I'm comforted Hallelujah that's why sometimes when people come up for prayer it's such an encouragement to me it doesn't have to happen every time but like on Sunday when they come up from prayer they say uh bro Jesse pray for me that I can have enough freedom to dance or I see that they have they have freedom over the spirit of fear and they did receive a spiritual gift last time I was there amen hallelujah praise God that's what a real preacher desires God to move God to bless his people and now they're not weaker they're not easily defeated by Satan but they're more steadfast against the enemy and they keep Satan under their feet by the grace of God that's the end of our feet musicians can come here praise God let's stand Church you know I long to see you tonight so God could impart someone spiritual gift to you my desire is that everyone walks out of here with a closer walk to the Lord my desire is not to bore anybody my desire is not to do do a comedy show my desire so people can receive some spiritual blessing and take that with them heading in tomorrow and that when a trial comes they'll be able to stand there with the word of God see I've heard the word of God I believe the word of God and this is the power of God to me praise God oh hallelujah thank God thank you Jesus let's bow our heads here the gates of paradise we're open to Martin Luther through the book of Romans Church what could be open to you through the book alone what is the church in need of tonight what are the people in need of tonight what a beautiful scripture to end with here tonight that's my prayer that some spiritual gift will be established and strengthened in your life here tonight maybe it's sighing and crying for the Abominations done in the city done the thing maybe it's a a desire like sister Emma told me last week the desire to keep somebody in prayer right to have a burden for this person to pray for this person and you can pray for this person with more fervency may God grant you comfort through this place you got it now may God grant me Comfort through the blessings the word of God has brought aren't you glad Church God's only going to record what you've tried to do for him wasn't that a beautiful quote from other brand he's written a Divine commentary and he's only going to record what you try to do it that challenge Hallelujah brother Austin staggered not at the at the peace of God but was strong in the faith giving God Mr Beatrice was strong in the thing stagger not at the foot instead give God more she called things as though they were even when they were not oh hallelujah oh my they got him thank you Jesus when God gives you Revelation you speak the revelation the brother Graham said if you don't ever Revelation he said just speak in Hope speaking hope and see if God will give you a revelation but don't be discouraged God's plan is perfect how we know his plan is perfect uh-huh I could probably preach again here because let's finish up father God we thank you for your love and your mercy so many beautiful thoughts came out tonight by the Holy Spirit I'm nothing I'm no preacher I just have a commission to preach I have to preacher thank you Lord but you've written a commentary already it's already finished because the word of God is already settled forever in heaven Hallelujah and all the members in my book were written before Lord even one hair of my head came on my head there we go before you forward me my mother's womb where I was fearfully wonderful man Lord all the days were already written in your book Dear God [Music] Lord Jesus I long let the Saints will leave here tonight with some spiritual in order that their comfort and their mainstream I realize they don't have to be guilty they don't have to be discouraged they don't have to be down they're downtrodden they don't have to be hopeless but they can have the hope of the Lord [Music] thank you for your goodness I want to thank you for calling each one of us I want to thank you for separating us the Lord God unto you Lord to glorify your holy name the Lord of this book opened up the gates of paradise and open up Gates of blessings a gate of spiritual blessings to the people and Lord please open the windows of Heaven as well for our blessings God that we can love you and serve you if you want to send us to the Amish community where you want everyone to send us from God open windows thank you for every spiritual gift I recognize that you preacher tonight it's been different than my thoughts I recognize the Holy Spirit [Music] thank you for the Divine commentary on our life Grace for God over the future Joy Hallelujah Victory that's right thank you thank you Lord Jesus Christ thank you for these spiritual
