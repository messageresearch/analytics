Lord resides the scriptures we could go to I think let's go are we start with Hebrews chapter 9 I just want to you just use an example one of the three divine perfection Testaments let's go to Hebrews chapter 9 Hebrews 9 24 by God's grace so in this portion of text we have three appearances of Christ which is very fitting of how Jesus has three comings so we see the three appearances here in the scripture so Hebrews 924 for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us we know he's appearing right now in heaven for us was 25 nor yet that he should offer himself often as a high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he have often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself so that birth so we can see who is the first the second and the presence of God for us verse 27 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but happen here's the final appearance so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation Amen some three appearances of Christ's earthly coming earthly appearance heavenly appearance and his third or second coming we'd say which is his third appearance by God's grace how many can see those three appearances renamed Amos as far as the word of Prayer and we'll have you be seated in a moment Heavenly Father we ask Lord you take this word that we read Lord bless it to our hearts Lord God father we know these numbers teach us about you reveal more of yourself to us tonight Lord show us your Divine patterns your divine perfection O God your divine ways Lord and we'll be happy we'll be grateful Lord as we sit on Sunday that our eyes Lord would be open to see more of your leadership in our lives so we thank you for your mercy or we get you all the glory on her praise in Jesus Christ's name the church said god bless you I should be in seated there let's look at biblical numerology part 2 and I know you'll be blessed by the grace of the Lord I just want to quickly review we looked at the meanings of numbers number one represents primacy or preeminence and unity number two has poor meanings division difference testimony and then friendship or unity and we started number three on Sunday and we'll finish that tonight and three means divine perfection will represents life we'll probably get to number four tonight hopefully I got a 111 slides right now on 175 so that's pretty good I think I maybe can get through almost tonight we'll see so I want to just start with the first one for our text tonight we looked at Christ's mission so Christ's mission was perfected with three appearances and that kind of talk to hi doing Jesus's 3 up convinced he came to redeem the bride rapture the bride he's coming that's the second one and then the third one to rule or reign with the bride so the 3 R's we can always remember the companies with Christ so this is interesting as we saw three appearances he hath appeared to take away sins on the cross he now appears and the Friends of God is mediator and he shall appear for those who are looking for I know you're looking for him tonight I'm looking for him tonight us so we see Christ's mission of his three appearances is perfect it's a perfect appearance now let's look at a few here you know I guess I guess what I'll do is I'll just got to go fastly through these you know you'll probably hopefully be able to nod it quite a bit and same into these if it's new to you maybe we'll go real like I know there's a few that might be new to you I mentioned one in the car about Isaac's Wells maybe we'll read that one I don't haven't preached that very much so they don't haven't preached that very much so that might be new to all of us here but anyways let's just let's look at this so three is divine perfection and let's look at Christ's earthly life with some of the threes in his life now again I'm just scratching the surface because there there's so much and to be honest I haven't I haven't typed in one two or three and the Bible and gone all the way through there because that would take hours and hours all I've done is I've read the five or six chapters in that book IEW Bolinger and then I pulled out all the types I'm sorry all the numbers I thought would fit plus with all the ones already made on an other list and I just kind of put them together that's that's what I've had time to do and so let's look at the threes in Christ's life now we know Christ had three poles right three stages of his ministry the first ministry was his healing ministry the second was his preaching or teaching which was a rejection a part of being rejected in his ministry or smaller ministry and the third part was his resurrected ministry he rose and then had three days I'm sorry forty days rather to preach and teach his disciples so in his earthly life he had three stages of his ministry and we see the same thing with brother Graham with the healing in his hand and discernment and then the opening of the word the third pole now there was three voices I'm not sure if you knew this that there was three but you probably know there was three heavenly voices about Jesus the first one was at his baptism then my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased that's the first one that was in Matthew 3:17 the second one is on Mount Transfiguration this is my beloved son son here he him and then the third one was right before his crucifixion let's read that let's go to John 12 28 because that's the one that were probably not the most familiar with John 12 28 right before his crucifixion God gave one more heavenly voice so his ministry was vindicated perfectly with three heavily voices amen now I like verse let's start in verse 26 if any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor oh my that's what we want God to honor Oh story's god now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I into this hour isn't it striking how the very cause of Jesus's life with very purpose of his life caused him trouble and sometimes we think you know we're outside of the will of God if you have trouble in our lives many times that the birth as well we have trouble because cause from which I came into the world so many times it was manifest God's purpose for our lives we'll have to make a decision in the midst of a trouble or trial or to make a decision then that decision will direct our entire lives so verse 28 father glorify thy then came there a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him okay now if you some kind of her 32 and if I 5e lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me this he said signifying the death he should die okay so we can see his baptism his adoption his crucifixion three heavenly voices to signify each stage of his life amen oh that's beautiful so in his earthly life we can see that now this one the next one will move on the next one in Jesus's beginning of his ministry he had to use it is written three times to overcome Satan to make him leave now remember why why we're going over these we're going over these so we'll get an idea about our life so at the end of this that that's one thing we can pray for if we feel like temptation is overcoming us there it's so hard we must remember if it took Jesus three times that makes a good leave it may it may take us three times as well we've got to resist whether it's the temptation to you know agreed to imitate or lust temptation or whatever a prior temptation whatever that is we've got at least rebuked it three times we got at least say it's written it's written it's written and God will help us so three times you have to say it's written to overcome the devil all right Jesus Christ raised three people from the dead so this was divine perfection of him as the life Giver amen he raised Geri's his daughter he remember he got you know he speaks everybody out of the house to remember that and then he brought in Peter James and John the second one was the widow's son on a funeral procession he stopped the procession and he raised that boy from the dead and the third one of course was Lazarus so we know he's the resurrection of life he proved it three times I am the resurrection and the life perfection okay now in Christ's mission he had three sons names he was son of man son of God son of David and these also directly connect to his three offices so as a son of man he was prophet as son of God he's high priest and as son of David he's king of the earth prophet priest King so the man RV son of God son of David praise the Lord so we see that his mission is perfected in those three offices with those three names praise God and then we already saw his three comings redeemed by the cross rapture his bride rule the Millennium okay this is one of them you may not have seen before this was new to me Jesus Christ had divine perfection as a shepherd there was three there was three parts to him being a shepherd that divinely perfected his role as shepherd the first one and this is I've looked all these up this is true the first one the Bible said the Good Shepherd gives his life for the Sheep so there's death so that's the first part of being a shepherd the first part was giving his life for the Sheep the second one the Bible call him the great Shepherd in resurrection so let's go to Hebrews 13 20 but see that one Hebrews 13 $20 if you want to read little sisters - I guess no 16 verse 13 2003 yes they were doing read em yeah now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant amen she's called Good Shepherd in his death he's called great Shepherd and resurrection who knows what he's called it a second coming he's one more Shepherd the chief Shepherd and that v8 about the last one I don't know been by the Holy Spirit truly inspired that man to write down all these all these beautiful numbers and then this proves he's the perfect Shepherd yeah he's good in death he's great Shepherd a resurrection and he's chief Shepherd when he returns so 1st Peter 4 5 Malachi can you read up course 1st Peter 4 5 money it's just a few pages after mr. the purse Peter 4 5 I'm sorry no I got it I must move down the wrong number dalek hypocrite it's gonna be pretty easy okay no numbers now first Peter five four four five forgive me okay so now why don't you just read three enforce verses 3 and 4 in Chapter five neither as being lords over God's heritage but being as samples to the flock it was the chief Shepherd shall appear you show see crowd floor that fades that away amen so he's chief Shepherd when he returns and he'll give you a crown of glory if you're faithful sheep how many one meeting my kids sitting I don't want to be a goat I don't want to be a Pharisee on your side you see I just want to be a sheep good if you are true sheep God will share his glory and give you a crown of light if when the chief Shepherd returned amen so that's that I was the one that was new to me he's perfected a shepherd in three names as a shepherd okay let's look at the crucifixion there was a there was five threes at least at the crucifixion Jesus was crucified at the third hour okay which would have been 9 a.m. that's when they began it darkness covered the earth for three hours so it was complete darkness was perfect darkness that was Matthew 27 45 a lot Jesus like Jonah had to endure his death for a portion of three days right crucified on Friday in the grave Saturday rows Sunday just like Jonah was in the belly three days jesus's perfection or life came on the third day that was in Luke 13 32 jesus said but on the third day I shall be perfected so divine perfection is three right he's divinely perfected with a divine perfect body on the third day and resurrection and there was three languages and scripted on the cross here is Jesus King of the Jews right last night Malcolm our nowcasting what was written on that inscription here is Jesus King of the Jews was that it I thought was so the three languages were Greek Hebrew and Latin so three languages so there's all these threes to show that Jesus Christ's crucifixion was done with divine perfection it was the perfect complete for crucifixion for our Lord and Savior okay now I'm gonna skip now to the Old Testament let's go back to the Old Testament and let's let's get how God did deal with the patriarchs and Israel in divine perfection so we'll start at the beginning why don't everybody turn to Genesis 26 17 why don't we just turn there just as 2617 this is when we haven't covered too much I know I may have preached on that maybe once or twice who knows where this runo's or this type sound what is the three typos anybody never have any idea and yes I think it types out the three works of grace that's what I think because on both your digging you know there's working involved you know you're trying to go deep down until you hit the water - you hit life so to me it looks like the three stages of grace I know for sure st. vacation program said the RAM said sanctification is labor he said you have to be a legalist he compared to the hot Sun he compared to Ruth working in the hot fields because it's a it's a dying it's a very difficult thing dying out so Genesis 26 17 many doing reading 17 and 18 in I departed and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerard and quote there and Isaac didn't think it again the walls of water which they had baked in the days of Abraham his father for this Philistines had stopped him after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had company so look what look what Isaac's doing he's going back to the faith of his father's and doesn't Malachi 4:5 and 6a the children are going back to the others animate that of others that's why I believe it types out the three works of grace because we're just going back to the same works as Paul Peter st. John we're believing that that's that's what we go back to the very same works of Our Fathers amen okay now I can read nineteen and twenty found their love springing water the herd maneuver our did strike with eyes at certain said the slaughterers ours they called the name of the law east set because they strove with him Henry twenty one twenty and they dig another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitting that and he removed from thence and dig another well and for that they that stroke not and he called the name of it Rijo buff and he said for now the LORD hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land amen so fruitfulness came on the third biggie right and we know we know only born-again believers can have the fruit of the Spirit all the other ones are impersonations era seasoned personated it everybody impersonated but Jesus Christ manifested all the fruits of the spirit because he was baptized with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost descended and remained on him so fruitfulness came on the third one in other words life came on the third one that's how that's why I believe that types out the three works of grace now I didn't have time I want to look up the names I preached those before I think I did not get a chance to look up the names I apologize for that okay so what was the person sitting on what was this a sickness okay okay there was some contention and then there was room for all of us well the RAM said when you go for all of us well ransom when you the Holy Ghost he puts you in a room and then you can use you for any gift you know I like that they meant him praise the Lord thanks man okay thanks for ending it buddy I appreciate it so the next one is when we're very familiar with you for God destroyed side gamora he's at three men not two not what he said three men down to Sodom and Gomorrah okay with two angels and God was the other one and of course we don't and they they preach repentance down inside we know that's a two-spirit through brother Graham's ministry coming to the bride and then Roberts going down to the world to try to get them to repent okay this is not about I forgot about this one Israel when they were in bondage in Egypt they were Moses said he said Pharaoh we need to go three days in the desert to worship our God so three days represent a complete separation so that was divine perfection in order to really feel like they were separate from Egypt it would have taken a three-day journey that's when I hadn't phoned up also the spies brought back three things it tends to find a pearl and grapes figs and pomegranates so it had a perk at divine there was a vine perfection God vindicated three different attested Testaments and that was a perfect testing that the the promised land was a good land amen now there's three phases of Israel's Redemption leaving Egypt then in the desert and then the promised land that's divine perfection there are three sections of the tabernacle outer court holy place holiest I don't know if you remember this but the Jordan River was divided three times miraculously Joshua divided it with the ark Elijah divided it and then Elijah divided it so it was divided three times I'm not sure with that type so that types out but it was divided three times I know Jordan types death so death was the feet of three times I guess and they represented Jesus's three raising people from the dead maybe that maybe that's a type I don't know if you remember this but there was a three-day search for Elijah and second names to 17 and after the three days they decided he had to eat been raptured so the three days to give him the testimony that he was raptured three days for them to believe it alright God still dealing with Israel all males had to attend three of the great feasts unleavened bread the feast of weeks and Tabernacles and that's in Deuteronomy 16 verse 16 now of course you know there was seven feasts but the Bible says God said there was three feasts so the other ones kind of work out come out of the three and they are unleavened bread had Passover first unleavened bread firstfruits and then you had the feast of weeks and then the Tabernacles had three feasts trumpets atonement Tabernacles so it's like three one three but God Himself said there was three feasts okay all right God's still dealing with Israel there's three kinds of sacrifices sin offering peace offering thank offering and that's a divine testament to a perfect sacrifice there's three kinds of laws in the Old Testament moral law civil law ceremonial law now we know the ceremonial laws are fulfilled but many of the moral laws and civil laws still pertain to us today Mike with Deuteronomy 22:5 and we could give more examples by God's grace okay three things there were three things in the Ark of the Covenant the manna the law and Aaron's rod that budded Aaron's right Jesus said the Old Testament had three divisions jesus said in Luke 24:44 the Bible said he started at the law and the prophets and the Psalms there's three divisions still tested that's divine perfection now God's divine perfect judgment against Babylon had three stages at many Tekel Paris so has those three words remember and then meant God had numbered his kingdom and finish it they are weighed in the balance and found one thing was a second and the third was that Kingdom is divided and given to the beats of persons so there was three stages or three parts of that divine judgment it was a perfect judgment upon Babylon amen okay now let's go to the New Testament there's God's dealing with the church Peter saw the sheet vision three times in Acts chapter 10 to confirm that the Gentiles were admitted into the faith and not only did it prove that but it also proved that we're allowed to eat bacon now I mean no program said the bacon and eggs some people might think well oh no that was that that vision of those animals was just to show that the Gentiles were going to be saved brother Graham said no he said Peter Graham said Peter was all self-styled I thought ah my diets too strict I could never eat that well then brother Graham said my wife made bacon and eggs and the vegetarian walked up and said brother Branham he said you can think a lot more of you before I heard that you ate bacon and eggs and brother Graham said don't you know it's all clean he said don't you know God made all clean because the Bible said every creature of God is to be accepted with Thanksgiving and the prayer and the Word of God will sanctify any food now we know science has proven yeah you know if you eat too many shrimp shrimp or bottom-feeders and they may have some no pigs we eat anything so you've got to be careful not to eat too much pork or too much shrimp or some of these foods you got to be careful not to go overboard on that would just be wisdom but as long as it's received with Thanksgiving and you pray over that food God promised to cleanse that they did win so just so you know he saw it three times God said rise kill eat no Lord rightly no look nicely another and then he sent him off to cornea and then he sent him off to Cornelius house divine perfection you have three witnesses okay there's a threefold nature of temptation that God always allows a way out of so God will give you a lot a way out of the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life he always promises the way out of all those three so in dealing with us that's a perfect way he'll give us a way out of all three of those temptations and now this three groups of believers all out in a Christian Abraham Isaac Jacob they never want anybody else there's always three Peter James John was this Elijah Jesus on Mount Transfiguration there's three there three back here Peter James John Shadrach Meshach and Abednego when Moses his arms were held up you had Moses Aaron and her so there's three groups there's groups of three all the time there's three steps to reconciliation with your brother right go to them privately take one person with you bring it before the church so in dealing with us God has a perfect way to wrestle us is those three steps Jesus asked three times Peter if you love me because Peter denied him three times so reconciliation also on this case had three steps to it so Jesus is he since Peter 2:9 three times Jesus humbled Peter and he asked him three times if he loved him now here's a revelation that brother Adam preached with the seed should not be heir with the shuk in 1965 where the RAM said there was three seeds of the women so just like there was three men that went down to Sodom and Gomorrah there was three seeds that were given to women the first one was Hagar remember Hagar and she brought forth seed by unbelief through polygamy with the bondwoman okay so she that seed came my unbelief through polygamy who knows the second one Sarah Sarah was not my unbelief Sarah was by faith in a promise but it was through a natural union with a free woman so not a mad woman so God's showing us how there's three seeds right there's three ways to receive see unbelief through polygamy with a slave the next one is by faith through a promise with a free woman so it gets a little better it was the last one closed Mary Mary so Mary received by promise word with no Union brother no teaches that and seed should not be here with a shuck so remember each scene gets better right Hagar unbelief say I promise but still through natural act now the last one marry by promise word no natural Union all by the Word of God amen I thought you like that by God's grace that's a good one okay I'm telling us that okay there's now there's divine perfection and salvation for mankind almost the four just say not what's the right Tony there's a lot of threes this says and there's probably tons more in Salvation God has three works of grace justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost such a new spirit and my spirits so there's three stages Ezekiel foretold the earth for foretold this stages pull up the flood the blood of Christ and the future fire to cleanse the earth and we already covered the three stages the promised land with Israel and the life of Abraham supports out of this as well the first stage was leaving home the second stage was all the steps in between are all the tests in between the third stage was the token of circumcision the token right the token is the baptism of Holy Ghost so Abraham's life was a perfect divine perfection example of the three works of grace and I believe Ruth was - if I'm not mistaken right Ruth deciding Ruth laboring Ruth rest and that's it yeah and then brother answer there's actually a fourth Ruth rewarded with the baby but the baby so that may go into the next number four maybe deliver it through my city we'll see so there's Ruth there as well assigning baby bring resting okay there's three stages for the rapture shall boys trunk there's three gifts for believers Faith Hope charity with the greatest being charity well the RAM said the bride was restored in three stages Luther Wesley Branham the bride restored in three stages and there's three divine witnesses for the vine perfection in prayer and this is a good one we can apply to our lives as well Jesus played prayed three times for what you guys remember and the gardening is seventy paid three prayed three times to let the cup pass she didn't pray once you didn't praise he played three times because it was a divine perfect witness of Prayer and I think that will help us in our lives if we don't hear back from God on this request maybe we should ask again and maybe ask again keep asking and then remember Paul asked three times for the buffeting demon the messenger from Satan to leave him and finally God answered on the third time and said my grace is sufficient for you and weakness and this was done to keep you humble okay so those are all the many many slides and the threes now Satan imitate threes right I found I found at least three in the scripture I'm sorry least for the woman who put three measures of meal and leaven the love the love which the Bible says eleven is sin that was the Roman Catholic Church putting in maybe the Father Son Holy Ghost or one of those threefold blasphemies the three unclean spirits of frogs that could have been one of those also the beast in Revelation 13 blasphemes the God three times blackstein's his name I changed at the Father Son Holy Ghost Tabernacle by saying Rome is eternal city and third he blasphemes up in Hemet church ages the spirit of organization has three stages the deeds and doctrines of the Nicolaitans the doctrine of balaam and then Jezebel religion there's three stages of the organizational spirit and this is a new one I've never seen before but in Jude there's only one chapter Jude that there's three examples of apostasy the way of Cain which he just got upset right he just got upset and he don't want to Humble himself and worship like his brother there's the heir of Balaam for money that was money and the gainsaying of korah was for power see what he said oh we're all holy like you Moses and Aaron we're all holy it was surely a we can all sacrifice a new incense and new the things you do but that was complete apostasy that was a divine witness of complete apostasy so not worshiping your worship money and then popularity okay all right deep breath in every ready are we ready for number four how am i doing on time okay let me set my timer we'll go 30 more minutes by God's grace appreciate ready bearing with me here tonight sold it maybe I should like walk but then they can't see me well may I can see me yeah she move around already can see me gotta keep like a regular service you know kinda get the blood moving okay for I've found that for has at least three meanings I was looking for a fourth it means deliverance brother Graham said road ramp said it means double confirmation and then the Prophet said it means earthly number it's a number that applies to the earth so I'm sure you've got everything of some like nor saw these with we'll get to that so let's start with double confirmation I can only find one that was a double confirmation but you know there could be more the Prophet said yes to is a confirmation but for is a double confirmation so for is a double confirmation so a double proof a double vindication that God is doing something so the only one I could find that was a double confirmation was there's four elements to God's love breath length depth and height I'm sorry there's go me or me criticize my watch so God's love has four parts to it it means a double confirmation God loves us so much he loves us so much he gave us four measurements to it and we preach on that last you remember the four parts we looked at how high is his love he separates our sins as far as the East is from the West how deep is love I can't remember the other one but there was four priests in last year so God gives us a double confirmation there are four elements to his love and so deep there's four okay the next is the earthly number brother Graham says Austin is that church tonight and I guess you guys didn't have service tonight ah like a debt you're the e-text in and jump that flooded and I didn't know you wanted to come tell him I'm very sorry just like a demo just like the devil my goodness I was wondering why that happened why didn't that water break and that pipe drink of all times that's okay I'm sorry damn it okay so the problem talks about the four beasts the four living creatures and he talks about the four Gospels four is an earthly number so let's go for let's go through some earthy numbers for the forest on the fourth day of creation should open up before put it before on the fourth day mare we went through day one day two day three on day four the earthly and heavenly material was finished day four was the Sun the Moon the Stars so see on day four is force our earthly number all the earth materials are finished because on five six five and six you have all the animals and humans on day five and six but all the earthy materials and all the heavenly materials finished on day four is four is our earth day number okay there's four Great elements according to II W bullen's right and I didn't know this but there's earth on the dirt air water fire so that's what he says how many directions are there children or saw these fights there's four directions did you know there's or divisions of the day the Bible says this in mark 13:35 let's read that mark 13:35 you can tell he tossed him to come over the house you could you tell me I don't know if you will be good invited you okay so there's four parts of the day this is in mark 13:35 five sorry he said watch you therefore for you know that when the master of the house cometh at even or midnight or the crowing or the morning so crowing has to be 6 a.m. right that's what they chicken roosters crow morning lists must be 9:00 a.m. even I must be 9:00 p.m. moment [Music] whatever I must have that wrong yeah it's freaking out to rework that one I don't remember that one but Jesus says there's four parts of the day so forgive me I'd have to rework them I thought I had it been in them that's not right well I know this there's more night watches so that's mark Matthew 1425 my marina I'm Matthew 14 25 I know this one for sure and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went on to them walking on the sea so that would have been the 6:00 6:00 a.m. I'm not mistaken so 6:00 p.m. number three hours right 6 p.m. 9 p.m. midnight and 3:00 in what century yeah we had because six day it would have been the beginning of the morning and then the first 20 more okay so 3 a.m. in the morning they're still sailing on the sea and here comes Jesus so night is divided in four parts just like day is divided in four parts as well course yeah I'd be great I'll be great if we could see Austin in half an hour that'd be awesome praise the Lord oh you met Austin okay he came to our church from out of the years was about a year and we baptized and then Lord Jesus and then guessing short lives and fell away and I wants to come back so and these girls have been trained calling out his name every single sort of Oh beautiful most glorious that thank you very much no the author said that the moon has four phases in that room have you heard of that I'm I can't remember I know there's waxing and waning and pressing I can't recall them but I think if Jeff slip it up but he says the moon has four phases and we know how many seasons are there or seasons there's four seasons so four is always an earthly numbers make sure okay so four is the four seasons all right now four deals with your earthly or the earthly relationships with God as well as the earthly number how do we know how many grounds there are that Jesus said the heart the word follows line all kinds the wayside where there is a sight Stoney's a second thorny right choking no care cares the world choke the Word of God and the fourth is good ground good ground so there's four there's in other words there's for earthly conditions your heart can be according to Jesus and there's four kinds of vessels so everybody is one of these kinds of essence here they're a gold vessel silver wood or earth like a dirt vessel well the RAM said there was for cross as a Calvary Jesus Saves thief the lost leaf and Judas or costs revelation 20:2 11 says there's four conditions you'll be in at the rapture holy or righteous filthy or unjust those are four conditions on the earth everyone will be in just like those four conditions of the heart of the four types of ground and then remember there's four cherubims that guard the mercy seat but those anointings were sent down to earth lion ox man flying eagle or those pointing those four beasts represent before anointings that come down here to the earth and we know also God gave us four Gospels on the earth Matthew Mark Luke and John amen now the last one is earthly prayer has four parts to it right prty prays repent asking you just like in the Old Testament the incense had four parts to it I can't pronounce the first three but I know frankincense is the last one I can't pronounce them because difficult words I've never even read them before or been able to pronounce and so earthly prayer has four parts to it just like incense has four ingredients we're almost done actually my god Zuri so what the beater will be her linearized grace emotions they say did he say he would come producible ready men I was drawing very answered amen oh yeah some Devils I gotta get these Devils not gonna get the victory right even though the church but Eviscerator going on Church is still going on the single not gonna thank you the program tells us and the last one is deliverance for represents deliverance and this is in Revelation chapter 4 part 3 in 1961 he said see deliverance there was three Hebrew children a fiery furnace but the fourth one come it was deliverance Lazarus was in the grade three days when the fourth one come he was delivered or is God's number of deliverance okay now I thought this one might work here I hope this works did you know you have four stages to your full manifestation to your fully delivered your first stage was a thought in the mind of God the second stage you became flesh that's where we're at right now if you die before the rapture the third stage as you go to theophany right your last stage is a glorified body so see your deliverer you're fully delivered going through these four stages to flash the opportunity glorified program said the peasant Jesus was different Jesus went from thought to logos which was that light the pillar fire then he came to flesh and any course he went back to theater of the logos to preach the spirits in prison but then when he resurrected he got the glorified body so he had through four different parts to his full manifestation really delivered fully fully manifest see all right let's wear this one sort of Romans chapter 5 let's read this you're my Luger yes we have time Romans five verse three and this is you know this is a good scripture for everyone but especially those who may bound depression or or suicidal thoughts you know I've talked to numerous people that battle those types of things and the trouble is ultimately they give up hope and I was thinking I was meditating on this one day and the thought just came - no I felt it was from the Lord you know suicide is is the net the actual event you know it's sinful of course but it's actually a perversion of what we're supposed to do everyday right we're supposed to die to ourself all said I die daily so see Satan has perverted that and he wants to us to end our natural life but God doesn't want us to end our natural life God wants to end help us and our will everyday the will for our earthly life God wants the God wants us to slay that because the Bible said we were slaughtered all the day long so not just do we die once I'm sure you know brother we got to die all the time you know we'll be going good for a while and then it worked we got a dino ourselves there and we get hold of you got to die to ourselves at home to keep overcoming that devil keep crucifying the lust of the flesh but this scripture says there's four phases to actually achieving true spiritual hope from God so the hair do we read verses 3 and 4 and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope amen now have you read verse 19 I'll try gonna are you and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us amen now this is something that we I hope we can all see in our lives if we're in the midst of tribulation we have to remember oh this is just the first stage there's better stages after this I'm really going through a hard time this is really difficult seems really trying to defeat me we must remember if we can just make it through that stage God will give us patience we can't give up on them in the midst of the hardest battle I want to end my life or I just want to quit being a Christian I'll quit going to church at all we just got to keep pressing through there and go the next step was oh and I got patience now I can wait on God then if you if you can if you can gain patience then God will give you an experience right and then if you can receive God's experiments experience then you are delivered now you have hope you haven't lost hope you haven't lost a desire to live you have a loss of desire to serve Lord God has through four stages he's giving you a supernatural hope by God's grace amen that's a great deliverance that we all can benefit from praise the Lord isn't that beautiful so hope that's an encouragement tonight I have a couple more things singing imitates number four now I'm not knowing number four I only got like halfway done with the chapter I'm already to that chapter yet there were other chapters before that Saint imitates pours because we all know how many horse riders are they white is the section where the air near these Rover red was bloody red black was capturing the wealth of the world in the Dark Ages and then pale with a spiritual death all those three combined into the fourth and let's go to James chapter one there's four stages temptation James chapter one and church this is to me this is why the seals are so powerful because it doesn't really matter you know that people can memorize the four horses that's good to know that but we have to recognize how those horses want to ride in our lives today and that is the true power of the Holy Spirit and the seal is being loose now you can recognize Satan and now you can overcome Satan that every one of his tricks because he's trying to ride into your life in the form of these horses okay so James chapter one and I believe it's verse thirteen so there's four stages to temptation verse 13 let no man say when he is tempted I'm tempted of a God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man here it is verse 14 but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed so the first stage is enticed right and we all know what that's like oh I feel that temptation I'm starting to feel it some days you can walk right past it no it don't even faze you right there's certain thing like I was telling you different addictions I've had some days I can just walk right past it when we're gonna battle and we're gonna feed Tyson that actually would feel pretty good or that actually would sound pretty good or that might that might taste pretty good or whatever whatever the look let's have patience so enticing is the first step Malka verse fifteen minute this Jude was our James 150 then when lust hath conceived reinforce in and said okay so lust I'm sorry so enticement lust enticed and then C so seized is when it's got you so that's when you've given over in your mind see you know we can have feelings like all that might feel pretty good but once we decide it now now sin has seized you right that spirit you let that spirit in okay but then that like with David that still doesn't mean you've actually committed the sin right let's let's think of David when he took Bathsheba he was enticed by looking out right watching her watching her baby he was seized we said go get Bathsheba he was seized but he was gonna act upon but he had done to act yet when he did the act now he'd sinned and then what happened death of that child that came out of that okay I guess you're right - okay so can every see the four steps of temptation that's the power of the seven seals that's why all haven't shouted that he meant because now you and I can recognize oh I'm being enticed you gotta cast that down or its season you okay I've really got a cast that down because I feel like I'm gonna do it or if I've actually sinned I've got it I got to confess and say I'm wrong or if its death course you can't go past spiritual death you know because I would mean your spiritual death that would mean you cross the line between mercy and judgment so Christian we never go there but that's the power of the seals is that you can see the enticing the seizing I'm going to do it the actual act and then death something awful happens at the end okay now let's close with this how many can see how these numbers apply to your life especially prayer like we got to have a complete prayer again we just don't want to just praise praise praise you also repent you can praise all day if we're not forgiven and we have we have something that will hinder our walk with God so prayer so we want we want to remember we can clearly apply this to our life make sure prayer has these four steps also pray three times or pray multiple times how many times we pray about Austin way more than right with that that encourages us let's have some repetition let's bring that before God let's keep the faith remember because Jesus said the woman who really believes is gonna keep that come right she keep knocking until the unjust judge gives her what she has Nita all right the worship the holy holy holy so that can encourage us worship say Amen again say praise the Lord again when we're in Jeffersonville for the air and we walk out of different places he say let's say [Music] and he said let's say it again praise the Lord there's repetition repetition is something God loves holy holy holy you know all this all this worship he loves it he loves repetition of prayers now we got to make sure we balance that right because Jesus said they just repeat yourself just to be heard or just to make your hair longer than somebody else God doesn't hear that but it's when you come sincerely Lord can you take this burden off me Lord can you help me overcome this temptation can you take this on me when you do it like that God receives it alright also you should see your face should rise when you see God working in an orderly way like if you're in justification at all I'm saying praise I know where I'm going right our face your eyes okay now I know what I need to do I need to get sanctified and then all I'm saying goodbye I know I know what's next the baptism of Holy Ghost so it should encourage our faith day God and taking on a journey on Sunday I'm on a journey and my ramps on the church age book we can always know wherever we are in the journey at anytime right we're right we can look at those three stages we can look at the Statue program and we can see where we are at any time so these numbers are very crucial because they give us God's plans that give us God's wrong maps okay I want to see if there's a couple more scriptures also here's one let's go to Psalm 143 then maybe we'll sing hymn praying to our brother good serving that'd be great if he walks in and we're singing or she's in the Lord he's a tender heart of man you know he's young guy thing is what 2021 no bombs 143 verse 5 and this again goes with numbers and God's earth his creation they are doing to read verse 5 143 verse 9 I remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works I'm use on the works the work of by hands Amen muse you remember means to meditate Condor or study so you look at God's works you look at the four directions you know you look at all these all the fours you know we didn't get to it but there's four corners of the earth there's four win Wow nature has length you know nature has length width height and all these all these numbers God's love has four elements to it we're supposed to meditate on these and then if we do that let you can read verse six we'll do this hey men when you see God's order when you see oh there's four kinds of grounds I'm one of those which one am I Lord let me have a good ground our hands go up yes Lord give me a Jesus that it's a good honest heart where there's no cares of the world I'm not after money or or popularity or evil relationships I'm not after any of that my heart is pure and when we meditate on these things and we can see the poor ground so we can see all these things it makes us worship God say holy holy holy Lord all my praise the Lord well I think I'll stop there there's some other ones I want to get to you but let's stand our feet here I just have a word of Prayer maybe you give us commands here through this to the lesson tonight I hope the live streamers everybody can remember these numbers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

saw live streams let me make clothes here god bless everybody we're just going to close with a word of Prayer we appreciate everybody's attention and listening to the Word of God and again we're sorry that the church got flooded but God knew that was going to happen and we're so thankful Austin and his grandmother father thank you love you for all of your goodness [Music] [Music] over Jesus [Music]
