TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the Lord God bless the live streamers and trust you'll be blessed here by the word of God here tonight we like to look at uh controlling our emotions tonight by God's grace and looking at the emotions of Jesus Christ also I might even say uh being Christlike in our emotions so we want look at that uh just cuz I you know I'll share a little bit about it but I kind of had to deal with that this week here um and I just thought well I like when I like I like to feel when something's inspired to me like I feel like it comes from from God or something like that uh and I realized well I wasn't planning on this and I feel all these thoughts are coming to me that's normally how it happens with me I'll get one thought and then all these other thoughts will start flooding in and I just try to write them down as fast as I can you know as soon as I can write them out I just try to get them down as soon as possible and ask the Holy Spirit uh to reveal it to you and me and it would make sense it be a blessing to us by God's grace so uh Proverbs 25:28 why don't we just read that one here together and then we'll have you be seated here I want to watch the time again we have probably have school tomorrow I'm not expecting everybody not expecting them to call off two days in a row so we just want to enjoy that's our one snow day we probably that's all probably all we'll have so we want to be thankful for that and also watch the time as well by God's grace so let's read that if we can on three 1 2 3 he that have no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and Without Walls amen may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you can be seated here we like to look at controlling our emotions and of course with the subtopic of looking at Jesus's emotions um that he uh he had to keep in check uh by the grace of the Lord so um I kind of you know share my my inspiration you know I I was preaching on Sunday and what a wonderful service that was in the morning and of course I enjoyed the evening too but um Now read that scripture in Romans where it says he came in the likeness of sinful flesh and so that just struck me just kind of those words kind of jumped off you know uh the pages to me as I was preaching that I didn't quite know what to say and so I just was meditating on that on Monday the likeness of sinful flesh but the Bible said he was the word made flesh so his his nature was to obey the word of God I I do not believe Jesus had a sinful nature but of course his body was under the curse of sin whereas uh he would he could die of course um but I believe that's what that scripture was speaking of there uh in the likeness of sinful flesh and the Bible said he had no beauty that we would desire him you know he might have been a beautiful baby like we just come through Christmas right and all these videos and everything they're like w he's such a beautiful baby and that might have been lots of Bab babies are beautiful don't you think moms and dads there's only one Dad here and one mom here but you know siblings you know uh every baby's beautiful I believe because God formed them uh in the womb uh God knit them together Hallelujah but that struck me you know the likess of sinful flesh when when when they would look at him uh they wouldn't see uh some someone beautiful or handsome you know they just saw a galileon they just saw a a a Nazareth You Know a Man from Nazareth Jesus of Nazareth they just saw a regular man no beauty that we would desire here I was even reading this week how you know Absalon remember the Bible said Absalon David's son was the most beautiful man the Bible said there was no blemish in him remember his hair was so long he could cut it off every year and I forget how many pounds it was but remember that beauty became a snare to him remember that became a snare and then he stole the hearts uh of the people he said the people would come for questions and maybe David you know they did it so beautifully on the Sight and Sound you know David couldn't answer all the questions and so he'd say oh that somebody was here right at the gates that could answer your questions oh I just wish somebody was here and they're like well maybe you can do it Absalon you're the King's son well maybe I can I'm here and no doubt he looked handsome you know he must had the oil all rubbed over him you know looking fresh and clean in the morning his hair was just amazing you that amazing hair had but through that beauty and through his uh know deceit he stole the hearts of the people and eventually of course you know he took over the throne for a short period and of course partly that happened because of David's own sin as we saw on Sunday he was out of position at the wrong time he chose the wrong time in season to take off that's why I think the Bible tells us be instant in season and not of season praise God hallelujah you know recognize you know whether we feel like it or not can I say like that whether we feel like it or not let's obey the word of God let's do what God called us to do praise God hallelujah other words let's not like the Bible said let's not make provision for our flesh to sin so if you're in a season of rest or thank God for that if you're a season of fewer battles let's thank God for that but let's not make a provision for the flesh right David made in that case he made provision for the flesh the Bible said he despised the Commandment of God so he he looked at the woman there basba and he thought about the word of God he despised that and he made provision remember he went through all those steps to sin may God help us before we make plans to sin may God help us in in the in the steps of that those plans may God help us to convict us may something happen right May something somebody get sick or may uh something happen where it would it would cause us to forget about the sin and we'd obey the word of God Amen how many want that by God's grace amen that's what I want you know before uh I I would sin and before I would I would make provision for our flesh because we know Paul did it he did things he hated uh Peter did it he did things that he he uh regretted but that God would intervene like a you know like aimc he said Lord you know the Integrity of my heart I don't want to sin against you that's what we want to have we want to have integrity that we would not sin against God hallelujah amen and and uh and so you know abson did that and I just you know I was just reading this weekend and remember when he died his hair got caught in the tree his his beauty is what got him trapped the natural thing he he must have spent all this time on his natural beauty right he spent all this time on and the very thing he he thought was his his glory is what got him trapped and then of course you know they they ended his life I thought interesting and then the Bible said in Ezekiel 28 that that Satan was the full sum of beauty right but that because of his Beauty because of his wisdom that's what brought about the unbelief in his life Hallelujah so I just thought was interesting there that you know it was such a snare Hallelujah and may God help us to to stay out of all the snares that the enemy lays Amen in this case you know the snares are emotions sometimes the emotions get to uh get the best of us we'll say it like that okay so I just want to look at that tonight you know as I was uh that's one of the things you know the lightness of sinful flesh I was looking at uh uh Absalon the other thing you know somebody you know one of the accusers on YouTube now so far he's been a nice guy but looked at me and or I'm sorry he wrote me uh things and said uh some of my comments don't see seem so Christlike I thought huh am I like Christ online I want to be like Christ in my house I want to be like Christ at the church I also want to be like Christ online right right and so I prayed I wait on it I wrote him back I told him I think I was because I had scripture for it Hallelujah and so but that really made me examine myself I think that was just yesterday you know his comment just like stuck with me for a whole day like am I Christlike am I Christlike so I started searching my heart and he said uh are you bitter are you getting your emotions getting the best of you I thought am I are my emotions getting the best of me and I I admit you know sometimes uh my emotions do get the best of me that's why I said on Sunday I want to be careful how much I preach against the trolls because it just affects you when people call you liar or they call you uh uh different names it affects you you know whether it's in word or whether it's to your face or whether you hear about it secondhand or gossip about you uh you know the these things affect you right and so I I could tell my emotions were affected and I thought because I was accused of being not Christlike well I want to be like Christ how many want to be like Jesus amen hallelujah and uh you know and then and then this thought you know I thought of this sermon the brother brother preached 10 years ago about the emotions of Christ and Simon mentioned it too I heard Simon preach at his home church and he he brought this sermon from 10 years ago I'm like wow if that stayed on Simon's heart from 10 years ago must be a pretty good sermon how many sermons can you reply or recall from 2014 and I'm like wow Simon I didn't I remember the sermon but I didn't know what year was so I went listening to it today I was thoroughly blessed but then that reminded me I've always want to preach this sermon I just want to go through Matthew all the way through John you know Lord winning once I get these Paul sermons done if the Lord terries if I can get through Paul's Epistles maybe if I can just get through Romans maybe I'll jump to Matthew and start preaching through the but I would just love to preach our series on the life of Jesus Christ what I mean doesn't that sound Heavenly he's the Heavenly Son of God hallelujah he's God in flesh Hallelujah he's The Treasure of Heaven I like that song the darling of Heaven he's amen he's the king of Heaven the king of Glory Hallelujah and he come down to earth in flesh to help us out praise God Amen not just help us out save our souls Way Beyond that hallelujah amen and then now he can be the high priest who makes intercession for us now he can understand what you and I go through huj we have somebody who who can be a secure the Bible says a helper we have somebody who can help us who knows what we've gone through there as a man I can say well sisters don't understand this and as a woman wom say well brother Jesse don't understand that that might be true I but the Bible said Jesus was tempted in all points like as we are so whatever issue you're struggling with it goes back to just being tempted by sin right it's one of those three areas the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes P life it's one of those right and the Bible said he was tempted in all let's all say all can we all all points yet without sin so we can look to Jesus and we can find help to control our emotions praise God and we can do our best to be Christ like with our emotions amen hallelujah amen uh Psalm 51:10 David writes this after the S basba created me a clean heart that's why I love what the Bible said the Bible said be a new creation well it's not just one time I'm a new creation amen it's anytime I fall short and want to get right with God creating me a clean heart oh God Amen create that in me in other words I'll let you work in my emotions and you'll renew a right Spirit Within Me amen because we can all remember I used to have a right Spirit but something vexed my spirit right sister Zer was texting about that that was a great text there sister Z that really helped me you know we're trying to serve God but then these Devils come many times through other people to Vex us right remember that I just saw that this week uh uh Israel Vex Moses and that's when he smoked The Rock he let the people Vex him right uh other other Saints down through the Bible uh they got vexed by other people now it was lot's fault all the all the homosexuals vexed lot that was lot's fault right he didn't have to live there a church we don't have to put up with some things Hallelujah we got to make sure we don't allow sin to Vex us in our hearts and lives and even Moses he didn't have to let the people Vex him nobody can Vex US unless we let it right right so the fact that I've you know mentioned trolls and that over the months and maybe years uh is sometimes it's obvious that it's it's getting to me and I can't let it get to me I got to have the control of the Holy Spirit I do believe that times God wants me to warn those people no doubt about that the Bible says warn all men right amen and I had even had one guy uh email me today he said you know your your ministry there is one of the main Ministries for defending the message he said people around the world look to you well I knew that but it was just interesting to hear from somebody else so I was like wow this guy's against me so uh I see if God's using me that way then especially I want to have a Christlike Spirit right if God's called me to do this and also uh Shepherd the Saints at the same time then I always want to have the Christlike spirit I always want to say create in me a clean heart not I don't want a dirty heart Cu uh I'll do that sometimes right I'm a sinner saved by grace I'll I'll let my heart become dirty right we let our Minds become dirty no matter what the sin is church understand what I'm saying but God promised he can create a new one praise God and he can bring back that former uh spirit that that that former cleanness that we used to have he can make it new for us hallelujah am he can bring it back again hallelujah amen amen and if God could do it for David under the blood of B and ghost surely he can do a great thing under the blood of Jesus Christ and so it goes back to this verse as I as we open up with you and I have to rule over our Spirits I think it's good from time to time I just felt led like this was what the Holy Spirit wanted me to deal with because it's something in my own life I want to make sure I always rule over my emotions right uh if not I'm I'm like a a wall a walless city I have no defense and then anybody can attack and anybody can hurt me if I don't keep my emotions in check isn't that true parents you don't have to say Amen but even your children can hurt you if you don't have your emotions in yes right in other words like let's say Zion or Jen spill something and I get mad why I've Lo I've now they can hurt me right they're they're but I shouldn't get mad what's wrong with me something's wrong with me it's just a little spill clean it up brother Jess don't get mad right don't don't yell at the child don't you know what I mean like that's what I'm saying like if we don't keep our defenses up if we don't keep our protection up if we don't keep uh control of our our El like we ought to then we can be hurt by any little thing that anything's offensive that that we're so sensitive Everybody Hurts us but really we should love even those who hurt us praise God Amen right in some sense we should be so lovable right that that that nobody can hurt us for some for some period of time is what I'm saying right that has to be the case how else then can we love our enemies mhm and bless those who curse us I've been called everything you want on I've been called Judas I've been called Satan I've been called el iot all that right but I know it's not true because I see Jesus in my life amen amen that live the life but how do these things you know uh how do we not be sensitive to it we got to set up the walls of the word of God the Bible say the walls are salvation I always like Chris Thomas song on that your walls are salvation your gates are praise amen and that's in the Bible hallelujah amen amen so we got to remember God's delivered me uh he saved me and that's the walls of Salvation I'm saved I'm delivered amen I'm controlling my emotions hallelujah amen and if my walls are down then I know God can create in me a clean heart God can create in me walls again he can restore the walls amen amen so I'm defended by the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen amen amen I thought about this Church there's a time um you know I've been criticized people say oh uh you don't have to defend the message the message defends itself well there's actually a you know there's a scripture for it Paul said I'm in defense of the Gospel right and not only that you have the Old Testament type once Israel got in the land you know fight fight fight fight fight but after that they had to defend defend defend defend remember when brother Jim was here what he preached on hither to God what was the the text Invaders were coming in it was defense time because the enemy comes in like a he comes in got to defend your ground amen amen hallelujah see there's times you're breaking through right brother amen we're breaking through the Enemy Lines and just trying to possess whatever attribute we desire maybe it's Joy maybe getting our joy back right amen maybe you could say I got my joy back brother jesser or brother Malachi I got my I got my peace back well then the enemy is going to come try to come in and take that now you got to defend that peace come on somebody amen you got to defend that Joy amen amen amen you got to defend that uh uh love of the Lord you know your your patience and your longsuffering and your uh your emotions you got to defend that because you fought it right you fought for it you've achieved your God's let you achieve it God's rewarded you that's what that's what David said God has rewarded me for my righteousness David said that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen so I just I was meditating on that this this or today I'm like that's exactly right once Israel got in the land now they got to defend it Hallelujah once you get the blessing now you got to defend it praise God well that's that's how your healing can be you can get healed but then the devil try to bring sickness what you got to do you got to fend off the lies amen you got to fight off the lies of the Enemy No I am healed I am saved Hallelujah I do have peace I do have Victory amen hallelujah amen I Am A Friend Of God am amen he calls me friend Hallelujah in the word of God hallelujah I received Jesus because I received those who preached about Jesus to me just like Jesus said hallelujah amen so if I receive the preachers that preach about Jesus then I receive Jesus I'm a friend of God hallelujah amen amen amen amen now it was interesting I went online and I just found the first the first article how many emotions are there now this article said in Aristotle's time he was a famous philosopher you ever heard of Aristotle he is a smart fell he said there's 14 emotions let me read them real quick fear confidence anger friendship calm emnity that's hatred shame shamelessness pity kindness Envy indignation emulation contempt then in the 1900s a man named Robert uh plut chick he uh narrowed it down to eight Joy sadness trust disgust fear anger surprise and anticipation and then another University I for I I didn't write it down there but the un uh University studied it again and they brought it down to just four now I like four remember when I preach on the numerology series who know remember what four had had a couple meanings it represented Deliverance but it also represented an Earthly number so I think the Earthly number works there we we experienced four types of emotions now I could be wrong I just thought was interesting now what made me laugh was I thought about how many emojis are there for emotions there's like 60 just for happiness you know like one's like I should the Emojis one's like one's real big smile eyes open eyes closed you know that's all expressing these emotions but this University bowed down to Four Happiness sadness anger and fear I thought that's pretty good that's sounds like about right Beyond this they said it's more there's just complex variations of those four so I thought you know just thinking about just for us it'd be a lot easier if we can just narrow down what are we feeling to one of those four so let me read them again happiness sadness there's opposite right happy sad anger and fear anger fear okay now uh remember uh if you would honey pull up Colossians 3 ver1 and the brother on Sunday night preached a good message on loneliness I'm probably going to preach on that my own kind of customized sermon of that the only way I can preach it was a nice good message on loneliness and he basically brought it down to you have to spend time with God and then you'll never be lonely amen and he used these words he says imagine we get to fellowship with the greatest person in the entire universe amen how can I be lonely amen that's basically what I was like I went up for prayer I did amen I went up for prayer and then brother Ray text me he said you know he was sitting right in front of me and he said uh when I saw you up for prayer I was just going to turn around and tell you I think the Lord wants you to go up for prayer so I it was just you know how Ray is he's real spiritual I love Brother Ray oh yeah he sends his greetings too by God's face he told me a good testimony apparently there's been some healings that God is using to me he asked me to share that testimony with you so that was really good Colossians 3 vers one so we have these four emotions right apparently there could be 20 I'm not going against Aristotle I'm just saying it it simplifies it for you and I to stay full okay if you be risen with Christ I preached on this a couple years ago seek those things which are above where Christ Seth on the right hand of God is it verse two set your affections on things above yes set your affection so your affection is your love right so set your emotions on things above not on things Earth so it has to be set like you set your thermometer this last night how many said it last night right oh you didn't turn it off you said it why' you said it because you want to make sure you were the right condition right how many know we got to set our emotions on Christ amen amen if we want to enjoy the right atmosphere right amen hallelujah me just you got to set it on Christ how we do that through talking to Christ prayer repentance right worshiping the Lord giving God glory amen you have to we have to set our emotions on Christ I love this one too um 1 Chronicles uh 29 just go to verse three though this has always been uh I preached this years ago I just when I started reading on David and man I I just found such I found such com comaraderie with David I felt like he's like me or I'm like I I'm like him I see the same thing with Paul and Hezekiah those are three guys I see a lot of myself in them 1 Chronicles 29:3 moreover because I have set my affection House of God I have my own proper good of gold and silver which I've given in the house of my God over and above all that I prepare for the holy house just leave that up there for a moment so David's going off the scene right but he says uh he says I want to he said God should be in a house and Nathan says do all that's in your heart and then God told Nathan nope he's not going to build the house go tell David he won't build the house his son after him will build the house right and we learn that God doesn't tell us prophets everything right Hallelujah so he goes back and he tells him these things and then David said you know I he said now I'm going to I'm going to store up all this gold and silver Timber Cedar I'm going to store all this up because I've set my affection on the house of God Amen now this is why I've always thought church is the highlight of my week coming and worshiping with you praising God even before some of you were here by God's grace which is all good you know we all come at different times but even before you're here worshiping God has always been our pleasure Hallelujah amen very few things in life I'm not sure if there's any that would be more wonderful than Church it should always be uh the Highlight the Bible says he's a man after God's Own Heart so of course he want to go to God's house Hallelujah that's that's what he's known for he's known for being a man after the heart of God and was it Psalm 27 uh that says one thing I desire the Lord I think we saying that better as one day of your courts right we sing that at uh recently at a sermon can you pull that up there Psalm 27 one thing I desire so here's a man his heart is after God he loves going to God's house and so he he set he sets his love on the house of God yeah verse four one thing I desire of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire of his Temple the same man said created in me a clean heart amen and renew a steadfast Spirit Within Me praise God the same man after his baby boy died he went to the house of God and worship God in his darkest of moments he found peace and victory he found renewal in the house of God hallelujah amen may that be the same for us in our Darkest Hours no matter what light whatever whatever God allows light to bring upon us may we be able to come to the house of God and express our emotion our love for God hallelujah amen in our darkest moments but they got to be set our motions have to be directed toward God Amen like you set your thermostat or you set your timer or your alarm clock we must uh Focus all our emotions on God that's why I've always condemned you know people going to sports games and shouting louder at sports games than they do for God I won't be guilty of that Hallelujah I I was guilty of it before but I've learned better now praise God amen amen or no matter uh you shout uh uh uh you know whatever whatever the purpose may be I got a sale at Macy's or there's a sale at woo I got a buy one get one free at at Arby's woo the coupon come in the mail or woo I got 5,000 off on a new car you know whatever emotion it may be it cannot it come to comparable it cannot be anything close to the emotion of worshiping God and loving God hallelujah amen and giving him glory for what he's done for us praise God Amen to know that all things work together for good to them that love the Lord amen to them that are called according to his purpose praise God Amen to know that there's no condemnation to those of us that are in Christ Jesus amen am that ought to make the emotions really excited hallelujah amen there's no damnatory sentence on my life praise God Amen so I'm setting my emotions on the things of God Amen Hallelujah now uh dealing with this you know I I just want to De deal with this a little bit you know uh I was accused of maybe being too harsh and so I searched my heart you know and I thought well Lord was I too harsh and uh so I just prayed about it and let's go to Mark 3:5 Mark 3:5 but here's an example where Jesus experiences the the emotion of anger now how many think it was I'm sorry I say how many know he was right with his anger right his anger was justified yes Hallelujah but why was it Justified now keep that up there but previously remember he comes in there and uh I think the man's hand needs healed right and uh he ask them you know should we can I heal on the Sabbath or not right but he goes ahead and heals the man right and when he looked around about them with anger being grieved for their hardness of their hearts he sayith to the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other so this group was so against Jesus they didn't want to see Jesus heal on a certain day right they were so Bound by their their Creeds and dogmas and traditions of man that they didn't even want to see Jesus heal a man's hand in order to they rather see Jesus obey their Creeds than then heal a man and Jesus was upset about that right okay so he was upset at stubbornness he was upset at hard Hearts right right and so in my life I looked at it and I thought that's all I'm said about if people look at my words harshly then I believe I was justified in my anger but at the beginning at the but I looked at my comments and at the beginning it says God bless you and then dear friend at the end I always put this is written with brotherly kindness and respects in hope you'll repent so you know I you try to you try to express as much love and grace as you can but you got to call black black and white white and so Jesus experienced this anger and I want you to notice too in verse six and the Pharisees went forth in straight way took counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy him but Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the Sea so both groups Jesus didn't hang around say let me try and make their heart soft that's right anybody ever think about that I heard a preacher I heard the preacher sound that's a good thought he didn't hang around and say well let me see if I can make you soft-hearted doesn't it remind you of pharaoh of the Old Testament Moses said Moses kept giving the plagues and his heart got harder and harder and harder in other words the Holy Ghost will lead you to the people that can be soft-hearted amen but the Holy Ghost will show you who the soft-hearted ones because all that the father has given me will come to me praise God Amen Jesus said very few will find the narrow road that leads to a soft-hearted experience with Christ hallelujah amen and that's what to say most people are hard-hearted against the Bible revelations of this hour they still want to have uh adultery fornication homosexuality women preachers they still want to have all that but you can't have that and say you're right with God in the perfect will of God hallelujah you're the perfect will of God when you live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God glory but Jesus didn't hang around and say well you know I'll try to I'll try to make them soft-hearted Hallelujah doesn't the Bible say be angry and sin not let's P that up there I want to look that one up angry and not uh Ephesians 4 let's read 23 Ephesians 423 because this is the other one be renewed in the spirit of your mind so see your emotions are going to need renewing constantly yes constantly so in our day what you know Satan attacks a lot of us madebe with condemnation so I I just noticed it I don't know about you but Americans often lack some Joy brother brings it up in the church age book we have the most material things of any generation and yet we have the most people on depression medication our lives are longer well except for the before pre Flood now post flood right post post flood and the last we'd say thousand years or so our lives are the longest lifespan we got the longest life the most physical Goods right and yet we battle having Joy right right so what do we need we need the renewal power of the Holy Spirit to bring our emotions back amen he says be renewed in the spirit of your mind put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness I like that true Holiness right there a form of godliness there's a form of Holiness but it's not true Holiness wherefore putting away ly speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one another be angry and sin not let not the sin go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil so here we get the good idea if we don't take care of some sin before the sun goes down the devil gets a placed in our mind then we're going to wake up cranky sometimes you go to bed happy you wake up cranky get attacked in your sleep you know uh the enemy comes like I got attacked physically a few weeks ago in your sleep you know you might go to bed happy go to bed uh refreshed you're thankful in the Lord and you might have an attack but the Bible clearly says we can be angry and sin not Hallelujah Jesus looked on them with anger he didn't look on them with happiness or kindness or compassion now some people he did but in that case it was anger and he was justified of all of it praise God what do we call that we call that righteous righteous indignation right amen amen it was righteous it was justified anger so there's times that you know God will uh have give us like a holy anger but we can't keep feeding it right we can't let it go off into sin all right now I want to um transition kind of into that into the critical spirit Proverbs 17:20 I preach this back in 2016 eight years ago I preached on uh the critical spirit I remember because Scott Walker was here and he come up and said I really enjoyed that brother over in the other Sanctuary there is on an evening service too I remember that Proverbs 17:20 he that ha a forward heart findeth no good now frower means a perverse heart so he that has a perverted Spirit now you know I don't want to we don't want to call ourselves perverted but I think what it means is he that has sin in his emotions right you know yeah I mean if we're if we're in a spot of sinning yeah we would say we're not our our best sense we're in a perverted sense right but we're not perverted like Sinners are perverted that's the point I'm trying to make so he that hath a frower heart findeth no good now this is the scripture I use for a critical spirit right because that that's where we you and I will battle if God gives us righteous indonation we got to be very careful you know not to become a critical spirit right and so this is what the Bible tells us here when we have a critical spirit we find nothing good about the situation that's why it's always important to see the glass half full right let's see half full instead of like everything's awful my whole life is awful this whole situation is awful well you can say well at least I'm not in at least I'm not dead right at least you can find something good about it praise God right I'm not talking about you know like really awful situation I'm just talking about like our day-to-day life you know and maybe like I said you know people speak evil words against us like like in my case you know that we're talking about here brother said this too I read this uh when I preach this 1961 he said he says uh he say sometimes people go back and become a church member with your name on the book and they give you a letter and you pack the letter now we don't do that today in message churches he said but as soon as something goes wrong there in your new church you blow up and I don't he said like I don't know what and you take it over to the next church and as soon as something goes wrong there you take it to the next Church see you haven't done right in the first place so I'm using this scripture to show how brother says people will go from church to church and blow up when things don't go their way and they keep blowing up blowing up blowing up right they have no control over their emotions Hallelujah they've got a critical spirit this church is wrong well that church is wrong that church is wrong right and you know the saying uh if you think you got a perfect church and you go there well now it's no longer perfect right but of course there is no perfect Church church and I found that to be true I've been in in in close quarters with numerous churches now when I first started going to domestic churches I thought everybody was an angel but I found out lots of them were devils right I should say lots of them some of them were devils now some Churches they did have lots of devils but not not the ones I'm speaking of because they eventually uh you know sin and do awful things but you know that's the idea here we we must have we must have God created me new restore my emotions so they're the right emotions right right we always talk about our first love why can I feel like you did at the beginning but says if you repent like you did at the beginning you'll get the same first love I'm just paraphrasing right he says if we want our first love back he said don't you think if you want your first love back you have to do the same type of repentance you did when you got your first love right amen that's what Jesus said do the first Works amen amen if you want your first love do the first Works amen hallelujah so for some of us what does that mean laying at the altar uh spending time with the Lord or amen boohoo it out like brother says right boohoo it out and then the Holy Ghost will come back on you hallelujah praise God Amen boohoo it out seek God hallelujah amen see that we've seen that people go from one Church they come to our church they blow up they leave they go blow up another church and blow up another church let's not blow up churches right let let's like uh like like that brother quote let's be flowers in churches where we just give off this fragrance let's not be bombs in churches amen like time ticking uh bombs right what do they call bombs in the military what are those uh grenades grenades yeah let's not be a grenade in the church let's be a flower and all of you are that's what I'm saying everybody I'm just talking about you know we've seen it we've seen where people can't control their emotions I've seen it amen hallelujah but you know as soon as something goes wrong they're like a grenade blowing up instead of just being like a flower where or like like like the Bible said be a doormat in the house of the Lord just let the person just let the person get all their anger just let them uh wipe it off on you that's okay I got the victory amen as a and as a as a you know as a pastor as a father you know over the years I'm talking about all over the years and I think God built me this way people can tell me some of their deepest problems and and and they can say harsh things about me and I just forget about I was telling my wife today we went out for a little date sheide the day offer I said whenever we were talking about this one person that left the church and I thought I thought when I told her I said whenever I think of that person all I think of his good things despite all the harsh things they said against me and did against me and and even told me you know all I can think of is good things because we we've talked about it we we've confessed our sins to one another all I can think of is good things God created me a clean heart I I look back and like wow that brother was really kind to me I forget all the other stuff brother brandom um oh well Mark 72 let's just look at these Pharisees again we saw how they didn't want God to do something Supernatural in jesus' life because their Creed disagree with it but here another they're always finding what's wrong their whole goal is to find fault that's what I have you know people just people watch our sermons just to put it on the accusers websites of brother brand I'm on there often I just watched I listen to one of their podcasts they put brother Brooks on there this week they put brother Samy on there they do that just to find fault now something something should check their hearts see if it doesn't they've got a seared conscience that person's probably either got a complex and saved or on their their way to hell if the Holy Ghost can't reveal if they can't let the Holy Ghost in to show them all you're doing is finding fault something is wrong with that person right because the Bible says we ought to hide the wrongs of our brothers and sisters the Bible how does that word go uh it's been a while a brother hides all the wrongs I have to look that up there by God's but let's read Mark 72 here and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled hands that is to say with unwashed hands they found fault there was nothing in the in the scriptures Moses had nothing about this this was their own Creed they created and so they find faults based upon their own Creed uh Mark 1213 what's that version Mark 1213 and they sent unto him certain of the Pharisees and the herodians to catch him in his words that they just they just wanted to find something wrong every brother says that if you want to find something wrong in the meeting you're going to find something wrong he said but if you want to find something from God you're going to find something from God praise God amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah I want to read again where brother developed this critical Spirits from two main sermons the word became flesh India report 1954 and then the Jubilee year 1954 as wellam said Lord take that critical spirit from me he said I did it in my heart I was criticizing people he said I didn't say it out loud I was criticizing people in my heart brother said now I don't criticize people out to their face but in my heart I do and the church said amen I can say Amen to that yes I think a lot of people a lot of people won't say something to their face they'll say it in their hearts right right but if we're if we're if we're also biblical we can say that criticism isn't me that's the sin that Within Me amen so I'm not trying to eat anybody upse I'm just trying to say this is the reality of having to renew our minds controlling our emotions right brother said uh oh he said I see a lady walking down the street especially she's not dressed proper I say isn't that awful in my heart he said I don't say to anybody else isn't that awful isn't that awful and said with the right reaction would be that's awful I'm going to pray for them right just just not to be critical right right that's awful after all that's her business she's a free more agent she ain't got no right to do it Christ brought her bought her life but maybe she doesn't understand so it's not for me to criticize let God do it see there's nothing wrong with saying it's awful God have mercy on that person in other words show compassion right see we're all going to battle whatever Spirit secretly in our hearts right and that like I told you that's my prayer Lord don't let me sin out out the public let let just sin be private so I don't cause I don't I don't want to bring a reproach upon the Holy Name of Jesus Christ and I love that about brother BR he said the same thing I don't do it out loud I do it in my heart and here's the other one this was this was a very extensive quote from the word became flesh 54 October 3rd before he preaches he says I want to ask the church one more thing that you'll pray for me I've developed a critical spirit and it haunts at me so brother recognized say I have a complex I have a critical spirit and it haunts me now Church you don't have to raise your hand but any any of us who've ever had a complex you know it haunts you right whenever you tried you might have confessed your sin everything like that but still there's like this haunting the devil say you did that remember you did that what about that so we have to confess our sins right and we got to we got to tell the liar the bluffer to keep his mouth shut right we got to rebuke Satan say s and get behind me praise God Amen Hallelujah told his wife I said honey I've got to place I become critical of people I don't want to be that whose job is it to criticize it's not mine God's the one to criticized not me Hallelujah and then brother talks about how he he was critical over this woman missionary she was pulling for money in India and he talks about how he says he said every time I look at that I would criticize that another thing about that you know youve got a critical spirit or uh you're too angry when every time you see that thing you criticize it right and there's nothing good in it right that's why I appreciated you know I knew you know on Sunday when we went to the service I knew there was preachers there that disagree with me I knew that I was I was glad they come up and they at least shook my hand and said hi to me I appreciated that and I smiled right back and then later one other brother not the preacher he come up and tried to correct me on something he said well I heard on your podcast this but this so I I just smiled I knew I was going into a place where I might I might get criticized so I said Amen brother I said all right brother I said here's what I think I said the main thing is to make sure we're ready for the coming of the Lord that we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I try to think of Dennis bride in that moment let me tell you how I think brother let me tell you how I see it so brother said he had this complex against a woman preacher every time he heard her name he just criticized criticized then they said the voice of healing magazine he said I saw this magazine and I began to criticize it you see he said but look at the poor people the lovely people out there following that going along honest hearted people he says I start criticizing in my heart I don't want to get to that way if I do that I will lose favor with God and brother B says who battle is it so brother is he's he's he's criticizing a woman preacher and every time he just says bad things about it right or just I'm sorry just crit say bad he criticized her he sees the voice of he magazine he criticizes that but the Holy Spirit brought to him it's not your battle The Battle Belongs to the Lord amen amen that's what helps him get the victory praise God Amen he said instead of criticizing it he said I've got to love them anyhow amen he said but now here here he says his critical spirit he said it was just a constant grind a grind and a grind my mental power is breaking like that and I've got to get away and get some rest and now he links this critical spirit to not getting enough rest anybody ever get ever anybody ever struggle with your emotions when you don't get enough rest oh yeah yes I do too well said I don't want to be hypocrite I want it to come from my heart that I really have love for those who are not lovely amen and the one guy said well I can't tell you I told him God bless you and I said I love you with the love of the Lord and I said why don't you write I love you with the love of the Lord he said why don't know if I love you I said the Bible said you even got to love your enemies right so this is this is the condition there they can't even they can't even tell me God bless you or I love you or I'm praying for you that that that's the blind condition that they're in then they get upset if I call them uh if I say like you you're being hypocritical here or you're slandering brother Ram they call Brother Ram a buffoon a liar all these wicked things and then they get they get mad at me for saying they're slandering him but I'm the one saying I'm and and I I said haven't you ever heard where I pray for you on the I pray for them on the podcast I pray for them on the videos and they say yeah I've heard that but but but whatever you know we yeah I'm still going to keep my critical spirit see it's got you have to have love for those who are lovely right what was the real proof of a Christian Jesus said you have love one for another that's the real proof of Christianity brother Ram says that's what Jesus did Jesus loved me when I wasn't lovely he said when I was critical when I needed to be criticized still he loves me still anyhow praise God Hall we're not so look at that whatever you're struggling with brother struggl with being critical so you realized Jesus could have criticized me but he loved me anyway amen amen hallelujah so that I hope that helps somebody here tonight by God's grace he said take the critical spirit from thy servant Lord that's that's I think that's every one of our prayers right if we got a wrong Spirit if I'm being angry with without an unjust then Lord take that angry Spirit from my heart help me to be like Christ but I can't can't say it's a sin to be angry it's not a sin to be angry as long as you don't uh sin right you can be angry and sin not remember Paul was really angry with the Galatians you remember that he said oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should turn from the truth and go back to the law he even said I might have to labor again to make sure some of you are born again right cuz they brought the law back into Grace and then remember he said I you see how I write with big letters that is the oldfashioned well that's the modern version of all caps I'm really mad at you so I'm typing all capital letters right one time I typed this this year I typed it to a parent on accident and I made a big mistake but I said uh your son did not want to do that I did not and she got all upset like what do you do yell you know she wrote back all these emojis and things like what you do yell at you is he in trouble I said no why do you feel that way she said you used all capital letters I was like oh sorry that's what Paul did Paul said don't you see I'm riding with a large hand I'm angry but I sin not praise God so I apologized I said no more all capital letters I just wanted her to see in the words that he just said I did not want to take this test I did not want uh I just wanted so I apologize for that I didn't mean to say anything wrong it was honestly honest in my heart brother says remember we shape Lord let us shape Our Lives by self-control amen amen let my life be shaped by controlling my emotions Amen Let Me Be A person who can control my emotions but that doesn't mean you don't get angry it's good to be angry against the devil right but you don't want to take it too far where you start calling him names like dumb devil because even Michael the Archangel wouldn't do that remember that right well gred he's a gen say A J right we don't see that's where it goes too far that's anger that's gone too far you can be angry and sin not remember there's seasons for emotions I'm not going to read it but Ecclesiastes 3 I never said the Tim so sorry um there's a time to hate and a time to love there's a time for anger right there's a time for anger there's a time for mourning sadness there's a time for dancing yes right Hallelujah I'm glad we have that season praise God remember who does anybody remember the church age what brother said Jesus's most often emotion was you just read it you remember it's okay you don't weeping weeping and mourning was Jesus's most often emotion Bible said he'd be a man of sorrow uh Isaiah 53 a man of sorrow think about that God Of Heaven comes down to this earth makes sense doesn't it it's all glory up there the logos I'm talking about and then that Loos comes to dwell in the body of Jesus no wonder man of sorrow he came to his own and his own received him not says it here it's in uh chapter 2 the Patmos Vision page 504 of all the human emotions he manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often so if you cry a lot don't feel bad you're right along with Jesus amen yet behind that weeping and that sorrow there was still God that's why the Bible says we must sigh and cry for the Abominations because Jesus his most often emotion was weeping and mourning Hallelujah remember we saw it where he wept at the grave of Lazarus right right remember we saw when he said oh Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how of I would have hovered over you but you would not right now think about that that means if we've accepted Christ we are right up in jesus' bosom today amen like a hen do her brood right now we don't have a hen yet with babies but we'll see that pretty soon maybe Lord right have a mama H and maybe we can hatch some maybe more willingness NE this year maybe by God's grace but just H just just hover right up to it and show it some uh show it some warmth praise God right Jesus cried because they wouldn't they wouldn't come up to him and receive his love he cried and wept Hallelujah I'm going try to bring that this down to the close here by God's grace remember he also had Thanksgiving he also had uh good emotions uh Matthew 11:25 you got your at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto even so father for it seem good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and to he whomsoever the son will reveal him now I just had this thought one of the girls asked a good question remember about are we going to cry over our the lost loved ones that's an excellent question of course I think we will but once the tears are wiped away I believe we'll have a greater revelation of Romans chapter 9 which we're coming up on where Paul pulls back and he says Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated he said some of you are vessels unto honor that's you guys amen and that's what the qu question was from our little little sister who I'm looking at right now this is what we'll see once we're in heaven we'll realize God made Vessels with this for Nows God made Vessels that were made to to last and then but God also made Vessels that were not made to last and that that that was the ultimate illustration Paul could give us some are vessels of Honor you keep them others are vessels of Dishonor and church that's why Jesus can thank God pull back up 25 think about this how could he thank God that the Pharisees weren't receiving the Revelation it had to be because of for knowledge he had to know there they just weren't called to it but I also believe one reason he was thankful he said at least somebody's receiving this message amen hallelujah it's not a big crowd but the elect always receed God's word hallelujah amen he said fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the Rapture praise God Amen so Jesus experienced anger he exper here experienced thankfulness thank God somebody will receive the message thank God we got a message Church in a praise God Amen do you remember that Steve Alexander come here and said he said for 10 years or 15 years he said I pray for God to raise up a message Church in akan by name and then look who God sent here across the oceans and your your family across the oceans right the Yang family literally came across the oceans from LA right hallelujah amen and that man by name said God raise up a message Church in akan and God answered his prayer that's why I always respect that man hallelujah amen I don't understand everything about his life but I sure respect that because he kept praying he wanted to have a message church so his family could come to the church I think he came once or twice that man Daniel was the man's name I'm coming to me now he came a couple times and heard me preach I disagree with you here here I said show me where I'm wrong he never email me back that's what happens most often they that they can't break the word of God right you can't defeat the word of God right or just not worth my time but here Jesus now experiences Thanksgiving but go back up to verse 20 look look at his roller coaster of emotions now church I this is how I feel when I'm preaching sometimes I'm happy as I'm joyful as going to be and then in a few minutes we'll be crying right we'll be crying and pretty soon we'll be shouting and rejoicing we just go through this emotional roller coaster that's what Jesus went through but it's okay as long as it's God taking you on that trip Hallelujah God's using your emotions here Jesus began to upgrade the cities so uaid means to sternly rebuke let me look up the actual word there I thought that's what it was listen to this here he goes from uprating to Thanksgiving so uprate is to revile I've had people tell me that brother just you revile me they were CRI me I said well maybe it was God sometimes God does that Jesus did that I don't know if we ever got down to the heart of it but it means to cast uh rebuke in one's teeth right Jesus uh Jesus upgraded his disciples right for the resurrection said why didn't you believe those women he said oh fools slow of heart that's an uprade God calling you a fool to your face yeah and church we all are sometimes right let's not act like we're not if we choose to go into sin if we choose well we we were foolish in that moment that doesn't mean that's the real part of God in our lives that's just our sin right that's our Humanity we repent get out of that but Jesus goes from rebuking right in their teeth you should have received it woe to you tasan woe to you uh just rebukes them over and over again and then he says I thank God that that the wise and The Prudent have missed it I thank God here reveal it to the bride hallelujah amen look at the emotions rebuke rebuke woe to you and then he say thank you Lord I like the roller coaster of emotions God puts us through don't you like how many like to feel God's emotions one of the worst things is not feel any emotions there there's a condition for that where you can't feel any emotion that's kind of like depression you can't feel it you can't feel anything other than just sadness all the time at least we did have some uh some change of emotion thank God for that amen so Jesus goes from upgrading to Thanksgiving amen go to Luke 10117 I'm almost done so I think I'll I'll preach this and then I'll share brother br's greatest emotional battle that he told us and then I'll share my greatest emotional battle since I came in the message so it might help you Luke 10:17 the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name now look at verse 20 not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you now look at that you would think Jesus would be happy for them that they could cast out Devils wouldn't you think if we s our little ones out and they come back rejoice and we cast out Devils you would think oh yeah let's Rejoice she said don't rejoice in that he says but Rejoice because your names are in heaven other words don't rejoice in temporary giftings right because gifts are all temporary we see through a glass Darkly right yeah but then we'll see him face to face rejoice in the face to face Hallelujah rejoice in the promise of eternal life praise God amen and Jesus mod that that's what the brother preached that really blessed me uh it's in Mark after after Jesus healed all the sick and The Afflicted the Bible said he rose up a great while before day and went out to pray to the heavenly father because even he knew the joy of Miracles will eventually wear off and I might get prideful lifted up I have to have fellowship with the heavenly father just like here don't Rejoice so much for miracles and casting out Devils Rejoice because you know God has accepted you Heaven amen right there's a name written in glory and it's ours amen hallelujah rejoice in that Jesus rejoiced and look he rejoices right after correcting his disciples don't Rejoice he didn't join in yeah let's have a party let's let's Rejoice no he said rejoice in this turn turn your turn your uh Rejoice from away from gifts and put it on eternal life Hallelujah get it all the temporary and get it on the Eternal praise God amen amen and then in that hour verse 21 Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and reveal them un babes even so father for seeing good in th sight in other words I Rejoice because the father has done his will the father has called them I Rejoice because the father Reveals His word to whomsoever he desires amen he reveals them to all the friends of God God the children of God hallelujah and I am a friend of God hallelujah he calls me friend Hallelujah so Jesus was angry here hallelujah and then he was sad weeping upright he rebukes them to their teeth right rebukes them to their face and here he rejoices he corrects their rejoicing and says I rejoice in this rejoice in life hallelujah amen so brother's greatest battle he tells us and is your life worth of the Gospel 1963 it was when his first wife hope had died and God was taking home Sharon Rose he said I sat all night long and I said to god what have I done show me Lord don't let the innocent have to suffer for me if I've done wrong I didn't know he was testing me but every son that comes to God has to be tried the church said amen but said Lord tell me what I've done I'll make it right what have I done but preach all day all night long and give just given my life constantly what have I done Satan said that's right so he brother's praying to God I've given you everything can't you heal my daughter and say says that's right he you see now when it comes to you you've told all of them that you believe that he's a Healer and there lays your baby ly there dying he refused to even hear your wife died with tuberculosis pneumonia you said he could heal Cancers and there he is now you talk about him being good this is Satan talking and how good he is to people what about you that's what this devil says you've seen all these people heal now what about you why isn't he good to you right see remember his hardest battle in Life Church what does that tell us the loss of our loved ones and friends can be the hardest battles we ever face in life because the devil will say well you you you got all these testimonies God did all the things why didn't he do it for you brother actually agreed with the devil you're right God could heal God God could but said then I began to listen to him speaking of Satan that's reasoning I thought that's right sorry to get upset with God said he can tell you don't have to speak the word just look at your baby and it would live I said that's right so he agreed with Satan twice Satan says much as you've done for him and yet that's what he does for you I said that's right agree with him three times I begin to think well what see everything begin to break away when it comes to the reasonings but when it comes to that he said it hung there so brother said I lost all my emotions in my mind my mind was just lost okay you're right devil you're right you're right you're right he said but when all this broke away there was an anchor that held me right there there's an anchor in the soul praise God when everything seems right yes God could have done it he shouldn't have done it maybe I felt like i' I've done all this why can't you do it for me when all that breaks away and it all seems like something's wrong here the Bible brother says God's truth will hang right there in your soul hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah he says when all the reising powers have broken away then it came to that eternal life that new birth he said what if it hadn't been there brother R would have left preaching he never would have preached the seals or marriage and divorce or anything like that what if it hadn't have been there we wouldn't have known one another the way we do now this church would have been here like this the Thousand Millions around the world I'm sorry the church would not have been here like this but thank God it was there praise God hallelujah thank God it was there he says then I thought what who am I anyhow who am I to question his majesty amen who am I have question the Creator that gave me the very life here on Earth where did I get that baby who give it to me not mine anyhow he just loaned her to me for a while I said Satan get away from me I went over laid my hand on the baby I said God bless you sweetheart in a minute daddy will take you down put you on mommy's arms the angels will pack you your little soulway and I'll meet you in in the morning I said Lord you give her to me you're taking her away though you slay me like job said yet I love you I believe you if you send me to hell I love you anyhow I can't get away from that there you are he said when the intellectual all broke away you've got to have a personal relationship you've got to be born again hallelujah amen hallelujah all the emotions I've lost my wife I've lost this and agreeing with the devil and all these things but thank God The Anchor Holds within the veil hallelujah amen thank God amen he said that was his greatest moment of trial testing and what if he would have failed well see God put something in there so you won't fail thank God hallelujah amen he put something inside of us it was the Holy Ghost that that was his anchor praise God the soul it was a jean seed of God hallelujah amen the part of God that couldn't sin that couldn't disbelieve That Couldn't reason or agree with the devil Hallelujah the spirit of God hallelujah God own life and brother Soul hallelujah amen let me just share this I'm going to share this here my biggest trial since coming to the message was a couple years ago when I had two friends that left the message preachers that I preached for one of them I I I I basically led into the message and one night my wife remembers this too we because we talk about today about that's I fresh in my mind the brother said he was down from North you know who I'm talking about right he sent me this list of all these apparent false prophecies of brother Brandon and church that night it shook me to the core because I thought and you know you know the verse they used it was Deuteronomy 18 if a prophet says something in the name of the Lord and doesn't come to pass don't hear him now that's right but that's not all the scripture Hallelujah and that my wife said I she just she I was just struggling with that I told her about it she said she had to go downstairs and pray for me Hallelujah that was just about maybe 201 13 14 15 I can't remember no it would have been it would have been no it would have been after that because I I preached down there in 2017 it's either 2020 if I'm not mistaken and chch what I found is that the enemy keeps coming in with the flood right the deceptions get more and more intense mhm but my wife said I woke up a different person the next day CU I went and read my Bible and the church said if you take Deuteronomy 18 just face value then Jonah was a false prophet because Jonah said God's going to destroy this place in 40 days he didn't say if he said he's destroying it in 40 days that's right if you just take that at face value Jonah was a false prophet right the second most obvious one is that God told Elijah you'll do three things let's read it first Kings 19 this one really set me to shouting praise God and brother Loris was the one who told me about this God bless our precious I just mean it's it's it's interesting how God brought it through brother Loris when brother Loris doesn't leave the message anymore God bless his heart if he's listening I doubt it but love you brother and love you and Karen and so forth But First Kings 19:15 and the Lord said Toto him go return on the way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint hael to be king over Syria and juu the son of nimi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of Shea of Abel molah shalt thou anoint to be a prophet in thy room and it should come to pass that him that escapethe the sword of juu shall Elisha slay so God told Elijah imagine me tell Malachi thus sayith the Lord You're Going to anoint these three people he only anointed one of them and even he wasn't even there when Elisha got anointed right now what about that see Elijah going to said thus sayith the Lord I'm anointed haziel juu and Elisha God told me thus sayith the Lord okay but really when he left his mantle came down and that's the anointing that fell on Elisha Elisha anointed king haziel and then a son of a prophet anointed J King in 2 Kings 9 Hallelujah and the church said amen amen and so going back to the scripture oh yeah and then Isaiah Isaiah said thus sayth the Lord Hezekiah set your house in order you're going to die well he didn't die right Isaiah is a false prophet no sir right as Jesus said it is also written amen there's the answer right there it is also written hallelujah amen amen in other words there's other scriptures too where God can interpret the the prophecy however he wants to interpret it praise God hallelujah and then in each case I went through every one of those on the on the text the brother sent me the
