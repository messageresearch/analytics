smoke's about so lord let our fires burn brightly tonight for your glory and we ask all these things in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you you may be seated here we'll get right to the word of god here tonight okay so let's look at part three here we've been looking at uh the mystery of the church composed of jew and gentile i think if it's okay uh let's see can you switch over let's see if i got that uh so i've been in the little time i'm not studying i've been building this little website on my personal website and so this is the mobile version but defending jesus's message and messenger there's a little tab here at the top uh if you go to books uh i gotta fix that but anyways there's the first book you can click on that and then the second book if you click here um i just want to update the church here's what i'm building so i'm building each chapter will have a link and you can click on the uh on the link here it's like let's say we're writing on the jew gentile it'll scroll down to that chapter and then i need to put the pdfs in here where you have all the brother rams quotes you have the bible scriptures i'm going to put a video in there you know just introducing the topic uh let's see oh yeah and then they can listen to it as well and then there's just going to be a button there you can click return to the top it'll scroll back up to the top so that's kind of what i'm building in my free time there i'm kind of building that free and if there's anybody that needs anything you know they'll be able to get it there uh by god's grace i'm trying to think of what else i've been working on there i think that's it let's see any other things i've been building there uh yeah if you if you didn't know i've been doing a little blog post um to kind of keep you know my subscribers updated so i just character and larkin i just kind of you ever want to share this with anybody and then for the message page i got um all the videos that teach brother grant well i just got one right now brother branham's message uh so i have a page for the message which is the bible revelations and then the messenger this is where i got most of it on uh defending them against believe the sign i'm defending by the graham against believe the sign there's our debate video uh and my video is defending brother branham against branham tabernacle can you imagine that i'm defending the prophet against his own home church but he said that he said this tabernacle will lose its strength i found another vision brother brahm said uh the holy spirit told him the branham tabernacle won't eat the bread of god i found that quote that's from 1946. so god told him well in advance that the tabernacle was going to not accept the bread of god and that they would lose their strength so i have all those links to the videos there and then i have proof that william branham was the message those youtube links there you know so i'm just slowly building it that's kind of what i like to do in the free time there but the main thing is to get that book out because it's coming out here in a couple uh about a month i think i'll be out in about a month there okay thank you i just saw that update that um and let's get into the word of god here tonight i'm gonna set a 45 minute timer i'm really going to try to keep it short we got here a good time tonight and i want to be faithful with uh our time here so we look let's look at part three of the mystery of the jew and gentile church one church composed of both you and gentile let's pick up where we left off it can i get my readers there by god's grace uh yep nature too okay living malachi nature and haven okay we'll get some readers there get your bibles here let's go with lydia hosea chapter 2 malachi romans 9 24 and nature do you want to get jeremiah 16. so we ended last week looking at the prophets who foretold that god would take uh the gospel to the gentiles right that's kind of what we looked at last week so let's look at that again uh today and we'll finish up i think there was uh numerous prophets four old testament prophets plus the god prophet god himself foretold that god would share this glorious message with us amen not church just imagine your life without this message what would your life be without jesus christ with no promises no covenants no blessings or be an awful existence wouldn't it uh we'd probably be like those drug addicted people out there on the streets right just roaming the streets or just you know or you know house to house all kinds of evil things the world does we wouldn't have uh the wisdom that we have today praise god remember the bible said the wisdom of god is far more precious solomon said with all your gettings get wisdom praise god its value is more than rubies right just like that proverbs 31 woman praise god so lydia hosea 223 can you read that when you're ready amen wonderful so god uh god says the gentiles were not his people but he's gonna say thou art my people can i just say like that i'm god's people tonight how many can say amen to that i am god's family praise i am in god's family tonight i am one of his people praise god the bible says that thou art my people now we need to say god is my god jesus christ is my god amen that's what we boldly get to declare so malachi romans in romans 9 24 25 and 26 malachi she got three scriptures there for me paul cites hosea that great prophet and he said and he quotes what lydia just read out of hosea so maokai could you read romans 9 24 25-26 what a blessing paul expands upon hosea right and gives it some some more words he says we are called to be god's people right we are god's beloved before only israel was beloved god only looked at israel as that wonderful one but church but now he looks at us praise god now he looks at us we are god's beloved bride amen what a blessing and the bible says we are called the children of the living god amen hallelujah we're his beloved were his children where his people were called to be his people do you hear god's calling praise god oh we should hear it all the time we should hear god calling us to serve him calling us to love him called to follow him as his dear children uh nature could you get uh jeremiah 16 verses 19 20 and 21 jeremiah 16 19 20 and 21 beautiful scripture here jeremiah prophesies of the gentiles coming to know the true god jeremiah 16 19 20 and 21 refuge um profit [Music] my amen wonderful thank you beautiful the bible says the gentiles will come from the ends of the earth and realize our fathers have been deceived by idolatry right and it says they god will cause them to know his hand and his mind the right hand of power praise god so the gentiles will come to know god's power because right hand just it just symbolizes the power of god right and they'll know god's might and they shall know that his name is the lord he is jehovah praise god he is yahweh hallelujah oh thank god that it's written by these four prophets right and god so five that the gentiles come to know the true god it was all foretold and remember we read it in our text in ephesians they didn't see it it was totally hidden from them i don't know how they missed that but it was all god right it was god hiding it so that it could be a beautiful revelation in this hour aren't you glad for that revelation go to jesus now that we've seen where it's prophesied jesus though first had to offer this new covenant to the jews so matthew 10 verses five six and seven haven't you get that matthew 10 verses five six and seven in fact god was obligated the bible says the word necessary later it says necessary it could come no other way god had to first give israel the chance to receive it right because they were already under covenant with god it was absolutely necessary to offer the baptism of the holy ghost to the jews first but they turned it down right uh matthew 10 verses five six and seven haven when you're ready these twelve is that where you're at all right thank you now notice what jesus told them do not go to the gentiles do not go to these uh ones with no covenant with no promises he says uh nor to the samaritans now what's interesting church is that he says that but then he made special trips to visit the samaritan woman right so he tells them stay out of the gentiles stay out of the samaritans right remember the samaritan's wife looked up the history and it said they were the jews that stayed when when the jews were scattered you know before the new testament the samaritans are the one that stayed and they uh you know they they they emphasized jacob's well right and they didn't worship at the temple so that's why the jews that moved back despised them right because they wouldn't they wouldn't come to their temple and worship and so jesus says don't go to the gentiles don't go the samaritans just go to the lost sheep of the house of israel and preach okay now you remember this we don't have time to read all of it but jesus actually called the gentiles dogs right that syrophenician woman came up to jesus and and said lord heal my daughter and she wouldn't even look at him right remember that scripture that was in matthew chapter 12. jesus looks at and then she finally keeps begging and jesus says uh you're basically you're a dog right and what was her great comeback a great comeback she was so desperate she said even the dogs get the crumbs that fall from the master's table praise god and jesus said because of your faith you have what you ask for praise god dogs church we know dogs are very dirty animals the florida health department says dogs have bacteria around their mouths that you don't want on your face almost a quarter million americans get sick every year by getting uh the germs from dogs oh my they lick dogs lick themselves all over so these germs can be on the dog's nose when it's nuzzling you remember i'm not gonna say the story but there's some people that really like dogs that we know right but uh there's thousands of germs right on the dog's mouth around the dog's nose and everything so you know that word actually means little dog so jesus doesn't call him a big dog you're just a little dog and so jesus was recognizing that they were dirty unclean isn't that so fitting they're unclean the gentiles are just dirty people right they don't live right they don't they don't take care of themselves they'll eat anything they'll they'll do anything uh and so jesus says you're dogs and he says but my israel their children amen but later we know jesus went to the woman at samara she had he had need to go by samaria and then through her a bunch of samaritans get saved amen so jesus was showing slowly he was opening it up he was spending most of time with israel but he would open up at times to samaritan and gentile remember the roman centurion he healed his son her servant rather and said i have not found so great of faith now it's interesting jesus called them dogs in matthew 15 rather sorry matthew 15. but in john chapter 10 he calls him sheep right so one place when he's talking with some he says you're a dog but other times when i remember john john 10 is getting close to john 12 right where uh in john 13 where it's the end of jesus's life so towards the end of jesus ministry he's now revealing some things saying well they're more than dogs they're sheep that's john 10 16. can you put that up there lydia i'm sorry casey john 10 16. let's see what jesus says here so when he says dogs he says don't go to them but he says other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there should be one fold and word praise god now picture that church before jesus there was there was there was one fold it was only protected uh by god with his promises the old covenant the mosaic covenant everybody else just out there uh lost basically but jesus says because israel has not heard the voice of my shepherd he said because you've not heard me you've rejected the father as well it's basically what he said in john chapter 10. he said but i'm going to go because you've rejected me i'm going to get my other sheep and bring them into my fold in other words we're protected by jesus the great shepherd tonight amen who's taking care of you tonight church it's not it's not your job it's not the government it's jesus christ amen he's feeding your soul praise god he's providing for your natural needs he's providing every one of your spiritual needs and remember that promise he said he's given us all spiritual blessings in christ jesus amen whatever we love god's already supplied it through the great shepherd jesus christ we were called dogs right but now they're called sheep now remember there's some good things about dogs right there's good benefits to actually living with dogs it lowers your blood pressure apparently and your heart rate that still doesn't make me want to get one now all right uh heart attack survivors dog owners were eight times more likely uh to be alive a year later after a heart attack so there's some benefits to having a dog you know you just feel more loved like i i was getting milk today at that a friend's house and this dog comes up out of nowhere just i've seen him before but i petted him and he just he's all excited at first i pet him for about a minute and now he's just all relaxed and he just he just wants me to pet him all over you know i said okay i gotta go and he just gotta wags his tail and he runs back to where he was but this is that they just they if you will love them they'll just do anything for you right that's a great lesson that we get uh god's poured out his love to the gentiles right so we just that's why we're so in love with jesus praise god right you get that idea of the dog right the faithful dog a man's best friend they say dogs are very smart right and what did jesus say the the uh the greeks desire wisdom right but he also said jesus said there's gonna be a change i'm not gonna call you dogs anymore i'm gonna call you sheep that hear my voice amen now jesus's parable of the wicked husband when we preach the eighth mystery plainly says this same thing uh if you go to matthew 21 lydia or acacia can you pull it up sorry i'm so used to saying lydia jesus basically says i'm taking the kingdom of god and i'm giving it to the gentiles matthew 21 43 therefore i say unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof oh god we should be so thankful shall we not church that the kingdom of god belongs to us amen hallelujah we should be so thankful the kingdom of god the rulership of god the divine power of god amen hallelujah the blessings of god the healing of god the peace of god it all belongs to us we ought to cherish it praise god because it was taken from the jews and given to us it's god's great gift he's given to us let us rejoice in it let us be thankful for it and let us uh uh just not be not let it take be taken for granted let us uh uh gain every benefit we can from this great gift that we've been given praise god hallelujah it was taken from them oh lord like like david said take not your holy spirit from me right that should be our desire but israel's like that's okay if you take the kingdom of god we'd rather have our denomination right that's the same thing that's going on in many denominational churches today they'd rather have their own man-made creeds and ideas than the true power of god the word of god amen now isaiah 60 verse 3 says the gentiles shall come to thy light but jesus's light first came to the jews in acts 3 verse 25 and 26. can you pull up acts 3 verse 25 and 26 isaiah said the gentiles will come to their light but the light first came to the jews here it is verse 26 unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you and turning away every one of you from his iniquities think about that you were given the first the jews were given the first option of it and they turned it down praise god you were given they were given the first opportunity to have life-changing power to have holy ghost power right to have god's indwelling power to have christ in you messiah in you the hope of glory and they turned it down they'd rather have their uh their own human mind dwelling in them would then have christ dwelling in them oh we ought to be thankful we ought to praise god that christ can live in us amen it was given to them first but they turned it down notice he said i don't send you to the samaritans or gentiles and see it even had to go to the the jews even the baptism of the holy ghost it was went to them first to bless them look at that to bless you amen the holy ghost is a blessing amen forgiveness is a blessing hallelujah redemption is a blessing amen all these great promises are a blessing first to the jew pull up romans 1 16 if you would acacia god was first preached to the jew romans 1 verse 16 for i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ it's the power of god under salvation to everyone that believeth to the jews first and also to the greek they were the first one but they turned it down we're the second ones to hear it we received it thank god i'll just say this thank god we got a chance at it praise god let's make the most of our chance with this kingdom of god that he's given to us hallelujah once though the jews rejected and blasphemed it in acts 13 then the light went to the gentiles they passed on it church doesn't it remind you of esau esau had the birth right he had in other words his future was in command and he was going to be in the he was going to be the family leader spiritually his his loins out of his loins would come the messiah he had all the blessings lined up and he sold it out for a bowl of cottage he sold it out for savory meat he was the first one that had the chance to have uh the blessing of the birthright and he sold it out for temporal blessings all you young people don't let anyone tell you that the blessing of christ is not the greatest thing on the earth it is the greatest thing on the earth praise god don't let anybody don't let the devil take that from you make sure that that you don't miss that opportunity to keep the kingdom of god and to live for jesus because satan wants to try to take that away from you that great blessing from you but you'll you'll understand soon it is the greatest blessing you can have god dwelling in your soul nothing can top that praise god nothing at all can top god living in you breathing in you speaking through you praise god i was reading uh just some testimonies on my first book uh today i was just going through them and the one woman said it's as if jesus was uh speaking right through you as you wrote the book the woman said it was like jesus riding through you or i saw another testimony on amazon uh i think it was from last august the woman said i was wearing leggings and all these things uh i thought it was okay to do leggings she said i bought your book she said i'm never going back she said god has restored modesty to my life through your book praise god can you imagine what a blessing that is praise god that we have a chance to receive it praise god that we have a chance to go from nakedness to covered amen right we have a chance to go from unholy to holy let's make the most of this chance praise god amen first given to the jews rejected now it comes to the gentiles 16 he used them first uh on the day of pentecost to the jews second he used them in acts chapter eight he followed up philip's ministry to the samaritans he and john laid hands on the samaritans they received the baptism of the holy ghost and then god this was important god had to give peter vision after vision right repeat three times he had to tell him i'm cleansing the gentiles and he still turned it down right how many times has god got to tell us times to obey we've got to repeat it right once i hope so are we first time o bears children we talk about first time obedience are we first time o'bears with the holy spirit three times god said rise kill and eat and peter said not so lord he did not want to go to the gentiles he did not want to go now look at this this is something he struggled right he had trouble going the first time he needed three times the lord told him and then the holy ghost fell on them and then years later paul had to come correct him and say don't separate yourself from the gentiles go ahead and eat with the gentiles so see church that tells us people with the baptism of the holy ghost they can have a revelation of something but then struggle with it right in this case it was like discriminate he wouldn't eat with the gentiles the very person who saw the holy ghost fall on the gentiles then struggled later to fellowship with them ah and but god had to use a supernatural thing not just a word from a brother or a sister god had to send the prophet peter a vision to shake him up praise god three times had to tell them god god knew how to work with his prophet can i say like that he had he knew how to do it he's got to use visions to move this man oh my and then peter's preaching the holy ghost falls he he saw it just like he did on the day of pentecost the same thing happened praise god and then he goes back memory church he goes back to judea and he tells them in in acts chapter 11 that the gentiles got the holy ghost you know the bible said they contended with peter why because these were dogs these were dirty filthy stinking dogs and these apostles are like there's no egg oh i'm sorry he said there's no way god would pour out the holy ghost on these dirty dogs right sorry about that i gotta do something about that wire [Music] it's on my to-do list and they can can you imagine holy ghost-filled men arguing with peter it's impossible there's no way these people got the holy ghost no way they're dirty they're smelly right they're stinky there's no way but peter says who was i who was i that i could withstand god i preached the word i had a vision i saw god saying i'm going to cleanse them the holy ghost fell just like it did at the day of pentecost and that was the word that convinced them the holy ghost falls the same way they in other words they were saying the gentiles are one of us i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that they can say i'm one of them praise god so what was the convincing tone the convincing tone was peter humbling himself he said look these people acted the same way they prophesied they magnified god they spoke with tongues whatever they did at cornelius house they magnified god he was convinced by the presence of god the power of god fell and the power of god convinced peter oh there's that right hand church amen the gentiles would have the right hand of god hallelujah the right hand of god fell on the gentiles just like he said in the book of jeremiah praise god amen a blessing peter gets accused he he gets argued with but he's humbled by the holy spirit being poured out you know what church that's what we really need we need more humility in our lives praise god the falling of the holy ghost always makes us humble brother ram says sincerity brings god's power we have to be more sincere in our lives peter gets humble he says what would i what was i that i could withstand god oh what a blessing that is let me just say like this anyone that wants to be born again god is going to send the wind to birth them into the kingdom of god and not even peter could stop it amen hallelujah church be encouraged if somebody wants to be born again here they're going to be born again peter's like i can't withstand god i can't stop what god's doing god is seeking and saving that which is lost praise god amen what a blessing to me amen preaching these 15 years knowing i've given all all that i have it's a blessing to know that all those who want the holy ghost will get it praise god peter couldn't withstand god who am i that i i can't withstand god god is going to meet every child of god that wants to be born again god's going to meet them and god is going to seek and save his children praise god all those that want the kingdom will receive the kingdom of god so cornelius house is now a turning point right in this great mystery how could god bring in these heathens that are outside this this holy flock how could he bring him in this is the turning point and these men have not even been circumcised through abraham's token covenant and yet they're born again now this in cornelius's house this starts the time jesus said the times of the gentiles in luke 21 verse 34. church can i say it like this it's your time amen it's your time praise god you young people it's your time amen our time with the holy ghost we have to do something with it praise god the bible said we must not be negligent with the holy ghost amen it's your time it's our time we have to do something with the power of god we must be vessels that the power of god can flow through amen in churches like we saw this week we don't know how long our time is let's not take it lightly right we don't know whenever god can take somebody this is your time this is the time of the gentiles it's a limited time paul says the gospel is with the gentiles until the fullness of the gentiles become in there's just a short amount of time now it's 2 000 years but i'm talking about our lives now there's just a short amount of time we don't know what the window is right a year five years 10 years 100 years we don't know what the window is but it's our time let's redeem the time hey man hallelujah there it is let's redeem the time it's our time thank god now the next section is paul paul's gentile dispensation and peter's apostleship to the jews now i'm going to read these quickly briefly paul said in first corinthians 9 17 he said a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me that word means a stewardship so paul had a stewardship committed to him of the gospel he was to watch over the gospel ephesians 3 1-2 says this was given by god he says for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation the grace of god which has given me to you word i love this next one this was this is what it reminds me of uh colossians 1 25 whereof i made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god amen now i'm thinking of another one though too that's uh i think i got that mixed up i love that scripture but that's not the one i was looking for i was looking for a different one oh yeah the prisoner that's right yeah the prisoner so paul was a prisoner as a minister so god imprisoned him in a stewardship as a minister to leave that prison room he was a love slave to christ everybody catch that sometimes church you might feel like you're a prisoner and it might be your very it's probably your very calling hello he said i'm a prisoner as a minister so god had entrapped him and said these are the boundaries you live your life in you're a preacher right don't leave this person you're a love slave to me you're a love prisoner to me you're a prisoner of love a slave to the master to leave that prison to leave that calling would be to defile their life right would be to deny the plan of god for their life many times we we get discouraged and maybe some well maybe sometimes we could get discouraged in our calling but we've got to stay faithful to the calling god wants you to learn i'll say i this god wants you to be instant in season and out of season amen god wants you to be faithful you know why because god's faithful praise god hallelujah god wants you to be there when no one else shows up god wants you to be there because you're acting like him praise god hey you're his child amen you ought to act like god god is always there you won't always be there too praise god amen i'm a prisoner to being a minister hallelujah thank the lord amen thank you jesus it's a stewardship it's my responsibility i've got to make sure i'm faithful with this assignment given by god paul said i was given a stewardship to you to the churches right i'm a slave to you that's why he'd preach all night amen that's why i'll preach an hour and a half on a sunday sometimes longer because i'm a slave i'm a prisoner to the lord right i'm a prisoner to my listeners that the sheep god has sent me to preach to you i'm a prisoner to them and paul said woe unto me if i don't preach the gospel let me say this woe unto me if i don't preach the gospel woe unto you and us if we don't do what god's called us to do we were just rejoicing earlier right because we had a calling we we're called to the gospel right we rejoice under that but we've got to be faithful in it as well can't remember we can't forget that we're prisoners to the calling of god amen see when it gets hard a lot of people just leave their calling they leave their responsibility that's that's called a hireling right that's called a uh faithful pastor right that's called an unfaithful shepherd right that's an impersonator they're only there for the money right we have to be faithful in the good faithful and the bad times right because god has called us for a specific ministry paul knew what that was so paul was chosen to go to the gentiles peter to the jews now church that's not confused let's go to galatians 2 verse 7. let's not confuse this although there were two separate men sent out it was the one faith but as we've been hearing right these last few weeks the jews are allowed to express their faith differently than us and we're allowed to sell or to express our faith differently than the jewish christians right or the messianic christians god has variety within the unity praise god because there's only one faith paul says there's one lord one faith one baptism now galatians 2 7 but contrary wise when they saw that the gospel the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of circumcision was unto peter so see there's two gospels there's a gospel committed to the jews gospel to the gentiles for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision think about that peter on the day of pentecost how many people got saved three thousand right it sounds like a pretty good revival hard to top that one three thousand but remember paul went to certain islands and the bible said all that were on the island were healed praise god amen see in other words paul said the same god that did mighty works on the day of pentecost is the same god that does mighty works in my ministry see sent to two different groups said one paul was sent to the gentile flock peter sent to the jewish flock the same god showed great power amongst them despite their differences in their expression of worship that's why god will fall in a church that loves the holy ghost no matter their differences that they have with us right just like the same way god can fall in our church or has fallen in our church we may have things slightly different that's our liberty that's our right but god's looking at the heart god's looking at those who are hungry and thirsty for holiness look at these choices look who god knows god chose two men peter and paul as the spokesperson for the gospel of jesus christ look at his choice let's look at peter what let's look at peter he's the spokesman for jesus christ it's so shocking isn't it that peter's chosen the one who took up the sword and said lord do we got enough swords he said he said we got two swords the lord he said it's enough right peter when he said he said uh he said i'll go he said i'll even die with you tonight he said before the crows three times you'll deny me i'm sorry before you cross you'll deny me right three times and he cuts off malcus's ear right or marcus's servant's ear jesus heals it and peter runs away only to follow him closely and here's the spokesperson god is going to use god calls this man a man who was surrounded by shame a man who is surrounded by disgrace god redeems this man and makes him a spoke spokesperson for the good news amen always good news to peter the gospel was good news because he could be forgiven praise god amen so look at these people he chose peter a man disgraced right a man totally disgraced and god said i'm going to use that man i'm going to show him grace amen and i'm going to make him my spokesperson that's that's peter that's my man that's my servant that's my apostle to the jews so church don't let your past false linger too long right don't let the devil beat you up with your past faults right if they're confessed it's time to move on it's time to press forward toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus right if anybody could have uh felt bad about their sins it would have been peter i denied the very one who let me walk on water i denied the very one who healed the sick and healed my wife i'm sorry no heal my mother-in-law right peter's mother-in-law was healed of a fever he denied the one that healed her and jesus still says if you love me feed my sheep feed my lambs i'm sending you to the lost sheep of the house of israel and remember he was boasting he was a braggart church but none of us have ever bragged before right none of us have ever been prideful right nobody's nobody's out there has ever thought they could do anything on their own without god's help no one's we're just all humble all the time right total humility all the time i don't think so god chose a boaster who denied him and cussed and swore god said i'm gonna forgive that man i'm gonna make him my spokesperson to the jews why church because weakness christ's strength is magnified when i'm weak then i'm strong yep that's who that's who jesus chose that cussing preacher that bragging preacher that boastful preacher god chose him he said i'm going to transform peter's soul with the baptism of the holy ghost i'm going to make him my uh spokesperson on the day of pentecost i'm going to birth my church using the lips of someone who used to deny me that's god's choice we shouldn't be surprised church of god's choice today people that made big mistakes right people that just made awful decisions maybe they made awful decisions in the past they brought a bunch of disgrace upon the gospel but yet god can forgive them and god can still do great things with them how many appreciate god's grace look who god chose peter boasting cursing can i say this running deserting he's a deserter remember we talked about the word apostasy that means the desert peter had deserted the message i'll say it like that he deserted the great shepherd and yet god still had mercy on him and redeemed him is there hope for you and i church absolutely no matter is there hope for the ones that besides this is there hope for the ones who've left us absolutely i don't know only god knows how far they can go but is there hope for them yeah as long as there's uh as long as uh they haven't crossed that line as long as they haven't got the reprobate mind right there's hope for them god specializes in redeeming the fallen he transforms us from failures to followers praise the lord failures we can fail and just totally fall on our face and god will forgive us of our failures and make us true followers amen this is god's choice this is god's choosing why didn't he choose john do you guys ever think about that why did you john john was at the cross john was more faithful right seemingly more faithful he's the one maokai that's hugging up in jesus's bosom he's trying to get close to him and say oh jesus i love you you're everything to me though and the disciple jesus loved and jesus didn't choose him to be the apostle of the jews he chose peter the boasting one the one who had failures to show the jews that god is a god of mercy praise god he redeems us from our failures he forgives us of our failures and he's faithful and he makes us followers of him someone that would cuss deny and what he tried to kill that guy right he was almost a murderer he almost murdered can you imagine cutting off someone's ear on purpose and that's the kind god said i'm going to make him my spokesman doesn't surprise you after we read about moses right the murderer moses the murder the murderer as simon said who became the meekest the murderer who becomes the meekest so friends children whatever you are in your failures god can turn it completely around and give you a transformation he can forgive your failures and he can set you on the road to a faithful life of service don't let anyone tell you he can't he can definitely do that let me close with paul this will be 45 minutes coming up here my what a thought peter and paul paul a hebrew of hebrews in other words the most serious of jews there was the most zealous of the jews he despised the gentiles right for their uncleanness he would be a completely unlikely choice to open the doors to the gentiles because he despised the gentiles to us it wouldn't be a obvious choice he despised the gentiles he want nothing to do with the gentiles and yet god looks at paul and said i'm going to use him to open the door this steadfast jew i'm going to use him to open the door this clean one to open the door to the unclean what a choice god was all about humbling paul through his conversion he was so smart he could read everything and what did god do what god take away from paul when he saw jesus his eyesight he took away his ability to study the scriptures and to become wise right and to devote himself to reading the word and writing the word god took that away from him to humble him so he could be the right kind of a servant let's remember god may take some things away from us in order for us to follow him and paul didn't have the choice you can say that paul didn't have the choice god chose to take his eyesight away so my my my suggestion or i'll say it like this my command is children serve god before god has to take something away from you praise god remember the creator in the days of your youth praise god remember him now because god took paul's sight away for a few days and then he struggled with it over the remaining decades of his life paul had kept all the traditions all the law so paul's like kind of like the opposite right of peter peter had all these failures right but paul was like he was perfect he was like oh he's like oh he's a perfect man he don't he don't struggle he don't have mind battles he never falls short of god's glory and he he liked it that way he liked to be there he was always there early he was always there late you know he he make sure all the sacrifices were in order zealous he said i was zealous for the law i was zealous for those 613 old testament commandments plus the uh plus the law of the priests right the mishnah the tradition of the the oral tradition of the priests he was zealous for that zeal is for the law and zealous for the man-made traditions the perfect one he's the type a personality but after seeing the grace of jesus christ he said i count all that all the mission and all the man-made ideas not the law now i count all the man-made ideas as done that i might win christ praise the lord and a man glory who wouldn't even go across the street to witness to a gentile before now he crosses the oceans amen ah now he gets in shipwrecks i think he got into five or three shipwrecks wasn't it three or five he would cross great bodies of water he would uh he would he would hazard his life to go save a gentile before he wouldn't care about a gentile but when the power of christ came into his life he was constrained for the rest of his days to go save a gentile soul amen what will god do in your life children what will god do in our lives of adults he'll change our lives he'll transform us by the power of god amen that's how you know you're really born again right because you see the transformation peter saw the transformation i'm angry i'm boastful i'm cussing i'm deserting but now i'm faithful i'm holy right i'm righteous praise god i'm humble amen paul i'm zealous for man i separate myself from the things of the gentiles i won't even talk to a gentile now i'll go to any lengths to save a gentile soul because the gospel light is shine unto me praise god these are the two spokesman's god chooses peter and paul oh my paul violently opposed jesus christ right he would he would break into people's homes imagine someone breaking into your home dragging you off to jail that was paul and now he's knocking trying to get into people's houses to give them the gospel right and now at the end of his life he opens up his door let all the gentiles come on in i'll sit in my hired house i'll teach you the word of god i'm a prisoner of christ these are jesus's choices take the revelation of the mystery to the jews and to the gentiles let's stand to our feet musicians can come sing and pray church think about the transformation jesus wants to do in your life satan is always going to bring up failure failure failure even to me right and even to any of us he's going to try to bring up failure on top of a double failure but that's the beauty of the gospel it's transformation power right it's the power of brother brother ram sermon the power of transformation that's the beauty of the gospel of christ play that little song change my heart oh god let's let's why don't you play that one change my heart oh god make it ever pure [Music] so part of this mystery we can see could god take defile people like gentiles [Music] could god bring filthy dirty diseased people and make them holy could he bring them in to a holy covenant and wash them and make them pure could he transform the unlovable into lovable what's the answer he said i'm going to say to those that i never said you're my beloved i'm going to say you are my beloved [Music] i'm going to say to people that were not my people you are my people hallelujah praise god children you are god's people he wants to transform your lives no matter what you've done in the past you're sincere repent of that god will transform you by the renewing of your mind and that's the power of christianity it's the transforming power from a cussing or from a legalistic person into someone who's so full of grace or do anything to win a soul thank you as we bow our heads how many would raise their eye and say brother pray for me that god can transform my life i want to pray that way too that you know my children never saw me as a sinner you know sometimes that makes me sad yeah i'm so thankful god saved me before they were born but i want to pray lord do something in my life now that my children can see they're transforming in me still and they'll see in one another something like peter something like that [Music] where the transforming power of jesus christ can shine upon our lives let's pray that together heavenly father what amazing grace when this new testament came into fruition lord you chose two of the most unlikely [Music] leaders the ones that would be shouting it and modeling it were failures we're discriminatory we're violent we're foul-mouthed peter we're too prideful stuck in their own ways yet lord despite those failures you saw deep down in their souls that they would love you they would love grace they would love the truth and lord you forgave them of their failures show them their mistakes their sins and you made them followers of the one faith what an encouragement what a picture tonight lord god

course in our lives in our homes in this church lord god fall upon those that are hungry and thirsty for righteousness that we could see your glory we could see your power lord god we could see the
