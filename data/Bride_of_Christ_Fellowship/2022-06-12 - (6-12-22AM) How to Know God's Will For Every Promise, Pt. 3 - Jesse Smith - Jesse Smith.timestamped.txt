[0:00] to uh jeremiah 29 i'd like to go back to
[0:02] this little series here just doing a
[0:04] short series on this
[0:06] how to know god's will for any promise
[0:08] of god we'll look at part three today
[0:11] i just kind of look at the thought of
[0:12] desperation this morning i was
[0:15] we drove about a thousand miles this
[0:16] week you know so a lot of time listening
[0:18] to sermons and uh i was listening to
[0:21] desperation i listened to it twice
[0:22] yesterday while driving just a beautiful
[0:24] message just like to bring out some
[0:25] thoughts
[0:28] from there about how to know god's will
[0:31] for any promise of god
[0:33] jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11.
[0:40] the other man read this scripture and he
[0:42] says
[0:43] isn't that sweet
[0:45] about how sweet god is how kind god is
[0:47] praise god
[0:51] jeremiah 29 11.
[0:57] let's all read verse 11 and then i'll
[0:59] read verses afterwards just for myself
[1:01] but let's just read verse 11 together if
[1:03] we can
[1:04] all three one two three for i know the
[1:07] thoughts that i think toward you saith
[1:09] the lord thoughts
[1:21] i'll read that then shall you call upon
[1:23] me and ye shall go and pray unto me and
[1:26] i will hearken unto you and you shall
[1:28] seek me and find me when ye shall search
[1:31] for me
[1:32] with all your heart and i will be found
[1:34] of you
[1:35] saith the lord praise god my god has
[1:37] blessings
[1:38] reading his word
[1:48] i'd like to look at his thought on how
[1:50] to know god's will
[1:51] for any promise of god
[1:54] i'm just going to review just real
[1:55] briefly part of one and two
[1:58] thank you again for the wonderful
[2:00] service wednesday night
[2:01] yeah
[2:02] i asked simon was it monday
[2:05] sunday night i asked him brother do you
[2:07] think you could come
[2:08] minister and i apologize for the short
[2:10] notice
[2:11] it seems like god just has everything
[2:13] right in time praise god
[2:15] so very thankful for what god
[2:17] did praise god
[2:20] so thank you for amazing
[2:22] uh so we looked at you know a few uh
[2:25] i have some quotes here uh whenever
[2:27] you're ready we looked at some numerous
[2:29] thoughts here on this uh subject here
[2:34] skip down here we've mainly looked at
[2:36] how to know god's will and it of course
[2:38] involves a lot of uh
[2:42] waiting on the lord praise god
[2:45] so i we started off with looking at
[2:47] divine healing and and we kind of went
[2:49] through
[2:50] uh brother graham's
[2:52] suggestions on how to find the will of
[2:54] god for divine healing
[2:56] and so brother and has confessed all
[2:58] sins that's what the book of james says
[3:01] confess your faults one to another pray
[3:03] for another that you may be healed amen
[3:06] so it all starts with confessing and uh
[3:08] sins and
[3:09] you know asking for forgiveness and
[3:10] forgiving others
[3:12] and then we're to ask for god's perfect
[3:14] will in being neutral we're not to tell
[3:17] god what to do and god's not our air and
[3:19] boy
[3:20] god doesn't do what we want him to do
[3:22] god does what he wants to do
[3:24] and so it takes a lot of humility to
[3:26] learn that that we don't
[3:30] we don't tell god what to do you know we
[3:32] have to be patient you know in fact my
[3:33] brother man was preaching a statue of
[3:34] perfect man
[3:35] uh
[3:36] when he got to patients he said let me
[3:38] start with patience he said patience
[3:40] with who patience with god
[3:42] yes
[3:44] so the very first thing he says about
[3:45] being patient is you and i must be
[3:46] patient with god
[3:49] because we feel like you know sometimes
[3:51] we treat our our heavenly father like
[3:52] our natural mother or father like i need
[3:54] it now i got to have it now
[3:56] but god god is divine and god is eternal
[3:59] and god knows the right season when you
[4:01] need that praise god
[4:03] of course you know earthly parents can
[4:04] have a measure of that now that's good
[4:06] brother rams first statement is have
[4:08] patience with god hallelujah
[4:11] and then if god reveals it then you just
[4:13] accept it and you act like it so brother
[4:15] and says even if you're sick and god
[4:17] reveals that you're going to be healed
[4:18] act like you're well that's what i like
[4:20] for jose's testimony amen i've already
[4:22] got a new heart amen i'm already my
[4:23] heart's already back to normal praise
[4:25] god
[4:26] that's beautiful
[4:27] now if it doesn't come or even it does
[4:29] come you have to wait and seek the
[4:30] channel for it to come in it might be
[4:32] through you know the laying out of hands
[4:34] it might be through anointing with oil
[4:36] it might be through a prayer cloth might
[4:38] be through a prayer
[4:40] or a dream
[4:41] uh it might be through a sermon you
[4:43] never know when the answer is going to
[4:44] come praise god but you've got to be
[4:46] patient and wait for the will of god
[4:48] amen
[4:49] so i just want to just briefly hit a few
[4:50] of these here and uh so promises are to
[4:54] those who god ordains in his perfect
[4:56] will and we saw that uh
[4:59] we know we know salvation and divine
[5:01] healing are offered to everybody but not
[5:02] everybody will receive it
[5:04] right amen that's what brother hannah
[5:05] taught us we know we say it's for
[5:07] everybody he says we offered everybody
[5:08] but we know not everybody will receive
[5:10] it yeah right and so you know in my
[5:12] pastoral ministry uh i preach it like uh
[5:15] you know god's promises are to you
[5:18] and god will ordain them in the perfect
[5:20] season of your life amen praise god in
[5:22] other words i wish every time everybody
[5:24] came up for prayer you got exactly what
[5:26] you needed right when you come up yeah
[5:28] right it make me feel good as a pastor
[5:30] but that's not how god works amen
[5:32] god makes us wait praise god god makes
[5:35] us all sweated out a little bit praise
[5:37] to trust him and learn to be patient
[5:39] with him praise god so we're all
[5:40] learning that
[5:41] um
[5:43] and uh
[5:44] i'm just going to skip down here to hit
[5:45] some of the highlights here brother matt
[5:47] says some people have more struggle than
[5:49] others when waiting for the promise of
[5:51] god that's what we're looking at today
[5:52] with desperation i thought i spent more
[5:54] time on that one
[5:58] and then
[6:00] we also looked at
[6:01] love and charity and things like that
[6:03] we're going to look more at that today
[6:05] uh in part one we looked at uh how even
[6:08] if you have the love of god you can hope
[6:10] for any answer to prayer
[6:12] you should you should hope in god the
[6:14] bible said hope maketh not ashamed
[6:17] so we never should feel bad when we're
[6:19] hoping for god to move we should never
[6:21] be ashamed of that praise god
[6:23] in fact the bible says if we're hoping
[6:24] the right way the bible says the
[6:26] strength of the lord will be renewed in
[6:28] us like an ego amen amen
[6:30] praise god amen
[6:32] that's when the strength comes like an
[6:33] ego as you're waiting as you're learning
[6:36] to trust in jehovah god amen right
[6:38] that's when it comes
[6:39] praise god and we saw all the great
[6:41] miracles god's been doing among us
[6:42] lately the testimony three four five six
[6:45] just seven of them right there
[6:47] and then also my wife oh she's not in
[6:49] here uh
[6:50] did i tell you this did she testify
[6:52] about god healing her knee
[6:55] okay so when brother brian was here my
[6:56] wife and had uh
[6:58] brian hawkins my wife had knee pain for
[7:00] a while
[7:02] and uh was just concerned about it
[7:04] and i said i said something been passing
[7:06] like maybe we'll go to the doctor or
[7:07] something like that
[7:10] that's what i would do you know what
[7:11] normally most of us would do and we got
[7:13] a pain and go see what the doctor says
[7:14] he'll give you the natural uh remedy
[7:16] right but then god would give the
[7:17] supernatural one praise god
[7:19] nothing wrong with going to the doctor
[7:20] but in fact you should first go to the
[7:22] doctor but iran says that you should go
[7:24] to the doctor
[7:25] but then anyway you know my wife was
[7:27] listening to brother brian preach
[7:29] and this truly is i would just say this
[7:30] is truly a blessing as well because you
[7:32] know if you have little children it's
[7:33] even hard to hear any of the sermon
[7:36] any moms can say man out there
[7:38] we got the little ones i mean the real
[7:40] little ones
[7:41] well anyways in the very few words that
[7:43] she actually heard of the service
[7:45] brian ryan said something about divine
[7:47] healing she came up for prayer
[7:49] and she said it hurt you know just even
[7:51] to sit down and
[7:53] just sit in different positions it would
[7:55] always hurt and she said after brother
[7:57] brian prayed the next day it was almost
[7:59] gone and now all the pain's completely
[8:00] gone
[8:02] so i could add an eighth uh eight
[8:03] testimony up there thank you for that
[8:05] right now
[8:06] [Applause]
[8:09] so again it's in god's time and season
[8:11] right it's in god's time in season i'm
[8:13] just gonna
[8:14] uh you know we prove our love to jesus
[8:16] by no matter what the situation we give
[8:18] them glory and then we looked at last
[8:19] time how we must get in the spirit right
[8:21] if we want to know god's will get in the
[8:23] spirit and we found that
[8:25] seeking god is actually the answer to
[8:27] every question in our lives how many can
[8:29] say men do that
[8:31] you know as a preacher you know
[8:33] you always want new thoughts like fresh
[8:34] thoughts you know for the people but
[8:36] ultimately it's always going to come
[8:38] down to this praise god it's always
[8:40] going to come down to if i want to know
[8:41] god's will if i want to hear god's voice
[8:45] i've got to seek god
[8:47] i've got to set my face
[8:49] towards god and i must seek god
[8:51] amen that's really what the answer comes
[8:53] down you know we talked about over the
[8:55] years you know the different
[8:56] special meetings churches have uh the
[8:58] conferences they have the youth meetings
[9:00] they have and people have all these
[9:02] wonderful supernatural things but
[9:04] ultimately ultimately it comes out of
[9:06] this each person has to repent of their
[9:08] sins and get and seek god and then in
[9:10] seeking god now many times god will
[9:12] answer those requests because people
[9:13] make such great sacrifices to go to
[9:15] those special meetings
[9:16] right right they'll cross states they'll
[9:19] cross the nation they'll cross some of
[9:20] them will go continents
[9:23] uh like that one uh florence sherlock uh
[9:27] foreign talked about what's her
[9:29] what is that full name of that
[9:32] foreign i can't think of the name but
[9:34] anyways the woman who's like a skeleton
[9:35] on the picture right
[9:37] her family had to take her uh was it
[9:40] south africa
[9:42] or it's nightingale sherlock yeah that's
[9:43] right
[9:44] of course
[9:45] that's right thank you and then the
[9:47] picture of her she looks like an
[9:48] absolute skeleton she was 30 pounds as a
[9:50] woman
[9:52] and brother brandon had to make a stop
[9:53] in england and they brother brother ram
[9:55] said tell brother bosworth i can't go
[9:58] see her there it is yeah yeah hold it up
[10:00] can you everybody look at that that
[10:01] really skinny woman right there who was
[10:03] dying brother jose he's always got the
[10:05] pictures good job
[10:07] he probably got an eagle belt buckle on
[10:08] this morning too right now
[10:13] yeah yeah that one did too
[10:15] i think it was she's from south africa
[10:17] we're not mistaken
[10:20] brother was in england that's when he
[10:21] prayed for the king of england oh wow
[10:23] yeah she was 30 pounds and then six
[10:25] months later
[10:26] she said brother branham can you come to
[10:28] south africa and he's like i can't
[10:30] because he had all these
[10:31] meetings scheduled there
[10:33] in uh in england
[10:35] and uh
[10:36] so her family paid for her to fly up on
[10:39] a cot yes they flew all the way from
[10:42] south africa across the continent up
[10:43] into
[10:44] uh england right and you know the story
[10:46] man goes out to pray for her
[10:48] he goes to the window i guess and a dove
[10:51] comes by you know yeah amen i've had
[10:53] that one time i'd come vibrate and i
[10:55] preached there in uh
[10:56] trinidad and we had a real holy ghost
[10:58] move that was just a real it was it came
[11:00] the night before so i knew what to
[11:01] preach the next day priest on the holy
[11:02] ghost
[11:04] tremendous move of god i still got the
[11:05] video of it actually
[11:07] but a dove came down and brother man got
[11:09] the word of the lord she's going to be
[11:10] well and look since she gained over 100
[11:12] some pounds she was dying i think it was
[11:13] tuberculosis and i was thinking god
[11:15] really gave brother man a favor with
[11:16] tuberculosis you know in terms of god
[11:18] will give us favor with different issues
[11:20] as well
[11:21] maybe it's for divine healing or
[11:22] miracles or
[11:24] or deliverance from addictions you know
[11:26] god will give us special miracles as
[11:28] well praise god
[11:30] because god gives us gifts and gives us
[11:32] those gifts to benefit his people the
[11:33] gifts are not for us they're for other
[11:35] people praise god amen
[11:38] but we find then the answer as we looked
[11:40] at to finding any promise of god was
[11:43] seeking god the bible like god said
[11:46] when it's time you will go out and seek
[11:48] me now that has to mean go out and of
[11:50] course go out of babylon in this case
[11:52] but for us it's gonna have to go out of
[11:54] our normal routine of life
[11:56] and as i said not miss church right but
[11:59] don't skip church to go out and see god
[12:01] because god wants you in church amen
[12:03] that's where god's going to speak to you
[12:04] as well praise god
[12:06] but in your in your time between church
[12:08] that's when you go out and seek god and
[12:10] that's when he'll be found of you and we
[12:12] found our brother and in three cases
[12:14] went and sought the lord and he got
[12:16] answers the first one was where why are
[12:18] these visions coming are they from the
[12:20] devil and he went out to the cave and
[12:21] the angel lord showed him the scriptures
[12:23] how this is how visions come visions
[12:26] come from the lord and like jesus he
[12:28] said i do nothing except the father
[12:30] shows me first amen amen amen so that
[12:32] answered that he sought god and you know
[12:34] he told his wife meeta he said i may die
[12:37] i'm going to stay out there if god don't
[12:38] answer me i'm going to die
[12:40] and that's desperation
[12:42] i have to know why these visions are
[12:44] happening so god had allowed god to
[12:46] allow the course of his life to just
[12:48] have such situation after situation
[12:50] where he he's desperate it's life or
[12:52] death
[12:54] and god had allowed that
[12:55] but many times we see those situations
[12:57] that's when god will show up amen that's
[12:59] right amen
[13:00] that is part of your testimony then if
[13:03] god's bringing to what we would call a
[13:05] breaking point if god's bringing you to
[13:07] a breaking point then that's part of the
[13:08] purpose of life amen that's your time to
[13:11] know that god is going to be there god's
[13:13] going to help you and god's going to
[13:14] guide you and god's going to show you
[13:16] the answers to your heart amen
[13:17] [Music]
[13:19] because god amen you there your
[13:21] footsteps are order of the lord
[13:22] hallelujah amen
[13:24] unless you're choosing your own path and
[13:26] then repent praise god then get back in
[13:27] god's path amen very easy to do
[13:33] and so the second one then uh
[13:36] was when he went to the mission walker
[13:38] people when he saw two men speaking in
[13:39] tongues and interpret one was a real man
[13:41] of god one was an adulterer yeah
[13:43] and
[13:44] i said i understand this and we saw it
[13:46] three times the wind blew the bible open
[13:48] to hebrews chapter six i wonder why the
[13:50] wind's blowing
[13:51] i'll just read this okay oh go back to
[13:53] hebrews six and the third time the third
[13:55] time he got to hebrews six he said there
[13:57] it is yes he said it's like thorns right
[14:00] it's like goodly herbs and thorns both
[14:02] receive the word of god
[14:04] both receive the blessings of god amen
[14:07] and then his question is answered amen
[14:09] now he can discern he said the rain
[14:11] falls on the just and the unjust then he
[14:13] can preach anointed ones at the end time
[14:15] amen a great revelation from god
[14:18] and then thirdly was with the seven
[14:20] seals
[14:22] for a whole week he started with god at
[14:24] brother banks woods house and all he did
[14:26] was eat light and he would just study
[14:28] and pray and he said i would have made a
[14:30] horrible mistake on the seals if it
[14:32] wasn't for the holy spirit coming in
[14:33] about noon time amen
[14:35] church how many times would we make a
[14:37] horrible mistake if god doesn't
[14:39] intervene in our lives
[14:40] that's right he was filled with the holy
[14:42] ghost he was saved he's a prophet he had
[14:43] numerous visions yes but he was going to
[14:45] make a horrible mistake if god didn't
[14:47] intervene but what he had to do he had
[14:49] to shut himself in with god seek god and
[14:51] then the holy ghost came to direct him
[14:53] amen amen
[14:55] so seeking god is always the answer
[14:59] it might be seeking god up here in
[15:00] prayer
[15:01] right it might be seeking god in your
[15:02] home
[15:04] the more the better i'll just say it
[15:06] like that
[15:06] the more you see god the better off
[15:08] you'll be the more answers you'll have
[15:09] to your questions praise god because
[15:12] remember in that sermon now i'm going to
[15:13] just look at a few thoughts here
[15:17] god allows the struggle to bring out
[15:19] your true character
[15:23] okay so you're you're going to have
[15:25] trials you're going to have difficult
[15:26] times and you wonder why it's happening
[15:29] but really we shouldn't wonder because
[15:31] god is he's just allowing you to
[15:33] manifest what's on the inside of your
[15:35] life that's right amen praise god
[15:38] that's right
[15:39] he's writing his story
[15:42] hallelujah he's the author and finisher
[15:45] of your life story praise god amen
[15:48] and he's writing a story
[15:50] and so the the the trials of life to
[15:53] know the will of god to not make sure
[15:55] you're obeying the will of god that it's
[15:57] a story and god's allowing the trials to
[15:59] bring out you know whenever the
[16:01] stressful times the movies come or the
[16:02] shows that's that's the most exciting
[16:04] part
[16:05] now for us it's not exciting to go
[16:07] through the trials i wish it was i wish
[16:09] we heard an instrumental in the
[16:10] background like oh it's building and
[16:12] pretty soon we're going to get the
[16:13] victory but sometimes it's years
[16:17] sometimes we wait years today
[16:20] we think the crescendo is pretty soon oh
[16:22] we're going to get the victory that's
[16:23] going to be this special meetings going
[16:24] in
[16:25] sometimes they come and go
[16:28] and we're still waiting
[16:30] but the idea is to trust in god oh you
[16:33] know i was looking at brother graham he
[16:34] waited eight years to get his promised
[16:35] joseph
[16:37] i believe joseph's off the word but he's
[16:39] still a good good good man it seems to
[16:40] be
[16:42] eight years
[16:43] and he had uh he had a child in between
[16:46] there sarah yeah
[16:48] so after about four years he thought oh
[16:51] here it is she's pregnant oh it's gonna
[16:52] be a boy and then it was sarah he's like
[16:55] i love her with all my heart
[16:57] and then at that time he thought well
[16:59] maybe billy paul is my joseph i got it
[17:01] on tape yeah yeah he said well billy
[17:03] paul's my joseph because there's not the
[17:05] lord's going to come soon there wouldn't
[17:07] be enough time for this child if it was
[17:09] a boy to raise up and preach anyway
[17:12] but four years later
[17:14] hallelujah glory four years later and
[17:18] people made further around the country
[17:20] and mocked him and said oh you met
[17:21] josephine you know that
[17:23] he said that man died that said that
[17:25] yeah that man died at my ground
[17:28] but four years later she's pregnant
[17:30] again she's like bill is it going to be
[17:32] a boy i don't know i don't know all i
[17:34] know is god's going to give me a joseph
[17:37] eight years amen
[17:39] i was telling brother amen you know with
[17:40] our church i told him this last week i'd
[17:42] always wonder why is our church so small
[17:43] i wonder that for many years
[17:45] probably since we started
[17:47] 2006
[17:48] all the way up to about 2019 if i'm not
[17:50] mistaken
[17:51] so 13 years i waited why would we have
[17:53] such a small church why is there
[17:55] something wrong with me something wrong
[17:56] with me
[17:57] and that's when god brought in brother
[17:58] ray
[17:59] to give us that word of the lord god
[18:01] brought him in and said i got a word of
[18:02] the lord for you god's keeping your
[18:04] church small to protect you and your
[18:05] family
[18:06] and of course all the saints
[18:08] and god gave a vindication to his sister
[18:10] lydia that it was right
[18:13] and now i can see that god is protecting
[18:14] us
[18:16] right guys god has been very gracious to
[18:18] us praise god
[18:20] let me just say this i'm just going to
[18:21] add a little personal i'm going to add a
[18:22] personal thought here i'm glad we have
[18:24] our own church because
[18:26] some of the churches around here i love
[18:27] a lot of people and i love i mean
[18:28] there's a lot of denominationals around
[18:30] here but
[18:31] the church is within you know numerous
[18:33] hours of us
[18:34] as i've learned to grow
[18:36] as i learned the word and things like
[18:38] that i just couldn't agree with some of
[18:39] their teachings
[18:42] i just couldn't agree i i don't know how
[18:44] in the world i could sit under that some
[18:45] of the things they believe
[18:48] now maybe that's just because i'm
[18:49] dogmatic
[18:51] maybe i don't know
[18:52] but what i just thought yesterday i'm so
[18:55] thankful because some things
[18:58] even like with interracial marriage bro
[18:59] that's one example can you imagine
[19:01] i mean i could not sit under that i'd
[19:02] have to i started my own church that's
[19:04] what we did
[19:06] but we started before we even knew we
[19:07] needed it
[19:08] praise god we started it for the sake of
[19:10] family members getting saved like who
[19:12] amen
[19:13] she's the very purpose we started this
[19:15] church right
[19:16] so our family members would get saved
[19:18] amen amen
[19:20] and because it was hard to drive three
[19:21] hours with one with children crying in
[19:23] the car the whole time
[19:24] every sunday it's hard to do that
[19:26] but as time has gone on i've seen
[19:28] different things and i love everybody
[19:30] and i'm respectful of it but there's
[19:32] just been so many things rise up i'm
[19:34] like i'm thankful we have our own church
[19:35] praise god
[19:37] because when you look to the word of god
[19:38] i see certain things and people might
[19:40] not see it and
[19:42] but all i can see is the revelation god
[19:44] gave to his prophet in the bible praise
[19:46] god
[19:47] hallelujah
[19:49] and so our trial so i waited about 13
[19:51] years to get the answer for that one at
[19:52] church i would lay here i would lay
[19:54] there i would lay and cry and say god
[19:55] what's wrong
[19:57] what's wrong with me and the whole time
[19:58] nothing's wrong with me god was trying
[20:00] to protect me
[20:02] for 13 years i discussed it like that 13
[20:04] years i sweated it out
[20:06] is it me am i wrong maybe maybe i
[20:09] shouldn't make youtube videos right
[20:11] maybe i shouldn't do that am i wrong
[20:14] maybe i'm off the word and the whole
[20:15] time it wasn't me wrong it was god wants
[20:18] to protect me so i can serve him with my
[20:20] full focus right so we can be on fire
[20:22] for god amen so we can do what's right
[20:24] and god wants to protect his people and
[20:26] we want to be in the center of god's
[20:27] nail scarred hand amen
[20:30] hallelujah
[20:31] because if you have big churches big
[20:33] problems
[20:34] big problems little church is little
[20:36] problems so thank god for that
[20:39] but you know brother adam says it you
[20:40] know in in desperation
[20:44] it brings out the real thing that you
[20:46] are it shows what you're made of
[20:50] in the time of desperation it usually
[20:51] pulls out all the good things that's in
[20:53] you
[20:54] now we had a desperate moment on
[20:55] vacation poor haven
[20:58] haven was just playing with the horse or
[21:00] not playing with the horse loving the
[21:02] horse and the horse head butt haven
[21:05] and as she got five stitches right there
[21:07] and you should have saw i mean her shirt
[21:08] was covered in blood i had never seen
[21:10] anything like that
[21:13] and you know we were all shook up but
[21:14] you know what right before i went
[21:16] christian got her in the car i said
[21:17] let's pray
[21:19] you guys remember that i said
[21:22] it's a moment of desperation
[21:24] all right let's pray and we didn't know
[21:26] which exactly which hospital to go to
[21:27] but we went with the one that was
[21:28] highest rated on on the internet
[21:30] that's a good suggestion maybe next time
[21:32] remember that my god's grace go to the
[21:34] higher rated place
[21:36] because they're real professional amen
[21:38] so they got there after an hour driving
[21:40] there and walked right in there was no
[21:41] waiting line at that hospital got in
[21:43] there the doctors were really good uh
[21:45] the woman who did the stitch has been
[21:47] there for 35 years
[21:50] but it was a moment of desperation like
[21:51] what happened is she okay we've never
[21:53] seen all this i mean the blood was
[21:54] everywhere i mean
[21:57] i got the pictures i'm going to see it
[21:58] afterwards i actually want to put it up
[21:59] there
[22:01] but then
[22:03] i seen in that moment that we had we had
[22:05] the leaning to pray
[22:08] not get all upset and all angry but i
[22:10] saw the holy spirit give us a leadership
[22:12] to pray and then god provided for all
[22:14] the needs amen
[22:15] now we're tested on that constantly are
[22:17] we
[22:18] there's situations we go through every
[22:20] week where this is emergent it seems
[22:21] like an emergency
[22:23] but all these
[22:25] happen to us to bring out what's really
[22:27] inside of us amen
[22:30] praise god amen
[22:34] now uh i just had this thought uh if you
[22:36] would go to first corinthians 13.
[22:39] i want to lay this in here before i move
[22:40] on
[22:42] first grab these 13 because we end up
[22:43] with this thought
[22:44] and then i'll get to the next one
[22:50] first three is 13.
[22:56] now what happened shirts in the moment
[22:58] of desperation our minds are going crazy
[23:02] our human thoughts are like well what
[23:04] about this what about that what about
[23:05] that what about this
[23:07] so we've got to
[23:09] be still for a moment and start living
[23:12] and start thinking from the soul
[23:15] if that's the best way i can say it
[23:18] we have so many thoughts what's going to
[23:19] happen oh no i mean i had lots of
[23:21] thoughts about haven't but thank god
[23:22] she's okay
[23:23] no concussion no vomiting and there's
[23:25] all god's breaks all god's face
[23:27] about all these thoughts is she injured
[23:29] forever you know what's going on i mean
[23:30] all these thoughts
[23:32] but then you gotta like stop and pause
[23:33] and and realize okay i'm thinking with
[23:35] my mind what's my soul say
[23:38] i need i need to know god's word amen
[23:42] right and so that that
[23:44] that's uh our desire as christians to
[23:47] mature so in those moments of emergency
[23:50] we can be settled amen the holy spirit
[23:52] can settle us and we can look to him for
[23:54] help praise god
[23:56] for his inspiration
[23:59] now we know verses 1 through 3 really
[24:00] well in other words
[24:02] you can know all the mysteries god said
[24:04] brother but without love doesn't profit
[24:06] you know yeah yeah
[24:07] it doesn't mean you're saved you know
[24:09] yeah i heard brother say yesterday on
[24:10] desperations oh no i'm sorry it was uh
[24:13] the token uh but random said you say
[24:15] well i believe everything you say but i
[24:17] said that's good that's just being able
[24:18] to read but that's still not having the
[24:20] token right you can believe everything
[24:22] he said and that doesn't mean you're
[24:23] born again yeah right
[24:25] right because you have a wrong slant to
[24:26] it or you could have your own selfish
[24:28] motive or to believe in that way you can
[24:30] worship brother random more than jesus
[24:32] that's a sin awful sin of idolatry yep
[24:35] right so we're familiar with that but
[24:36] verse four now here's what we're getting
[24:38] to with waiting
[24:39] to know god's will for your life charity
[24:42] suffers long
[24:44] now my suffering of 13 years is small
[24:46] compared to some of these people that
[24:47] suffer they're starving
[24:50] like in uganda they're starving
[24:52] so in other words my spiritual suffering
[24:55] is nothing i don't think compared to the
[24:56] spirit the natural
[25:00] that's just my humble opinion
[25:01] because when was the last time you went
[25:03] without a couple meals
[25:04] how did you feel
[25:06] most of us have never done it
[25:08] right i just want to say that some of
[25:09] these
[25:10] tests we have i mean we call it
[25:12] suffering but it's just a small degree
[25:14] of suffering
[25:15] let's be humble praise god let's be home
[25:16] amen right
[25:18] but charity suffers longer so if you
[25:20] have the love of god you can suffer long
[25:23] and charity is kind
[25:26] hallelujah
[25:27] charity end me if not it doesn't look on
[25:29] others and i'm gonna have what they have
[25:33] that's not god's love
[25:35] see because you want to know the will of
[25:36] god right charity vaunteth not itself it
[25:39] doesn't prop up itself it's not puffed
[25:41] up or prideful
[25:43] that's why i'm glad we're preaching on
[25:45] overcoming the sin of pride amen
[25:47] but william i showed the church a few
[25:49] months ago or last month all the pre all
[25:52] these major preachers calling themselves
[25:53] the greatest of all time brother ram
[25:55] said don't you never do that
[25:57] it was shocking i shared with cam they
[25:59] were camp church they were shocked
[26:02] because that's what everybody wants to
[26:04] be the greatest but that's selfish
[26:07] jesus never said make yourself great
[26:09] jesus said make yourself a servant
[26:10] praise god
[26:12] hallelujah
[26:15] verse 5 does not behave itself unseemly
[26:18] seeketh not her own that's that's
[26:21] that's a real spirit of love there love
[26:23] doesn't seek its own desires or
[26:26] interests love seeks other people's
[26:28] interests
[26:29] but see but we got we still have our own
[26:31] needs we still have interest like we
[26:33] still need a house in life we still need
[26:34] a car we still need a job we still need
[26:36] all these things but love will seek
[26:38] others interests
[26:40] as well
[26:41] amen
[26:43] we have natural then we have to have the
[26:45] spiritual we must spiritually try to
[26:47] meet the needs of other people as well
[26:48] and natural needs
[26:50] now notice it's not easily provoked and
[26:52] thinketh no evil
[26:53] [Music]
[26:56] so let's use that like i'm seeking god's
[26:58] will we have to remember will god allow
[27:00] this obstacle not to have evil against
[27:02] me but to teach me something
[27:05] gotta allow this trial in my life not
[27:07] because it's evil not because god's
[27:08] angry with me i've repented of all my
[27:10] sins i'm trying to serve god the best i
[27:12] know how but god allow this trial i'm
[27:15] not allowed for my good as we saw on
[27:17] wednesday our last sunday praise god
[27:19] god allows everything and always for our
[27:22] good amen
[27:23] always the bible says in deuteronomy
[27:25] always everything is always for our good
[27:28] hallelujah
[27:29] it's always working out to make us more
[27:31] humble more like jesus more more spirit
[27:34] of god flowing through us amen amen it's
[27:36] always working out that way
[27:41] it's always working out that way
[27:43] the love of god is gonna we're gonna
[27:45] learn to surrender more and the love of
[27:47] god will flow through us
[27:49] hallelujah
[27:54] i love verse 6 rejoice is not iniquity
[27:56] but rejoices in the truth
[27:59] see the love of god wants to know the
[28:00] truth whether it hurts me whether it
[28:02] humbles me whether it rebukes me i would
[28:04] know the truth praise god
[28:06] that's the love of god
[28:10] verse seven now here's here's where we
[28:12] got to you last lesson
[28:13] love will bear all trials
[28:17] it will believe all things
[28:19] it will hold all things
[28:21] it will endure all things
[28:24] praise god
[28:26] so when life gets hard and you wonder
[28:28] how am i going to make it through how am
[28:30] i going to make it through this how in
[28:32] the world can we get through this how in
[28:33] the world am i going to get through this
[28:35] love is the answer
[28:37] hey man i'll say it again
[28:39] love is the answer amen
[28:42] your love for god and what's greater
[28:44] than that is god's love for us amen amen
[28:47] that will get us through the hard times
[28:49] amen amen god's love gets us through
[28:51] that
[28:52] then we can know the will of god
[28:54] right god's making me wait well it's
[28:56] cause he loves me
[28:58] if i had it now i'd probably squatter
[29:02] right
[29:02] god's making me wait
[29:04] because he loves me
[29:07] like i told you something from last
[29:08] sunday i'm waiting for my mom and dad
[29:10] you know
[29:11] different times i pray for them i'm
[29:12] still waiting for those prayer requests
[29:14] to come to pass some of them are 30
[29:16] years old prayer requests
[29:18] i've been praying for them since i was a
[29:20] child amen
[29:22] we're still waiting on it praise god but
[29:24] i can remember even though god hasn't
[29:25] heard my prayers i can remember god
[29:27] still loves me
[29:29] god's working this out for my good he's
[29:30] trying to teach me something praise god
[29:35] i love this charity never
[29:38] fails i'm going to pause i'm going to
[29:40] move on then from that one now i got a
[29:42] scripture let's go to galatians i
[29:43] believe it's galatians
[29:45] i'm going to look it up real quick
[29:47] because this thought just came to me
[29:54] yeah galatians 5 6 there it is thank you
[29:58] brother i made a statement in the
[29:59] desperations
[30:02] he says uh the love of god will make you
[30:04] desperate brother brahma says i know
[30:06] that quote on here but um but says
[30:09] if you have the love of god it will make
[30:11] you desperate
[30:12] for god's will yeah
[30:14] right for god's will
[30:18] now i'm gonna get to this but i gotta
[30:19] get to the balance like for example i
[30:21] shouldn't be desperate every single day
[30:22] like pray for me lydia it's monday
[30:24] morning pray for me pray for me brother
[30:26] eight minutes wednesday night you know
[30:29] so we gotta have a balance so i've got
[30:30] to have some maturity
[30:34] if you listen to desperation you would
[30:35] think like you got to be desperate for
[30:36] everything like desperate for a meal
[30:38] yeah we know we're going to go order it
[30:39] on chipotle or something like that but
[30:41] oh god i need a meal like you know
[30:44] there's a balance to it because it's all
[30:46] about god's time and season for
[30:47] desperation
[30:51] uh galatians 5 6 i'm sorry
[30:54] for in jesus christ neither circumcision
[30:56] avails anything nor uncertain
[30:58] uncircumcision but faith which works by
[31:01] love amen so the first thing we got to
[31:03] have is love
[31:05] love for god and brother anderson i like
[31:06] how he says it he says love will go grab
[31:08] a hold of faith's hand and say come on
[31:10] let's go out and meet the enemy
[31:12] [Applause]
[31:14] i love that amen because love or faith
[31:16] works by love
[31:18] so love will grab a hold of hey
[31:20] we trust god let's now let's let's take
[31:23] some faith out there let's take some
[31:25] trust right we love god we can trust god
[31:27] now we'll go act on the word of god now
[31:29] we'll go out to battle the enemies
[31:31] praise god
[31:32] that's work
[31:33] faith works by love so love grabs hold
[31:36] of faith dancing come on let's go out to
[31:38] the enemy let's go out there oh my you
[31:40] got faith and love together praise god
[31:42] something's gonna happen the works of
[31:43] god are gonna happen again
[31:46] that's how works happen in your life
[31:48] that's how you do good works it starts
[31:49] with love
[31:51] love moves faith and faith causes you to
[31:53] work
[31:54] hallelujah
[31:58] the problem says the love of god will
[31:59] make you desperate
[32:01] but of course again it's not every
[32:03] single minute an hour of your life
[32:07] but there's seasons and times of your
[32:09] life that can i say like this you were
[32:12] born for that's right nobody else can do
[32:15] it just you amen
[32:17] you were born for a certain time there
[32:18] are certain times of your life scenes of
[32:21] your life nobody else can obey this word
[32:24] or nobody else can bring this word to
[32:25] fast except
[32:26] you and it's your purpose in your life
[32:29] god has a purpose for everybody and when
[32:32] god brings you those moments of
[32:33] desperation that's the time to trust god
[32:35] that's the time to cry out to god that's
[32:37] the time to see god amen
[32:40] that's what they always did in the bible
[32:41] amen brother list many examples i'm
[32:43] going to show just i'm going to briefly
[32:44] show you something he just listens all
[32:46] these girls it's like from boom boom
[32:48] boom boom he's going to give you some
[32:49] bible examples of desperation right
[32:52] he could have used every person in the
[32:54] bible
[32:55] right
[32:57] you could have used every every single
[32:59] person every godly person in the bible
[33:02] but let's just define this so brother
[33:04] brahm defines desperation
[33:07] as a state of emergency or urgency
[33:11] now we're going to talk about
[33:12] desperations usually it takes a state of
[33:14] emergency to throw us into desperation
[33:20] it's too bad it has to do that but
[33:22] human beings are so slawful in their
[33:24] mind and the church said amen amen right
[33:26] i'm saying amen too
[33:28] brother jesse is lawful in his mind many
[33:31] times
[33:33] that it takes an emergency so god knows
[33:35] brother jess probably is going to move
[33:37] here so i've got to bring an emergency
[33:39] in his life
[33:40] then he'll move
[33:42] hallelujah
[33:44] right
[33:45] many times that happens in our lives
[33:48] we won't make a decision unless god kind
[33:50] of pushes the issue a little bit
[33:54] something will arise and when they do it
[33:55] throws them into that desperation and
[33:58] really in doing that desperation it
[33:59] brings out the real thing you are as we
[34:01] read this earlier that part it shows
[34:03] what you're made of in the time of
[34:04] desperation usually pulls out all the
[34:06] good things that's in you
[34:10] and then he says later until you get to
[34:12] that place until the whole church gets
[34:13] that place that's between death and life
[34:15] you've got to have it now or perish then
[34:18] god will move on the scene it takes
[34:19] desperation to bring god on the scene
[34:21] now we know there's a balance of that
[34:22] too as we said on wednesday sometimes
[34:24] god answered prayer without much
[34:25] desperation
[34:28] but there's going to be times in our
[34:29] lives where god is going to bring us to
[34:30] a place where we feel like it's either
[34:32] life or death i've got to have it now
[34:36] and that's the time to seek the lord
[34:39] so this is our program defines
[34:40] desperation it's urgency
[34:43] it's an emergency i've got to have it
[34:46] and many times it's in a case where we
[34:49] want to know the will of god like the
[34:50] bible examples we'll get to like jacob
[34:52] and ruth and different ones down in the
[34:54] bible
[34:56] but i want to also bring out this
[34:57] balance just to show the sovereignty of
[34:59] god in other words god is the author of
[35:01] your whole life god is the author behind
[35:04] everything that happens in your life
[35:06] that's right
[35:07] that's right so brother said god has to
[35:09] ordain the desperation
[35:12] and the faith you need in the
[35:14] desperation praise god
[35:16] that's right that's right god has to get
[35:18] involved amen that's right
[35:21] in other words this should make us trust
[35:22] god more yeah
[35:24] this should make us love god more
[35:26] hallelujah
[35:27] and god brought me to this court because
[35:29] that is with moses god brought me this
[35:31] red sea again
[35:33] god brought me here if god brought me
[35:34] here he'll make the way through amen
[35:37] [Applause]
[35:38] that's how it is for every desperate
[35:40] situation we go to that's right now we
[35:43] don't always get the answer we want
[35:45] right
[35:46] but god is bringing us to desperate
[35:47] places
[35:48] so we'll seek after him in those moments
[35:50] of desperation
[35:53] because church is not even your faith
[35:55] that's going to move the mountain
[35:57] glory
[35:58] it ain't even your strength
[36:00] all right brothers we're so strong
[36:03] it ain't even your strength you can't do
[36:04] it praise god i can't do it
[36:07] right it's not going to be any of our
[36:09] own faith it has to be jesus faith amen
[36:12] right remember paul said in galatians i
[36:14] don't live by my faith he said i live by
[36:16] the faith of the son of god we're living
[36:18] by jesus faith right now
[36:21] amen
[36:22] hallelujah not my faith my faith will
[36:25] fail because it's intellectual human
[36:27] faith the human faith is well i know my
[36:28] car's gonna go start i'm gonna go with
[36:30] the key and internet it's gonna start
[36:32] that's human faith
[36:34] right
[36:36] but supernatural faith is god's faith
[36:39] taking over
[36:40] you just trust something's going to
[36:42] happen you just believe something's
[36:44] going to happen that's god's faith take
[36:46] it over
[36:48] so this means church if god ordains the
[36:50] desperation the urgency
[36:52] and the faith in the urgency that it's
[36:55] god's ordination for certain seasons of
[36:59] our lives that's right
[37:01] for desperation
[37:03] healings
[37:05] salvation of souls
[37:09] god ordains that
[37:13] so look at the yellow there can we read
[37:15] that
[37:16] you can't be desperate until god speaks
[37:18] to you
[37:19] you can't even do it because you're you
[37:21] and i are so slothful i'm gonna put
[37:23] myself because you and i
[37:25] you and i are so slow so so so slow in
[37:28] our minds
[37:29] slow
[37:30] so slothful
[37:34] we can't even be in a state of
[37:35] desperation until god moves us there
[37:39] god has to orchestrate the situation to
[37:42] move us in there
[37:44] and he says oh church shake yourself
[37:46] pinch yourself
[37:47] and he doesn't say he said something's
[37:49] coming from the lord thus saith the lord
[37:50] he doesn't say what it is
[37:52] you better get desperate between life
[37:54] and death maybe it's the
[37:55] uh laying down or the mark of the beast
[37:57] maybe it's a squeeze i don't know what
[37:58] it was
[37:59] he said but it'll pass through and we
[38:01] won't see it because that
[38:03] okay she wasn't selfish okay that's
[38:04] speaking of hannah we'll get to that in
[38:05] a moment here
[38:06] now again he says this idea of god's
[38:08] going to bring you to it but i said let
[38:10] us pray in desperation watch for the
[38:12] kingdom of god it will come to you
[38:15] see god's going to bring that you to
[38:17] desperation god's gonna bring the
[38:18] kingdom to you amen
[38:21] praise god amen
[38:23] the disciples didn't go looking for
[38:24] jesus jesus came looking for them amen
[38:27] amen
[38:28] praise god paul did not go looking for
[38:30] jesus jesus came and found him amen
[38:34] the kingdom of god came to him
[38:37] in church either whether you were raised
[38:39] in the message or not raising the
[38:40] message the kingdom of god came to you
[38:42] hallelujah
[38:44] amen hallelujah
[38:46] thank god
[38:51] now brotherham says faith this is
[38:52] scriptural
[38:53] faith is a revelation from god now faith
[38:55] is revelation that's where i want to
[38:56] stand there just for a moment it's a
[38:57] revelation he's revealed it to you by
[39:00] what your works
[39:02] by grace
[39:05] it's something you did
[39:06] no
[39:07] it's nothing you did
[39:10] all she did now church really all we do
[39:12] is just surrender and say god i
[39:13] surrender right i repent and then god
[39:15] gives us the gift of faith
[39:17] i mean as far as salvation is concerned
[39:19] you just have to repent and then the
[39:20] gift of god comes
[39:23] and now this speaking of course divine
[39:25] healing you didn't work yourself up into
[39:27] faith
[39:28] you ever have faith it was given to you
[39:31] by the grace of god amen
[39:33] hallelujah
[39:38] god refuses you therefore faith is
[39:39] revelation the whole church is built
[39:42] upon the revelation can i say this
[39:44] that's given by faith
[39:46] and given by grace amen hallelujah amen
[39:52] so see god ordains the the desperation
[39:54] times and he also ordains your faith for
[39:56] those times
[40:00] i'm going to skip down here
[40:03] she's talking about a crippled man
[40:05] the doctor will say there's not even a
[40:07] chance to be healed but if something can
[40:08] tear away them weeds the doctor puts in
[40:10] there you know if god if god by his
[40:12] grace not the preacher
[40:15] well i'll say amen to that amen
[40:18] good oh it's not it's not on me to help
[40:20] everybody get their answers to their
[40:21] request thank god i couldn't do it
[40:22] anyway i failed you a hundred times out
[40:25] of a hundred
[40:26] it's not the preacher it's not anybody
[40:28] else but god
[40:29] can place into your heart a revelation
[40:31] that i'm going to be well there isn't
[40:33] nothing to keep you sitting there
[40:36] there's nothing can hold you there
[40:37] you're going to be well but until that
[40:39] does happen you're going to sit right
[40:40] there where the doctor says you're going
[40:42] to say until that happens it has to be
[40:44] revealed
[40:45] it's the grace of god
[40:47] amen
[40:48] hallelujah praise
[40:50] god just like with paul paul three times
[40:53] heal me in my eyes
[40:55] jesus said my grace is official my grace
[40:57] and submission my gracious division
[41:00] therefore i'll glory my affirmative
[41:02] glory
[41:03] i that i'll be happy amen because the
[41:06] author and finisher of my life is
[41:08] allowing me to go through this to keep
[41:10] me humble amen
[41:15] until it happens
[41:16] we're just gonna wait on god and if
[41:18] we're waiting we might as well be happy
[41:21] rather than angry and bitter
[41:23] and fearful and afraid
[41:25] we might as well be happy praise god
[41:27] because god's in control he's writing my
[41:29] story i'm here for such a time as this
[41:32] amen
[41:33] [Music]
[41:35] and he promised you the same thing
[41:37] if you could believe that it would
[41:39] happen if you can't believe it it just
[41:40] won't happen now see now this shows you
[41:42] got to hope you got to hope for it
[41:44] now i can't make you
[41:46] believe neither can you make yourself oh
[41:49] i wish brother brown was here then i'd
[41:50] believe the third bowl
[41:52] no you've got to believe it
[41:55] god's got to give it you know
[41:57] god's got to give it i'm sorry you can't
[41:58] make it either god's got to give it
[42:01] god has to give it to you it's a gift of
[42:03] god to believe not your faith
[42:06] god's faith
[42:08] hallelujah your intellectual faith might
[42:10] believe it's fine but unless the faith
[42:12] of god is down in your heart see your
[42:13] intellectual faith can accept it do that
[42:15] and just believe in it with all your
[42:16] heart until god does see yeah hear this
[42:18] just keep believing it with all your
[42:20] heart until that's why i said
[42:22] if you don't know god's will just hope
[42:24] for god's will
[42:26] just hope that god's going to do it the
[42:28] way you're desiring it
[42:30] until god does reveal it just keep
[42:33] believing it until god does reveal it
[42:38] so brother man breaks into this sermon
[42:39] here
[42:41] and he goes through
[42:43] these are just the first few there's a
[42:44] bunch after this as well because then he
[42:45] breaks into the new testament believers
[42:47] these are the first few
[42:49] jacob's all-night prayer was in total
[42:51] desperation
[42:53] he was trying to take his family back
[42:55] home to see his you know his his
[42:57] original homeland
[42:59] and then he gets word esau's coming
[43:01] the man who's going to kill me brother
[43:03] graham said it threw him in desperation
[43:05] now look look at the coward he was now
[43:07] we are all cowards i'm not down in jacob
[43:09] but we're all cowards he sends his
[43:11] children first to meet hisself the
[43:12] children
[43:14] who can't eat now they can't even defend
[43:15] themselves
[43:18] so he knows the man's a murderer and so
[43:20] he sends the kids out
[43:21] and then he sends his wives out
[43:26] and then he's all by himself
[43:28] yeah but he was a supplanter he knew he
[43:30] he wasn't israel yet amen he still
[43:33] needed to be born again amen
[43:35] spiritually speaking that's right
[43:37] because the holy ghost cannot be given
[43:38] until he's glorified
[43:40] but see in doing that in the coward
[43:42] state that he was he he find himself god
[43:45] allowed it because he found himself all
[43:47] alone with god
[43:48] that's right then god said it's time for
[43:51] a wrestling match
[43:54] god come down in the angel form amen
[43:58] god come down as an angel and said it's
[44:00] time to wrestle
[44:03] and so he starts wrestling you imagine
[44:04] what god would do like a headlock or
[44:06] something like that ah
[44:08] i got you now jacob
[44:10] you imagine how would god wrestle a man
[44:13] somehow he just he readjusted his hip
[44:15] right right at the end of it all night
[44:18] murmured said he didn't pray he didn't
[44:20] rest him for five minutes he wrestled
[44:21] all night in prayer
[44:23] at church i've never prayed all night in
[44:24] prayer now the one time i was sick with
[44:27] a
[44:30] strep throat i prayed all throughout the
[44:32] night
[44:33] i was saying i'm saying god send me
[44:35] that's the night i passed out
[44:37] i read the other church i passed out and
[44:39] right before the sermon
[44:41] and i was i was trying to speak faith i
[44:43] was trying i was hoping i was going to
[44:44] be healed
[44:46] all night with strep throat it was the
[44:47] worst night of my life i kept saying god
[44:49] send healing i believe you're proud i
[44:50] tried quoting the word of god in and out
[44:52] of sleep all night
[44:54] i woke up i'm like i'll go to church
[44:56] anyway i'll just speak past the symptoms
[44:58] and i got to church and right before
[45:00] church were praying and all of a sudden
[45:01] i'm praying and all of a sudden i saw
[45:02] the light start closing and
[45:07] like 9-1-1 come get the preacher
[45:11] he didn't want to preach today
[45:13] i didn't want to preach today
[45:16] but i'd strep throat and i pushed my
[45:18] body too hard thank god john was there
[45:21] he preached for us
[45:22] i sat in the bed for next three days
[45:25] getting over that strep throat
[45:27] but jacob wrestled all night with god in
[45:30] prayer
[45:31] now this is the very highlight of his
[45:32] entire life
[45:34] because he meets god's face and face and
[45:36] then god tries to leave he said i'll
[45:38] beat you around and i pushed you around
[45:39] a little bit i'm let's go it's about a
[45:40] day break and jacob said no no you're
[45:43] not leaving you're not leaving till you
[45:45] bless me amen
[45:47] i'm finding the presence of god i want a
[45:49] word from god i need to change amen amen
[45:52] amen
[45:53] my friend i'm going to get killed look
[45:55] life and death
[45:56] i'm going to die if god doesn't do
[45:58] something in my heart to take away my
[46:00] fear of my brother
[46:03] and so finally can you imagine you got
[46:04] the angel down the gun
[46:06] bless me angel bless me
[46:09] he said i bless you i'm changing your
[46:11] name to israel amen
[46:21] [Applause]
[46:26] that's the moment of desperation from
[46:27] his life
[46:28] did he have other desperate moments sure
[46:30] he was when the first time he was
[46:31] leaving he had to meet god and he saw
[46:33] god that's jacob's ladder he saw the
[46:35] angels going up and down
[46:37] oh surely this is the presence of the
[46:38] lord here surely this is the house of
[46:40] god
[46:42] but that one moment was the moment of
[46:45] his entire life and then from that
[46:46] moment all the entire genealogy and
[46:49] descendants after him will be named
[46:51] after him amen amen
[46:53] his whole family after him would be
[46:55] named israel praise god amen
[46:59] but god had to bring him to that that's
[47:01] right
[47:04] god had to give him the faith
[47:06] what faith would you need to wrestle an
[47:07] angel all night i get tired after three
[47:11] minutes or two minutes of sparring now
[47:12] kind of had to tie point up i get tired
[47:14] for two minutes i'm like i can't go
[47:16] anymore
[47:17] when's that bell gonna go off give me
[47:19] some water this guy wrestled the angel
[47:22] all night i don't even know what that's
[47:25] like i've never stayed up recently if
[47:26] you stayed up all night anybody just
[47:28] ever stayed up all night a couple people
[47:29] three people four
[47:32] five glory
[47:33] but all night wrestling match that's a
[47:35] different story
[47:37] see the anointing of god was upon him
[47:39] that's the only way we can explain
[47:41] because a normal man couldn't do that
[47:44] and then he finally pins the angel down
[47:46] like you got to bless me
[47:48] this is life or death i'm going to die
[47:49] my family is going to die i need you to
[47:51] give me something
[47:53] and notice he didn't give him a cadillac
[47:57] he didn't give him uh two billion
[47:58] dollars
[47:59] he gave him a name change
[48:01] he gave him a new name he gave him a
[48:03] power authority with god
[48:06] that's what he gave him and he gave the
[48:07] word amen amen amen
[48:09] that's all that's really that's all we
[48:11] need is god's word amen amen that's all
[48:14] we need is god's word
[48:16] to know the will of god for our lives
[48:17] that's right
[48:19] you've been called jacob supplanter
[48:21] deceiver but now you're a different
[48:23] person now you're a prince with god amen
[48:26] that's why i came that's why i wrestled
[48:28] that's why god brought me this
[48:29] desperation so he could change me give
[48:31] me a new walk and now i'm not afraid of
[48:33] my enemies i love my enemies oh god help
[48:35] us amen
[48:37] to love our enemies
[48:41] the man talks about hezekiah sickness
[48:43] now just so you know brother man says
[48:45] you can prevail against god in this
[48:46] sermon other places he says nobody can
[48:48] prevail against god
[48:50] so just say you know
[48:52] right because all a lot of our friends
[48:54] you know worship brother branham or all
[48:55] of our message friends worship brother
[48:57] brandon nobody tells us 1965 god does
[49:00] not change his mind you can't change
[49:02] god's mind he does that and god does not
[49:04] change his mind right
[49:07] he tells us that plainly
[49:08] so brother adam grew in his
[49:09] understanding
[49:11] so what happened with hezekiah
[49:14] he lived such a life of integrity he
[49:15] couldn't he couldn't see himself dying
[49:18] uh he he said lord i need more time to
[49:20] set my house in order and brother ram
[49:22] said in that sermon
[49:24] uh god changed his mind god doesn't
[49:25] change his mind about his work that god
[49:27] got angry after hezekiah stayed because
[49:30] hezekiah opened the door to the
[49:31] babylonians
[49:33] he squandered his extra 15 years
[49:38] but because of his desperation god
[49:39] looked out of desperation and said i'll
[49:41] give you the permissive will if you
[49:43] don't want the perfect will of god
[49:45] just because of desperation
[49:48] now church we were i mean uh remember
[49:49] two sundays ago when we were at the
[49:50] point
[49:52] this sweet little mother i'm just as an
[49:54] example crying out to god the sweet
[49:56] mother last time i was there in may she
[49:58] came up
[49:59] and she prayed for her lost husband that
[50:01] was a year ago so she comes up again
[50:04] this year
[50:05] and she said my husband still hasn't
[50:06] returned i said sister that's right we
[50:07] prayed for you last year right she's
[50:09] like yeah she said my husband and my son
[50:12] have not come back i said have you
[50:13] confessed all your sins she said yes and
[50:15] i started crying i said all i can do
[50:17] then is cry out to god that's right
[50:20] all i can do is be desperate
[50:23] and so i screamed i said what's the name
[50:24] of your husband and what's your name you
[50:25] something you might remember i said
[50:27] what's the name of your husband what's
[50:27] the name of your son
[50:30] so and so i can't remember my name will
[50:31] say jim and joe
[50:32] i just started praying and when i just
[50:34] felt the holy spirit i just screamed out
[50:35] as loud as i can god bring them back
[50:39] because that's all i can do in the
[50:40] moment of desperation god just wants you
[50:42] to hear you cry out
[50:44] now they haven't come back yet but
[50:46] there's been two cases where we have
[50:49] there's more and more than that right
[50:50] three now that austin's back praise god
[50:52] we've tried it there's been three cases
[50:53] we've cried out for other people
[50:55] and they've come back amen
[50:58] like austin
[50:59] i know there's a time i at least cried
[51:00] for you buddy to come back i know that
[51:02] it hadn't been over all those five years
[51:07] the one time was brother randy burton's
[51:09] wife he preached for us that's when
[51:10] eating got healed
[51:11] uh of the fever
[51:14] a beautiful testimony
[51:17] his wife before they got married went
[51:19] out in the world
[51:20] his mother came up for her mother came
[51:22] up for prayer when i was preaching in
[51:23] iowa and she said uh let's pray
[51:26] that god will bring my daughter back she
[51:28] i went out in the world
[51:30] she was a flight attendant
[51:32] so she she was flying on all the planes
[51:35] just enjoying the world
[51:36] and she left the message i said well
[51:37] let's pray right here i remember it just
[51:39] like yesterday we sat on the front row
[51:40] the hotel they were at a church in the
[51:42] hotel and we just prayed we wept and
[51:44] cried i said in the name of jesus christ
[51:46] church within two years she come back to
[51:47] the
[51:48] message and then when brother randy got
[51:51] one
[51:52] said lord let me know if she's the one
[51:53] to marry
[51:54] he said if she's the one let me buy this
[51:56] dress for her and let it perfectly fit
[51:58] her he didn't even know her size
[52:01] now that's
[52:02] desperation and the church said amen
[52:07] you have bought this beautiful dress
[52:09] i'm not sure what can you imagine all
[52:10] the ones on the rack you know they have
[52:11] like small medium large or whatever
[52:14] i'll choose this one
[52:16] and they went over to her you know this
[52:17] and he they only quartered for like two
[52:19] weeks i think
[52:20] one week
[52:22] so he was really led by the holy spirit
[52:25] and he said lord the way i know you're
[52:27] with me is this this will fit her
[52:28] perfectly so he just went over there
[52:30] they'd only been courting a week
[52:32] he said can you try this on i just would
[52:34] like to see
[52:35] so she went there you know the parents
[52:36] are there she come out she's like it
[52:38] fits it fits perfectly
[52:40] that's right
[52:42] and he says okay will you marry me
[52:45] that's how i went say that
[52:47] almost like that
[52:49] desperation
[52:52] but see the mother and i
[52:54] pray to desperation amen
[52:56] we prayed in desperation and she come
[52:58] back hallelujah
[53:00] now she's married to a preacher in texas

[53:09] dan is her husband's name i can't
[53:11] remember her name i just call her sister
[53:14] or i call her mom
[53:17] but that's a moment of desperation
[53:18] praise god
[53:20] you pray you cry out to god so that's
[53:23] all we know how to do
[53:25] confess sins
[53:26] cry out to god god will answer his

[53:54] up and i'm like well that you know i
[53:55] didn't really know
[53:57] i didn't really know how that applied to
[53:58] our local church at that time i just

[54:01] sister beth comes up simon's wife that's
[54:03] when simon was a part of our church
[54:07] and i just gather around and she's like

[54:26] nobody's a homosexual
[54:28] uh i mean all these things you know
[54:30] just as a pastor mother like what is the
[54:32] sermon for and the whole time god was
[54:34] orchestrating it
[54:36] god was bringing up sister beth and i
[54:38] remember church i remember she started
[54:39] crying i remember the drops
[54:41] of tears falling on the concrete and i
[54:44] just was crying there i didn't know god
[54:45] was gonna answer but we just prayed we
[54:47] cried to god god say sister bar
[54:50] in jesus name she wasn't even a believer
[54:52] at that moment
[54:55] a couple years later simon was like hey
[54:56] bro just pray
[54:58] uh sister barb we're starting bible
[55:00] studies at sister barb's house
[55:03] and then the bible says get going and
[55:06] then she starts coming to church cam had
[55:08] me come preach i started preaching about
[55:09] deliverance you can be freed you can be
[55:11] free from satan and you don't have to be
[55:12] addicted i gave my testimony about how i
[55:14] was addicted to cigarettes and dirty
[55:16] magazines and all these things and she
[55:18] come up for prayer and i prayed for her
[55:19] that she would get deliverance over
[55:21] cigarettes
[55:22] she said she went home that night smoked
[55:23] the last cigarette through the rest of
[55:25] the way and she's been free from
[55:26] cigarettes ever since
[55:29] but it was best desperation amen
[55:33] it took a little desperation and a
[55:34] little bit of patience amen
[55:36] hallelujah
[55:39] and nobody else in that service come up
[55:41] signing crying for the abominations
[55:44] no i'm just i'm just letting you know
[55:45] because there's a different time of
[55:46] season for everybody yeah
[55:49] but you see how god orchestrated brother
[55:51] sister beth to come up for prayer at
[55:52] that moment
[55:53] and then lindsay's mom at that moment
[55:58] god brings us to these moments of
[56:00] desperation
[56:02] we've got to recognize when we feel like
[56:04] it's between life and death that's the
[56:05] time to seek god cry out to god and
[56:08] perhaps that'll be the moment
[56:10] perhaps if not it'll come eventually
[56:13] right by god's grace i see i'm gonna go
[56:16] be really long today by god's way
[56:19] brother phil did you know i preached
[56:20] three hours sometimes did you know that
[56:23] i've uh i've heard of preachers doing
[56:25] that okay would you have come if you
[56:27] wouldn't know i was gonna preach three
[56:28] hours
[56:32] let me set a little timer here so that's
[56:34] why i bought this thing to give me a
[56:36] physical
[56:38] don't wear out the people don't wear
[56:39] other people
[56:41] uh ruth's decision brother said she was
[56:42] in desperation her husband had died
[56:46] orpha's husband had died
[56:48] and naomi's like go home go home i can't
[56:51] even if you have children i you know
[56:54] even if i have children get married
[56:56] by the time they're old enough to marry
[56:57] you it's it's over it's okay
[57:01] and norfolk was like all right i'm going
[57:03] back to moab going back to the world
[57:06] right but ruth is like wherever you go
[57:10] i'll go amen in other words i've seen
[57:12] faith in you even though she's
[57:13] backslidden in the church
[57:16] naomi was backslidden out of the
[57:18] promised land might have been her
[57:20] husband's fault actually uh now that i
[57:21] think about it might have been russell's
[57:23] fault but she followed her husband
[57:25] out of the promised land
[57:27] and
[57:28] ruth says wherever you go i'll go that's
[57:31] right whoever god you serve that'll be
[57:33] my god amen
[57:35] your people will be my people brother
[57:37] that was a moment of desperation i have
[57:39] nowhere to go i'm clinging to the one
[57:41] person i know who has faith hallelujah
[57:44] desperation
[57:46] now look she could have went out and got
[57:48] any of those
[57:49] sexy men out there
[57:51] she could have been a prostitute or a
[57:52] harem for a rich man she could have done
[57:54] any of that
[57:56] but something inside of her was drawn to
[57:58] follow this naomi praise god
[58:00] she was just drawn because of the godly
[58:02] character and the church said
[58:04] see you're just we're just drawing the
[58:06] people a godly character amen
[58:09] and god orchestrated that amen in other
[58:11] words god knew there was a soul down
[58:12] there named rude
[58:14] she was amongst a bunch of worldly
[58:16] people so god had to send the family god
[58:18] had to let the man backside to send
[58:20] believers down there and paul is the
[58:22] believer and she become married to boaz
[58:25] the lord of the harvest amen
[58:27] as a type of jesus christ getting a
[58:30] gentile pride for the rapture amen
[58:34] amen
[58:37] that decision just that decision was a
[58:39] moment of desperation
[58:45] and god directed that moment god brought
[58:47] her to desperation
[58:48] there's no food
[58:50] there's a famine
[58:52] oh it's just it's all everything was
[58:53] awful everybody's dying
[58:56] husbands dying
[58:58] death all around me
[59:00] they didn't see
[59:01] boaz they couldn't see that but god saw
[59:04] it amen
[59:06] church we don't see all the although we
[59:08] don't see the boaz coming but boaz is
[59:10] coming hallelujah
[59:11] amen hallelujah
[59:13] jesus is coming praise god
[59:16] many times you don't see
[59:18] the blessings coming on if we'll just
[59:20] persevere through the desperate moments
[59:23] amen
[59:25] you can't say like this past the tests
[59:28] if god brings to the test let's pass it
[59:30] with
[59:30] grace let's pass it with love let's have
[59:32] charity i know charity will pass the
[59:34] test
[59:36] now i could probably go on this for a
[59:37] long time
[59:40] help me god happy jesus i preach long
[59:42] enough lord help me to humble myself
[59:48] uh
[59:49] i'll skip past those
[59:53] go to the first really is nine i'd like
[59:54] to yeah i can preach maybe on those
[59:55] later
[59:57] just trying to be cautious
[1:00:03] boy it felt like a long time since i've
[1:00:04] seen everybody so
[1:00:06] man it's been a whole week i haven't
[1:00:08] seen the church my goodness
[1:00:10] i can't wait to get to certain church
[1:00:11] and see everybody
[1:00:13] hallelujah it's good to be in the house
[1:00:14] of lord today
[1:00:16] first good is 9 22.
[1:00:18] so brother ram uh
[1:00:19] talks about how
[1:00:21] he had to constantly
[1:00:25] battle to know god's will for his life
[1:00:29] and so he took the he took his
[1:00:30] inspiration from saint paul
[1:00:34] which is a great one to use because paul
[1:00:36] said everyone will be judged by my
[1:00:38] gospel by jesus christ
[1:00:40] right paul's new testament letters are
[1:00:43] going to judge all of us
[1:00:44] right either the judgment seat of christ
[1:00:45] or the rightful judgment let's make it
[1:00:47] to the judgment seat of christ praise
[1:00:48] god that's where i want to be judged
[1:00:51] because there's only rewards there
[1:00:53] hallelujah
[1:00:55] 9 22.
[1:00:57] to the week became highest week that i
[1:00:59] might gain the weak
[1:01:00] see what's our desire our desire is to
[1:01:02] gain souls to heaven
[1:01:03] we're trying to gain other souls
[1:01:08] i have made all things to all men that i
[1:01:10] might by all means save some
[1:01:13] church we just want to see some people
[1:01:15] saved out of this awful world
[1:01:17] just some
[1:01:19] verse 23 and this idea for the gospel
[1:01:22] sake that i might be partaker thereof
[1:01:23] with you no you're not the they which
[1:01:24] run in the race run all but one
[1:01:27] receives the prize
[1:01:29] so run that he may obtain
[1:01:32] and every man that striveth for the
[1:01:33] mastery is temperate that's self-control
[1:01:35] in all things see we need self-control
[1:01:38] in our diets we need self-control with
[1:01:40] our bodies self-control with our words
[1:01:43] how about self-control with our emotions
[1:01:44] and the church said amen
[1:01:47] we need self-control in every area of
[1:01:49] our
[1:01:50] lives with our bank accounts
[1:01:53] amen our credit cards
[1:01:56] everything
[1:01:58] everything
[1:01:59] paul said that's that's how i know i'm
[1:02:01] fully submitted to god when god has
[1:02:03] control of every area of my life
[1:02:05] hey
[1:02:08] now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[1:02:10] crowd but mean incorruptible
[1:02:12] like i heard that last week can you
[1:02:14] imagine this
[1:02:15] do you ever remember who kobe bryant was
[1:02:16] he was a famous bastard
[1:02:18] he of course died in that helicopter
[1:02:20] crasher so awful
[1:02:21] his daughter and other people but one
[1:02:23] thing they were saying about him was
[1:02:24] that he only slept four hours a day
[1:02:27] and yet he would go play basketball at
[1:02:28] the highest level possible
[1:02:30] now he's an example of being temperate
[1:02:32] in all things for the sake of a natural
[1:02:35] crowd like a basketball champion crowd
[1:02:39] not that now that's what i wonder how
[1:02:41] can that guy get my four hours and i get
[1:02:43] tired if i want to get five and a half
[1:02:45] or something i get cranky if i only get
[1:02:46] five now what's wrong with me
[1:02:48] i think i need to work out more that's
[1:02:49] what i need to do
[1:02:51] but just as an example a athlete can do
[1:02:54] four hours of sleep
[1:02:56] and compete at the highest level because
[1:02:58] he's trained his body with the right
[1:03:00] diet
[1:03:01] that's really something the right amount
[1:03:02] of sleep
[1:03:04] right amount of rest and he did
[1:03:06] meditation and things like that for a
[1:03:08] natural crowd what should we do for the
[1:03:10] incorruptible crowd
[1:03:13] something i need to pray about
[1:03:16] for sure
[1:03:18] help me jesus
[1:03:20] verse 26 i therefore so run not as
[1:03:22] uncertainly
[1:03:24] so in other words he knows where he's
[1:03:26] running
[1:03:26] we're running to heaven praise god we're
[1:03:28] running to jesus's throat right we're
[1:03:30] trying to run to meet jesus
[1:03:32] so fight i not as one that beaten the
[1:03:34] arrow i know i'm fighting the devil and
[1:03:35] i know i'm fighting my sinful members in
[1:03:37] my flesh
[1:03:39] i know who my worst enemy is it's that
[1:03:40] ugly guy in the mirror every morning
[1:03:42] right
[1:03:43] verse 27 but i keep under my body that
[1:03:46] actually means physically hit i
[1:03:47] physically hit my body and bring it into
[1:03:49] subjection lest that by any means when i
[1:03:52] preach to others i myself should be cast
[1:03:54] away
[1:03:55] see paul didn't act like even though he
[1:03:57] had many visions of jesus he didn't act
[1:03:59] like
[1:04:00] he was the greatest person
[1:04:03] he actually said well i could fall away
[1:04:05] because god can do whatever he wants
[1:04:08] yet yeah he's been filled with the holy
[1:04:10] ghost
[1:04:11] and yet he said i wish i could be cursed
[1:04:12] so that my
[1:04:13] jewish friends could be saved
[1:04:16] he did not think very highly of himself
[1:04:19] he says i'm the least of the apostles
[1:04:20] and he said i'm lisa the saints that's
[1:04:22] right
[1:04:23] now look what brother says
[1:04:26] he said i want my name wrote on the last
[1:04:28] book of life i want jesus to remember me
[1:04:30] on that roll call amen
[1:04:32] remember me jesus
[1:04:35] like yesterday we were uh
[1:04:39] yesterday we were at a stop on the
[1:04:40] turnpike in pennsylvania and a guy had a
[1:04:42] shirt that said jesse smith like a
[1:04:44] tattoo artist i'm like
[1:04:45] hey that's my name
[1:04:49] what who do you know jesse smith and
[1:04:51] he's like he's like oh he's a famous
[1:04:52] tattoo artist he said you like tattoos
[1:04:57] i said no i don't have any tattoos i
[1:04:59] said but i want the lord's word tattooed
[1:05:01] on my heart
[1:05:02] [Applause]
[1:05:06] see i want to be all that just made me
[1:05:07] think of that i know it's i want my name
[1:05:10] on the last book of life amen written
[1:05:12] with the blood of jesus christ amen
[1:05:14] that's what i want my name tattooed
[1:05:15] there praise god or written there yes
[1:05:17] lord i want him to remember
[1:05:20] me so because brother man doesn't want
[1:05:23] to be lost
[1:05:24] he says this will throw me into
[1:05:26] desperation like paul said after i
[1:05:28] preach the gospel shall i be a cast off
[1:05:31] he said it could happen
[1:05:33] remember in the seventh seal brother
[1:05:34] william i just showed this a few weeks
[1:05:35] ago and the seven seal brother said you
[1:05:36] forget anything about me he said i'm not
[1:05:38] fit to live and he said i'm not being
[1:05:41] that i'm not he said i'm not saying that
[1:05:42] to be humble
[1:05:43] in other words none of us can earn
[1:05:45] salvation
[1:05:47] none of us by any good works could ever
[1:05:49] merit god's revelations
[1:05:51] it's not by human works it's by grace
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:55] that's what he's saying here
[1:05:57] we cannot have self-confidence we gotta
[1:06:00] have confidence in christ again
[1:06:04] so what is it so because god could just
[1:06:06] throw me away
[1:06:07] it throws me into desperation to think
[1:06:10] of all these years of preaching i could
[1:06:12] come to a place where i could fail him
[1:06:16] what is the next move
[1:06:19] what's the next move for you brother
[1:06:21] i can ask jose what's the next move for
[1:06:24] your life you could ask me well just
[1:06:25] what's the next move for the church
[1:06:28] uh time to pray
[1:06:30] all right i don't know
[1:06:33] none of us know unless god showed you
[1:06:35] and if he showed you it's by grace
[1:06:40] what must i do next it throws me into a
[1:06:42] nervous stage
[1:06:45] and what can i do
[1:06:47] it throws me to the mountains
[1:06:50] and to the bathroom
[1:06:52] because i so when he needed to know
[1:06:54] god's will what'd he do
[1:06:56] all right see amina thanks for ironing
[1:06:58] my shirts love you
[1:06:59] time to go on a trip
[1:07:01] right
[1:07:02] that's what he said
[1:07:03] he said he would get home unpack the
[1:07:05] bags his wife would have bags ready and
[1:07:07] he'd leave and go back out to the
[1:07:08] mountains and see god sometimes
[1:07:14] and it's hard because when i'm with the
[1:07:15] people i've got to be all things to all
[1:07:16] men that i might win some to christ
[1:07:20] yet with that token always before me the
[1:07:21] holy spirit
[1:07:24] so
[1:07:25] paul says i might be a castaway i might
[1:07:27] be reprobate so see that's the worst
[1:07:29] date anybody could be is a reprobate
[1:07:30] mind
[1:07:31] that means you pass from
[1:07:33] uh you you pass between the line of
[1:07:34] grace
[1:07:36] right i can't exactly remember the exact
[1:07:38] words now
[1:07:39] the line of ju was it a line of mercy
[1:07:43] line between mercy and grace bless your
[1:07:44] heart
[1:07:46] you're my second memory
[1:07:48] see so when they cross that line and
[1:07:49] they're rejected like many homosexuals
[1:07:52] like many not all many
[1:07:54] because some of them can repent they
[1:07:56] haven't crossed the line yet they didn't
[1:07:57] know about it
[1:07:59] so here's the three reasons brother
[1:08:01] graham gives that you and i should be
[1:08:03] thankful we're not prophets
[1:08:06] said amen over brother jess i'd like to
[1:08:08] see visions well sometimes i would but
[1:08:09] sometimes i guess i wouldn't
[1:08:13] three reasons brother ram says
[1:08:15] don't wish you're a prophet
[1:08:19] first you see things coming up and you
[1:08:21] can't tell the people so god will make
[1:08:23] you keep a secret
[1:08:24] yeah have you ever had that where you
[1:08:25] want to tell somebody something but yeah
[1:08:34] you're doing everything not to tell
[1:08:36] that's how it was when you got that
[1:08:37] money buddy
[1:08:38] i was like yeah god bless you awesome
[1:08:40] see ya
[1:08:46] see you see things and you're forbidden
[1:08:47] to tell god to don't tell somebody
[1:08:53] and the visions
[1:08:54] they'd be sorry if you did tell them and
[1:08:56] you know better to do it
[1:08:58] so you would have visions you couldn't
[1:08:59] tell people because it would make people
[1:09:01] sorry make them sad
[1:09:03] think about it some people might be lost
[1:09:04] church in people's families
[1:09:06] that would crush them
[1:09:08] but with a new mind and divine
[1:09:10] divine
[1:09:11] eternal body it might be it would be
[1:09:13] different on the other side
[1:09:14] i know it's hard to say but that's
[1:09:16] that's the reality
[1:09:18] second then you go so far in visions oh
[1:09:20] i wish i had salvations until everything
[1:09:22] becomes a vision and it throws you into
[1:09:24] a nervous stage
[1:09:25] like brother i said look right now am i
[1:09:27] in a vision
[1:09:28] is this a vision where am i really
[1:09:30] standing at
[1:09:32] you don't know if you're in a vision or
[1:09:33] not
[1:09:34] where am i you ever thought that where i
[1:09:36] mean i don't usually know where i'm at
[1:09:38] right we usually know where we're at my
[1:09:39] brother phil might not know because he's
[1:09:41] from chicago right
[1:09:43] but most of us know where we're at
[1:09:44] praise god yeah
[1:09:47] and then you overwork yourself you over
[1:09:49] tax yourself so you're all worked up is
[1:09:51] this a vision this is vision i can't
[1:09:53] tell people things and third then you
[1:09:54] find out things about people you wish
[1:09:57] you didn't know
[1:10:02] you ever had that you ever heard that
[1:10:03] where you find out some things oh we
[1:10:05] shouldn't know that
[1:10:07] it's always going to be there now
[1:10:09] or it's always going to be there i wish
[1:10:10] i didn't know that
[1:10:12] now he would know it on an extremely
[1:10:14] larger level right
[1:10:16] but ram said he would see visions break
[1:10:18] out all over the audience can you
[1:10:19] imagine that my goodness
[1:10:21] like little tv screens
[1:10:23] a few screens above every person like
[1:10:28] the people that desires these things to
[1:10:30] know these things they don't realize
[1:10:31] what type of ministry it costs
[1:10:34] you don't know what goes with it then it
[1:10:35] throws in desperation lord god
[1:10:38] i'm going to have to answer for all
[1:10:39] those
[1:10:42] jack moore told him one time i'd hate to
[1:10:44] have to answer like you at the day of
[1:10:45] judgment
[1:10:47] now that's actually a very uh
[1:10:50] negative kind of perspective
[1:10:51] right because we're all going there by
[1:10:53] great we're all going to be there by
[1:10:54] grace anyway
[1:10:55] but in other words he's saying you have
[1:10:56] a huge responsibility and he does
[1:10:59] god put these people in your hands are
[1:11:00] going to give an account for everyone
[1:11:01] and you're going to answer for your
[1:11:02] ministry that's been about 15 years ago
[1:11:04] and since then i've been in desperation
[1:11:07] and what will i do
[1:11:09] let me say only what you say lord let me
[1:11:11] tell them the truth or don't say nothing
[1:11:14] and the church said amen
[1:11:16] see i see visions i know all these
[1:11:18] things
[1:11:20] help me not to talk unless you want me
[1:11:21] to talk
[1:11:23] tell me not to say
[1:11:24] anything except what you'd want me to
[1:11:26] say though
[1:11:29] so now church i don't feel so bad being
[1:11:30] a small pastor
[1:11:37] again paul said
[1:11:41] here
[1:11:42] he says i am not verse 12 not as though
[1:11:44] i had already attained either were
[1:11:46] already perfect in other words paul says
[1:11:48] i haven't arrived yet i'm not i'm not
[1:11:51] the best christian of all time i'm not
[1:11:54] complete i still have room to grow i can
[1:11:56] still learn things can our church say
[1:11:58] that
[1:11:59] i can still learn things
[1:12:01] i don't know everything
[1:12:04] he said but by any means i want to
[1:12:06] attain to the rapture amen whatever the
[1:12:09] cost is i want to make sure i'm at the
[1:12:12] meeting in the air praise god amen
[1:12:14] and i'm following after jesus so i can
[1:12:17] try to apprehend what's already
[1:12:19] apprehended me so see that's the thing
[1:12:21] god apprehends you first and then you're
[1:12:24] trying to apprehend him praise god
[1:12:26] that's the order god snatches like the
[1:12:28] cup in the in the chicken yard right
[1:12:31] when that when the person picks up that
[1:12:32] cup says that cup's mine god has
[1:12:35] apprehended you god has grabbed the
[1:12:36] heart of your cup god's gonna clean out
[1:12:38] your coffee man
[1:12:40] he's gonna clean you up wash you up fill
[1:12:43] you with the holy ghost and use you amen
[1:12:46] just be patient sometimes dishes to wash
[1:12:49] sometimes those stains go pretty deep
[1:12:51] especially out of the chicken yard we
[1:12:53] saw chickens this week boy they are
[1:12:54] messy oh my goodness and i guess that's
[1:12:56] what we want to get into right haven
[1:13:00] but i've already said i'm having nothing
[1:13:02] to do with that
[1:13:03] i'll mark my word right
[1:13:05] i'm probably saying different later
[1:13:08] but see god he he uh he apprehends you
[1:13:12] first
[1:13:13] and then the whole rest of your life i'm
[1:13:14] trying to apprehend him i'm trying to
[1:13:16] understand god's ways i'm trying to know
[1:13:18] god's will
[1:13:20] i'm trying to grasp what god has for me
[1:13:24] if you're like moses you had to wait
[1:13:25] till you're eight years old
[1:13:28] or if you're like
[1:13:29] you're like abraham gotta wait till
[1:13:30] you're 75
[1:13:37] see he says i count not myself to have
[1:13:39] apprehended i don't have everything i
[1:13:40] don't understand god in everything
[1:13:43] but i'm gonna press toward the mark i'm
[1:13:45] going to seek eagerly there it is again
[1:13:47] i'm going to see god's face
[1:13:49] to find god's answer to all the
[1:13:51] questions about the promises of god i'm
[1:13:52] going to seek i'm going to earnestly
[1:13:54] seek god to know the answers to my
[1:13:56] questions
[1:13:58] and all of us that want to be perfect
[1:13:59] how many want to be maturing here
[1:14:02] he said be be like-minded just like me
[1:14:05] glory there it is in other words don't
[1:14:07] consider yourself you're the greatest of
[1:14:08] all time
[1:14:10] consider you're still learning i'm still
[1:14:12] growing
[1:14:13] i'm still trying to grab a hold and
[1:14:14] understand what's grabbed a hold of me
[1:14:16] to praise god
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:19] glory
[1:14:21] i'm going to get past that
[1:14:25] now let me see how many i got here
[1:14:26] because i could probably preach all day
[1:14:28] here let's see
[1:14:30] i'm at 31.
[1:14:34] this is kind of i want to get to right
[1:14:36] about there so 52.
[1:14:39] okay i'll try to go through this quick
[1:14:40] here
[1:14:42] yeah
[1:14:43] i think this will help you here by
[1:14:44] gotcha because i find this in my life
[1:14:46] anybody find that sometimes tension
[1:14:47] builds slowly through the day
[1:14:52] most school days it starts off
[1:14:55] sometimes it starts off before the
[1:14:56] school day
[1:14:57] you get emails like boom boom boom boom
[1:15:01] boom
[1:15:02] usually though it's right when the kids
[1:15:03] walk in at 8 50. mr smith this mr smith
[1:15:06] that they were doing this in the hallway
[1:15:09] they get emails the teachers stop in
[1:15:11] and pretty soon i'm just it's i feel
[1:15:12] like my head's spinning praise god
[1:15:14] anybody ever feel like that before
[1:15:17] has anyone ever been asked 18 questions
[1:15:18] at one
[1:15:23] but time builds many times if we're not
[1:15:25] careful tension will build throughout
[1:15:27] the day right right
[1:15:30] and so see what does it it kind of
[1:15:32] brings us to a it's about desperation
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:35] i'm either going to explode in anger
[1:15:39] or i'm going to fall on jesus like we
[1:15:41] saw a few weeks ago praise god amen
[1:15:44] either i'm going to explode and go off
[1:15:46] on somebody or i'm going to throw myself
[1:15:48] at the feet of jesus god break me
[1:15:50] forgive me humble myself god guide me
[1:15:53] through this day
[1:15:54] help me to get through this moment
[1:15:56] i'm just talking about uh i'm talking
[1:15:58] about desperation that's a part of every
[1:16:00] day
[1:16:04] right but ram said the result of tension
[1:16:07] is you did something wrong and you act
[1:16:09] out of place
[1:16:10] so really tension is whose fault
[1:16:13] my fault
[1:16:15] whose fault attention your fault
[1:16:19] we do something wrong we act the wrong
[1:16:21] way see if we act the right way we would
[1:16:23] have tension
[1:16:26] right
[1:16:27] we'd be cool as a cucumber they say
[1:16:30] because we handle the situation the
[1:16:31] right way
[1:16:34] it'll make the poor act that way it'll
[1:16:36] make the middle class act that way to
[1:16:37] make the rich act that way it'll make
[1:16:39] the wrong act that way it'll make the
[1:16:40] pretty good act that way it'll make the
[1:16:42] good act that way because it's tension
[1:16:44] steam build up got to blow it out
[1:16:46] somewhere see you don't you blow the
[1:16:48] boiler up if you don't get up the
[1:16:49] pressure
[1:16:51] now we fight it builds up as the day
[1:16:53] goes you talk to your boss if you're
[1:16:55] working oh so-and-so and if you speak to
[1:16:57] the kitty come in here mama see
[1:17:02] there you are it builds up oh my see you
[1:17:04] feel like you're going to your head is
[1:17:06] going to come off
[1:17:08] i've literally felt that have you ever
[1:17:10] felt that before yes there's been times
[1:17:12] like one time somebody uh
[1:17:14] sent me a text and said i was a demon
[1:17:16] preacher
[1:17:17] i was a satanic creature i thought my
[1:17:19] heart brother william was going to jump
[1:17:20] right out of my chest
[1:17:22] i thought all these years i've tried to
[1:17:24] serve god and they're telling people i'm
[1:17:26] a demon inspired preacher
[1:17:28] thank god for prayer that's all i can
[1:17:29] say hallelujah you know because you just
[1:17:32] have good intentions right you just want
[1:17:33] to help people yeah
[1:17:36] there's been times at school i thought
[1:17:37] my head's going to fly off
[1:17:42] you're trying to teach a lesson that
[1:17:43] person got to use the restroom that
[1:17:45] person spills water
[1:17:47] that person's uh throwing spit wads or
[1:17:49] that person i mean it's it's crazy it's
[1:17:51] just a craziness just to get through a
[1:17:53] day
[1:17:53] it's crazy just to get through a day
[1:17:55] praise god
[1:17:56] he said there you are builds up
[1:17:58] you feel like your head's going to come
[1:17:59] off i know the brother says i know i'm
[1:18:02] with it every day so i know what it
[1:18:03] means it builds up
[1:18:06] that's when brother ram lied to irs
[1:18:08] that's what he said he thought his head
[1:18:09] was going to spin off
[1:18:11] because all the pressure come back for
[1:18:12] another interview more more
[1:18:14] interrogation for the irs more documents
[1:18:16] more trips to the bank more more more
[1:18:18] more
[1:18:19] don't tell them i'm not even here
[1:18:21] live
[1:18:26] so i want you to see that church so you
[1:18:28] can understand that we are going to have
[1:18:30] desperate times throughout just regular
[1:18:32] days
[1:18:34] so there's differences between
[1:18:36] moments in your life where they're just
[1:18:37] desperate moments life and death but
[1:18:39] then there's also this daily tension
[1:18:42] this daily desperation that we go
[1:18:43] through as well
[1:18:45] how many appreciate god's grace to us
[1:18:47] amen
[1:18:49] in our daily desperate moments our daily
[1:18:50] attention that we have
[1:18:52] but then also these moments where
[1:18:55] they're life-changing moments
[1:18:57] they're pivotal moments
[1:19:01] but i like this quote program was
[1:19:02] ultimately thankful for the i'm sure
[1:19:03] brother william remember this brother
[1:19:05] jose uh if you've listened to it lately
[1:19:07] he was thankful for the tensions of life
[1:19:11] one of the main things that always hurts
[1:19:12] me through life has been a nervous
[1:19:13] condensed hurts hurts
[1:19:16] remember i preached it over there i
[1:19:17] appreciate it here too i appreciate the
[1:19:18] point brother graham said the worst
[1:19:20] feeling of a demon is the nervousness
[1:19:23] demon
[1:19:25] a nervous demon is the worst feeling you
[1:19:27] can ever have
[1:19:29] because fear is paralyzing
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:33] so when we let fear come in our house
[1:19:34] it's like
[1:19:35] can i come in i want to make you afraid
[1:19:37] sure
[1:19:39] war in ukraine nuclear war is going to
[1:19:41] destroy us all
[1:19:43] food shortage inflation you're not going
[1:19:44] to have enough food your kids are going
[1:19:45] to starve yeah come on in come on in
[1:19:47] yeah i believe yeah
[1:19:49] and it binds the strong man so it finds
[1:19:52] your faith and it ties him up
[1:19:57] and now your faith can't do nothing
[1:19:59] you can't speak anything you can't
[1:20:00] believe anything you can't even hope
[1:20:02] anything
[1:20:03] you can't do nothing amen
[1:20:05] you're not even in charge of your own
[1:20:06] house amen
[1:20:08] in other words your mind is not you're
[1:20:09] not even in charge of your own thinking
[1:20:12] lord those are not your thoughts those
[1:20:13] are satan thoughts amen
[1:20:16] all you gotta do is expose that enemy
[1:20:18] hallelujah confess that and that will
[1:20:21] wake the strong man up like samson amen
[1:20:23] it'll wake him up praise god and break
[1:20:25] out of those bundles every day
[1:20:27] get out of the house amen this is my
[1:20:28] house this is god's mind i love the law
[1:20:31] of the lord amen
[1:20:33] hallelujah
[1:20:36] so worst feeling
[1:20:38] is be nervous about something
[1:20:41] fearful about something
[1:20:45] it's been one of the things that's hurt
[1:20:46] him in his life
[1:20:48] now how many raise your hand say it hurt
[1:20:49] me
[1:20:52] it's paralyzed in my face it's true
[1:20:55] when i get so warm so see when i get
[1:20:57] tired and weary
[1:20:59] i kind of feel like nobody cares for me
[1:21:03] you know
[1:21:05] you have it too
[1:21:07] so you don't have to raise your hand
[1:21:09] everybody sometimes feels like nobody
[1:21:10] cares for them yeah
[1:21:14] but
[1:21:15] let's be honest do people care about us
[1:21:17] yeah god just showed us again today
[1:21:18] someone will drive
[1:21:21] what do you say 500 miles
[1:21:23] just to meet us
[1:21:25] he's not in here
[1:21:27] drive 500 miles anything's 85
[1:21:30] just to meet us
[1:21:33] but ram said that's exactly what he
[1:21:35] would do too
[1:21:36] he said the devil would whisper and say
[1:21:37] nobody loves you nobody cares about you
[1:21:39] he said
[1:21:40] that program would realize oh yeah that
[1:21:42] one p that one family from georgia just
[1:21:44] drove eight hours for one service but i
[1:21:47] said i would take that eight hours one
[1:21:49] service i'd stick that in the devil's
[1:21:50] face and say see they do love me
[1:21:53] there you go down like that there's
[1:21:55] [Applause]
[1:22:06] you feel like nobody loves you
[1:22:11] i like this i just happen to have a real
[1:22:13] overdose of it lately
[1:22:16] that's why i love my wrap he's so he's
[1:22:17] so human he was so
[1:22:19] i get to feel like he he could be my
[1:22:21] friend
[1:22:22] yeah like yeah i can't believe that
[1:22:23] brother i've had some overdose of
[1:22:24] loneliness lately
[1:22:26] thinking nobody cares
[1:22:29] i can relate to that
[1:22:30] it gets real bad sometimes i can't
[1:22:33] hardly it's tension and that's what it
[1:22:35] does i get to a spot especially with
[1:22:36] some of these visions it just gets me i
[1:22:38] look at a person i said this is a vision
[1:22:39] no no no no yes no is it not you see
[1:22:42] you don't realize what price goes with
[1:22:44] that
[1:22:45] and so you wonder
[1:22:47] then you get to thinking uh well you're
[1:22:49] then you get off your side and say well
[1:22:51] what have i done here i am i'm 50 years
[1:22:53] old i haven't done nothing for the lord
[1:22:54] now how many have ever thought that i
[1:22:56] don't do nothing for god
[1:22:59] yeah the devil gets me with that one too
[1:23:02] you don't do nothing for god

[1:24:07] the people love me
[1:24:09] i love the people
[1:24:10] i am doing something for the lord
[1:24:14] so brother let you know it's just you
[1:24:16] and i doing that to ourselves
[1:24:20] we're just doing it to ourselves we
[1:24:21] don't know the will of god but if we're
[1:24:22] not careful in the waiting time we let
[1:24:24] the devil try to trick us and say you
[1:24:26] haven't done nothing
[1:24:29] well yeah i have
[1:24:30] i've given him my whole life
[1:24:33] like brother amen he's left everything
[1:24:35] he literally got kicked out of the house
[1:24:37] just to come to the message praise god
[1:24:39] amen hallelujah
[1:24:42] glory i've left everything reminds me of
[1:24:45] peter well lord what what will we get
[1:24:47] we've left everything amen
[1:24:50] there's a great reward for leaving
[1:24:52] everything amen
[1:24:57] speaking of tension i was praying about
[1:24:58] it what would you do if you didn't have
[1:25:00] tension just think of it tension is part
[1:25:02] of living what kind of what kind of
[1:25:04] encouraged me when i thought of that if
[1:25:05] i had no tension you'd be a ragdoll you
[1:25:08] would have no feelings
[1:25:12] there would be nothing you could work on
[1:25:14] see that's where people they come to
[1:25:16] church and they don't take anything away
[1:25:17] from the service
[1:25:18] we have got to take everything or
[1:25:20] something away from every service
[1:25:22] just take like malachi doesn't notice
[1:25:24] you at the top he always puts a tape
[1:25:26] away can i show that real quick
[1:25:29] so at the very top you guys all that's a
[1:25:30] lot of notes but again
[1:25:32] that's more notes than i did
[1:25:34] no it's getting
[1:25:35] he always happens to take away at the
[1:25:36] end of every service one thing he can
[1:25:37] take away from every service i like that
[1:25:42] now when you're young it's like angel's
[1:25:43] food angel's bread you can take
[1:25:44] everything away for
[1:25:46] you you've never heard it before
[1:25:48] but you start hearing things well
[1:25:49] brother just use that quote yeah i
[1:25:51] remember last year yeah yep yep yep well
[1:25:53] sheep need reminders who doesn't need a
[1:25:55] reminder
[1:25:57] right
[1:25:58] who doesn't need a reminder to pick up
[1:25:59] after themselves
[1:26:02] who doesn't need a reminder to do all
[1:26:04] these little minor things in our lives
[1:26:06] that's why we got a reminder app on our
[1:26:07] phone
[1:26:09] i mean you should know to do that but
[1:26:10] you make a reminder to do it right we
[1:26:12] need reminders we're human praise god
[1:26:16] without tension you'd be ragged out
[1:26:18] there be nothing you can work on like a
[1:26:20] husband and wife maybe if she wants to
[1:26:22] do something and you're trying to work
[1:26:23] together especially christians
[1:26:25] the other one wants and then you come
[1:26:27] together to find out what she's done and
[1:26:29] she finds out see the tension really
[1:26:30] brings you closer together
[1:26:32] and that good for marriages praise god
[1:26:34] the hard times actually after them it
[1:26:36] actually brings you closer together
[1:26:39] and somebody tells you what just just
[1:26:41] think of that little wife that went
[1:26:42] under a lot of tension when you wasn't
[1:26:44] so good or the husband went under some
[1:26:46] tension when you wasn't so good
[1:26:49] then when it's all forgiven look how you
[1:26:51] feel about him see you've got to have
[1:26:54] tension that's all
[1:26:56] see after you go through hard times and
[1:26:58] we're upset with somebody
[1:27:00] when we get forgiven then we feel so
[1:27:02] much better about it
[1:27:04] we actually trust them more
[1:27:06] right
[1:27:07] when you have a difficulty with somebody
[1:27:09] or something like that when you go
[1:27:10] through a trial and you get through it
[1:27:12] you
[1:27:13] talk about things and work through it
[1:27:15] you actually like them more afterwards
[1:27:18] is that right
[1:27:19] that's brother said that's what happens
[1:27:20] in a marriage
[1:27:22] now if you don't it's time to repent
[1:27:24] it's time to get time to get right with
[1:27:26] god amen
[1:27:29] and just think of feelings what if you
[1:27:30] didn't have any feelings no pains or
[1:27:32] nothing what there was no pain at all
[1:27:34] you have no feelings at all see if you
[1:27:35] had no feeling then one of your senses
[1:27:37] would be gone so see everything's just
[1:27:39] right anyhow so god just give us grace
[1:27:42] to stand up to it that's the
[1:27:44] thing so in other words we're gonna have
[1:27:47] tension every single day
[1:27:49] but then there's gonna be times of our
[1:27:50] lives when the tension it becomes
[1:27:53] overpowering
[1:27:55] right and these might be moments of
[1:27:56] desperation moment says cry out to god
[1:27:59] moment so go seek god right lay yourself
[1:28:01] before the altar
[1:28:04] i've got to do that from time to time
[1:28:06] i usually work it into my schedule
[1:28:08] usually it's saturday morning i'll just
[1:28:09] come to church and pray and i'll lay her
[1:28:10] at the altar and weep and cry about all
[1:28:12] my problems and
[1:28:14] have a little talk with jesus that makes
[1:28:16] it all right
[1:28:17] i feel better afterwards david but it
[1:28:19] might be during the week
[1:28:23] but we're we're going to go through
[1:28:24] tension so we can learn better right we
[1:28:26] can learn how to serve god
[1:28:30] i like this if i just stand up with that
[1:28:32] grace and stand there and say we know
[1:28:34] that when this life is over the great
[1:28:36] ones on the other side where we're
[1:28:38] looking to go to and now we remember
[1:28:41] that all these things that's attention
[1:28:42] that
[1:28:43] some people try to introduce
[1:28:44] christianity that you're free from worry
[1:28:47] no you're not
[1:28:49] they say you're free from tension oh no
[1:28:51] you add tension when you become a
[1:28:53] christian yeah
[1:28:55] because why
[1:28:58] because before he was a kind of
[1:28:59] happy-go-lucky whatever you did out
[1:29:01] there you didn't care what you did
[1:29:02] that's true
[1:29:04] but now you're a real christian every
[1:29:06] moment how many can say amen to this
[1:29:08] this is how i feel brother phil all the
[1:29:09] time every moment i'm wondering this am
[1:29:11] i pleasing to god
[1:29:13] lord don't let me backside lord help me
[1:29:15] not to get in the flesh almost every
[1:29:17] moment i'm wondering that
[1:29:19] tension is only added to my life that's
[1:29:21] why i like to laugh sometimes with you
[1:29:22] guys it kind of lets out the pressure
[1:29:23] and i think well then i have tension
[1:29:25] like am i being too silly
[1:29:28] as a christian you just have this
[1:29:29] natural tension
[1:29:32] am i pleasing my lord if i can hear from
[1:29:33] him see we want to hear god's voice we
[1:29:36] want to know that today i'm doing what's
[1:29:37] right
[1:29:38] amen glory we don't want to waste one
[1:29:40] day praise god
[1:29:42] which if you want to waste i was on
[1:29:43] vacation i don't want to waste any days
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:47] then i'm under attention there well do i
[1:29:48] rest or study
[1:29:50] or it's supposed to be vacation
[1:29:56] so you're he says it puts you on tension
[1:29:58] put you on guard that's what it makes
[1:29:59] what you are see after all tension is a
[1:30:02] blessing
[1:30:04] it's just the way that you're looking at
[1:30:07] it
[1:30:11] see if you just look the other side no
[1:30:13] matter how thin you slice anything you
[1:30:15] got two sides to it so you want to see
[1:30:17] both sides
[1:30:19] so attention i think oh my what's this
[1:30:21] tension if i could have been born
[1:30:22] without this tension well if i wouldn't
[1:30:24] have had this tension i wouldn't have
[1:30:26] been what i am
[1:30:28] i wouldn't have been a christian perhaps
[1:30:31] it was the tension that drove me to
[1:30:32] jesus christ it's been a blessing
[1:30:35] thing to me
[1:30:38] now
[1:30:40] um i think i'll stop
[1:30:42] yeah

[1:31:30] here we started off if we seek god with
[1:31:32] all of our heart we'll find him
[1:31:34] and let's look at some of these
[1:31:37] in each child of life in each tension of
[1:31:40] life
[1:31:41] in every desperate moment of life god is
[1:31:43] trying to teach us something that's true
[1:31:48] and we just have to be able to learn
[1:31:50] from god
[1:31:52] in the way
[1:31:56] i read your sermon years ago called
[1:31:57] worship while we wait right
[1:31:59] while you're waiting on god that's the
[1:32:00] time to worship i've been years of
[1:32:03] 2013.

[1:32:14] know your will for this promise

[1:32:18] us the way that we should go

[1:32:28] life right now and my eyes gonna guide
