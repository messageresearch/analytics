[28:19] were of a trumpet talking with me which
[28:21] said come up hither and I will show thee
[28:24] things which must be Hereafter
[28:26] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[28:29] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[28:30] one sat on the throne let's read verse
[28:33] three one two three and he that sat was
[28:37] to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine

[29:01] these prayer requests Lord God each and
[29:03] every one Lord from the most important
[29:06] serious life-threatening one down to the
[29:08] the unspoken and to our brother Aaron's
[29:10] traveling Lord and and to the mother

[29:31] interpretation so we are trusting solely
[29:34] upon your Holy Spirit now bless us here
[29:37] tonight in thy divine presence in Jesus
[29:39] Christ's name never a said Amen god
[29:41] bless you bein seated praise the Lord
[29:43] you can switch over Mac I do have some
[29:45] slides here tonight by the grace of the
[29:46] Lord
[29:55] all right so by the grace of the Lord
[30:00] how's that okay we want to look at the
[30:02] next part this is part two of Revelation
[30:05] chapter 4 in my series but I think it's
[30:07] 72 overall by God's grace now I got a
[30:10] nice little update I told you I've been
[30:12] feeling led for a long time to do a
[30:13] postcard outreach at least to give
[30:15] people a chance to come to our church
[30:18] and let them know there's a message
[30:19] Church so I filled out all their forms
[30:22] and paid some money I think it was like
[30:24] five hundred dollars just to get the
[30:26] process started but that's most of the
[30:28] process I think is two hundred dollars
[30:30] for all the the postage so it's going to
[30:33] be about you know seven hundred eight
[30:34] hundred dollars there so I thought that
[30:36] was pretty good if 3500 people get a
[30:38] postcard from us that and they're all
[30:40] around this church but anyways I got the
[30:42] first draft back and I really like it
[30:44] but I just I just want Laura brother
[30:46] branham so I'm gonna send that back I
[30:47] want more brother branham and the pillar
[30:49] of fire because I told him I want these
[30:51] words on it the pillar of fire has
[30:54] spoken this generation and they got all
[30:56] of our information looks really
[30:57] professional I was really happy with it
[30:58] except I want them to see that pillar
[31:00] fire I can't even see it hardly it's
[31:02] right there my whole point of that was
[31:04] so they could see brother Branham in the
[31:06] pillar fire and I understand they're a
[31:08] company they don't know what we believe
[31:10] and they're kind of blending in brother
[31:12] Branham with the Cross which I like but
[31:15] I need to see that pillar fire more so
[31:16] this is the rough draft I think the
[31:20] people will catch it you know God sent a
[31:21] man perhaps you know the elect I'll say
[31:23] like this the elect will catch it and
[31:25] you might not even need a picture like I
[31:28] didn't need a picture to show me that
[31:29] water baptism was right but I appreciate
[31:31] the picture it's God letting us know
[31:33] he's taking this picture with this
[31:34] prophet anyways I thought that was a
[31:36] nice work first draft and on the back I
[31:39] have the dates I wanted to do a join us
[31:41] for our summer series of sermons from
[31:43] the teachings from the pillar of fire I
[31:44] really like that I told them to write
[31:46] that and then each Sunday in July at 4
[31:49] p.m. I want to teach on message topics
[31:52] so they can hear all of us say the
[31:54] Lord's for today like baptism Godhead
[31:57] all those things that brother Brown gave
[31:59] us the stay at the Lord on and then the
[32:01] say the Lord for the future the United
[32:03] States Rush
[32:04] vatican everything we know for the
[32:06] future the power in jesus christ a
[32:08] baptism Godhead the twelve new testament
[32:11] mysteries that brother branham brought
[32:12] us in serves as it's the end time and
[32:14] then the book of revelation revealed
[32:16] basically all these sermons i'm
[32:17] preaching now all combined into one so
[32:20] just hit the highlights you know show
[32:21] who the symbols are who's that woman
[32:23] who's that woman in Revelation 12 with
[32:25] the with the twelve stars above her
[32:27] that's Israel and just you know reveal
[32:30] show the main revelations but if nobody
[32:33] comes at least we tried you know and
[32:34] we'll keep trying to send them out there
[32:37] but they haven't been sent out yet
[32:38] because I have to get to give final
[32:39] approval I like how they have the map
[32:41] and I like our service times and you
[32:44] know again and they they said we need
[32:46] picture of some ugly preachers I said
[32:47] okay I'll give you a picture of an ugly
[32:49] preacher you can put that on there but
[32:52] anyways I'm really excited about it
[32:54] because brother Branham said I don't
[32:56] have the quote here but brother Graham
[32:57] said that this is not the quote brother
[32:59] Branham said every Church should have a
[33:01] burden for their community and he said
[33:04] every community is on the shoulders of
[33:05] the church so I know you heard even
[33:07] brother Adam I prayed that many times
[33:09] brother Adam and I'm sure some of you
[33:11] too we sigh and cry for the abominations
[33:12] done in this city this is our city God
[33:16] has sent us to and the Bible of the
[33:18] Bible says that raksha after 17 God has
[33:21] determined the bounds of your habitation
[33:24] if you always wonder like how come I
[33:25] can't why am I just always tied to Akron
[33:28] or why you know for that that was my
[33:29] testimony football brought me here
[33:32] before I was a Christian and then God
[33:33] brought me here for you know to preach
[33:34] and be a pastor what is it you know what
[33:36] is about this community that I care so
[33:38] much about you know God gives the church
[33:40] that burden so we can try to win souls
[33:42] and brother BAM said the best way to win
[33:44] souls is through the preaching of the
[33:45] word so he said I find a hundred million
[33:48] dollars he said I would go around the
[33:49] world and hold campaigns to preach to
[33:51] sweep the bride into the rapture that's
[33:53] what he said so that's what we want to
[33:55] do try to invite them to come hear the
[33:56] preaching of the word and if people come
[33:59] praise the Lord if not then they at
[34:01] least answer on the day of judgment that
[34:03] they got a chance to hear it
[34:04] by the grace of the Lord so I want to
[34:07] just show you this quote from Sunday I
[34:09] mentioned it Sunday where Bodrum said
[34:10] this brother Adam said great things are
[34:11] taking place right now as the message
[34:14] goes around the world it's a great thing
[34:15] in the sight of God I mean know that
[34:17] brother branham said this he said so now
[34:20] in always whatever you do pray for me
[34:22] because we're now striking the fields
[34:24] for the last times in my opinion
[34:25] remember great things are taking place
[34:27] it's unknown amongst the world he said
[34:30] Jesus come lived I'd sacrifice went back
[34:33] to glory and millions never even know
[34:35] nothing about it
[34:36] see it's not flowery great big it's he
[34:40] came to his own see he that hath an ear
[34:43] let him hear what the spirit saith of
[34:44] the churches not the outside to the
[34:46] church it's the church that gets the
[34:48] shaking now he eats he talks about this
[34:50] I'm not gonna read all this we talked
[34:51] about John the Baptist the Bible said
[34:53] John the Baptist would make every
[34:55] mountain low and he'd raise up every
[34:57] valley mother Branham said what was he
[34:58] he was a preacher preached in the mud
[35:00] with a he's got easy and grasshoppers
[35:02] and locusts and all these things and he
[35:04] just preached repentance and yet that
[35:06] was in God's sight making the mountains
[35:08] low and raising up the valleys so he
[35:10] says you have to have spiritual
[35:12] understanding God never did dwell and
[35:16] never will dwell in glamour he's against
[35:20] it the great messages will be never be
[35:21] make great big so and so and so and so
[35:23] it don't do it that way his sermons
[35:25] don't work in that matter his glamour
[35:27] and glory is above how many appreciate
[35:30] that by God's grace amen army army men
[35:36] fight little cold all day but I
[35:38] appreciate our prayer brother
[35:41] now before broadband preaches this
[35:43] message this is part two from 1961 he
[35:48] gives a word to the young converts so I
[35:52] just want to recount of rehearse what he
[35:54] says it was just a beautiful thought
[35:56] Butler Branham says I want to tell the
[35:58] young converts and he names two or three
[36:00] people in the church that are young
[36:01] converts he says you remember this when
[36:04] God says anything it will not fail and
[36:08] so two he said but brother Graham said
[36:11] he's waiting he does that to test you
[36:14] how do we know that by God's grace have
[36:17] you been through tests in your life
[36:18] where God makes you wait year after year
[36:21] after year
[36:22] he said program tells young converts you
[36:25] need to know that God when His Word says
[36:27] anything it will come to pass but he
[36:30] said he's waiting
[36:31] to do it many times to test us and so
[36:33] brother branham tells the young converts
[36:35] like Abraham God said take up your son
[36:37] and go kill him I'm gonna make you
[36:39] father of Nations although you waited 25
[36:42] years for him or I'm sorry 20 yeah 25
[36:44] years for him he said now kill him and
[36:46] it was God testing Abraham and he said
[36:51] that Abraham had such obedience he said
[36:53] I I've already received Isaac as one
[36:55] from the dead God did this to show us
[36:58] that he keeps his promise with Ram said
[37:00] no matter how impossible it seems does
[37:04] it seem impossible as you go about your
[37:07] life and you know every day is like a
[37:08] routine you do the same thing over and
[37:09] over sometimes I'll be honest to me
[37:11] sometimes it seems impossible how is God
[37:13] gonna get the bride in America ready for
[37:15] the rapture but we know there's nothing
[37:18] impossible with God God is going to do
[37:22] it he's gonna get the bride even the
[37:23] United States is remember when brother
[37:25] Graham saw the vision the bride United
[37:26] States was in line right the one for he
[37:29] said Switzerland or some other European
[37:31] countries and stay in line but the bride
[37:34] from the US was in line praise the Lord
[37:36] so there's going to be a Holy Ghost
[37:38] filled bride from the US who's ready for
[37:40] the rapture the RAM said no matter how
[37:43] impossible it seems God still remains
[37:46] God amen he said that is what I'm trying
[37:48] to say in the healing service no doubt
[37:50] you were sick he said but God keeps his
[37:53] promise that's his word - the converts
[37:56] now I want to make a note here because
[37:58] if the Lord willing I want to preach
[38:00] later on a few thoughts in this sermon
[38:01] anybody listening the sermon this week
[38:03] part 2 of Revelation and we listen to it
[38:05] okay you didn't have to but I just
[38:07] wondered if anybody did but there's two
[38:09] thoughts he doesn't really go into all
[38:10] the way I'd like to preach and I've
[38:12] never heard a preacher preach on him of
[38:14] course that's obvious because I don't go
[38:15] to many churches you know but if you
[38:17] have let me know so I want to get their
[38:18] tapes the first one brother Graham said
[38:21] there's a prophetic nature of the 12
[38:24] sons or the 12 tribes of Israel brother
[38:26] Branham said Ephraim means by the sea
[38:28] and Ephraim was given his lot by the sea
[38:30] how many remember that so each of the
[38:32] twelve sons you know their name meant
[38:34] something and then there was prophecy
[38:36] over them about what they would
[38:38] accomplish in life well brother Branham
[38:40] makes it sound like there's prophecy
[38:41] about where they'll be in the end time
[38:44] when
[38:44] 144,000 or say now would that be
[38:46] something if if God could reveal that to
[38:49] us other man never really teaches it
[38:51] really thoroughly but I like to study on
[38:53] that and see what the scripture says
[38:54] about that second mother Bram said the
[38:57] twelve birthstones
[38:58] of the twelve tribes of Israel and their
[39:01] meanings I like to preach on that
[39:02] because brother Branham said Ephraim's
[39:04] birthstone was Jasper but I'll need more
[39:06] time to research all the stones because
[39:08] there's no scripture I've already looked
[39:09] up Jasper every time in the Bible and
[39:11] there's no time that you know Jasper it
[39:14] says it's called Ephraim's birthstone
[39:16] but there's like common Jewish knowledge
[39:18] out there where the the Orthodox Jews
[39:21] seem to know which stone belongs to
[39:23] which tribe and so I like to study on
[39:25] that and preach on that because there's
[39:27] got to be a lot of meaning in that
[39:28] because that is all it's later fulfilled
[39:31] in the foundations of the new city right
[39:34] the New Jerusalem so those are two
[39:36] thoughts I don't have prepared now
[39:38] because it's gonna take hours and hours
[39:39] and maybe days of studying on those but
[39:42] I would like to reach or dig down deep
[39:45] in those at some point by the God's
[39:46] grace so if you listen to those I know
[39:48] you'll have that same hunger for me like
[39:50] aren't you hunger and for more of God's
[39:51] Word Omaha IRA hear those I'm like God I
[39:54] wish there was a sermon on that but
[39:56] maybe God's called me to preach it or
[39:58] maybe some other preacher now let's
[40:00] start let's look at verse three I just
[40:01] want to preach on verse three and I
[40:03] think I'll get verse three done tonight
[40:05] so let me set my timer here by the grace
[40:07] of Lord I think I'll go about 45 more
[40:09] minutes I already did about 15 and spare
[40:14] myself here I haven't been sleeping good
[40:16] this week I've just had a really kind of
[40:17] rough week and I preach so hard on
[40:19] Sunday my voice heard all week so I
[40:21] didn't do a good job on Sunday with my
[40:24] voice so verse 3 and he that sat was to
[40:27] look upon like a Jasper and sardine
[40:31] stone and there was a rainbow round
[40:35] about the throne in sight and this is
[40:39] interesting it's a rainbow an insight he
[40:44] said it's like unto an emerald so
[40:47] there's like a dual meaning here with
[40:48] the rainbow there's a rainbow but yet in
[40:50] sight it's like it unto an emerald color
[40:53] so let's look at these thoughts like I
[40:56] said I'm pulling out the same thoughts
[40:57] from brother Brown
[40:58] and I'll tell you you know I'll tell you
[41:01] if there's I'm gonna at the end inject a
[41:03] thought that I found in the Greek
[41:06] lexicon that kind of builds some
[41:09] teaching in here by God's grace but
[41:11] everything else should be from brother
[41:12] branham's from sermons here now the
[41:16] first thought is that brother Branham
[41:18] reviews and says immediately I was in
[41:21] the spirit and brother Branham likened
[41:23] unto a baseball game I don't remember
[41:25] that story he said he went to a baseball
[41:27] game he saw a man hit a grand slam and
[41:29] the man next to him had a straw hat on
[41:32] he got so excited he took the hat up and
[41:34] he pulled it down on his head and it
[41:35] would turn he said it turned to be a
[41:37] collar around his neck he was so excited
[41:38] he looked at brother Branham and said
[41:40] aren't you excited and brother BAM said
[41:42] no I'm not really interested in baseball
[41:43] and brother BAM said he said that's
[41:46] because I'm not interested in baseball
[41:48] he said well I'm interested in is the
[41:50] Holy Ghost and he said if you were
[41:52] interested in the Holy Ghost
[41:54] like you are in baseball he said you'd
[41:56] do the same thing with me down there at
[41:57] the church he said and that's what being
[42:00] in the spirit is when you hear the voice
[42:02] of God he said it puts you in the spirit
[42:04] and so the brother BAM says it was the
[42:07] voice he said John was in the spirit he
[42:11] says when you begin to see things in the
[42:12] Bible you get in the spirit he said and
[42:15] when the Holy Spirit does something to
[42:17] you you just can't sit still there's
[42:21] something bubbles over in you you might
[42:23] bubble oftentimes I bubble over in to
[42:25] cry or shouting or you know clapping her
[42:29] you know but when the Spirit of God
[42:31] moves upon you it's so powerful many
[42:33] times that in your flesh you have to
[42:35] have some outlet for it right because
[42:38] that's what brother have said John was
[42:40] in the spirit when he heard the voice in
[42:41] the sphere on the Lord's Day and brother
[42:43] Branham said see he's a baseball fiend
[42:45] that guy's a baseball feat he get
[42:47] excited about baseball I called my
[42:49] friends they get excited about LeBron
[42:50] James and basketball you know that's
[42:52] what they post on Facebook and they get
[42:54] excited they jump and shout about that
[42:55] but we really shouldn't jump and shout
[42:57] about that we should only shout and jump
[42:59] about Jesus we should be more interested
[43:01] in Christ than we are with common
[43:04] natural things because my dad said you
[43:06] just can't sit still when the Holy
[43:08] Spirit does something to you he said
[43:12] he says whoo yeah something takes ahold
[43:15] you're a fiend for Christ and he said
[43:17] he's a baseball fiend just like a
[43:19] cigarette Fein
[43:20] so now Bram compares they're both
[43:23] addicted so when a person addicted to
[43:25] baseball is the same thing as being
[43:26] dicted to cigarettes
[43:28] they're both demon powers is that right
[43:31] and so by masters we can't be addicted
[43:33] to those things let's be addicted to the
[43:35] holy spirit I'm glad to say I've got a
[43:37] good addiction to that by God's grace
[43:38] and it's not life taking its life giving
[43:41] amen hallelujah Laura have said when you
[43:46] love the Lord just something in you
[43:48] reaches out grabs it's hungry and
[43:51] thirsting jesus said blessed are they
[43:54] for they shall be filled
[43:55] he said blessed are they to even thirst
[43:58] whether you've got it or not he said how
[44:00] many wants more of God let me ask you
[44:02] how many want more of God look I have
[44:04] said alright well the reason that you
[44:06] want more of God is because you're
[44:08] blessed
[44:09] hallelujah cuz bless her though they who
[44:12] hunger and thirst for God he said
[44:17] because you want it because you're
[44:18] blessed there's so many people that
[44:20] don't want it Oh hallelujah thought
[44:24] number two let's go next up that's just
[44:25] real short this one will take a little
[44:28] while get your Bibles handy I'm gonna go
[44:29] over the same scriptures brother Branham
[44:31] does so you can kind of see the thoughts
[44:32] he's trying to relay and I'll be honest
[44:35] this sermon in in particular itself was
[44:38] a deeper one a real deeper one because
[44:41] he's polling from all kinds all over the
[44:43] Bible to try to make these different
[44:45] principles and revelations or meanings
[44:49] from what the symbols are in verse 3 of
[44:51] Revelation chapter 4 so he's trying to
[44:54] explain the Jasper the sardine the
[44:56] rainbow and the Emerald so we're
[44:58] basically looking at those four tonight
[44:59] and so he's pulling scriptures from all
[45:01] over and I'll be honest is what I had to
[45:03] really listen closely to even more so
[45:06] than many many sermons I listen to so
[45:11] let's uh let's get our Bibles here now
[45:14] the first thought he wants to say is
[45:16] that
[45:18] both John and Ezekiel saw the same thing
[45:23] whether Bram said they saw him in the
[45:26] mystery of his colors and light so
[45:30] there's a mystery behind the colors that
[45:32] are used and the light that we see
[45:34] there's a mystery behind that alright so
[45:40] let's start off brother Branham reads
[45:41] revelation 4 3 and then he said I
[45:44] noticed he said John stood and seen him
[45:47] sitting in the throne and he was to look
[45:49] like Jasper and sardine stone now all
[45:52] the things and every word has a meaning
[45:53] in the Bible not now if you'll compare
[45:57] if you'll notice it compares with the
[45:59] rest of the scripture so brother Branham
[46:01] says in other words you can take Jasper
[46:04] and look for it in the Bible in another
[46:05] place and it'll help you explain what
[46:07] that means
[46:08] same thing with rainbow same thing with
[46:10] sardine same thing with Emeril that's
[46:12] what we're gonna do tonight the
[46:14] scriptures brother Baron pointing us to
[46:16] where look at those tonight all right
[46:19] now here's what brother Branham says now
[46:22] I don't have a scripture for this so
[46:24] brother Branham says you'll just have to
[46:25] take my word for it this is why we have
[46:28] to you know if we want to and preach on
[46:30] these stones Jasper and sardine and all
[46:32] the ten other stones we're have to do
[46:34] some research in the Jewish
[46:36] encyclopedias perhaps brother Ram said
[46:39] now he said ha me know who the first
[46:42] child of Jacob was he said was Reuben he
[46:46] said now the birthstone of Reuben was
[46:48] Jasper now you won't find that in the
[46:50] scripture brother he must have got this
[46:52] from somewhere else and then he says the
[46:55] birthstone of Benjamin was sardine sobre
[46:59] have said Jesus was looked upon as
[47:01] Reuben and Benjamin he said which is the
[47:04] first and the last he that which was
[47:07] which is and shall come he was the Alpha
[47:09] in the Greek alphabet Omega in the Greek
[47:12] alphabet he was the first and last he
[47:14] was from Benjamin to Reuben and from
[47:17] Reuben to Benjamin he said there he was
[47:20] see like that by God's grace somehow
[47:23] program bounces he said from Jasper to
[47:26] sardine is from Reuben to Benjamin in
[47:29] other words Jesus is everything that
[47:32] Israel was looking for he was from the
[47:36] beginning to the end now it's
[47:38] interesting the name jasper means
[47:41] glittering so here we see christ
[47:43] represented as a glittering stone the
[47:46] color of a glittering stone is shining
[47:48] glittering and remember jasper is called
[47:52] most precious in the bible this is a
[47:56] most precious stone that represents
[47:58] Christ
[47:59] now sardine here represents the sardius
[48:03] stone and this this is here found let's
[48:08] go to Revelation 21 we'll find it here
[48:09] let's go to Revelation 21 in the future
[48:11] home and I got a little picture here
[48:13] I'll talk about this in a moment let's
[48:15] turn to Revelation 21 verse 10 this is
[48:17] the most Scripture when I could find on
[48:19] Google search so Revelation 21 10 and
[48:22] Malachi can you read verse 2 10 and 11
[48:24] for me amen
[48:46] now that's getting back to the future
[48:49] home we'll get there in a moment as well
[48:50] but this is kind of what we saw we have
[48:53] a there's a rainbow round about the
[48:55] throne and it's in the sight as this
[48:57] emerald now this is the best drawing
[48:59] it's way better than I could do that's
[49:01] why I appreciated it because I could
[49:02] never draw like this you have your four
[49:04] beasts you know and there's four and
[49:05] twenty elders and all the angelic hosts
[49:07] in the background that's the best
[49:09] picture I could find that fits this
[49:11] Bible description that I can find okay
[49:14] so one of these colors of course Jasper
[49:18] and sardine now Malachi just read us the
[49:22] scripture about the wall around the new
[49:24] city and remember I preached this about
[49:25] two years ago he just read this the wall
[49:27] of the city I've started the next verse
[49:29] after he read that will be the wall of
[49:31] the city had twelve foundations and in
[49:33] them the twelve names of the apostles of
[49:35] the Lamb and brother Graham said in the
[49:38] future home he said the wall that's
[49:40] around this had twelve foundations and
[49:42] each one of them had the breast stone
[49:44] was an errand which represented the
[49:46] twelve tribes of Israel how many could
[49:48] say amen to that now we go later on in
[49:51] the chapter of Revelation 21 and the
[49:53] foundation of the wall of the city were
[49:55] garnished with all manner of precious
[49:57] stones the first foundation was jasper
[50:00] so jasper is the first which kind of
[50:03] links us to reuben this is where brother
[50:05] Branham at has a good Bible foundation
[50:07] because remember the Old Testament
[50:09] doesn't say Reubens stone was Jasper it
[50:12] doesn't say that but here if we put our
[50:14] scriptural puzzle together we start
[50:17] seeing that the first stone was Jasper
[50:18] brother bran said Jasper represents
[50:21] Reuben and then second sapphire third I
[50:25] can't even say that chalcedony the
[50:27] fourth emerald the fifth sardonyx the
[50:30] sixth sardius so see that's interesting
[50:32] sardius sardine sardine stone so it's a
[50:37] little so the order may not fit there
[50:39] like I said I don't have enough state
[50:41] the Lord on this I'm just showing you
[50:42] what brother Graham said Christ alight
[50:44] the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the
[50:45] tenth chrysoprase pricess the eleventh
[50:50] jaqen and then the twelfth amethyst okay
[50:53] I probably ripped up those names so
[50:55] forgive me now here's just give you a
[50:56] picture so we have Jasper which is blood
[51:00] red which blood red reminds us of the
[51:03] blood of Christ
[51:04] the oldest one then sardine so Jasper
[51:07] and sardine
[51:08] remember there's emerald round about the
[51:11] throne so there's a rainbow with all
[51:13] these twelve cars but then in sight it's
[51:16] as emerald round about the throne that's
[51:18] the best picture I could find as far as
[51:20] understanding this and brother Branham
[51:21] says both of them here in his teaching
[51:24] so remember those twelve stones
[51:27] we're also on the breastplate of the
[51:29] high priests right now this is the best
[51:33] picture I could find of the the
[51:35] foundation of the future home the walls
[51:37] so see it doesn't even have 12 of these
[51:39] so don't don't say I'm preaching false
[51:41] doctrine I know I know that this is
[51:44] wrong I know that if there was 12
[51:46] different colors then it would work out
[51:48] but there's not this picture only had
[51:49] one two three four five six seven eight
[51:51] only had eight so I'm not preaching
[51:53] false doctrine it's just the best
[51:54] picture I could find if you want to take
[51:56] time and draw a little picture that'd be
[51:57] wonderful share it with me then
[51:59] put it in the right order but I'm just
[52:01] letting you know it had 12 foundations
[52:03] right and so this is the idea it has
[52:06] something like this it has 12 different
[52:09] stones right and it's shining the glory
[52:12] of God now remember how big that was
[52:14] this is not to scale this walls too the
[52:16] wall is too large to put on on this
[52:18] scale but the wall itself this wall
[52:21] itself member has three gates on each
[52:22] side
[52:23] he says the wall itself is 216 feet
[52:27] which is 19 stories tall okay and 216
[52:32] feet is 14% of 1500 square feet because
[52:36] that's how tall it is 1,500 square feet
[52:38] then in the new city okay so the wall
[52:41] itself is about 14% of the size of the
[52:44] city so you can imagine how big that
[52:47] that wall in that city is by the grace
[52:50] of Lord remember Jasper and then sardine
[52:53] would be the 7th there all right does
[52:56] that help by God's grace so the first
[52:58] thing brother Graham does is connect us
[52:59] for how Jasper's used in Revelation as
[53:03] well so Jasper's at the throne but one
[53:05] day Jasper is also going to be in the
[53:07] foundation of the wall around the new
[53:10] city and Jasper was also on the
[53:13] breastplate of the high priests so God
[53:15] really likes Jasper and it represents
[53:18] God so does he love sardine and all the
[53:20] other colors now next brother ram leaves
[53:23] this but i'm gonna leave this up here
[53:25] just for the sake of the time and let's
[53:29] go to Ezekiel chapter 1 now brother bran
[53:32] wants to show us amber an emerald like
[53:34] amber amber color so let's go to Ezekiel
[53:36] chapter 1 verse 1
[53:38] how many have studied this sermon itself
[53:41] has anybody actually studied it all by
[53:42] themselves
[53:43] Jose has okay one person okay well
[53:45] praise the Lord that's good as fresh to
[53:46] everybody zekiel 1 verse 1 it was fresh
[53:53] to me i'm i actually never studied this
[53:55] sermon itself individually i know i've
[53:57] heard it because i've preached or heard
[53:59] thing preached about i've listened to
[54:00] him I never actually studied it really
[54:01] to preach it till now
[54:05] Ezekiel 1 verse 1 now and it came to
[54:10] pass in the thirteenth year in the
[54:11] fourth month in the day of the month as
[54:13] among the captives by the river Chebar
[54:15] that the heavens were open and I saw the
[54:17] visions of God in the fifth day of the
[54:20] month which was the fifth year of the
[54:22] King Jehoiachin
[54:24] captivity the word Lord came expressed
[54:26] in Ezekiel the priest the son of boos I
[54:29] in the land of Chaldeans by the river
[54:31] Chebar and the hand of Lord was there
[54:32] upon him and I looked at me hold a world
[54:35] and came out of the north a great cloud
[54:37] and a fire infolding itself an
[54:39] interesting fire infolding itself and a
[54:43] brightness was about it and out of the
[54:46] midst thereof as the colour of amber and
[54:49] I'm starting out of the myths of the
[54:52] fire now brother ram uses a myrrh the
[54:54] same as emerald just so you know so
[54:56] we're getting that same light greenish
[54:58] greenish yellow color okay
[55:01] verse five and out of the midst thereof
[55:04] came the likeness of four living
[55:05] creatures and this was their appearance
[55:07] they had the likeness of a man all right
[55:12] now next
[55:14] verse 26 is now the prophet of God takes
[55:16] us down to verse 26 here alright verse
[55:25] 26 he reads 26 27 28 and above the
[55:28] firmament that was over their heads was
[55:30] the likeness of a throne as the
[55:32] appearance of a sapphire stone and upon
[55:34] the likeness of the throne was the
[55:37] likeness as appearance of a man above it
[55:39] and I saw the color of amber as the
[55:43] appearance of fire roundabout within it
[55:45] from the appearance of his loins even
[55:47] upward and from the appearance of his
[55:50] loins even downward I saw as it were the
[55:52] appearance of fire and had brightness
[55:54] round about as the appearance of the bow
[55:57] that is in the cloud in the day of rain
[56:00] so was the appearance of the brightness
[56:02] round about this was the appearance of
[56:05] the likeness of the glory of the Lord
[56:06] and when I saw I fell upon my face and I
[56:09] heard the voice as one speak that spoke
[56:13] Amen how many like that by God's grace
[56:15] so I had never really studied on that
[56:17] too much until this one so Brougham
[56:20] tells us this he says this he said now
[56:25] see how this vision of Ezekiel compares
[56:29] with John he said notice the color of
[56:32] the Spirit of God which was above the
[56:34] likeness of these four creatures was
[56:36] amber and amber is yellowish green he
[56:40] said see he revealed himself
[56:42] Ezekiel in the myths of Ezekiel's vision
[56:44] this light that he saw coming above the
[56:47] four living creatures was yellowish
[56:49] green when he come to John he appeared
[56:52] in the Emerald which was also yellowish
[56:54] green he said he comes now to the
[56:58] Revelator in yellow screen now here's
[57:01] where he changes he said he comes to us
[57:03] in the yellowish green of the light he
[57:06] said walk in the light he is in the
[57:09] light sober man says whenever he would
[57:11] see the holy spirit move as a pillar of
[57:13] fire he said it's an amber color that
[57:16] Amber yellowish green sober ram connects
[57:19] the emeralds here in Revelation 4 he
[57:23] drops back five hundred years to zekiel
[57:25] said it's the same color he says the
[57:27] same color we see the
[57:28] he said is Jesus Christ the same
[57:30] yesterday today and forever
[57:32] amen now barbra have said who is that
[57:36] man he said that man was the son of man
[57:39] see he said it was Christ hallelujah
[57:42] he said memmer that emerald color that's
[57:45] the color of light that's with the Lord
[57:47] he said it's the Lord's light that
[57:50] follows the Lord and it's as the Lord is
[57:53] amber yellowish green that's the same
[57:55] color of the light that's with us today
[57:57] as the scientist has took his picture
[57:59] yellowish green amber amen
[58:03] he said when I was a boy it was the same
[58:05] color when I seen it then he said I want
[58:08] you to remember he said God still exists
[58:11] in the same colors he said because it's
[58:14] been shot with a movie camera or a color
[58:16] camera today he said the Holy Spirit is
[58:19] still in his power still in his church
[58:21] in the last days he says there you are
[58:24] and then he points to the picture of the
[58:26] 1950 pillar of fire picture he said he
[58:29] said not me I was just standing there
[58:32] let me say it again not me
[58:35] I was just standing there right but it
[58:38] was a picture that was taken I want you
[58:41] to look at that just exactly what
[58:43] Ezekiel saw amen that's why that picture
[58:46] of the pillar fires so important I want
[58:47] them to make sure they emphasize that
[58:49] pillar of fire because that's the same
[58:51] thing Ezekiel saw Amen that's the same
[58:54] thing John saw the same thing brother
[58:56] Branham saw and God lets us see it today
[58:59] hallelujah and I would all acridness see
[59:01] it hallelujah I want all my family to
[59:04] see it I want everyone to see it to know
[59:06] that Jesus is the same pillar of fire
[59:08] today hallelujah glory now program says
[59:16] can you imagine that he said think of it
[59:18] we've seen that same pillar of fire
[59:20] today he said why can't I tell that the
[59:22] people why can't I make the world see it
[59:25] and he says the world wasn't meant to
[59:27] see it to see but we got to give the
[59:30] world a chance to see it right but we
[59:32] know not everybody will receive it he
[59:35] said but they can't see it it wasn't
[59:36] meant to them they'll never see it but
[59:38] the church is receiving the mightiest
[59:40] shaking it's ever
[59:41] had hey man Oh hallelujah he said then
[59:45] days the days of John and Ezekiel they
[59:47] couldn't take a picture of it now they
[59:49] can because they got the mechanical
[59:52] devices to do it amen and the ones who
[59:55] are trying to take mechanics to deny God
[59:57] comes right back around and proves there
[1:00:00] is a God amen like dr. Betts right he
[1:00:04] hired that photographer to try to prove
[1:00:06] there was no God and take a picture of
[1:00:09] brother Graham you know our picture of a
[1:00:11] doctor best of his fist under Bosworth
[1:00:13] chin they took it to disprove God and
[1:00:15] God uses it to prove that he's alive and
[1:00:17] well amen then brother Branham adds one
[1:00:22] scripture let's go to first John chapter
[1:00:23] 1 verse 5 remember this is just a short
[1:00:25] version of what he would preach but you
[1:00:27] can go back and listen to it if you like
[1:00:28] I just preached the things that I can
[1:00:30] prove in the scripture and that will
[1:00:32] help you just understand it to catch it
[1:00:33] first John 1:5 through 7 and Lydia can
[1:00:39] you read that when you got it first John
[1:00:41] 1:5 to 7 amen
[1:01:08] so brother Branham reads the scripture
[1:01:10] he says God is light he said God is
[1:01:13] light but man said God is eternal light
[1:01:15] that's light without ending right
[1:01:18] according to John after he had seen him
[1:01:21] in the vision so the scripture says he
[1:01:25] is eternal light and then I just added
[1:01:28] one myself because when in acts 9 3 when
[1:01:30] when Saul got knocked off the horse the
[1:01:32] Bible said something there Sean write
[1:01:34] about him a light from heaven same light
[1:01:37] same eternal light amen the pillar fire
[1:01:39] praise God
[1:01:41] all right thought number three that's
[1:01:42] the first thought on Jasper and sardine
[1:01:45] that's all I have from the scripture but
[1:01:46] like I said I'd like to preach more on
[1:01:48] that about the 12 stones but I mean a
[1:01:50] Jewish dictionary I'll tell you what I
[1:01:51] mean I'm gonna need a lot of scripture
[1:01:53] to teach that cuz I don't want to give
[1:01:54] you just Oh
[1:01:55] this is some doctors idea we got a note
[1:01:58] and then if it is Scripture it'll line
[1:02:00] up with everything else brother Branham
[1:02:01] said that's how you know it's the
[1:02:03] scripture because the Holy Ghost can't
[1:02:04] contradict himself all right now let's
[1:02:07] look at the rainbow
[1:02:08] yes the so verse 3 of Revelation 4 and a
[1:02:12] rainbow round about the throne now those
[1:02:15] are key words round about brother bran
[1:02:18] tells us now here's the first thing I'm
[1:02:22] sorry let me see if I got everything
[1:02:23] from the first thought just just a
[1:02:24] moment here seem like something struck
[1:02:26] me like I didn't get to okay no I got it
[1:02:28] okay yeah so John saw him in the mystery
[1:02:32] of his colors in light it's the same
[1:02:34] color as a pillar fire today like it in
[1:02:36] the fire right because Ezekiel saw he
[1:02:38] said there's he said there's amber he
[1:02:40] said then there's fire - hallelujah
[1:02:43] okay now the rainbow here's how brother
[1:02:48] Branham teaches the rainbow now we don't
[1:02:50] have to go there but Genesis 913 he said
[1:02:53] let's go back to when a rainbow first
[1:02:54] occurred here is Genesis 913 I do set my
[1:02:58] bow in the clouds and it shall be for a
[1:03:00] token a token of a covenant but twixt me
[1:03:04] and the earth so rainbow is a covenant
[1:03:08] between God and the earth and brother
[1:03:10] have said not God and Noah the covenant
[1:03:13] the covenant is not with God and Noah
[1:03:15] the covenant is with God and the earth
[1:03:17] praise God he didn't make a covenant
[1:03:20] with Noah it was to the earth and then
[1:03:24] he says and when it should come to pass
[1:03:25] when I bring a cloud over the earth that
[1:03:27] the bow shall be seen the cloud I will
[1:03:29] remember my covenant which is between E
[1:03:33] and you okay so that's the people and
[1:03:35] God now but it's the covenant between
[1:03:37] God and the earth isn't that interesting
[1:03:39] and that interesting that God sees the
[1:03:41] rainbow - cuz it doesn't let you know
[1:03:45] that God he's not a million miles away
[1:03:47] he's right here he's in another
[1:03:49] dimension but really close brother man
[1:03:52] makes it seem like that sometimes you
[1:03:53] know you got to fly past the Milky Way
[1:03:54] and all you might but if you do it's so
[1:03:57] close the Bible said he's so close from
[1:03:59] us he's not far from each one of us amen
[1:04:02] so see there God can even look and see
[1:04:05] there's the rainbow it reminds me of my
[1:04:07] covenant I made now we
[1:04:08] oh god I'll never forget it but God
[1:04:10] gives Noah these terms so Noah can try
[1:04:12] to understand what God is like and God
[1:04:14] said see when I see that rainbow it's a
[1:04:16] reminder of me of my covenant amen
[1:04:19] now Abraham said we find out then that a
[1:04:22] covenant is a token God said it was a
[1:04:25] token didn't he
[1:04:26] so token represents covenant and then
[1:04:30] but we know brother Branham preached
[1:04:31] later the token is the baptism of the
[1:04:33] Holy Ghost
[1:04:34] right and he said it's a token of what a
[1:04:36] sacrifice has been accepted and brother
[1:04:40] mem goes to Genesis 8 and he shows how
[1:04:42] as soon as Noah went out of the ark
[1:04:44] what's the first thing he did it wasn't
[1:04:47] get drunk it was built an altar worship
[1:04:51] the first thing after that that long
[1:04:53] flood the first thing he does is he
[1:04:56] worships after he gets through the the
[1:04:58] tribulation after he's carried through
[1:05:00] the tribulation the first thing he wants
[1:05:02] to do is get us animal sacrifice it and
[1:05:05] say thank you lord thank you for
[1:05:07] bringing me through see he's trusting in
[1:05:10] his sacrifice he's trusting in the blood
[1:05:12] and so are we we're trusting in the
[1:05:14] blood tonight it'll be the first thing
[1:05:15] we do after a hard trial I'll tell you
[1:05:17] it all be the first thing we do in a
[1:05:19] hard trial amen
[1:05:21] it won't be the first thing we do before
[1:05:23] a hard trial is worship the Lord Jesus
[1:05:25] Christ and remember that his sacrifice
[1:05:28] of his blood is accepted by God amen now
[1:05:32] the next thing he says a rainbow is a
[1:05:36] covenant between God and the earth and
[1:05:39] all humanity not just Noah all humanity
[1:05:42] he says now the second thing we notice
[1:05:44] about the rainbow he said Noah and John
[1:05:48] both saw that God's covenant were
[1:05:52] accepted praise God
[1:05:54] so see Noah saw the rainbow there on the
[1:05:57] earth and we just saw it a few weeks ago
[1:05:58] my wife took a picture that was the most
[1:05:59] beautiful rainbow picture I've ever seen
[1:06:01] in my life that was beautified I know
[1:06:03] that was gorgeous huh and so Noah saw
[1:06:07] the natural rainbow but now John sees a
[1:06:10] rainbow as well and so bold proof that
[1:06:14] God keeps his covenant praise the Lord
[1:06:16] he said Jesus he said same thing that
[1:06:19] John saw John saw Jesus
[1:06:22] body God's accepted covenant surrounding
[1:06:27] in the heavens and he says around about
[1:06:31] the throne in the sight like an emerald
[1:06:33] and amber green light around the throne
[1:06:37] and he said Noah's rainbow consisted of
[1:06:41] seven colors how many other seven colors
[1:06:43] ROYGBIV did you learn that in school
[1:06:45] ROYGBIV okay it's red if you take that's
[1:06:48] an acronym red orange yellow green blue
[1:06:51] indigo violet those are the seven colors
[1:06:54] in the rainbow and brother Brown names
[1:06:55] them there he names them in the sermon
[1:06:57] and he said these seven colors he said
[1:07:00] don't you see God in His seven color
[1:07:03] rainbow his covenant that he made a
[1:07:06] covenant that through the seven church
[1:07:09] ages the seven colors he would save the
[1:07:11] earth hahaha glory God is going to save
[1:07:14] the earth the people on the earth
[1:07:16] through the seven church ages through
[1:07:19] the blood of His Son Jesus Christ
[1:07:21] that's the only way you'll be saving the
[1:07:23] church ages is through the rainbow
[1:07:24] colors of the seven Church ages the
[1:07:27] seven messengers the seven messengers of
[1:07:29] God's Holy Word oh that's beautiful
[1:07:33] hallelujah seven colors represent seven
[1:07:36] church ages that's how God is gonna save
[1:07:39] the earth amen
[1:07:41] oh I'm so glad to be saving this hour
[1:07:43] aren't you Oh hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:07:46] Jesus the fourth thing he says about the
[1:07:50] rainbow is this rainbow is not the same
[1:07:54] size or not the same shape as Noah's he
[1:07:57] said when Noah saw him it was half a
[1:08:00] rainbow right you go outside it well
[1:08:04] maybe it's like a little over half right
[1:08:05] maybe it starts to bend a little bit you
[1:08:07] know in their home or maybe not I don't
[1:08:09] know I wasn't look at the picture I
[1:08:10] can't remember but when you see about
[1:08:12] half of a rainbow but he said that's
[1:08:14] what Noah saw Noah and us today we see
[1:08:16] half a rainbow but brother them catches
[1:08:19] he said notice the rainbow John saw was
[1:08:23] an emerald color and surrounded he said
[1:08:26] the whole throne of God and he said it
[1:08:30] looks like a halo of light so it's not a
[1:08:34] half it's a halo like the
[1:08:36] halo around our prophet brother branham
[1:08:39] like that and he said notice this whole
[1:08:43] rainbow represents this he says the half
[1:08:47] has not been told about the glory of God
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:52] you and I see rainbows but we just see
[1:08:54] half today so the rainbow the full
[1:08:57] rainbow around the throne means that we
[1:08:59] in heaven will learn all of God's
[1:09:01] mysteries throughout eternity praise God
[1:09:03] we're only seeing a half of it now or
[1:09:06] the glory and the crucifixion the
[1:09:08] resurrection the church ages you know
[1:09:10] all the Old Testament types
[1:09:11] foreshadowing Jesus Christ we're just
[1:09:13] seeing the half of it now but in heaven
[1:09:16] or we'll know who I have the hidden
[1:09:17] manna remember that we'll have the
[1:09:19] hidden manna the name written on the
[1:09:21] stone we'll have all this and God will
[1:09:23] make every mystery known to us but the
[1:09:25] half has not been told right now that
[1:09:28] scripture remember in he in first Kings
[1:09:30] 10 7 remember that when the Queen of
[1:09:33] Sheba came and she said this is so
[1:09:35] glorious that the half has not been told
[1:09:38] she's like my god that's such a glorious
[1:09:41] side the half has not been told and
[1:09:43] that's what we can say today hallelujah
[1:09:45] and I say like this that was a
[1:09:48] foreshadowing of the Millennium right
[1:09:49] because Solomon was the son of David
[1:09:52] the Millennium will be Christ as the son
[1:09:54] of David so we'll give the Millennium
[1:09:56] and we'll still say the half has not
[1:09:57] been told we'll have all eternity for
[1:10:01] God to reveal all was great truth to us
[1:10:04] amen because member church even the
[1:10:07] millennium it's going to be glorious but
[1:10:11] we will not be with all the same people
[1:10:13] yet if we have friends or family that
[1:10:15] did not receive the Holy Ghost they
[1:10:17] won't be there and still all the
[1:10:19] judgments haven't happen remember the
[1:10:21] white throne judgment is going to show
[1:10:23] everybody's life all their works and
[1:10:24] everything is going to be revealed there
[1:10:26] it's true in the Millennium the half has
[1:10:29] not been told we're just gonna have new
[1:10:31] homes the Bible said a child will lead a
[1:10:33] snake like a lamb you know it'll eat it
[1:10:36] in that striking I don't know how that's
[1:10:37] going to work the line will day lay down
[1:10:40] with the lamb all these animals will
[1:10:41] have their fellowship or the meat eaters
[1:10:44] will eat grass the line we grass the
[1:10:46] Bible said we're gonna build houses
[1:10:49] the Bible said you and I will rule
[1:10:51] nations if we got the Holy Ghost we will
[1:10:54] rule nations can you imagine and then
[1:10:58] the you might remember the population is
[1:11:00] going to increase increase because the
[1:11:01] Bible said a child will die a hundred
[1:11:02] years old did you know that there's
[1:11:05] going to be a population remember Satan
[1:11:06] comes at the end of that at the battle
[1:11:09] gog and magog he deceives all the
[1:11:11] nations and they rally around Jerusalem
[1:11:13] one more time but then fire comes down
[1:11:15] and destroys them
[1:11:16] isn't that interesting that's what the
[1:11:18] Bible says here but so see it's true
[1:11:21] even the Millennium that half will not
[1:11:24] be told but brother Graham said the
[1:11:25] Millennium so glorious you don't want to
[1:11:27] miss it oh ma you don't want to miss it
[1:11:31] make sure you get born again like we
[1:11:32] said on Sunday don't try to sneak in
[1:11:34] window come God's provided way say God
[1:11:36] I'll act any way you want I'll shout
[1:11:39] I'll scream I'll cry I'll speak in
[1:11:41] tongues I'll prophesy I just want the
[1:11:43] Holy Ghost amen
[1:11:44] if you come that way God will fill you
[1:11:46] amen Oh hallelujah glory he said the
[1:11:52] half see Noah just saw half because the
[1:11:54] half has not been told oh thank you Lord
[1:11:58] Jesus
[1:11:59] no brother branham the fifth thought
[1:12:01] brother ram breaks it about rainbow is
[1:12:04] that diamonds produce rainbows let me
[1:12:06] know that now can I get the picture here
[1:12:09] yeah it's coming up after this so this
[1:12:12] and I think that in the person was
[1:12:13] inspired because when you look at a
[1:12:15] diamond it kind of looks like that like
[1:12:16] little shapes inside of a diamond you
[1:12:18] know it looks like little diamonds there
[1:12:19] actually but bodiham tells his story he
[1:12:23] had an usher at his church who used to
[1:12:25] work in Africa at a diamond producing or
[1:12:27] diamond mining company and he said the
[1:12:31] rocks were crushed with 40 tons of
[1:12:33] weight from a machine and he said all
[1:12:36] the rocks were crushed he said but those
[1:12:37] diamonds the Diamonds the big thick ones
[1:12:39] he said would push that 40-ton crusher
[1:12:42] up so they couldn't crush the diamonds
[1:12:45] because the diamonds were so hard and he
[1:12:49] said but once they sifted through the
[1:12:51] rocks he said they had a little a little
[1:12:54] shelf and a little uh when they caught
[1:12:58] the line the assembly line that's what
[1:13:00] I'm trying to say assembly line
[1:13:02] something like that
[1:13:03] yeah and he said they got all the rocks
[1:13:05] wet he said but there was a little pad
[1:13:09] that had vaseline on it you can look it
[1:13:11] up another man said that he said meet it
[1:13:12] what's that word
[1:13:13] what are we got in the cabinet and she's
[1:13:14] at Vaseline he's got a Vaseline on it he
[1:13:17] said in all the wet stuff would pass
[1:13:19] smile the wet rocks
[1:13:20] it wouldn't attach he said but that the
[1:13:22] diamonds would be dry and so the drug
[1:13:25] the diamonds would attach to that
[1:13:26] Vaseline pad or whatever it was and then
[1:13:30] brother man makes that same he said but
[1:13:32] then after that once you had all the
[1:13:33] diamonds they needed cut in order to
[1:13:37] show forth their glory and then brother
[1:13:40] branham said see these diamonds were
[1:13:41] just one great big ball he says but when
[1:13:45] they cut it it's to reflect the fiery
[1:13:49] colors of its karat and it'll reflect
[1:13:51] seven colors also and brother Brahimi
[1:13:55] Thompson before he goes on he said make
[1:13:57] sure you find that jewel that diamond
[1:14:00] he said that diamond Jesus Christ he
[1:14:03] said it'll make a man sell all his
[1:14:05] wealth he's got and give everything away
[1:14:07] just to get that pearl of great price
[1:14:09] now I'm getting into pearls and diamonds
[1:14:11] but you understand he's the diamond of
[1:14:13] great price and then he said what was it
[1:14:17] here's the picture now I know gemologist
[1:14:21] okay like I told you that a few weeks
[1:14:22] ago I don't know nothing about gems I'm
[1:14:24] just taking their word for it so I could
[1:14:26] be totally wrong I'm just trusting that
[1:14:28] they got their facts right but here's my
[1:14:30] brother have said that great jewel what
[1:14:31] was it it was perfect
[1:14:34] he said God he said Jesus was 33 years
[1:14:38] old he said Jesus took 1/3 I'm sorry God
[1:14:40] took a 33 and a half year old diamond
[1:14:43] and God put it through the big bumping
[1:14:45] machine and then he took it over there
[1:14:47] and began to shape it and he cut it and
[1:14:50] he mashed it up and bruised it on
[1:14:51] Calvary day men he said he was wounded
[1:14:54] for our transgressions bruised for our
[1:14:56] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:14:58] was upon him and with His stripes we
[1:15:00] were healed so bananas that Jesus was
[1:15:03] cut on Calvary amen
[1:15:06] remember only a diamond can cut another
[1:15:08] diamond either so God in His Diamond
[1:15:12] character it was God cutting his Sun God
[1:15:16] was a
[1:15:17] because memory said you can't take my
[1:15:19] life I give it up
[1:15:20] he said pilot you could have no power
[1:15:23] except it was given to you by my father
[1:15:27] the mother man said what did God do to
[1:15:30] that perfect man there's only one of
[1:15:32] them in the world only one and that was
[1:15:34] Jesus God chiseled him off there he was
[1:15:39] wounded for our transgressions because I
[1:15:41] was a sinner listen God let the rainbow
[1:15:44] light of his seven Church ages flash
[1:15:48] upon me ha ha ha glory to know that he
[1:15:52] was wounded for my transgressions amen
[1:15:56] look what this says the way that
[1:15:58] diamonds reflect light is unique inside
[1:16:01] the stone the diamond will Sparkle gray
[1:16:03] and white notice brilliance well outside
[1:16:05] the gem it will reflect rainbow colors
[1:16:08] onto other surfaces so that's how you
[1:16:12] know a true diamond a true diamond
[1:16:14] doesn't have the rainbow inside of it
[1:16:16] the true diamond reflects the rainbow so
[1:16:19] it shines on two other surfaces oh
[1:16:22] that's how you know Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:24] true diamond of God when he was cut he
[1:16:27] shined the glorious light of the church
[1:16:28] ages and it landed on the surface of
[1:16:31] Adam rege oh boy it landed on the
[1:16:33] surface of Connie Clippers that right
[1:16:35] and landing on the surface or surface of
[1:16:38] Jose Lopez is that right it's shining
[1:16:41] now and it reflected and the light of
[1:16:43] Laodicea is shining and reflecting on
[1:16:45] you and I hey man that's beautiful
[1:16:49] that's the thought brother branham
[1:16:50] brings out of there so I thought I'd
[1:16:51] show you a picture
[1:16:52] see how it's shining out like you can
[1:16:53] see the rainbow can't you see the
[1:16:54] rainbow hope you can see the rim if not
[1:16:55] I need a better picture that's the best
[1:16:57] one I could get by the grace of the Lord
[1:17:00] so I can say thank you Jesus for being
[1:17:02] cut because your rainbow light is now
[1:17:04] shining on me and I'm walking the light
[1:17:07] as Lydia read as he is in the light
[1:17:10] praise the Lord
[1:17:14] okay let me let me bring this thought
[1:17:18] real quick if you listen to the the
[1:17:20] quote let me rightly divide the word of
[1:17:21] truth if you listen to this sermon
[1:17:23] brother Branham said these seven lights
[1:17:25] of the rainbow represent the seven
[1:17:26] fruits of the spirit did you catch that
[1:17:31] there's not seven fruits of the spirit
[1:17:33] there's nine so I just want to show you
[1:17:36] let's do a little exercise of rightly
[1:17:38] dividing the word because I had to do
[1:17:40] that on Sunday too
[1:17:41] I was just trying to show you you
[1:17:43] everything brother Branham says you have
[1:17:44] to take it back to the scripture if not
[1:17:48] you're just taking his word for it which
[1:17:50] is okay sometimes right I just did that
[1:17:52] tonight with Jasper and sardine eyed
[1:17:54] most the time but let's let's look at
[1:17:57] this just real quick cuz here's here's
[1:17:58] the quote what he says he said these
[1:18:00] seven spirits of God are the seven
[1:18:02] fruits of the spirit but you know if you
[1:18:04] count in your Bible let's count can we
[1:18:05] count one two three four five six seven
[1:18:09] eight nine there's nine fruits of the
[1:18:11] spirit so Church I'm not trying to be a
[1:18:14] smart aleck I hope you know that I just
[1:18:17] want you to understand when you listen
[1:18:18] to brother Branham you need to take
[1:18:19] everything he says back to the scripture
[1:18:21] so what if I got up here and said I
[1:18:23] preach my those seven rainbow cars
[1:18:25] represent the seven fruits of the spirit
[1:18:26] well that means you you're missing two
[1:18:28] of them you might not have meekness
[1:18:30] you might not you could use some
[1:18:32] deference you understand so I want to
[1:18:37] just show you this because later on
[1:18:38] brother BAM he corrects it in the church
[1:18:40] age book with the help of you know Lee
[1:18:42] veils writing but he said the seven
[1:18:44] spirits of God referred to the
[1:18:46] continuous ministry of the same holy
[1:18:48] spirit lives of seven men with whom God
[1:18:50] identifies himself very closely that's
[1:18:53] what the seven seven lights or colors
[1:18:55] represent seven church ages and each
[1:18:59] Holy Ghost ministry of each of the seven
[1:19:01] messengers does ever understand and
[1:19:03] people might criticize the same well
[1:19:06] brother Jesse or you're just trying to
[1:19:07] correct brother Brown no I'm not I'm
[1:19:09] trying to get all the proof from brother
[1:19:10] Brown oh I'm sorry all the truth I can
[1:19:12] from mother Branham but you at the same
[1:19:13] time he's human and if we catch a
[1:19:16] mistake it's not Oscar acting it's the
[1:19:18] Holy Spirit correcting him they
[1:19:20] understand that and I'll get the quote
[1:19:22] later brother Ram wants to be corrected
[1:19:24] if he's wrong and if you're wrong you
[1:19:26] want to be corrected if you're wrong if
[1:19:28] you're a real Christian
[1:19:29] but if you're prideful make-believe or
[1:19:32] prideful foolish version you don't want
[1:19:34] to be corrected but if you're a wise
[1:19:35] version the Bible said of a wise man you
[1:19:38] correct them he'll love you even more
[1:19:40] yeah and I've been misunderstood like I
[1:19:43] said mr. stone but understood by a
[1:19:45] couple people have come to me personally
[1:19:46] or email me personally about trying to
[1:19:49] make it seem like I'm trying to correct
[1:19:50] brother Bram no I'm not I'm just trying
[1:19:52] to take make sure everything he teaches
[1:19:53] that I and then I preach is going back
[1:19:56] to the Bible can I give you an example
[1:19:59] can I give you another example in the
[1:20:01] message the Feast of the trumpets
[1:20:02] program said that there's 7 weeks from
[1:20:05] Pentecost to Tabernacles and there's not
[1:20:09] there's more than that there's a lot
[1:20:11] more than that
[1:20:12] but bro Graham just makes a simple
[1:20:14] mistake and here he admits it he says
[1:20:16] like the other day I got something mixed
[1:20:17] up this is in questions and answers
[1:20:18] after he preached the trumpets I happen
[1:20:21] if you happen to hear I you said I
[1:20:23] caught it right there it's on the tape
[1:20:24] I'll probably hear from it which is good
[1:20:26] wouldn't you want if you preach three
[1:20:29] times a week like me you would want to
[1:20:31] hear when you're wrong so I can fix it
[1:20:33] the next time I don't wanna keep
[1:20:34] preaching the same thing over and over
[1:20:36] again and it's wrong I'd feel like a
[1:20:37] fool at the end of that I want to preach
[1:20:40] what's right how many wonder how many
[1:20:41] want to hear what's right let me give
[1:20:44] you a story one time so you'd have to
[1:20:45] read that just look at me just for a
[1:20:46] moment to tell you those story that's a
[1:20:48] lot of words he kind of you know it's
[1:20:50] just programs you know kind of going
[1:20:51] back and forth the reason this is
[1:20:53] important Church is because you remember
[1:20:55] how many member of the late James
[1:20:56] Browning he told me a story one time he
[1:21:00] said before when he was a young preacher
[1:21:04] he believed everything brother Branham
[1:21:05] said and never questioned it ever and
[1:21:07] brother Branham said when Jesus was
[1:21:09] baptized he said God said this is my
[1:21:12] beloved son and whom I'm well pleased to
[1:21:15] dwell in and brother Ram preaches it
[1:21:17] over and over again see he dwelled in
[1:21:19] and he dwelled in him and brother James
[1:21:20] heard him say that and he was witnessing
[1:21:22] to denominational preacher he said no
[1:21:24] God did well in Jesus because at his
[1:21:26] baptism God said I'm well pleased and
[1:21:30] whom I dwell in and the preacher said
[1:21:31] the DA Risha preachers said no that's
[1:21:33] not in the Bible and James told me he
[1:21:35] got all upset he said yes it is I'll
[1:21:36] prove it to you he said he went home he
[1:21:39] said a prophet said it if a prophet said
[1:21:41] that I believe it I see
[1:21:43] see how you gotta be careful he got all
[1:21:46] mad at the denomination and the
[1:21:48] denominational guy said he got mad too
[1:21:49] so he went home he looked up every time
[1:21:52] in the four Gospels of Jesus baptism and
[1:21:54] the Bible never says please to dwell in
[1:21:57] he said who in whom I'm well pleased but
[1:22:00] to dwell in is never in the Bible and I
[1:22:03] challenge you go home tonight read your
[1:22:04] Bible so now you have some spiritual
[1:22:05] homework if you want to and brother
[1:22:07] James said he was humbled because he he
[1:22:11] took something that was said and he
[1:22:13] didn't take it back to the Bible and he
[1:22:14] had to go back he said I had to go back
[1:22:16] to that denominational preacher and say
[1:22:17] I'm sorry I was wrong and he said it
[1:22:22] taught him to always of course we always
[1:22:24] respect God's servants brother Branham
[1:22:25] but it just teaches us everything he
[1:22:28] says is not thus sayeth the Lord
[1:22:30] most of it is but we've got to go back
[1:22:33] and make sure everything we believe is
[1:22:35] actually found in the scripture does
[1:22:37] everyone understand so see if he would
[1:22:39] if James would have done that he said he
[1:22:41] told me he would not had to apologise to
[1:22:44] the nomination preacher but Church James
[1:22:47] didn't that didn't bother James because
[1:22:49] a Christian doesn't mind being pretty
[1:22:50] corrected is that right to see that's
[1:22:53] why I'm doing this good if we take
[1:22:55] everything back to the word it'll save
[1:22:57] us from getting upset right it'll save
[1:23:00] us from saying something that ain't
[1:23:02] exactly right so that's why I'm trying
[1:23:04] to go through this because I'm listening
[1:23:06] to the sermon I'm going to preach it to
[1:23:07] you tonight and brother Ram said the
[1:23:08] seven colors represent seven fruits of
[1:23:10] the spirit but there's not seven fruits
[1:23:12] in spirit there's nine he has a preacher
[1:23:15] I have a choice am I gonna try to preach
[1:23:17] that and I wanted it any of you catch
[1:23:19] that when I first said it that there's
[1:23:20] more than seven fruits that anybody
[1:23:22] catch that I don't know but see the
[1:23:25] Bible the Holy Spirit would help you
[1:23:27] catch it later on sometime if you're
[1:23:29] reading your Bible does that make sense
[1:23:31] by God's grace so here's the mistake
[1:23:34] brother Ram said but there's seven weeks
[1:23:36] from Passover to Pentecost how we know
[1:23:39] that because Pentecost means fifty does
[1:23:42] everybody understand that
[1:23:43] and fifty forty nine seven times seven
[1:23:46] is forty-nine plus one more fifty so
[1:23:48] brother Ram in the sermon he said there
[1:23:50] are seven weeks from Pentecost to
[1:23:52] Tabernacles but there's wait there's
[1:23:53] more than seven because here here you
[1:23:56] have you know three
[1:23:57] weeks and then for weeks that's rt7 and
[1:24:00] then for more that's eleven and then for
[1:24:03] more that's like 15 so bro DRAM just
[1:24:07] made a mistake he was talking about this
[1:24:09] but he said from Pentecost to
[1:24:11] Tabernacles there seven weeks brother
[1:24:13] man makes a mistake a preacher caught it
[1:24:15] and corrected him and brother Branham
[1:24:18] says this I'm sorry next one brother
[1:24:22] Graham said Oh remember the Sheep turns
[1:24:24] into the loaf of bread at that time see
[1:24:26] when the Sheep of the sheep he says then
[1:24:28] all goes into one loaf it's a great
[1:24:29] teaching I didn't touch the edge of it
[1:24:31] but if you happen to catch that mistake
[1:24:33] on your tape remember what does he say
[1:24:35] look in the Bible
[1:24:38] I'll church I hope you I hope you hug
[1:24:40] your Bible a little tighter tonight when
[1:24:41] you leave this place see when we really
[1:24:45] think we know something we got to make
[1:24:47] sure we really know it we got to make
[1:24:48] sure it's right in the Word of God
[1:24:50] see sober Adam says if I make a mistake
[1:24:52] he said that's fine he's I heard him
[1:24:55] pray 1961 he said Oh God forgive me for
[1:24:56] my many mistakes in 1960 he was humble
[1:25:00] he realized I'm just a man of course
[1:25:03] he's led by the Holy Spirit but God
[1:25:04] still lets us makes make mistakes to
[1:25:06] keep us humble now here's the quote
[1:25:08] where brother Graham would always like
[1:25:09] to be corrected a Baptist minister this
[1:25:11] is from who's this Melchizedek about
[1:25:14] this minister a few weeks ago come up in
[1:25:15] to my house and said I'd like to
[1:25:17] straighten you out on your Godhead
[1:25:18] sometime when you got the time what
[1:25:20] about the RAM say no I'd never have time
[1:25:21] to be corrected is that what he said get
[1:25:24] out of my house you can't correct me
[1:25:26] I'm the prophet of God look how strong I
[1:25:28] am I see visions you don't look was he
[1:25:31] prideful or humble humble there's my
[1:25:34] hour so let me set it for five minutes
[1:25:37] look how humble he is Church now a
[1:25:40] Baptist minister who doesn't know the
[1:25:41] message of the hour in 1965 he already
[1:25:44] preached his seven seals he already
[1:25:45] preached all those revelations and what
[1:25:48] does he say I said I got time next week
[1:25:52] now he said I got time right now because
[1:25:56] I want to be straight and we lay aside
[1:25:59] everything else to do it so see brother
[1:26:03] man
[1:26:03] time I make a mistake I need to lay
[1:26:05] aside for me - I need lay aside when I'm
[1:26:07] doing if somebody's got a question for
[1:26:08] me and I need to help answer that
[1:26:09] question if I possibly can if I've done
[1:26:11] something wrong he said mother Brad you
[1:26:14] teach there there's one just or just one
[1:26:16] guy he said yes sir
[1:26:17] he said well I believe there's one God
[1:26:19] but one God in three persons and brother
[1:26:21] BAM said he said did you just hear what
[1:26:23] you just said one God in three persons
[1:26:25] he said that doesn't even make sense and
[1:26:27] then he takes him through the scripture
[1:26:28] how it's one God you know not three
[1:26:30] three persons now does that help by
[1:26:33] God's grace so see even when you listen
[1:26:36] to every tape we want to make sure we
[1:26:37] want to take it back to the Bible okay
[1:26:40] cuz we don't save us it'll save us from
[1:26:42] having to apologize for making a mistake
[1:26:44] and also from exalting brother branham
[1:26:46] to highly making every word he said thus
[1:26:49] saith the LORD which is idol worship so
[1:26:52] I hope that helps you and I just thought
[1:26:54] it was so inspired I was listening that
[1:26:55] this morning when I was studying and I
[1:26:57] heard him say seven spirits and seven
[1:26:58] fruits of the spirit there's nine fruits
[1:27:00] of the spirit see that so that's what is
[1:27:02] that that's the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:27:04] thinking man's filter aren't you glad
[1:27:06] for a thinking man's filter alright
[1:27:09] let's finish up I got a couple minutes I
[1:27:10] just want to show you that's a little
[1:27:12] exercise and rightly dividing the word
[1:27:13] of God alright let me close with this
[1:27:20] insight like an
[1:27:22] so we're going back to that picture
[1:27:23] Rhoda has said the same thing that John
[1:27:25] saw now I read I read this earlier and
[1:27:27] around him was a rainbow about the
[1:27:30] throne in the sight like an emerald
[1:27:31] ambarish green light around the throne
[1:27:33] he said praise be to God he said see I'm
[1:27:36] sorry so so we see him in the circle bow
[1:27:39] of green amber color this greenish what
[1:27:43] does green represent life brother he
[1:27:47] talks about see green is evergreen all
[1:27:48] he stays green is life what does it mean
[1:27:50] that God has promised he took a oath
[1:27:52] back there in Genesis that he would no
[1:27:54] put no rainbow in the sky that he would
[1:27:56] no more destroy the world by water he
[1:27:58] also takes his Othon swears by himself
[1:28:00] and all the seed of Abraham it raised up
[1:28:02] and this world will stand all of its
[1:28:04] shaking judgments the judgments were
[1:28:06] going through on the future lessons we
[1:28:08] got coming we'll show you where this
[1:28:09] world will belch and turn into volcanic
[1:28:12] sand blow to pieces and upside down and
[1:28:14] everything he says oh how we're longing
[1:28:17] to see that day he promised that great
[1:28:19] millennium would come and another thing
[1:28:21] the reason he was surrounded by the
[1:28:24] rainbow is because he's a
[1:28:25] covenant-keeping god he will keep his
[1:28:28] covenant so God put a covenant or a
[1:28:32] symbol of a covenant around him to show
[1:28:34] that Christ is in the myths or Christ is
[1:28:37] in the very heart of the promise amen
[1:28:41] aren't you glad church every at the
[1:28:43] heart of every promise of God there
[1:28:45] stands Jesus Christ he is in the middle
[1:28:48] of every promise of God he's at the very
[1:28:51] center he's at the very core of every
[1:28:54] promise of God and what does the amber
[1:28:56] represent what does it represent life
[1:28:58] God's eternal life he swore by no
[1:29:01] greater so he swears by his own life
[1:29:03] amen
[1:29:04] and here's the last thing that's an or
[1:29:07] feet this is what I'm adding so brother
[1:29:09] Aaron didn't say this but look at this
[1:29:11] this is going to lead into the next
[1:29:12] sermon hopefully well maybe not the next
[1:29:14] one but one of the future ones
[1:29:16] look what emerald means in the Greek of
[1:29:20] emerald made of emerald a light green
[1:29:24] gem that represented Judah in the high
[1:29:27] priests breastplate and that beautiful
[1:29:32] emerald was Judas color apparently so
[1:29:35] what does it show
[1:29:36] this emerald glow around Jesus showing
[1:29:39] that he's the Lion of the tribe oh hey
[1:29:44] Lu yeah
[1:29:45] he had to come out of Judah right he had
[1:29:47] to come out of the praises of God he
[1:29:49] came out of the humble tribe of Judah he
[1:29:53] loved the Lord tonight I'm finishing up
[1:29:56] with that by the grace of Lord we just
[1:29:57] pray for me pray for me that God will
[1:29:59] show me maybe some Jewish encyclopedia
[1:30:01] or something that we can preach he's out
[1:30:03] but I know it's so gracious the Alpha
[1:30:05] and Omega and then the emerald round
[1:30:07] about the throne there of his covenant
[1:30:09] that God keeps his covenant he is the
[1:30:12] Lion of the tribe of Judah tonight I'm
[1:30:14] so glad to serve this holy God that we
[1:30:16] have praise the Lord that's just our
[1:30:18] heads for a word of Prayer tonight
[1:30:22] how many would say brother Jesse pray
[1:30:25] for me that I'll remember that God is
[1:30:26] always at the center of every one of his
[1:30:28] promises then I'll remember that at the
[1:30:31] heart of every promise is God's life
[1:30:33] itself
[1:30:33] god bless those hands my hands are up to
[1:30:37] Heavenly Father we just raise our hands
[1:30:40] to you Lord or raise our hearts to you

[1:30:57] your covenant is true your Holy Ghost

[1:31:07] earth for the Old Testament but the
