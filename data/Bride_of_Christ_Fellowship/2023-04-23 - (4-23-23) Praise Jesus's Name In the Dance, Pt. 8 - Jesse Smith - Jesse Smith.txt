TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's go to Psalm 149 I'd like to continue this series on praising his name with the dance Psalm 149 verse 1. appreciate those songs brother Hallelujah psalm 149. yeah I've been reading through the Psalms I mean I just finished chapter 119 this morning at the longest chapter in the entire Bible just filled with such beautiful thoughts I wanted to preach it this morning but I don't know if I got enough or enough time to do that actually I might run out of time but Lord wouldn't maybe we'll look at that on Wednesday by God's grace just a beautiful chapter if you haven't read that in a while I'd encourage you to consider reading that it's as long as the entire book of Philippians that one chapter you know the same length length any short book of the Bible it's just beautiful the Treasure Trove of blessings praise God Psalm 149 verse I'll read one and two and then we can all read verse three together Praise You the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and praise His name in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let's read verse three ready one two three let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and heart I just got to read four and five for the lord taketh pleasure in bride of Christ Fellowship he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the High Praise of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand praise may God as blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise God I'm just feeling you know led to can kind of continue on this thought here by God's grace so we'll keep going here and try to pull out as many encouraging thoughts as possible this morning you know the title of course praised his name with the dance boat the subtopic is we'd say maybe the joy of the Lord we want to look at that this morning here by God's grace and God has given us many reasons to be joyful praise God so the song says count your blessings name them one by one praise God and you'll see what the Lord has done hallelujah he's done so much for us praise God I'd like to minister here also uh we'll forget to announce this brother uh but Austin's in a little a little contest there singing for Christian music so if you want to vote for him I think it's five bucks to vote for him you know so I put a vote in for our family this morning actually I put in a number of votes this morning for our family put a few extra votes in there for her but I think the church gets the money back is that right does it go to the charitable three percent okay praise God so uh we're thankful and it's just an encouraging way you know it's a good way to get uh you know brother it's a good way for brother Austin to use his gift for the Lord you know he's already got a couple testimonies back like oh this song blessed me I remember that one woman she's like I just played this for hours and hours on end you know remember you know that's how I do it too I'll find a song like I really like it I'll just put repeat one just play that all day I think when I was going in to preach it in the point where we had those Revival Services I think I played Sunday's coming for four straight days I think I'm not mistaken maybe three straight days Friday's good but Sunday's coming praise God so that's why I swear I normally do I just wear the song out praise God and then yeah you give a couple years it'll come back to the right season we'll sing that again you know like God's good think about that I mean think about how many years are we saying uh God has given us the victory I rose up this morning and it comes back yeah you say oh you're off it for a little while comes back it's fresh it's brand new like you never sang it praise God so uh we just want to say yeah if you if you want to feel led to vote you know I got the link I can share that maybe I'll do that maybe I'll share the link here probably easiest for me to do it since I I do the group text on uh the phones there but by God's grace we'd like to support our brother there so thank the Lord for him amen sister leaning there praise God hallelujah so I'd like to look at this dance series want to keep this going and like I said look at the joy of the Lord because it's so closely connected uh two dancing and so forth and you know we know the enemies work in overtime to take away our joy or or I should say like this maybe to distract us from our joy because I want to I want to remember you want to remember that if you're born again your soul has eternal life the soul can never sin so that means the soul always has Joy it always has peace right the the soul always has faith because it's God's Own spirit it's God's own life but what happens is we didn't we don't lose our joy what we do is we get distracted from our joy and we choose to uh or we just make the choice or you know when situations are forced upon us uh you know we we get distracted from the word of God and from the the blessing of God in our soul and then we get what's called and we get into mind battles we we got to go out to the battlefield to fight a fresh battle you know and uh and and so we're taking out to those battle the battlefield and we gotta fight and battle and it just so happens on many Wednesday nights and Sundays uh God gives us many victories praise God and we had to come back and sing and worship and the Music cast devils and help cast Devils out of our minds right you know mind battles and we get the victory on the battlefield praise God Amen we can remember all the blessings that God gives us in the soul praise God the life of God there in the soul and uh so you know we don't lose our joy uh you know David said that you know restore restore the joy and of course you know the Holy Ghost couldn't fall in the soul in his day so in his case that was restoring the joy in the mind and and we can say that's the same for us we need Joy restored in our mindset we've got to choose to meditate on the joyful things of God and that's that's where that scripture applies to us in the New Testament remember we are under a New Covenant better promises Hallelujah amen thank God and just remember the connection there with joy and dancing again uh you know this is the first time the dance and joy is used together together in the Bible within the same few verses after David got the victory came to pass as they came David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine that the women came out of all the cities of Israel singing and dance notice the women to meet King Saul with tabots with joy and when with instruments of music praise God and the women answer one another as they played and said Saul as slain as thousands and David is ten thousands Hallelujah Glory thank God so again we see the connection wherever there's joy there's dancing praise God and so we're we're we're taught this by the word of God we can see it plainly from the scripture uh Jeremiah 31 13 then shall the Virgin rejoice in the dance both young man and old together for I will turn their mourning into Joy and Will Comfort them and make them Rejoice from their sorrow Hallelujah we also know this is earlier in the chapter yeah let me go back here to Jeremiah 31 I think earlier in the chapter if God gives the promise to bring Joy back so just bear with me here let me turn to Jeremiah 31. I think I preached this earlier in the series here yep there it is praise God yeah let's go to verse three Jeremiah 31 3 if you got your Bibles the Lord had the period of old unto me saying yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love somebody ought to say Amen to that praise God if God loved Israel that much he also said the same about the Gentiles praise God remember in Romans chapter 9 he said he said I will call people that were not my people I will call them my beloved amen hallelujah the ones that I love amen I have lovely with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee that's how God draws you closer to him he shows you his love he shows you his care he shows you his provision he shows you the cross again amen he shows you the resurrection hallelujah praise God he shows you all these blessings the great loving kindness and that draws us closer back into fellowship with him praise God he reminds us of all that he's done for us praise God and I like verse four again what a promise we have church again I will build thee so you may feel like you know life has tore me down it's it's it's broken up all all the bricks of my life where we'd say or you know uh it's broken down the walls with my trials and my all the battles I face has just tore me down but God said I will build thee again amen and thou shalt be built o Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tablets and shall go forth in the dances of them that make Mary praise God your life your life may look uh destroyed it may look defeated it may look downtrodden but God said I'll build you up again I'll draw you unto me with my love amen hallelujah and I'll make you I'll give you a reason to dance amen I'll give you a reason to praise the Lord hallelujah amen what a blessing praise God I just want you if you got your Bibles there let's go to uh Psalm 119 there I want to read this for just for a reference here church I you know I preached it there you know and the point also here too but remember if if you're waiting on God remind God of his promises remember it's okay to complain as long as you're telling the situation but end the complaint with hope praise God and then you quote Psalm 119 49 and 50. that's what we need to quote this is uh anointed now some people think Hezekiah wrote this chapter some people think David they don't say but it is one of Just A Beautiful chapter of the longest chapter in the Bible now look here's the prayer here's the psalm verse 49. Psalm 119 49 remember the word unto thy servant upon which thou has caused me to Hope he's saying God you're the one who made the promise you caused me to Hope in it now now I'm saying remember that promise amen amen amen so it just shows God doesn't answer every prayer immediately you know God doesn't give you every promise right when you want it and God in verse 50 this is my comfort in my affliction for the word hath quickened me praise God so when we're going through trials God wants us to remind him of his promises Lord remember you gave me this promise you wrote this in your word I'm reminding you of what you said this caused me to hope this scripture actually quickens me praise God this scripture actually encourages me and when I go through the trials Lord I'm going to remind you of your promises because I know you keep your word praise God that's why Jesus said keep knocking keep asking keep seeking God will open God will show it to us but God likes to see his children confess his promises back to him praise God God likes to see his children quote his own promise Hallelujah amen praise God I read that this morning I'm like that was yesterday and it might have been yesterday he calls me to Hope but I don't see it manifesting but then he says remember he says we're supposed to tell God remember your promise amen hallelujah praise God let's remind God what he said amen let me just remind God lord you promise to send a lot of rain hallelujah amen you promised a Rapture a bride who would not taste death Hallelujah praise God you promised to Philippian Jailer that die in thy house shall be saved God grant that God grant that great blessing to me praise God I know I'm not the Philippian Jailer but Lord I got the same desire I was baptized and I want to see the same faith in all my family members amen I really remember your promise Lord God amen so here's a promise here's a promise I'm going to give you a reason to dance again well the trouble is most message people never dance to begin with so that's the problem praise God and the reason is many times they don't experience the freedom of the Lord right the joy of the Lord or the other another reason could be they don't even really they never heard the real Gospel of Jesus Christ preach because when you really know the Gospel of Jesus Christ that all of your sin was put on Christ and then all of Christ's righteousness is put on you it has to produce something it has to produce a joy of God Amen hallelujah we're going to see it later even the Stony hearted person remember there's four kinds of hearts even the Stony heart which ended up being Judas not the Wayside that never believed it was a Sony or even the Sony heart when it heard the word Rejoice with joy even in church we're better than that it's by God's grace amen we're not a Sony hearted person that falls away When Trials come we keep believing praise God we keep having a good and honest heart praise God Amen and if Judas could have joy or or someone like that that fell away if someone could have joy and then Fall Away we should have joy and that Joy should continue amen like Jesus said he said I'm giving you my joy that's your joy might be full praise God Lord I don't want a half cup of Joy I wouldn't fall a cup of Joy amen Give Me A Reason devil at least a half a cup or a three-quarter cup or let my cup overflow amen amen sometimes we have overflowing Joy amen Hallelujah sometimes there are six hour Services too amen where the joys just overflowing my cup runs over praise God oh thank God Amen for the joy of the Lord amen and he promised that's right that was our prayer at the beginning of the year remember of 2023. that was our prayer Lord give us more reasons to rejoice give me more reasons to dance praise God I think sister Naomi was sharing after that Napoleon meeting she was Sharon I think it's okay if I share it you know she said her prayer at the beginning of January for the new year was Lord give us personal experiences with Jesus Christ we sure got them in Napoleon praise God right I thought what it was almost prophetic right for the little children they've been praying for a few years to get the Holy Ghost and I've just been preaching about eight or nine services on saith God I'll pour out my spear God pour out your spirit how many sermons did I preach that and I feel like God didn't pour out of the spirit and what should I have done I should have done just like the Bible said Lord remember your promise your promise caused me to hope that you'll pour out your spirit amen remember your word amen at the right time at the right season God will answer praise God amen hallelujah Glory God wants us to remember God wants us to Hope praise God God wants us to take all of our comfort not in Key Lime ice cream that's usually one of my favorites that we don't take comfort in that although sometimes it helps In the Flesh you know just a little bit now but God I'm just making a joke God don't want us to take any comfort and anything except the word of God hallelujah that's our comfort praise God amen he says this is my comfort and my Affliction for Thy word hath quickened me amen oh praise God hallelujah now remember again remember sin takes away the joy and the dance the joy of our heart is ceased our dances turn in the morning the crown has fallen from our head wound to us that we have sinned now that's a little bit a little bit of background let me just read a few more of these quotes here I got a couple of new ones here but they're very familiar as they March over Israel how beautiful that types our churches today how they cross through the Red Sea and then Moses began to sing in the spirit Miriam picked up the tambourine begin to dance just like an old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting I like that they were dancing like an old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting amen hallelujah praise God he said dancing and singing and praise the Lord why they had the victory they got the Victory and who got the victory for him was it Moses not exactly it was Christ amen Moses couldn't pull back the waters God just used Moses to move back the waters amen and when anything good happens in our midst it wasn't us it was God using us amen and that's why we rejoice in the victory Of God we've got the victory because Jesus gave us the victory oh amen grabbed a tambourine down by the bank she went beating this tamarine I ate like like what Cam said 86 years old being the damn right Hallelujah nobody's got an excuse here today praise God well I'm too old I'm too fragile no you're not actually you're just at about the right age amen you're actually kind of young for this calling and the daughter of his Israel Israel fouled her shouting and beating the tambourines and dancing and Moses sung in the spirit if that ain't an old-time Holy Ghost meeting I never seen one you got one man singing The Spirit uh he's up here singing and praising and you got all the sisters dancing and praising God and running around worshiping God everybody's praising God if that ain't an old Holy Ghost meeting I never seen one thank God we've seen him amen oh praise God that's why I told the children I said you ought to now be able to look at the book of Acts chapter 2 and say I know what that's like amen I was acting like I was drunk in this beer I've ever saw Haven or Paris or Acacia drunk that was a day I thought they were drunk praise God hallelujah praise God Amen that's all we want praise God Amen so they have an experience with God they know God keeps his word they know God pours out his fear praise God and we can have old-fashioned Holy Ghost meetings amen [Music] [Applause] God Amen I like this brother random talks in the church age book talk about Israel they were the Pentecostals of their day so are we they had taken Refuge under the blood who's taking Refuge under the blood they'd all been baptized in the Red Sea I haven't even baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they came up out of the waters singing this fear and dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost what gives you that energy brother Jesse to dance the Holy Ghost gives you that energy is that right while Miriam the prophetess played her tambourine oh don't you love that praise God and I like my brother I said in the church in his book he said our spirit is clean our spirit is fresh it's sober nevertheless full of the joy of the Lord praise God oh church that's why I like that song Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me give me a fresh feeling about coming to church give me a fresh feeling about reading my Bible about loving my family loving my children and loving God's people make it fresh Lord God because that's what your spirit is it's fresh hallelujah it's not stale like a denomination it's fresh praise God come on somebody amen it's fresh it's clean he said we just ought to be as just as exuberant about our religion as the world is about the NBA playoffs right whatever they got going on now maybe I don't know what they got going on in April some some heathenism somewhere probably no doubt but see it's the energy of the Holy Spirit praise God that produces this kind of worship I'm glad to be a Pentecostal of this day Hallelujah amen thank God now here's here's just a little balancing here now brother said now stand now when we're dancing like that we're not standing by the angel of the Lord we're just Anointed with the whole where I say just Anointed with the Holy Ghost see because because he says standing by the angel Lord you think you'll be shouting and screaming and of course you can take this back to the scripture you know John was in the presence of Jesus in Revelation 1 and he fell down like he was dead right Daniel had to Daniel fell down before the angel the angel had to touch him and raise him up he said uh that that degree of the spirit of God scares you to death nearly so there's a difference in rejoicing and bubble dancing I like bubbles because bubbles come from rushing waters and Jesus said when you got the Holy Ghost it's like a living water that bubbles up inside you amen yes I do bubble dance because I've got a living water bubbling up in me praise God of course I feel like I wrote a man cause of bubble dancing [Applause] bubbling is fresh water Hallelujah Artesian whale it's fresh water it's straight from God Almighty amen the Fountain of all goodness Purity and love but he said then coming down to that real thing yeah it's a fearful thing not that you fear that you're lost but you're really before Angelic being in the Holy Ghost himself standing there now Church let's just think about how often is that going to happen in our lives how often do you get to stand in the presence of an angel I don't maybe once in my life even then I'm guessing I don't even know there's times I felt like I was going to die worshiping God praying or singing or praying or something like that very few so some people will take this and they'll go to seed on this well we're too mature for bubble dancing and we need the fear of God well you need both actually you need both praise God the Bible said the Holy Ghost produces joy in your life that's what we're going to focus on this morning the Holy Ghost will produce joy in your life Hallelujah and of course I'm not going to ask you raise hands but who could feel like they need more joy expressed in their life so yeah even in Biden's economy yes even in Biden's economy yes two more good quotes and I noticed how dancing was the victory I thought well maybe I just hadn't got Victory enough maybe that's what it is maybe just a little bit of self has to die out yet like those other quotes brother Adam said it was Pride that kept him from dancing Pride self-confidence I know all about it I'm in control see God wants you to lose control praise God so he can take control Hallelujah that's right he said I was never on a dance floor in my life but I guess I did it all right that's the same thing I say now I did dance for the world I know I did it awful there was God tell me my friends told me they said you don't have any beat you don't have any rhythm you can't dance I said that's exactly right I never said I did actually but when I dance for Jesus all I can say is I guess I do it all right but I sure found awful good and I've had a lot of victory since I've been dancing the church said amen because I don't care what anybody else thinks I care what Jesus thinks amen that'd be all right then I guess I got a little special treat for us today here I brought my I brought my thimble I brought my washboard today I told my family we're going to worship like it's 1933. brother Brown is a pastor he's teaching for four and a half hours I said I've got one desire that I might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life Hallelujah so he taught for four and a half hours he took a break and he let these people come up and this group of sisters is that right and they started playing and beating on the tambourine and beating on the on the washboard there's my rhythm there and Broadband said imagine my Tabernacle this is horrible in my Tabernacle then he goes in he says this is terrible this has happened in my he said turning my Tabernacle into a bar room he said and he said I was in the seat of the scornful so brother Mann was looking down on some sisters that would dance and say there's going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet bye I'm going to meet you great to over there in that home never heard my modeling they'll be glorious Hallelujah [Applause] brother answer that's terrible until he started thinking about until you start thinking about is that in the Bible and he said yeah that's right Miriam was the first one that danced in the Bible and then he started patting his foot and he said before I knew it I was out there dancing with the blonde girl singing and praising God I sure felt awful good church it's so good to feel awful good amen hallelujah the joy of the Lord amen I didn't hear you now someone to use this after service he sure can praise God I'm just going to say like this this is my instrument praise God I'll share it see Church you sure feel awful good when you're worshiping God because that's what you're created to do amen thank God I did maybe I did all right I don't know but I sure feel awful good praise God when I praise the Lord amen I just thought I'd give you a visual what it must have been like and brother Rams the whole time he's like and all of a sudden no I can get into this and pretty soon he's out there dancing with the sisters praising God hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God oh I love how the Holy Ghost can transform our minds amen Glory I guess I danced all right I don't know I'd say the same thing Church there's a time to mourn and then a time to dance God is going to make our lives beautiful in his time hallelujah how many believe that by God's grace Hallelujah and that great question Miriam had the victory did you ever get that much victory now Church to get a victory you got to fight battles and you got to fight with the right weapons which is God's word God could have gave us if he would have gave us any other weapon that was better he would have gave it to us but the weapon is remembering God's promise believing God's promise and asking God lord Quicken your word to me let me hope in your word in the midst of my afflictions praise God ah amen now we're battling praise God praising God in the midst of our afflictions amen now I want to spend the majority of our time here Lord willing on the joy of the Lord in the New Testament did you ever anybody ever do that study just just study joy in the New Testament I don't know if I ever have by God's grace that's why I felt that the Lord to do that today by the grace of the Lord Matthew 13 20. here's the Stony seed right the Stony sea which is likened unto Judas someone that falls away he hears the word and with Anon with joy receives it so if someone who falls away could have joy how much more should us that continue in the gospel how much more joy should we have amen remember people can fall away people stumble you know they don't realize that people can fall away if they're not baptized with the Holy Ghost now of course people can be saved if they're just Justified or Sanctified they can be saved but the fact is you can fall away without the seal the baptism of the Holy Ghost right but Church we're not like Jesus or Judas rather we're not like Judas is scared we've sold out everything for Jesus and Judas sells out Jesus we're not trying to sell out the word we're trying to sell out everything to gain the word amen that's right Jesus said I'll blot out those who do not overcome so so that's what we need we need Victors today we need Warriors people that want to overcome people that want to get Victory people that want to dance for Jesus amen hallelujah what scenes of victory in our lives amen I'll tell you since I made that confession there and it confessed my sin there to brother Brooks and brother cam well I've had victory since then on that was that Thursday night service I've had a lot of Victory I've seen a lot of victory in my life since then I'm still riding the victory actually I'll say like that I'm still riding the victory praise God in church it does something to go up and confess sins right to others praise God it does something spend some time there worshiping and confessing your sins it does something praise God Hallelujah and notice the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to treasure hidden the field this is of course eternal life that which when a man hath found he hideth and for Joy she hides the word in his heart hides that treasure in his heart and joy therefore goes and sells all that he has that he might buy this field for Joy the joy of the Gospel the joy of the good news the joy of Promise of eternal life amen sells out everything in order to gain The Treasure of God's spirit praise God eternal life that's what I was saying the people haven't danced maybe they don't even understand salvation yet you've been saved you've been delivered you're not in the bondage of Hell anymore you're not a slave to the you're not a slave in the prisons of hell you're not a slave to the powers of Darkness you're a free man or woman praise God you're a free young person praise God you're free in Jesus Christ you're delivered praise God you're no longer under Satan's power now you're under the power of the Holy Spirit praise God amen oh thank God Amen I know what I'm talking about amen each one of you that's got that justification you know what you're talking about Hallelujah Glory so you know I thought it might also be helpful for you to see the definition of joy in the Greek well 51 time it's defined it's called joy and then it's three times it's called Glenn it just means gladness right now what's a more modern definition for us I'd look this up on the computer a feeling of great pleasure and happiness that's why brother man said we ought to be the most happy people in the world hallelujah what are some other words that we might use instead of Joy well brother Jesse the holy spirit makes me joyful well you might say the holy spirit gives me great pleasure it gives me jubilation like a Year of Jubilee or something praise God Amen I've been set free praise God I've Triumph and Jesus always causes us to Triumph Hallelujah in Christ exaltation rejoicing happiness gladness Glee I've got Glee I'm waiting for a testimony like that brother Jesse God anointed me I feel the Glee of the Lord exhilaration amen exuberance Elation Euphoria Bliss ecstasy transports of delight never heard that before Rapture Radiance enjoyment gratification Cloud Nine I'm on cloud nine in the message that's what this message did to me I remember Simon's always told that story Betsy Dustin when you first come in the message you would just sit in their car in the Walmart parking lot and listen to brother Brooks sing praise God now I used to sit in the cars and parking lot and smoke cigarettes when I was a sinner right but when I got saved then I would just sit there and praise God and listen to sermons see what does it bring it brings a real Joy it puts you on cloud nine amen it takes you out of misery it takes away all your despair it gives you hope it gives you eternal life amen ah [Applause] I'm ravish with his love oh Hallelujah my goodness I enjoy the presence of God how many Joy the presence of God Glory parable of the talents well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I'll make the rule over many things enter thou into the joy this is how Heaven is described you mean you can have a taste of Heaven now exactly praise God you're a partaker of the divine nature amen that's what Peter said we are partakers of Heaven now praise God we know it's in part we know it's in measure but nevertheless when we transform over to new body and get a body change the best way God describes it is now you're living in the joys of the Lord amen thank God Amen brother brother says Sublime Time Sublime is that what he said there's no other way to describe it Joy happiness now look at the combination of feelings these women see Jesus raised on on the greatest day in the history of the world and the angel said go quickly tell his disciples he's risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you nigali there you shall see him lo I told you they departed quickly from the septica with fear and great joy teacher sometimes we got a combination of all these feelings now fear would have been like that death death afraid because the angel right the women saw him it would have been like deathly afraid but then they're leaving like deathly afraid like Hallelujah he's alive Hallelujah he's alive and then they're running down the station they're running to tell the brothers let's go he's alive amen so sometimes church we have multiple experiences multiple feelings at the same exact time praise God and so what I mean by that as I don't know what Satan to beat you up if you're feeling joyful yet troubled don't let Satan beat you up we're going to get to that Paul did that every day every day Paul was joyful but then sad other parts of the day it's just part of being a Christian don't get don't don't get defeated because you can't keep maybe the joy all day well there's some days you'll have more joy than others but you know the best part is you know you got access to Joy any day you need it that's the best part you're never going to lose it praise God like you might lose it up here but you're going to get it back because it's already in your soul praise God I never lost it really it's still a part of me praise God ah in memory Church even when people hate you and won't fellowship with you and say bad things about you call you evil call you a devil that's still an opportunity to rejoice we don't got an excuse to crawl into the corner and say oh they don't love me anymore nobody cares about me and they said bad things about me Jesus said do exactly the opposite and again he said leave for Joy amen leave for Joy when they hate you and won't fellowship with you Jesus said that's the time to praise God Amen God hallelujah amen amen oh it's so contrary to what the world tells us so contrary to what our own feelings tell us we got to get rid of our own feelings and get to my new Christ amen go back to that mind of Christ right go back to the spirit of Christ in our souls and Jesus says at that time you have a great reward because every the Bible said any all who live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer some persecution some level of persecution this should produce Joy when people say bad things about us we ought to say praise God Hallelujah God is with me and then the Bible said pray for them who despitefully use you right pray for them that's the opportunity to intercede for the unlovable right that's that I was going to say like this that's your opportunity to be like Moses who stood in the gap for Israel now what would you have said if God would have said you know what brother amen I'm going to destroy all the message I'm gonna start a new message and I'm just going to start with you now how many of us would have said okay that sounds good I think I'm a pretty good person I think I could handle that I could be just like Abraham father the faith but Moses said no block me out he said take me think about that same thing Paul said I wish I was a curse for my Brethren's sake that so let's remember that's the real kind of Jesus is Love right there when people mistreat you and do bad things you God allowed it and so God wants you to God wants you to act like Moses amen God wants you to act like Stephen father lay this not to their charge God wants you to act like him Jesus amen father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's your chance to glorify Christ amen your chance to be like Christ I think at the leap too just make sure if you're older you stretch out before you leave I had to learn that the hard way and 70 returned again with Joy saying the law even the devils are subject unto us through thy name we know this story right now look at that nothing by well any means hurt you now this doesn't apply to everybody this applied to those uh this applies to those apostles right we've had a preacher come in here years ago and he said uh he quoted Luke 10 where Jesus told the disciples uh you'll raise the Dead all these things and say look you can do that well if you're called you can do that that was actually spoken to the apostles and then First Corinthians 12 said to are all workers of Miracles did anybody catch that I'm sure you did I probably preached on a few times so that that's just like not rightly dividing the word of God and it puts pressure on you like if you don't have Miracles something's wrong with you well listen I got the miracle of Salvation that's the most important miracle I need praise God I do believe in miracles but God has to do it praise God if you're so full of Miracles why don't you do all the Miracles we need in our church you know if you're the if you're the person of Miracles you're the master of Miracles we'll do all the Miracles then well see they don't want to do that well it's your faith no it's your faith but my face not the problem your false teaching is the problem now I'm not I'm not saying anything bad about any preachers I'm just saying we've got to rightly divide the word of God hallelujah and then Jesus says don't rejoice when you cast out a devil he said Rejoice because your name's recorded on the last book of life in heaven amen Hallelujah Rejoice that heaven knows your name praise God oh thank God Amen Just Like Heaven new cornelius's prayers having new Cornelius is fasting Heaven new cornelius's almsgiving church when you do the same thing Heaven remembers you Hallelujah amen Rejoice because your names are written in heaven the parable the woman finding the piece of silver she sweeps the house she seeks diligently till she finds it then she calls all her friends rejoiced with me I found it and this is liking enough a person being saved likewise I say unto you there's joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents so when someone gets saved there ought to be Joy with that person if you're really saved you ought to have some Joy yeah don't worry praise God and then not only that but Heaven starts having a jubilee I wonder if angels dance I don't know I just wanna we know God dances God said so amen Jesus dance before the foundation of the world Hallelujah thank God we ought to Rejoice on on Earth and we know Heaven rejoices as well when someone really gets saved Hallelujah remember Jesus went to Zacchaeus and Jesus said I'm going to come and I'm going to buy it at your house today and the Bible said he received him joyfully so we ought to have joy knowing Jesus is coming home with us today Hallelujah Church please don't leave Jesus here don't leave all your Praises here they'll probably be gone when you get back if you do that some somehow some way there they'll find their way out you know or they'll annoy somebody else don't leave it here praise God we've got to take Jesus home with us amen we got to take the Praises home like I love driving home from church sometimes I'll be raising my hands or even driving to church this morning raising my hands shot in a point sometimes people drive by like what is it I'm like hey there's joy in the house of the Lord amen now you just don't know what I know praise God you know you just haven't been saved like I've been saved sometimes I'm pounding on the steering wheel you know see we receive him joyfully he's coming home with me Hallelujah now this is the scripture voice of God needs and I just started a series on them YouTube videos to try to help the people and help them too I try to do it with kindness part two will come out today about two o'clock I scheduled it this is the scripture they need John the Baptist Was Elijah and he said he that the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom Elijah John the Baptist which standeth and hearth and rejoice greatly because of The bridegroom's Voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but I must decrease now we see voice of God going the opposite way they want brother Branham to increase right but a real man of God said I must decrease and Jesus must increase so see church we listen to sermons thank God for William sermons I was listening to what when I was listening yesterday oh Souls that are in prison now I started it good start I'll keep going on that one we listen to it it's wonderful but we can't Rejoice necessarily in a man we thank God for his ministry we got to hear the voice of Jesus Christ amen because that's where the real man of God does a real preacher of God a real Prophet a real Elijah will rejoice in the voice of Christ because he's the bridegroom amen thank God Hallelujah he rejoices more in Jesus voice than his own voice and that's what brother man said all the time he said forget in the seventh year he said forget anything about me he said put all this grace on Jesus Christ I'm a sinner Say by Grace that's what we should say too put any Grace in my life put it on Jesus Hallelujah as a father has loved me so I've loved you continue my love if if you keep my Commandments he shall abide in my love even as I kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken to you that your that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you so we see a little formula here loving Jesus and obeying produces Joy so again it goes back to that thought when we sin it takes away the joy when we sin it takes away the dance so we've got to stop sinning we got to start obeying and get the joy back praise God God don't want you halfway on Joy he wants your cup overflowing amen hallelujah praise God they're not saying to you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy speaking of the Resurrection go to verse 22 and ye that now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you your boss cannot take your joy let me say like this Satan cannot take your joy ah I guess song says the world didn't give it to me so the world can't take it away that's what Jesus said that's that's the inspiration for that song nobody can take away my joy I'm keeping my joy because Jesus gave it to me praise God oh it's glorious full Joy he promised you and no man could take it from us if the pastor discouraged you doesn't take your joy away if your husband discards you doesn't take your joy away if your wife discourages you doesn't take your joy away praise God the church said the children do something act up on you doesn't take your joy away now you make you pray more right you'll have you know you'll feel burdened in the moment right like we all do yeah but like I said there's always these combinations of feelings and no man can take away the joy Hallelujah in other words Jesus says I'm hedging this and I'm protecting this just like he said hurt not the oil and the wine Hallelujah ah nobody can touch this oil why this is the joy Hallelujah that's good I'm gonna preach my voice out again the brother just emailed me from Washington he's like hey you got your voice back from the point I'm like yeah I come in here I'm like no I'm going to lose it again here John 16 23 and that day you shall ask me nothing barely available to you whatever you asking my father my name he'll give it to you but remember you might have to say remember Lord remember on the verse you caused me to Hope in that we can all we can all make it through one service I believe God I believe God I believe God let's come back to the next service with the same attitude church I'm the one that needs help too we all need help this is my comfort the word of God comforts me in my affliction I have hope that God will keep his promise he said ye shall receive that your joy might be full so we're supposed to have joy before we ask the promise we're supposed to have joy while we're waiting on the promise and then we have a lot of Joy when it happens amen Lord thank God Amen see you'll receive it that your joy might be full praise God Hallelujah what a beautiful promise so yes God wants you to have joy at the end once you receive the inheritance once you receive the promise God wants you to show your joy praise God oh hallelujah amen is that Zion all right John 17. Jesus last prayer with us with his disciples before he was crucified and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father now it's not the pope either he wasn't praying to the Pope keep through thy know name Those whom now has given me that they may be one as we are while I was with him in the world I kept them in thy name it's the authority I kept the name is Authority reputation that those that thou gave us me I've kept and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now I come to thee that and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves amen so really when you're joyful it's the joy of Jesus Amen I've got the Peace of Jesus I got the love of Jesus I got the power of Jesus and I got the joy of Jesus Amen it's his Joy and God wants to fulfill it in our lives now let me just say like this as long as we keep surrendering and repenting to God and loving Jesus he will fulfill everything for our lives every promise every every every uh the Bible said workmanship every work he's given you to do God will fulfill in your life it's only when we continually disobey that we'll miss out on what God's called us to like Saul King Saul like Samuel said you know you could have had this you would have had this Kingdom forever but you disobeyed God I think it was what two or three times in a row now I'm not making a Doctrine on that you know we we all fall short of God's glory but he was the king he should have obeyed he had a prophet he had thus saith the Lord he should have obeyed so the point is God will finish in his life I'm sorry in your life what he started and then when you see the Fulfillment you'll dance for joy I'm glad to see that a few weeks ago he saw them dancing for joy I saw Ally dancing for joy there praise God hallelujah Garrison Haven and in case you're dancing for joy Hallelujah he saw us I am a dancing for joy amen the Fulfillment of God's promise Hallelujah that's right Glory Acts 8. again church now here this also produces Joy when devils are cast out unclean spirits are cast out and people are healed and Supernatural Miracles take place that produces great joy right for those got to be those got to be ordained by God and some of them we got to pray and fast for like we were texting on the other day right gotta praying fast this causes great joy right but remember again people are going to get sick again after they get healed right they're going to praise pray through that battle pray through that battle but God does give us these Seasons we're Supernatural is to produce great joy of the Lord next time God knows a miracle somebody remind that person you need to have a dance session here now and praise the Lord you need to this is your season of Victory Hallelujah because guess what another season of trial is going to come around probably pretty soon you better dance while you got the chance a good rhyme right there you better dance well you got the chance Saints that's a good one Hallelujah acts 20. Now Behold Paul said I go bound the spirit under Jerusalem not knowing the things that will follow me there say that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city the bonds and afflictions boy he sure did get in jail not a lot now look none of these things move me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy look at that Paul was joyful by not counting his Earthly life dear to himself now look Church most people get sad when they think about the end of their life Paul didn't think that way Paul said I don't count my number of days I don't count my number of years as this is so precious like the world like they'll do anything just let me live a little longer let me live a little longer Paul wasn't that way because Paul said I got a real life that starts when I pass over oh man amen that's what my real life actually starts amen Hallelujah he said what's more needful that I stay here with you so I can be a blessing to you praise God I just want you to see this if God should take somebody early like you know Hua and and bang and zur's Dad if God takes how old was he how old was your dad 64 that's pretty young right it's pretty young we all wish we could be like what 80 maybe I don't know I don't know how old you want to be you're gonna have pains either way you know but the fact is you know Paul did not count his life dear unto himself see because he wanted to finish he just wanted to finish his life with the joy of the Lord remember everyone makes that statement he said don't he said don't let the devil Crown your life as a cranky old person remember don't don't let Satan Crown your life with a crown of defeat and discouragement where you're just sour all the time is sour okay so it's a sour space I can make if I could do worse than that but instead let the crown I believe the Bible says the crown is God's loving kindness and I'm not mistaken Crowley with loving kindness let me look it up who's got a concordance here real quick look at that I believe the Bible said Cry Me Lord with loving kindness loving that is right hallelujah amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah uh Psalm 103 verse 4. oh yeah it's right at this who forgiveth all thy iniquities who healed all thy diseases who redeems our life from destruction who crowded thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies amen Glory praise God don't let me be crying with sourness and and sinful complaining gotta balance that out don't let me be crying with that but let me be a crowned with Jesus put his Mercy on my head praise God Jesus put his loving kindness upon my head and that's what I'm crying with Jesus has had loving mercy on me I walk around and people see he's crying with God's mercy God in other words God's remorseful to Pastor Jesse right God has been merciful to each and every one of us be crying with that let God cry on your life with that Paul said I'm not going to be crying with well I didn't get to live long enough I didn't get to live up to my uh three score and ten he died at I think 65 or 64 if I'm not mistaken 63. somewhere in there just like just like your dad he said I'm not counting this dear to myself I want to finish my course as a joyful Christian God commended his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than I haven't been preached an hour yet being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we now have received the atonement The Exchange so one reason of your joy is the exchange God did between you and Christ amen like that song says I'm Trading My Sorrows I'm trading my shame it's an exchange I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord amen now we got a good song after service amen of course it's got a tough bridge on it God he loved me before I loved him he loved me while I was a sinner but then he gave me Redemption he gave me reconciliation he gave me favor back and he took my sin I want to make somebody joyful in here me Hallelujah You All God's Children praise God oh thank the Lord let not that your good be spoken evil of or be evil spoken of for the kingdom of God so God's rule is not in meat and drink God's Dominion or territory in your life isn't food it's righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost the Dominion God wants you to exercise is joy I rule with joy as brothers over sin flesh the world and the devil he says in the search book he wants joy to be the Dominion that you keep Hallelujah think about that that means every day Church you have to battle to keep your joy right like we said earlier so he's down in here got to get up bring it up come on come up my soul come on come on glory amen that's the Dominion that's what we're supposed to rule over praise God righteousness peace and joy of the Holy Ghost that's what he wants me to rule in not that I have uh you know the meats and drinks and all this I have all the Perfection of all these things now you want to live healthy don't get me wrong you're going to suffer if you don't right you want to eat healthy and drink healthy like we've been talking on don't get addicted to Dr Pepper like I did don't do that we have to have the kingdom the Dominion of the Holy Ghost righteousness Joy peace Hallelujah and that's how you really serve Christ Church keep your Dominion keep your joy keep the righteousness of God keep the peace of God in your life oh brother Jesse the kingdom of God is all the third poem Supernatural all those things well that's a part of it but the Bible didn't say exactly that the Bible said the kingdom of God is righteousness joy and peace in the Holy Ghost that all comes with it praise God right that all comes with it In God's Time and season like brothers let him speak that third Paul to Hattie right well how come not Edith writes huh how come how come God how come God spoke the third poll to a woman who could already walk and not Edith who was in a wheelchair whole life because God's Got A Plan right and we can trust God with our lives and God is not the author of confusion now see that would make us be confused but we just we got to cast that down God's not the author of confusion God has a testimony God's doing something God's God's the author praise God he's writing good books amen he's writing All About Us in his book praise God the Bible said all the members were in your book were written before you even formed in your mother's womb amen praise God that's the kingdom of God righteousness joy peace in the Holy Ghost now the god of Hope fill you with some Joy no no no see I'm really encouraging I'm challenging you and I'm challenging myself today let's have all joy I'm just going to be glad I'm just going to choose to be fully glad not in myself not in my bank account not in my circumstances not in the car I drive but in the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen praise God not my status on on Instagram or I'm not on that but I used to be on Facebook not my not my number of likes on Facebook not my number of views on the YouTube videos nothing of that but I've got full joy in believing in Christ through the Holy Ghost amen may God fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost and I also myself Paul says persuade of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness deal with all knowledge able also to admonish one another okay let me say this church you're I always give you the permission if you've got a good scripture on your heart you come share it with me you got a good testimony come share it with like also had a good testimony last night he's like I'll tell you tomorrow I'm like brother please I sent him all these Emoji emojis and laugh and I'm like please tell me now I want to know now I don't want to wait and he was gracious and sent to me thank you brother like that edifies me like thank God we were praying for this and God was faithful praise God that's not a law you don't have to make that a law but I was just begging my brother one time tell me you know tell me why we see each other tomorrow I want to Rejoice tonight amen admonish build up one another come over I call God for a record upon my soul that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth not for that we have dominion over your faith but we are helpers of your joy for by faith you stand now look Paul says Paul says I don't determine your level of Faith the preacher doesn't determine your level of Faith oh boy that's good I like that that's pretty good the preacher can't take away your faith if you don't let him like let's say the preacher's off the word or something but what preachers are supposed to do and like and all the all the Christians we're supposed to help you be more joyful so no church that's not always an easy thing we suffer we go through trials so we really need God's grace to bring joy to one another and maybe it's like we said just a smile and a handshake or I'm praying for you or can I pray for you right now there's an hour but this is what this is what I want to be I want to be a helper of your joy how can I help you be more joyful well I can preach on Dancing that's one thing I can do did I help anybody join with that one okay I got a few amens amen sorry I thought I'd helped somebody I knew God wanted me to preach that I knew that that was a revelation to me I knew I knew we were supposed to have those services that was Revelation to me too I failed it by God's grace and so see the preacher can't you can't take away your faith the preacher wants to help your faith I want to help your joy today and you know the best way I can help your joy is by saying Look what Jesus said oops Look what Jesus said Look what Jesus said look what the Bible says look at the Bible says remember the word the word's going to Quicken you that's going to bring you Joy praise God great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glory of you I'm filled with Comfort I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation The church here is a real Paradox of joy the whole subject is Joy especially when you look at Paul's writing the whole Paradox is you're supposed to be Joy when joyful when everything looks awful and if we're all honest with ourselves and if we're all honest with the Holy Ghost we all got to admit we struggle with that sometimes when things aren't going my way when I'm in the seasons of loss when I'm a season of Bad Health when I'm a season of persecution it's hard to be joyful but Paul was constantly helping their Joy amen he was constantly asking God to help him help others be joyful in the midst of their tribulations because don't you know Church even when we suffer even when we go through hard times Jesus is still on the throne praise God he's still seated with all Heaven and Earth under his Dominion praise God and he can speak one word and all your struggles will be taken away praise God or he could wait 10 years foreign I got one right that's our dog around it's hard thing to amen or he can make you wait 25 years like Abraham but either way he's still on the throne so you learn to be joyful in Tribulation okay this is Paul you know talking about how you rebuked that brother in the First Corinthians now therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyful we joined for the joy of Titus because his Spirit was refreshed by you all so Paul is joyful that Titus was joyful through the fellowship so Church let's let's try to let's try to think of this when we see somebody else joyful no matter what we're going through we should try to join be joyful for them I'm glad brother Austin's got the victory or I'm glad sicilina's got the victory I'm glad bro Jesse finally got the victory that's what Paul says I'm joyful for Titus because Titus is joyful amen praise God bye and again these are all within their tribulations now I better I'm gonna have to I'm going to move on I don't think I can get to all these I kind of want to finish with this other thought here let me see where am I at okay go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen eight I got 18 more scriptures I'm not sure I'm gonna get to that um I might finish that on Wednesday we'll see here ah I'm gonna skip that here uh let me try to bring this down to close here let me so let me do 15 minutes here I try to do an hour and a half so I mentioned this earlier as Christians you know we're familiar as what Paul said we just read all those scriptures like I said there's 18 more scriptures where Paul says joyful in the midst of Trials joyful in the midst of your your tribulations joy joy joy don't let Satan take your joy let no man let no woman take your joy praise God don't anybody take your joy your gladness and what Christ has done for you and then the reality is we've got to balance all these feelings we have to balance all these experiences right let me prove it to you it seems Paul rotated between all these emotions in and out all throughout the day somebody ought to say Amen on that if if you've experienced it you can't amend something you don't know right but I can say Amen to that like I'll get a tax or email oh this is bad news oh God can you bro Jesse can you pray yes I'll pray and all of a sudden a few minutes later I get some good news ah Hallelujah sad morning Joy rejoicing and the cycle repeats over and over again right so let me go to this one first Paul said rejoice in the Lord just on Sundays and Wednesdays rejoice in the Lord alway and again I say let me repeat that in case somebody missed it he says if you missed it the first time you're gonna get the second time Rejoice always rejoice be careful don't don't be anxious about anything don't don't let stress overwhelm you but cast all your cares make your requests and run to God what's Rejoice mean again to be glad that's the same thing as Joy right Joy means glad you see they're kind of synonyms here and Paul wrote this Paul writes to be joyful always while he's in prison he's in bonds he's he's under bondage he has no Freedom a man that has no Freedom still says I'm free to be joyful praise God oh think about that the Paradox amen of the Christian Life I have no Freedom all my rights have been stripped from me but I still got my spiritual Bill of Rights amen I've still got my spiritual Declaration of Independence amen I've still got the rights that Jesus gave me I can still rejoice in the midst of my trials that's that's all we're all we all need to come up to that church I need it we all we all got to be able to come up and say I'm going to be joyful in the midst of my trials now he says Rejoice always but then he says beside those things that are without all the trials he had outside of him I preached on this recently maybe last year it was last year beside all these troubles without there's also the troubles that come upon me every day the care of all the churches so each day he gets you get Brothers coming in Hey Brother so-and-so Hallelujah God bless you brother how is the church in Rome doing how's the church the thessalonica doing and that every day you get visitors come back and say Well they're really they're really struggling here they're poor here they're going through persecution here some of them are died and martyred every day he's got the care of all these churches on every day we got the same man writes Rejoice always it's kind of like well brother Paul which one do you want me to do you want me to Rejoice or do you want me to you you want him to pray yeah be burden which one should I do but the route of is we have to do all of it we have to follow because like this the leadership of the Holy Ghost for that hour he's leading you to intercede the next hour he might be leading you to dance Oh you mean message people still dance well yeah the real message Believers still do the real message right Hallelujah and then on top of that then he says I Die daily officers Rejoice always Die daily and also deal with all the burdens of all the churches on the same day Emma all day every day every day every day the Christian Life Is A Wonderful Life but it's a life of concept battle constant overcoming constant renewal I think it's so refreshing to look at if anybody knew what it's like to suffer outside of Jesus it was Saint Paul and yet he's the one that tells us Joyce always brother awesome for the amen Rejoice always and again I see but don't forget all the needs of the churches remember the last thing Paul said to Peter before they left Jerusalem he said don't forget to remember the poor okay now I gotta remember the poor churches that's a big to-do list anybody ever write out your real to-do list for each day one time I saw my brother policy he was I said send me a picture of your toothless it was like three pages long I'm like bro I'm glad I'm not you I'll text him that too that's a lot of that's a lot of work there to do man my goodness but each man is called each each person's you know office remember this scripture Jesus has shined in our hearts we have the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ we have treasure on Earth and vessels who's got treasure this morning you've got the power of God in you and yet you're troubled on every side this is Paul talking same guy that said Rejoice always I can Rejoice all the time and I've got trouble all around me that's what he's saying I got trouble at home I got trouble at church I got trouble on the job I got trouble at the school I got trouble all around me yet I'll Rejoice always and again I'll say rejoice word distressed we're troubled yet not I'm sorry we're troubled not distressed not we're perplexed but not in despair I'm not hopeless like I'm going to commit suicide right got some of us battle that some people do but the Bible says we could have victory over that because we can have joy of the Lord what's the Hope again the hope is God's promise he'll fulfill it in his time persecuted but not forsaken cast out but not destroyed I'm cast out and persecuted yet I can rejoice in the Lord the Bible says you can I'm always bearing in my body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifest in our body and he says for this cause we're always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh here's another thing in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience and afflictions in necessities and distresses and stripes imprisonments and torments and labors and watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by Love unfeigned by the word of God by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ah and Paul wasn't kidding when he said he had troubles all around him and then on top of that caring for the poor on top of that caring for all the churches now church hopefully your troubles maybe when you come into service maybe they were like this now maybe they're feeling like a lot better like this now right and you still got a reason to praise you still got a reason to show some gratitude because here's a guy who had a preacher prophet he had it all around yet he said I Die daily yeah I Rejoice always I can't wait to meet this guy I'm gonna say I got like 90 percent of my sermons from you Paul I love you you're a good man can I can I fellowship with you for about 10 000 years by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers are we're called deceivers yet we're true as unknown yet well known as dying and behold we live as chasten and not killed as sorrowful yet always here he says again always rejoicing I'm sorry for God doesn't move here I'm sorry I'm sorry for your suffering and God hasn't moved the situation yet but yet I'm rejoicing because God is going to move praise God like brother man I said he's going to answer our prayer some way one way or another right one way or another is going to be answered whether we live to see it or whether we don't live to see it God's going to answer our prayer somehow so I can be sorrowful yet always rejoicing I can be poor yet making many rich I can have nothing yet I can possess all things Church what does this leave us it leaves us access to every spiritual blessing that we have need of in this life and it also at least there's no room for any excuses in our Christian walk with God because we're offered every spiritual blessing in Christ Jesus Hallelujah remember his resume of sufferings Labor's more abundant Stripes above measure in prisons more frequent and deaths off oftentimes close to death five times I received 40 Stripes save one Thrice I was beaten with rods once I was stoned Thrice hour Shipwrecked a night and a day I had been in the Deep in Journeys often in Perils of waters and Perils of robbers when was the last time you erupt hopefully not recently in perils built by my own countrymen in perils by the Heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of the churches who is weak and I'm not weak in other words who's suffering and I haven't suffered it is there any excuse for any Christian here today to say I can't have the joy of the Lord is there any excuse there's no excuses now you might be in a season where you're you're not full Joy but Jesus wants you to get he wants he'll take you there he'll eventually get you to full Joy praise God who's offended and I'm Bernat if I must needs Glory I will glory the things which concern my infirmities so I'm closing with this church let's take advantage of the joyful seasons of life I could go back to that list I'm not going through I'm not going through any of those things right now haven't been robbed recently now I've given to people and whether they robbed me or not it doesn't matter I'm going to pray for them anyway I've never been Shipwrecked the worst we had was I had a flat tire a few weeks ago Malachi right that's the worst I've had in the rain but it wasn't heavy rain think of our trials that's why the Bible says our trials are light afflictions right and then in all things in all situations we are admonished rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice Rejoice because you have the atonement Rejoice because Jesus has done The Great Exchange and recently with those Napoleon Services if one or a few of my daughters or Naomi's daughters whoever was there in Betsy and Dustin's daughters whoever believe they got the Holy Ghost if just one of them received eternal life think about that church that's the one and only time they'll ever receive it because it's a seal unto the day of your Redemption that is the greatest occasion we could any of us could ever think of now I didn't put wedding up there that's a pretty good day when you get married I don't want anybody to feel bad you know but if you receive eternal life there could be no greater gift you could ever receive because everything else will run out you might get a brand new car for your birthday if your parents are rich eventually is going to rust out it's going to break down but if you receive eternal life there's no greater gift than ever could be given to anybody praise God that's why the Bible says I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth that my children choose our children choose the path of righteousness the straight and narrow way and the church said let's end our feet musicians can come praise God got to recognize take advantage of the joyful seasons of life church let me share this too before I preached that Saturday night service about dancing their brother cams I visited Mike McCloskey and I cried with him yet I was joyful with him and I said brother I said you have suffered he said all I want is healing and he said I just got to have patience I said you're exactly right I looked at him and I was crying I had tears in my eyes I said brother you have way more faith than I'll ever have because you have suffered through a 14 year season of absolute physical torment and I get upset when I get a cold sore in my mouth and I can't heal it after a few days I'll be like god what have I done foolishness immaturity I said brother you have way more faith than I'll ever have yeah I've spoken things God's allowed me to speak things he anointed to me and prayed for people and healed I said I'll never have faith like that unless God will call me to that and he looked at me and he said brother Jesse he said I can't wait until I get out of this wheelchair that's for Jesus I said I'll dance for you tonight brother and boy did I suffering in this season his season is this awful long season of suffering when is it going to end we don't know we don't know but he's choosing patience he's choosing to quote the promise of God he's choosing remember God's Pride remember God's promise Church all of us are in different seasons of life right all of us go through different trials but I want to encourage you today rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice this Bauer heads here father God we thank you for your love and your compassion Jesus Hallelujah [Music] it's astonishing Lord I don't even know the word to say tremendous it's astonishing to see Paul say rejoice always yet sorrowful yet burned by all the all the needs of the churches yet having to Die daily yet being beaten fasting often cold often work most of us don't battle what half of these things or we want to choose to have joy that's full today but I hope somebody can happen a victory today if somebody can feel the victory of God today thank you Lord since my mind is on him I want to pray for brother Mike man of Faith a man of patience Lord Jesus and all humility Lord God Lord of your presence my heart goes out to my brother my brother give him some comfort or Jesus there's a reason pray one day Lord you're welcome foreign [Music] let that be them foreign [Music] again as I keep quoting the scripture Lord remember your promises and pauses to hold your promises are my comfort Lord my prayers that each person May our cups forget not all your benefits Lord Jesus rejoice in your promise [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] peace the darkest places [Music] all right [Music] now [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
