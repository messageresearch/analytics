========================================

word of God does not get stale and the church said the word of God cannot get stale Hallelujah we have the present truth as Peter says we're established in the present truth hallelujah so let's go to uh Luke chapter 23 and we'd like to start at the 39th verse a familiar perhaps uh story to us but I like to look at this story by the grace of God this is the last uh full story that uh brother Brandon had mentioned during this sermon and uh hopefully I can maybe try to get through it here tonight we'll see how the Lord leads it's all in God's hands how many enjoyed the message on David last Wednesday night anybody enjoy that message amen that was a wonderful message there all thanks to the Holy Spirit praise God so Luke 2339 of course this is the crucifixion of our Lord and we see Jesus uh surrounded by two thieves Now by God's grace uh I'm going to read 3940 41 but I like us to read uh 42 and 43 together you know with our voices together so I'll read uh 3940 41 and then we can all read on 42 and 43 and one of the malactor which were hanged railed on him saying if if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying dust not thou fear God sing Thou Art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man hath do nothing I'm sorry hath done nothing amiss let's read 42 and 43 on three 1 two 3 and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise amen may God add his a blessing to the reading of this word you may be seated familiar story here um story that brings us a lot of hope by God's grace also also a lot of Revelation remember Sunday morning I preached on um uh this thought on the foolish virgins you know Jesus talked about two kinds of Christians there's wise virgins they're fully devoted to Christ they have the oil which represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but then there's uh foolish virgins that only have a temporary amount of oil and they run out of oil right and so we know that means that a wise version has the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul because the Bible said when you have that you have the seal unto the day of your Redemption Hallelujah and that's the revelation of this hour the Revelation is that we need the Holy Ghost more than just on our body we like to feel it on our body uh you might tremble you might shout you might get goosebumps you might scream you might run you might jump we all appreciate that but that's going to eventually leave and then we like it on our minds as well because we we need a renewed mind we need a a Zeal to want to read the Bible right but our mind sometimes gets tired so so that anointing leaves too right the freshness of prayer leaves to so we need that to be renewed and uh the Bible doesn't call that that a seal so the only place that's left in a person is the soul and the Bible says when you're sealed with that you're marked with that unto the day of your Redemption and it's the Redemption of a brand new body Hallelujah and so that's what we would say you know we'd say pentacostal people today you know their their move started around 1906 but they failed to move on to the move of the mysteries of God being finished which God used brother brandom to to continue by God's grace and to finish that's what the Pentecostal had rejected just like uh just like this the wesan had rejected the Pentecostal message and just like the Lutheran had rejected the Wesleyan message so God kept sending more Revelation and so that's the Revelation that many Pentecostals and even the church I was Raising I love them you know my Assembly of God friends but that uh that's what they failed to realize they failed to realize that God had moved on and he had finished the mysteries of God through a prophet of God hallelujah and that's according to numerous verses like Revelation 10:7 uh Matthew 1711 uh ma I'm sorry Malachi 45 and 6 turning the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers Hallelujah and uh that's one thing too you know uh I was when I was growing up they would uh they'd all call us these little children up to the Altar and pray for us and encourage us to speak in tongues and one time it sounded like I did and um so my mom was happy that I spoke in tongues but I don't know exactly if I did or not uh I was very emotional I was crying because there was a lot of emotion and loud music but as soon as I got done uh you know I just I stuck my sucker back in my mouth and ran outside and started playing baseball again you know so uh so I don't it wasn't like a real experience to me and um you know and and so I was kind of caught up in Emotion but but that anointing left right but see when you get it in your soul you have that anointing to the day of your Redemption praise God and and uh uh and like I said you know uh the Bible said do all speak in tongues in 1 Corinthians 12 and we know the answer to that is a no just like do all have gifts of healing no uh are all pastors and Prophets no right but God has given uh the gifts as it pleased him how many know the scripture so everybody has a gift and Every Man Has a gift to profit with all praise God so everybody has their special gift that God knows uh they can use for God's glory God gives each person a portion of talent praise God aren't you glad you have a talent tonight amen so the the the mystery of God's will is to find the talents you've been given and then exercise those be diligent with those and be a vessel that God can use a vessel of Honor that you can use those talents for God's glory now I just heard it today this is not my notes but remember First Kings 13 remember that you had an old prophet and a young Prophet remember that story what an amazing story but here's a story where the old prophet he lied to the young prophet in the name of the Lord he lied and said the Lord said come in and eat with me right but then after they eat he he gives them a true prophecy that he's going to die and he gets eaten by a lion so there's a man that old Prophet is an example to us that our gifts we got to take care of them and we shouldn't play around with them we shouldn't be unfaithful with them because look he lied with a gift but then he got something right with the gift in the same chapter look at that who's that remind you of balum sometimes balam would seek enchantments and other times he'd seek the lord god Jehovah right so that's a good example right we must be careful with our gifts and we just saw it with Moses a couple weeks ago right he knew he had the power of God God and God said speak to the Rock but he smoked the rock it didn't come out the first time but it came out the second time because he had a gift he had Authority right so we must be very careful Church even with our gifts we must be careful to use them for God's Glory Hallelujah that story just struck me today I was really blessed by that just a reminder of that we got to be very careful how we use our gifts Hallelujah and so we're thankful uh for these Revelations by the grace of God but we've looked at how God's grace in this in this series on the message of Grace God's grace extended to Adam and Eve right Noah Abraham Israel the nation of Israel Moses and two weeks ago we looked at I'm sorry last week we looked at David today we're going to look at the thief on the cross Hallelujah the saved thief on the cross and how God's grace reach down to him Hallelujah now brother Bram said Sovereign Grace comes from a sovereign one okay so Sovereign means possessing supreme or ultimate power so God's sovereign he possesses supreme power above all others right because he created even the angels right he created humans everything he has supreme power another definition of sovereign is acting independently without outside interference so God acts however he wants he doesn't have to take into anybody's consideration right so God is Sovereign and God gives out Sovereign Grace because he's all powerful he can show Grace to whomever he wants now what's interesting about back back to that young Prophet story is that God had him killed he was just a young Prophet after he disobeyed one word of God but yet David disobeyed numerous Gifts of or sorry numerous words from the Lord but yet God had Grace on him and let him live interesting and see what do we do all we going to say is we don't know God's plans but we know God's plans are right and we would Dar ever speak against God because the Bible said sometimes when God takes people home at a young age and young people die the Bible said in Ezekiel that don't you know that God is sparing that young person from more evils later on in life God has a purpose Hallelujah God has a plan Hallelujah God has a story amen hallelujah he's the author and finisher of our stories amen and God is The Sovereign God he can do whatever he wants Hallelujah and he's not to be questioned he's to be believed hallelujah amen now God help us when we go through trials amen hallelujah we must trust that he's Sovereign and he gives Sovereign Grace Grace to the in the English language means free and unmar favor now that is a Bible good Bible definition too because in Romans 5:16 and 18 the Bible calls salvation a free gift it's free that means you don't have to pay for it you just got to receive it praise God uh like today we gave z a a a gift uh about 8 o'clock this morning is a free gift he didn't earn that birthday gift and he enjoyed it all day he didn't he didn't he didn't turn it down and say oh I'm not worthy of this no he took it and sure he ripped it open piece by piece real real neat like rip this piece of wrapping paper off he he just accepted the gift and church that's what we've got to do we've got to accept the gift of God hallelujah don't let the devil tell you the gift's not for you the gift of salvation's for you Hallelujah the Bible said God would that all men be saved Hallelujah you must accept that he's given you salvation and you must accept it and when you accept it then you love God so much you repent of your sins and you turn 180 degrees around and you walk after righteousness instead of walking after pleasures and sins of this world remember we're not workers of iniquity we're workers of righteousness Hallelujah because of the love of God in our hearts Hallelujah and it's also unmar in Ephesians 2 8-10 says we're not saved by our our works lest any man should boast so now you see we get Sovereign Grace or we get an independent power giving us free and unmerited favor amen church we get to walk Our Lives we get to walk our lives here in 2024 and we have to remember we have God's unmar favor you didn't earn it you don't deserve it but if you've accepted it's yours Hallelujah and you've got to walk in the freedom of that Grace you've got to enjoy that Grace you got to be thankful for that Grace you have to remember that Grace hallelujah it's free and unmar you can't buy it you can't purchase it the Bible said in Romans N9 it's not him that runneth or him that willth but it's God who shows Mercy Hallelujah everybody see that by God's grace amen hallelujah now we know we have a responsibility to respond you just have to repent uh they said Peter in Acts chapter 2:36 what shall we do to receive the Salvation he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins that means the sending away of your sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost amen glory amen what a promise amen repent of your sins say God I'm sorry for lying for fornicating for adultery uh for drug use or witchcraft I'm sorry for that forgive me change my heart Hallelujah and I want your spirit to dwell in me I don't want demons to dwell in me praise God Amen Hallelujah now most some most of us as Sinners we know what it's like to have demons dwelling in us now you don't have to say Amen but I'll say amen I was deep in sin I was not I was not in control I couldn't handle my my my certain drug addiction I was it was it drove me right but when I come to Christ and repented slowly but surely God took away all those demons out of my life Hallelujah and now I'm free and now those Spirits can't drive me back to that because he whom the son has set free is free indeed amen Jesus broke the chains he set me free Hallelujah I know what it's like to be in chains but I also now know what it's like to be free hallelujah what did that the free gift of Grace amen it was God's unmar favor hallelujah amen and as I said before you know even dirty movies and dirty magazines God's fully delivered me from that by the power of the Gospel Hallelujah by the power of of the G of the Gospel of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen see think if you can be so uh given over to evil spirits if you can obey evil spirits that much think to the other side well surely you can obey God that way and surely God can give you more power amen hallelujah if the devil can do that and have power over you how much more can God's power lead and guide you and give you power and Grace and strength to overcome the Gates of Hell hallelujah amen God's greater than Satan Hallelujah amen because of this free and unmar favor of God we can live above sin be by the mercy of God Hallelujah by the love of God hallelujah I love what brother Ram said brother Ram said he can save a Wretch like Me and he did let's say and he did ready and he did he could save a WR like you and he already did it what am I saying I'm already saved it's in the past I'm saved I'm going to heaven I'm on my way to heaven shouting Victory Hallelujah Hallelujah he saved me I'm saved Hallelujah I already am a child of God I you already are a daughter of God hallelujah you're already saved you're on your way to heaven shouting the victory Hallelujah you're going to go there by the grace of God because he made a way you couldn't make it on your own but he gave you a free ticket a free gift and you're on your way to heaven hallelujah it's not by your Works amen you're not saved by that but if you ever got saved you'd appreciate it so much you'd want to serve god with the rest of your life Hallelujah that's right brother Ram said what is it it's Grace William brandham was a drunker son but that didn't make any difference the grace of God saved me no matter how dirty your family looked or how low down they were or or or just the the negative uh uh atmosphere around your family no matter how low you were Jesus specializes at reaching down deep and pulling you up out of your your pit and your myy clay he brought me out of the myy clay he set my feet on the Rock to stay Hallelujah and then he puts a song in my soul today Hallelujah a song of Praise hallelujah thank God Amen that's right church amen if God can save a drunker son he can save you and I Hallelujah doesn't make any difference God's grace can save to the uttermost Hallelujah he saves to the uttermost he brother R said he can take the vest Sinner and make him white as snow he's quoting uh Isaiah chapter 1 though your sins be as Scarlet he said I'll make you white as snow hallelujah praise God look at sister Lena's shirt that's kind of like the imagery right it's a red sweatshirt well God can take that and make it bright white like like sister Z's white jacket there it can go from that to that in the spiritual realm now it just worked out really good that's really perfect amen red and white cuz that's Isaiah 1 Glory he says uh it can do it because it's Sovereign because God don't have to ask the devil for permission well can I have brother Jesse devil can I please have him God can just take me amen God can do whatever he wants amen the Bible said no man sought God God sought man Hallelujah God was seeking after you God's grace was chasing you down amen no matter how far you ran from God God could run faster Hallelujah God could run faster after you chase you down and win you with his love Hallelujah when you realize sin is only pleasurable for a season sin only is fun for a season and then it turns destructive and then it turns hateful but then when God shows you his love it's easy to turn away the evil and accept the good Hallelujah isn't it evil to turn around like a a let's say a plate was full of maggots and on one side in another plate you had just fresh uh steak right out of the oven or something like that I mean it's easy to turn down the maggots right because it's disgusting that's how it is when you become a Christian you don't want to go back to the porn you don't want to go back to the marijuana you don't want to go back to that it's dirty it's disgusting you want to eat the fresh meat of the word amen that's right is that right church amen hallelujah now getting into my text here Luke 23 that's just a little introduction by God's grace amen I'm not I'm going to try not to be too long tonight I've been wearing myself out I I'm back to work this week and I'm fairly worn out by God's grace which is okay that's part of the part of the uh balance act Hallelujah but in Luke uh 23 we saw it 39- 45 now what what's amazing we see in verse 40 the save Thief he offers a rebuke as he's dying think about that he's a dying man and he rebukes The Sinner for trying to rebuke Jesus think about that what a testimony you're dying really he's only got three hours left to live if they killed him right about the same time as Jesus right because they had to get him off the cross they had to get all three of them off the crosses uh before the sun down right because of the the Passover they had to be down so he's got less than three hours to live and he stands up for Jesus he says don't don't you fear God because you're in the same condemnation right and he says we deserve this we're getting the reward for our Deeds so both thieves did something worthy of death they probably killed people they probably murdered something uh you know because of I for an eye tooth for a tooth right we know a lot of laws are based on that the old Jewish laws but they did some evil things but this save th speaks up and he said but this man has done nothing a Miss how many know Jesus is perfect amen how you know Jesus makes no mistakes hallelujah how many know Jesus Is Right on Time Hallelujah all the time amen he makes no mistakes Hallelujah he's perfect and then he offers look at this humble prayer in verse 42 Jesus he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when you come into thy kingdom he's saying remember me when you're ruling in your kingdom and your dominion and your glory and your mansions and and and and all all your territory remember me Hallelujah he didn't want Jesus to forget him he wants Jesus to remember him how many he want Jesus to remember you tonight amen Lord remember me praise God remember that I love you and I stood up for you praise God and I stand up for you in my family I stand up for you in the church I stand up for you on the job I stand up for you on school help us to stand up for Jesus hallelujah amen he stood up for Jesus in the final hours of his life Hallelujah that's what we've got to do we got to spend our lives standing up for Jesus remember Jesus said If you deny me before men I'll deny you before the Holy Father remember that church we got to stand up for Jesus if we made mistakes say Jesus forgive me try me again this time let me walk in your spirit and I'll stand up for you because no man's perfect no man ever goes through a life and never make him aake no matter how holy you are how much you love Jesus we all fall short of God's glory amen but we need this courage we need the strength to stand up when other people won't stand up for Jesus we've got to stand up for Jesus we got to bring him into the situation we got to call him on the scene we're the ones who have to remember to pray for people praise God we can't expect them because we they don't know what we know we know we're Kings and Priests unto God hallelujah we know that's our calling we know that's our spiritual position Hallelujah so we've got to bring that into uh the the the conversations praise God and he says remember me Hallelujah we know uh we know the Bible also says that God will not forget any work that's done for his name the Bible says always be abounding in the work of the Lord for you know your work of the Lord is never done in vain Church you never prayed and it was in vain I'm talking about if you have the right heart you never fasted and it was in vain it wasn't in vain you never gave to the poor and it wasn't in vain God sees all of it and church God's going to reward you 100 hundredfold Hallelujah 60 fold 30 fold whatever degree you sacrifice for him he'll bring the blessings on 60 fold 30 fold 100 fold trust God trust God with your life hallelujah amen man and then Jesus offered these beautiful words verily I say un to you today shalt thou be with me in Paradise so Jesus knew once the bodies died their Spirits would descend down into the heart of the earth and down the heart of the earth you had the lost that were kind of in Satan's Chasm and then there's a there's a big uh Valley between the the lost and then Abraham's bosom so Jesus gives him this great promise don't even worry don't even worry if I'm going to remember you I'm going to remember you and you're going to be with me today hallelujah what Blessed Assurance makes me feel like singing brother Austin Blessed assurance Jesus Is Mine oh what a foretaste of Glory Divine Hallelujah I'm an heir of Salvation purchased of God I'm born of his Spirit I'm washed in his blood hallelujah what a promise today not tomorrow not next week not next year today you'll be with me in heaven Hallelujah it was a paradise in in the Old Testament it was a paradise and then it went to heaven up to heaven in the New Testament but the equivalent of saying you'll be with me in heaven today because you stood up for me Hallelujah While others were mocking Jesus mocking Christians the save Thief stood up for Jesus Hallelujah he said Remember Me Jesus Remember that I've tried to serve you in these last moments of my life now the amazing thing Church you may have heard me say it before is in Mark 1532 okay could you put that up there mark 15:32 the amazing thing that struck me years ago and I preached it to you uh it's okay if you don't remember I need reminders too uh Mark 15:32 actually let's read 30 31 likewise also the chief priests mocking and said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save so they're mocking Jesus he healed all these people he raised Lazarus from the dead he saved him but he can't save himself mocking him and of course brother Ram said you know as all the uh all the writers said if he would have saved himself he couldn't have saved others from their sins Hallelujah right that's why he didn't save himself he gave himself as a sacrifice H Allelujah verse 32 and let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled him do you remember this in the midst of this three hours of of hanging on the cross at the beginning the save Thief was against Jesus think about that church he's got it doesn't matter if you think the nails are in the Palm or the wrist it doesn't matter he's he's got Nails in him he's not comfortable up there he's probably not singing you know a song special up there he's probably not you know reading his Bible up on the cross but even in the the last three think about think at the grace of God in the last three hours of his life he goes from mocking Jesus to saying standing up for Jesus amen that's the power of Grace right there even in the last three hours of his life he didn't deserve Grace but God still gave him Grace amen think of that the last three hours he goes from mocking Jesus joining in reviling him come on save us Jesus save us if you're the king of Israel and then all of a sudden he sees his character and he must have said forgive me he said you've done nothing wrong remember me he goes from mocking to worshiping in a matter of three hours Hallelujah church God is rich in Mercy amen think about that mocking God's son to his face but then with a matter of a couple hours turned to worshiping him and loving him that's a extra portion of Grace right there amen hallelujah brother Austin he did not have years of service to say look how many times I've gone to church Jesus he didn't have years of service look at all my prayers look at my all my fasting look at all my church attendance he didn't have that but Jesus Promised you'll be with me Hallelujah it shows we're not saved by works we're saved by Amazing Grace hallelujah amen thank God for this Amazing Grace Grace hallelujah what a change of heart you can go from mocking to worshiping in a matter of a few moments Hallelujah it reminds me of David remember David went from uh the Bible said uh when he had fallen with bash Sheba then he had Uriah killed he went from despising God and with a f a matter of a few maybe a year or something then he goes to worshiping and he says God created me a clean heart he despises why does the Bible say I can't have multiple wives and why does the Bible say I can't commit adultery why does the Bible say I can't murder the Bible said he despised God's word but then within a matter of a year he's you know he's he's uh he's tried to hide all his sin a matter of a year Nathan tells him he's wrong and God gives him Grace he should have died twice he deserved to die twice for the adultery and the murder but Nathan the Holy Spirit struck him and said Thou shalt not die but the sword will not leave your house you're given Grace to keep living but you're going to suffer that's amazing grace hallelujah amen let's read that uh Psalm 51 we can get a lot of good Revelation out of here the introduction says to the chief musician a Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came unto him after he gone in to basba remember he was out and he should have been out working right I'm sorry he should have been out with the the wars but he he skipped that and he saw her bathing he brought her in laid with her she got pregnant and then he he invited yri to come in and and try to lay with her he wouldn't do it because of his Devotion to God what a man and you know what brother R said brother Rod brother BR said I can't wait to get up to heaven to meet your Rah he said I'm going to tell Uriah your testimony meant something to me amen there was something brother Ram loved about Uriah he was so faithful he wouldn't enjoy the the pleasures of marriage because of his love for his Brethren and his Devotion to the war amen the spiritual war look at there it is absence he abstained from the the pleasures of of of Life the pleasures of marriage in order to be devoted and keep his mind on the war brother R said that means something to me Hallelujah which Bible character are you going to walk up to and say you're testimony meant something to me hallelujah amen I hope we can all find somebody in the Bible where thank God when I was in a trouble I really needed this verse thank God there's a man like that thank God there's a woman like that I can't wait to meet them because I'm going to meet them as they were saved by grace I'm saved by grace hallelujah amen hallelujah walk up and say thank you brother euriah the fact that you were so devoted that really inspired me when I went through a trial not to give into the even just the the the the legal pleasures of life I wouldn't even give into that because I was so you were so devoted to the war so devoted to your posted Duty what a testimony hallelujah amen now look what he says have mercy on me oh God in verse one according to thy loving kindness so see he doesn't deserve it but it's just the fact that God is so kind that's what he's trusting in he's trusting in that God loves him and God is kind how many trusting in that amen so many people you know create God as this this angry person all the time well he the Bible said we can offend him but the Bible said we confess our sins his loving kindness will accept us back Hallelujah don't let the devil beat you up too long re uh repent of your sins move on move forward do like David get back in the house of God ask God to bring the joy back God will bring the joy back and then start telling people about the grace of God hallelujah don't don't don't don't let the devil tell you do so many pentant and days of pentant and all these things like that confess your sin overcome it cast out anything that exalts itself the word of God and say God restore my joy and I'll testify to others about the love of God that's what David did wash me verse two thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin so take that take those sins take those drugs far away from me take that ly take that bitterness take that pornography uh take take the ly take the stealing and and the manipulation take that far away from me make me really clean hallelujah hallelujah that's what David saying take the murder away from me take the adultery away from me so I can serve God hallelujah make me really clean Hallelujah see when was the last time church just be honest when was the last time we really prayed like that see this is what we need we need reminders of this Hallelujah thoroughly wash me all the way clean if you got a little saint on your favorite maybe red sweater white sweater right boy you'd make sure you scrub that out and if it was your brand new outfit or your birthday outfit or something like that boy You' make sure I know I would I make sure I really get out that honey can you put some you know special soap on there I don't know how she does it you know put some charcoal on there or whatever chalk chalk that is not charcoal chalk put some chalk on there and really get out there because I I really I want to be thoroughly clean oh we ought to say that Jesus Come into my heart and life make me thoroughly clean help me to forget about that create a new mind give me a transform M renew my spirit today Hallelujah help me to forget about my past help me to forget about my struggles help me to walk in Victory praise God that's why you died to give me Victory look at now here's what we got to do verse three for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me so you have to acknowledge that we sinned you can't say well I never did in the first place no no you got to say I did it in my mind and my flesh right against thee thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges see you'll be clear and God will judge things right if you just be honest and own up to your sins like brother Bram said right we know the Bible said uh God said Adam why'd you do this he said my my wife made me do it pushing it pushing the blame on somebody else Eve why'd you do it oh the serpent made me do it pushing it no you did it I did it like like we saw with David we can always judge somebody else better than we judge ourselves we can lay out the Judgment boy she's wrong here here here he's wrong here here but when it comes to us uh I wouldn't judge you that harshly oh God help us to be honest amen help us to want to be thoroughly purged totally cleaned out from our sins Hallelujah I like verse six behold thou desirest truth God wants truth in your inward part Malachi and I were reading a book uh this morning and it was a good section it was called authenticity versus adaptability I'm just going to preach a little bit on this it wasn't well I guess it was just a last minute note you and I have a choice every day as a Christian are we going to be an authentic Christian or are we going to just adapt and try to be an Adaptive Christian what's the difference an Adaptive Christian you just come to church and just play along and try to say everything right to act like everything's okay but you've got sin in your life you've got failures that you haven't confessed uh you're babing sin you've got secret sin that that's just being an Adaptive Christian just trying to adapt and make sure nobody sees anything about my life but if you confess that and ask God to thoroughly Purge you then you could be authentic and I'm today I'm walking in the grace of God and you're asking that question remember read that this morning how holy can I be Lord God that's a good question we need to ask how holy can I be today that's how we started our dayen it's a good start to the day how holy can I be today that's authentic then I'm not trying to hide well I don't want Mal I to know about this and I don't want my wife and I don't want my children to know about this that's being just adaptive you're just trying to adapt and and not not let everybody see I'm sorry to keep your sin in your life keep your secret sin but authentic Christian does like David Lord help me to be uh truthful in the secret part let me not put on a show but let me be authentic this is who I really am I love Jesus Christ I love the word of God I'm fighting against sin but I'm getting the victory over sin Hallelujah I'm striving to overcome sin hallelujah how many want to be authentic Christians tonight why you just got a one minute sermon on it praise God there's verse seven Purge me with hiss up and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness see the devil's never bringing joy and gladness he's always bringing your doom and gloom and guilt and shame memories of the past God said I'm sorry David said Lord I make me to hear your joy hallelujah look at verse 8 n hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities that's what God can do God can forgive every single one of your sins and mine just got to ask God thoroughly forgive me thoroughly take this I Repent of this thoroughly cleanse me from this take this out of my life I don't want these habits I don't want these thoughts I don't want these actions I want to be clean verse 10 created me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me Remember David's Spirit was he just the Bible said he despise the word why does the bible say that I want to sleep with her she's beautiful or whatever he was thinking why does it say that why I'm just I feel like I need this tonight you know it was just all this compromise the wrong Spirit but now he's got the right spirit and he says Lord restore a clean heart create in me a clean heart that I can have your joy Hallelujah and restore verse 12 restore the joy of thy salvation then will what will he do in verse 13 then I will teach the transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee see this is why some people never they never witness they don't witness as much as they should because they've got secret s sin in their lives right they they they don't feel confident to witness because they know they're loving sin and they need to ask God Purge me from my sin Purge me thoroughly so I can be a witness praise God all right praise God now I'm trying to move on here by God's grace I'm gonna move on from that but you can see David's change of heart right from despising God's word at 47 years old brother that's what the history says I'm like my what a what a thing 47 years uh for 10 years he had victories he was a king of all Israel 37 but this probably happened when he was 47 years old right the peak of his powers is when uh the enemy deceived him there and he was caught in the snare of the devil but God helped him to get out by God's grace Hallelujah now brother Ram said Jesus proved at the cross there was the viest thief he deserved to die God had never come across mind now brother's just dramatizing right we don't know that from the scripture he's just dramatizing the the thief never thought of nothing of it there on the cross when through those bloody lips in between the groans there came a sound Lord be merciful to me so he he hadn't thought about it remember he was mocking Jesus three hours before he died but then he gets he gets convicted he must have repented in his heart as we saw he's a secret sinner right I'm sorry secret believer right to the very end Hallelujah he says and there came another one back through the blood the tears the agony Grace took a hold and said today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise look look at that I love it if there's a deep call there's got to be a deep to respond amen the the same Thief he had a deep to call he had a deep call I've got a call to God and then there was a deep to respond in other words if you want to be saved God can save you Hallelujah if there if there's a desire in your heart to be free God can set you free hallelujah amen if you want the Holy Ghost there's a God out there to give you the Holy Ghost amen oh that's right church amen glory see grace did that how could that Thief help himself no more than Adam could help himself no more than Eve could help herself see Adam and Eve couldn't help themselves God had to come down and sacrifice the animals and clothe them with animal skins that's how God Saves you as well God said his son Jesus Christ and we're clothed with the character and the spirit of Jesus Christ Hallelujah see that God did it God gave us Amazing Grace he said no more than you can help yourself no more than I can help myself and I like this this is a funny statement he says no more than we could jerk ourselves up the milky white way in other words fly through space with our own bootstraps so I'm not sure what that exactly means but it's something like you could uh make Yourself by your own boots straps or something you could uh somehow have power to go out and fly past through the Milky Way or something like that you couldn't do that on your own some of us don't even believe they made it to the moon I have a hard time believing that if they can't figure out some of these things that we're struggling with now my goodness can't even get Wi-Fi certain areas and you made it to the moon come on whatever but it's you know all things are possible but it's just uh it's remember that God's grace did this we didn't do anything for it God did it for us hallelujah we can't save ourselves we can't help ourselves God had to help us God had to give us Grace and we've just got to receive it Hallelujah Glory he said we couldn't do it but the grace of God can do something about it and it does it The Sovereign Grace of God came to that dying Thief today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise think of it he says that's wonderful Hallelujah now there's six verses that bring Grace and love together uh brother R uh he mentions this he says before you can have Grace you have to have love uh put up Galatians 5:6 and this is speaking to uh I believe us and also God and I'll explain it with this verse Faith Works by love so love is the root of all works for God if you're saved you want to work for Jesus first because love love gives you faith and Faith then goes to work so it goes love first then you have faith in God and then you work for God am so if you got love you got faith you can work and you can give somebody Grace Hallelujah see people that have trouble forgiving others and giving Grace they need to check the their love uh their love bank account I'll say it like that their love tank to make sure they got enough love in their heart because if you've got love then you'll surely have faith then you can surely do the work of forgiving somebody that's right now let do take it to God how do uh brother Ram said love is first and then Grace how does God show Grace first because God is love amen I want to shout after that amen hallelujah praise God Amen God don't have to go get love God is love Hallelujah and because he's love he can extend Grace amen because you've got the love of God in your heart you can extend Grace to others Hallelujah they might not deserve it but that's okay you got the love of God the love of God allows you to express that Grace because I've received Grace I can surely share it amen hallelujah just as if you had a a billion dollars surely you could share a little bit of that with somebody and how many know the love of God is greater than a billion dollars a billion dollars will put you in a billion bunch of troubles right billion bunch of traps every friend you got is going to be calling for 50,000 right but if you got God's grace you got more than billion dollars Hallelujah because that that love of God is eternal it never had a beginning it'll never have an end Hallelujah glory to God Amen that's right brother said we find out Grace like the dying Thief no wonder it's inspired poets to write songs about it like there's a fountain filled with blood that dying Thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day so see he realized Jesus was a Fountain of Grace amen at first he was mocking Jesus well he was on the right hand right so he would have been over here Jesus would have been in the middle he was mocking Jesus but then he realized wow Grace is Flowing out of here he just said father forgive them oh glory to God Amen he said father forgive them they don't know what to do if he's willing and he thought if he's willing to forgive those that are rebuking him surely he'll forgive me Hallelujah H amen I didn't see that to right now Hallelujah it was a fountain he saw the fountain filled with blood he said the dying Thief Rejoice to see that fountain in his day and there may I though vile as he wash all my sins away oh my glory to God Amen Jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and no doubt the sa Thief said I didn't know what I was doing when I murdered those people I didn't know what I was doing when I was doing those drugs drugs I didn't realize what I was doing on the pornography I didn't realize what I was doing when I when I had bitterness and wouldn't forgive I didn't realize but now I realize forgive me let Grace flow to me and church if you want Grace to flow to you it's willing to flow tonight Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah another writer said oh love of God how rich and pure how fathomless and strong think about you fathomless you can't fathom God's love it shall forever more endure Saints and angel songs in other words Saints and Angels they don't have enough words they can't sing long enough about the love of God when they get tired and finally stop singing in heaven God's love is still going to keep going on oh Hallelujah glory to God I'm trying to find a place to close believe me I'm trying help me Lord hallelujah let me uh I'm looking at my final notes Here I believe I'll close with this because there's so much in here I'll probably preach it when I preach the First Corinthians um book Lord willing okay so I'm closing with this here here we go this is Brother R's last story before he gives the altar call this is at his home Church remember this is in Jefferson Ville in 1961 and he tells a story and it's just a very humble Simple Story you might not even think there's anything tremendous in it until you really start thinking about it and get spiritual minded and I'll I I'll challenge anybody after I read this let me know if you've ever heard a message preacher read this story before you know why they don't because it doesn't fit their narrative most people I'm talking about people that are like in the greatest of all time Camp you know exalting themselves listen to this story just for a moment just stay with me all right don't fall asleep on me okay listen everybody take a deep breath in ready don't miss this there you go you got it now that's good I like that that's what I do at school all the time I'm like everybody children let's take a deep breath let's reset our minds and so you can listen to me I got important things to teach you and this is way more important than that brother bam said God's grace is like this let me tell you a story in ending God's grace is like this one time there's a mighty king this mighty king had a son and it was his only son one one day a murderer killed his son he said and through that Kingdom went the delegates hunting for that murderer they finally found that murderer and when they found him they brought him back and imprisoned him and when they did a trial was set and a sentence was made it was a terrible thing he'd murdered the King's son and know what was coming to him they put him in the inner cells they locked the doors they put pads on it and guards around it cuz what they knew knew what a kind of a horrible punishment this boy was going to receive because he killed the King's son the Royal King's son royalty he killed royalty guards was placed all around the doors and put in the cells the man was stripped nothing but a loin cloth on there he was and setting in that condition they starved him they barely let him eat anything he s in that that condition and they brought him out to the trial he was found guilty and proven guilty guilty and the sentence was made and he was to be executed under the horrible capital punishment he was to be killed cut in half by inches until his mortal life was gone sentenced by the judge he was to die and he begged and cried and said though I'm guilty though I'm guilty I'm sorry I did it I wish I'd never done it I'm sorry that I didn't in a moment in a rage of temper I did it I didn't mean to do it that way so look he cries for mercy everybody see the parallel here see where I'm going with this one day the king went down to the place the prison to visit the boy to talk to him and tell him about how he killed his own son the only son he had he said I'm going down to talk to him and when he went down there he looked back in the cage a and looked like a caged in animal so this this guilty murder looked like an animal in there barely had just any clothes on starving to death he saw that skinny little body laying there in a corner crying his face all sunk in his jaw sank back his eyes way back matter was all in his eyes and his mouth was all wided over no water thirsty laying back on his face crying and the King said stand up here he come to him and he looked at him and he said why' you kill my son what did my son do to you what did he do to Merit such a death as you killed him when you stabbed him to death with a spear so the king calls him right in front why' you do this and he said nothing my Lord not one thing your son didn't do not one thing just my own impudence just my own ways I killed him because I was jealous of him I got in a temper fit and I killed him now now I'm to die under your Justice sir I realize that and I deserve to do it the only thing I'm crying for I'm just sorry that I killed that Royal man like that without a cause the king turned on his heels walked out of the prison after that he went to the desk of the prison Ward and our brother worked in the prison right and said destroy all the records he said put them in the sea of forgetfulness destroy all the records wash him up clean him up I'll send down a robe for him after a while great big limousine drove up to the door when it did a carpet was spread out to the prison pron cell the king stood at the end of the limousine and said come my son ride home with me to the Palace he put the king's robe around his shoulder and said from henceforth you are my son is that the Gospel of Jesus Christ or not Hallelujah brother ramam said because the king had pity the king showed Grace that was me that was you we killed the Son of God with our sins we were all aliens the Bible said far from God dirty filthy laying in the cells of this world Hallelujah but God washed Us by the blood of his son cleansed us put the RO put on us the robe of the Holy Spirit and now the great Chariot of God will come back someday and take us up to the door of heaven and we'll go home to live with him all the records of our sins are destroyed and we can't be judged no more they're burned up he said they're put in the sea of forgetfulness and they're remembered no more no wonder we can sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me I was once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see it was Grace that taught My Heart To Fear Grace my fears relieved how precious did that Grace appear the hour I first believed Hallelujah just a simple story of all the man said was I'm sorry I didn't mean to do it have mercy on me and the King said Okay I accept that humble apology it's not going to bring my son back but I accept it I have pity on you I'm going to show you Grace and I'm going to put the honor of my son on you that's what God did for us he he put the honor of Jesus on us he put the spirit of Jesus on us hallelujah amen why because he p do you want scripture for that I'll be happy to give you a scripture for that Psalm 103 Hallelujah verse 12 as far as the East is from the West so far he hath removed our transgressions from us amen all the record that were against you the king said destroy them rip them up burn them up and they'll go go throw those ashes in the sea so they're never found again there's no more charges against brother Jose Jesus dropped the charges against sister Naomi Hallelujah there's no more charges sister who God done away with them he separated them as far as the East is from the West because of verse 13 like as a father pies his children so the Lord pth them that fear Him Hallelujah God looks on us and he knows the evil things we've done but he still has pity and he says if you just repent if you just say sorry I will wipe away all your sins and I'll give you the honor that my son had when my son paid for your sins on the cross of Jesus Christ amen let's stand to our feet Hallelujah musicians can come verse 14 said God knoweth our frame for he knoweth our frame he rememberthe are dust he remembers the weakness of our flesh sometimes we just got to we just give into the Flesh and do what our body wants God remembers that he'll have pity on us and if we just say sorry God forgive me God will accept us he'll wipe away all of our sins he'll thoroughly cleanse us if we'll let him Hallelujah and then he'll put the honor of his son on us now who's heard a preacher preach that story before anybody I didn't think I would I'm going to be very honest because I've never heard a preacher I've been listening to mess sermons for 20 some years I've never heard a preach that why because it puts all the guilt on you and me everybody just likes to say you never did in the first place but remember as my wife reminded me brother Ram said it was as though you never did it in the first place it's like as though you never did it in the first place Hallelujah everybody understand it's your soul that never sinned right because the Bible said you're you're dead in sins but then the Holy Ghost is the seal in your your soul you get the spirit of God it it make it takes it from Death to life and that spirit of God that's a part of you that Spirit never sin in the first place but the the Flesh and the mind still sins every day Hallelujah but Jesus in heaven is so gracious if we confess our sins he said I'll thoroughly wipe them all away I'll separate them as far as the East and from the rest I will remember them no more he even puts them out of his memory that's how much he loves his children praise God amen that's how much he wants you to forget your sins and live a holy life how many feel more determined to live a holy life tonight amen let's do it by the grace of God we can do it also we got to say Jesus is wash me wash me thoroughly wash my mind wash my memory make my mind pure again forgive me of my sins and let me remember all that you did for me it was Isa Isaiah 53 play there's a fountain filled with blood would you thank you remember Isaiah 53 he was despised and rejected a men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not surely ha bore our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him strick and smitten of God and Afflicted but but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray all of us were that prisoner who killed God's son we have turned aside everyone to his own way and the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all so that prisoner that cold uh almost naked St starved that that prisoner that prisoner who's all alone that represented you and I and God comes to us and our lowest State and offers us Mercy he just wants to hear us say I'm sorry Lord I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that I don't want my life to to I don't want that to be the end of my life I want hope I want Jesus to remember me so I go to heaven hallelujah it's a good salvation message is it not what a blessing all of our all of us were guilty but God can pardon our sins tonight Hallelujah butam said let this be the hour you first believed right now make up your mind and say Lord God I'm guilty I realize it takes Grace to save me I can't sa myself I'm lost I'm done I just can't do a thing I'm totally helpless hopeless without god without Mercy without Christ in the world alienated won't you have mercy and take me out
