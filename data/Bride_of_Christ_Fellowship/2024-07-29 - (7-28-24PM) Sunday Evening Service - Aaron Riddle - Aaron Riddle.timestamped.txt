[0:30] um and I guess Brother Paul's snuck out
[0:33] for a moment but I wanted to commend
[0:34] brother Paul for yielding himself this
[0:36] morning to the Holy Spirit um we were
[0:39] all certainly very very blessed this
[0:41] morning amen praise God um so uh let's
[0:47] just uh stand for a word of prayer and
[0:49] reading of
[0:52] scripture Heavenly Father Lord we are so
[0:55] thankful to be in your house this
[0:57] evening we thank you for being with us
[0:58] in the worship and the pr praise and the
[1:00] Thanksgiving Lord God and Lord I just I
[1:03] know I have a few notes written down I

[1:06] to you that you would speak this evening
[1:08] that you would bless your people father
[1:10] Lord we we give you praise and
[1:12] thanksgiving and commit the service and
[1:14] the word into your hands Lord Jesus we
[1:16] ask these things in the Lord Jesus
[1:18] Christ's name amen amen amen so um I'm
[1:23] so thankful how the holy spirit moves
[1:26] and and works um I had uh I had um been
[1:30] praying about what to to bring as we
[1:33] knew about the trip you know a couple
[1:34] months ago um and we were looking
[1:36] forward to coming and and uh the Lord
[1:39] had just put on my heart to bring back a
[1:41] message that I had preached in December
[1:43] um uh gold tried in the fire um so you
[1:48] know that that stuck on my heart and I
[1:49] didn't open it up to study or anything
[1:51] like that um I had trips and things that
[1:53] I was doing and I was getting around to
[1:55] it you know probably within the last
[1:57] week or so um and then um brother Paul
[2:01] had told me what he was studying on and
[2:03] we were you know he was preaching on the
[2:05] revelation of Jesus Christ last week and
[2:07] I knew he was going to be getting into
[2:08] ephes and I'm wondering well how's my
[2:09] message going to tie in um and then when
[2:12] I opened up uh my message to to to study
[2:16] I had forgotten the scripture so the
[2:18] scripture that we'll be reading from is
[2:20] revelation 3 that's right so he preached
[2:23] on Revelation 2 this morning I'm
[2:25] preaching out of Revelation 3 so it
[2:28] looks like it's planned but it's been
[2:30] planned by the holy spirit amen so we're
[2:32] going to start on Revelation 3 and verse
[2:35] [Music]
[2:36] 14 so he started in Ephesus and I'm
[2:39] going to come tonight with Le oosa so we
[2:43] had Alpha this morning and tonight we're
[2:45] going to have omega am amen so
[2:49] Revelation 3 verse1 14 it says and unto
[2:53] the angel of the Church of the leans
[2:56] write these things saith the amen the
[2:59] faithful and true true witness the
[3:00] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[3:03] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[3:06] hot I would that thou were cold or hot
[3:09] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[3:12] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[3:14] out of my mouth because thou sayest I am
[3:17] rich and increase with goods and have
[3:19] need of nothing and knoweth not that
[3:22] thou are wretched miserable and poor and
[3:24] blind and
[3:25] naked verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of
[3:29] me gold old tried in the fire that thou
[3:32] mayest be rich and in white rment that
[3:35] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[3:37] shame of thy naked nakedness do not
[3:39] appear and anoint thine eyes with isab
[3:42] that thou mayest see and as many as I
[3:45] love I rebuke and chasen be zealous
[3:50] therefore and
[3:52] repent that's a powerful statement right
[3:54] there right zealous means
[3:57] fervent without hesitation yes right and
[4:01] he's saying that he loves you right and
[4:03] he wants us to be zealous to repent and
[4:05] some people say they have nothing to
[4:07] repent for but here it's telling us to
[4:09] be zealous about it amen amen behold I
[4:12] stand at the door and knock and if any
[4:14] man hear my voice and open the door I
[4:17] will come in to him and I will s with
[4:20] him and he with me to him that
[4:23] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[4:26] in my throne even as uh even as I also
[4:30] overcame and am set down with my father
[4:33] in his throne he that hath an ear let
[4:36] him hear what the scripture saith unto
[4:38] the churches amen you may be
[4:41] seated Spirit say to the churches all
[4:44] right so what is
[4:48] lukewarm it's not hot it's hot in here
[4:50] tonight but it's not lukewarm what does
[4:52] it mean to be lukewarm I mean on the
[4:54] service we you know it it sounds like
[4:56] you know someone that's complacent right
[4:59] where you have enough salvation you have
[5:01] enough of Jesus to have salvation but
[5:04] he's not
[5:05] Lord okay that's very commonly how uh we
[5:10] think of being
[5:11] lukewarm but in uh the exposition on the
[5:14] church ages from the leosan church it
[5:17] brother brand goes a little bit further
[5:20] and he was definitely very intimately
[5:21] involved in the writing of this as we
[5:24] are going to look at this carefully it
[5:26] says that this layout and this is just
[5:28] for a background this says that the
[5:30] leian church age group is lukewarm this
[5:33] lukewarmness Demands a penalty from God
[5:36] the penalty is that they will be spewed
[5:39] out of his
[5:40] mouth um here is where we do not want to
[5:43] go astray as a lot of folks do and here
[5:47] he says he's talking to the church
[5:49] furthermore if you will just keep the
[5:51] word in mind you will recall that
[5:54] nowhere does it say that we are in the
[5:56] mouth of God we are engraved in his PO
[5:59] Ms we are carried in his bosom way back
[6:02] in the unknown ages before time we were
[6:05] in his mind we are his Sheepfold and in
[6:09] his PES but never in his mouth but what
[6:12] is in the mouth of the Lord the word is
[6:15] in his mouth amen Matthew 4:4 but he uh
[6:20] answered and saith it is written man
[6:22] shall not live by bread alone but by
[6:24] every word that proceedeth out of the
[6:26] mouth of God so what is wrong with these
[6:29] people people of the last day they have
[6:31] gotten away from the
[6:33] word amen they are no longer fervent
[6:37] about it they are
[6:39] lukewarm about it so what does that mean
[6:41] and and I'm kind this is going to kind
[6:43] of be a little bit of a recap of what
[6:44] brother Paul already spoke this morning
[6:47] and he goes into the Baptist saying the
[6:48] Baptists have their Creeds and dogmas
[6:51] based on the word right and you can't
[6:53] shake them they say the apostolic days
[6:56] of Miracles are over and there's no
[6:58] baptism with the Holy GES subsequent to
[7:00] believing right when you believe you got
[7:02] it that's not just Baptist that's also
[7:04] some people in the message as well but
[7:07] the devil believes and he trembles right
[7:11] um here it says uh uh subsequent to
[7:14] believing the method to say based on the
[7:16] word there is no water baptism
[7:19] sprinkling is not baptism and that
[7:21] sanctification is the baptism of the
[7:23] Holy Ghost so they're saying their works
[7:25] is what proves that they have the Holy
[7:27] Ghost the Church of Christ majors in
[7:30] regeneration or baptism and in all too
[7:33] many cases they go down dry Sinners and
[7:35] come up wet
[7:37] ones says yet they claim their Doctrine
[7:40] is word-based go right down the line and
[7:43] come to the Pentecostals do they have
[7:45] the word give them the word test and see
[7:48] yes they will sell out the word for a
[7:50] sensation just about every time that's
[7:52] right if you can produce a manifestation
[7:55] like oil and blood and tongues and other
[7:57] signs whether in the word or not or
[7:59] whether properly interpreted from the
[8:02] word the majority of it will fall for it
[8:05] exactly what brother Paul was preaching
[8:06] this morning but what has happened to
[8:10] the word the word has been put aside
[8:13] that's right so God says I'm going
[8:15] against you all and I will spew you out
[8:17] of my mouth this is the end for the SE
[8:20] for seven out of Seven Ages I have seen
[8:23] nothing but men esteeming their word
[8:27] above mine so that's that's what it
[8:29] means to be lukewarm prise God says so
[8:32] at the End of the Age I am spewing you
[8:34] out of my mouth it is all over I'm going
[8:36] to speak all right yes I'm here in the
[8:39] midst of the church yes the amen of God
[8:43] the faithful and true will reveal
[8:45] himself and it will be my Prophet oh yes
[8:49] that is so Revelation 10:7 says in the
[8:51] last days of the voice of the seventh
[8:53] messenger when he shall begin to sound
[8:56] the mystery of God should be finished as
[8:59] he had declared to his servants the
[9:01] prophets there it is he is sending
[9:03] sending a Vindicated prophet and it's to
[9:07] those that have a revelation it's just
[9:09] obvious right like you you read it it
[9:11] speaks to your heart and it's alive he
[9:14] is sending a Propet after almost 2,000
[9:17] years he is sending someone who is so
[9:19] far from the organization education and
[9:22] the world of religion that is John the
[9:24] Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear
[9:27] only from God and he will have thus
[9:29] sayith the Lord and speak for God
[9:32] hallelujah he will be God's mouthpiece
[9:35] amen and he as it is declared in Malachi
[9:38] 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children
[9:41] back to the fathers yes he will bring
[9:43] back the elect of the last day and they
[9:46] will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the
[9:49] exact truth as it was with Paul amen
[9:53] what we heard this morning he will
[9:55] restore the truth as they had it and
[9:58] those elect with him in in that day will
[10:01] be the ones who truly manifest the Lord
[10:04] and be his body and be his voice and
[10:08] perform his Works amen hallelujah do you
[10:11] see it yes amen he says a a momentary
[10:15] consideration so I'm still just doing
[10:16] background here a momentary
[10:18] consideration of church history will
[10:19] prove how accurate this thought is in
[10:22] the Dark Ages the word was almost
[10:24] entirely lost right but then God sent
[10:27] Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke
[10:30] for God at the time but then they
[10:32] organized right then God sent Wesley and
[10:35] and his voice with the word for his day
[10:38] and then they organized and that's where
[10:39] the Methodist failed right but he says
[10:42] yes sir the church is no longer the
[10:44] mouthpiece of God it's its own
[10:47] mouthpiece exactly amen so that's how
[10:50] you define who is luk warm when the
[10:53] church is its own mouthpiece so
[10:57] amen so God is turning on her he will
[11:00] confound her through the prophet and the
[11:03] bride for the voice of God will be in
[11:05] her says yes it is for it says in the
[11:08] last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the
[11:11] spirit and the bride say come once more
[11:14] the world will hear direct from God as
[11:17] at Pentecost amen so how do we get back
[11:20] to that
[11:22] right um now he has cried out to this
[11:25] last age you have the word you have more
[11:27] Bibles than ever but you are not doing
[11:30] anything about the word except dividing
[11:33] and hacking it into pieces praise God
[11:36] taking what you want and leaving out
[11:38] what you don't want yes says you're not
[11:41] interested in living it but debating it
[11:45] that's right amen this is the prophet's
[11:47] words right so if you want to know who's
[11:49] lukewarm well if that's what's happening
[11:52] where you're arguing over it instead of
[11:55] living it well if the shoe fits right
[11:58] amen hallelujah amen praise God I would
[12:01] sooner you were cold or hot if you were
[12:03] cold and rejected it I could stand that
[12:06] if you would get white hot to know its
[12:09] truth and live it I would praise you for
[12:11] that but when you simply take my word
[12:13] and don't honor it I in return must
[12:15] refuse to honor you I will spew you out
[12:19] um for you nauseate me amen praise God
[12:24] so it said in the last days as was
[12:27] declared by Malachi 46 I will will turn
[12:29] the hearts of the children back to the
[12:31] fathers right and he will bring back the
[12:33] elect of the last days and they will
[12:36] hear a Vindicated Prophet which we're so
[12:38] thankful forj amen the exact truth as it
[12:41] was with Paul so I know that I have the
[12:44] word of the revealed word of the Lord as
[12:47] Jesus revealed it amen right so what
[12:50] they were performing in the book of Acts
[12:52] if I want the same thing I know that I
[12:54] have it because the prophet brought back
[12:56] the same word amen
[13:00] praise God he will restore the truth as
[13:02] they had it and those elect with him in
[13:04] that day will be the ones who truly
[13:06] manifest the Lord and be his body his
[13:10] voice and perform his
[13:12] works so how do we make sure we're part
[13:15] of that body voice and have his works
[13:18] right so we'll go back to uh Verse 18
[13:21] how do we escape in this day I counsel
[13:25] thee to buy me gold tried in the fire
[13:29] yeah if we want to escape we have to be
[13:32] gold tried in the fire right because if
[13:35] when we're gold tried in the fire it
[13:36] says then we may be rich right we won't
[13:39] think we're rich like the ones that are
[13:40] spewed out of his mouth we will be rich
[13:43] because we're gold tried in the fire and
[13:45] we will have white rment so in order for
[13:48] me to have a white rment in this time I
[13:50] must be gold tried in the
[13:52] fire
[13:54] amen I want to get ahead of myself I get
[13:57] get excited about it I get excited
[14:01] because you can't politicize this right
[14:06] you you can't say think a certain way do
[14:09] a certain
[14:10] thing because gold tried and fire is
[14:14] character right it's not you're not got
[14:16] to be putting on heirs right it's
[14:19] something that is
[14:20] forged by God right amen hallelujah and
[14:26] this is such a a beautiful statement
[14:27] it's not only said in Revelation
[14:29] there's other scriptures that I'll get
[14:31] to he says as many as I love I rebuke
[14:34] and
[14:35] chasen amen so the Lord showed his love
[14:39] to us this morning right we should
[14:42] rejoice when we get rebuked and Chas him
[14:45] by the Lord because that shows that he
[14:47] loves us amen praise
[14:50] God Amen to him that overcometh will I
[14:53] grant to sit with me in my Throne what a
[14:56] blessing hallelujah amen so overcome in
[14:59] this day we must be gold tried in the
[15:01] fire to have white rment and I'm joyful
[15:05] for his rebukes and his chastising amen
[15:10] and that only could happen when I open
[15:12] my heart fully to him amenallah so what
[15:15] does it mean to be gold tried and fire
[15:18] right if we want to know how to have
[15:21] white rment we really need to understand
[15:23] the process of gold tried in the
[15:26] fire we need to know what the process is
[15:29] and how to stand without wavering
[15:31] through it
[15:33] amen because if we don't understand the
[15:35] full process of gold tried in the fire
[15:39] the devil can shake us amen Jesus said
[15:42] in St John 12 and verse 23 he says Jesus
[15:46] answered them saying The Hours come that
[15:48] the son of man should be glorified
[15:51] verily verily I say unto you except a
[15:54] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[15:56] die it abideth alone but if it die it
[16:00] bringeth forth much fruit so the only
[16:02] way we can bring forth fruit is if we
[16:06] die amen praise God in the seven Church
[16:11] ages brother Bram says a man can't join
[16:14] church or get emotional worked up or
[16:17] anything else and become a
[16:19] Christian it's got to be a solid birth
[16:22] of the
[16:23] spirit sincerity dying out crying out
[16:28] laying there he's dead twice prise God
[16:32] remember life can only come out of death
[16:36] amen it says in the midst of corruption
[16:38] Comes The Germ of life that gives it
[16:41] life and produces more so the only way
[16:43] we're able to produce fruit or produce
[16:45] more is if we die right Hallelujah so
[16:48] what are we producing right and I'm I'm
[16:51] saying stuff that you know right what
[16:53] are we producing what is the fruit right
[16:56] Galatians 5 says in verse 22
[16:59] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[17:02] peace longsuffering gentleness goodness
[17:05] Faith meekness Temperance against such
[17:08] there is no law and they that are Christ
[17:11] have crucified the flesh with the
[17:13] affections of the lust and if we live in
[17:15] the spirit let us also walk in the
[17:18] spirit so I god is perfect he knows what
[17:23] he's doing right because I can't
[17:25] manufacture
[17:26] fruit right I may understand it
[17:29] intellectually I might I may understand
[17:31] the definition of patience but because I
[17:34] read what patience is doesn't mean I
[17:37] have it right the only way that I can
[17:40] experience patience is to go through
[17:43] something that's going to require
[17:45] patience amen praise God so fruit is
[17:50] character and character is forged by
[17:53] experience amen amen in the lamb and the
[17:55] dove he says a sheep was never asked to
[17:58] manufacture manufactur wool he was asked
[18:01] to Bear wool and so it is with the
[18:03] church the Christian church we are never
[18:06] asked to manufacture fruits we are asked
[18:10] to bear fruit Galatians 5 the fruit of
[18:12] the spirit he says these are not to be
[18:15] manufactured there to be Products that
[18:17] come from the inside out the outside
[18:21] life that we live prove what's on the
[18:23] inside amen amen now we have tried to
[18:27] manufacture this
[18:29] to manufacture the fruits of the spirit
[18:32] it always turns out to be
[18:34] hypocrisy right like when you mentally
[18:37] understand something but you have no
[18:39] patience or Temperance right you claim
[18:42] to have Temperance right then all of a
[18:45] sudden you get into that situation that
[18:47] rears its ugly head and yes now you
[18:50] living in hypocrisy yes sir amen good
[18:53] amen Christianity it's an experience by
[18:57] a spirit that lives in you and bears
[19:00] fruit of itself you cannot you cannot
[19:02] Manu manufacture it we have tried to
[19:05] educate it we have tried to denominate
[19:07] it and we we do uh when we do we turn
[19:11] out hypocrisy and failure that's right
[19:13] amen it's uh not done as God intended
[19:18] the spirit inside us bearing fruits of
[19:20] its presence that's God's program and it
[19:23] could never be changed amen praise Goden
[19:27] thank you Lord so we need we need to be
[19:29] willing to Die the death of a corn of
[19:31] wheat to be able to bear fruit of the
[19:33] spirit right where we forfeit our own
[19:36] rights right Jesus where Jesus is not
[19:40] just my savior but he's my Lord amen I
[19:44] have to be willing like a lamb amen
[19:47] where all I have I give to God right
[19:50] where I forfeit My Wo he says when we're
[19:53] willing to Forfeit our ideas to follow
[19:56] God right and in here I like this cuz
[19:59] I'm an American and this is a true
[20:01] statement he says uh we're Americans and
[20:04] Americans can't be led so if you stay in
[20:07] your American Spirit you know we we like
[20:10] to be out front right we we like to lead
[20:13] he says um uh we know all about it and
[20:16] we know how to lead so the dove can't
[20:18] lead us right that's where we become
[20:20] Christians we become pilgrims and
[20:22] strangers and I'm no longer an American
[20:24] I'm a citizen of Heaven amen praise God
[20:29] when we've got that kind of attitude why
[20:31] we can't be led we've got to when we say
[20:33] we've got to lead the people but God's
[20:35] the one leader uh from his for his
[20:39] church right he's the holy spirit is the
[20:41] leader amen Matthew 16 uh verse 24 says
[20:47] then Jesus said unto his disciples If
[20:49] any man will come after me let him deny
[20:52] himself yeah and take up his cross and
[20:55] follow me amen that's where Jesus
[20:58] becomes my Lord and not just my savior
[21:01] praise God hallelujah amen right this is
[21:04] where where brother Paul had had on hit
[21:07] on this this morning as well he says we
[21:08] must welcome him Lord come into my house
[21:12] if there's anything if there's anything
[21:14] in there that you want help yourself
[21:17] right the great king the creator of
[21:19] heavens and earth has knocked at my door
[21:21] and I want him to come in right this is
[21:24] what we were doing this morning any bad
[21:25] thing that's in me discover every secret
[21:28] that's in my my heart go in every door
[21:30] search me out amen I want you here and I
[21:34] welcome you in to be my Lord amen right
[21:37] just not my savior but my Lord including
[21:40] all the doors to my heart even where
[21:42] it's called my private life right this
[21:44] is from door to door amen I turn it all
[21:48] over to Christ
[21:50] amen so if we want to display fruit of
[21:53] the spirit what are we trying to die
[21:56] then too right what do we want to have
[21:58] burnt out of us so what is the opposite
[22:00] of the fruit of the spirit 1 Peter
[22:03] 2 verse uh 1 and
[22:06] 2 wherefore laying aside all malice and
[22:10] all guile and all hypocrisies and envies
[22:13] and all evil speaking as newborn babes
[22:16] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[22:18] ye may grow thereby so what is malice
[22:22] right malice is the desire to cause pain
[22:25] or distress to someone else right when
[22:27] someone else kind of ticks you off right
[22:29] and you want to get back at them well
[22:31] that's that's
[22:32] malice or guile uh guile is deceitful
[22:36] cunning when I'm not being completely
[22:38] truthful of my
[22:40] intentions hypocrisy we talked about
[22:42] that already right where I say one thing
[22:44] and I do another exactly um Envy Envy is
[22:48] the resentful awareness of an advantage
[22:51] enjoyed by someone else I want what they
[22:53] have right Pride that's a good one
[22:57] sometimes that's hard to
[22:59] recognize CU pride is the exaggerated
[23:04] self-esteem right like it's good to have
[23:07] confidence but if I'm prideful and I
[23:10] exaggerate my abilities or I I could do
[23:14] it on my own or I don't need God or I
[23:16] don't need help um being prideful temper
[23:19] right proness to anger right so these
[23:21] are the things that we need to die too
[23:23] in order to be able to display the
[23:25] fruits of the spirit amen
[23:28] Hebrews 12 verse one and and two
[23:31] wherefore seeing we uh we also are
[23:34] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[23:36] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[23:40] and sin which doth easily beset us and
[23:42] let us run with patience the race that
[23:45] is set before us looking unto Jesus the
[23:48] author and finisher of our faith who for
[23:50] the joy that was set before him endured
[23:53] the
[23:57] cross always struggle with that and
[23:59] another scripture that I'll get too it
[24:01] ISS uh who for the joy that was set
[24:04] before him endured the cross right and
[24:07] there's another scripture that talks
[24:09] about you know count it all joy when you
[24:11] fall into diverse Temptations amen right
[24:14] am I supposed to be joyful by hard
[24:16] trials amen well we'll get to that
[24:19] praise the Lord amen so now that we've
[24:22] surrendered our heart to him we want him
[24:25] to be Lord and not just savior right and
[24:28] we know that we cannot
[24:31] manufacture the fruits of the spirit
[24:33] right so it's nothing that you're going
[24:35] to do on your own right I'm not going to
[24:38] intellectually as I mentioned display
[24:40] longsuffering or meekness right that's
[24:43] that's not
[24:45] possible so it said the Lord chastises
[24:47] those he loves amen right right we all
[24:50] he's asking us to do is surrender to him
[24:53] right so what is this process what is
[24:56] the biblical process
[24:59] uh for this right that comes by
[25:01] experience right going back to
[25:03] Revelation
[25:04] 3 where it says I counsel thee to buy of
[25:08] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[25:10] mayest be rich so we know we need to be
[25:14] tried in the fire as gold and that's
[25:16] what's going to make us rich yes right
[25:19] and this is where I was just referring
[25:20] to James 1 feels like a contradiction
[25:23] where James 1 and verse2 says my
[25:25] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[25:28] fall into diverse
[25:30] Temptations and without understanding
[25:33] that just feels wrong almost right like
[25:37] why should I be joyful when I'm going to
[25:40] go through pain I'm going to go through
[25:42] a trial I'm going to go through a test
[25:44] no but James 1 is saying count it all
[25:46] joy right why knowing this that the
[25:50] trying of your faith worketh patience oh
[25:53] there's a fruit of the spirit but let
[25:56] patience have her perfect work
[25:58] that ye may be perfect mature that you
[26:01] may be mature entire wanting nothing and
[26:04] if any man lack
[26:06] wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to
[26:09] all men liberally and abrath not and it
[26:12] shall be given see I knew I was on the
[26:13] beam this morning brother Tony amen amen
[26:17] wow amen so does this mean I need to be
[26:19] happy through my pain no but it's us
[26:22] having understanding that what I'm going
[26:26] through is for my benefit
[26:29] amen praise God right Hebrews 12 and
[26:33] verse 5 says and ye have forgotten the
[26:36] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[26:39] unto children my son wow despise not
[26:43] that the chastening of the Lord nor
[26:45] faint when thou art rebuked of him right
[26:49] it's it's a natural inclination to to
[26:51] feel shame when we get rebuked right
[26:53] because something's being
[26:55] exposed right but it's saying despise
[26:57] not that right for the Lord loveth uh
[27:01] the for whom the Lord loveth he chasen
[27:04] so when you get rebuked or when that
[27:07] gets exposed in your life you should
[27:09] count it Joy because that's showing you
[27:11] God loves you right otherwise he would
[27:14] you don't even have to pay attention to
[27:15] you but the fact that that's happening
[27:18] is the love of God to you prise God Amen
[27:21] and gorgeous every son whom he receiveth
[27:25] right so the reason I'm getting
[27:26] chastised is because I'm his son I have
[27:29] the privilege to be the son of the of
[27:33] Jehovah God Amen praise God if you
[27:37] endure chastening God dealth with you as
[27:40] with sons so that's how I could count it
[27:43] Joy right when I'm going through diverse
[27:46] Temptations and trials and tests because
[27:49] that proves that I'm his son amen amen
[27:52] so that tell the devil that next time he
[27:54] tries to make you feel bad for something
[27:57] that you're going through amen well I'm
[27:59] a Son of God Amen praise God verse 10
[28:04] says for they ver for they verily for a
[28:06] few days chasen us after their own
[28:09] Pleasures but he for our profit that we
[28:12] might be partakers of his
[28:14] Holiness now no chastening for the
[28:17] present seem to be joyous right so
[28:19] doesn't mean you have to be happy when
[28:20] it when it's happening but but Grievous
[28:22] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[28:25] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[28:28] them which are exercised thereof so I
[28:31] know that it's going to produce fruit
[28:34] yes it is amen praise
[28:37] God so this is where I wanted to get to
[28:40] so that's my background we know we're
[28:42] going to go through trials we know we're
[28:44] going to go to through Temptations but
[28:46] count it Joy because that means you are
[28:48] a child of God you are a son and
[28:50] daughter of God Amen but what is this
[28:53] process like there are many scriptures
[28:55] in the Bible that type it to gold trid
[28:57] and fire Proverbs
[29:00] 17:3 it says the fining pot is for
[29:03] silver and the furnace for gold but the
[29:06] Lord trith the hearts Isaiah 48:10 says
[29:10] behold I have refined thee but not with
[29:14] silver I have chosen thee in the furnace
[29:17] of Affliction wow
[29:19] amen uh 1 Peter 1 uh starting with verse
[29:23] three says blessed be the God and father
[29:26] of our Lord Jesus Christ which Accord
[29:28] according to His abundant Mercy hath
[29:30] begotten us again unto Lively Hope by
[29:33] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[29:35] the dead all right so showing us his
[29:37] grace and mercy to us for what to an
[29:40] inheritance Incorruptible glory and
[29:43] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[29:46] reserved in heaven for me for you amen
[29:51] who are kept by the power of God through
[29:54] faith yes so you are kept by the power
[29:57] of God God through faith unto salvation
[30:00] ready to be revealed in the last time
[30:04] wherein you greatly Rejoice though now
[30:07] for a season if need be you are in
[30:10] heaviness through manifold temptations
[30:13] that the trial of your faith being much
[30:15] more precious than gold that perish
[30:17] though it be tried with fire it is might
[30:20] be found unto praise and honor and Glory
[30:23] at the appearing of Jesus Christ right
[30:25] so that should be my prayer is God try
[30:28] me like gold right amen so what are the
[30:32] stages of being tried as gold in the
[30:35] fire I mean because it's an ancient
[30:38] practice so I think to truly overcome we
[30:41] need to understand each stage of the
[30:43] process right stage one breaking up kind
[30:48] of had this this morning what is the
[30:51] first step of the refiner of gold the
[30:53] refiner Begins by breaking up rough ore
[30:55] and rock this is so that the precious
[30:58] metal can be exposed to the heat of the
[31:00] fire right Jeremiah 2329 says is not my
[31:05] word like as a fire sayeth the Lord and
[31:08] like a hammer that
[31:15] breakthe to yourselves in righteousness
[31:17] reap in Mercy break up your fellow
[31:19] ground amen so that's the first step is
[31:23] him breaking up our fow ground so that
[31:26] the precious metal the fruits of the
[31:27] spirit Spirit can be exposed stage two
[31:32] the refiner puts crushed and broken ore
[31:34] into The Crucible the definition of
[31:37] Crucible is a situation of severe trial
[31:41] in which different elements interact
[31:43] leading to the creation of something new
[31:46] and in Crucible in the old times is a
[31:49] pot that can withstand heavy fire and
[31:52] The Rock gets put into The Crucible it's
[31:55] a fireproof Melting Pot able to
[31:57] withstand extreme heat amen so Zechariah
[32:02] 13 verse 9 says and I will bring the
[32:04] third part through the fire and will
[32:07] refine them as silver is refined and I
[32:09] will try them as gold is tried they
[32:12] shall call on my name and I will hear
[32:14] them I will say it is my people and they
[32:16] shall say the Lord is my God Amen so
[32:20] things that I've talked about many of us
[32:22] already understand right we understand
[32:25] that we need to go through severe trials
[32:27] we know that our ground needs to be
[32:28] broken up and we know that we need to go
[32:30] through the heat for the for the
[32:32] precious metal to be exposed but I think
[32:34] many Christians don't understand the
[32:36] next parts of the process and and when
[32:39] we're going through these tests and
[32:41] trials and this is where the devil likes
[32:43] to discourage you and and trip you up if
[32:47] you don't understand the following steps
[32:49] to the refining process amen so let's
[32:52] let's talk about that stage three the
[32:56] dross the purpose of placing the ore in
[32:59] The Crucible in the furnace is to remove
[33:02] dross dross what is dross the scum or
[33:06] unwanted materials that forms on the
[33:08] surface impurities right so we have
[33:11] impurities malice and temper and anger
[33:14] and envies and hypocrisies right so that
[33:17] draw is within us and as we go through
[33:19] these trials those impurities come to
[33:22] the surface amen so as the ore melts in
[33:25] The Crucible under the watchful eye of
[33:27] the refiner a layer of impurities called
[33:29] dross eventually forms on the surface so
[33:33] this is where a typical Christian
[33:35] without experience tends to stumble
[33:37] because all of a sudden these things are
[33:39] exposed in their life and they think
[33:42] they
[33:42] failed the purpose of the refining pot
[33:46] The Crucible is to bring it to life to
[33:49] bring it to the surface so that it can
[33:52] be cleaned hallelujah amen praise God
[33:55] hallelujah amen amen amen so it is is a
[33:58] good thing when it is exposed amen
[34:02] praise God and this is where the devil
[34:04] tries to beat you up over it because now
[34:07] this has been exposed and I didn't know
[34:09] this was I didn't know I still had this
[34:11] or you know in my
[34:15] nature but this trial has kind of
[34:17] exposed it now I can deal with it amen
[34:21] praise God where the refiner can now
[34:24] skim that dross off of the gold amen
[34:30] praise God Proverbs 25 says take away
[34:33] the draw from the silver and there shall
[34:35] come forth a vessel for the refiner
[34:39] praise God Isaiah 1 and 125 says and I
[34:42] will turn my hand upon thee and purely
[34:45] Purge away thy dross and take away all
[34:48] thy tin and I will restore thy judges as
[34:52] at the first and thy counselors as at
[34:54] the beginning afterwards Thou shalt be
[34:57] called the city of righteousness a
[34:59] faithful City so when the Lord deals
[35:01] with you and that draw comes to the
[35:04] surface and he's able to skim that out
[35:06] of your life Hallelujah he will call you
[35:09] a faithful City amen a city of
[35:12] righteousness amen is it
[35:15] over unfortunately it is not
[35:18] over amen stage four the
[35:24] heat the refiner raises the Heat
[35:28] to higher
[35:29] degrees oh Lord I just made it through
[35:33] this amen you're going to raise the heat
[35:36] after the refiner painstakingly skims
[35:39] off of these impurities he then turns up
[35:41] the heat and places The Crucible back
[35:44] into the blistering
[35:46] furnace again and again up to seven
[35:49] times we are told in historical
[35:51] literature impurities rise to the
[35:53] surface why because a refiner knows that
[35:56] only certain certain impurities can be
[35:58] released at certain temperatures yeah
[36:01] right so only certain specially designed
[36:04] trials and things will bring out certain
[36:07] things and God will do it at the right
[36:10] time right so don't don't beat yourself
[36:13] up right like oh i' I've I've I've been
[36:17] walking with the Lord for 15 years and
[36:20] now all of a sudden in I'm in a trial
[36:22] and this comes to the surface I thought
[36:24] I dealt with that a long time ago well
[36:26] the Lord knew that you weren't able to
[36:28] deal with it properly until
[36:31] now amen praise God right because
[36:35] certain impurities are only released at
[36:37] certain temperatures Psalms 12 and: 6
[36:40] says the words of the Lord are pure
[36:42] words as silver tried in a furnace of
[36:45] Earth purified seven times Hallelujah
[36:49] Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt
[36:52] preserve them from this generation
[36:54] forever so don't fear right it's talking
[36:56] about being in the furnace seven times
[37:00] and it says very next line Thou shalt
[37:02] keep them oh Lord hallelujah the Lord is
[37:05] going to keep you amen he is the refiner
[37:09] praise God I believe this is from time
[37:12] Testament morals he says there's a
[37:14] memorial to the death of Christ that's
[37:16] his church some people don't want to
[37:19] live it some people will it's a testing
[37:21] time God is testing people today for his
[37:24] memorials blessed be the name of the
[37:26] Lord for temptation
[37:28] when I am weak then I am strong said
[37:30] Paul every son that cometh to God must
[37:32] first be tried and tested amen until the
[37:35] beater sees his reflection in the gold
[37:39] amen that's the way God does his church
[37:42] he gives you trial after trial test
[37:45] after test trial after trial test after
[37:47] test until the Life of Christ is
[37:50] reflected in your life Hallelujah until
[37:52] you become
[37:54] peaceful sober Hallelujah meek
[37:58] gentle humble ready submissive willing
[38:03] to turn your head on the things of the
[38:04] world and looking straight to Calvary it
[38:07] sounds like fruits of the spirit to me
[38:09] amen many times you think it's strange
[38:12] because of fiery trials and sickness and
[38:14] persecution it's only done to test you
[38:17] to get the dirt out of you Amen to get
[38:20] the dross away amen praise God to get
[38:24] the slowness out of you to wake you up
[38:27] to a place where you can look and see
[38:29] the reflection or man can see the
[38:31] reflection of Christ in you amen praise
[38:35] God right where I'm not reflecting my
[38:36] word I'm going to reflect his word
[38:39] praise God it's only strengthens you
[38:42] every trial and testing it only loosens
[38:44] The Roots so that you they can grow
[38:46] deeper and get a better hold amen uh so
[38:49] you can get down and get a better hold
[38:51] on the Eternal Rock of God's unmovable
[38:53] word praise God stage five the
[38:57] purification the refiner continues to
[39:00] remove the impurities each time with the
[39:03] utmost skill and patience the refiner
[39:06] removes the dross leaving behind
[39:08] gleaming gold and shimmering silver
[39:10] purer and more precious than before to
[39:14] gauge his process the refiner looks for
[39:16] his own reflection on the surface amen
[39:19] hallelujah praise God glory the more
[39:21] drops removed the less distorted his
[39:24] reflection amen the Bible says our
[39:27] refiner sits over the refining process
[39:30] to purify us so this is Malachi 3
[39:33] 1-3 he says behold I will send my
[39:36] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[39:38] before thee and the Lord whom you seek
[39:40] shall suddenly come to his Temple amen
[39:43] even the messenger of the Covenant whom
[39:45] ye Delight in behold he shall come
[39:47] sayeth the Lord of hosts but who may
[39:50] abide the day of his coming and who
[39:52] shall stand when he appear for he is
[39:54] like a Refiner's Fire and like a fuller
[39:58] soap and he shall sit as a refiner and
[40:01] purifier of the silver and he shall
[40:04] purify the sons of Levi and purge them
[40:07] as gold and silver amen so the refiner
[40:11] has to show great care and watch over
[40:13] The Crucible as it's in the fire and I'm
[40:16] just going to read some a few things
[40:18] from Spurgeon that I I thought were
[40:20] really uh well said he's he's well
[40:23] written on how he lays things out um and
[40:26] here he was talking talking about um the
[40:29] refiner he says the grandest thing that
[40:31] God himself can do in the purpose of his
[40:33] love is to purify us into his own
[40:36] glorious Holiness he says now notice
[40:38] carefully the attitude of the refiner he
[40:41] shall
[40:42] sit yes sitting looks like the attitude
[40:46] of
[40:48] indifference right says um there is uh a
[40:52] mental um there is the metal vexed with
[40:55] the white heat here in the refiner
[40:57] sitting down there is the child of God
[41:00] upon the bed of pain and he cries my
[41:02] Lord come and help me and there the
[41:04] refiner sits looks on but does not stir
[41:07] a hand I know we've all been there in
[41:10] that where you're crying out to God and
[41:11] you're wondering why he's not answering
[41:13] you in your trial and of course the
[41:16] question comes to your mind carest thou
[41:19] not that we perish yes right says the
[41:23] refiner sits still why should he be
[41:26] flurried he knows what he's at he's not
[41:30] hurting the silver but doing it a
[41:32] lasting service he's not even putting it
[41:35] through the a needless process right
[41:37] sometimes it feels like a needless
[41:38] process as we cry out and we don't hear
[41:40] a
[41:41] response right this is what I like he
[41:44] says he's taking the shortest way of
[41:48] working when he seems to be the longest
[41:51] to us right Glory he moves at the pace
[41:55] of perfection
[41:58] right because God is perfect he knows
[42:00] all things right so when I'm going
[42:02] through a trial that I don't understand
[42:05] right and I'm crying out to him and he's
[42:07] not feels like he's not responding to me
[42:11] but he knows what's good for me he knows
[42:12] what I need right and he's sitting with
[42:15] care over me working at the pace of
[42:19] perfection amen he is resolved steadily
[42:22] to watch The Crucible he will not go
[42:25] away or leave it even for a moment right
[42:27] he says he will never leave us or
[42:29] forsake us amen given up on all other
[42:34] cares just to sit there and watch his
[42:36] treasure he's determined that his
[42:38] servants shall be purified amen the Lord
[42:42] watches each one of his people as
[42:44] intensely as if he had not
[42:48] another right because God is omnipotent
[42:51] he knows all things so he can watch me
[42:53] just as much as he can watch you
[42:55] intently like there's nobody else amen
[42:59] because God is the center he's
[43:01] everywhere Jesus watches each one Yan
[43:05] obviously it's a Spurgeon right Yan me
[43:07] 50,000 others all of them his chosen
[43:10] ones that are undergoing the purifying
[43:13] process he is sitting down his sitting
[43:16] down is not because he forgets but it's
[43:18] because he remembers amen amen the this
[43:23] metal may need to be purified in a
[43:25] furnace of Earth seven times but I I am
[43:27] setting I am set upon the perfecting of
[43:30] the work and therefore here I place
[43:33] myself the Lord has had boundless
[43:36] patience with some of us
[43:38] already
[43:40] amen for we required a whole world of
[43:45] purifying and we have been very slow to
[43:47] receive it that's right how many sermons
[43:50] have we heard and yet how little have we
[43:53] been purified by the word I've been
[43:55] there how of often has the spirit
[43:58] striven with with us and yet every
[44:00] thought is not yet brought into
[44:02] captivity amen how often have we had
[44:05] near the True Fellowship with Christ and
[44:07] yet have again forsaken him how
[44:09] frequently have we had to endure the
[44:11] furnace of Affliction and yet our draws
[44:13] and Tin are not removed the refiner the
[44:16] refiner still preserves with a settled
[44:20] resolve and ceaseless love he will not
[44:22] give up on his gracious task here then
[44:27] Faith sees Divine attention and settled
[44:29] patience where unbelief dares to suspect
[44:32] unfulfilling indifference
[44:35] amen final stage stage six the
[44:39] reflection the refiner sees a clear
[44:42] image of himself praise God only when
[44:45] the refiner investigates The Crucible
[44:47] and sees a clear reflection of himself
[44:50] is the process complete finally the
[44:52] silver or gold attains the highest
[44:54] degree of Purity 2 Corinthians
[44:57] uh um 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse1
[45:00] 17 says now the Lord is that spirit and
[45:03] where the spirit of the Lord there is
[45:05] Liberty but we all with open face
[45:08] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[45:10] Lord are changed into the same image
[45:13] from glory to glory even as by the
[45:15] spirit of the
[45:17] Lord amen and in Romans 8
[45:21] and16 the spirit itself Bears witness
[45:24] with our spirit that we are children of
[45:26] God and if we are children then heirs
[45:29] Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ
[45:33] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[45:35] Al we may be also glorified together for
[45:39] I reckon that the suffering of this
[45:41] present time are not worthy to be
[45:43] compared with the glory which shall be
[45:44] revealed in us why because this is what
[45:47] we're waiting for right here for the
[45:49] earnest expectation of the creature
[45:51] waiteth for the manifestations of the
[45:53] sons of God and the only way that's
[45:55] going to happen is gold tried in the
[45:58] fire to receive the white Remnant amen
[46:02] praise
[46:03] God almost done here that's power praise
[46:06] God this is from uh hear you him says
[46:12] the trees and the animal life everything
[46:14] is waiting for the manifestation of the
[46:16] sons of God the church has got to get
[46:18] ready right now he's talking about
[46:21] tutoring he says now notice as we go a
[46:23] little farther now if the sun was kind
[46:26] of a renegade boy and he did not obey
[46:28] the father why the tutor blushed and why
[46:31] the father never could give him anything
[46:33] but what if he was a good boy and when
[46:37] the father said how is my son
[46:38] progressing oh the tutor says father you
[46:41] know what your boy is just exactly like
[46:44] you he's about your business he does it
[46:47] just the way you would do it why the
[46:50] whole kingdom here can see your
[46:53] reflection right in that boy oh my
[46:55] that's what we want
[46:57] that's it reflections of Jesus Christ
[46:59] Hallelujah in the old world they used to
[47:02] take the gold and the beater would beat
[47:04] it and beat the draw out of it and and
[47:07] how he know he had it all out when his
[47:10] own reflection come into the gold he had
[47:12] all the dirt out of it and the dross out
[47:14] of it and that's the way God does his
[47:16] church he beats uh it with the power of
[47:19] the Gospel wow telling them telling them
[47:22] over give them over on this side and
[47:25] that side and beating out all the world
[47:27] and all the doubt amen right because as
[47:29] you go through this refining
[47:32] process you get more faith by experience
[47:35] right like like David with the bear the
[47:37] lion and then he was able to take on
[47:39] Goliath right so going through this
[47:42] process as you go further and higher
[47:45] heat right well I know I can stand the
[47:47] higher heat because I've been through
[47:48] this already and I know it's for my
[47:51] benefit to get the draw out praise God
[47:55] Amen praise God
[47:58] God Amen till we can see the reflection
[48:01] the church moving in the power of God
[48:03] just like Jesus was here on Earth his
[48:05] reflecting himself in the church now how
[48:08] the Holy Spirit uh how the Holy Spirit
[48:11] go up and say oh that church why the
[48:14] signs and wonders and reflections of
[48:16] your life is perfect they are performing
[48:20] everything that you did just like you
[48:22] said amen there's someone that's got
[48:25] real character amen amen that's cuzz
[48:28] that's what it comes down to to be able
[48:30] to be a reflection of Jesus Christ I
[48:33] have to have real character which I
[48:35] cannot manufacture no sir it has to be
[48:38] forged by the trying of my faith amen
[48:42] amen there's someone that's got real
[48:44] character that's what the Bible wants us
[48:46] to do that's what God wants us to do
[48:48] that's what the Holy Spirit wants us to
[48:50] do amen praise God thank you Lord
[48:54] getting ready to close here praise God
[48:57] amen so going back to James 1 my
[48:59] brethren count it all joy right we I can
[49:01] count it all joy I can honestly identify
[49:04] with that scripture now right where I
[49:06] can count it all joy when I'm going
[49:08] through the different Temptations and
[49:10] tests and trials right knowing that it's
[49:12] going to work my faith and and patience
[49:16] right where I could let patience have
[49:17] her perfect work uh within me right and
[49:20] jumping down I think this is verse 12
[49:22] says blessed is the man that endureth
[49:24] Temptation for when he is true tried he
[49:27] shall receive the crown of life amen
[49:32] praise God hallelujah and then going
[49:34] back to our scripture I counsel thee to
[49:37] buy me gold tried in the fire that thou
[49:40] mayest be rich right if I want to be
[49:42] rich because God's economy is completely
[49:44] different than ours right I mean yes he
[49:47] can bless me he can bless my business he
[49:49] can bless my family like that's part of
[49:51] the Hebrew laws and so forth but once
[49:54] that hedge of protection is taken away
[49:56] like it was with job because the devil
[49:59] challenged God which he's going to do
[50:01] with you right right God's economy so I
[50:05] I completely changed my outlook on how I
[50:08] judge whether I'm successful or not
[50:10] right I'm not looking at what I have or
[50:13] what I could provide or or anything like
[50:15] that or even just the the the the
[50:17] circumstances and situations that I'm
[50:19] going through or that my children going
[50:21] going through just because it's a hard
[50:23] trial does it mean oh my gosh what's
[50:25] going on right I'm looking at God's
[50:28] currency amen his currency is
[50:30] character right and if I know that the
[50:33] trying of it is going to produce gold in
[50:36] a reflection of Jesus Christ well I can
[50:38] count at joy for for what I'm going
[50:41] through praise God so this is where you
[50:43] can tell Satan right that I'm his son
[50:48] right because I'm going through this I'm
[50:49] a Son of God right you want to confound
[50:52] the devil and frustrate him as you go
[50:55] through hard trial he's not going to
[50:56] know what to do with you right right cuz
[51:00] if if it if you're going through a
[51:02] Mountaintop well you're rejoicing right
[51:05] right all of a sudden now you're in a
[51:06] valley and you're still rejoicing right
[51:08] what do I got to do right you're going
[51:10] to confuse the Devil by saying well I
[51:13] counted all joy right because he counts
[51:15] me as a son I'd be worried if I wasn't
[51:17] going through a trial or a Temptation
[51:20] right because I want that character to
[51:22] be developed Within Me amen praise God
[51:25] so know that as a son and daughter of
[51:28] Christ Jesus sits as the
[51:31] refiner over you working at the pace of
[51:35] perfection in your life right you don't
[51:38] have to worry about will I make it right
[51:41] amen because he's working at the pace of
[51:43] perfection in your life to bring out the
[51:45] character that is needed amen so you can
[51:48] have confidence you could have trust in
[51:52] the Lord knowing that he sits over you
[51:55] right even even though it may not feel
[51:57] like he's walking with you he's sitting
[52:00] and watching over you at the pace of
[52:02] perfection right knowing that it's to
[52:05] bring out the reflection of Jesus Christ
[52:07] in my life amen and never get frustrated
[52:11] when the dross is
[52:12] exposed yes good good don't like Rejoice
[52:17] again then you're going to confound the
[52:18] devil when you do that as well like
[52:20] Hallelujah that was exposed now I can
[52:23] zealously repent as it says in
[52:25] Revelation
[52:27] right so that I can be tried as gold and
[52:31] have white rment right because he counts
[52:33] me as a son and daughter of God so I
[52:37] hope this helps you and better equips
[52:39] you as you go on Monday and Tuesday and
[52:42] no matter what you face know that he
[52:44] sits and he's with you and he's working
[52:46] at the pace of perfection amen so I pray
