we are to be here and thankful to brother Jesse for allowing us to come and I want to say how nice it is to be back in house let's see the weather was agreeable coming up the road nice and clear and all that I I'm an old Ohio boy even though I live in Tennessee and most of my people come from Tennessee I asked for the Jessie I said well once the roads look like he said nice and clear I said praise Laurel what I want to hear a man that's that's the way but so thankful to be here I thought I was going to have me another Smith for a Bible this week I was supposed to pretty sure your brother this coming weekend and Napoleon but we rearranged things just a little bit my pastor and I say this for this purpose on they they found a lump in his mother's long and she'd had cancer once before and so he's making a trip next week to go up I think they got some testing or some kind of a thing we use of course bring you greetings from the church their Murphysboro but ask you also to pray if you would as brother goes up there to visit his mom that you know the Lord would just bring the test back negative no problems no nothing like that so but anyhow Willa will see brother can the following weekend which is that right in the new year and so god bless you and we certainly we wish you a Merry Christmas but not like the song with all the Santa Clauses them other things we're talking about Jesus this time of year in and we should be talking about him every time of year I don't care what the season is whether it's blazing hot or freezing cold he should be the reason for every season I think and I sure appreciate the Lord glad to have my wife with me this is a good time for you schoolteachers you can kind of kick back let your hair down a little bit in it and glad to have her with me and so we're we're thankful we made it in real safely and come in last night and the Lord helping us we had a real nice trip in and just as I was going this morning I got a couple things on my heart that I was gonna try to bring and I was looking down at some of these notes now God helped me I'm gonna try to get done within you know today today today you know today ends at midnight tonight so we'll just see how it goes but I got so much hay on the floor so I hope you come hungry a man this morning feed on the word of the Lord and I don't know how long it'll take me to get out but I'm gonna try to watch the clock as quick as I can to get out and we're gonna have probably lunch over to Giant Eagle or whatever you call that place over yonder and and and and then come back eat at the Eagle and then Eagles come back and eat again Amen that's right and so we thank the Lord now I just want to mention to you quickly as I always try to keep some of our travels and things before you here in January myself brother Jason to Mars with the Dale Smith mostly might recognize Jason he's the brothers done all that work in Turkey with the Iranian refugees and what more well he's putting together a missionary team to go to Egypt the last weekend of January my ticket has bought the visas on the way and we're heading there to do some mission work the last week of January that's I forget exactly will you leave on February 1st so ever what those last four or five days starting maybe 26 up through and it's going to be for services a day in a conference for about three or four days in a row and so you know you pray for pray for us as we go there might be some other brothers joining us at this time it's just us three that we know of but please pray for that if you would that the Lord would help us in that a man I I appreciate the opportunity be able to join and I'll take God's really doing some things over in that part of the world and to my understanding he's not message searches now these are brand new people right just bedrock beginnings and right in the very beginning of it and so we're gonna go over there and try to do our part try to help the kingdom of the Lord along and getting this close to the rapture so if you would just remember that the Lord helping us will try to be over there like I say the last weekend of January then that had a very very very busy year this year we're so thankful the Lord all the things he done on the field and and continuing to do and I got the schedule comin if the snow don't Hendricks will be every weekend between here in Juneau and and but it's nice to see you folks this morning good to be back in the little church today and we we just we just thank the Lord for so many things there be so many thing I had time would fail me to testify all the things that God has done over the last just a few weeks but I was privileged to see just the other day a friend of mine as a girl actually Court in the years before Samantha and I even started talking and she got out in the world and she got county away from the Lord and just the other Sunday just when we was preaching and she was in church and she'd had a real hard life and lot of things going on and watch the Holy Spirit just bring her restore right back there in the churches the other night and so you know it's nice to see these things and like I say time would fail us to tell you everything but you know just I don't want you to realize that you folks that pray for our little ministry it's certainly going before the throne of God and we're hearing and seeing results out of those things so you y'all keep praying for us will you and now we love you very much you've always been very kind to us and supported us and helped us and pray for us and brother Smith has always been so good the openness pulpit up and have us come by and preach and we love y'all for that and thank you all for that appreciate not only the ministry part

old I can't sing or preach those idols do I hold what can I do for I want to my part and I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I see [Music] [Music] [Music] falling on your name something [Music] and my friend you may not be a singer you may not be a preacher you may not be looked at as anything great in your local community people may look at you and just thank all just a regular old guy but I want you to realize something this morning that if you're a part of God's great economy and you got the Holy Ghost this morning all you got to do is lift your eyes up to heaven and say father I have a need this morning father we've got trouble in our home we got problems at work we need your grace we need your strength you know my Bible told me and if a man will call upon his name he will hear from heaven and he can pray he can talk to God and God promised that he would hear the words coming out of his mouth I wonder this morning would you be able to say but then I've got a need this morning I guess something in my heart something I need from God I wonder if you raised your hand this morning to say I'm testifying right now I believe if I pray God can hear my prayers hallelujah [Music] just hold your need there now [Music] I matter what the devil sticks in the seedlings calling that stopping i I can't pray even if I fear it I can even if doubts are swirling around I look [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you Jesus till there's healing all around that's something I can do oh yes you can do that's good I want you to know you can prove me all you gotta do is pray and Jesus Jesus will heal until the walls come down until there's healing all around that's something I do yes I can [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you Lord bless His Holy Name can we stand together this one bless His Holy Name aren't you glad you can pray amen it's become quite a bit more real to me over the last few weeks and just little things God let you go through you know sometimes you kind of wonder about life and how things go sometimes you know and sometimes you do doubt wonder and sometimes you have a lot of curiosities but we have a real promise this morning take heart Church take courage if you pray you'll hear your prayers I believe that you've got your Bible Luke chapter 13 verse 27 and then I want to pick up Matthew 12 and 21 I want to take two places this morning the Lord helping us pardon me pardon me and the Lord giving us the strength to get through as much of this message this morning as we can get through I want to try to get as much in as I can and I'm not going to be lengthy now but I'm just going to try to try to get it in and I I teased you about preaching long and then and then I only preached about an hour and ten minutes after all their singing and everything so really I know that long but anyhow we we want to try to take for a thought this morning and I I may have used this here a number of years ago even if the over at the old building but I've kind of given an update a reboot and slap some new paint on the walls and give it a little renovation and and and it's really been a blessing to me over the last several weeks that I've been bringing this and I want to use the subject now if you recognize this that I've preached this before it's a different thought but the same title I'm just going a different direction with it and that is the fear of being rejected and the joy of being accepted the fear of being rejected and the joy of being accepted some of y'all might recognize that I think I preached that several number of years ago way back but we we were going a different way with it and and I like oh brother jewel Forney you know he's an evangelist he's not a pastor and so he'll go somewhere and say this is part four of a sermon serious I think it's something like that I like that but anyhow Luke 13 verse 27 now what I want to do for the first scripture is I want to take the negative side of this okay and I want to look at the rejection part and then let's read Matthew 12 21 for the positive side which is the joy of being accepted now Luke 13 27 now notice these words you shall say I tell you I know you not whence ye are depart from me all you workers of iniquity now the word for depart here is to draw away to cause to withdraw to remove to withdraw from one or to fall away now you'll notice that terminology fall away this is what Paul spoke of when he said in the last days there would be a great falling away and that's what we've seen in the hour we're living is a falling away now Matthew 12 21 now here comes the positive side of this or the joy the first was the fear and now the joy now let's look at this Matthew 12 21 short little scriptures here I'll let you be seated just a moment and you can get settled in and we're gonna really dig deep in this the Lord helping us this morning and I just want to try to take a couple of these verses like this hold your Bible by you now because we're gonna go we're gonna go through several places this morning god help us like the Bible amen I like it too Matthew 12 21 and in his name shall the Gentiles trust now the meaning of this word trust is things hope for sound familiar to anybody as in Hebrews 11:1 faith is a substance of things hoped for so our faith must be married to hope in order to be profitable fruitful faith alone don't do it hope alone don't do it you must marry the two together in order to produce the results that faith will bring now let's ask the Lord to help us if you will bow your heads with me just a moment and you've already raised your hands Satan to the Lord this morning during the song that you had a need and now we want to ask the Lord to recognize those needs if we can my hands up to Lord Jesus we love you so much we counted a privilege to be standing here and what I read your prophets say the other day the feeding place this is the Shepherd's spot where not a man now but Lord your prophet said you come to this place to feed your hungry sheep how we love you how we adore you and Lord Jesus as we come before the presence and the throne of God today we do so in the name of Jesus Christ and we're asking you Lord to recognize every need amongst this body may the Holy Spirit we pray give to us what we are asking for out of the depths of our heart God to grant to us the desires of our heart and greater than all things as we seek first the kingdom of God we pray that you will add to our lives the very revelation of yourself and ourselves as a part of this great truth of the last day how we love you we thank you for this little body may you speak to us and recognize every uplift at hand this morning as we come to the word now we're asking that you'll anoint us and that you'll speak through us and receive through us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the saints of God said a man you may be seated may the Lord bless you real good now I want to I want to just introduce to you for a moment so I take my jacket off amen a fella can't work and eat in a jacket I'm gonna be working you're gonna be eating a manís way it goes now just you just to kind of bring this in a little bit about this rejection part first now what I want to point your attention to on this rejection is not necessarily life rejection or people rejection or Church rejection and we all experience those type of things to one degree or another but this rejection is on the level of between you and God and we can speak about different types of rejections such as you know say a college student trying to get into a certain college they send them what they call a rejection letter maybe a man would ask a woman to marry him and she would reject his offer to her marriage and his proposal say trying to do certain things in life file for a grant or patent item and somebody reject now those type of rejections they have emotional responses of course but this type of rejection is something that lays even deeper in the hearts of man and woman it goes even deeper than just necessarily an emotional response but this is a awareness if you will of a spiritual rejection from God and when a person reaches this place of depart as we read there in Luke 13 verse 27 about depart from me now this word depart which is fall away it points us to an understanding that those that will quote-unquote fall away now this is not what we would say every day misgivings and ups and downs and turmoils of life but this departing here is those that are referenced in Hebrews chapter 6 where Paul tells us that they'll come right up to the border taste of the powers of the world to come partake of heavenly gifts and gift the Holy Spirit and then of course fall away from that place of going even further into the blessings of God or into their position as a believer and we realize that this group of individuals that fall away the Bible said very clearly that there was no way that they could renew themselves unto repentance because now they become guilty of crucifying the effects of the gospel to their lives as you see friends many people can crucify Jesus stand and crucify Jesus at crucifixion and you know mock him and pulled his beard many of them stood there and done such things but a greater crucifixion has taken place in the last hours than what took place on Golgotha there was only a small population of people that was gathered around the Israelites and the different ones and you know was responsible for putting Jesus to death by capital punishment but an even greater crucifixion has taken place than what that was because not only was it maybe the thousands that was gathered on the hillside that day or those that would go up to see the criminals just like we would pass by a jail cell or see police cargo bias they would be passing by Golgotha they'd see the men hanging in the tree there might have been you know might have been maybe ten thousand people will say that would view Jesus and these criminals hanging there on guard off the hill but you imagine since that hour coming to the last hours when the full word has been restored to the body of believers not just thousands of people but untold millions has crucified the Lord Jesus again the effects of the Lord Jesus by crucifying the gospel today and realized Mother ma'am indicted this generation in 1963 and brought an indictment to the whole world and it goes spans for the entire generation as a crucifixion those that have crucified Him out of the churches and you realize that as leaders will stand up in the platform and maybe take an individual that believes you know a certain certain way of looking at the supernatural and maybe he doesn't allow the supernatural to operate in its full abilities and what more and then when you come ask him about it show him a scripture he said oh we don't believe that today that was for another time well in that very respect they have put to death the effects of the Lord Jesus again rightfully they have crucified again right there in the house of God any church that Noah kill the gifts any church that will kill the prayer life or kill Revelation or a moving or a flow of the Spirit of God that church is guilty of crucifying the effects of the gospel now in an individual's life it's very much the same way take an individual for example a person that will hear the gospel in some manner that individual has a choice that they can make either they can believe the Lord forgive me or they can trust in the Lord that can have some kind of a confidence in the Lord and allow the Lord Jesus to move in their life and a great degree or they can crucify Paul said Hebrews six the effect of that word in their life and how do we do that when Ram tells us in greatest battle ever fought 1962 how that a person by taking the channel of reasoning can actually shut off or paralyze the effects of the gospel in their life did you realize that you can put brakes deity by disbelief you can put brakes on deity by pulling back your own wheel your own way your own thoughts and what more and placing that before the word so a person could reject the presence of the Lord and ultimately be rejected by God now let's just understand something right now oh really it's not the Lord so much rejecting them as much as it is them that is rejecting the Lord because you see brother God will give you every opportunity Jesus will give you every opportunity to serve God in that right he will allow you to serve Him to live for him to rise to all these untold levels and unseen levels of grace and mercy if you will allow him to do it but what stops God has nothing to do with you know whether I oh you know our Lord I'm a good Pro none of that none of that kind of stuff really matters when it comes to God he don't look at our goodness he don't look at our our abilities or our ability to achieve you don't look at our brains you don't look at her education level he looks at one thing and one thing only and is that the idea of surrender in our life if we are able to surrender to Him you understand that to be a Christian means you've got to learn how to surrender to God it does not come by study it does not come my prayer you can pray every day and every night and fail to surrender and your prayers are meaningless that's right it all comes down to surrender so when he says here depart from me all ye that work iniquity I remember the people that he's referring to here are not individuals with ups and downs in everyday life these are those that have fallen away or crucified the effects of the gospel in their life now if you have your Bibles let's turn to first John chapter 2 verse 28 now as you're taking notes I see pens and pencils out which is good I want to give you some articles that I'm going to use or themes if you will that I'm going to use to kindly lay out the tracks of this message you know driving down the road you got milepost to kind of tell you about where you are well I'm gonna give you some milepost this morning to go by and some of these phrases and phraseology is that I'm gonna give to you they're not things I read out of Hagee's book or Osteen or knew these other guys these are things I just put together while I was praying and studying the mess it's now I want to just give you my first article now this is what we're gonna look at on this fear of being rejected and this joy of being accepted first and that is this we must have confidence in him to hear our prayers that's article number one we must have confidence in him to hear our prayers now that in itself is a gigantic thing I mean I just literally handed you a mountain and asked you to climb up it without a man no climbing gear you ain't got no cleats on you ain't got nothing but by the grace of God I believe that if we can learn that have a confidence about Jesus hearing our prayers because you see this we're gonna read in just a moment that God can give us the ability to believe and give us the confidence to believe that he can give us our answer to our prayers or give us our desires or ever what you want to say we believe God can make these things happen if brother Jesse we will work according to the outline if you will or the law of which prayer works by let's remember this is not blab it and grab it name it and claim it come on somebody hey man this is not I'm just gonna ask God and he's going to give it to me no matter what just like the electricity works in this room this morning amen you have to have a current you have to have a certain flow you couldn't take the electricity and push it down a little pipe like water goes if the current won't carry you couldn't take a piece of round wood and run electricity through that wood and get the current to carry it there's a law there is a mechanism and there's a law that brings that electricity of these lights you don't think so just get you a little wire clipper and go up there and cut one of them wires and to flip your switch on and on and on and see if the light ever comes on and remember that's the way it is with prayer we can pray and pray and pray and pray and pray flip flip flip flip flip on off on off on off but if we're not working according to the law of God the prayer cannot be answered now we must have confidence in him to hear our prayer said hey man now watch this in first John chapter 2 verse 28 now just take this beginning part if you will on little children everybody see that and now little children right here this first little part right here children now that word children if you'll stop for just a moment and think that word children put in the Bible there that's not just placed in there as we'd say for filler that's not just words that John use to throw in there just to occupy space or make it sound flower tea now that's regular writing I mean when we're writing books or whatever we're trying to write or dissertations or thesis or whatever you know we put in little words to make it pretty and make it sound good and all that but remember the Bible is wrote in a manner that it is inspired by the Holy Spirit and so when he says children there is a purpose and a meaning behind that word not a meaning like what I would choose if I said you know a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Amen like the Disney movie there's a purpose behind him nonsensical words there's a purpose if I was to say you know retrogressive or if I used a word like pneumatology have you don't even know what I mean talking about a meant but some of them words they have meanings behind them they have thoughts behind those words that people are using those terms to convey a message well when you read the Bible you're not looking at a man's thought behind the word hallelujah but you're looking at God's thought behind that word praise the Lord when God says children there's a meaning behind that word hey man and what is that children same as Jesus said in the Lord's Prayer our Father I like what Spurgeon said one time he said well when he said our Father he said our he said meaning that it wasn't just Jesus saying I have a father but he was saying we have a father and if we have a father then there must be children for that father to be called father by so if it is children then that means that we are not just here by happenstance get that through your mind you are not just here because you're a product of your mother and father but you are here amen with a divine purpose from Almighty God there's a reason you can say Amen little children when he says little children that means that you're a believer at every stage it means there's a child of God there's not a speck of doubt on the inside of me there can't be if there is I'm not a child huh because if I'm born again and I am a child of God then that means I'm a believer God has confirmed my hey by saying you've got the Holy Ghost I'm saying I am a believer 100 percent there not one IOT this off not one not one I believe 99.99% that little bit caused all that death but if you're a child if you're talking about child is the Bible that means everything there's not a spot there's not a wrinkle there's not nothing in your faith it's perfect before God now friends that ought to encourage you and if you listen to me close this morning you're going to think it in your life and you go to looking back on different things you've done and ways you've acted and things you've said and I trust as you go back through there and the devil tries to point you to areas in your life where you've done this that or the other and try to tell you you're a doubter and you don't believe I just want you to point that old ugly face thing to this little word up here children this morning put it right back on him and say if I am a child of God then I am a believer no matter what doubt may creep in my mind no matter what fears may attack me no matter how I may get weak in my human faith if I am a child I am a believer in every stage of my walk with God I love to say this sister Wendy at no time have I ever been an unbeliever once I was a child once I was born at no time have I ever been an unbeliever Amen there not a website powerful enough to pull me out come on somebody him a man there are not enough big preachers to fall and take the name of Jesus Christ off their churches they ain't enough men running off with piano players and deacons running off with Trustees wives or not they never that just stopped me from serving God I'm a believer at every stage of my walk with God hallelujah oh you say but it's bad is bad yes it might be bad for the world but remember the world is sealed out if you're a child and Christ is sealed in hallelujah all but you see all the surround me I know that surround me but if I am a child I am hid away with Jesus Christ in a secret place oh praise the Lord and hallelujah amen if that'll make you shout or shout you're shot he's broken a man I'm glad you come to church get it fix a little bit now watch this little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have but confidence don't don't miss that little word right there because if you break it up just a little bit what do you see confide now there's a secret behind this word the word confidence as it appears here in the Bible and also in different translations of this would say firm trust boldness is another one of these meanings perfect way moves translation says have a perfect confidence in him oh I know I'm turning you upside down already ain't I because in your mind you they met all the times that Jane trusted the Lord like you should but remember we're not talking about what takes place in this flesh we're talking about what's in that soul and that soul if it's sealed by God there's nothing can shake it Amen we either believe the Bible or we don't the Bible said once you're sealed with the Holy Spirit you're sealed in the day of your Redemption there's no way I can escape this there's no way it can escape me if I am a part of this then I am confident that God can do what he promised all right now watch another meaning to this word I love this here it means to speak fearlessly woo glory not getting that begging mode you're now putting some people are and they getting start talking to God they start that begging thing oh god oh god oh god I'm a worm I don't don't don't talk about God's property like it's trash because of God saved you you're not a worm you're not scum you're not even a sinner anymore if you're saved come on somebody people hallo I'm a sinner saved by grace I was a sinner but if I'm born again I'm not a sinner anymore I may live in a sinner's body but I am NOT a sinner the real me I am NOT a sinner anymore Amen I am justified as though I never did it in the first place that's what brother Branham taught us hey you say watch brother Brandon what about the Bible Paul use the same word justified it means you cannot lay an accusation to those that have never done any wrong amen that's what I am I'm justified if I've got the Holy Ghost I have a fearlessness I got a boldness I can walk right up before and say god I've got a need and I am I like this meaning of this word confidence also means to speak without concealment now remember our heart there's many doors as one door to comes in the church here you get a door there door yonder door yonder your honor yonder yonder yonder in the human heart there's one way that we can let Jesus in comes through the mind our eyes our ears all of that attached to our mind it opens up the channel let Jesus come in his word comes and hits our ears or hits our mind or our thoughts or whatever you want to say and and as all of this is entering into us there's all kinds of doors on this inside of the human heart that have to be looked at now the one thing about being a Christian that I want you to remember is that in order for him to truly be Lord he can be your Savior but in order for him to be your Lord there can't be any concealment of any doors in your heart I must say something as young people sitting here I want them to hear this as a minister we need to be we need to be transparent with all of us one thing you're going to find as you grow up around the ranks of this message you gonna find out one reason people in the shape they in is because they still got cupboards and drawers and doors and closets and all kinds of stuff that they never opened up to God to let him get in and dig it all out and make it right I my are my favorites preachers deacons trustees lowliest housewife the littlest ragpicker I don't care what they are might be a trashman you're gonna find the reason that people aren't further along than what they are is because deep within their guts deep in their hearts they've never allowed the Lord Jesus to go right down in every door and drawer and cupboard in their house and do a clean job on the inside and you remember he can't give you the Holy Ghost until he's out of access to every part of you that's why the part of this confidence is the ability to be able to confide in him to be able to speak without concealment so when you walk before the throne of grace as you walk out before the throne you ought to be able to bear yourself open to God and say every drawer is yours every closet every door my life is yours you take over and do what you want to do you understand that in order for a person to really be right with God you cannot conceal not one place in your heart you can't do it it's a friend of mine told me a number of years ago I was preaching to some of the people about you know receiving the Holy Ghost and I like what he said he said you realize that if you got a temper on the inside of you he said you realize if God sealed you where the Holy Ghost with that temper on the inside of you you'd have that temper through eternity because whatever God seals in there it's sealed to the day of your Redemption so God's got to get all of that out of your heart before he can place the seal of God on you now I realize I rise we could preach sanctification going up through the steps of the virtues in the pyramid we go inside upside down what I'm talking about is I'm talking about before God can actually move on your heart and he can do all three stages justification application baptized Holy Ghost in a moment's time it depends on what your will and they're not concealed it depends on what you're willing to open up before him I'm not talking bout running to the altar 30 times in every youth camp I'm talking about being able to open up your heart said right here in the house of God open up your heart say Here I am Lord take over let me tell you when God sees that out of a person's life it don't take a month it takes moments and God can do things in less than a moment than we could take me years to do what he can do in just a few seconds time because he's got the ability to move upon our heart now if everything on the inside of me is open then and I can confide in him or pray then whatsoever we ask now we're looking down here let's just pick up 1st John chapter 3 now verse 20 and and and pull this down just a little bit now for if our heart condemn us not the word he uses for condemn there is present in sincerity and what that means is that when a person let's just say that you've allowed something to come in now all of us have served the Lord we know when we mess up I mean there there ain't no two three ways about it you know when you've blown it and when you've fallen flat on your face wham-o you know it ain't nobody got to tell you you don't need a sermon or an article you know what your own conscience declares to you that you've messed up nah you don't even have to have the Holy Ghost for that your own conscience will let you know when you do wrong how do you think the world turns God away he convicts their heart without the Holy Ghost he convicts their heart and convicts them a sin using their own conscience letting them know what is right and wrong you were bet to know the difference between the two don't think so go back to the Garden of Eden look see what tree you was born off of he was born off the tree to no good from evil every man a woman without the Holy Ghost they don't need a church service their own conscious declares to him what's good and what ain't that's why brother Branham could look out of nature and see God out of nature and go out and pin a letter to the tree trying to find God out there because his own conscience let him know God was out there somewhere now that's why as a boy even though I was raised in the message I look up to the Stars and try to figure out where God was hiding it behind one of them stars maybe because in my conscience I knew there's a God and I was trying to contact him hallelujah amen so if our heart condemn us that's present in sincerity remember the bread told lie and had to go make it right about the baby and I went to go pray for the Lord told him he wasn't fit to pray for the child and had to go back and fix that light well that was present in sincerity now watch I love this now he's talking about children now these are these are children of God these aren't just anybody but if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart so they're not a speck of guilt they're not a boo-boo they're not a oh never a mess-up that God is not greater than on the inside of your heart you say well man I I don't know I this feels like a madness setting on me God is greater than that he's greater than your heart greater than that feeling greater than that guilt and knoweth all things you see this is why he can rightly just and and decide and cast judgment on our situations because he knows the hearts the only thing that's kept me alive all of these years is God knows what's inside of my heart it certainly had been because of my depth or my experience in preaching they got nothing to do it that I've spent my life in the pulpit but I'm a knucklehead let me tell you God knows my heart come on somebody amen and fellow knuckleheads holler a man a man a man we all do we all fellas in the same ship come on we've all got these little things on that way we're in little ways that we do but God is greater than our heart and knows all things he knows exactly what's laying on the inside of me and you and he understands what it's like that's why when you come to church or you're trying to live a Christian life and you make some kind of a mistake don't beat yourself up day and night if you didn't mean to do it don't you think God knows that but we remind him of it a thousand times a day oh god I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry look I get it I get it when we get upset and we lose our temper whatever we do we want to let the Lord know how sincere we are but always remember he knows what's in your heart you say what does this got to do with having confidence in him here in my prayers how you gonna pray right if you don't have confidence that God knows what's really real and true hmm you say well I I pray I ask him I talked to him I'm already straightened out yeah that right there is usually the first sign that you ain't because a real child of God they're always struggling and fighting for the next rung on the ladder they're always looking for the next step in Christ come on don't get quite on me right they're always looking for the next element of what God's going to do and how he's going to do it and whatsoever we ask now watch this it love it if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence same word toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight now let's pick up 1st John chapter 5 now verse 14 and 15 now look here 1st John 5 14 and 15 and this is the confidence same word that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will all so not just a asked for asking sake but asked according to his will because he realized this is where a lot of people get in trouble right here well I asked God to do it and he didn't even listen to me did you ask him according to his will or did you even bother to find out if it was words a man in case some y'all forgot it did we even stop to say now father is this your mind should I go this way should I do this what should I do you tell me and I'll do it how did you say the time we just will have it and grab it name it clear ass getting that God I want it but what if God would say no the question is then if I'm asking according to his will he hears me but what if he don't want to do it don't as soon as I sees where we get in trouble because we look at God like an errand boy God is greater than your heart he's no errand boy he does what he wants to do it's not me trying to get him and persuade him to do things for me it's for me to persuade myself to stay in the center of God's will to keep me lined up and doing what I should do come on now preach to me not just walk around say oh well whatever it be and well I just ask God for it it'll be that way you could ask God day and night it's just like when a father and his kids come running up or in they're in a store you know daddy I want daddy I want daddy I want we just kind of brush them off it's cuz we don't want them to have it we know they've done got 4738 little dolls and they ain't played with one I'm the second I get the clothes all pulled off one they throw them in the floor and that's it we know they're not interested in another toy they're just a kid so what do you do as a father you just kind of push them up no no no that's why Jesus says us sometimes we will holler and holler oh god oh god oh god and sometimes you said freeze cop we said not my lord really so you've got biblical evidence to prove that God answers every prayer do you well let's look at Paul can we because paul asks God again and again and again that word thrice er actually doesn't mean three times it actually means again and the and again and again again and again again and when Paul kept asking God finally just shook his head and said Paul I said no woo preach to me that now that's a hard thing for us to receive because we look at God as almost like some kind of a spiritual cash cow whatever I want I get only if it is according to his will friends and you ought to be thankful to God and I should be to that the God doesn't always answer every prayer you prayed how many ears ever prayed that they should quit so all of your liars and so we need to preach online come on now how many ever said I'll just give up Lord I just want to quit I just get me out of this mess now you may not call that prayers but when you're talking to him you are praying aren't you glad that Jesus never answered that prayer for you what if he looked down said okay I'll grant it to you what if it was almost like the Christmas story about It's a Wonderful Life maybe the man you can marry he asked God to let him not ever be born and then he sees his whole life of not being born and what kind of effect what if God would treat you the same way that the first time you got discourages I just cannot Gus it okay done now how often do you think you really get victory in your life if it was that way we've used quite as a Methodist this morning come on well I'm trying to show you brother is that if we have confidence in him to hear our prayers we must know it's got to be according to the will of God it's not according to the will of God then God doesn't hear the Bible said so right there in front of your face and thank God he doesn't thank God he doesn't hear and answer every prayer now notice why then of course the question is and well why would I be afraid when it comes to praying well it's very simple rejection often we don't want to say this out loud a lot of times but often we're kind of afraid that if we ask God for something he's going to reject us and we may not say that loud but deep in our heart that's part of the fear of this the fear of being rejected we are afraid that if we ask our lost of the times in paralyzed mother Jessie around the world that people have come to me and they have not asked me for a deep I have very few that come and say I will you pray for me that the Lord have helped me understand the Fasil I need your prayers that I can figure the thunders out rather beyond I've been struggling this week with the anointing once at the end time could you please pray that God will help me get through that very few have I ever had I've had a few I'm asked me to pray for revelations and things like that but very few usually when they come up it's always the same type of theme again and again and again I don't know if God's hearing me I prayed and asked him Lord I'm just not sure he's listening oh brother that ought to guide us as ministers into the realm of where people are really living at it's not the depth of the bulk of Revelation that many of them struggle if it's this it's this they just don't know if God is listening to them when they pray they're just not confident please but we must have confidence in him to hear our prayer so if I follow this formula the lights are come on do you walk up to a light switch and flip it and go boy I hope man I hope now you walk up to the light switch and you have two things that are operational functional within your spirit first of all you know if you flip the switch you have confidence and expectation the light is going to come on seconds you've got faith or you can say first or so first a second which everyone will order them up and that faith inside of your heart is you know that switches operate lights you know that but your expectation is when you flip the switch lights come come on so faith and hope have to be married together well what if your hope is fear faith and fear cannot coexist so I've got to know when I flip the switch God's gonna answer that light he's gonna bring the lights on and don't forget children of God and I will call your children cuz the Bible just did here a few moments ago but remember what he said hallelujah in the last days of the hour we're living in the darkest hour it's ever been he said there is a man here who can turn on the light blue glory to cops oh not we're gonna have a revival right here in this one and keep talking that way now notice again I want to give you this next of this next order next article which is God will accept our repentance based upon the sincerity of our heart and not the markings of our body now I want to read this quote how the faithless son of God you remember that state of that young man in Memphis Ibrahim went and visit he had the social disease of the low mammy out by the gate and he's reading to the I'm reading to you now from a quotation where he's talking to the boy and sad talked to him for a little while and I said some would you become a Christian and he said I want to brother branham I'm afraid that God won't receive me I have been so sinful now notice brother brems answer to him oh yes he will oh yes sir he will receive you you think he would take me and a disease like this what I've got there's got the equivalent of what we'd say like AIDS or he's got syphilis or gonorrhea or some kind of a social disease sexually transmitted disease and here this young man in the presence of this prophet of God trying to come before the presence of the Lord has feared that God will not receive him because of the deeds that has been done in his body now I read this and I placed this article before you because in talking about confidence before God and the joy of being accepted then we must realize that the fear of being rejected it cannot be upon the basis of okay I've been molested I've been raped I've been a drug addict I've been an alcoholic I've done this I smoked cigarettes for years and now I'm coming to the Lord you know I've always wondered about these characters I see out on the field you know but I'm travel out yonder and they got big gauges in their ears like this and they've got tattoos all over their forehead and I saw one guy with tattoos over his eyelids the other day and somebody sent me a picture sometime ago of a fella that was being conformed into a lizard had little bumps and things put up around his eyes he looked like a lizard in his face had his tongue split in half and I thought you know what would happen if those individuals ever got the Holy Ghost and you mean you think a preacher's tire swings around what would you think gages in the mirror lobe just going around while they were shouting and praising the Lord now for many of us we would look at people like that and we would say there is no way at all I could receive somebody like that but remember it God is not receiving you based upon the marks done in the body but on the sincerity of your hearts hallelujah now that ought to give you a confidence to know God hears your prayers okay if you got tattoos all over your body I think a brother Steve Delaney whenever I heard his testimony the first time and he said I would take my shirt off and show you but I'm embarrassed of it he said got tattoos all over my body and I thought about how people in the message probably would receive that brother Jesse I got to think about that one day and I preached a message called the woman at the wells first day at church I thought about how it would look like whenever that priest should be standing there that not priest but that you know that that preacher's standing there in the synagogue you know they put the women up on a platform like this and the men on the floor and the women in the balcony and here he is and Moses said and Moses said and Moses said in Moke and there's a woman of the whale sitting up in that balcony I wonder what some of them how they would have reacted what a lot of scum like that doing there it's not the same attitude that people have about former sinners coming into the house of God they look at them based on the look of their body but remember God does not bring salvation because of your good works or how you look or how you don't look but you are saved by grace and faith alone hallelujah to God you are not saved because you are good because you are clean because you are pure if that was the case you would not need salvation but God saved you because you could not save yourself hallelujah so the essence of a real child of God all praise be to God it's not upon the marks done in the body but the sincerity of their hearts I don't care if he's a homosexual or she's a homosexual okay what kind of lifestyle they live when they come to Jesus he'll receive them on the sincerity of their heart praise God now let's look at my next article here this morning and that is we must believe that he has our best interest in his mind this was a tough one for many of us but I want to show you this using Ephesians chapter 3 verse 12 now just just if you'll look here at this scripture for just a moment and make sure you kindly put a little star next to this one this would be a goodie to keep keep around for a little while now watch this Ephesians three and twelve now we must have confidence we must know that he has our best interest in his heart all right Peter chapter three verse 12 Paul said in whom we have boldness and access and confidence by the faith of him did you notice how we get there not by our faith let me let you know something right now your faith don't amount to a hill of beans if you're gonna get right with God it's his faith that gets you here hey man I feel like shouting not my faith not by works of what I've done but what God has done through me and for me it's very very simple if you let him do it he'll do it huh if you'll let him do it he'll do it 90% of the time friends the things that don't happen in our lives they don't happen because we offer resistance that we're flipping the switch flipping the switch and then we're also trying to stop the current the lights gonna come on in like Harlow I don't want it that way you get it exactly the way he wants you to have it this is his program not mine so I live by the faith of the Son of God come on now Oh glory to God so if we have boldness we also have that boldness remember was confidence there and with boldness and also we have access all of this the meaning of this word simply if I could just put it in plain terms it'd be like coming to the church this morning okay I welcome everybody into this church we say I welcome you welcome to the house of the Lord right brother Jesse we welcome it all right welcome to the house of God now that's wonderful as long as you're willing to behave yourself libram said you stick around long as you want to long as you're willing to behave but now there's a difference in that listen close then if I say welcome to the house of God or if I look and say but I welcome you everybody's welcome but that's a different invitation and that's a different greeting than me saying but I welcome you so Jesus will allow everybody to have access to faith at some point in their life they have access to be able to believe God under righteousness but we're going a step further than just believing God under unto righteous unto Him going under the piano under the chair unto righteousness we are believing God even deeper than that meaning that whenever we come before him with the right attitude the right thoughts the right spirit and everything else he doesn't just say welcome but he says I welcome you not just you are welcome but I welcome you Oh glory to God there's a big difference between the two a person's may be welcome to stay under the general call remember the general call was go to the world and preach the gospel everybody can have a chance to be saved but not everybody is welcomed into the grace of God fully remember only the bride can truly repent truly repent fully repent because repentance brings the Holy Ghost not everybody will get the Holy Ghost fullest version those have been good to the Brethren oh no no no no it'll be many of them to the tribulation had been saved I never had the Holy Ghost well that's what he said oh I know Russ bus bride elite people we don't believe anybody's gonna make it into heaven but us bride people let me tell you God's got a whole economy that ain't never heard the name William Graham yet now if you want to be bride that's where you got to come of course that's where rap shouldn't face that we're talking about rapturing faith is a whole different category all together yes but Debbie branches that in the general call go say welcome whoo never will remember the bride is not whosoever will her name was on the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world there's a difference and a general call to the whole world and then him saying but I welcome you this is what this word access means he actually grants us I welcome you into my kingdom glory to God oh thank you Lord so then if I have been welcomed in then we must remember that he has our best interest at heart why would he welcome us and give us a formal welcome if he didn't have the best thoughts for us in mind do we honestly believe that the reason God put us in the kingdom of God is so you can make fun of his tormentors and treats like circus monkeys sometimes I believe that's the way some people treat Christianity almost like God's playing tricks on him and trying to be mean to him he doesn't do those things friends that's the carnal mind at play Oh hallelujah come on now preach to me a little bit now watch here in Hebrews chapter 3 now if you wanna write two stanzas verses five and then 12 through 14 and Paul simply said that you know we said take heed brethren verse 12 if there be any in your heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God that we exhort one another daily wide is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin and then he says before we were made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end so the reason that some people don't last to the end is because they lose their confidence they quit believing that God has the best interest in mind for them but he does absolutely does now my next article here is we cannot draw back from him amen you all see that that's hebrews chapter 10 and verse 38 and 39 Paul said the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him now the word he uses here for draw back is timid shrink or conceal remember what I said a few moments ago that when you come for him with confidence confidence means you don't conceal any area of your life but this person drawing back is concealing timid shrink I've seen him do that in churches you know whenever you start preaching in there tater patch I've seen him actually hide behind the person in front of them to keep me from making eye contact with them usually when that happens I go get in the aisle where they're standing I go get on the I'll go stand on the bench next to them if I got to stand up in the seat I'll get up next to them and look at my eyeball to eyeball I figure if you're in church they're not here to hide anyhow praise the Lord so the Lord draw back it means to be timid now you remember what brother I'm someone to be calling somebody in a prayer line and the Holy Spirit will be hovered over that person and they wouldn't answer quickly so uh you're gonna miss it he said now see you have to answer quickly he said because the Holy Spirit is timid when he goes to move he wants you to respond back not in a timid way Lord I'm not so sure I had just Greaves always ready just jumps away okay if you're not gonna believe me then I'll just move so Paul said such a man God will have no pleasure in him and brother you realize it's not the sins of things you commit sometimes it's the sin of neglection things that you fail to do that God has told you to do oh praise the Lord can you say Amen right so sometimes then we have to understand that we've got to be verse 39 not verse 38 which 39 is we are not of them who draw back unto perdition look at this draw back in other words this isn't people just got scared or got you me worried or intimidated or they bowed down to pressure or they you know they they just they just misstep somehow but these are people that have drawn back unto perdition other words they have so moved away from the Holy Spirit God I want nothing to do with it timid shrink or conceal now you realize when brother Adam said in the last days that Ananias and Sapphira would return you realize that is the theme of Ananias and Sapphira life in the book of Acts they were concealing theft because God told them but out there and sell all your goods and distribute among everybody equally you you realize that that principle may not apply to us down here and lady OC yeah but at the time in order to propagate the gospel in the kingdom of God they were dividing severally amongst the brethren and the sister so that there could be equity among all of them they were trying to make sure that the saints were cared for praise the Lord that there wasn't beggars on the street that the gospel could propagate on this day we're living in it may not be the same way but it should be the same attitude that if I have an abundance I should be willing to give to you and that's not just money all the time that's wisdom that's advice that's experiences do you know how many people in this church alone just this little group of people right here do you have any understanding how much of a wealth of experience is sitting right here in this building right now think about the experiences you've had alone just you things that you could share with these young men and women things little pitfalls in life this is one reason I believe churches so to have testimony meetings from time to time now I don't know how you operate here but I mean in general the Church of the Lord we should be able to testify and share our experiences other people but folks are so timid sometimes they conceal things they don't want to share nothing with nobody I've seen brethren oh I don't want to talk to people because you know people talking to get on Facebook and it might come back to me well yeah I understand that but if God has given me a wealth of experience I'm gonna rack it y'all at both ends and I'm gonna tell people what I know some people so what one guy said to me said you just talk all the time don't shy said you know it's funny ain't nobody ever gets mad at a basketball player for dribbling the ball either get mad at preachers for talkin totally being called to do praise the Lord yeah how much experience could we share with somebody how many personal things that we've been through could we turn around and tell somebody else about it sure that we might have equity amongst the entire body I realize you sweep your steps and I'll sweep mine but don't forget we're we're also together as one Accord in one body we should be of one mind be looking to help other people and be able share our experiences of the people and Isis safar wasn't people like that now we realize when those days return we're looking for somebody to fall dead in the church let me tell you them days are already here people are concealing goodness they're concealing a wealth of knowledge a wealth of experiences they're concealing their there come on they're hiding it and they're not sharing it with the rest of the body praise the Lord I always get tickled Jesse's a schoolteacher and he's a pastor so it's a double whammy and I you know pastors or rule makers and teachers or rule makers you know and how is get tickling I don't mean this in a negative way I think it's good and it's got the little cleaning instructions back here in the back and I thought that's a good idea sway should be gotta lay it out let my know the roles responsibilities thanks but I get tickled some people how I want to do something for God you got a good strong back what is church got quiet I you we think if we're not given a thousand dollars a week in the tithing plate we ain't done nothing from God just dust in the pews we'll be a good start watch some of these pastors like evangelist like me I kind of help you get some things done and nice and so far ahead that from them from the rest of the body they said we'll take what we got and we'll hold it back do you understand what damage was done because they would not share with the rest of the body of Christ that kept back a part of it for themself how many people might they have hurt and God knew such a thing God knew their attitude and he knew it didn't stop there he knew that the minute that started he's there'd be no end to it that's the reason why he rebuked him when he used Peter to say wives Satan filled your heart to hold back there's a lot of things we hold back as the body of Christ I'll give you another good example when a preachers preach and I'll tell you sod do you want do something for God it wants do something for the Lord in you half of you don't will raise your hand you think I'm gonna get she does it you want to do some for the Lord I'll tell you a good way to do it pull on the word amen and praise the Lord and hallelujah glory to God how many times have we held back our applause or held back our a man's or held back our worship because we're tired or were wore out oh we've had a long week you're doing the same thing in a nice and so far I did you know what it brings it brings spiritual death to the body it hurts the churches because when you have people in a church that aren't interested in participating and all they want to do is be spectators you got one guy up here doing everything and everybody out there enjoying it at least you think they are you hope they are as I'm telling you something some folks man you want to check your pulse when you sit in church come on ah I've seen him sit and look and barely even shake their head barely even hollering man the Lord of God and praise the Lord well y'all think you kept Church for this is the place you're supposed to be able to let loose if you're a Walmart cashier you can't stand out your cash register and say that'll be 498 Laurie God hallelujah you gotta hold it back but the man said so he said you might be cutting up on you some man you can't stand it he said but you don't get out on the street corner in front everybody and carry on what do you think you come to church this is where you come to let loose let off the steam this is where you come to worship God don't be like that and I sin so far and hold back you're a man in your praise in your Halloween causes death in the church sure does it kills it kills the preacher it kills the atmosphere at kill I've seen people in the song service barely moving they just think you want to get up underneath them see bruising breath coming out and why because they're holding something back God don't want you holding anything back amen he wants you to be able to stand out there or the promise of God don't be timid don't straight don't conceal yourself come to the house of the roast of God Here I am I need to take my own medicine sometimes sometimes in preaching the gospel hey listen you think it's easy if you think this preach and things easy I advise you come give her a try it's hard you know how it is if you've ever had to give a public speech it feels good when you're sitting back yonder you get up in front of all them eyeballs staring a hole through you sir thank God for a gift and thank God for anointing all right in Timothy to death because whether you realize this or not I'm actually quite a shy person I am I know you wouldn't think of it I just had years of experience of trying to overcome that but I just missed the shower would he raised my head look at people sure and yet God called me to preach before what a joke Lord you are a joker man you're a funny guy God said I ain't jokin get out there and do it alright here we are now what if a man was to say oh I can't do it let me tell you something when the Lord told me to leave Ohio and go to Tennessee I told him no I did I found out six months later you don't tell God know about nothing because my people were Tennesseans and all I never knew about Tennesseans was just my Bunch which was a bunch of gunslingers and drunkards and everything else in the world and I said I'm not going down there around that much trash forget it no boy when he come back around six months later and they asked me so how about it now I said you know I was just kidding that whole time Lord I was just I was just teasing you a little bit I just wanted to see if you was really serious it's amazing how your mind changes but you want trouble just conceal yourself get timid shrink back when the Lord ask you to do something whoo come on bridge to the church huh sure you mean--you is bold enough to tell god no yeah sure did I was ignorant too brain did almost right now watch this my next article is we cannot be fearful of standing on God's promises right got 55 minutes in coming into an hour now I'm gonna try to get a little spot we'll pick us up this afternoon now watch here he said in Java Jerry said now if Jesus come to this platform he said if you believe you become his platforming these people will produce the same kind of life and do the same things they did on earth will he accept you for all your needs but asked them said will you raise your hand up and said I'll accept it all right the Lord bless you number the Brenham aren't you afraid to make that kind of statement no sir he promised it it's his promise no matter anything contrary to it I say it's a lie a man God said so that settles it again I hear you him someone said brother Branham aren't you afraid no sir just as the Eagle I feel and know the Holy Spirit is here I know that he called me to do this I have not one fear it's his work not mine that's why we've got faith in what we're doing because it's what God has done not what we have done all right so we cannot be fearful of standing on the promises of God and yet we do and yet we are come on don't look at me like a bunch of angels you're super men here in church you get out of this door and you become Clark Kent my time you walk out the door huh I believe you Lord of God and Halliday sure you say that until the pressures on and then when things get rough that's whenever you start shrinking getting timid concealing the matter so well Lord I believe you know if you one of the biggest excuses I hear people make is what God wants it to happen it'll happen what your dough already told me is that you don't believe you can do it as you're just throwing that off on God but you have a responsibility yourself either you have to believe it for yourself that God can do it and that you're standing on the promise of God see that's not a testimony if God wants to do it he can do it the testimony is if I'm going to testify I believe God can do it for me don't know how don't know when don't know how it's gonna show up but I believe God can make it happen when you get that I believe in there now you're making a testimony of what you're saying yeah we live in a society of his expression goes que sera sera as the song went what's whatever will be will be whatever I gotta do he'll do it whatever that's later you'll see it for you right there but God doesn't want someone adjust to whatever it just if it'll happen it'll happen let go let it happen God wants people that are not fearful of standing on the front line out there and saying the doctor said I got cancer but I believe glory to God what God said he's already healed my body and he wants people to stand out on the promises of God why don't we do it fear of rejection we're afraid if we really make a stand that somehow another will miss the mark and be rejected in the end we'll make shipwreck and that's true we should be concerned before we make any kind of a statement or Boulder you know affirmation of any kind we ought to know what we're talking about before we make because the devil is listening to you you know he's paying attention to how these things are being said and what's going on and if you make a proclamation and you really don't believe it the devil is gonna make you it's gonna make you prove it anyhow you said you believed it oh well you better know what you're talking about but once you do know what you're talking about we cannot be fearful of standing on the promises of God all right I'm gonna give you a couple more articles of faith and fear here first I want you to write this down people fear the unknown and people fear mesi know what I mean messy you know what I'm talking about don't you like when you walk into a house and things the kids been cutting up all day long and stuff laying all over the place and I'm gone on messy people fear it they fear messy but as most of you know when you've worked in kind of a job or you've had any kind of a renovation project or like we just prepared on the church here and you had new painting and put a wall out or whatever you had to do most people know that in order for the thing to be done right it's got to get messy first before it can do it that's one reason I believe God set us down here with a mess age because the mess age the message the mess age it brings us into an understanding that God had to splatter the thing to the four winds tear it all the pieces to get it straightened out right don't forget part of Elijah's ministry was to destroy Tara all of these ideas that were contrary to the Word of God so when they put their car together it was office looking thing you ever saw they had the steering wheel in the trunk and I had the trunk on the hood and they had the hood on the wheels and had the wheels in the seat and here comes this prophet of God Elijah and start ripping things out throwing little bolts and nuts and stuff going every which direction it was messy but God required messy in order to get the things straightened out we fear messy we do we're afraid when it's messy that things are going to go wrong actually that's proof of it going right and we fear the unknown we don't know what homes what what the future holds I don't know what the next five minute hold hopefully it's closing I don't know what the next few minutes of my life holds I have no ability to predict tomorrow less God showed me a vision of some sort unless he comes spoke to my heart and said okay and such such time such that's gonna happen go down this road you'll meet so-and-so unless God give me some kind of a foretelling I don't know it's gonna happen the very next seconds of my life that are ahead of me every moment that is ahead of me lays in the hands of God no matter how little or how big and we fear that we fear that unknown element we fear that unknown element it's just like in martial arts I took a little karate Taekwondo when I was a boy and I made it up through a few belts I enjoyed it it was it was good activity and and kept it healthy and all that kind of stuff of course I was in the sports stuff so they put you in these competitions where you guys kicked your head off your shoulders and this is back in the 80s his a long time ago and and I remember one of the instructors walked up I was a little bitty old guy and he put me up against somebody that was my size and I mean when I say my size I mean he was three of me put together than one big dude and I had to I had to knock him down I had to roll his leg up and I had to come over and smack him in the nose of the back of my fist and I had to get him to tap out when I got him in that leg hole and I thought well I don't know if this guy's gonna do to me and my instructor they call him sensei my instructor said to me said son that's the reason we teach you how to fight because the fighting doesn't give you all of the tools exactly my point but it gives you the ability to defend yourself against the unknown and I thought what a good message because that's what God has done with the bride we don't necessarily know how the devil is gonna attack us tomorrow but the word the message the Bible gives us the tools the Holy Ghost low-rate gives us the tools to be able to fight against the unknown I made to God tap out by the way although I think he was just doing that not to hurt my feelings Alleluia now just just just a little moment here amen I want to give you another one here we'll pick this up tonight the future belongs to you how do I know that Saint John chapter 14 verse 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me verse 2 in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you verse 3 and if I prepare a place for you I'll come again receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also well why would he make a future home for me brother Jesse if he didn't plan on giving me a future or to God the devil I tell you you have no future how do you put this in the Word of God then he put it in the word because the bride has a future I don't care what kind of thing you've been through I don't care how bad it's been or how ugly it's been or what somebody said about you and how your past is what all that looks like God give you an evident future and he wants you to look to the future I know I know I know I know I know man's always praising God for what he will do what he did do and Miss and what he's doing I get that but there are elements of your walk with God that has to be tied to expectation there are elements of your faith that has to be tied to an expectation you can believe God all day but if you have no expectation that's going to happen it'll never come to your doorstep you've got to expect it in other words you've got to look to the future of things that are although we're not supposed to look to the Mantegna father tomorrow that's not what Jesus is referring to Jesus is referring to don't make a bunch of plans that you don't know if it's gonna work out that way or not always seek first the kingdom of God in the will of God because when you make plans that's what you want make God laugh you want to tell him a joke tell him your plans God I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do the other be careful when you're making plans because you don't know the will of God for your life so if you take thought for tomorrow you hear them saying to you if you take thought for tomorrow tomorrow must be like this God you know what tomorrow is I'm committing tomorrow to your hands today and whatever you look for me I'm here to let you walk me into that vision remember what he said if you're sick and you want to be well it said catch a vision of a well person and walk until you can step into that vision of that well person there's nothing wrong we're looking to the future but you got to remember the future is not determined by what we want or what we say or what we think the future is determined on what God wants for our lives that's why when Jesus said take no thought for the day suffice the evil in other words what he's saying is I can't say well I'm gonna be a schoolteacher maybe I will maybe I won't I'm gonna be a doctor I don't know maybe I will maybe alone I'm gonna be a lawyer maybe you will maybe you won't take don't take the thought for tomorrow like that wake up tomorrow saying God whatever your will is that's what I want but remember the principle is God's gonna give you a future ever what that future is there's Lord people make plans and their plans aren't necessarily huh maybe what God expects him to be I mean let's just let's just face facts when Martin Luther was standing there in that Catholic Church and he was going through all of his doctors degrees and he was becoming a great man I highly doubt that Martin Luther would have jumped up and realized one day that he'd been sitting out there almost the most hated man in the Catholic Church if he wasn't the hated man I'm sure he never realized that his message of justification would start a Reformation that would sweep the entire globe decide that little spot in Germany down there I'm sure that John Wesley never thought of himself as being much more than just a regular old student of college not knowing that God had made him a star before even realize that he was a son and as he stood out there and God moved on him with the Holy Spirit and showed him the message of sanctification and how to get right with God I'm sure he never realized what his future would be what about brother Branham in this day he said all these branham's I knew he said my branham's they died with their boots on he said none of them was nothing but a bunch of alcoholics and here stands with the Brenham and a leader of the entire generation God made him a great man so if he'd have made plans he'd have been in trouble oh here we go brother Brennan made some plans one time he tells us about it standing in the gap in 1963 he got discouraged because he didn't think people wanted to hear his message and he'd made some plans he was going to go to the woods like a prophet and come out with us say if the Lord is he's gonna go be a trapper up in Him woods and God said if you carry on your plans your wife will leave you Billy won't stay with you it'll ruin everything and God had to give him a picture of what his future looked like he was standing in a trash dump talking about used to be a leader of the bride that's what your plans look like but if you stick with the program God gives you a future he gives you a few Tura cording to his own choosing praise God Oh aren't you grateful to the Lord for it I'm so thankful a man I love this Amen he gives you a future brother mem said like this in future home he said there's a said help us Lord he said there's one that called to this wedding supper the land this thousand years of millennial reign to enter into the city after the honeymoon is over he said the Millennium is merely the honeymoon they said then she the bride the bridegroom will take his bride home it's hers glory her bridegroom his bride love this statement and he's gone to prepare a house since he's become engaged and in one place brother brems said he's right there right now hanging against of that city getting it ready for you and I to come in you realize the celebrities of heaven is going to be the bride you know you see them all the time on Facebook in these other places you know they go to some kind of a gala or some kind of an event they have that board you know as they walk up and stand before that board you know and they get their picture taken some kind of logo our symbol behind it I thought about it the other day I thought my what it's gonna be like when that little elected bride when she comes walking through the gates of Jerusalem and she stands in front of her board lady hacia and then some urn will have their own board and then the rest of them will have their own board they'll be standing out there every one of them in the pictures would be flashbulbs and whatever more my you understand the bride will be the focus of that new city it won't just be Jesus because Jesus ain't the one coming through the gate is an overcomer he's already done that one open up he everlasting gates everlasting gates let the King of glory come in he's already had his hero's welcome now it's our turn that's a book you ought arrived at a hero's welcome let's stand together we'll pick it up this afternoon now notice again he said in my father's house are many many go over to God I feel like Sheldon many mansions show daint just gonna be my foreign no more but God's laid out an entire future for the entire economy of God all of us
