Revival me yes sir you come to the end and you're just now starting to feel good and uh hey you know the flesh is weak we got jobs calling on us but we are going to have ourselves a Time so the main thing is we want the Revival to get in our hearts and go home so it's just been enjoyable I just got in last night and enjoyed the preaching and enjoyed this morning just the presence of the Lord and uh just feeling really good I'm not a Sentimental Man but uh this Pulpit does something for me I I was thinking know this is the first Pulpit I ever preached inise Lord was in the old house me just did something Supernatural yeah and there's something you know we all have our own individual experiences and different walks of life that we come from but you know there's certain um certain circles God will have people a part of your life brother Brooks brother Jess and um you know we all kind of come out of a Revival and you can never be the same and so I just looking back at the old memories here we are about 20 years down the road nearly maybe maybe 18 years down the road sir and it's been every step worth it every step every trial every problem I was trying to find the mind of the Lord for the service tonight you know as a preacher does he's always got his antenas up listen and you know and then you'll think you got something and you come right up to service and you're like no no no no I gotta go another way oh boy and uh I I was going to preach on the struggle how God don't take the struggle away God just allows the struggle you know we all struggle but I just feel maybe to preach something different tonight if we could turn in our Bibles to Psalms chapter 32 I want to thank brother Jesse for having us it's been an honor to preach here uh to to this group and those that have come in to support the meetings to be with brother Isaiah and sister Ruby and to be with you all wherever you go whether you cross the sea or wherever it may be the Holy Ghost uh filled people and Holy Ghost filled churches are the same spirit and I was hearing I was hearing that singing back there and I appreciate the song leader I like that kind of singing amen I'm not from the hills but I I could I could settle in right and I just like it it was real good God's bouquet Psalms 32 verse 7 and we'll read three portions of scripture we'll go uh Psalms 32 and then we'll go to Psalms 37 and then we'll go to Jude 1 everybody love the Lord amen Psalms 32:7 Thou Art my Hiding Place and thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me with songs of Deliverance say Amen let's go to Psalms 37:25 Psalms 37 we'll read verse 25 through 28 everybody love the Lord amen I have been young and now I'm old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor a seed begging bread he is ever merciful and he lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from Evil and do good dwell forever more for the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his Saints they are preserved which means guarded or protected forever and the seed of the wicked should be cut off Jude chapter one verse one there's only one chapter in Jude so uh verse one I'd like to read verse one of Jude say Amen when you find your places last scripture Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the Father listen and preserved in Jesus Christ and call Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied Glory I want to preach tonight on preserved in Christ amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you dear Lord for the meetings dear God that have built up to this final meeting Lord we know father that a meeting is totally incomplete without you yes dear God we do not wish to be seen or Lord we're not wishing to be a man of the hour we're looking to you you're the one that we long for you're the one that we hunger for Jesus and God without you we can do nothing but Lord we're looking for a Rapture and we have a lot of needs in our hearts and I look across this audience and I see bright eyes and people worshiping I know they love you yes and dear God we we're have a mutual love for you tonight as we come together in your name bless the pastor of this assembly has a vision for the church to want to see him go forward to see him strengthened dear Lord not that any Hof will be left behind we ask oh God Lord that these words would not fall on deaf ears tonight but Lord they would penetrate the deepest recesses of the heart May there be a flame a lick of fire something Eternal oh God that comes from you that we will be ready oh God for the battles that lay ahead bless each and everyone bless the weary bless the sick bless the strong revive our hearts together in the mighty name of Jesus Christ Our Lord we pray amen God bless you you can have your seats the message that we preach has been sent from almighty God this message did not come from a man from Kentucky or did it come from the wisdom of man or the strength of man or the the guise of man the intelligence of man but this message came from the very mind and heart of God and it has been revealed to this age we are a blessed people can you say amen amen this message is the Word of Life yeah and I cannot express what a treasure this word is that'll really believe it that'll really love it I believe that Jesus said it is the spirit that quickens and the flesh profits nothing the words that I speak he said are spirit and they are life and we believe that testimony tonight the words that God left upon this printed page if we accept it by faith and it falls into a SP then it becomes life to the believer that's why Jesus said I am the truth and the life and the way and it takes the spirit to Quicken the word and that word was meant to be in our hearts not in our heads do you believe that brother bam said when God's word upon his lips it is deity speaking it is God speaking you believe that the word to those that regard it as life hear what I said the Baptists look to the word of God the Catholics look to the word of God many of people look to the word of God but it is only Li to those that regard it is Li there are people that have criticize it it'll be nothing to them there'll be people that are just historically nothing for them but it is only to those that regarded as God's word and life eternal you believe that and throughout the ages Satan saw to devalue it he sought to discredit it he sought to destroy it all through history but he's never been able to do it because God's word is Incorruptible and cannot be destroyed can not be reversed God has a people that will find it you believe that yes random said they had had some sunflower seats in King Tut's Tob and brother random said that it was over what 4,000 years old something of that nature he said they took that seed and planted in the ground that it grew the reason it grew is because originally it came from the mouth of God God spoke it and there was a life that was preserved in that seed and this word is The Incorruptible word of God it is the seed of God and if it falls in a fertile ground it's going to grow as sure as the world because it's God's original you believe that I believe God has preserved his word the Bible said in Psalms 12:7 if you want write it down he said Thou shalt keep he's speaking of his words Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever history has proven how God has preserved his word amen you love the Lord his word has been preserved all the way down Through the Ages many have given their life and Spilled their blood standing for the word that I'm preaching tonight we take it for granted sometimes we don't give it what it deserves the resp and the interest and the time that it deserves but God by his grace has brought it to this generation it's not going to just lay on the Shelf somebody is going to believe it somebody is going to manifest it God don't want it to stay upon the PES he wants it to be manifested in our lives in our action and in our love and would say Lord bre that word upon my heart my said I the Lord BR it out water day and night at least someone shall plck it brother ROM said that the gates of hell would be against this word but it would never Prevail because it is The Incorruptible undestroyable word of God there's been all kinds of devils turn loose to counteract it but the real true word of God will go straight to the end and it'll produce what God promised it would said that in the church age book if God if Satan cannot destroy or the word he'll try to remember how Cain rose up against Abel Abel had the Revelation and Cain rose up against it because God Satan despises this word Satan knows the power behind this word right and it threatens him if he was not threatened by it he wouldn't try to discredit it and stop it he knows what it'll produce in the heart of a man or a woman that believes it let me say it like this he knows how dangerous it is even to get into a Young Person's right God gives the Holy Spirit without the respective person whoever meets those requirements God will give it to him right there brother said when will God give you the Holy Ghost he said when you're ready to die upon the altar with your sacrifice it isn't a Praying all night or a begging or a tring it is a die and God can give you the Holy Spirit Right Where You Are this word is true it's true forever is forever written in heaven you believe that I believe that with all my heart the Bible said in Genesis chapter 3:15 that that the that the seed of the woman would bruise the Serpent's head amen amen and the Serpent's head would bruise his heel now Satan has sought to fight the true seed all the way down Through the Ages you remember Abel had a revelation God uh was using Abel but Satan sought to destroy Abel when Satan destroyed Abel through Cain God just rose up s yes brother said it was a type of Resurrection down when abble up comes Seth and God appoints another seed let me tell you if you don't take this word in your heart God will remove you and put someone else there God help us to be Believers tonight help us to take our Salvation serious if we're going to be Christians let's give everything that we have this final push this final raise you believe that Satan attacked and he killed the prophets because they had the word of God on the inside remember God had told uh Jeremiah said I have put my words in your mouth how many know that we're the final voice to the final age he tried to crucify Jesus he's always trying to cut off the program of God I'll try not to hold you long tonight please stay San always trying to stop the the program of God right quickly when God is trying to do something Satan can almost see it before it happen yes sir and you'll go down through the word of God just like M was a deliverer he was born a deliverer and all of a sudden the decree comes kill all the babies it was Satan trying to cut off the deliverer but he never did it because God's word will prevail just like Abel Cain trying to kill Abel or down through Joseph Joseph the brothers hated him they were trying to cast him down because God's purpose was wrapped up in Joseph all the way down to the chronicles of aalon and uh even in the days of Jesus how the decree went forth to kill the children just to reap but in every instance God preserves his seed in every age God has a people who have the word of the immortal Incorruptible word of God and in every Satan is against that people but I want to follow it through the scriptures in every age God has preserved his seed amen you believe that the days of Noah God's purpose was wrapped up in Noah and God said I'll destroy man whom I have created because he was violent his imaginations were continually evil and the Bible said he perverted his way upon the Earth yes sir but yet God had one man he could put his hand on Amen and the judgments had fell and all of those things but God had preserved his seed Noah all the way through the Judgment the reason that God did this is because God's purpose was in Noah and nothing was going to defeat God's purpose how happy we ought to be tonight to see the revelation of the hour to see the purpose of God and the will of God and to know that God's will will never fail God's purpose will never fail you believe that nothing present nothing to come no sickness sorrow death or anything will separate us from the love of God stop God's plan we have God has made we have a purpose here tonight you believe just like it was in the days of God protected Noah God will protect his people God will protect our young people God will protect his bride God will preserve them and we are preserved in Christ tonight do you believe that Fe God's purpose all hell will be against it but they've never ever defeated God that's why he said fear not little flock it's my father's Good Will to give you the kingdom let me show you how this this goes through the scripture God's hand was upon Abraham and the Bible says touch not my prophets nor do touch not my anointed nor do my prophets no harm while they were a few that God had rebuked Kings for their sake you ever seen that in the script you remember when the king of Egypt had taken Sarah God pled his house did you ever see Jacob when laan was coming after Jacob he had a dream laan then and God told him don't you speak good or evil and so he comes up Peter and he says I'm sorry uh uh Jacob and he tells him in my hand to do you harm he said but your God appeared to me last night then God told God told Jacob I want you to go to bthl and Jacob tells his Wives cast out your idols and they start their way to B the Bible said the fear of God come upon the cities yes sir let me tell you you're you're not God Jacob was pack in God's purpose God's plan and so God preserved Jacob bear with me now so now am sees Sarah and she's beautiful most beautiful granny you ever saw said I want that gr yeah right and and Abraham now is like you tell her my you're my sister now that's carnal it wasn't half a lie but a lie is a lie and so he said you tell you tell them that you're my sister so she does what her husband says and brother R dramatizes this and he said am he's got his little sleeping cap on his stri Jamies he takes a shower and he lays across the bed he said he sticks his big wiggling his toes he said going to have that guy sit he goes to sleep and God comes and say you're as good as a dead man amen and he said Lord I'm an innocent man I that man said it was that this was all legal amen God said I really don't care what you have to say a purpose for this man and he's my prophet and you have touched my anointing Hallelujah he said you you restore that man his wife I love that word Resto you give them back that's what God Said in this AG to the devil you give them back turn them lose Amen Let the weak say they're strong Hallelujah you believe that I want you to notice this amck says here take what you got and go you could you know what God was doing God was preserving the bloodline of Abraham because out of Abraham would come the Mah and if God would preserve the natural light of Abraham what about the spiritual life God was preserving his seed you believe that nothing will defeat God's purpose I was preaching on Joseph this morning how Joseph had a vision that all the sheeps would bow and they would raise back and and bow to him and many years had lapsed and like I said God didn't tell me in between he just said oh they're all bow to you now notice the vision had to come to pass we're laboring on this morning that every word of God is true you believe that amen and so Joseph was sold as a slave and and how he suffered in the dungeon and so on and so forth then he ascends to the right hand of pharaoh according to the word of the Lord amen and there's a Great Famine that strikes the Earth for seven years if you got your bibles if you just open your Bibles I want to show you something here how Joseph remember he was the pharaoh's rightand man his brothers his brothers end healing him and he weeps and he sends everybody out here's his brothers here's the vision God now I mean all the sudden the vision vision is before it let me tell you we've looked for the Rapture for a long time one day we'll wake up and the vision will be there there'll be time to go stand upon the word of God eat this word of God and be ready and be ready to go when God calls if you will Genesis 45 verse5 Joseph begins to talk to his brother said come near me and they're shaking in their boots yeah ver chapter 45:5 he said now they be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me God did send me before you to preserve life and then in verse six he said for these two years has famine been in the land and yet he said there are five years which there shall neither be eing nor Harvest God sent me before you to preserve posterity which means a Remnant in the earth to save your lives by great Deliverance Amen in other words the Seed of Abraham would have been wiped out amen but God foresaw the famine coming and to protect Abraham's Pro posterity yes sir he sent a gift Joseph to save the world to save the elect God preserves his in every God preserves it how many believe that you love the Lord then it begins to unfold in Christ that he was typing Christ who blinds the Jews that the Gentiles might be preserved amen he said don't be angry he'll reveal himself to 144,000 don't be angry with yourselves God did it to preserve life did for you take a picture yes sir and then on your amen Joseph dies there raises up a king who knows not Joseph there was a prophecy that that God would deliver Israel out and I and I believe that Joseph as he was dying he said God will surely deliver you right what he said as he was dying is that God will visit you amen and then he dies yes he just goes quiet God marks that in his eternal book glory amen every promise is good every promise is good yes Egypt begins to afflict the children of Israel and it was only a sign that it's time to go let me tell you the things we're saying is only a sign that it's time to get out of here remember we were prospering as a nation and godly but when the pendulum changed and a president rose up that knew not freedom of religion amen then it was time to go amen amen how many believe we're close can I carry on just a little further now notice this as I mentioned Satan knew that there was a deliver in the land so Pharaoh commands The Midwives to kill all the babies all the boy babies but somehow God begins to work on the heart of these midwives amen and they're like we are not going to obey the king's commandment it is awesome and so they lie uh to protect the babies would say well the Hebrew women are Lively they're not like the Egyptians they're not babied and long nails and look like JY Bells they just you know they just have their babies and get back to work yes the Bible said God bless those big wives touch not my anointing that wonderful now notice this by faith Moses was hit for three months right and we know jocked the story of jocked and she had she had done as long as she could she hid him and God allowed him to be hid under joed's protection that's right but pretty soon they came to a place and she could not hiding no more yes and sometimes God will corner you yes he will sometimes he'll allow everything to go wrong because he's trying to reposition you oh we hate those kind of times but we've got to trust God that he'll never leave you nor forsake you and so she's now I don't know what was happening but now it was really knocking on the door she said we didn't three months he is not safe here she feels a pull yeah and now this is not natural because a mother loves her babies and a mother will fight a crocodile for her baby amen but in this case now I can imagine she was pulled oh God I can't hide him and we begin to panic oh God and Satan's pulling he's gonna die he's gonna Boo and get you cannot do nothing for you but God is over here in a t of War saying believe me trust me and she said but God you revealed to me some way that he is the promised son yeah and so there's a tongue of War going you ever been there before pretty soon she steps out by faith and God said that's what I want she feels inspired to make an arc she begins to pitch and this pitch is the same word that they use in Leviticus for atonement yeah oh yeah amen and so she places her baby in there she closes up the basket and said Lord I commit my baby to you this is Faith this is not a natural for a woman she puts it in a in a a an infested River of crocodiles and she pushes it off and she but she did it by fi amen amen there it goes she's crying the devil saying you are a horrible mother right come on yes sir there it goes stream CAU it amen big old crocodiles oh yeah here they come holy Hebrew babies yeah and all of a sudden out of Eternity HS his head out of the water he gets yeah one by one they're head hey God is govering this AR Le it right where it needs to go and the devil's saying lucky lucky and God moves it right in front of Pharaoh's house and it gets caught in the weeds and all of a sudden the the very princess says oh I feel I'll have a back yeah Royal Roes and steps down in the W yeah baby squalls a [Music] baby has no idea God is shaming God is shaming the devil some say Lord use me to shame the devil Hallelujah she takes the baby in her arms and said I'll call you Moses that name didn't come from her she don't know sometimes we're walking right according to the vision and we don't know that we're a part of God let us see we're a part of [Applause] this God preserve that seed all the way for Divine Purpose you love the Lord amen raised him up right up under Pharaoh's roof and uh Pharaoh's feeding the very one that's going to clean his clock love the Lord Ain God good to God had a purpose in Moses life amen it could not be defeated God knew that he through one man would deliver two million Israelites set types and shadows of Christ deler the law to the world reveal himself to the pillar of Fire God Almighty would reveal himself as God above us to one man his name will be written in the eternity what God did God let us be used the man that'll forsake the world and turn his back on the treasures of this world do you believe that amen God protected and preserved him and then as he led Israel out we find the same thing God had PR Goan you believe believe that yes plague after plague dropped upon Pharaoh's house but they were as safe as could be no mosquitoes no flies no lives no maggots nothing they were as safe as safe could be amen the Bible tells us the Lord is thy keeper yes he is the Lord shall preserve the from Evil he shall preserve thy Soul God preserve them through the Wilderness Hallelujah just like a mighty hand of protection right Israel walking let me tell you we are followers of the pillar of Hallelujah we are follow when you follow this message you are following the pillar of fire the Bible said Beware that you obey his voice where is there a place in the Bible where God spoke out of the pillar of fire outside of sin he spoke to the prophet out of Si but not publicly because they said don't talk least we die you speak to the prophet amen and ever since God has spoke in other words Moses was the voice of the pill fire beware that you obey his voice brother brand was the voice of the pill see Whately and so God now chapter 12 verse 13 it says by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt yes sir and by a prophet he was preserved amen amen God preserved the nation of Israel by a prophet amen amen we are preserved from the mark of the beast from the s to the darkness of denominationalism we have been preserved by a prophet remember Joshua when he saw as I was with Moses so will I be with thee he went into the promised land and fought a campaign and did not get a scrap God had preserved his people that's right you believe that amen I could show I mean we could really take our time and show how David was preserved everywhere he went the Bible said it means to keep you safe from destruction I tell you we need Captain this hour there are demon powers that have been loosed Out of Hell the lid of hell has been taken off and you can see that the crosshairs are on you right they're not worried about denominationalism it don't take on the mark of the beast they're only balancing the political Realms but they're where they want to go and that's here it won't be long till they be knocking on the door but God will preserve his people amen right you believe that that means to maintain to keep you alive in the time of Ahab and Jezebel Ahab or Jezebel wanted to kill off everybody that possessed truth remember the 400 prophets and so Ahab was just kind of the puppet that did what his wife said and she said kill that group and he he would do it and and so she was just a monster and there's a spirit in Jezebel right you love the Lord sir yes sir and so Elijah had an uncompromising spirit so brother Brom said he said the spirit of Elijah is an uncompromising Spirit he rebuked him to their face I like it I love his boldness God let us be bold amen and uh so then God said I want you to get up here to the brook of cedra all of a sudden the curse the famine began to people begin to wield away cattle begin to thin grass begin to thin the ground become parched right the rivers begin to dry up at the word of Elijah amen Skies turned to Brass people begin to the old begin to die off amen then the young began to die off no water in the land and it's a lot like today no Revival in the and the prophet said it in 1956 that the Revival was over have you ever thought of that the angel told brother Brandon you will start a Revival around the world Amen and in 1956 he says thus say the Lord and the Revival stops it is exactly like Elijah who shut the heavens off the Revival began and ended at his word hallelujah and now the churches are drying up there'll be a famine in the last days not for bread or water but for hearing the word of God we are a blessed people because God has called us to the SE and while the world is starving God is sending bir from drinken from the Fountain of Life this brother said is the type of the secret place while the world is God has given you a brook of SE where we can drink from the Waters of life where the holy spirit will drop sandwiches to us we can praise God and thank him for the revelations that he this is like heaven you so she wanted to stop this kind of preaching you believe that yes sir believe it's closed so then AA was the daughter of Jezebel just like the Harlot has daughters that's right right and Aila stay with me she married jehoram that's right and jehoram was uh in his Reign he murdered his six younger brothers no doubt aalila her mom was a murderer she no doubt helped instigate it amen and so then jehoram died a very horrible death and the Bible said he departed with without being desired and he was afflicted with a frightful disease of the bows and when he died he died without honor and uh they just buried him so jehoram son AI reigned in his dead for one year and A Hai was killed by J because ju was bringing judgment upon the house of Ahab and aalila Rose up because she seen her opportunity to take the throne and she began to destroy all of the Royal Sea and aala killed her own grandchildren grandchild she was trying to cut off the House of David but God said the Messiah would come out the house of D and God had to preserve a seed she fulfill what she desired Satan was trying to cut off the Royal lineage that's right so right out of that lineage a Woman by the name of was the daughter of jeor she rose up and takes joash into her buos and she runs to the house of the Lord and hides there for six years it's amazing would never think of going to the house of God Amen so quite the devil hates these kind of Mee let me tell you the devil hates this kind of preacher hates this kind of worship God is preserving the see they hid him there for many years ain't that right he was wonderfully preserved by one of joram's daughters that's right God had put something in her heart to take care of that little boy she risked her own life jash was like a brand plucked it was like God put his hand upon this young man and said I'm going to preserve you yes amen how he how honored he must have felt while other cousins and siblings were dying God's hand was upon this young man you love the Lord where did she hiding she hid him in the house of the Lord I wonder if this was not a compound prophecy of Psalms 27 he said he said in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall hide me one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek that I might D in the house of Lord all the days of my life he will hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Lord sometimes God will do these things he will hide the people maybe in a catacomb or some far off place in a little church like this or little house leing while God was trying to destroy the real sea God was preserving one because God had prophesied Messiah would come out of the lineage of David and he would establish the Throne of David forever and nothing will defeat the purpose of almighty God God had purposed it God had spoke it amen and so he's hidden yes sir amen life goes on Amen after's having her parties and thought she wiped her M she has no idea what's happening in the house of God she bed all the Bibles she had turned all churches to denomination she thought they were all Mark at the Beast a little bit she know somewhere was a little group that God had his hand on and the seventh Year all of a sudden they feel inspired it's time to reveal the king and they revealed the king God had preserved one after seven years right love the Lord see where I'm going you to be a happy people T can I carry on we could go into hmon how hmon wanted to destroy destroy the Jewish race completely interesting about hmon now I don't know if this is acced but it's interesting according to history God had told Joshua to kill all of the amalekites a matter of fact he had told Saul to do it Saul failed to do it so an Amite killed Saul how many remember that and so the very thing he was Rose up to destroy when he didn't do it end up destroying him yes and did you know that we find in uh in the book of of uh Esther that that H was an Amite yes he was and he Desir side the entire Jewish race yes sir and what have done it yeah but at the right time God rose up an orphan God preserved that where in the king's chamber [Applause] Hallelujah her in the king chamber and the devil knew nothing about Hallelujah and hmon thought that he was to be promoted had a great idea and the Kings agreeing and little did he know that there was a royal power revealed right here such a time as thisen and when she spoke it turned the course yeah of history at the king signature speak to the darkness the Lord hallelujah Lo yes sir seed of the woman arose out of a little virgin out of a little peasant couple comes the Messiah right from the lineage of David exactly right from the lineage of Abraham right God preserved those blood streams because out of there would come a deliverer amen Satan was trying to but he couldn't do it many times they wanted to thrust him off a mountain and he would disappear Hallelujah many times they had sought to catch him in his words and they just couldn't catch him because God had a season amen when God said it was time he said now it's the time he took the Stinger of death on the inside and he took it for us all amen right aren't you grateful when he rose from the dead he uh he revealed to the disciples that he was the resurrection and the life and the power of God fell upon those disciples and they were never the same and he told them the world hated me and the world will hate you yeah and the apostles found the word of life and they went giving in before Pentecost but after every one of them began giving their lives and martyring because they found life let me tell you if you ever see this message you will see Jesus Christ if you ever really see life eternal and so one day is this okay my word one day Jesus is walking and he Reveals His plan to Peter he said Peter when you were young you walked with yes but when you grow older another shall G thee and thou will walk with thou wouldest not and Peter you know always quick at the trigger what about him Lord what about him he said what's that to you Ione of your [Applause] bus John's gonna see the coming of the Lord yeah and but Jesus never said that Jesus was referring to the Book of Revelation amen yeah he would see the Lord's yes yes so one day they catch him and they said are you one of those that you know you don't go to the message churches he said I am all of his friends are dying now he's he's he was young with the Lord and now he's aged and and he said uh I am proudly a message believer yeah so they stuck him in a pot of oil and they begin to boil oil and I would would have liked to seen John's face oh this is nice yeah I'm not making life yeah put more put more wood on the fire this is wonderful I haven't had a bath like this in a long time I needed it and so they said this man's a witch he's a witch he's a witch so they banished him to the Ale of petas now notice God preserved John and all of a sudden John breaks into vision and he to run let me tell you the vision was not for the first church the vision was not for the dark the vision was for this people that I stand that God was going to reveal the whole revelation of Jesus Christ and John was preserved for our sake Hallelujah and God will preserve you for his sake wonderful so one by one the war was initiated and the disciples begin to fight for truth all the way down to the ages and the word will bring the enemy coming in like a flood amen you believe that you bring the name of Jesus the enemy will come in like a flood you start proclaiming the word and its Purity and the devil will come in like a flood amen and men when they got in contact with the Lord could no longer be the same and immediately there was a persecution that was turned loose immediately let me tell you faith is not something that you manufacture faith is something that comes from God Amen faith is and Revelation is the same and Revelation is not something mysterious it's simply being able to see what God has done that's what a revelation is it's like a light it's it's God reveal so I'm not you know got my own private Revelation but I look at the message and people say false prophet I say that's God and that was revealed from Heaven that was God and that's the same for you it's simple can you say amen and so all the devils in Hell could not shake it from those disciples they beat it out of them they tried to starve it out of them they tried to boil it out of them torture it out of them scare it out of them but they were preserved in Christ I love it because it was in that first age brother random said every time a trumpet sounds it causes disturbance and so the gospel trumpet being was sounded and there was a was upset about it oh yeah war war commenced you believe that amen it was declaring fre freedom to mankind yes it was declaring war with the children of Satan you love the Lord Brother R said how the believer survived the battle of Faith was a miracle he said because they tried to stomp him out smash them out they did everything they could to stop it and so as the church began to move into the Dark Ages we seen the spirit of Jezebel rise up we see in the Bible thou sufferest that woman Jezebel to teach and seduce my Serv right so the spirit of Jezebel Rose back up to attack the message just like it always did and those Martyrs went to Martyr without blinking an eye yeah and if you read the fox's book of Martyrs they were smashed they were they were destroyed and there would be a Catholic priest and his wearing his dress like they do he would take a he' take a a crucifix they put a mule on this end and a mule on this man and they'd say kiss the crucifix or you'll be apart those men would stand there and say Give Me Jesus amen and they would start pulling them apart and they would pull those people apart but they would not bow amen that was more than just a little head knowledge that was a revelation that came and Satan began to destroy but you know Satan It's never enough he killed one to kill another and kill children and kill women pregnant women and would pull them apart and put them in Barrel and set them on fire begin to fet them alive and stick coals in their mouths and it's just I mean it's almost too much I I read about 450 pages of the fox's book of Martyrs I said it's enough those Martyrs stood there in the catacombs the dark caves underneath the Earth they were singing down there why were they doing it because they feel the same love for God that you feel here tonight come on you believe that yes they would write things on the wall and they would risk their lives even in the hottest persecution we find that that it only caused the flame to grow only grew brother Ram said when peace would come in through the ages you would see peace and persecution peace and persecution when peace come in it would set the church back yes sir it's exactly right sir every time in the scriptures persecution caused the church to flourish we don't realize the value of this word yes sir let him try to take it from you put you in bondage but it comes down to it God is all that matters you can have all the big screen televisions and entertainments and everything the government can offer but when it comes down to the end of the road we're gonna want something real we want something that has life in you believe that they endured 1,500 years of Dark Ages you believe the Lord they they every invention imaginable they crushed them they stretched them they burned them they froze them and they could not stop it and then pretty soon enough time the false Church began to grow and God said in the church ages he said uh I know your works and where you dwell even Satan's seat Satan actually set his very seat there in the [Music] yet the over were overcoming him right on his ground blessed are they that overcome may God bless this people tonight yes then the church went down into the Dark Ages which was called The Very depths of Satan how many remember that in the Book of Revelation church and state had United and they went through a thousand years of total darkness which is the depths of Satan and the nominal Church would kill anything that disagreed with do you love the Lord amen down through the Dark Ages they struggled to survive and the little flock was meeting in catacombs and little places and but they were still God was preserving this little group down to the ages and every age there was a holy ghost a holy ghost filled group amen every age there was a group that loved God and stood for his word and which is true I I've read the martyrs where young people uh one man was being stretched and he started screaming and recaning and a and a 17-year-old girl said you miserable wretch that you would give up for a few moments of pleasure a life eternal and she took his Marty yeah I've seen where young children where they would say denounce the Oneness of God and he said we children have learned from the breast of our mothers there's but one God Amen and he said you little villain and he began to torture the child and the mother when he asked for what rebuked him and said think of the children of Bethlehem that were slaughtered and the children and the and that little boy smiled at his mother I tell you God's hand was a PP amen the Lord let me tell you this holy ghost is real they went into the darkest hour and the great was drunk violently with the blood of the Martyr she became intoxicated with the blood of the Martyr she couldn't get enough she took pleasure in killing the the Christians and so on and so forth and everyone that become a Catholic were Body Spirit and soul prisoners just like they are today amen Jesus said I've come to make you free amen God good Hall they destroyed him and I and I don't want to draw it down I know we have children here but they crushed them they destroyed them they plowed through them they B bies they burn them they intimidated they burnt churches everything in their path it was like a steamroller just to it liveed to kill real Christians you would think it could have never survived Satan's machine Jesus you thought they never survive 1500 years church and state annihilate anything I've been to those places to the torture chambers it's unreal the castles where and you look and you think men were praying and here God have mercy God have mercy and Jesus said that he said that uh they died in faith amen right amen praise the Lord you love the Lord amen after a thousand years they took such control and Domin great Steeples they look like uh you know when you go into in the early days you would go into a city like Williamsburg and you might walk into the courtyard and then walk into the first room of of the court and you would see arms hanging up and the idea was to all you of their power they would have guns and they would use those guns to go out and fight if they had to but they want you to walk in and look at these buildings dear God I want to mess with this group the Catholic Church did the same they made huge Steeples that towered over the people to make you feel like a r and if you dare resist us we will crush you I've been in those countries and brouge and different places where they just destroyed Christians and after all of that everyone is silent no one making a move no one and I imagine the Satan just in the bowels of Hell holding his belly laughing like an idiot and all of a sudden Martin Luther is doing pentant and all of a sudden a revelation come from heaven but Wasing it was contagious because it came from God the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith all the way from Rome back to Germany the live byth he walk he opens up a scripture begins to preach the just shall live by faith and it move from him to them the just shall live by faith and they begin sh and raising their hand what am I saying the seed went in the ground thought that it was dead after a thousand years life was in the SE come back and begin to shine a bright light but it wasn't enough just to share it with the loc God said nail it on the door of the of the whittenberg church and so he began to write 97 thesis or 95 thesis then he finds himself what are you doing I'm March right to the doores that 95 thesis he puts it on the wall and he begins to nail it he's anointed to do it history said that it was almost like Angels pour the message into every corner of the Earth because he was anointed to call a whole church out of the dark preser his SE can you say Amen out raised a mighty church and the devil fell right off his lawn chair raised up demons and said go back let's recruit let's reather ourselves and they did yes sir and and uh I I don't want to go deep into the histories but you'll find out that Satan had actually brought that church right back into denominationalism through aalila the daughter the daughter harlots you believe that and so life broke forth it started the reformation and one man in the hands of God turned the world around God could use you tonight his word has life amen you believe that amen so Warriors rose up in Luther's age you know what I love uh it was David that was anointed king but those that supported him became anointed too oh yeah oh yeah there's no way that a man can kill lions like that and kill 800 men with a spear but they were anointed once they supported the man of God and I believe Luther was the messenger to the age when God rose up Warriors that said I'll stand for that word like Luther and they begin to hold up his hands let me tell you brother brandom is the messenger but God has raised Warriors that are anointed by the same [Applause] Eagle believe that thank God for Real Men of God like your pastor that preach the word of God without compromise to preach the word of God in its Purity it will produce a Rapture it will save our children you believe that Aila rose up to strangle the true seed and bring it back to organization and there were men that were not uh angels of the church age but they were anointed men like William tendale yeah William tendale gets a burd and said no no this don't need to be in the church this word needs to get to the people and he speaks seven different languages a brilliant man and he said by the help of God I could actually get the Bible to the people amen Tindale he became just consumed with get the Bible to the people get the Bible to the people you say oh that was the old you realize Murphy Wong just translated the Chinese Bible in the Chinese and it is the best Bible in China wow he has spent years working on it he just finished it we are living in the Bible days and God anointed mer you believe that I like it John Fox describes an argument uh with with tendale against the clergyman and the the clergyman said we better be without God's laws than the popes tindel responded I defy the pope and all his laws and if God spares my life these many years I'll cause the boy that drives the P to know more scriptures than you do ah did he ever T was brought to execution he gave his life he translated the Bible into English he went he went to the uh uh execution he was convicted of heresy so they were going to strangle him and burn his body at the stake and in his dying request he screamed as he was at the stake Lord open the king of England's eyes two years later God did just what he pray the majority of the King James Bible was written by tnd and so tale's work was not in vain your labor in the Lord is not in vain and so we're enjoying tale's worken ain't that wonderful and so God had preserved it then there was John Wesley I don't want am I holding you too long I just love these things amen John Wesley you know was raised in Godly star yeah his daddy was a preacher his mother was Godly prayed over it and when John Wesley was just six years old he got stranded in an upper floor and the building was on fire and a couple men went up against the window they pulled John Wesley out and saved his life before the house collapsed and he always called himself a brand plucked from the fire but you know we know more than history does Amen because we realized that God had a Divine Purpose in West and that God had to preserve Wesley in order to turn the course of the world in his age and to restore the uh the truth of sanctification he was seconds away from death and God came and preserved his life John Wesley made a stand against the Anglican Church that didn't even believe in revivals and I love his story because uh can I go just a little bit John Westley you know was preaching in the Church of England he was really disheartened and he gets a born again experience in a Moravian meeting uh as they were reading uh the letters of uh um Martin Luther I think it was Romans 8 or nine N I believe it was and he was sitting there listening and his heart was strangely warmed and so he begins to preach having a per personal experience with God and the English the Church of England said absolutely not that kind of preaching in this Pulpit so George Whitefield said uh will you come out here and so John Wesley comes out to see what George Whitfield is doing George Whitfield was banned from the churches as well so he started preaching in the open air George Whitefield was a mighty preacher he was able I believe it was Benjamin Franklin that said he calculated that he could preach to 30,000 people and with with no amplification just in the open air he could reach 30,000 people man preached come out of organization and love God and have a personal experience they were in the brickyards and in the coal mines and these people would die in the 30s and 40s they had no hope they lived in there that was the only way to live there was no other life and they lived like moles and rats they went out into these clay yards and brick yards and he began to preach and attract thousands wow but George Whitefield had to come over the United States so he asked he asked Wesley come and help me and and and the rest of the story is George Whitefield came to America and the Second Great Awakening took place or the first Great Awakening took place at that time Wesley come and he was appalled at this how can you preach like this to this people but when he saw the results he said well I'll try it so one morning he come out in his his robes and he's walking through the mud and God is humbling and he began to preach and the response was absolutely incredible these people could never walked into a church but God took the word to them Hallelujah Hallelujah by the end of the day he preached the 7,000 people he was converted and from that point on he began to preach everywhere in the hay markets and in the fields and the whole world become his F amen aren don't you love the Lord I love those histories I think it's wonderful can I go a little further so Satan had also brought them into denomination as well trying to cut off the program of God like Satan always does now we're in the most deceptive age of all ages I'll just hold you a little longer we know brother ROM's story that five minutes after his birth they opened a widow window and a pillar of fire come over because God had a purpose for his life brother BR was just a small boy he uh his mom was four months pregnant he was a baby nursing baby and uh Charles went off logging in a horrible winter storm had come in and uh El was working throwing wood into the fire pretty soon she run out of wood and she couldn't go out they run out of food she became weak so she wrapped her and her baby in blankets and just was laying there and was dying the fire went out they were freezing to death and it was just before they died an old neighbor walked outside after the blizzard was working and looked and he noticed no smoke was coming out of the cab oh but he knew smoke was coming out of there before the blizzard and he knew nobody could get out during the blizzard and so God now got to show his attention I wonder sometimes if we don't notice God working in our Liv And so eating at you know you could just ignore Fleet tomorrow but no he goes down there and when he saw that there were no Footprints outside the door he knew someone was in trouble amen he forced his way in and he was shocked to see this mother dying with their baby he went out and he started a fire he went and got groceries he saved their life why because God was preserving his seed because they was going to be a people that would need this message of the hour because there's going to be a mark of the beast there's going to be a tribulation and God was going to protect his people you believe that down just God was preserving his gift you know brother Brandon when he lost his wife and baby he said he was up on a pole and he looked at the wi he couldn't take it no more and said he was going to kill himself and he found himself at the bottom of the PO God was preserving the when he went home he was gonna pull the trigger in his mouth but God didn't let it happen because God was preserving his SE that right brother ROM said when those boys beat him silly he out there with a gun intending to kill every one of them but none of those bullets went off why because God was preserving this message only would have had a prison ministry he never would have got it you love the Lord AR you happy and from that man he has anointed an entire group of preachers who set fire with the flame of God who is preaching this message in its Purity from the rooftops we are going forth with the torch light of Freedom saying Let Freedom re and we are preaching you can be free God has preserved the bride the save you believe that the holy spirit is the preserver of life amen hallelujah said brother Craig I've served the Lord 20 years it hasn't been in your strength God has preserved to you by the Holy Ghost say brother Craig all the false doctrines in this message how in the world how are we here to this pres I love the way God does things Billy Graham Rose and fell his message ain't ascending or Roberts Rose and fell Rose and fell but the message moved over the world it just keep let me tell you one day we're gonna step like you we're just going to keep walking on that because God has preserved to keep us God has preserved us from the evils of this world you say oh brother Craig you know those old legalistic preatures get the television out of your house you realize the television is the biggest brainwashing system that the world has now we see plainly why he said apply the token and get the television out the people are being fed homosexuality and that gender confusion minds of the people are God but by the grace of God he preserve it's absolutely astounding that God has preserved Us in the darkest age to the most deceptive age we are secure in Christ Hallelujah in the world do we we have the baptism of Jesus Christ how in the world do we have the the Bible being our absolute hallu that we know the C of denominationalism we know predestination and serpent seed right and even to be shown down through history where Satan came in and where he'll be cut off and the surviving Remnant how they survived how God has revealed every truth there's never been a day like thisday people we are here because God has preserved you I know you don't think of yourself as much but God has preserved you that you might believe time message how many Believers are here tonight the Bible said we are kept by the power of God and God has preserved us for what for his [Music] return when he returns he's gonna have a little bride with a bouquet clothed in his word wait up you have churches churches and bright he's gonna have one who's been kept virgin to his word she's sitting there not looking like the world but looking like Esther character through and through and the devil said how did it happen I planted churches on every corner come on now Baptist deception Catholic deception mid deception I plant every house I planted corruption in every school how the world those people stand there like Abram Sarah on mes from Jacob the king I want to close by saying this he says in Psalms 2 he said let's turn it I want to read it here psalms 27 Hallelujah brother Brandon preached the Rapture out of this message amen you love the Lord amen yes sir these are very familiar words but in the light of what I preached I want to read it again isn't God good hallah psalms 27 says these words the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I be afraid the Lord is the strength of my life I'm sorry Whom Shall I be afraid when the wicked my enemies and my foes Came Upon me teed up my flesh they stumbled and fell amen though a should come about against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and one thing will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I'll seek after listen yes that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple listen in the time of trouble the tribulation he shall hide me in his Pavilion Amen in the secret of his tab tacle shall he hide me and set me upon a rock I want you to notice that little King was hidden in the temple for six years and they revealed the king in the seven that was David a son of David it was in type that scripture could have applied in compound prophecy to him but brother random said distinctly that applies to us amen here in the seventh age when the devil thought he had it all gone God has revealed his bride in the seventh age and she has been preserved not in some church building but in Christ and Christ is our Temple you believe that and now God Reveals His wife in the seventh page amen he has preserved him a bride don't you love the Lord I want to say this this message is more than Doctrine yes it is this message is him yeah he is our safety he is our hiding place don't you love the Lord now we see Israel somehow God has preserved Israel over the years and she Rose to power somehow some way then now we see ourselves rising in the glory and the beauty of God we don't know how it happened all we can say it's marvelous in our eyes aren't you glad that he his hand has been upon you you wives that are raising mothers and toiling over the dishes and feeling like I just live to to feed and white noses let me tell you it's a noble word children fear of God Amen that God has preserved you amen there's a sister in my church she works in daycare and you know they're telling them not to say no to those children not to teach them anything of right and wrong they don't even have books that of women with aprons they want to remove it completely they want to remove male and female completely total gender confusion right yes sir all right yes sir the only thing that will have its right mind in the entire world will be the bride of Christ yeah sirl don't you love the Lord aren't you glad to have eyes aren't you
