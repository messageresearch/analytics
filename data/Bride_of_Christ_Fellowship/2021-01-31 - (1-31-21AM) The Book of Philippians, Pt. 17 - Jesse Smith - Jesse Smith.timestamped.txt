[35:45] saint said amen god bless you as you're
[35:48] being seated praise god
[35:51] now we do we'll be doing a little bit of
[35:53] reading so if my children are gonna have
[35:54] their bibles handy um
[35:58] we'll be doing a little bit of reading
[36:00] from various portions of scripture
[36:06] so i'm going to try to preach off a
[36:07] smaller screen today just my phone
[36:12] so we read our text here and let's look
[36:14] again at verse 18.
[36:17] let me set a timer here also
[36:32] i just keep checking the roads there
[36:33] they just look great and the snow
[36:35] stopped i know it's supposed to start
[36:36] though
[36:37] later on i guess i was thinking this too
[36:39] you know i remember
[36:42] last year or maybe was the year before
[36:46] um i kind of learned the hard way to be
[36:48] more cautious on snowy days
[36:50] it was a wednesday night and uh
[36:54] you know it was snowing and i was like
[36:55] well we'll go to church anyway you know
[36:56] who cares you
[36:57] will make it well getting there was fine
[37:00] but getting home was awful
[37:02] um and uh we were on 76
[37:06] and uh we started slipping and sliding
[37:08] and almost got hit by
[37:09] an 18-wheeler uh so that you guys
[37:12] remember that do you remember
[37:14] lydia remembers uh we came to a complete
[37:16] stop there was a the car
[37:17] in front of us just spun out almost
[37:19] completely
[37:21] and then got straightened out uh and
[37:24] then we came right to a stop and we
[37:25] actually bumped vehicles that's right we
[37:27] bumped vehicles
[37:29] and so from that moment i was like well
[37:31] i'm going to be more cautious
[37:33] if i possibly can when it comes to snow
[37:35] so that's why i'm a little cautious this
[37:36] morning
[37:38] um you know because i really was putting
[37:40] my own children in danger so god forgive
[37:42] me for that
[37:43] sometimes our zeal isn't always divine
[37:47] right and uh our human zeal
[37:50] eats up our divine wisdom so
[37:53] just thought i'd remind everybody that
[37:55] myself too so let's look to uh
[37:57] the scripture now the bible says in
[37:59] verse 18 philippians 4
[38:02] paul said i have all and abound
[38:05] remember that means overflowing so paul
[38:08] had everything he needed plus
[38:10] extra i guess we find ourselves in that
[38:12] case this morning physically right
[38:15] but we know the zeal this age the
[38:18] warning of this age is not to feel like
[38:20] we have no more
[38:21] spiritual needs that's the great
[38:24] temptation of this age
[38:26] we have to make sure that we always
[38:27] remember we have need of more church
[38:29] we have need of more singing right more
[38:32] bible study and more preaching and more
[38:34] revelation that is the great sin of this
[38:37] age to say we have no more need of god
[38:39] there's no more revelation there's no
[38:40] more truth
[38:42] and that's a great sin when uh the
[38:45] people are rich and increased with goods
[38:47] and have no more spiritual needs we just
[38:49] read about that last night from charles
[38:51] spurgeon
[38:52] so that was a great thought uh out of
[38:54] the word of god
[38:56] but here paul's at a spot remember he
[38:58] would have fluctuate from having
[39:00] what he needed and other times he lacked
[39:02] a lot but the great
[39:03] lesson the prophet learned was to be
[39:05] content in whatever state he was in
[39:08] and so that's a great lesson even a 50
[39:10] 60 70 year old
[39:11] christian who's full of the holy ghost
[39:13] can learn that lesson
[39:15] to be content no matter what state we
[39:17] find ourselves in whether
[39:18] we got everything we want we don't have
[39:20] everything we want
[39:22] we like what's going on we don't like
[39:23] what's going on
[39:25] a great blessing of the holy spirit is
[39:27] contentment
[39:28] for godliness with contentment is a
[39:30] great gain so paul had attained great
[39:33] things had he not
[39:34] even in prison he had obtained great
[39:37] spiritual blessings
[39:41] so he says i'm full having received of
[39:43] epiphanitis so he was the messenger
[39:46] uh carrying the the message of his
[39:49] necessities right
[39:52] they were sent from the church in
[39:53] philippi the bible says
[39:55] and i want to meditate on this thought
[39:57] this morning so this is my major thought
[39:59] it's an odor it's a smell of a sweet
[40:03] smell
[40:04] a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to
[40:07] god
[40:08] so again we find that the philippians
[40:10] here in sending money
[40:12] or food or clothing or whatever they
[40:14] could send to paul
[40:17] it was a sacrifice so they
[40:20] the philippians lost some of their money
[40:22] or they they gave
[40:24] up i should say freely gave up they gave
[40:26] up some of their money they gave up some
[40:28] of their food
[40:29] uh perhaps some of their own clothing
[40:31] they lost
[40:32] of their uh possessions that paul might
[40:35] gain
[40:36] and so paul recognizes this is a sweet
[40:39] smelling
[40:40] sacrifice unto god and it pleased god
[40:44] well amen it made god
[40:47] well pleased very happy
[40:51] and so we want to look at this thought
[40:52] now i want to just take that thought
[40:55] and i want to remember that uh this is a
[40:58] gift of necessity
[41:00] so we have to remember amongst ourselves
[41:01] sometimes we give you know we might give
[41:03] a christmas gift or might give something
[41:06] a birthday gift but it's not always a
[41:08] necessity right
[41:09] and so we want to remember real
[41:11] sacrifices uh
[41:14] you know they're they're they're
[41:16] sacrifices that help people's
[41:18] necessities
[41:20] that was in verse 16 paul said you gave
[41:22] unto my necessity
[41:26] and also verse 14 said it was to relieve
[41:29] paul's affliction so maybe it was even
[41:32] medicine that just thought just came to
[41:33] me there maybe it was medicine or
[41:35] some other thing paul was afflicted
[41:37] there in prison
[41:38] and so the philippians heard about it
[41:40] and they gave to his necessity
[41:44] and paul was full he was happy he was
[41:48] content
[41:49] and said that it was an act of worship
[41:53] and so this is what sometimes we often
[41:55] need reminders of
[41:57] is that giving to others is worship we
[42:00] got to be careful not to think well i
[42:01] went to church
[42:02] i did my worship well i'll say like this
[42:05] we did part of our worship when we went
[42:06] to church
[42:08] but there's certainly more worship we
[42:10] can do
[42:12] and paul ties this in to old testament
[42:16] sacrifices so we're going to take this
[42:18] morning's message and kind of
[42:20] review old testament sacrifices
[42:24] because now that i've studied more even
[42:26] on it
[42:27] i've grown deeper in my understanding in
[42:29] it as well so i hope it's a blessing
[42:30] this morning
[42:32] because the holy spirit inspired paul to
[42:34] say when the
[42:35] philippians gave to my affliction it
[42:38] helped my affliction gave to my
[42:40] necessity
[42:41] it was an odor a sweet smelling savor
[42:45] in the nostrils of god now figuratively
[42:46] speaking that's personification right
[42:50] to god almighty
[42:54] so let's uh quickly or not quickly let's
[42:57] briefly review the five kinds of
[42:59] offerings
[43:00] go ahead and see if you can name the
[43:01] five kind of offerings there in your
[43:02] home
[43:04] anybody name them here
[43:09] burnt sid yeah
[43:23] trespass so now i got four of them let's
[43:26] i'm gonna give him a cheer
[43:28] good job buddy nice nice memory there
[43:31] yeah there are five uh five old
[43:34] testament sacrifices as far as the
[43:36] worship
[43:36] now we gotta remember too there was a
[43:38] six we would say as far as the red
[43:40] heifer
[43:41] kind of made the way for all of them
[43:43] right because no one could even come to
[43:45] worship and
[43:46] and bring their goat let's say for a sin
[43:48] offering no one can even bring that
[43:50] until first
[43:51] they've been sprinkled with the red
[43:52] heifer right the at the waters of
[43:55] separation from the red heifer as we
[43:56] preached on
[43:57] numerous years ago now so let me just
[44:01] name all five again and uh by god's
[44:04] grace
[44:04] tell the meaning or the basic meaning of
[44:06] each one
[44:08] so the first is peace offering now this
[44:10] is a thanksgiving of any kind
[44:13] okay so it's a thanksgiving it can be
[44:15] any kind of worship or any for
[44:17] i'm sorry for any reason thanksgiving
[44:19] for any reason at all
[44:22] a second is the meal or meat
[44:25] as malakai said so it's the same thing
[44:27] now that's where it can be a little
[44:28] confusing because when we think of meat
[44:30] we think of chicken right or steak or
[44:32] hamburger something like that but
[44:35] in the old testament meat was just food
[44:38] in this case and so this was a
[44:42] a uh an offering for thanking god for
[44:46] the specific provisions
[44:48] of food and drink okay
[44:52] so this specifically deals with the
[44:53] provisions from the earth
[44:55] so the piece was thank you god for
[44:57] anything could be healing you know
[44:58] anything
[44:59] uh rain anything at all when they wanted
[45:03] to give thanks
[45:04] for food and drink it was
[45:07] the meal offering or the meat offering
[45:10] the third type was sin offering
[45:14] and a sin offering was an offering for
[45:16] atonement
[45:18] for any unintentional sins so this was
[45:21] unintentional so things you did that you
[45:24] didn't really
[45:25] think you did or you know the holy
[45:27] spirit brings it to your remembrance
[45:28] later ah that's right i did that or
[45:30] someone comes to you and you know shares
[45:33] a
[45:34] fault you committed against them and you
[45:35] didn't know it
[45:37] that's what the sin offering was for
[45:41] now trespass offering that was
[45:45] a sacrifice for atonement for your
[45:48] intentional sins
[45:50] so when you knew it was wrong and you
[45:52] did it we would call that iniquity right
[45:53] or
[45:54] uh a transgression like you did it on
[45:56] purpose
[45:59] so a trespass or uh another one is
[46:01] another name for it i'm sorry
[46:02] is guilt offering you know you're guilty
[46:05] and
[46:06] it was your fault uh you did it on
[46:09] purpose
[46:10] trespass offering for that one
[46:15] and then the fifth and final was the
[46:17] burnt offering
[46:19] and this was a sacrifice of total
[46:22] submission to god
[46:24] total obedience to the will of god
[46:28] it was a sacrifice you just made and
[46:30] said i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm coming
[46:32] completely
[46:33] uh to god i'm just giving myself
[46:34] completely to god
[46:36] okay so again peace meet sin
[46:40] trespass burnt offering
[46:43] now we'll get to at the end of the
[46:44] message but which one of these do you
[46:45] think paul was referencing
[46:47] i don't know for sure but i'll give you
[46:49] my thought at the end
[46:51] um i think it's pretty clear that once
[46:53] you really take a little time and think
[46:54] about it but
[46:56] again peace meet sin trespass
[46:59] burn offering
[47:02] all right so uh now let's take a little
[47:05] bit we'll look at uh some of these
[47:08] uh scriptures in regards to these
[47:11] offerings
[47:13] and i'm going to go over them a little
[47:14] bit more thorough here by god's grace to
[47:16] share a little bit more
[47:18] okay so the first is peace offering
[47:20] again giving thanks for anything
[47:23] i'm going to read a little bit out of
[47:24] easton's bible dictionary
[47:27] just as an overview this all the
[47:29] offerings were offerings made by fire
[47:32] you had to have fire to consume right
[47:34] that reminds us that god is a
[47:36] consuming fire so when we give our
[47:39] offerings in the spiritual
[47:40] we got to have the love of god the fire
[47:42] of god the spirit of god
[47:44] in our hearts right consuming our
[47:47] selfish will
[47:48] or our desires uh
[47:51] you know just consuming our minds right
[47:54] just consuming everything
[47:55] a consuming fire so peace is a
[47:59] peace offering is a fiery offering and
[48:01] it's of the herd or the flock it's a
[48:03] bloody offering
[48:06] okay and these are mostly detailed in
[48:08] leviticus 3 leviticus 7
[48:11] is where you'll find most of these
[48:14] details now there's three kinds of
[48:17] peace offerings you had thanksgiving
[48:20] offerings
[48:21] of gratitude for the blessings received
[48:25] second was the fulfillment of a vow
[48:28] so you give a peace offering when your
[48:30] vow is fulfilled
[48:32] and also uh another one's called free
[48:35] will offerings
[48:36] and this is something that's
[48:37] spontaneously devoted for god so if you
[48:40] just
[48:41] uh happen to see the hand of god and you
[48:44] just want to give a quick
[48:45] a quick worship a quick thanksgiving
[48:48] that would be called a free will
[48:50] offering remember they did that in the
[48:51] days of david and moses
[48:53] they just kind of announced well who can
[48:54] give to the temple or who can give to
[48:56] the tabernacle
[48:57] and the bible says all those with a free
[48:59] willing heart
[49:01] came and just brought it right it wasn't
[49:03] it was just a spontaneous thing
[49:07] and so we can see that uh you know when
[49:09] something great happens or we get a
[49:11] little extra money or something we just
[49:12] want to give a spontaneous praise a
[49:14] spontaneous worship uh of a sacrifice
[49:18] that's a peace offering that's a that's
[49:20] a thanks offering
[49:22] attitude or an attitude of gratitude
[49:25] we'd say like that
[49:26] by the grace of the lord
[49:30] now second is a meat or meal offering
[49:35] and this is the only one we can find
[49:37] that wasn't
[49:38] bloody it still had fire
[49:42] and it's specifically called a sweet
[49:44] saver so maokai can you read
[49:45] leviticus 2 verse 2. he'll just read
[49:48] that one verse while i'm going to read
[49:49] this
[49:51] um the hebrew word
[49:54] denotes unbloody sacrifice
[49:58] and these were always accompanied with
[50:00] drink offerings so that kind of brings
[50:02] some scriptures to our mind like david
[50:04] doing a drink offering right or pouring
[50:06] out
[50:08] the water from bethlehem so meat and
[50:11] drink go
[50:12] together so that's not an extra one but
[50:13] they always went together
[50:15] in the scripture so malcolm you read
[50:17] leviticus 2 verse 2
[50:19] and he shall bring it to aaron's sons
[50:21] the priests and he shall take throughout
[50:24] his handful of the flower thereof and of
[50:26] the oil thereof
[50:27] with all the frankincense thereof and on
[50:29] the pre-show burn the memorial
[50:31] upon the altar to be an offering made by
[50:33] fire the sweet savor unto the lord
[50:36] thank you so the bible says plainly this
[50:39] type of sacrifice was a
[50:41] sweet savor into the lord notice add
[50:44] flour
[50:45] salt and oil but there was no leaven
[50:49] and no honey so we see some of the
[50:53] uh symbols here right leaven represents
[50:56] sin
[50:57] see and then salt and oil you are the
[51:00] salt of the earth
[51:02] right uh oil represents the holy spirit
[51:04] again
[51:05] and flour and we all know how brother
[51:07] graham talked about this kind of
[51:09] uh meal offering but i talked about it
[51:11] with elijah when the
[51:12] there was death in the pot right and so
[51:15] they had to
[51:15] they had to add uh the good meal
[51:19] and brother ram said that it was adding
[51:20] christ he said because
[51:22] uh every all the every every uh every
[51:26] particle of the flower
[51:27] was the same size and brother and said
[51:29] that's jesus christ the same
[51:31] yesterday today and forever so follow
[51:33] her flower was
[51:35] ground right until every aspect of it
[51:38] was the same
[51:40] and so we see that uh how this
[51:41] represents christ
[51:44] and remember every bible says every
[51:46] sacrifice
[51:47] points us to christ
[51:50] so we have peace which is bloody now we
[51:53] have
[51:53] meal or meat which is the only one
[51:55] that's not bloody
[51:58] there's no blood involved with this one
[52:01] and it was in recognition of the
[52:03] sovereignty of god
[52:04] and of the bount of his bounty in giving
[52:07] these earthly blessings
[52:11] okay and uh the dictionary says it
[52:14] always followed the sacrifice of blood
[52:16] and i like that thought blood had to go
[52:18] first right
[52:19] we couldn't worship without blood right
[52:21] so you just want to give you know like a
[52:23] meal or meat
[52:24] you'd always start with the blood there
[52:25] always had to be some type of blood
[52:27] offering
[52:28] as we'll show later the most common
[52:30] offering was a burnt offering
[52:32] it was the one that people did most they
[52:34] just wanted to show their total
[52:35] submission to god or
[52:36] surrender to god and so that if if you
[52:39] wanted to offer
[52:40] you know a meat or meal offering you'd
[52:42] first start with a burnt offering you
[52:43] know
[52:44] is the most common one so
[52:48] uh you can start seeing how each one has
[52:50] a specific purpose right
[52:51] and then how it relates to us right
[52:53] jesus is our peace he was our peace
[52:55] offering
[52:56] praise god and we give spontaneous
[52:58] praise to god for that right
[53:00] he give us peace and we give god thanks
[53:02] and we should always give god thanks
[53:04] praise the lord then we should have this
[53:07] meat or meal offering
[53:09] as well now let's look at a little bit
[53:12] of the drink offering here
[53:13] from easton's bible dictionary it was
[53:16] always combined with meat as we say
[53:19] and also presented daily at the
[53:22] tabernacle i think that's a great
[53:23] thought there too
[53:25] every day they had to have a meat
[53:27] offering so every day they had to make
[53:29] an offering of
[53:31] bread basically flour and wine
[53:34] because the drink offering was usually
[53:36] of wine we're not going to read it but
[53:38] it says it in numbers
[53:39] 15 verse 5 and hosea 9 verse 4.
[53:44] and so these were offered on every
[53:45] single day
[53:48] and uh on the sabbath and on feast days
[53:52] so this was a this was something they
[53:54] did daily
[53:57] at least in the tabernacle and so
[54:00] a way to give thanks so that means every
[54:02] day we should thank god
[54:04] like like jesus prayer give us this day
[54:06] our daily bread
[54:07] right every day we should thank god for
[54:10] the food
[54:10] and the the water and everything that we
[54:12] have
[54:14] and it should be a sacrifice from our
[54:15] lips we should say thank you lord
[54:17] most of us don't know want right some of
[54:20] us know a little bit of poverty
[54:22] but most of us don't don't know want and
[54:25] so we should not take it for granted we
[54:26] should give god thanks we should give
[54:28] god praise
[54:29] for this meal for this blessing for for
[54:31] this provision everything
[54:33] he's provided through the earth
[54:35] everything he's given
[54:36] to uh give us provisions for our family
[54:39] and
[54:39] and continue to live this earthly life
[54:41] we should give god thanks for that
[54:44] praise god okay here's a little bit more
[54:47] about the third one
[54:48] sin offering again fiery bloody
[54:52] and this one seems to be mostly bullocks
[54:55] and goats
[54:56] mostly bullocks and goats this is found
[54:59] in leviticus 4.
[55:05] and now it's interesting too this says
[55:07] there was a necessity of making
[55:09] application to it
[55:10] as often as the guilt of sin renews
[55:13] itself
[55:14] upon your conscience okay so whenever
[55:18] sin would become
[55:19] whenever yours you'd be more aware of
[55:21] your sin and it would renew on your
[55:23] conscience
[55:24] then you would go to make this this the
[55:27] sacrifice
[55:29] because you just become aware oh i'm a
[55:31] sinner
[55:33] and i've i've i've got to constantly
[55:35] remember that
[55:36] oh yeah i'm aware of my sinful nature oh
[55:39] it's been a hard week or it's been a
[55:40] hard month
[55:42] and so these these sin offerings were
[55:44] for that purpose
[55:47] as often as you remembered your sin
[55:49] nature you just want to say oh god
[55:50] forgive me
[55:51] uh thank you for pardoning my sins
[55:55] but this was especially now this one in
[55:57] particular
[55:58] was even magnified of course on the day
[56:00] of atonement right we went through that
[56:02] a few years ago
[56:04] with a day of atonement it was special
[56:07] uh sin offerings on the day of atonement
[56:10] and this blood once a year the sin
[56:13] offering
[56:14] was carried into the holy of holies and
[56:16] sprinkled
[56:17] on the mercy seat praise god so this was
[56:20] the great the
[56:20] one day once a year was the sin offering
[56:23] where that sin was carried in
[56:25] and forgiveness was obtained for every
[56:28] person in israel thank god
[56:30] that jesus did the great sin offering
[56:32] after he rose from the dead
[56:33] praise god the bible said he said mary
[56:36] touch me not i must have said to my
[56:37] father
[56:38] heaven must receive my sin offering
[56:41] praise god
[56:41] amen and then he come back and they
[56:43] could touch him and handle him
[56:45] but he first had to go and presented his
[56:47] body as a
[56:49] a sin offering for our day of atonement
[56:52] thank god
[56:53] resurrection was our day of atonement
[56:55] and 144 000 they're gonna have their day
[56:58] of atonement praise god when jesus shows
[57:00] himself to them
[57:01] and they repent of their sins they mourn
[57:03] from house to house remember the day of
[57:05] atonement
[57:05] it wasn't a feast it was a morning so
[57:08] there's not seven feasts there's five
[57:10] feasts right
[57:12] is the day of mourning where you mourned
[57:13] over your sin
[57:15] and and the blood of the blood of the
[57:18] the goat
[57:19] obtained complete forgiveness for the
[57:22] sinful soul
[57:24] so that's sin offering but remember you
[57:26] could do it whenever you wanted but
[57:27] there's a special day
[57:28] where that sid offering was magnified
[57:31] the day of atonement
[57:32] they were also on all five annual
[57:34] festivals they had those extra
[57:37] special sin offerings and also on the
[57:40] consecration of the priests
[57:42] they had special sin offerings as well
[57:46] all right fourth we have the trespass or
[57:49] guilt offering this was bloody and it's
[57:52] special
[57:53] it was only a ram you couldn't give a
[57:55] bullock you couldn't give flour
[57:57] no wine only a ram of course we know ram
[58:00] is a
[58:02] a male sheep right and who that
[58:04] represent jesus christ
[58:05] right so we had to specifically think of
[58:07] the the male sheep
[58:10] you could only do a ram on the trespass
[58:12] offering this is in leviticus 5. you can
[58:14] read it i read it this morning
[58:16] also i'm sorry leviticus 5 and all
[58:19] through
[58:19] 6 verse 7 and also numbers 5
[58:22] verses 5 through 8 and in this sacrifice
[58:26] you have the idea of
[58:28] sin debt
[58:32] and the the legislation or the legal
[58:35] aspect that
[58:36] you owe a debt right
[58:39] we know the bible talks about that in
[58:40] the new testament as well
[58:42] about a sin debt and jesus paid the
[58:44] ransom
[58:45] of our debt that we owed against god for
[58:48] our sins
[58:50] that's why it's beautiful that jesus
[58:51] came as a ransom because
[58:53] of this jesus came as a ram a ramson
[58:56] we could say like that he came as a
[58:58] ransom
[59:00] uh to pay the price for our
[59:03] intentional sins thank god the bible
[59:06] said
[59:06] remember in isaiah 53 that he's taken
[59:09] all of our iniquities praise god
[59:11] all of us had iniquity all of us had sin
[59:13] all of us
[59:14] purposely sinned against god at some
[59:16] point and still do
[59:18] when we fall short of god's glory we
[59:19] know it's wrong to get mad and say that
[59:21] we know it's wrong to judge
[59:22] this before that we know it's wrong to
[59:24] take that or say that
[59:26] or think that we know these things are
[59:27] wrong but we do it anyway
[59:29] but thank god there's only iran that can
[59:32] take care of that praise god hallelujah
[59:34] jesus christ the mayo sheep the lamb of
[59:37] god
[59:38] who takes away the sin of the world
[59:39] there's only one thing to think about
[59:40] with those sins
[59:42] the ram hallelujah
[59:45] ram pays our debts thank you jesus
[59:49] always a ram and it also says this is
[59:53] in uh special cases where sin was more
[59:56] private right it's something i did
[59:59] i know about it maybe i'm the only one
[1:00:01] who knows about it i need a ram for that
[1:00:03] situation
[1:00:04] praise god when some things are really
[1:00:06] personal to me
[1:00:07] church when they're personal to you we
[1:00:08] need a ram to stand in our place
[1:00:11] we need jesus christ in his power to
[1:00:14] stand in our place and take our sin
[1:00:16] our sin away our sin debt to just wash
[1:00:19] it all away thank god he legally
[1:00:21] takes it all the way the ram takes away
[1:00:24] all the legal
[1:00:25] aspect against us and we stand forgiven
[1:00:28] in the sight of god hallelujah
[1:00:30] thank you jesus praise god oh it's
[1:00:32] beautiful man these these are deeper
[1:00:34] this is deeper than i've ever gone into
[1:00:35] some of these uh or in all five of these
[1:00:38] offerings
[1:00:38] it's just beautiful only a ram
[1:00:42] can take those sins that we purposely do
[1:00:46] oh how we need jesus every hour praise
[1:00:48] god we just need him every hour
[1:00:50] fifth and finally there's the burnt
[1:00:52] offering saints
[1:00:54] and this was fiery and bloody
[1:00:58] uh the actual word means ascending so
[1:01:00] burnt is ascending
[1:01:03] and it was the most frequent form of
[1:01:06] sacrifice
[1:01:07] so the one you would your go-to
[1:01:09] sacrifice
[1:01:11] was lord i just i've given myself
[1:01:13] completely to you now doesn't that make
[1:01:15] sense
[1:01:16] because hopefully a real sincere jew
[1:01:18] wasn't purposely sinning all the time
[1:01:20] so thank god right thank god the
[1:01:22] trespass offering wasn't the most
[1:01:23] frequent one
[1:01:25] and if it is you got to go back to the
[1:01:27] sin offering and get saved
[1:01:29] or go back to the red heifer right so
[1:01:30] you can come and worship where it
[1:01:31] actually means something and you're
[1:01:32] actually clean right i think about that
[1:01:37] but this is the most uh the most
[1:01:40] often most frequent sacrifices god i
[1:01:43] just i just surrender everything god
[1:01:44] just
[1:01:46] i give all myself to you i give myself
[1:01:48] away lord use me here
[1:01:49] strengthen me help me
[1:01:52] and also me and it also was the only
[1:01:54] sacrifice that was completely
[1:01:56] burnt with all the other sacrifices
[1:02:00] some of it was eaten by the worshipper
[1:02:02] sometimes it was eaten by friends of the
[1:02:04] worshipper
[1:02:05] often it was eaten by the priests a lot
[1:02:06] of these were shared all of them were
[1:02:08] shared
[1:02:08] but not this one this was completely
[1:02:11] given to god
[1:02:12] praise god and that represents how we
[1:02:14] completely give ourselves to god there's
[1:02:16] some things
[1:02:18] that we reserve completely to god how
[1:02:20] many could say amen to that
[1:02:22] so anything related to jesus and this is
[1:02:23] important now because i'm thinking about
[1:02:25] jeffersonville
[1:02:26] but some things are reserved completely
[1:02:28] for jesus right
[1:02:30] he's the only one that's perfect he's
[1:02:32] the only one that has every word thus
[1:02:33] saith the lord right
[1:02:35] we we reserve praise for him we only
[1:02:38] we only worship jesus right we only we
[1:02:40] only
[1:02:41] uh magnify him we only exalt him we can
[1:02:44] honor people
[1:02:45] and give them respect but we reserve all
[1:02:48] worship
[1:02:49] for jesus christ that's why we got to be
[1:02:51] very careful
[1:02:52] all of our sacrifices and all of our
[1:02:54] worship
[1:02:55] only goes to jesus christ because this
[1:02:57] burnt offering is i'm fully devoted to
[1:02:59] jesus christ right
[1:03:02] yes yes we want to be we want to be uh
[1:03:05] we want to be faithful to our spouses
[1:03:07] and our home church and our friends and
[1:03:09] we want to be loyal right
[1:03:12] but this is saying a person is going to
[1:03:14] be fully committed to jesus christ they
[1:03:16] get all of the love
[1:03:18] all the attention all the submission
[1:03:20] right all the desires
[1:03:22] are given over to our lord jesus christ
[1:03:25] so hopefully that helps you now this is
[1:03:26] interesting the word burnt
[1:03:28] in burnt offering means ascending this
[1:03:30] is the ascending offering
[1:03:32] it's wholly consumed everything ascends
[1:03:35] up
[1:03:35] to god
[1:03:40] and it's the most frequent form of
[1:03:42] sacrifice in the lives of believers but
[1:03:44] also
[1:03:45] in the scripture in fact the very first
[1:03:47] sacrifices
[1:03:49] were burnt offerings by abel in genesis
[1:03:52] 3
[1:03:52] 4 rather genesis 4
[1:03:56] it's called a gift right the gift that
[1:03:59] he offered
[1:04:00] so burnt offerings were gifts i just
[1:04:02] want to give this to the lord i want to
[1:04:03] give everything
[1:04:04] all every part of this to the lord jesus
[1:04:08] uh noah gave birth offerings i'm sure
[1:04:10] you've with that in genesis 8
[1:04:12] 20 come out and he gave burnt offerings
[1:04:14] he just wanted to give gifts to god
[1:04:16] thank you that i'm not in that ark
[1:04:17] anymore
[1:04:18] right the gender watch knows ark this
[1:04:20] week
[1:04:22] the musical it's a really nice musical i
[1:04:23] didn't watch it but they said it's
[1:04:24] really good
[1:04:26] and so one of the bad they had battles
[1:04:28] inside the ark you know not knowing if
[1:04:29] they're going to live or survive and
[1:04:31] so when they got out praise god lord
[1:04:33] we're fully devoted to you and
[1:04:35] we're giving you all the praise nobody
[1:04:37] ate of that it was all just given to god
[1:04:40] they were so thankful they just said god
[1:04:41] i've given you this gift it's all for
[1:04:43] your glory
[1:04:44] praise god then you see abraham
[1:04:48] do burn offerings in genesis 22. oh yeah
[1:04:51] that's what that's what isaac would have
[1:04:52] been he would have been a burnt offering
[1:04:55] and so we had to have a burnt offering
[1:04:56] that took isaac's place
[1:04:58] jesus christ our burnt offering praise
[1:05:00] god
[1:05:01] jehovah jireh i will jehovah will
[1:05:03] provide himself
[1:05:04] a sacrifice praise god
[1:05:12] now there's a lot on burnt offerings the
[1:05:15] bible said the tabernacle gave a
[1:05:16] continual burnt offering and that's a
[1:05:18] beautiful picture
[1:05:19] we continually give all of our will to
[1:05:21] god right
[1:05:22] that will do all the will of god we live
[1:05:24] by every word
[1:05:26] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:05:29] there's a burst
[1:05:30] offering on every sabbath and
[1:05:35] every sabbath there was a double burn
[1:05:37] offering so that uh
[1:05:38] so a double expression right i'm fully
[1:05:40] devoted to you and that's kind of what
[1:05:42] we do right we give
[1:05:43] we give god the sabbath day our sunday
[1:05:45] we just give more
[1:05:46] of ourselves that day we give extra
[1:05:50] sacrifice extra surrender to the lord
[1:05:52] jesus christ
[1:05:53] there was a burnt offering of every
[1:05:55] month so every month they made a special
[1:05:57] uh worship thank you lord for another
[1:05:59] month it's a gift i'm giving you a gift
[1:06:01] because you got me through another
[1:06:03] month and they gave special burnt
[1:06:06] offerings at pen
[1:06:07] at passover pentecost trumpets and
[1:06:10] atoms it looks like every uh feast or
[1:06:13] holy day
[1:06:18] also uh these would be called free will
[1:06:20] burnt offerings as leviticus 1 talks
[1:06:22] about
[1:06:25] solomon gave many at his uh dedication
[1:06:28] of the tabernacle in first chronicles
[1:06:31] and when hezekiah reformed the church
[1:06:34] remember he was 25
[1:06:35] and his dad died and he he rebuilt
[1:06:38] he he renovated the the church the doors
[1:06:42] the temple
[1:06:44] burn all the all the idols the bible
[1:06:46] said they gave
[1:06:47] multitudes of burnt offerings so it's
[1:06:50] like a fresh expression of god you're
[1:06:51] taking all of our thoughts
[1:06:53] you're getting all my time you're
[1:06:54] getting all my love you're getting all
[1:06:56] my worship
[1:06:57] saints let's keep giving god all of our
[1:06:59] worship let's keep giving a continual
[1:07:01] burn offering unto god god consume more
[1:07:03] of me
[1:07:04] take more of me i'm fully devoted to you
[1:07:07] i'm not devoted to this world i've got
[1:07:08] to live with the world i've got to abide
[1:07:10] by the laws
[1:07:11] but i'm fully devoted to jesus christ
[1:07:12] above all
[1:07:15] so these offerings signify the complete
[1:07:17] dedication of the offers
[1:07:20] to god and the dictionary says this is
[1:07:23] what paul refers to
[1:07:25] in romans 12 1 he said present your
[1:07:28] bodies a living sacrifice
[1:07:31] for it's your reasonable service so
[1:07:34] right so uh
[1:07:36] since burnt offerings were the most
[1:07:39] often sacrificed in a person's life
[1:07:42] um you know the the dictionary writers
[1:07:46] uh recognizing if we're going to give
[1:07:48] ourselves daily
[1:07:49] uh to renew our minds then it's like
[1:07:52] we're doing
[1:07:52] a burnt offering to god we're completely
[1:07:55] giving our minds over right
[1:07:56] we're completely yielding our bodies
[1:07:58] we're we're limiting our movements right
[1:08:00] we're being still
[1:08:02] and knowing that he's god we're just
[1:08:03] bringing everything to a focus
[1:08:06] on the lord jesus christ and saying i'm
[1:08:08] completely dedicated to you lord
[1:08:10] and i'm giving you myself i'm giving you
[1:08:13] my mind my body my soul i'm giving
[1:08:16] everything to you
[1:08:17] i present my body a living sacrifice
[1:08:19] transform my mind
[1:08:20] let me think your thoughts let my
[1:08:22] thoughts be illuminated with the
[1:08:24] knowledge of god
[1:08:25] hallelujah praise god now
[1:08:29] now here's why i want my children to get
[1:08:30] their bible so can you guys can you
[1:08:33] ladies and gentlemen because zion's not
[1:08:35] in here
[1:08:36] can you get your bibles here
[1:08:42] uh lydia can you do exodus 25
[1:08:45] 6 maokai exodus 30 verse 7.
[1:08:49] now i want to um kind of move off those
[1:08:52] five sacrifices and just look generally
[1:08:54] now at the scriptures about
[1:08:56] sweet smelling odors in the old
[1:08:58] testament okay
[1:09:00] because they're all those all those
[1:09:02] sacrifices those five plus
[1:09:04] no doubt the red heifer
[1:09:07] no doubt all of them were by fire and we
[1:09:09] know they were all sweet smell
[1:09:12] a savor unto the lord but let's look at
[1:09:15] other scriptures and other things that
[1:09:18] are attached to the sweet smell in the
[1:09:21] nostrils of the lord
[1:09:23] so we know um the first one is genesis
[1:09:26] 8. we're not going to read that but
[1:09:27] noah's burnt offerings the bible said
[1:09:29] they went up as a sweet smelling savor
[1:09:32] unto the lord okay so burn offerings so
[1:09:35] you know church
[1:09:36] when you're fully dedicating yourself
[1:09:39] when you are
[1:09:40] completely being dedicated and asking
[1:09:42] god to renew your mind and you're
[1:09:44] presenting your body of sacrifice
[1:09:46] then you know it's a sweet smell in the
[1:09:49] nostrils of god
[1:09:50] amen that should be every day praise god
[1:09:53] every day
[1:09:54] every morning it should be a sweet smell
[1:09:56] as you
[1:09:57] you humble yourself you quiet yourself
[1:09:59] you get before the lord
[1:10:01] worship him love him serve him say god
[1:10:04] just take this time and
[1:10:05] and unite my heart to yours when you do
[1:10:08] that it's a sweet smelling savor unto
[1:10:11] the lord
[1:10:11] praise god so that's the first one
[1:10:15] mentioned of sweet smelling savor
[1:10:18] uh so lydia now these two that lydia
[1:10:21] malek are going to read are by
[1:10:23] prayer okay so obviously you know you
[1:10:26] could you would attach
[1:10:27] prayer into your five offerings right
[1:10:29] you would be praying and
[1:10:31] talking to the lord and thanking him and
[1:10:33] asking for forgiveness
[1:10:35] so lydia exodus 25 6.
[1:10:42] oil for the light spices for anointing
[1:10:44] island for sweet incense
[1:10:46] all right and for sweet incense praise
[1:10:48] god of course this is for the
[1:10:50] tabernacle so sweet notice sweet
[1:10:53] well how do you know incense is sweet
[1:10:55] you gotta smell it it's a sweet smell
[1:10:56] it's not to be eaten
[1:10:58] it's to be burnt so this is speaking of
[1:11:01] sweet smell
[1:11:02] and that would be used for burning in
[1:11:04] the holy place
[1:11:06] so malachi exodus 30 verse 7
[1:11:10] and aaron shall burn there on sweet
[1:11:12] incense every morning when he dresses
[1:11:14] the lamps you shall burn incense upon it
[1:11:16] amen every morning aaron was supposed to
[1:11:18] burn the incense represented
[1:11:20] every morning prayer hallelujah and it
[1:11:22] was sweet smelling savor
[1:11:24] unto the lord but there's got to be fire
[1:11:26] into it it's got to have all the
[1:11:27] ingredients right
[1:11:29] and it's got to be offered every day and
[1:11:31] that comes up as a sweet smelling savor
[1:11:34] unto the lord now
[1:11:39] lydia can you get leviticus 26 31.
[1:11:43] now before she reads leviticus 26 31
[1:11:45] another one
[1:11:46] is exodus 30 verses 28 through 38
[1:11:50] where god lists all the ingredients for
[1:11:52] the holy anointing oil
[1:11:54] which the bible says when that was put
[1:11:56] on when that anointing was put on
[1:11:58] it was a sweet smelling savor unto the
[1:12:00] lord oh my so do you see it
[1:12:02] and all these acts of worship whether we
[1:12:05] we're dedicating our mind to the lord
[1:12:07] whether we're praying by the holy spirit
[1:12:09] whether we're just anointed by god right
[1:12:12] just anointed for service it's all a
[1:12:15] sweet smell into the lord
[1:12:17] so if you say oh i feel anointed the
[1:12:18] holy spirit that's a sweet smell
[1:12:21] hallelujah god receives that worship
[1:12:24] when we're walking in the spirit when
[1:12:26] you feel the anointing when we're
[1:12:28] singing at church and worshiping and we
[1:12:29] feel the spirit of god
[1:12:31] and we're praising the lord and that's a
[1:12:34] sweet smelling sacrifice unto the lord
[1:12:36] so
[1:12:37] now we can see how singing and praying
[1:12:39] and offering sacrifices
[1:12:42] is all a sweet smell of savor unto god
[1:12:45] so leviticus lydia 26 31 this shows the
[1:12:48] negative aspect of
[1:12:49] false worship and i will make your
[1:12:51] city's waste and bring your sanctuaries
[1:12:53] into desolation and i will not smell the
[1:12:55] savor of your sweet odors
[1:12:57] okay now this is a warning in leviticus
[1:13:00] 26 31
[1:13:01] that god's not gonna smell sweet savers
[1:13:05] even if they offer it so if they disobey
[1:13:09] god
[1:13:09] and if they're disobedient god's not
[1:13:12] going to smell it so no matter how much
[1:13:13] they burn or how many animals they're
[1:13:15] wholly consumed
[1:13:16] how many offerings god only sweat or
[1:13:19] smells
[1:13:20] sweet odors of obedience so god lays
[1:13:23] this in there now of course this will
[1:13:24] bring up the scriptures about
[1:13:26] obedience is greater than what sacrifice
[1:13:29] sacrifice
[1:13:30] so these all these all these sacrifices
[1:13:32] were just outward
[1:13:34] expressions of the inward inward grace
[1:13:37] that had been received in the heart
[1:13:39] okay that's a great scripture all the
[1:13:42] way now this is early right this is
[1:13:43] early with the law
[1:13:45] leviticus 26 is early in the law and god
[1:13:48] is already saying here he's warning them
[1:13:50] if you don't obey it doesn't matter
[1:13:54] how much sweet incense comes up or how
[1:13:58] all the
[1:13:58] all the fires that you make and all
[1:14:00] these acts of worship
[1:14:02] your worship is meaningless he said
[1:14:04] unless your heart's in it with obedience
[1:14:06] so may god help us to obey the word of
[1:14:08] god it'll be a sweet smelling savor unto
[1:14:11] the lord here's another one this is a
[1:14:14] great
[1:14:15] portion malachi hosea six four please
[1:14:20] hosea six four
[1:14:26] two
[1:14:33] hosea six four you can go to
[1:14:36] hosea six as well daniel joseph
[1:14:46] so find jeremiah isaiah ezekiel

[1:14:57] couple of those

[1:15:02] course the days of hosea

[1:15:06] i don't have my uh scofield bible to
[1:15:08] give you the exact dates
[1:15:10] oh yeah malcolm what's the date on jose
[1:15:12] there we go it's
[1:15:13] at the top of the page there's a date
[1:15:17] okay so 780 bc 780 all right
[1:15:22] this is uh 300 years or 200 years after
[1:15:24] david to give you
[1:15:26] a kind of a clue there
[1:15:29] this would be about like 800 years after
[1:15:31] moses so 800 years
[1:15:33] or so after moses hosea is given the
[1:15:36] word of the lord
[1:15:38] and this is what he says about
[1:15:39] sacrifices and sweet smelling sabers
[1:15:41] it's malachi i'll read verses 4 5 6
[1:15:45] oh ephraim what shall i do unto thee o
[1:15:47] judah what shall i do unto thee
[1:15:49] for your goodness is as a morning cloud
[1:15:51] and as the early deal goes away
[1:15:53] therefore i few them by the prophets and
[1:15:55] i slain them by the words of my mouth
[1:15:57] and my
[1:15:58] judgments are as the light that goeth
[1:15:59] forth for i desired mercy and not
[1:16:02] sacrificed the knowledge of god more
[1:16:03] than burnt offerings
[1:16:05] amen now let's stop right there what a
[1:16:07] powerful scripture here
[1:16:09] god says your goodness is evaporated
[1:16:12] like the dew in the morning
[1:16:15] right that's what he says in verse 1.
[1:16:17] and then look at verse 5. look what
[1:16:20] prophets they're hewn out they're
[1:16:22] chopped down or cut out they're cut out
[1:16:24] of the blessings of god
[1:16:25] by prophets right there's 40 minutes man
[1:16:32] let me do a few more minutes by god's
[1:16:33] grace so look at what prophets part of
[1:16:36] the job of a prophet is to speak the
[1:16:38] word
[1:16:38] but if the people disobey it's like
[1:16:40] chopping a tree and
[1:16:42] uh the wood that falls out are the
[1:16:44] unbelievers
[1:16:45] right so the prophet when they don't
[1:16:48] he preaches it when they don't receive
[1:16:50] it the people are cut down
[1:16:52] their their spiritual life is stopped
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:58] look at this i've slain them by the
[1:17:00] words of my mouth
[1:17:02] yet we know a lot of them are still
[1:17:03] living right so this is a spiritual
[1:17:05] cutting right this is a spiritual death
[1:17:08] these people are not alive spiritually
[1:17:10] they're dead spiritually they don't have
[1:17:11] faith
[1:17:12] they're walking in unbelief what what
[1:17:14] does that
[1:17:15] god's word it's god's word either brings
[1:17:17] life it brings blessing
[1:17:19] or brings death curse
[1:17:22] and he said my judgments are light of
[1:17:24] course exposing the darkness
[1:17:27] right but the darkness comprehendeth not
[1:17:30] look at verse six i desired mercy god
[1:17:33] desired mercy
[1:17:34] and not sacrifice and the knowledge of
[1:17:37] god
[1:17:38] more than burnt offerings see israel was
[1:17:41] still you know 800 years after moses
[1:17:43] they're still doing
[1:17:44] all these burnt offerings but god said i
[1:17:46] want you to live good lives
[1:17:48] right i don't want your goodness to
[1:17:50] leave
[1:17:51] he said i want you to continue all day
[1:17:54] serving me with a good heart and i
[1:17:57] desire you have mercy
[1:17:59] and not so much sacrifice they were good
[1:18:02] about the sacrifice in part
[1:18:04] another i said like this they were good
[1:18:06] about going to church but they weren't
[1:18:08] good
[1:18:09] about living it all throughout the day
[1:18:14] see the knowledge of god more than burnt
[1:18:16] offerings
[1:18:17] so god wanted them to understand god's
[1:18:19] merciful heart his loving heart rather
[1:18:21] than just
[1:18:21] well god said do this now it's time for
[1:18:23] trespass offering now it's time for sin
[1:18:25] offering now it's time for burnt
[1:18:26] offering
[1:18:28] they have the wrong attitude right they
[1:18:30] they weren't really worshiping god and
[1:18:32] obeying him from the heart
[1:18:35] we say they had bad hearts right because
[1:18:36] he said your goodness is evaporated
[1:18:38] okay so haven you can you read verse
[1:18:41] seven and eight try those
[1:18:44] isaiah six seven but they were like men
[1:18:48] that just get
[1:18:49] trespassed the covenant
[1:18:53] have they deal treacherously against me
[1:18:58] julia gilead is a city of them that work
[1:19:01] iniquity and is polluted with blood
[1:19:05] great stop right there so now god tells
[1:19:07] us why
[1:19:08] they've rejected god's mercy because
[1:19:11] they're transgressing the covenant
[1:19:12] they're breaking the covenant
[1:19:14] and they work iniquity that's when the
[1:19:16] that's the worst title someone could
[1:19:18] have
[1:19:18] is a worker of iniquity they
[1:19:20] specifically want to do works
[1:19:22] that transgress against the word of god
[1:19:25] right you were either workers of
[1:19:26] righteousness or workers of iniquity
[1:19:29] jesus said woe to the workers of
[1:19:30] iniquity he said i never knew you depart
[1:19:32] from me
[1:19:34] what do they do they they're spoiled
[1:19:35] with blood so they actually
[1:19:37] kill people physically right or their
[1:19:39] words we'd say kill people's character
[1:19:43] look at verse nine and as troops of
[1:19:45] robbers wait for a man so the company a
[1:19:46] priest
[1:19:47] murder in the way by consent these were
[1:19:49] evil leaders
[1:19:51] they put people to death i don't know if
[1:19:52] you saw this week but our
[1:19:54] current president signed more
[1:19:56] legislation supporting abortions
[1:19:58] overseas
[1:20:00] so just increasing death that's what
[1:20:02] this administration does increasing
[1:20:04] death now the
[1:20:05] previous administration didn't do really
[1:20:07] anything to get rid of it
[1:20:08] nor the supreme court but the point is
[1:20:12] death they love death
[1:20:15] and the bible says they commit lewdness
[1:20:19] so look at all these sins transgressions
[1:20:21] iniquity
[1:20:22] blood murdering now lunus is their
[1:20:25] sexuality
[1:20:26] verse 10 i've seen a horrible thing in
[1:20:28] the house of israel there is the
[1:20:30] whoredom of ephraim
[1:20:31] israel is defiled
[1:20:34] so basically showing all these sexual
[1:20:36] sins all these all this anger this
[1:20:38] murdering spirit the transgressions all
[1:20:41] of these
[1:20:43] are bad in the sight of god right and so
[1:20:46] it doesn't matter how much
[1:20:47] sacrifice how many religious acts you do
[1:20:49] all five or all six of those sacrifices
[1:20:52] if you count the red heifer
[1:20:53] it didn't matter what you what you did
[1:20:54] god didn't desire sacrifice
[1:20:56] so much as he wanted obedience he won
[1:20:58] the sacrifice of your will
[1:21:01] praise god god said i desire
[1:21:05] mercy not sacrifice and the knowledge of
[1:21:08] god
[1:21:09] more than burnt offerings
[1:21:17] okay we're getting close here oh a
[1:21:20] little bit further
[1:21:21] now that's all the scriptures that say
[1:21:23] sweet smelling savor in the old
[1:21:25] testament hard to believe
[1:21:26] but that's that's all there are let's
[1:21:28] look at some in the new testament
[1:21:32] let's go to second corinthians 2 14 and
[1:21:34] 15. i'll have lydia do that one
[1:21:37] malachi go to second corinthians
[1:21:40] eight one
[1:21:44] then haven can you go to ephesians five
[1:21:48] two if you got your bible sorry acacia
[1:21:50] ephesians five two thank you
[1:21:57] this is just i mean some of these are
[1:21:58] just beautiful scriptures uh they're
[1:22:00] just showing how our lives are
[1:22:02] continually
[1:22:03] it's kind of it's just kind of like
[1:22:03] we're a continual offering right we're
[1:22:05] we're a continual
[1:22:07] burnt offering unto the lord right it's
[1:22:08] just a continual sweet smelling savor
[1:22:10] our whole lives
[1:22:12] as we obey as we stand under the
[1:22:14] anointing of the holy spirit as we
[1:22:15] repent daily
[1:22:16] and try to follow god our lives are just
[1:22:19] continually
[1:22:20] we're just offering off this aroma in
[1:22:22] the
[1:22:23] in the nostrils of god and god is very
[1:22:25] well pleased by it of course
[1:22:27] you know we're his bride right we please
[1:22:29] him
[1:22:30] and so it's a it's a pleasing thing
[1:22:34] uh in the senses of god
[1:22:37] so yeah lydia corinthians
[1:22:40] 2 verses 14 and 15.
[1:22:44] now thanks be unto god which it which
[1:22:46] always causes us to triumph in christ
[1:22:49] and make it manifest the savior of his
[1:22:51] knowledge by us
[1:22:52] in every place for we are unto god a
[1:22:54] sweet savor of christ and then that are
[1:22:56] saved and then the perish
[1:22:58] wow isn't that beautiful the bible says
[1:23:01] we manifest or we
[1:23:03] make visible the knowledge
[1:23:06] of god and we are a sweet smelling
[1:23:08] sacrifice
[1:23:10] unto the lord unto all those that are
[1:23:12] saved did you catch that he said
[1:23:14] the next verse actually says if they're
[1:23:16] not saved it's not a sweet smell to them
[1:23:19] in other words whenever you're around a
[1:23:20] christian group
[1:23:22] you'll just love it because it's the
[1:23:23] same smell
[1:23:25] it's not a putrified smell right it's
[1:23:27] not a displeasing smell
[1:23:30] so children and myself all the adults we
[1:23:33] are
[1:23:34] a continual sweet smelling sacrifice
[1:23:36] unto god when we
[1:23:38] this is this deals with witnessing did
[1:23:39] you see that when we speak god's
[1:23:41] knowledge
[1:23:42] so when we witness like i got to witness
[1:23:43] this guy at work today just a little bit
[1:23:45] about that revelation with joshua how
[1:23:49] lord willing i'm preaching on joshua
[1:23:50] here pretty soon but joshua
[1:23:52] was getting ready to attack jericho
[1:23:56] and uh the angel lord came to him the
[1:23:58] captain of the lord's host
[1:23:59] and he's got a sword drawn and he's
[1:24:01] ready to fight you know he got us drawn
[1:24:03] ready for battle and joshua said are you
[1:24:05] on our side or their side and he said
[1:24:07] neither he said nay
[1:24:11] and that tells us that joshua had to
[1:24:14] learn
[1:24:15] god's not on my side i've got to stay on
[1:24:17] god's side
[1:24:18] right this is not my war this is not my
[1:24:20] battle the battle belongs to the lord
[1:24:22] praise god
[1:24:24] and so that just i was just witnessing
[1:24:26] that to that brother and
[1:24:28] he's a christian but i'm just witnessing
[1:24:32] to that and you know
[1:24:32] according to the scripture when we
[1:24:34] witness and talk about god's knowledge
[1:24:36] the bible said we just put off this
[1:24:38] sweet smell
[1:24:39] and if they're a christian they're gonna
[1:24:41] like that smell praise god
[1:24:44] we manifest it you and i manifest a good
[1:24:46] smell now in the natural sometimes we
[1:24:48] smell good sometimes
[1:24:49] we may not smell too good but in the
[1:24:52] spiritual
[1:24:53] we are supposed to smell so good that
[1:24:56] we're manifesting a pleasing
[1:24:58] atmosphere we're creating an atmosphere
[1:25:00] amongst the saints and amongst our
[1:25:02] family and
[1:25:02] wherever we go we are revealing
[1:25:06] the nature of god right the smell of god
[1:25:08] we'd say the presence of god the holy
[1:25:10] anointing oil of god
[1:25:12] our lives just emitted right we just
[1:25:15] emit that smell uh because we are
[1:25:19] a living sacrifice amen we're our hearts
[1:25:22] are burning did not our hearts
[1:25:23] burn as we talk with him along the way
[1:25:25] praise god we're just constantly burning
[1:25:29] and giving off the aroma of the holy
[1:25:32] spirit
[1:25:33] praise god america is in corinthians
[1:25:36] eight can you read verses
[1:25:37] one and five right now
[1:25:40] yeah one let's get down to five
[1:25:43] moreover brethren we do you to it of the
[1:25:46] grace of god but sterling churches in
[1:25:48] macedonia
[1:25:49] and this they did not as we hope but
[1:25:51] first gave up gave
[1:25:52] their own selves to the lord and unto us
[1:25:54] by the will of god
[1:25:57] great now do you get yet we looked at
[1:25:58] this last week paul's
[1:26:00] kind of emphasizing to the church in
[1:26:03] corinth that these philippians were very
[1:26:05] generous
[1:26:05] and the way they did it they first gave
[1:26:07] themselves to god does that sound
[1:26:08] familiar like a
[1:26:09] burnt offering they're wholly consumed
[1:26:11] they had to give all of themselves all
[1:26:13] their thinking
[1:26:14] all their time all their possessions
[1:26:16] they had to see all my possessions are
[1:26:18] actually god's
[1:26:19] because he gave them to me and then when
[1:26:22] you give yourself to god
[1:26:23] then god will lead you to give to other
[1:26:26] people
[1:26:27] okay now the beautiful scriptures here
[1:26:29] um
[1:26:30] they're all beautiful not so hard but
[1:26:32] now let's go to chapter nine second
[1:26:33] corinthians nine
[1:26:38] and i'm going to turn there too because
[1:26:39] i i just wrote down a couple
[1:26:45] okay maokai can you read 9 6 and 7.
[1:26:50] with this i say he would so sparingly
[1:26:52] shall reap also sparingly and he which
[1:26:54] soweth bountifully shall repost about
[1:26:56] his fleas
[1:26:57] every man according as he proposes in
[1:26:59] his heart so let him give not grudge
[1:27:02] or of necessity for god love is the
[1:27:04] cheerful giver amen so paul continues in
[1:27:06] the next chapter
[1:27:07] to tell the corinth uh corinthians this
[1:27:10] is how you grow in becoming a giver
[1:27:11] you've got to decide in your heart
[1:27:13] you've got to pray and decide in your
[1:27:14] heart
[1:27:15] and give whatever is
[1:27:18] upon your heart that's what you give and
[1:27:20] that's that's right right you give
[1:27:22] whatever sacrifice of those five in the
[1:27:24] old testament you would give whichever
[1:27:25] sacrifice
[1:27:26] was on your heart at that time whether
[1:27:28] it was a thank offering or guilt
[1:27:29] offering or
[1:27:30] whatever one it was you give that one
[1:27:32] that's on your heart and paul says this
[1:27:34] is how we give unto god
[1:27:35] we've got to see what god has placed
[1:27:37] upon our hearts
[1:27:40] and also he gives the law too if you
[1:27:42] only give a little bit of
[1:27:43] sacrifice god's not going to give much
[1:27:45] to you right
[1:27:46] you're only going to get what you give
[1:27:48] out so i'm thankful praise god
[1:27:51] thankful that we can keep giving to
[1:27:53] others and then god will make sure it
[1:27:54] comes back to us
[1:27:56] finances and our food and everything we
[1:27:58] have are seeds right and we can either
[1:28:00] keep them
[1:28:01] we can all keep them to ourselves or we
[1:28:03] can spread them out
[1:28:05] if we spread them out what's going to
[1:28:06] happen when you spread out your seeds
[1:28:08] this this spring what's going to happen
[1:28:10] they're going to grow you're going to
[1:28:11] get some fruit right are you guaranteed
[1:28:14] probably yeah unless there's like an
[1:28:15] awful
[1:28:17] winter storm or something like that or
[1:28:18] there's a dearth right you're guaranteed
[1:28:20] unless something awful happens
[1:28:22] you're guaranteed but let me tell you
[1:28:23] god as the gardeners much
[1:28:25] and as the great sender of all the types
[1:28:27] of
[1:28:28] weather he's going to water those seeds
[1:28:30] praise god he's going to make sure this
[1:28:32] the sun shines on him the water the soil
[1:28:36] so keep giving and then god will give it
[1:28:38] back to you the bible says that
[1:28:40] if you just do a few seeds you just get
[1:28:42] a little bit of fruit but if you give
[1:28:43] lots of seeds you get lots of fruit back
[1:28:46] praise god this is the lesson he's
[1:28:48] trying to teach remember we talked about
[1:28:49] that last week lord i want to grow in
[1:28:50] this i want to grow in faith i want to
[1:28:52] grow into utterance
[1:28:53] i want to grow in giving this is how you
[1:28:54] grow in giving
[1:28:56] you first give yourself to god you pray
[1:28:59] whatever's on your heart just give
[1:29:00] that's why it's good to practice
[1:29:01] continual giving
[1:29:03] now with our churches he's it's already
[1:29:04] set up ties and offerings but then we
[1:29:06] should also
[1:29:07] give other things too we'd also also
[1:29:10] should get in the habit of giving
[1:29:11] more money or giving food or giving of
[1:29:13] our time or giving prayer
[1:29:15] giving more of ourselves because
[1:29:16] whatever we plant that's what will reap
[1:29:20] now we get a beautiful uh
[1:29:23] a beautiful teaching in here as well
[1:29:28] now the bible in verse 10 says when they
[1:29:30] give they get back the fruits of
[1:29:32] righteousness
[1:29:34] so how many want to be righteous you got
[1:29:36] to plant seeds
[1:29:37] right you're the seeds of your sacrifice
[1:29:39] the seeds of your giving
[1:29:41] when you give seeds you get back fruits
[1:29:44] of righteousness
[1:29:49] now look at verse 11 being enrich in
[1:29:51] everything to all bountifulness
[1:29:53] which causes through us thanksgiving to
[1:29:57] god so did you get yet
[1:29:58] when we give out to others people give
[1:30:01] thanks to god
[1:30:03] right so when you give money or of your
[1:30:04] time or food or clothes or something
[1:30:06] that someone needs
[1:30:08] they'll they'll sit there and praise god
[1:30:10] and god gets praised
[1:30:12] because you obeyed his spirit right he
[1:30:15] led you to do it
[1:30:16] the people get it and they give god
[1:30:18] praise so god leads the giving
[1:30:20] and then god gets the praise for the
[1:30:21] giving
[1:30:23] he's behind it all he's he's just trying
[1:30:25] to do this great cycle of giving and
[1:30:26] receiving in worship right
[1:30:28] he leads you to give and give thanks god
[1:30:31] gets that then he leads you to this
[1:30:32] it's all god getting all the glory
[1:30:34] because the bible said it's
[1:30:36] everything is in christ and everything
[1:30:38] is through christ right
[1:30:39] we don't do anything for ourselves it's
[1:30:41] all from god and it all goes to god
[1:30:47] look at verse 12. this i'm just going to
[1:30:49] read this this this chapter is so
[1:30:50] beautiful i may
[1:30:51] have to stop here verse 12 for the
[1:30:53] administration of this service
[1:30:56] our giving is a service not only
[1:30:59] supplieth the want of the saints
[1:31:01] but is abundant also by many
[1:31:02] thanksgivings unto god
[1:31:05] so see the more we give the more people
[1:31:07] give god thanks
[1:31:09] while by the experiment of this
[1:31:11] administration they glorify
[1:31:12] god for your professed subjection unto
[1:31:15] the gospel
[1:31:16] of christ and for your liberal
[1:31:18] distribution
[1:31:19] unto them and to all men
[1:31:23] so see people will glorify god when they
[1:31:25] say wow
[1:31:26] jesse gave this money or kristen gave
[1:31:29] this money or lydia or whoever it is
[1:31:30] malachi
[1:31:32] they're going to glorify god they're
[1:31:34] going to oh god you're so good you put
[1:31:36] it on their heart
[1:31:37] thank you for meeting my need
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:43] but we've got to be liberal we've got to
[1:31:45] be givers we've got to be
[1:31:47] thoughtful about other people
[1:31:50] and also look at verse 14 and by their
[1:31:52] prayer for you
[1:31:53] which long after you for the exceeding
[1:31:57] grace of god
[1:31:58] in you then verse 15
[1:32:01] thanks be unto god for his unspeakable
[1:32:05] gift now look at this there's the bible
[1:32:07] says there's one
[1:32:08] unspeakable gift that's god
[1:32:12] jesus christ we'd say is god's
[1:32:14] unspeakable gift because he didn't say
[1:32:16] gifts right he said gift
[1:32:20] so what is the unspeakable gift jesus
[1:32:22] christ
[1:32:23] it's jesus christ and his leadership
[1:32:25] right his ways
[1:32:27] the unspeakable gift is jesus christ
[1:32:29] leading you to give
[1:32:30] and then people give god glory people
[1:32:32] give jesus glory that you gave
[1:32:34] and then they can give right and then
[1:32:36] they can give to others and it
[1:32:37] keeps this beautiful cycle going of
[1:32:39] giving and supplying need and
[1:32:41] caring for others it's a cycle of love
[1:32:44] thank god
[1:32:45] for the unspeakable gift of jesus christ
[1:32:48] and his love
[1:32:50] praise god this is beautiful hallelujah
[1:32:53] so he has unsearchable riches of christ
[1:32:55] that we preach
[1:32:57] and jesus christ is also the unspeakable
[1:32:59] gift unsearchable riches
[1:33:00] from the unspeakable gift of jesus
[1:33:03] christ
[1:33:04] oh it's beautiful can't quite you can't
[1:33:07] even scratch the surface of it so great
[1:33:12] because remember many people will praise
[1:33:14] god for your sacrifices
[1:33:16] when you sacrifice and give something to
[1:33:18] other one
[1:33:19] the bible said they'll glorify god on
[1:33:21] your behalf
[1:33:22] and thank god for this opportunity that
[1:33:24] he gives us to help out other people
[1:33:26] hope our minds are thinking about lord
[1:33:28] who can i help
[1:33:30] lord help me to have an open heart who
[1:33:32] can i help out just a little bit if it's
[1:33:34] i can't do everything but the bible says
[1:33:36] help me to have a heart
[1:33:39] uh that can be moved by god because god
[1:33:41] loves
[1:33:42] what kind of a giver cheerful
[1:33:45] give it in a in a happy state
[1:33:49] give it with a smile on your face give
[1:33:50] it with uh join your heart knowing that
[1:33:53] god is going to be praised through this
[1:33:55] like i said i've
[1:33:57] of the times god has led me to give i
[1:33:58] don't think i had only maybe one or two
[1:34:00] people that have ever turned down the
[1:34:01] money really
[1:34:02] almost everybody they may say they don't
[1:34:04] want it but eventually they need it you
[1:34:05] know
[1:34:07] so many times it's god leading you to do
[1:34:11] uh cheerful giving and that will cause
[1:34:13] other people to glorify god
[1:34:17] all right haven uh i'm sorry yeah keisha
[1:34:19] uh moving on ephesians five verse two
[1:34:23] and walk in love as christ also has
[1:34:26] loved us
[1:34:27] and has given himself for us an offering
[1:34:30] and a sacrifice to god for a sweet
[1:34:32] smelling savor
[1:34:33] amen paul says jesus christ gave himself
[1:34:37] to god for us in love that's where it is
[1:34:40] right there praise god
[1:34:41] jesus is our example and the bible said
[1:34:45] jesus's offering was a sweet smelling
[1:34:47] sacrifice and
[1:34:48] savor unto the lord and that kind of
[1:34:52] goes with what we've been preaching on
[1:34:53] wednesdays about
[1:34:54] husbands love your wives amen praise god
[1:34:57] hallelujah boy it just ties the whole
[1:34:59] bible together
[1:35:00] glory that means in your home husbands
[1:35:02] when you're loving your wives
[1:35:04] you are emitting or you're burning and
[1:35:07] this
[1:35:07] incense is just going up towards god
[1:35:10] amen and sisters when you obey your
[1:35:13] husbands and everything godly
[1:35:15] your hearts are burning and there's
[1:35:17] coming up this great sweet smelling
[1:35:19] savor incense unto god hallelujah
[1:35:23] whether we're praying or not at that
[1:35:24] point right because the bible says when
[1:35:26] we manifest
[1:35:26] god's love and his spirit our lives are
[1:35:29] just this continual
[1:35:30] sweet smelling savor burning and and uh
[1:35:34] letting the smoke of worship and
[1:35:37] the holy spirit's anointing just come up
[1:35:39] before god and god
[1:35:40] smells it and is well pleased praise god
[1:35:43] all that does not tie the whole thing
[1:35:44] together praise god
[1:35:46] jesus gave himself as a burnt offering a
[1:35:48] sweet smelling savor out of love
[1:35:50] and husbands love your wives in other
[1:35:53] words our house is like a sanctuary
[1:35:55] praise god right
[1:35:56] it's like the old testament holy place
[1:35:58] and constantly
[1:35:59] and of course then you take the incense
[1:36:01] into the holiest of holies right so it's
[1:36:03] the old testament
[1:36:05] uh in a figure it's like an old
[1:36:06] testament tabernacle
[1:36:08] where we have justification
[1:36:09] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:36:11] ghost and our lives are burning
[1:36:13] for the with the love of god and it's
[1:36:15] omitting this beautiful smell this
[1:36:17] beautiful
[1:36:18] atmosphere of the holy spirit
[1:36:21] praise god a couple more here
[1:36:30] okay first peter 2 5 we're not going to
[1:36:34] read it but
[1:36:34] peter says we are a holy priesthood unto
[1:36:37] god offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:36:40] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[1:36:44] who were what was the office of the
[1:36:45] people that offered sacrifices
[1:36:47] it starts with the p priests
[1:36:50] priests so how do you know you're a
[1:36:53] priest you're offering sacrifices
[1:36:55] and there's all kinds right like we said
[1:36:57] with prayer
[1:36:58] with giving money giving food giving
[1:37:01] clothes
[1:37:02] there's all kinds of sacrifices that's
[1:37:05] how you know you're a priest you're
[1:37:07] constantly
[1:37:08] feeling how god is leading you and with
[1:37:10] a cheerful heart you give
[1:37:12] sacrifices unto god hebrews 13 verses 15
[1:37:16] and 16
[1:37:18] let's read that one lydia can you get
[1:37:19] that one hebrews 13 15 and 16 this is a
[1:37:22] beautiful portion of scripture
[1:37:27] where it again clearly tells us we're
[1:37:29] spiritual kings and priests
[1:37:32] unto god
[1:37:40] yeah 15 and 16 please by him therefore
[1:37:44] let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
[1:37:46] god continually
[1:37:47] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[1:37:48] thanks to his name but to do good and to
[1:37:51] communicate forget not for
[1:37:53] such sacrifices god is well pleased
[1:37:56] amen so here it plainly says
[1:37:59] as priests unto god our words are so
[1:38:02] important
[1:38:03] we must give thanks from our lips and
[1:38:05] these are
[1:38:06] acceptable sacrifices the bible says it
[1:38:09] plainly
[1:38:10] now look what it says interesting forget
[1:38:13] not to communicate
[1:38:14] or give gifts right sometimes we need
[1:38:17] reminders right right it's easy to
[1:38:18] forget oh i gotta worry about other
[1:38:19] people so
[1:38:20] so often we're just worried about us and
[1:38:22] our bank accounts and putting food on
[1:38:23] the table
[1:38:24] but he says forget not so don't feel bad
[1:38:26] if you forget to help others
[1:38:27] right we're gonna forget that at times
[1:38:31] um but the bible says forget not
[1:38:34] to give contributions
[1:38:38] which pleases god okay think about other
[1:38:41] people
[1:38:42] these are pleasing things that we do as
[1:38:44] kings and priests unto god
[1:38:46] we do not just live for ourselves or to
[1:38:48] live for others and
[1:38:49] our prayer can be god show me the
[1:38:51] necessities that people have need of
[1:38:53] right show me what they really need and
[1:38:56] then i can help them out
[1:39:00] all right a couple more scriptures
[1:39:01] revelation 5 8
[1:39:03] this we're not going to read it but it
[1:39:04] says prayers are kept in heaven
[1:39:07] in golden vials full of sweet odors so
[1:39:09] that proves it right there praise god
[1:39:12] our whole lives are like this beautiful
[1:39:13] odor being burnt
[1:39:15] up together and god collects all those
[1:39:18] odors
[1:39:19] right just like all the smoke goes in
[1:39:20] the atmosphere and all the
[1:39:22] all the carbon emissions they all go out
[1:39:24] in the atmosphere they go somewhere
[1:39:26] right so do your prayers so do your
[1:39:29] gifts to other people
[1:39:31] so it is all your sacrifice all you're
[1:39:32] witnessing amen like brother simon
[1:39:35] all you're witnessing it manifest the
[1:39:36] knowledge of god and it's a sweet
[1:39:38] smelling savor unto god anytime you
[1:39:40] sacrifice
[1:39:40] yourself or your husband or your wife
[1:39:42] any time you obey and
[1:39:44] anytime you love and it's hard and you
[1:39:46] sacrifice god receives that and he
[1:39:48] catches all that
[1:39:49] and the bible said they're in bowls in
[1:39:52] heaven
[1:39:53] we have bowls that catch the odors
[1:39:56] of our works that we do of worship when
[1:39:59] they're done with love
[1:40:01] praise god all right
[1:40:04] so now returning back to philippians 4
[1:40:07] 18.
[1:40:08] he said it's a sweet smelling savor
[1:40:11] the philippians gift for paul's needs
[1:40:15] was a sweet smelling savor unto god now
[1:40:18] which of those five now here's that well
[1:40:20] i mentioned the beginning which of those
[1:40:22] five sacrifices do you think it was now
[1:40:23] this is my opinion
[1:40:24] i could be wrong but i think it was the
[1:40:27] meat or meal offering
[1:40:28] i could be wrong but that's what i think
[1:40:31] why
[1:40:32] uh because they were providing for
[1:40:35] paul's earthly necessities he was
[1:40:37] afflicted whether by hunger we don't
[1:40:39] know or disease
[1:40:40] we don't know but he had needs and he
[1:40:43] was afflicted
[1:40:45] and remember he mentions that sometimes
[1:40:47] i'm hungry i'm content when i'm hungry
[1:40:48] when i'm full
[1:40:51] so i believe when the philippians sent
[1:40:54] that offering
[1:40:55] it was a meat offering unto god it was a
[1:40:58] meal offering lord i'm going to
[1:40:59] sacrifice this we're going to sacrifice
[1:41:01] this for our brother paul
[1:41:02] let it be as a meat offering unto you
[1:41:04] lord i'm just offering this to you take
[1:41:06] it
[1:41:07] and receive it in heaven praise god
[1:41:10] remember malachi read it from leviticus
[1:41:12] 2 verse 2
[1:41:13] flower oil frankincense would burn
[1:41:16] and it's an offering made by fire of a
[1:41:19] sweet savor
[1:41:21] unto the lord praise god god providing
[1:41:24] provision remember paul said
[1:41:25] i'm really glorifying god because you
[1:41:27] guys are going to get a reward
[1:41:29] those bowls are going to get filled up
[1:41:30] in heaven praise god amen
[1:41:33] hallelujah so he said that's why i'm
[1:41:36] glad they said to my necessities and my
[1:41:38] afflictions
[1:41:38] not that i wanted your your food or your
[1:41:41] money
[1:41:42] but that you your bowls in heaven could
[1:41:44] be filled up
[1:41:45] with the sweet odors of your worship
[1:41:48] praise god
[1:41:53] last scripture we'll read for today
[1:41:54] philippians 4 19 but
[1:41:56] my god shall supply
[1:41:59] all your need according to his riches in
[1:42:02] glory
[1:42:04] by christ jesus so paul takes this time
[1:42:07] and points out says thank you for all
[1:42:08] these things
[1:42:09] he said but don't forget god is going
[1:42:12] to supply all your needs i wonder if we
[1:42:14] could talk to all the
[1:42:15] saints who are a little older than us
[1:42:17] you know i wonder if we could ask them
[1:42:18] and say
[1:42:19] has god supplied all your needs what do
[1:42:20] you think they'd say
[1:42:22] i'm talking about someone 70 80 90
[1:42:26] 100. has god ever failed to supply your
[1:42:29] needs
[1:42:31] no because the scripture says
[1:42:34] my god shall supply all your need
[1:42:37] according to his
[1:42:38] riches in glory by christ jesus
[1:42:42] what a confirmation so do you ever need
[1:42:45] to worry well if i give this i might not
[1:42:46] have what i need do you ever need to
[1:42:47] worry about that
[1:42:50] no no as long as it's done from a loving
[1:42:54] cheerful heart and even if you don't if
[1:42:56] you even if you lack something what can
[1:42:58] you learn you can learn well
[1:42:59] this is a state i need to learn to live
[1:43:01] in
[1:43:02] like paul i will i can learn to be
[1:43:04] content when i'm full when i'm empty
[1:43:06] when i'm hungry when i'm full when i
[1:43:07] abound when i lack
[1:43:10] i'm learning to be like christ
[1:43:13] by his grace let's stand here
[1:43:19] jehovah jair let's see that my provider
[1:43:22] word of prayer of course
[1:43:27] let's see the slow one then we'll sing
[1:43:28] the fast one

[1:43:34] church
[1:43:35] according to his riches in glory by
[1:43:37] christ jesus
[1:43:39] he's the great provider he provides the
[1:43:40] water the rain
[1:43:42] he provides us with the seed he provides
[1:43:44] with everything
[1:43:45] the soil
[1:43:48] he's the great provider and he only asks
[1:43:51] us give your heart to him
[1:43:53] he said just give me your heart give me
[1:43:55] all your self
[1:43:57] then i'll put other people on your heart
[1:44:00] then when they receive it i'll get the
[1:44:02] glory
[1:44:04] glory that god might be glorified
[1:44:08] in all through all
[1:44:10] [Music]
