[30:29] to be able to worship his holy name
[30:32] Saints amen he's done all things well
[30:35] amen he's opened up the storehouse of
[30:38] heaven for us he's met all of our needs
[30:41] he's done nothing but being kind to us
[30:44] hey man I'll never always be thankful
[30:47] I'll always be thankful for the things
[30:50] that he has done for us amen amen I just
[30:53] I've seen what he's done in my life and
[30:56] I have a testimony of good things he's
[31:00] taking me from where I was I may be
[31:02] something I could have never made myself
[31:05] amen and I just that I always worship
[31:08] Him praise His Holy Name Amen
[31:10] amen this morning I just wanted to
[31:12] preach a message called the return to
[31:15] righteousness amen and uh as we to get
[31:20] into the message let's open our Bibles
[31:21] to the book of Ezra thank the musicians
[31:24] you guys did folks did a wonderful job I
[31:27] just I appreciate the atmosphere what a
[31:29] beautiful atmosphere
[31:31] amen amen Ezra chapter one will read the
[31:37] first through the fourth verses there
[31:40] and then from there we'll go to the book
[31:42] of Haggai chapter one the return to
[31:47] righteousness
[31:50] one thing is there's always an
[31:52] opportunity if you somehow leave
[31:55] righteousness off to the side that God
[31:58] in His mercy and grace gives us an
[32:00] opportunity to go back I'm glad that he
[32:04] does that amen
[32:06] and so just a little background here as
[32:09] we're chapter 1 is the ending of the
[32:12] Babylonian captivity
[32:13] seventy years they spent in Babylon with
[32:17] all their traditions all of their
[32:19] everything that the Jews held dear was
[32:22] centered around Mount Zion was centered
[32:24] around Jerusalem so when they lost
[32:27] Jerusalem they lost the whole heart of
[32:29] their religion and they really struggled
[32:32] in Babylon how to perform their religion
[32:36] without the City of God Amen so so ezra
[32:40] and ezra chapter 1 they're getting a
[32:42] glimpse an opportunity a chance to go
[32:46] back to righteousness like to go back to
[32:48] where they came from amen and so let's
[32:51] let's just read here ezra chapter 1
[32:52] verse 1 through 4 and it says now in the
[32:57] first year of sirius the king of persia
[32:59] that the word of the lord might be by
[33:02] the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled
[33:04] the lord stirred up the spirit of sirius
[33:07] king of persia
[33:09] that he made a proclamation throughout
[33:11] all of his kingdom and he put it also in
[33:13] writing saying thus saith sirius the
[33:16] king of persia the Lord goddess Jehovah
[33:20] God every time you see those capital lor
[33:22] D in the King James s Jehovah the
[33:24] Jehovah God of heaven have given me all
[33:27] the kingdoms of the earth and he has
[33:29] charged me to build him a house at
[33:31] Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there
[33:35] among you of all his people his God be
[33:38] with him let him go up to Jerusalem
[33:41] which is in Judah and build the house of
[33:45] Jehovah God in Israel he is the God
[33:48] which is in Jerusalem and whosoever
[33:50] remaineth in any place where he is
[33:53] soldiers let the men of his place help
[33:57] him with silver and with gold and with
[34:00] goods and with beasts besides the
[34:03] freewill offering for the house of God
[34:06] that is in Jerusalem and then rose up
[34:09] the chief of the fathers of bow Judah
[34:11] and Benjamin and all the priests and the
[34:13] Levites and all them whose spirit God
[34:15] has had raised to go up to build the
[34:18] house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem
[34:22] this is an exciting time I I just I
[34:27] don't know if you can place yourself in
[34:29] their shoes not only they're getting
[34:31] permission to go
[34:32] back to leave their captivity but
[34:35] they're getting the proclamation of
[34:37] those that held them captive go back I
[34:40] will help you I will send you the
[34:42] documents I will send you the
[34:44] commandments I will send you letters and
[34:46] now I will send you gold I will send you
[34:49] silver whatsoever things you have need
[34:51] of your God has stirred up my spirit and
[34:54] commanded me to send you back to rebuild
[34:57] his house what could happen in these
[35:03] next few years I mean just the
[35:05] excitement and and what we're going to
[35:07] do here is we're gonna fast forward in
[35:09] time 16 years and turn over to the book
[35:12] of Haggai let's look at their progress
[35:14] in 16 years down the road and look it
[35:17] and see what's going on we'll go to
[35:18] Haggai chapter 1 verse 11 there's a
[35:21] landmark event that happens just 16
[35:24] years after this after this after this
[35:27] statement hey guys the third - the last
[35:32] book there in the Old Testament and
[35:37] we're gonna read just we're gonna read
[35:39] Haggai chapter 1 verse 11 but we're only
[35:41] going to read the first six words of the
[35:43] verse and it says and I called for a
[35:59] drought now this is an amazing statement
[36:06] let's just go ahead and we're just gonna
[36:08] stop right there let's pray and then
[36:10] we'll get on into the message Heavenly
[36:13] Father we just thank you Lord for your
[36:15] gospel your words your scriptures they
[36:19] are rich each verse lures a thousand
[36:21] miles deep Laura and I pray that somehow
[36:23] this morning Lord that you would just
[36:25] allow us to to enter into eternity Lord
[36:28] and and lose a sense of time father and
[36:31] and not to where all the people but Lord
[36:33] just to dive into your gospel to your
[36:36] scripture and find out those things Lord
[36:39] that you've laid before us and Laura we
[36:41] just are looking to you father and I
[36:44] pray you to bless us right now with a
[36:45] revelation
[36:46] of your scripture in the name of Lord
[36:48] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can
[36:51] be seated and I called for a drought
[36:57] sixteen years after a God Jehovah had
[37:01] stirred up the king of Persia to send
[37:04] them back to the land where all the
[37:07] blessings lie they get back there and
[37:09] they've been given all the gold all the
[37:11] silver everything they have need up to
[37:13] rebuild the house of the Lord and here
[37:15] comes this scripture right here and it
[37:17] says and they're there they're back in
[37:19] their homeland and here comes a prophet
[37:22] by the name of Haggai marching into
[37:24] Jerusalem with a message for the people
[37:27] for the people that are going back to
[37:29] righteousness here is a message I have
[37:32] for you
[37:33] from the same God the same Jehovah that
[37:35] that brought you back here the same God
[37:38] now has a message for you and he says I
[37:40] am calling for a drought now this is a
[37:45] powerful now you know at my workplace I
[37:48] times I have one of my duties that I do
[37:51] is I have to draft communications that
[37:54] go out to all of our employees a MEF we
[37:57] have a certain project going on in this
[37:59] building over here or this building over
[38:01] there then then we have to send out an
[38:03] announcement you know what to explain
[38:05] you know this is what's going to happen
[38:06] this is when it's going to happen this
[38:08] is the impact that's going to be to your
[38:10] work teams and all those things and and
[38:11] then and then drafting these letters
[38:14] I've I've learned that one thing you
[38:17] really have to do when you're drafting
[38:18] these letters is you have to answer some
[38:20] key questions I'm sure you're familiar
[38:22] with the who the why who why what where
[38:25] when how any proper communication needs
[38:29] to answer those key questions if you're
[38:32] gonna if you want to get something
[38:34] across to the people you need to answer
[38:37] the who the what the why the where the
[38:39] wind and the how amen and if you're a
[38:42] communication answers those key those
[38:44] key questions then then you can be
[38:47] assured that your message is getting
[38:49] across
[38:50] you know you you've answered the
[38:52] question you haven't left anything out
[38:53] you you've made a false statement a mess
[38:56] or whatever I'm drafting a communication
[38:58] I'm always kind of mentally going down
[39:00] the check
[39:01] Cliff's making sure that I've answered
[39:02] every little all those little points
[39:04] there and those questions amen so as we
[39:07] as I look at this thing here and I
[39:10] called for a drought if we were just to
[39:13] mention just that scripture by itself we
[39:16] wouldn't have any contexts to place it
[39:18] you know we're first thing we have to
[39:21] consider here is who is calling for a
[39:24] drought you know what what what who is
[39:28] this person that is calling for a
[39:30] drought let's turn over to Jeremiah
[39:37] Jeremiah chapter 2 the Jeremiah chapter
[39:42] 2 has written just some hundred years
[39:44] before hey guy Jeremiah to chapter or
[39:52] chapter 2 verse 13 and it says for my
[39:58] people have committed two evils they
[40:01] have forsaken me the fountain of living
[40:04] water and hewed them out cisterns broken
[40:08] cisterns that can hold no water so this
[40:12] God that is sending His Prophet Haggai
[40:16] to announce the coming of a drought is
[40:18] the very fountain of living waters the
[40:23] fountain of living waters Himself is the
[40:25] one that's calling for this drought
[40:28] that's a lot of context the very god
[40:31] that provides the water from heavens is
[40:33] the one that's calling for a drought
[40:36] that's powerful you know I just kind of
[40:40] want it let's let's just I want to I
[40:41] want to just kind of show you an example
[40:43] this let's go back to this who what why
[40:45] where when how every time you get to a
[40:49] place in scripture you have to also if
[40:52] you want to put it in context you have
[40:54] trance for those questions yourself Amen
[40:57] when you get into a question you have to
[40:58] answer well who is that's written to you
[41:00] after you want to get these things in
[41:01] the right context Amen let's let's just
[41:04] take an example that if you if you just
[41:06] give me a space of time this morning I I
[41:08] don't want to rush this so let's just
[41:11] take a time let's go over to Ephesians
[41:13] chapter 1
[41:14] I kinda wanna just show you how we apply
[41:17] that into the scriptures when you
[41:25] consider the who why what where when how
[41:27] and you the one of the landmark areas of
[41:31] scriptures to play set it is in
[41:34] Ephesians chapter one Jesus chapter one
[41:41] verse three and four it says blessed be
[41:48] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[41:50] Christ who has blessed us with all
[41:54] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[41:56] in Christ according as he has chosen us
[41:59] in him before the foundation of the
[42:01] world that we should be wholly without
[42:04] blame before him and love amen it just
[42:07] keeps going on there but just to go back
[42:09] to verse three there who are we talking
[42:11] about here it says blessed be the God
[42:14] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ he
[42:17] is the eternal everlasting God amen he
[42:20] is the he is the creator of the heavens
[42:22] and the earth
[42:23] a man whenever we talk about the who
[42:25] here we have to keep in mind who we're
[42:27] talking about here you know it's like
[42:28] when people talk about the baptism of
[42:31] the Holy Spirit sometimes we we talk
[42:33] about so flippantly that sometimes I
[42:34] wonder if we forget who we're talking
[42:36] about when we're talking about being
[42:38] filled with the Holy Ghost amen because
[42:40] we were talking about being filled with
[42:42] the Holy Ghost it's it's you know we
[42:43] give these little descriptions of the
[42:45] Holy Spirit of you like boy spear is
[42:47] like a dove or or the Holy Spirit is oil
[42:49] or so much those things but the Holy
[42:51] Spirit really is not enough the loi
[42:54] spirit is not oil those are just types
[42:57] of him amen but the Holy Spirit is the
[43:00] same one there brooded over a dark earth
[43:02] back in the beginning a man the Holy
[43:05] Spirit is the same one that they uttered
[43:07] out let there be light amen he is the
[43:10] eternal everlasting God amen so if
[43:12] anybody ever once describes to you from
[43:15] behind a pulpit talking about the end
[43:16] dwelling the fulfilling of the Holy
[43:18] Ghost he is talking about something that
[43:20] is so powerful he's talking about the
[43:22] very presence
[43:23] Amen of the creator himself now coming
[43:26] and living in dwell
[43:27] you Amen so whenever we try to answer
[43:29] the who question in the Gospels and
[43:31] we're trying to figure out God we have
[43:33] to catch that revelation of who this God
[43:35] is a man let him be fully revealed to
[43:38] you that this God is the almighty
[43:40] powerful God amen he is the one the
[43:43] infant I just preached back at home
[43:45] about the the infinite resources amen
[43:48] how God will the infinite God create a
[43:50] world with finite resources God the God
[43:53] that had no boundaries created a world
[43:56] with boundaries amen the god of infinite
[43:59] resources create a world has finite
[44:02] resources amen so when he put his people
[44:05] upon the earth he gave them laws to live
[44:07] inside of amen and they had to live
[44:10] according to the laws of physics and of
[44:12] gravity and and all these things but in
[44:14] the myths of time God placed an infinite
[44:17] resource in the midst of the earth and
[44:19] that was the Lord Jesus Christ where
[44:22] Jesus said all power in heaven and earth
[44:24] is given unto me amen and I give unto
[44:27] you power to be the sons and daughters
[44:29] of God in the myths of this finite
[44:31] creation God placed an infinite resource
[44:35] which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[44:37] you can draw all things from him amen so
[44:41] the Christians are not bound by the
[44:43] finite resources because we have the
[44:45] ability as sons and daughters of God
[44:47] even though we're living in this finite
[44:50] world amen to tap back into that
[44:53] infinite resource and draw all things
[44:56] amen
[44:57] a man soul there when we're talking
[44:59] about the who that's the who that we're
[45:01] talking of he is the God of the infinite
[45:03] resources so when going back to
[45:05] Ephesians 1:3 there blessed be the God
[45:08] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ what
[45:11] has he done he has blessed us oh my now
[45:18] I don't want to just rush over this he
[45:20] the infinite God the infinite resource
[45:23] has now not just held those things to
[45:26] himself but he has reached into the
[45:28] treasure house of heaven and he has
[45:30] blessed us with heavenly blessings amen
[45:33] he has blessed us with with all
[45:36] spiritual blessings well that's pretty
[45:40] power
[45:42] there's you can there's not too many
[45:44] things that aren't in that scripture he
[45:47] is blessed us with all spiritual

[49:18] become that message amen any pre any
[49:21] people that receive a message have a

[49:44] anything from you even to the point of
[49:48] giving you the Holy Ghost which makes
[49:51] all things possible to them that belief
[49:55] amen
[49:57] hey man so let's let's just go back to
[50:00] Haggai chapter 11 year now we've kind of
[50:02] gone through there that there let's go
[50:04] back to Haggai chapter 1 there
[50:07] I called for a drought these are the
[50:21] people that just sixteen years before
[50:23] this where someone stood up on a little
[50:29] desk and unrolled a scroll before them
[50:33] and it was a proclamation by the king of
[50:37] Syria of Persia serious
[50:40] and as they made the announcement let's
[50:44] all gather together we have something we
[50:47] need to read we have a message that's
[50:49] been given to us and as he unscrew
[50:52] London unwraps the scroll of the
[50:54] proclamation of serous and is the words
[50:57] of seriousness as uttered over the desk
[50:59] a man is an Alpha is Ezra I don't recall
[51:03] who wrote it out but but but but as he
[51:05] read the proclamation they had to get a
[51:08] little bit excited a mint they had to
[51:11] get a little bit excited that they're
[51:13] all my here the king the one that has
[51:15] kept us in bondage the one that used to
[51:17] keep us in in Chains
[51:19] the one that used to keep us here in
[51:21] Babylon the one who used to who had the
[51:24] the rule and the authority over over
[51:27] Jerusalem and was keeping Jerusalem down
[51:30] is now saying I am taking my hand off
[51:32] Jerusalem
[51:33] I am taking my hand off Jerusalem by the
[51:37] commandment of Jehovah and I am giving
[51:40] to the rule of Jerusalem back over to
[51:43] the piss God's own people the Jews and
[51:47] not only that by I'm commanding you to
[51:50] go back to Jerusalem and build Jehovah a
[51:53] house and I am going to give you letters
[51:56] so that you can prove to anybody may I
[51:58] ask you what are you doing who gave you
[52:01] authority let it be known that God in
[52:03] heaven has given Cirus you said back
[52:06] there's and Ezra chapter 1 that the God
[52:09] in heaven has given all the world into
[52:12] my control the world it belongs to me
[52:16] said Cirrus God has given to my control
[52:19] and now I am giving drew
[52:21] ruslan back to you amen and I'm sending
[52:25] you letters to prove it and I am also
[52:28] sending you letters commanding anybody
[52:30] in any city wherever you live to help
[52:33] you with gold and with silver whatever
[52:35] you have need of but just go back and
[52:38] build a house for jehovah you know i
[52:42] tell you when you get when you have
[52:44] something like that how can you fail I
[52:49] just
[52:50] we're just boggles the mind how could
[52:53] they fail how could they not how could
[52:57] they stop how could anything go so let's
[52:59] let's turn here and hey guys sorry I
[53:00] keep making you bounce back for Plus
[53:02] let's go ahead and read sixteen years
[53:04] after that Scrolls read they come to
[53:07] Haggai chapter 1 verse 2 and it says
[53:12] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying
[53:15] this people say well who are these
[53:19] people it's the Jews this people say the
[53:25] time has not come the time that the
[53:29] Lord's house should be built I read that
[53:35] you just think what happened here 16
[53:40] years ago they were reading with
[53:42] excitement the letter of from serous
[53:46] saying go back and build the house and
[53:47] now the people are saying Jehovah is
[53:51] sending their prophet and said you are
[53:53] saying within yourself the time has not
[53:55] come to build the house of Lord how did
[53:59] this happen I the idea
[54:03] you're thinking your mind how did this
[54:04] happen it's so easy to look back into
[54:07] history and look at the people I think
[54:09] what happened how did this come let's
[54:14] keep reading verse three then came the
[54:19] word of the Lord by haggai the prophet
[54:21] saying is it time for you to dwell in
[54:24] your own seal that's trimmed out your
[54:27] own trimmed out houses and this house
[54:30] that's God's house this house lies waste
[54:33] now therefore thus saith Lord of hosts
[54:35] consider your ways you've sewn much and
[54:40] bring in little you eat but you have not
[54:44] enough you drink but you're not filled
[54:46] with drink you clothed you but there is
[54:48] none that is warm and he the earth wages
[54:51] earth wages to put it into a bag with
[54:54] holes thus saith the Lord of hosts
[54:57] consider your ways go up into the
[55:01] mountain and bring wood build the house
[55:03] and I'll take pleasure and I will be
[55:05] glorified saith Lord you look for much
[55:08] and Loic aim too little and when you
[55:10] brought a home I did blow on it
[55:11] why saith Lord because my house that is
[55:16] waste then come down to verse 10 it says
[55:19] therefore the heaven over you estate
[55:21] with new the earth has stayed from her
[55:24] fruit and I called for a drought God
[55:30] Jehovah God the fountain of living
[55:35] waters who rules over Jerusalem for all
[55:39] of eternity has claimed Jerusalem to be
[55:42] his own land
[55:43] has blessed with all spiritual blessings
[55:46] amen has now calling for a drought upon
[55:50] the lake it's just a powerful statement
[55:54] I just said my mind just always keeps
[55:57] going over God when you think about the
[55:59] who what why where when how when you get
[56:01] catched her who the whole revelation of
[56:04] who is saying this he's calling for a
[56:08] drought now let's go back in history a
[56:10] little bit and just kind of go through
[56:11] what rain really meant to Israel because
[56:15] if God is in a call for a drought
[56:17] you know what's gonna happen the rain is
[56:19] gonna cease the land is gonna dry up the
[56:24] crops are gonna fail amen
[56:27] you know you just know when he calls for
[56:29] a drought those are there's gonna in the
[56:30] process of time things are gonna be gate
[56:33] begin to get a little dry the the corn
[56:36] that produces this year was not going to
[56:38] produce as much next year and things
[56:40] it's gonna be I can't just go down to
[56:42] Walmart it's gonna get a little rough
[56:45] it's gonna get a little tough amen let's
[56:47] let's turn over to I hope I wrote it
[56:53] down here it's in Deuteronomy I think
[57:09] I'm gonna have to turn there by faith
[57:10] I'm not seen in my notes oh there it is
[57:17] Deuteronomy chapter 11 so in Deuteronomy
[57:25] chapter 11 this is when the children of
[57:27] Israel are going back to the promised
[57:30] land that God had promised them and he
[57:33] gave them certain commandments certain
[57:36] things certain expectations amen
[57:39] have how to live in that land and that's
[57:43] what Deuteronomy really was is is God
[57:45] was giving them the commandments I'm
[57:47] taking you to the promised land but this
[57:50] is how I want you to live in this land
[57:52] are there certain specific ways I don't
[57:55] want you to live in my promised land any
[57:57] old way but I want you to live in the
[57:59] land a very specific way I want you have
[58:01] certain attitudes certain expectations
[58:04] certain beliefs certain ceremonies
[58:06] certain certain certain religious
[58:10] ceremonies and such a man and feasts and
[58:12] everything amen amen this is how I want
[58:14] you to live in my promised land so you
[58:17] get to Gerar me chapter 11 let's read
[58:19] verse 10 and it says
[58:23] for the land whether thou goest in to
[58:26] possess it is not like the land of Egypt
[58:30] from where you came out of where thou
[58:34] sawest thy seed and water sit with thy
[58:37] foot as a garden of herbs but the land
[58:40] where you go to possess it is a land of
[58:43] hills and valleys and drinketh the water
[58:45] of the rain of heaven now I want to go
[58:49] back that wherein in verse 10 that where
[58:51] says where a wallet were you water with
[58:53] your foot what that speaking of is is in
[58:57] Egypt they had the Nile River there and
[59:00] they could create irrigation channels
[59:03] and they would draw little channels with
[59:06] their foot amen and then the the water
[59:08] would go along these irrigation canals
[59:11] and then wherever they create a little
[59:12] row with their foot amen
[59:14] the water would run along that stream
[59:16] and their crops would constantly buy
[59:19] their own work by their own labor by
[59:21] creating these channels their crops
[59:23] would always have water amen and that's
[59:26] how they water their crops along the
[59:28] Nile River amen but but God is telling
[59:31] them now I don't want you to live like
[59:33] you live back in Egypt because the Land
[59:36] of Israel isn't like the land of Egypt
[59:38] amen because when you go over to lay it
[59:40] to the promised land to the Land of
[59:42] Israel you're gonna your crops are gonna
[59:44] grow a little bit differently you're
[59:46] they're not gonna grow by your own labor
[59:47] or your own work you're not gonna water
[59:49] them with your own foot but your crops
[59:51] are gonna drink the water from heaven
[59:54] your crops are gonna be reliant on
[59:57] Jehovah if you're gonna grow crops it's
[1:00:00] not going to be by your own work and
[1:00:02] your own labor but it's gonna be by the
[1:00:05] rain from heaven by Jehovah amen so in
[1:00:08] Egypt they water their crops by their
[1:00:11] own Labor's amen when they are in the
[1:00:14] wilderness God gave them water or gave
[1:00:16] them food and water supernaturally by by
[1:00:20] raining down manna from heaven or by
[1:00:22] opening water out of the rock he gave
[1:00:23] them their sustenance supernaturally but
[1:00:25] a quantity comes to the promised land he
[1:00:27] says oh there's a process to this I the
[1:00:31] Lord will send down the rain you will
[1:00:34] plant the seeds I will give the increase
[1:00:37] and
[1:00:37] together we will have a partnership
[1:00:39] together as our fingers laced together
[1:00:42] we'll be in partnership and unity
[1:00:44] together Jehovah and his people to bring
[1:00:47] crops for the living of the people Amen
[1:00:52] it's not like Egypt where they did it
[1:00:54] was their own work Amen it's not those
[1:00:56] lists not their labor it's not just God
[1:00:59] alone sending down manna from heaven but
[1:01:01] now it's the people and God together
[1:01:03] amen
[1:01:04] they had to trust in the Lord to send
[1:01:06] the rain they had to trust in the Lord
[1:01:09] to send the rain hey man let's go down
[1:01:13] to verse 12 the next verse there he's
[1:01:14] describing land he says and the land
[1:01:17] which the LORD thy God careth for
[1:01:19] describing the promised land for the
[1:01:21] eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon
[1:01:24] it wouldn't you like the God have his
[1:01:26] always always upon you amen he does from
[1:01:30] the beginning of the year even unto the
[1:01:32] end of the year because remember the
[1:01:35] beginning of the year was the beginning
[1:01:37] of their crops amen
[1:01:39] the end of the year would be when the
[1:01:42] crops come in from the harvest and God's
[1:01:44] eyes were on the crops from the
[1:01:47] beginning to the end and he knew how
[1:01:50] much rain they needed so he had Scott
[1:01:52] would send the rain in their own due
[1:01:54] seasons and God says don't you worry you
[1:02:00] live according to my laws and I will
[1:02:02] send my reign in his due seasons amen
[1:02:06] and verse 14 and that I will give you
[1:02:09] the rain of your land in his due season
[1:02:12] the first rain and the latter rain that
[1:02:14] thou may us together in thy corn and thy
[1:02:17] wine and nine oil amen because each
[1:02:19] particular crop needed a particular
[1:02:22] amount of rain amen
[1:02:24] some crops needed this much some cross
[1:02:26] need that much some crops grow at this
[1:02:28] time of the year some this time of the
[1:02:30] year and each crop had its own season a
[1:02:33] time of the year and God alone knew how
[1:02:35] much rain to send it and so he say this
[1:02:38] is not like the land of Egypt where you
[1:02:40] do your irrigation channels but this is
[1:02:42] the land where the rain is provided by
[1:02:45] the God of heaven it is due season amen
[1:02:48] so when when you get to the book of
[1:02:50] Haggai where
[1:02:51] he says I am calling for a drought he
[1:02:53] says I am interrupting my promise to you
[1:02:56] I am I'm calling for a stop the Ray is
[1:03:00] gonna cease the crops are gonna dry out
[1:03:02] the blessings are gonna be over why
[1:03:04] because something has happened in the
[1:03:06] minds of the people to where they have
[1:03:08] gone back on their end of the bargain
[1:03:10] amen they are stay have declared to
[1:03:13] themselves that they're no longer in
[1:03:15] partnership with Jehovah amen because
[1:03:19] the the agricultural of Israel a
[1:03:22] cultural life of Israel was to be a
[1:03:25] partnership between God and His people
[1:03:28] amen God would send the rains the people
[1:03:32] would Widow would plant the seeds God
[1:03:35] would bring the increase and then at the
[1:03:37] end of the cycle he'd send the latter
[1:03:38] rain and then they grow up and bring the
[1:03:40] harvest and then they would offer the
[1:03:42] harvest back to the Lord they gave it
[1:03:44] and so all throughout the entire year
[1:03:47] the whole agricultural cycle of Israel
[1:03:50] was a partnership between God's people
[1:03:52] in himself had to be in partnership God
[1:03:56] couldn't be left out of the mix and
[1:03:57] neither could the people be left out of
[1:03:59] the mix they had to be united together
[1:04:01] they had to trust in the Lord for the
[1:04:04] rain and he had to trust in them to
[1:04:06] plant the seeds amen so in the book of
[1:04:10] Haggai got when God called for a drought
[1:04:12] he did it for a very specific reason
[1:04:15] amen now we're going to keep going let's
[1:04:17] go down to verse 16 he says how he's
[1:04:27] given them a warning and this warning is
[1:04:30] linked to their crops amen take heed to
[1:04:37] yourself be careful lay your heart be
[1:04:42] not deceived what does this have to do
[1:04:44] with crops they have to keep their into
[1:04:47] the bargain amen God wants them to act a
[1:04:51] specific way in his promised land amen
[1:04:54] take heed to yourself that your heart be
[1:04:57] not deceived and you turn aside and
[1:04:59] serve other gods and worship them and
[1:05:02] then the Lord's wrath be kindled against
[1:05:05] you
[1:05:05] and he sharp the heaven and there be no
[1:05:07] rain and the land yield not her fruit
[1:05:10] lest he perish quickly from off the good
[1:05:13] land which the Lord give you know once
[1:05:19] you consider what happens if the crops
[1:05:21] fail in Israel they can't just go over
[1:05:26] to Walmart or to some other store
[1:05:29] somewhere else
[1:05:29] if the crops fail they perish a man if
[1:05:34] the crops failed a day I remember how
[1:05:36] many times throughout the Old Testament
[1:05:37] where they would start eating their
[1:05:39] children and do different things why
[1:05:40] because I drought would come the crops
[1:05:43] would fail like the one when we toll I
[1:05:45] should I'm gonna make this my last meal
[1:05:47] we rub two sticks together we're gonna
[1:05:49] make this meal and then we're gonna my
[1:05:50] son I are gonna die because they had
[1:05:53] left off there into the bargain amen
[1:05:56] they were ignoring Jehovah they are to
[1:05:59] be in partnership together but one-half
[1:06:01] the partnership drifted away drifted
[1:06:05] away amen and so what the rains quit
[1:06:08] falling from heaven because of the
[1:06:11] drifting away it's powerful it's
[1:06:15] powerful you know and I think about how
[1:06:17] it's so easy for us to look back into
[1:06:19] history I think 16 years from Ezra - hey
[1:06:25] guy they had everything that they needed
[1:06:29] everything was provided Cirrus gave him
[1:06:32] all the gold and the silver he gave them
[1:06:35] permission he gave them the rule of the
[1:06:37] land just go back to Jerusalem and bill
[1:06:39] got a house go back to Jerusalem build
[1:06:43] jehovah house and worship him there what
[1:06:47] a commandment but when they got there
[1:06:49] and hey guy says that they went back
[1:06:51] there and they built their own houses
[1:06:53] it says Noah did they build their own
[1:06:56] houses it says they trimmed them out and
[1:06:58] they finished them while his own house
[1:07:01] was still laying in ruins
[1:07:03] the walls were still broken down from
[1:07:05] when Jeremiah went into captivity all
[1:07:08] the fire and the flames when they burned
[1:07:10] down the city they're still there when
[1:07:12] they had taken up all the stones in
[1:07:14] there that was still there yeah where
[1:07:16] they had
[1:07:16] everything they've been ruined and
[1:07:18] desecrated was still ruined and
[1:07:20] desecrated everything was still
[1:07:22] destroyed and yet they had built their
[1:07:24] own houses they were leaving off their
[1:07:27] end of the bargain they went back there
[1:07:30] and they were enjoying the crops they're
[1:07:32] enjoying their houses they're there
[1:07:34] they're enjoying the good fruit of the
[1:07:36] land but the partnership never returned
[1:07:40] they are supposed to their fingers was
[1:07:42] supposed to be interlaced with Jehova's
[1:07:44] fingers a man supposed to be God and man
[1:07:47] worshiping one another loving loving God
[1:07:49] amen and giving hands falling into his
[1:07:52] Commandments but they didn't go uphold
[1:07:54] their end of the bargain and God would
[1:07:57] not let his people live in such a
[1:07:58] condition let me tell you that that
[1:08:02] drought may seem kind of cruel but in
[1:08:05] actuality it was actually God's mercy
[1:08:09] amen because is God's mercy to draw them
[1:08:13] back into partnership with him because
[1:08:15] he God's people have to live with him
[1:08:18] and United with him they are his people
[1:08:20] he chose them amen amen if you're gonna
[1:08:23] live in God's promised land you have to
[1:08:25] live by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:28] amen you have to live in the anointing
[1:08:31] of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:08:32] yes now I just from this point let's
[1:08:36] let's let's go on to the New Testament
[1:08:38] here as I said about a lot of of Israel
[1:08:45] because they had such a partnership with
[1:08:48] Jehovah a lot of their feasts had to do
[1:08:50] with agriculture you know I was like the
[1:08:53] way their it wave the wave sheaf you
[1:08:55] know is the harvesting of the wheat you
[1:08:56] know the day of Pentecost and and all
[1:08:58] those things they all had to do with
[1:08:59] specific crops you know and I know
[1:09:01] you've probably heard many service
[1:09:03] preached on them and I'm not gonna dive
[1:09:05] into them too much but but there is one
[1:09:08] particular feast that they had the Feast
[1:09:10] of Tabernacles amen where they would
[1:09:13] leave they walk out of their houses and
[1:09:15] they build little booths and they'd live
[1:09:17] in booths because they are celebrating
[1:09:19] the time back when they lived in the
[1:09:21] wilderness say men but the another part
[1:09:23] of the feast is who was when they
[1:09:25] celebrated that all of the crops have
[1:09:27] been brought in
[1:09:30] amen all of the crops have been brought
[1:09:32] in we've made it through another year we
[1:09:35] have all of our wheat we have all of our
[1:09:38] barley we have all of our grapes our
[1:09:40] cows are thick and fat a man they've had
[1:09:43] enough to eat a grass to eat in the
[1:09:45] fields and Jehovah has rained down his
[1:09:47] blessings upon us
[1:09:49] amen and he has provided all of our
[1:09:51] fruits amen he gave us all but the rain
[1:09:54] Whitney needed in our due season and
[1:09:56] we're gonna gather all of our crusts
[1:09:58] together in one place a man we're gonna
[1:10:00] worship the Lord God Jehovah and the
[1:10:02] Feast of Tabernacles and we're gonna
[1:10:04] praise Him at the end of the year for
[1:10:06] all of his blessings that he has rained
[1:10:08] down upon us and all that he has given
[1:10:09] us and they said that the the Feast of
[1:10:12] Tabernacles was a feasts of great joy
[1:10:14] and great great blessings in Jerusalem
[1:10:18] amen amen when it said that one or that
[1:10:20] one of their Jewish rabbis said that you
[1:10:23] have never known true joy and tell you a
[1:10:26] celebrate in the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:10:29] you have never known true joy and tell
[1:10:32] you a celebrate in the midst of the
[1:10:34] Feast of Tabernacles why because they
[1:10:37] were they were at the end God had
[1:10:39] fulfilled his into the bargain it's not
[1:10:43] just that they had done their end of the
[1:10:45] bargain but they had planted their seats
[1:10:47] and God had responded and he sit down
[1:10:50] the ring Amen God had Sid responded and
[1:10:54] he poured out the rain and showers of
[1:10:56] blessings upon them and their fruits and
[1:10:58] the seeds that they planned responded
[1:11:00] and gave the increase and he came up and
[1:11:02] worshiped the Lord God Jehovah and they
[1:11:04] were able to reap all their crops and
[1:11:06] here they have the fruits of their crops
[1:11:09] the evidence of God's blessings are all
[1:11:11] piled up in the in the barns and the
[1:11:13] Garner's amen and now they're gonna
[1:11:15] gather together in a feast and praise
[1:11:17] the Lord God Jehovah of heaven for rain
[1:11:20] ah his blessings upon them and the rabbi
[1:11:23] said that no one has ever experienced
[1:11:25] true joy until they have first
[1:11:27] experienced the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:11:31] praise God
[1:11:33] reminds me of Pentecost
[1:11:35] the Pentecostal blessings amen where God
[1:11:38] sends down the Holy Spirit upon the
[1:11:40] earth amen amen so let's her to John
[1:11:44] chapter 7 Joe in John chapter 7 was
[1:11:52] coming about to the time of the Feast of
[1:11:54] Tabernacles and Jesus towards the end of
[1:11:57] Jesus's ministry there John 7 verse 2 it
[1:12:12] says now the Jews Feast of Tabernacles
[1:12:16] was at hand all these thousands of years
[1:12:25] hundreds and hundreds of years the Jews
[1:12:27] have been celebrating this Feast of
[1:12:28] Tabernacles all the every year God's
[1:12:31] been providing them with their crop
[1:12:32] providing them with their crop providing
[1:12:35] them with blessings providing with
[1:12:36] showers rain in their due seasons and
[1:12:38] hundreds and hundreds of years every
[1:12:40] year they celebrated once more God has
[1:12:43] blessed us once more God has provided
[1:12:45] once more and here
[1:12:47] Jesus's is in the Land of Israel and
[1:12:50] it's coming upon that season where
[1:12:52] they're going to they're going to
[1:12:54] celebrate once more that God has
[1:12:56] provided for all of our needs like we
[1:13:00] read there in Ephesians God has given us
[1:13:03] everything he's given us all spiritual
[1:13:05] blessings in Christ Jesus everything
[1:13:07] that we have need of and now they're
[1:13:09] getting to in the natural celebrate that
[1:13:12] God has given us everything that we have
[1:13:14] need of and we have the fruits of it
[1:13:18] laying right here we are sir harvest has
[1:13:21] been successful praise God Almighty
[1:13:24] we've reaped once more amen
[1:13:30] and so as the now that feast of
[1:13:33] tabernacles you know I was a it was an
[1:13:35] eight to seven or an eight day feast
[1:13:37] there and each day of the feast the the
[1:13:41] the the priests would well first off one
[1:13:48] thing they would do is in the evening
[1:13:49] they had these four columns in the
[1:13:51] courtyard
[1:13:52] they had golden bowls on the top and
[1:13:55] these golden bowls they would fill them
[1:13:57] with oil these were tall pillars and
[1:13:59] these Bulls were wait wait wait wait at
[1:14:01] the top and they would climb these
[1:14:03] ladders with these Bulls oil and they'd
[1:14:05] fill with oil and they'd light them on
[1:14:07] fire and these four pillars will be
[1:14:09] flaming with fire and they say it would
[1:14:11] lighten all of Jerusalem would every
[1:14:14] courtyard Jerusalem will be shining with
[1:14:16] the light from the tablet from the hill
[1:14:18] from Mount Zion amen and then another
[1:14:21] thing that they were doing this feast is
[1:14:22] every day of the feast they would go
[1:14:24] down and and they would go today get
[1:14:27] these jugs empty jugs for holding water
[1:14:29] amen and the priest would go marching
[1:14:32] dancing holding these jugs and they'd be
[1:14:35] dancing down the hill and they go down
[1:14:37] they leave the tabernacle they would
[1:14:39] leave the temple and they'd go down to
[1:14:41] the base of Mount Zion and at the base
[1:14:43] of Mount Zion there was this little
[1:14:45] spring there a man in this little spring
[1:14:48] if they had had good rain throughout the
[1:14:51] year this spring would always be
[1:14:53] bubbling up bubbling up this spring
[1:14:55] didn't come up from the from the deep of
[1:14:59] the earth but this spring as she came
[1:15:01] from the volume of water that Mount Zion
[1:15:04] would hold a man because as God rained
[1:15:07] down from heaven the water would soak
[1:15:10] into Mount Zion a man though and the
[1:15:12] mountain would hold the water and it
[1:15:14] would come out and he would pressurize
[1:15:16] at the bottom of the mountain and it
[1:15:18] would spring out this little crevice of
[1:15:20] the rock into a little spring Amen so
[1:15:22] the priest would march down Mount Zion
[1:15:25] and they'd be holding these jokes and
[1:15:26] they'd grit and they'd fill up these
[1:15:28] jugs with the water and if there had
[1:15:30] been enough rain for the crops there'd
[1:15:33] also be enough rain for the spring to
[1:15:35] spring out his water
[1:15:36] amen amen so they go down there and they
[1:15:39] fill these these jugs with water and
[1:15:42] they marched back up and
[1:15:43] sing the Psalms of David as they marched
[1:15:46] and so they are singing there's these
[1:15:49] particular Psalms that they were seeing
[1:15:50] called the halo his songs I think 113 to
[1:15:53] 118 and they would sing these songs as
[1:15:56] they is marching back up the hill
[1:15:57] holding these jugs of water a man they
[1:15:59] get up and they pour them out in the
[1:16:01] courtyard by the altar there a man there
[1:16:03] because God had provided rain for the
[1:16:06] year
[1:16:07] amen God had answered his into the
[1:16:09] bargain amen God had provided them with
[1:16:11] all of their needs they men and and once
[1:16:14] a day they would pour it out one time
[1:16:16] but on the last day of the feast on the
[1:16:21] last day of the feast they would do it
[1:16:22] seven times amen
[1:16:26] and so now Jesus had told his brethren
[1:16:30] going up to the feast I'm not going go
[1:16:35] on up before me but then he went around
[1:16:38] he did go on a little bit later in
[1:16:40] secret amen and so I'm not going up
[1:16:45] right now so you go on ahead but then
[1:16:48] later he went up secretly amen and so
[1:16:51] when he get down to verse 37 there here
[1:16:55] it is in the last day of the feast and
[1:16:58] Jesus stands up let's just read that
[1:17:00] there and in the last day that great day
[1:17:03] of the feast Jesus stood and cried oh
[1:17:07] we're just gonna stop right there
[1:17:09] Jesus was watching them perform these
[1:17:13] ceremonies amen brother Jesse would you
[1:17:20] mind going and getting my large
[1:17:21] cellphone off the table in there as
[1:17:27] Jesus watched this every day who watched
[1:17:31] the the priests marching up the hill a
[1:17:35] man as they marched up the hill they
[1:17:39] would be dancing and singing and they
[1:17:43] would be holding their water pucks
[1:17:45] water pots and it still is supposed to
[1:17:47] be a feast of exceeding exceeding great
[1:17:50] joy
[1:17:55] and I just want to read this quote by
[1:17:56] this Jewish rabbi here it says here
[1:18:05] whoever has not seen they called this
[1:18:08] South the ceremony the celebration of
[1:18:10] the water libation it says whoever has
[1:18:13] not seen the celebration of the water
[1:18:15] libation has never experienced the
[1:18:18] feeling of true joy and then he said as
[1:18:23] the people saying the righteous and
[1:18:26] pious men would dance before them while
[1:18:28] juggling flaming torches and and then
[1:18:31] the Levite saying keeps going on and
[1:18:32] they would go up and they'd be carrying
[1:18:34] these water jugs and then they'd pour
[1:18:36] them out amen and they'd go down to the
[1:18:38] spring and they'd pour him out amen and
[1:18:40] then they'd pour the water out at the
[1:18:43] altar amen and then and then what one
[1:18:47] thing they would do as they are doing is
[1:18:49] they would as they would they was seeing
[1:18:52] the halo which is Psalms 113 through 118
[1:18:56] let's just turn there real quick I'm not
[1:19:01] going to read all through all these all
[1:19:03] all the Psalms they're all six Psalms
[1:19:05] but let's just read a little bit of the
[1:19:07] last there because Jesus was watching
[1:19:10] them do this as they're marching back up
[1:19:12] the hill with the water they're singing
[1:19:14] they're dancing there's great joy
[1:19:16] everywhere and they're singing the songs
[1:19:18] of David and they get to Psalms 118 and
[1:19:21] they begin to sing verse 19 it says open
[1:19:26] to me the gates of righteousness I will
[1:19:29] go into them and I will praise the Lord
[1:19:31] they gave this gate of righteousness
[1:19:34] into which the righteous shall enter
[1:19:36] think about they're carrying their jugs
[1:19:38] and they're going through each gate the
[1:19:39] gate of the courtyard they gate into
[1:19:41] this and the gate and they going through
[1:19:43] these various gates amen and they're
[1:19:45] singing this and it says I will praise
[1:19:46] thee for thou has heard me and now our
[1:19:49] become my salvation there's Jesus just
[1:19:51] watching them amen and then the sinisa
[1:19:54] and they're singing the stone which the
[1:19:56] builders refused has become the head of
[1:19:58] the corner it has become the headstone
[1:20:00] of the corner this is the Lord's doing
[1:20:02] is marvelous in our eyes this is the day
[1:20:05] which the Lord has made we will rejoice
[1:20:08] and be glad
[1:20:09] Oh save now I beseech thee O Lord O Lord
[1:20:12] I beseech thee sin now thy prosperity
[1:20:15] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:20:17] the Lord we have blessed you out of the
[1:20:20] house of the Lord Amen hair stands Jesus
[1:20:23] he is that he is the head scorn he was
[1:20:25] the one that was rejected he's watching
[1:20:27] them perform this ceremony and that's
[1:20:29] when all of a sudden Jesus stands up he
[1:20:33] couldn't take it anymore
[1:20:35] amen this was to be the last feast of
[1:20:40] tabernacles in the natural amen one of
[1:20:44] the last feast of tabernacles in the
[1:20:45] natural why because the answer of all
[1:20:49] those hundreds of years of celebrations
[1:20:53] now the infinite resource was standing
[1:20:57] in their midst the one that provided all
[1:21:00] that water in his due season was
[1:21:01] standing right there the one that had
[1:21:04] provided all their crops was right there
[1:21:07] the one that they are celebrating was
[1:21:09] standing right there amen he was the cap
[1:21:12] so the the corn stone that was rejected
[1:21:14] he's standing there watching them he's
[1:21:17] the one that provided the water that
[1:21:19] they were carrying amen and they're
[1:21:22] rejoicing in it and he stands up an
[1:21:25] adverse alert john 7:37 there he says in
[1:21:27] the last day that great day of the feast
[1:21:29] Jesus stood up and cried saying if any
[1:21:33] man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:21:35] drink he that believeth on me as the
[1:21:38] scripture has said out of his belly
[1:21:40] shall flow rivers of living water
[1:21:44] he was the everlasting resource now it
[1:21:47] is time I will give you exactly way
[1:21:50] seven ephesians i have blessed you with
[1:21:52] all spiritual blessings in christ jesus
[1:21:53] i have now become the everlasting
[1:21:56] resource a man i think about you know
[1:22:00] how christ gave us his forgiveness we
[1:22:07] had a lot of debts stacked up against us
[1:22:10] amen and you know throughout all the
[1:22:14] hundreds of years all these debts have
[1:22:16] been stacked up against us i think about
[1:22:17] like the the dead of murder when a
[1:22:21] and commits murder he takes something
[1:22:25] that he can no longer ever restore amen
[1:22:29] he took someone else's life but he can't
[1:22:32] give that life back he cannot restore it
[1:22:35] so therefore he is guilty of murder and
[1:22:39] all men look at him and say you had no
[1:22:42] right to commit murder you had no right
[1:22:44] to do that
[1:22:44] because you took something you could not
[1:22:46] restore and all men judged like that you
[1:22:50] know and when you do something like
[1:22:52] right now if I used to go down to France
[1:22:53] over to the museum to the Loire where
[1:22:56] they store the Mona Lisa if I was to go
[1:22:58] there and I was to destroy the Mona Lisa
[1:23:02] all the world would judge me they would
[1:23:06] say you had no right to do that
[1:23:08] you are guilty that didn't belong to you
[1:23:10] all the world will look at me and judge
[1:23:12] me you destroyed something and you say
[1:23:14] we'll all repaint it I could never
[1:23:16] restore that it would never be the same
[1:23:19] it's like that Cathedral that burned
[1:23:21] down recently the Notre Dame a
[1:23:24] hundred-year-old Cathedral with all
[1:23:26] those 800 year old Timbers of wood they
[1:23:28] say oh we're going to rebuild that they
[1:23:31] can't rebuild it they can make another
[1:23:34] structure that will look like it they
[1:23:35] can put in new but it's not the same
[1:23:37] it'll never be the same again because
[1:23:39] something was destroyed a hundred you
[1:23:42] can't go get a hundred pieces old what
[1:23:44] the people they carve that are dead and
[1:23:47] gone it cannot be rebuilt like it was it
[1:23:49] cannot be restored so debt was created
[1:23:52] upon the earth that cannot be repaid
[1:23:55] because this world is a world of finite
[1:23:58] resources amen and God created this
[1:24:02] world of finite resources and because he
[1:24:04] did that when people take things that
[1:24:07] they cannot restore it creates a debt
[1:24:09] upon the earth it creates a debt upon
[1:24:13] the earth and that debt is stacked
[1:24:15] against those that did the act they may
[1:24:17] think of an abuse victim when someone
[1:24:20] abuses someone and that person lives
[1:24:22] their entire life but it troubled in
[1:24:24] their mind because of how they were
[1:24:25] abused well there's a debt there because
[1:24:29] something was taken that should have
[1:24:30] never been taken something what happened
[1:24:32] to that person that never should have
[1:24:34] happened and
[1:24:35] is a debt stacked against that abuser
[1:24:37] how can that debt ever be repaid because
[1:24:39] if he repents well the act the the
[1:24:42] effect is still over here upon the other
[1:24:44] person how can that debt be repaid there
[1:24:47] is a debt that cannot how can I ever be
[1:24:50] restored a debt has been created how can
[1:24:53] it ever be repaid a man beg God in the
[1:24:56] midst of tri time placed the Lord Jesus
[1:24:58] Christ and in this world of finite
[1:25:02] resources the Lord Jesus Christ is that
[1:25:06] infinite resource he is the one that can
[1:25:09] pay every debt he can restore everything
[1:25:12] that was ever wronged he could rebuild
[1:25:15] notre-dame if he wanted to he could
[1:25:17] bring it speak it right back into
[1:25:19] existence amen he could undo every
[1:25:22] single thing he is the infinite resource
[1:25:24] and the earth hey I remember Jesus sit
[1:25:26] up and cried in the Tabernacle once he
[1:25:28] the scrolls hand tome Isaiah 60 amen 61
[1:25:32] and he opened up the scroll and he found
[1:25:34] where as Rennie says this Spirit of the
[1:25:36] Lord God is upon me because he has
[1:25:39] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:25:41] poor to bind up the brokenhearted to say
[1:25:44] liberty them that are bruised amen to to
[1:25:47] to is to say Liberty though they're in
[1:25:48] captivity to heal them to bind up the
[1:25:51] brokenhearted the Spirit of Lord God is
[1:25:53] upon me and that same spirit is the
[1:25:55] water that we're talking about that
[1:25:58] anointing that was upon him in Isaiah 61
[1:26:01] and Luke 4 that anointing that was upon
[1:26:04] him is the water that we're speaking of
[1:26:06] they they when Jesus Christ was standing
[1:26:09] there watching that water libation
[1:26:10] saraburi
[1:26:11] he's watching them rejoicing and singing
[1:26:14] and shouting and dancing and he's
[1:26:16] standing there was an announcement in

[1:27:44] he opens up his mouth and he takes a
[1:27:47] drink of that everlasting water amen and
[1:27:50] if he that believeth on me as the
[1:27:53] scripture has said out of his belly
[1:27:55] shall flow rivers of living water the
[1:27:58] verse 39 says but this spake he of the
[1:28:01] Spirit which they that believe on him
[1:28:04] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[1:28:06] not yet given because Jesus was not yet
[1:28:09] glorified but let me tell you surely
[1:28:12] Jesus has now been glorified and let me
[1:28:15] tell you I am glorifying right now the
[1:28:17] Lord Jesus Christ in your sight right
[1:28:20] now this morning and the songs that we
[1:28:23] sung we are all glorifying the Lord
[1:28:25] Jesus Christ and he said wherever two or
[1:28:28] three are gathered I'll be right there
[1:28:29] in the midst of them and when I come in
[1:28:31] the midst of you I'll be the same
[1:28:33] yesterday today and forever amen and
[1:28:35] when I come the Spirit of the Lord God
[1:28:38] is upon me because he has anointed me to
[1:28:40] bind up the brokenhearted to preach the
[1:28:42] gospel to the poor the Senate liberties
[1:28:44] of the blind to heal to restore the
[1:28:47] sight to those that are blind amen to
[1:28:49] let set at liberty those there in
[1:28:52] captivity and he's here right now this
[1:28:55] morning to give that to you
[1:28:57] so come unto Him and drink so I have
[1:29:00] your bellies shall flow rivers of
[1:29:02] last night I spoke about that about the
[1:29:06] dedication of ceremony of Solomon I
[1:29:08] probably speak that almost every time I
[1:29:10] come here but when Solomon dedicated
[1:29:14] that temple he said O Lord we have built
[1:29:20] this house for the God of heaven but how
[1:29:24] can we build you a house they say the
[1:29:27] Lord but you take joy in this house but
[1:29:30] you enjoy this place and if you and I
[1:29:35] ask Lord that you have set a process a
[1:29:38] law in this house that if any man come
[1:29:41] into this house and have respect unto
[1:29:44] the name of Jehovah if any of the Jews
[1:29:48] coming to this house and respect unto
[1:29:50] the name of Jehovah and lay there cry
[1:29:52] lay their prayer upon the altar that
[1:29:54] you'll or would hear from heaven and
[1:29:55] answer their prayer and he said
[1:29:58] furthermore Lord I pray that if a
[1:30:00] stranger from Israel comes and if even
[1:30:03] if a stranger comes and comes into this
[1:30:05] house they if he if he has respects
[1:30:09] under the name of Jehovah and lays this
[1:30:11] prayer here upon the altar I pray Lord
[1:30:13] that you also would hear even his prayer
[1:30:15] from heaven an answer him and you don't
[1:30:18] let's that was still in effect today
[1:30:20] because you have become the temple the
[1:30:22] Most High God Amen you have become the
[1:30:24] spring of living water you have become
[1:30:26] the repository of the everlasting
[1:30:30] resource the anointing the spirit of
[1:30:33] living God the one that can make all
[1:30:35] things right the one that can restore I
[1:30:38] will restore this is less saith Lord
[1:30:40] Amen all the years that the enemies
[1:30:42] eating but he will do it through you
[1:30:46] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:48] amen so when we talk about the baptism
[1:30:51] of the Holy Ghost we're not talking
[1:30:53] about just an emotion we're not talking
[1:30:55] about just a doctrine a man as young as
[1:30:57] the Lutheran say come up to the stage
[1:30:59] and we'll sprinkle its water we'll will
[1:31:01] lay hands and confirm the Holy Spirit
[1:31:03] upon you the Catholics will say come up
[1:31:05] here and take this little wafer and when
[1:31:07] you eat the wafer that then it'll be the
[1:31:09] Holy Eucharist and you'll be people
[1:31:10] partaking of the body of Christ and the
[1:31:12] Holy Spirit will come upon you
[1:31:14] a man is the the Baptist's a
[1:31:16] come up here and say I believe in my
[1:31:18] heart that the Lord Jesus Christ died
[1:31:19] for my sins and the Holy Spirit will
[1:31:21] come upon you it isn't like that
[1:31:23] it isn't according to those doctrines as
[1:31:25] the Pentecostals say just just get
[1:31:27] excited enough and utter out these words
[1:31:29] until you speak with tongues and then
[1:31:31] the Holy Ghost is upon you but let me
[1:31:33] tell you those are just almost trinkets
[1:31:35] of doctrines that is not what we're
[1:31:37] talking about we're talking about the
[1:31:39] everlasting almighty all-powerful God
[1:31:41] will come down and pour himself inside
[1:31:44] of you a men he will fill you so come
[1:31:46] into his house have respect unto his
[1:31:49] name and if you come and believe on him
[1:31:51] or confess your sins to him have
[1:31:53] respects under his name amen he will
[1:31:56] come and fill you with his own presence
[1:31:59] and then you'll become that everlasting
[1:32:01] resource upon the earth and you'll be
[1:32:03] the one that is now anointed to bind up
[1:32:06] the brokenhearted to set at liberty them
[1:32:08] that bruised to answer to you have the
[1:32:11] answer for the abuse victims you have
[1:32:13] the answer for those that been
[1:32:14] downtrodden you can go to the to the low
[1:32:17] to those that are in prison because you
[1:32:19] now are the one that has the answer for
[1:32:24] life's problems amen if you just come to
[1:32:27] him and drink came in a man why because
[1:32:30] they have to return back to
[1:32:33] righteousness a man we've been given
[1:32:36] everything that we have need of we're
[1:32:39] standing just like they stood in Haggai
[1:32:41] and it's time to go back to
[1:32:44] righteousness it's time to go back to
[1:32:46] restoration it's time to go back to the
[1:32:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's time to
[1:32:51] go in living day-in day-out according to
[1:32:54] the power of Almighty God amen because
[1:32:56] the land this Holy Ghost land that we
[1:32:58] live in is not like the land of Laodicea
[1:33:00] it's not like the land of Egypt or you
[1:33:03] live according to your own works your
[1:33:04] own doings your own shrines it's the
[1:33:07] land where you were in partnership with
[1:33:09] Jehovah amen and he will send his rain
[1:33:13] upon you in your in his new seasons to
[1:33:16] bring the fruit up in your own life amen
[1:33:19] amen and so what you do is you just keep
[1:33:22] just keep drinking and pushing just keep
[1:33:25] drinking and pushing drinking and
[1:33:27] pushing amen
[1:33:28] amen and as you'll push out the fruits
[1:33:31] of righteousness a man upon your own
[1:33:34] life amen amen God as good as any Saints
[1:33:39] amen
[1:33:41] I just wanted to read this quarter
[1:33:45] brother brands from possessing all
[1:33:47] things he said talking about the promise
[1:33:50] he said yet Abraham had a right to the
[1:33:53] promise and yet and the promise was his
[1:33:58] yet he had to fight to possess it there
[1:34:02] you are the believer today yet we're
[1:34:05] heir to all things work yet we're heir
[1:34:07] to every spiritual blessing every
[1:34:10] physical blessing every blessing the
[1:34:12] Bible promises yet you have to fight
[1:34:15] every inch of it that's the way God's
[1:34:18] got it set up and it's always been that
[1:34:20] way you're honest the truth Saints if
[1:34:23] you want something you got to fight for
[1:34:26] it
[1:34:26] you got a call out for it you got to cry
[1:34:29] out for you say oh brother I wish I was
[1:34:31] a stronger Christian last for it cry out
[1:34:34] for it fight for it it's worth fighting
[1:34:36] for
[1:34:37] amen just as much in Haggai that temple
[1:34:40] was worth fighting for but they left the
[1:34:43] temple in ruins while they built their
[1:34:45] own houses amen and we can look back and
[1:34:48] say how could they do that it's so easy
[1:34:51] for him to say sixteen years that was
[1:34:54] enough time for you to build the temple
[1:34:56] that was enough time for you to build a
[1:34:57] house of worship yeah we'll sit in these
[1:34:59] church pews year after year after year
[1:35:01] in the same condition in the same way
[1:35:04] amen even though the scroll has been
[1:35:06] opened up the scroll has been read we've
[1:35:09] read all the promises we've heard enough
[1:35:11] sermons we've heard enough things and
[1:35:13] yet here we sit here we are where is the
[1:35:16] fruit of God in our lives
[1:35:17] amen God will send down his rain but we
[1:35:20] didn't plant the seed we planted the
[1:35:23] seed but we left when we went off to
[1:35:25] other things so God withheld the rain
[1:35:26] why because we're enig on the
[1:35:29] partnership we went back on the
[1:35:33] partnership it wasn't that they didn't
[1:35:35] return to the land they did return to
[1:35:37] the land but they didn't honor
[1:35:41] the partnership and so God said I am
[1:35:44] calling for a drought amen woe to us if
[1:35:49] we here in the last days experienced a
[1:35:52] drought in our own lives because God is
[1:35:56] coming back soon and we're going to be
[1:35:58] changed in a moment in the twinkling eye
[1:36:00] I will be judged according to the things
[1:36:02] that we did amen
[1:36:03] we'll be we're gonna we're gonna have to
[1:36:05] answer for the life that God has given
[1:36:07] us upon this earth a man because God has
[1:36:10] given us the fountain of living waters
[1:36:13] but what have we done with it what
[1:36:15] fruits will we offer to him what have we
[1:36:18] been doing with all the things the
[1:36:20] promises that God has given to us
[1:36:21] a man ought to set us to a fear that
[1:36:24] somehow we've wasted our time here upon
[1:36:27] the earth Amen that we've wasted another
[1:36:29] year we've wasted another year we've
[1:36:32] wasted another year a man lay set there
[1:36:34] and they wasted 16 years with the
[1:36:37] proclamation of Cirus so in serie when
[1:36:40] God stirred up the heart of Sirius to
[1:36:43] write that Proclamation go back and
[1:36:45] build Jehovah house and they had their
[1:36:48] dream my seventy years I sat there in
[1:36:51] captivity waiting for a moment like that
[1:36:54] waiting for an opportunity and they had
[1:36:56] their opportunity when the opportunity
[1:36:58] came they let their opportunities sit in
[1:37:00] the dust
[1:37:01] Amen so we sitting there just like in
[1:37:04] Ephesians there God has blessed us with
[1:37:05] all spiritual blessings but we sit here
[1:37:08] with a grand opportunity but woe unto us
[1:37:10] if we don't enter into it amen amen
[1:37:15] you say brother branham I need healing
[1:37:18] the promise is yours but if you ever get
[1:37:21] it it ain't gonna be easy I'm gonna tell
[1:37:23] you that you're gonna have to take it
[1:37:25] away from Satan Satan captures your
[1:37:28] health you've got a right to to Satan
[1:37:30] say give it back hand it over
[1:37:33] I come in the name of the Lord possessor
[1:37:36] of heavens and earth and I am his heir
[1:37:38] give it back
[1:37:40] amen amen that's what God does amen I am
[1:37:46] an heir of all things
[1:37:47] amen it's given to me I'm an heir I can
[1:37:50] claim everything that God promised me
[1:37:53] amen there you are
[1:37:54] it
[1:37:55] mine my you know it just has to be a
[1:37:59] boldness within us to know who we are to
[1:38:02] know where we stand and to know that we
[1:38:04] have the proclamation behind us we have
[1:38:08] the authority of a message behind us
[1:38:11] amen in the message this last day
[1:38:14] message is an authority amen
[1:38:17] because when God sends a prophet to
[1:38:20] bring a people out of something then
[1:38:22] they have an authority behind them to go
[1:38:25] in and March and do and be the people
[1:38:28] that God called them to be they had that
[1:38:30] authority behind them and so they can go
[1:38:33] and they and they don't have to just go
[1:38:35] oh I wonder what I should do here I
[1:38:37] wonder what I should do there well I'm
[1:38:39] afraid I don't want to do too much I
[1:38:41] don't want to do this
[1:38:42] remember God he gave the parable of the
[1:38:44] talents they meant and there were men
[1:38:46] that they were given God's own
[1:38:48] purchasing power
[1:38:50] that's what talent was it was money it
[1:38:52] was a purchasing power
[1:38:53] one man was given five talents another
[1:38:55] man was given two talents another man is
[1:38:57] given one talent they're given the
[1:38:59] purchasing power of God yes amen and
[1:39:03] they took the purchasing power of God
[1:39:05] and one man says I took your purchasing
[1:39:08] power I took it and I went and I doubled
[1:39:10] it another man says I took your two
[1:39:12] talents and I doubled them first man
[1:39:14] says I took the purchasing power of God
[1:39:16] and I buried it in the earth my and so
[1:39:22] do we have been given the purchasing
[1:39:24] power of God amen
[1:39:26] to call those things that are not as
[1:39:27] though they are amen if you need
[1:39:29] something call out for it cry out for it
[1:39:32] we otherwise if you do not cry out for
[1:39:35] it what are you doing you have the
[1:39:37] purchasing power of God in you right now
[1:39:39] yes you have it right now inside of you
[1:39:43] amen and even the weakest brother Brad
[1:39:47] said the weakest Saint when he gets on
[1:39:49] his knees causes Hell to tremble why
[1:39:53] because you have the purchasing power
[1:39:55] inside of you right now because you can
[1:39:58] cry out to God for it amen
[1:40:00] but what do you do if you you never cry
[1:40:03] out then you are that one that buried
[1:40:06] the purchasing power inside the dirt
[1:40:08] the bureau and body of flesh if you
[1:40:12] never cry out that scripture is talking
[1:40:14] of you and he said take away that from
[1:40:19] him what she seemed to have give it to
[1:40:21] somebody else and that man went out
[1:40:23] there crying and wailing gnashing teeth
[1:40:25] amen why because God gave them the
[1:40:29] talent yeah talent there is money
[1:40:31] it was God's own money God's own
[1:40:33] purchasing power and he buried it in the
[1:40:35] dirt and so God's own / God's purchasing
[1:40:38] power is his own word and faith and that
[1:40:43] word to make it come to pass amen and so
[1:40:46] when you take the word and you bury it
[1:40:48] inside yourself and you never put it to
[1:40:50] use then you are the one that keeps it
[1:40:54] buried in the earth amen and then you'll
[1:40:57] stand there in 16 years of being a
[1:40:59] Christian sitting on the Pew with no
[1:41:02] fruit to show for it then you are the
[1:41:05] one in Haggai says they spoke of much
[1:41:07] but it came too little you put yearned
[1:41:11] wages but he put them in a bag with
[1:41:12] holes in them and when you brought it in
[1:41:14] I blew on it why because my house is
[1:41:17] lying waste you didn't build a house of
[1:41:20] worship
[1:41:20] he didn't glorify God with your own life
[1:41:23] Amen you built your own house but you
[1:41:27] wouldn't build a house of praise in your
[1:41:29] own heart unto me a man you didn't
[1:41:31] worship me amen amen but God's placed
[1:41:34] the everlasting resource inside of us
[1:41:37] amen to call those things that are not
[1:41:40] as though they are but now it's up to
[1:41:42] you if you can write rise up in faith
[1:41:46] and speak those things out and use God's
[1:41:49] purchasing power to go and purchase you
[1:41:52] overcoming life in Christ amen to
[1:41:57] purchase you a victorious life in Christ
[1:42:00] to purchase you fruits that will never
[1:42:04] ever fail jesus said store up your
[1:42:06] treasure in heaven because those
[1:42:08] treasures can never be taken away from
[1:42:09] you a man then you'll have praise not of
[1:42:12] man but from praise from God himself and
[1:42:16] it wouldn't that glory wouldn't isn't
[1:42:17] that glorious
[1:42:19] that's what he do hey man let's just
[1:42:21] stand hey man I can just see Jesus there
[1:42:25] watching them celebrate watching them
[1:42:28] worship as they're carrying those jugs
[1:42:30] of water dancing and singing and
[1:42:32] shouting the light from the pillars
[1:42:34] shiny all over Jerusalem from a lion and
[1:42:37] everybody is worshipping and praising
[1:42:39] God and dancing and finally he couldn't
[1:42:42] stand any more and he says this is all
[1:42:44] speaking of me you come unto me and
[1:42:47] drink and I'll pour out unto you rivers
[1:42:50] of living water and your belly shall be
[1:42:52] that you will be like a tree planted by
[1:42:54] the rivers of living water amen and now
[1:42:56] that same promise is still available in
[1:42:59] to us amen amen let's just bow our heads
[1:43:01] in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father what
[1:43:07] a great opportunity we know that you
[1:43:10] have not withheld anything from your
[1:43:13] bride but you have given the
[1:43:15] proclamation all spiritual blessings in
[1:43:19] Christ Jesus I've been given unto us
[1:43:22] according to Ephesians Lord we claim it
[1:43:24] if you don't know what else to do but
[1:43:27] just to say yes Lord yes and amen
[1:43:29] it's mine Lord I'm gonna be that Bible
[1:43:32] character I am gonna be that one in the
[1:43:35] last days that's fill with the Holy
[1:43:37] Ghost I don't have to be this
[1:43:39] denomination over here or this over here
[1:43:41] I am a standalone with Christ
[1:43:47] I am the Christian the Spirit of the
[1:43:50] Lord God is upon me because he has
[1:43:52] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:43:55] poor bind up the brokenhearted to set at
[1:43:58] liberty those that are bruised to
[1:44:02] release the captives reach sight to the
[1:44:06] blind spirit of our God is upon me to do
[1:44:10] all those things so is the Spirit of the
[1:44:13] Lord God every truth
[1:44:15] and have the purchasing power within
[1:44:17] themselves if they would just cry out
[1:44:21] all things are possible to believe he's
[1:44:25] paid every debt he's restored all things
[1:44:29] and we live in the day of restoration
[1:44:33] all the years that read away from the
[1:44:36] right now are restored we're living like
[1:44:40] we are in the Garden of Eden before the
[1:44:42] fall all these promises were restored
[1:44:44] with the power of a proclamation a
[1:44:46] message that we can be anything where
[1:44:50] ever you want to be you can be it amen
[1:44:54] however you want to serve your Lord just
