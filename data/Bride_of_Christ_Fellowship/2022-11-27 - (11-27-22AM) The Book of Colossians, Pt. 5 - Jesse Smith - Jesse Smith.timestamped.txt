[1:49] of the father and of Christ in whom are
[1:53] HID all the treasures of wisdom and
[1:57] knowledge praise God
[1:58] how many believe that that every
[2:00] Treasure of wisdom and knowledge is in
[2:02] Christ Jesus praise God
[2:04] any treasure you're searching for in
[2:06] your life
[2:07] any great uh any great thing you can
[2:10] attain to in life it's all hid in one
[2:13] place
[2:14] in Christ
[2:16] and notice it said hid
[2:18] that gives you a good understanding you
[2:20] have to search for it
[2:22] yeah let's have one more word of prayer
[2:23] if we can hear by God's grace Heavenly
[2:24] Father we just come reverently
[2:26] and we ask that the great Holy Spirit
[2:28] Lord will do what only he can do Lord
[2:29] God I am nothing the people here we're
[2:32] all nothing of our own selves but Lord
[2:34] you did Place gifts inside of our lives
[2:36] and those gifts are special powers the
[2:38] the Greek says the Lord God special
[2:40] abilities where Lord if we if we can
[2:43] yield to your spirit Lord you can use
[2:45] those special abilities
[2:47] so Lord we just trust that the Holy
[2:49] Spirit Lord will be pleased with our
[2:50] worship forgive us of any sin any evil
[2:52] words any evil thoughts any evil Deeds
[2:55] Lord God forgive us oh God forgive me
[2:57] your humble servant Lord I realize I'm
[2:59] nothing Lord and without you we can do
[3:01] nothing but with you Lord we're more
[3:03] than conquerors with you Lord we can say
[3:05] greater is he that's in me than he
[3:07] that's in the world Hallelujah the great
[3:09] one is in us today so Lord move through
[3:11] us and minister to each one today we ask
[3:13] it in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[3:15] said amen God bless you as you're being
[3:17] seated praise God
[3:22] okay so we'll try to preach an hour here
[3:24] we'll see how that goes and uh
[3:26] and then we will try to have communion
[3:28] here
[3:29] I think it's a good idea so thanks hun
[3:30] that's a good idea I appreciate that
[3:32] I didn't think about that
[3:34] so we'll start here in Colossians
[3:36] chapter two I'll do a little review you
[3:37] know
[3:38] um I haven't preached on this subject
[3:39] since September
[3:41] and uh
[3:43] you have a lot of subjects on my heart
[3:45] it's the trouble is just always finding
[3:47] what what to preach because there is so
[3:49] much to preach
[3:51] like as I said on Wednesday the Bible is
[3:53] so concentrated you know this one
[3:55] scripture can have so much so many Deep
[3:57] Thoughts in it and then it could be even
[3:59] compound prophetic on top of that
[4:01] it can apply to one generation and then
[4:04] a future generation so
[4:07] we're thankful for God's grace I'm glad
[4:09] it's that way praise God I'm I'm glad
[4:10] we're not just I don't have nothing to
[4:12] preach or we have nothing to read we
[4:13] have nothing I'm glad there's so much
[4:15] truth that every time we go back there's
[4:17] another there's another meal waiting for
[4:19] us praise God hallelujah I'm very
[4:21] thankful for that by God's grace
[4:23] so let's look at part five here of the
[4:25] book of Colossians you can switch over
[4:27] how to govern a few quotes to
[4:29] a few scriptures to show uh we'll begin
[4:32] looking at this thought here today
[4:36] you know I was thinking that quote from
[4:37] Brother bran I mean he says Jesus Christ
[4:40] should be the Principal theme of our
[4:42] living of our speaking of our acting of
[4:44] our entire lives and he said if you
[4:47] don't see Jesus Christ in every verse go
[4:49] back and read it again amen so how many
[4:51] times have we read the book of
[4:52] Colossians or you know just any book in
[4:54] general I believe it behooves us to go
[4:56] back and read it again and no doubt
[4:58] we'll see more of Christ in there
[5:00] Hallelujah so that's what we want to do
[5:01] today we want to look here uh to the
[5:03] book of Colossians I'm going to do a
[5:05] quick review and uh
[5:08] I I want to if I want to look here uh
[5:12] actually verse 2 of chapter one and just
[5:16] remember who this was written to this
[5:19] book was written to the Saints so that
[5:22] means to the separated ones and look how
[5:24] you are all separated ones you've
[5:26] separated yourself from the worldly
[5:28] endeavors
[5:29] that's just for today but your whole
[5:31] life you separated yourself from the
[5:33] influence of sin
[5:35] so this is clearly true clearly proves
[5:37] we are the Saints how our lives proves
[5:40] we are separated from the things of the
[5:42] world Hallelujah like that song says the
[5:45] things I used to do I do them no more
[5:47] the light that I used to live I don't
[5:49] live that anymore praise God I'm a new
[5:51] creation I'm a brand new man old things
[5:53] have passed away I've been born again
[5:55] more than a conqueror that's what I am
[5:57] Hallelujah I'm a new creation I'm a
[5:59] brand new man hallelujah thank God Amen
[6:01] that he makes all things new Hallelujah
[6:05] you know there was a time I'm sure you
[6:07] remember as a sinner there's a Time
[6:08] Church wasn't new
[6:09] there was a time in your life probably
[6:11] Church wasn't the best part of your week
[6:13] I can remember that quite well for 19
[6:15] years Church wasn't the best part of my
[6:17] life but for all these years since
[6:19] praise God these 23 years since church
[6:22] has been the greatest part of my life
[6:23] amen never gets old Hallelujah yes we
[6:26] got to press through the flesh we've got
[6:27] to press through the trials and press
[6:29] through the Mind battles and press
[6:30] through the sickness but if we can just
[6:32] press beyond that Hallelujah we can
[6:34] enter into the anointing of the Lord
[6:35] praise God and we can say like David my
[6:38] cup is not half full my cup isn't empty
[6:40] my cup runs over praise God I'm looking
[6:43] for a running over Cup today amen
[6:45] hallelujah thank God Amen let us have
[6:48] that a cup that runs over with the joy
[6:50] of the Lord amen but the victory of
[6:52] Christ Jesus our lord but verse 2 says
[6:54] to the Saints and faithful brethren in
[6:56] Christ which are at colossi
[6:59] Grace be unto you and peace
[7:02] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
[7:04] Christ now that's interesting they're
[7:06] they're Saints they are faithful Saints
[7:08] as well Hallelujah and that's what I
[7:10] appreciate you you all of you for being
[7:12] faithful praise God I'm to worry is he
[7:15] going to be here today is she going to
[7:16] be here today am I going to hear from
[7:18] them or not you know I don't have that
[7:20] we don't have those issues praise God
[7:21] hallelujah because we have faithful
[7:23] Saints Hallelujah faithful Brethren that
[7:26] are separated to the uh the the doctrine
[7:29] of Christ you know in fact you're so
[7:30] faithful you would probably come here
[7:32] sick if we didn't ask you to come right
[7:34] you probably spread it all around right
[7:37] you spread all your signals all around
[7:38] if we didn't ask you to maybe use
[7:40] caution sometimes make sure you're
[7:43] letting the Holy Spirit praise God
[7:45] that's how we've gotten all sick in the
[7:46] past you know we've we've sometimes been
[7:49] together and we've been so faithful that
[7:51] we wouldn't miss it for the world praise
[7:52] God you wouldn't miss gathering with the
[7:54] Saints and being with God's people
[7:56] I just think it's you know also as we
[7:59] get more or as we review some of these
[8:00] thoughts I think it's beautiful that
[8:02] Paul wishes them Grace and peace
[8:05] I remember this was a church that would
[8:07] likely be re or be destroyed by an
[8:09] earthquake in less than 10 years
[8:12] but Paul's wishing them Grace
[8:14] and peace Hallelujah
[8:17] and yet God knew and this will I want to
[8:20] get to this eventually God never warned
[8:22] them of the earthquake in this letter
[8:24] he never warned him
[8:26] because the natural disasters pale in
[8:30] comparison to spiritual disasters that
[8:32] people can face
[8:34] praise God like we preached that sermon
[8:36] with the 13 metaphors of a Judas
[8:38] Iscariot
[8:40] that type of Destruction or that type of
[8:42] Shipwrecked is way worse than a natural
[8:44] earthquake
[8:45] or a natural shipwreck or a natural car
[8:47] accident the spiritual destruction the
[8:50] spiritual Shipwrecked is way worse
[8:53] because there's Eternal consequences to
[8:55] that
[8:57] but a natural disaster or a car accident
[8:59] or a earthquake or tsunami or something
[9:02] you can clean up from that you can
[9:04] recover from that if you survive
[9:06] right but if it's a Judas Iscariot and
[9:09] someone uh crosses the line between
[9:11] mercy and judgment there's no coming
[9:13] back for that
[9:14] as the Bible said with Esau he sought it
[9:16] with tears but he couldn't find it
[9:18] so that means he had worldly sorrow he
[9:21] didn't have Godly sorrow
[9:23] right like like the book of Corinthians
[9:24] speaks about
[9:25] like Judas he had worldly sorrow well I
[9:28] should not have betrayed an innocent man
[9:30] but Godly sorrow would have been said
[9:32] would have said Jesus Take Me Back
[9:34] praise God
[9:35] Hallelujah try me again I want to come
[9:37] back have mercy on me
[9:39] but see it wasn't the right kind of
[9:41] Sorrow
[9:42] and so we have to understand that that
[9:44] God's grace and his peace is probably
[9:47] one of the most valuable things we can
[9:49] have in this life
[9:51] because as we can see the world is
[9:53] falling apart around us every day
[9:56] every week every month every year it's
[9:59] falling apart more and more uh at a at a
[10:03] more deceptive rate or at a more at a
[10:06] faster rate we'd say and it's actually
[10:08] more deceptive than ever this is the
[10:10] most deceptive time to live and so we
[10:14] know that we preached on that but let's
[10:16] just review The Colossus background
[10:17] again so here this is the ancient city
[10:20] of colossi remember uh
[10:23] it's 100 miles from Ephesus and 12 miles
[10:26] from laodicea
[10:28] it's it's unexcavated they haven't dug
[10:30] it up
[10:31] uh there it is on the map of modern day
[10:33] Turkey of Ephesus laodicea and then
[10:35] colossi is quite close to that
[10:38] so just as an idea again of that uh now
[10:41] they they became famous because they
[10:42] could make purple wool that's how they
[10:45] became a great City
[10:47] um kind of like Lydia was a seller of
[10:49] purple you know
[10:51] uh in the the city of Philippi but also
[10:55] colossi also adopted a similar practice
[10:57] and that's how they became wealthy and
[10:59] they became an important Roman uh Roman
[11:03] city on a route here of course the the
[11:06] history says the city was an important
[11:08] stop on a major Roman trade route
[11:10] because Rome was ruling the world at
[11:11] that time naturally now they're ruling
[11:13] it spiritually
[11:14] now it was destroyed by an earthquake
[11:17] between 60 and 62
[11:19] A.D less than a decade after receiving
[11:22] Paul's letter now here's what I found
[11:23] out today I was reading today it was
[11:25] actually rebuilt but it never revived to
[11:27] its original state
[11:29] so it's as if God you know shook that
[11:31] City
[11:32] literally
[11:33] God literally shook that City in order
[11:36] to shake it spiritually and then by by
[11:38] the year 400 it was no longer a city
[11:40] it's the pile of ruins that it was
[11:43] and so we see again that that that rule
[11:45] that God has a time and season for
[11:47] everything
[11:49] the Bible says we have no continuing
[11:52] City here
[11:53] I don't care how fancy New York looks
[11:55] there's gonna of course it's Fallen
[11:57] apart now because in leadership they got
[11:58] I don't care how big you know Los
[12:00] Angeles looks or or Hong Kong or any of
[12:03] those cities we don't have a continuing
[12:05] City
[12:06] they're going to fall apart if time goes
[12:08] on
[12:09] they're gonna have to rebuild and
[12:11] eventually God's gonna start all over
[12:12] again and renovate the whole outside of
[12:14] the earth and God's going to create a
[12:16] civilization that's built on
[12:18] righteousness amen and Jesus Will Rule
[12:20] Every Nation with a rod of iron amen
[12:23] but these are reminders church we should
[12:25] take this as a reminder all of your
[12:27] possessions someday might be a mound of
[12:29] dirt
[12:31] all the work we've done at our house in
[12:33] Doylestown one day it might be just a
[12:34] mound of dirt in fact we drive by houses
[12:37] right on our road used to be beautiful
[12:38] houses
[12:40] but then they knocked them all down and
[12:42] now it's literally just a pile of rocks
[12:44] at one time it was a nice house
[12:47] but because it didn't take care of it or
[12:49] maybe there was mold there or something
[12:50] they let it go and it became now all it
[12:53] is it's not even a mound it's a pile of
[12:55] rocks not even a mound of dirt
[12:59] like the Bible says let us not boast of
[13:01] Tomorrow praise God
[13:03] amen
[13:04] let us be confident in the word of God
[13:06] that he's spoken to us today praise God
[13:09] and let us seek God's Mercy For Today
[13:11] Hallelujah
[13:12] amen
[13:14] just a great reminder here that all
[13:16] great things in the eyes of man come to
[13:18] an end
[13:20] and the word of the Lord endures forever
[13:22] praise God
[13:24] I love it colossi the whole cities in
[13:26] this pile ruins but here we are we got
[13:28] the word of God preserved today praise
[13:30] God
[13:31] Hallelujah the earthquake could destroy
[13:34] this and time could destroy the city but
[13:36] the word of God stands stronger than
[13:38] ever praise God Eternal as ever it's as
[13:41] faithful as ever praise God let's put
[13:43] our hope and our trust in Jesus Christ
[13:45] amen the word of God
[13:48] remember these Saints never saw Paul's
[13:51] face just like our church and our
[13:53] prophet
[13:54] yet we can still be Believers Hallelujah
[13:56] we can still manifest Jesus Christ for
[13:58] our day it was likely epperphress
[14:00] started this ministry
[14:03] and was composed of Gentiles and Jews
[14:08] and you'll see that you know the the
[14:10] composition of the church determined
[14:13] what they struggle with
[14:14] and you're going to see that in this
[14:16] chapter we probably won't get to it
[14:17] today
[14:17] but let me just say that for us the
[14:19] composition of our church is going to
[14:21] determine what we struggle with
[14:24] now because and culturally now I'm
[14:26] talking about culturally Jews and
[14:28] gentiles now all of us are Gentiles but
[14:31] we come from different backgrounds I
[14:33] don't think bang would mind me sharing
[14:34] this but you know with his parents in
[14:36] Laos they had a lot of superstitions
[14:38] right he wouldn't mind me saying that
[14:40] does that bother you brother it don't
[14:41] bother him just honestly they have
[14:43] honest superstitions like they'll kill
[14:45] certain animals and they'll believe if
[14:46] you do certain things you know you get
[14:48] there's certain results but it's not led
[14:50] by Christianity or it's not led by the
[14:51] spirit of God it's led by superstition
[14:54] you know and because of our backgrounds
[14:56] and because of our our
[14:58] ethnic backgrounds it determines a lot
[15:00] of our attitudes about God
[15:03] we keep some we all of us keep feelings
[15:06] and memories from our past
[15:09] right and so how we were raised is going
[15:12] to determine how the enemy May battle us
[15:14] today
[15:15] and you'll see that in chapter two Paul
[15:18] has to lay out all these uh doctrines
[15:21] that they're battling all these ideas uh
[15:24] that they're battling
[15:25] now for us I'm looking at Emma and I'm
[15:27] thinking about me and Emma you know how
[15:28] we grew up in you know Emma's my niece
[15:30] and we all grew up in the liver Center
[15:31] area we basically grew up in modern day
[15:33] laodicea farm farm town you know
[15:36] and so
[15:38] you know our battles are going to be
[15:40] more intellectual because we were raised
[15:42] in an intellectual
[15:44] sit style right like now bang that was
[15:46] more spiritual right his parents were
[15:48] raised in a more spiritual they believe
[15:50] in superstitions and and you'll see that
[15:52] exact thing in Colossians chapter two
[15:54] Colossians chapter 2 is a beautiful
[15:56] chapter as we're getting going to get
[15:58] into it
[15:59] um it's actually where I preach
[16:00] Christmas out of the the place where I
[16:03] find this Christmas in the Bible is
[16:04] Colossians chapter 2 of all places I'm
[16:07] talking about the modern Christmas you
[16:08] know how how people uh worship at
[16:10] Christmas time or don't worship at
[16:12] Christmas time
[16:14] uh but you know Apple fris had visited
[16:17] colossi come and told Paul how Paul was
[16:20] in prison told him about all the
[16:22] heresies they were battling and so Paul
[16:24] wrote the letter to bring them
[16:26] correction
[16:28] the city church and I'm just kind of
[16:30] preaching off the cuff here a little bit
[16:31] but you know there's times if you see
[16:33] somebody struggling and you know
[16:35] somebody else could help them you should
[16:36] let them know
[16:38] epipheris a preacher let Paul know and
[16:41] then Paul as the Apostle they never even
[16:44] met Paul but they knew about Paul Paul
[16:46] sends a letter to correct them
[16:49] so that there's a fine line between
[16:51] tattling on somebody or gossiping about
[16:52] somebody but but then sharing something
[16:55] that they might get help for it
[16:57] that's what I've you know I've counseled
[16:58] with amen numerous times over the years
[17:00] and other of you as well or sometimes we
[17:02] have to talk about specific struggles we
[17:04] have
[17:06] or struggles in the church
[17:08] we we do that though of course very
[17:10] carefully
[17:12] but we have to do it if we do it with
[17:13] the spirit of Christ it's done in the
[17:15] right way
[17:16] like the the saying I always say is I
[17:18] want to say something about somebody as
[17:20] if they're standing right here
[17:22] now we don't want to do it all the time
[17:24] but there's times you might have to do
[17:25] that the same thing happened to the
[17:27] Corinthian Church they told Paul about
[17:30] all the struggles and Paul had to write
[17:31] them a letter rebuke them and and uh
[17:34] think about the attitude you know they
[17:36] could have had a bad attitude against
[17:37] you know the person who shared with Paul
[17:38] they could have said oh you're telling
[17:40] my troubles you're you're telling my
[17:41] struggles now it's never good to gossip
[17:44] it's never good to gossip but if you
[17:46] know you can help them and you're led by
[17:48] the Holy Spirit and love to share about
[17:50] a person's weaknesses in order that
[17:52] might be helped that could that could be
[17:54] the spirit of God you have to look at
[17:56] the fruits of it what comes out of it
[17:58] amen does good fruit come out of it does
[18:00] repentance come out of it praise God
[18:02] what is the fruit that comes out of it
[18:04] because uh that's what Jesus says wisdom
[18:07] is Justified of her fruits
[18:09] just so you know I'm not telling anybody
[18:11] to gossip I'm just saying there's times
[18:13] where you need to share something with
[18:16] somebody in order that they might
[18:17] someone else might help the person you
[18:19] see
[18:20] as you see a person in need that's why
[18:22] you know over the years I've asked Beau
[18:23] and Adam and amen and who are different
[18:25] ones you know do you have any neighbors
[18:26] I think I've asked Bank do you have any
[18:28] neighbors that need any food for
[18:29] Christmas or Thanksgiving or do anybody
[18:31] who's struggling
[18:33] it's not that I want to know people
[18:34] struggling it's not that I want to know
[18:37] you know details about people's lives
[18:39] but I want to help people praise God
[18:42] and if you know anybody who can help out
[18:43] let's help them out by the grace of God
[18:48] so I just think it's a an important
[18:50] point to stay in here that Paul never
[18:53] met them Paul didn't know their
[18:55] struggles but he was informed of their
[18:58] struggles and the spirit of God led him
[19:00] to discern their struggles right he knew
[19:03] about it and then write the word of God
[19:04] to them praise God
[19:08] and church don't ever underestimate the
[19:10] power of a letter
[19:12] Hallelujah
[19:14] how many can raise your hand say uh uh
[19:16] someone's written them a letter before
[19:17] it's been very powerful to them
[19:19] anybody can say that okay a couple
[19:20] people praise God that think about that
[19:23] that's all the church had at colossi was
[19:25] a letter
[19:26] you know of course they have the spirit
[19:27] of God but then the letter and the
[19:29] spirit of God had to come quick in that
[19:31] letter and that letter would build them
[19:33] up in Christ
[19:35] words on a page amen words on a scroll
[19:38] written words amen the word came to
[19:42] anoint the written word praise God
[19:45] the word Jesus Christ the spirit of
[19:47] Jesus Christ
[19:49] the Eternal one the eternal spirit
[19:51] praise God came to anoint the written
[19:54] word the Eternal Word Quicken the
[19:56] written word and that quickened the
[19:58] Believers amen
[19:59] Glory that's how I know if I preach this
[20:01] today if you're a Believer and the
[20:04] spirit of God is in you and the spirit
[20:05] of God is in me it will Quicken your
[20:07] mortal body praise God
[20:10] and you can leave out of here a quick in
[20:11] person moved and quickened if I can use
[20:15] brother Brian's title there he got it
[20:17] from another brother too so I'm going to
[20:18] use it as well you know
[20:20] I could borrow from the other other guy
[20:21] he got it from
[20:23] but see I noticed this the Holy Ghost
[20:25] never warned them
[20:26] about the earthquake he just warned them
[20:28] about false Doctrine
[20:30] why because you can recover from an
[20:32] earthquake you can't recover from false
[20:34] Doctrine
[20:34] it's a it's 11 right it's a canker it's
[20:39] a cancer
[20:40] and you can't recover from it so the
[20:43] Holy Ghost never said well in about
[20:45] three years everybody wants to move out
[20:46] of the city you're going to lose your
[20:47] homes you're going to lose all you work
[20:49] for can you imagine that some of them
[20:50] saints probably lost everything they
[20:52] work for
[20:53] but really that's not what they were
[20:55] working for
[20:57] your Treasures are not on this Earth
[20:59] Amen in fact that's what he tells him in
[21:01] chapter three set your affections on
[21:04] things above oh now I can see why I did
[21:05] it amen now I can see why set your
[21:07] affection on things above because
[21:09] there's a coming earthquake think about
[21:10] the earthquake coming to Los Angeles
[21:12] there's a coming earthquake do not set
[21:14] your affections on Earthly things keep
[21:17] your eyes on Jesus amen keep your sight
[21:19] on Christ Hallelujah keep looking to him
[21:22] keep looking to the sky keep looking for
[21:24] the Rapture praise God keep looking for
[21:26] his mercies because he comes so all
[21:28] those that look for him and love him
[21:30] Hallelujah
[21:33] see a spiritual disaster far outweighs
[21:36] any natural disaster we might go through
[21:43] I think churches we get more mature in
[21:45] Christ as we get older in Christ we
[21:46] realize losing Natural Things is really
[21:49] no no big deal
[21:54] the the you know the debts we may have
[21:56] financially the what we don't have
[21:59] physically that bothers us less as we
[22:02] mature in Christ because we realize it's
[22:04] all perishing anyway
[22:06] I think the word is fleeting the Bible
[22:08] because these are all fleeting things
[22:10] they're all vain things
[22:13] right it's all vanity
[22:15] the natural things we're talking about
[22:17] but the spiritual things are what we
[22:20] labor for praise God
[22:22] the spiritual Rewards
[22:24] are what we live for and the Bible is
[22:27] Jesus says you store up Treasures in
[22:29] Heaven praise God
[22:31] Hallelujah so yeah that was that was an
[22:33] interesting thought I had I felt it was
[22:34] led by the Holy Spirit to share with you
[22:38] now remember the purpose is brother
[22:39] Raymond had a vision and he saw all
[22:42] these comments running to him
[22:44] and he says does every leader have to be
[22:45] judged like Paul he said yes
[22:49] he said if Paul's group goes in Soul of
[22:51] mine because I preach exactly the same
[22:53] word
[22:54] the water baptism and the millions
[22:56] screamed out we're resting on that
[22:59] he said if I had only known this before
[23:01] I come I would make people come here
[23:04] I wish we could make people come here I
[23:07] always be good my goodness but see we're
[23:09] resting on what Paul preached because
[23:11] Paul said God will judge all of our
[23:13] hearts think about that God will judge
[23:15] all the secrets of our hearts by Jesus
[23:17] Christ
[23:18] according to the book of Colossians
[23:20] right Galatians Ephesians Philippians
[23:22] Colossians Romans right Hebrews
[23:26] Thessalon Thessalonians the Lehman all
[23:29] these books Titus God is going to judge
[23:32] The Seekers of our hearts by Jesus
[23:33] Christ
[23:35] according to the word of God
[23:38] okay so for resting on Paul's gospel we
[23:40] didn't know what he said and I think
[23:41] this chapter is a beautiful chapter here
[23:44] um because Paul wrote the whole Council
[23:45] of God and you'll see some of the things
[23:46] they battled I preached this one in
[23:48] Indiana just a reminder brother Branham
[23:49] said of course thus saith the Lord says
[23:51] thus saith Malachi chapter 4.
[23:53] he said he will turn the hearts of the
[23:55] children back to the doctrine of the
[23:57] fathers back to the Bible
[23:59] out of these denominational difference
[24:01] come back to the Bible back to God
[24:02] that's what he would do notice what a
[24:04] great time we're living I'm gonna
[24:06] believe it's a great time to live praise
[24:07] God I believe any time I'm still alive
[24:09] is a great time Hallelujah
[24:11] could I get another chance to serve
[24:13] Jesus amen now remember the outline here
[24:15] chapter one the outline was Paul's
[24:17] Apostolic reading and then his beautiful
[24:19] prayer remember he prayed for five
[24:21] things for the Saints it's probably the
[24:22] most beautiful prayer I've ever read in
[24:23] the Bible
[24:24] that there's five things he prayed you
[24:26] have all the wisdom and the Revelation
[24:27] and and long-suffering and Thanksgiving
[24:29] it was just such a beautiful prayer when
[24:31] we preached that
[24:32] and then he looked at the Supreme deed
[24:33] of Christ that we looked at the power of
[24:35] Christ and then we saw the mystery of
[24:37] Christ in you the hope of glory
[24:39] it works in us mightily
[24:42] think about that church the world just
[24:44] goes along with the flow of of a stream
[24:47] think about a stream the world is like
[24:49] those leaves they just get pulled but we
[24:51] are going against the grain
[24:54] how much more strength does it take to
[24:55] go against the grain praise God we're
[24:58] not being carried away on a flowery bed
[24:59] of ease While others fought to win the
[25:02] prize and sail through bloody Seas
[25:03] Hallelujah
[25:04] see you got to understand whenever you
[25:07] go against the grain God is working and
[25:09] you mightily praise God
[25:11] whenever you go against the grain or the
[25:13] wave of laodicea and you fight against
[25:15] that and you try to draw closer to
[25:17] Christ you're making progress it might
[25:20] be slow progress but you're not being
[25:22] Carried Away by hell amen
[25:24] you're making progress It's Working you
[25:27] mightily you're going against all the
[25:29] demons out of hell you're going against
[25:30] every Temptation you're living you're
[25:33] you're you're you're you're you're
[25:34] living a life free from deception you
[25:36] see the reality of the Bible the reality
[25:38] of God the reality of Christ amen the
[25:41] reality of the Rapture praise God you
[25:43] see the reality of it praise God and
[25:45] it's God working in you not a small
[25:47] thing but a mighty thing amen
[25:50] It's mighty praise God
[25:52] the word of God works in us mightily
[25:56] praise God
[25:57] now in chapter two we'll get probably
[25:59] just a verse seven we'll probably just
[26:00] get to there
[26:01] and then maybe Wednesday or we'll see
[26:03] however the Lord leads me I never quite
[26:05] know exactly what I'm going to preach
[26:08] I want to preach on uh over stimulation
[26:10] maybe tonight I want to preach on that
[26:11] because I feel like we're always over
[26:12] stimulated by cell phones I kind of want
[26:14] to look at cell phones tonight if I can
[26:16] maybe by God's grace like I said maybe
[26:18] we might do a kids Bible study or we can
[26:20] do a kids Bible study on that
[26:23] um but chapter two has the this was our
[26:25] text verses one to three the treasures
[26:26] in the mystery of the godhead
[26:29] um
[26:30] and then notice Paul
[26:33] after these after this beautiful
[26:34] introduction after this prayers and all
[26:36] the work of the Cross and the baptism
[26:38] Holy Ghost
[26:39] and all the Treasures of the godhead
[26:41] then he starts getting into what they're
[26:43] battling they're battling enticing words
[26:46] and notice they weren't battling riches
[26:50] they weren't battling a physical Army
[26:53] of Roman soldiers that wasn't this
[26:55] Church's battle
[26:57] the church's battle with smooth talkers
[27:02] enticing deceiving speakers Church you
[27:06] got to be real careful who you listen to
[27:09] yeah right
[27:10] you better be very careful you listen to
[27:12] you got to make sure people aren't
[27:14] deceiving you into a sinful habit
[27:18] or a sinful lifestyle I've got to
[27:20] constantly watch my life as well praise
[27:22] God we all have to watch our lives
[27:26] but here's the advice the Holy Ghost
[27:27] will give a church less than 10 years
[27:30] before their Church would be destroyed
[27:31] likely
[27:34] what advice would you give somebody if
[27:36] they had just a certain number of years
[27:37] to live or a certain number of years to
[27:40] have prosperity
[27:44] Paul the advice he gives them is
[27:45] overcome evil spirits
[27:48] and then he gets into some of the
[27:50] specifics philosophy
[27:53] legalism
[27:55] mysticism
[27:57] and I don't even know how to say that
[27:58] ascetism is how you say
[28:01] ascetism I was looking up the
[28:02] definitions earlier
[28:05] um we'll get into each one here as we go
[28:06] on by God's grace
[28:08] but let's look at this verses one to
[28:10] three here I'm already at uh 25 minutes
[28:13] hard to believe that
[28:15] I guess that's my normal uh background
[28:17] right that's my normal review let me
[28:19] review for just a minute this is 25
[28:21] minutes
[28:22] what can I do but I added some new stuff
[28:24] in there too bye guys Grace
[28:25] The Treasure of the mystery of the
[28:27] godhead verse one for I would that ye
[28:29] knew so Paul wishes they knew something
[28:33] Paul wish these Believers could feel his
[28:36] great conflict that he has for them
[28:39] kind of like I wish you how much I cared
[28:41] about you
[28:43] I've never met you I've never seen you
[28:44] face to face but I wish you knew how
[28:47] much I cared
[28:48] and not just for you but them at
[28:50] laodicea so see a real Christian cares
[28:52] about all the people of God
[28:54] praise God now of course there's going
[28:56] to be ones that are closer to us those
[28:57] are the ones that are going to mean the
[28:58] most to us you know we're gonna have
[28:59] more interaction with them we can help
[29:01] them out more
[29:02] um
[29:04] but Paul's heart was not just for the
[29:07] church at colossi it was also for the
[29:09] church at laodicea
[29:11] and he said and for as many as have not
[29:14] seen my face in the flesh
[29:17] so Paul had a great burden for all those
[29:19] who never got to meet him
[29:22] so in other words other preachers had
[29:23] preached to these churches and started
[29:25] the churches but they never got to meet
[29:27] the prophet of the hour they never got
[29:29] to meet the messenger of the hour but I
[29:32] love it the messenger's heart was still
[29:33] with them he was so thankful there was
[29:35] churches there he prayed for them amen
[29:37] hallelujah like he told the Philippians
[29:39] he said I every time I think of you he's
[29:42] every time I remember you I give thanks
[29:43] to God hallelujah upon every remembrance
[29:46] of you
[29:47] I feel about all you and amen on his
[29:49] birthday amen
[29:50] every time I think of you I say thank
[29:52] God for a saint like that Hallelujah
[29:54] thank God for a friend thank God for a
[29:57] Christian that will stand on God's word
[29:59] hallelujah
[30:00] there are few and far between we saw the
[30:02] Baptist Church last week or two weeks
[30:04] yeah last week we see they're a few and
[30:06] far between
[30:07] Pastor said the numbers are dwindling
[30:09] and uh yeah that's what all the research
[30:12] says churchgoer church then this is
[30:14] going down I showed you that article a
[30:16] few months ago about that by I think
[30:18] 2040.
[30:20] um
[30:21] I forget the exact number on it I think
[30:24] it was by 2035 or or 2040 Christianity
[30:26] will no longer be the majority religion
[30:28] in the United States
[30:30] I think uh I think atheism is going to
[30:33] take it over if I'm not mistaken see
[30:34] it's we have to battle the intellectual
[30:36] sphere right that's what we got to
[30:38] battle the intellectual
[30:40] uh spirit so that means we've got to
[30:42] have a spiritual mind praise God we have
[30:44] to be in contact with the Holy Spirit
[30:47] praise God
[30:48] to overcome these spiritual intellectual
[30:51] battles
[30:53] but the word conflict means a fight so
[30:55] this is quite a word Paul Paul wishes
[30:58] they knew the great fight
[31:00] he was fighting for them and of course
[31:02] it hadn't been in prayer because he
[31:03] never met them
[31:05] this is the only letter that we know
[31:06] that he wrote him
[31:08] so he says I wish you knew how I was
[31:10] fighting for you in prayer amen
[31:14] and then of course Paul was praying for
[31:16] them regarding the evils that he's going
[31:18] to write about
[31:20] okay
[31:23] and so this gives us a lesson too you
[31:25] can have family and friends you don't
[31:27] see all the time that doesn't stop you
[31:29] and I from praying for them praise God
[31:32] just because we're not with somebody
[31:33] just go just because we don't see
[31:35] somebody doesn't mean we shouldn't have
[31:36] a burn for them
[31:38] right and Paul as an example he said in
[31:41] first Timothy chapter one his life was
[31:43] an example to all other Christians amen
[31:47] you might persecute the church you might
[31:49] blaspheme against Jesus he said but God
[31:51] save me God had abundant mercy on me so
[31:53] that I might be a pattern to all those
[31:55] who would accept Christ afterwards
[32:00] see church that's why I love that song I
[32:01] can pray to the walls come down
[32:04] if there's nothing else you can do or I
[32:06] can do we can pray Hallelujah
[32:08] and that's where Paul says I wish you
[32:10] knew the fight I was fighting for you in
[32:12] prayer
[32:13] and of course he's going to get bring
[32:15] some rebukes on here in this chapter and
[32:17] a lot of wisdom as well
[32:21] but see this is the so what does that
[32:22] mean church that means we got to have
[32:25] an attitude of battle when it comes to
[32:27] prayer now God help all of us on that
[32:29] let's just be honest there
[32:31] we get so tired I get I don't know about
[32:33] you I'm just speaking for my own
[32:34] experience I get so tired just from life
[32:35] just living life
[32:37] I get mentally tired and physically
[32:38] tired sometimes I don't go into prayer
[32:41] with a with a Warrior's mindset
[32:43] you know rebuking principalities or
[32:45] rebuking Satan and Satan get behind me
[32:47] Church let's be honest sometimes we go
[32:49] we don't go into prayer with that
[32:50] attitude
[32:51] but Paul said I've got a great burden to
[32:54] pray for you and I'm taking A Warrior's
[32:57] attitude amen hallelujah you'll be able
[33:00] you haven't seen my face but I'm
[33:01] trusting you'll see the face of Christ
[33:03] amen hallelujah the face of the Holy
[33:05] Spirit praise God I trust you see that
[33:09] he said I've been fighting a good fight
[33:11] of faith for you Hallelujah
[33:14] praise the Lord
[33:18] now
[33:19] verse 2
[33:21] he said I so he says I wish you knew the
[33:23] great fight now verse two that their
[33:26] hearts might be comfortable so this is
[33:27] what he is fighting for he was fighting
[33:30] in prayer that the Colossians heart
[33:32] might be comforted which means edified
[33:34] or strengthened I was looking up right
[33:35] before I come up I didn't get a chance
[33:37] to write that one down
[33:40] and they would be knit together in love
[33:43] and unto or going towards all the riches
[33:47] of the full Assurance of understanding
[33:50] to the acknowledgment of the mystery of
[33:52] God and of the father and of Christ
[33:54] so he was fighting for their loving
[33:57] Unity now of course here's knit in the
[34:00] Greek it means coalesce to join together
[34:03] to unite or knit together
[34:07] to put together one's mind I'm going to
[34:10] go down that third definition to unite
[34:12] with one another in a conclusion or come
[34:14] to the same opinion amen
[34:16] to prove to demonstrate to teach to
[34:19] instruct Hallelujah
[34:21] Paul says I'm praying that your hearts
[34:22] will be knit together
[34:25] that your mind and my mind and in your
[34:28] mind all of our minds will be as one
[34:30] mind
[34:31] praise God
[34:32] and he was willing think about that he
[34:35] was willing to fight in prayer
[34:37] so they would have one heart and one
[34:39] mind praise God
[34:41] a church honestly a lot of times I'm
[34:44] sure you and I we pray for the Natural
[34:45] Things natural things God help us get
[34:47] well you know help us to not get sick
[34:49] you know help us
[34:50] God help us with the financial needs but
[34:52] Paul is praying God let their hearts be
[34:55] United as one
[34:58] that's right may they have the same
[34:59] heart may they have the same desire
[35:02] as one another
[35:04] Lord please keep them from being divided
[35:06] help them to be United together
[35:10] may they have hearts that are knit
[35:12] together in the love of God
[35:14] I think that's a beautiful prayer don't
[35:16] you that's why I love reading this
[35:17] because it brings a refreshing of what I
[35:19] should be praying for
[35:22] and what all of us should be praying for
[35:23] the most important things we should pray
[35:25] for Paul lays it out right here amen
[35:28] that we'll be loving Christians amen
[35:31] we'll be a family of God we'll have one
[35:33] motive one objective praise God one
[35:35] Mission amen and one Victory and that's
[35:37] that we all have hearts full of love and
[35:40] we manifest the love of Jesus Christ to
[35:42] each and every person
[35:43] Glory
[35:46] of course it's the same Unity from the
[35:48] day of Pentecost remember the Bible said
[35:49] they were one of before the Holy Ghost
[35:51] fell for ten days they were in one
[35:52] Accord the Bible says and then the day
[35:55] of caught the day of Pentecost they were
[35:57] in one Accord in one place amen then the
[35:59] Holy Ghost fell hallelujah praise God
[36:01] thank God
[36:03] and then afterwards in Acts chapter 4
[36:05] the Bible said they had one heart and
[36:08] one Soul praise God and that's when they
[36:10] started selling things to make sure
[36:11] everybody had of course they had some
[36:12] rich Christians right they could sell
[36:14] their whole lands well I only have one
[36:16] land you know these guys had multiple
[36:18] lands to sell
[36:19] I guess I could sell a little plot of my
[36:22] land but
[36:24] be a real small plot
[36:26] don't even own an acre you know but
[36:28] these almost had some rich Christians in
[36:30] there some Jews who got the Holy Ghost
[36:31] they sell some of their lands and they
[36:33] say give this to the the church give it
[36:35] to the people so they can feed the
[36:37] widows they don't have food every day
[36:39] praise God
[36:42] so that's what the same spirit of God
[36:43] does to our hearts it makes our hearts
[36:46] like one heart all of our hearts have
[36:48] the same heartbeat wouldn't that be
[36:50] something Hallelujah we all have the
[36:52] same spiritual heartbeat
[36:54] do the will of God do the will of God do
[36:56] the will of God
[36:58] Hallelujah pray for Unity pray for Unity
[37:01] pray for God's love you know we got the
[37:02] same heartbeat praise God
[37:05] is our brother okay is our sister okay
[37:07] how's everybody doing does anybody need
[37:09] anything you know the same heartbeat
[37:10] praise God
[37:12] but see only God can do that only Jesus
[37:15] can do that only Jesus can sow us
[37:17] together
[37:19] if we do it ourselves it'll probably
[37:20] fall apart right but if Jesus sows it
[37:23] together Hallelujah then it's going to
[37:24] be perfect Hallelujah
[37:26] thank God
[37:28] and I want to break down some of these
[37:30] words here
[37:31] so this strengthened
[37:34] uh and unify these strengthened loving
[37:38] unified hearts
[37:40] would produce the riches or the wealth
[37:43] so see what see what loving each other
[37:45] does loving each other produces riches
[37:48] it produces wealth how many want to be
[37:52] spiritually wealthy notice I said
[37:53] spiritually
[37:56] if you want to be spiritually wealthy
[37:58] then let your heart be knit by the holy
[38:01] spirit with the other believer's hearts
[38:04] that is the way that's the path it's
[38:06] like an equation right be unified in one
[38:08] heart and if you do that plus God God
[38:10] and that will equal spiritual wealth oh
[38:13] hallelujah amen thank God Amen
[38:17] and then that produces when you're
[38:19] spiritually wealthy this produces full
[38:22] Assurance of understanding
[38:25] it's when you love me when we love each
[38:27] other like a family
[38:29] it gives us spiritual riches we're rich
[38:31] in spiritual things and then that gives
[38:33] us a certain confidence amen
[38:37] of understanding so see where confidence
[38:40] comes knowing that God loves you and
[38:42] you're going to be saved and you're
[38:44] filled with the Holy Ghost and you're
[38:46] going the Rapture where does this come
[38:47] from it comes from the love of God
[38:49] knitting your heart amen but you got to
[38:51] submit to that you and I have to submit
[38:54] to that we have to let God help us to
[38:56] love each other more praise God
[38:59] and loving each other more produces this
[39:02] confidence
[39:03] it doesn't produce a doubt the love of
[39:06] God produces confidence that we know
[39:08] absolutely the understanding of Jesus
[39:11] Christ so the more love we have for one
[39:14] another the more we treat one another
[39:15] with love the more certain we'll be of
[39:18] what we believe and what God is going to
[39:20] do praise God
[39:21] oh it's beautiful the more wealthy we
[39:24] are Hallelujah
[39:26] right we can all we should all take a
[39:28] moment here today to check our spiritual
[39:29] bank accounts
[39:31] I check my natural one every day except
[39:33] Sunday I don't check Sunday right
[39:35] because their banks are closed on
[39:36] Saturday night you know so I don't check
[39:38] Sunday but I make sure nobody's I've had
[39:40] we've had our uh account you know hacked
[39:42] many times my goodness probably 10 times
[39:44] maybe more so I gotta check it every day
[39:46] but just like you check your natural
[39:48] we're checking up our spiritual today as
[39:50] well
[39:51] Hallelujah
[39:53] because if we're lacking anything it's
[39:55] because of love we have to love one
[39:57] another that will produce the spiritual
[39:59] riches this will produce a confidence
[40:02] amen a certain confidence Hallelujah and
[40:06] understanding about God oh thank God
[40:09] beautiful
[40:11] now notice this understanding leads to
[40:13] the acknowledgment or the precise and
[40:16] correct knowledge of the mystery of the
[40:18] God isn't this interesting Paul ties in
[40:21] love
[40:22] with spiritual riches confidence
[40:25] and it gives us the understanding of God
[40:28] and the godhead
[40:31] genuine love leads to understanding and
[40:34] knowing god because God is love amen
[40:36] hallelujah
[40:38] he that loveth not noeth not God Amen
[40:41] Hallelujah for God is love amen
[40:43] something like that Sunday school song
[40:45] beloved let us love one another first
[40:48] John 4 7 today
[40:49] all right that old Sunday school song we
[40:51] used to sing well I sing it I don't know
[40:52] about be private sang it here we
[40:53] probably need to sing it here okay so
[40:55] that's a good thought there let's sing
[40:57] that one maybe tonight
[40:58] genuine love leads to knowing god and
[41:02] having God's riches in your life praise
[41:04] God
[41:05] spiritual wealth Hallelujah
[41:08] in church this is all in verses one and
[41:10] two
[41:11] all this is just in the first two verses
[41:13] I haven't even got the verse three yet
[41:16] my goodness
[41:18] is it something like this is I told you
[41:19] this is so concentrated
[41:21] it's like kind of like a orange or like
[41:23] a rag that's wet you know you keep
[41:25] squeezing more and more comes out it's
[41:27] like
[41:27] our rags run up it's like God's word
[41:30] just get keep coming more like oh my
[41:32] goodness I thought I was out of orange
[41:33] juice there's it just keeps coming this
[41:35] thing is so there's so much in there
[41:36] praise God
[41:37] that's how it is
[41:40] and Paul lays it out
[41:42] this is foolishness to the world
[41:45] but to the believer this is spiritual
[41:47] riches hallelujah amen this is eternal
[41:49] life amen
[41:51] foolishness to the world but this is the
[41:53] wisdom of God to the believer Hallelujah
[41:58] now this is when I when I when I went to
[42:00] the funeral two weeks ago I did share
[42:02] with the former pastor and his wife and
[42:04] different members thank you for the
[42:06] degree of love that I felt because they
[42:08] did a good job loving us
[42:10] you know as I said we were poor and
[42:13] sometimes our electric would get shut
[42:14] off right in the middle of winter or
[42:15] Heating
[42:17] and the church would come in sometimes
[42:19] and pay for that sometimes other people
[42:20] donated to our family
[42:22] and then you know uh they my former
[42:25] Pastor would take us out to eat on
[42:26] Sunday it was all all you can eat at
[42:28] Wendy's you know fast food it wasn't
[42:30] healthy at all of course you know but we
[42:32] didn't care we didn't even know about
[42:33] organic food at that time you know all
[42:35] we knew about was our stomachs are
[42:36] growling and we need to eat you know
[42:39] got four or five teenagers and we're
[42:41] hungry you know and
[42:42] and I was talking to him about that
[42:43] thanking him for that
[42:45] and so I told him I you know in my in my
[42:47] mind I thought wow I felt a degree of
[42:49] Love here
[42:52] uh
[42:54] but I just as one example there wasn't a
[42:56] degree of love to go further and tell us
[42:59] the truth about certain things
[43:01] like tongues is not the evidence of the
[43:03] Holy Ghost
[43:05] right and that women ought not to wear
[43:07] makeup
[43:08] and Men ought not to wear it either I'll
[43:10] start preaching out that dude because
[43:12] the way this world's going
[43:13] man and wait a minute I have to change
[43:16] our video to make up men and women in
[43:18] the Bible you know
[43:20] men should not wear makeup
[43:22] but I we could see a degree of love
[43:24] where they took care of our natural
[43:25] needs but really Church it with all the
[43:27] grace of God and love for these people
[43:28] they didn't give us the love of God with
[43:30] the spiritual needs
[43:33] like they didn't say you should get rid
[43:34] of your TV
[43:36] and I'll say it again we should get rid
[43:37] of our TVs we should get rid of our
[43:38] smartphones if it's causing us to
[43:40] stumble
[43:41] if we cannot if we like the Bible said
[43:44] if we aren't snared by these things
[43:45] you've got to get rid of the snare
[43:48] right you've got to get rid of snare
[43:50] I've known two or three grown men uh
[43:53] older than me one's older one younger
[43:54] actually that have gotten rid of their
[43:56] smartphones and gone back to the flip
[43:57] phones
[43:58] I admire that
[44:00] I think that's a great thing to do
[44:02] because like I said I've run into four
[44:03] people that have uh porn problems in the
[44:06] last two three months
[44:08] because of their cell phones
[44:10] and some say it's not just full-blown
[44:12] videos it's just those little gifts or
[44:13] GIFs
[44:14] or just still pictures or whatever it is
[44:17] or Instagram or uh some of them do like
[44:21] uh comments and they just whoever's
[44:24] there I don't know if it's a robot or
[44:25] something but they're texting back and
[44:27] forth with inappropriate conversations
[44:30] sexual conversations see it's
[44:33] it's it's it's a it's more deceptive
[44:37] how many times church I was thinking
[44:38] about this morning how many times have I
[44:39] picked this up to do something good but
[44:40] then I get distracted by something and I
[44:42] forget the good I wanted to do
[44:44] like I want to text Brother Austin or
[44:46] that I forget I'll just pick it up oh
[44:48] there's a notification I I forgot the
[44:49] whole reason I picked it up what did I
[44:51] what did I do this for
[44:53] because then you get to that and then to
[44:54] that app and then that that that this
[44:56] app
[44:57] it's challenging it's the challenge of
[44:59] the hour
[45:00] but I'll tell you if we got the love of
[45:02] God it's going to help us have spiritual
[45:04] riches amen
[45:06] God's love will help us on these issues
[45:08] amen
[45:09] amen and memories I'm gonna preach on
[45:11] this maybe later I want to revisit the
[45:12] fear of the Lord
[45:14] uh the fear of the Lord is the beginning
[45:16] of wisdom the fear of the Lord is to
[45:17] hate evil
[45:20] and in a in a in a wealthy
[45:25] prosperous Nation like United States
[45:27] sometimes we lose the fear of the Lord
[45:29] because we got everything
[45:32] everything
[45:33] We're Not Afraid now think about we're
[45:35] not afraid of food running out because
[45:36] it's always there at the grocery store
[45:38] every time we go there they go now
[45:39] sometimes they're missing our favorite
[45:42] vegetable
[45:45] cilantro
[45:47] sometimes they're missing my favorite
[45:48] kombucha
[45:50] but like we're trained here in America
[45:51] every time we go it's there we got it we
[45:54] got it and we lose the fear of God now
[45:56] God was with Israel if they didn't obey
[45:58] they weren't getting the rain they
[45:59] weren't getting their kombucha
[46:01] you know what I mean they weren't
[46:03] getting their wine they weren't getting
[46:04] their favorite vegetables it was more
[46:06] based on that but we're in a different
[46:08] age we're different people
[46:11] and so we need reminders to fear God and
[46:14] to hate evil praise God and to love
[46:16] righteousness and to love each other
[46:18] amen hallelujah that's why I'm glad amen
[46:20] preached on that Brother season so you
[46:21] better now you're giving me inspiration
[46:22] for weeks in advance here see
[46:27] it's true I mean Love Is The Love is the
[46:30] whole Center of Christian Life it's the
[46:32] whole the whole goal because God is love
[46:36] so see just in these first two verses
[46:37] here after you know Paul goes through
[46:39] the cross and the baptism of the Holy
[46:41] Ghost and the godhead these great
[46:43] Mysteries he brings actually back to the
[46:45] godhead through the love of God
[46:48] if you love each other you'll have an
[46:50] understanding of God
[46:52] I hope you feel this way I believe I
[46:54] know God greater today than I ever have
[46:57] I know that his character
[46:59] I know the things he does I know his
[47:01] patterns and the church said
[47:03] right you that's how it should be
[47:06] but you'd be surprised how many people
[47:08] don't know and they'll say oh God always
[47:10] wants to heal or God always wants to
[47:11] save or God always wants to do this or
[47:13] always God always wants to be prosperous
[47:14] that shows they don't know God very well
[47:17] but you and I have the pleasure of
[47:18] knowing god
[47:20] in truth the Bible says
[47:23] see we know his character
[47:26] like like let me give you an example
[47:27] like when Austin uh we prayed for his
[47:29] grandma his grandma got a good report
[47:30] right
[47:31] well all of a sudden it switched like I
[47:33] was shouting rejoicing I even wrote it
[47:35] on my paper at home as a testimony
[47:37] Austin's grandma was healed praise the
[47:39] Lord within one week she was had a
[47:41] terminal uh sickness and then die within
[47:44] two weeks
[47:46] well think about that that didn't make
[47:47] me upset with God like God you owe me an
[47:49] understanding I was like well God you
[47:51] give and take away
[47:53] and God you gave her a second chance you
[47:56] gave her two extra weeks to live
[47:58] but see without that understanding we
[48:00] could get bitter against God
[48:02] see we in other words we learn to deal
[48:04] with God's different times and seasons
[48:07] we can love God in the good times amen
[48:09] we can love God in the hard times amen
[48:12] but we keep coming back to God because
[48:14] God keeps pouring out his blessings amen
[48:17] he keeps pouring out his word his
[48:19] promises they're certain praise God
[48:21] they're unfailing Promises of God
[48:24] hallelujah
[48:27] amen that's just one example where look
[48:29] we have the character to understand well
[48:30] we thought we got thought God was going
[48:31] to do something but no God is going to
[48:33] change it
[48:35] and God is the author of all of it
[48:37] how many believe God's the author and
[48:39] finisher of your faith
[48:41] that means he's author and finisher of
[48:42] Austin's Grandma's face
[48:44] as long as they're a Believer right as
[48:46] long as they accept faith
[48:48] he's the author and finisher of it and
[48:50] he'll he'll take whatever place they
[48:52] give Jesus
[48:53] if you give Jesus first place he'll be
[48:56] first in your life amen hallelujah he'll
[48:58] take second though
[48:59] like we got a family member in the
[49:01] message for 40 years but they admitted
[49:03] it before they left they admitted Jesus
[49:05] was never number one in their life
[49:07] family was number one they admitted that
[49:09] to me
[49:10] so you can sit in a message to church
[49:12] brother William said in a message to
[49:13] church for over 40 years this family sat
[49:14] there for over 40 years for some raised
[49:16] in it
[49:17] but see the eventually the truth is
[49:18] going to come out eventually we're going
[49:20] to see what fruits your tree's producing
[49:23] may God help us to always put Jesus
[49:26] number one in our lives
[49:28] so we have the real fruit the real
[49:29] riches amen ah there it is the real
[49:32] wealth of Jesus Amen
[49:34] which is love well if I love you I'm
[49:36] going to come see you
[49:38] glory on Sunday on Wednesday
[49:40] sometimes other times during the week if
[49:42] I love you I'm going to come fellowship
[49:44] with you praise God that's why people
[49:45] don't come Fellowship anymore they don't
[49:47] love us
[49:48] but see we love each other we still love
[49:49] them right we pray for them but it's the
[49:52] love of God how can we stay apart our
[49:54] hearts are knit together amen
[49:56] how can I stay apart from you brother
[49:58] bang my heart is knitted with yours amen
[50:01] my heart's a new with the birthday boy
[50:02] today right
[50:03] the birthday girl yesterday
[50:05] our hearts are knit how can we stay away
[50:07] from each other we're just drawn to one
[50:10] another because God has unified our
[50:12] hearts together
[50:14] he's placed them together
[50:16] how could we stay apart
[50:20] that means when the enemy comes in with
[50:21] with doubt or anger or
[50:24] jealousy against a saint of God or
[50:26] something you just you just you
[50:28] extinguish that with the shield of faith
[50:30] you just hold up that shield and that
[50:32] fiery Dart is extinguished distinguished
[50:34] right there extinguished rather
[50:36] not distinguished extinguished
[50:38] you just hold up that she'll say no
[50:40] Satan not today
[50:41] I like those coffee cups not today Satan
[50:44] because not today Satan my heart is
[50:47] going to be knitted to my family in
[50:48] Christ Hallelujah
[50:50] Glory
[50:52] thank God Amen
[50:56] now let's summarize these first two
[50:57] verses now Paul's great fight was to see
[51:00] the believer's heart knit together in
[51:01] love this love then would produce full
[51:03] Assurance riches and understanding of
[51:06] God
[51:07] now the opposite is true as well
[51:10] this Unity produces doubt
[51:13] in someone's walk with God
[51:15] and it also produces idolatry three
[51:18] persons
[51:19] right
[51:21] but see the people that believe in three
[51:22] persons almost always have other Idols
[51:24] in their life because they've already
[51:25] accepted a three-person Idol
[51:28] right so the opposite is true I think
[51:30] it's beautiful Paulie's Paul connects
[51:32] the godhead with your loved one for
[51:34] another
[51:35] if you truly love the family of God
[51:38] he says you'll know God you have
[51:39] spiritual riches and you'll acknowledge
[51:42] the mystery of God you'll acknowledge
[51:44] that godhead God is one person God is
[51:46] love
[51:48] but the opposite is true
[51:51] if people don't really labor to love one
[51:53] another they don't try really with all
[51:56] their hearts to love one another
[51:58] there'll be disunity and they'll doubt
[52:00] their experience with God am I really
[52:02] saved am I really filled with the Holy
[52:04] Ghost
[52:05] really sincere am I really a child of
[52:08] God does God really love me see all this
[52:11] doubt but the more you love amen the
[52:14] more you love each other praise God the
[52:16] more certain it becomes Hallelujah
[52:19] this is all in the first two verses
[52:22] see certainty God wants you to feel
[52:23] certain
[52:25] God doesn't want you to doubt the future
[52:27] God wants you to be certain about the
[52:28] future
[52:29] and the way to get that is through
[52:31] loving the family of God
[52:35] that will produce spiritual wealth
[52:38] and those spiritual wealth the spiritual
[52:39] wealth is is then
[52:41] certain it's absolute certainty about
[52:45] God and about your walk with the Lord
[52:48] praise God
[52:50] I'm almost at an hour I'm at 50 minutes
[52:52] so this is going pretty good I think I'm
[52:53] going pretty good here by God's grace
[52:58] you know I was wondering what to preach
[53:00] and I opened my Bible app on my iPad
[53:02] actually and had a big big picture the
[53:05] book of Colossians read this for the
[53:06] month of November so I thought that's a
[53:08] pretty good sign I should preach that
[53:09] today
[53:11] but you know Church think about the
[53:12] colossian church they would have had
[53:14] this letter of Paul they would have read
[53:15] it service after service the preachers
[53:16] would have read it and then preached on
[53:18] it you know let's go back over this Paul
[53:20] the prophet told us this let's preach a
[53:21] little bit more on this let's preach
[53:22] let's preach about the love of God let's
[53:24] preach about the godhead let's preach
[53:26] about the cross amen
[53:28] see they would take inspiration from the
[53:30] letter the word of God and the spirit
[53:32] would then give them further inspiration
[53:34] to inspire the Saints to more faithful
[53:37] service praise God
[53:39] because that's who Paul was writing to
[53:40] faithful not Unfaithful Paul's writing
[53:43] to the faithful Saints
[53:46] Hallelujah now notice the whom
[53:49] or the one person of the godhead
[53:51] he didn't say in they notice he did he's
[53:54] he didn't say in they
[53:57] I read uh was I want to read today Psalm
[53:59] uh or no Isaiah 42 and God said over
[54:01] again he said there's no other God
[54:03] beside me if there's any other God I
[54:04] don't know him
[54:06] I stretch out the heavens by myself
[54:08] there's no God with me there's no other
[54:10] one I formed Israel I formed you out of
[54:13] my love
[54:14] is oh it's always one person I'm the
[54:16] Holy One of Israel there's no God beside
[54:18] me and Paul says the same thing not in
[54:21] they not in three persons in one person
[54:24] in whom are HID all the treasures of
[54:27] wisdom and knowledge
[54:32] how many people desire the wisdom of God
[54:36] with the wisdom of God you can recognize
[54:38] the mother Harlot revelation 17.
[54:40] that's super important when you
[54:42] recognize her you don't join her you
[54:44] don't partake of her sins
[54:46] right
[54:48] wisdom also governs all the other gifts
[54:51] praise God
[54:53] but wisdom also is called
[54:57] the Bible says the principal thing
[54:59] brother William and I were talking about
[55:00] this on Thanksgiving night
[55:02] it's better that I don't play games
[55:03] because I
[55:05] I don't the worst parts of me come out
[55:07] when I play games
[55:09] I'm too competitive so
[55:11] my wife can tell you all about after
[55:12] service
[55:14] I just really like to win it if I don't
[55:15] win sometimes I get a little bit
[55:18] uh mad
[55:18] [Laughter]
[55:21] the right word
[55:22] so it's better I just talk about the
[55:23] Lord you know I gotta stay away from my
[55:25] flesh the uh weaknesses
[55:29] but it's wisdom we were looking at the
[55:31] Book of Proverbs and the Bible said I
[55:34] wisdom dwell with prudence
[55:36] and I wisdom dwelt with the father
[55:38] before the foundation of the world
[55:40] and I was daily his Delight remember
[55:42] that in Proverbs chapter 8 wisdom was
[55:44] God's daily life so wisdom is pictured
[55:46] as the Holy Spirit the logos
[55:49] before the foundation of the world
[55:51] praise God
[55:53] and Paul says if you love each other he
[55:56] said I've got a great I've been fighting
[55:57] for you that you love each other and you
[56:00] would have be certain of your faith
[56:02] and then he says in God in the godhead
[56:05] are he had all the treasures of wisdom
[56:08] and knowledge
[56:09] wisdom is the principal thing you need
[56:12] on this Earth praise God
[56:15] it's not really finances it's not
[56:17] hitting the lottery of course we
[56:18] wouldn't play the lottery but it's not
[56:20] hitting the lottery that's not the
[56:22] principal thing in this life
[56:24] in America that's what people think
[56:26] but the principal thing is having wisdom
[56:28] about what to do and how to do it when
[56:31] to do it as well
[56:32] wisdom of God is the right decision
[56:35] making they some people call it sound
[56:36] advice
[56:39] but wisdom is what to do and how to do
[56:42] it
[56:44] now I think I think it's again let's
[56:46] just take this thought as we close here
[56:48] I'll try to close here I got uh six
[56:49] minutes till my hour here
[56:50] hard to believe that
[56:52] uh but the Bible said all the wisdom is
[56:55] hid in the godhead
[56:59] it's hidden there
[57:02] so see we see notice this means
[57:05] trinitarians lack Treasures of wisdom
[57:07] and knowledge
[57:08] we also know that they lack love too
[57:11] right because they're not born again
[57:12] they don't have the baptism Holy Ghost
[57:13] their hearts aren't knitted together in
[57:15] love
[57:17] right like I've seen different uh
[57:19] denominational people if the pastor says
[57:21] one thing they don't like they leave
[57:22] that denomination go to the other
[57:23] denomination
[57:25] that happened at our church when I was
[57:26] being when I was raised you see it all
[57:28] you see in the message you see the
[57:30] message they say one thing against your
[57:32] pet doctor one thing contrary to what
[57:34] you think they're out
[57:36] that's a denominational Spirit where's
[57:38] the love of God and all that
[57:40] now of course there are reasons to leave
[57:42] churches no doubt about that I've
[57:43] preached those fully I think uh the
[57:45] doctrines of devils those are reasons to
[57:47] leave churches no doubt about that
[57:49] because it's 11.
[57:51] but just noticed I would want you to be
[57:53] encouraged and be happy today about the
[57:55] love of God that we have amen
[57:57] because trinitarians have the wrong
[58:00] understanding of God therefore and that
[58:02] they're lacking the love of God they're
[58:04] not certain of where they stand they're
[58:06] not sure of the raptures before the
[58:07] tribulation during after they don't even
[58:10] know if there is a Rapture they might
[58:12] think the Rapture already happened they
[58:14] might think we're already living and
[58:15] then there's no Millennium there's none
[58:16] of that you know Catholic Church doesn't
[58:17] believe in the Millennium they're living
[58:19] in their Millennium this is their
[58:20] Satan's Millennium so brother Adam said
[58:22] they're living in Satan's Millennium
[58:23] right now
[58:24] but see it's because they don't have the
[58:27] love of God they have it I'll say like
[58:29] this they haven't searched for it like
[58:32] they ought to have praise God
[58:34] amen
[58:37] didn't the Bible say in Jeremiah 29 he
[58:40] said when you search for me with all
[58:42] your heart you'll find me
[58:45] how many believe that
[58:49] so we've got to search the treasures of
[58:51] God our head deep deep in the ground
[58:55] the treasures of God are not always
[58:57] obvious and apparent they're not just
[59:00] laying out on the surface level of Our
[59:02] Lives
[59:04] we're not really going to find the
[59:05] treasures of God while we're shopping at
[59:06] Lowe's like I was doing a couple times
[59:08] this weekend
[59:09] now God could speak to you there no
[59:11] doubt
[59:13] but the illustration Paul gives is the
[59:16] the treasures of God are hidden and we
[59:18] have to go look for them and find them
[59:20] and as long as we're in the love of God
[59:22] we're gonna find them and though it's
[59:24] certain that we'll we we know our
[59:26] destination we know where we're going we
[59:28] know the word of God we know the
[59:30] destination we know of the future it's
[59:33] certain if we keep the love of God we'll
[59:35] be able to find all the hidden wisdom of
[59:37] God and it's in Christ the word
[59:40] Hallelujah
[59:43] treasure amen
[59:45] all wisdom all knowledge praise God go
[59:48] to Proverbs here uh chapter 3 I believe
[59:49] it is this is just coming off my memory
[59:51] here as I'm trying to close
[1:00:02] I'm sorry chapter two Proverbs two I was
[1:00:03] one chapter away forgive me
[1:00:07] now look at verse one Proverbs two verse
[1:00:09] 1. now here's my instruction to maokai
[1:00:11] and uh Zion so lucky lucky for them
[1:00:14] they're my sons
[1:00:15] but you know Solomon wrote this letter
[1:00:18] for his sons
[1:00:21] how many times I preached this when
[1:00:22] William first came I preached this whole
[1:00:24] book of proverbs hit the highlights of
[1:00:26] it
[1:00:27] he wrote this for his sons
[1:00:30] my son Malachi thou will receive my
[1:00:32] words and hide my Commandments with thee
[1:00:35] where's Heinz he's sleeping yeah
[1:00:37] he gets a pass today
[1:00:39] so that thou incline thine heart unto
[1:00:42] wisdom see you have to Humble your heart
[1:00:43] if you want the wisdom of God
[1:00:45] it's not found by pridefully living your
[1:00:47] life however you want you must find it
[1:00:49] by humility
[1:00:51] and apply thine heart to understanding
[1:00:54] that means you got to work with
[1:00:55] understand you got to apply yourself in
[1:00:56] it you got to spend time
[1:00:58] you've got to devote time to finding the
[1:01:01] understanding of God
[1:01:05] and notice isn't this something this the
[1:01:08] wisest man there ever was is telling his
[1:01:10] son spend time with God
[1:01:14] he built all I mean he built the temple
[1:01:16] I'm going to preach on that eventually
[1:01:17] seven years ago the temple the most
[1:01:19] beautiful building the world ever had
[1:01:21] ever has ever seen
[1:01:23] until the New Jerusalem praise God
[1:01:26] but he had done all these natural things
[1:01:28] but he tells his son stay in the word of
[1:01:30] God
[1:01:32] Search the word of God
[1:01:34] humble your heart and and find some of
[1:01:37] these treasures and the church said
[1:01:41] what treasure are you going after
[1:01:43] what treasure are you and I seeking
[1:01:47] the father tells his son the wisest
[1:01:49] father there ever was until he got
[1:01:50] backslidden
[1:01:52] the wisest father ever was says son
[1:01:55] apply your heart verse three yea If thy
[1:01:57] if thou Christ after knowledge what
[1:02:02] God expects you to cry out
[1:02:04] yes
[1:02:07] now a lot of you raise your hands a few
[1:02:09] moments ago and I said who wants who
[1:02:11] wants wisdom how do you raise your hands
[1:02:12] and I said how many willing to cry for
[1:02:14] it
[1:02:16] now that's a different story
[1:02:18] that's why I usually cry at church
[1:02:20] cry in your car cry at your house
[1:02:24] cry after it
[1:02:25] see the the treasures are hidden in God
[1:02:28] but you got to cry out to God God wants
[1:02:31] to know that you really want to praise
[1:02:32] God
[1:02:34] it's a free gift but in order to
[1:02:36] appreciate a gift you sometimes got to
[1:02:38] pay the price for the gift amen you got
[1:02:40] to appreciate it
[1:02:42] you can't be selfish right you can't be
[1:02:44] loose with it you got to appreciate it
[1:02:46] praise God
[1:02:49] if you cry after knowledge and lift up
[1:02:51] thy voice for understanding look it even
[1:02:53] says sometimes in prayer you've got to
[1:02:54] raise your voice in prayer
[1:02:56] or it could be in a song Church how many
[1:02:58] songs talk about
[1:03:00] oh the Lord is my shepherd you know
[1:03:02] that's a song cry out to God I have all
[1:03:05] I want the Lord's my shepherd I shall
[1:03:07] not lack
[1:03:08] that's how we should sing it maybe we'll
[1:03:10] sing it afterwards brother
[1:03:12] that should be I wish we should sing it
[1:03:13] Lord I don't want to lack wisdom pour
[1:03:15] out your wisdom give me understanding
[1:03:17] praise God
[1:03:19] the wisest man ever tells his sons you
[1:03:21] got to lift your voice up when you pray
[1:03:24] so let me tell Malakai publicly you got
[1:03:26] to pray louder buddy now do I have
[1:03:28] scripture to back that up yes
[1:03:30] do I wish my dad would have told me that
[1:03:32] yes actually he did when I got older but
[1:03:34] he said I'd go in the closet and pray so
[1:03:36] I appreciate my dad for telling me that
[1:03:38] but the wisest man Solomon told his son
[1:03:40] you have to apply your heart to it
[1:03:42] you got to lift up your voice for
[1:03:45] it ain't gonna come easy all the time
[1:03:48] that's the Manna every day that was
[1:03:50] sanctification
[1:03:52] that was just given to him like a they
[1:03:54] were babies right
[1:03:56] but when they become mature they got to
[1:03:58] go work for it
[1:04:03] I think it's beautiful language Paul
[1:04:04] uses here all the treasures of God are
[1:04:07] hidden in Christ Jesus
[1:04:10] verse four here's where we're going if
[1:04:11] thou seek is her as silver and searches
[1:04:13] for her as for hid Treasures
[1:04:16] head there's that word hand ever see the
[1:04:17] word head what in whom are HID all hid
[1:04:22] they're hidden the scriptures
[1:04:24] they're hid in those quiet times with
[1:04:26] God
[1:04:28] Hallelujah
[1:04:29] I'll share our good testimony you know
[1:04:31] this summer I I said something you know
[1:04:33] uh to one of the Saints I'll just say
[1:04:36] Austin he's probably watching you I said
[1:04:37] something to Austin and it
[1:04:39] I kind of took him off guard and I
[1:04:41] appreciated one thing about him he went
[1:04:43] he was at work he went in the in the
[1:04:45] bathroom and prayed unto God until he
[1:04:46] got
[1:04:47] the answer
[1:04:49] I thought that was a good
[1:04:51] he had to go hide away and find the
[1:04:52] answer
[1:04:53] was what brother Jesse was saying was it
[1:04:55] the truth or not
[1:04:57] and so I want to appreciate that about
[1:04:58] our brother
[1:05:00] he had to go pray and the Holy Spirit
[1:05:02] revealed to him that's right
[1:05:04] it wasn't easy to hear was it
[1:05:06] you know it wasn't maybe fun to hear
[1:05:10] but there's truth sometimes that we say
[1:05:12] right there's truth God's speaking
[1:05:14] through us and church it's a good thing
[1:05:16] if we go pray about it like that's what
[1:05:18] the devil doesn't want us to do go pray
[1:05:20] about something right go pray about your
[1:05:21] knee go pray about the question in your
[1:05:23] life
[1:05:24] I just wants you to quickly make a hasty
[1:05:25] decision
[1:05:27] but God's not always in Hasty God's in
[1:05:29] in waiting on the Lord amen renewing
[1:05:32] strength praise God confidence God is in
[1:05:34] God wants you to have confidence about
[1:05:36] your salvation praise God
[1:05:38] he wants you confident about the
[1:05:40] decisions of your life
[1:05:43] so if you seek as for hid Treasures then
[1:05:47] Thou shalt understand the fear of the
[1:05:48] Lord
[1:05:49] and find the knowledge of God
[1:05:53] for the lord giveth wisdom out of his
[1:05:55] mouth cometh knowledge
[1:05:57] and understanding so look let's listen
[1:06:00] church can you catch us sometimes you're
[1:06:02] not going to hear God's voice unless you
[1:06:03] lift up your voice
[1:06:06] if we're quiet all the time which I
[1:06:08] don't I'm not saying nothing there's
[1:06:09] nothing against quiet but you still know
[1:06:11] that I'm God right I mean there's time
[1:06:13] for quiet
[1:06:15] but if we don't make sometimes an effort
[1:06:17] to lift our voice and pray we're not
[1:06:18] going to hear the voice of God
[1:06:22] in other words we've got to pray until
[1:06:25] we gotta call out to God until God gives
[1:06:28] it why doesn't this happen God why why
[1:06:30] what about this why do they do that what
[1:06:32] why is this happening keep calling out
[1:06:34] to God and the Bible said if you lift
[1:06:36] your voice give me wisdom help me to
[1:06:37] understand this how should I act in this
[1:06:39] situation the Bible said if you cry out
[1:06:40] to God you'll hear the voice of God
[1:06:42] speak back
[1:06:45] and that's where you find all your
[1:06:47] Treasures
[1:06:48] I already passed my hour so
[1:06:50] sorry about that
[1:06:52] I'll end with verse three this is my
[1:06:54] last one here last
[1:06:55] last I could have went to some other
[1:06:57] ones you know some of the other verses
[1:06:58] church are like second Corinthians the
[1:07:00] Bible said we have Treasures in Earthen
[1:07:02] vessel
[1:07:02] but hey man it's your birthday buddy
[1:07:04] this is the Earthen vessel this this
[1:07:06] body God give you but the Treasures of
[1:07:08] the Holy Spirit are inside this Earthen
[1:07:10] vessel
[1:07:11] I see it every time I see you buddy I
[1:07:13] see the treasures of God the love of God
[1:07:15] the Devotion to God the joy to sing to
[1:07:17] God that's a treasure a lot of people
[1:07:18] don't have that most people don't
[1:07:20] because most people are lost few therapy
[1:07:22] that find the narrow road that's right
[1:07:23] we see these church we got to make sure
[1:07:25] don't become common to us that we see
[1:07:27] the treasures of God in our lives
[1:07:30] we have The Treasure of God in Earthen
[1:07:33] vessels
[1:07:37] and so by God's grace we have wisdom
[1:07:39] today we have wisdom for the gifts of
[1:07:40] the Spirit right we don't have the wrong
[1:07:41] evidence of the spirit we don't always
[1:07:43] believe God's always going to heal every
[1:07:45] time
[1:07:46] see we have wisdom to understand these
[1:07:47] things
[1:07:48] the will of God must be sought
[1:07:50] we have wisdom for our daily living
[1:07:53] right it wouldn't be wise for me to do
[1:07:55] this because then this is going to
[1:07:56] happen or this will that that wouldn't
[1:07:58] be wise for you to make that decision
[1:08:01] marriages would it would be wise to
[1:08:02] marry this one and not that one
[1:08:05] RB wise to be in this relationship but
[1:08:08] not with that friend
[1:08:10] wisdom
[1:08:12] but all these answers are HID in Jesus
[1:08:15] Christ
[1:08:17] and you have to take some time searching
[1:08:19] it out
[1:08:20] take some time lifting up your voice
[1:08:25] Church attendance finances jobs your
[1:08:28] words have us Lord what should I say
[1:08:31] how can I how can I get in a good habit
[1:08:32] of
[1:08:33] doing you know serving the lord how can
[1:08:35] I get a good good Ministry how can I how
[1:08:36] can I do that how can I handle my
[1:08:38] finances
[1:08:40] the wisdom of God will give you the
[1:08:42] right leading
[1:08:44] but all of that wisdom is hid in the
[1:08:46] Eternal one
[1:08:47] and it takes someone who will seek God
[1:08:50] my son
[1:08:52] you must apply your heart to wisdom
[1:08:55] and I'll just say like this my friends
[1:08:58] my congregation
[1:09:00] I'm your pastor you're my congregation
[1:09:03] apply let's apply our hearts to wisdom
[1:09:07] let us lift up our voices for wisdom
[1:09:10] let us seek for wisdom the Bible said as
[1:09:13] you'd seek treasure
[1:09:16] how does it start it starts with loving
[1:09:17] each other
[1:09:19] then you get the the wealth right
[1:09:22] and then you move here to this verse
[1:09:24] here then you understand God and then in
[1:09:27] God are all the treasures of wisdom and
[1:09:29] knowledge that you could possibly desire
[1:09:31] how many grateful for all those wisdom
[1:09:32] all the treasure and knowledge of god
[1:09:34] let's stand to our feet musicians can
[1:09:36] come
[1:09:40] any treasure you seek today
[1:09:43] any treasure you desire today it's
[1:09:45] hidden in Jesus Christ
[1:09:51] and church let's be willing to go deeper
[1:09:54] in our walk with the Lord that's a good
[1:09:56] message for communion I didn't I really
[1:09:57] didn't know I was going to turn out
[1:10:00] it's a good message for communion
[1:10:05] everybody enjoy the word of God today
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:09] my son my church if thou will receive my
[1:10:13] words from the Bible and hide God's
[1:10:15] Commandments with thee
[1:10:17] if you'll incline your heart unto wisdom
[1:10:19] and apply your heart to understanding if
[1:10:21] you cry after knowledge if you lift up
[1:10:23] your voice for understanding if you seek
[1:10:25] wisdom as for silver and search for her
[1:10:27] as for hid Treasures then Thou shalt
[1:10:29] understand the fear of the Lord
[1:10:32] Hallelujah
[1:10:35] what a beautiful scripture and find the
[1:10:37] knowledge of God for the lord giveth
[1:10:38] wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge
[1:10:41] and understanding
[1:10:43] let's bow our heads Here For a Moment by
[1:10:44] God's grace
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:56] you know as a pastor I've been so
[1:10:57] thankful you know
[1:10:59] we've got so many people come to our
[1:11:00] church they say they feel the love of
[1:11:02] God they love the worship they love the
[1:11:04] preaching the singing
[1:11:07] and I believe God has knit our hearts
[1:11:10] together
[1:11:12] but of course we know the enemy is going
[1:11:15] to try to battle us in our minds
[1:11:18] well the ram said Satan won't let you
[1:11:20] stay that loving group of church he said
[1:11:22] he'll either anoint somebody in the
[1:11:24] church or send somebody in
[1:11:26] seen that over the years
[1:11:28] I believe this sermon especially with
[1:11:30] these scriptures from Colossians
[1:11:32] Proverbs are great reminders that we
[1:11:35] continue to love one another
[1:11:37] and for every question in our life

[1:11:41] answers
