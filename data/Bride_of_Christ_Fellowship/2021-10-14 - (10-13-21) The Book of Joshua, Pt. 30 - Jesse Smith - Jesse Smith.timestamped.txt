[5:56] on sunday should you tarry in jesus
[5:58] christ's name and the saint said
[6:00] amen god bless you as you're being
[6:01] seated praise god
[6:06] you can switch over here to my uh
[6:09] ipad i want to share some quotes and
[6:10] everything by the grace of the lord
[6:14] so uh
[6:16] i just want to again start with this
[6:17] here briefly by the grace of god
[6:20] oh each of us have a spiritual land
[6:22] we're supposed to possess not brazil
[6:24] this is brazil's map but you're not
[6:26] supposed to go take over brazil i just
[6:28] use the map okay but you need to possess
[6:30] your relationships for the kingdom of
[6:32] god hallelujah
[6:34] your ministries whatever ministries
[6:36] you've been called to
[6:38] uh your vocation your job your gifts of
[6:40] the holy spirit and the location you're
[6:42] to live in each one of these areas is
[6:45] gonna have to be a battle and you're
[6:46] gonna have to fight it by the word of
[6:48] god okay so let me just give an example
[6:50] go to ephesians since we're already in
[6:51] there go to ephesians chapter five
[6:54] so this would be for relationships with
[6:55] the married people uh single people
[6:58] should read this and then
[7:00] pray god help me to have this character
[7:02] uh when it comes time for me to be
[7:03] married praise god and our young people
[7:06] should be thinking about that too and i
[7:07] mean i have the love of jesus christ
[7:09] because i think it goes fast
[7:11] it goes real fast
[7:13] so uh look at uh verse 22 wives submit
[7:17] unto your own husbands as unto the lord
[7:20] so for a sister then she's got to
[7:22] possess that she has to submit to her
[7:24] own husband not somebody else's husband
[7:27] right but her own husband as long as
[7:29] it's an obedient uh request right as
[7:31] long as it's a godly request
[7:33] right
[7:34] now of course you should submit to the
[7:35] preaching as well as long as it's in the
[7:37] word of god
[7:39] right but she's supposed to love and
[7:41] respect her husband first she's got to
[7:42] possess that now i'm sure we all know a
[7:44] lot of women that don't respect their
[7:45] husbands
[7:46] because they're not christians or
[7:47] they're they're not born again right
[7:49] right so see they have not possessed
[7:51] that land
[7:52] right they haven't possessed it
[7:55] okay but they have to but they can
[7:57] because remember we just read all
[7:58] spiritual blessings are yours
[8:00] right so we know god will help you do it
[8:02] if you want to do it amen but you just
[8:05] gotta want to praise god right now let's
[8:07] get to those men let's not forget about
[8:08] those men
[8:10] right uh uh go down to verse 25 husbands
[8:14] love your wives as christ also loved the
[8:17] church
[8:18] and gave himself for it
[8:20] so we need men that will of course they
[8:23] got to provide and you know the bible
[8:24] said the woman guides the house and
[8:26] everything and we know you know
[8:27] sometimes women can have jobs outside
[8:28] the home if there's a there's a need for
[8:30] that but in the most case the man has to
[8:33] he has to provide but then when he gets
[8:34] home he's got to love his wife like
[8:36] christ loved the church
[8:38] in other words support his wife
[8:41] a husband's job is not all about himself
[8:44] it's about providing for the kids and
[8:45] then loving his wife
[8:47] notice it sometimes it's hard for men to
[8:49] love but men can learn to love
[8:51] because you can possess your land
[8:53] brothers well i think i'm just women are
[8:56] the only married men here tonight you
[8:58] know i'm sure there's some listening
[8:59] over the you in the live stream right or
[9:01] we'll listen later on
[9:02] but we need men that will love and we
[9:04] need wives that we'll submit
[9:07] but we need a godly man who's not going
[9:08] to ask his wife to do something that's
[9:10] outside the word that's what we need
[9:12] praise god and we need wives that if
[9:14] their husband asks them to do something
[9:15] they'll say yes honey i'll do it by
[9:17] god's grace
[9:18] right and not argue not fuss we need a
[9:21] man a husband that won't argue and fuss
[9:23] either
[9:24] right so we need we need holy
[9:27] ghost-filled saints that are gonna
[9:28] possess these promises praise god like i
[9:31] told the brothers that uh i preached six
[9:34] marriage banquets right i preached six
[9:35] so i always tell them the brothers i
[9:37] said
[9:39] i said when you get home that's your
[9:40] time to serve your wife and kids it's
[9:42] not your time to go play your games or
[9:44] do whatever you want to do you need to
[9:46] get home and love and try to make life a
[9:48] little easier for your wife
[9:50] praise god
[9:52] and then the preachers will get up the
[9:53] pastors go back to her and say brothers
[9:54] we got a lot of work to do don't we
[9:56] but that's true he has to love her
[10:00] his wife like
[10:01] christ love how did christ love the
[10:03] church he gave himself amen every
[10:06] everything he could do he did it for
[10:08] praise god amen
[10:09] anyway he could help the bride he helped
[10:12] his bride his people his church and so
[10:14] the husband should be the same way any
[10:15] way a husband can help his wife he ought
[10:17] to be able to do it
[10:19] praise god now i know there's a balance
[10:21] church i understand that
[10:22] uh but that's the anointing of the holy
[10:25] ghost if you're ever going to be a holy
[10:27] ghost-filled husband
[10:29] right praise god or a holy ghost-filled
[10:31] wife amen she's got to learn to submit
[10:34] because the bible said in verse 23 the
[10:36] husband is has the wife even as christ
[10:39] is the head of the church
[10:41] and he's the savior of the body
[10:43] therefore as the church is subject in
[10:44] the christ so let the wise be to their
[10:46] own husbands in everything that's a
[10:49] tough spill
[10:50] that's a tough pill to swallow right
[10:53] but sisters have to submit to everything
[10:54] that's godly
[10:56] right
[10:57] so whatever the husband would ask you to
[10:59] do the wife's got to do it but the man
[11:01] equally has to love like christ loved
[11:04] amen he's got to be such a selfless
[11:06] person where he's not worried about
[11:08] himself so much he's worried about his
[11:09] wife and the children praise god
[11:12] and be able to see how can i serve my
[11:14] family when i get home not how can i
[11:16] serve myself and watch monday night
[11:18] football
[11:19] because that that is serving yourself
[11:21] right that's a vain that's a vain thing
[11:23] there's going to be no reward in heaven
[11:25] how many super bowl trophies they win
[11:28] in fact that take them to hell right
[11:30] because we found the last year the super
[11:31] the super bowl win quarterback last year
[11:34] admitted his wife was a witch last year
[11:36] did you see that
[11:38] he admitted he said but my wife's a good
[11:40] witch there's no such thing all witches
[11:42] are abominable and they'll be destroyed
[11:45] in the lake of fire if they don't repent
[11:48] see how
[11:49] see how they're so deceived they think
[11:51] well winning uh these things uh are have
[11:53] some have some eternal impact well not
[11:56] godly but could have an eternal impact
[11:58] of going to hell
[11:59] right eternal judgment not eternal
[12:01] punishment eternal judgment
[12:04] god will not punish someone unending
[12:06] eternally for only 20 or 50 or 70 years
[12:09] of disobedience he will not do that he's
[12:11] too merciful he won't he won't punish
[12:13] them that long but the judgment will
[12:15] last for all eternity
[12:17] in other words at some point that person
[12:19] will cease to exist and thank god at
[12:22] some point satan will cease to exist
[12:24] amen hallelujah praise god amen there
[12:27] come a time where he can't tempt you
[12:29] anymore amen
[12:30] he can't make you fall anymore he can't
[12:32] trick you or deceive you there will be a
[12:34] time that jesus throws him in the lake
[12:36] of fire bye bye devil amen hallelujah
[12:39] looking forward to that time praise god
[12:41] christ will do it by the word of his
[12:43] mouth
[12:45] so that's just one example and then
[12:47] remember it's also
[12:48] uh marrying one person
[12:51] right a holy gospel person will marry
[12:53] one person right now if they if their
[12:56] spouse dies yes they can marry again
[12:58] but adulterers uh the bible tells that
[13:02] plainly adulterers were now inherit the
[13:04] kingdom of god
[13:05] now can they be forgiven yes they can be
[13:07] forgiven
[13:08] but someone can't say well i just want a
[13:10] new wife so i'll divorce my wife and
[13:12] i'll marry a younger one
[13:14] you cannot be a holy ghost-filled
[13:16] christian and possess that land you're
[13:18] not in the land if you do that
[13:20] you're still in egypt praise god right
[13:23] you're so you're still in the world
[13:24] because then they'll marry two three
[13:26] times four times like like like we said
[13:28] with billy graham's daughter being
[13:29] married four times
[13:31] and thinking it's okay
[13:33] it's not okay you can't be in that land
[13:35] unless you're obeying the law of that
[13:37] land amen hallelujah the word of god
[13:40] hallelujah because the holy ghost will
[13:42] not guide you outside the bible it'll
[13:44] guide your life to obey with the bible
[13:46] to live the bible
[13:49] amen
[13:50] and then ministries now this this is
[13:52] what it is prayer fasting and alms
[13:55] are ministries will guide you to some
[13:57] type of ministry so think about that
[13:59] there's some people that can just pray
[14:01] more than others and they get better
[14:02] results
[14:03] that's the ministry and then there's
[14:05] some people that can fast and when they
[14:06] fast mind many times god will hear that
[14:08] prayer
[14:09] that's their ministry
[14:11] yours might not be so much in that or
[14:13] almsgiving there's some people they just
[14:14] give in secret they just give and they
[14:16] don't really care to store up all their
[14:18] treasures on earth they want to storm
[14:19] treasures in heaven amen
[14:21] and they're just really gifted at giving
[14:23] there's some people that make clothes
[14:24] like tabitha remember peter raised her
[14:26] from the dead by the power of the holy
[14:27] ghost
[14:28] her testimony after she died was look at
[14:30] these clothes she makes for all the poor
[14:32] people that was her holy ghost ministry
[14:34] was clothing the poor but then jesus
[14:36] raised her up amen i think jesus thinks
[14:39] a lot of a person that wants to clothe
[14:41] those people that don't have clothes
[14:43] he thinks so much of her he raised her
[14:45] from the dead amen
[14:47] that's beautiful and then your gifts the
[14:49] gifts of the holy ghost you're able to
[14:51] keep those in obedience to the word of
[14:53] god
[14:55] okay such as wisdom and knowledge and
[14:58] miracles uh and speaking in tongues and
[15:00] interpretation and prophecy and
[15:02] discernment of spirit and all the gifts
[15:04] of the holy spirit you're able to keep
[15:06] those in line praise god
[15:08] now i believe that's what happened
[15:09] church
[15:10] on saturday night my my brother was sick
[15:12] with coven i felt led of the holy ghost
[15:14] after service i said brother amen i
[15:16] forgot to pray for him i said brother
[15:17] amen come in here anoint me with oil i'm
[15:19] standing in the gap for my family
[15:21] praise god and i think i missed a couple
[15:23] meals that day and i was just trying to
[15:25] focus on the word of the lord and then
[15:26] the next day i get i'm sorry two days
[15:28] later i get the news that they were
[15:30] healed on sunday morning by god's grace
[15:33] so that's that's healing right that's a
[15:34] gift of healing
[15:36] because i just felt led to do that i
[15:37] just forgot about it let felt let it do
[15:39] it we talked about different people we
[15:40] prayed for them to heal the glaucoma and
[15:42] the ankle infection and all these things
[15:44] like that that's just this year and so
[15:46] we're thankful that when we pray god
[15:48] answers amen
[15:50] but we've got to be able to take our
[15:52] gifts back to the word of god we can
[15:53] possess all things everybody say all
[15:55] ready
[15:56] we can possess all things all spiritual
[15:59] blessings in christ jesus let me go back
[16:01] to that
[16:02] you're blessed with all spiritual
[16:04] blessings as you sit in heavenly places
[16:08] okay now i want to get to some quotes i
[16:09] didn't get to these quotes earlier so i
[16:11] want to get to them i meant to preach
[16:12] them about two weeks ago so brother
[16:14] barron says when you are born again
[16:16] which is the bible preaching when you're
[16:17] born again you eat mature foods so go to
[16:19] hebrews 5.
[16:21] i i guess i could pull it up here um
[16:24] yeah if i got my bible app here is that
[16:25] too small
[16:26] yeah i kind of saw anyways go to hebrews
[16:28] chapter five
[16:30] when you are born again you can handle
[16:32] really
[16:33] deep
[16:34] uh lessons the word of god
[16:37] look at verse 12 13-14
[16:40] for when for the time you ought to be
[16:42] teachers you have need that one teach
[16:44] you again the first principles of the
[16:45] oracles of god and are become as such
[16:48] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[16:51] so there's some people that are in here
[16:52] today and they're just drinking milk all
[16:54] they can drink is the milk that i preach
[16:56] which is fine if that's where they are
[16:58] but it's not fine if you should be able
[17:00] to handle greater things
[17:03] right if you've been around longer and
[17:06] you know some of these things uh like
[17:07] the bible says there comes a time when
[17:09] you get a god you've got to get off milk
[17:11] and you've got to take some meat praise
[17:13] god
[17:14] he says for everyone that uses milk is
[17:16] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[17:18] for he's a babe
[17:21] okay so using the in chapter six chapter
[17:24] six goes over uh the the kind of baby
[17:27] principles which they're important they
[17:29] are very important but if you just stay
[17:30] on those a long time you won't grow to
[17:33] maturity
[17:35] now finishing this now look at 14 14 is
[17:37] where that if you want to be a mature
[17:39] christian look right here but strong
[17:41] meat belonging to them that are of full
[17:42] age even those who by reason of use have
[17:46] their senses exercised to discern both
[17:49] good and evil so paul says the
[17:52] meat-eating christian amen the eagle
[17:56] meat-eating christian praise god
[17:58] his life or her life is spent many of
[18:02] the time deciding is this evil for me or
[18:05] is this good for me
[18:07] now look that's not legalism
[18:09] it's wisdom amen
[18:11] and actually the word is discernment the
[18:14] word discern means a judge you have a
[18:16] judging spirit judging this will be evil
[18:19] for me but this will be good for me
[18:22] that's a mature christian not just all i
[18:24] can do i can act like everybody else
[18:26] everybody else in the church can do that
[18:27] i'm sure i can do it too well you want
[18:29] to be you want to be more spiritual
[18:30] praise god
[18:32] not critical and not prideful and not
[18:34] legalistic but when you're eating on the
[18:36] meat of god's word you take in the word
[18:39] and you say holy spirit am i pleasing
[18:41] you in this area or am i not i want to
[18:44] be able to discern good and evil i want
[18:46] to do what's right i want a feast on the
[18:48] meat of god's word
[18:54] that's why like with that statement
[18:56] about the super bowl uh that that's milk
[18:59] that's milk right you should be able to
[19:01] discern if they have half naked women
[19:02] dancing at halftime
[19:04] and they have cussing going on and they
[19:06] have their filthy commercials i mean
[19:07] that's milk you shouldn't watch that
[19:09] that's baby stuff right
[19:12] but then what can you watch now we're
[19:14] getting to some meat now
[19:16] now we're getting to some meat praise
[19:18] god
[19:19] because there are there are some things
[19:21] that don't hinder you right you but then
[19:23] you got to be careful because there
[19:24] could be commercials there could be cuss
[19:26] words there could be some type of
[19:29] contrary spirit
[19:31] right so that's what a mature christian
[19:33] is interested in he's interested in
[19:35] eating the meat of the word not just the
[19:38] milk but church let me let me say uh i'm
[19:40] thankful for milk how many like milk i
[19:42] know where's victoria she ought to be
[19:43] raising her hand
[19:45] most days she'll walk up and say daddy
[19:47] can i whisper in here i'm like wha what
[19:49] do you need
[19:50] you got me some milk
[19:52] yeah i'll get it
[19:55] cause i'm tired you know
[19:57] i gotta serve her better hey man
[19:58] victoria i'm gonna serve you better
[20:00] sometimes there's a good time when i get
[20:01] home there it is a husband wants to love
[20:03] his wife and children help me lord to do
[20:04] better praise god but church milk is
[20:07] good i like milk every now and then
[20:10] nice drink of milk
[20:11] so what is milk milk is repenting from
[20:15] dead works
[20:16] you need to repent and get baptized
[20:18] right faith toward god you need to
[20:20] believe god
[20:21] that's a milk doctrine
[20:23] right but it's good we need that right
[20:24] we need reminders of that
[20:26] baptisms you need a water baptism and a
[20:28] holy ghost baptism
[20:31] just knowing that those milk just
[20:33] knowing that
[20:34] laying on of hands if you're sick the
[20:36] bible said lay hands on the sick they
[20:37] shall recover
[20:39] that's great that's it
[20:40] that's what happened this weekend amen
[20:42] uh resurrection from the dead the saints
[20:45] are gonna write resurrect praise god
[20:46] there's two resurrections
[20:48] right the rapture is the first
[20:50] resurrection and the resurrection to the
[20:52] great white throne judgment is the
[20:53] second resurrection that's milk though
[20:57] and then eternal judgment
[20:59] those that are lost are going to be
[21:01] judged eternally they're going to be
[21:02] eventually annihilated and forgotten
[21:04] that judgment will last for all eternity
[21:06] that's milk but how many appreciate the
[21:08] milk
[21:10] that milk helps prepare me for the meat
[21:12] that's right praise god amen i gotta
[21:15] have that milk to build me up so later i
[21:18] can receive the meat praise god
[21:20] amen
[21:22] now later this chapter goes into some
[21:24] real meat right here
[21:26] the bible says in verse four you can
[21:28] partake listen you can partake of the
[21:30] holy ghost
[21:31] and the good word of taste the good word
[21:33] of god and then fall away
[21:36] and crucify the son of god afresh now
[21:39] that's a meat church
[21:41] hallelujah
[21:43] we just went through all the milk oh i
[21:45] love these things are the baptisms and
[21:47] repentance and salvation but now we get
[21:49] down to some meat
[21:51] there's some people that taste of that
[21:53] and they backslide and they crucify
[21:55] jesus afresh
[21:58] or they put him to an open shame so they
[22:01] go out in public and they live a sinful
[22:03] life now they've just partaken of it
[22:06] they've drank the meat i'm sorry they
[22:08] drank the milk but now they're
[22:09] crucifying the very one who gave him the
[22:11] milk praise god
[22:13] that's the meat right there
[22:15] if you can receive that
[22:18] but beloved brother william but beloved
[22:20] i'm persuaded better things of you
[22:23] i know you are persuaded better things
[22:25] than me too right
[22:26] i'm persuaded we're not that kind praise
[22:28] god
[22:29] we're there's better things for you and
[22:32] i things that accompany salvation
[22:35] we're not crucifying the son of god
[22:37] today we're crucifying the five gates of
[22:40] our our flesh praise god we're
[22:42] crucifying the five inlets to the mind
[22:45] praise god that's what we're crucified
[22:47] and we're exalting jesus christ amen in
[22:50] other words i'm the one being crucified
[22:52] not the word the word is living amen
[22:56] i'm crucifying my will my desires my
[22:58] sinful temptations are the sinful uh the
[23:01] sinful things pulling on me i'm
[23:03] crucifying those effects and i'm
[23:05] choosing to obey the word of god that's
[23:07] the meat of god amen
[23:10] hallelujah
[23:12] so don't let anybody fool your church
[23:15] these are uh
[23:16] these are mature things it takes a real
[23:19] mature christian to have all your
[23:20] relationships obedient to the word
[23:23] and ministries
[23:25] because a lot of people don't even know
[23:26] what their ministry is and the church
[23:27] said
[23:28] they don't even know should i fast
[23:30] should i pray should i alms give shall i
[23:31] make clothes what should i do some
[23:33] people don't even know but you need to
[23:34] know praise god
[23:37] brother braham said in one place he said
[23:38] if you're not sure just try it
[23:40] he said just go try witness to somebody
[23:42] see maybe witnessing your ministry it's
[23:44] not preaching it's witnessing
[23:46] right just witnessing and trying to win
[23:48] so that's a ministry but you got to be
[23:50] obedient just like a preacher i can
[23:52] preach but i want to be preaching what
[23:54] jesus wants me to preach amen not that
[23:57] what i want not some of my own personal
[23:59] vendettas or something like that revenge
[24:01] tour or something like that i don't want
[24:03] to be on a revenge tour i want to be on
[24:05] a salvation tour amen
[24:07] i'm going to be on a victory tour where
[24:09] people can get victory and we can break
[24:11] the curses of the past amen
[24:14] and live in the blessings of god living
[24:16] all those spiritual blessings
[24:18] in christ jesus amen
[24:20] hallelujah
[24:22] that's the one we got to make sure we
[24:24] got to make sure that we're doing the
[24:25] right job god wants us to do
[24:27] like that one guy said brother branham
[24:29] can i own uh can i own a jukebox
[24:33] remember this is back in the 60s when
[24:34] they had jukeboxes
[24:36] i was born in 1980 so i remember i
[24:37] remember some jukeboxes at the pizza
[24:39] shop i don't know
[24:40] i used to put quarters in the jukebox
[24:41] and play rock and roll before i was a
[24:43] christian that's sinful right but they
[24:45] asked brother branham in 1964. brother
[24:47] brown can i own a jukebox and let the
[24:49] teenagers come in there and play rock
[24:51] and roll he said no i'd either sell it
[24:52] or get the jukebox out
[24:55] isn't that wisdom
[24:56] that sounds like meat to me
[24:58] well i gotta make money we'll make money
[25:00] some other way
[25:01] you should never make money off the
[25:03] devil
[25:04] right don't let the devil pay you let
[25:06] god reward you amen
[25:09] work for god honor god in church i
[25:11] promise you if you honor god god will
[25:13] pour out the blessings he'll open up the
[25:15] windows of heaven if you just honor him
[25:17] praise god
[25:19] make sure you're living and you possess
[25:21] that land
[25:23] hallelujah amen everything i put my hand
[25:25] to god is blessed as long as i've
[25:27] honored him
[25:28] financially whatever my job
[25:31] everything i put my hand to god has
[25:33] blessed it
[25:34] hallelujah
[25:37] like i was telling sabrina except for
[25:38] the principle i try to get three
[25:39] principal jobs and each time they turn
[25:41] me down but after i saw what happened to
[25:42] covet i'm glad i wasn't a principal
[25:45] those guys averaged about 20 percent
[25:47] more white hairs last year
[25:49] i want to keep all the black i got no
[25:51] i'm just kidding no it really was a lot
[25:52] of pressure a lot of stress way too many
[25:55] they basically didn't have a family life
[25:57] for a whole year
[25:58] i'm glad i wasn't a principal so i think
[26:00] it was god protecting me
[26:01] also i don't think i'm smart enough
[26:02] either that's just my that's just my
[26:04] honest opinion honestly church you can
[26:05] ask my wife i'm not that smart
[26:07] no
[26:08] and then location church location
[26:11] is god calls you to akron or not
[26:14] are you running from the past
[26:17] are you hoping to leave but god wants
[26:19] you to stay
[26:21] or does god want you to go
[26:23] you got to know thus saith the lord in
[26:25] other words god's got to guide you and
[26:26] lead you and bless you and show you
[26:29] you're in the right place to live praise
[26:30] god
[26:31] and where you live is just like abraham
[26:33] said god told abraham you'll be blessed
[26:36] and you'll be a blessing whenever it's
[26:38] god's will
[26:39] when you're in god's will you'll see god
[26:41] bless you through other people and then
[26:43] you will bless other people
[26:45] amen just like father abraham praise god
[26:48] how many children of abraham do we have
[26:50] here tonight that have faith in jesus
[26:52] christ amen that blessing still pertains
[26:55] to you amen he said the blessing of
[26:58] abraham will impact every nation all
[27:00] nations that includes the us we're
[27:03] blessed because of abraham
[27:05] amen so we keep god's word
[27:08] and that's just a quick review now
[27:11] brother says
[27:12] we're talking to spiritual canaanites
[27:16] he says that the spiritual israelis
[27:18] possess the land aren't you glad you
[27:20] come out of egypt's guard
[27:22] so you don't eat the world's foods
[27:23] anymore
[27:25] i'm talking about lusts and sin and
[27:27] smoking and drinking and cussing and
[27:29] like i used to do all those movies and i
[27:31] used to do all that
[27:32] right we don't eat that anymore we got a
[27:35] holy diet i've got a holy man's taste
[27:37] now
[27:38] i can't stomach those old things like
[27:39] that
[27:41] they'll corrupt you
[27:42] he said aren't you glad you come out of
[27:44] egypt's garlic aren't you glad you're
[27:46] out of the wilderness ah i'm touched
[27:48] we're not wandering around where am i
[27:49] going where am i going am i in the right
[27:51] place should i go over here shall i go
[27:53] over there i know right where i'm at
[27:55] praise god i know right where god wants
[27:57] me to be i know exactly what i'm doing i
[27:59] possess god's inheritance for me praise
[28:01] god
[28:02] i'm not wondering from one church to the
[28:04] next or one idea to the next or what if
[28:06] this is right i wonder if that's right
[28:07] we're not wonders the bible said cain
[28:10] was a wandering star he wandered around
[28:12] because he was mocked by the beast but
[28:14] we're people that know their position
[28:16] they know where god's called us and
[28:17] we're doing exactly like abraham we're
[28:19] taking the land that god gave us amen
[28:23] that's right
[28:26] and remember they had to eat manna
[28:27] angels food out of heaven until they
[28:29] crossed over in the land and when they
[28:31] crossed over the land the man has ceased
[28:32] to fall they were fully matured then and
[28:34] they eat the old corn of the land
[28:37] now now that you're not babies anymore
[28:39] now that you're not desiring the sincere
[28:41] milk of the gospel you don't have to be
[28:43] babied and patted and persuaded to come
[28:45] to church now that you're really fully
[28:47] mature christians you're ready to eat
[28:49] some strong meats now
[28:52] hallelujah you're ready to come into
[28:54] something he said you're ready to
[28:56] understand something that's deep and
[28:59] rich
[29:01] hallelujah
[29:02] also when you're born again you have a
[29:04] clear understanding
[29:07] brother bram said how many received the
[29:08] holy ghost aren't you glad you're in the
[29:09] land over here now eating the old corn
[29:11] eating the strong things of god and you
[29:13] got a clear understanding your spiritual
[29:16] mind is all unmuddled up in other words
[29:19] it's all cleared up
[29:21] muddled is dirty so unmuddled is clear
[29:24] it's all cleared up you know exactly now
[29:26] look you know exactly who god is
[29:29] it's not buddha
[29:30] it's not allah amen praise god it's
[29:32] jesus christ that's who god is
[29:34] amen like we talk with those hindus
[29:37] it's jesus christ praise god there's
[29:39] only one holy book praise god there's
[29:40] only one god amen there's only one media
[29:43] between god and man there's only one
[29:45] high priest in heaven that's god's son
[29:47] jesus christ amen
[29:49] all these other gods are false in their
[29:51] lives and their devils amen disguised as
[29:54] angels of light but we know exactly who
[29:56] god is amen
[29:58] we got a clear understanding
[30:00] and you know exactly where you're going
[30:05] i'm going to eat more meat praise god
[30:07] hallelujah i'm going to possess all
[30:09] those areas of my land
[30:12] that's where i'm going
[30:14] i'm going up yonder to the rapture too
[30:16] i'm going to heaven as well
[30:18] praise god i know exactly where i'm
[30:19] going i'm not going to ecumenical
[30:21] council and just so sabrina knows i
[30:23] don't know if she's ever heard this the
[30:24] bible tells us thus saith the lord
[30:26] there's going to be a one world religion
[30:28] at the end time
[30:30] so just so sabrina knows now and it's
[30:32] going to be headed up by the pope
[30:34] so you and i we all need to stay a
[30:35] million miles away from denominations
[30:39] because the pope is going to unite all
[30:40] the denominations together you can see
[30:42] it now look at all the people caving to
[30:44] the vaccine mandates that's just a
[30:46] vaccine that's a natural thing what
[30:47] about the spiritual mark what about the
[30:50] spiritual mark when they touch your bank
[30:52] account
[30:53] now it's just you lose your job you can
[30:54] go get another job
[30:56] but it's coming to the spot where you
[30:57] can't not get another job and you can't
[30:59] even buy food unless you have their mark
[31:02] but thank god the bible said that those
[31:04] who have the seal of god jesus will
[31:06] rescue them he'll keep them from the day
[31:08] of wrath praise god he will rescue them
[31:10] he'll meet them in the air jesus christ
[31:12] will meet his wife in the air praise god
[31:15] amen
[31:16] jesus said because you kept the word of
[31:18] my patience in revelation 3 10 he said i
[31:20] will keep you from the our temptation
[31:23] that comes upon the whole face of the
[31:25] earth amen
[31:26] in other words we will not be here if
[31:28] we're born again we will not be here
[31:30] when they lay down that mark
[31:33] we're gonna miss it praise god
[31:35] say thank you lord amen
[31:37] hallelujah
[31:39] so we're just seeing
[31:40] all this vaccine stuff it's just
[31:42] prefigured to the mark of the beast
[31:44] that's all it is
[31:45] so we got to be able to know what god's
[31:47] calling us to do
[31:49] i'm still not getting that vaccine
[31:53] you've heard about it people their body
[31:54] parts are messed up a woman died last
[31:56] week a healthy woman died after getting
[31:59] the vaccine last week
[32:01] i don't know why all my friends nobody
[32:02] gets sick i don't know i don't
[32:03] understand that
[32:05] but it's just it's awful that these
[32:06] things happen
[32:07] i'm not going to get it
[32:09] he says you wouldn't know exactly where
[32:11] you're going you know exactly all about
[32:13] it
[32:15] so you can tell me a lot about where
[32:16] you're going
[32:19] praise god
[32:20] you know in whom you believed
[32:23] and persuaded that jesus is able to keep
[32:26] that which you've committed to him
[32:28] against the day
[32:30] in other words you and i have committed
[32:32] our souls to god for that day lord i
[32:35] just want everything to be right on that
[32:37] day i've committed all my all my past
[32:40] all my present on my future i put all of
[32:43] me my soul is in your hands and i'm
[32:46] trusting that you'll receive me on that
[32:48] day praise god
[32:50] you know all about it
[32:52] you remember when you did it you
[32:53] remember when it happened praise god you
[32:55] know where you're going you know who god
[32:56] is praise god you know all about it when
[32:58] you're born again
[33:01] hallelujah oh that's the one that paul
[33:03] is talking to now
[33:05] these mature believers they feast on
[33:07] mature food
[33:09] and they have a clear understanding
[33:13] now this is the scripture where paul
[33:15] says
[33:16] i'll just skip down here for i he says
[33:18] he's not ashamed of jesus right for i
[33:20] know whom i have believed he knew he
[33:22] believed jesus and i'm persuaded he's
[33:24] able to keep that which i have committed
[33:26] unto him against that day what did paul
[33:28] have to commit to him all the murders
[33:29] that he was responsible for
[33:31] he was guilty of all those murders
[33:34] all the beatings of all those christians
[33:36] he had to commit that to god lord i i
[33:38] still feel guilty at times i know you've
[33:39] forgiven me but i'm committing that to
[33:41] you that your word is true your word
[33:43] says you'll forgive all my
[33:45] transgressions amen come under your
[33:47] blood and all unrighteousness will be
[33:49] taken away from me and your
[33:50] righteousness you've given it to me
[33:52] praise god
[33:53] you have to commit that to god
[33:55] my past glory my past i committed to
[33:58] jesus amen i'm not going to worry about
[34:00] it i'm not going to stew over i've
[34:02] committed to him i put it in the hands
[34:04] of the nail scarred hands amen
[34:07] amen and that proves he died to forgive
[34:09] my past amen my past is in his head but
[34:12] thank god my future's in his hands
[34:15] i don't know you praise god
[34:17] amen
[34:19] that's exactly right church
[34:20] so that's what you should be as a mature
[34:22] christian
[34:23] you know where you come from you know
[34:25] all about it you know where you're going
[34:26] you know you're god that's right the
[34:28] only way to know god though is know his
[34:30] word
[34:32] so that means we're bible readers praise
[34:33] god
[34:34] also when you're in that land church you
[34:36] are subject and ready to serve god in
[34:39] any way
[34:40] that's why you should be open to a
[34:41] prayer ministry
[34:43] that's why you should be open to a
[34:44] clothing ministry
[34:47] that's why you should be open to a
[34:48] fasting ministry
[34:52] right
[34:53] because when you're in there you can
[34:54] you're so in love with jesus you'll do
[34:56] whatever he says you should do
[34:58] praise god
[35:00] remember brother said he said friday is
[35:02] my fast day
[35:04] brother bran would not eat on fridays
[35:05] because that was the day leading into
[35:07] his weekend services
[35:09] right saturday night sunday sunday
[35:11] morning sunday night services he had a
[35:13] day where he had to consecrate that was
[35:15] a ministry of his fasting
[35:18] hallelujah
[35:19] so you got to be subject to that
[35:22] praise god
[35:23] brother man says if you want a
[35:24] successful ministry you got to pray for
[35:26] the preachers that's right and then the
[35:27] preachers got to pray for you
[35:29] right we pray for one another
[35:32] praise god
[35:33] so we have to be so in love with each
[35:35] other that we pray for one another
[35:37] hallelujah
[35:40] see my when i get in this land it's mine
[35:43] i'm home now
[35:45] i'm in canaan
[35:47] it may not look like canaan but brother
[35:48] william i'm in canaan
[35:50] hallelujah i'm subject to anything god
[35:54] wants to use me for
[35:57] if god wants me to make youtube videos
[35:58] i'll make youtube videos
[36:00] now it's easy to say that because i've
[36:01] already made about 80.
[36:03] but if god would want me to stop that i
[36:04] can do something else
[36:06] right
[36:07] whatever god would have me to do
[36:09] we want to be subject lord what are you
[36:11] leading me to do now
[36:14] i want to hear your voice and church the
[36:16] way you know remember again brother
[36:17] explained it the way you know it's god's
[36:19] will
[36:20] is if it aligns up with all the word of
[36:22] god
[36:24] and you have a burden to do it and it's
[36:26] the right timing as well
[36:28] you kind of narrowed it down to those in
[36:30] that that quote with brother uh perry
[36:32] green he said
[36:33] make sure it lines up with those three
[36:35] it's got to be in god's right timing and
[36:37] if he calls you to do something that
[36:38] involves money then god will already
[36:40] provide it
[36:41] you want to beg nobody for nothing
[36:44] right
[36:45] how many emails do i get of people
[36:46] begging me for money overseas all the
[36:47] time i get them all the time so i send
[36:49] them a little bit and i never hear back
[36:50] from them anymore like one guy told me
[36:52] recently he said i want you to mentor me
[36:54] i want you to do all these things i said
[36:56] well how much money do you want well i'm
[36:57] sorry i didn't say i just said i'll just
[36:58] send you a hundred dollars i never heard
[37:00] back from after after got the money he
[37:01] never wanted me to mentor him anymore
[37:03] because he wasn't after the mentor and
[37:04] he's after the money
[37:06] praise god
[37:07] but jesus said let yourself be used
[37:10] he said pray for those who despitefully
[37:13] use you amen amen
[37:15] bless those who curse you
[37:17] amen now we're talking christianity amen
[37:21] be good to those who are bad to you

[37:25] maturity now

[37:42] he's got supernatural strength you'll
[37:44] feel the power come upon you amen just
[37:47] crucify that flesh crucify those old
[37:49] feelings and talk to them if they hurt
[37:51] you talk to them but then you'll feel
[37:52] the love of god come over your heart
[37:54] praise god
[37:56] and you'll be able to say that i love
[37:57] you i forgive you i i'm not going to
[38:00] look at that anymore

[44:46] hallelujah
[44:48] heavenly places in christ jesus
[44:51] he said oh
[44:53] what could happen tonight
[44:55] see that's why last week was so
[44:56] beautiful brother benjamin brought those
[44:58] uh sabrina and chrissette it was so
[45:01] beautiful
[45:02] it was totally led of the holy ghost
[45:04] because i think it was the first time
[45:05] chrissette really heard the gospel
[45:08] right
[45:09] it was so led in the lord naomi was
[45:10] telling me how the holy spirit was
[45:12] working on the girls and how she was
[45:13] praying about her girls wanting to be
[45:15] baptized for a while and just had to let
[45:17] the holy ghost work it out
[45:19] so see last week all these we had
[45:21] visitors and everybody was pulling
[45:24] and the heavenly atmosphere dropped down
[45:28] and three souls were saved amen last
[45:31] wednesday night we ought to we ought to
[45:33] shout praise the lord ready praise the
[45:34] lord three souls officially gave their
[45:38] hearts to jesus christ and now there's a
[45:40] place in heaven for them now it was
[45:41] always there right but now they know now
[45:44] they know they know exactly who their
[45:46] god is they know exactly where they're
[45:47] going praise god now they know they've
[45:49] got a place in heaven because they met
[45:51] god's requirements amen
[45:54] repent and be baptized
[45:57] hallelujah in the name of jesus christ
[46:00] for the remission of sins and you shall
[46:02] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[46:05] amen
[46:06] how often does that happen don't happen
[46:07] to her like that on wednesday night
[46:10] so see we got into heavenly places last
[46:12] week
[46:14] people were sincere they were really
[46:15] listening they were pulling they were
[46:17] saying amen
[46:18] people were praying
[46:21] that's how we get a heavenly atmosphere
[46:24] see it doesn't have to always be a
[46:24] supernatural miracle although we thank
[46:26] god for those those are awesome but
[46:28] there's no greater miracle than a soul
[46:30] being saved
[46:31] because you could be healed and you
[46:33] could get sick again
[46:34] you could die but then you're just dead
[46:37] right
[46:38] but when your soul
[46:40] is saved you go from death to life and
[46:43] jesus said when you believe in me you
[46:45] passed from death unto life and there's
[46:48] no going back praise god
[46:51] when you get born again you're sealed to
[46:53] the day of your redemption
[46:58] brother you were here to see it too
[46:59] brother that's the that that's how i
[47:01] know it was led to the holy ghost you
[47:02] were here to see it brother all right on
[47:04] time right on god's time peace
[47:06] he's always right on time praise god
[47:10] what does it look like church the holy
[47:12] spirit spirit's moving over just a
[47:14] preacher's heart
[47:15] no you know you don't believe that
[47:18] every heart that's been regenerated and
[47:20] become a new creature
[47:22] all sins are under the blood
[47:25] jesus forgive me my thoughts forgive me
[47:27] of my words forgive me if i mistreated
[47:28] that brother sister
[47:30] he said we're in perfect worship with
[47:32] our hands up to god our hearts lifted
[47:34] setting together in heavenly places in

[50:28] like a tornado or something
[50:30] god's like i just heal the fever
[50:32] come on church we got to open our eyes
[50:34] praise god
[50:36] did you ever send one i send them all
[50:37] the time that's why i'm a christian
[50:40] because i want to live in heavenly
[50:41] places
[50:42] i don't love this world the bible said
[50:44] if you love the world and the things of
[50:46] the world then the love of god is not
[50:48] even in you we love jesus so jesus's
[50:51] presence is here heaven is here you
[50:53] should love it praise god
[50:56] amen
[50:59] where do we get blessings of what he
[51:00] says blessings of what
[51:03] divine healing
[51:06] we had that
[51:08] for knowledge
[51:09] god will foretell us something to come
[51:12] i don't see that one too much but i'm
[51:13] sure we get we've had it before i know
[51:15] we've had with dreams dreams and
[51:16] foretold things that are going to happen
[51:18] revelation out of the word we get them
[51:20] all the time cam brought a great
[51:21] revelation on zion that's a revelation
[51:23] from the word
[51:24] that's beautiful saturday night
[51:28] he says visions
[51:31] right i don't see many visions but i've
[51:32] seen maybe one i think in my life
[51:34] powers any supernatural blessing of
[51:36] power tongues we don't see many of those
[51:38] that's okay it's not the evidence of the
[51:40] holy ghost a christian life is the
[51:42] evidence of the holy ghost
[51:43] a life that lives just like jesus that's
[51:45] the evidence of the holy ghost because
[51:46] that's what he was filled with
[51:48] i've seen a lot of people speak in
[51:49] tongues and go get divorced and marry
[51:51] again and cuss and swear and live in the
[51:53] world that proves that they're the ones
[51:54] crucifying the son of god afresh
[51:57] they just got enough anointing to get a
[51:59] gift operating but then they didn't get
[52:00] their soul saved
[52:03] they just sat under that and said oh
[52:04] this is good
[52:06] and then they did something supernatural
[52:07] yeah god did it but if god doesn't get
[52:10] in their heart then they're not saying
[52:11] praise god they gotta let god all the
[52:13] way and you gotta love god with all your
[52:15] heart soul minded strength amen
[52:18] hallelujah
[52:21] wisdom interpretations knowledge all the
[52:24] heavenly blessings joy unspeakable
[52:27] and full of glory
[52:30] every heart filled with the spirit
[52:32] walking together setting together in
[52:34] heavenly places not one evil thought
[52:37] among us
[52:41] not one evil thought among it if you got
[52:44] one just cast it aside say forgive me
[52:45] jesus i'm focusing on you right now
[52:48] not one cigarette smoked
[52:51] not one short dress right not one this
[52:53] or other because a short dress where
[52:54] they're trying to they're trying to
[52:55] tempt men
[52:57] that's what that's why they got him up
[52:58] so high they're trying to tempt the men
[53:00] right they're not trying to glorify god
[53:02] with that they're trying to attempt the
[53:03] men just like a man that i walked in the
[53:06] giant eagle yesterday no kidding this
[53:07] man had arms that were about this big
[53:10] i was taller than him
[53:12] and he's got his shirt off and his big
[53:14] muscles bulging out i'm like well who's
[53:15] he trying to impress i mean he's trying
[53:17] to catch the ladies
[53:19] i mean come on dude
[53:21] see
[53:23] same thing a man or woman can have that
[53:24] love spirit on him
[53:26] right but not among us amen
[53:29] not among us amen we put all the focus
[53:32] all the attention is on loving jesus
[53:35] amen
[53:37] right you don't want other people's
[53:39] attention you want their attention on
[53:40] jesus
[53:42] that's why we dress holy
[53:46] right
[53:48] no but look at this not one evil thought
[53:50] nobody got anything against one another
[53:52] that's right
[53:53] hallelujah
[53:56] that's how you get heavenly places
[53:57] that's right
[53:59] and remember if they hurt your church
[54:00] just go to them let's go to them i told
[54:03] you about a brother i was mentoring he
[54:04] went and talked to one person this week
[54:06] that that he had offended for years and
[54:08] apologized and he said the person
[54:10] wouldn't receive it so he kept saying no
[54:12] i am sorry i've done this and that and
[54:13] finally they received it
[54:15] and he said he felt so much better
[54:18] that's the way to be clean church
[54:20] that's like taking a bath
[54:22] right because your mind you feel all
[54:23] dirty because you've got this against
[54:24] that person you're so upset but if you
[54:26] go make that right now you just took a
[54:28] bath
[54:29] i'm clean i'm walking the blessings of
[54:31] god and he thanked me he said thank you
[54:33] for your mentoring it's leading me into
[54:35] more love
[54:36] i said well that's exactly what the
[54:38] bible is supposed to do praise god
[54:40] you'll know they're my disciples because
[54:42] their love one for another praise god
[54:44] see that takes real christianity that's
[54:46] meat though that's me
[54:48] that's that's real meat right there
[54:50] going to a person who's offended you or
[54:51] you've offended them that's real meat
[54:55] everybody speaking in love and harmony
[55:01] everybody with one accord in one place
[55:04] then suddenly they're coming from heaven
[55:06] a sound like a rushing mighty wind there
[55:09] you are has blessed us with all
[55:11] spiritual blessings amen hallelujah
[55:14] praise god so we got to get all prayed
[55:16] up we got to get all of our sins
[55:18] confessed we got to live right we gotta
[55:19] have all the right motives and
[55:21] objectives and then when we're together
[55:22] we're all happy loving and then the holy
[55:25] ghost will fall praise god amen
[55:28] hallelujah
[55:31] like last week i'm trying to remember
[55:33] when it fell right right at the end i
[55:34] think i think everybody was really amen
[55:36] really hard at the asher's blessings
[55:37] right and i felt the holy ghost fall and
[55:39] that's why i said i got a cast in that
[55:41] do they want to be baptized whenever we
[55:43] have guests i always ask them if they
[55:44] want to be baptized
[55:45] well this time it was nature and virtue
[55:48] right and then chrissette came up
[55:50] so he waited till that holy spirit fell
[55:53] at church i've done that many times i've
[55:55] offered many times for people to be
[55:56] baptized and they don't respond well how
[55:58] come they respond this time because the
[56:00] people love god
[56:01] heavenly laces they want these hearts
[56:04] already the hearts have been prepared to
[56:06] receive the seed seed of preaching from
[56:09] good ground
[56:12] it wasn't waste ground it wasn't stony
[56:15] ground it wasn't cares of the world
[56:17] ground it's the good ground amen
[56:20] which means an honest and good heart
[56:24] and then when it falls on that it'll
[56:26] produce good fruit
[56:30] thank you jesus
[56:33] now here's here's the maturity right
[56:34] here this is a real church this is what
[56:36] i believe we're growing to
[56:37] i believe that for all 15 years i've
[56:39] been a pastor i'm going to keep
[56:40] believing as long as i'm a pastor
[56:43] then the holy spirit will fall on
[56:44] somebody and say thus saith the lord go
[56:46] to a certain place do a certain thing
[56:48] watch it happen just like that
[56:52] that is real christianity right there
[56:54] thus saith the lord do a certain thing
[56:55] in a certain place watch it happen like
[56:57] that bless us together in all heavenly
[56:59] places
[57:00] in christ jesus i've seen that in my
[57:01] life i've seen that maybe three or four
[57:03] times in a church
[57:04] three or four times in a church i've
[57:06] seen that once here but i wasn't here i
[57:08] heard about it on the tape when i was
[57:10] out
[57:11] right we had a brother come in 2011
[57:14] and he said thus saith the lord he said
[57:16] the holy spirit i remember he said the
[57:19] holy spirit says some of you are
[57:20] spiritually dying you better repent and
[57:21] get right so i went up after that he did
[57:23] a tongue interpretation i went through
[57:25] the church and i texted everybody and
[57:26] said was anybody spiritual spiritually
[57:28] dying and i found three people that said
[57:30] they were spiritually dying and they
[57:31] were gonna get their hearts right with
[57:32] god
[57:33] and all three not all three are here
[57:35] anymore but all three are still in the
[57:36] message church
[57:38] see they took heed to the warning
[57:41] it was thus saith the spirit they were
[57:42] spiritually dying and if they don't do
[57:44] something they're going to die that
[57:45] means go to hell that's right right
[57:48] and all three obeyed and all three are
[57:50] still serving the lord amen
[57:53] so that's one of the closest i've seen
[57:54] i've also seen at the lima church
[57:57] there was a sister that got the holy
[58:00] ghost on her and she said thus saith the
[58:02] lord she called this brother's name
[58:03] allahu allahu you did this this and that
[58:05] and he come up crying
[58:08] and he repented of his sins that was a
[58:10] long time ago that's probably 2005
[58:13] 2006 called him by name
[58:16] and there's because he was out pardoning
[58:17] or something the night before and that
[58:18] sister called it out she didn't even
[58:19] know nothing about it
[58:21] and he come up crying now he don't serve
[58:22] the lord right now but he he's tried
[58:24] before but he just gets in the world
[58:27] so see church how we want to be more
[58:28] mature
[58:30] see if we come to church expect
[58:31] something like that we probably see more
[58:33] happen
[58:34] right but that's why that's why god
[58:35] gives us grace to grow amen that's why
[58:38] it's good to pray before the service
[58:39] amen that's why it's good to pray for
[58:41] the servants to pull during the service
[58:42] praise god
[58:46] you don't know what's gonna happen you
[58:47] never know when those little lambs are
[58:48] to come back into the fold amen you
[58:51] never know when god's going to call the
[58:52] lambs and go get the lambs he puts you
[58:54] on his shoulder that's what the bible
[58:55] says when you got saved last week jesus
[58:57] you were wandering away jesus picked you
[58:58] up put you on his shoulders and he
[59:00] carried you back to all of us
[59:02] same thing for virtue and nature they
[59:04] jesus picked you up put put you on the
[59:06] strongest spot his shoulders and carry
[59:09] you now with all the spiritual blessings
[59:11] in christ jesus amen you're not
[59:13] wondering girls you made it home praise
[59:16] god
[59:17] amen hallelujah
[59:18] jesus brought you home
[59:20] i didn't hear you i remember when he
[59:22] brought me home too
[59:23] that was a glorious day
[59:25] oh hallelujah thank god amen
[59:28] 19 years of wandering away but finally
[59:31] before the 20th year jesus saved me he
[59:34] redeemed me and he carried me back to
[59:36] the fold amen
[59:37] thank god and i've been here ever since
[59:40] hallelujah i haven't left i'm staying
[59:43] i'm a sheep praise god and he's my
[59:46] shepherd
[59:47] praise god let me try to finish here
[59:54] one time i
[59:56] one time i didn't say thus saith the
[59:57] lord but i was preaching on saul it was
[59:58] actually in this room right here right
[1:00:00] when we moved in here i was preaching on
[1:00:02] king saul he was how he was
[1:00:03] denominational
[1:00:06] and he disobeyed god and a brother
[1:00:08] crying in that parking lot right out
[1:00:10] there he grabbed me and said jesse you
[1:00:12] just preached my whole life he said i
[1:00:14] was just arrested for child abuse and
[1:00:16] i'm going to the jail he said i did
[1:00:18] exactly what you said what uh what king
[1:00:20] saul did
[1:00:22] and so i prayed for him i know he got
[1:00:23] out eventually he's out now i haven't
[1:00:25] had much contact with him but that was
[1:00:27] thus saith the lord to him
[1:00:29] because in prison he could have chose
[1:00:30] the wrong way right a lot of people do
[1:00:32] that
[1:00:33] right but if god's grace is with you
[1:00:35] he'll be with you in the prison too
[1:00:37] his grace don't fail in the prison
[1:00:39] hallelujah
[1:00:41] because we were all in a spiritual
[1:00:43] prison amen
[1:00:44] and jesus never left us he never forsook
[1:00:47] us but it goes to show many times we
[1:00:49] receive the word of god we just got to
[1:00:51] be humble enough and prayed up enough to
[1:00:53] receive it
[1:00:55] that's right
[1:00:57] as i guess you know i could think of
[1:00:59] more and more times like that
[1:01:01] or some of those things have happened
[1:01:04] now let me close with this
[1:01:06] church right now you see it you know
[1:01:08] there's just amongst our churches
[1:01:09] sometimes there's just differences right
[1:01:11] and some brothers don't fellowship with
[1:01:12] other brothers some sisters don't
[1:01:14] fellowship with other sisters
[1:01:16] and brother william we appreciate this
[1:01:18] i'm sure
[1:01:20] brother brahm said thus saith the lord
[1:01:23] god is going to break down
[1:01:24] denominational barriers before the
[1:01:26] rapture
[1:01:27] before he raptures the bride okay i'm
[1:01:29] not going to read all this we talked
[1:01:30] about solomon didn't need any tools
[1:01:33] he says god see that but god is cutting
[1:01:35] out
[1:01:36] everywhere born again children of god to
[1:01:38] bring them together
[1:01:40] he says someday those denominational
[1:01:41] barriers and ideas that fanatics has got
[1:01:44] up there scooped around separate the
[1:01:46] people will be taken away god will bring
[1:01:48] his church together and take it home
[1:01:50] just as certain as anything in the world
[1:01:52] that's gonna it's gonna come that's
[1:01:54] prophecy remember i spoke that i spoke
[1:01:55] that in the name of the lord you can
[1:01:56] write that down in your book now that
[1:01:58] was true
[1:02:00] now it's a very general prophecy but
[1:02:02] it's still prophecy
[1:02:04] that means god has holy ghost-filled
[1:02:06] saints that have some denominational
[1:02:09] thoughts among them
[1:02:11] can just admitted he had some
[1:02:14] i'm sure i've had some
[1:02:17] there can be holy ghost-filled people
[1:02:19] and get a denominational thought all
[1:02:21] denominational thought is is the thought
[1:02:22] of man instead of god
[1:02:25] that's all it is oh we're gonna do this
[1:02:26] because man says this is good
[1:02:29] right cam was given examples about like
[1:02:31] young people's nights which it's okay to
[1:02:32] have that but you better make sure it's
[1:02:33] a letter of the lord amen not just
[1:02:35] copying the world
[1:02:37] right because some of those churches
[1:02:38] came talked about they have those uh
[1:02:40] young people nights some of those young
[1:02:41] people slip away and they commit sexual
[1:02:43] sin
[1:02:44] while everybody else is you know at the
[1:02:46] media or the game or whatever they'll
[1:02:48] slip off and they've had problems with
[1:02:49] that over the years
[1:02:51] how is that led of the lord
[1:02:53] let's not let the lord
[1:02:54] because it was led the lord god would
[1:02:55] bless it amen
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:58] god would bless it
[1:03:00] so it's the thought of man it's
[1:03:02] denominational
[1:03:04] but not a church and he says long now
[1:03:06] look how many ever heard of preachers
[1:03:08] argued and fussing
[1:03:09] if you as long as you argue and fuss
[1:03:11] you're in kindergarten he says god will
[1:03:13] just keep you there till you learn
[1:03:15] enough to get out in other words you're
[1:03:16] going to drink milk
[1:03:19] you're not going to eat the meat of
[1:03:20] god's word if you're just going to argue
[1:03:22] and fuss and just try to be smarter try
[1:03:24] to be better than somebody else instead
[1:03:26] of saying you're sorry
[1:03:28] or saying you know what's okay you
[1:03:29] believe different that's fine i love you
[1:03:31] anyway
[1:03:33] god's gonna keep you in
[1:03:35] kindergarten
[1:03:37] remember and he used the example in the
[1:03:38] bible days jesus disciples saw people
[1:03:41] casting out devils he said you can't
[1:03:42] cast out devils you're not part of our
[1:03:44] group
[1:03:45] and jesus said forbid them not
[1:03:48] so the preachers had denominational
[1:03:49] spirit if you're not in my group you
[1:03:50] shouldn't be doing it
[1:03:52] right that's brother brahma's example he
[1:03:55] said if they won't join up don't forbid
[1:03:56] him go on that's the way to do it so see
[1:03:59] denominational spirits are trying to
[1:04:01] control people and make them do what you
[1:04:03] want them to do
[1:04:05] instead of letting them do what god has
[1:04:06] called them to do
[1:04:08] so denominational spirits are trying to
[1:04:10] control you that's what all the
[1:04:11] denominations do they control you we've
[1:04:12] seen it they control you in a church
[1:04:14] service right we've he and i have
[1:04:16] visited 11 churches over the last two
[1:04:17] months and they control everybody you
[1:04:19] can only do what they say only do what
[1:04:21] that's it that's all you can do
[1:04:22] just what the creed says do what the
[1:04:24] creed says do what the the flyer says
[1:04:26] right just stay with that
[1:04:28] you can't do anything else outside of
[1:04:29] that
[1:04:30] that's a creed that's a denominational
[1:04:32] spirit
[1:04:34] now how many member polycarp
[1:04:36] polycarp was a student of john the
[1:04:38] divine the one who wrote first john 2
[1:04:41] john 3 john and then book of revelation
[1:04:45] he wrote the book of revelation
[1:04:47] john wrote the book of revelation but
[1:04:49] his disciple under him was polycarp
[1:04:53] he was such a godly man church look what
[1:04:55] history says about him
[1:04:56] when they killed him he was killed for
[1:04:58] being a christian
[1:05:00] they didn't even have the time to the
[1:05:01] stake he was such a man of god
[1:05:05] he just stood there by the stake and
[1:05:07] said set me on fire
[1:05:09] they set him on fire the fire moved away
[1:05:12] from his body because he was such a holy
[1:05:13] man
[1:05:17] and it refused to touch him because god
[1:05:18] was showing i've got i got my anointing
[1:05:20] on this man he was then pierced through
[1:05:23] with a sword as this was done water
[1:05:25] gusts from the side drowning the flames
[1:05:27] so that water put out the flames
[1:05:30] his spirit was actually seen to depart
[1:05:32] in the form of a white dove released
[1:05:33] from his
[1:05:34] bosom what a saint yes he said you don't
[1:05:38] have to tie me
[1:05:39] just burn me
[1:05:40] i'll die for jesus whether you're tying
[1:05:42] me down or not what a saint
[1:05:45] he was such a man of god everybody saw
[1:05:47] the miracles around him and yet and then
[1:05:49] he had a dove fly out of his body praise
[1:05:51] god
[1:05:52] in other words his soul left like a dove
[1:05:55] amen just like it came down as enough on
[1:05:58] jesus christ amen
[1:06:01] yet for all this testimony
[1:06:03] the student of john the revelator was
[1:06:05] not militant against nicolaitan
[1:06:08] for he himself leaned towards
