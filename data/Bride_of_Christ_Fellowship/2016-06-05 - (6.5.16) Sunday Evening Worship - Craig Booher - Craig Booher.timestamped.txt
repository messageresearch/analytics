[29:11] bad thing about a Revival me yes sir you
[29:14] come to the end and you're just now
[29:15] starting to feel
[29:18] good and uh hey you know the flesh is
[29:21] weak we got jobs calling on us but we
[29:23] are going to have ourselves a
[29:26] Time so the main thing is we want the
[29:28] Revival to get in our hearts and go home
[29:31] so it's just been enjoyable I just got
[29:33] in last night and enjoyed the preaching
[29:35] and enjoyed this morning just the
[29:37] presence of the Lord and uh just feeling
[29:41] really good I'm not a Sentimental Man
[29:43] but uh this Pulpit does something for
[29:48] me I I was thinking know this is the
[29:50] first Pulpit I ever preached inise Lord
[29:52] was in the old house me just did
[29:55] something Supernatural yeah and there's
[29:57] something you know we all have our own
[29:59] individual experiences and different
[30:00] walks of life that we come from but you
[30:03] know there's certain um certain circles
[30:05] God will have people a part of your life
[30:07] brother Brooks brother Jess and um you
[30:11] know we all kind of come out of a
[30:12] Revival and you can never be the same
[30:15] and so I just looking back at the old
[30:17] memories here we are about 20 years down
[30:19] the road nearly maybe maybe 18 years
[30:21] down the road sir and it's been every
[30:24] step worth it every step
[30:27] every trial every problem I was trying
[30:30] to find the mind of the Lord for the
[30:31] service tonight you know as a preacher
[30:33] does he's always got his antenas up
[30:35] listen and you know and then you'll
[30:37] think you got something and you come
[30:38] right up to service and you're like no
[30:40] no no no I gotta go another way oh boy
[30:43] and uh I I was going to preach on the
[30:45] struggle how God don't take the struggle
[30:47] away God just allows the struggle you
[30:50] know we all struggle but I just feel
[30:52] maybe to preach something different
[30:54] tonight if we could turn in our Bibles
[30:56] to Psalms chapter 32 I want to thank
[30:58] brother Jesse for having us it's been an
[31:00] honor to preach here uh to to this group
[31:03] and those that have come in to support
[31:05] the meetings to be with brother Isaiah
[31:07] and sister Ruby and to be with you all

[31:11] sea or wherever it may be the Holy Ghost

[33:32] looking to you you're the one that we
[33:35] long for you're the one that we hunger
[33:37] for Jesus and God without you we can do
[33:40] nothing but Lord we're looking for a
[33:42] Rapture and we have a lot of needs in
[33:45] our hearts and I look across this
[33:46] audience and I see bright eyes and
[33:49] people worshiping I know they love you
[33:51] yes and dear God we we're have a mutual
[33:54] love for you tonight as we come together
[33:56] in your name bless the pastor of this
[33:58] assembly has a vision for the church to
[34:00] want to see him go forward to see him
[34:03] strengthened dear Lord not that any Hof
[34:05] will be left behind we ask oh God Lord
[34:08] that these words would not fall on deaf
[34:09] ears tonight but Lord they would
[34:11] penetrate the deepest recesses of the
[34:13] heart May there be a flame a lick of
[34:15] fire something Eternal oh God that comes
[34:17] from you that we will be ready oh God
[34:19] for the battles that lay ahead bless
[34:21] each and everyone bless the weary bless
[34:23] the sick bless the strong revive our
[34:26] hearts together in the mighty name of
[34:28] Jesus Christ Our Lord we pray amen God
[34:31] bless you you can have your
[34:33] seats the message that we preach has
[34:35] been sent from almighty God this message
[34:39] did not come from a man from Kentucky or
[34:41] did it come from the wisdom of man or
[34:43] the strength of man or the the guise of
[34:46] man the intelligence of man but this
[34:48] message came from the very mind and
[34:50] heart of God and it has been revealed to
[34:53] this age we are a blessed people can you
[34:55] say amen amen this message is the Word
[34:58] of Life yeah and I cannot express what a
[35:02] treasure this word is that'll really
[35:04] believe it that'll really love it I
[35:06] believe that Jesus said it is the spirit
[35:08] that quickens and the flesh profits
[35:10] nothing the words that I speak he said
[35:13] are spirit and they are life and we
[35:15] believe that testimony tonight the words
[35:18] that God left upon this printed
[35:22] page if we accept it by faith and it
[35:25] falls into a SP then it becomes life to
[35:28] the believer that's why Jesus said I am
[35:31] the truth and the life and the way and
[35:34] it takes the spirit to Quicken the word
[35:37] and that word was meant to be in our
[35:39] hearts not in our heads do you believe
[35:41] that brother bam said when God's word
[35:44] upon his lips it is deity speaking it is
[35:49] God speaking you believe that the word
[35:53] to those that regard it as
[35:55] life
[35:58] hear what I said the Baptists look to
[36:00] the word of God the Catholics look to
[36:02] the word of God many of people look to
[36:05] the word of God but it is only Li to
[36:08] those that regard it is Li there are
[36:11] people that have criticize it it'll be
[36:14] nothing to them there'll be people that
[36:15] are just historically nothing for them
[36:17] but it is only to those that regarded as
[36:20] God's word and life eternal you believe
[36:23] that and throughout the ages Satan saw
[36:26] to devalue it he sought to discredit it
[36:30] he sought to destroy it all through
[36:32] history but he's never been able to do
[36:34] it because God's word is Incorruptible
[36:37] and cannot be destroyed can not be
[36:39] reversed God has a people that will find
[36:42] it you believe that yes random said they
[36:46] had had some sunflower seats in King
[36:48] Tut's Tob and brother random said that
[36:51] it was over what 4,000 years old
[36:53] something of that nature he said they
[36:55] took that seed and planted in the ground
[36:57] that it grew the reason it grew is
[37:00] because originally it came from the
[37:02] mouth of God God spoke it and there was
[37:04] a life that was preserved in that seed
[37:08] and this word is The Incorruptible word
[37:11] of God it is the seed of God and if it
[37:13] falls in a fertile ground it's going to
[37:16] grow as sure as the world because it's
[37:18] God's original you believe that I
[37:21] believe God has preserved his word the
[37:24] Bible said in Psalms 12:7 if you want
[37:26] write it down he said Thou shalt keep
[37:28] he's speaking of his words Thou shalt
[37:30] keep them oh Lord Thou shalt preserve
[37:33] them from this generation forever
[37:37] history has proven how God has preserved
[37:40] his word amen you love the Lord his word
[37:43] has been preserved all the way down
[37:44] Through the Ages many have given their
[37:46] life and Spilled their blood standing
[37:50] for the word that I'm preaching tonight
[37:52] we take it for granted sometimes we
[37:54] don't give it what it deserves the resp
[37:56] and the interest and the time that it
[37:59] deserves but God by his grace has
[38:02] brought it to this generation it's not
[38:04] going to just lay on the Shelf somebody
[38:06] is going to believe it somebody is going
[38:09] to manifest it God don't want it to stay
[38:12] upon the PES he wants it to be
[38:14] manifested in our lives in our action
[38:17] and in our love and would say Lord bre
[38:20] that word upon my
[38:22] heart
[38:24] my said I the Lord BR it out water day
[38:27] and night at least someone shall plck it
[38:30] brother ROM said that the gates of hell
[38:32] would be against this word but it would
[38:34] never Prevail because it is The
[38:38] Incorruptible undestroyable word of God
[38:41] there's been all kinds of devils turn
[38:43] loose to counteract it but the real true
[38:45] word of God will go straight to the end
[38:47] and it'll produce what God promised it
[38:51] would said that in the church age book
[38:55] if God if Satan cannot destroy or the
[38:59] word he'll try
[39:01] to remember how Cain rose up against
[39:04] Abel Abel had the Revelation and Cain
[39:06] rose up against it because God Satan
[39:09] despises this word Satan knows the power
[39:13] behind this word right and it threatens
[39:16] him if he was not threatened by it he
[39:18] wouldn't try to discredit it and stop it
[39:21] he knows what it'll produce in the heart
[39:23] of a man or a woman that believes it let
[39:25] me say it like this he knows how
[39:28] dangerous it is even to get into a Young
[39:30] Person's right God gives the Holy Spirit
[39:34] without the respective person whoever
[39:36] meets those requirements God will give
[39:38] it to him right there brother said when
[39:41] will God give you the Holy Ghost he said
[39:43] when you're ready to die upon the altar
[39:46] with your sacrifice it isn't a Praying
[39:48] all night or a begging or a tring it is
[39:51] a die and God can give you the Holy
[39:54] Spirit Right Where You Are this word is
[39:57] true it's true forever is forever
[40:00] written in heaven you believe that I
[40:03] believe that with all my heart the Bible
[40:05] said in Genesis chapter 3:15 that that
[40:09] the that the seed of the woman would
[40:11] bruise the Serpent's head amen amen and
[40:13] the Serpent's head would bruise his heel
[40:15] now Satan has sought to fight the true
[40:18] seed all the way down Through the Ages
[40:21] you remember Abel had a revelation God
[40:24] uh was using Abel but Satan sought to
[40:27] destroy Abel when Satan destroyed Abel
[40:30] through Cain God just rose up
[40:33] s yes brother said it was a type of
[40:36] Resurrection down when abble up comes
[40:38] Seth and God appoints another seed let
[40:40] me tell you if you don't take this word
[40:42] in your heart God will remove you and
[40:43] put someone else there God help us to be
[40:46] Believers tonight help us to take our
[40:49] Salvation serious if we're going to be
[40:51] Christians let's give everything that we
[40:55] have this final push this final
[40:58] raise you believe that Satan attacked
[41:02] and he killed the prophets because they
[41:03] had the word of God on the inside
[41:06] remember God had told uh Jeremiah said I
[41:09] have put my words in your mouth how many
[41:12] know that we're the final voice to the
[41:14] final age he tried to crucify Jesus he's
[41:17] always trying to cut off the program of
[41:20] God I'll try not to hold you long
[41:22] tonight please
[41:23] stay San always trying to stop the the
[41:28] program of God right quickly when God is
[41:31] trying to do something Satan can almost
[41:34] see it before it happen yes sir and
[41:37] you'll go down through the word of God
[41:38] just like M was a deliverer he was born
[41:40] a deliverer and all of a sudden the
[41:42] decree comes kill all the babies it was
[41:44] Satan trying to cut off the deliverer
[41:47] but he never did it because God's word
[41:49] will prevail just like Abel Cain trying
[41:52] to kill Abel or down through Joseph
[41:55] Joseph the brothers hated him they were
[41:58] trying to cast him down because God's
[42:01] purpose was wrapped up in Joseph all the
[42:03] way down to the chronicles of aalon and
[42:06] uh even in the days of Jesus how the
[42:09] decree went forth to kill the children
[42:11] just to reap but in every instance God
[42:15] preserves his
[42:17] seed in every age God has a people who
[42:21] have the word of the immortal
[42:23] Incorruptible word of God and in every
[42:26] Satan is against that people but I want
[42:28] to follow it through the scriptures in
[42:30] every age God has preserved his seed
[42:34] amen you believe that the days of Noah
[42:38] God's purpose was wrapped up in Noah and
[42:41] God said I'll destroy man whom I have
[42:44] created because he was violent his
[42:46] imaginations were continually evil and
[42:48] the Bible said he perverted his way upon
[42:51] the Earth yes sir but yet God had one
[42:53] man he could put his hand on Amen and
[42:55] the judgments had fell and all of those
[42:58] things but God had preserved his seed
[43:00] Noah all the way through the Judgment
[43:03] the reason that God did this is because
[43:05] God's purpose was in Noah and nothing
[43:08] was going to defeat God's purpose how
[43:11] happy we ought to be tonight to see the
[43:14] revelation of the hour to see the
[43:17] purpose of God and the will of God and
[43:20] to know that God's will will never fail
[43:23] God's purpose will never fail you
[43:26] believe that nothing present nothing to
[43:30] come no sickness sorrow death or
[43:33] anything will separate us from the love
[43:35] of God stop God's
[43:38] plan we have God has made we have a
[43:42] purpose here
[43:44] tonight you believe just like it was in
[43:47] the days of God protected Noah God will
[43:50] protect his people God will protect our
[43:54] young people God will protect his
[43:58] bride God will preserve them and we are
[44:01] preserved in Christ tonight do you
[44:04] believe that Fe God's purpose all hell
[44:06] will be against it but they've never
[44:09] ever defeated God that's why he said
[44:11] fear not little flock it's my father's
[44:13] Good Will to give you the
[44:15] kingdom let me show you how this this
[44:17] goes through the scripture God's hand
[44:19] was upon
[44:20] Abraham and the Bible says touch not my
[44:24] prophets nor do touch not my anointed
[44:27] nor do my prophets no harm while they
[44:29] were a few that God had rebuked Kings
[44:32] for their sake you ever seen that in the
[44:34] script you remember when the king of
[44:37] Egypt had taken Sarah God pled his
[44:43] house did you ever see Jacob when laan
[44:46] was coming after Jacob he had a dream
[44:49] laan then and God told him don't you
[44:53] speak good or evil
[44:58] and so he comes up Peter and he says I'm
[45:00] sorry uh uh Jacob and he tells him in my
[45:03] hand to do you harm he said but your God
[45:06] appeared to me last
[45:09] night then God told God told Jacob I
[45:12] want you to go to
[45:14] bthl and Jacob tells his Wives cast out
[45:17] your idols and they start their way to B
[45:21] the Bible said the fear of God come upon
[45:24] the cities yes sir let me tell you
[45:26] you're you're
[45:28] not
[45:31] God Jacob was pack in God's purpose
[45:34] God's plan and so God preserved Jacob
[45:39] bear with me now so now am sees Sarah
[45:44] and she's beautiful most beautiful
[45:46] granny you ever
[45:49] saw said I want that gr yeah right and
[45:54] and Abraham now is like you tell her my
[45:56] you're my sister now that's carnal it
[45:59] wasn't half a lie but a lie is a lie and
[46:02] so he said you tell you tell them that
[46:04] you're my sister so she does what her
[46:07] husband says and brother R
[46:10] dramatizes
[46:12] this and he said am he's got his little
[46:16] sleeping cap on his stri Jamies he takes
[46:18] a shower and he lays across the bed he
[46:21] said he sticks his big wiggling his toes
[46:24] he said going to have that guy sit
[46:28] he goes to
[46:30] sleep and God comes and say you're as
[46:33] good as a dead
[46:35] man amen and he said Lord I'm an
[46:37] innocent
[46:39] man I that man said it was that this was
[46:43] all legal amen God said I really don't
[46:46] care what you have to say a purpose for
[46:49] this
[46:51] man and he's my prophet and you have
[46:54] touched my anointing
[46:58] Hallelujah he said you you restore that
[47:01] man his wife I love that word Resto you
[47:04] give them back that's what God Said in
[47:07] this AG to the devil you give them back
[47:10] turn them
[47:12] lose Amen Let the weak say they're
[47:15] strong Hallelujah you believe that I
[47:19] want you to notice this amck says here
[47:22] take what you got and go you could you
[47:25] know what God was doing God was
[47:27] preserving the bloodline of
[47:30] Abraham because out of Abraham would
[47:33] come the
[47:34] Mah and if God would preserve the
[47:37] natural light of Abraham what about the
[47:40] spiritual
[47:43] life God was preserving his seed you
[47:47] believe that nothing will defeat God's
[47:51] purpose I was preaching on Joseph this
[47:54] morning how Joseph had a vision that all
[47:57] the sheeps would bow and they would
[48:00] raise back and and bow to him and many
[48:03] years had lapsed and like I said God
[48:06] didn't tell me in between he just said
[48:08] oh they're all bow to you now notice the
[48:11] vision had to come to pass we're
[48:14] laboring on this morning that every word
[48:16] of God is true you believe that amen and
[48:19] so Joseph was sold as a slave and and
[48:21] how he suffered in the dungeon and so on
[48:24] and so forth then he ascends to the
[48:26] right hand of pharaoh according to the
[48:28] word of the Lord amen and there's a
[48:30] Great Famine that strikes the Earth for
[48:32] seven years if you got your bibles if
[48:34] you just open your Bibles I want to show
[48:36] you something here how Joseph remember
[48:41] he was the pharaoh's rightand man his
[48:44] brothers his brothers end healing him
[48:48] and he weeps and he sends everybody out
[48:51] here's his brothers here's the vision
[48:53] God now I mean all the sudden the vision
[48:55] vision is before it let me tell you
[48:57] we've looked for the Rapture for a long
[48:58] time one day we'll wake up and the
[49:01] vision will be there there'll be time to
[49:04] go stand upon the word of God eat this
[49:08] word of God and be ready and be ready to
[49:11] go when God calls if you will Genesis 45
[49:15] verse5 Joseph begins to talk to his
[49:18] brother said come near me and they're
[49:20] shaking in their boots yeah ver chapter
[49:23] 45:5 he said now they be not grieved nor
[49:27] angry with yourselves that you sold me
[49:30] God did send me before you to preserve
[49:34] life and then in verse six he said for
[49:36] these two years has famine been in the
[49:38] land and yet he said there are five
[49:41] years which there shall neither be eing
[49:44] nor Harvest God sent me before you to
[49:48] preserve posterity which means a Remnant
[49:52] in the earth to save your lives by great
[49:56] Deliverance Amen in other words the Seed
[49:58] of Abraham would have been wiped out
[50:01] amen but God foresaw the famine coming
[50:04] and to protect Abraham's Pro posterity
[50:07] yes sir he sent a gift Joseph to save
[50:10] the world to save the
[50:14] elect God preserves
[50:17] his in every God preserves it how many
[50:22] believe that you love the Lord
[50:26] then it begins to unfold in Christ that
[50:29] he was typing Christ who blinds the Jews
[50:33] that the Gentiles might be preserved
[50:36] amen he said don't be angry he'll reveal
[50:39] himself to 144,000 don't be angry with
[50:42] yourselves God did it to preserve
[50:45] life did for you take a picture yes sir
[50:50] and then on your amen Joseph dies there
[50:54] raises up a king who knows not
[50:57] Joseph there was a prophecy that that
[51:01] God would deliver Israel out and I and I
[51:04] believe that Joseph as he was dying he
[51:06] said God will surely deliver you right
[51:09] what he said as he was dying is that God
[51:12] will visit you amen and then he dies yes
[51:15] he just goes quiet God marks that in his
[51:18] eternal book
[51:20] glory amen every promise is good every
[51:24] promise is good yes Egypt begins to
[51:27] afflict the children of Israel and it
[51:29] was only a sign that it's time to go let
[51:31] me tell you the things we're saying is
[51:33] only a sign that it's time to get out of
[51:35] here remember we were prospering as a
[51:38] nation and godly but when the pendulum
[51:42] changed and a president rose up that
[51:44] knew not freedom of religion amen then
[51:47] it was time to go amen amen how many
[51:50] believe we're close can I carry on just
[51:52] a little further now notice this as I
[51:56] mentioned Satan knew that there was a
[51:58] deliver in the land so Pharaoh commands
[52:01] The Midwives to kill all the babies all
[52:04] the boy babies but somehow God begins to
[52:07] work on the heart of these midwives amen
[52:10] and they're like we are not going to
[52:11] obey the king's
[52:13] commandment it is
[52:15] awesome and so they lie uh to protect
[52:18] the babies would say well the Hebrew
[52:20] women are Lively they're not like the
[52:22] Egyptians they're not babied and long
[52:24] nails and look like JY Bells they just
[52:28] you know they just have their babies and
[52:30] get back to
[52:32] work yes the Bible said God bless those
[52:34] big wives touch not my anointing that
[52:39] wonderful now notice this by faith Moses
[52:43] was hit for three months right and we
[52:45] know jocked the story of jocked and she
[52:48] had she had done as long as she could
[52:50] she hid him and God allowed him to be
[52:52] hid under joed's protection that's right
[52:55] but pretty soon they came to a place and
[52:58] she could not hiding no more yes and
[53:01] sometimes God will corner you yes he
[53:03] will sometimes he'll allow everything to
[53:05] go wrong because he's trying to
[53:08] reposition
[53:10] you oh we hate those kind of times but
[53:13] we've got to trust God that he'll never
[53:16] leave you nor forsake you and so she's
[53:19] now I don't know what was happening but
[53:21] now it was really knocking on the door
[53:24] she said we didn't three months he is
[53:26] not safe here she feels a pull yeah and
[53:30] now this is not natural because a mother
[53:34] loves her babies and a mother will fight
[53:36] a crocodile for her baby amen but in
[53:39] this case now I can imagine she was
[53:41] pulled oh God I can't hide him and we
[53:44] begin to panic oh God and Satan's
[53:46] pulling he's gonna die he's gonna Boo
[53:49] and get
[53:51] you cannot do nothing for you but God is
[53:55] over here in a t of War saying believe
[53:58] me trust me and she said but God you
[54:01] revealed to me some way that he is the
[54:03] promised son
[54:05] yeah and so there's a tongue of War
[54:08] going you ever been there
[54:10] before pretty soon she steps out by
[54:12] faith and God said that's what I
[54:14] want she feels inspired to make an arc
[54:18] she begins to pitch and this pitch is
[54:21] the same word that they use in Leviticus
[54:23] for atonement yeah oh yeah amen and so
[54:26] she places her baby in there she closes
[54:31] up the basket and said Lord I commit my
[54:34] baby to you this is Faith this is not a
[54:36] natural for a woman she puts it in a in
[54:39] a a an infested River of
[54:44] crocodiles and she pushes it off and she
[54:47] but she did it by fi amen amen there it
[54:51] goes she's crying the devil saying you

[56:23] Moses that name didn't come from
[56:31] her she don't know sometimes we're

[57:39] turn his back on the treasures of this
[57:41] world do you believe that amen God

[57:58] house but they were as safe as could be
[58:00] no mosquitoes no flies no lives no

[58:05] safe could be amen the Bible tells us
[58:07] the Lord is thy keeper yes he is the
[58:09] Lord shall preserve the from Evil he
[58:12] shall preserve thy Soul God preserve
[58:15] them through the Wilderness Hallelujah

[58:32] his voice where is there a place in the
[58:35] Bible where God spoke out of the pillar
[58:37] of fire outside of
[58:40] sin he spoke to the prophet out of Si
[58:44] but not publicly because they said don't
[58:47] talk least we die you speak to the
[58:49] prophet amen and ever since God has
[58:52] spoke in other words Moses was the voice
[58:55] of the pill

[59:21] amen amen God preserved the nation of
[59:25] Israel by a prophet amen amen we are
[59:29] preserved from the mark of the beast
[59:31] from the s to the darkness of
[59:34] denominationalism we have been preserved
[59:37] by a
[59:41] prophet remember Joshua when he saw as I
[59:45] was with Moses so will I be with thee he
[59:48] went into the promised land and fought a
[59:49] campaign and did not get a scrap God had
[59:53] preserved his people that's right
[59:55] you believe that amen I could show I
[59:57] mean we could really take our time and
[59:59] show how David was preserved everywhere
[1:00:01] he went the Bible said it means to keep
[1:00:04] you safe from
[1:00:06] destruction I tell you we need Captain
[1:00:08] this hour there are demon powers that
[1:00:11] have been loosed Out of Hell the lid of
[1:00:13] hell has been taken off and you can see
[1:00:16] that the crosshairs are on you right
[1:00:18] they're not worried about
[1:00:21] denominationalism it don't take on the
[1:00:22] mark of the beast they're only balancing
[1:00:25] the political Realms but they're where
[1:00:26] they want to go and that's here it won't
[1:00:29] be long till they be knocking on the
[1:00:31] door but God will preserve his people
[1:00:33] amen right you believe that that means
[1:00:36] to maintain to keep you alive in the
[1:00:39] time of Ahab and
[1:00:41] Jezebel Ahab or Jezebel wanted to kill
[1:00:44] off everybody that possessed truth
[1:00:46] remember the 400 prophets and so Ahab
[1:00:50] was just kind of the puppet that did
[1:00:52] what his wife said and she said kill
[1:00:53] that group and he he would do it and and
[1:00:56] so she was just a monster and there's a
[1:00:59] spirit in Jezebel right you love the
[1:01:02] Lord sir yes sir and so Elijah had an
[1:01:07] uncompromising
[1:01:09] spirit so brother Brom said he said the
[1:01:11] spirit of Elijah is an uncompromising
[1:01:14] Spirit he rebuked him to their face I
[1:01:18] like it I love his boldness God let us
[1:01:19] be
[1:01:21] bold
[1:01:22] amen and uh so then God said I want you
[1:01:25] to get up here to the brook of
[1:01:27] cedra all of a sudden the curse the
[1:01:30] famine began to people begin to wield
[1:01:33] away cattle begin to thin grass begin to
[1:01:36] thin the ground become parched right the
[1:01:39] rivers begin to dry up at the word of
[1:01:41] Elijah amen Skies turned to Brass people
[1:01:45] begin to the old begin to die off amen
[1:01:48] then the young began to die off no water
[1:01:50] in the land and it's a lot like today no
[1:01:53] Revival in the
[1:01:55] and the prophet said it in 1956 that the
[1:01:58] Revival was
[1:02:00] over have you ever thought of that the
[1:02:02] angel told brother Brandon you will
[1:02:04] start a Revival around the world Amen
[1:02:07] and in 1956 he says thus say the Lord
[1:02:11] and the Revival stops it is exactly like
[1:02:13] Elijah who shut the heavens
[1:02:17] off the Revival began and ended at his
[1:02:22] word hallelujah
[1:02:25] and now the churches are drying up
[1:02:27] there'll be a famine in the last days
[1:02:30] not for bread or water but for hearing
[1:02:32] the word of God we are a blessed people
[1:02:35] because God has called us to the SE and
[1:02:38] while the world is starving God is
[1:02:41] sending
[1:02:45] bir
[1:02:47] from drinken from the Fountain of Life
[1:02:51] this brother said is the type of the
[1:02:53] secret place
[1:02:55] while the world is God has given you a
[1:02:58] brook of SE where we can drink from the
[1:03:01] Waters of life where the holy spirit
[1:03:03] will drop sandwiches to us we can praise
[1:03:06] God and thank him for the revelations
[1:03:08] that
[1:03:11] he this is like
[1:03:13] heaven
[1:03:15] you so she wanted to stop this kind of
[1:03:18] preaching you believe that yes sir
[1:03:21] believe it's closed so then AA was the
[1:03:24] daughter of Jezebel just like the Harlot
[1:03:27] has daughters that's right right and
[1:03:30] Aila stay with me she married jehoram
[1:03:32] that's right and
[1:03:34] jehoram was uh in his Reign he murdered
[1:03:39] his six younger brothers no doubt aalila
[1:03:42] her mom was a murderer she no doubt
[1:03:44] helped instigate it amen and so then
[1:03:47] jehoram died a very horrible
[1:03:51] death and the Bible said he departed
[1:03:54] with without being desired and he was
[1:03:57] afflicted with a frightful disease of
[1:03:58] the bows and when he died he died
[1:04:01] without honor and uh they just buried
[1:04:03] him so jehoram son AI reigned in his
[1:04:08] dead for one year and A Hai was killed
[1:04:11] by J because ju was bringing judgment
[1:04:15] upon the house of Ahab and aalila Rose
[1:04:18] up because she seen her opportunity to
[1:04:21] take the throne and she began to destroy
[1:04:24] all of the Royal Sea and aala killed her
[1:04:28] own
[1:04:30] grandchildren grandchild she was trying
[1:04:33] to cut off the House of David but God
[1:04:37] said the Messiah would come out the
[1:04:39] house of D and God had to preserve a
[1:04:44] seed she fulfill what she desired Satan
[1:04:48] was trying to cut off the Royal lineage
[1:04:50] that's right so right out of that
[1:04:52] lineage a Woman by the name
[1:04:56] of was the daughter of jeor she rose up
[1:05:00] and takes joash into her buos and she
[1:05:03] runs to the house of the Lord and hides
[1:05:05] there for six
[1:05:08] years it's
[1:05:10] amazing would never think of going to
[1:05:12] the house of God Amen so quite the devil
[1:05:16] hates these kind of Mee let me tell you
[1:05:18] the devil hates this kind of preacher
[1:05:21] hates this kind of worship God is
[1:05:23] preserving the see they hid him there
[1:05:26] for many years ain't that right he was
[1:05:31] wonderfully preserved by one of joram's
[1:05:34] daughters that's right God had put
[1:05:36] something in her heart to take care of
[1:05:38] that little boy she risked her own
[1:05:41] life jash was like a brand plucked it
[1:05:45] was like God put his hand upon this
[1:05:47] young man and said I'm going to preserve
[1:05:50] you yes amen how he how honored he must
[1:05:53] have felt while other cousins and
[1:05:55] siblings were dying God's hand was upon
[1:05:58] this young man you love the Lord where
[1:06:01] did she hiding she hid him in the house
[1:06:04] of the Lord I wonder if this was not a
[1:06:07] compound prophecy of Psalms
[1:06:11] 27 he said he said in the secret of his
[1:06:15] Tabernacle he shall hide me one thing
[1:06:18] have I desired of the Lord that I will
[1:06:20] seek that I might D in the house of Lord
[1:06:25] all the days of my life he will hide me
[1:06:29] in his Pavilion in the secret of
[1:06:35] his
[1:06:37] Lord sometimes God will do these things
[1:06:40] he will hide the people maybe in a
[1:06:42] catacomb or some far off place in a
[1:06:45] little church like this or little house
[1:06:47] leing while God was trying to destroy
[1:06:50] the real sea God was preserving one
[1:06:54] because God had prophesied Messiah would
[1:06:57] come out of the lineage of David and he
[1:06:59] would establish the Throne of David
[1:07:01] forever and nothing will defeat the
[1:07:04] purpose of almighty God God had purposed
[1:07:07] it God had spoke it amen and so he's
[1:07:11] hidden yes sir amen life goes on Amen
[1:07:14] after's having her parties and thought
[1:07:16] she wiped her M she has no idea what's
[1:07:20] happening in the house of God
[1:07:25] she bed all the Bibles she had turned
[1:07:28] all churches to denomination she thought
[1:07:30] they were all Mark at the Beast a little
[1:07:33] bit she know somewhere was a little
[1:07:35] group that God had his hand on and the
[1:07:39] seventh Year all of a sudden they feel
[1:07:42] inspired it's time to reveal the
[1:07:45] king and they
[1:07:47] revealed the king God had preserved one
[1:07:51] after seven years right love the Lord
[1:07:55] see where I'm going you to be a happy

[1:08:11] completely interesting about hmon now I
[1:08:13] don't know if this is acced but it's
[1:08:15] interesting according to history God had
[1:08:17] told Joshua to kill all of the
[1:08:19] amalekites a matter of fact he had told
[1:08:21] Saul to do it Saul failed to do it so an
[1:08:24] Amite killed Saul how many remember that
[1:08:27] and so the very thing he was Rose up to
[1:08:29] destroy when he didn't do it end up
[1:08:31] destroying him yes and did you know that
[1:08:34] we find in uh in the book of of uh
[1:08:38] Esther that that H was an
[1:08:41] Amite yes he was and he Desir side the
[1:08:45] entire Jewish race yes sir and what have

[1:08:58] [Applause]
[1:08:59] Hallelujah her in the king chamber and
[1:09:02] the devil knew nothing about Hallelujah
[1:09:06] and hmon thought that he was to be
[1:09:08] promoted had a great idea and the Kings
[1:09:12] agreeing and little did he know that
[1:09:14] there was a royal power revealed right
[1:09:17] here such a time as thisen and when she
[1:09:20] spoke it turned the course yeah of
[1:09:26] history at the king
[1:09:32] signature speak to the
[1:09:35] darkness the Lord
[1:09:38] hallelujah Lo yes sir seed of the woman
[1:09:43] arose out of a little virgin out of a
[1:09:46] little peasant
[1:09:47] couple comes the Messiah right from the
[1:09:51] lineage of David exactly right from the
[1:09:54] lineage of Abraham right God preserved
[1:09:57] those blood streams because out of there
[1:09:58] would come a deliverer amen Satan was
[1:10:01] trying to but he couldn't do it many
[1:10:04] times they wanted to thrust him off a
[1:10:06] mountain and he would disappear
[1:10:09] Hallelujah many times they had sought to
[1:10:11] catch him in his words and they just
[1:10:13] couldn't catch him because God had a
[1:10:14] season amen when God said it was time he
[1:10:17] said now it's the time he took the
[1:10:18] Stinger of death on the inside and he
[1:10:21] took it for us all amen right aren't you
[1:10:24] grateful when he rose from the
[1:10:27] dead he uh he revealed to the disciples
[1:10:31] that he was the resurrection and the
[1:10:33] life and the power of God fell upon
[1:10:35] those disciples and they were never the
[1:10:39] same and he told them the world hated me
[1:10:42] and the world will hate you yeah and the
[1:10:45] apostles found the word of life and they
[1:10:48] went giving in before Pentecost but
[1:10:51] after every one of them began giving
[1:10:53] their lives and martyring because they
[1:10:55] found life let me tell you if you ever
[1:10:58] see this message you will see Jesus
[1:11:01] Christ if you ever really see life
[1:11:04] eternal and so one day is this okay my
[1:11:08] word one day Jesus is walking and he
[1:11:12] Reveals His plan to Peter he said Peter
[1:11:15] when you were young you walked with yes
[1:11:17] but when you grow older another shall G
[1:11:19] thee and thou will walk with thou
[1:11:20] wouldest not and Peter you know always
[1:11:23] quick at the trigger what about him Lord
[1:11:26] what about
[1:11:27] him he said what's that to
[1:11:30] you
[1:11:33] Ione of your
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:38] bus John's gonna see the coming of the
[1:11:41] Lord yeah and but Jesus never said that
[1:11:44] Jesus was referring to the Book of
[1:11:45] Revelation amen yeah he would see the
[1:11:48] Lord's yes yes so one day they catch him
[1:11:51] and they said are you one of those that
[1:11:53] you know you don't go to the message
[1:11:54] churches he said I am all of his friends
[1:11:58] are dying now he's he's he was young
[1:12:00] with the Lord and now he's aged and and
[1:12:02] he said uh I am proudly a message
[1:12:05] believer yeah so they stuck him in a pot
[1:12:07] of oil and they begin to boil oil and I
[1:12:11] would would have liked to seen John's
[1:12:15] face oh this is
[1:12:18] nice yeah I'm not making life yeah
[1:12:24] put more put more wood on the
[1:12:26] fire this is
[1:12:28] wonderful I haven't had a bath like this
[1:12:30] in a long time I needed
[1:12:33] it and so they said this man's a witch
[1:12:36] he's a witch he's a witch so they
[1:12:37] banished him to the Ale of
[1:12:39] petas now
[1:12:41] notice God preserved John and all of a
[1:12:44] sudden John breaks into vision and he to
[1:12:47] run let me tell you the vision was not
[1:12:49] for the first church the vision was not
[1:12:52] for the dark
[1:12:54] the vision was for this people that I
[1:12:57] stand that God was going to reveal the
[1:13:00] whole revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:13:02] John was preserved for our
[1:13:05] sake
[1:13:07] Hallelujah and God will preserve you for
[1:13:10] his
[1:13:11] sake wonderful so one by one the war was
[1:13:15] initiated and the disciples begin to
[1:13:18] fight for truth all the way down to the
[1:13:21] ages and the word will bring the enemy
[1:13:24] coming in like a flood amen you believe
[1:13:26] that you bring the name of Jesus the
[1:13:29] enemy will come in like a flood you
[1:13:31] start proclaiming the word and its
[1:13:33] Purity and the devil will come in like a
[1:13:35] flood amen and men when they got in
[1:13:38] contact with the Lord could no longer be
[1:13:40] the same and immediately there was a
[1:13:43] persecution that was turned loose
[1:13:45] immediately let me tell you faith is not
[1:13:48] something that you manufacture faith is
[1:13:50] something that comes from God Amen faith
[1:13:53] is and Revelation is the same and
[1:13:56] Revelation is not something mysterious
[1:13:58] it's simply being able to see what God
[1:14:00] has done that's what a revelation is
[1:14:03] it's like a light it's it's God reveal
[1:14:06] so I'm not you know got my own private
[1:14:08] Revelation but I look at the message and
[1:14:10] people say false prophet I say that's
[1:14:11] God and that was revealed from Heaven
[1:14:13] that was God and that's the same for you
[1:14:16] it's simple can you say amen and so all
[1:14:20] the devils in Hell could not shake it
[1:14:22] from those disciples they beat it out of
[1:14:24] them they tried to starve it out of them
[1:14:26] they tried to boil it out of them
[1:14:28] torture it out of them scare it out of
[1:14:30] them but they were preserved in Christ I
[1:14:34] love it because it was in that first age
[1:14:36] brother random said every time a trumpet
[1:14:37] sounds it causes
[1:14:41] disturbance and so the gospel trumpet
[1:14:43] being was
[1:14:45] sounded and there was a was upset about
[1:14:47] it oh yeah war war commenced you believe
[1:14:51] that amen it was declaring fre freedom
[1:14:53] to
[1:14:54] mankind yes it was declaring war with
[1:14:57] the children of Satan you love the Lord
[1:15:01] Brother R said how the believer survived
[1:15:04] the battle of Faith was a miracle he
[1:15:06] said because they tried to stomp him out
[1:15:08] smash them out they did everything they
[1:15:10] could to stop it and so as the church
[1:15:13] began to move into the Dark Ages we seen
[1:15:16] the spirit of Jezebel rise up we see in
[1:15:19] the Bible thou sufferest that woman
[1:15:21] Jezebel to teach and seduce my Serv
[1:15:24] right so the spirit of Jezebel Rose back
[1:15:26] up to attack the message just like it
[1:15:29] always did and those Martyrs went to
[1:15:31] Martyr without blinking an eye yeah and
[1:15:34] if you read the fox's book of Martyrs
[1:15:37] they were smashed they were they were
[1:15:39] destroyed and there would be a Catholic
[1:15:41] priest and his wearing his dress like
[1:15:43] they do he would take a he' take a a
[1:15:47] crucifix they put a mule on this end and
[1:15:49] a mule on this man and they'd say kiss
[1:15:51] the crucifix or you'll be
[1:15:54] apart those men would stand there and
[1:15:56] say Give Me Jesus amen and they would
[1:15:59] start pulling them apart and they would
[1:16:00] pull those people apart but they would
[1:16:02] not bow amen that was more than just a
[1:16:05] little head knowledge that was a
[1:16:07] revelation that
[1:16:10] came and Satan began to destroy but you
[1:16:13] know Satan It's never enough he killed
[1:16:16] one to kill another and kill children
[1:16:18] and kill women pregnant women and would
[1:16:20] pull them apart and put them in Barrel
[1:16:23] and set them on fire begin to fet them
[1:16:26] alive and stick coals in their mouths
[1:16:28] and it's just I mean it's almost too
[1:16:30] much I I read about 450 pages of the
[1:16:33] fox's book of Martyrs I said it's
[1:16:38] enough those Martyrs stood there in the
[1:16:41] catacombs the dark caves underneath the
[1:16:43] Earth they were singing down there why
[1:16:45] were they doing it because they feel the
[1:16:47] same love for God that you feel here
[1:16:49] tonight come on you believe that yes
[1:16:53] they would write things on the wall and
[1:16:55] they would risk their lives even in the
[1:16:57] hottest
[1:16:58] persecution we find that that it only
[1:17:01] caused the flame to grow only grew
[1:17:04] brother Ram said when peace would come
[1:17:06] in through the ages you would see peace
[1:17:08] and persecution peace and persecution
[1:17:11] when peace come in it would set the
[1:17:13] church back yes sir it's exactly right
[1:17:15] sir every time in the scriptures
[1:17:17] persecution caused the church to
[1:17:21] flourish we don't realize the value of
[1:17:24] this word yes sir let him try to take it
[1:17:26] from you put you in bondage but it comes
[1:17:29] down to it God is all that matters you
[1:17:32] can have all the big screen televisions
[1:17:34] and entertainments and everything the
[1:17:36] government can offer but when it comes
[1:17:39] down to the end of the road we're gonna
[1:17:40] want something
[1:17:42] real we want something that has life in
[1:17:46] you believe that they endured
[1:17:50] 1,500 years of Dark Ages
[1:17:54] you believe the
[1:17:55] Lord they they every invention
[1:17:58] imaginable they crushed them they
[1:18:00] stretched them they burned them they
[1:18:02] froze them and they could not stop
[1:18:05] it and then pretty
[1:18:08] soon enough time the false Church began
[1:18:11] to grow and God said in the church ages
[1:18:13] he said uh I know your works and where
[1:18:16] you dwell even Satan's seat Satan
[1:18:19] actually set his very seat there in the
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:25] yet the over were overcoming him right
[1:18:27] on his
[1:18:28] ground blessed are they that
[1:18:31] overcome may God bless this people
[1:18:33] tonight yes then the church went down
[1:18:35] into the Dark
[1:18:37] Ages which was called The Very depths of
[1:18:39] Satan how many remember that in the Book
[1:18:42] of
[1:18:43] Revelation church and state had United
[1:18:46] and they went through a thousand years
[1:18:48] of total darkness which is the depths of
[1:18:50] Satan and the nominal Church would kill
[1:18:53] anything that disagreed with do you love
[1:18:56] the Lord amen down through the Dark Ages
[1:18:59] they struggled to survive and the little
[1:19:00] flock was meeting in catacombs and
[1:19:02] little places and but they were still
[1:19:05] God was preserving this little group
[1:19:06] down to the ages and every age there was
[1:19:08] a holy ghost a holy ghost filled group
[1:19:11] amen every age there was a group that
[1:19:13] loved God and stood for his word and
[1:19:15] which is true I I've read the martyrs
[1:19:18] where young people uh one man was being
[1:19:20] stretched and he started screaming and
[1:19:22] recaning and a and a 17-year-old girl
[1:19:24] said you miserable wretch that you would
[1:19:27] give up for a few moments of pleasure a
[1:19:29] life eternal and she took his Marty yeah
[1:19:33] I've seen where young children where
[1:19:35] they would say denounce the Oneness of
[1:19:37] God and he said we children have learned
[1:19:39] from the breast of our mothers there's
[1:19:41] but one God Amen and he said you little
[1:19:43] villain and he began to torture the
[1:19:45] child and the mother when he asked for
[1:19:47] what rebuked him and said think of the
[1:19:49] children of Bethlehem that were
[1:19:50] slaughtered and the children and the and
[1:19:53] that little boy smiled at his
[1:19:55] mother I tell you God's hand was a
[1:19:58] PP
[1:20:00] amen the Lord let me tell you this holy
[1:20:04] ghost is
[1:20:05] real they went into the darkest hour and
[1:20:08] the great was drunk violently with
[1:20:11] the blood of the Martyr she became
[1:20:13] intoxicated with the blood of the Martyr
[1:20:16] she couldn't get enough she took
[1:20:19] pleasure in killing the the Christians
[1:20:21] and so on and so forth and everyone that
[1:20:23] become a Catholic were Body Spirit and
[1:20:25] soul
[1:20:29] prisoners just like they are today amen
[1:20:32] Jesus said I've come to make you free
[1:20:34] amen God good
[1:20:36] Hall they destroyed him and I and I
[1:20:39] don't want to draw it down I know we
[1:20:40] have children here but they crushed them
[1:20:43] they destroyed them they plowed through
[1:20:45] them they B bies they burn them they
[1:20:48] intimidated they burnt churches
[1:20:50] everything in their path it was like a
[1:20:51] steamroller just to it liveed to kill
[1:20:54] real
[1:20:56] Christians you would think it could have
[1:20:58] never survived Satan's machine Jesus you
[1:21:02] thought they never survive 1500 years
[1:21:05] church and state annihilate anything
[1:21:08] I've been to those places to the torture
[1:21:10] chambers it's
[1:21:13] unreal the castles where and you look
[1:21:15] and you think men were praying and here
[1:21:18] God have mercy God have mercy and Jesus
[1:21:20] said that he said that uh they died in
[1:21:23] faith amen right amen praise the Lord
[1:21:27] you love the Lord
[1:21:29] amen after a thousand
[1:21:32] years they took such control and Domin
[1:21:35] great Steeples they look like uh you
[1:21:37] know when you go into in the early days
[1:21:40] you would go into a city like
[1:21:44] Williamsburg and you might walk into the
[1:21:47] courtyard and then walk into the first
[1:21:50] room of of the court and you would see
[1:21:52] arms hanging up and the idea was to all
[1:21:55] you of their power they would have guns
[1:21:58] and they would use those guns to go out
[1:22:00] and fight if they had to but they want
[1:22:02] you to walk in and look at these
[1:22:04] buildings dear God I want to mess with
[1:22:06] this group the Catholic Church did the
[1:22:08] same they made huge Steeples that
[1:22:11] towered over the people to make you feel
[1:22:13] like a r and if you dare resist us we
[1:22:16] will crush you I've been in those
[1:22:19] countries and brouge and different
[1:22:21] places where they just destroyed
[1:22:24] Christians and after all of that
[1:22:26] everyone is silent no one making a move
[1:22:28] no one and I imagine the Satan just in
[1:22:31] the bowels of Hell holding his belly
[1:22:34] laughing like an
[1:22:35] idiot and all of a sudden Martin Luther
[1:22:39] is doing
[1:22:40] pentant and all of a sudden a revelation
[1:22:43] come from
[1:22:50] heaven but Wasing it was contagious
[1:22:53] because it came from God the just shall
[1:22:56] live by faith the just shall live by
[1:22:58] faith all the way from Rome back to
[1:23:02] Germany the live
[1:23:05] byth he walk he opens up a scripture
[1:23:08] begins to preach the just shall live by
[1:23:11] faith and it move from him to
[1:23:14] them the just shall live by faith and
[1:23:16] they begin sh and raising their hand
[1:23:18] what am I saying the seed went in the
[1:23:21] ground thought that it was
[1:23:25] dead after a thousand years life was in
[1:23:28] the SE come
[1:23:31] back and begin to shine a bright
[1:23:36] light but it wasn't enough just to share
[1:23:38] it with the loc God said nail it on the
[1:23:41] door of the of the whittenberg church
[1:23:44] and so he began to write 97 thesis or 95
[1:23:48] thesis then he finds himself what are
[1:23:51] you doing I'm March right to the
[1:23:55] doores that 95 thesis he puts it on the
[1:23:59] wall and he begins to nail it he's
[1:24:01] anointed to do it history said that it
[1:24:04] was almost like Angels pour the message
[1:24:07] into every corner of the Earth because
[1:24:11] he was anointed to call a whole church
[1:24:15] out of the
[1:24:17] dark preser his
[1:24:19] SE can you say Amen out raised a mighty
[1:24:24] church and the devil fell right off his
[1:24:26] lawn
[1:24:28] chair raised up demons and said go back
[1:24:32] let's recruit let's reather ourselves
[1:24:34] and they did yes sir and and uh I I
[1:24:37] don't want to go deep into the histories
[1:24:39] but you'll find out that Satan had
[1:24:41] actually brought that church right back
[1:24:43] into denominationalism through aalila
[1:24:46] the daughter the daughter harlots you
[1:24:48] believe that and so life broke forth it
[1:24:51] started the reformation and one man in
[1:24:55] the hands of God turned the world
[1:24:58] around God could use you
[1:25:00] tonight his word has life amen you
[1:25:03] believe that amen so Warriors rose up in
[1:25:06] Luther's age you know what I
[1:25:09] love uh it was David that was anointed
[1:25:13] king but those that supported him became
[1:25:15] anointed too oh yeah oh yeah there's no
[1:25:18] way that a man can kill lions like that
[1:25:21] and kill 800 men with a spear but they
[1:25:25] were anointed once they supported the
[1:25:27] man of
[1:25:28] God and I believe Luther was the
[1:25:31] messenger to the age when God rose up
[1:25:33] Warriors that said I'll stand for that
[1:25:35] word like Luther and they begin to hold
[1:25:37] up his hands let me tell you brother
[1:25:39] brandom is the messenger but God has
[1:25:41] raised
[1:25:42] Warriors that are anointed by the same
[1:25:45] [Applause]
[1:25:47] Eagle believe that thank God for Real
[1:25:50] Men of God like your pastor
[1:25:52] that preach the word of God without
[1:25:55] compromise to preach the word of God in
[1:25:57] its Purity it will produce a Rapture it
[1:26:01] will save our children you believe
[1:26:04] that Aila rose up to strangle the true
[1:26:07] seed and bring it back to organization
[1:26:10] and there were men that were not uh
[1:26:12] angels of the church age but they were
[1:26:14] anointed men like William tendale yeah
[1:26:17] William tendale gets a burd and said no
[1:26:19] no this don't need to be in the church
[1:26:22] this word needs to get to the
[1:26:24] people and he speaks seven different
[1:26:27] languages a brilliant man and he said by
[1:26:29] the help of God I could actually get the
[1:26:32] Bible to the people amen Tindale he
[1:26:34] became just consumed with get the Bible
[1:26:37] to the people get the Bible to the
[1:26:39] people you say oh that was the old you
[1:26:41] realize Murphy Wong just translated the
[1:26:44] Chinese Bible in the Chinese and it is
[1:26:46] the best Bible in China wow he has spent
[1:26:49] years working on it he just finished it
[1:26:52] we are living in the Bible days and God
[1:26:55] anointed mer you believe
[1:26:58] that I like it John Fox describes an
[1:27:01] argument uh with with tendale against
[1:27:04] the clergyman and the the clergyman said
[1:27:06] we better be without God's laws than the
[1:27:09] popes tindel responded I defy the pope
[1:27:12] and all his laws and if God spares my
[1:27:15] life these many years I'll cause the boy
[1:27:18] that drives the P to know more
[1:27:20] scriptures than you do ah did he
[1:27:24] ever T was brought to execution he gave
[1:27:27] his life he translated the Bible into
[1:27:30] English he went he went to the uh uh
[1:27:35] execution he was convicted of heresy so
[1:27:39] they were going to strangle him and burn
[1:27:40] his body at the stake and in his dying
[1:27:43] request he screamed as he was at the
[1:27:45] stake Lord open the king of England's
[1:27:49] eyes two years later God did just what
[1:27:52] he
[1:27:54] pray the majority of the King James
[1:27:56] Bible was written by
[1:27:58] tnd and so tale's work was not in vain
[1:28:02] your labor in the Lord is not in vain
[1:28:05] and so we're enjoying tale's
[1:28:07] worken ain't that
[1:28:09] wonderful and so God had preserved it
[1:28:14] then there was John Wesley I don't want
[1:28:16] am I holding you too long I just love
[1:28:18] these things amen John Wesley you know
[1:28:20] was raised in Godly star yeah his daddy
[1:28:22] was a preacher his mother was Godly
[1:28:24] prayed over it and when John Wesley was
[1:28:27] just six years old he got stranded in an
[1:28:29] upper floor and the building was on fire
[1:28:32] and a couple men went up against the
[1:28:35] window they pulled John Wesley out and
[1:28:38] saved his life before the house
[1:28:40] collapsed and he always called himself a
[1:28:42] brand plucked from the fire but you know
[1:28:44] we know more than history does Amen
[1:28:47] because we realized that God had a
[1:28:48] Divine Purpose in West and that God had
[1:28:52] to preserve Wesley in order to turn the
[1:28:54] course of the world in his age and to
[1:28:58] restore the uh the truth of
[1:29:01] sanctification he was seconds away from
[1:29:04] death and God came and preserved his
[1:29:08] life John Wesley made a stand against
[1:29:11] the Anglican Church that didn't even
[1:29:13] believe in
[1:29:14] revivals and I love his story because uh
[1:29:17] can I go just a little
[1:29:19] bit John Westley you know was preaching
[1:29:23] in the Church of England he was really
[1:29:24] disheartened and he gets a born again
[1:29:26] experience in a Moravian meeting uh as
[1:29:29] they were reading uh the letters of uh
[1:29:32] um Martin Luther I think it was Romans 8
[1:29:34] or nine N I believe it was and he was
[1:29:36] sitting there listening and his heart
[1:29:38] was strangely warmed and so he begins to
[1:29:40] preach having a per personal experience
[1:29:43] with God and the English the Church of
[1:29:47] England said absolutely not that kind of
[1:29:48] preaching in this Pulpit so George
[1:29:50] Whitefield said uh will you come out
[1:29:52] here and so John Wesley comes out to see
[1:29:54] what George Whitfield is doing George
[1:29:57] Whitfield was banned from the churches
[1:29:59] as well so he started preaching in the
[1:30:01] open air George Whitefield was a mighty
[1:30:05] preacher he was able I believe it was
[1:30:07] Benjamin Franklin that said he
[1:30:09] calculated that he could preach to
[1:30:10] 30,000 people and with with no
[1:30:14] amplification just in the open air he
[1:30:17] could reach 30,000 people man preached
[1:30:19] come out of organization and love God
[1:30:22] and have a personal experience they were
[1:30:24] in the brickyards and in the coal mines
[1:30:27] and these people would die in the 30s
[1:30:30] and 40s they had no hope they lived in
[1:30:32] there that was the only way to live
[1:30:34] there was no other life and they lived
[1:30:35] like moles and rats they went out into
[1:30:37] these clay yards and brick yards and he
[1:30:40] began to preach and attract thousands
[1:30:43] wow but George Whitefield had to come
[1:30:46] over the United States so he asked he
[1:30:48] asked Wesley come and help me and and
[1:30:51] and the rest of the story is George
[1:30:53] Whitefield came to America and the
[1:30:55] Second Great Awakening took place or the
[1:30:57] first Great Awakening took place at that
[1:30:59] time Wesley come and he was appalled at
[1:31:03] this how can you preach like this to
[1:31:05] this people but when he saw the results
[1:31:08] he said well I'll try it so one morning
[1:31:11] he come out in his his robes and he's
[1:31:14] walking through the mud and God is
[1:31:16] humbling and he began to preach and the
[1:31:18] response was absolutely incredible these
[1:31:21] people could never walked into a church
[1:31:23] but God took the word to
[1:31:25] them Hallelujah Hallelujah by the end of
[1:31:28] the day he preached the 7,000 people he
[1:31:31] was converted and from that point on he
[1:31:33] began to preach everywhere in the hay
[1:31:35] markets and in the
[1:31:37] fields and the whole world become his F
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:43] aren don't you love the Lord I love
[1:31:46] those histories I think it's wonderful
[1:31:48] can I go a little
[1:31:49] further so Satan had also brought them
[1:31:52] into denomination as well trying to cut
[1:31:55] off the program of God like Satan always
[1:31:58] does now we're in the most deceptive age
[1:32:00] of all ages I'll just hold you a little
[1:32:04] longer we know brother ROM's story that
[1:32:07] five minutes after his birth they opened
[1:32:09] a widow window and a pillar of fire come
[1:32:11] over because God had a purpose for his
[1:32:14] life brother BR was just a small boy he
[1:32:17] uh his mom was four months pregnant he
[1:32:19] was a baby nursing baby and uh Charles
[1:32:23] went off logging in a horrible winter
[1:32:25] storm had come in and uh El was working
[1:32:30] throwing wood into the fire pretty soon
[1:32:33] she run out of wood and she couldn't go
[1:32:34] out they run out of food she became weak
[1:32:37] so she wrapped her and her baby in
[1:32:40] blankets and just was laying there and
[1:32:42] was dying the fire went out they were
[1:32:44] freezing to death and it was just before
[1:32:47] they died an old neighbor walked outside
[1:32:49] after the blizzard was working and
[1:32:51] looked and he noticed no smoke was
[1:32:53] coming out of the cab oh but he knew
[1:32:56] smoke was coming out of there before the
[1:32:59] blizzard and he knew nobody could get
[1:33:00] out during the blizzard and so God now
[1:33:04] got to show his attention I wonder
[1:33:06] sometimes if we don't notice God working
[1:33:09] in our
[1:33:10] Liv And so eating at you know you could
[1:33:13] just ignore Fleet tomorrow but no he
[1:33:15] goes down there and when he saw that
[1:33:17] there were no Footprints outside the
[1:33:19] door he knew someone was in trouble amen
[1:33:21] he forced his way in and he was shocked
[1:33:24] to see this mother dying with their baby
[1:33:26] he went out and he started a fire he
[1:33:29] went and got groceries he saved their
[1:33:31] life why because God was preserving his
[1:33:35] seed because they was going to be a
[1:33:38] people that would need this message of
[1:33:40] the
[1:33:40] hour because there's going to be a mark
[1:33:43] of the beast there's going to be a
[1:33:45] tribulation and God was going to protect
[1:33:48] his
[1:33:49] people you believe that
[1:33:53] down just God was preserving his gift
[1:33:56] you know brother Brandon when he lost
[1:33:57] his wife and baby he said he was up on a
[1:34:00] pole and he looked at the wi he couldn't
[1:34:02] take it no more and said he was going to
[1:34:04] kill himself and he found himself at the
[1:34:05] bottom of the PO God was preserving the
[1:34:09] when he went home he was gonna pull the
[1:34:11] trigger in his mouth but God didn't let
[1:34:13] it happen because God was preserving his
[1:34:17] SE that right brother ROM said when
[1:34:20] those boys beat him silly he out there
[1:34:21] with a gun intending to kill every one
[1:34:23] of them but none of those bullets went
[1:34:25] off why because God was preserving this
[1:34:30] message only would have had a prison
[1:34:32] ministry he never would have got
[1:34:34] it you love the Lord AR you
[1:34:38] happy and from that man he has anointed
[1:34:42] an entire group of preachers who set
[1:34:45] fire with the flame of God who is
[1:34:47] preaching this message in its Purity
[1:34:49] from the rooftops we are going forth
[1:34:52] with the torch light of Freedom saying
[1:34:55] Let Freedom re and we are preaching you
[1:34:57] can be
[1:34:59] free God has preserved the bride the
[1:35:03] save you believe that the holy spirit is
[1:35:07] the preserver of life amen hallelujah
[1:35:10] said brother Craig I've served the Lord
