[20:29] we'll have a word of prayer let's remain
[20:31] standing here and we'll take quite a few
[20:33] prayer requests tonight there's a lot of
[20:35] needs um and as priests unto God we're
[20:38] happy to take them before the throne of
[20:39] grace knowing that God can give us help
[20:42] in this time of need
[20:44] here so let's uh read through some of
[20:48] our uh needs here
[20:51] tonight just a real quick announcement I
[20:54] sent out the text um service Saturday at
[20:56] 6: and then two on Sunday just because
[20:59] we don't see our brother uh Dennis too
[21:02] much but hopefully after this I can keep
[21:03] him
[21:04] returning he got the cheapest ticket
[21:06] I've ever seen in a long time so maybe
[21:08] that's a good sign to have him back
[21:10] again so but we're thankful for that but
[21:13] many numerous requests let's remember um
[21:15] brother uh amen said he heard brother
[21:17] Ben Rod say he's having eyesight trouble
[21:19] because of the diabetes so remember that
[21:22] situation um it's very serious so let's
[21:24] remember him also Naomi and Wesley in
[21:26] their their travel I believe is next
[21:28] Monday if I'm not mistaken so let's pray
[21:30] no Co for
[21:32] them and uh because if they get Co in
[21:35] some whatever part they have to
[21:36] quarantine for 14 days and then they got
[21:38] to pay for their own hotel so it just
[21:40] it'd be awful it'd be awful so let's
[21:42] pray for good test and then um Sound
[21:45] Health for them also Jose is still of
[21:47] course extremely uh sad because he lost
[21:51] his son in the tragic accident uh on
[21:54] Sunday and also let's remember his
[21:56] health in prayer
[21:59] but amen has requests that we can all
[22:00] grow in the Lord so I think that's a
[22:02] beautiful request by God's grace we'll
[22:04] keep feeding on the things of God like
[22:06] trees planted By the Waters we got to
[22:08] stay connected to the Holy Spirit right
[22:10] the power of God that's a great prayer
[22:12] Hallelujah also it's remember my cousin
[22:14] Adam's back I haven't heard update uh
[22:16] let's pray for David deweer the
[22:18] two-year-old boy his infections better
[22:20] he's out of intensive care but a mom
[22:22] still asked for
[22:24] prayer then we had a a child we had a
[22:27] friend uh named Eric who got in a really
[22:29] bad uh sledding
[22:32] accident uh I guess just need that I
[22:36] guess he's going to need some surgery
[22:38] I'm sorry need some stitches or
[22:39] something like that on his face so kind
[22:41] of hit something while he's sleding so
[22:42] let remembering him in
[22:45] prayer just just stitches probably or we
[22:47] don't
[22:49] know okay so lost some teeth because of
[22:52] sleding accd so let's remember that in
[22:54] prayer I'm ask God to be merciful uh
[22:57] also

[27:46] here
[27:47] tonight thank you let's go to Luke
[27:50] Chapter 5 I'd like to just preach again
[27:51] on new wine in new bottles and just
[27:54] focus on the mind tonight you know we I
[27:57] think we preach really hard really long
[27:59] on the soul right the baptism of the
[28:01] Holy Ghost that's what uh many times we
[28:04] refer it to but it has to be in the mind
[28:06] as well uh by God's grace so let's go to
[28:10] Luke Chapter 5 and we'll go to the end
[28:12] of the chapter there let's go to
[28:14] vers uh 36 Luke 536
[28:25] [Music]
[28:32] so Luke
[28:35] 5:36 why don't I read
[28:39] um I'll read 36 and 37 we can all read
[28:43] 38 and 39 so I'll read 36 and
[28:46] 37 and he spake also a parable unto them
[28:49] no man putteth a piece of a new garment
[28:51] upon an old if otherwise then both the
[28:54] new maketh a rent and the peace that was
[28:56] taken out of the new AG
[28:58] not with the old and no man putteth new
[29:02] wine into Old bottles else I'm sorry
[29:05] yeah I'm sorry I'm doing 307 my fault
[29:07] yeah and no man putteth new wine into
[29:09] Old bottles else the new wine will burst
[29:11] the bottles and be spilled and the
[29:13] bottles Shall Perish let's all read 38
[29:16] and 39 1 2 3 but new wine must be put
[29:20] into new bottles and both are preserved
[29:24] no man also having drunk old wine great
[29:28] way desireth new for he saith the old is
[29:32] better may God has blessings through
[29:33] reading his word you may be seated
[29:35] praise
[29:37] God so I just want to um I want to make
[29:40] sure I set my timer here I'll set it for
[29:42] 30 minutes then I'll maybe close after
[29:43] that for 10 minutes or something like
[29:45] that we really want to be careful uh
[29:47] make sure our brother gets good rest and
[29:48] we really appreciate brother amen and
[29:50] sister who will com in tonight we
[29:51] appreciate that uh I've never worked
[29:53] third shift so you have a lot of Courage
[29:54] but amen and I really appreciate that
[29:56] buddy so thank you for your faithfulness
[29:58] and thank you sister for all you do to
[29:59] help him out we appreciate that love you
[30:02] both so let's uh let's preach this for
[30:04] about 30 minutes or so 35 minutes and uh
[30:07] I just want to follow up more on the
[30:09] mind um uh because we know the soul uh
[30:12] is what this is the main text is talking
[30:15] about so if you look at the scripture in
[30:17] verse 36 it's a you can't put a new
[30:20] piece of garment on a old garment right
[30:24] you don't put a a new one on an old one
[30:26] right and then with 30 seven you don't
[30:28] put new wine into an old bottle now
[30:32] brother brandom us this all the time you
[30:33] can't put God's revelation into a
[30:36] denomination that's right praise God
[30:38] because we've all seen it right you try
[30:40] to put when you witness right you try to
[30:42] put a new right God sent a prophet or
[30:45] did you know there's a new way to
[30:47] baptize as far as not your old
[30:50] denomination but it's the Bible Way
[30:52] right anytime you try to put a new
[30:54] revelation into an old Stony heart it
[30:57] bursts
[30:58] right they get upset they got mad I
[31:00] remember I had such good friends brother
[31:02] the Amen in uh um campus Focus you know
[31:06] I had such good friends my they I
[31:07] thought they were my closest friends I
[31:09] thought my they were the best people in
[31:10] the world but as soon as I shared
[31:12] serpent seed with them as soon as I
[31:14] shared water baptism and God was in a
[31:16] trinity Lord right the godhead that's
[31:19] thus say the Lord to put that new wine
[31:22] of thus say the Lord to try to put it in
[31:24] an old denominational bottle it bursts
[31:27] and both are wasted right yeah and
[31:29] that's why Jesus said cast not your
[31:31] Pearls Before Swine praise God Amen so
[31:35] see you got you got to be led in other
[31:36] words you gota be led of the Holy Spirit
[31:38] to do Outreach and and witnessing right
[31:41] you gotta we have to wait for the spirit
[31:43] to guide us in those things amen praise
[31:45] God the the thing is also we should be
[31:48] constantly praying for opportunities to
[31:50] do that praise God uh you know like for
[31:52] example I had a leading of the Lord to
[31:53] write the book and I'm glad I did
[31:55] because it's helped numerous people
[31:56] praise God uh
[31:58] and I'm I'm I'm feeling LED you know in
[32:00] different areas too with with with more
[32:02] missionary work I was telling my wife I
[32:03] was telling her that amen if the Lord
[32:05] should tar I want to do different
[32:06] missionary work just like Apostle Paul
[32:09] if the Lord will T because I have a
[32:10] burden and as long as I feel led to do
[32:12] it as long as we feel led to do it then
[32:15] we should pursue it and ask God to bless
[32:17] it praise God because we feel it's his
[32:19] leading to do it praise God right
[32:21] because if we didn't if we had our
[32:23] leading we would probably be lazy right
[32:25] and I can say Amen I'd probably be lazy
[32:27] amen
[32:28] I or i' I'd probably be selfish right or
[32:31] I we'd probably choose the easy way
[32:33] right because that's Humanity because
[32:35] that's what denominations many times do
[32:37] right uh because you try to put because
[32:40] when you try to put a new a new idea a
[32:42] new inspired thought in there if if they
[32:45] won't adjust if they won't adapt to that
[32:46] and have a new heart it'll burst right
[32:49] it'll go to not okay so I just want to
[32:51] bring that first thought out that
[32:52] brother Ram us this many times with
[32:54] denomination you can't put a new piece
[32:56] of cloth a new revelation
[32:58] into an old Creed praise God it'll burst
[33:00] it all up right and you can't put the
[33:03] Holy Ghost message in a denomination
[33:05] it'll burst praise God it won't it won't
[33:08] work right it'll people will get upset
[33:10] uh it'll it'll ruin it everything will
[33:12] be ruined so you've got to put God's
[33:14] word God's new word in a new heart
[33:17] praise God and that's what Ezekiel said
[33:19] I'll give you a new heart and a new
[33:21] spirit and my spirit praise God do you
[33:24] remember what your old heart was like
[33:25] you'd argue against everything you oh
[33:27] this can't be right no way this can't be
[33:29] right and you didn't you know maybe you
[33:31] didn't you fought against God's
[33:33] revelation for a while praise God I know
[33:34] there's a couple times I I flip-flopped
[33:36] you know after I heard it I believed it
[33:38] for a while then I had a couple hard
[33:39] days a couple hard weeks where I'd
[33:41] flip-flop and I remember you bringing an
[33:43] arguments against it right uh because
[33:46] you can't you can't put a new thought in
[33:48] in a in an old heart it has to be a
[33:50] heart that feels fresh a heart that's
[33:52] full of Faith that's the kind of heart
[33:54] god pours out his holy spirit into
[33:56] praise God a heart that on fire a heart
[33:58] that loves God a heart that's open to
[34:01] more Revelation praise God that's who
[34:04] God pours it into praise God now I want
[34:06] to uh just Define wine real quick wine
[34:09] of course is alcoholic fermented juice
[34:11] of fresh grapes like
[34:13] beverage and it's it's also fermented
[34:16] juice of a plant product uh such as a
[34:19] fruit and it's something that
[34:22] invigorates or
[34:24] intoxicates right so wine invigorates
[34:27] people like brings it give them life
[34:29] right whereas they didn't seem very
[34:31] living
[34:32] beforehand but wine applied will
[34:34] invigorate someone right or it
[34:38] intoxicates now intoxicate means to
[34:41] excite or Stupify right to Stupify to
[34:44] Surprise by alcohol or a drug especially
[34:48] to the point where physical and mental
[34:51] control is markedly
[34:53] diminished praise God Amen so when
[34:57] someone isn't intoxicated they lose all
[34:59] their inhibitions they lose control of
[35:03] their old thinking and they act in a
[35:05] brand new way praise God Amen it also
[35:08] means to excite or elate to the point of
[35:11] enthusiasm or
[35:14] frenzy hallelujah praise God and church
[35:17] it's like we get a fresh drink every
[35:19] time we come to the house of God Amen so
[35:21] God's living water is actually living
[35:23] wine can I say it like that anytime you
[35:26] get re-excited or or uh you get
[35:29] stupified right or you get invigorated
[35:31] anytime you get excited or enthusiastic
[35:34] about God it's a fresh drink from Heaven
[35:37] praise God Amen and we know it's down to
[35:40] the soul right because that's what
[35:42] brother Ram says there was 120 new
[35:45] bottles that got filled with the Holy
[35:47] Ghost on the day of Pentecost but
[35:49] anybody that studies their Bible long
[35:50] enough is going to realize there was Old
[35:52] Testament characters and New Testament
[35:54] characters that got discouraged but then
[35:56] God invigorated them right they got
[36:00] maybe uh discouraged but then they got
[36:03] encouraged and so we see the same idea
[36:06] the new wine needs to also be applied to
[36:09] our minds amen amen and I had a good one
[36:12] last night uh so to you know yesterday
[36:16] we had a snow day I don't know oh that's
[36:17] right you're you're she's at home right
[36:19] she's on remote so no snow day so we had
[36:22] a snow day right and I was so excited I
[36:25] couldn't I got up early I didn't even
[36:26] try to I just got at 4:30 to study and
[36:28] pray and read my Bible and everything
[36:29] and get work well by the end of the day
[36:31] I was exhausted and I was just
[36:33] discouraged I was like I wanted to get
[36:34] this done and I can't wait till we get
[36:36] our house renovated I can't wait till I
[36:38] get this book done and I was just so
[36:39] discouraged and I was like man I just
[36:41] want all this to get over with I just
[36:43] wanted and so I walk in there and
[36:44] Lydia's playing a song and there's a a
[36:46] preacher Shane and Shane he was talking
[36:49] at a concert and he said you know God
[36:51] said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall
[36:53] want continually more and more of
[36:55] everything I thought no that's not what
[36:58] he said and he basically rebuked himself
[37:01] for wanting more Christmas presents now
[37:03] this is the singer and I thought I
[37:05] thought that's just how I'm feeling
[37:06] right now I just want now it's good
[37:09] spiritual things but I wanted to get the
[37:11] house done I wanted to get uh the book
[37:13] done I want to get the YouTube video
[37:15] done I just wanted to get everything
[37:16] done I wanted wanted wanted but in that
[37:19] moment I was convicted and humbled and I
[37:21] had to realize the Lord is my shepherd I
[37:23] shall not want I'll say it again the
[37:27] Lord is Our Shepherd we shall not what
[37:30] Amen in other words tonight Church you
[37:32] and I are not lacking anything we and I
[37:35] got to be careful too when I have my
[37:37] goals or my desires I have to be careful
[37:39] not to get caught up in too much into
[37:41] wanting them but trusting that the God
[37:43] if it's God's will God's Gonna
[37:45] accomplish it praise God Amen and at
[37:47] this moment right now I'm not lacking
[37:49] anything because God is the one who
[37:51] orders our steps praise God Amen I was
[37:55] just I was and I was so invigorated last
[37:57] night
[37:58] I was I was at first I was discouraged
[38:00] and after that I was like wow I feel so
[38:02] much better so I turned on the music I
[38:04] started singing that song the Lord is my
[38:06] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[38:08] lie down in green pastur amen and church
[38:10] the peace of God invigorated me now you
[38:12] would think on a day off beatress I'd be
[38:14] so happy but you see how the devil works
[38:16] on me I get discouraged like oh you
[38:18] didn't get this and this is still not
[38:20] done and I get discouraged that way but
[38:22] I love how the peace of God passes all
[38:25] understanding amen and God's able to to
[38:28] meet our need and instead of me being
[38:30] discouraged God's able to encourage me
[38:33] right and God is able to show me that I
[38:34] have everything I need now think about
[38:36] this not only do we have everything we
[38:38] need naturally but in heaven we're
[38:40] already perfect amen you're already
[38:44] forgiven praise God you've already got a
[38:46] theop body that's Eternal in the heavens
[38:49] praise God you've already got an eternal
[38:51] home even if you left this home you got
[38:53] an eternal body waiting there for you
[38:56] praise God Amen
[38:57] of theany praise God you got to worry
[39:00] about the future right our future is
[39:02] already settled we got an eternal home a
[39:05] tabernacle that cannot end praise God
[39:08] we've got Eternal possession Eternal
[39:11] inheritance waiting for us in Heaven by
[39:13] the blood of Christ amen oh my and so I
[39:17] just you know it was kind of quickened
[39:19] to me yesterday like wow how often do we
[39:22] need new wine for our minds we need a
[39:25] freshh thought that was such a frh fresh
[39:27] thought I had not thought about it's
[39:29] Psalms 23 right I not thought about
[39:31] Psalms 23 for months and months and
[39:32] months all of a sudden I love how the
[39:35] faithful God brings you a word in due
[39:37] season so thank you L for playing that I
[39:39] don't know if I thanked you yesterday
[39:41] that really encouraged me I thought wow
[39:42] I don't I don't lack anything Devil's
[39:44] trying to discourage me oh you didn't
[39:45] get this done and all that but really I
[39:47] don't lack anything because I've got
[39:49] Jesus and church if I've got Jesus I've
[39:52] got everything praise God Amen now
[39:56] getting back here so you see what uh
[39:58] wine and intoxication means you lose the
[40:02] inhibitions right and we're going to
[40:04] focus on the spirit man because the soul
[40:07] is it's a one time only it's a one time
[40:09] only baptized with the Holy Ghost he
[40:11] never says you're re-baptized that's not
[40:12] even a word using the King James there's
[40:15] no such thing as a rebaptism right so
[40:17] your soul is sealed and then the Bible
[40:19] said you don't sin your your soul can't
[40:21] even sin right and Paul said it's I'm
[40:24] not the one that sins it's the sin that
[40:27] dwells within my body praise God and so
[40:29] I want to just look at the mind and just
[40:31] reiterate a few things about the mind
[40:34] now brother BR says brother BR says wine
[40:35] is stimulation he says shouts
[40:40] Joys shout and joy he calls it wine
[40:43] praise God and he said while he's
[40:45] preaching he said I can hear it right
[40:47] now right and so if people weren't born
[40:50] again right when he was preaching it
[40:51] then that means their minds were getting
[40:53] new wi right many of those people that
[40:56] were saying amen and were probably
[40:58] already born again in their soul in
[40:59] other words they already had the wine in
[41:01] the soul but they needed some wine in
[41:03] their minds amen amen that's right
[41:06] praise God that's why I keep going back
[41:08] to church all these years because I get
[41:10] filled up on wine all the time I get a
[41:12] fresh
[41:14] drink Glory praise God you would do
[41:16] right we do too that's why you come back
[41:18] praise God Amen because it's wine it's
[41:20] Joy it's it's fresh power amen it's wine
[41:23] ferments right and it bring it brings
[41:25] more power it gets more potent all the
[41:28] time I remember there's numerous times
[41:30] when we were growing up in Kyo Falls and
[41:31] Lydia and Malachi we used to buy apple
[41:33] juice right well sometimes apple juice
[41:35] would sit around and get kind of
[41:36] fermented I don't know if my wife
[41:38] remembers this or not so I'd pull out
[41:40] some of the apple juice and go to drink
[41:42] it kind of smells like it's wine right
[41:45] or grape juice ever had that I know what
[41:47] happened in college and maybe I'm mixing
[41:48] up my my early married life with my
[41:51] college life but I know in one of those
[41:53] lives that I lived the wife before the
[41:55] life before marriage and the life after
[41:57] I know in one of those lives either had
[41:59] grape juice that was fermenting and I
[42:00] drank it or apple juice that was
[42:02] fermented and I drank it and you can
[42:04] taste right away oh this is more
[42:06] powerful than the other right like when
[42:09] we have communion this is more powerful
[42:11] and so wine represents power amen
[42:14] represents power in this case not just
[42:17] in our soul because we have power in our
[42:19] soul right but then that now for us we
[42:23] need the new wine in the new mind we
[42:26] need new thought thoughts right to
[42:28] stimulate our minds so our minds don't
[42:31] break God's word we don't want to Old
[42:34] denominational mind yes we want a fresh
[42:38] Living Christian mind amen A A A Renewed
[42:42] mind the Bible calls it be renewed in
[42:44] the spirit of your mind the Bible Paul
[42:46] also calls it a transformed mind okay so
[42:50] these are the words here that we
[42:52] see now just remember the the the Mind
[42:55] recap the Bible says we must cast down
[42:58] anything that exalts itself against the
[43:00] word of God so our job is to go around
[43:03] cleaning our mind and if we see
[43:05] something that we don't like to cast it
[43:07] down right we got to go cleaning you
[43:10] know when you guys came over for
[43:11] Thanksgiving I went around with the
[43:12] broom and I G to knock down all the
[43:14] spider webs right I what I had I had to
[43:17] cast them down now sometimes I like
[43:20] those spiders you know I just I don't
[43:21] want to kill them right it's like what
[43:23] they do to me they don't hurt me they
[43:25] don't bite me you know but in the case I
[43:27] have I was having people over I had to
[43:30] pull them down and knock them down and I
[43:32] had to cast it down right in order to
[43:35] clean up in order everything look nice
[43:36] and make it look beautiful and pretty
[43:38] you have to cast down anything that
[43:41] exalts itself against the word of God
[43:43] praise God and so the Bible says you and
[43:45] I are in charge of going around our
[43:47] minds and pulling down anything that
[43:49] exalts itself against the word of God
[43:52] Amen so if you're discouraged may the
[43:54] Lord help us to pull it down TR the holy
[43:57] spirit will say when are you going to
[43:58] cast that down right and that's kind of
[44:01] what I had helped with last night so I
[44:02] thank the Lord for that when are you
[44:04] going to cast down your
[44:05] discouragement when are you gonna how
[44:07] long you going to let that uh that that
[44:09] Envy stay up there how long you let that
[44:11] jealousy how long you let that anger
[44:13] stay up there cast it down throw it down
[44:16] praise God just just get it off the
[44:17] shelf right that's the wrong thing we
[44:19] don't want on the Shelf there's good you
[44:21] can have questions on the Shelf but you
[44:23] don't want sins on the Shelf praise God
[44:25] so take it down and cast it down praise
[44:28] God that's all we got to do is just take
[44:30] it down and cast it down because
[44:31] remember the Bible said if you don't it
[44:33] will build up a strong hold or Castle in
[44:36] your
[44:37] mind and then every time you go to that
[44:40] area it's it's fighting against you
[44:41] right or it's fighting against God so
[44:44] you don't want to build that up you want
[44:45] to take it down and cast it down and
[44:47] throw it down praise God so just just
[44:51] reiterate that and I was thinking today
[44:54] Church uh when Jesus told the story
[44:57] remember he said it your mind is like a
[44:59] house he said in your house he said you
[45:02] you store and how many uh picture your
[45:04] pantry right now what do you got on
[45:05] Pantry I got I remember I got peanuts
[45:07] right here on one of the
[45:10] shelves I got pasta on this
[45:12] shelf what else I got in there oh I got
[45:15] some sauces I got some chips in there
[45:18] I'm making y'all hungry aren't I but the
[45:21] Bible says those are your goods how many
[45:22] know what I'm talking about Jesus says
[45:24] though he said you got to keep your
[45:26] house strong and you can't let somebody
[45:29] come in and take your Chips praise God
[45:32] or your
[45:33] peanuts unsalted of
[45:35] course right but Jesus says if you let
[45:39] somebody into your house they're going
[45:41] to spoil your house they're going to tie
[45:43] you up so they right they're going to
[45:45] tie up you so you can't stop them right
[45:48] they're going to discourage you or make
[45:49] you scared fearful and they're going to
[45:51] go over and take all your food right and
[45:54] spoil your house that's how Jesus Likens
[45:57] our minds unto we got to protect our
[45:59] stuff
[46:00] amen now usually I wouldn't fight over
[46:02] food but in this case we got to fight
[46:04] over the fruits of the spirit praise God
[46:06] Amen right in other words don't let
[46:08] Satan take your joy don't let Satan take
[46:11] your faith amen amen you got to be
[46:13] willing to fight for it don't let him
[46:14] spoil and Rob all of your things can you
[46:17] imagine if a stranger walked in and he
[46:19] just went over and took your peanuts and
[46:20] your chips and your salsa and just
[46:22] started eating and tied you up you
[46:24] wouldn't stand for that I mean if you
[46:27] had a bat or a broom You' start hitting
[46:28] the person right you beatric wouldn't
[46:31] let Naomi get all tied up she'd go beat
[46:33] the dude right stop you're not going to
[46:35] rob me and we should do the same thing
[46:37] to the devil cast him down don't let him
[46:39] Rob us of all of our blessings all the
[46:42] things God has given us all the things
[46:44] Jesus died for let's not let Satan steal
[46:47] them from us amen amen cast it down
[46:50] that's that's what all he says you have
[46:51] to do is cast on anything that Satan's
[46:53] trying to establish or in other words
[46:55] don't let him into your house keep them
[46:57] out and protect the good things God has
[46:59] blessed you with amen
[47:02] amen and this is what we're saying new
[47:04] wine new thoughts new fresh anointing
[47:07] inspiration in a new mind
[47:10] amen and that's what we have in our
[47:13] minds now I want to just re I just
[47:15] wanted to recap
[47:17] that now church I want to just share a
[47:19] story I meant to share on uh Sunday but
[47:22] I
[47:24] forgot because the mind is such an
[47:26] important
[47:27] thing it's it's where we fight our
[47:29] battles
[47:31] right once you're sealed with the Holy
[47:33] Ghost you are sealed to the day of
[47:34] redemption you don't have to worry about
[47:35] that anymore right you just got to feed
[47:37] it just got to feed the soul because he
[47:39] said my soul thirst is for you see the
[47:41] soul just wants more of God but the
[47:44] place we got to watch out for is our
[47:45] mind because that's the battlefield
[47:48] right but I want to share this a little
[47:50] story just two little stories real quick
[47:53] about Rejuvenation of the mind so new
[47:55] new wine in the new mind okay so I've
[47:58] known a couple pastors who had mental
[48:00] breakdowns I just want to tell a story
[48:02] of a pastor and a minister who had kind
[48:04] of like a mental breakdown okay so let
[48:06] me tell the pastor's story first a
[48:08] lovely Pastor man I I greatly admire
[48:11] well he became pastor and as you know uh
[48:14] they have a board of directors right
[48:17] like at our church It's banging me
[48:19] that's all we
[48:21] have so really I I really I can't get
[48:24] voted
[48:25] out right because there's only two votes
[48:28] well at at least got
[48:30] 50% but anyways so we might have to get
[48:33] another board member so rather pray
[48:35] about
[48:35] it because it probably shouldn't be too
[48:38] but anyways we just don't have many
[48:39] people that you know would like to
[48:41] anyways the pastor was pass him for
[48:43] years and years and then he found out on
[48:45] the board was many
[48:46] Old-Timers and some of them were deacons
[48:49] and one of the deacons wasn't even
[48:50] paying
[48:51] ties and so he knew the message oh if
[48:54] you don't pay ties you you can't serve
[48:55] in an office right like if you're
[48:58] robbing God how can you serve God at the
[49:00] house of God if you're robbing if you're
[49:02] robbing Heaven's bank
[49:05] right okay just so and just just to give
[49:08] you a background this brother was in a
[49:10] couple of brother Ram's meetings so let
[49:12] me build up the pressure the mental
[49:15] pressure that this pastor was
[49:17] under so a man who knew brother well he
[49:19] saw brother Bram I don't know if you
[49:20] ever met
[49:21] him and this was just a few years ago by
[49:24] the
[49:25] way so he had addressed that brother in
[49:28] a meeting and said you know he had all
[49:30] the deacons and Boards he said uh he
[49:33] talked to the brothers and said you know
[49:34] this guy he said you have to
[49:36] go you're not paying
[49:38] ties and so at the meeting they just
[49:40] disagreed no we disagree and so that
[49:42] brother who wasn't paying ties went out
[49:44] and told other people in the church that
[49:46] were big tithe
[49:48] payers and they started talking and they
[49:51] they were all against the pastor now
[49:53] this tells you what kind of a church
[49:55] condition that is what kind of a church
[49:57] has the Holy Ghost and will support
[49:59] people in Ministry in offices in
[50:01] leadership that can't even pay their
[50:03] tithes and yet he has a lot of
[50:06] money and then after the the Deacon went
[50:09] out told all that uh then then allthough
[50:13] there's some women in there then they
[50:15] all started putting pressure on the pre
[50:17] the pastor's wife just making comments
[50:19] here and there oh like you better not
[50:21] you better stop talking about it tell
[50:22] your husband not to put him off the
[50:24] Deacon board because remember a pastor
[50:25] has the power to do that brother man
[50:27] said a pastor can remove anybody from
[50:28] any
[50:29] office so the pressure got so built up
[50:32] over uh over months and months of this
[50:35] because then the then the you know
[50:37] pretty soon it gets out to everybody in
[50:38] the church everybody knows pretty soon
[50:40] the preacher had a mental breakdown alls
[50:42] he did for two or three days was just
[50:43] cry he couldn't even he couldn't even he
[50:46] couldn't even study couldn't even
[50:49] pray all because of the pressure oh
[50:51] these people are going to now look he
[50:52] had he had numerous kids they're they're
[50:55] paying his income he don't have any
[50:56] anywhere to
[50:57] go
[51:00] right and so he had this mental
[51:02] breakdown and yet we believe he was born
[51:06] again so three days and so you know how
[51:09] you know how he got back and got his
[51:11] Rejuvenation you know how I got his new
[51:13] wine he talked to his wife and his wife
[51:16] said honey you're doing what's right
[51:18] just do what's right stand up for the
[51:20] word of God stand on the word and so he
[51:23] did he got he he uh he stood there and
[51:26] said going to get him out but eventually
[51:28] had to resign because of it because they
[51:29] weren't going to budge and that tells
[51:31] you what and that's these are message
[51:33] churches right right so It ultimately
[51:36] came down to he was so discouraged his
[51:39] wife had to encourage him and and and
[51:42] help strengthen him and bring fresh
[51:43] thoughts and fresh Revelation and so it
[51:46] was really great you know he got to go
[51:47] to another church and they support him
[51:49] fulltime and and now he's uh elsewhere
[51:51] preaching and and still a pastor amen
[51:55] but can you imagine the pressure I'm
[51:56] going to my job uh Insurance all these
[51:58] things I thought God called me to preach
[52:00] I thought these people believe the
[52:01] message look what political pressure
[52:03] does to
[52:05] people see if we don't cast down those
[52:07] thoughts right I'm gon to lose my job uh
[52:10] which we I'm not making fun of him or
[52:12] anything like that I'm just saying we
[52:13] all we have to go through things like
[52:15] that right but the reality of it is no
[52:17] matter what the struggle is we need to
[52:19] take that doubt or that fear whatever it
[52:21] is and cast it down and stand upon God's
[52:24] word but thank God for faithful wies and
[52:26] husbands right hopefully let me say like
[52:29] this hopefully our husbands have
[52:30] encouraged our wives at some point
[52:32] because it seems like the wives do a lot
[52:33] of encouraging right God bless our
[52:35] sisters right right we so Brothers God
[52:38] help us to be a better encouragement to
[52:39] our lives amen I thought maybe I hear
[52:41] some sisters say Amen on
[52:44] that but that's a true story true story
[52:48] pressure in the message because of who
[52:50] you are not because of what you're doing
[52:52] because of who you are puts pressure
[52:55] right people are disobeying the word yet
[52:57] they still get it to serve in the
[53:01] church may it never be us brother
[53:04] sisters may it never be us may we always
[53:06] be honest and humble with the word of
[53:08] God and obey every
[53:10] word now the second one was a preacher
[53:13] uh was and God actually used me in this
[53:15] one a preacher was just having a slow
[53:19] season wasn't getting many invites to
[53:21] preach uh wasn't uh you know people had
[53:24] stopped uh you know asking for sermons
[53:28] and I come in I preach that message
[53:30] diligence and I said I said have you
[53:32] ever heard of compound prophecy if you
[53:34] invest like a
[53:35] $100 uh today and keep doing a $100 a
[53:38] month you'll have like a million dollars
[53:40] I think it was 30 years if you just do a
[53:43] hundred that's probably not the right
[53:44] number but that's the power of compound
[53:47] interest and I said if you want to be a
[53:48] successful preacher I L I guess I looked
[53:50] right at the brother I said if you want
[53:51] to be a successful preacher you got to
[53:53] invest today and invest tomorrow and
[53:55] invest the next next day and pretty soon
[53:57] your gift is going to grow and it's
[53:58] going to increase and after the service
[54:00] the brother came up to the Altar and he
[54:02] was weeping and crying saying I was just
[54:03] told myself this morning I'm ready to
[54:05] quit I'm done preaching so I had the
[54:08] pleasure of seeing the Holy Ghost
[54:10] restore brother praise God wow almost
[54:12] left the ministry right almost quit
[54:15] almost walked away just because of
[54:17] discouragement ah what what do you need
[54:20] Church a fresh drink of wine am amen he
[54:22] needed a new a new skin he needed a new
[54:26] thought process and then he needed some
[54:28] uh simulation to go in there praise God
[54:31] Amen that's in the mind right he needed
[54:33] rejuvenated the mind you needed
[54:35] invigorate like oh God can still use me
[54:38] amen I can still be a service I can do
[54:41] something for the Lord I'm not a failure
[54:43] praise God Amen so just two with
[54:46] ministers that I could remember as I Was
[54:48] preparing this message
[54:50] here and so Church uh I want you just to
[54:54] understand that that this applies also
[54:56] Al to the
[54:58] mind so God is in the power God is in
[55:01] the uh the business of restoring us from
[55:05] mental breakdowns I've never had one
[55:07] thank God but I'm not saying I'll never
[55:08] have one but God I've seen God restore
[55:10] people to it and God when we almost feel
[55:14] like we're going to quit and we and God
[55:15] knows we wouldn't want to right God
[55:17] comes in and he rescues us praise God he
[55:20] gives us fresh inspiration fresh
[55:23] Rejuvenation fresh Revelation amen
[55:26] Hallelujah now there's as I said there's
[55:28] many Bible examples so let's turn in our
[55:31] Bibles here let's go to Psalms Psalms
[55:35] 103 just a beautiful chapter
[55:43] here Psalms 103 and I just had four and
[55:47] five just to watch the time oh I'm
[55:50] almost at 30 minutes now my
[55:52] goodness oh boy Psalms 10 3 4 and 5 just
[55:58] want to I want to show you this too
[56:00] remember the Believers in the Old
[56:01] Testament could not be born again the
[56:03] soul so anytime they talk
[56:05] about restoration it's new wine in the
[56:08] mind
[56:10] right okay so verse four and five who
[56:12] redeemeth thy life from destruction see
[56:14] redeemed your life was going to be
[56:16] destroyed but God brought you out of it
[56:18] who crowned you with loving kindness and
[56:19] Tender
[56:20] Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good
[56:24] things so that thy youth is renewed
[56:26] like the eagles praise God so God was
[56:31] able to renew Believers in the Old
[56:34] Testament they felt old they felt tired
[56:37] they felt almost dead and God said
[56:40] you're not I'm bringing you back to life
[56:42] amen God made them New Again God renewed
[56:46] their strength Like an Eagle praise God
[56:50] Amen God specialized in that Proverbs 3
[56:53] ver8 let's read that Proverbs 3 ver8
[56:57] so see it's new wine it's new power
[57:00] whereas we're told now I've never seen
[57:01] it scientifically Pro but we're told
[57:03] Eagles Can't Fly for a while they get
[57:05] discouraged maybe their eyes film over
[57:07] uh I've never seen it myself but it's in
[57:10] the Bible so it must happen to Eagles
[57:11] right but somehow they can't fly they
[57:13] can't see real well they can't hardly
[57:15] eat but somehow they break out of it and
[57:17] they can soar back up to where they were
[57:20] they look totally different their
[57:22] strength is renewed life is re renewed
[57:25] they got renewed Vision renewed hope
[57:27] renewed Faith praise God everything's
[57:30] new praise God Amen and the Bible said
[57:33] we can have it
[57:35] too renewals Proverbs 38 it shall be
[57:39] Health to thy Naval and Marrow to thy
[57:42] bones uh go to verse nine maybe that's
[57:44] what I was looking for no go back to
[57:47] seven must been seven
[57:49] 37 oh yeah I'm sorry yeah that's it
[57:51] right there I'm sorry 10 thank you hun
[57:54] ah you're on it
[57:56] sharp as
[57:58] attack so shall thy barns be filled with
[58:00] plenty so in other words when you're
[58:02] sick or you're discouraged God will
[58:04] restore you when you're empty God will
[58:05] fill you and thy presses shall burst out
[58:08] with new wine praise God in other words
[58:11] you have a fresh crop right you have a
[58:13] fresh harvest season you stomp out the
[58:16] grapes they come pouring out you let
[58:17] them ferment and it's fresh wine praise
[58:20] God Amen see God is the master of this
[58:23] God is the master of bringing people out
[58:25] of hardship and restoring them to
[58:28] Victory amen he's the master of it
[58:31] praise
[58:33] God so there you see let's go to job
[58:36] since we're here job 33 now remember
[58:39] alahu is a young man who rebukes job
[58:42] he's just a young man but he rebukes him
[58:44] anyway right before Psalms job
[58:54] 33 so you know in verse in chapter 32
[58:57] elu kind of has to he has to kind of say
[58:59] well he said I'm a young man in verse
[59:02] six he said I'm I'm young you're very
[59:04] old wherefore I was afraid and dur not
[59:06] show you mine opinion uh but look at
[59:08] verse eight but there's a spirit in man
[59:10] and the inspiration of the almighty
[59:11] giveth them understanding amen so you
[59:14] see he was afraid that was uh job 32 I'm

[59:20] 8 there's my 30 minutes so let me set
[59:22] another timer to be 40 that's crazy
[59:26] right so he said I was afraid to talk to
[59:29] this older man until the spirit of God
[59:32] Came Upon me and then when the spirit of
[59:34] God Came Upon me I understood what to
[59:38] say so I was fearful fearful fearful I
[59:41] didn't understand I didn't know didn't I
[59:42] was scared scared and all of a sudden ah
[59:44] now I know that's new wine praise God
[59:48] that that's a fresh Revelation praise
[59:50] God it's a fresh start it's renewed
[59:52] strength praise God now look what he
[59:54] says in 33 now it's to
[59:58] 33 now this is a beautiful chapter about
[1:00:01] dreams and how God speaks through
[1:00:04] dreams uh go to uh verse 22
[1:00:08] 33:22 y his soul draweth near into the
[1:00:11] grave and his life to the Destroyers if
[1:00:13] there be a messenger with him an
[1:00:14] interpreter one among a thousand to show
[1:00:16] unto man his uprightness then he is
[1:00:18] gracious unto him and say deliver him
[1:00:20] from going down to the pit I have found
[1:00:22] a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than
[1:00:26] a child's he shall return to the days of
[1:00:29] his youth he shall pray unto God and he
[1:00:31] will be favorable unto him and he shall
[1:00:33] see his face with joy he will Render
[1:00:36] unto man his righteousness so El was
[1:00:39] saying just stay with God if you're old
[1:00:42] and discouraged he said God is going to
[1:00:44] restore your strength praise God he's
[1:00:45] gonna make your in job's case he
[1:00:48] literally made his skin like a new baby
[1:00:50] praise God right He restored his health
[1:00:53] and haven't we seen that with your
[1:00:54] father-in-law haven't we seen that it's
[1:00:56] like he was in the the very depths of
[1:00:58] perishing right the very depths and now
[1:01:00] he's he's up and so busy all the time
[1:01:02] right he just it just that that's God
[1:01:05] God's a restore of life amen he makes
[1:01:08] things new praise God he feels like he's
[1:01:11] young again praise God he returns to the
[1:01:13] days of his youth praise God Amen go to
[1:01:17] Jeremiah 20 Jeremiah 20 let's look at
[1:01:20] God restore
[1:01:23] Jeremiah Jeremiah in this chapter
[1:01:26] has been he's already been prophesied
[1:01:28] he's already been spit on he's been
[1:01:31] slapped across the
[1:01:36] face uh verse one 20 verse one now pure
[1:01:40] the son of emmer the priest who was also
[1:01:41] chief governor of the house of the Lord
[1:01:43] heard that Jeremiah prophesied these
[1:01:45] things then pasture smoked Jeremiah the
[1:01:47] prophet and put him in the stocks that
[1:01:48] were in the High Gate of the Benjamin
[1:01:50] which was by the house of the Lord and
[1:01:52] it came to pass in the tomorrow that
[1:01:53] pasture brought forth Jeremiah out of
[1:01:54] the stocks then Jeremiah said unto him
[1:01:57] the Lord hath not called thy name pure
[1:01:59] but magor missabib now that means Terror
[1:02:03] on every
[1:02:05] side so he said you're not pure you're a
[1:02:07] terror on every side you're not a man of
[1:02:10] Peace you're a man of Terror okay what a
[1:02:12] rebuke he just got out of the prison
[1:02:14] right you think he has something nice to
[1:02:16] say he don't have something nice to say
[1:02:18] he's bringing correction to this evil
[1:02:19] man now go down to
[1:02:22] verse uh uh we'll just go to verse eight
[1:02:26] for since I spake I cried out and cried
[1:02:28] violence and spoil because the word Lord
[1:02:30] was made a reproach unto me and a
[1:02:31] derision daily so every day the more
[1:02:34] Jeremiah preached the more he was
[1:02:37] persecuted the more he preached the more
[1:02:39] he was made fun of the more he preached
[1:02:41] the more he got punched or slapped or
[1:02:43] put in prison and he was about ready to
[1:02:45] quit right verse nine then I said I will
[1:02:47] not make mention of him nor speak any
[1:02:49] more his name but his word was in Mine
[1:02:52] Heart as a burning fire shut up in my
[1:02:55] bone bones and I was weary with
[1:02:57] forbearing and I could not stay praise
[1:03:00] God so he was he's like I'm I'm this is
[1:03:03] like the one we the testimony we heard
[1:03:05] earlier I'm done preaching I'm done with
[1:03:07] struggles I'm done uh fighting against
[1:03:11] people I don't want to fight anymore and
[1:03:12] all of a sudden the real fighter rose up
[1:03:15] inside of him amen amen when you think
[1:03:17] you're done you just wait the real
[1:03:19] fighter is gonna rise up in you praise
[1:03:21] God Amen he said I'm done I've had
[1:03:24] enough of this this is too to be a
[1:03:26] Christian oh well there were you right
[1:03:28] but for us it's too hard to be a message
[1:03:30] believer it's too hard to deal with this
[1:03:31] and all of a sudden God said I won't let
[1:03:33] you quit I'm going to start a new fire
[1:03:35] in you a new fire new wine new
[1:03:38] invigoration praise God new enthusiasm
[1:03:41] praise God to keep going he ends up
[1:03:44] preaching what 24 more chapters or
[1:03:46] something like that I think it's
[1:03:48] Jeremiah 49 it goes up to boy he wasn't
[1:03:51] done even halfway praise God and this
[1:03:53] fire came up inside of him let me just
[1:03:56] see there it's 40 uh no it's 50 50 he
[1:03:59] was even halfway
[1:04:01] done see and church that's if you really
[1:04:03] love God you don't want to quit either
[1:04:05] do you that's my prayer if I ever quit
[1:04:08] God then you ra you have my permission
[1:04:10] to slap me aside you have you my
[1:04:12] permission to send a fire inside of me
[1:04:14] and get me to wake up praise God there
[1:04:17] one thing that's going to wake you up is
[1:04:18] fire remember brother tried to he tried
[1:04:20] to baptize the turtle he tried to tickle
[1:04:23] the turtle he said but I want when he
[1:04:25] put fire to the turtle the turtle move
[1:04:27] praise God because fire will make you
[1:04:29] move the Holy Ghost and Fire will give
[1:04:31] you strength it'll invigorate you it'll
[1:04:33] give you new power praise God because
[1:04:36] that's what it is power amen amen
[1:04:38] hallelujah A sound mind right the God
[1:04:41] has not giv us a spirit of fear but a
[1:04:43] power love and a sound mind praise God
[1:04:47] Amen if you like quit well pray for God
[1:04:50] to give you some fire praise God or wait
[1:04:53] around and God will put a fire in you
[1:04:55] because if if you really don't want to
[1:04:56] quit you're not going to be able to quit
[1:04:58] if God's got work for you to do and
[1:04:59] you're not done yet he's going to put
[1:05:01] fire in you praise God now I better
[1:05:04] finish up here I got four more minutes
[1:05:05] on my 40 I got four minutes on my 40 can
[1:05:07] you believe that
[1:05:09] um now New Testament people went through
[1:05:12] many hardships right uh
[1:05:15] Peter cursed Jesus or I'm sorry cursed
[1:05:18] that he didn't know Jesus he didn't
[1:05:19] curse Jesus he cursed and said he didn't
[1:05:21] know Jesus but what does God do God
[1:05:23] restores his life praise God am
[1:05:26] God uh and Jesus comes to him himself
[1:05:29] and says do you love me he said go feed
[1:05:30] my sheep Now isn't that love you feel
[1:05:33] like you know so he quit preaching he
[1:05:35] went back out to fish and then Jesus
[1:05:37] said no you're not going to fish you're
[1:05:38] G to go feed my sheep right so he gives
[1:05:42] him he said how could I be a preacher I
[1:05:43] denied my Lord and Jesus said everybody
[1:05:46] makes
[1:05:46] mistakes I I said like this everybody
[1:05:49] makes mistakes you make mistakes I make
[1:05:51] mistakes we all make mistakes but God
[1:05:53] doesn't want you to quit praise God Amen
[1:05:55] amen amen a preacher who seen miracles
[1:05:59] for three years denies the very one who
[1:06:02] gave him power to make Miracles and
[1:06:04] Jesus doesn't cast them aside Jesus says
[1:06:06] go feed my sheep Noti go preach the word
[1:06:08] of God Amen see your testimony is more
[1:06:11] powerful as you go through your
[1:06:13] struggles right Bud see our testimony is
[1:06:16] only going to get more powerful as we
[1:06:18] overcome the battles praise God Amen but
[1:06:21] it was for Peter it's that way for us
[1:06:24] too and I wonder if he got new
[1:06:27] wine yeah he got new wine he said this
[1:06:29] is not the wine you're talking about
[1:06:31] it's the wine Joel talked
[1:06:34] about praise God now so so part of this
[1:06:37] many times part of getting new wine is
[1:06:40] repenting right when you when you and I
[1:06:42] really repent and church as a preacher
[1:06:45] and as a Christian many times I know if
[1:06:47] people really are repenting when they
[1:06:48] come to the altar right you can feel it
[1:06:51] many times you can feel it but here Paul
[1:06:55] defines what real repentance looks like
[1:06:58] so go to 2 Corinthians
[1:07:06] 7 he said this is what new wine really
[1:07:09] looks like 2 Corinthians
[1:07:16] 7 now this is right after casting down
[1:07:19] imagination I'm sorry no that that's
[1:07:21] chapter 10 I'm sorry I'm in the wrong
[1:07:22] chapter chapter 7 2 Corinthians 7
[1:07:26] now Paul he says he gives them he made
[1:07:28] them sorrowful with Godly sorrow to
[1:07:31] repentance that's verse n and verse 10
[1:07:33] for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to
[1:07:35] Salvation not to be repented of but the
[1:07:37] sorrow of the world worketh death now
[1:07:39] here is ver for behold the self-same

[1:07:47] indignation yay What Fear yay what vem
[1:07:51] desire yay what Zeal yay what revenge in
[1:07:54] all things you have to prove yourselves
[1:07:57] to be clear in this matter and the
[1:07:58] church said when you really when you and
[1:08:01] I really get a drink of wine we're more
[1:08:04] zealous and we're we're where we have a
[1:08:06] mind of Revenge we're not going to go
[1:08:08] back to that trouble we're not going to
[1:08:10] go back to that Temptation I'm gonna
[1:08:12] overcome that I'm no longer I'm gonna
[1:08:14] have a real fear for God I I know God is
[1:08:17] near I know his presence is here and I'm
[1:08:18] not going to sit against God am this is
[1:08:21] what real wine produces it produces a
[1:08:25] I'm carefulness right I'm going to clear
[1:08:27] myself I'll never do that again they'll
[1:08:29] never catch me doing that again I'll
[1:08:30] never catch myself doing it again
[1:08:32] because I've sorrowed after a Godly sore
[1:08:35] I've got in touch with God's heart amen
[1:08:37] I'm I'm grieved for my sins and I'll
[1:08:39] never go back because I've had a drink
[1:08:41] of new wine amen
[1:08:44] amen now Church how could Paul write
[1:08:47] this because he'd been through it right
[1:08:50] can he write about something he doesn't
[1:08:51] know no he he had some Revelation from
[1:08:54] God this is what what you produce see
[1:08:56] when you repent when we really repent
[1:08:59] this is what it should produce a new
[1:09:01] Strength right I'm not giving up it's
[1:09:04] been a long time it's been a long time
[1:09:05] since I've been discouraged about our
[1:09:06] church because God has done so many
[1:09:08] great things amen but before we moved
[1:09:11] here I was discouraged many times so
[1:09:12] like this is like a brand new start for
[1:09:13] me this whole church it's a blessing and
[1:09:16] all the people are the bigger blessing
[1:09:17] though but anyways there was so many
[1:09:19] times I was going to quit you know or I
[1:09:21] felt like quitting but each time God
[1:09:23] would send this little encouragement or
[1:09:24] somebody would get baptize or somebody
[1:09:26] you there'd be just enough encouragement
[1:09:28] to keep going and and and and then I
[1:09:31] would feel ashamed of myself after God
[1:09:33] would do that and I would have to and I
[1:09:36] and I would have a brand new desire I
[1:09:38] remember right this is a different thing
[1:09:40] I remember I stopped writing that
[1:09:41] modesty book a few years ago I stopped
[1:09:43] and John Graham come to me one day uh we
[1:09:46] were at a Giant Eagle he's like so are
[1:09:48] you done with that book I'm like no I
[1:09:50] said I stopped but just that morning I
[1:09:52] prayed and decided I was going to I'm
[1:09:54] going to finish that book
[1:09:56] I'm gonna finish that book and so when
[1:09:58] John said that I said oh brother that's
[1:09:59] two witnesses I had a witness this
[1:10:01] morning I need to finish it and he said
[1:10:03] yeah he said you need to finish it and
[1:10:05] so I went on a tear after that praise
[1:10:07] God and so I I I was more motivated
[1:10:10] praise God I had a fresh start I could
[1:10:13] look at the paper and it was fresh to me
[1:10:15] praise God because that's the most
[1:10:16] recent time I felt like I've had like a
[1:10:18] renewal praise God so I've been trying
[1:10:20] to go on this same power for a long time
[1:10:23] by the grace of God now in
[1:10:26] closing there's a lot of things I could
[1:10:28] say uh but in closing let's go to uh 1st
[1:10:32] Samuel 30 let's go to Let's close with
[1:10:34] David this such a beautiful text and I I
[1:10:36] will close here we got 20 minutes for
[1:10:38] amen till 8 o'clock so uh first Samuel
[1:10:42] 30 now if you know the story David's not
[1:10:45] King he's not even King in Hebron yet
[1:10:48] this is before Saul died he's he's in
[1:10:50] the process still of running from Saul
[1:10:53] Psalms 30 I'm sorry 1 Samuel 30
[1:10:59] sorry this is right after church he was
[1:11:02] with the Philistines you know that David
[1:11:04] went and was with the Philistines
[1:11:06] running from Saul that's how that's how
[1:11:08] scared he was of Saul which any mortal
[1:11:10] man would be right and then he sa he was
[1:11:14] going to go fight against Israel in
[1:11:15] chapter 29 but God was merciful and God
[1:11:18] brought him out of fighting against
[1:11:20] God's Own people talk about Grace talk
[1:11:23] about Grace now you know this is ziklag
[1:11:26] chapter 30 1st Samuel
[1:11:28] 30 and it came to pass when David and
[1:11:30] his men were come to ziklag on the third
[1:11:32] day that the amalekites had invaded the
[1:11:34] South and ziklag and smitten and ziklag
[1:11:36] and burned it with fire and had taken
[1:11:38] the women captives that were therein
[1:11:40] they slew not any either great or small
[1:11:43] but carried them away and went on their
[1:11:44] way so David and his men came to the
[1:11:46] city and behold it was burned with fire
[1:11:48] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:11:49] daughters were taken captives can you
[1:11:51] imagine if we came to church one day and
[1:11:53] just the adults came back maybe we left
[1:11:55] somebody in charge of the kids and
[1:11:56] everybody was gone right just just a few
[1:12:00] people were left where's everybody at
[1:12:03] they were taken away verse four and then
[1:12:05] DAV and the people that were with him
[1:12:06] lifted up their voice and wept until
[1:12:08] they had no more power to weep now
[1:12:11] before we read on ask yourself should
[1:12:14] they have wept or not should they have
[1:12:16] wept or not ask yourself
[1:12:19] that go to verse five and David's two
[1:12:22] wies were taken captives a hno and jez
[1:12:26] the jezus and Abigail the wife of nabal
[1:12:29] the camelite or carite look at verse six
[1:12:32] and David was greatly distressed for the
[1:12:33] people spake of stoning him can you
[1:12:35] imagine coming into a church and
[1:12:37] everybody wants to Stone the preacher
[1:12:39] I've seen a few mean faces but nothing
[1:12:40] that bad I've seen a few angry people
[1:12:43] I've had people walk out not really here
[1:12:44] but other churches when I've been the
[1:12:46] guest preacher they'll just walk out
[1:12:47] they don't like what I'm preaching but
[1:12:49] I've never had anybody with stones about
[1:12:51] ready to Stone me now remember he's he's
[1:12:53] only anointed he's not King yet he's
[1:12:56] just anointed king he's just potential
[1:12:59] King because the soul of all the people
[1:13:01] is grieved every man for his sons and
[1:13:03] for his daughters but David encouraged
[1:13:06] himself in the Lord his
[1:13:10] God praise the Lord church talk about
[1:13:14] new wine right just a few hours earlier
[1:13:17] he's crying and saying oh all hope is
[1:13:19] God everybody wants to kill me
[1:13:23] right all hope is love Lo what is there
[1:13:26] to live for my children my wife
[1:13:28] everyone's gone the whole church is gone
[1:13:30] right and these guys want to kill me and
[1:13:32] the only place he found new wi was in
[1:13:36] the presence of God all by himself
[1:13:38] praise God Amen the Bible said be still
[1:13:41] and know that I'm God I imagine David
[1:13:43] experienced that on this day praise God
[1:13:45] because nobody else encouraged him
[1:13:48] Church there's going to be some times
[1:13:49] where nobody else can encourage you
[1:13:51] except your time with God because nobody
[1:13:54] else did there's going to be times I
[1:13:55] can't encourage you brother amen but God
[1:13:57] will praise God Amen there's going to be
[1:13:59] times you want to encourage me and it
[1:14:01] just don't seem like I catch it what I
[1:14:03] need is to encourage myself in other
[1:14:05] words get in the presence of God and God
[1:14:07] will raise my faith amen
[1:14:11] amen see there's times where you won't
[1:14:14] be able to help people you can point
[1:14:16] them to it but they've got to get in
[1:14:18] God's presence the themselves they got
[1:14:20] to get in his presence and they got to
[1:14:21] receive the new wine
[1:14:24] themselves but then remember there was
[1:14:25] times in the New Testament where Paul
[1:14:26] said Titus my son has refreshed
[1:14:30] me right he was in prison he was all and
[1:14:33] then uh the prison guards let him have
[1:14:35] some fellowship with Titus and he's like
[1:14:37] oh I'm so refreshed there will be some
[1:14:39] times where God will refresh you there
[1:14:41] will be a time a brother or sister will
[1:14:43] give you a word in due season how
[1:14:45] special it is the Bible says but there's
[1:14:47] other times where there's going to be
[1:14:48] nobody around and you've got to go
[1:14:51] before God and you've got to get
[1:14:53] encouraged and you've got to get some
[1:14:54] wine from God
[1:14:56] yourself praise
[1:14:58] God and like look at this once he's
[1:15:01] encouraged look what he does verse seven
[1:15:03] and David said to abathar the priest
[1:15:05] himik son I pray thee bring me hither
[1:15:07] the ephod that was the yman
[1:15:09] Thum so first he's crying like it's all
[1:15:12] hopes gone then people want to kill him
[1:15:15] and then he gets in the presence of God
[1:15:17] God encourages him God gives him new
[1:15:19] wine he's rejuvenated he says somebody
[1:15:21] get me that Bible amen somebody give me
[1:15:25] a Bible and and I want to speak to the
[1:15:27] word and I want to see the word speak

[1:15:58] the Lord and said shall I pursue him and
[1:15:59] he said shall I overtake them he
[1:16:01] answered pursue for Thou shalt surely
[1:16:03] overtake them and without fail recover
