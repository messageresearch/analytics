let's do our memory verse here tonight Matthew 5 verse 3 and our attitude is Lord write these words upon the fleshly table of my heart Matthew 5 verse 3 poor mourn meek hunger merciful pure peacemakers I try to remember those first letters as help me to memorize it a little better by God's grace let's do verses three to twelve let's begin on three one two three blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you praise gone let's read our text here tonight by God's grace I liked it let's just go back to 1st Thessalonians 5:21 I like to look at part 6 improve all things Lord willing after tonight Lord willing we'll be able to get now to the other side [Music] they'll believe the sign and those that have left the message but tonight I want to finish up on the false doctrines coming out of Jeffersonville so 1st Thessalonians 5:21 I got a text saying sermon 5 so Sunday's sermon was awesome like your balance on subjects concerning brother branham's that was a encouragement there so I said it's all glory to God they're all by God's grace that's one thing we need in this hour we need balance don't we by God's grace we don't want to be too far on one side or too far on the other we want to be right down the middle of the road 1st Thessalonians 5:21 let's read that on three one two three prove all things hold fast that which is good they got as blessings arena of his word may be seated here tonight I don't have enough slides you know I forgot we're gonna do service today so I didn't prepare enough slides so I don't have any slides to show today so I'll just be reading quotes and quoting scriptures by God's grace so Lord willing we went through the first five of the concerns we found how not every word brother Branham said was thus saith the Lord with and I think I did 19 examples where the Jose and I were talking after service on Sunday we had about three or four more I didn't get to study on those but I can name a few of them you know brother Branham said or the oh yeah okay I thought what you talking to me sorry but the random said at the end of his life you know that he was gonna go back to Jeffers Ville Jeffersonville and preach trail of the serpent he said is going to be a four-hour sermon and he said Billy Billy Paul will send out invitations and and they'll record that well that never happened now the the tape I'm sorry the return ministry people believe that's actually going to happen they still believe that that's why they prepare a plane to fly brother Branham around the world and ride the trail again and that's what they believe so they they if they believe every word is thus saith the Lord then they believe that but we don't believe that we believe he had intentions to do that but he didn't God didn't allow him to do that because it was his time to go home we believe that so that was one of them of course there was some few other ones I don't remember all of them that we we talked about so the second one first one was not every words thus saith the Lord second one they the their church promotes blind faith in every word brother Branham said and we've got to make sure that we don't fall into that like we said we don't want a critical spirit you know about brother Branham or Paul for that matter or anyone in the Bible but we've got to we've got to get in the habit of leaning upon the Holy Spirit and testing every word praise God and I'll say like this if you're born again you already do that because brother Branham says if you're born again you get a buzzer inside of you called discernment and any time if something goes against that Holy Spirit and tries to quench the thirst of the Holy Spirit but the RAM said a buzzer goes off to protect your life so if anything would try to quench that holy thirst or try to stop that holy thirst for the RAM said you got a buzzer that says your life's in danger your life's in danger and every time I listen to that church in Jeffersonville I always hear that your life's in danger your life's in danger the buzzer inside of me goes off and that's why I've been building up these quotes and preaching it repeatedly off and on to try to help the people that are in there so I'm still working on the video for the two sons of the Prophet and so we'll try to hopefully finish that by Saturday and that's what that's what God has given you the Holy Spirit for to guide you into all truth so the second thing is we do not have blind faith in every word we we want to respect we show honor to brother Branham and all God's servants but every word must be taken back to the scripture to make sure we have the right faith and the right understanding thirdly they say the tapes are the token they say being a tape Church is the token and we saw how that's not right the token is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and let me read you two quotes here that that help us understand that clearly by God's grace so here it is all right sorry here yeah well the RAM says this is the token September 1st the first time he preached it in Jeffersonville he said there it is you cannot perish now the life lace over it it's a token lays over that little body lays over that soul of that person so where does the token of the Holy Spirit lay over the soul there is a token over there the Holy Spirit that it belongs to God now brother man would never say my tapes the token they'll never say being a tape Church is a token I showed you on Sunday there's only three quotes about the tape Church right and they're just there to questions in the questions and answers and never does he ever say oh yeah listen to my tapes at home they're the token he doesn't say that the the the problem is is that the their church misinterprets quotes where it says the message of the hour you you've got the token the message of the hour or something like that and so we'll talk about that in a moment but here he says it plainly he says it he says the Holy Spirit belongs to God it's his when I see the token I'll pass over you a positive token the Holy Spirit is our token so when you when they make the tapes the token or tape Church the token they've done the same thing that Pentecostals have done and made a fleshly evidence that anybody can reproduce anybody can reproduce that it can be impersonated but the love of Jesus Christ of course it can be impersonated but it can never be done unless you got it praise God you got to have it and then you'll love your right then you'll love the word then your your life will will be ever-increasing into more godliness more obedience more love to Christ now in a the same year in the token in November of 63 he said the token seal of the Holy Spirit is our promise Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption so here he says the token is on the soul and the token is the seal so now we know clearly the token is the seal of the Holy Ghost praise God it can't be anything else that they're saying that it was and church don't forget these are real important scriptures john 14:26 in John 16:13 that proved the evidence of the Holy Ghost is being led into all truth so you if you're truly born again you and I are born again we can learn more about God we can draw closer to God so that means a true Holy Ghost filled Christian won't get bored with learning about the Lord they don't get distracted and say oh I like to learn more about the world than I do the word they won't because the evidence is they want more of God all the time Eileen oh yeah they don't get bored with reading their Bibles or studying or praying or hearing preaching because the Holy Spirit feeds on the word praise God they don't they don't die spiritually because their buzzer says I need life I need more I need more I've got them I want to draw closer I want fellowship with my Lord but sees people that aren't born again they fall short in that area because jesus said the Holy Spirit will teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance whatever I've said unto you so the Holy Spirit will always point us back to the word as the token in John 16:13 when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth he'll not speak of himself in other words he won't speak outside the word the Holy Spirit will always speak of the word of God amen and he will show you things to come amen thank God rubber bands prophetic words showed us what's to come thank God we know what's to come we're not confused about that praise God now I wanted to read a couple more that I don't think I got to on the other one about blind faith remember brother Branham said he said search it by the word and see if it's right the Bible said prove all things he said test me by the word he said don't the Bible say prove all things he said here's the time that everything I've said has got to be proven right or wrong but I said we must prove all things by scripture yeah I think I read these to you a couple weeks ago right last week yeah he said prove all things by scripture if it's contrary to my faith yet the scripture says so the scripture is right and I'm wrong okay so I just want to reiterate those to you I haven't preached those too much I just want to lay those in again so we got those okay now the next one I want to get to hear the next no so number six and I got I probably could do eight but I got definitely got seven the next one is number six that the tape boys are the new fivefold ministry okay so that's what the church that their church teaches the tape boys are the new fivefold ministry now they want people like me to sit down and stop preaching and they want me to press play that's what they want me to do and their new fivefold ministry is tape boys so people that go into churches and try to talk to people like me or you know they would call a demas like me they would call me right or a make believer like me they would try to send a tape boy in the church and just say play you pastor you need to play the tapes you can marry them bury them baptize them but you can't preach you what are you saying you're greater than the Prophet that that's what they would say and so that's their new fivefold ministry but let's let's read exactly what they say so this is from a sermon though they preached last year they said okay yeah I'm sorry here it is the correct way for the fivefold ministry Joshua's messengers remember they say Joshua's messengers that went into Jericho were taped boys brother and makes a quote like that but he never says thus saith the Lord and he never even takes it as far as it's like a joke in passing he kind of laughs about it and said see some tape boy slipped in there any kind of chuckles and there's anyone listen to the token lately he kind of chuckles at that and said uh some tape boy slipped in there it wasn't a doctrine brother branham was preaching but see people with the wrong spirit they'll listen to a tape and they'll make whatever they want a doctrine instead of they don't have the understanding that every word of God must be proven in the mouth of two or three witnesses and so they don't even have a scripture for that witness they only got quotes for that but we know we're not saved by quotes were saved by the word praise God although we appreciate all the quotes we thank God they're recorded we thank God for all the efforts to bring the tapes to recording the magnetic tape and mp3 now but every quote has got to be taken back to the word he said the correct way for the five fold he said Joshua's messengers tape boys were what the five fold ministry that five fold ministry went in there being told what to do so that's the five fold ministry what did the true five fold ministry preach so now they're the true five fold ministry and I'm the false five fold ministry he said they played Rahab a tape that's what the five fold ministry is supposed to do oh how sad that is how sad that is oh so the real five fold ministry goes into houses now and that and that's many times you'll see that the pastor at Jeffersonville will leave to travel and so the he'll cancel service and said don't gather in the church gather in the homes because they they they they're fulfilling quotes how Rahab let the tape boys come in her home so so they're Church if they don't gather in the church many Sundays they'll gather in homes and play the tapes and then they're so happy they're fulfilling this quote where brother BAM said Rahab opened her home to the tape boys case to see see that they're there leaning upon a man-made interpretation rather than leaning upon the Word of God so sadly are they no scripture for this there's no scripture to ever say that the fivefold ministry is going to change our church if you get your Bible and go to Ephesians 4 you and I know it doesn't take a smart person or intellectual person but you and I know that the fivefold ministry is what Jesus Christ Himself sent down from heaven to empower the church and he said the fivefold ministry is going to last in verse 12 until the Saints are perfected in verse 13 until we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen praise God how long does it last brother sister it lasts until we're ready for the rapture it lasts until the bride is rapture ready hey men cuz he's got so much Holy Ghost - she's got so much rapture and faith her faith is able to change your body and take her off the earth now that's what the word says you'll never see a word where Paul ever says stop preaching or let's we're going to change the fivefold ministry that's what we ended with on Sunday where that church now says revelation 22:16 means play tapes instead of preach but that's not there's no there's no other scripture for that all right now you know the Word of God Romans 10 let's go to Romans 10 remember without the fivefold ministry as returned to Rome instead without the fivefold ministry they will be tossed the Bible said to and fro by every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men by the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive so those that reject the true fivefold ministry are tossed by every wind and wave they can believe anything right they can believe every word brother Ram said was thus they the little they can believe that and before the pastor even said Jesus Christ said to play tapes and said have preachers that's what the pastor said before even read the scripture that he misinterpreted everybody was cheering beforehand see they'll believe anything like you don't even need a scripture a church if I say something there's no scripture by you shouldn't believe it you should believe it when it's in the word praise God now if you're if you're the Holy Spirit inside of you you know accepts it before I actually reference the scripture that's different I that just means the Holy Spirit discern it and yet oh I know that scripture I sense that I feel the spirit giving me a witness that that's the scripture that's different I'm not talking about that but I'm talking about their false doctrine and false interpretation they'll just receive anything right and that's where that's where that that second mistake is so evil when they have blind faith in every single word that means they don't question in it and what happens is they open themselves up to every demon if you believe every single thing then you're open up then you have the you let your guard down how did the goats get in the church they let the guard down how do demons get into people's minds when they let their guard down I can just believe anything and brother that Jose then they can believe brother Ram is going to come back and preach right and fly around the world they can believe that that they'll believe anything right as long as this on that tape they'll believe it they'll believe he's going to come back and he'd have to die and get shot by guns remember he's gonna have to get fired upon and the false church is going to kill don't believe anything and it opens them up to evil spirits but brother Aaron said never never clear your mind like that he said always keep your mind sharp always examine everything by the Word of God amen don't throw your filter out what would happen if you know you know what would happen church if I threw my filter out at my house my water would my thoughts will be pumping out orange rusty water you ever seen at our house your bird over to our house I have a filter in there I got to change it every six weeks well now I'm gonna try to change every four and it pulls out all the orange rust right and if not we would have caked orange rust our water would be orange we me we'd probably work Oh the orange you you cannot throughout the filter the filter protects your life amen in fact the worker said if you don't change that filter it's gonna ruin everything it's gonna ruin the pipes is going to ruin the faucets our whole house is gonna be ruined if we don't have the filter this church will be ruined if we don't keep the filter of God's Word your life your family and in fact that's what the brother was telling me and uh in Pennsylvania he said this false doctrine of of every word as us at the Lord he said it's ruining their family in Central America I don't want to cause names I don't embarrass his family but he was cupped they're crying at the altar and saying uh you know his wife who was you know he was he left his wife there in Central America to do some business he was crying and just saying she's getting pressured it and they're all calling programs son a prophet and every word is uh saith the Lord and it's just ripping people apart it's causing more fights than unity but see the Holy Spirit brings unity through the word where God's people fall in love with each other not fight now we got to we have to have a place to stand but we can still love one another praise God so we don't throw out our filter we don't open up our mind to just any doctrine that's how you're gonna get the wrong spirit and we'll get to that here just in a moment by God's grace but take boys now Romans 10 and I remember church that what they do is they they they're breaking the word remember they got fivefold ministry when they got brother brand they're gonna keep brother brand they're gonna keep their their pastor programs youngest son but they're gonna change the threefold so they change they change at least three offices the teacher I guess the pastor to I guess they would maybe get rid of four of them the Apostle all those other ones are teh boys no longer preachers and they've starting deleting the word or changing the word but we're not to change one word of it see because they quotes and then they misinterpret the quotes and they don't take the quotes back to the word we got to filter every quote through the Word of God that's right now Romans 10 look at verse 12 for there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him and that beautiful if you call upon God God is rich in mercy to you verse 13 for whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved and how should they call on the name of him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher not a quota or a tape player but a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things amen but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God the longer I live the more I realized I was sent to Akron to preach I was sent here I didn't know there was a city named Akron until I was seventeen years old and they said the coaches said well there's a college named Akron looking at you to play football I didn't even know it but I realized later God sent me here to preach the word because we had to find a John Graham we had to find a van yang right we had to find all these different believers in this area we have a place where God's sheep could be fed the Word of God how should they hear without a preacher and when the Bible say about preachers how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace so this this this church that bears the prophets name no longer sees the feet of preachers as a beautiful thing it's not a beautiful path anymore it's disgraceful it's disobedient it's make a believer right it's like a lot or a Judas it's like of course lot was a real believer but later on would class him as a make believer because he wasn't a true as far as the full potential of a believer and that's what they class it as like oh they these guys they just all got it mixed up and church no doubt some preachers got it mixed up lots of preachers got it mixed up but the real Bride of Christ never got it mixed up the real Bride of Christ has no condemnation the real Bride of Christ has been led more into the truth of the message as time has gone on that's right so we can't do away with these scriptures there's never any hint of the scriptures ever changing now let's look at tape a few date boys here quotes for a little bit here I got a few I want to share with you brother Ram said sit in the cool of your room and listen to the tapes remember that things are troops memory had to store them up so we're supposed to listen to our tapes at home like last night would we finished the breach right and then we'll start the first shield tomorrow night listen to him we're gonna listen to him and they direct us back to the word the Holy Spirit show brother man I'm a vision he said these tapes will go worldwide where people in their houses them tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinate of God because he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to its course that's the reason he sent me back to do this store up the food here he forbid me to go overseas praise God praise the Lord now so we see here now I want to read a few more quotes about the fivefold ministry letter and said there is five officers elected of God he said apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists God did that man has deacons and so forth and everything else but God said the church for the perfecting of the Saints can't divide it so God is the one who established the fivefold ministry and how dare anybody try to divide what God has established it's a very serious thing when they start attacking preachers of God's Word Moran said the chief shepherd will bring the whole church including the fivefold ministry back to the truth by the messenger of this age praise God amen he said you can't possibly take a place amongst the fivefold ministry of Ephesians four and not take authority over men so the fivefold ministry is the authority within the church praise God all right well Aram said the Holy Ghost is to take the church over not a political vote of who is who he said God placed in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers evangelists pastors not men voted them in there but God placed him in there by the calling of the Holy Spirit prayer meetings and laying out of hands and staying before God praise God amen now here's one I don't I read this here hey oh yeah I don't think I read this one but Matt they asked brother branham in 1964 do you teach the bride must not attend any other church unless you're preaching there or otherwise the tabernacle no I don't teach that I don't believe that I do not believe that we've got Minister setting here that's scattered all around through the country and I believe they're part of that bride I believe that a man or woman can go to church anywhere they want to that teaches the word and I believe if they don't teach the whole word and you can't go to church any other place where they teach the whole word go where they teach half the word until you can get to where they teach the whole word go to church whatever you do do that praise God he said now remember go to church somewhere praise the Lord all right now we looked at those now for the tape boys quotes there from the message that token now it's clear that the tape boys program is referencing to the two witnesses that went down to Rahab was to get her the whole point of those messengers going down to get Rahab were to get her to follow Joshua kehm briefs amen to that and Joshua was following the Ark of the Covenant praise God because what took them in the Promised Land the Ark right and who handled the ark the priests so the tape boys were like witnessing people that witness and called and shared the word brought Rahab out by the blood right the doors we say the scarlet token and then she was to follow the ark or the word for her day praise God the tape ministry was never the highlight of Rahab's worship it helped her get out of Jericho but she had to move on past the messengers do you think she just filed those messengers around everywhere they went after they left Jericho do you think she can't right next to the two-tenths of the messenger boys no she took her place got married right she took her place in the tribe of her husband and then she found her place and all she just took her place and they all came back to worship at the Ark of the word praise God so see she moved on she went from Tait boy she was will say like this she got won by the tape boys but then the tape boys brought her to the Ark the Word of God and she found her position worshiping in the same place everybody else worship through the priesthood through the the ministry of that hour the living word like we're doing today praise God hallelujah did God say he dwell amongst the tape boys the two messengers no he said he dwelt amongst between the cherubims and those tape boys if they weren't priests they couldn't go into the Holy of Holies they'd have access they could never take her in there praise God but the priest could make intercession for the priests that were of the Ark ministry the predestinated ordained ministry that God had for that hour and today that ministry is the fivefold ministry for us praise God brother brother Jose I appreciate mother Simon he was like a tape boy he slipped in and played a tape he didn't slip in and preach at me he slipped in and press play and I heard Severin seed that's how I first heard the message so I'm grateful like Rahab thanks God I heard a tape first but the tape called me out to the real ministry praise God I wonder how sister beatrice and william did it you know i wonder did they hear our live preacher first or to the hair tape board you know sister okay preaching praise the lord yeah amen that's how our children are they heard preaching live preaching first okay praise the Lord hallelujah beautiful beautiful Jose how about you as a teacher just books yes one day I have nothing to read my why you have a bunch of that's right that's right we got one I guess because one and and the title is the Lord amen so it could be book tape or live preaching it doesn't matter that the reality is God has a way to find all those that are gonna that are predestinated to it praise God beautiful stories beautiful stories see what did the tape boy ministry lead Rahab to worship with the rest of the people through the tabernacle praise God all right see all she had to do the Bible said Rahab received the spies with peace the Bible said she received the messengers so that's all God requires receive the messengers that he sends praise God that's what he required no matter which form it is but then if you get brought into the body the body is going to be United through the fivefold ministry until we all come in perfection until you all come in rapturing condition praise God beautiful that's right Rahab was right in that lineage of Matthew or of Jesus right praise God and salmon begat Boaz of Rahab there and Boaz we got obed of ruth and obed begat jesse and then jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called the christ amen hallelujah very good now I'm just kind of flipping through here yeah I got a more yeah I didn't see some of these I forgot about some of these there's a whole lot more statements that prove but Iran was not infallible but I won't labor on those now so so let me get back to my notes here my regular notes okay so that was number six tape boys are the new fivefold ministry is there any evidence in the entire Bible where Paul ever says you know you're gonna have to stop preaching at the end time has anybody ever seen any evidence I'll say like this I charge you in Christ's name if there is you let me know I charge you because if there is we need to obey it because I don't know it I don't see Paul ever changing his gospel it's always gonna be the same and he said anybody that would change any of it is cursed so that's why we just hope and pray those who are changing it they're doing it ignorant Lee and God will have mercy on them because we don't a real Christian doesn't want to see anybody go to hell doesn't want to see anybody lost doesn't see anybody cursed okay that's number six okay now number seven is the absolute I've mentioned this over and over again but let's read some specific quotes now when bro Graham says the absolute is the message of the hour you have to understand what he means because in the rapture sermon 1965 brother man tells us what the message is brother has sent a message of this hour what they are getting at is God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do and we see him scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do in the same manner so the message is God's Word that's being fulfilled right now if used if you mean that and say oh the message is the absolute then I agree because the scripture is the absolute but if you mean every word on the tape or every word in the book is the absolute that's wrong that's not true we saw that because not every word in the books is infallible okay so that's the important scripture there to share now let me read again he says I believe this is what the church their pastor teaches I mean everything by Bram says is thus saith the Lord this message has to be my absolute yeah okay so yeah that's basically the quote there now let me read you some quotes you've probably heard before I'm brother Branham but maybe some of you haven't this is from a absolute 1963 right before the seven seals he said it's gotten to a place like it was in the days of judges everybody has their own absolutely not the truth today everybody's got their own absolute but it all fails like the Pharaohs and so forth but God's absolute is his word he gives it and heavens and earth will pass away but it shall never pass away he said I like that so Matthew 24 is Jesus is God's absolute heaven earth shall pass away my word will never pass away now look my man says you he said you and I will come to shame if the word is not our absolute now what would shame be it'd be foolish virgin that'd be shameful or even lost like Judas if the word is not your final say the last word your rock your anchor your hope your trust your faith your hope and stay then you'll come to shame so here's what he says and if your absolute is some organization or some sensation or something else besides the person of Jesus Christ you'll come to the same portion of shame only worse see if your absolute is not Christ so see your absolute has to be the person of Jesus Christ and how is he revealed he's revealed through his word so is the Holy Spirit the absolute yes is the revealed word the absolute yes is the word the absolute yes but it's the Holy Spirit's interpretation of this word all right now pretty simple he said that's the only center post of the human life and Christ is the word not your church your word the word see upon this absolutely I'll build my church upon Christ the word amen so brother now it makes it he said it makes it a synonym to the revelation right because he said upon this revelation I'll build my church but program puts the word absolute upon this absolute so it's the revelation of God's Word is your absolute today amen hallelujah upon this absolute I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against this absolute hallelujah what we have said see he's dealt in every generation as we've studied through the Scriptures there's always one individual that he deals with because you get two men you got two opinions it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible and as pastor here the church he said my absolute is the word I know you our brothers you kind of look at me to be your absolute to what as long as I follow God as Paul said in the scriptures you follow me as I follow Christ so here's an interesting quote I want to bring this this is from church order December 26 63 brother Graham said the men in his church look to him as kind of absolute which I agree it's okay another word but brother branham is kind of like our last say on something like if I don't understand something I'll take brother branham's word we're over my thought many times okay but I'm not making brother branham equal with God I'm just saying I'm gonna just trust his opinion because he's a faithful man of God but he's not the absolute because there's only one the absolute that's the person of Christ so I call us sister Beatrice I call like this programs like a minor absolute I just say like that but the Hosea this this quote is saying he's just a human leader like Paul said in first Corinthians one be followers of me even as I also am of Christ so God gave us human preachers that we can follow and if they're the shepherd we want to be the Sheep right but we know the preachers are sheep to following the great Shepherd but God gives us a human man to follow with they're called pastors right so this is important to know about the absolute if Christ is not your absolute you'll fall into shame in your life and yes brother Ram can be like a minor absolute but the word is the major absolute like in the next week Lord willing next Wednesday if we can get to the believe the sign things I've already mentioned here about the bridge you know brother Han prophesied sixteen men fell there's no there's no newspaper articles about it some families that believed the message went and spent four months studying all the historical newspapers in Jeffersonville there's no record they left the message and cause many others to leave with them now in that case like I told you before whose word you're gonna take brother branham's word or the newspapers word so in that case I go to my minor absolute brother Jose you understand because the Bible doesn't say sixteen people were going to die right at the building of the high bridge so what am I going to take I'm gonna take the miter absolute because he taught so much of the word now say like this ninety five percent how much 98 percent of the tapes are correct you know whatever I'm just saying there's a major portion of the tapes are absolutely correct but there's a section that's human as I showed you through twenty some examples and I could do more for example let me give you another one marriage and divorce program said Jacob had at least more than twelve lives that's not true the Bible said he had four wives because Jacob's father law made him promise you won't take any more wives than the four that he had see there's another one you can't make the vow why I mean that that's foolish too to make every word thus they thought it's foolish it's a shameful thing praise God you know sit there and you know cheer and shout like they got something they haven't got nothing with their guys to open mine and they've got the wrong spear that's what they've got see now that's the point I want to make there if it comes down to brother Rams Word or some other man's word and they're gonna use this to say he's not a man of God then I'm gonna take the minor prophet miter absolute I'm gonna take the man who followed Christ in our day amen glory the man who manifested healings right like through our sister Humes praise God the man who taught the seals and they were different from any other man that have preached beforehand because they came from the person of Christ amen he didn't plagiarize Clarence Larkin he plagiarized heaven like Moses plagiarized heaven when he made the tabernacle God said make it after the pattern you've seen in the mouth praise God and the Holy Spirit said preach these seals like you've seen in the vision amen that's exactly right every Christian every prophet was plagiarizing from heaven praise God but I'm not using the word plagiarism in a negative sense now in a good sense because what good knowledge there's no man that was ever a godly man that ever made things up he tapped all of it from God the Bible said it was God breathed God breathed it down he was inspired by God the Bible said the prophets of old were moved by the Holy Ghost to write what they wrote praise God it wasn't the idea what good idea does man have what good idea that brother had to offer nothing we've seen many of his ideas he's a man I'm a man what good do any of us have our own ideas Ned but the word that he spoke from God that's our absolute praise God it's our absolute on on hair length and makeup and the fivefold ministry it's our absolute own holiness and godliness it's our absolute on everything is the word that God showed from heaven praise God because the Bible said but now God that God's Word is forever written in heaven amen it was written in heaven before is written on earth amen and we're just fortunate to be able to receive the word from heaven that God is revealed in this hour and we were so fortunate the lamb broke the seals and sent it down to earth amen hallelujah and now we can eat the open book and prophesy again hallelujah the people can't catch that they can't be born again because the book is the mystery of everything seekers even before the seals remember brother Aaron was mixing up the Baptism Holy Ghost but after the seals it's no longer a mystery it's revealed the new birth and the baptism are one of the same praise God no more confusion hey man all the mysteries finished hallelujah that's right thank the Lord now praise God what was my next thought I was gonna get to help it wasn't the tape boys I already preached that one there oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay thank you thanks for patience your house had to wait upon the Lord here okay the absolute I hope you understand I think you do I've mentioned it enough but I just want to read those quotes clearly so you can see it and then I wrote and said every believer can be the voice of God if you get so possessed he said with the Holy Spirit and you speak what God tells you to speak or just open your mouth and God start speaking you become the voice of God is there one prophetic voice yes the seven church age messenger the prophet of God Malachi 4 but each person can be a minor voice of God - okay God's absolute his word okay all right now number eight I would just call this the eighth problem is they just our name calling us right we've been called demas because Dimas Dimas left Paul and so they're saying Oh still preach they've left Paul for the cares and all the blessings of this world now no doubt some did like there's no no no doubt no doubt there's many preachers that have made hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars just by passing a message Church and they stop preaching the truth because they got tempted by money no doubt but not all of them not the real faithful ones praise God so no doubt there are some preachers I didn't do Adiemus they left the true preachings of brother Graham to compromise on God's Word but not the real ones and they call us make believer because we're not sure to be play tapes or not should the pastor preach is it'll be he'll be called lazy if he doesn't preach so that's a make believer so that's not true we're not and then we saw on Sunday we are called ears that can't hear that's what they were called because we can't understand that revelation 22:16 is saying play tapes in your church nonsense nonsense now here's the whole root of it Church here's the whole root of it and they were warned over and over again we're warned in the scripture the Bible says in first John 5:21 the Bible says little children keep yourselves from idols why would John spend this whole thing this whole book writing about love love love love love and is very some of his very last words keep yourselves from idols see because he was dealing with if you've got the love of God in your heart you're not going to love the things of the world the love of God is going to drive you deeper in love with Christ but if you don't get the love of God if you don't get born again you're gonna love an idol so that proves any person that believes these lies that we've been we've been preaching against they're not born again because they're a part of idolatry and idolaters were not inherit the kingdom of God and it's proven right there in Scripture I mean it's the last word yeah it's the last worse little children keep yourselves from idols amen so be it the the prophet of love we call him because he was a prophet st. John the Divine he ends that first but yes it's the last words 521 little children keep yourselves from idols so the God the man that knew all about the love the man that laid in Jesus bosom it says don't don't lay in any other bosom don't lay in Brother Rams bosom right remain in the bosom of Christ remain in the word of God so what is the root the whole root of this is idolatry and idolatry will keep many people out of heaven let's go to first Corinthians 10 again just to kind of reiterate this first Corinthians 10 now Paul goes through all the faults of Israel on their road to the promised land you know you remember fornicators I doubt there's of course we're gonna look at that now that they murmured all these things look at verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall so see we got to be constant by the hose Amy I'll be looking at our lives that God keep me from falling I know there's there's lions seeking to devour me I know Satan is shooting fiery darts at me Lord keep me from falling I don't want to fall into sin how many think you're standing how many are standing for Christ here tonight well you better take heed lest you fall see Paul never says I I'm so mature I never fall he never says it like that that's boasting that's pride but he said if you think you're standing take heed lest you fall verse 13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry I speak as to wise men judgey what I say remember church when Moses left the scene the Bible says what they did in verse 7 the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play when the Prophet all that's perfect for right now the Prophet left the scene right Moses left up into glory the cloud he left up in the cloud the cloud of witnesses and what the people do they made themselves an idol because they weren't in Jordan there they won't they won't they weren't crossed over Jordan right they weren't burned again they weren't circumcised like josh was going to circumcise them praise God so they ate and drank and rose up to play see same thing idolatry in church did you know even Jesus Christ had to battle idolatry Satan didn't even leave him out of it say and said here's all the kingdoms if you just bow down and worship me I'll give them to you right now so even our Lord Jesus he was tempted brother and said it was one of the hardest temptations right I'd like to have control right now I'd like to rule with the rod of iron right now I'd like to be in control but yeah he had to overcome that and he had to resist that spirit of idolatry see there's something in a man or woman right I just want to fall down and make it easy and worship something to make it easy rather than hanging on it and being true to God right so Satan tapped into that we're human want to just see that's what the people there in jeffersonville do they want to it's the easy way out just to say every word as I say though that's the easy way out they don't to answer questions I think you just say I believe what's on it and I got blind faith in it and I just believe it that settles it you know whatever they say prophet said it I believe it that settles it well yeah if it's thus saith the Lord if it's in the word but not every word so see they're taking the easy way out there's one a bow down and let someone take their worship instead of letting a christ change their hearts to help them to trusting Christ to understand the word not to trust in a man idolatry keeps many people out of heaven member those two tribes Dan and Ephraim their names are blotted out under heaven because of idolatry praise God program said anything that stands between you and God is an idol it takes the place of God but they have said you'll worship your pleasure you'll worship something because it's in mankind to worship that's why they've got to be careful we don't get too involved with the pleasures of life right we got to be careful we don't fall too much in love with you know technology or whatever food you know cares of the world things of the world riches you know we can't because whenever we take pleasure wherever we have the happiest and the best feelings that's what we're gonna worship if you have to make sure we bring the right attitudes here praise God we should have written of the the pleasure of a Christian is serving God in the house of the Lord that's the pleasure because whenever your greatest pleasure is in that's what you worship you worship your pleasure he said but when you make something your God when that's what you're depending on he says and then it's got to perish anything that perishes and that's a god it's it's wrong you can't depend on that we have to depend on something that won't perish that's the Word of God praise God but man stirred the world is full of idolatry idolatry is when something is placed in front of God praise the Lord now look what brother Aaron says he said the Catholic Church come out and made plain made it a plain Idol so at least the Catholics admit though they at least they bow down and kiss the statues but brother Aaron said the Protestants didn't do statues but remember the Protestant making an organization and it's just as bad because it denies the word that's what I believe it's happened in Jeffersonville now they might say the same thing about me but when they take their own creeds and take things that break the word of God like they get rid of the fivefold ministry or they exalt by the RAM and say every words infallible they've made a denomination and that is worse than the statues that's what Bob Ram says I'm sorry no just as bad rather I'm sorry just a man it's just as bad it's equal so the Devils laughing on both sides right he's laughing at the Catholics they're worshipping statues he's laughing at denominations because they're worshipping creeds and Jesus said in vain do they worship me in other words he's saying get back to the word you can only worship through the Word of God amen having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof that's right pleasures are often idols right any pleasure of the world do you remember Church in second kings 18:4 remember the brass serpent remember the brass serpent was once used for divine healing but after generations it became an object of worship second kings 18:4 and he removed the high places and break the images and cut down the groves and breaking pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made front of those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it and they called it he called it in a hushed an so can you imagine the brazen serpent imagined by the Prophet once held this people got here but after a while they started praying to that they started trusting in that right and so Hezekiah to come around so you don't burn prayers to the bracelet the brass serpent so he went install this this this beautiful artifact he went stopped instead it's just a thing of brass that's what nahusha means there's no virtue programs by Bors desk you can't lay your hands on the desk and get something out of that you're not there's no virtue in that there's only virtue in the Holy Spirit so any gift of God brother Brown says can become an idol if we're not careful but God will not share his glory with anyone or anything and I believe that's why this is happening why were having this huge divine this mass exodus out of the message I believe that's why we're having I got just got a couple more minutes here bear with me that's the reason because God has to yes to separate all those who truly want to worship Christ from all those who want to worship brother Branham that's why it's happening right believe the sign is helping us because they're showing us brother I'm Hugh manatee the jeffersonville is showing us what it's like to go to the extreme but the true bride will straight stay right in the middle of the road and they'll realize the brother brands not getting any glory he said he gets honor like all Christians get honor but he's not gonna get the glory the glory goes to Christ Jesus the church as time goes on we find out more and more about people right like Martin Luther he said awful things about Jews I was reading it this week he said awful things about Jews tohey he said in one letter to burn down their houses a man of God you know John Wesley he had a very bad marriage you know that he did not treat his wife very good and there was questions that he was he was so good friends with some other women in the ministry there was questions around him like what and the letters from him and his wife back and forth show there wasn't much of a relationship there and there's questions what kind of yet he get up at 4 a.m. and preachy all those sermons but it says closest friends were women that weren't his wife yet he was a true church a messenger see his time goes on see God is going to make sure that we see the human human part of people that we don't worship a man but we worship Jesus Christ Jesus Christ must increase praise God that's one thing we want in this church for all of us that fall more in love with Christ Jesus amen oh my see the Bible says he that plants and waters there they're not anything the Bible says that 1st Corinthians 3 the Bible said he that plants and waters are one but it's God who gives the increase brother Ram could not have any fruit to his ministry unless God gave him the increase praise God so that's why they can't get too excited about brother Brandon we love brother Ram we thank the Lord forum but brother Branham cannot give increase only God can give increase he did his part thank God like st. Paul st. John they did their part but only God can give the increase only God can give life I hope that's understood church I hope you understand and if I get misunder good then just please come ask me mercy I I'll try to take any question I can Lorraine said you can make an idol out of your church you can make an idol out of your pastor well I make so many mistakes I don't think you'd idolize me you can make an idol out of evangelist I'm afraid that that's what a whole lot is being done they idolize the man no matter who he is if he's God's servant respect them all the same everyone don't have one above another and favorites but how many people do we know that they have favorite preachers but the man who said don't never trust some man he said I don't care who he is if he's a holy man if there's no such thing let me crack that there's no holy man there's no holy church there's no such thing it's a holy God not a holy man it's the Holy Ghost not the holy man but the Holy Spirit working in that man the man will fail he's a failure to begin with anybody the greatest of men falls don't never put your confidence in some or makes a man your example look to God Christ is your example ah hallelujah now here's that story Church I mentioned a few months ago 1954 but man so there's a little lady who found his picture of the pillar of fire and bought a frame from a 10-cent store she was in the hospital and she was looking not at me of course but at the pillar of fire and this is her testimony the doctor gave her up to die she claimed that the pillar of fire come out of the picture and hung over her two days later she was dismissed from the hospital went home well see it was just her contact she just looked at that and believed now we know to look at that any other way would be idolatry see it's not the picture it what it represents he said you understand that so she looked at that picture so much so that pillar of fire became real according her testimony hovered over her now brother Bram didn't hover over her the Holy Spirit hovered over her but she said if he were if she were looked at that picture and just looked at how I loved brother Branham said would have been idolatry I just want to read that again so you're aware of that memorable Ram said shadrach meshach and abednego had to stand before that Idol right if they didn't do it they'd be persecuted that's the way the Gentile church was brought in that's the way the Gentile church will be taken out he said notice I hope you get this Daniel was silent letting they letting them they had to make their own choice in the day of going out the Gentile dispensation there'll be an image and everybody will have to bow before this image and do worship though be holy as ever you're not to worship an image image worship remember the Bible said King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worship Daniel in Daniel 246 after Daniel told me the vision they're all his dreams the Bible said he fell down and worshiped Daniel and the Bible said he commanded there should be an oblation and sweet odours unto Daniel see how it is the prayers see the prayers how they're going to Daniel see how the prayers were going to that brass serpent the RAM said this and another possessing the gate of his enemy in 1964 the Gentile race was brought in under the false side of worshipping an image of a man's the days of Daniel they came in worshipping that man image it goes out the same way when people will be forced to worship images of people it come in by revelation of Daniel being able to interpret the word that was written on the handwriting on the wall that's the way it come in that's the way it goes out the same way of the image of the Gentile hallelujah I think I'll stop there let's the end of our feet by God's grace I think I'll stop there is about 8:35 okay good praise the Lord case you pull up one real quick here first Corinthians 6:12 I had this in my notes here I think it comes down to this you know we are all under a certain power robe and said you're gonna leave the church fill with something and we wanted to be leaving filled with the Holy Ghost this scripture helped me overcome tobacco and cigarettes but I always look at it all things are lawful to me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of anything see you and I must make sure we're always under the power of the Holy Spirit right now that church in Jeffersonville they're under the power of a spirit of idolatry because you can't say every word he says is thus saith the Lord and not be under idolatry you can't it's impossible you can't change the word and make brother Brandon the absolute equal to the word without being under the spirit of idolatry now you and I as we close here you and I are probably not gonna get tempted by that spirit right but what could we get tempted by to make an idol what could we that's what we need to talk to the Lord about now if we're standing today Paul said take heed if you stand lest you fall we don't want to fall into any other idolatry we don't take any pleasure right in anything outside of Jesus Christ let's bow our heads here children if you come to the instruments here now remember what brother Graham said he said mothers when you're serving your children you're serving Christ right so when we have when we have love with our children and we have we have love in our homes that's not idol worship because it's God letting us enjoy those things Solomon call them the fruits of life enjoy the fruits of life so remember God will bring everything into judgment right let's ask the law to help us to see make sure we're standing because we do not want to fall [Music] let's just examine ourselves you know you know this morning I preached at the middle school and looked at that scripture examine ourselves whether we be in the faith oh it's always a great need a new church I examine our lives [Music] let's ask that question what pleasure are we running after we should be running out for the pleasures of serving God worshiping God and I got a fresh reminder Church I'm going to turn here roughly to feedings 5 remember Paul said the be not drunk on wine but be filled with the spirit number the very next verse so the first verse he mentions about being filled with all he goes is singing fusions 5:19 speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord let's make sure our pleasures and singing at home worshiping at home listen to the preaching let's grow in our understanding of this circuit growing an understanding and Buddhism acknowledge this seems that buzzer to make sure keeping I've built their lives Oh any pollution any wrong ideas won't destroy our lives let's examine our hearts your heavenly father I tried to treat you thank you for your strength tonight dear God thank you for all that we've heard Lord I know some of its sweet human if you want to just lay it in there Lord I know it's helping people here and it's helping people who brought about a message thank you great reminder snore lord I believe I'm standing for you the Lord may I take heed lest I fall to some [Music] make sure you love Christ most of the word the worship prayer the preaching love Christ the most that all your pleasures become lord help us tonight Lord God as we close our eyes bow our heads maybe lift our hands to heaven Lord oh god help us to worship you you only do let's take heed to our lives if we see a Idol rising up may we flee from it maybe we depart from it and then we run to the house of God we like to our Bibles we run to prayer or not it's so simple Lord it's almost too simple we know Lord you're always hiding in simplicity we thank you for that there's no excuses [Music] or the idols are so easy to fall into it would just fall on their knees give up the fight a wave of the effort into our Lord our Lord stood on it is written then us do the same stand on his word choose the harder way to his patients to is waiting choose obedience Lord bless your people here today we take heed in Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]
