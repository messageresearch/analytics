[48:09] was upon the face of the deep glad to
[48:12] see you brother and the spirit of God
[48:15] moved upon the face of the waters and
[48:18] God said let there be light and there
[48:20] was light and God saw the light that it
[48:24] was good
[48:26] and God divided the light from the
[48:28] darkness and God called the light day
[48:32] and the Darkness he called night and the
[48:35] evening and the morning were the first
[48:39] day amen Ezekiel 91 through1
[48:54] please
[48:57] he cried also in mine ears with a loud
[49:01] voice saying caused them that have
[49:04] charge over the city to draw
[49:07] near even every man with his destroying
[49:10] weapon in his hand yes and behold six
[49:13] men came from the way of the higher gate
[49:17] which lith toward the North and every
[49:20] man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and
[49:23] one man among them was clothed with
[49:25] linen with the writers in and they went
[49:28] in and Stood Beside the Brazen
[49:32] Altar and the glory of God of Israel was
[49:34] gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was
[49:38] to the threshing floor hold of the house
[49:41] and he called to the man clothed with
[49:43] linen which had the writers Inc corn by
[49:46] his side and the Lord said unto him go
[49:49] through the midst of the city through
[49:50] the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark
[49:53] upon the forehead of the man that that
[49:56] cry for all the Abomination that he had
[49:58] done in the midst
[50:00] thereof to the others he said in mine
[50:02] earing go ye after him through the
[50:06] city and smite let not your eyes spare
[50:11] neither

[50:16] and little children women but come not
[50:19] near any man upon whom is the mark and
[50:23] begin at My Sanctuary then they began at
[50:26] the ancient men which were before the
[50:29] house and he said unto them defile the
[50:31] house and fill the courts with slain go
[50:34] ye forth and they went forth and slew in
[50:36] the city and it came to pass while they
[50:39] were slaying them and I was left that I
[50:43] fell upon my face and CRI and said oh
[50:46] Lord God will I destroy all the residue
[50:49] of Israel in th pouring out of th Fury
[50:52] upon Jerusalem and he said unto me the
[50:55] iniquity of the House of Israel and
[50:57] Judah is exceedingly great and the land
[50:59] is full of blood and the City full of
[51:01] perverseness for they say the Lord have
[51:04] forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth
[51:06] not and as for me also my eyes shall
[51:09] spare not not spare neither will I have
[51:12] pity but I will recompense their way
[51:15] upon their head Behold a man clothed

[52:20] hallelujah Have Mercy In Jesus Christ
[52:23] name we pray amen amen may be
[52:29] see i' like to entitle my
[52:35] message age of the
[52:38] end sub topic I would like to work with
[52:41] would be speak to the
[52:45] darkness we notice in
[52:48] Genesis when God created all things and
[52:52] he
[52:53] began in the first chapter or first
[52:57] verse when he says God created heaven
[52:59] and
[53:01] Earth but if we look in those four
[53:03] verses God to the light
[53:06] amen he never speaks to
[53:09] Darkness but he brings a separation
[53:13] amen light from
[53:17] Darkness it is always been God's program
[53:21] Amen to
[53:23] separate it was was then and it is
[53:28] now it was God who spoke in the
[53:31] beginning amen that's right is that
[53:33] right the Bible said in the beginning
[53:36] was the word the word was with God the
[53:37] Word was God that same word became flesh
[53:42] amen right the Bible said he created all
[53:48] things he
[53:49] who the Lord Jesus Christ amen yes and
[53:55] from that point on God has
[53:59] Contin kept light and darkness from each
[54:03] other yes brother B said he is a
[54:07] separa sir yes sir he separate evil from
[54:11] good and good from Evil that's right you
[54:15] may have heard me say this before but it
[54:18] Remains the
[54:20] truth Jesus said that the church was the
[54:24] Sal right yes it was the
[54:29] preserver of
[54:32] life but he also said if the salt will
[54:35] lose its
[54:37] Savor what good is it right the only
[54:41] work in has is to be troden on the foot
[54:47] amen and thinking on that whale and that
[54:50] level amen I thought
[54:52] about as long as God's people people are
[54:55] in
[54:57] order yes the world will never be
[55:02] judged let
[55:04] me because the Bible First begins amen
[55:08] at the house of God
[55:11] Amen Israel would have never been judged
[55:14] amen if the church had remained
[55:18] clean yes sir
[55:20] Hallelujah and when I say that I just
[55:24] think about
[55:26] when God was getting ready to destroy s
[55:30] amen L and his crew that went down to
[55:34] Sodom would have
[55:36] stayed Sodom would have been spared amen
[55:40] but when the church goes corrupt amen
[55:43] amen y'all hear what I'm saying when the
[55:46] church goes
[55:49] corrupt then God judged the church amen
[55:52] and therefore by judging the church the
[55:55] world is judged
[55:57] amen see a sinner is a sinner amen sir
[56:01] and only a Sint can
[56:04] s come on some that's the words of your
[56:07] Prophet a sinner cannot sin he's a
[56:11] sin but it is of those who claim to be
[56:14] clean and Sanctified and holy they're
[56:17] the
[56:19] ones judgment begins with amen is that
[56:23] right God this before God even judged
[56:26] the whole of Israel he said start at the
[56:29] house of
[56:31] God why because it was there God knew
[56:36] that the standard children with hell of
[56:39] hell yes sir Hallelujah but when that
[56:43] standard
[56:44] go what good is it y'all hear what I'm
[56:48] saying listen God can't even destroy
[56:51] this world Amen until the bride is gone
[56:54] amen
[56:58] let's I'm going to hear myself I use the
[57:01] word judge but we understand what I mean
[57:04] I mean
[57:05] destruction because we're in the age of
[57:09] Destruction what's holding God back from
[57:13] destroying everything right now when
[57:15] everything
[57:16] is hallelujah it's you amen the Bride of
[57:21] Jesus Christ is the only reason this
[57:25] thing hasn't rolled into full
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:29] judgment the thing that gets me in
[57:32] Ezekiel whether Israel knew it or
[57:36] not the the job had already been done
[57:40] amen got the word of God and seen the
[57:42] vision the angel came back and said it
[57:45] was already done yes sir I already
[57:48] completed it
[57:50] ameno somebody even though it took
[57:53] hundreds of years before all of this
[57:56] came to pass amen it was already done
[58:01] amen look at when Titus came into
[58:04] Jerusalem yes and history tells us amen
[58:08] that God that that that that it was so
[58:10] bad to the people were locked in brother
[58:15] described it they they missed the
[58:17] message of Jesus they miss the message
[58:20] of the son of man Hallelujah he
[58:26] Hallelujah remember even Jesus said he
[58:28] said I would have I would have brooded
[58:31] over
[58:35] you
[58:38] myself so they rejected the day of their
[58:42] visitation amen sir is that
[58:45] right God will not judge before the
[58:50] warning there's always a warning before
[58:53] the judgment
[58:55] so we realize that here even in
[59:00] jerus I want you to understand this now
[59:03] people were saying I say you know I said
[59:05] when the people will literally be eating
[59:07] their children and everything else and
[59:10] you can almost here gasp in their spirit
[59:13] I said wait a minute now I said but you
[59:16] got to understand every time there was a
[59:19] major famine or some type of
[59:21] interruption wherein that men could not
[59:23] feed themselves and and provide for
[59:25] themselves
[59:27] Israel who were the children of
[59:30] God sought to eating their
[59:36] own come on now come on C Africa in
[59:40] South America it was in
[59:43] Israel is that
[59:46] right Solomon even had to deal with a
[59:48] case of it yes and you got to understand
[59:52] that this world is produc
[59:56] see cannibals amen oh people don't think
[1:00:00] so but all of these monster movies they
[1:00:03] bringing out and people eating people's
[1:00:06] flesh the devil is sewing
[1:00:09] seeds yes sir that's right oh come on
[1:00:12] somebody you better recognize what the
[1:00:15] devil is doing because you listen people

[1:00:21] pullit right than you and I
[1:00:26] he's got the
[1:00:28] television and he's preaching and sowing
[1:00:31] seeds all the
[1:00:33] time y hear what I'm
[1:00:37] saying yes sir to come to pass said not
[1:00:40] Satan's word yes

[1:00:46] throne throne of God come on somebody
[1:00:49] that's right did he do it yes has he
[1:00:52] done
[1:00:53] it brother bar said so in God of this
[1:00:57] evil age is that right that's right say
[1:00:59] the sons of God which is the church
[1:01:01] worshiping
[1:01:03] him oh come on somebody just pull help
[1:01:08] me I want you to understand there's a
[1:01:11] mass slaughtering coming and only the
[1:01:14] Bride of Jesus
[1:01:16] Christ will be the ones that will escape
[1:01:22] itj oh absolutely
[1:01:26] Matthew 25 tells about wise and
[1:01:30] foolish I don't necessarily have to read
[1:01:32] that but you and I understand those who
[1:01:35] were foolish thought and thought they
[1:01:37] had enough oil but the oil ran out but
[1:01:41] we're not talking about like I said last
[1:01:43] night you can have all kinds of gifts
[1:01:47] you can have every gift that God has but
[1:01:49] if you don't have Divine
[1:01:53] love
[1:01:55] nothing y'all hear what I'm saying I
[1:01:57] appreciate everything that God has
[1:02:00] given now you know what to call it's not
[1:02:04] something you could put on it's not
[1:02:06] something you could act into it is
[1:02:09] something that is divinely given to you
[1:02:12] according to your election see you must
[1:02:16] be elected amen receive
[1:02:23] div
[1:02:26] even so I find out that even Among Us
[1:02:29] that we we don't have a prayer life you
[1:02:32] know and my thing is it's not like like
[1:02:34] the brother said you you got to meet
[1:02:36] there every day at a certain time that's
[1:02:38] all good yes but the Bible tell us that
[1:02:41] we have to pray without
[1:02:42] ceas our prayer life should be going on
[1:02:45] 247 is that right oh yes there are time
[1:02:48] that you are to be on your knees or on
[1:02:51] your face in an intimacy with God but
[1:02:54] you should never ever stop praying
[1:02:57] amen hallelujah I remember uh brother
[1:03:01] Keith uh was uh getting ready to drink
[1:03:04] out of water fountain and at his work he
[1:03:06] began to pray before he drank the water
[1:03:08] they started laughing at
[1:03:11] him but I thought that's awesome yes
[1:03:15] amen how many of us pray about our water
[1:03:17] that's right Hallelujah and I always
[1:03:20] tell my wife and others if they're going
[1:03:21] to do something to us they're going to
[1:03:22] put it in the water amen that's true
[1:03:25] that's true because it's one of those
[1:03:27] things that you and I must
[1:03:31] have we we have we feel so secure
[1:03:34] because it's
[1:03:38] B doesn't keep turns
[1:03:43] away like you heard me say many times I
[1:03:45] believe in casting out Devils
[1:03:52] especially Hallelujah you and I must
[1:03:56] that the problem was that they one of
[1:03:57] the reasons why they they didn't have
[1:03:59] prayer amen yes sir and remember when
[1:04:02] brother preach statue of a perfect man
[1:04:05] hello y get quiet on that but you
[1:04:08] understand those virtues that God pulls
[1:04:11] up through you amen right you can't
[1:04:15] can't can't even work with that if it
[1:04:16] ain't in you amen Yes Y'all hear what
[1:04:19] I'm saying listen when it come to
[1:04:22] maturity you and I understand that you
[1:04:25] cannot add a cupid to your
[1:04:28] stature
[1:04:30] right well amen let me say it like
[1:04:35] this how many of y'all need more
[1:04:39] patience how you going get it amen but
[1:04:42] it's in the seed amen but how you going
[1:04:45] to get it you have to water it by way of
[1:04:49] prayer yes amen oh come

[1:05:10] one thing I desire amen yes sir one
[1:05:14] thing I desire and that is to be in the
[1:05:16] house
[1:05:18] of Hallelujah to dwell in his Temple
[1:05:22] yall so you and I realized that prayer
[1:05:25] is an essential thing
[1:05:29] right it sounds Elementary but that's
[1:05:32] okay amen prayer is an essental thing
[1:05:36] for you and
[1:05:38] me amen because when the foolish verion
[1:05:42] came to the wise brother said
[1:05:46] it the wise told the foolish amen yes

[1:09:41] I can weep before him but I'm not
[1:09:44] deceived I know what it's all about
[1:09:47] because we find out that Israel did it
[1:09:50] all they saw the pillar fire they saw
[1:09:52] the pill Cloud they saw the frogs and
[1:09:55] everything else that took place amen and
[1:09:58] they still denied the word amen oh
[1:10:02] come but there's a Joshua and a Cale
[1:10:05] able to look behind beyond the badger
[1:10:08] skin of Moses and they realized no man
[1:10:11] could do these
[1:10:15] things and they saw the god behind
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:22] the
[1:10:24] y'all hear what I'm saying we are
[1:10:27] blessed people on a course of

[1:10:35] of be this movie is coming out that

[1:10:41] destruction of the
[1:10:43] world Hallelujah if it ain't the
[1:10:45] destruction of the world the destruction
[1:10:47] of New York right or
[1:10:50] California they hit the head and the
[1:10:52] tail
[1:10:54] it's the TR and don't you know
[1:10:57] something's coming oh come on somebody
[1:11:00] that's how tius F
[1:11:03] Israel came a little while and then he
[1:11:06] left and they said well see the prophet
[1:11:08] didn't come through Hallelujah and and
[1:11:10] and what happened Israel relaxed they
[1:11:12] did us hallelujah 911 came and they hit
[1:11:15] us amen and that America has relaxed all
[1:11:17] over again bringing in the Muslims by
[1:11:19] the thousands Hallelujah I don't mean no
[1:11:24] they are
[1:11:25] wild the Bible said they will be hated
[1:11:29] in every
[1:11:30] nation it's just like the story when the
[1:11:33] man in the winter time a man picked up a
[1:11:36] snake it was frozen to death almost and
[1:11:38] he picked the snake up and put it in the
[1:11:40] bosom and said I'll take care of you
[1:11:43] Hallelujah all of a sudden when when the
[1:11:46] snake awakener came out of that thought
[1:11:47] position amen he be he began to lick his
[1:11:50] lips he got no lip but you know what I'm
[1:11:51] saying he began to lick his tongue and
[1:11:53] everything else and he was getting ready
[1:11:54] to bite the man or whatever he said you
[1:11:56] not going to bite me he said why not you
[1:11:58] knew I was a snake when you picked me up
[1:12:02] Hall tell the story just exactly right
[1:12:06] but America has picked up some
[1:12:09] snakes I don't care how M and you talk
[1:12:12] about saveing oh come on somebody I
[1:12:14] believe that the Muslims can be saved
[1:12:18] but don't you think it's going to be
[1:12:22] there Bible the only reason why I
[1:12:24] believe that is because the Bible said
[1:12:26] out of every nation Kindred and Tong
[1:12:28] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:12:31] but what we don't realize is that the
[1:12:34] devil has control of people I don't know
[1:12:38] how he's going it all together this
[1:12:40] cathol Hallelujah but she's the
[1:12:44] mother she's a ruler of all and when she
[1:12:47] began to speak amen they will become
[1:12:51] obedient amen that's right what you
[1:12:54] talking about this has nothing to do
[1:12:55] with what's written on paper this is

[1:13:20] years you put the people under spell and
[1:13:23] they don't even know it and they won't
[1:13:25] see it perhaps until they wake up amen
[1:13:27] when they wake up it'll be too late come
[1:13:30] on if they're not anointed by the Holy
[1:13:33] Ghost they are anointed by the
[1:13:36] devil

[1:18:16] yes
[1:18:17] Hallelujah yeah let me tell my testimony
[1:18:19] quickly is that all right yes because
[1:18:21] you know when they came to me
[1:18:24] excuse me I had a few troubles going on
[1:18:27] for maybe two years or so and uh I was
[1:18:31] concerned about it so I went to the
[1:18:32] doctor to see whether I can get some and
[1:18:35] uh the doctor said I think it was pts or
[1:18:37] whatever that level is and my blood was
[1:18:39] so low he said so high it was elevated I
[1:18:42] say so so high but it was elevated to
[1:18:45] signify that something was going on so
[1:18:47] he suggested that I go to this guy I
[1:18:51] forgot what they call what they call him
[1:18:52] I can't remember but nevertheless I had
[1:18:55] to who work with cancer of the prostrate
[1:18:57] and all that kind of stuff and he said
[1:19:00] the only way that we can really find out
[1:19:01] is that we do a biopsy right and so we
[1:19:05] went and I I wasn't certain about
[1:19:07] whether I wanted to do it or not I just
[1:19:10] knew one thing they ain't cutting on
[1:19:14] me and they ain't gonna do all those
[1:19:17] radiation stuff y'all hear what I'm
[1:19:18] saying I die like my mama my mama said
[1:19:21] the lord gave me this liver
[1:19:23] and if he don't heal it I'll die with
[1:19:27] it that's just the way I feel whatever
[1:19:29] he gave me if he don't heal it you see
[1:19:32] I'm not afraid of
[1:19:34] death since God saved me I'm not afraid
[1:19:37] of death Hallelujah so anyhow we we we
[1:19:41] went to the doctor and they did the
[1:19:42] biopsy and everything else and I noticed
[1:19:44] he stopped he was supposed to do he was
[1:19:46] supposed to clip 12 pieces and he only
[1:19:49] CLI like seven and he stopped
[1:19:53] so now that had me worried a little bit
[1:19:55] I never told I was concerned Why did he
[1:19:57] stop normally when they looking for
[1:19:59] something and they find
[1:20:02] something they
[1:20:05] stop because they don't want to make it
[1:20:07] worse y'all hear what I'm saying yes so
[1:20:09] that was my mind he he he didn't tell me
[1:20:12] but he it seemed like he that's how the
[1:20:13] devil fought my mind yeah oh yeah but I
[1:20:15] want you to understand when when that
[1:20:17] that man called me on the phone and said
[1:20:19] you got cancer he wasn't he been sparing
[1:20:22] me nothing
[1:20:23] you got cancer of the prostrate and it's
[1:20:26] aggressive and so therefore we need to
[1:20:28] do some some test on you to make sure
[1:20:30] it's not in your bones and all that you
[1:20:33] went through all the N yard and uh I was
[1:20:36] so shocked I started
[1:20:38] crying and uh my wife wasn't with me at
[1:20:41] the time and I started crying and called
[1:20:43] my daughter and she started crying and
[1:20:46] all the kind of stuff and I why I'm Not
[1:20:49] Afraid why am I crying the flesh amen
[1:20:52] amen no even Jesus
[1:20:54] wept you know he he wasn't afraid he
[1:20:58] knew already that Laz was coming forth
[1:21:01] say but that you and
[1:21:03] part so afterward I didn't feel so bad
[1:21:06] right and then my wife had already I
[1:21:10] think it was before then after whatever
[1:21:13] she told me she said God told me that

[1:26:06] devil trying to slip into a crack
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:15] that's take
[1:26:19] [Applause]
[1:26:21] the
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:30] speak to that Darkness y'all hear what
[1:26:32] I'm say I speak to that darkness and
[1:26:35] that Darkness had to
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:26:40] go you got speak to
[1:26:45] the not the teaching of Our
[1:26:48] Lord hallelujah he had the the children
[1:26:52] of the the the disciples with him on
[1:26:54] that boat he fell asleep and you know
[1:26:56] the story the storm came up and they
[1:27:00] they they awakened
[1:27:01] Jesus and said unto them care thou not
[1:27:05] that we perish why do you think Jesus
[1:27:07] had no idea that the storm was going to
[1:27:10] come but he was purposely doing
[1:27:13] [Applause]
[1:27:14] it amen God is always deliberate folks
[1:27:19] amen we may do things we don't mean to
[1:27:21] do but God needs everything he does
[1:27:25] y'all hear what I'm saying oh my God you
[1:27:27] got to understand like for instance I
[1:27:29] think Luke the first chapter Luke the
[1:27:31] fourth first chapter fourth chapter of
[1:27:33] Luke I believe it is six whichever it
[1:27:34] was but anyway here Jesus is into in the
[1:27:39] synagogue on the Sabbath day and now
[1:27:41] there come a man with a wed hand right
[1:27:45] and and all the Pharisees with their bad
[1:27:47] attitudes wonder whether he going to
[1:27:49] heal them on the Sabbath day right you
[1:27:51] think Jesus didn't hear yes that's right
[1:27:55] right Jesus heard what they said and
[1:27:59] Jesus didn't go over to the man with the
[1:28:00] withered hand and
[1:28:06] says no heal you he didn't do it guess
[1:28:10] what he did I want everybody
[1:28:13] toce hallu and he heal the the B said
[1:28:18] Jesus was
[1:28:21] angry
[1:28:22] angry at those heres and Sadducees
[1:28:25] because of their
[1:28:26] attitude he deler provoke
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:32] them hallu he didn't do
[1:28:39] it so whenever God does something he's
[1:28:41] always deliberate amen and when he
[1:28:43] allows something to happen to you he's
[1:28:45] always
[1:28:51] deliver
[1:28:53] is that okay nothing comes he taught us
[1:28:57] that by way of
[1:28:58] je God go fishing to get some troubles
[1:29:01] into your life
[1:29:03] amen oh my hallelujah amen yeah y'all
[1:29:08] think troubles just come God look at you
[1:29:10] say I know your heart and you doing
[1:29:13] pretty
[1:29:14] good going to stand under this tab I
[1:29:17] know you
[1:29:18] will but I I want you to see because I'm
[1:29:21] going take you to level see whenever God
[1:29:24] wants to bless you he always show you
[1:29:27] your heart amen amen yes he does oh come
[1:29:31] on a lot of Trials but at the end of all
[1:29:33] the trials you recognize there's nothing
[1:29:35] can separate me from the love of
[1:29:39] God
[1:29:40] all you realize one thing nothing can
