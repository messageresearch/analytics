keep our Bibles tonight by God's grace get right into the word of God here tonight praise the Lord like to uh continue Sunday night's thoughts let's go to first I'm sorry Samuel I'm sorry not Samuel Psalms 149 pardon me Psalms 149 Christ Delights in his Brethren i' like to continue on that thought for a little bit by God's grace I started out this week trying to study different things but I just kept coming back to that so well inspired by that just think what kind of a life we live if we knew every day how much Christ loved us praise God you didn't see God as a like a maybe a mean old kind landlord or something like that didn't see him as a uh you know someone to torment us or a slave driver but we just saw him with as a loving father like the scripture says he he is what kind of a walk could we have with the Lord amen I believe he's revealing us uh those things to us and helping us to walk that way praise God he's really helped me a lot you know show me the word and show me about legalism and things and how legalism is something excessive outside the word but just keeping the word itself that's love and so I'm seeing him in a greater way praise God very thankful for that Psalms 149 verse4 we'll just read verse four because I want to let's get right to the scripture here I won't be dealing much with this chapter I think we spend a little bit time on that on Sunday night look at verse four let's read it together if we can ready one two three for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation praise God let's have a word of prayer let's by our heads have a need on your heart just make it known un the Lord by raising your hand let's pray Heavenly Father we love you tonight thank you for your mercy and Grace Lord we're happy to be in your house Lord speak to us through Thy word though the way be thorny we'll Praise You Lord God Great Is Thy Faithfulness Lord thank you that we have the Holy Ghost keeping us alive in this hour Lord what a blessing thank you for your constant encouragement dear God and thank you that you take pleasure in your people you take pleasure in this Worship in this service tonight to the world no doubt it looks small maybe kind of quiet it maybe not uh something flashy maybe not up to dat we'd say in technology or or not Popular by any means Lord but Lord if we are worshiping you in you in spirit and in truth then truly you Delight in this Fellowship here tonight truly you Delight amongst us Lord God and you love us Lord one thing's for sure Lord as well we love you back you want to love you back the way you love us Lord help us Lord to see as a loving father as a husband as a friend as a brother Lord God help us to see that way as the scripture teaches in Jesus Christ's name the church said it amen God bless being see there praise God I guess I'll use the mic here by so I want to just quickly review a little bit on Sunday night we talked about how God takes pleasure in his people praise God Christ Delights in his brother uh we looked at how God takes pleasure in his people and we looked at how the Lord takes pleasure in them that fear Him remember in Psalms 147:10 so anyone that fears God God is very pleased with that uh the Bible says I was reading out of Proverbs 8 on Sunday night and the Bible says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil so when you see churches or anything or any message or not when you see any church that doesn't hate sin they're in some trouble they're in a backsliding condition they're in a it's an awful condition in a place where you don't hate sin anymore you don't hate evil uh sin should burden us sin should be hard sin should be hard to live with right there should be guilt we should be guilty if if in our hearts if we've made a mistake if we've sinned against the Lord the fear of God is to hate evil and God loves those who fear Him and then the Bible said I love them that love love me so so no doubt you know God the B the Bible say God has a love God so Lov the world he has a type of love and care for everything but he has a special kind of love for the elect or his Chosen and we'll get into that here tonight by the grace of the Lord God loves to be worshiped so much that he comes and dwells in the worship like tonight he comes and dwells in our Psalms that we sing he loves that he loves to be a part of that and then we showed how Christ rejoices over those who can receive the word the revelations that's in Luke 10 Jesus wept over his Earthly friend Lazarus uh he loved the Rich Young Ruler uh he loved to take children up in his arms and pray for them and bless them and hold them he loved those things we saw how God's love is greater than mother love so much so that he a mother might forget about their child a father might forget about his child but God will never forget about us because he wrote us on the palms of his hands praise God the cross speaking of the Cross and the cross proves he'll never leave us or forsake us because he died for us amen but then we uh spent most of our time on how the love of God if God loves you he's going to correct you brother B said not sometimes every time every time he's going to correct those he loves and that proves God loves us amen when he corrects us and we saw God expresses and tries to show us his love by giving us a type or an allegory of wedding so wedding shows us uh how how pure God's love is praise the Lord so uh we see a wedding will teach us that and Jesus gave The Parables of a wedding you know of having your lamps trimmed ready for the marriage and so forth and having to go out and have enough oil to go out and get in the wedding procession the other illustration Jesus gave was of having a wedding garment on you must have the right garment on you must be clothed uh with a spotless white wedding uh garment and then you're ready for the wedding praise God you must be clothed you must be have a special invitation you must be invited to come Hallelujah you've been invited here tonight amen to come and rejoice and worship and prepare for the marriage of the bridegroom Amen in Zephaniah 3 we saw in verse 17 how the Bible said he'll Rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing so God has the Angels Sing we know the Bible said they Rejoice whenever a sinner repents right the Angels Sing when we rejoice and no doubt Jesus loves our worship the Bible said in John 131 that Jesus loved his own to the very end praise God uh and if he loved his own disciples to the end if he's the same yesterday today and forever he has to love us to the end Proverbs 158 says the prayer of the upright is his delight and so what a blessing that is God Delights in our prayers here tonight amen he loves to hear us pray that's why even after service when we sing songs it's it's not a time to mentally check out say okay the preaching's done now I can just check out and you're ready to go it should be a time to pray and talk to him and apply what we've heard what have we heard uh the Lord spoke to me here the Lord spoke to me there now let's pray and make it right let's pray and worship him let's pray and thank him for what he's done what he's spoken to our lives because he Delights in that the prayer of the upright praise God I didn't have time to go through this like I like to but um I like to look at that here tonight let's go to Hebrews 2 let's go through these because we didn't have time I just mentioned them on Sunday night before communion when we prayed Hebrews 2 verse 9 let's go to Hebrews 2 ver9 but we see Jesus who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he might by the grace of God I'm sorry that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him who are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings how did Jesus get perfect through sufferings the things he suffered so if we want to be perfect if we want to be a complete Christian we have to go through sufferings as well and notice he tastes death for you which means this death is the death of course after you die physically but the death that separates you from God as far as the death that takes you uh to Hell we'd say or the grave it's also called the prison house right where all the lost souls go while they await judgment Jesus went to hell the Bible said right this is the death we talking about he tasted that he went to hell so we didn't have to that's love amen that's love he did the hard thing he did the awful thing he did the separation from God that we didn't have to amen so that's what that death is speaking of because because we know Paul died you know brother Randon died John died all the Matthew all the saints down Through the Ages you know polycarp and different ones down Through the Ages but he he tasted the death of going to hell and going uh uh amongst the souls that were lost the souls in prison he went to them and went that far thank God we don't have to go that far amen the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness verse 11 for both he that Sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all of One amen for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren so I just want to stop there that's what we ended on Sunday night because you let God sanctify your life and purify your life he can call you his Brethren he can call you uh he's my child she's my child she's my daughter uh and she he's not ashamed to do that amen kind like think about if you wash dishes or think about if you build something build something really nice when you get done with all those shiny dishes you're not ashamed to use them anymore are you my they're all cleaned out everything's nice or you build something my look oh it's all buil or like this room we painted this room cleaned out it was awful mess beforehand it was awfully dirty awfully uh just spiderwebs all over the place just aw place but when you're get done with it and it's all cleaned up and it's all shiny and it's it looks nice then you're not ashamed to be here are you right that's how Christ is the one who sanctifies and the ones that are Sanctified are one praise God they're one because they work together uh by God's grace so he's not ashamed to call them Brethren praise God saying verse 12 saying I'll declare my I'm sorry I'll declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee that's what Christ speaking of Christ that's a uh that's a prophecy from The Book of Psalms I believe chapter 22 if I'm not mistaken David wrote this uh and said in the midst of my brethren I will praise thee I'll declare thy name unto my brethren that was speaking of Christ Christ declared the name of God unto his Brethren unto the disciples unto the Believers praise God and so he's not ashamed to call them Brethren amen all right now let's uh let's keep going down I want to skip a few verses but let's go down to verse 14 for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil now we looked at that I think over Easter too and showed how what Christ destroyed was this was Satan's influence on you that is what's destroyed right because he conquered death Hell In The Grave Satan cannot have any influence on US unless we allow it is that right but that's what he did the Bible said it's destroyed it's a past tense he already destroyed Satan right he destroyed Satan's influence Upon Our Lives praise God that's what he destroyed now if we if we uh Harbor evil thoughts if we Harbor lustful thoughts if we live the wrong way if we neglect the word of God if we neglect it yeah then we let Satan's influence back in but Jesus has destroyed that and if we hold the power of the blood if we hold the holy spirit in our thoughts and our heart and our minds it drives away Devils it drives away evil does it not it drives it away right out of your presence amen and that's what he destroyed he destroyed his influence Satan's influence on the life of a Christian praise God now let's go back to Hebrews 11 here let's go here Hebrews 11:13 let's read this one here so there's two places in scripture where the Bible said he's not ashamed to call us uh Brethren Hebrews 11:13 is where we're let's read out of there by the grace of Lord all right now verse 13 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embrac them look at that just stop right there think about that they seen promises a far off Abraham saw Propet right he said I'm looking for a city whose's Builder Maker's God he seen it far off and he embraced it how do you Embrace a promise anybody know you Worship the Lord because of it right you receive it you say I'm GNA believe it you embrace it and then you act upon it I love that he embraced something invisible glory amen you can do that tonight aren't you embracing the Holy Spirit In Your Heart oh thank you Lord that you're in my life thank you Jesus for saving me from sin thank you that there's a Rapture coming I'm embracing that you don't see it right you don't see us physically holding something now we can hold our Bibles right that's good we can embrace our Bibles and say I love it but these that these Saints these early Apostles we'd say these uh Patriarchs of the faith they embrace the promises they held them with their hearts praise God which means they let it rule their life amen I like that they Embrace something that was invisible which is Faith embracing the promise of god let's finish 13 and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on this Earth You Don't Be Like a Stranger just go to the mall sometime right go to a uh go to a movie theater but don't walk into the M movies maybe don't go there at all but you know saying go to a a worldly event go out to a park or go to a sporting event or something like that you're going to find out you are a pilgrim and a stranger if you fit in with those kind of people something's wrong right if you can act like them talk like them get excited about like them dress like them right behave like them if you can uh in in ways like that act like that something's wrong we're to be pilgrims and strangers upon this Earth amen hallelujah verse 14 for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country so you got to say it with your mouth let's say it together let's say I'm a pilgrim ready let's say it I'm a pilgrim say I'm a stranger I'm a stranger the Bible said you must confess that they that say such things plainly say they're seeking another country let's say I'm seeking a country ready I'm seeking a country whose Builder makers God ready whose Builder makers God that's what these men and women did praise the Lord amen and say I'm not this is not my home I don't like living here so much I like to serve God I love the people of God I love the ways of God but this Earth this Earthly Cosmos this Earthly system with Republican and Democrat and or dictator nationalism or or republicanism or whatever more Republic uh demo Dem democracy this world system is not our home amen but there's coming a Heavenly system Hallelujah that's coming to this earth amen and that's our home but this Earthly system is not our home we're pilgrims seeking for a city that is to come verse 15 and truly if they had been mindful of that country from when they came out they might have opportunity to return now look they weren't mindful Abraham wasn't mindful of going back to Shan he didn't want to go back to Shina Moses didn't want to go back to Egypt praise God we do not want to go back to denominationalism right or worldliness right we don't want to go back there that's what they were like they were not mindful so we can't let our mind think about the days of the past of our worldly life or of our denominational life we can't let our mind rest on those things we got to let our mind look forward to the city whose Builder maker God right set our affections on things above amen see they might have returned had they kept their mind on that but they weren't mindful of that verse 16 but now they desire a better country that is a Heavenly country would you like to live in a Heavenly country where Jesus is the king oh my where he makes the rules and he's got a rod of iron right to lay down the law i' like to live that amen how do I know I like to live that because I'm living the way that way right now I'm living on this earth like he's already here praise God now he is here by the Holy Spirit I'm talking about the Corporal body we're living now like his Corporal body is already here amen which means we're living according to his laws Hallelujah now let's finish verse 16 wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God so because you're Desiring a Heavenly country because you're not mindful of your old life you used to live in sin and denominationalism all these things like that because of that now God's not ashamed to be your God you see you have to our lives must match Abraham and Isaac uh and Enoch and Noah and Sarah Our Lives just match theirs we must do the same thing they did forsake all the worldly things and live for a country that is to come amen for he has prep prepared for them a city amen he's preparing us a city now he said Hallelujah now let's if we can let's look at uh I didn't get to go over that so I want to make sure I go over that so you saw that uh God here uh is not ashamed to call us Brethren now let's look at a few scriptures here uh let's go to Mark 8:38 let's read that Mark 8 38 now this is right after Peter tells Jesus no you don't have to go to the cross and Jesus says get me behind behind me Satan now he talks about whoever will save his life must lose it but in verse 38 whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels amen hallelujah praise God see if we're ashamed here he'll be ashamed of us there but if we're not ashamed here he's not ashamed to call us Brethren praise God so it is our faith it is our life it is our choices and decisions that will get to I want to look at that in a little bit that prove that we love him and we know he loves us because he said so praise God now let's look at this quot I want look at this quote again I read this a few weeks ago adoption 1960 when did God choose us brother says when did God choose you that's got the Holy Ghost when did God choose you before the foundation of the world by his forign knowledge he foresaw you and know that you would love him amen now remember God gives us free more agency so God does not want to force anybody to love him and God will not force anybody to love him he wants people that will just choose to love him praise God so God the Bible said brother man said you know uh predestination looks back to forign knowledge for I looks back to Destiny and so for like that so God before the foundation of the world knew everything that would be knew all the people that would come upon the Earth and he knew which ones would love him so because of that for knowledge the Bible said he could pred predestinate so predestination looks back to forn knowledge right because he forew what you would choose he could predetermine what's going to happen in all of our Lives praise God that's right so see predestination looks back to for knowledge praise God and because he forew you he know that you would love him and before there was a foundational world he chose you and sent Jesus that he might be the propit of your sins to call you to reconcile ilation to himself to love oh he said wish we just had a few more minutes time we got a few minutes here tonight by God's grace Hallelujah so look the reason he he he uh he the reason he predestinated your life was because he knew you would love him now that's scripture as well so let's read 2 Thessalonians 2:13 let's read that 2 Thessalonians 21:13 and I remember reading this the first time with brother Simon I remember Simon showing me this in scripture I I just thought I never knew such glorious things I never knew the Bible said these things these things are precious amen as far as being saved before the or chosen before the foundational World your name was in the book of life before the foundation of the world you're chosen in Christ all these things I never knew these things as a Christian I went to church what two or three years you know trying to serve God before these things and just to see that the Bible says this what a what a what a rejoicing this is what a a privilege this is for us amen verse 13 to know that this is God's for know verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks all to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God had from the beginning chosen you when did he choose you from the beginning to Salvation he chose you to be saved amen through what sanctification of the spirit and and belief of the truth hallelujah so by those two things he said that he chosen you before the foundation of the world he foresaw that he that we would let uh God sanctify us and he foresaw that you would believe the truth you wouldn't just go to any church or you wouldn't just go to any place or you just wouldn't believe just any old wies tale or any old Papa's tale or whatever more but you would want the absolute truth and Jesus said Thy word is truth amen now I want to look I want to look at this I want to kind of turn a corner here let's go to Deuteronomy 7 here because last night Mal I at practice and the master you know he goes to church and don't over like that he looked around he said all the adults he said what's the very purpose of life and the first woman spoke up and said she said uh self-confidence being self-confident is the purpose of life be confident in yourself and I looked at another woman and the woman said she said oh to help others right Mal to serve others that's what this these two women said he looked at me and said Mr Smith what's the purpose of life I said to love God and keep his commands I thought my yeah that's exactly right and then they go on and and he even agreed with me later he said now Mr Smith he said he said Mr Smith was chosen he said we weren't all chosen to do what he was called to do remember that said that he said not everybody was chosen to do what he's called to do I thought my what a wonderful opportunity just to share with 10 or 11 people there that there is a purpose on this Earth and it's to love God love him love him right love him and keep his Commandments and Jesus said they said what's the greatest commandment to love the Lord your God to love him love with all your heart soul mind strength and body right like Jesus said that's the whole purpose of man and uh Solomon repeats at the end of Ecclesiastes they said the the whole end of man the whole duty of man is to fear God and keep his commands praise God but that's what this chapter is about Deuteronomy 7 is such a beautiful chapter I read the whole chapter today it's such a glorious chapter we'll just have to hit the highlights okay but God is telling them what they need to do once they get to the promised land and they kick out all these uh aliens we'd say in verse one it goes through all the aliens and in verse two it says don't deliver any of them kill every one of them uh verse three said don't make marriages with them verse four says uh if you do they'll turn your hearts away from serving God that's what happened to Solomon later on right it was kind of prophetic of that um and then in verse five it says destroy all their altars break down their images cut down their Groves and burn their grav and images with fire look at verse six verse six is where I want to pick up because we're talking about Christ the lights in US Christ Delights in US Christ could not Delight in the hivites right or the jebusites he could not Delight them because they wouldn't keep his word they wouldn't let his Spirit or his nature or his will be done and god is perfect and infinite so if God ever had a will it would be the best way right it would be the best thing but these return it down that's why uh God told Abraham they're going to dwell in Egypt 400 years and then come back and destroy the amorites because the cup of the amorites will be fulfilled in other words they won't repent for 400 more years I'll give them 400 more repent if they won't do it I'll destroy them and that's exactly what God did God always gives a space of repentance for everybody amen I believe that verse six for thou art and holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God had chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth look at verse seven the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of of all people I like that God's not looking at numbers tonight amen God's love does not go to the biggest churches although I hope it some people are saved there right just like I hope you know I trust God has saved us amen by his grace and mercy it's not based upon number or anything it was based upon this look at verse eight why did God set his love upon Israel because of verse eight but because the Lord loved you amen and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers that the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of the bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt so why did God love Israel because he swore he would to Abraham amen God swore I'll I'll love you and your seed just keep my word hallelujah you'll be my children and they say why did God set your love upon us because we are the Seed of Abraham and God loves us because the Lord loved you amen that's why you're a special people why are you special here tonight church because the lord loves you amen hallelujah and you're Abraham's seed and we'll get to a little bit how are you Abraham's seed because you believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah he's the Lamb of God he's the son of God who took away the sin of the world and he took your sin away when you repented and got baptized in his name amen that's how you are the Seed of Abraham amen he redeemed you he brought you back verse n know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the what the faithful God he's faithful tonight amen which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that what love him but he just got done saying because he loved you right but because the Lord loved you and now so see it's it's a give and take relationship God is not forcing you to love him you love him because it's just in your heart amen right it's in your heart you can't get away from it there's something in you that loves God Amen Hallelujah and so because of that he loves you back remember he loved you first right he loved you first amen Bible said he loved you first that's so he died for you while we are yet sinners Christ died for uh the unjust and the ungodly amen let's finish verse nine there he keeps Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations amen God so wants somebody God is searching brother the holy spirit is searching today for people that will love him he just wants somebody to love the word and people go to people go to churches and people people will condemn the Old Testament people will condemn the Abominations of the Old Testament and all kinds of things and it shows they don't love God they don't love the word we've got to love all the word and we got to keep all the commands of God now go on let's go down to a few more scriptures go to verse 12 wherefore shall come to pass if you hearken to these judgments and keep and do them that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which he swear to thy fathers verse 13 and he will love thee Oh My and bless thee and multiply thee he also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy lamb thy corn thy wine thine oil the increase of thy kind and the flocks of thy sheep in the land which he swear unto thy fathers to give to thee this is the Most Blessed promise how could you can you pick picture a better promise than this I can't if you just love God and keep his commands he's going to bless your family he's going to bless your job he's going to bless your home he's going to bless your land he's going to bless everything in church I'm a witness he has amen hallelujah if we just keep the word and love him just love his word just love him love his songs and love everything about him if we just love him he will love us back and bless us abundantly amen yes we'll go through trials yes we'll go through things that the trial faith and test us God allowed job to be tested but he always blessed us on the other end amen now I want to uh the rest of the chapter tells about how to how to love the Lord um in verse 17 and 18 how do how how will how will God kick out all these nations and God tells them to remember what God did before remember how God brought you out of Egypt in verse 17 and 18 so how am I going to defeat this how am I going to feed all these demons remember that God brought other people remember how far God's brought you out he's going to keep bringing you out now let me just stop right here remember this why am I reading this brother Jesse what does this mean brother brandom said this is a perfect type of the new New Testament Christian Israel taking the promised land is a type of you overcoming right now in the Holy Ghost baptism you overcoming this land right praise God it's a perfect type he says because uh Joshua is the first generation freshly Anointed The Holy Ghost freshly circumcised which type the baptism of the Holy Ghost the fresh ones that take the promised land and dwell there and live there that's a type of us getting baptized with the Holy Ghost with a first it's a first fresh experience where the first generation to do it right and go and take the land amen did my children remember what did uh what did the cross in the Red Sea represent yes baptism in water praise the Lord amen that's what the Red Sea represented washing of water in water baptism praise God what the desert represent Malachi or you remember what's the desert represent if justification was uh Red Sea what's the desert represent sanctification the second step of Grace okay then what did cross and Jordan represent CA and circumcision did it what it represent justification sanctification or baptism of the Holy Ghost BM of the praise God Amen let's give that two claps amen that's right that's right that's a perfect type of this right here that's why we're reading it because we get the same results right here if we put God first church if we really love God God will drive out all of our troubles praise God you can live above all these things but God said it's not going to be right away it's gonna be little by little and that's where we sometimes get discouraged but like I said which one of us how many of us have have God delivered us from cussing or swearing or cursing people or gossiping right or watching evil things or bad habits how many of us have been delivered from some of these things or dressing the wrong way right or looking at the wrong thing or all these demons have been driven out amen they've been driven out yeah there's more to drive out but look what's been driven out if you just love God and stay with him little by little you'll possess the land amen that's called being a complete Christian amen when all is driven out and you got Victory and you can walk in love and walk in the spirit you know sometimes we get we shouldn't get discouraged if we don't see gifts moving in our lives the main thing you want to see moving in our life is love amen loving God and loving others you want to see love because you can move all mountains with faith but if you don't have love it don't profit you anything amen like the Bible said you can understand all the mysteries of God and I've done that I preached all the mysteries of God before right because there's 12 of them I just said it to amen there's 12 Bible New Testament Mysteries I can preach all those Mysteries but if I don't have love in my heart for The Sinner if I don't love in the heart for denominational people if I don't have love if I wouldn't shake their hand and just try to encourage them to get in the message then it profits you nothing to hear the preaching but if I can do that in love then I've got something and that's what I believe I've got amen hallelujah I spoke into uh I spoke into infertility and the mountains moved Hallelujah I've spoken to other uh I spoken to kidney stones and the mountain has moved amen hallelujah but it's all about love behind it that's fine churches can do that that's wonderful we all enjoy that but who's got the love of the word behind it we must love him and we must love his nature his character Hallelujah verse 26 I want to read that one this is one where most this is the one we need to watch out the most now that we come in the message verse 26 neither now let you got your Bible okay keep your Bibles handy I want you to read for me because I got a lot of scripture tonight I'll read this one Deuteronomy 7:26 neither shalt thou bring an Abomination into thy house lest thou be a cursed thing like it but Thou shalt utterly detested and thou shalt utterly adore it for it is a cursed thing so that's why we don't bring Evil movies in our house evil music uh lustful clothes uh evil apps on our phones and tablets don't bring anything that's an Abomination into our homes praise God because the Bible says that will that will bring uh that will make you like it it'll cause that spirit will get on you now church I've known many preachers and the preachers that I've seen left the message are the ones who let rock and roll let their children listen to rock and roll some of them are some a few of them have told me that well I'm sorry told me that preached that they've even preached it for example their children weren't serving God yet so they let their teenagers listen to rock and roll on headphones or rap or whatever it was in their house as long as no one else had to hear it and but brother brandom said don't let any Trash come in the house he said kick all that rock and roll out of the house and since that Pastor this world world known worldwide Pastor would travel around preach around the world he's left the message don't even believe brother R was a man of God anymore really see because they start compromising they let abominable things in their house then he let his daughters and wife start cutting their hair wearing makeup and look where he's at now right that's that's how it is so you see we cannot even compromise on the word of God why because it lets evil spirits in if you let one spirit in then they're going to find another if you compromise on one thing it's easier to compromise on another thing right just like when you uh cast out one devil it's easier toast pass another out when you get victory over one thing it's easier to get victory over another right like I was like AA was scared of like I'll just use her as example she was kind of nervous about being baptized in front of everybody right but then so that but once she got over that nervousness once she actually got out in the water she said I wasn't afraid anymore see that that's fear the fear was trying to get on you but once you acted on the word of God and obeyed the word of God that demon of fear had to leave right that's right it has to leave when you when you when you take one step to obey God will meet you there and it's easier to make the next step like Jesus told Nathaniel he said he said oh I just told you you're under a fig tree and you believe I'm the Messiah he said you'll see greater things than this just hang around amen if you believe just by that you believe on the Messiah I'll show you greater things than that Hallelujah that's what he keeps doing so that's why I read this part of this chapter because this is a type God will drive out all all the all the the the trials in our lives all the Temptations If we just love him and try to destroy it and we cast out all these Idols praise God there's something about God loves violent Victory or something like that but God God didn't want them just to take the the idols and just throw them out there the Bible said throw them down and stomp on them that's why people you know in the days of brother BR they they would say they would stomp on Devils they pretended they were stomping on Devils right I don't know if that's real or not but uh there something about it God wanted them to cast down those idols and Destroy them and remember even grind them into powder and throw the powder into the into the river the streams God wanted them to violently cast it down that's why sometimes people get Victory when they scream and shout and they sometimes you know uh we you've seen demons cast out and women or men will scream I've seen that my dad's seen it we've all seen it uh different churches we've gone to why will they scream because uh they're screaming because that demon has to leave praise God they're screaming because the demon has leave uh now sometimes other people scream because the holy spirit's presence is so holy right and they scream because of that that's a good thing too so they might scream if the Demon's leaving because the demon don't want to leave or they might scream because God's presence is so holy and so powerful and it's so filling and indwelling them that they have no other way just to express it other than scream amen right but he wants to possess your house and he wants to have full victory in our lives amen and we are a type or Israel is a type of what we are doing possessing this body possessing this life amen now we're already okay let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 10 now just turn a few pages I just got to turn one page in my Bible Deuteronomy 10:15 so are my children there ready to read okay um Malachi can you read Deuteronomy 1015 and 16 only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more amen and just stop there and think about this God said to circumcise what their heart now they already had the law in Genesis 17 God told Abraham you and your seed all the males must be circumcised In the Flesh God is letting them know if you really want to follow me you got to have your heart circumcised praise God and circumcision is a cutting off of extra flesh that's not needed right it's not necessary it can be cut off and so that's what must be done to the heart all the fleshly desires of the heart must be cut off and done away with God's letting them know what is this ,500 years before before Christ came that the real circumcision comes by the Holy Ghost he's letting them know he knew they couldn't do it but he was saying you've got to have a circumcised heart because why because God was looking for not just a physical Nation he was looking for a spiritual Nation someone whose Spirit could be circumcised someone who would love him so much that they would want all anything contrary to God cut away removed from their life and then serving God in the beauty of Holiness I'll say like that okay now go to Gans 3:26 let's go there ldia can you help me on this one here's how we become Abraham's SE uh Lydia can you read 3 Galatians 3 26- 29 sorry children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you have beened Nei M fale are andr AB amen how many Abraham seed tonight you are if you have this faith in Christ Jesus your Abraham's seed right and what did God promis to all the seed if you keep my word I'll drive out all the inhabitants right I'll bless you if you love me right I Will Bless You Hallelujah go to Romans 2:28 brother amen can you read this 28 and 29 and then Malachi I never read after that but Romans 2:28 and 29 I just had to show this because God God put his love upon Abraham's seed but now we're Abraham's spiritual seed I just want everybody to see it plainly the scripture okay brother 2829 for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a Jew which is one and worthy and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not of the letter whose praise is not of men but of them amen praise the Lord hallelujah so the Jews are not just outwardly you're not a real Jew outwardly it's a Jew you're real Jew you're you're one of God's children right if you're circumcised on the heart right that's just playing through the script scripture and then if you are circumcised the Bible said praise is of God God Praises you what does he say how does God praise you he says well done th good and faithful servant right that's how he that person gets a praise from God well done good and faithful servant you are faithful with little I'll make you rule over much amen now um there's something the scriptures Colossians chapter 2 now okay Colossians chapter 2 let's go to verse 11 Colossians 2:11 now I read 11 and 12 please in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the Circ by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who has raised him from the dead amen so who circumcised you Christ did if you're in the Old Testament they had to go up to the priest and circum circumcise the baby on the Eighth Day right that's how their circumcision work but us when we believe in Jesus Christ and we get baptized we die to ourselves I'm not going to live for Jesse Smith anymore I'm not gonna live for daughters would say I'm not gonna live for Lydia I'm not live foration anymore I'm gonna live for Jesus that was your circumcision moment right when Christ circumcised the flesh away and you want to be a servant for God Almighty amen buried in baptism hallelujah amen I want to read verse 13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all your transgressions so it doesn't matter if somebody's not physically uh circumcised it must be the circumcision of Christ amen of the heart you're quickened by the word and he forgives you all your transgressions amen Hallelujah let's go to Jeremiah 9 I found this one day I just thought this was Glory glorious here Jeremiah 9:23 seemed like I I mean I've read this numerous times but seemed like it the first time I read it today I was like Wow praise the lord it's imp perfectly Jeremiah 9:23 thus sayith the Lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the Mighty Man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this so check these next words watch these next words so what should you glory in God God speaking through Jeremiah that he understandeth and knoweth me that I am the Lord which exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the Earth for in these things I Delight sayeth the Lord amen hallelujah well that's beautiful Church what does God what does God want you to be glory in now the Bible says the New Testament we glory in the death of Jesus Christ in the cross but of course this ties in with it right because you only know him the Bible said glory in that you understand him and know him praise God and what is God Delight in loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the earth praise God that's what he Delights in now verse 25 behold the days come I believe these days are right now because it's prophetic sayith the Lord that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised so God says there's going to come a day it don't matter if you're circumcised or uncircumcised verse 26 Egypt and Judah and Edom and the children of Ammon and Moab and all that are in the utmost Corners that dwell in the wilderness for all these nations are uncircumcised and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the what heart God said there's going to come a day where I'm going to judge everyone if they're not circumcised in the heart how do you get circumcised in the heart believe on Jesus Christ make him your savior amen serve the Lord and then get born again now acts seven you have to turn that act 7 verse 51 uh Stephen says ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye now notice when they heard these things in verse 54 they were cut to the heart and they nashed on him with their teeth now did you catch that Stephen said you're uncircumcising heart and ear but when he said that it cut their hearts so look they got cut but they didn't get cut all the way right other words they got convicted but they didn't let the conviction fully cut out and repent right that's I love that see when we speak the truth It Cuts Like a Knife and people get cut but you got to get circumcised all the way amen glory it ain't enough to get cut a little bit like they got cut to the heart it convicted them right but to be circumcised is to fully repent and say yes I'm wrong God forgive me and I'll change my ways I'll walk in the ways of the Lord praise God I believe that happened to our piano teacher that's what I believe with all my heart my piano teacher watch or our piano teacher watched my video on makeup in the Bible and when I made that video I was praying and fasting I was so meek and humble when I made that video and the piano teacher uh emailed me and said Jesse there's just something that I just felt while you were make while you were talking on that video there just something I felt I just can't explain it and I just don't like it and church I believe with all my heart it was conviction that she didn't like I believe it was so long since she actually been convicted by the real Holy Spirit preaching because they go to a a Presbyterian church and they they Don't Preach Holiness they can cut their hair wear makeup and go to movies and show show off their bodies and sexy clothing they can do whatever they want as long as they come to church and say I'm I I'm a Christian I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God they can do whatever they want and so the first time she said I don't know what I felt but I just didn't like what I felt and I thought that's the conviction of the Holy Spirit that's being cut by the word right and I said well show me a Bible a place in the Bible where a person can wear makeup and they couldn't show nothing they just said oh we're all one in Christ Jesus male or female they actually quoted Galatians 3 there and I said well that's out of context that's not talking about face painting that's talking about being the body of Christ but I can show you three scriptures about face painting that condemn it right so see that they have no place to stand and they get cut but they won't be circumcised God help us to be circumcised amen cut out all the sin cut out all the flesh let's let's uh enjoy the cutting of the Holy Spirit I know it's hard to say but let us enjoy being cut right by the Holy Spirit let's get a real circumcision not just a cut because they were cut but then they end up killing him right they were convicted but they resisted the conviction of the Holy Spirit they resisted the Holy Ghost and they didn't take on that conviction they didn't let it work its way to repentance and they took the stones and stoned him right and I've always like this I've always We Are Spiritual Israel right because our hearts get circumcised we're the people of God I've always just want to I always want to remind you this type here when I preach on Esther a beautiful type when Esther married the king remember Mori said don't tell that you're a Jew huah I just love the to me this is a simulation of Revelation amen that's why I laugh and I just I just getting hold Heavenly places here God Mori said don't tell uh the king hueras that you're a Jew right don't tell him so she goes there and everybody thinks she's a gentile oh she's a gentile bride the King married a gentile bride put away as he and married a gentile Bride on the seventh day right and when it comes down to it when it all comes down to the persecution and politics are going to destroy all the Jews the bride the Bride of the King goes into the closet right puts on her clly or king or I'm sorry Royal garments right all the white garments fast and praise she comes out and comes before the king without a command right and she says I have one request he said say it I'll give you half my kingdom she said I want to make a banquet to the king and so they have one banquet and the hymon comes everybody comes remember that and then she says okay Queen what do you want Queen Esther I want one more banquet right and then at the banquet now at the second banquet they say queen what do you want please tell me what you want and uh uh the queen says uh that our people are going to be killed and uh the king said who would do this and uh she said it's hmon who's sitting here and hmon reaches over there and touches the queen right and uh the king immediately gets him and hangs him and so forth like that what the Ty of the Bride of Jesus Christ when the political persecution starts coming down she's going to come out of the closet and show everybody whose sh side she's on and she's gonna show you thought I was a gentile but really I'm a spiritual Jew Hallelujah I'm Abraham seed in other words amen are you with me everybody thought and church we are Jew by the Flesh and everybody thought she was a Jew but when it come down to it she turned out she was a Jew Hallelujah she was a spiritual Jew and that's what we Are Spiritual Jews amen hallelujah to me that's a little Revelation that lays there in the scripture they thought she was a gentile but she turns out to be a Jew that's us we were uh we're Gentile but we're Jew by the spirit we're circumcised of the heart all the fleshly desires are cut away and now we serve Jesus Christ amen all right not going qu quite a far on that but let's let's go to Acts chapter 10 remember God Delights in all those who what fear Him let's go to acts 10:34 brother amen If You Could Read 34 and 35 you ready Peter opened his mouth and said I perceive that God is no respectful of person but in every nation he has fear and work of righteousness is accept amen I believe that's right Peter preaches there on Corel say Housetop and he said now remember that the Holy Ghost hadn't gone to the Gentiles yet right and they thought well Gentiles are unclean they're not going to serve God they had these wrong ideas they didn't realize the prophecies in Hosea and Isaiah and different prophecies where God was going to reveal himself to the Gentiles and they're going to be part of the the one body the one family so Peter gets up there and the Holy Spirit led him up there by a vision and he starts preaching and he said no matter what nation as a person is in as long as they fear God God will accept that person praise God as why why will God accept anyone that fears him because God Delights in those who fear his word right that's what the scripture says God loves anybody that loves him amen anyone that wants to obey his word and respects God and knows they're God somewhere God will receive that person whether they're foolish or wise God will accept them amen because the fear of God is to hate sin and now notice they work righteousness so see their faith just doesn't say well I believe in God and they work evil but the Bible said they fear God and work righteous so they let their faith go to work God will accept anyone in any Nation who fears God and acts upon their faith and does good for other people amen and how does faith operate by love so see take it take it back they got the right works because they got faith and they got faith because they got love and they got love because they fear God if you take it all the way back we have to fear God we have to respect that God is in heaven he's above all he knows all he's in all he's allowed all this to happen he's allowed us to be here it's got to go all the way back to fearing him loving him that we have faith in him and our faith causes us to work for him hallelujah amen now let's go to uh 1st Samuel 15:22 this is a familiar scripture most of you know I'll read it and Samuel said hath the Lord has great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams so now we see another principle does God Delight as much in just religious works or obedience to what he said obedience so you must fear God and then you must obey his word exactly what he said and he'll Delight in that he gets light when you take his word say I want to obey all the word I want to make sure I'm obeying all the word now church this is not legalism because Jesus obeyed every word right and he wasn't a legalist right he wasn't a law he wasn't a law a person that added on to the law right he wasn't a lawyer or something like that he was just a son he was a beloved Son that loved the father and kept his word so see God has Delight in those who hear the voice of God remember Saul did most of what God Said remember Saul killed most of those I forget which country it was amorites I can't remember now which one I can't remember what was it Amit thank you he killed most of them but he kept the king and he kept all their good animals to sacrifice so he kept what about 80% 90% of the word God didn't Delight in that God wanted 100% of the word right obey my voice if I tell you this then it's got to be done see God's not leg remember legalism is excessive adherence to the to the Commandments of God so it's doing something excessive okay it's not it's it's going beyond what the word says it's adding to the word or taking away but if we just do what the word said then we are Delight unto God Amen brother BR said this and why Christ speak 1959 God had called Moses a special calling and when God calls a man and anoints him for a special Duty he expects that man to carry that out to the letter God doesn't want to give a man a commission and him hum hul around about it anybody been huming hum hul rounding about obeying the word of God a hum haul I don't know if I'll do it or not I don't know if I'll obey God's word today h i don't know if I'll do this like I told God I would H H I don't know if I'll do this what God told me to do you don't want to hum haul around and be kind of wishy-washy you want to obey what God Said right if Saul would have did that he would have been king forever God said so if he would obeyed the word of God he would have been king forever but because he only obeyed 90% God was displeasing and what does God have delighted a religious work 90% or obedience God Delights in full obedience to the word of God Amen brother brand said when he got a vision in South Africa in 1952 to go to deran South Africa he said I learned I must strictly obey God remember he let the ministers take him to places other than Duran and God let him get sick for eight months of his life he laid in a bed in 1952 you can look at it on the tapes there he doesn't have sermons for certain months because he disobeyed the voice of the Lord amen so God help us said I got to strictly obey the lord well we got to strictly obey but strictly doesn't mean legalism strictly just means obey all of it okay obey all of it it's not legalism it's not legalism it is O full obedience to the full word of God because Jesus said the Holy Ghost will guide you into some of the truth no all the truth in John 16:13 now I read this on uh I'm gonna read again Proverbs 8:17 I love them that love me now turn to John 1627 you got your Bibles John 16:27 wisdom loves those who love wisdom and Jesus says in John 16 I love those who keep my commands I love those who love me John 16:27 Mal can you read that please sir for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and I believe that I came out from God Amen says the father loved you because you love me see it's a reciprocal relationship ship that's why God loves us right because we love him back and if we love him we'll keep his commands let me read this what brother B told Brother Neville taking sides with Jesus 1962 he said I want to encourage you brother Neville now brother Neville is the pastor be courageous no matter what comes up or what goes what takes place just don't let nothing beset you just stand there Like a Rock of Ages and God will make everything turn out all right amen hallelujah he's proved that to you so I just want to encourage you with that when things come up just stand there on the word like the Rock of Ages because he is the Rock of Ages and be like him right be our another Rock of Ages standing on the S Rock you're a chip off the rock right amen butam says this in a man running from the presence of the Lord I listen to this this week or last week about Jonah he says how wishy-washy that's what too many Christians they are so soft soaked in everything until they think all they do is join a church and go in somewhere put their name on a book or do a little something jump up and down shout or something like that and they call it Christianity Christianity is an everyday rugged life living for God in the presence of the world it's a constant burning of the fire and love of God in your heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with the people and making converts to Christ amen hallelujah amen that's a real chrisan amen somebody that just doesn't come to church to Go Through the Motions like Saul just don't go through the motions but do all the word let the word burn as a fire in your heart and do something about other people try to save them I've been calling texting some of the people that haven't been coming lately I finally got a call back from one of them they wanted to come to church today but I had my phone off and missed their call so they already were headed home but Church even though they don't even though they don't contact me back all the time keep reaching out keep contact them keep telling them you love them and you'll pray for them will you do that find somebody on your contact list that you want that you feel a burden to go after praise God and try to make a convert to Christ invite them to church tell them you're praying for them tell them you're thinking about them that's how you win to Christ is be salty praise God show that love and they'll get thirsty if you're salty amen now here's how one thing I want to share too God Delights in Mercy let's to Micah 7:18 I'll read this one because is out Micah okay Micah is after Jonah Micah 7 oh no yeah Micah 7:18 yeah who is a god like unto thee that pardner iniquity and passees by the transgression of the remnant of his Heritage he retaineth not his anger forever because he delighteth in Mercy he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou will cast all their sins in the depths of the sea thou will perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham which thou sworn of thy fathers from the days of old you're a child of Abraham are you not you believe the Bible he will perform his promises to the Seed of Abraham what is it he Delights in having mercy upon us don't feel defeated don't let Satan tell you oh God won't forgive you all these things God Delights in Mercy amen if you Delight in him and love him he'll love you hallelujah amen I want to um I need to close here pretty soon um so I want to come down to just a few more thoughts let me see yeah let me close with this um okay go to Psalms 374 it's kind of like a good Bible study here tonight by God's grace I just spent all morning I got to the church here about 7:00 a.m. or maybe 7:30 I just studied all morning got home about 1 or two and uh just like a great big Bible stud this morning so I really enjoyed that hope you're enjoying it here tonight psalms 37:4 this is a scripture we hear often but I want to to show how the Bible says how you will Delight in the Lord the Bible says if you Delight in the Lord he'll give you desire of your heart well all of us have desires right I could ask each one of you after service sister Naomi sister haa brother amen what are the desires of your heart and you might name some pretty pretty uh maybe uh powerful things right I desire to see this happen I desire to see that happen and we're all praying for those right the most important ones are salvation of souls more than money more than homes More Than Cars whatever what jobs all these things the greatest thing you can desire is souls to be saved to the kingdom of God is he that winth Souls is what a wise virgin the Bible said he that wins Souls is wise and wisdom is the greatest thing right above all rubies above all things get wisdom and wisdom says win souls amen Glory Hallelujah okay psalms 37:4 uh Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thy heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass we every every loves that scripture every church I ever been to loves that scripture but they don't connect how the Lord is the word right the full word right so if we Delight in the word we have to Delight in the word he'll give the the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass you know like I told you you know when Simon and I first got in the message we believe this for our family and now my brother Cam's a pastor God brought him in Sister Betsy uh she's uh married to one of the deacons in Cam's Church faithful House of God Paul got saved and he's he's still battling he's not full fully uh believing but at least he goes to message church I got one more and my two parents that are left by God's grace one more sibling brother and then my parents we're still believing God for them uh and I sent my dad a video of my two daughters being baptized and I don't think I told the girls at but he told Simon tell Jesse I really like that so Grandpa love that Grandpa's going to do it one day Lord willing he's he's 6 what he's 66 this year yeah be's 66 this year but God's still able amen God called Abraham at 75 amen I I I believe it like that I just got of keep confessing and keep believing and may God have his way but if you Delight if you delight in God now we just show what what God Delights in God Delights Delights in fearing right if you fear him if you obey him God Delights in that but we have to Delight in the Lord we have to commit our way to God that means everything you do every decision you make about family every decision you make about church about God the job all these things your home commit every way to God and we can't commit something to God that's against his word we must obey the word of God commit your way to God trust also I trust him that he'll give me desires of my heart I trust him that if I pay my tithes and offerings he'll help me to pay the rest of my bills I trust him right you have to trust him with everything trust in his word his word says this I believe it that settles it he shall bring it to pass now now later in the chapter let's go to verse 23 later in the chapter it talks more about delighting in God the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He Delight in his way so see when you walk in God's steps he Delights in your way he's happy about your walk when you walk walk in his way so those you've been baptized in Jesus Christ's name he's Delights in that now Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost now filled with the Holy Ghost go towards adoption right order your steps in the word of God and God will Delight in your walk with the Lord hallelujah verse 24 though he fall anybody fall this week anybody make a mistake though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down even though if I fall I won't stay down I'll get back up I fall we all M sakes the righteous fall seven times the Lord lift him up right though you fall you're not utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand amen the hand of the Lord reaches down if you make the wrong step he'll pull you back amen but you got to just repent and get right back with the word right where he asked you to go amen H Allelujah now let me just read a few more scriptures here let's go to Isaiah 58 I thought this was a little bit uh I felt a little bit inspired by this this weekend some brother's been contact I told you a brother been emailing me about battling homosexuality from overseas and and he said he was fasting and praying yesterday and today I think for deliverance and I'm waiting to hear a report but he said uh pray for me so I sent the scripture I sent the whole chapter out Isaiah 58 Isaiah 58 is about getting your heart right with God and delighting yourself in the Lord and the way to do it is to do it the way God commanded through um turning from Evil and go turning unto God let's read verse one and two Isaiah 581 and2 cry aloud spare not now he's talking to Isaiah lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression in the house of Jacob their sins now stop right there does everybody like it when the preacher will come and Shout out the S you're battle with does anybody like that probably not right but that's what God told a prophet to do show them their sins that's why it's hard church when I know even even even if I know of even if I don't know people are sinning it's hard to tell them they're sinning and they're Sinners but God calls preachers to do that right show them where they're wrong that's what God told Isaiah show them where they're wrong so they can get right if they don't know where they're wrong how can they get right preachers have to show the people their transgressions it's not easy I hate to do it I hate to condemn makeup or people that cut their hair right when they're sitting right in service I hate to do that of myself but God con strains me to do it I have to do it it's the word I have to stay with the word because you hate to hurt people's feelings of your own human feelings right well ra said he wish You' have to preach these hard things but he had to because it's God's Commission Now verse two yet they seek me daily Delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their God they ask me of their ordinances of Justice they take Delight in approaching to god let's get down to verse 13 God kind of rebukes them for not fasting the right way he kind of uh says they're they're fasting for selfish reasons now verse 13 if thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath of delight the holy of the Lord honorable and shall honor him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words now look what they would do on the Sabbath remember the Sabbath day was to go was to rest from all your works and go to the the synagogue and hear the words of God but Israel was just going through the motions they were keeping the Sabbath but they were just saying what they wanted to say they were in other words the word wasn't having an impact on their lives it wasn't impacting them they would say what they would do what they want they would take pleasure in everything else except the the church service right that's exactly right every everything else was more pleasurable than the actual thing that was supposed to be pleasurable which was the word of God now verse 14 if they turn away then shalt thou Delight thyself in the Lord the Bible says delight yourself in the Lord how do you how do we Delight ourselves in the Lord take pleasure in what God takes pleasure in make God's word God's house God's songs make that your pleasure don't let anything else be more pleasurable than the things of God in other words make Church the highlight of your week praise God make Church the highlight of make this the time you look forward to make this your expectation listen to sermons to build up to the church service pray to build up to the church service make this the highlight of your life delight yourself in him when you make God your number one then you're delighting yourself in the Lord you're saying his words you're praising him you're thanking him you his day is Holy the word of God is a holy thing it is a glorious thing honoring him verse 14 and I cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord that's spoken unto it that is true this is all true this is what happened to me God's allowed me to ride on the high places and Heavenly places and also hide in Plains and travel overseas and have great meetings and all these things like that this is true this is a reality God will let you ride upon the mountains he'll give you great victories right great victories in your life great things you I never thought I would cast out demons ever I never thought I'd ever see that but God allowed me to do it I never thought I'd see Miracles but God's allowed me to see them why because we make him number one we if you Delight in him he'll give you the desires of your heart and what's our real desires to have eternal rewards which are Eternal Souls Souls being won for the kingdom of God praise God oh my I'm just not sure how I'm ever GNA finish this I'm not gonna let's stand our feet here I'm not gonna finish all this I want to read one more thing here Psalms 1119 is the longest chapter in the entire Bible I want to read verses 173 and 174 as we close here psms 119 173 praise God Psalms 119 173 let thine hand help me for I have chosen thy precepts I want to close this chosen what have you chosen this week what are we choosing David says let your hand help me because I've chosen your precepts I've chosen to walk the right way I need your help Lord he's ask God to help him because he's chosen the pass of God 174 I have long for thy salvation I'm longing for you to come and deliver me you answer my prayer oh Lord and thy law is my delight praise God the law of God is his Delight now brother Brandon said this brother brandom said that Danny Henry after he preached this sermon if you some you know the story he's preaching in like a kitchen or a restaurant and Danny Henry was a a man who uh was related to a famous person I can't remember it now Danny Henry come up and laid his hands on brother Braham and said that was so beautiful he said he said that could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation and there's only 22 chapters so basic was saying you just preach like you were a prophet and brother BR said Danny Henry spoke in an unknown tongue uh and then he said there was three people that gave interpretation of that unknown tongue and uh one of them was in French and there were a couple other ones he said in all three interpretations all said the same thing here's what it said because thou Hast chosen the Narrow Path remember David said I've chosen your precepts you have to make the choice to delight in God you have to choose to make God more delightful than other things in our lives the Holy Spirit told Brother BR because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast walked in your own choosing see well right now you're walking your own choices aren't you glad you chose to come to church tonight I'm glad I came I chose to come here you're walking you will we we will walk in our own choosing in other words we will uh reap the the fruits of our choices the seed the fruits of our seeds that we plant lives the Holy Spirit tells brother B thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine amen hallelujah I want to close with that by God's grace chosen I chosen thy precepts and the Holy Spirit encouraged his brother brandom in 196 well I think it was earlier than that but encourage him you've chosen the right way but it's the harder way and because of that a huge portion of Heaven awaits you and because he chose this it will bring to pass a tremendous victory in what the love divine what is love divine the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ in US the hope of glory because brother Ram chose to walk the narrow road now love divine is getting a great victory in my life Hallelujah love divine should be getting a great victory in your life right but you must choose the Narrow Path the harder way as David said Lord help me now I've chosen your precepts I'm longing for your deliverance oh Lord and your law is my delight praise God let's bow our heads here as we pray here how many want God to be delighted in their in their walk with the Lord how many raise your hand and say that my hands up as well you can put your hand down church I think all of us desire that If we're honest with ourselves we need to fear the lord if we're going to make if we're going to be his light we must fear Him and we must choose his precepts remember what the scripture says the scripture said though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand praise God if that's you tonight you feel utterly cast down you feel like you've Fallen take courage tonight

in my members he said oh Wretched Man that I am a man who' cast out demons a man that had cast a season of blindness on a man on a man before a man that had been raised up after being stoned and
