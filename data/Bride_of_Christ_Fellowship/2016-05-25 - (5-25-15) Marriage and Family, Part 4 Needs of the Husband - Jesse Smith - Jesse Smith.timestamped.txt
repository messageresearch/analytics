[15:55] have a little prayer time right now for
[15:57] those live streaming uh
[15:59] uh our family is only family here right
[16:01] now um so I think we just might as well
[16:04] pray for a little bit and sing a few
[16:06] songs by God's grace because most of the
[16:08] ministry will be going to the live
[16:10] streamers also my voice is quite tired
[16:13] so I'd like to maybe just pray a little
[16:16] bit and uh kind of take it easy on my
[16:18] voice a little bit so kind of like a
[16:20] prayer meeting tonight we'll begin with
[16:22] and maybe sing a few songs and we'll
[16:24] preach the word of God tonight by the
[16:26] grace of the Lord uh so Mal can turn on
[16:30] the music just a little bit it's a
[16:31] little bit
[16:34] here so we have numerous prayer requests

[16:45] more that's good thank you so I'd like
[16:48] to read the list and then we'll just uh
[16:50] enter into Prayer by God's grace and

[16:55] these uh first I'd like to pray for um

[17:45] forth we can pray for the married
[17:46] couples and uh singles in the church as
[17:49] well and the young children as they're
[17:51] growing up that God will teach them
[17:53] wisdom through these messages and help
[17:55] them to make the right decisions that
[17:56] the Lord carries that their marriages
[17:59] will be blessed because of the word of
[18:01] God also we'll pray for those who left
[18:04] the message that God will soften their
[18:06] hearts and they'll soften their hearts
[18:08] to the word of the
[18:09] Lord and I thought we could pray for
[18:11] Israel as

[31:20] God that those seeds would fall on good
[31:23] ground Lord as we're taught Lord that
[31:26] the ground was prepared for the
[31:27] foundation of the world so Lord we're

[51:19] praise God let's take our Bibles tonight
[51:20] by God's grace thank you
[51:24] Lord let's open Ephesians chapter 5
[51:27] tonight Lord willing I'd like to speak
[51:29] on uh marriage and family part four uh
[51:32] and the reason is because I'm not going
[51:33] to be preaching for about two weeks uh
[51:35] because this Sunday I'm out next
[51:37] Wednesday we have the anniversary
[51:39] meeting starting and then this about
[51:40] that Sunday I'm still not preaching so I
[51:42] won't be preaching for two more
[51:43] Wednesdays so I thought I'd like to
[51:46] finish what we started on Sunday we had
[51:48] the women's five needs so I want to look
[51:50] at the needs of the husband tonight by
[51:52] God's grace needs of the husband
[51:55] so we want to look at that by God's
[51:57] grace so Ephesians 5 verse 22 is where
[52:00] we'll start Ephesians
[52:02] 5:22 I really believe this is applicable
[52:05] for everyone as we were praying earlier
[52:07] I don't know if everybody heard the
[52:08] prayers but it just kind of
[52:10] was uh made real to my
[52:13] heart um no matter if you're single or
[52:16] married these things can help us out
[52:19] extremely well uh if you're married they
[52:22] help you learn to serve your spouse
[52:24] better learn to love your spouse better
[52:26] and help you to see what or how your
[52:29] spouse can love you better and you can
[52:30] communicate that to your spouse because
[52:32] a lot of times the reason marriages are
[52:34] struggle is because they don't people
[52:35] don't communicate the way they should
[52:37] they keep things in and they don't talk
[52:39] about things and uh sermons like this
[52:42] when you bring out the word and the
[52:44] quotes of the Prophet it helps you to
[52:46] really see how we're supposed to live
[52:47] our lives and hopefully that will cause
[52:49] couples to talk about it but even the
[52:51] young ones and the single ones you know
[52:53] for the young ones there might be a few
[52:55] few years off being married but this
[52:56] will plant the teaching in their heart
[52:59] uh that they'll need later on if Lord
[53:02] should carry and they do get married for
[53:04] the singles it's very helpful uh because
[53:07] they can prepare their hearts and for
[53:09] everybody it's helpful because we can
[53:11] pray for each other doesn't the Bible
[53:12] say we should pray for each other
[53:14] absolutely pray for all the saints so we
[53:17] want to do that by God's grace so
[53:19] Ephesians 5:22 there these are all
[53:21] extremely helpful for us all by God's
[53:24] grace
[53:27] so I want to read 22 down to
[53:29] 24 wives submit yourselves unto your own
[53:33] husbands as unto the Lord for the
[53:36] husband is the head of the wife even as
[53:38] Christ is the head of the church and he
[53:40] is the savior of the body therefore as
[53:43] the church is subject unto Christ so let
[53:45] the wives be to their own husbands in
[53:48] everything let's bow our heads word of
[53:50] prayer here by God's grace let's ask God
[53:52] to speak to us through Thy word you you
[53:53] know your heart just make a known God
[53:55] God sees all the needs Heavenly Father
[53:58] you see Lord our heads bowed you see
[54:00] Lord those that are here Lord and those
[54:02] live streaming we thank you Lord for all
[54:03] the saints that are hungry to hear your
[54:05] word tonight speak to us Lord these are
[54:08] important messages Lord we know they are
[54:10] because a Christian must Express the
[54:12] love of Christ in their home Lord what
[54:15] good is it to do to come and just love
[54:16] people at the church if we're not loving
[54:18] people at home that we live with Lord we
[54:20] should live such a Godly life before
[54:22] everyone Lord especially in the home
[54:24] Lord that we can reverence one another
[54:27] truly honor one another make it a
[54:30] reality Lord may you become so real to
[54:32] us in our homes Lord and on our jobs and
[54:34] when we have family time lord may you
[54:36] become so real that we are careful what
[54:38] we say careful how we treat each other
[54:41] because we're recognizing you're there
[54:43] Lord and also you're the one who created
[54:45] these uh family members these spouses
[54:48] lord they're your creation as well Lord
[54:51] most importantly so father help us
[54:53] tonight teach us through thy Spirit Lord
[54:55] this Thy word help me to be faithful
[54:57] witness in Jesus Christ's name everybody
[54:59] said amen God bless you being and see
[55:01] there praise the
[55:04] Lord so we like to look at uh the needs
[55:08] of the husband tonight by God's
[55:12] [Music]
[55:15] grace like to finish uh the thoughts
[55:18] from
[55:19] Sunday I really appreciate everybody's
[55:21] patience on Sunday it was really really
[55:24] great to finish that for
[55:26] me and I do have the the quotes I want
[55:30] to show everybody the quotes I just find
[55:32] it really helpful don't you do doesn't
[55:33] it help you to see brother bram's quotes
[55:34] you know and then see the scriptures and
[55:36] talk about it so it's very very helpful
[55:38] by God's
[55:40] grace so I'm just going to review just
[55:42] real quick um not much at all hopefully
[55:45] just a couple minutes so this is part
[55:47] four I want to look at the needs of the
[55:48] husband uh so on Sun On Sunday it was
[55:52] the needs of the the wife so I was
[55:53] really preaching at the brother so
[55:55] tonight I want to tell those sisters all
[55:57] right know those that are live streaming
[55:59] so forth uh really take these things to
[56:02] Heart uh and talk to your husbands and
[56:04] see you know what do they need most uh
[56:07] of these
[56:08] needs um just like you know the brother
[56:11] should have should have heard Sunday and
[56:13] they should have went home and talked to
[56:14] their wives and said you know honey how
[56:16] can I love you better uh how can I meet
[56:19] more your needs what do you need what do
[56:20] you need more for me do you need more
[56:22] time or conversation or what do you need
[56:24] from me so let's just review real quick
[56:27] uh from Sunday uh there's five major
[56:30] needs of a woman and these we all have
[56:32] quotes for all these but I'm not going
[56:33] to take time to go through the quotes if
[56:35] you want them I can send send them to
[56:36] you I think two people requested the
[56:38] quotes from Sunday so that was really
[56:39] nice and I sent those to two families
[56:41] there by God's grace so um now remember
[56:44] this is from a a Christian uh counselor
[56:48] who's counseled a thousand couples and
[56:51] uh I wouldn't preach this unless it was
[56:52] in the Bible right I wouldn't preach it
[56:55] unless brother brandom said it okay so
[56:58] brother brandom said all these and we
[56:59] saw them on Sunday okay so here's the
[57:02] woman's needs uh she has need of
[57:04] affection brother Brandon said to hug
[57:05] your wife he said kiss her uh uh when he
[57:10] would pray for his wife he would have
[57:11] she he'd be rubbing her back or have his
[57:13] her back rather and have his hand on her
[57:15] back and praying for her while he wash
[57:17] dishes or whatever he would do to help
[57:19] out she needs affection she needs hugs
[57:21] and and kisses and all those things like
[57:23] that
[57:25] okay she really needs that okay number
[57:27] two is openness and honesty the Bible
[57:30] the Bible condemns all line and uh we
[57:32] all know it's in us to want to hide our
[57:34] sins because of what Adam and Eve did as
[57:36] soon as they make a sin they go hide
[57:37] instead of run to God but David said
[57:40] I've not hid my sin remember that and
[57:42] then he could be forgiven then God can
[57:44] heal the person or forgive the person if
[57:46] they don't hide their sin but a woman
[57:49] especially needs a husband to be open
[57:51] about the future plans and what he's
[57:53] thinking and to toally honest why does
[57:56] she need that because she's got to have
[57:57] the mind of her husband because the
[57:59] bride has to have the mind of
[58:01] Christ amen that's why she needs to know
[58:04] the plans of the brothers she she needs
[58:06] to know what what his thinking is and
[58:08] he's my head so I don't have any thought
[58:10] but his right so she needs to know that
[58:13] and he needs to pray the man needs to
[58:15] seek God like we said with Ezra and
[58:17] different examples in the scripture they
[58:19] need to seek God for the will of God for
[58:21] their family and then share that with
[58:23] their wives after praying and being led
[58:25] to the Lord it has to be done she needs
[58:28] to know what he's thinking he's always
[58:30] got to tell the truth if not he becomes
[58:33] untrustworthy and uh leader got to be
[58:36] trustworthy we've been looking at that
[58:37] at school at school we're teaching on
[58:39] American heroes and they Define what's a
[58:41] hero someone who's trustworthy
[58:42] responsible someone who lives their life
[58:44] for others that's in our textbook which
[58:46] is really nice it's eternal life is
[58:48] living for others amen so that's what a
[58:50] man needs to be brother BR said a man
[58:52] needs to be a hero he said be a hero he
[58:54] said be always be that Gallant boyfriend
[58:56] right so that's what we need a men to be
[58:58] need men to be that okay brother yeah uh
[59:02] the the the counselor said conversation
[59:05] brother Ram said that he said How's your
[59:06] wife going to know you love her unless
[59:07] you don't sit down and talk to her about
[59:09] it he said if you got a disagree me he
[59:11] said sit down talk about it try to
[59:13] understand one another and we know women
[59:15] are more uh linguistic you know more
[59:17] conversational so men need to understand
[59:19] that men you know might get tired of
[59:20] talking but they need to make time and
[59:22] talk to their wives just like brother
[59:24] brandom said sit down and understand he
[59:26] said especially when they get to their
[59:28] menopause time he said that's when the
[59:30] women really need your
[59:31] attention Okay when they can stop having
[59:33] children their their hormones start
[59:35] changing their body start changing
[59:37] brother R said that's a time you need to
[59:38] really be in love really got to be a
[59:40] gentleman he said gotta make sure she's
[59:42] your sweetheart at that time amen all
[59:45] right now the last two are kind
[59:48] of well I guess the last one is most
[59:50] obvious but yeah family commitment this
[59:53] is where she needs a woman needs a
[59:55] husband to be the spiritual leader of
[59:56] the home he's got to have family altar
[59:58] brother brand said the man's got to
[1:00:00] start the family altar he's got to be
[1:00:02] the one praying he's got to lead his
[1:00:04] wife in prayer he's got to teach the
[1:00:06] children and we showed scripture on
[1:00:08] Sunday about that God told Moses to tell
[1:00:09] the men to teach the children talk about
[1:00:12] the word all the time while they're
[1:00:13] sitting up while they're rising down
[1:00:15] while they're sitting down at the table
[1:00:17] uh put the scriptures on their foreheads
[1:00:18] on their doorpost talk about the word
[1:00:21] everywhere and she needs a man that's
[1:00:23] committed to her family he's needs he
[1:00:25] needs to be there to train the children
[1:00:27] uh to teach the children uh he needs to
[1:00:30] be there to love his wife of course and
[1:00:31] be committed to the family you can't
[1:00:33] just say I don't want to spend time with
[1:00:34] my family I gotta go do what I want to
[1:00:36] do brother R said God first family
[1:00:39] second and you
[1:00:40] last so if we believe that is scriptural
[1:00:43] which I believe it is God is first
[1:00:45] family's next because the man's got to
[1:00:47] serve the family he can't get all caught
[1:00:49] up in his hobbies and hish what he wants
[1:00:51] to do his selfish desires he's got to
[1:00:54] put that last and he has to have family
[1:00:56] before that he's got to be committed to
[1:00:57] the
[1:00:59] family okay last but not least financial
[1:01:01] support uh a woman needs a man that will
[1:01:05] work hard brother M said he told uh
[1:01:08] Hope's father you know that he would
[1:01:10] work till his hands bleed in order to
[1:01:12] provide a good home and a good life for
[1:01:15] Hope and and Charlie said yeah I know
[1:01:17] you'll do that you know you certainly do
[1:01:19] that he said just treat her right and
[1:01:20] love her and don't mistreat her and he
[1:01:22] said I'll do my best to work hard and to
[1:01:24] love her and always be faithful to her
[1:01:27] amen okay so those those are pretty
[1:01:30] obvious so these are this this is what a
[1:01:32] woman needs and if a man does this
[1:01:34] they'll always be sweethearts like the
[1:01:35] Bible said the Bible said they should
[1:01:37] always be ravished or intoxicated or
[1:01:39] basically in love they should always
[1:01:40] have that honeymoon type of feeling
[1:01:42] that's the scripture that's Proverbs
[1:01:44] Chapter 5 that that is scripture they
[1:01:46] should always be in love okay now let's
[1:01:48] look at that's that's my review that was
[1:01:49] five minutes so that was real short okay
[1:01:51] so let's go to the the the five needs of
[1:01:53] a man so so I hope our sisters listening
[1:01:56] tonight and those here uh can really
[1:01:58] benefit from this as well by God's grace
[1:02:01] now I got the order up here like this
[1:02:03] here's the five order um I'm not going
[1:02:05] to go through this in this order though
[1:02:07] I'm gonna I'm going to go with respect
[1:02:09] and or submission first then I think I'm
[1:02:12] G do uh companionship domestic support
[1:02:15] I'm gonna end with these two physical
[1:02:18] intimacy and physical
[1:02:20] attractiveness okay this is what a man
[1:02:22] needs here okay now and remember like
[1:02:25] like the author said this is what I want
[1:02:26] to do when I I finally get to preach to
[1:02:28] you in June on a Sunday uh I want to
[1:02:31] have the the couples take a few minutes
[1:02:32] after the service after prayer time and
[1:02:35] I want to have them take a few minutes
[1:02:36] and go through these and kind of rank
[1:02:37] them and see what's their most important
[1:02:39] need so the man might say well maybe
[1:02:42] this is my most important need or maybe
[1:02:44] that's my most important need um but I'm
[1:02:46] gonna say this for for
[1:02:48] brothers uh for brothers I think that's
[1:02:50] the number one need that all Brothers
[1:02:52] had because that's what Paul said Paul
[1:02:54] said wives submit to your husbands
[1:02:57] that's the first thing he mentioned
[1:02:58] right there so the most important thing
[1:03:01] I think to a man if we could call it by
[1:03:03] scripture would be submission a woman
[1:03:06] who's in subjection a woman who will
[1:03:08] follow the man and not try to lead the
[1:03:10] man that's what I believe is the most
[1:03:12] important uh aspect of it now a lot of
[1:03:16] men might say you know physical intimacy
[1:03:17] because of how they're built you know
[1:03:19] their passions and things like that but
[1:03:21] I really feel like scripturally we can
[1:03:23] make a strong case that submission is
[1:03:25] the most important thing that a man
[1:03:26] needs from his
[1:03:28] wife
[1:03:30] okay all right so let's go through these
[1:03:32] you got your Bibles ready Mal already
[1:03:34] got your Bibles ready okay all
[1:03:38] righta sorry I don't want people to read
[1:03:40] unless they're comfortable but I know
[1:03:41] Malachi and I will read by God's grace
[1:03:43] anybody else can read if they want okay
[1:03:45] let's start with respect or submission
[1:03:47] now the author actually calls it
[1:03:50] admiration okay so I could have put that
[1:03:52] word up here as well admiration a man
[1:03:54] needs to be admired which in this case I
[1:03:57] believe the Bible word would be a better
[1:03:58] word would be submission he needs uh
[1:04:01] submission and respect he's got to be
[1:04:04] respected U because that's how God made
[1:04:06] him now here's the scriptures let's read
[1:04:08] each of these by God's grace Mali can
[1:04:11] you get first Peter 36
[1:04:15] please and I'll read Ephesians 5 22 and
[1:04:19] 24 again okay I believe this is right
[1:04:22] out of the scripture this this this
[1:04:24] counselor you know he counsel these
[1:04:25] couples he's a Christian and uh he
[1:04:28] teaches these and I think the Bible
[1:04:30] already taught him before he figured it
[1:04:32] out and I think brother Brandon taught
[1:04:34] it before he figured it out as well I
[1:04:36] really believe that for all my heart so
[1:04:37] we're just teaching what the Bible said
[1:04:39] and what the prophet said because they
[1:04:40] both
[1:04:42] agreed okay 522 wives submit yourselves
[1:04:46] unto your own husbands as unto the Lord
[1:04:47] now notice your own husbands uh you know
[1:04:51] sometimes I've seen this I've seen it
[1:04:52] you know I'm not going to no one here in
[1:04:54] this church that I know of but I've seen
[1:04:57] other marriages where a husband will get
[1:04:59] jealous of their wife because uh the
[1:05:03] wife is listening to another another
[1:05:06] husband more now that husband might be a
[1:05:09] pastor or preacher or might just be a
[1:05:11] close friend of the family and sometimes
[1:05:14] uh I've seen that where uh husband and
[1:05:16] wife you know they're divided because
[1:05:18] the wife actually respects and submits
[1:05:20] more to another man who's not even her
[1:05:22] husband okay that's real dangerous
[1:05:25] because the Bible said that she is to
[1:05:26] submit to her own husband as unto God
[1:05:30] okay and so women need to if they're
[1:05:33] doing that they need to repent of that
[1:05:35] and submit to their own
[1:05:37] husbands okay now verse
[1:05:39] 24 uh therefore as the church is subject
[1:05:42] unto Christ so let the wives be to their
[1:05:44] own husbands and everything so that
[1:05:45] means everything now I got a quote for
[1:05:47] you later so listen I got a quote where
[1:05:49] brother Ram said the wife doesn't have
[1:05:51] to obey the husband if he tells her to
[1:05:53] break the word word so I want you to
[1:05:55] know that the scripture says in
[1:05:57] everything but that means everything the
[1:05:58] word says because if a husband says
[1:06:01] honey you need to steal this or honey
[1:06:02] you need to miss church honey you need
[1:06:04] to stop reading your Bible brother Bram
[1:06:05] said you can tell that woman can say no
[1:06:07] yeah now there might be repercussions
[1:06:09] where the man might get upset and he
[1:06:11] might leave her but brother R gives us a
[1:06:13] scripture for that okay so while the
[1:06:16] Bible says in everything what Paul means
[1:06:17] of course is everything that's Christian
[1:06:20] everything that's the word okay because
[1:06:22] we cannot forsake Christ in the word in
[1:06:25] order to please husband or wife if
[1:06:27] they're contrary one to another you
[1:06:29] understand that but in a Christian
[1:06:31] relationship they should all be in
[1:06:33] harmony the husband should not be
[1:06:35] contrary to Christ and the wife should
[1:06:37] not be be contrary to Christ they should
[1:06:38] all be in unison and so if that's the
[1:06:41] case it's easy for the woman to submit
[1:06:42] to the husband because it's as if she's
[1:06:45] submitting unto Christ okay so you read
[1:06:48] 1 Peter 3:6 and Lydia can you get
[1:06:50] Proverbs
[1:06:52] 31:12 okay to share the Bible okay
[1:06:54] that's fine so Malachi 1 Peter 3:6 even
[1:06:58] as Sarah oyed Abraham Abraham calling
[1:07:01] him Lord whose daughters ye are as long
[1:07:04] as you do well and are not afraid of any
[1:07:06] amazement okay so we can see that Sarah
[1:07:09] was the example Peter gave she called
[1:07:11] Abraham Lord she called her him my ruler
[1:07:15] okay and she submitted she obeyed
[1:07:16] Abraham If Abraham said we're going here
[1:07:18] yes honey yes Lord yes honey yes my
[1:07:21] ruler uh she just obeyed and the Bible
[1:07:24] said she's in the Hall of Fame of Faith
[1:07:25] because of that and the Bible said
[1:07:27] Christian women should be the daughters
[1:07:29] of Sarah they should obey their husbands
[1:07:32] they should let the husbands Rule and
[1:07:35] the husbands should lead by example of
[1:07:37] the Holy Spirit okay lady can you turn
[1:07:39] to Proverbs
[1:07:41] 31:12 got it okay thank you can read it
[1:07:43] whenever you're ready she will do him
[1:07:45] good and not evil all the days of life
[1:07:48] okay she will do him good and not evil
[1:07:51] see that's that's respect right
[1:07:54] that's respect that's submission that's
[1:07:56] admiration that's a man's first need a
[1:07:59] man's got to have respect he's got to
[1:08:01] have admiration he's got to have
[1:08:03] submission and a real Holy Ghost filled
[1:08:05] wife will do that she'll do good to her
[1:08:08] husband all the days of her life if she
[1:08:09] makes a mistake of course you'll repent
[1:08:11] just like a man might make a mistake he
[1:08:12] might not love his wife right right one
[1:08:14] time well he should repent of that
[1:08:16] praise God he should be a Christian and
[1:08:18] then they're not hold to our account
[1:08:20] anymore if we confess that they're under
[1:08:21] the blood of Jesus and Jesus don't see
[1:08:23] any more okay all right thank you now
[1:08:26] I'm going to read Genesis 3:16 let's
[1:08:28] turn there if you got your Bibles
[1:08:29] Genesis 3:16 and we'll read it by the
[1:08:32] grace of the
[1:08:33] Lord and then Malachi can get 1
[1:08:35] Corinthians 11 1-3 11
[1:08:39] 1-3 that okay all right Genesis 3:16 I'm
[1:08:43] read that one this is right after the
[1:08:44] fall and unto the woman God said or he
[1:08:47] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:08:49] and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt
[1:08:52] bring forth children and thy desire
[1:08:54] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[1:08:56] rule over thee so obviously you know
[1:08:58] this is God commanding Eve on how to
[1:09:01] honor her husband because she her desire
[1:09:04] wasn't to Adam at first her desire was
[1:09:06] to The Serpent and right after they
[1:09:08] partook of the fruit now the serpent
[1:09:09] already got to an
[1:09:11] offspring he said to you and your
[1:09:13] Offspring I'm putting enity between you
[1:09:15] The Serpent and your seed and her seed
[1:09:18] so as soon as they partake of the fruit
[1:09:20] they have Offspring they have children
[1:09:21] so the fruit had to be adultery we know
[1:09:24] that's the
[1:09:25] scripture okay
[1:09:27] so uh verse 16 said now Eve your desire
[1:09:32] has to be to your husband because it
[1:09:34] wasn't at first it was to The
[1:09:36] Serpent and he shall rule over you so
[1:09:39] God said the man's going to rule over
[1:09:41] because you were deceived in the
[1:09:43] transgression and that's in 1 Timothy 2
[1:09:45] I believe verse 11 I'm not
[1:09:48] mistaken okay so Malachi can you read 1
[1:09:51] Corinthians 11 1-3 go ahead whenever you
[1:09:53] write
[1:09:55] followers of me even as I also of Christ
[1:09:59] now I Praise You Brethren that you
[1:10:01] remember me in all things and keep the
[1:10:04] ordinances as I deliver them to you I
[1:10:08] would have you know that the head of
[1:10:10] every man is Christ and the head of the
[1:10:12] woman is the man and the head of Christ
[1:10:15] is God Amen okay so there's the
[1:10:17] submission aspect woman is under the man
[1:10:20] man is under Christ and Christ is under
[1:10:22] God okay remember God is the invisible
[1:10:25] Spirit Christ is the visible image of
[1:10:27] the invisible God the son okay now why
[1:10:30] don't since we have time I'm sure we
[1:10:32] have time tonight let's go to 1 Timothy
[1:10:34] 2 let's read that again so everybody can
[1:10:35] see this by the grace of the Lord 1
[1:10:37] Timothy
[1:10:39] 2 and let's read that about how Eve fell
[1:10:42] it was Eve was the one that knew what
[1:10:45] she was doing 1 Timothy
[1:10:48] 2 verse
[1:10:51] 11 1 Timothy 21 let the the woman learn
[1:10:54] in Silence with all
[1:10:56] subjection okay so all submission so see
[1:10:59] the woman's called to be all submissive
[1:11:01] and learn in silence okay now that don't
[1:11:04] mean she can't say Amen it just means
[1:11:06] she can't start teaching
[1:11:08] others right that that doesn't mean she
[1:11:10] can't prophecy prophesy because a woman
[1:11:12] can have all nine gifts of the Spirit if
[1:11:14] God gives one of them or all man or
[1:11:17] woman can have any of the nine gifts of
[1:11:18] the Spirit so this is in the aspect of
[1:11:20] teaching because look at verse 12 this
[1:11:22] is what it's talking about but I suffer
[1:11:24] not a woman to teach that's what they
[1:11:26] mean by silent a woman's supposed to
[1:11:28] learn not teach she's supposed to learn
[1:11:30] in silence uh nor to assert authority
[1:11:33] over the man but to be in silence so as
[1:11:37] far as leadership she's a silent she's a
[1:11:39] silent figure she's not the leader the
[1:11:41] man's the leader the man's The Voice the
[1:11:43] man is the one teaching and she is below
[1:11:46] now why is that Paul because verse 13
[1:11:48] for Adam was first formed then Eve so
[1:11:51] man was formed first that's God's plan
[1:11:54] and Adam was not deceived okay so Adam
[1:11:57] was not tricked by the serpent uh when
[1:11:59] it came down to handling the word of God
[1:12:01] Adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:12:03] being deceived was in the
[1:12:06] transgression not withstanding she
[1:12:07] should be saved in childbearing if they
[1:12:10] continue in faith and charity and
[1:12:11] Holiness and sobriety brother bam tried
[1:12:13] to clear this up and he said he said
[1:12:14] this doesn't mean a woman's got to have
[1:12:16] a baby to be saved he said that's not
[1:12:17] what it means it just means her role is
[1:12:20] to Bear children and so she's saved as
[1:12:22] long as she lived lives a Godly
[1:12:24] Christian Life which is to give uh
[1:12:26] children to her husband to have faith
[1:12:28] look at that it says faith charity
[1:12:30] what's charity Divine love right and
[1:12:33] Holiness with sobriety so living a sober
[1:12:35] life not living a a a foolish life or
[1:12:39] life of drunkenness or drugs or anything
[1:12:41] like that but a life of so sobriety and
[1:12:44] and
[1:12:46] sincerity okay all right now here's some
[1:12:49] quotes now here you got the quotes
[1:12:51] invisible Union brother R said notice
[1:12:52] that's committed To Her Sacred virtue
[1:12:55] sacred Womanhood and then sacred
[1:12:57] motherhood honor her husband she's got
[1:13:00] those three sacred commitments that a
[1:13:03] woman's supposed to do supposed to honor
[1:13:05] her
[1:13:06] husband okay now here's a quite here's a
[1:13:08] strong quote you probably heard it
[1:13:10] before is your life for the gospel well
[1:13:12] said I was preaching the other night
[1:13:14] somewhere about women to obey their
[1:13:15] husband obey yeah that went out of the
[1:13:18] marriage ritual a long time ago now he's
[1:13:20] being sarcastic but it's actually you
[1:13:22] know true in many Mar mares of course
[1:13:25] but they ain't going to do that no sir
[1:13:26] they live in America and they let you
[1:13:28] know so they're not going to obey so
[1:13:31] most American women aren't going to obey
[1:13:32] their husbands but the Christian Ones
[1:13:35] Will that's what Jesus said but as long
[1:13:38] as you don't do it look what brother
[1:13:39] said don't never try to call yourself a
[1:13:42] Christian because you're not now look at
[1:13:45] that brother said A woman can't even be
[1:13:46] a Christian if she don't obey her
[1:13:47] husband now it's got to work both ways
[1:13:50] so a man can't even be a Christian if he
[1:13:51] don't love his wife okay okay right
[1:13:55] because God's not a respector of persons
[1:13:58] so if she won't obey her husband she's
[1:13:59] probably not even a Christian if a man
[1:14:01] won't love his wife he's probably not a
[1:14:02] Christian yet it's got to work both
[1:14:06] ways but man said I don't care how much
[1:14:08] you dance and speak with tongues if you
[1:14:10] don't obey your husband you're out of
[1:14:12] the will of God because that's Ephesians
[1:14:15] chapter
[1:14:16] 5 right okay that's a pretty stinging
[1:14:20] one right there that's a stinger right
[1:14:21] there he said don't call call yourself a
[1:14:23] Christian if you don't obey your husband
[1:14:26] okay all right next one it is I be not
[1:14:30] afraid he's talking about how women
[1:14:32] should have a
[1:14:33] dainty Spirit an obedient
[1:14:37] Spirit he said now Sarah Sarah was a
[1:14:40] little different from some of our modern
[1:14:41] sisters today don't it make you kind of
[1:14:45] feel bad when you know Men start talking
[1:14:47] and women come out and butt right in and
[1:14:50] it's kind of
[1:14:51] rude look at that said a woman's
[1:14:54] supposed to be submissive a woman's
[1:14:56] supposed to wait a woman's supposed to
[1:14:57] let the man talk and brother BR even
[1:14:59] brings it down to conversation we're
[1:15:01] having conversation when a woman butts
[1:15:03] in and interrupts the man that's a rude
[1:15:05] thing to do that's not a submissive
[1:15:06] Spirit okay so sister that one can help
[1:15:09] us all out by God's grace but um that's
[1:15:13] what he
[1:15:13] said now he said don't it just seem rude
[1:15:17] but little Sarah was a little
[1:15:18] Pentecostal sister that stayed back to
[1:15:21] take care of her business okay so he's
[1:15:23] telling the story of Genesis 18 right
[1:15:26] where Abraham meets the three visitors I
[1:15:28] don't you remember that and Sarah stayed
[1:15:29] back in the tent and she was just fixing
[1:15:31] brother Bram said that's how submissive
[1:15:33] she was she didn't go there and try to
[1:15:35] interrupt the four men talking and try
[1:15:36] to boss them around or you know be rude
[1:15:39] she just let the brothers talk and she
[1:15:42] went and served them in behind the tent
[1:15:45] can everybody see that by God's grace
[1:15:47] and remember Sarah's the example Peter
[1:15:49] said Sarah is the mother of the daugh
[1:15:51] the Christian daughters
[1:15:53] sisters should try to look at their
[1:15:55] lives and uh model after Sarah so it's
[1:15:59] kind of rude for sisters to to interrupt
[1:16:02] and men and start talking and cut them
[1:16:04] off in the middle of the sentence and
[1:16:06] they should stay back and let the men
[1:16:09] lead right that's what they should do
[1:16:12] now here's the quote I told you this is
[1:16:14] a stinger for uh men that tell their
[1:16:17] wives to do things that are outside the
[1:16:18] work here's what they ask brother brand
[1:16:21] brother brandom the Bible tells us that
[1:16:22] a wife should obey her husband I'm a
[1:16:24] Christian and my husband is a sinner he
[1:16:27] persecutes me in every way that he can
[1:16:29] and for me not to go to church and read
[1:16:31] my Bible and denies the word what should
[1:16:34] I do remember the Bible said let them
[1:16:36] obey in everything right but you got to
[1:16:39] balance it out with the other scripture
[1:16:41] now look this look look what he says
[1:16:43] what should you do now listen you're
[1:16:45] supposed to obey your husband that's the
[1:16:47] word now if he tells you and refuses you
[1:16:49] to read the Bible or go to church or
[1:16:53] something like that you don't have to
[1:16:55] obey that
[1:16:58] amen because why brother Brandon he that
[1:17:01] won't forsake his father mother husband
[1:17:03] wife whatever it is follow me he's not
[1:17:05] worthy than me that's awesome Amen I
[1:17:09] love that that's what Jesus said if you
[1:17:11] can't forsake your father your mother
[1:17:13] your husband your wife your
[1:17:14] mother-in-law father-in-law for my sake
[1:17:16] he said you're not worthy of me so if a
[1:17:19] man or woman if a man says you can't
[1:17:21] read your Bible you can't go to Church
[1:17:23] the woman says honey I love you so much
[1:17:26] but that that's causing me to break the
[1:17:28] word I can't I can't break the
[1:17:30] word or if a woman says hubby you can't
[1:17:32] go to church and you can't read the
[1:17:34] Bible stop paying ties all these things
[1:17:36] you say darling I love you but you
[1:17:38] cannot uh tell me what to do and you
[1:17:41] can't you can't tell me to break the
[1:17:42] word of God right you got to forsake
[1:17:46] anything in order to obey God's word all
[1:17:50] right that's a stinger but that's that's
[1:17:52] true that's very
[1:17:56] true now here's a good one too now this
[1:17:59] is a a real challenge for Brothers now
[1:18:01] we got another challenge for the
[1:18:02] brothers
[1:18:04] okay now brother is talking about how
[1:18:06] Paul said this is a mystery how the
[1:18:09] women should be in respect to their
[1:18:11] husbands even the second place I believe
[1:18:12] in the entire Bible thinking man's
[1:18:14] filter I listened to that last week what
[1:18:16] a beautiful message that is if you
[1:18:17] haven't enjoyed that you'd really like
[1:18:19] it he said the woman seeing she
[1:18:21] reverence her husband reverence husband
[1:18:23] now look here's for the brothers then a
[1:18:26] husband ought to live such a life before
[1:18:28] his wife that his wife could reverence
[1:18:32] him as a Son of God I like that amen see
[1:18:36] a man supposed to get a man says you
[1:18:37] need to respect me you need to respect
[1:18:38] me you need to submit to me but in in
[1:18:41] all reality the man has to live a
[1:18:43] respectful life and then she can respect
[1:18:46] him right if he doesn't live a reverent
[1:18:49] life it's hard for her to have reverence
[1:18:51] for him if he don't live a reverent life
[1:18:53] because that's what brother R says next
[1:18:55] look what he says
[1:18:58] next and if he doesn't live that kind of
[1:19:01] life well then of course she wouldn't
[1:19:03] reverence him because she knows what
[1:19:06] he's made
[1:19:08] of wow but when it is a man that is a
[1:19:12] reverend man Reverend clean with his
[1:19:14] wife and before his family a real
[1:19:15] servant of God then the women children
[1:19:17] and all should respect that servant of
[1:19:19] God with reverence this is what he needs
[1:19:22] he needs respect and submission and
[1:19:24] admiration that's what a man needs first
[1:19:27] he's a woman that will submit but at the
[1:19:29] same time the man's got to love and a
[1:19:32] man has to be a real Godly example
[1:19:34] Church it don't mean he's perfect it
[1:19:36] just means he's Perfect by the blood
[1:19:39] okay he's perfect through repentance
[1:19:41] sisters he's not going to be perfect by
[1:19:43] his every action but he'll be perfect
[1:19:45] through repentance and the blood of
[1:19:47] Jesus Christ okay that's really
[1:19:49] important that we get to that quote that
[1:19:51] was real good quote I got God's
[1:19:54] grace so see a man a man can demand
[1:19:57] respect and well I I command you to
[1:19:59] respect me but if he lives a respectful
[1:20:02] life it's a lot easier for her to
[1:20:03] respect him if he lives the right kind
[1:20:05] of life okay now I want to say share
[1:20:07] this quote too I don't have it in front
[1:20:08] of me but I know it's in questions
[1:20:10] answers part four 1964 brother brandom
[1:20:13] said Remember When Rebecca was getting a
[1:20:14] little worldly right there before she
[1:20:15] met George okay brother brandom had to
[1:20:18] sit down and say ma he said I know I
[1:20:21] become common to you but you got to
[1:20:23] trust me I've got the word of the lord
[1:20:25] we got to treat her like a friend and a
[1:20:27] buddy remember that quote okay so I want
[1:20:30] I just want you just to listen to that
[1:20:32] sisters that and brothers there's going
[1:20:34] to be a time when no matter how Godly
[1:20:36] you live you're going to become common
[1:20:38] to each other because that's what
[1:20:39] happened to brother Brandon I honestly
[1:20:41] don't know a man that was more holy in
[1:20:43] the Holy Spirit by Holy Spirit habits
[1:20:45] than brother Brandon just by his life
[1:20:46] and by his testimony I don't know a man
[1:20:49] that in this world you know these days
[1:20:51] that live such a Godly holy life okay
[1:20:55] but even he lived such a life to God but
[1:20:58] even he became common to his
[1:21:00] wife so that's what I'm saying here you
[1:21:02] got to take this quote you know and got
[1:21:04] to balance it out got to understand it
[1:21:06] as well that even no matter how Godly
[1:21:08] you live there's going to be times where
[1:21:09] you get common to each other you got to
[1:21:11] say Lord help me to have that reverence
[1:21:13] back for my wife and H or husband okay
[1:21:16] we gotta pray for that and usually that
[1:21:18] happens a few years after you get
[1:21:20] married you know they lose the the the
[1:21:21] sincerity lose the uh the love they lose
[1:21:25] the submission maybe a little bit and
[1:21:27] they need God to restore it so let's
[1:21:29] keep that in mind let's pray God help us
[1:21:32] not to become common one to another help
[1:21:34] me not to become common to my
[1:21:36] spouse okay now look what brother says
[1:21:38] next I read like this you must be born
[1:21:40] again then we'll move on to the next
[1:21:43] need and you woman that take another man
[1:21:46] in your arm I talk about you know
[1:21:47] adultery you're marred you marred that
[1:21:49] mold that you were taken from remember
[1:21:51] that women when you act like a man
[1:21:54] you're out of your place so see that's
[1:21:56] why we said we can't have sisters
[1:21:57] interruped men and trying to rule the
[1:21:58] conversation they need to submit and
[1:22:01] just be
[1:22:03] humble okay when you act like a man
[1:22:06] you're out of your place and when a man
[1:22:08] here when a man gets to be a too
[1:22:10] and he's a baby and this and that the
[1:22:12] other he's out of his place so when a
[1:22:14] man's too babyish and too whiy and
[1:22:16] things like that he's not a man
[1:22:18] anymore so see sisters got to be
[1:22:21] submissive and then men got to be more
[1:22:23] manly so women got to act like a women
[1:22:26] and men got to act like a
[1:22:28] man see he's boss you gotta let a man be
[1:22:31] the boss he's the ruler so Brothers you
[1:22:33] got to be the ruler you gotta learn to
[1:22:35] make decisions right gotta learn to Le
[1:22:36] pray first and then make decisions ask
[1:22:39] your wife what she feels then pray about
[1:22:41] what she said and then ask see what God
[1:22:43] says see what God puts on your heart
[1:22:46] that's the way to do it now I don't mean
[1:22:48] a floor mat okay sisters are not floor
[1:22:51] mats not at all in the kingdom of God I
[1:22:54] just said a ruler a helpmate not to kick
[1:22:56] women around no the Bible said God said
[1:22:58] in creation you should rule over you not
[1:23:00] to be a big boss but to be a helpmate
[1:23:03] part of you she's sweet and kind and
[1:23:06] tender you should lead her around what
[1:23:08] word is that church sweetly a man should
[1:23:12] lead a rifle around
[1:23:15] sweetly yet he's the boss yet he's the
[1:23:17] ruler she's not a doormat she's a she's
[1:23:20] a jewel she's a M and you should treat
[1:23:23] her sweetly that's what the Bible says
[1:23:26] too and kind and tender see Brothers got
[1:23:30] to be tender to their wives what brother
[1:23:32] R said you should lead her around
[1:23:34] sweetly because she's part of you you go
[1:23:36] to mistreating her then you're
[1:23:37] mistreating yourself because she's a
[1:23:40] part of
[1:23:41] you and a man mentally right won't do
[1:23:44] that so if a man does that won't repent
[1:23:46] he's not mentally right got a wrong
[1:23:48] Spirit on it can everybody say Amen to
[1:23:50] that amen all right all right here's
[1:23:52] need number two this is a really short
[1:23:53] one but let's read it out of the
[1:23:55] scripture okay so Malachi Malachi get um
[1:23:58] Genesis 268 okay some of you maybe never
[1:24:01] seen these before now what does
[1:24:03] recreational companionship means it just
[1:24:05] means a man needs a companion when he
[1:24:08] wants to kind of relax or do something
[1:24:10] uh maybe that's just uh for for
[1:24:12] relaxation purposes he needs his wife to
[1:24:14] be with him he needs his wife to be able
[1:24:17] to enjoy what he enjoys even if she
[1:24:20] doesn't he needs like her as a buddy to
[1:24:22] come along and do things together with
[1:24:24] that he likes to do okay the example
[1:24:26] brother brand gave was hunting he took
[1:24:28] his wife hunting okay at least well not
[1:24:31] outside the Wilderness but at least into
[1:24:33] a cabin okay so I'm going to show that
[1:24:35] example okay so here's the scripture
[1:24:38] now we already read these these two
[1:24:40] scriptures Ephesians 5:22 and 24 explain
[1:24:44] that she should submit in everything so
[1:24:46] if a man as his wife to be a part of his
[1:24:48] hobby or some Recreation let's go
[1:24:50] camping or or uh uh let's go shoot some
[1:24:53] bow and arrow or let's go do something
[1:24:56] let's go do this or that let's go for a
[1:24:57] walk the woman should respect that and
[1:25:00] should be his best best friend be His
[1:25:02] companion be his buddy a man needs that
[1:25:05] okay now I'm going to read this one and
[1:25:07] then Malachai go and read this one
[1:25:09] because I don't know if you ever seen
[1:25:10] this one before Genesis
[1:25:12] 268 and it came to pass when he had been
[1:25:15] there a long time that ABC King of the
[1:25:18] Philistines looked out at a window and
[1:25:20] saw behold Isaac was
[1:25:24] okay now didn't know the story there
[1:25:27] Isaac did the same thing Abraham did
[1:25:28] they both lied and they said oh my wife
[1:25:31] isn't my wife she's my
[1:25:33] sister but after Isaac lied the King was
[1:25:36] looking out and watching you know Isaac
[1:25:38] and Rebecca interact and what the Bible
[1:25:40] say they were sporting if you look it up
[1:25:42] it just means being playful being
[1:25:44] joking okay so Isaac is just treating
[1:25:47] his wife you know playfully i' imagine
[1:25:49] maybe he's hugging her maybe I don't
[1:25:51] know tickling her I don't you know I
[1:25:53] don't know what kind of you know I'm not
[1:25:54] sure what to say but they're being
[1:25:55] they're sporting maybe he was kind of
[1:25:57] kissing her hugging her from behind or
[1:25:59] I'm not sure what you know I'm not sure
[1:26:01] exactly what was going on but they were
[1:26:02] sporting and he could tell oh they're
[1:26:04] not brother and sister they're lovers
[1:26:07] because they're spending time together
[1:26:08] doing fun things together doing
[1:26:10] pleasurable things together so that's a
[1:26:12] scripture for this a man needs that a
[1:26:14] man needs a buddy so his wife needs to
[1:26:17] learn to joke around and do things with
[1:26:19] him okay even hobby type of playful
[1:26:22] recreational things okay that's what a
[1:26:26] woman needs to do now it can't be sinful
[1:26:28] for example uh you know for the young
[1:26:30] people I would say this uh well I used
[1:26:32] to have a bad habit of playing video
[1:26:34] games well that would be sin to do that
[1:26:37] that'd be sin to ask my wife to play
[1:26:39] these these bad video games right now I
[1:26:41] don't play them anymore I haven't since
[1:26:42] a long time ago since even before I uh
[1:26:45] got the Holy Ghost I haven't played him
[1:26:46] for a long long time okay so this is not
[1:26:50] saying you know a woman needs to sin
[1:26:52] with her husband we already went through
[1:26:54] that if a husband asks a wife to sin she
[1:26:56] can say no that doesn't lead me to be
[1:26:58] like
[1:26:59] Christ I'm gonna pray for you okay but
[1:27:03] notice Isaac was sporting Isaac was
[1:27:05] being playful Isaac needed a companion
[1:27:08] he was just being lovey dovey whatever
[1:27:09] you want to say he just needed a buddy
[1:27:11] and so ack says oh they're not brother
[1:27:14] sister they're married okay and then
[1:27:16] Isaac you know confesses and the same
[1:27:18] thing kind of happen that did with
[1:27:19] Abraham okay now let's go to song I'll
[1:27:22] read this one
[1:27:24] here this is a nice one here uh chapter
[1:27:28] 711 711 song of Solon
[1:27:40] 711 now in this case uh Solomon and the
[1:27:43] shulamite that was his wife in this in
[1:27:45] this
[1:27:47] book uh he asked her to go on a walk and
[1:27:50] go down to the gardens
[1:27:52] now I think we can all see that can we
[1:27:55] that would be something recreational
[1:27:57] right oh let's go for a walk at the
[1:27:58] gardens my wife and I one time went a
[1:28:00] couple times with the Stan hu you ever a
[1:28:02] Stan hu those beautiful garden that was
[1:28:04] just something recreational that she
[1:28:05] wanted to do and I wanted to do it oh
[1:28:07] boy the smells they are so great you
[1:28:09] know this time of year when the
[1:28:10] weather's nice it could be a
[1:28:12] recreational thing now my recreational
[1:28:13] thing I like to go to Parks when I can
[1:28:15] with my wife or take her out just to a
[1:28:17] restaurant nice quiet atmosphere just
[1:28:19] kind of do that together um we don't
[1:28:22] much time to do walking anymore like we
[1:28:23] used to but we used to like to go to
[1:28:24] parks and it was just so wonderful
[1:28:26] perhaps as L gets older and can babysit
[1:28:28] you know we can go do some more walking
[1:28:29] in the park my wife and I I just like
[1:28:32] being in nature you know so that's my
[1:28:34] that's my Recreation I just like to go
[1:28:35] out of nature you know and do that now
[1:28:38] let's read the scripture here's what so
[1:28:39] what Solomon does with his wife okay
[1:28:43] 711 come my beloved let us go forth into
[1:28:46] the field let us Lodge in The Villages
[1:28:49] now remember Solomon's the king so he
[1:28:51] says let's just go get away let's do
[1:28:53] some Recreation let's get out of the
[1:28:54] regular Palace life and let's go out to
[1:28:56] the Villages let's go out to the fields
[1:28:59] okay verse 12 let us get up early to The
[1:29:02] Vineyards let us see if the vine
[1:29:03] flourish whether the tender grape appear
[1:29:05] in the pomegranate Bud forth there will
[1:29:07] I give thee my loves okay so it's kind
[1:29:10] of like that romance kind of thing oh
[1:29:12] let's get out of our regular routine
[1:29:14] we're always in the palace Ro doing
[1:29:16] everything in the P let's get out there
[1:29:18] let's go on a little vacation let's go

[1:29:23] Vineyards are doing let's see how the

[1:29:27] we'll kiss and we'll have romance and
[1:29:29] things like that there I'll give you my
[1:29:32] loves okay there's nothing wrong with
[1:29:35] that that's the Bible said the marriage
[1:29:37] bed is undefiled and those kind of
[1:29:39] things they the couple should always be
[1:29:41] in love the Bible says that they should
[1:29:42] always be ravished with with each
[1:29:44] other's love husband's to love and the
[1:29:47] wife is to
[1:29:48] submit okay so can everybody see that
[1:29:50] that a man needs that a man needs a wife
[1:29:52] that will join him in what he likes to
[1:29:54] do if he likes to go Sport and you know
[1:29:56] play around or whatever more or if he
[1:29:58] likes to just you know go for walks or
[1:30:00] whatever he likes to do he needs his
[1:30:02] wife to go along now here's a quote
[1:30:04] where brother Bram took his wife on
[1:30:06] their honeymoon he said he didn't have
[1:30:08] enough money to take a honeymoon and a
[1:30:10] hunting trip so he combined them and he
[1:30:12] kind of makes a joke about
[1:30:14] it because I you know most sisters
[1:30:16] wouldn't want to go hunting for the
[1:30:18] honeymoon right so brother man makes a
[1:30:19] joke he couldn't do both so he just
[1:30:21] comine
[1:30:22] them sometime ago I kind of took
[1:30:24] advantage of a little trip I just got
[1:30:26] married I see my wife sitting there
[1:30:28] looking at me and we just got married
[1:30:29] and I was going to take her on a little
[1:30:30] honeymoon we saved up a few nickels and
[1:30:32] was going to go to Niagara Falls and I
[1:30:35] thought while I was that close to the
[1:30:37] ader onac I might as well get a little
[1:30:39] hunting in so I took her with me
[1:30:41] hunting okay now most you know the story
[1:30:44] brother brand got lost remember and it
[1:30:46] started snowing he thought he was going
[1:30:47] to die and so he was looking up he said
[1:30:50] Lord you know let me touch that that
[1:30:52] electric pole he used to he used to
[1:30:53] check the wires on his job and he
[1:30:56] finally caught it and that wire guided
[1:30:58] him all the way back down the mountain
[1:31:00] and took him down to his wife and uh
[1:31:02] where they were waiting there okay so
[1:31:06] here's an example where the wife says
[1:31:08] okay I'll go hunting with you hubby I'm
[1:31:09] not interested in hunting but I'll do it
[1:31:12] with you because I love you okay a man
[1:31:14] needs that okay sister so if your
[1:31:17] husband needs to let off the pressure
[1:31:19] and go for a drive or he likes to go
[1:31:21] drive or he likes to you know work on uh
[1:31:24] you know refinishing desks or you know
[1:31:26] woodwork or something you should support
[1:31:28] him in his hobby okay as long as it's a
[1:31:31] Godly thing to
[1:31:32] do all right so there's the second need
[1:31:35] so submission and then he needs a
[1:31:37] companion he needs a companion that will
[1:31:39] be with him wherever he goes and
[1:31:41] whatever he wants to
[1:31:42] do okay the third thing he needs is
[1:31:44] domestic support and so let's read this
[1:31:47] let's read Titus 2 so Malachi Titus 2 or
[1:31:50] Lydia Titus 2 4-6 and I'll read psalms
[1:31:55] 1139 a man needs uh support in the home
[1:32:00] because he's normally got to be the
[1:32:01] bread winner normally like if he's sick
[1:32:03] then of course brother said the wife can
[1:32:05] go out and get a job if he's sick and
[1:32:06] can't work and that'd be really
[1:32:08] unfortunate but sometimes God allows
[1:32:10] that okay so Malachi Titus 24 to6
[1:32:15] whenever you're
[1:32:20] ready
[1:32:29] May teach the young women to be sober to
[1:32:32] love their husbands to love their
[1:32:34] children to be disree chased keepers at
[1:32:38] home good obedient to their own husbands
[1:32:41] that the word of God be not Blas thank
[1:32:43] you now look that's serious the Bible
[1:32:45] said the word is blasphemed if a woman
[1:32:48] doesn't love her children love her
[1:32:49] husband and then keep the home
[1:32:52] a woman is called to be The Keeper of
[1:32:54] the home according to the Holy Scripture
[1:32:57] okay here's another one let's go to
[1:32:58] Psalms 1139 this a good scripture
[1:33:04] here Psalms
[1:33:07] 1139 he maketh the baren woman to keep
[1:33:10] house is that nice and to be a joyful
[1:33:13] mother of
[1:33:15] children praise ye the Lord look at that
[1:33:18] holy spirit says praise the Lord the
[1:33:20] woman that once couldn't have children
[1:33:22] now she's a joyful mom and now she loves
[1:33:24] be keeping the home is that is that
[1:33:27] sweet I love that Hallelujah same thing
[1:33:31] Titus said right or Paul said to Titus
[1:33:33] keep the home teach the children love
[1:33:36] the husband same thing this is what a
[1:33:39] man needs a man needs a woman that will
[1:33:40] keep the home train the children and
[1:33:43] love her husband here's where brother ad
[1:33:45] says
[1:33:47] it talks about how women should not be
[1:33:49] in politics and guess you know it's too
[1:33:51] late you know we got you know most women
[1:33:52] W won't repent of that but the real ones
[1:33:54] will uh she ain't got no business over
[1:33:57] any Authority in the church either but
[1:33:58] the M said her place is a man's Queen at
[1:34:01] home that's her place outside of that
[1:34:04] she has nothing and we know that to be
[1:34:06] the truth I know that sounds
[1:34:07] oldfashioned but I'm responsible I know
[1:34:10] that after my going away from this Earth
[1:34:12] them tapes and them books will be living
[1:34:13] on and many of you young children will
[1:34:16] find the days to come that this is
[1:34:17] exactly the truth because I speak it in
[1:34:19] the name of the Lord now I just showed
[1:34:21] you two scriptures right it just showed
[1:34:23] you two scriptures where the Bible said
[1:34:24] she's keeper the home she should be
[1:34:27] happy and joyful in the home because
[1:34:29] that's her
[1:34:30] place all right now look brother Ram's
[1:34:32] gone and what did he speak in the name
[1:34:34] of the Lord yes did he tell us the Bible
[1:34:35] truth yes he did but most churches say
[1:34:37] oh women just have children send them
[1:34:39] off to the daycare and you go work and
[1:34:41] make money that's wrong that's wrong the
[1:34:45] woman needs a stay at home take care of
[1:34:47] those children now like I said there are
[1:34:49] situations even brother Bram saw where a
[1:34:51] man sick and a woman's got to go eat I'm
[1:34:53] sorry got to go work so they can eat
[1:34:55] right and make the money but in most
[1:34:57] cases the man needs to work woman needs
[1:34:59] to stay at home and guide the children
[1:35:01] and guide the
[1:35:02] home okay here's another quote he was
[1:35:05] the pass this
[1:35:08] way Womanhood is broke the backbone of
[1:35:10] the nation is broke when women get to a
[1:35:13] place that our American women are today
[1:35:14] it's a disgrace the way our American
[1:35:16] women act I got a clipping out of the
[1:35:18] paper I believe it was about 60% of the
[1:35:20] boys that went over seon the last war
[1:35:22] was divorced from the wives before they
[1:35:24] came back their wives running off with
[1:35:26] somebody else and the defense plants
[1:35:28] working okay so that was in World War II
[1:35:31] now that's a lot of that is historically
[1:35:34] accurate I have I have books that say a
[1:35:38] lot of the women went to work in the uh
[1:35:40] factories when the men went to World War
[1:35:42] II which is fact that's factual I don't
[1:35:44] know about the divorce rate I don't know
[1:35:46] if that's factual but that's when the
[1:35:48] first time women started wearing pants
[1:35:49] and it was okay you know for them of
[1:35:53] course it wasn't okay for God so brother
[1:35:55] Bram said notice after they started
[1:35:57] working they started leaving their
[1:35:58] husbands why because they had money they
[1:36:00] could do whatever they want they were
[1:36:01] being they were becoming like a man and
[1:36:03] they were having the spirit of a man
[1:36:05] they took the dominating female Spirit
[1:36:08] But A Woman's Place is at home with her
[1:36:10] children now if the husband's sick and
[1:36:11] she has to work that's different but a
[1:36:13] man's I'm sorry but a woman's place is
[1:36:15] at home in the kitchen and when she
[1:36:17] leaves that she's out of her place amen
[1:36:20] that's the word of God on of two place
[1:36:22] in the
[1:36:24] scripture all right this quote I read on
[1:36:26] Sunday there's no one that can console
[1:36:29] or Comfort a person when they're tired
[1:36:30] like the wife and a man shouldn't
[1:36:32] confide in anyone like they do their
[1:36:34] wife now remember confide means to tell
[1:36:36] the secrets so a man needs to tell his
[1:36:38] wife his secrets about his plans right
[1:36:41] like we said that's openness and honesty
[1:36:43] brother Bram said that brother Braham
[1:36:45] said a husband needs to confide in his
[1:36:47] wife he said a man needs a woman that
[1:36:50] when he come home and he's tired and
[1:36:51] weary can sit down and she can talk to
[1:36:53] you and she can do more with you than
[1:36:55] anybody else see he needs a woman that
[1:36:57] can create a nice atmosphere in the home
[1:36:59] so when he comes home he's out at Leo to
[1:37:01] Sea and all those battles and everything
[1:37:02] and he can come home to a holy
[1:37:04] atmosphere yes
[1:37:07] amen all right here's the last one for
[1:37:09] this one thirsting for Life greatest
[1:37:11] thing God gave a man outside of
[1:37:12] Salvation was a wife she was to comfort
[1:37:15] him to help him to bless him to console
[1:37:17] him and to be a real companion to him
[1:37:19] today they degrad it moralized I'm going
[1:37:22] to skip right
[1:37:23] there okay now number four and five Le
[1:37:27] is four and
[1:37:29] five okay
[1:37:32] um all right I think I'll read both of
[1:37:34] these here now he needs a physical
[1:37:37] intimacy now most of the adults know
[1:37:39] what we're talking about most of the
[1:37:40] children don't but um I'm I'm going to
[1:37:42] just call it that I'm just going to call
[1:37:44] it physical intimacy okay or brother bam
[1:37:46] calls it passions or he calls it family
[1:37:48] relations that's what brother Bram calls
[1:37:50] it so
[1:37:51] uh that's important now let's go to 1
[1:37:53] Corinthians 7 I'm going to read this for
[1:37:54] us by God's
[1:38:00] grace this is what uh man needs okay
[1:38:05] verse 1-9 now concerning the things
[1:38:07] whereof you wrote unto me it is good for
[1:38:09] a man not to touch a woman nevertheless
[1:38:13] to avoid fornication every man have his
[1:38:14] own wife and let every woman have her
[1:38:16] own husband this is the way to avoid
[1:38:18] fornicating is to get married according
[1:38:21] to Paul but the husband Render unto the
[1:38:23] wife du benevolence that means kindness
[1:38:25] and love and likewise also the wife un
[1:38:28] the husband the wife hath not power of
[1:38:31] her own body but the
[1:38:33] husband and likewise also the husband
[1:38:35] hath not power of his own body but the
[1:38:38] wife so when the woman wants to have
[1:38:41] family relations the man should say yes
[1:38:43] when the man wants to have family
[1:38:44] relations the woman should say yes verse
[1:38:47] five defraud now that means Rob def
[1:38:51] fraud ye not don't Rob one the other
[1:38:54] except it be with consent for a time
[1:38:57] that you may give yourselves a fasting
[1:38:59] in prayer and come together again that
[1:39:01] Satan tempt you not for your
[1:39:03] incontinency okay so Paul tells these
[1:39:07] Christians uh don't Rob each other of
[1:39:10] that physical relationship okay the only
[1:39:12] reason you should do it or not the only
[1:39:15] reason you should not or tell each other
[1:39:16] not to come together is because of
[1:39:18] prayer and fasting of course you know
[1:39:20] woman hurts cycle of life that the time
[1:39:22] where she's uh having that she's unclean
[1:39:25] of course like the Bible said so they
[1:39:27] wouldn't come together during that time
[1:39:29] but see the Bible says a they're tempted
[1:39:32] when they don't come together so they've
[1:39:33] really got to make sure they have family
[1:39:35] relations and have the physical intimacy
[1:39:37] so they don't get tempted because they
[1:39:40] have these
[1:39:41] desires verse six but I speak this by
[1:39:44] permission and not of commandment for I
[1:39:47] would that all men were even as myself
[1:39:50] but every man hath his proper gift of
[1:39:52] God one after this manner another after
[1:39:54] that I say therefore to the unmarried
[1:39:56] and widows it is good for them if they
[1:39:58] abide even as I so Paul says you should
[1:40:00] try to live single if you can but like
[1:40:02] we said on Sunday what would happened if
[1:40:04] everybody would obeyed that we would
[1:40:05] have had no Offspring okay had no
[1:40:07] children to raise now verse nine but if
[1:40:11] they cannot contain let them marry for
[1:40:13] it's better to marry than to
[1:40:15] burn okay it's better to marry than to
[1:40:17] burn like he said in verse two to avoid
[1:40:20] fornication get
[1:40:23] married now verse uh okay now
[1:40:26] that's okay that's something else okay
[1:40:29] now in verse 10 and on it gets on the
[1:40:30] reasons why they can separate remember
[1:40:33] couples can separate for any reason but
[1:40:35] they cannot remarry for any reason it
[1:40:38] can only remarry if a spouse dies or if
[1:40:41] uh the wife didn't confess fornication
[1:40:43] beforehand okay those the only reasons
[1:40:46] they can marry and have a living spouse
[1:40:49] okay but of course if the spouse died
[1:40:50] and their with widow or widower yeah
[1:40:52] then then they're free from the law of
[1:40:53] that marriage
[1:40:55] partner okay now here's a quote let's go
[1:40:57] through a few quotes here they ask
[1:40:59] brother brandom should a saved wife
[1:41:01] refuse herself to her husband if he's a
[1:41:04] sinner in other words should um should a
[1:41:08] Christian woman not give her body to her
[1:41:10] own husband even if he's if he's a
[1:41:11] sinner said no sir no sir that's your
[1:41:14] husband you'll drive him farther away
[1:41:16] from God than ever by doing
[1:41:19] that see that's right brother or that's
[1:41:22] right brother sister you married him
[1:41:24] he's yours and you're his okay so a
[1:41:27] woman really don't have she don't have
[1:41:28] any right to deny her husband of those
[1:41:30] physical intimacy and the same thing for
[1:41:33] the husband he can't deny his wife the
[1:41:35] physical
[1:41:36] intimacy that drives them away from God
[1:41:40] why because God put those desires inside
[1:41:43] of them to have those kind of
[1:41:45] relationships right the physical
[1:41:46] relationship God plants that desire a
[1:41:48] man or woman so they're supposed to meet
[1:41:50] meet their needs right that's what
[1:41:52] that's what the Bible says so they don't
[1:41:54] commit
[1:41:56] fornication okay next one said respect
[1:41:59] her like you always respect her don't
[1:42:00] pay any attention to these some of these
[1:42:02] sexy books now what are we talking about
[1:42:04] we're talking about pornography
[1:42:05] magazines brother BR tells them don't
[1:42:07] pay attention to pornography magazines
[1:42:09] don't look at that stuff don't look at
[1:42:10] it on your phone don't look at it at all
[1:42:13] and things that you read about and all
[1:42:14] this stuff and everything like that get
[1:42:16] that filthy stuff out of your mind he
[1:42:18] says so a Christian doesn't learn about
[1:42:20] you know uh physical intimacy by reading
[1:42:23] dirty things what they should do is read
[1:42:25] the book of Song of Solomon that's what
[1:42:27] they should do uh to learn about uh you
[1:42:31] know uh having better family relations
[1:42:33] or something like that the Bible said
[1:42:36] not let one dirty conversation come
[1:42:37] among you when you profess
[1:42:40] Holiness treat that little lady like
[1:42:42] she's your little sweetheart if she's 60
[1:42:44] years old you just be the same you be
[1:42:45] the Gallant boyfriend remember you are
[1:42:48] don't try try none of these new things I
[1:42:51] know that as a you just be a husband a
[1:42:53] genuine brother a genuine Christian he's
[1:42:56] talking about don't try none of these
[1:42:57] sexual magazines don't look at those
[1:42:59] sexual magazines they can't teach you
[1:43:01] nothing
[1:43:02] really many of them pervert most of them
[1:43:04] all of them pervert your mind so we're
[1:43:06] have to look at them now he's still
[1:43:08] talking on this in the same quote and
[1:43:10] you women live the right way to your
[1:43:12] husband and you husbands live the right
[1:43:13] way to your wives be real real nice and
[1:43:15] respect one another and your family
[1:43:18] relations so that's your physical
[1:43:20] intimacy and so forth like that let it
[1:43:22] just be as reverently and godly and
[1:43:25] agreed with you among everything as it
[1:43:27] should be don't never push and shove and
[1:43:31] be dirty and vulgar okay now what was
[1:43:34] that movie that came out uh 50 Shades of
[1:43:37] Gray that thing was so popular but that
[1:43:40] was all evil what was that movie about
[1:43:43] from what I've read now of course I
[1:43:44] would never read that book I'd never see
[1:43:46] it but I would read Internet articles it
[1:43:47] was like a big huge thing uh you know
[1:43:50] the top top box office thing and so when
[1:43:52] I read about it it was that as a man
[1:43:54] that liked to uh hurt hurt hurt his
[1:43:56] lovers or something like that physically
[1:43:58] hurt them and all kinds of things like
[1:44:00] that it was awful it's evil okay and uh
[1:44:04] and Christians were saying oh it's a
[1:44:06] good story because he starts out you
[1:44:07] know pushing and shoving and doing evil
[1:44:09] stuff and then he's changed because of
[1:44:12] her and I thought that's that's
[1:44:13] wickedness the Bible says put no evil
[1:44:15] thing before your eyes nothing praise
[1:44:18] the Lord I'll set no wickedness before
[1:44:20] my eyes that's what David said okay so
[1:44:23] what does brother Braham say you have to
[1:44:25] agree how you do family
[1:44:27] relations so as a husband and wife you
[1:44:29] got to talk about that you enjoy our
[1:44:30] family relations if not how can we make
[1:44:32] it better uh whatever more but don't
[1:44:35] push and shove and be vulgar and dirty
[1:44:37] and evil like that be reverent when
[1:44:40] those things happen be
[1:44:42] reverent
[1:44:43] okay that's what brother Ram said right
[1:44:47] that's what the prophet said I'm just
[1:44:49] saying what he said all right now look
[1:44:51] what he says he this the same quote he
[1:44:54] said understand and talk to your wife if
[1:44:56] one nature is to you another nature talk
[1:44:58] to her about so if a man's really high
[1:45:00] passion nature with family relations he
[1:45:02] should talk to his wife about that they
[1:45:03] should try to understand well how can we
[1:45:05] do this in a Godly manner how can we do
[1:45:07] this where everybody's respected
[1:45:08] everybody's reverenced how can we do
[1:45:10] this in a Godly way they should talk
[1:45:12] about
[1:45:14] it and he said always remember you're of
[1:45:17] a royal
[1:45:18] family he said I'm a son of a king I'm
[1:45:21] the son of the king my wife's a daughter
[1:45:23] of of a king how would I treat that
[1:45:25] King's Daughter praise God that's what
[1:45:28] men and women need to remember in their
[1:45:30] family relations in their homes they
[1:45:32] can't just treat their husband wife any
[1:45:33] way they want they got to remember this
[1:45:35] is God's daughter this is God's son I
[1:45:38] need treat them with Godly respect and
[1:45:40] reverence
[1:45:42] amen okay last one here then we'll we'll
[1:45:44] try to close by God's
[1:45:48] grace physical attractiveness now
[1:45:51] uh like I said this might be uh higher
[1:45:53] on some men's list than other ones but I
[1:45:55] think it is in the scripture because the
[1:45:57] Bible talk about the beauty of wives and
[1:45:59] so forth so let's look at this a man
[1:46:01] needs a woman that he's attracted to
[1:46:04] okay now let me say this some women
[1:46:06] can't help it like if they get hormone
[1:46:08] trouble or uh other troubles sometimes
[1:46:11] they can't control their physical
[1:46:12] appearance because they get problems
[1:46:14] like that well that's not what we're
[1:46:16] talking about we're talking about women
[1:46:18] that can help their image or they can't
[1:46:20] help their body and they can eat healthy
[1:46:23] you know find a way to exercise and find
[1:46:25] a way to stay attractive because a man
[1:46:28] likes uh an
[1:46:29] attractive uh spouse right now the same
[1:46:32] should work for the the man right if the
[1:46:34] woman needs an attractive spouse he
[1:46:36] should take care of himself he shouldn't
[1:46:38] let himself go and you know and not care
[1:46:40] about how he looks and they need to they
[1:46:42] need to meet the needs of the other one
[1:46:45] okay now remember there is a little
[1:46:47] profit to those kind of things remember
[1:46:49] there's a little profit to exercise Paul
[1:46:51] said so it's okay to exercise a little
[1:46:54] but it shouldn't be above spiritual
[1:46:56] exercise which is godliness and Holiness
[1:46:59] okay but there is a little bit of um
[1:47:02] benefit to that remember brother Bram
[1:47:04] got a lot of exercise church because he
[1:47:05] used to walk a lot right hunting and
[1:47:08] walking all the brothers that hunted
[1:47:09] with him they all say he walked more
[1:47:11] than they did because of his feet you
[1:47:12] know the way you know he had to he got
[1:47:15] shot when he was younger and things like
[1:47:16] that had trouble with his muscles but
[1:47:18] his feet were formed in such a way where
[1:47:19] he could walk more than the other
[1:47:21] brothers so he's a very uh fit man for
[1:47:24] his age because he' walk a lot okay so
[1:47:26] he F he found a way to
[1:47:28] exercise and he probably wasn't
[1:47:31] purposely doing it you know like we
[1:47:32] might but most of us aren't prophets and
[1:47:34] most of us don't go hunting for weeks on
[1:47:35] on end right okay so let's read some of
[1:47:39] the scriptures in here Malachi can you
[1:47:41] get song of
[1:47:42] Solomons uh 47 and I'll get Genesis
[1:47:49] 2:22 okay so Malachi can you read that
[1:47:51] when you're ready song Salomon 4:7 I at
[1:47:54] Genesis
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:47:56] 2:22 whatever you're
[1:47:58] ready th Fair my love there's no spot in
[1:48:03] okay yeah so Solomon looks at his wife
[1:48:05] and says you're Fair there's no spot in
[1:48:07] you okay so a man needs to look at his
[1:48:11] wife and say you're beautiful I think
[1:48:13] you're beautiful and she needs to do her
[1:48:14] best to stay as beautiful as she can for
[1:48:17] his sake because he needs that needs a
[1:48:19] beautiful attractive spous
[1:48:22] okay now also in the song of Salon
[1:48:24] remember there's a part where she goes
[1:48:25] through and she describes the husband
[1:48:28] salon and she describes how he's
[1:48:29] beautiful in every way too that's a type
[1:48:32] of Christ right we tell Christ he's
[1:48:34] beautiful and everything like that but
[1:48:35] also you know that's why we said a woman
[1:48:37] might need an attractive spouse as well
[1:48:39] she might want him just to take care of
[1:48:40] himself and treat himself uh well by
[1:48:43] God's grace okay now Genesis 2:22 this
[1:48:46] is a more uh kind of between the line
[1:48:49] scripture
[1:48:51] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:48:53] from man made he woman and brought her
[1:48:55] unto the
[1:48:56] man okay
[1:48:58] so I read this because uh God brought
[1:49:02] woman out of man and then brought the
[1:49:03] woman right to the man and I imagine
[1:49:05] Adam looked at her brother said he
[1:49:06] looked at her and she was the most
[1:49:07] beautiful thing on the earth that's what
[1:49:09] brother Bram said so God gave the first
[1:49:11] man a beautiful wife and so every man
[1:49:14] wants his wife to be beautiful and every
[1:49:16] wife is beautiful uh in the eyes of
[1:49:18] their husband if he's a Christian man
[1:49:20] yes okay now Genesis 12:11 I just want
[1:49:23] to read this here this is about or Sarah
[1:49:25] and
[1:49:26] Abraham Genesis
[1:49:29] 121 and it came to pass when he was come
[1:49:32] near to enter into Egypt that he said
[1:49:34] unto Sarah his wife behold I I know that
[1:49:36] thou a fair woman to look upon we'll
[1:49:38] just stop right there okay so see
[1:49:41] Abraham chose a beautiful wife okay men
[1:49:44] like Beauty right they want to be
[1:49:46] attracted to the woman that they marry
[1:49:48] so she needs to remain beautiful right
[1:49:51] as best as she can just like a man might
[1:49:53] want to if his wife wants remain strong
[1:49:56] remain uh take care of himself don't
[1:49:57] mistreat his
[1:49:59] body okay Proverbs 11:22 I'll get that
[1:50:02] one and and Lydia get Proverbs 6:25 okay
[1:50:05] you do the last one Lydia I'll do
[1:50:06] Proverbs
[1:50:12] 11:22 hope you're enjoying this by God's
[1:50:14] grace I really enjoy this tonight it's a
[1:50:16] real good topic to just kind of teach
[1:50:17] the scriptures on and show what brother
[1:50:19] Ram said
[1:50:22] now this scripture just shows the
[1:50:24] balance how you can a woman can be
[1:50:26] attractive but then because of her
[1:50:28] lifestyle she can be ugly okay uh as a
[1:50:32] jewel of gold and a swine snout so is a
[1:50:34] fair woman without I'm sorry which is
[1:50:36] without discretion so this just goes to
[1:50:38] show you can have outward Beauty a wife
[1:50:41] or a woman or anybody or man but in this
[1:50:43] case a woman a woman can be outwardly
[1:50:45] beautiful but if she's a evil
[1:50:48] character uh that beauty is just like a
[1:50:51] ring a gold ring and a in a snout or and
[1:50:53] the snout of a pig or schine right which
[1:50:56] it really isn't beautiful at all it's
[1:50:57] really gross and nasty and disgusting so
[1:51:00] it is is a beautiful woman that's not a
[1:51:01] Godly woman okay and brother Bram said a
[1:51:04] man that has his mind taken through a
[1:51:07] thinking man's filter the Bible he won't
[1:51:09] look at these strip teas teases and
[1:51:11] think they're beautiful because he knows
[1:51:13] they're miserable wretched snap swine
[1:51:16] like this so all these Hollywood women
[1:51:19] all these cheerleaders for the sports
[1:51:20] teams and things like that uh all these
[1:51:23] musicians and singers and everything
[1:51:25] like that that that the world thinks are
[1:51:26] beautiful they are a bunch of swine that
[1:51:29] got a gold ring around their snout
[1:51:31] praise God and a real Christian thinks
[1:51:34] that way if his mind is passed through
[1:51:35] the thinking man's filter the Bible
[1:51:38] Glory okay now or LD can you get
[1:51:41] 625 must not after her beauty inine
[1:51:44] heart neither let her take with with her
[1:51:47] eyelids okay so see what is what is
[1:51:49] Solon warned his son here Solomon warns
[1:51:52] his son that a woman has Beauty and you
[1:51:55] can't lust after it in your heart and be
[1:51:58] careful she'll take you with her eyes so
[1:52:00] look there's a way a woman can look at a
[1:52:02] a man in a lustful way right trying to
[1:52:04] draw him in okay that can be used in a
[1:52:08] bad way this is a bad way but it can
[1:52:09] also be used in a good way right in a
[1:52:11] marriage where a woman can be beautiful
[1:52:13] in a marriage and can send signals to
[1:52:16] her husband about you know the physical
[1:52:18] attractiveness and things like that
[1:52:20] and that's what the Bible talks about
[1:52:21] being ravished with the love of your
[1:52:23] spouse okay so see that can be used in a
[1:52:27] good way or that can be used in a bad
[1:52:28] way so sisters use it in the good way
[1:52:30] use it in the good way be attractive to
[1:52:32] your husband and give him the only looks
[1:52:35] that you would give you know to your
[1:52:36] husband only you wouldn't give to
[1:52:38] another man okay that's
[1:52:40] important all right now let's look at a
[1:52:42] few quotes
[1:52:44] here they asked brother brand is it
[1:52:46] wrong for a woman to curl her her hair
[1:52:49] he said I'm he said I don't care just
[1:52:50] keep it
[1:52:52] long he said I can't back that up with
[1:52:55] scripture I haven't got he said if you
[1:52:57] haven't got pretty curly hair and you're
[1:52:59] a woman and you want to look pretty for
[1:53:01] your husband or boyfriend or something
[1:53:02] like that I can't tell you curing your
[1:53:05] hair or what tinting it or something I
[1:53:07] have nothing to say about that that's up
[1:53:08] to you you just ask the Lord what to do
[1:53:11] and he'll tell you because I'm trying to
[1:53:12] explain things by scripture see what
[1:53:15] brother Brown say he say sisters if you
[1:53:16] want to curl your hair if you want to be
[1:53:17] pretty that's okay that's all right ask
[1:53:20] God about it see what God says right
[1:53:23] because it's in a woman to want to be
[1:53:25] pretty right women want to be pretty
[1:53:28] that's God made them that way brother ra
[1:53:30] said I have no I have no scripture that
[1:53:31] says a woman can't curl her hair he said
[1:53:33] just keep it long don't cut it right
[1:53:36] don't cut it it's okay to look pretty
[1:53:38] for your boyfriend it's okay to look
[1:53:39] pretty for your husband nothing wrong
[1:53:41] with that just make sure you pray about
[1:53:43] it first okay pray about it first
[1:53:45] especially if it's boyfriend and
[1:53:46] girlfriend or if you're courting
[1:53:48] especially pray about it then uh if it's
[1:53:50] before the engagement because you don't
[1:53:52] want to try to bring lust into the
[1:53:54] relationship right you don't want to
[1:53:55] bring that
[1:53:57] in okay here's where he says this about
[1:53:59] Eve Adam was a strong fine handsome
[1:54:02] looking man and Eve was one of the most
[1:54:04] beautiful women the Earth ever
[1:54:07] seen I can see them sitting there after
[1:54:09] God woke him up and see him sitting
[1:54:11] there by her side your beautiful figure
[1:54:13] beautiful hair hanging down her eyes is
[1:54:15] blue Sparkle with the stars of Heaven
[1:54:17] she never had to wear any of that here
[1:54:19] manicure no that's a wrong work or what
[1:54:23] you put on your lips and things like
[1:54:24] that she was pretty to begin with see
[1:54:27] that's the way Eve was she didn't e any
[1:54:29] of that makeup or anything like that she
[1:54:31] was already beautiful okay and that's
[1:54:33] the way a real Christian woman is
[1:54:35] without all that stuff she's already
[1:54:36] beautiful in God's eyes and the Man's
[1:54:38] eyes if he's a godly
[1:54:42] man all right now look what brother BR
[1:54:45] says here now this is the balance it out
[1:54:47] because women aren't supposed to be like
[1:54:48] Hollywood but he said pretty is as
[1:54:50] pretty
[1:54:51] does okay so a woman if they if they act
[1:54:54] pretty they'll be pretty right they got
[1:54:55] to act Godly and dainty and
[1:54:58] holy now he said he's talking about
[1:55:00] makeup he said if you'll add a little
[1:55:02] acts 224 mix it up all together and a
[1:55:04] little John 3 316 it'll be anything that
[1:55:07] maxor maxor ever to try to fix so
[1:55:11] instead of putting makeup and all these
[1:55:13] makeup brands on your face he said put
[1:55:15] acts 24 and John 3:16 on your
[1:55:17] face he said your husband will love you
[1:55:20] more everybody else will and I'm sure
[1:55:22] God
[1:55:23] will you see there's a balance to it a
[1:55:26] woman can't try to want to be pretty so
[1:55:28] much that she starts acting worldly
[1:55:29] she's got to have the anointing of the
[1:55:31] Holy Ghost on her face have the
[1:55:32] anointing of the Holy Ghost on her
[1:55:34] character and then the man will think a
[1:55:36] real Christian man will think she's
[1:55:39] beautiful all right now here's I want to
[1:55:41] bring this down for the Sisters to try
[1:55:43] to understand a Brother's Temptation
[1:55:45] here with his
[1:55:48] eyes okay brother tells us a marriage
[1:55:50] and divorce he said some of you women
[1:55:52] put on these nasty clothes and get out
[1:55:54] there and throw yourself before man and
[1:55:56] Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman
[1:55:57] to lust after her has already committed
[1:55:59] adultery with her already in his heart
[1:56:01] then who's the guilty the man or you now
[1:56:05] really both are guilty if a woman throws
[1:56:07] herself out there and shows off her body
[1:56:10] whatever more you know her body and the
[1:56:13] man lust they're both
[1:56:15] guilty right they're both guilty because
[1:56:18] she displayed too much
[1:56:20] and he didn't turn that he didn't cast
[1:56:22] down that evil thought they're both
[1:56:24] guilty but brother is making a statement
[1:56:26] he said the woman especially is guilty
[1:56:29] because he's a male made so he could
[1:56:31] take this act see and you're the female
[1:56:33] that ought to refuse so see female ought
[1:56:36] to refuse trying to be a lust object and
[1:56:38] shall to cover herself but again there's
[1:56:41] quotes Jesus said if a man looks in lust
[1:56:43] Jesus said he's guilty of
[1:56:45] adultery so both are guilty if a woman
[1:56:48] is dressing in mildy if a woman's
[1:56:50] dressing modestly and a man lust after
[1:56:51] her she's not guilty she's not because
[1:56:54] she didn't do anything wrong it's the
[1:56:56] man that's
[1:56:58] lustful and that's where a woman that
[1:56:59] dresses modesty she got to make sure her
[1:57:02] eyes and her looks aren't causing
[1:57:03] Brothers to lust right got to make sure
[1:57:05] she's holy and godly and not giving
[1:57:08] looks and having any lustful spirits on
[1:57:10] her and so
[1:57:11] forth but I want the sisters that know
[1:57:14] this those that are live streaming and
[1:57:15] those here A man is made to want to
[1:57:18] reproduce brother tells us that so it's
[1:57:21] a woman's duty to try
[1:57:22] to uh not cause any temptation to him
[1:57:27] okay that's her Duty and that's by
[1:57:28] dressing modestly and not flirting uh
[1:57:32] not sending any signals or anything like
[1:57:34] that now of course if they're married
[1:57:36] then yes they can sport like we saw with
[1:57:38] Isaac they could they can joke around
[1:57:40] they can be buddies and things like that
[1:57:42] they can love and romance and all kinds
[1:57:44] of things like
[1:57:46] that okay now here's another quote why
[1:57:48] we're not denomination and this is I
[1:57:50] think this is the last one we have this
[1:57:51] is the last one then we'll
[1:57:53] close boy one ill- Fame woman can send
[1:57:56] more people to Hell than all the bootleg
[1:57:58] joints you can put in a
[1:58:01] city that's right watch her go down the
[1:58:03] street with her clothes all stripped
[1:58:05] down don't care who the man is if he's a
[1:58:07] healthy normal man listen when he looks
[1:58:10] at that woman he's bound to have
[1:58:11] something to pass over
[1:58:13] him he's bound after something Passover
[1:58:18] him now just be honest he
[1:58:21] says see a man can't help it when a
[1:58:23] woman throws herself out like that he
[1:58:25] can't help it he's made to
[1:58:27] reproduce so he has something pass over
[1:58:30] him and you know what it is it's called
[1:58:32] dopamine for those of you who are uh
[1:58:37] scientists or no anatomy and physiology
[1:58:40] and I got I'm going to preach a whole
[1:58:42] sermon on just lust and pornography and
[1:58:44] things like that Lord willing as part of
[1:58:46] our marriage series a man as soon as he
[1:58:49] sees it these hormones start kicking in
[1:58:51] and dopamine goes in through through
[1:58:52] whole through his
[1:58:53] body and then the science says he's got
[1:58:57] a choice at that moment once he feels
[1:58:59] this dopamine go through him he's got a
[1:59:01] choice and it goes up to his frontal
[1:59:03] cortex this is his thinking right here
[1:59:05] it's decision making it starts the back
[1:59:08] here in the bottom of his I forget the
[1:59:09] name of it now it starts back in the
[1:59:11] bottom of his central nervous system and
[1:59:12] it shoots up all the way up to the FR
[1:59:15] frontal nervous or FR frontal
[1:59:17] cortex and he's got to make decision is
[1:59:20] he going to act upon that dopamine and
[1:59:22] try to have a sexual encounter or
[1:59:25] not and that's what he's got to decided
[1:59:28] every time church almost every time a
[1:59:30] man sees a woman like that that passes
[1:59:32] through him and he's got to make a
[1:59:33] decision am I gonna act upon this sexual
[1:59:36] reproduction am I going to go try to
[1:59:37] make a contact with this woman or not
[1:59:41] now most men what do they do they don't
[1:59:44] do the physical what do they do the
[1:59:46] spiritual fornication that's what most
[1:59:49] men do without the holy ghost or maybe
[1:59:51] those that are struggling with the Holy
[1:59:52] Ghost they they fall short of the glory
[1:59:54] of
[1:59:55] God everyone understand that brother B
[1:59:58] said I don't care I've had the Holy
[2:00:00] Ghost for years you can't look at a
[2:00:02] woman and her half dressed and not
[2:00:04] something pass over you I carry a little
[2:00:07] cross in my car many of you seen it so I
[2:00:09] hope that helps out our
[2:00:11] sisters pray for your husbands pray for
[2:00:13] your uh spouses pray for them because a
[2:00:17] man has he has a real challenge in that
[2:00:19] area just like a woman has a real
[2:00:21] challenge in the area of uh we talked
[2:00:23] about it on Sunday kind of like
[2:00:25] Assurance right she's always needs a
[2:00:27] reassurance she needs to be assured she
[2:00:29] needs affection she needs that love uh
[2:00:31] she need to be reassured okay well a man
[2:00:34] he has a a very hard battle with the
[2:00:36] physical part so man's got to be strong
[2:00:40] here uh in his human spirit and he's got
[2:00:42] to cast down when he feels that dopamine
[2:00:44] C uh pass through his body he's got to
[2:00:47] be able to say in the name of Jesus cast
[2:00:49] that lust devil down right I cast that
[2:00:53] lustful thought down in the name of
[2:00:54] Jesus or if he starts entertaining it
[2:00:56] said forgive me real quick Lord forgive
[2:00:58] me oh God I cast that evil thought I
[2:01:00] won't think of that God forgive me in my
[2:01:02] lust and then Jesus forgives
[2:01:05] him okay but it takes the real power of
[2:01:07] God all right let's stand to our feet by
[2:01:09] God's grace we'll stop right
[2:01:14] there I really hope that helps our
[2:01:16] sisters here tonight and of course the
[2:01:18] brothers as well
[2:01:19] by the grace of the
[2:01:23] Lord like I said we will uh we'll teach
[2:01:27] a whole message on that on the battle
[2:01:29] that a man has there's a book that came
[2:01:31] out a few years ago actually when I was
[2:01:32] in college it called it was called Every
[2:01:34] Man's
[2:01:35] Battle and of course then they made
[2:01:37] another book called every woman's battle
[2:01:39] uh but every man's battle was about the
[2:01:40] man's battle with uh the passion the
[2:01:44] physical intimacy passion that's in his
[2:01:46] members okay just in his body okay okay
[2:01:49] and it was a it from what I remember it
[2:01:50] was a good book from what I read I just
[2:01:52] can't remember much of it but brother
[2:01:53] bam tells us this is something we just
[2:01:56] have to be honest this is inside of a
[2:01:57] man and he's got to get victory over it
[2:02:00] okay that's why he needs a a spouse that
[2:02:03] will have family relations when he needs
[2:02:05] it that's why he needs a spouse that
[2:02:07] will be attractive to him uh and that's
[2:02:10] an important part of being a man there
[2:02:12] by God's grace okay let me turn it off
[2:02:14] by the grace of the Lord okay let's bow
[2:02:16] our heads tonight by God's grace let's
[2:02:17] have a word of Prayer
[2:02:24] I trust something was said tonight
[2:02:25] church that was a real blessing to you
[2:02:27] to help you out a long life's journey
[2:02:29] here like I said these are things that
[2:02:31] you know we don't often preach on in the
[2:02:33] 10 years I've been pastoring I think
[2:02:34] I've preached
[2:02:36] maybe two or three series on the family
[2:02:38] and marriage and I know we could use it
[2:02:40] you know probably more often um and like
[2:02:43] I said it does help the singles it does
[2:02:44] help the young people because it's it's
[2:02:47] instruction and righteousness that's
[2:02:49] what it is it's keeping the word of God
[2:02:52] it's preparation for those who are not
[2:02:54] in it it's also correction for those who
[2:02:56] are in
[2:02:58] marriages and these things are very
[2:02:59] important so let's have word of prayer
[2:03:01] and then we'll just sing a few songs and
[2:03:02] be
[2:03:03] dismissed dear heavenly father we bow
[2:03:05] our heads Lord we're thankful for
[2:03:07] tonight Lord thank you for these
[2:03:08] teachings of this scripture lord it's
[2:03:10] wonderful to see these things in the
[2:03:12] Bible it's wonderful to see the quotes
[2:03:14] Lord that we
[2:03:15] have Lord it was amazing to me when I
[2:03:17] first started studying this see how much
[2:03:19] your Prophet did say about these things
[2:03:22] so Lord we can't ignore it if your
[2:03:23] Prophet took time to say these things
[2:03:25] and teach on these things and people ask
[2:03:27] them questions about it it definitely
[2:03:30] meant a lot to them Lord so it meant
[2:03:32] something to your Prophet to tell us
[2:03:34] Lord we can see these all through the
[2:03:35] Bible Lord God we can see them all
[2:03:37] through the
[2:03:38] scripture so Lord I pray a special
[2:03:40] prayer tonight for the the wives that
[2:03:42] they'd be able to meet the needs of
[2:03:43] their husbands Lord I believe most of
[2:03:45] the sisters in our church that are
[2:03:47] married I believe most of them live
[2:03:48] stream are here here tonight so God I
[2:03:50] just pray these things would be a help
[2:03:52] Lord if they have questions Lord perhaps
[2:03:54] they can ask their husbands at home and
[2:03:56] then they don't have the answer they
[2:03:57] could ask me Lord i' be happy to help
[2:03:59] marriages Lord we Sur certainly want to
[2:04:01] strengthen them dear
[2:04:03] God we don't want to Satan coming in to
[2:04:05] tempt anyone because of uh
[2:04:08] incont because of uh that scripture I
[2:04:11] can't remember this the actual word
[2:04:13] there Lord God in continency I believe
[2:04:15] it was there God where where couples
[2:04:17] aren't having the time they need
[2:04:19] together Lord and we just pray again for
[2:04:21] the men that they'll meet the needs of
[2:04:23] their wives Lord because Lord this is
[2:04:25] the reason you put those needs inside of
[2:04:27] the women you put these needs inside of
[2:04:29] a man as your Prophet
[2:04:31] said a man's made to do that he can't
[2:04:34] help it A Woman's made to be like this
[2:04:36] way she can't help it she needs someone
[2:04:38] to love her and hug her and be
[2:04:39] affectionate Lord we're made this way so
[2:04:42] help us God to meet each other's needs
[2:04:43] especially those of us who are married
[2:04:45] Lord those of us who have vowed we gave
[2:04:48] a vow we promised you Lord that we would
[2:04:50] meet the needs of our spouse so help us
[2:04:52] to do that now in Godly humility Godly
[2:04:55] respects as we said Lord we believe the
[2:04:58] marriages that are right on this Earth
[2:05:00] will be a part of the marriage supper of
[2:05:02] the land dear God how's a marriage
[2:05:05] couple going to be part of the marriage
[2:05:06] supp of the Lamb if they're not living
