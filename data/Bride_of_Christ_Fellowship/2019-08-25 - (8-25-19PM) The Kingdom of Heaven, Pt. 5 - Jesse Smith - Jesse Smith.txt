for all Jesus has done let's go to Luke 19 I'd like to finish this thought about the parable of the pounds here tonight by God's grace and finish up some quotes on the talents like to finish this up Lord willing tonight Luke 19 appreciate those songs brother those a really wonderful great job ma'am Malachi and amen wonderful job brother praise God what a nice team they are working together praise God thank the Lord what a blessing hallelujah I just like to read verse 16 Luke 19 16 let's read 16 down to 18 once again I just want to emphasize this thought and I'd like to give a lot of examples tonight of equal opportunities for Christians you know in this parable everybody has the equal amount in the in the talents everybody had a different amount but in this one everybody had an equal amount so that must mean that everybody has equal opportunities in this life praise God and there are numerous scriptures about how that if we invest God will make our lives abound right so we will look at the scriptures about abounding and multiplying tonight because that's what we see in the scripture we see that these faithful servants invested and then their gifts multiplied and their gifts abounded so when I look at the scripture on that tonight so Luke 19 verse 16 if you're there say Amen I'll read verse 16 and then wall reads 17 so I'll read sixteen by myself then came the first saying Lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds let's all read seventeen one two three and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou has been faithful in a very little have now authority over ten cities and I'll read verse 18 and the second came saying Lord thy pound hath gained five pounds and he said likewise unto him be thou also over five cities that's that one more where to prayer if you have a need on your heart just making known unto God here my hands up I have I'm in need of the Lord's wisdom and understanding here Heavenly Father Lord we again bow our hearts to you great waymaker miracle worker Promise Keeper how we love this seeing Lord it makes our heart when it's saying when we realize we're loved by the king of kings and the Lord of lords nor to think I'm a son of a king Lord God and our sisters here are daughters of the king what a privilege lord help us to represent that Kingdom Lord the kingdom of God on this earth father give us Grace and wisdom tonight Lord and understanding teach us thy word Lord God and most of all may we remember may we obey it Lord and see the blessings in our lives bless your humble servants here tonight each one of us in Jesus Christ name the church said amen god best should be in see the praise God let's look to the scripture here tonight and I like to finish this on the pounds and then Lord willing we'll get to some quotes more quotes about gifts let's look here at these rewards let's start with how all this is equal you know we notice how everybody has a equal amount so let's show some scripture about how it's essential that everyone invest in the opportunities god gives us so we saw how talents everyone had different amounts and that's because Jesus was talking preachers and preachers are given different amounts how many member brother branham said Martin Luther had all nine gifts of the Spirit yet he would smoke a pipe I don't know God must have blinded his wisdom or something through that but yet he had all nine gifts of the Spirit John Wesley had he probably had all of them too and we know he prayed for his horse and I read scriptures I read history where he would just he read all the scriptures of healing to his dying friend and then his friend got miraculously healed right there you know they had many gifts of the Spirit mighty men of God but God has revealed more in each passing generation I'll restore saith the Lord so God's restoring more and more of course and this time the mystery of God is finished so God has revealed all the all the mysteries we know to go in the rapture he's revealed all of them there's certain things he won't reveal there's certain things he's saving to show us throughout all eternity of course he'll never reveal the day or the hour of the rapture he'll never reveal that we just got to be ready for that amen but the rest of it as far as salvation it's been fulfilled you know even on this last I'm sorry even on the fifteenth parable the seed that's cast into the ground now 15 doesn't mean anything it's just my my order I put them in don't worry about the number 15 you know I just I'm just saying that because it's 15th on my list but the seed cast in the ground I always wonder what that parable was about and now with the understanding of all the quotes but I am gave us we can see that this applies to the three works of grace because this parable we'll get to it may be next week Lord willing but Jesus says the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a seed cast into the ground right the man sleeps he rises he doesn't know how the seed comes forth but it brings forth a blade and then the ear and then the full corn in the ear right and so what now we know Jesus said the kingdom of God is what it's in you so it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost so now apply what brother Graham said in what Jesus said about that and apply that to this parable about the three three stages of growth of a wheat plant so we know with all that understanding it has to line up and these three stage what three stages are connected to the kingdom of heaven what three stages are connected to the Holy Ghost baptism it has to be justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God his mother may have said he said it's my message the message I've always preached that God works in three stages justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost so see Church I believe God is revealing more and more of these things to us why so we can know them and we can be assured of the message that we've heard amen because you know there's many scriptures I can't get tonight but Paul always one of the hearts of the people to be established that means he wanted us rooted and grounded he didn't want us wondering if are we in the truth or not is this the right thing or not but I believe the Holy Spirit has been here it's here in the message it's here backing up the message that God gave us it's here to reveal more of the word to prove to us that the mystery of God is finished and that we have received the truth and we must remain planted in Christ amen so now back to the the talents here I'm sorry the pounds so each servant has an equal amount of money and this is totally different than the parables where they had differing amounts so if here money's equal so it can't represent spiritual gifts because gifts are not given equally right the Bible said do all speak in tongues no do all prophesy no are all apostles no right and then Paul said I speak in tongues more than everybody right so he had such gifts and such he had to bend a five town preacher if there ever was a five town preacher it had it been so laboured more than all of them abundantly so Paul preachers would have different gifts because their leaders and apostles and after you Americans and wonders to take the gospel to new places here what could be equal amongst all Christians what do we have all in common and the answer is we all have one opportunity we all have one life right now and there's even more to it than that we all have a home right we have a job most of us have a job or if we're not working a job we're working in the home as mothers right or grandmothers that's a job it's just as real it's probably harder than the other job right even though they're not paid God's gonna pay em amen you all have family all family members that's equal we all friends we are friends we can witness - right that's equal and we all have access to some money right that's equal everybody has equal access so this is as I was meditating and praying on this text these are the thoughts that came to me my we have all these equal things it's equal it's not different bangs got as many hours of the week as I do right you've got as many hours and we as many minutes as as others and we can choose well it's our choice with what we do with that equal amount of time and let me show you I made a list one year and I don't have it ready so I'm not gonna worry about it but I have a copy in there if you'd like a copy I made a list of all the rewards Jesus offers to everybody see that there's are so many rewards that Jesus offers and it's equally given anyone if they invest in the kingdom of God can earn these rewards so let's go through them quickly Matthew 5:11 if you withstand persecution it yields a great heavenly reward so standing firm in the midst of persecution you get a reward and the Bible says all who live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution so that's one another thing that's equal persecution rejection right next giving alms in secret Jesus didn't say if you want to give alms he said when you give alms do it in secret Matthew 6 4 so that's an equal opportunity everybody has a chance to see someone poor and maybe help them out with a couple bucks or just take them a lunch if you don't trust them with cash take them a lunch they comes everybody has a equal opportunity we all know people that are hurting right financially we can take anybody a lunch or meal how about praying in seeker everybody's got some place they can pray in their house hopefully hope you have some private place you can pray everybody can pray it's it's an opportunity and Jesus said if you pray I'll reward you openly fasting everybody can fast now nursing mothers I wouldn't advise it I don't see that in the scripture but if you're nursing I would imagine don't fast unless the Lord lead you but you got to feed that baby and you know one hurt yourself but everybody else has the opportunity to fast Jesus and say if you want to Jesus actually said when I leave that's when my servants will fast so we to be a people who fast from time to time now it's got to be led of the Lord right it's gotta be let allured and of course she'll be you'll be tested and fasting remember when Daniel tested three weeks it wasn't a complete fast he just let off all the wine and all the meats all the fancy food so he must have went on a vegetarian diet or something like that or a wheat or grain diet or something like that it's a very simple diet he just drank water no wine just water and vegetables for three weeks and that's when God you know we looked at that a few weeks ago with the kingdom of God how Michael helped the angel break through and defeat the Prince of Persia and bring down the answer to Daniels prayer also receiving a prophet or a righteous man yields a prophet or righteous man's reward brother Branham said that's just the benefits of knowing a prophet now I feel like this I've heard so many testimonies like this I'm sure sister Karen has and Brenda over the years people will listen to brother branham's sermons and get and get discerned in brother branham's sermons like they'll have someone in the prayer line who's that has the same problem or the same name and then God heals them I've met numerous people that have done that and bo-ram said that's a Prophet's reward it might come in handy sometime so church that's why you listen to brother Branham keep reading brother Branham there's no there's a one there's a nice quote where Bram says and it really encouraged me he's talking about pastor Smith how pastor Smith was such a good man that really encouraged me pastor Smith but see I kinda I needed that little encouragement you know he said all paths are smooth he's such a good brother you know but but that that's the benefit and church the other benefit let me say this is that you and I know the pillar fires here because he backs up the word that brother branham brought because we know now we know what the Holy Spirit is it's the pillar of fire and he's returning in the end time right because as he was with Paul he's returning in the end time because God sent a prophet the pillar fires here in other words the Holy Spirit's here praise God another benefit like I said on Wednesday I don't know if y'all heard it but when I went to Iowa on Saturday night I preached and I was closing with talents and I've said brother come up here and I kind of hold him up and I said let's pretend you meet Jesus and Jesus will say what did you do with the talent that I gave you and he told me later after the service he said there was a total discernment because he used to be a song leader and he felt bad because he stopped song leading and he was telling the people that he was neglecting his talents so everybody knew it I didn't know it was him I didn't know what was going on I just had come up here and so after we got in the back he fell on his knees that no one asked him he just found a zz said God Jesus Christ is speaking to me right now he said you brothers pray for me so see that's like the spirit of discernment it discerns what's in people's hearts and lives and he's the only one I caught up to the front to do that to and I didn't plan that it was just letter the Holy Spirit and then the next day there was a preacher sitting right up front I didn't know it wasn't brother Brooks it was the other preacher and I started preaching on the four horse riders and how the white red black and pale how Satan works in that way to divide churches and here because he goes out he first comes in real sly like white and then he starts killing people's influence or gossip in the church he'll start two groups in the church and third is the black that's the money and the kingdom building so a prize up in the church and divided the church against the pastor to get tithing and money and build his own kingdom and then they go into spiritual death if an avenue they never repent and little did I know but the preacher that was sitting right there he did that to brother Brooks he brought his truiy or that they were all there that came to the church they were there for a while all happy one family but then he started pulling the people away and started a little church in his basement to get the tithing and brother Brooks brought him back just he invited him to come to our services when I was preaching there I said I said brother Brooks now that stuff between you and him you got to go deal with that by God's grace right I'm preaching right in front of him like I'm standing like right in front of him preaching like this right right there and you look nervous the whole time I wonder if now I know why he wasn't really into the preaching see because Satan hates to be exposed see so we have the pillar of fire here he's discerning our life because he's the word and the word is a discerner of the thoughts and hence of the heart the thing to do though is recognize when he's discerning our word that's the time to believe because even brother Rams get the discernment but medicine my gift can't make you believe you've still got to accept it amen so if the Holy Spirit discerns your need or desert something you need then it's your time to rise up in faith and say okay I know God's here he's gonna answer my prayer hey hey man and that's where I need to grow and we all need to grow in that recognizing his presence and accepting his word amen now you know Matthew 25 the parable of the white throne judgment sheepish goats there are six things the people will do and they'll get eternal life for those six things next Matt mark 941 giving an apostle a cup of water for Christ's sake yields a reward Luke 6 loving your enemies blessing those who persecute you praying for those who despitefully use you and lending with no hope of repayment yields a great reward along with the title of being called the children of the highest I preached a Iowa brother Brooke said that was just for him he said he's been he's been being used lately and he said I need to learn to pray for those people who use me so that was a blessing to me like wow I thought why am i preaching this he needed it praise God so sometimes we got to be used and just pray for them hosting a feast for less fortunate who cannot repay you or invite you over to their house Reed yields a recompense at the resurrection of the just the Bible says so when you have a when you have a meal at your house and invite people who can't pay you back there's a reward for that praise God of course fighting the good fight of faith finishing the course keeping the Christian faith yields a crown of righteousness providing a Christians physical necessities yields a heavenly reward upon the givers account like Paul said he said you've given it to me it'll bound on your heavenly account doing anything heartily as doing it to Christ yields a reward of inheritance according to Colossians 3:23 doing anything with your heart so brothers sisters we got to go to work tomorrow do with all your heart be the best you can be how many want to be the best you can be doing anything for the Lord yields a reward in heaven so see I want to be a teacher that's doing it for Christ's sake right I want to be a pastor doing it for Christ's sake to glorify Christ I'm working for him doing it heartily yields the Lord of inheritance diligently seeking God yields reward Hebrews 11:6 and during temptation yields the crown of eternal life James 1:12 visiting the fatherless see anybody can visit the fatherless this summer I made a special trip to visit some children who are now fatherless their dad divorced their mom and left so we made a special trip to go visit them and I told the mother there that's why I was there to do that visiting the widows keeping self keeping oneself unspotted from the world yields the reward of spiritual purity so if you want to feel pure keep yourself keep the world off yet that's your reward I feel pure I feel like I'm clean before the Lord and the last one is is eleven fold how many know there's eleven rewards for the church ages two he that overcometh remember those there's seven of those statements but there's actually 11 different things listed in there let me read them to you here's your reward if you overcome Church the first thing you get to eat of the Tree of Life escape the second death eat the hidden manna you get a white stone with a new name within it you get power to rule over Nations you get the Morningstar white raiment you have your name in the book of life you're a pillar in the temple of God you have Jesus new name God's new name the new Jerusalem's new name written upon you and your with Jesus in the throne amen glory that makes me feel religious amen those are all rewards if we overcome right now overcome Laodicea overcome the devil and these are for everybody there not just for preachers or brother Branham there for everybody it's all equal praise God we all have equal chance to overcome do we not then the Bible say temptation is common to all men it's common if you're fighting something be encouraged somebody has already fought that before and you know Jesus did praise God and you know he overcame so you can overcome as well hallelujah so there you go Church there is a list of all things equal these are all equal things that we can new we just gotta ask the Lord lead me so I can invest in those things or show me or open my I'll said I just open my busy eyes to those who are hurting around me praise God because we're all busy and that's good you want to be busy you want to work hard I want to work hard I want to be busy I don't wanna be lazy I'd rather be busy than lazy but our our prayers Lord open our eyes so we can see some of these needs we might be overlooking and try to minister to other people who have needs praise God alright now let's let me do a few more quotes on talents and then we'll get to this abounding thought how the Bible says we do abound and multiply it's very scriptural let me pull this up so I don't miss this okay now let's get back to singing brother Branham has a quote here from 1955 about singing he says what a disgrace I've seen beautiful voices that God has given to people a talent and they over trained it I hate to hear an overtrained voice where they stand up and sing and get some kind of a note to they hold it they hold it so long do they get blue in the face now amen doesn't do that Malachi doesn't do that and when I love these songs I don't do that so I'm not preaching against any of our singers here just so you know but you've seen it you know you see it on the talent shows you know if you ever seen now of course you don't watch him but maybe you'll see them on Facebook or something like that they hold it to they get blue in the face just to show the congregation how they can hang on for dear life see Church that we don't want it we don't want to do any gift to impress other people we want to do it to glorify Christ now that's the reason they have talent shows is though that so they can impress the congregate or I'm sorry not the congregation well it might be their sinful congregation well that's why they do it to impress the audience or the judges they hold out their voice he said and when they come back down then people's not praising God their minds on their note that they hit you've all seen it even some gospel preachers or gospel singers they'll sing just to show off the note that they can hit and what do people clap for for the note many times or the ability rather than the praise to Almighty God now let me say this too let's balance balance out this thought about overtrain we want to train ourselves but we don't want to over train trying to impress other people remember the court about painting my man said oh if you'd only develop that but man was worried the gift and talent would be wasted right he said oh if I could send that boy to school or to really learn how to sew see you got to balance out all these quotes right after I understand what he's saying over train that doesn't mean we shouldn't train it just means don't train in the way that you want to impress the people train in a way that you can invest in your gift that it glorifies God praise the Lord he said then people's not praising God their minds on their note he said I love good old-fashioned fashioned Pentecostal singing where you raise up your hands with tears running down from your cheeks whether you could sing doremi faso latino or not and just singing the spirit from the heart you give praise to God all out of the program you have to get out of man's program to get in God's program he said oh God deliver me from being an actor be what you are god bless you you even down see sometimes ministers will do that they will get in the pulpit and make their voice very big now I've got to be careful that too sometimes but I'm sometimes I'm just so passionate that's why I'm loud but I have to watch myself so I don't get loud just to try to get an amen see because the Spirit of God doesn't matter how loud you are or quiet you are if it's the Spirit of God and the people are pulling and enjoying then this people will say Amen so see I've got to watch that he said just be yourself people who appreciate you more don't you believe that just be plain old sassafras hickory smoked ham sorghum molasses it'll do you good you won't put on I've tried it I've tried to be myself we want all of our musicians just be themselves praise God and everything they do train practice for the glory of God do everything for the glory of God now this will help our sisters here's a good one about a housewife but there's got a few few sentences before that he said just because you're a believer certainly you have everlasting life but do you want to just get in as Jobe said by the skin of your teeth would you just want to come before the Father and the talent he has give every one of you as being negligent you just didn't use it or let something else stand in your way you let little petty things that meant nothing to you after all little fusses and stews and arguments in church attendant I'm sorry Church differences take the meekness and gentleness from your life would you want to stand before the father like that I don't believe you would I don't believe that you would do it neither would I how I want him to say it was well done not by the skin of my teeth but it was well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord for you did well with what you have to do he said maybe you're a housewife I know we got multiple housewives here tonight if you are God made you a teacher of your chilled I know about you church but many times women have the gift of wisdom many times gift of knowledge because they have to teach these precious souls did you catch that romance had a housewife he said you're a teacher of your children remember program said who did brother Aaron say his correction was Mita he said you know my wife she's my correction he said he said you understand don't you brothers to see many times our sisters will have gifts of wisdom and alls they have to do is just yield that to the Holy Spirit a gift of knowledge to teach their children or to be a blessing of their husband or her blessing to some brother sister if God will lead them to share something he said you housewives if God made you a teacher of your children do a good job of it regardless of what you have to do do it well amen see our dad should be the best dads they could be our moms should be the best moms they should be whatever we do let's not be negligent let's invest in what God's given to us praise God he said don't let anything stand in your way housewives of being a good mother to the children praise God dads don't let one thing stand your way dad's to being a good father to your children ha ha hallelujah I hope that was a blessing you're a teacher housewives do it well praise God here's another one I'm thankful for how many thankful for doctors ever been helped by doctor now we know there's corrupt ones but there was corrupt preachers too you know there there's both sides right there's extremes but he said doctors have talents but Ram said I have high regards for medical profession and I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't make that up that's what exactly what he said a lot of people look down on doctors but you shouldn't but Ram said I have high regards for the medical profession surgery and so forth who with the talents of God has given them to do certain things to the body to operate and remove teeth that's not that's got bad and so forth I appreciate that praise the Lord now me I don't like touching anything bloody if there's someone sick I'm like honey where yet darlin dr. Kristen where are you most the time but on me I don't really mind it on me so much if I got like a little cut or something or scrape I don't mind it on me but if it's one of the kids I get off I get all nervous of the lightheaded my brother will actually pass out if he sees blood my brother Sam when when they had their first baby he was in the delivery room and he passed out and he felt completely back and smashed his head against the ground because he's so nervous around blood I never did that but a couple times I felt queasy you know but he said doctors have talents and I appreciate them but he said there comes a time when they are beyond their knowledge they don't know what to do so he says then if it's beyond their knowledge we have a perfect right he said if the doctor fails to know it he'll go to someone a little bit higher than his he said and now if the specialist doesn't know I'm glad we got another resource the great physician a man praise God so see who use as your letter the Holy Spirit you use doctors as your lead but if they don't have the answer that we all all that's left is to go to the great physician Jesus Christ there's been numerous times I prayed for my personal doctor I prayed for him last time - can I just pray and he says thank you thank you thank you I gave my book a few weeks ago and I've seen him there I said he said Oh would you sign it no I don't I don't care about signing books I just hope he reads it but but see I love thank God for doctors I like to pray for them I like to join my friend and that God will bless them that they can help others and he told me last time he said of all the people I meet the people that pray they're the ones who get well faster amen he can recognize that you know he's not even born again but he can recognize my the people that love God and pray God heals them hallelujah now let me go the next one here this is from what is in your hand this is a good quote he says now the people that are unsaved they've just got a mental attitude towards the word they'd never been born again they don't know what it means to be baptized in the body Christ by the Holy Spirit let them take inventory just now Lord and consider and whatever you put in their hand may they raise that hand to you and give whatever little talent they have to you if it's no more than a testimony at least they've got a hand they can raise it and what's in their hand thou can place we ask for Christ's sake praise God so this is George everybody's got something your hand look at your hand for a moment everybody's got something in there praise God brother man gave the example remember Moses had the rod and God used the rod to bring judgment right bo-ram said the boy with the lunch what do you have in his hand a lunch so God used that food to bless other people so whatever's in your hand God's gonna use what's in your hand and multiply it if you'll just give it to him amen praise God said whatever I've got now remember about RAM I read this on Wednesday night I read where brother Ram said he said how do you know you don't have the gift to testify he said why don't you go try it praise God if you're not sure what gift you have brother ask brother Ram would program what if I don't have a gift by the Rams in other words saying well how do you know if you don't try you have to try you have to feel letting the Holy Spirit other in other words you have to overcome fear amen see that's that's what I believe got to amateurs in church to overcome fear so we're not afraid to do what we feel the Holy Spirit upon our hearts to do like I just felt led to pray for Brian Hawkins he had he was one that was going to have the hip replacements but now God healed him that's why I didn't I just felt led to do it something just came over me to go do it you know he's saying he's got to get two hip replacements I'm like he's 42 he's a preacher force he should have to have hip replacements something just came over me to go pray amen and then God answered the prayer hallelujah so see just trying to learn how to overcome fear and follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God so doctors well Graham said he was so devoted to his ministry he said I come home for a little rest I lost 20 pounds in the last meeting and the brothers looked at him brother Mercer and goed he said brother Branham I noticed what about you you put your whole heart into his ministry I said that's the only way you can do a right cup for the Lord is put everything you got to the forefront for Christ or your strength or your soul or your heart or your mind everything you got when you're doing anything do it or don't do it at all see just leave it alone if you're going to be a Christian put everything you've got to Christ that's your time your talent your everything he said I was just noticing brother Byrne sitting there he said he said it's a piano whether it's an organ or some kind of instrument they make a strum and pick it do something for the Lord maybe you could do that and sing that's to win souls do something no matter if you can whistle well whistle just do something just testify or do something for the kingdom of God whatever you got put it to use in God's service hey hey man whatever you've got look in your hand whatever's in your hand do it for the Lord some of you sisters maybe could you know how to do good deals or maybe know how to sew you should make clothes for the the poor something like that that's a good ministry that's a Bible ministry Tabitha had that ministry to make clothes for the poor right remember Anna Anna's prayer ministry was prayer and fasting she did that for all those years and finally she got to see Jesus the Messiah she got the whole baby Jesus amen after all those years of praying and fasting in her ministry God rewarded her with seeing the Lord's Christ amen ah there's so many different ministries out there that we can do we're all given this opportunity to do something for the Lord we've got to see what God placed in our hands now it's telling the Saints you know when I wrote when I wrote the book about modesty in Iowa they were asking me about the and they liked it and their brother Brooks has given some out and everything I said I said brothers I said I don't take any credit for that God is the one who gave me a lot of those thoughts like for example when I was in college at Akron I would go into a class it would be called a nonfiction class where we just learned about nonfiction books and in numerous of those classes the teacher would hold up examples of books and one of them is what Americans wore their clothes and their makeup from 1776 to the present time like I remember still sitting in that class on Akron's campus like that's why I'm in this class I'm in this class to get that book in other words that was what God put in my hand and that was my job to take it to the gospel amen take it to all the people that they can hear the truth about history that's what was in my hand what's in my hand I'm in a college room what's in my hand a book about my honesty and modesty so what should I do with it let God use what's in my hand aim ahead and take it out I just had a good testimony on Amazon some some stranger said the Lord directed me to your YouTube page I found your book I bought it and I know about all these copies that pass out to my family and friends I don't know her name's Kate with a caterer though see CA te she gave me a five-star review but hopefully that's because Jesus the five-star general praise God it's it's his word so he gets all the stars but she said I wasn't even looking for God brought that book to me so see there's a deep call to the deep whatever's in our hand that's what we got to give to Jesus amen hallelujah see to win so sobre he said you can win souls by playing music singing by singing you can win souls see what you'll do is your influence people to give their hearts to Christ I told you this when I gave my heart to Christ you know what God used God used Cam's Christian CDs ffh one of these days there are a Christian contemporary they don't know the message they cut their hair they wear pants you know but that is the Avenue God used to soften this stone heart amen I would drive his car his stick shift car little white Metro I think it was out to see Kristin before I was a Christian I got to see there and that cam I let cams Christian music playing pretty soon I started liking that one of these days they're gonna see Jesus in heaven and it wasn't long just a few months after that I gave my heart to Christ God used musics I'm told that the camera I want to remind him God use him and his music to win my soul amen see God gives us these gifts and it's all working to win souls remember like that man who found that you know where we spend eternity in his hand see somebody inspired God inspires somebody to make a track and to pass them out and one time it had an effect Church like my man says maybe you're just caught here to save one soul amen so save that soul with all you've got amen if five Souls or 20 Souls whatever you do do give everything you got he says put everything all your mind heart soul into what you've got your talent and God will bless it last year I got that email when someone saw my video on water baptism and the Lord Jesus Christ they said thank you and they ended it by saying god bless you you say my soul now I hope they keep that testimony because I didn't ask him for that they're the ones that said that is the preaching of the gospel just on the YouTube the preaching can save souls we just give everything we have to try to win souls for Christ hallelujah you're gonna like this one this one blew me out of my chair yesterday the door to the heart 1958 but Ram said n2u other ministering brothers that's been the meetings some day when it's all over just think when all these great choirs gather together won't it be wonderful so we don't have a choir here I guess well maybe nature and my girls are the choir here because they've sung together a couple times maybe that's the choir Bride of Christ fellowship choir amen he said so program sees all these choirs in different churches and he said you might say brother branham do you believe that they'll still have their talent in heaven what do you think brother Ram said certainly sure they were given that talent forever oh yeah amen they were arrested all these choirs they were given that talent for eternity program says you say that's in the Bible if you notice when the Witch of Endor called up the spirit of Samuel he was still a prophet died and he was in the heart of the earth in the bosom of Abraham and he was still a prophet a man if God give you a gift to sing you'll be singing the choir over in heaven amen hahaha how do you see so gifts are for eternity praise God didn't Jesus tell the 12 apostles and of course Matthias takes the place of Judas or mom sorry Paul takes a place actual play sympathize didn't Jesus tell them you're gonna sit and judge the 12 tribes of Israel because Apostle is the setter and order program says that's another word to say a leader and overseer so whatever they were on earth that's what they'll be in heaven hallelujah and so we must be thankful for what God's given us recognize what's in our hand be faithful with it and we'll be that forever praise God hallelujah he was still a prophet so death only moves us from a different place of abiding amen there is just for a little while for a little while and that's one that's eternal so we're looking to that day Oh hallelujah praise God that's beautiful church I hope you like that when I was a real blessing in my heart praise the Lord here's her brother M says about gifts he said God gives gifts this is from Queen of the South 58 he says he never takes gifts oh look at this he never takes gifts your gift remains but if you be honest with what you got God will take other talents and just keep pouring them on if you just keep climbing on I liked his choice of words don't you if you keep climbing up further it's climbing easier hard anybody no hard you got to be in good shape do you know there's a record number of people that died on my are Mount Everest this year because they they weren't they weren't really fit to climb and there were so many people trying to climb they got so backed up a record number of people died and one time I read the article that said this the the guy told them you have to turn around or you are going to die he told the three people in a row in his group and all three of them said no I'm going on to see if I can make it and all three of him died he said Mount Everest has never killed anybody he said it's arrogance that's killed people and isn't that the truth seek you have to spend what thirty thousand to go there and so these people spent thirty thousand they're like I'm not turning back I can make it and they died my brother man says you and I must keep climbing on but listen we can we can live up there where Eagles praise God we can handle a climb in the mountains amen because we fly above the mountain amen he said keep climbing on if you'll just be honest with what you've got God will keep pouring on gifts unto you how many want God to pour on more of the gifts on your life more understanding of your gifts but he's got to be honest with what you got that's why I want to review that in the next few weeks I want to have some time I'm just I'm just kind of stating I don't know how it's gonna be I've lost the file lady leadership of the Holy Spirit I've never done that before but we got to take some time and really examine and maybe take a couple weeks and just think about that let's list all the examples of supernatural we've seen it through our lives and then through other people's lives and then we can go and when if we know someone has a certain gift of wisdom we should pray and fast and see if God would have us to approach that person for wisdom life or a word of wisdom or we know somebody has the gift of healing let's pray and fast if we're sick and say can you join me in prayer I mean that with me many times he said can you pray for me and God will answer our prayer you know cuz we'll join our faith together right we put our faith together there's no man that can heal only Christ can heal but God likes for us to exercise our faith amen he likes to move through the gifts that he's given to us see we got to be honest with what we got keep climbing and God will pour out more gifts upon us now that scripture so let's go I want to show that in the scripture oh yeah yeah right there in Luke 19 yeah Luke 19 yeah verse 24 that's scriptural brother am is exactly scriptural he said God won't take the gifts from you see but what he'll do is he'll give the opportunities or ministries to other people okay so let's see that verse 24 and he said to them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds see that God is taking the opportunities and gifts I'm sorry the opportunities I'll say and ministries of the one pound or the third worker with the one pound and he's giving it to the guy who had 10 pounds and that's exactly what the Bible says seek because the Bible says in acts 1 because Judas left his position what a God had to do next man up right who's gonna fill his spot God has a special spot there amen God's got a room for you and I church God's got a ministry for you and I appreciate brothers amen and fill in the room of song leader I'm feeling the room of pastor banks feeling the room of Trustee you know there's there's all these rooms sing song specials there's a room for song special there's all the rule all these rooms we got to fill the room that God has for us now I told you this earlier I'll read it out of history Mathias laboured greatly for Christ preaching in Judea before his missionary work of converting souls to Jesus in Cappadocia so he actually left out of Judea and went to Cappadocia he says Matthias died as a martyr by crucifixion in the region round about the Caspian Sea he died a martyr and the Bible said he gets a martyr's crown for that see that was Judas his spot Judas who should have died a martyr if he would have been faithful but he died by suicide right instead of dying as a martyr in honor and victory glory amen dying like his Lord Jesus praise God Matthias did that he died like his Savior but Judas sold it out and died in dishonor someone took his pal Matthias took his pout his opportunity to the highest calling in the Bible that's the what the Bible says revelation 3:11 says behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou has that no man take that crown praise the Lord let's say I got back sin and I gave up the pastor ship here and it was not ordained of God somebody could come in here and take my crown praise the Lord you understand if God has the ministry that our brother prayed for god save and his family and all the saints you know that got saved under this ministry and now that herb let being blessed God had a room here God had a ministry and if I'm not faithful with it God could take me out he could bring somebody in and somebody could take my crown see that see Matthias seems have taken Judas's crown that Judas forfeit or we might say Paul took his place there's there's some different thoughts on that remember 2nd John 1:8 says look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward amen praise God let's close with this thought here about multiplying see bro Graham says God's not gonna give away your gift to somebody else he said but that ministry will be taken and given to somebody else ok like I've seen yesterday I was I was curious this one brought this one preacher left a message well I'll just say it Chris Hall you I don't know if you know Chris aw he preached a sermon seen message the first one I heard that brought me into the message as beautiful as the most glorious sermon I've ever heard on serpent seed well yesterday I was kind of thinking about what's happened to him well he went and he started a church in Tallahassee and it's like a kind like a mega church like Joel Osteen well they didn't make it they folded but I was just thinking about that like God gave him a great ministry in the message he was traveling all around the world preaching the gospel but because something happened I don't know exactly the details somebody offended him or something and then there was adultery and there were some sexual sins going on there he forsook that ministry and then God has raised enough other preachers to take that place because if if a person won't be faithful with the ministry God has God will bring in somebody else it's exactly right God will take one person and fill in with somebody else praise God just like with Saul Saul is the clearest example God said you were gonna serve forever if you were just faithful you would have this throne forever but God said because you're not I'm getting rid of you the Bible said God took his mercy away from Saul God will take his mercy away and God will find a man after his own heart to put in that place amen a David alleluia man that loves the Lord amen well holiday all right get your Bibles ready let's finish with this here are you joining us tonight hope it's a blessing see there's talents where everybody has different but then there's pounds where everybody's the same there are certain things where it's the same everybody can achieve as much as you invest you'll get a reward it's equal it's equal and that's why there's differences in these parables that's what's why Jesus said one to the multitude and one to the preachers you know he he's trying to get everybody to see that they have something valuable God gave them alright so here it is let's start with the statute over man 2nd Peter 1:8 let's go there now I'm going to turn there with you 2nd Peter 1:8 I appreciate your patience you've been doing wonderful audience I mean that you've been really Poland looking at me and I appreciate that pulling on the word of God bless you second Peter 1 verse 8 we're trying to go places Church we're trying to go place with our church that we never been before right we're trying to go to spot where we see God moving more in our mitts like brother Steve was telling me the church he was used to be at before he came here they had gifts operating like discernment and tongues interpretations and healings and miracles where people would like something let's say he said somebody be about the altar and someone would just get the Holy Spirit on him come up and pray out loud over that person and discern what they were praying about and they get the victory is that right bro Steve that's what he told me earlier and that beautiful I'll see what you really got to be under the anointing of God do that right you really got to give giving all to Jesus praise the Lord but see not all the gifts you know well brother I've said all the gifts should be in every church but not we don't know when they'll be there like we don't know what time we don't know what season also we know is that God is restoring all that Pentecost had God will restore to the bride and if we're a part of that bride we want to see it restored in our church but see we are with these sermons I'm trying I'm praying that God will take us to a place where we've never been before a more dedicated life in Christ more discipline life and more stewardship over the gifts he's given to us praise God okay second Peter 1:8 oh you're good Lydia Lord bless you now remember he just listed that nine building blocks and then charity is the capping off right so there's eight total for if these things be in you and multiply that word means multiply remember the tailless they multiply they went from one to ten one to five remember the talents they multiplied by two five to ten two to four so the Bible says if you keep all these attributes in you these character qualities and they abound and multiply they'll make you that you're neither barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ so I don't want to skip over that because that's the word for multiply if we want to multiply we just gotta remain attached to Christ we just got to make sure we always have faith and virtue and knowledge and and temperance and brotherly kindness and godliness and all these things we got to make sure all these are flowing and the Bible said through that God will multiply the fruits of the Spirit in our lives praise God hallelujah so let's go to that one John 15:1 here's where Jesus said you just gotta let these things abide in you see the character of Christ abides in us when we abide in him now let me just say there's two this doesn't mean you know you never listen to the news or anything like that brother Graham listen to the news you know he said he would catch it when he was driving around or reading the newspaper but the thing to do is while you're looking at the news don't get distracted into evil thoughts right try not to hate the politician you know try not to think evil or hate all the Democrats or hate all the Republicans no we want to hate sin but see as you do that you have as you look at those things you have to abide in the word still and for me I found it good I just pray for them I pray for them and God answered two of those prayers Ohio defunded Planned Parenthood I know if you saw that Ohio cut off 7 and 1/2 million to Planned Parenthood how the new yeah and I just pray for that last week and then Planned Parenthood just turned down 65 million dollars they're no longer no longer getting federal funding anymore all in the same week glory and I was all my face cried out to God changed some things so God just knows what I don't I just believe God had you know God had us pray for that we pray for that before you know I remember months ago we were praying for that but just continue to pray continue to believe God can move mountains amen 2nd Peter I'm sorry yeah John 15:1 of course this is right before Jesus got to the Garden of Gethsemane Judas had already left out betray Christ and now he's just talking with them and he says I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that bears fruit he purges it that it might bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I've spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I'm the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing I'm gonna go to verse 7 if a man abide not in me he is cast forth cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them in the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I'm gonna read eight hearing as the father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples can the church say Amen our blueberry bush we print I think my wife pruned it if not either way it's really producing multiplied blueberries it's done now but this year right children it was just bigger and bigger every year if you keep it if you if it abides in the ground if you abide it with the minerals if you abide with the water the sunlight it will multiply Jesus says the same thing works for you and I we will multiply the gifts he's given to us if we abide in the word keep quoting the word keep praying the word believing the word it will multiply it will abound in our lives amen hallelujah you know Paul said to abound in everything that's in second Corinthians 808 7 let's go there in this case it was giving to the Macedonian Church Paula seling the Corinthians listen you really got to act on this you told me you were gonna send them money or food you need to act on that second Corinthians 87 so see church why if we say something if we give our obligation with our words let's do everything we can to keep it let's do everything we can to keep it that's what Paul is telling the Corinthians you said you were gonna help the Macedonians you need to do it eight seven therefore as you abound in everything in face so see how faith there's a bound that means multiply your face your multiplied your utter and should multiply your knowledge multiplied and in all diligence multiply and in your love to us see that you abound in this grace also all right I was looking for the scripture where he says you need to do it well yeah verse 11 now prefer therefore perform the doing of it do it help out the Macedonians then as there were as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have so the Macedonians had helped out the Corinthians now Paul saying listen you need to return that blessing if they helped you now they're in need you need to help them and act upon it perform what you said you'd do okay here's another one Philippians 1:9 let's go there Philippians 1 almost done I got just two more scriptures I grow I'm said if the preaching won't pop you up nothing will I hope you are pepped up i know i'm pepped up philippians 1 9 verse 8 philippians 1 8 for God is my record how greatly I longed after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment so see love will multiply your knowledge he's just loving God loving others love will multiply your judgment that's discernment judgment is discernment verse 10 that ye may approve things that are excellent and that he may be sincere without offence to the day of Christ so see abiding in Christ is abiding in the love of God love the word love obedience love worship love everything about God and you will abound and multiply how many how many have seen brother amens gift multiply my hand might be the highest one in here cuz I've I was here when he first started it's just multiplying how many see Malachi multiply now don't raise your hand but I hope my preaching is multiplied to if not I'm gonna cry after church I put so many hours into it I've been given my life to it praise God but see we're supposed to give ourselves to it and it should abound it should go greater as long as we got the right love in our hearts we should we should see it more effective for the glory of God hallelujah praise God now we all go through seasons right I just told you I went through about six months where I didn't see anybody healed and I was starting to doubt I had a gift anymore but then God had to bring me out of the season I thank the Lord for that so we go through seasons we go through struggles the thing to do is never give up never quit never say you're a weak Christian never say you don't have gifts never say God didn't give you anything God gave you something he gave you a great opportunity he gave you an equal opportunity and I believe church if you look carefully there's something in your hand there's something God wants you to do and it's in your hand alright last one let's end our feet 1st Thessalonians 3 let's tan hallelujah let's go to first Thessalonians 3 let's go to 11 that'll just be yeah here's what I was saying earlier about God wants to establish us God wants us to be so rock solid in the message which is the Bible God wants us to be so rock solid in the Word of God that our hearts are firmly established we're not going anywhere no matter what waves come or winds come like sister Karen you know and sister Brenda we just stay right in this think of all the years you know Beatrice and and William think of all the years just staying right in here they're established in the Word of God all of our hearts need to be like that amen that's a great testimony hallelujah that's what the love of God does it wants you to establish your heart in the truth of God hallelujah it's almost twenty years for me Church it's almost twenty years I've been this message almost I know the power the keeping power of Jesus Christ I've come to know him in the powers resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings praise God verse 11 now God himself I love that God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you Paul so badly one to minister these people may God direct our way to you and the Lord make you to increase amen and a bow that means multiply in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you we should be the most loving people on the earth praise God now we got to use wisdom too you know with people that would hurt us you know you have to use wisdom like member paul paul said with the coppersmith he said beware he told timothy you watch out for Alexander the coppersmith he did me much evil remember that so we got to use wisdom right if someone's gonna smack us or beat us up we shouldn't let him do it all the time you know if somebody runs us out of the house well don't go in that house you know use use wisdom but with everybody else show love you understand so we ought to balance this out to the verse 13 here's the end that he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God even our father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints and then he breaks into the rapture Chat for the next chapter hey man see God wants you to abound and multiply in his love one toward another and toward all men how many want to abide in the love of God the musicians why'd you come here let's sing a song about the love of God maybe by God's grace if we just abide in Christ then no matter what gifts we have no matter how long we've been serving God we can look back on our lives and say my love God look how God did this over the course of the years look at that blessing that testimony that one you can look
