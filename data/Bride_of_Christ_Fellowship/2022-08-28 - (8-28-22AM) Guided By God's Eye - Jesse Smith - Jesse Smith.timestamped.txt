[0:03] chapter 32.
[0:17] just take another service just to try to
[0:20] encourage us and raise our faith
[0:23] i'd like to look at uh guided by the eye
[0:25] of god today guided by the eye of god
[0:28] psalm 32 verse 7.
[0:33] wednesday the power went out and i
[0:36] couldn't quite all day i just couldn't
[0:37] quite get a sermon
[0:39] and it was the only sermon i ever
[0:40] preached without any notes really
[0:43] i didn't put it on
[0:45] youtube yet but if you want to do that i
[0:47] could i just kind of forgot i was
[0:49] working on other things i was working on
[0:50] naomi's podcast and my other videos you
[0:52] know
[0:53] um but if you wanted to if you would
[0:55] like if you like that motherboard let me
[0:56] know after service okay it would just
[0:58] take five minutes
[1:01] um
[1:03] but yeah i just really felt encouraged
[1:05] you know wednesday and uh i just you
[1:08] know i felt
[1:09] about yesterday i was listening to
[1:10] different servers i listened to
[1:11] leadership communion and then i've seen
[1:13] this sermon pop up from brother branham
[1:15] called god's eye
[1:17] i never listened to it before it's in
[1:18] 1958
[1:20] and it was just
[1:23] he preached for 10 minutes and then he
[1:25] prayed for the sick for an hour
[1:27] and that's where i got the inspiration
[1:29] for this thought like wow what a i never
[1:31] i've never seen that title before god's
[1:33] eye
[1:34] then i looked at the scripture and the
[1:35] scripture was this it was psalms 32. so
[1:37] i just want to preach on that thought
[1:39] just a room it's just an encouraging
[1:41] thought that god's eye's always on
[1:43] i just want you to know that church as
[1:44] we go through battles and struggles and
[1:46] losses and gains whatever we go through
[1:48] god's eyes on you amen
[1:52] psalm 32 verse
[1:54] 7.
[1:56] beautiful scripture there in verse 7 as
[1:57] well i mean verse 8 is where we want to
[1:59] get to but
[2:00] verse 7 was beautiful too if you need a
[2:02] place to hide you can hide in christ
[2:08] i'll read verse 7 then we can all read
[2:10] verse 8 together verse 7 says thou art
[2:12] my hiding place
[2:13] thou shalt preserve me from trouble
[2:17] thou shalt compass me about with songs
[2:21] of deliverance
[2:23] how many surrounded by all these songs
[2:24] of victory phrase amen songs of
[2:27] deliverance c-lock
[2:28] of course that means pause usually for
[2:30] meditation right you pause and let me
[2:33] think about that
[2:35] tells the musician this is where you
[2:36] pause you emphasize that those words
[2:38] right there
[2:40] then verse eight let's read verse eight
[2:41] together ready one two three i will
[2:44] instruct thee and teach thee in the way
[2:47] which thou shalt go
[2:49] i will guide thee with my eye amen let's
[2:52] have a word of prayer
[2:53] if you have any on your heart let's just
[2:55] make it on unto god
[2:57] we're all in need of the living god
[3:00] the almighty god i need him i know you
[3:02] do too and
[3:03] we surely need his grace during these
[3:05] seasons of loss these difficult times
[3:08] we just need god's grace
[3:09] his love
[3:10] heavenly father lord my hands are raised
[3:12] to you lord god my eyes are closed
[3:14] father i'm just praying in all sincerity
[3:16] lord we love you lord there's no one
[3:19] nowhere else we'd rather be lord than
[3:20] with your people and in your presence
[3:23] there's no one else we'd rather talk to
[3:24] than you lord god
[3:26] for lord you are our help
[3:28] it is vain it's foolish to trust in man
[3:30] lord for we're trusting in the living
[3:32] god the god who sees all the god who
[3:34] knows all as a father we're putting our
[3:36] trust in you today a fresh lord god
[3:37] thank you then you guide us with your
[3:39] eye
[3:40] lord god we know you're watching us and
[3:43] we know your eyes on the sparrow lord
[3:44] god we know the hairs of our head are
[3:46] numbered
[3:47] we know lord god you care about us we
[3:49] can't even count the number of thoughts
[3:50] you have towards us
[3:52] so father god we ask the lord in your
[3:54] mercy you bless us here in your divine
[3:55] presence speak to us here today
[3:57] and meet all the needs of the saints be
[3:59] with our sister who again lord thank you
[4:02] uh for her faithful god also sister nina
[4:04] at home
[4:05] streaming god i just pray god you speak
[4:07] to them bless them in jesus christ's
[4:10] name everybody says amen god bless you
[4:12] to being seated praise god
[4:20] so i'd like to look at this thought on
[4:22] uh
[4:23] guided by god's eye
[4:25] or again
[4:27] not really a teaching service right more
[4:28] of a preaching service and
[4:30] i've kind of been doing a few more of
[4:32] those
[4:33] preaching services lately so i hope this
[4:35] will be a
[4:36] blessing to you
[4:38] i'm going to start with the quote you
[4:39] know this this few minutes where brother
[4:41] begins his sermon on god's eye he's from
[4:44] chattanooga tennessee
[4:46] he said i love that david is speaking
[4:48] that god is his hiding place
[4:51] how i love to think that we have a
[4:52] hiding place
[4:54] that god's great presence can be our
[4:56] hiding place
[4:57] where we can hide from the things of the
[4:59] world
[5:00] when trouble arrives he's our hiding
[5:02] place
[5:04] hallelujah
[5:06] then he reads i will guide you with mine
[5:08] i
[5:10] he said i was thinking here god was
[5:12] speaking there
[5:13] how god would guide us with his eye
[5:17] and to know that his presence is ever
[5:19] near
[5:21] and he does guide us and i was thinking
[5:24] how becoming that scripture
[5:26] is to the true servant of christ
[5:29] in john 15 verse 9 jesus says verily
[5:32] verily i say unto you the son can do
[5:34] nothing in himself
[5:35] but what he sees the father doing the
[5:38] son doeth likewise
[5:40] so jesus did nothing until he saw the
[5:42] father do it first and there's a there's
[5:44] a beautiful picture there
[5:46] i'll guide you with my eye that
[5:48] beautiful
[5:49] so this this thought of god's eye
[5:51] guiding us is
[5:52] is god giving us his eyesight
[5:55] it's god giving us his perfect will
[5:59] it's god giving us the direction that we
[6:01] must go
[6:04] because jesus says i can do nothing
[6:05] except i see the father do it first
[6:08] that's right
[6:09] i can't do anything i can't i can't do
[6:11] anything unless god shows me what to do
[6:13] first so in other words i need god's
[6:15] eyes
[6:16] i need god's vision in order to know
[6:18] what to do amen beautiful thought there
[6:20] beautiful thought brother brown fix it
[6:21] up there
[6:22] he says the great eye of jehovah
[6:25] jesus was looking through his eyes
[6:28] so now we get the thought of how god
[6:30] will bring us behind the veil right it
[6:31] brings behind
[6:33] the veil and we get to look and see
[6:35] things through god's perspective amen
[6:37] that's what i love about the bible you
[6:38] know
[6:39] god gives us 66 books
[6:42] of the scripture written by uh i think
[6:44] there's 40 authors if i'm not mistaken
[6:46] brown 40 authors written over the course
[6:48] of almost 1500 years
[6:51] uh you know we got six six six thousand
[6:53] years of human history to date but it
[6:55] was all written kind of in the same
[6:56] amount of time within the with the same
[6:58] 1500 years from moses you know to john
[7:02] and
[7:03] with each with each
[7:05] book we get to see god's perspective on
[7:07] someone's life
[7:09] right we get to i love we get to see
[7:10] god's perspective on job's life
[7:14] especially with that you get to go up to
[7:15] heaven and see what's going on in heaven
[7:17] hallelujah
[7:19] you get to see uh the perspective on
[7:21] david's life
[7:22] which is one of the largest
[7:24] compilations of a person's life in the
[7:26] bible
[7:27] just all those chapters just full of all
[7:30] these details of a man's life
[7:33] and i love it you get god's perspective
[7:35] on the life of christ
[7:38] hallelujah
[7:40] and you get god's perspective on all the
[7:42] abraham you get this huge chunk on
[7:44] abraham this huge chunk on joseph's life
[7:47] and i think god does it because it's is
[7:49] this he's giving us the opportunity to
[7:51] step behind his and
[7:53] and come into his mind i'll say it like
[7:55] that amen god gives us an opportunity to
[7:58] bring us into the mind of christ
[8:00] and we get to see someone else's uh life
[8:03] through god's eye
[8:04] through god's eyesight
[8:06] and it's a beautiful picture he says the
[8:08] great eye of jehovah
[8:12] jesus was looking through his eyes it
[8:14] must have been jehovah's eyes he was
[8:16] looking through
[8:18] when simon or peter come up and he told
[8:20] him his name was simon and he was going
[8:22] to change it to cephas or
[8:24] peter and he told him his father's name
[8:27] was jonah
[8:28] it just had to be god's eye that he was
[8:30] looking through so think about that
[8:31] before jesus talks
[8:32] you know
[8:34] to peter it's as if
[8:37] it's as if god put jesus behind his eyes
[8:40] and so jesus could see peter through
[8:42] god's eyes
[8:44] amen
[8:45] praise god
[8:46] so i'll just say like this when brother
[8:48] amen came to our service as if it's as
[8:50] if god uh
[8:52] god let me see him through his eyes and
[8:54] i preach exactly what brother amen
[8:55] needed to hear
[8:57] amen praise god in other words any time
[8:59] you were led by the holy spirit you were
[9:01] looking through god's eyes amen amen
[9:04] why did you choose to do this in a
[9:05] certain situation why did that why did i
[9:08] preach that why we're not a denomination
[9:10] why is god against organized religion
[9:11] why did i preach that i was looking
[9:13] through god's eyes and i didn't even
[9:14] realize it
[9:16] didn't even realize it amen
[9:19] any time god led you because remember
[9:20] they that are led by the holy spirit are
[9:22] the sons and daughters of god amen
[9:25] so anytime god leads you to do something
[9:27] maybe stranger maybe maybe you
[9:29] absolutely know this is god leading me
[9:31] to do this you might do that or you
[9:32] might not know
[9:34] many times as preachers we don't i don't
[9:35] know many times the needs i'm addressing
[9:38] i don't know it uh but i guess i guess
[9:41] when i woke up in the morning brother
[9:42] william you know on the certain days
[9:43] when god would use me like that i was
[9:44] looking through his eyes and not mine
[9:47] i would see these scriptures in a way
[9:48] i've never seen them before but i was
[9:50] looking through god's eyes
[9:52] when god led banging to fly over there
[9:54] to get sister sia right that was he's
[9:55] looking through god's eyes now to a
[9:57] natural man that's a huge it's a huge
[9:58] sacrifice
[10:00] flying cross across the oceans you know
[10:01] and
[10:02] trying to get a little bride you know
[10:04] all the way fly all the way there make
[10:06] all these sacrifices go through all
[10:07] these huge steps you know
[10:10] it's as if god brought you into his mind
[10:12] and you see the outcome you see what's
[10:14] going to happen but you see it through
[10:16] god's eyes that's right and you don't
[10:18] see it the way other people other people
[10:19] tell you do this or no don't do that now
[10:22] you shouldn't do that but for some
[10:23] reason you just see it the way god sees
[10:26] it praise god amen
[10:27] hallelujah he brought you back and
[10:30] into his mind and and he let you look
[10:32] with a with an eternal vision amen he
[10:35] let you look with an eternal perspective
[10:38] that's what hattie wright got amen i
[10:40] think when brother adam said just say
[10:42] whatever you want say what's your
[10:43] greatest desire she looked through god's
[10:45] eyes and saw you know farming on a hill
[10:47] for 20 a year that's awful but that's
[10:49] not the most important thing the most
[10:51] important thing is the salvation of
[10:52] those two souls
[10:55] so when she was given the opportunity to
[10:57] speak anything she wanted when she
[10:59] speaks she spoke the most valuable thing
[11:01] that because god saw the most valuable
[11:03] thing is souls that are saved rescued
[11:05] from hell and given eternal life amen
[11:08] amen glory
[11:10] so she got to step behind the mind of
[11:12] god and look through god's eyes and see
[11:14] what's most important money or souls
[11:17] souls praise god amen what a beautiful
[11:19] dog
[11:21] but ram said god's eye has been with the
[11:24] prophets through the ages
[11:26] that could see ahead of time what was
[11:28] going to happen like brother told us
[11:29] about russia right and the uh bomb on
[11:32] the vatican we know what's going to
[11:33] happen
[11:35] we know some of the nations that are
[11:36] going to do it praise god
[11:38] we know the mark of the beast is going
[11:39] to come out of the united states
[11:41] a lot of people don't understand that
[11:42] they think the u.s will be the savior of
[11:44] the world or
[11:45] uh the u.s will rescue it's actually
[11:48] gonna be the opposite the u.s is gonna
[11:49] bring the it's the beast out of the land
[11:51] it's gonna bring everybody down
[11:54] but god has shown us through the eyes of
[11:56] the prophets
[11:58] he said it could have been nothing else
[11:59] but god's eye when nathanael was brought
[12:01] by philip into his presence and jesus
[12:03] said behold an israelite in whom there's
[12:06] no guile amen
[12:07] and he said how do you know me rabbi he
[12:09] said when you were under the fig tree i
[12:11] saw you praise god
[12:13] there it is again jesus saw use the
[12:16] god's eyes the eyesight of god
[12:19] to see where he was
[12:21] he said it must have been god's eye that
[12:23] he was looking through oh my god help us
[12:25] to look through his eyes today praise
[12:27] god
[12:28] amen let's look through god's eyes let's
[12:29] look through god's perspective about
[12:31] situations today
[12:33] each one of us
[12:37] he said it must have been god's eye in
[12:39] john 4 when he seen the woman had five
[12:42] husbands
[12:43] but see jesus didn't see that jesus saw
[12:45] a redeemed woman who would later run
[12:47] into the city praise god amen
[12:50] he didn't see just the woman carrying
[12:51] the water pot at the
[12:53] hot time of the day when the prostitutes
[12:55] came out jesus looked past that praise
[12:57] god amen he saw he didn't see the
[12:59] blackness of her soul he saw the part of
[13:01] her soul that god's light would shine
[13:03] upon the part that would receive faith
[13:05] for by grace she was saved through faith
[13:09] amen jesus didn't see the part that had
[13:11] you know the sixth husband there living
[13:13] there and she's living in shame jesus
[13:15] didn't see that jesus said saw the woman
[13:17] that would move out praise god amen and
[13:19] live a separated life and go and sin no
[13:22] more amen amen
[13:24] he must have seen that praise god
[13:28] it was god's eye
[13:29] when he was looking down through
[13:31] he says and when the woman touches
[13:33] garment and virtue had gone from him
[13:37] and then he looked over the audience
[13:38] until he found the woman and knew what
[13:40] her trouble was so he was looking
[13:41] through god's eyes i said like that she
[13:43] was looking through god's eyes
[13:45] the bible said she said i know if i can
[13:48] just touch the heaven of his garment
[13:50] i'll be made whole praise god amen that
[13:52] was god's eyes amen amen
[13:54] no other you know a human thought
[13:55] wouldn't do that or if i could just
[13:57] touch if i can just touch him if i can
[13:59] just touch i know i'll be made well that
[14:00] was god's thinking that was god's way
[14:03] that she was going to be healed she was
[14:04] led to do that praise god
[14:06] amen may god lead us to our healing may
[14:09] god lead us to see our loved ones save
[14:11] amen god lead us for our children to be
[14:14] born again praise god
[14:16] how did it make god lead us into these
[14:18] desires may we see god's eyes through it
[14:20] praise god let's see what god wants to
[14:22] happen praise god amen amen
[14:24] that's what led jesus
[14:26] in all these situations we find the
[14:28] scripture
[14:30] but ram said it could not it been
[14:33] nothing else but through god's eye when
[14:35] jesus perceived the thoughts in the
[14:37] pharisees heart when they said here be
[14:39] else above so even then he was looking
[14:41] through the eyes of god
[14:44] it was god's eye that was looking
[14:45] through him when he perceived the
[14:47] thoughts of the disciples when they were
[14:48] saying who would be the greatest among
[14:50] them now is that something
[14:52] so church when we you know as we preach
[14:55] all that we've looked at the eyes of uh
[14:58] so he looked at the preachers that i'm
[14:59] calling themselves the greatest of all
[15:00] time on the tape side and on the
[15:02] five-fold side they're both sides saying
[15:04] they're the greatest of all time
[15:06] and uh
[15:07] i got more to say on that later maybe
[15:09] i'll say it at the end i don't want to
[15:10] be on the live stream but i appreciate i
[15:12] appreciate the different emails i've got
[15:13] on that
[15:15] but see it was jesus perceiving jesus
[15:18] was looking through god's eyes and their
[15:20] argues greater and he goes up and gets a
[15:22] child and sets it in the midst of them
[15:24] and says you got to become like this
[15:25] child if you want to be great
[15:28] grown men strong men men with miracles a
[15:31] man that walked on water you know all
[15:32] these these great men and jesus says no
[15:35] you shouldn't do that you shouldn't
[15:37] exalt yourselves you should humble
[15:38] yourselves that's what god's eyes do
[15:40] when you look through god's eyes you see
[15:42] how little you are amen
[15:44] but that's what that's what that's
[15:46] actually the battle the message is
[15:48] facing today we're the greatest of all
[15:49] time
[15:52] so sad
[15:56] it was god's eye that jesus was looking
[15:58] through when he went down into the pool
[16:00] bethesda and looked around to find a man
[16:02] on a pallet and knew he'd been in that
[16:05] condition for 38 years
[16:08] old he offered him healing praise 38
[16:10] years think about that
[16:13] hey now look at that abraham waited 25
[16:15] years but here's a seat of abraham who
[16:17] waited 38 years amen
[16:19] hallelujah
[16:21] so let's be encouraged praise god let's
[16:22] keep waving let's keep believing let's
[16:24] look through god's eyes and not our
[16:26] human eyes amen amen
[16:31] he said
[16:35] okay now he gets on some other things he
[16:36] says and that guiding eye wasn't to be
[16:39] gone at the going of the lord jesus he
[16:41] was to continue forever in his church
[16:44] and when he rose on the third day and
[16:45] sent it on high he sent the holy spirit
[16:48] back to the church and tonight the
[16:50] church looks through the same guiding
[16:52] eye that guides his people
[16:55] into all truth because he is the truth
[16:58] amen oh don't you love that
[17:00] get your bible let's go to john 16 13
[17:03] here i'll just read that because that's
[17:05] one of the main scriptures brother i use
[17:09] [Music]
[17:11] actually let's look at verse 12 now this
[17:12] is a great uh scripture to keep us
[17:14] humble as well
[17:19] this is how we know the rapture will
[17:20] come at the right time in season it
[17:22] won't be one minute late
[17:25] and the rapture uh is not going to be
[17:27] early it's not going to be late we

[20:13] scripture praise god
[20:15] the best is yet to come
[20:17] jesus said lo i'm with you always even
[20:19] to the end of the world and we're
[20:21] nearing the end as jesus confirmed that
[20:23] guiding eye being with him in the days
[20:26] when he revealed himself to the jews
[20:28] before the ending of that church age for
[20:30] the jews
[20:31] he manifested it by looking through the
[20:33] eye of god so jesus manifested god by
[20:36] looking through god's eye
[20:38] and that's how we'll manifest christ to
[20:40] the world by looking through god's eye
[20:43] through our lives
[20:45] right
[20:46] trusting god looking at looking through
[20:48] god's eye what is god's word in other
[20:49] words it's like looking through god's
[20:51] glasses right these are like god's
[20:53] glasses
[20:54] you put these on and you look at your
[20:56] life you look at every situation through
[20:58] god's perspective on it
[21:01] and then you look with god's eyes
[21:03] how do you believe that by god's grace
[21:04] amen amen amen
[21:08] brother said at calvary everything was
[21:10] finished he was wounded for our
[21:12] transgressions with his strikes we were
[21:13] healed every sinner tonight here was
[21:15] saved when jesus died at calvary every
[21:18] sick person was healed when jesus died
[21:19] at calvary he finished the work the only
[21:22] thing that god can do now is anoint
[21:24] ministers to preach the word
[21:26] and set gifts in the church to point you
[21:29] to the finished work of the lord jesus
[21:31] may god grant it tonight is my prayer
[21:33] brother and i said
[21:35] that's basically this whole sermon on
[21:37] god's eye right there
[21:39] beautiful beautiful uh topic there now
[21:41] let's go back to psalm 32 that's where i
[21:43] want to start i want to see i want you
[21:45] to see the inspiration
[21:47] where i kind of got this from
[21:50] let's go to verse 1 here
[21:52] 32 1. i want to read the whole chapter
[21:54] it's a very short chapter only 11
[21:56] verses when i get a chapter like that my
[21:59] morning reading i'll read two chapters
[22:00] because that's so short you know
[22:02] i think this morning's chapter is about
[22:03] 60 some verses
[22:06] i'm in the book of lamentations now um
[22:10] that's quite a book there and my chapter
[22:12] this morning was uh the chapter i think
[22:14] it's chapter three lamentations where
[22:16] the bible said god's mercies are renewed
[22:18] every morning amen real encouragement to
[22:20] me
[22:22] you know remember in lamentations that
[22:24] was jeremiah he was lamenting over
[22:27] israel because their city was being
[22:28] destroyed uh the belief the jews i'm not
[22:32] sure if i should say believers many of
[22:33] them were not
[22:35] the jews were being scattered around the
[22:37] world
[22:38] and god said it's because of your
[22:40] rebellion
[22:42] and god was chasing them because they
[22:44] forgot the priest and forgotten god the
[22:46] prophets had prophesied falsely
[22:49] and yet in the midst of all that
[22:50] jeremiah knew god is going to bring them
[22:52] back eventually praise god amen
[22:55] and he said yet despite all our
[22:57] rebellion and our idolatry despite all
[23:00] these things god's mercies are renewed
[23:02] every single morning amen amen
[23:05] in other words god was looking for
[23:06] someone to repent every single day in
[23:07] other words
[23:09] right we'll read that after this let's
[23:10] read psalms 32.
[23:12] a psalm of david
[23:14] mage chill and i don't know if i'm
[23:16] saying that right mass chill i don't
[23:18] know
[23:18] but that word means to instruct so so
[23:22] david is saying this is a song to
[23:24] instruct us
[23:26] in other words god wants us to do this
[23:28] chapter that's right
[23:31] praise god
[23:34] here's a song and it teaches you how to
[23:36] do something let's look at it praise god
[23:38] because it's a beautiful beautiful
[23:39] chapter
[23:41] blessed is he who's trans
[23:42] transgression sorry it's forgiven whose
[23:45] sin is covered
[23:46] how many can say amen to that amen i
[23:48] thought i'd hear a few more amens on
[23:49] that one let's try it again
[23:51] blessed is huge transgression is
[23:52] forgiven whose sin is covered
[23:55] all right thank you that made me feel
[23:56] good praise god
[23:58] blessed is the man unto whom the lord
[24:00] imputed thy iniquity and in whose spirit
[24:03] there is no guile
[24:05] we could say amen to all these verses
[24:06] you really don't have the same hand
[24:07] album but i don't want you to see that
[24:09] we're forgiven church amen amen when we
[24:11] trust in jesus christ if you repent and
[24:14] are baptized you shall receive the gift
[24:16] of the holy ghost
[24:17] that is god's unfailing promise look
[24:20] through god's eyes today see that
[24:22] promise through god's eyes and it will
[24:24] come to pass hallelujah amen
[24:27] amen
[24:28] when i kept silence my bones waxed old
[24:31] through my roaring all day long
[24:35] for day and night my hand was heavy upon
[24:37] me my moisture is turned into the
[24:39] drought of summer so i used to feel all
[24:41] all moistury i used to have all this
[24:43] life but now i feel dried up
[24:47] now isn't this the same man that said in
[24:48] chapter 23 my cup's running over
[24:51] hallelujah sometimes you come to church
[24:53] i feel like oh i got so much love i've
[24:55] got joy like a fountain praise god it's
[24:58] overflowing and then sometimes i feel
[25:00] like i've all dried up
[25:02] i have nothing to give god i could
[25:04] hardly sing a song to god today
[25:07] don't feel bad at church david went
[25:08] through that too and if david could be a
[25:10] man after god's own heart so can you
[25:12] amend you're dry sometimes you're
[25:15] overflowing by the praises just flowing
[25:17] it's a joy and everything is feels like
[25:19] it's it's going well and god's blessing
[25:22] every single thing you do so it seems
[25:24] right but then there's times god takes
[25:25] you through dry season seasoning
[25:32] and this is to what this is to instruct
[25:34] us
[25:36] in other words we're to learn from this
[25:38] chapter how to behave
[25:44] verse oh then there's selah so pause
[25:46] take a pause
[25:48] we kind of did actually
[25:49] pause
[25:50] now look at this here now here's the
[25:52] instruction i acknowledge my sin unto
[25:54] thee so always tell god your sin amen
[25:56] and my iniquity have i not hid
[26:00] i love this you don't hide your sin but
[26:02] then when troubles come you can hide in
[26:04] christ
[26:05] we get this idea of hiding you know we
[26:06] don't we don't want to hide anything
[26:07] from god but we want to hide in god
[26:11] hallelujah we want a hiding place in god
[26:14] in the presence of god
[26:18] and i said i will confess my
[26:19] transgressions unto the lord and thou
[26:21] forgave us the iniquity of my sin say
[26:23] lost there's another meditation just
[26:24] stop there meditate
[26:26] pause
[26:29] see if you confess i love that god is
[26:30] faithful to cleanse you from all
[26:32] righteousness
[26:33] amen that good question was last sunday
[26:35] night you know did god forgive all every
[26:37] single one god forgave every single one
[26:39] amen
[26:40] when you repent you get baptized that's
[26:42] saying forgive me of all my sins even if
[26:45] i forgot to confess it no doubt you no
[26:47] doubt when you accepted jesus you wanted
[26:49] forgiven from every sin anyway praise
[26:50] god amen that's the understanding he's
[26:53] not going to forgive you of 99 percent
[26:55] of your sins amen he's going to forgive
[26:57] you of 100 of them
[26:58] amen that's the whole idea of praise god
[27:01] that's why you can be saved that's why
[27:03] he said repent and be saved hallelujah
[27:06] he that believeth uh i'm sorry he that
[27:08] repented uh believe us shall be baptized
[27:11] praise god he that believeth not shall
[27:12] be damned that's the whole point of
[27:14] being saved is you're forgiven of all
[27:16] your iniquities praise god
[27:18] he forgiveth all thy iniquities healeth
[27:20] all thy diseases praise god amen
[27:23] [Music]
[27:26] verse six for this shall every one that
[27:28] is godly pray unto thee in the time when
[27:30] thou mayest be found
[27:32] surely in the floods of great waters
[27:34] they shall not come nigh
[27:36] unto him amen so we'll see where the
[27:38] enemy comes in like a flood i just
[27:39] thought it tied together perfectly
[27:41] when the enemy comes in like a flood it
[27:43] will only come so far
[27:45] amen hallelujah
[27:47] it will not overthrow you you will not
[27:49] drown in the flood hallelujah amen this
[27:53] will not be the end of you the flood's
[27:55] going to come in but god is going to
[27:57] raise up a standard against the flood
[27:59] amen amen in other words literally god
[28:02] is going to give me a rallying point
[28:03] here god's going to place me on a higher
[28:06] place i won't be a part of the flood i
[28:08] won't sink i won't drown he'll give me a
[28:10] higher place he'll raise me up higher
[28:12] that'll lift me up he'll protect me i'll
[28:14] rally with his spirit praise god amen
[28:17] yes it's gonna flood but yes he has a
[28:20] higher place for you and i praise god
[28:22] amen
[28:23] higher than amen a higher elevation
[28:25] praise god
[28:27] we don't have to sink in the flood
[28:29] praise god we don't have to drown we
[28:31] don't want to be lost we can be saved
[28:33] praise god he has a higher place run to
[28:35] the higher place amen reminds me of the
[28:38] hill the lord who shall ascend to the
[28:40] hill o lord those who've done
[28:42] righteously those who've kept my word
[28:44] those who trust in god
[28:47] that's what that reminds me of
[28:48] amen
[28:56] floods are going to come we just got to
[28:58] get used to that now thank god we live
[28:59] in a place where there's not many floods
[29:00] ohio doesn't have any floods
[29:03] i think there are some states actually
[29:05] going through some flooding right now
[29:07] i can't think of the state but uh
[29:09] there's been numerous floods over this
[29:10] summer i know colorado had some floods
[29:11] this summer
[29:13] unexpected
[29:15] houses getting carried down the street
[29:17] you know cars getting carried down into
[29:19] the flood
[29:20] awful
[29:22] but the bible says he's the enemy's
[29:24] going to come like a flood but god is
[29:26] going to provide us a hiding place
[29:29] so verse seven where's our hiding place
[29:32] everybody say thou ready
[29:34] david says thou
[29:35] art my hiding place
[29:37] when thou shalt preserve me i'm sorry
[29:40] thou shalt preserve me from trouble you
[29:42] will praise god
[29:44] when everything's surrounding me when uh
[29:46] the obstacle or the trial looks
[29:48] insurmountable like a flood i've got a
[29:50] place i can run to i've got a hiding
[29:53] place he will preserve my life praise
[29:55] god he's got he's already got a place
[29:57] he's already provided a place for me
[29:59] amen
[30:02] right
[30:03] like you know you've got you've got your
[30:04] safety plan in place you know you know
[30:06] what to do if there's a tornado you know
[30:08] what to do there's a uh something
[30:10] something awful right you've got a
[30:11] safety plan well god's got a better
[30:13] safety plan for you
[30:15] you hide in his spirit praise god you
[30:17] hide in his presence hallelujah he'll
[30:20] preserve your life he will protect your
[30:22] life amen
[30:24] [Music]
[30:25] thou shalt compass me about with songs
[30:27] of deliverance so god in other words god
[30:29] knows the floods are coming but he's got
[30:31] a place for you to hide and then he's
[30:33] got songs he's going to give you songs
[30:34] that saying as a testimony that he
[30:36] protected you praise god
[30:38] amen hallelujah
[30:40] praise god
[30:44] i love it
[30:45] and this whole time what is it it's
[30:46] building your faith
[30:48] it's bringing you to maturity in christ
[30:51] jesus amen
[30:54] you're never going to get rid of the
[30:55] floods you just got to understand well
[30:57] i've got a place to go when the floods
[30:58] come
[31:00] i've got a hiding place i can get away
[31:02] from the flood praise god i don't i
[31:04] don't have to let the flood discourage
[31:06] me i don't want to have to overwhelm me
[31:07] i've got a place i can go to that's
[31:09] right amen and then he's going to give
[31:11] me songs to sing about praise god
[31:15] songs of deliverance because remember
[31:17] church that's what that's what paul said
[31:19] in ephesians chapter five he said do not
[31:22] be drunk online which leads to excess he
[31:24] said but instead be filled with the
[31:25] spirit amen
[31:26] and then what does he say right after
[31:28] that
[31:28] singing songs singing hymns
[31:31] making a melody in your heart for the
[31:33] lord so the fact that a believer can
[31:35] sing when there's floods around the fact
[31:37] that the believer can rejoice and sing
[31:39] about being delivered the fact you can
[31:42] sing shows god's spirit is flowing upon
[31:44] you praise god all right the fact you
[31:46] can sing songs of deliverance shows the
[31:48] anointing is on you praise god amen
[31:51] it shows you are in the hiding place
[31:52] amen
[31:54] you wouldn't sing those songs if you
[31:55] weren't in the hiding place but the fact
[31:57] you're singing those songs of
[31:58] deliverance shows you're trusting in the
[32:00] hiding place you've gone where god told
[32:02] you to go praise god
[32:05] amen
[32:08] god help me god help all of us
[32:10] i'm not preaching at you i'm preaching
[32:12] with you
[32:13] i need this servant too praise god
[32:15] i don't look through god's eyes on
[32:17] things
[32:18] and not my perspective
[32:24] so think on that one look at this wow
[32:26] that's like the
[32:28] third say la already in the chapter
[32:30] verse eight's where our the main text
[32:32] this for this thought was guided by
[32:34] god's eye
[32:36] i will instruct this remember
[32:38] this is the whole point of this chapter
[32:39] is to instruct us
[32:41] so in other words don't hide your sin
[32:43] from god
[32:44] right
[32:45] always confess all your sin and then
[32:47] when trouble comes in you go hide in god
[32:49] that's right amen so don't hide anything
[32:51] from god and then when troubles come
[32:53] hide in god
[32:56] i will instruct thee and teach thee in
[32:58] the way which thou shalt go
[33:00] okay so we all want to walk on the right
[33:02] path we all want to walk on the narrow
[33:03] road god said i'm going to teach you how
[33:06] to walk on that road
[33:08] i'm going to show you which is the right
[33:10] way in your life
[33:12] praise god
[33:14] this is a song for the redeemed praise
[33:17] god amen i imagine you know i imagine
[33:20] when we're hiding in christ that's what
[33:21] i'll tell us you need to go this way
[33:24] imagine when we're hiding in there with
[33:25] that communion with christ that's what
[33:26] it'll tell us you need to go this way
[33:28] see
[33:29] it's right in the midst of trials many
[33:30] times that's where god will show us the
[33:32] next step for our lives
[33:34] in the midst of those trials in the
[33:35] midst of the flood
[33:37] well i know i can't do this way it seems
[33:38] like the lord is leading me this way
[33:41] because i'm in the midst of the trial
[33:42] i'm hiding in him amen
[33:44] and while i'm hiding with him he's
[33:46] giving me instruction glory in that in
[33:49] that sweet communion with god he's
[33:51] guiding me showing me this is the way i
[33:52] need to walk
[33:53] [Music]
[33:55] because there's going to be more floods
[33:56] coming
[33:58] praise god the floods are going to keep
[33:59] coming brother women have the floods
[34:00] ever stopped when you hit 50 the the the
[34:03] trial stop coming no okay

[34:11] assistant is too
[34:12] we all go through these trials where
[34:14] floods come in floods blood flood we
[34:17] have a choice we can try to take on the
[34:18] flood ourselves now how good are we
[34:20] going to do on that right
[34:22] right with all your sandbags
[34:25] how much fun are you going to stop with
[34:26] your sandbag wall
[34:28] but god said don't try to do that just
[34:30] run the righteous run into the tower the
[34:33] name of god is a mighty tower run into
[34:35] it be safe amen amen
[34:38] hide in christ
[34:44] i will instruct thee and teach you the
[34:45] way which thou shalt go i will guide you
[34:47] with mine i
[34:49] let's finish the chapter then i want to
[34:50] just switch over there to
[34:52] lamentations real quick verse 9 be not
[34:55] as the horse where's the mule so you see
[34:56] he brings out these animals
[34:58] right that need to betray now if anyone
[35:00] knows about horses i could call on some
[35:02] people not here to help me out
[35:04] i got some
[35:05] my kids work with horses
[35:07] be not as the horse or as the mule which
[35:09] have no understanding so there's a
[35:11] certain part about a horse that doesn't
[35:13] it's very emotional right but it doesn't
[35:15] have the same human understanding
[35:17] right because they'll nip you they'll
[35:18] bite you right
[35:20] he says whose mouse must be held in with
[35:23] bit and bridle lest they come near unto
[35:26] thee
[35:27] so you've got to control them right you
[35:29] got to control them the bible says our
[35:30] mouths need a bridle too actually
[35:33] james chapter 2 amen
[35:35] right
[35:39] but here let's learn from the mule and
[35:41] the horse
[35:42] they need a bridle in their mouth or
[35:45] else they're coming they're going to
[35:46] bite you they're going to do something
[35:47] to you they're going to hurt you
[35:50] verse 10 many sorrows shall be to the
[35:52] wicked but he that trusts in the lord
[35:54] mercy shall compass him about
[35:57] so look you're going to become us about
[35:58] with songs and you're going to encompass
[36:00] them out with mercy praise god
[36:03] so you've got psalms all around songs of
[36:05] deliverance and you've got god's mercy
[36:07] all around you praise god amen amen so
[36:10] see now the bible doesn't say no the
[36:12] flood came in
[36:13] right the flood came in no doubt that
[36:15] surrounds you but really you're looking
[36:17] at what's spiritually surrounding you
[36:18] amen may god help us to see what's
[36:21] spiritually surrounding us not the
[36:22] natural the natural will be there but
[36:25] god when you hide in god i want you to
[36:27] focus on what is spiritually surrounding
[36:29] me
[36:31] it may feel like i'm surrounded but i'm
[36:32] surrounded by christ amen
[36:34] it may be like i'm surrounded by floods
[36:36] but i'm surrounded by songs of mercy
[36:38] praise god amen
[36:40] amen so we see we have to look and see
[36:42] what's what's surrounding us spiritually
[36:46] we can't let frustration we can't let
[36:48] fear
[36:49] uh
[36:50] grieve we can't let any of these things
[36:52] surround us we've got to be surrounded
[36:54] with songs of deliverance that's right
[36:56] that's right with god's mercy
[37:01] verse 11 be
[37:02] glad in the lord and rejoice ye
[37:04] righteous
[37:05] and shout for joy all that are upright
[37:08] in heart
[37:10] so you've got songs of deliverance
[37:12] you're surrounded by mercy and church
[37:14] we've got to have a shot of joy praise
[37:16] god
[37:17] see that
[37:18] shout for joy
[37:20] be glad in the lord be thankful you've
[37:22] got a hiding place amen amen i know some
[37:25] shots are gonna be louder than others
[37:26] right
[37:27] many times it's easier to shout than
[37:28] other times
[37:30] but this is to instruct us is it not
[37:33] this is to show us i will guide you in
[37:35] the way
[37:36] i'm your hiding place run to me
[37:39] i'll surround you with mercy i'll
[37:41] surround you with songs praise god
[37:43] amen i'll give you a shout of joy praise
[37:46] god
[37:48] be glad in the lord be glad you have a a
[37:50] hiding place uh be glad you have
[37:53] communion with me be glad that i'll show
[37:55] you the way to go
[37:57] amen
[37:58] let's go to lamentations after jeremiah
[38:00] lamentation
[38:11] i'm sorry it's lamentations
[38:14] uh yeah you're my limitation sorry
[38:25] chapter three lamentation chapter three
[38:28] now look at verse one and two i am the
[38:30] man that has set affliction by the rod
[38:32] of his wrath
[38:34] now look he had led me and brought me
[38:36] into darkness but not into light now
[38:39] jeremiah is talking about the natural
[38:40] things that he sees
[38:42] israel being taken into captivity
[38:44] right the kings disobeying god's word
[38:47] now look he said god led me here
[38:50] isn't this something
[38:52] because the majority of jews were
[38:54] disobedient jeremiah was not jeremiah
[38:56] was faithful but because god deals with
[38:58] israel as nation
[39:01] he's led with them look lead
[39:03] right lend
[39:05] in other words god's eyes saw beforehand
[39:08] that jeremiah was going to have to go
[39:09] through this with the people because
[39:11] they were disobedient and god even
[39:13] raised up jeremiah from his mother's
[39:15] womb to be a prophet amen
[39:18] and to speak to them praise god and to
[39:20] not fear their faces don't look at their
[39:22] faces just preach the word amen
[39:27] so jeremiah has led with a lot of
[39:29] unbelievers
[39:31] jews
[39:32] into an awful situation
[39:35] and there's five chapters of lamentation
[39:37] but every now and then you see a glimmer
[39:39] of hope
[39:40] we're going to go through difficult
[39:41] times there's floods that are going to
[39:43] come through
[39:45] right we just seen it but we have a
[39:47] choice
[39:48] we can either try to get through
[39:49] ourselves or we can run to christ and
[39:51] hide in jesus amen amen
[39:53] look at verse 21.
[39:58] actually um
[40:02] look at verse 18 let's go to 18. and i
[40:04] said my strength and my hope is perish
[40:06] from the lord so look he felt like he
[40:07] had no more hope in
[40:09] church that's how we all feel we're all
[40:11] human and the church said
[40:12] we all feel like that there's certain
[40:13] situations ah it's hopeless we all feel
[40:16] like that jeremiah was no different
[40:19] verse 19 remembering my affliction and
[40:22] my misery the wormwood and the god now
[40:24] look at that fortunate miseries he's
[40:26] miserable
[40:28] and yet this is the same man that said
[40:29] fire shut up in my bones right in a
[40:32] prison
[40:33] he said i'm done preaching for jesus
[40:35] or i'm done preaching for christ the
[40:36] anointing right i'm done preaching for
[40:38] jehovah but then he said something rose
[40:40] up a fire in his bones and said i cannot
[40:42] stop it's like fire my bones peter the
[40:45] price of god is in my life i've got a
[40:47] calling i've got to fulfill god's will
[40:49] praise god amen but then there was times
[40:51] when he felt like quitting
[40:55] there were times he felt miserable
[40:58] as a believer verse 20 my soul hath then
[41:01] still in remembrance and is humbled in
[41:04] me so i still remember the miserable
[41:06] times i still remember the afflictions
[41:09] look at verse 21
[41:10] this i recall to mind therefore have i
[41:13] hope amen amen see church we can
[41:15] remember the hard times but we also the
[41:17] holy spirit will help us remember the
[41:19] good times because that's looking
[41:20] through god's eyes amen
[41:23] looking through our eyes we'll see
[41:25] affliction miserable wormwood all these
[41:28] difficult feelings that we go through
[41:29] the struggles of it but then i'll also
[41:32] remember i can look through god's eyes
[41:34] and see his mercy hallelujah amen amen
[41:38] verse 22 is what i'm going to recall to
[41:40] mind your mindset i'm going to remember
[41:41] this
[41:43] it is of the lord's mercies
[41:45] that were not consumed because his
[41:47] compassions failed now
[41:50] glory
[41:51] israel deserves every spanking they got
[41:53] let me give you a clue so you and i
[41:56] so do i deserve every spanking i get
[41:59] right
[42:03] like that first i shared with brother
[42:04] amen last week it was uh or two weeks
[42:07] ago
[42:07] if you go to proverbs we're not gonna go
[42:09] there now but god says there are six
[42:10] things i hate seven things are
[42:11] abomination one of them is a pro a
[42:13] prideful look
[42:15] at church let's be honest we've all
[42:17] looked sometimes at christian groups and
[42:19] thought well they're so dirty look how
[42:21] thank god i'm not them right
[42:24] that's an abomination in the bible the
[42:26] bible says a proud look is an
[42:28] abomination
[42:30] and we knew better
[42:32] we just forgotten where god brought us
[42:34] from
[42:35] christ
[42:36] we forgot the my replay god hadn't
[42:38] pulled us out of it
[42:39] right
[42:41] that's an abomination to have a proud
[42:43] look
[42:45] well i'm better i'm not in their
[42:47] situation because i'm just wise
[42:50] i just got more of the holy ghost now
[42:51] that might be true you might you might
[42:53] have more of the holy ghost but let's
[42:54] not take a pride attitude about it
[42:56] praise god
[43:00] that'll bring a flood on your life
[43:04] see so jeremiah is looking at the
[43:05] positive now lord
[43:07] you know he he thought about oh god led
[43:09] me to dark times and i remember my
[43:12] misery i mean all i can think of is this
[43:13] wormwood but i also remember the reason
[43:15] i'm alive is because god has had mercy
[43:18] on me amen amen
[43:20] right it's the lord's mercies that were
[43:22] not dead
[43:25] hallelujah
[43:26] because his compassions failed out amen
[43:29] oh god is a compassionate loving god
[43:31] amen amen we just get confused sometimes
[43:34] with human compassion and divine
[43:35] compassion right
[43:37] we all get confused with that
[43:39] but the same god who gives is the same
[43:41] god who takes away that's right
[43:43] right
[43:44] the same god who uh gives sunlight is
[43:46] the same guy who gets darkness
[43:49] praise god the same god
[43:52] we've got to be thankful gotta look
[43:53] through god's eyes
[43:56] there's times there's seasons but his
[43:58] compassions have never failed us one
[44:00] time
[44:03] show me once when his compassions fail
[44:07] something bad happened but wasn't
[44:09] somebody good to you afterwards
[44:11] right something bad happened but
[44:14] wasn't there some silver lining on it as
[44:15] we saw on wednesday night
[44:16] there's some silver lighting
[44:19] always there's always the fact that
[44:21] god's compassions fail not
[44:24] god is always doing something with this
[44:26] amen
[44:29] verse 23 they are new every morning
[44:33] great is my favorite that's it that's
[44:34] where we get that song crazy
[44:37] hallelujah
[44:39] every morning
[44:40] because we're not consumed god has had
[44:42] compassion on us
[44:44] verse 24 the lord is my portion saith my
[44:46] soul therefore i will hope in him amen
[44:49] see the jews were seeing all their lands
[44:51] taken away by captivity right they're
[44:54] taking all these the
[44:55] uh babylon was taking over assyria
[44:57] taking over
[44:59] but jeremiah saw everybody lose another
[45:01] land but jeremiah said that's fine god
[45:03] is my portion amen amen hallelujah and
[45:06] church that's your portion of day too
[45:07] amen
[45:09] heaven the holy spirit oh yes
[45:12] therefore that gives me some hope amen
[45:14] if i lose everything done here as long
[45:16] as i get a portion of jesus i'll be
[45:19] happy with that praise god
[45:21] he's my fortune amen
[45:27] verse 25 the lord is good unto them that
[45:30] wait for him
[45:31] to the soul that seeketh him
[45:34] so waiting and seeking some of the
[45:36] hardest things to do as christians and
[45:37] the church said amen
[45:39] waiting right waiting and then seeking
[45:42] spending extra time seeking god
[45:46] right
[45:47] but god
[45:48] is with you god is good to you when you
[45:51] do that
[45:52] in other words you'll you'll reap the
[45:54] benefits that's good planting right
[45:56] you've sown so you'll harvest good
[45:57] things
[45:58] the lord is good to them that way to the
[46:00] soul that seek him it is good that a man
[46:03] should both hope and quietly wait for
[46:05] the salvation of the lord amen
[46:08] hope for
[46:09] expect it praise god amen
[46:11] in other words my victory's coming
[46:15] my battle is going to be over someday
[46:17] one day that answer is coming by god's
[46:19] grace
[46:20] hallelujah
[46:22] one day my faith shall become sights
[46:26] one day that promise will be fulfilled
[46:28] hallelujah
[46:32] you might as well use our example from
[46:33] this year awesome our faith of prayers
[46:35] has become sight amen very sins
[46:38] right praise god
[46:42] faith shall become science praise god
[46:44] god keeps his word amen
[46:48] he's good to those that wait to wait for
[46:50] him
[46:52] he said hope and quietly wait for the
[46:54] salvation of god amen
[46:56] i'll stop right there by god's grace
[46:58] does that help by god's grace
[46:59] that was my chapter this morning i'm
[47:01] working my way through the old testament
[47:02] i got the new testament done working my
[47:03] way through the old testament i thought
[47:04] well that's perfect for today
[47:08] just god's mercies that were not
[47:09] consumed
[47:11] right
[47:13] hallelujah now i want to look uh
[47:16] before looking at some other scriptures
[47:17] i want to look uh
[47:20] let's look at the human eye we'll look
[47:21] at the miracle of the human eye for a
[47:22] moment this is a article online i found
[47:27] you know because if you if you see the
[47:29] uh
[47:30] if you see the design of the human eye
[47:32] it helps you appreciate god the designer
[47:34] right but then it gives you a
[47:36] perspective on god's eyes if our eyes
[47:38] are this good how good are god's eyes
[47:41] hallelujah
[47:44] here's how the eye works let's start
[47:45] with that because this is a little
[47:46] shorter
[47:48] all the different parts of the eye work
[47:49] together to help you see
[47:51] first light passes through the cornea
[47:53] that's that front layer on the eye
[47:55] it's shaped like a dome
[47:57] and bends lights to help the eye focus
[48:00] that cornea bends the light you've
[48:02] already got
[48:03] a light bending tool on the very front
[48:05] of your eye
[48:08] bends the light it's helping focus you
[48:10] can't focus without that cornea
[48:13] some of the light enters the eye through
[48:15] the opening called the pupil that's that
[48:17] the darkest spot of your eyelid i think
[48:18] that's the apple of my apple the i2
[48:20] people say
[48:21] the bible says god's going to set us as
[48:23] the apple of his eye
[48:25] amen
[48:29] and the iris uh is the colored part
[48:31] controls how much light the pupil left
[48:34] in
[48:36] and next light passes through the lens
[48:39] the lens work together with the cornea
[48:41] to focus light correctly on the retina
[48:44] when light hits the retina
[48:47] special cells called
[48:49] photoreceptors
[48:51] turn light into electrical signals
[48:56] i just said something there that i don't
[48:57] understand
[49:00] there's certain cells in the eye
[49:03] that absorb light and change and
[49:06] transfer into electric signal
[49:11] it's beyond my i got my comprehension
[49:16] then these electric signals travel from
[49:18] the retina through the optic nerve into
[49:21] the brain then the brain turns the
[49:23] signals into the images you see and
[49:25] that's the really shortened version of
[49:27] it
[49:27] it's way more difficult than that
[49:30] i think there's like it flips the
[49:31] picture and something like that the eye
[49:33] just like a camera you know
[49:36] the eye is an amazing thing
[49:39] and then you gotta have tears to make
[49:40] your eyes work correctly see why god has
[49:41] to break our heart sometimes
[49:43] make us cry you gotta have tears
[49:46] keep your eyes working the right way
[49:50] now what's amazing church is the eye has
[49:52] over 130
[49:54] million photo detectors
[50:00] catches the light that gets through
[50:02] 130 million in each eye
[50:06] it's 260 million
[50:08] 260 million souls
[50:10] ourselves rather than souls
[50:13] cells that catch light and instantly in
[50:16] a matter of a matter of milliseconds
[50:20] take that light
[50:22] and convert it into electric signal and
[50:23] send it into your brain
[50:25] so then you can see what what's what's
[50:27] coming in
[50:30] 260 million at
[50:32] one time
[50:34] now
[50:35] an article i read says that
[50:37] uh the the person who invented the the
[50:39] camera
[50:42] they tried different things and they got
[50:43] the best design from the human eye
[50:46] and so all these cameras in our phones
[50:48] and my phone's up there all these
[50:49] cameras are all based upon the human eye
[50:52] see man doesn't come up with nothing
[50:53] himself
[50:54] he always steals it from god that's
[50:56] right
[50:57] there you have it
[50:59] borrows it from god
[51:01] so
[51:02] man each one of you have 260 million
[51:05] photoreceptors guess how many
[51:06] photoreceptors in a regular camera
[51:09] 265.
[51:12] to your phone you think oh let me take a
[51:14] good selfie here
[51:17] here come here buddy let's take a selfie
[51:18] sign
[51:20] that's a pretty good picture that's
[51:22] nothing compared to what god does
[51:23] through your eyes every single second
[51:25] amen that's 265 photoreceptors
[51:30] instantly converted
[51:33] but your eyes actually faster than that
[51:35] right we'll get the picture it'll
[51:37] process for a second and then you look
[51:38] at the picture oh that's pretty nice
[51:41] god is way faster than that
[51:43] did you know charles darwin described
[51:46] the i was the greatest challenge to his
[51:48] theory of evolution you know the eye
[51:50] the human eye
[51:53] where you guys talk about that
[51:56] how can he explain it
[51:57] after the after all the eye is simply
[52:00] incompatible with evolution
[52:02] he said quote to suppose that the i with
[52:05] all of its
[52:08] inimitable contrivances i can't say
[52:10] something's worth could have been formed
[52:12] by natural selection scenes i freely
[52:14] confess absurd in the highest degree he
[52:16] wrote that in 1909. that's your brother
[52:18] was born
[52:20] oh he had the eyes of god he was he was
[52:21] the seer
[52:23] hallelujah
[52:26] so even he said it's absurd to think the
[52:29] i could evolve
[52:32] didn't jesus christ say the eye is the
[52:34] lamp of the body
[52:36] the eye is the lamp it brings the light
[52:38] right allows you to catch the light
[52:44] and uh scientists say the human eye is
[52:47] even more sharp
[52:48] eye than any other eye of all the
[52:50] animals
[52:51] remember some of those spiders they got
[52:53] lots of eyes don't they
[52:55] there's all kinds of different eyes
[52:57] but ours would be the greatest eyes
[53:00] human eyes discriminate fine detail
[53:05] and it's incomparable with any other eye
[53:07] out there
[53:12] the and now let's go back to these uh
[53:14] these signals so remember the cells
[53:16] catch these signals
[53:18] these signals these like electric
[53:20] signals travel at a rate of a billion
[53:22] per second to the brain
[53:25] a billion per second
[53:29] a billion
[53:31] none of us can understand that number
[53:33] a billion
[53:35] electrical uh data points flow right to
[53:38] your brain
[53:39] in a second a billion
[53:44] so the problem for darwin is how can so
[53:46] many intricate components and remember
[53:48] these
[53:49] these nerves are
[53:51] they're microscopic
[53:52] yeah
[53:54] 130 million in your eye
[53:56] they're just typing
[53:58] how does that evolve
[53:59] 130 minutes darwin said
[54:02] he thought when things got smaller they
[54:04] got less intricate but the exact
[54:06] opposite is true
[54:07] the smaller you look down at cells
[54:10] the smaller you look down at dna the
[54:12] more intricate it gets amen
[54:15] remember the dna strand if you typed out
[54:17] the code of dna strand i think it
[54:19] reached to the moon and back and put on
[54:20] paper 15 times i think was the if i'm
[54:22] remembering right that's just one cell
[54:27] all the information in dna
[54:30] this is the book of life praise god amen
[54:32] you've got a book of life and everyone
[54:34] here sells praise god but thank god your
[54:36] name is book of life
[54:38] that's the book that's most important
[54:40] praise god amen
[54:41] but god put a book of life inside of
[54:43] your natural life your body
[54:48] if one single component out of all these
[54:51] parts we talked about cornea retina poop
[54:53] pupil if one component didn't work you
[54:55] couldn't see
[54:56] nothing would work at all
[54:59] if the slightest thing goes wrong
[55:01] the cornea gets fuzzy the pupil fails to
[55:04] dilate the lens becomes opaque the
[55:06] focusing goes wrong
[55:08] then and recognizable image is not
[55:10] formed
[55:11] either it functions as a whole or not at
[55:13] all
[55:15] so how can all those
[55:16] millions and millions
[55:18] of cells all form just randomly like
[55:21] they just they just happened
[55:24] no they were designed there perfectly
[55:25] all 130 million can you imagine god
[55:27] packing all those sensors into that cell
[55:30] see that's what the bible says when you
[55:32] were born in your womb god was forming
[55:34] you praise god
[55:36] he was placed imagine he's placing all
[55:37] those 130 million
[55:39] just around the around the circle of
[55:41] your eyelid or circle on the inside
[55:43] circle of your eyeball praise god
[55:46] so you can see so you can see today as
[55:49] you can see the flowers you can see the
[55:51] sky you can see the sun you can see that
[55:53] nice dessert right there you can see
[55:55] your nice lunch and supper so you can
[55:57] see your mom's smiling face praise god
[56:00] god gave you this eyesight so you know
[56:02] god you're looking through natural eyes
[56:04] but today god wants you to look through
[56:06] his eyes amen
[56:08] thank god for the natural eyes
[56:11] but god is showing us all these amazing
[56:13] facts so we'll look through his eyes
[56:16] amen
[56:19] proverbs 20 verse 12. people are
[56:21] darcasia the bible says the hearing ear
[56:23] and the seeing eye there's another
[56:24] sermon i gotta get i gotta get to the
[56:26] hearing here maybe next time we'll see
[56:28] the hearing here the seeing eye the lord
[56:30] hath made them both
[56:32] see god god takes specific credit i'm
[56:34] the one that made the eye
[56:37] because nobody else could even get close
[56:39] man if you get 256 receptors
[56:42] god gets 130 million
[56:44] in a tiny little space
[56:47] and then can
[56:48] can transfer those in and uh
[56:51] and decode all those signals
[56:53] in a billion in one second
[56:58] how we love the lord praise god amen
[56:59] amen
[57:00] psalm 94 verse 9.
[57:04] psalm 94 verse 9.
[57:11] he who planted the ear shall he not hear
[57:14] he who form the eye shall he not see
[57:19] so we see
[57:20] god made both
[57:22] and god formed the eye god his sight
[57:28] praise god
[57:31] one british science physicist wrote this
[57:33] in 1980 the year i was born we must go
[57:35] further than this and admit that the
[57:37] only acceptable alternative is creation
[57:40] i know that this is anathema to
[57:42] physicists as indeed it is to me but we
[57:45] must not reject a theory that we do not
[57:48] like if the experimental evidence
[57:50] supports it
[57:51] so even an atheist says we've got to
[57:54] accept that some higher power created
[57:57] the eyeball
[57:59] that was in 1980 41 42 years ago when i
[58:01] was born
[58:03] and darwin admitted it in 1909 over 130
[58:06] some years ago
[58:09] just looking at the human eye alone
[58:11] should cause someone to know god is a
[58:13] creator amen
[58:15] if god lets me see with these eyes how
[58:17] much more could i see with his eyes
[58:19] i'm talking about my life
[58:21] much more can i look at my life through
[58:23] god's eyes
[58:26] and then i would know that god is
[58:28] guiding my life amen
[58:31] god led like brother also said god led
[58:33] him out to arizona although it didn't
[58:34] seem like it right maybe to us
[58:36] god let him out there because there was
[58:38] nean out there
[58:39] right
[58:41] god will lead certain things of our life
[58:43] we don't understand why we just feel
[58:45] like we got to do it it's god leading us
[58:47] because he sees the beginning from the
[58:49] end that's right
[58:52] glory
[58:55] much more could be said remember second
[58:56] chronicles 16 verse nine i'll try to
[58:59] close up here give me ten minutes here
[59:00] by god's grace boys
[59:05] for the eyes of the lord run to and fro
[59:07] throughout the whole earth to show
[59:09] himself strong in the behalf of them
[59:12] whose heart is perfect toward him i've
[59:14] read this over the last few months here
[59:17] so let's look at that again second
[59:18] chronicles 69.
[59:20] god's eyes run to and fro
[59:24] to show himself strong in the behalf of
[59:27] those whose heart is perfect
[59:29] toward him so let's not forget psalm 32
[59:32] there's going to be times we got to wait
[59:33] though
[59:34] god wants to show himself strong in us
[59:36] but we got to wait
[59:38] the bible says even wait quietly but
[59:40] then the bible says shout for joy
[59:42] so i guess sometimes you're waiting
[59:43] quietly sometimes you're shouting for
[59:44] joy with the songs of victory praise god
[59:48] songs of deliverance
[59:52] so god's eyes are always looking for
[59:53] someone to run around all over the earth
[59:56] who can i show myself strong in who's
[59:58] waiting on me praise god who's waiting
[1:00:00] for my word who's trusting in my word
[1:00:03] hallelujah
[1:00:07] good scripture another good scripture on
[1:00:08] the eyes of the lord
[1:00:11] i'm glad he's watching your life you're
[1:00:12] telling me he's watching your life
[1:00:14] i love the story of hagar
[1:00:17] you know we listen to that uh adam and
[1:00:19] eve story we have this
[1:00:20] audio series it's a pretty good one
[1:00:23] but hagar is basically like taken out of
[1:00:25] egypt when abraham and sarah left
[1:00:28] egypt
[1:00:31] and she becomes a maid servant which is
[1:00:33] not a slave a maid servant she had
[1:00:35] rights to you know she writes as well
[1:00:37] preach on lord willing
[1:00:38] but in genesis 16
[1:00:42] sarah gets angry against hagar
[1:00:46] and you know the story
[1:00:49] hagar or sarah gets mad and throws her
[1:00:52] out
[1:00:52] the bible said hagar went wandering
[1:00:55] through the wilderness can you imagine
[1:00:58] you already got taken out of egypt
[1:01:00] you're in a different land
[1:01:02] all you've done is done what your
[1:01:04] masters have told you do she even at
[1:01:06] that time she'd already been with
[1:01:07] abraham
[1:01:08] she just done everything they told her
[1:01:10] to do
[1:01:11] and then sarah turned on her kicks her
[1:01:13] out
[1:01:15] she's not the free woman she's the
[1:01:17] bondwoman
[1:01:19] so she's wandering in a country she
[1:01:20] doesn't know
[1:01:23] all alone
[1:01:24] but church she found out pretty soon she
[1:01:26] wasn't all alone
[1:01:28] i didn't hear you praise god she thought
[1:01:30] nobody saw her she thought nobody cared
[1:01:32] for her
[1:01:37] but the angel of the lord come to her
[1:01:40] and the angel said hey god what a lethe
[1:01:43] what bothers you
[1:01:45] and she says i've got you know my master
[1:01:47] and his wife have put me out
[1:01:52] and the bible says the angel says go
[1:01:54] back unto sarah and submit yourself unto
[1:01:56] her
[1:01:58] now she's wandering she has no direction
[1:02:00] and look the spirit of god shows up
[1:02:02] glory
[1:02:03] spirit of god shows up and tells her
[1:02:07] what to do in other words god showed her
[1:02:09] the way she should go praise god amen
[1:02:13] and this is just the benefit of being
[1:02:14] around abraham the friend of god the
[1:02:17] prophet of god
[1:02:18] amen right there that's right he that
[1:02:20] honors the prophet gets a prophet's
[1:02:22] rewarding then there it is right there
[1:02:24] she got a promise reward just by obeying
[1:02:27] the prophet
[1:02:29] of course she wasn't on the same level
[1:02:30] sarah
[1:02:32] she's a bomb woman but she got a
[1:02:34] prophet's reward in other words the the
[1:02:36] god of the prophet said his angel to
[1:02:39] help her out
[1:02:41] and the bible said even out there in the
[1:02:42] wilderness where it's dry and hot the
[1:02:44] bible said god had a well for her
[1:02:47] to drink water
[1:02:49] remember the name of that well
[1:02:51] beer
[1:02:53] lehigh road
[1:02:54] beer lahaira
[1:02:56] anyone know what that means
[1:02:58] it means the well of the living one
[1:03:01] sees me
[1:03:04] i'm kicked out i'm all alone i'm in the
[1:03:07] desert i don't know where i am and god's
[1:03:10] angel comes here and tells her
[1:03:12] you are seen
[1:03:13] my eye is on you i know this situation
[1:03:17] i know what's going to happen here i've
[1:03:19] already seen this god has saw you praise
[1:03:21] god god cares about you breaks up and if
[1:03:23] god cares for the bond woman what about
[1:03:26] the free woman amen
[1:03:28] hallelujah if god sees the bottom woman
[1:03:30] that's kicked out and she's not even on
[1:03:31] the same and she's the type of the old
[1:03:33] testament what about the new testament
[1:03:35] praise god
[1:03:36] if god saw that he knows this in the
[1:03:38] church let me tell you god sees you
[1:03:40] today praise god
[1:03:45] and that was her word she gave it she
[1:03:46] gave the well that name
[1:03:48] beer lahiro be luck beer lahaira
[1:03:51] the well of the living one has seen me
[1:03:53] the eyes of the living one has seen me
[1:03:56] hallelujah the well the living one seen
[1:03:57] me
[1:03:59] in other words god see when i feel like
[1:04:00] i'm wandering around when i feel like
[1:04:02] i'm nobody else god sees me
[1:04:05] and god provides for me yes
[1:04:08] and that's not the seat of abraham
[1:04:13] if god sees the bond woman or the
[1:04:15] maidservant what about the free woman
[1:04:17] galatians chapter 4 we're not going to
[1:04:19] read it i've reached on a while back
[1:04:21] the bible says the bond woman in fremont
[1:04:23] were a type for us the bond woman
[1:04:27] hagar type the old testament law
[1:04:30] we type the new testament
[1:04:33] we are children of the promise
[1:04:37] and remember remember church after she
[1:04:39] had ishmael and and sarah had isaac
[1:04:42] remember ishmael made fun of isaac
[1:04:44] abraham kicked him out
[1:04:47] and then they're they're about ready to
[1:04:48] die the bible said she threw the child
[1:04:50] under the bush through or dropped him or
[1:04:52] something like some crazy language
[1:04:54] and she said i can't stand to see this
[1:04:56] child die and who comes again but the
[1:04:57] angel of the lord again
[1:05:01] in other words the angel says let me
[1:05:03] give you god's eyesight for your life
[1:05:06] this is not where it's going to end
[1:05:08] he said god is going to use ishmael he's
[1:05:10] going to be a mighty hunter he's going
[1:05:11] to raise him up a kingdom oh look
[1:05:14] no no doubt she rejoiced and then the
[1:05:16] bible said then god opened hagar's eyes
[1:05:18] and she saw the well that she could
[1:05:19] drink from
[1:05:20] it was there the whole time she just
[1:05:22] couldn't see it she needed god's
[1:05:23] eyesight amen
[1:05:26] praise god
[1:05:28] so look even with the the bondwoman even
[1:05:30] with those that are not under the
[1:05:32] promise
[1:05:32] god still opens their eyes to see their
[1:05:35] position oh and god has opened up our
[1:05:38] eyes oh god help us to see our position
[1:05:40] amen amen amen
[1:05:42] oh it's mighty that's right
[1:05:45] he opened hagar's eyes may god open our
[1:05:47] eyes
[1:05:48] to see that he has wells for us amen
[1:05:51] hallelujah
[1:05:52] he has victories for us
[1:05:55] god's eye church is your guide
[1:06:01] god's eye he said i will guide them with
[1:06:03] my eye god will give you vision god will
[1:06:06] give you leadership of the holy spirit
[1:06:08] god will show you which way you need to
[1:06:09] go amen
[1:06:11] he'll guide you with his eye praise god
[1:06:14] how do you believe that amen
[1:06:16] how many believe it was god's eye that
[1:06:18] was directing moses out of the
[1:06:19] wilderness for 40 years that's right
[1:06:21] brother ram said defeat can you imagine
[1:06:23] i'm going to beat all that egypt and
[1:06:25] stuff out of him
[1:06:28] he got it beat
[1:06:30] jason all the arguments on the back side
[1:06:32] of the desert as he said i want to say
[1:06:34] beating it out of him
[1:06:36] god's eye saw that he thought my life is
[1:06:38] done i'm finished
[1:06:40] with with his eyes he could kill one
[1:06:42] egyptian but with god's eyes he
[1:06:44] delivered two million people that's
[1:06:45] right
[1:06:46] that's right
[1:06:47] how many of you god's i will guide you
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:51] glory
[1:06:53] abraham the same way he wondered all
[1:06:55] these places the bible said he did not
[1:06:58] know where he was going so he would wait
[1:07:01] patiently on god just like psalm 32 says
[1:07:03] just like david did he'd wait patiently
[1:07:05] he confessed his sins and then god would
[1:07:08] show him the way to go
[1:07:10] hallelujah
[1:07:14] led job into his greatest trials
[1:07:16] god suggested satan to test job
[1:07:21] god suggested it
[1:07:25] but yet was god still guiding job with
[1:07:27] his eye yes or no what do you think
[1:07:29] of course yes
[1:07:31] god saw the end from this part
[1:07:35] god saw the double blessing the best was
[1:07:37] yet to come
[1:07:38] how did i read scofield's words these
[1:07:40] are some of the most beautiful words
[1:07:41] about job i've never read
[1:07:43] the problem of which the book of job is
[1:07:45] the profound discussion finds here at
[1:07:48] solution in job 42 verse 6. i'm going to
[1:07:50] turn there job 42 verse 6 we find
[1:07:53] we find the solution to job's problem
[1:07:58] so
[1:08:00] how many one know the solution to job's
[1:08:01] problem
[1:08:02] okay i got a few events all right
[1:08:04] i'll take it
[1:08:07] so the solution is wherefore i abhor
[1:08:09] myself and repent and dust and ashes
[1:08:12] scofield says this is the solution to
[1:08:14] job's problem
[1:08:16] he learns to hate his sinful nature
[1:08:20] you've got two sides right you got a
[1:08:21] human nature and you got divine nature
[1:08:23] we're partakers of divine nature by
[1:08:25] promise
[1:08:26] is that your name
[1:08:28] his trials job's trials
[1:08:31] led him by the holy spirit to hate his
[1:08:33] human nature his own sinful side
[1:08:36] remember he exalted himself above god
[1:08:38] brother
[1:08:40] he said god is unrighteous and i'm
[1:08:42] righteous
[1:08:44] god's doing wrong i've done right the
[1:08:46] whole time
[1:08:49] and god was bringing job down to humble
[1:08:51] him and said god is righteous amen
[1:08:54] that's right you're the one who needs to
[1:08:55] repent
[1:08:56] is that right
[1:08:59] so here's the solution
[1:09:01] trials will make us humble ourselves and
[1:09:03] realize god is greater than us amen
[1:09:05] god's eyesight there's my tendons
[1:09:08] god's eyesight sees a little more than
[1:09:09] our eyesight amen
[1:09:12] and church i need this too i'm not
[1:09:14] putting myself out i need this i need
[1:09:15] god's eyesight
[1:09:17] if we have a hard month of finances i'll
[1:09:18] get discouraged or the church had a
[1:09:20] little tough moment
[1:09:21] why can't i see ahead a couple years
[1:09:24] why can't i see when the blessing's
[1:09:25] coming you know
[1:09:28] we all get discouraged
[1:09:29] we all go through this but this is god's
[1:09:32] way and god's ways are always the best
[1:09:34] ways amen amen hallelujah amen his ways
[1:09:38] are past finding out as the heavens are
[1:09:41] from the earth so are god's ways higher
[1:09:43] than our ways
[1:09:45] i can just preach that one over and over
[1:09:46] again i love that though
[1:09:48] brought into the presence of god joe is
[1:09:50] revealed to himself
[1:09:53] see when you go through trials your
[1:09:55] sinful side you see your sinful side and
[1:09:57] you see who you really are yeah in your
[1:09:59] sin nature yeah and i don't even talk
[1:10:01] about after you're born again
[1:10:04] i'm glad i got some money
[1:10:06] or something
[1:10:07] or oh yeah
[1:10:10] even after you're born again you see oh
[1:10:12] i still have a sinful nature and i don't
[1:10:14] like it
[1:10:17] hates god the bible says the flesh is
[1:10:19] hatred against god yes amen
[1:10:24] joe was in no sense of a hypocrite
[1:10:25] scofield said but godly and possessing a
[1:10:28] faith which all his afflictions could
[1:10:30] not shake
[1:10:31] i'll do so he still had faith even
[1:10:32] though he said bad things even though he
[1:10:35] exalted himself he still had unmovable
[1:10:37] faith
[1:10:38] he was just getting in the flesh and the
[1:10:40] church said
[1:10:41] sometimes you and i just get in the
[1:10:43] flesh
[1:10:45] we gotta look past the church
[1:10:47] we gotta look past we gotta forgive
[1:10:50] and if we're wrong we gotta say forgive
[1:10:51] me jesus
[1:10:56] job was yet self-righteous and lacking
[1:10:59] in humility which chapter 9 of job 29
[1:11:02] chapter 29 of job clearly shows
[1:11:05] he says i am righteous and god is
[1:11:06] unrighteous
[1:11:08] but in the presence of god oh there's
[1:11:10] his hiding place amen but in the hiding
[1:11:12] place
[1:11:16] the problem is solved
[1:11:18] the godly are afflicted that they might
[1:11:20] be brought to self-knowledge and
[1:11:22] self-judgment
[1:11:24] such afflictions are not penal they're
[1:11:26] not uh forever punishing us for our sins
[1:11:29] but they're remedial and purifying amen
[1:11:32] in other words trials are meant to
[1:11:34] purify you
[1:11:36] not to punish you like god's angry at
[1:11:38] you
[1:11:39] they're to purify you
[1:11:43] the book of job affords a sublime
[1:11:45] illustration of the truth announced in
[1:11:47] the scripture
[1:11:49] if we would judge ourselves we would not
[1:11:51] be judged
[1:11:53] see job wasn't judging himself right
[1:11:56] right he was judging i'm greater than
[1:11:57] god that's the wrong judgment right
[1:12:01] he didn't judge himself right there in
[1:12:03] the middle and god had to humble him at
[1:12:04] the end of his life or i was at the end
[1:12:06] of the trial
[1:12:10] remember ilahu
[1:12:12] took job up and down and rebuked to
[1:12:14] rebuke rebuke rebuke rebuke
[1:12:18] that's what he deserved
[1:12:20] that's what all of us deserve sometimes
[1:12:26] and i like what scofield ends with this
[1:12:28] but best of all
[1:12:30] such self-knowledge and self-judgment of
[1:12:32] our sinful nature is the prelude to
[1:12:35] greater fruitfulness
[1:12:38] in other words we've got to see our weak
[1:12:40] human side repent of it and then we'll
[1:12:43] see greater spiritual fruit in our lives
[1:12:44] amen yes amen
[1:12:52] so again i see four benefits of
[1:12:53] suffering
[1:12:54] self-knowledge and self-judgment which
[1:12:56] is brings humility
[1:13:00] the second benefit you learn obedience
[1:13:03] benefit you get greater fruitfulness
[1:13:06] and the fourth benefit you can be a
[1:13:08] testimony to other people
[1:13:10] because of the things you suffer amen
[1:13:13] because eternal life is living for
[1:13:15] others so i'm god's allowing me to go
[1:13:17] through this so i can live for others
[1:13:19] how many want to see your life through
[1:13:21] god's eyes amen that's how the musicians
[1:13:23] come to stand to our feet here
[1:13:25] i could go a lot more i got a lot more
[1:13:27] to preach but
[1:13:28] again
[1:13:30] i try to finish all these series and i
[1:13:31] just start new ones every night
[1:13:33] it's funny to me
[1:13:35] maybe not funny right now
[1:13:38] may god help us
[1:13:40] let's have our heads here for word
