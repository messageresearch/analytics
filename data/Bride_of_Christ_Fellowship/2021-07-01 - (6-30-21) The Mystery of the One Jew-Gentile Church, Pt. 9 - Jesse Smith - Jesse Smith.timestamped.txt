[2:50] hard times at night

[2:55] the lord for that i appreciate how the
[2:56] lord
[2:57] writes that upon the fleshly tables of
[2:59] their hearts at such young ages
[3:02] that's a good example for us who are
[3:03] getting a little older uh to let the
[3:05] holy spirit write that upon our hearts
[3:08] verse 11. i'm sorry 41 verse 10. sorry
[3:12] 41 verse 10. let's read this together

[5:41] and i was a great conversation but amen
[5:43] got to have with him that was
[5:44] so wonderful are there any any other
[5:47] requests
[5:48] have on anyone's heart my mom asked for
[5:50] your prayers she had a surgery and she's
[5:52] still recovering
[5:53] so she asked for everybody's prayers as
[5:55] well anybody have any needs cares
[5:59] all right darling we'll pray for that
[6:04] anyone else have any sister
[6:09] oh yeah
[6:13] sure was that eus i just said we just
[6:15] saw her on
[6:16] saturday okay yeah we'll definitely
[6:18] stand in for prayer
[6:19] and if you feel that or remember at the
[6:21] end of service you can come up and stand
[6:22] in for prayer
[6:23] if you feel led you know i can anoint
[6:24] you with oil if you feel led
[6:27] sometimes you know sometimes brother
[6:28] iran would encourage people when the
[6:30] anointing is at the highest
[6:32] but we know god heals right here as well
[6:34] you know when we pray but
[6:35] just it's just one of those uh it's
[6:38] opportunity to be sensitive to the holy
[6:39] spirit to see which way he might want to
[6:41] bring healing but he could bring healing
[6:42] for it right now so
[6:44] you know but one thing i know is you
[6:45] know you have a real tender heart for
[6:46] your family so
[6:48] beau ma'am says you know you have to
[6:49] sometimes it helps to really feel for
[6:51] the person when you pray for them so
[6:53] god bless you for that i saw a little
[6:56] headline on saturday so let's pray
[6:57] let's pray for abi too and you uh so
[7:00] that
[7:00] the testimony is uh that yua will listen

[10:16] for your glory lord in jesus christ's
[10:18] name when the saints said
[10:20] amen god bless you as your being seated
[10:22] praise god so i just i just want to show
[10:24] as we get to this little lesson here i
[10:26] just want to show again
[10:29] uh that slide from sunday so you can
[10:32] switch over
[10:34] the timeline the prophetic timeline um
[10:36] this kind of comes up in the
[10:38] in the book which i have a little update
[10:41] on that the uh
[10:42] i got an email from the editor yesterday
[10:44] and he said i should get the final
[10:46] draft tomorrow but then i got to just
[10:48] make one or two more tweaks on it
[10:50] uh and then i got to add an index so
[10:53] people can find
[10:54] like donald trump's name joe biden's
[10:56] name i put black lives matters in the
[10:58] book i just
[10:58] i tried to bring all the current events
[11:00] up to where we are put cronovirus in
[11:02] there you know
[11:03] just to kind of see where we are here at
[11:05] the end of the seventh church age
[11:06] also brother branham's name and irenaeus
[11:09] and
[11:10] uh patrick and columba all the saints i
[11:12] did a just
[11:13] a long teaching on the church ages i
[11:15] want to have it in the back because i
[11:17] i've bought books in the past and when
[11:19] they have indexes that is so helpful
[11:21] that is one of the greatest helps you
[11:23] can have is to know right where
[11:25] you can't you don't have time to read
[11:26] the whole book but you need to go right
[11:27] to get that information
[11:29] so i got to do that but then hopefully
[11:31] hopefully it'll be uh
[11:33] out in a couple weeks we'll see by god's
[11:34] grace also right now at home i'm
[11:36] uploading
[11:37] the next youtube video it's about
[11:38] clarence larkin it's the longest video i
[11:40] ever did it took me so long
[11:42] i just finished it today it's an hour
[11:44] and 20 minutes
[11:45] proving that brother ram did not
[11:46] plagiarize clarence larkin
[11:48] so i finally got it done i put all the
[11:49] quotes on there so they can see it
[11:51] um so hopefully that'll be a blessing
[11:53] hopefully that will help people
[11:55] as i told you the only thing in future
[11:57] home the only question is in future home
[11:58] brother ram didn't cite anybody
[12:01] but we don't want to jump to the
[12:02] conclusion and say he purposely stole it
[12:05] he didn't purposely steal any
[12:07] information he probably just forgot
[12:09] to cite larkin because he cited larkin
[12:11] in the the church ages he cited him in
[12:13] the 70 weeks he cited him in the seven
[12:15] seals
[12:16] he just forgotten the future home but
[12:18] his emphasis was not on larkin
[12:20] although he used some of larkin's work
[12:22] his emphasis was on the three works of
[12:24] grace
[12:24] aren't you glad for the three works of
[12:26] grace larkin didn't teach the three
[12:28] works of grace i've looked i don't know
[12:29] if you had a chance to look through his
[12:30] books brother have you looked through
[12:31] larkin's books a little bit okay so yeah
[12:34] they're from 1919 and 1920 he wrote a
[12:37] book called the book of revelation
[12:38] and then he wrote a book called
[12:40] dispensational truths
[12:41] and i searched both of them like because
[12:43] you can search electronically for words
[12:45] he never wrote on the three works of
[12:46] grace so when brother am
[12:48] saw the future at home he used at least
[12:50] eight of larkin's teachings
[12:52] but then he showed how it was a it was a
[12:54] it was a type it was a fulfillment of
[12:56] the three works of grace
[12:57] right water blood fire right water blood
[13:00] spirit
[13:01] and so it just seems like brother
[13:03] branham forgot
[13:05] um and so i'm i'm so anyone that denies
[13:08] anyone that calls about the
[13:09] branham a plagiarist uh is either
[13:12] ignorant
[13:13] or they're trying to get people to leave
[13:15] the message on purpose because they got
[13:16] the wrong spirit
[13:18] okay and in the just for example the
[13:21] church ages brother random cited
[13:22] historians
[13:23] over 20 times and they say he's a
[13:26] plagiarist
[13:28] you don't make 20 citations and then say
[13:31] oh this person's a plagiarist in fact i
[13:33] have coached that brother bram said i
[13:35] tried to find
[13:35] all the history i could possibly find he
[13:38] told the brothers
[13:39] the church agencies he said bring all
[13:40] your history books and
[13:42] we'll search it all together we'll find
[13:44] everything that we can from history
[13:46] uh the fact was he just wasn't educated
[13:49] but that's why we love him right because
[13:52] he wasn't educated
[13:53] like the scholars today and those that
[13:55] deny the word of god so we love him
[13:56] because he was humble
[13:58] and he was a real servant of god so
[14:00] let's look at this here tonight you know
[14:01] we'll try to get at least here down to
[14:03] the feast of weeks that's where my goal
[14:05] is because that's
[14:05] that's how it relates to the mystery of
[14:07] the one church
[14:09] of jew and gentile okay so these are
[14:12] uh seven feasts uh
[14:16] given to israel every year they had a a
[14:19] religious year a spiritual year
[14:20] and then a civil year so they had uh
[14:23] these
[14:23] uh these these eight months here of
[14:26] religious year and then they had four
[14:28] months called a civil year
[14:30] and uh god was was giving he was giving
[14:33] a plan
[14:33] of remembrance remember god is the god
[14:36] of memorials
[14:37] praise god that's what i'm gonna work on
[14:38] after i get that video post i'm gonna
[14:39] work on that
[14:40] picture of you and when your dad got
[14:42] healed and everything like that i'm
[14:43] going to work on that next my god's
[14:44] great so i'm going to take a little
[14:45] break from the youtube videos and
[14:46] do some artwork i already bought the
[14:48] crayons and the markers and everything
[14:50] and the colored pencils
[14:51] and get back to doing some artwork so we
[14:52] can remember what god has done
[14:55] uh but uh here we we see that it's it's
[14:58] a it's a memorial to israel but also a
[15:01] prophetic calendar
[15:02] and it's one of the five calendars i
[15:04] showed you remember on sunday i showed
[15:05] you five counters that we can all look
[15:06] at
[15:07] for vision where are we what are we
[15:09] supposed to be doing
[15:10] and so we can see that uh in our
[15:12] calendar here we are in the feast of
[15:14] weeks where the
[15:15] we'd say the last month here we are at
[15:16] the sixth month almost ready for the
[15:18] seventh month
[15:20] it's interesting today's the last day of
[15:21] the six months so just an interesting
[15:23] just a fun little
[15:24] uh it's not a coincidence but it's just
[15:27] a uh
[15:28] just a a probably a sign from the lord
[15:31] right
[15:31] now i got a lot of information from
[15:33] kevin j connor's book called the feast
[15:35] of israel
[15:36] he said all the ceremonies and all that
[15:39] pertains to the letter
[15:40] and ritual of the law are empty in vain
[15:43] apart from the reality of christ
[15:46] so all these things are vain unless you
[15:48] see jesus christ in them
[15:50] and brother man talked about the drink
[15:51] offering and the meal offering and
[15:54] and the passover offering and the token
[15:56] and all that he talked about all that
[15:58] to say that everything pointed to jesus
[16:00] christ and he said if you don't see
[16:02] jesus christ in the scripture
[16:03] go back and read it again right that's
[16:05] the christ the mystery of god reveal
[16:07] that famous quote right
[16:08] so everything was written to point to
[16:10] jesus christ
[16:12] even the parts about evil people that's
[16:13] the judgment of jesus christ
[16:15] amen all right and sinners that's the
[16:17] mercy of that's the longsuffering of
[16:19] jesus christ praise god
[16:21] and so all these things are pointing to
[16:24] christ now
[16:25] under mosaic covenant that we looked at
[16:27] earlier
[16:28] god had three major feasts and two of
[16:31] them had two additional
[16:33] minor feasts for a total of seven
[16:36] feasts now church just a little reminder
[16:39] the word feast doesn't mean like it does
[16:41] to us
[16:42] a feast to israel was a sacred solemn
[16:45] meeting
[16:46] it wasn't like if i say let's have a
[16:48] feast at wingfoot park that's what we
[16:50] did on saturday
[16:51] that's a feast it's laid back it's all
[16:53] just eat as much as you want like that's
[16:54] what i did right drink
[16:56] just drink it whatever drink as much
[16:57] play as much as you want that's not what
[16:59] the feast meant for
[17:00] israel feast was a sacred time it was a
[17:04] holy time it was a
[17:05] divine appointment praise god
[17:08] and so that's why you know these are
[17:10] called even holy convocations
[17:13] solemn assemblies you know and living
[17:15] against 23 we're not going to read it
[17:16] but
[17:17] but the bible details them as all these
[17:20] all these synonyms all these
[17:21] descriptions all pointing to the same
[17:22] thing
[17:23] god wants to meet with his people church
[17:25] arts are glad god wants to meet with you
[17:27] praise god
[17:28] and not just seven times a year but all
[17:31] 365 days amen
[17:34] you know why because you're his temple
[17:36] you're his church you're his tabernacle
[17:39] god walks in you praise god and god
[17:42] speaks through you praise god
[17:44] hallelujah now
[17:48] i want to look at this scripture here uh
[17:51] the bible said three times in a year
[17:54] i'll just read it
[17:55] three times in a year all thy male shall
[17:57] appear before the lord thy god that's
[17:59] jehovah
[18:00] jehovah thy god in the place where he
[18:01] shall choose in the feast of unleavened
[18:04] bread
[18:05] oh yeah that's why i put these in yellow
[18:06] because the scripture the scripture is
[18:08] interesting it just names
[18:09] it highlights these as the main names
[18:11] for the feast the unleavened bread
[18:14] so this is the major feast these are the
[18:15] minor which is interesting this is the
[18:17] major this is the major these are the
[18:19] minor
[18:19] interesting that's what god says here in
[18:22] the feast of unleavened bread the feast
[18:24] of weeks and the feast of tabernacles
[18:26] they shall not appear before the lord
[18:28] empty right that's why we bring our
[18:29] praises
[18:30] that's where we bring our tithes that's
[18:32] why we bring our songs to the house of
[18:33] the lord
[18:34] that's why we bring our prayers here let
[18:36] us not come empty amen
[18:38] let's not come with an empty mind let's
[18:40] come full of the praises of god
[18:42] amen ready to sacrifice unto god
[18:46] amen can i get an amen i get a big
[18:49] healthy
[18:50] amen from everybody that that's the part
[18:52] of your sacrifice tonight amen
[18:54] you didn't come empty you brought a word
[18:56] of praise you brought a word of
[18:58] thanksgiving amen
[19:00] don't come empty come to the house of
[19:01] the lord with praise
[19:04] every man shall give as he is able well
[19:06] see brother jesse i'm just not able to
[19:07] sing praises to god
[19:09] we'll shame on you then right you ought
[19:12] to be able
[19:13] to worship god and love god and have joy
[19:16] and peace and forgiveness
[19:17] you ought to feel happy in the lord the
[19:19] joy of the lord as you're able
[19:21] worship the lord amen hallelujah
[19:25] some are more able than others
[19:26] unfortunately praise god right
[19:28] some people don't want to worship the
[19:30] lord but we all should be worshiping the
[19:32] lord we should all be able and willing
[19:34] to give god our best when we gather
[19:36] together praise god
[19:38] see you give as you're able according to
[19:41] the blessing of the lord like god which
[19:43] he has given me praise god
[19:45] amen what a blessing praise god you
[19:47] worship god
[19:48] according to how much he's blessed you
[19:50] praise god oh hallelujah
[19:53] he that's forgiven much love is much he
[19:56] that's forgiven much
[19:57] praises much he that's forgiven much
[20:00] worships enough
[20:01] or worships much praise god that's how
[20:03] we should look at we should see
[20:05] all that he's done for us and be willing
[20:06] to come full
[20:08] of praises and give god based upon what
[20:11] he's done for us
[20:12] according to the blessings of god we
[20:14] ought to pour out of thanksgiving
[20:17] ah thank you jesus amen for all the
[20:20] blessings praise god
[20:22] hallelujah now in leviticus 23 it gives
[20:27] all seven feasts now i'm going to share
[20:28] this i was a little confused
[20:30] somebody told me last year that
[20:34] two of the feasts are not called feasts
[20:37] and i kind of stumbled a little bit on
[20:39] that but
[20:40] that's because i was thinking feast
[20:42] meant party right like we had on
[20:44] saturday
[20:46] and so in the book i got it i got it
[20:47] mixed up so i got to fix it before it
[20:49] goes to print
[20:50] uh because the the the day of trumpets
[20:53] is never caught a feast in the bible
[20:54] it's just called a day of trumpets
[20:56] and the the the day of atonement is
[20:58] never called feast of atonement
[21:01] right but if you read earlier in the
[21:04] chapter it does say
[21:05] all the feasts are holy convocations
[21:07] unto the lord
[21:08] and then it says the day of trumpets and
[21:10] the day of uh
[21:12] and the day of atonement are holy
[21:13] convocations unto the lord
[21:16] so see my this is where i'm just being
[21:18] honest i grow in understanding
[21:20] i don't have it all figured out i don't
[21:21] have all the answers but i can grow in
[21:23] grace and knowledge of the lord
[21:25] and so i'm sorry uh if i've taught that
[21:27] wrong before but they are all seven
[21:29] feasts it's just they're it's a
[21:31] different meaning of feast than what i
[21:33] was thinking
[21:33] it's actually sacred assemblies amen
[21:37] it's holy gatherings it's holy
[21:39] assemblies praise god
[21:42] uh so all seven are listed in leviticus
[21:45] chapter 23
[21:46] but then you find them you know more
[21:47] about them all throughout the scripture
[21:49] see god said i you have to meet with me
[21:52] on my terms
[21:54] you can't come whenever you want you
[21:56] have to come when i tell you to come
[21:59] it's god's provided place of worship
[22:01] amen
[22:02] hallelujah he said you meet with me here
[22:05] at my place
[22:06] bring the sacrifices i want to be
[22:08] offered
[22:09] and and you are going to abstain from
[22:11] work and focus on your relationship with
[22:14] me praise god
[22:16] amen see they were not to do any work in
[22:18] church let's come to the house of god
[22:19] and not think about work
[22:21] let's think about jesus while we're here
[22:23] praise god for some of us it's easier
[22:25] than others so for me
[22:26] it's very easy for me to forget about
[22:28] work right now because i'm not working
[22:30] but even during the school year i've got
[22:32] to be careful to do that not to think
[22:33] about work
[22:34] but to think about the things of god so
[22:36] god said just
[22:37] leave all your agriculture behind right
[22:39] leave all your farm and your seeds and
[22:40] and your harvesting leave that behind
[22:43] and come appear before me
[22:45] hallelujah forget about the things of
[22:47] the world
[22:48] focus on heaven amen hallelujah
[22:52] and it wasn't optional if these these
[22:54] males had to appear
[22:56] right and that we would say they would
[22:58] be the biggest workers in the field
[22:59] right because god gave men a little more
[23:00] strength right
[23:01] the woman's called the weaker vessel
[23:02] that's no offense to hurts god's desire
[23:04] god has to have a greater god has to
[23:06] have a lesser we're the lesser when it
[23:07] comes to christ right
[23:08] even us brothers are lesser right we're
[23:11] christ is our head
[23:12] so it's it's no shame but god said all
[23:15] the men all the hard workers have to
[23:17] leave
[23:17] off work and appear before me and don't
[23:20] come empty bring
[23:22] all the all the sacrifices and then any
[23:24] extra
[23:25] according to the blessing you've
[23:27] received
[23:29] i don't know so you really found out who
[23:31] really loved god at that time praise god
[23:33] who brought the most blessing or were
[23:34] the most offerings
[23:36] who had the who had the the free will
[23:39] heart to really sacrifice
[23:40] unto the lord
[23:44] right so now you can see the historical
[23:46] the memorial aspect of this
[23:48] but also the prophetic aspect so let's
[23:52] begin with the passover it was the 14th
[23:54] day on the first month it was called the
[23:56] new year at the evening now remember
[23:58] jewish days start at sundown
[24:01] so as soon as we start seeing the sun
[24:03] down it's priority going down this
[24:04] is actually the start of thursday for
[24:06] jews it's already thursday now for us
[24:08] it's wednesday
[24:10] right it goes from sun sun down to
[24:11] sundown that's a day
[24:13] right so for them they've already
[24:15] started a thursday but we're still on
[24:16] wednesday so we got to keep that in mind
[24:18] right
[24:19] so that's why jesus had to die before
[24:21] the sun went down he didn't die on the
[24:23] friday
[24:24] right so part of that day all day
[24:25] saturday and then raised on sunday
[24:28] so he had to be die and raised within
[24:30] three days right
[24:31] just like jonah was in the heart of the
[24:32] art of the fish three days three nights
[24:35] so uh here they had they met on this
[24:38] 14th day
[24:39] each family sacrificed one one
[24:42] one-year-old
[24:43] male lamb and they ate a meal the lamb
[24:46] along with
[24:47] unleavened bread this was a memorial of
[24:49] god delivering them
[24:50] from egyptian slavery and there's many
[24:52] places that talk about this
[24:54] like exodus 12 leviticus 23 deuteronomy
[24:56] 16.
[24:57] the purpose the prophetic purpose was
[25:00] fulfilled in jesus's death on calvary
[25:03] and he fulfilled the details to the
[25:05] letter he died both for jew and gentiles
[25:08] praise god did it did it uh there was a
[25:11] mixed multitude that came out of egypt
[25:13] right
[25:14] gentiles hallelujah there was jew and
[25:17] gentile see the lamb
[25:19] brought out both amen hallelujah
[25:22] and the bible says in first john 2 verse
[25:24] 2 jesus christ
[25:26] is the propituation for our sins and not
[25:29] for
[25:30] ours only but also for the sins of the
[25:32] whole world
[25:34] remember propitiation is a wrath bearer
[25:37] or a wrath
[25:38] taker a wrath appeasement so god has no
[25:42] wrath against you as long as you're
[25:43] trusting in jesus christ
[25:45] god's wrath is not for you god's favors
[25:48] for you
[25:48] god's blessing is for you don't worry
[25:50] about the wrath of god
[25:51] trust in the favor of god jesus is the
[25:55] propitiation which is the same word
[25:57] for mercy jesus is your mercy seat amen
[26:01] he took the blood praise god he took the
[26:03] wrath the wrath was put on him the blood
[26:05] was sprinkled on him
[26:07] that we will be condemned we'll be
[26:09] forgiven praise god
[26:11] hallelujah he delivered us from all
[26:14] slavery of sin just like they got
[26:16] delivered from egypt's slavery
[26:19] so church don't be a slave to sin
[26:20] tonight you'll battle it but overcome it
[26:23] keep
[26:24] resisting the devil he'll flee from you
[26:26] praise god don't be a slave to it don't
[26:28] go from
[26:28] week to week you're still a slave stop
[26:30] the slavery
[26:32] you're free man your free woman the lamb
[26:34] has set you free don't be a slave
[26:36] be a free child in jesus name
[26:40] hallelujah all slavery we're delivered
[26:43] from
[26:44] and paul says in first corinthians 5 7
[26:46] we
[26:47] keep the fact the passover now which
[26:49] means we're partaking of the lord's
[26:52] supper
[26:52] in remembrance of him right
[26:56] so just like they would eat the bitter
[26:57] herbs and they would eat that meal and
[27:00] and they knew death was going to pass
[27:01] over them we're doing the same thing
[27:03] tonight amen
[27:04] we're feasting on the good word or the
[27:06] bitter word of god right
[27:08] and sometimes it's hard sometimes it's
[27:09] difficult we're feasting on that but
[27:11] where we have
[27:12] anticipation praise god amen we have
[27:14] anticipation
[27:15] that the the death angel is going to
[27:17] pass over us amen
[27:19] because we're sighing and crying for the
[27:21] abominations done in this city
[27:22] we're going to be marked by god but the
[27:24] passover the death angel will pass over
[27:27] us
[27:27] and we will go in the third exodus amen
[27:30] they win the first exodus pentecost was
[27:32] the second
[27:33] we go in the third death is gonna the
[27:35] tribulation will pass after us amen
[27:38] we're gonna meet christ in the air oh
[27:40] that's exactly right
[27:42] but see we're spiritually keeping the
[27:44] passover now
[27:46] praise god so it's like we're keeping
[27:48] these four praise god
[27:50] and these three last three all deal with
[27:52] israel well i'm sorry these two
[27:54] this deals with us as well that's us
[27:56] because that's the millennium
[27:58] okay now let's move on to the unleavened
[28:01] bread i was gonna try to make some good
[28:02] progress here i didn't even set my timer
[28:03] so let me set my timer now
[28:05] all right unleavened bread now beginning
[28:08] on the evening of the passover this
[28:09] bread feast
[28:11] lasted seven days emphasizing a diet
[28:14] totally separate from leaven so you had
[28:16] to do a whole week with no leaven
[28:19] right so just unleavened bread it
[28:22] represented
[28:22] israel partaking of no egyptian
[28:25] influences
[28:27] because leaven puffs up an entire lump
[28:29] of dough
[28:30] right it'll make the whole thing puff up
[28:33] and puffing up represents pride
[28:36] right puffing up you're puffed up in
[28:37] pride
[28:39] any israeli with leaven found in his
[28:41] house was
[28:42] instantly cut off from the congregation
[28:45] right that's pretty serious
[28:50] what if i come over to your house and i
[28:51] what if i just surprised you
[28:53] and knocked on the door and i found one
[28:56] uh
[28:58] what could i say i found one evil thing
[29:00] in your house
[29:02] what what an evil magazine or what what
[29:04] a magazine with one bad word
[29:05] or one bad picture what if i looked at
[29:07] your bookshelf and i found one
[29:10] picture that was wrong in your book and
[29:12] you say oh you're cut off from the
[29:14] church
[29:15] that's pretty serious they couldn't have
[29:18] one speck of leaven not
[29:20] one speck of pride not one speck of the
[29:22] world amen
[29:24] because it was speaking of jesus christ
[29:27] amen
[29:28] speaking of christ had no sin right but
[29:32] once in the promised land
[29:34] they were to explain this feast to their
[29:36] children in memory of god's mighty hand
[29:38] to deliver them
[29:39] so they had passover or the first night
[29:42] and then they had
[29:42] unleavened bread here okay now this
[29:45] jesus fulfills this again his death
[29:49] separates us from our sins so the lamb
[29:51] died and they had no leaven
[29:52] jesus christ died he had no leaven
[29:55] praise god
[29:56] he took all the lev all the leaven was
[29:58] put away hallelujah amen
[30:00] it separated us from our sins or leaven
[30:03] his blood washed away all sins
[30:05] just as the jewish houses were washed
[30:07] free from all leaven
[30:08] amen he's the true bread of heaven
[30:11] all christians feast upon we're all
[30:13] feasting on
[30:15] unleavened bread tonight amen if you
[30:17] read that bible if you heard this bible
[30:19] and you believed it you're eating
[30:21] unleavened bread tonight
[30:23] amen because that's what paul said paul
[30:25] said that we keep the spiritual feasts
[30:27] not with old leaven
[30:29] neither with the leaven a mouse and
[30:30] wickedness see you can't eat jesus
[30:32] and have mouse and wickedness in your
[30:34] heart amen that's 11. but when you eat
[30:37] christ he's
[30:38] unleavened praise god and you won't have
[30:40] mouth you'll forgive
[30:42] and you won't do wickedness you live
[30:43] holy now we're feasting on unleavened
[30:46] bread praise god
[30:47] hallelujah that's feasting on christ the
[30:50] word
[30:51] amen see we but with the unleavened
[30:56] bread of sincerity
[30:58] and truth i'll tell you church sometimes
[31:01] i wish people could step in the place of
[31:02] a minister
[31:05] because i have to be deadly sincere like
[31:07] i don't know when people are going to
[31:08] come up for prayer
[31:09] like brother johnny came up for prayer
[31:11] he had an infection in his ankle
[31:13] on uh for last five days he didn't tell
[31:15] me he just come up for prayer now you
[31:17] talk about being sincere
[31:18] he's like just he said brother jesse we
[31:20] have faith just curse this infection and
[31:23] i'll be made well
[31:24] now brother william that made me really
[31:25] sincere right because i know people are
[31:28] struggling and can hardly walk for four
[31:30] or five days
[31:31] now he said after he went back to see he
[31:32] said he felt healed
[31:34] so praise the lord i haven't texted him
[31:36] this week but that's just an example of
[31:37] how i've really got to keep my sincerity
[31:40] that's why i can't eat on a sunday
[31:41] morning i know about you guys i mean
[31:43] that's fine for you
[31:44] but i've got to be sincere i've got to
[31:47] be deadly sincere
[31:48] the bible said keep this feast with
[31:50] sincerity and truth praise god
[31:53] i never know when people are going to
[31:54] come up here and have all these needs
[31:57] and
[31:57] i got really got to be sincere i really
[31:59] got to be honest and i i got a
[32:01] i got to mean business right i can't say
[32:04] oh mr devil could you please move sir
[32:06] could you please i you don't talk to
[32:08] devils like that
[32:10] you rebuke satan jesus rebuked him and
[32:12] said get behind me
[32:14] amen get thee behind hallelujah amen
[32:18] sincerity that's what i like to you know
[32:20] brother that's what i like to call
[32:22] sisters that's what i call i like to
[32:23] call some of you up to pray for people
[32:25] sometimes
[32:26] because it makes all of us more sincere
[32:29] because your prayers
[32:30] are just as powerful as mine are right
[32:33] now we might have different gifts
[32:34] but when we all pray together when we
[32:36] praise the body of believers
[32:37] oh heaven is moved praise god he
[32:40] delights in the prayers of the saints
[32:41] amen
[32:42] but see that when you're sincere and you
[32:45] come with a truthful heart to church
[32:47] you're keeping the feast of unleavened
[32:49] bread
[32:52] so you're not eating leavened bread
[32:53] you're not eating sinful things
[32:55] i'm not preaching sinful things tonight
[32:57] am i i don't believe so
[32:59] i'm not allowing you to uh to feast on
[33:02] the things of the world i'm
[33:04] not i'm not gonna allow you to be a
[33:05] worldly christian i'm not gonna allow
[33:07] myself to be a worldly christian i want
[33:09] us to all eat together amen
[33:11] the passover meal and the feast of
[33:13] unleavened bread let's feast
[33:14] on the holy things of god amen that's
[33:17] why we're here praise god
[33:20] it'll make you deadly sincere
[33:24] and then times and then i get tested too
[33:26] and people don't get well right away
[33:28] oh that's a real mind battle right there
[33:29] that's so that makes you even pray more
[33:31] during the week oh god
[33:32] help them lord you know give me patience
[33:36] right
[33:36] how many how many have the faith of
[33:37] abraham help me to wait 25 hours right
[33:41] he raided 25 years god helped me to wait
[33:43] 25 hours
[33:44] to get the victory i hope you understand
[33:47] i'm just talking
[33:48] realistic tonight praise god now the
[33:51] next one is the
[33:52] sheep of first fruits this is the final
[33:55] feast of the first month
[33:58] it was on the day after the sabbath
[34:00] following the passover so the third day
[34:02] after
[34:03] the third day you had passover
[34:04] unleavened bread and then you had
[34:06] first fruits a priest waved a sheaf like
[34:09] this
[34:09] a sheaf of barley first roots before the
[34:12] lord as a forerunner the rest of the
[34:15] crop would later mature for harvest
[34:18] also they had a lamb burnt offering did
[34:20] you know that
[34:22] a lamborgh offering a lamb had to be
[34:24] fully consecrated
[34:27] on the resurrection jesus was fully
[34:29] dedicated amen
[34:31] hallelujah a total burnt offering the
[34:34] lamb of god hallelujah
[34:35] ever lives to make intercession amen
[34:39] oh my and also a meal and drink offering
[34:44] so jesus christ also on his resurrection
[34:47] was a meal a thank offering
[34:49] and a drink offering as well oh
[34:52] hallelujah weren't they
[34:54] we're all thankful right they're all
[34:55] thankful on the resurrection day
[34:57] praise god now here
[35:00] this foreshadowed the resurrection of
[35:02] christ the greatest day
[35:04] in human history this was on the sunday
[35:08] the first day of the week the bible says
[35:10] this was fulfilled when god waved his
[35:13] resurrected son
[35:14] his first fruit son his resurrected son
[35:17] before israel as the firstborn from the
[35:20] dead
[35:21] jesus christ is the first begotten from
[35:24] the dead amen
[35:25] this is the first matter of harley
[35:29] from the seed first god and god wave
[35:31] jesus amen
[35:33] god wave jesus he's the first fruit is
[35:35] god
[35:36] he's the first fruits from the dead god
[35:38] waiting before
[35:39] israel hallelujah
[35:43] and this demonstrates all believers
[35:45] would have a resurrection
[35:47] at harvest time or the end of the world
[35:50] romans 8 11 promises us that the spirit
[35:52] that raised christ from the dead
[35:53] will quicken also our mortal bodies
[35:56] but the bible says notice we're raised
[35:59] from the dead in his own order
[36:02] everybody's got a different order praise
[36:04] god we don't like weight in church
[36:06] but listen everybody's got to order we
[36:08] can't all be like enoch right we can't
[36:09] all be like elijah
[36:11] everybody's got to order they've got to
[36:13] be raising so let's be thankful as long
[36:15] as i'm somewhere in that order
[36:17] it don't matter to me as long as i'm in
[36:19] there somewhere i want to have an order
[36:22] where i'm resurrected to life amen
[36:25] how today i'm resurrected to sit with
[36:27] christ in his throne amen
[36:30] in that order don't worry about your
[36:33] order just worry about having the life
[36:34] of christ in you praise god
[36:36] that's the main thing make sure you're
[36:38] really uh a mature christian praise god
[36:40] that's the main thing
[36:43] now the wave sheath and the other
[36:45] offering speak of his death and
[36:47] resurrection
[36:48] because they're inseparable like all
[36:49] these had to be on that that
[36:51] that sunday or that monday i'm sorry
[36:53] that sunday rather that first day of the
[36:54] week
[36:55] so the burn offering represents jesus's
[36:57] death through total obedience and also
[37:00] his constant total consecration in life
[37:02] and the meal offering and drink offering
[37:04] speak of their continual communion with
[37:06] christ
[37:06] through the lord's supper right because
[37:09] didn't he show up
[37:10] on that sunday night didn't he show up
[37:11] with his disciples he broke into the
[37:13] room
[37:13] and he proved he said give me something
[37:15] to eat give me something to drink right
[37:17] there he is there's the drink offering
[37:18] there's a thank offering there he is
[37:20] right communing with the people oh i'm
[37:22] so glad he communes with us as well
[37:25] amen in the holy spirit
[37:29] now here we are feast of weeks now we'll
[37:31] get to here and i'm good
[37:32] i'm doing good on time praise god now we
[37:35] skip ahead to the feast of weeks this is
[37:37] the third month
[37:38] or 50 days after
[37:42] uh first fruits now in feast of the
[37:43] trumpets brother ram this is the one
[37:45] time he says there's mix-up on the tapes
[37:47] he said this was uh he said this was
[37:49] seven months but it was seven weeks
[37:52] so if you listen carefully brother ram
[37:54] even fixes it later in questions and
[37:56] answers
[37:56] in 1964. but he said see it's seven
[38:00] it's seven he said it's seven months
[38:01] representing seven church
[38:04] changes and so he said i got a little
[38:06] mix up he said
[38:07] i'll probably hear about it he said but
[38:09] remember he said look in the bible
[38:11] amen hallelujah but great advice from a
[38:14] prophet of god i make mistakes
[38:16] there's mix-ups on the tapes but there's
[38:18] no mix-ups in the bible praise god
[38:21] amen and i was thinking more the more i
[38:24] thought about it johnny's statement on
[38:25] sunday the more i liked it
[38:29] you know i asked the jeffersonville
[38:31] people all these questions they have no
[38:32] answers
[38:32] and it's just like the pharisees jesus
[38:36] they said jesus uh i forgot their
[38:38] question they asked jesus do you guys
[38:39] remember
[38:39] but jesus said well let me ask you a
[38:41] question was john's baptism of men
[38:43] or was it from god and they said we
[38:46] can't tell
[38:48] right we can't tell so jesus said
[38:50] neither or do i tell you what you asked
[38:51] me
[38:53] that's the same thing i asked i asked
[38:54] joseph uh does the third person the
[38:56] trinity dwell in your hearts he
[38:57] basically said i believe every word on
[38:58] the tape is thus saith the lord
[39:00] in other words i can't tell well i can
[39:02] tell
[39:03] the third person a third god does not
[39:06] dwell in william
[39:07] the one god dwells in brother william
[39:09] amen
[39:10] there's not three gods there's not three
[39:12] persons there's one person
[39:13] the holy person the holy spirit praise
[39:16] god
[39:16] amen i can tell you the answer to that
[39:18] one
[39:20] but they can't tell you the answers
[39:21] because they don't have them
[39:23] because they're deceived the bible says
[39:25] you're deceived right
[39:27] because we worship in spirit and in
[39:29] truth they don't have truth they don't
[39:31] even know what the truth is
[39:32] right they have some truth but not all
[39:34] truth we should be guided into all truth
[39:37] by the holy spirit
[39:39] hallelujah some guy tried to correct me
[39:41] on the youtube yesterday and he said
[39:43] well brother you shouldn't call names
[39:44] like that uh
[39:47] brother brahm never called church names
[39:48] they never called names i said brother
[39:50] have you ever heard of brother brock and
[39:52] brother gilmore brother branham balls
[39:54] them out they were pastors in arizona
[39:57] brother branham balled them out he said
[39:58] i he said nothing against you
[40:00] he said but your churches are
[40:02] denominated and he names the name of
[40:04] their churches
[40:05] the first assembly of god and family
[40:08] assembly of god brother random names
[40:10] their church names
[40:11] on the tape and i said my dear brother i
[40:14] hope you'll look this up
[40:15] but brother random when he was led by
[40:17] the holy spirit he called names
[40:19] to try to bring some correction praise
[40:21] god and the bible said mark them that
[40:24] cause divisions praise god
[40:26] who's been causing division since 2001
[40:29] with here i stand
[40:30] it's jeffersonville they've been causing
[40:32] they've dividing people well
[40:34] you can print tapes and you can't
[40:36] they've been dividing since truth at
[40:37] least 2001
[40:38] and now they're dividing if you don't
[40:40] play tapes you're not the royal seat of
[40:41] abraham let me tell you you are not the
[40:43] judge
[40:44] of who the royal seat of abraham the
[40:46] holy spirit is the judge
[40:47] of who is the royal seat of abraham and
[40:50] the holy spirit vindicates their word
[40:52] with truth amen and they've got answers
[40:54] and they're guided into all truth and
[40:56] they've got the real holy spirit praise
[40:58] god
[40:59] not lies yeah
[41:02] i'd probably say the same thing brother
[41:03] william i probably say the same well if
[41:05] i
[41:06] if i was deceived i'd say the same thing
[41:08] well i don't know you know why because
[41:09] millions of dollars are being funneled
[41:11] into me
[41:13] that's what it's all about always money
[41:16] why the pharisees get upset
[41:17] because jesus was going to shut down
[41:19] their denomination they're going to lose
[41:21] their
[41:22] income they're going to use their lose
[41:24] their paychecks
[41:25] they're going to lose their retirement
[41:27] funds oh yeah it's all connected it's
[41:29] all connected to money
[41:31] it's always connected to money
[41:34] now god knows our hearts tried to
[41:37] correct we've asked for all these things
[41:39] god knows our hearts i just i didn't
[41:40] that wasn't that was not my notes
[41:42] but just as a representation you know a
[41:44] lot of people need that church there's a
[41:45] lot of people struggling with that right
[41:48] there's a lot of people
[41:49] that for whatever reason brother william
[41:51] they just don't have much discernment
[41:53] that means they're still out there in
[41:55] the wilderness
[41:56] they haven't entered into all these
[41:58] battles in the promised land praise god
[42:00] they can't handle this good mature corn
[42:04] yeah amen hallelujah they don't really
[42:06] want to see they don't want to fight
[42:07] amen
[42:08] but we're fighters amen hallelujah we're
[42:11] warriors
[42:12] we can hold the sword of the land we're
[42:14] not as scared of a spiritual battle
[42:16] because greater is he that's in me than
[42:18] he that's in the world praise god
[42:21] amen hallelujah
[42:25] we're not some complaining babies out in
[42:27] the wilderness got to baby them to come
[42:29] to church and baby
[42:30] them to pray and read their bible baby
[42:31] them to study the doctrine
[42:33] and baby them to search the scriptures
[42:34] you don't gotta baby us we're already
[42:36] fighting for it
[42:37] we're fighting for it every day praise
[42:39] god hallelujah
[42:41] we're on the front lines every single
[42:43] day
[42:44] amen
[42:49] let's not be babies right let's be
[42:50] mature warriors
[42:53] oh thank you jesus praise god
[42:57] now pentecost or feast of weeks third
[43:00] month
[43:01] it was 50 days after first fruits
[43:04] 50 represents deliverance liberty
[43:07] freedom
[43:08] for israel because every 50 years they
[43:10] celebrated the jubilee year
[43:12] slaves were released from bondage debts
[43:15] and all inheritance were restored
[43:17] to their original owners all that's
[43:20] forgiven every 50 years oh my goodness
[43:23] i wish that was in my life right i was i
[43:25] wish the dead of my house would be would
[43:26] be all taken away
[43:28] well the difference is i didn't have the
[43:29] house in my family beforehand so it
[43:31] actually doesn't fit that type
[43:34] right you had to already be in your
[43:35] family for you to inherit it and
[43:37] be forgiven of the debt right so it
[43:38] don't really fit for us today
[43:40] it's not the same system now moses
[43:42] brought israel out on
[43:44] following the passover and they
[43:45] worshiped god at mount sinai did you
[43:48] know this
[43:48] they went to mount sinai and they were
[43:50] there on the 50th day
[43:52] after the passover did you know that
[43:55] what would they get what are they gonna
[43:57] sign it they got the law
[44:00] what happened at pentecost they got the
[44:02] law of the holy ghost
[44:05] right so is mount sinai and day of
[44:07] pentecost
[44:08] are both 50 days after an exodus
[44:12] hallelujah so there was there was
[44:15] lightning and thunder and black cloud
[44:18] and noise and fire at mount sinai there
[44:21] was wind
[44:22] of the holy ghost they were speaking in
[44:24] tongues there was fire
[44:26] on the day of pentecost because god's
[44:28] spiritual law was being brought down to
[44:30] earth amen
[44:31] not in law but in liberty praise god
[44:34] amen
[44:35] hallelujah i'm so glad that fire's
[44:38] inside of me praise god
[44:40] amen hallelujah
[44:43] see there the fire was outside now for
[44:45] us the fire's inside
[44:48] oh thank you jesus
[44:52] 50 days power
[44:55] and the presence of god undeniable
[44:59] they got the 10 commandments we got the
[45:01] holy ghost written upon the fleshy
[45:02] tables of our hearts
[45:05] hallelujah we got the word on our hearts
[45:08] amen
[45:09] they got it on the stones
[45:13] now once they got into canaan at
[45:15] pentecost
[45:16] they had numerous sacrifices they had
[45:19] two
[45:20] loaves of bread bake with leaven we'll
[45:22] get to that a little bit
[45:23] way before the lord and then they
[45:25] brought the following
[45:27] free will gifts this was the feast
[45:31] of bringing free will gifts
[45:35] right so whatever you want to give in
[45:37] your free
[45:39] will whatever you want to give god from
[45:43] your heart
[45:43] you bring it during this feast this is
[45:46] the long feast
[45:48] so bring any of these free will
[45:50] offerings
[45:52] burnt offering meat offering drink
[45:55] offering sin and peace offerings
[45:57] so god said bring any of those any of
[46:00] the sacrifices
[46:02] and bring them at the feast of pentecost
[46:05] bring anything from your heart whatever
[46:07] you want to give god from your heart
[46:09] bring it ah church anything we want to
[46:13] give
[46:14] god let's give to god amen this is the
[46:16] time to do it praise god
[46:18] this is the time to pour out our hearts
[46:20] a parole of thanksgiving
[46:21] to make ourselves a burnt offering for
[46:23] christ amen
[46:25] this is our time to do it whatever the
[46:27] free will is praise god
[46:31] remember god will bless you according to
[46:33] your free will offerings
[46:35] people say oh i'm always short on money
[46:38] because you're not giving enough away
[46:40] right the reason you're lacking is
[46:43] because you're
[46:44] you're keeping too much and you're not
[46:45] giving away because if you give
[46:47] god loves a cheerful giver and he's a
[46:49] rewarder
[46:51] of those who diligently seek god
[46:54] so if you if you're tied on money many
[46:55] times too selfish
[46:59] it's free will offering absolutely
[47:05] see so this feast marks the beginning of
[47:08] a four
[47:09] month long harvest one two three four
[47:13] four and there's four beasts i just
[47:14] caught that brother
[47:16] there's four beasts four anointings oh
[47:18] my goodness gracious
[47:21] that's a good one i remember that one
[47:24] four
[47:25] four months there's four anointings amen
[47:29] and the last one's the ego praise god oh
[47:31] my four months
[47:34] thank you jesus see and
[47:38] it was to harvest most but not all the
[47:41] crops
[47:42] because the poor and the stranger have
[47:44] to have a little bit of food
[47:47] don't harvest everything leave a little
[47:49] left over
[47:50] so the strangers make sure there's a
[47:52] little bit of of wheat left
[47:55] over at the end for strangers and
[47:57] sojourners
[47:58] so everybody can find a little bit of
[47:59] wheat
[48:02] hallelujah i'm glad praise god now acts
[48:05] chapter 2 fulfills the feast of weeks
[48:08] the day of pentecost this was spiritual
[48:11] freedom
[48:12] spiritual liberty for the souls of men
[48:15] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[48:17] jesus said go away in uh jerusalem until
[48:20] you're endued
[48:21] with power he said you shall be baptized
[48:23] with the holy ghost
[48:24] not many days hence you shall you shall
[48:26] receive power
[48:28] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[48:29] you do you feel the power
[48:31] you ought to have power in your soul if
[48:34] you've been to pentecost
[48:36] if you've been in the feast of weeks
[48:37] you've got power in your soul amen
[48:40] hallelujah you you know god is with you
[48:42] you've got authority praise god
[48:44] because he's living inside of you oh
[48:47] hallelujah

[49:41] hopefully the next time they're sick
[49:42] they'll remember that testimony
[49:46] now here let me show you
[49:49] uh kevin connor has a list he has a
[49:52] chart with two columns in his book
[49:54] showing the similarities between mount
[49:56] sinai and the
[49:57] day of pentecost the upper room so at
[50:00] sinai
[50:01] they have thunder lightnings thick
[50:02] clouds fire audible voice
[50:04] at pentecost they're the prince of god
[50:06] rushing mighty wind licks of fire
[50:08] speaking in tongues mount sinai
[50:12] had of the 50th day right and then mount
[50:15] uh and then the pentecost was near mount
[50:18] zion on the 50th day it wasn't on mount
[50:21] zion but it's near mount
[50:22] so both of them were near mountains uh
[50:25] at
[50:26] at mount sinai it was the birthday of
[50:28] judaism it was the birth of the old
[50:30] covenant
[50:31] at the day of pentecost it was the
[50:33] church's birthday praise god
[50:36] the holy spirit got sprinkled they were
[50:38] enjoying to the covenant
[50:40] through the anointing of the holy spirit
[50:42] praise god hey i'm so glad i'm joined to
[50:44] that covenant amen
[50:46] he sprinkled me and he's filled me with
[50:48] this anointing praise god
[50:50] amen hallelujah i'm not outside the
[50:52] covenant
[50:53] i'm joined to the covenant i'm sprinkled
[50:56] with the anointing
[50:57] it's upon me i see it upon me praise god
[50:59] you see it on you we ought to be
[51:01] thankful
[51:02] we have a part of an everlasting
[51:03] covenant praise god
[51:07] they have the laws of stone written by
[51:10] the finger of god
[51:11] we have the word on fleshy tables hearts
[51:14] written by the spirit of god
[51:18] hallelujah at sinai
[51:21] 000 souls died at pentecost 3 000 souls
[51:25] were baptized amen
[51:29] on at sinai it was the ministration of
[51:33] death through the law of sin and death
[51:37] on the day of pentecost it was the
[51:38] ministration of life
[51:40] through the law of the holy spirit
[51:45] at sinai the glory was on moses's face
[51:49] at pentecost the glory of god they saw
[51:51] the glory of god
[51:52] in the face of jesus christ the bible
[51:55] says amen
[51:56] hallelujah in other words the holy
[51:58] spirit
[52:01] at sinai moses's face veiled the people
[52:04] so they could not see the glory at
[52:07] pentecost the believers have
[52:08] unveiled faces to be changed into the
[52:11] same glory of christ
[52:14] see he veiled it but now ours are
[52:16] unveiled and now you see the anointing
[52:17] of god on our faces
[52:19] didn't stephen have a face like an angel
[52:24] glory church when we're under that
[52:25] anointing our faces look different
[52:28] praise god
[52:36] at sinai the glory was to be done away
[52:38] with and at pentecost the glory
[52:41] remains and that's all from
[52:44] second corinthians chapter three i
[52:46] preached on that a few weeks ago
[52:48] i preached on that what was i preaching
[52:49] on though now i'm gonna quiz myself here
[52:53] what was i preaching on it
[52:58] i can't remember forgive me
[53:02] something i was building i'd use that as
[53:03] a start
[53:04] [Music]
[53:07] some thought can't remember that oh from
[53:09] glory to glory there it is thank you
[53:10] jesus thank you
[53:11] because at the end it says we go from
[53:12] glory to glory right
[53:15] that's that's the chapter talks about
[53:16] moses and the old testament now we have
[53:18] the new testament
[53:19] uh glory okay let me try to finish up
[53:21] here by god's grace
[53:23] now when i say that that means 15
[53:25] minutes okay right so i think i think
[53:27] i'll figure that out on sunday
[53:29] okay so give me 15 more minutes now
[53:32] the most unique aspect of this feast
[53:35] compared to the first three
[53:37] was now they're waving 11
[53:41] infused loaves of bread
[53:44] and this is the revelation of the jew
[53:48] gentile church composing
[53:51] one body did you see that how
[53:55] these two loaves were a new meat
[53:58] offering unto the lord in the previous
[54:02] three they never had a meat offering
[54:04] like this
[54:05] now you can have the leaven in the bread
[54:09] and the gu and god was waving two loaves
[54:11] before the people
[54:12] before it was the priest waving one
[54:15] right
[54:16] just waving uh seeds right seed mature
[54:19] seed
[54:20] but now you have seed that's been ground
[54:23] up
[54:23] right mature seed ground up and infused
[54:26] with sin
[54:27] i mean leaven
[54:30] now you have genuine wheat seed infused
[54:34] with sin that ought to sound pretty
[54:36] familiar to us right
[54:38] you have the deity of god i mean the
[54:40] weed of god
[54:41] plus the sin or leaven of the world
[54:45] mixed together and god is waving two
[54:48] loaves that are identical
[54:50] god's waving both of them before the
[54:53] people saying this is a new feast
[54:55] i'm doing something new praise god amen
[54:58] there's a season where uh the bread of
[55:01] god
[55:02] is infused with leaven it's the longest
[55:05] season of the year praise god
[55:07] and i'm doing something new praise god
[55:12] these two loaves are actually called one
[55:15] offering brother william
[55:18] these they weren't called two offerings
[55:20] it was one offering
[55:21] two loaves have become one offering
[55:25] two people have become one body
[55:28] jew gentile two groups have become one
[55:31] body
[55:33] paul says this first corinthians 10 17
[55:36] if you haven't read this it works really
[55:38] it's beautiful it just ties in perfectly
[55:40] i'll read it to you he says
[55:42] for we being many are one
[55:45] bread it's one offering
[55:49] he's speaking to corinthians though
[55:51] which are gentiles
[55:52] but he said we are one bread
[55:56] and one body for we are all partakers of
[56:01] that one
[56:02] bread hallelujah and again paul says
[56:06] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[56:09] even the law of commandments containing
[56:11] ordinances for to make himself of twain
[56:14] one new man
[56:15] so making peace he takes two men and
[56:19] brings them together and fuses them
[56:20] together
[56:21] and makes one man
[56:25] so when the priest waved two loaves of
[56:27] israel he foretold god waving
[56:30] both spirit-filled jews and gentiles
[56:33] before the world
[56:36] the first loaf was waived was the 120
[56:39] born-again jewish christians
[56:41] on the day of pentecost now remember
[56:45] these were jews from gentile nations
[56:47] right
[56:48] right and samaritans now they count as
[56:51] gentiles right because the jews would
[56:52] have nothing to do with them because
[56:53] they were half jew
[56:54] they weren't whole jews
[56:57] right so the holy ghost fell on jews and
[56:59] the holy ghost fell on gentiles
[57:00] samaritans
[57:02] see so god was waving both jew and
[57:05] gentile
[57:05] he was waving them before the people
[57:08] these are two separate loaves but it's
[57:10] one offering it's one body praise god
[57:14] they are the same substance is that
[57:17] right church how many believe you're the
[57:19] same substance as peter
[57:21] well i heard a three amends oh now it's
[57:22] pretty good
[57:24] you're the same peter said to the lame
[57:26] man rise up and walk in the name of
[57:28] jesus christ are we the same substance
[57:30] oh yeah when it's god's time to do it
[57:31] praise god when it's god's time to heal
[57:34] we are the same substance did peter
[57:36] discriminate
[57:37] yeah even after he had the holy ghost
[57:40] there's that 11 coming out of him right
[57:42] sometimes 11 is seen in our lives right
[57:44] it's obvious well he's got 11.
[57:46] brother jesse's not perfect he makes
[57:47] mistakes that's that's true i i've
[57:49] leaven infused in me but i also got
[57:50] wheat infused in me
[57:52] don't forget i got weak too you've got
[57:54] wheat too you might have some lemon but
[57:56] thank god you got weed praise god amen
[57:59] thank god you're a genuine original seed
[58:01] of god amen
[58:03] hallelujah which eleven and boy i'd
[58:06] really like to get the leaven out of
[58:07] this bread brother william
[58:08] but ain't gonna happen to the rapture
[58:11] when i get a new body praise god
[58:13] because that lemon's gonna be swallowed
[58:14] up and unleavened
[58:16] in unleavened nature amen hallelujah
[58:20] thank god this is
[58:24] called new because before leaven was
[58:26] forbidden
[58:27] and you're excommunicated if you had
[58:29] leaven before
[58:32] all the other feasts no leaven no lemon
[58:33] you're crazy if you have 11. now it's
[58:35] 11's okay
[58:36] 11 is part of the plan of god 11 infused
[58:39] church is what i'm gonna weigh
[58:40] before the people i'm gonna be glorified
[58:43] in two loaves
[58:44] i'm gonna be glorifying the jews i'm
[58:46] gonna be glorified the gentiles despite
[58:48] their shortcomings
[58:50] jesus christ died to save me and then
[58:53] take me as a witness and weigh me before
[58:55] acronym
[58:57] waive him for my family weigh me as a
[58:59] sacrifice
[59:00] i'm part of the body of christ amen
[59:03] god's waving you before your family
[59:05] that don't believe that don't have the
[59:07] baptism holy ghost he's waving you in
[59:09] your leaven condition
[59:11] oh thank god he forgives us amen thank
[59:14] god we have weed inside of us
[59:16] thank god for his mercy it's his choice
[59:18] to wave us before the people not ours
[59:21] it's his amen these are his feasts
[59:24] not ours i didn't ask to come to this
[59:26] message by the way
[59:27] message came and got me praise god
[59:32] you turned in to ask for it you were
[59:33] born into it
[59:35] because god wanted god wanted you in it
[59:37] praise god
[59:38] so don't leave it stay with it praise
[59:41] god it's the greatest thing that ever
[59:42] happened to you
[59:44] wait till you get older you'll see it
[59:45] when you start meeting somebody
[59:46] literally starting to meet some friends
[59:47] over there at her job
[59:48] she's seeing people that uh weren't born
[59:50] into the holiness of god right lydia
[59:53] cussing and swearing and throwing apples
[59:55] at each other and all kinds of evil
[59:56] teenagers stuff you know it's teenager
[59:58] stuff
[59:59] but lydia don't partake in that because
[1:00:02] she's a different breed
[1:00:04] she's a different kind of seed she's a
[1:00:07] weed seed amen
[1:00:09] she got a little bit of lemon in there
[1:00:10] right but she she got a lot of wheat in
[1:00:12] there too praise god
[1:00:14] hallelujah it's a new offering before
[1:00:18] no leaven now leaven is what i'm waving
[1:00:21] before the people
[1:00:22] wheat and leaven before the people
[1:00:27] before you're excommunicated no leaven
[1:00:30] because i was speaking of christ
[1:00:31] christ had no sin christ nobody who's
[1:00:34] worthy to loose the seals nobody
[1:00:36] no laughing amen hallelujah no there's
[1:00:39] no never allowed
[1:00:40] whoever looses that book you've got to
[1:00:42] have no leaven
[1:00:43] and john's crying and everybody's crying
[1:00:46] everybody's weeping
[1:00:46] everybody's searching who where is there
[1:00:48] no leaven and all of a sudden the lamb
[1:00:50] steps out
[1:00:51] no leaven praise god the unleavened lamb
[1:00:54] praise god
[1:00:55] he steps out he's worthy to take the
[1:00:58] seals
[1:00:58] and loose them thereof praise god the
[1:01:01] man with no leaven
[1:01:04] the unleavened lamb i can say it like
[1:01:06] that i have area
[1:01:09] he was worthy that's the one they were
[1:01:12] looking for
[1:01:13] i said like that that's one i'll say
[1:01:14] like this that's one we're looking for
[1:01:16] he's coming back in the clouds the
[1:01:19] unleavened lamb is coming back praise
[1:01:22] god
[1:01:25] so see these two loaves with leaven
[1:01:29] represent
[1:01:29] the new testament church we have a sin
[1:01:32] nature
[1:01:35] combined with a divine nature now church
[1:01:38] we
[1:01:38] sin but if you got your bible go to
[1:01:40] romans 6 14.
[1:01:43] i'll try to get there as soon as i can
[1:01:46] church we sin but here's the real
[1:01:49] proof you're a holy ghost-filled saint
[1:01:51] romans 6
[1:01:53] 4 no 14 yeah i'm sorry i'm going too
[1:01:56] fast
[1:01:58] here's the difference here's how you
[1:01:59] know you're born again it's just another
[1:02:01] one of those
[1:02:02] just piled onto one of your evidence
[1:02:03] scriptures
[1:02:05] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:02:07] for you are not under the law
[1:02:08] but under grace you have 11 inside of
[1:02:12] you but it does not
[1:02:13] dominate your life church i know what
[1:02:16] it's like to be dominated
[1:02:17] by drugs i know what it's like i was
[1:02:20] there
[1:02:21] i know what it's like to be dominated by
[1:02:23] cussing and dirty shows and sports and
[1:02:25] worshipping
[1:02:26] and hatred i know what it's like to be
[1:02:27] dominated but i'm no longer dominated by
[1:02:29] that
[1:02:30] the holy ghost dominates that
[1:02:34] we're still going to have leaven but
[1:02:36] that leaven will not
[1:02:37] reign over us we will reign over that
[1:02:39] praise god
[1:02:41] amen we will have dominion in other
[1:02:43] words christ will shortly
[1:02:45] put the serpent under our feet praise
[1:02:47] god the devil will shortly bruise
[1:02:50] under your feet don't be a slave to sin
[1:02:52] overcome
[1:02:53] a sin be a slave to christ amen
[1:02:58] that's a real proof you got the holy
[1:02:59] ghost sin does not rule
[1:03:02] our lives
[1:03:05] like let me just say this a few years
[1:03:06] ago we had brothers coming younger
[1:03:07] brothers that have now left and fallen
[1:03:09] away
[1:03:09] well you know what you know what ruled
[1:03:10] their life marijuana ruled their life
[1:03:14] it would keep them from coming to church
[1:03:16] uh they couldn't sleep because of
[1:03:18] marijuana they couldn't eat as much
[1:03:19] because of marijuana
[1:03:21] that had dominion but see we have
[1:03:23] dominion over that
[1:03:25] that doesn't impact us right that
[1:03:26] doesn't that that marijuana and when
[1:03:28] they
[1:03:29] smoked it determined everything they
[1:03:31] could do work and
[1:03:32] in church or not and then uh how much
[1:03:34] they ate and they got hungry
[1:03:36] and that that rule that basically that
[1:03:38] demon ruled their life that's witchcraft
[1:03:42] oh any administration of drugs is
[1:03:44] witchcraft
[1:03:45] so i don't know if they played a ouija
[1:03:46] board i don't know if they went to
[1:03:47] finger or
[1:03:48] tarrot car people or what but it's a
[1:03:49] form of witchcraft
[1:03:51] but see that had dominion and it ruled
[1:03:53] their lives and can't keep jobs and
[1:03:55] can't keep relationships but see the
[1:03:57] holy ghost in our lives
[1:03:59] rules and has dominion over all this
[1:04:01] leaven amen
[1:04:02] and so we have steady relationships we
[1:04:04] have we have steady church attendance
[1:04:06] we're steady on the job nobody's steady
[1:04:09] like a christian praise god
[1:04:11] because he is the holy ghost has
[1:04:13] dominion over his life amen
[1:04:15] hallelujah that's just a common example
[1:04:19] sin shall not have dominion over you i
[1:04:22] can point at each one of you
[1:04:24] sin will not have dominion over you the
[1:04:27] leaven won't dominate your life
[1:04:29] the wheat will dominate your life
[1:04:31] because your bread
[1:04:33] hallelujah your one bread
[1:04:37] see our daily lives are dominated by the
[1:04:39] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:42] see you present and give your lives as
[1:04:44] offerings unto god
[1:04:48] during this new testament season this
[1:04:50] four month
[1:04:51] long season this four beasts long season
[1:04:55] can i say like that that's glorious
[1:04:59] hallelujah i feel some stimulation
[1:05:01] revelation tonight
[1:05:02] amen the joy of the lord praise god
[1:05:06] that's what brother said it was amen the
[1:05:09] joy of the lord amen i love when the
[1:05:11] bible opens up like that
[1:05:12] oh that's beautiful praise god and
[1:05:14] brother said those beasts are thus saith
[1:05:16] the lord
[1:05:16] you know he said that they are thus
[1:05:18] saith the lord that means it's thus
[1:05:20] saith the lord we are flying
[1:05:22] with the eagle anointing above the cares
[1:05:24] of the world
[1:05:25] the cares of the world will not bring us
[1:05:27] down i could care less
[1:05:30] i'm an eagle i can fly way above that
[1:05:32] praise god
[1:05:33] i'm an eagle i'm anointed to do that
[1:05:36] praise god
[1:05:37] i've got power to do that amen that's
[1:05:39] thus saith the lord we've got that power
[1:05:42] let's tap into that power let's live
[1:05:44] above these things
[1:05:47] sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:05:50] eagle
[1:05:51] and you ain't just an eagle you're a
[1:05:52] flying eagle i don't know
[1:05:55] so start flying eagles don't let sin
[1:05:58] have dominion over you
[1:06:00] have dominion over it
[1:06:05] some things i want to say man maybe i
[1:06:08] better save them
[1:06:10] just kind of want to do some rebuking
[1:06:11] but i think i hold off on that one
[1:06:13] i better hold off because the time
[1:06:18] church so leaven is a common
[1:06:20] representation of evil and sin
[1:06:23] see we are new creatures just like it
[1:06:25] was a new
[1:06:26] me offering the bible says we're new
[1:06:29] creatures
[1:06:30] yet paul says sin dwells in my
[1:06:33] members so i've got
[1:06:37] sin in here but i've also got christ in
[1:06:40] here
[1:06:41] i've got two different natures in here
[1:06:44] i've got leaven and i've got wheat
[1:06:49] right and the scripture says
[1:06:54] paul is as bold to i'm sorry john is so
[1:06:57] bold to say
[1:06:58] whosoever is born of god
[1:07:01] does not commit sin
[1:07:05] think about that for his seed remaineth
[1:07:08] in him
[1:07:09] his wheat remains in him
[1:07:13] so god's not looking at the leaven god's
[1:07:16] looking at the wheat
[1:07:18] the seed the seed doesn't sin the seed's
[1:07:21] not leaven
[1:07:22] god's not looking at the leaven the
[1:07:24] leaven just makes it the size it is
[1:07:26] right
[1:07:27] god's looking at the seed john goes so
[1:07:29] far to say
[1:07:30] don't be discouraged about the leaven
[1:07:32] just confess 11 11. it doesn't have a
[1:07:34] big
[1:07:34] dominion over you
[1:07:38] it's not a big real it's not a real big
[1:07:40] feature in your life right it's not a
[1:07:42] big uh
[1:07:43] it's not a big problem because i've got
[1:07:45] wheat inside of me
[1:07:46] i've got christ inside of me the seed of
[1:07:48] god dominates my life amen
[1:07:51] my life is dominated by obedience my
[1:07:54] life's not dominated by disobedience and
[1:07:57] and sinfulness my life is dominated not
[1:07:59] with mouse and wickedness
[1:08:01] but with sincerity and truth praise god
[1:08:05] see that that's what you're dominated by
[1:08:09] being a sincere truthful christian
[1:08:15] john says that's the real you the wheat
[1:08:17] is you
[1:08:19] the leaven was added for a testimony
[1:08:25] the leaven was added for a witness
[1:08:28] unto all people right
[1:08:32] you would never be unleavened like
[1:08:33] christ because that was a special
[1:08:34] one-time offering
[1:08:36] less standard our feet i better stop
[1:08:37] right there that's my 15 minutes i'm
[1:08:39] closing
[1:08:44] christ's church will always have an
[1:08:45] element of sin
[1:08:47] but we're given the holy ghost
[1:08:50] to bring unity to other christians
[1:08:55] through the power of the spirit the
[1:08:57] power of the seed
[1:09:00] i love what schofield says let me read
[1:09:01] this scofield talks about the two loaves
[1:09:05] here's what he says observe it is now
[1:09:09] loaves not a sheaf of separate gross
[1:09:14] loosely bound together so at first
[1:09:16] fruits it was just a sheaf of loosely
[1:09:18] bound seeds right
[1:09:19] on the stalks they're loosely bound
[1:09:22] he said now it's loaves but now it's a
[1:09:26] real union of particles
[1:09:29] making one homogeneous body that's why
[1:09:32] william
[1:09:33] can fly a thousand miles over here and
[1:09:36] he's one with us
[1:09:38] because it doesn't matter the distance
[1:09:40] we're all one body praise god
[1:09:42] he can amen one day over there two days
[1:09:44] later he can amen
[1:09:46] and shout and sing and give god praise
[1:09:48] right here because we are
[1:09:49] one real unified body
[1:09:53] amen that's why in one day i can fly
[1:09:56] down to south america because i get
[1:09:58] there within
[1:09:58] six or eight hours and i can preach and
[1:10:01] the power of the holy ghost can fall
[1:10:03] there
[1:10:03] just like it falls here and they ha
[1:10:07] they talk english brother but i can
[1:10:08] hardly understand them it's just like
[1:10:09] it's like it's like spanish to me i
[1:10:11] can't understand
[1:10:12] but they can understand me well i don't
[1:10:13] need an interpreter down there you know
[1:10:15] but we can we can cross those lines
[1:10:17] because we're no longer separate
[1:10:19] particles we are all one body
[1:10:25] he said the descent of the spirit at
[1:10:27] pentecost
[1:10:28] united the separated disciples into one
[1:10:31] organism
[1:10:34] at pentecost god united the souls of
[1:10:36] christians through the baptism of the
[1:10:37] holy ghost
[1:10:38] causing them to have one heart and
[1:10:41] one soul
[1:10:46] and this same unity spread to the
[1:10:47] samaritans and then it spread to
[1:10:49] corniness
[1:10:50] and when they brought back news of the
[1:10:51] gentiles they get the holy ghost they
[1:10:53] acted the same way they said praise the
[1:10:55] lord
[1:10:56] we're all one body we're all one
[1:10:59] substance
[1:11:00] we're not all separate particles we're
[1:11:01] all one musicians you can come
[1:11:05] church that's why i can come to church

[1:11:12] the people of god
[1:11:14] i know without you i'm incomplete
[1:11:17] and i know without me you're incomplete
[1:11:20] we're one body
[1:11:22] we can't move on without each other we
[1:11:24] can't grow more in love with god without
[1:11:27] each other
[1:11:28] like it or not we're stuck together amen
[1:11:32] like it or not we're baked together

[1:11:45] i want to stay one with all of god's
[1:11:47] people
[1:11:50] that's why we don't have separate
[1:11:51] agendas when we come to church we all
[1:11:52] got one one agenda to see christ exalted
[1:11:56] to see christ have dominion in your life

[1:12:16] what revenge what
[1:12:17] zeal and you'll cast down everything
