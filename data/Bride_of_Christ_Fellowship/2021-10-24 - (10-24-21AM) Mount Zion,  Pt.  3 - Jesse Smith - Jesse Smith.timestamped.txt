[38:36] so again we just give greetings to
[38:37] everybody in the name of the lord jesus
[38:38] christ we appreciate your love and your
[38:40] prayers
[38:41] and the fellowship of the saints praise
[38:43] god matthew 13 verse 30.
[39:00] now why this types here we see a unity
[39:03] right we see the gathering of the wheat
[39:05] into the barn
[39:07] so this is what we see we see when david
[39:09] takes mount zion he has all israel
[39:12] gathered unto him
[39:13] remember that word jebus also means
[39:16] threshing floor
[39:18] the place where wheat is gathered praise
[39:20] god so it's a beautiful type and we're
[39:23] so thankful that god has revealed it to
[39:24] us praise god so let's read this
[39:26] scripture together
[39:27] and then we'll do the memory verse and
[39:28] have you be seated here
[39:30] matthew 13 verse 30 let's read that on
[39:32] three one two three let both grow
[39:35] together until the harvest and in the
[39:38] time of harvest i will say to the
[39:40] reapers gather ye together first the
[39:43] tares and bind them in bundles to burn
[39:46] them but gather the wheat into my barn
[39:49] praise god philippians
[39:51] chapter 4 i believe let's go there verse
[39:52] 2 philippians 4 verse 2.
[40:06] i'm sorry philippians 2 rather verse 2
[40:09] philippians chapter two sorry verse two
[40:14] philippians two verse two
[40:22] what a beautiful memory verse here let's
[40:24] remember uh this last part help us to
[40:26] esteem others better than ourselves
[40:28] help us to serve others put others first
[40:31] may god help us to grow in that how we
[40:32] want to grow in that i think that's just
[40:34] a beautiful uh we'd say outlook on our
[40:37] lives that we would look to other
[40:39] people's needs better than our own
[40:42] philippians two verses two and three
[40:46] let's begin on three one two three
[40:48] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[40:52] having the same love being of one accord
[40:56] of one mind let nothing be done through
[40:59] strife or vain glory but in lowliness of
[41:02] mind let each esteem other better than
[41:06] themselves may god add his blessing to
[41:08] the reading of his word he may be seated
[41:10] and god bless you saints
[41:21] so let's look to the lord here as we
[41:23] take a thought one more time i do have
[41:25] some slides here we can share
[41:26] uh by the grace of god
[41:31] just trusting the holy spirit to kind of
[41:32] place this together i've got numerous
[41:34] thoughts you know and
[41:36] there's always the
[41:37] the build-up and you want to just say
[41:39] what the lord would have you to say
[41:41] but again as i just said there briefly
[41:43] mount moriah of course this was the
[41:45] place where
[41:46] the jebusites had held it for 403 years
[41:50] and uh g boost means threshing floor so
[41:53] this was the threshing floor this was
[41:55] the place where the chaff was separated
[41:58] from the wheat this was the gathering
[42:00] place of the wheat in other words praise
[42:02] god
[42:03] like even during the time of uh in the
[42:05] time of the the bible times that was a
[42:08] called a threshing floor praise god
[42:10] and we can see it's the gathering
[42:12] together of god's wheat so we'll look to
[42:14] those thoughts and trust it'll be a help
[42:15] to you today
[42:17] i think maybe this might be the final
[42:19] service on this thought but there might
[42:20] be another one we'll see
[42:22] by the grace of god then i want to get
[42:23] back to the 12
[42:24] sons of jacob and their prophesied
[42:26] inheritances and so forth
[42:28] because that's been such a great
[42:29] blessing to us as well so we read our
[42:31] text here uh now we just reviewed from
[42:33] last sunday and wednesday you remember
[42:35] zion has at least five applications to
[42:37] it it can apply to that individual
[42:39] mountain or both mountains or the entire
[42:42] uh nation of israel
[42:44] so it has numerous applications then we
[42:46] see the spiritual application the new
[42:48] testament
[42:49] it speaks of heaven's covenant under the
[42:52] new covenant praise god
[42:54] and it's a kingdom that should not be
[42:57] refused praise god we shouldn't turn
[42:59] this voice down that we hear speaking
[43:01] from heaven praise god
[43:03] and remember zion in jerusalem is the
[43:05] city of the great king amen this is god
[43:08] city hallelujah god chose that city uh
[43:11] jerusalem to be his city of all the
[43:13] places on the earth think about that he
[43:15] could have chose akron right he could
[43:16] have chosen jeffersonville he could have
[43:18] chosen a lot of different places amen he
[43:20] could have chose tucson arizona he could
[43:22] have chosen a lot of places but he chose
[43:24] jerusalem he said that's my city that's
[43:27] my home that will be my earthly dwelling
[43:30] place praise god i have a heavenly
[43:32] dwelling place but i'm going to bring
[43:33] heaven down to earth and i'm choosing
[43:36] jerusalem praise god the teaching of
[43:39] peace praise god
[43:40] the city of peace amen and we saw
[43:42] wednesday night wednesday night we
[43:44] looked at melchizedek a little bit and
[43:46] uh we showed how that was his beginning
[43:48] place
[43:49] in other words abraham realized wow the
[43:51] king of the whole earth the the priest
[43:54] of the whole earth lives in salem
[43:56] not far from him amen hallelujah and
[43:59] that that priest brought forth bread and
[44:01] wine
[44:02] unto him because he trusted in the
[44:05] priest he trusted in the god of the
[44:07] priest amen which was god almighty
[44:09] praise god
[44:10] hallelujah and then shortly you know
[44:12] shortly thereafter
[44:14] isaac and jehovah jireh that mountain
[44:16] that home of of melchizedek became the
[44:19] place where god met abraham and stopped
[44:22] him from slaying his own son as a test
[44:25] to see if he would love god and obey god
[44:27] no matter the cost amen and when he
[44:30] passed that test he said now in a bless
[44:32] you manifold amen i bless you more and
[44:34] more with many more sons and and a long
[44:38] life praise god and he was blessed and
[44:40] god god saw that abraham was going to
[44:42] serve god with all of his heart soul
[44:44] mind and strength amen
[44:46] and then remember church we fast forward
[44:48] you know of course uh 400 years
[44:50] i'm sorry more than that rather
[44:53] fast forward numerous hundreds of years
[44:55] to joshua joshua destroys the king of
[44:58] jerusalem but he never drives out the
[45:01] inhabitants of
[45:02] jerusalem they're able to live behind
[45:05] their their their tent the history says
[45:07] 10 foot high walls
[45:10] and it just seemed impossible uh as
[45:12] we'll see later in this was jerusalem
[45:14] was actually in the land of benjamin
[45:17] it was on the border of judah and
[45:19] benjamin and so the benjamites were
[45:22] never able to take it the sons of judah
[45:25] were never never able to conquer this
[45:28] god was saving it for a special time for
[45:30] a special place
[45:32] to give a sign for his people of what
[45:34] was to come amen hallelujah he finally
[45:38] took it some 403 years later in joshua's
[45:42] time because david made the impossible
[45:45] possible
[45:46] praise god because david was a type of
[45:49] jesus christ
[45:50] praise god now let me go back there
[45:52] from wednesday most of you didn't see
[45:54] this because we got our brothers working
[45:55] second shift and i just want to show
[45:57] this from wednesday
[45:58] every 2000 years remember god does
[46:00] something major right noah's flood the
[46:03] messiah's blood and then he come in the
[46:05] form of the son of man to the gentiles
[46:07] because he never did that before he did
[46:09] the samaritans and the jews but he never
[46:11] did it until our day praise god when he
[46:13] sent brother branham with the spirit of
[46:15] elijah amen
[46:16] to finish the mystery of god now uh
[46:21] okay so here's what i was trying to get
[46:22] to yeah is that right is that did i skip
[46:25] one no that's right one okay so i just
[46:27] want to show this with you both
[46:28] melchizedek and david foreshadowed
[46:31] christ's priesthood
[46:33] so after god destroyed all man he said
[46:35] i'm starting all over and i'm starting
[46:36] with abraham amen a man of faith
[46:39] hallelujah
[46:41] a former idolater i'm going to call him
[46:44] because i know he has a heart that will
[46:45] believe me
[46:46] even though he'd lie sometimes
[46:49] and the church said
[46:51] god said that's my friend even though he
[46:53] had a little bad habit of lying
[46:56] and he was the little coward at times
[46:57] and threw his wife under the bus
[47:00] is that right church that's before the
[47:01] baptism of the holy ghost now so brother
[47:04] that's no excuse for us
[47:05] but in other words we're all going to
[47:07] have shortcomings but but i love what
[47:09] what abraham knew abraham i'm not saved
[47:12] by my works i'm saved by faith
[47:14] abraham how that works the bible paul
[47:17] said when was abraham justified was it
[47:19] before the circumcision or after it was
[47:22] before amen hallelujah as soon as
[47:24] abraham believed god the bible said god
[47:27] did not impute sin unto him amen
[47:30] right he'd have to live with the
[47:31] consequences of his mistakes
[47:34] but god would not impute that to him in
[47:36] other words in god's eyes abraham's
[47:38] always my friend he's eternally my
[47:40] friend i knew him before the foundation
[47:42] of the world and i'm going to be with
[47:44] him i'll never forsake him i redeem him
[47:47] from his mistakes amen i'll help him to
[47:49] overcome his lying amen i'll help him to
[47:52] overcome his cowardice and i'll
[47:54] strengthen him with faith
[47:56] hallelujah so god said i'm starting all
[47:58] over with abraham amen and i'm going to
[48:01] bless the whole world through abraham so
[48:04] he sent abraham a a sign
[48:08] that there is coming a priest who is
[48:10] both king of the world and priest of
[48:13] heaven
[48:14] amen
[48:15] and abraham met him face to face
[48:17] hallelujah
[48:18] and that was foreshadowing what god was
[48:21] going to do
[48:22] through jesus christ amen so look this
[48:25] is four thousand years so two thousand
[48:27] plus two thousand four thousand so four
[48:29] thousand years ago
[48:31] god sent melches down to earth right
[48:33] that was god came down to earth rather
[48:35] right in melchizedek's flesh and he
[48:37] foreshadowed and he foretold the seed of
[48:39] abraham that one day
[48:41] four thousand years about in the future
[48:44] i will live on this earth god will come
[48:46] down and live on this earth and the
[48:48] entire earth will be filled with the
[48:51] knowledge of god
[48:52] the bible said the whole earth shall be
[48:55] filled with his glory amen and all
[48:57] nations shall come into jerusalem during
[48:59] the millennium and give god praise amen
[49:02] and learn the word of god the whole
[49:04] earth will learn and then finally there
[49:07] will be a son of david amen
[49:09] there'll be a son of david there'll be a
[49:11] king and priest on the earth to
[49:13] establish the bible says everlasting
[49:16] righteousness amen
[49:17] hallelujah in other words abraham the
[49:20] world you're longing for is going to
[49:21] come out of your loins amen the world
[49:24] you really desire to live in it's down
[49:25] the road it's about 4 000 years in the
[49:28] future but there's coming melchizedek
[49:30] he's going to change his mask hallelujah
[49:32] and he'll come in 4 000 years and the
[49:34] whole world you'll sit next next to him
[49:37] but the whole world will be ruled by him
[49:39] and it'll be a reign of righteousness
[49:42] amen hallelujah
[49:44] god foreshadowed to abraham and his seed
[49:48] that there's coming a king and priest
[49:50] who will rule this world in
[49:51] righteousness
[49:52] where there's no more liars
[49:54] as presidents right there's no more
[49:56] murderers as presidents right
[49:59] or a prime minister or whatever they
[50:00] name they want to give themselves
[50:02] right flattering titles that they give
[50:04] themselves there's going to be no more
[50:06] of that but there'll be a god who's
[50:08] ruling and reigning who established
[50:10] unending righteousness
[50:13] hallelujah
[50:16] now about a thousand years after that
[50:18] that's what we're looking at where david
[50:21] he caught this sense again god was a
[50:23] thousand years later god was kind of
[50:24] giving another reminder praise god
[50:27] that was more it was even closer to it
[50:29] because now it's not god now it's a man
[50:33] hallelujah yeah he's a sinful man
[50:36] but god used david to take up and not to
[50:39] take up both offices he was both a king
[50:42] and a priest but he was not of the order
[50:45] of aaron praise god
[50:47] hallelujah he was of the tribe of judah
[50:49] amen hallelujah a kingdom priest and
[50:52] that's what the bible said david said
[50:54] let us bring up the ark so we can
[50:56] minister to god in the presence of god
[50:59] in other words we want to live and
[51:01] minister in the presence of god and god
[51:03] said i'm going to make david a sign
[51:05] praise god that 3 000 years in the
[51:07] future a man's going to come who
[51:09] overcomes every sin amen this man is not
[51:12] going to fall to bathsheba right this
[51:14] man is not going to fall
[51:16] to other murders and other mistakes and
[51:18] numbering the people this he's going to
[51:19] be a man but he's not going to fall and
[51:22] he's going to bring in everlasting
[51:23] righteousness amen
[51:25] so david was a sign of that and then a
[51:27] thousand years after that then god came
[51:30] in christ
[51:31] hallelujah and satan offered him this
[51:35] kingdom he offered him the world early
[51:37] before his death
[51:39] he tried to deceive and said you can
[51:40] have the world if you just bow down and
[51:42] worship me
[51:44] and jesus said it is written thou shalt
[51:46] not worship the devil right thou shall
[51:49] worship the lord thy god only amen
[51:52] hallelujah
[51:53] and he served he wasn't an earthly king
[51:55] yet right
[51:57] he was just he was a prophet praise god
[52:00] he was a sacrifice he was a son of david
[52:03] praise god as a prophet as a man
[52:06] and everybody and pilate and all those
[52:08] guys thought oh he's trying to rule the
[52:09] world or i'm sorry herod thought he was
[52:11] going to rule the world so he killed all
[52:12] those babies but he didn't realize it
[52:14] wasn't yet the time in other words man
[52:17] thinks they know the times man doesn't
[52:19] know the time unless god lets them know
[52:22] thank god god has let us know that it's
[52:24] about the time and season of the rapture
[52:26] amen
[52:27] thank god hallelujah by showing us the
[52:29] signs in the scripture thank god as it
[52:32] was the days of noah as it was in the
[52:34] days of life so shall it be in the days
[52:36] of the coming of the son of man thank
[52:39] god we can see hallelujah that it's the
[52:41] coming of the lord praise god that evil
[52:44] seducers will wax worse and worse but
[52:46] the holy ghost will guide us more and
[52:48] more into truth amen hallelujah that's
[52:51] the day in the hour amen and we're
[52:53] seeing the seed gather to the word we're
[52:55] seeing christ gather a seed together in
[52:58] little groups in akron and little groups
[53:00] in iowa praise god and little groups in
[53:02] pennsylvania and napoleon praise god
[53:04] there's little groups all over little
[53:06] groups so we being gathered together
[53:08] being ready for the rapture amen
[53:11] hallelujah
[53:12] so since christ we've been in 2000 years
[53:15] of a spiritual priesthood
[53:18] hallelujah
[53:19] so jesus christ the bible said he's the
[53:21] king of saints
[53:23] how many remember that from revelation
[53:24] 15. the bible said we praise him o king
[53:27] of saints
[53:28] so he's a spiritual king now and he's a
[53:31] spiritual priest for us he's not on the
[53:34] earth right but he's established a
[53:36] spiritual priesthood and it's it's it's
[53:38] it's been exactly what the believers
[53:41] have needed for 2000 years
[53:44] hallelujah
[53:46] it was good like it's that old time
[53:48] religion song right it was good for paul
[53:50] and silas
[53:51] as they were in the prison praise god it
[53:53] was good for william tyndale as he was
[53:55] burning at the stake amen
[53:57] hallelujah it was good for brother
[53:59] branham after a car accident and dying
[54:01] praise god it was good enough for him
[54:03] praise god and it's good enough for me
[54:05] give me that old-time religion give me
[54:07] that order a melchizedek priesthood give
[54:09] me that priesthood with jesus that jesus
[54:12] can be touched by the feeling of my
[54:14] infirmities he can minister to my needs
[54:16] and he can go to the father with my
[54:18] requests amen
[54:20] he can take your request to the father
[54:22] because he's the high priest right now
[54:24] praise god and he can meet your need and
[54:26] the bible said he'll give you every
[54:28] benefit amen
[54:30] hallelujah
[54:31] for two thousand years he's given them
[54:32] all the things they needed amen
[54:35] everything the believers needed he's
[54:37] provided by his hand of mercy
[54:39] amen
[54:41] now let me skip ahead here
[54:44] so in other words church and then i
[54:45] showed another thing so you had a
[54:47] melchizedek priest that lasted from
[54:48] abraham to moses and then you had the
[54:51] aaronic priesthood that lasted about
[54:53] 1500 years
[54:56] right so you know about 2 000 years of
[54:58] melchizedek
[54:59] aaron and then now we got to the
[55:01] spiritual priesthood of the lord jesus
[55:04] christ does that help by god's grace we
[55:06] brother said i showed on wednesday we
[55:08] are under the the priesthood of jesus
[55:10] christ which is after the order of
[55:12] melchizedek
[55:14] amen in other words when you get the
[55:16] victory god's going to come around and
[55:18] want to bless you amen hallelujah in
[55:20] other words god's going to empower you
[55:22] to get the victory praise god and then
[55:24] when you get the victory you give him
[55:26] all the praise amen
[55:28] hallelujah you'll pay your tithes and
[55:30] offerings you'll be a faithful member
[55:31] high praise we're under the priesthood
[55:33] of jesus christ
[55:35] who's likened unto melchizedek
[55:38] now let's get to the let's get to where
[55:39] we're going to be that's just a quick
[55:41] review
[55:43] now here's a picture this is kind of
[55:45] like a picture
[55:46] of the jebusites of how they had mount
[55:48] moriah all defended
[55:51] now the the upper part of mount moriah
[55:52] now this of course would have been when
[55:54] solomon
[55:55] had uh built his temple
[55:57] so imagine before salman built the
[55:59] temple this was all jebusite territory
[56:02] praise god
[56:04] and so david of course remember he came
[56:06] to here and the bible said they were
[56:09] mocking him at the top can you imagine
[56:10] mocking a man who defeated those giants
[56:13] he defeated goliath
[56:15] this is a man he wasn't no
[56:17] but they sit up there on the top of the
[56:19] walls and mocked him and said the
[56:21] paralyzer or the lame and the blind
[56:23] could defend this city it's so strong
[56:26] and david didn't back down
[56:28] he didn't he didn't get discouraged when
[56:29] they made fun of him he got encouraged
[56:32] he didn't get weaker church he got
[56:34] stronger praise god when the devil
[56:36] taunts you you just take the word of god
[56:39] and you go forward and you don't back
[56:41] down you just wait for the wisdom of god
[56:43] and god will give you the victory praise
[56:45] god
[56:47] he didn't back down he didn't say well i
[56:48] guess i'm going to go back to hebron now
[56:50] i don't really need to get this victory
[56:52] no he need he knew he needed to fulfill
[56:55] the plan of god for his life part of the
[56:57] will of god for his life was to serve as
[57:00] a high priest and as a king unto god for
[57:03] the people so in other words there's
[57:05] nothing the devil could do to stop this
[57:07] praise god david was going to conquer he
[57:10] didn't know how it's going to be done
[57:11] until god showed it to him but once god
[57:14] showed it to him there was nothing that
[57:15] could stop david he was going to
[57:17] overcome
[57:19] it was an impossible enemy the bible
[57:22] said
[57:23] they thought they were
[57:24] invincible
[57:26] but nothing's invincible if god's on
[57:28] your side
[57:29] hallelujah how many got god on your side
[57:33] remember with god nothing shall be
[57:35] impossible amen hallelujah with god
[57:39] nothing shall be impossible so david got
[57:42] the revelation he said which one are you
[57:43] men whoever goes up to the
[57:46] the water conduit
[57:48] whoever goes to the gutter first he's
[57:51] the chief of my soldiers
[57:53] in other words david said he you know
[57:54] remember he came from the south he came
[57:56] down this way because hebron was south
[57:58] he came up with all the soldiers he said
[58:00] go by the waterway go by the gihon
[58:03] spring
[58:04] and you've got to crawl uh so remember
[58:07] he taking jerusalem was his first act
[58:09] after becoming king of all the 12 tribes
[58:12] the very first thing he does
[58:14] once he gets unity with all the tribes
[58:17] he said the first thing i'm doing i'm
[58:19] going up to
[58:20] jerusalem see he had a burn in him i've
[58:23] got to go there i've got to conquer this
[58:25] i've got types and shadows i've got to
[58:28] fulfill praise god
[58:29] i've got a burden i've got a desire
[58:32] the whole nation's behind me i've got a
[58:34] heart after god's heart amen amen i need
[58:38] to unite this people this was a divided
[58:40] tri i'm sorry divided country
[58:42] they were divided remember david was the
[58:45] only king
[58:46] uh he was only the king of judah before
[58:48] ishmael sheth had the other 11 tribes
[58:51] but then he finally died and all the men
[58:54] came to david and hebron and said we
[58:56] know the prophet called you to be king
[58:58] praise god
[59:00] hallelujah one prophet will never
[59:01] contradict
[59:02] another hallelujah
[59:05] but see as believers we must wait on the
[59:07] timing of god and that's why we're here
[59:09] today we're waiting on the time of god
[59:11] for the rapture
[59:13] and while we're waiting for that we're
[59:14] waiting for other blessings too praise
[59:16] god we're waiting for other promises our
[59:18] loved ones save right we're waiting for
[59:20] family and all these things we're
[59:21] waiting for the promises of god and we
[59:24] know that god's spirit just like god
[59:26] brought unity amen just like god brought
[59:28] unity to israel god's going to bring
[59:30] unity to the bride amen
[59:32] it won't be anything we have to do we
[59:34] just have to fall more in love with
[59:35] jesus because he said you'll know by
[59:37] disciples because of their love one for
[59:39] another amen
[59:41] so as we fall in love with jesus we'll
[59:42] naturally fall in love with god's people
[59:46] the very first act he did was go up to
[59:48] jerusalem we'll look at that in a little
[59:49] bit here
[59:51] remember david took the city through
[59:53] joab's courage to act upon his plan
[59:56] to enter through the water conduit or
[59:58] the gutter
[1:00:00] and remember i showed five reasons on
[1:00:02] wednesday why david taking zion
[1:00:04] represents the rapture so in other words
[1:00:06] joab he first had to conquer this first
[1:00:08] hill he had to overcome and get in that
[1:00:10] the gihon spring here and he had to
[1:00:12] crawl up through here and then climb up
[1:00:15] and they had to do a they had to get the
[1:00:17] victory from the inside out
[1:00:19] it wasn't going to be the normal type of
[1:00:21] victory this was going to be a secret
[1:00:23] attack
[1:00:24] praise god it was going to be a victory
[1:00:26] through the knowledge of god given to
[1:00:28] david
[1:00:29] praise god
[1:00:31] it'd be have to be a a brave man who
[1:00:34] could trust the word of the lord
[1:00:36] remember this was thought impossible
[1:00:39] they thought it was impossible for this
[1:00:41] city to fall but with god nothing shall
[1:00:44] be impossible amen
[1:00:46] with the high priest with the king if
[1:00:48] the king's on our side no one can stand
[1:00:51] before us amen because we've got the
[1:00:53] authority we've got the power of the
[1:00:55] king praise god that that david is
[1:00:58] anointed he's got the anointing of god
[1:01:00] amen and if david gives me a promise i'm
[1:01:03] going to keep that word i'm going to
[1:01:04] fulfill that word and watch that word
[1:01:06] move in my life
[1:01:08] that's what george said praise god i've
[1:01:10] got the word of the king the king's
[1:01:12] anointed and so i'm taking his anointed
[1:01:15] word and i'm going to possess the gates
[1:01:16] of my enemies
[1:01:18] history said he climbed through there
[1:01:20] and then he opened the gates and then
[1:01:22] israel come in and just ravish the city
[1:01:24] because they were complacent they
[1:01:26] thought after 400 years oh nobody's
[1:01:28] going to touch us
[1:01:29] they just put the blind the lame up
[1:01:31] there watching on the walls but god had
[1:01:33] a way to overcome
[1:01:35] look at that church the the complacent
[1:01:37] always get overtaken
[1:01:39] right like the lukewarm they get spewed
[1:01:41] out of the mouth of god
[1:01:42] that's why we can't remain lukewarm
[1:01:44] we've got to be hot for jesus amen
[1:01:47] all the time hot for jesus a lot of
[1:01:49] great lessons in here and after david
[1:01:51] gets in now of course this is the days
[1:01:52] of solomon because again you have the
[1:01:54] temple in david's day they didn't have a
[1:01:56] temple up there
[1:01:57] historians just they they make it sound
[1:01:59] like there was just a place of sacrifice
[1:02:00] up there it was just a mountaintop and
[1:02:02] they had sacrifices there
[1:02:07] but remember david wanted to build
[1:02:08] remember the prophet came and said david
[1:02:10] do what's ever in your heart and david
[1:02:12] said praise the lord i'm going to build
[1:02:13] the house of god
[1:02:14] and the prophet went home and the holy
[1:02:16] spirit said no go tell my servant david
[1:02:19] you've been a bloody man you'll not
[1:02:21] build it he said but your son will be
[1:02:23] able to praise god don't you like that
[1:02:24] church sometimes we utter things we
[1:02:26] don't even know what we're saying but
[1:02:27] aren't you glad god is faithful to
[1:02:29] correct our unthinking of our words amen
[1:02:32] our own human leading if we're sensitive
[1:02:34] to the holy spirit he'll give us the
[1:02:36] right word and we'll have to go back and
[1:02:38] say oh i'm sorry let me correct that i
[1:02:40] spoke a little too soon here's what the
[1:02:42] bible said to me that's a real prophet
[1:02:45] amen a prophet can say something wrong
[1:02:47] but then come back and fix it that's how
[1:02:49] we should be praise god we need god's
[1:02:51] help we need to be corrected and god
[1:02:53] will correct us amen
[1:02:56] hallelujah
[1:02:58] you know the story as soon as he took it
[1:03:00] the bible said as soon as david took
[1:03:02] this city
[1:03:03] he built his own city
[1:03:05] he started tearing down buildings he
[1:03:07] started building up his i think he spent
[1:03:08] what seven years building his house
[1:03:12] and he built the city of david now
[1:03:14] here's this is actually the actual mount
[1:03:16] zion over here so this was the mount
[1:03:18] moriah
[1:03:21] so he builds his own city
[1:03:23] and they called it the city of david
[1:03:25] because his leadership helped conquer
[1:03:27] the city
[1:03:28] and that something the city of david
[1:03:31] david conquers it so they name that
[1:03:32] after david praise god
[1:03:34] hallelujah
[1:03:35] that's beautiful
[1:03:38] he was the one that knew they could take
[1:03:40] the land and they did
[1:03:42] it's a beautiful type
[1:03:44] now i want to see here look what matthew
[1:03:46] henry said
[1:03:48] now the very first exploit david did
[1:03:50] after he was anointed king over all
[1:03:52] israel was to gain jerusalem out of the
[1:03:54] hand of the jebusites which because it
[1:03:56] belonged to benjamin listen
[1:03:58] he could not well attempt till that
[1:04:00] tribe which had long adhered to saul's
[1:04:02] house submitted to him
[1:04:04] so for seven and a half years brother he
[1:04:06] was down in judah and he he knew
[1:04:09] jerusalem belonged to the people of god
[1:04:11] but he couldn't take it because that
[1:04:13] wasn't his land
[1:04:16] isn't that interesting
[1:04:18] in other words david was a man of
[1:04:19] respect
[1:04:21] he respected someone else's land he knew
[1:04:24] that was the benjamite's land in other
[1:04:25] words well for seven half years i'll
[1:04:26] wait for the benjamites to do it if they
[1:04:28] don't do it wait till i get leadership
[1:04:30] over the whole nation
[1:04:31] because once i'm king over everybody
[1:04:33] then i can go take it
[1:04:35] i don't in other words i don't have
[1:04:37] jurisdiction i don't have authority over
[1:04:40] benjamin because i'm not king over the
[1:04:42] benjaminites yet amen
[1:04:43] so david wade at church he waited for
[1:04:46] seven and a half years to take the
[1:04:48] promise of god may god help us amen as
[1:04:51] we wait upon promises not to get
[1:04:53] frustrated
[1:04:54] not to get all mixed up not to toss to
[1:04:57] and fro but to wait on god's timing and
[1:04:59] when it's god's time for you to inherit
[1:05:01] it you will possess it amen
[1:05:04] seven and a half years
[1:05:07] he amen have done it because god was
[1:05:09] with him but he waited on god's timing
[1:05:11] because he's a man of god
[1:05:14] that should remind you of something that
[1:05:15] david didn't take saul's life to become
[1:05:18] king a little quicker although he could
[1:05:20] have twice look at the devil typing
[1:05:23] testing him twice
[1:05:25] hallelujah the bible said he leaves for
[1:05:27] a season
[1:05:30] look at that he knew i'm anointed by
[1:05:32] samuel why don't i just end his life
[1:05:34] he's a backslidden king why don't i just
[1:05:35] get rid of him anyway he's backslidden
[1:05:37] he's a lukewarm laodicean
[1:05:40] no
[1:05:40] he said i'm not going to touch god's
[1:05:42] anointed amen
[1:05:43] i'm not going to force my way into doing
[1:05:46] this i'm not going to through violence
[1:05:48] possess the kingdom i'm going to let god
[1:05:50] do it
[1:05:52] hallelujah
[1:05:53] so we see look at this pattern in
[1:05:54] david's life he respects authority
[1:05:58] hallelujah
[1:06:00] the bible said the workers of iniquity
[1:06:02] do not the bible said they speak things
[1:06:04] against authorities and principalities
[1:06:06] things they don't even understand to
[1:06:08] their own shame
[1:06:09] that's what jude says
[1:06:11] see let's be careful what we say let's
[1:06:13] respect god's authority praise god and
[1:06:15] that means respecting every single
[1:06:17] person in the church praise god
[1:06:19] respecting them showing them love praise
[1:06:21] god and waiting for god's timing even if
[1:06:23] you know god's going to do something
[1:06:24] wait upon the timing of god show respect
[1:06:27] put your faith in god don't try to force
[1:06:29] it let god do it
[1:06:32] so just like he respected saul's office
[1:06:35] he respected the benjamite's land
[1:06:39] hallelujah
[1:06:42] in other words gods respects the
[1:06:44] properties of others now notice he's the
[1:06:45] creator of all property isn't that
[1:06:47] something brother
[1:06:49] he's the owner of heaven and earth yet
[1:06:50] he let the devil have a home in hell
[1:06:53] right i mean god god created all
[1:06:55] but yet he's so kind
[1:06:58] now he did kick the devil out of heaven
[1:06:59] that's good
[1:07:00] and he's going to kick him out one more
[1:07:02] time praise god at the rapture amen
[1:07:04] jesus said i saw satan falling down as
[1:07:06] lightning praise god at the days of the
[1:07:09] coming of the son of man amen
[1:07:11] there come a time remember when the
[1:07:12] bride goes up satan gets kicked out
[1:07:14] eating up nothing left to accuse
[1:07:16] so he goes down to anoint the antichrist
[1:07:18] it hasn't happened yet but it's going to
[1:07:20] happen praise god
[1:07:22] see god takes nothing until it's
[1:07:25] rightfully his
[1:07:27] even abraham said he said i'm not going
[1:07:29] to take your cave to bury my wife i'm
[1:07:32] not going to borrow it i'm going to buy
[1:07:34] it
[1:07:36] whatever i possess is going to be
[1:07:38] rightfully mine
[1:07:39] amen
[1:07:41] hallelujah david did the same thing
[1:07:43] after he numbered the people remember he
[1:07:44] went up to the threshing floor he went
[1:07:46] up to moriah
[1:07:48] and he said let me buy this land from
[1:07:50] you praise god and he bought it praise
[1:07:52] god
[1:07:53] and just like jesus at his three
[1:07:54] temptations he's not going to be given
[1:07:57] i'm just i'm not going to accept that as
[1:07:58] a gift i'm going to go god's provided
[1:08:00] way i'm going to suffer through the
[1:08:02] death of the cross praise god i'm going
[1:08:04] to have my faith set toward calvary i'm
[1:08:06] going to fulfill god's will and not take
[1:08:08] something as an easy bribe i'm not going
[1:08:10] to choose the easy way i'm choosing the
[1:08:12] hard way
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:15] i'm taking the lord's way with the
[1:08:17] lord's despised few amen
[1:08:20] even though we're small in number we're
[1:08:22] great in victory we're great in
[1:08:23] revelation we're great in joy hallelujah
[1:08:26] we've got the saint the lord
[1:08:28] hallelujah
[1:08:30] that's exactly right church
[1:08:33] other churches are just guessing at it
[1:08:35] they think they know it but we've got
[1:08:36] the saith the lord
[1:08:38] hallelujah
[1:08:40] so we stand by how many can say praise
[1:08:41] the lord
[1:08:44] this is god's nature he respects even
[1:08:46] the devil
[1:08:48] i heard this preach this is really good
[1:08:49] remember when david prayed i'm sorry
[1:08:51] daniel prayed for those 21 days
[1:08:54] after 21 days the angel came down and
[1:08:56] said i couldn't get through for 21 days
[1:08:59] because of the prince of persia
[1:09:01] check this out church i thought this was
[1:09:03] a beautiful thought i heard brother
[1:09:04] donny preach it
[1:09:05] the prince of persia was a fallen devil
[1:09:08] but he was still stronger than the devil
[1:09:11] that came i'm sorry but then the angel
[1:09:12] that came down to daniel
[1:09:14] in other words god's let god let angels
[1:09:17] fall but he still respects their
[1:09:18] authority
[1:09:21] isn't that something
[1:09:22] the same idea here god god will respect
[1:09:25] satan's authority
[1:09:27] right he'll allow him to do things in
[1:09:29] other words the devil will get
[1:09:30] permission to do things and think i'll
[1:09:32] do this as long as i can and then you'll
[1:09:34] try to take our lives but then god will
[1:09:36] say stop right there you can't take his
[1:09:37] life
[1:09:38] hallelujah
[1:09:40] praise god
[1:09:41] and the angel said i was waiting 21 days
[1:09:45] until gabriel came
[1:09:48] and then gabriel hurt off the prince of
[1:09:50] persia now you go down there i'm ready
[1:09:52] to fight him and wrestle with him a
[1:09:53] little bit because i've got strongest po
[1:09:55] i can handle this guy i've got power and
[1:09:57] authority and i can handle him now you
[1:09:59] go down there and tell god's beloved
[1:10:02] that he heard his prayer and give him
[1:10:03] the revelations he needs to fulfill
[1:10:05] god's will for his life amen
[1:10:08] hallelujah amen see god always respects
[1:10:11] your authority and your position
[1:10:14] always
[1:10:18] so see god is a man of respect
[1:10:21] he's a man of honor
[1:10:24] he sets up the laws in the in the
[1:10:25] universe and he keeps the laws
[1:10:30] i think that's a beautiful thought
[1:10:31] church it's a beautiful thought
[1:10:33] in other words we're going to need if
[1:10:34] we're going to need answers for the
[1:10:36] rapture guess what we're going to need
[1:10:37] some help from heaven
[1:10:39] honey we need some strong angels maybe
[1:10:41] that's why the bible says the voice of
[1:10:43] the archangel
[1:10:46] the last trump amen we got the show we
[1:10:49] need the voice right and then the trump
[1:10:51] of god praise god thank god we have a
[1:10:53] strong archangel that will give us the
[1:10:55] voice of resurrection hallelujah
[1:10:58] amen praise god because that archangel
[1:11:01] will have a higher anointing than all
[1:11:03] the demons of death that are trying to
[1:11:05] hold down the dead and christ amen
[1:11:07] hallelujah and the voice of the arcane
[1:11:09] bible said is the voice of resurrection
[1:11:13] hallelujah praise god
[1:11:15] see god just he's got it all set up he
[1:11:16] knows how to do it he's going to bring
[1:11:18] it to pass in his time and season let's
[1:11:20] not be discouraged everything's right on
[1:11:23] time
[1:11:24] hallelujah
[1:11:28] oh thank god church
[1:11:31] so let me just reiterate that again
[1:11:33] david couldn't take zion because it
[1:11:35] belonged to benjamin
[1:11:36] but then when the three remember i
[1:11:38] showed you that number three thousand
[1:11:40] soldiers from benjamin come down and
[1:11:41] said you know we would have had more but
[1:11:43] they still love saul but those of us
[1:11:45] under benjamin we're coming to support
[1:11:47] you in other words all the uh this means
[1:11:50] benjamin is now gonna support you and
[1:11:52] once david had that once he had
[1:11:54] benjamin's support once he knew he was
[1:11:56] ruling over benjamin now i'm the king of
[1:11:58] that land
[1:12:00] now i can go up in the very first thing
[1:12:02] he said i'm going to take in the capitol
[1:12:04] i'm going to go take the city of god
[1:12:07] if i'm god's king i'm going to go take
[1:12:09] the king city hallelujah
[1:12:12] i need a permanent dwelling place now
[1:12:14] it's mine it's the rightful time and
[1:12:16] look at it he could not be defeated
[1:12:18] hallelujah because he was in the plan of
[1:12:20] god and he had the authority of god he
[1:12:22] had the purpose of god amen amen he
[1:12:24] waited till he had all the permissions
[1:12:26] of god
[1:12:29] he didn't push the brethren around say
[1:12:30] well this will be mine eventually i'm
[1:12:32] doing it right now no he waited on god's
[1:12:35] timing
[1:12:36] as a true servant of god
[1:12:41] church many times god just wants you to
[1:12:43] let things take their course
[1:12:45] because time is always hindsight's
[1:12:47] always 20 20.
[1:12:49] like why doesn't god take these false
[1:12:50] preachers out of the way just give it
[1:12:51] some time
[1:12:53] god's going to manifest what's in their
[1:12:54] heart
[1:12:55] he always does that
[1:12:58] right all these false movements that
[1:12:59] start in the 70s and 80s and and the
[1:13:01] message look at him now brother all
[1:13:03] their guys are dead all their false
[1:13:05] prophecies are falling and they're all
[1:13:06] caught in these sins of
[1:13:09] money laundering and adultery and child
[1:13:12] abuse and all these things just give it
[1:13:13] some time god knows time will solve
[1:13:16] everything because god has a season for
[1:13:18] everything
[1:13:21] god has a season for revelation he has a
[1:13:23] season to possess the promises he has
[1:13:26] the season to raise kings up and bring
[1:13:28] them down praise god
[1:13:32] the bible said heresies are given so
[1:13:34] they'll manifest who's on god's side and
[1:13:36] who's not on god's side
[1:13:41] that reminds me on the podcast this week
[1:13:43] i was called a complete heretic because
[1:13:44] i preached the three works of grace
[1:13:46] by the believe the sign people i love
[1:13:48] you guys but you're wrong
[1:13:50] i sent you a i sent them an email in
[1:13:52] april it took me four hours to write
[1:13:54] that email proving the three works of
[1:13:56] grace i don't hear anything back that's
[1:13:58] fine
[1:13:59] that's fine the guys that say they're
[1:14:01] going to study and things like that
[1:14:02] that's fine but you didn't study it out
[1:14:03] and you didn't reply to it
[1:14:05] that and that's what exactly what paul
[1:14:07] said the way they call heresy that's how
[1:14:09] i serve god
[1:14:12] that's how i serve god you've got to be
[1:14:14] more than justified you've got to be
[1:14:15] more than sanctified we need some more
[1:14:17] sanctification but we need people filled
[1:14:19] with the holy ghost amen
[1:14:22] and think of the lie that there's
[1:14:23] they're telling these people that walk
[1:14:25] off the street brother that they're
[1:14:26] smoking cigarettes say now you said the
[1:14:28] sinner's prayer now you're filled with
[1:14:30] the fullness of god and they walk out
[1:14:32] smoking and cussing and watching
[1:14:33] pornography that's a lie god won't fill
[1:14:36] that person god's got to sanctify that
[1:14:38] person jesus prayed said god sanctify
[1:14:41] peter through thy truth thy word is
[1:14:43] truth and then he breathes on them say
[1:14:45] go up there and get the holy ghost amen
[1:14:49] and i was listening to them call me a
[1:14:50] heretic
[1:14:51] the man said
[1:14:53] the critic of brother branham said this
[1:14:54] he said show me where the bible ever
[1:14:57] said someone was saved and not filled
[1:14:58] with the holy ghost and i sat there and
[1:15:00] the holy spirit said mary
[1:15:02] the mother of jesus
[1:15:04] in luke chapter 1 she said remember when
[1:15:06] she was pregnant of the holy ghost she
[1:15:08] said i've rejoiced in god my
[1:15:11] savior
[1:15:12] in other words mary's saying i'm already
[1:15:14] saved
[1:15:15] i'm saved on the old testament
[1:15:17] she was already saved
[1:15:19] but if you go to acts chapter 1 right
[1:15:21] luke john axe go two books over in acts
[1:15:24] chapter one the bible said she went up
[1:15:26] to pentecost and she was praying with a
[1:15:29] hundred and twenty and then in chapter
[1:15:30] two the holy ghost came
[1:15:32] and the bible said they were all
[1:15:34] including the mother of mary who was
[1:15:36] already saved fill with the holy ghost
[1:15:38] amen hallelujah and if the mother of god
[1:15:41] on this earth has to be filled with the
[1:15:43] holy ghost what about us amen
[1:15:46] hallelujah praise god that's why i love
[1:15:48] the holy spirit who give you the word to
[1:15:50] say in that hour praise god
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:54] hallelujah
[1:15:56] and they can lie and they can call name
[1:15:58] call whatever they want but we've got
[1:16:00] thus saith the lord
[1:16:02] and they don't
[1:16:04] i'll probably make a video they'll
[1:16:05] probably make a video on me about that
[1:16:06] but that's okay i love them i'm still
[1:16:08] waiting on your emails i'm the one
[1:16:09] waiting now
[1:16:11] i'm waiting since april
[1:16:12] that's okay god knows god knows
[1:16:15] god knows
[1:16:16] i've offered all these people
[1:16:18] my books
[1:16:20] and all these videos and they don't want
[1:16:22] to study it out the people that say
[1:16:23] they're this one studying are the ones
[1:16:24] that don't want to study it
[1:16:27] you know what that is
[1:16:29] that's the wrong spirit
[1:16:31] and i've i've been buying some of their
[1:16:33] stuff i bought some of theirs i'm
[1:16:34] studying now
[1:16:35] i can read theirs but they can't read
[1:16:36] mine why because they're afraid of the
[1:16:38] truth
[1:16:39] i'm not afraid of the truth
[1:16:40] i've got the spirit of truth
[1:16:42] i'm born again of truth
[1:16:44] hallelujah praise god
[1:16:47] amen i better move on here now the mount
[1:16:49] zion showdown now that now for years my
[1:16:52] whole life
[1:16:53] this confused me until cam came
[1:16:55] that's how i love the holy spirit he
[1:16:57] always brings it at the right time why
[1:16:59] would brother adam call the rapture
[1:17:00] mount zion
[1:17:03] brother brahm says so it's at this time
[1:17:04] in this country that this person will
[1:17:06] appear speaking of the seven church age
[1:17:07] messenger or the elijah anointed prophet
[1:17:09] for it's in the scripture and it's thus
[1:17:11] saith the lord
[1:17:13] then the latter rain there will come
[1:17:14] forth the mount carmel
[1:17:16] a showdown
[1:17:19] bible fulfilled to the letter john the
[1:17:20] baptist his messenger before his face in
[1:17:22] malachi 3 planted a former reign and was
[1:17:24] rejected by the churches the
[1:17:26] denominations the pharisees in his day
[1:17:28] jesus came and had the mount
[1:17:29] transfiguration showdown
[1:17:31] this forerunner of the last days will
[1:17:33] sow he plants for the latter rain so
[1:17:36] brother adam planted for the latter rain
[1:17:38] right he planted seeds of truth amen
[1:17:41] praise god
[1:17:42] hallelujah he planted it on those tapes
[1:17:44] or the books and the tapes
[1:17:46] and then we just got to listen to it and
[1:17:48] then it directs us back to where the
[1:17:49] word of god
[1:17:51] hallelujah
[1:17:53] like i got shown in that parable the
[1:17:55] bible said he found a treasure hitting
[1:17:57] the field what's the treasure the
[1:17:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:00] paul said you've got treasure in earthen
[1:18:02] vessels
[1:18:04] so what's the treasure the holy ghost it
[1:18:06] was in the field what's the field the
[1:18:08] bible the prophecy where joel prophesied
[1:18:11] of it ezekiel prophesied of it he said
[1:18:13] i'll give you a new heart new spirit my
[1:18:15] spirit there's the three works of grace
[1:18:17] it was laying there in the field and we
[1:18:19] stumbled upon it amen hallelujah praise
[1:18:22] god brother i am planted those things in
[1:18:24] the message so we can find them and
[1:18:26] they're going to grow up in the right
[1:18:28] time for harvest amen
[1:18:30] hallelujah
[1:18:31] praise god
[1:18:32] all these denominations we visited 12
[1:18:34] churches now and they all think they got
[1:18:36] the holy ghost i'm sad to say they don't
[1:18:38] but we've got it because it's producing
[1:18:40] the life of jesus christ
[1:18:42] amen amen
[1:18:44] the life the power the divine nature the
[1:18:47] doctrine all the things of jesus christ
[1:18:49] it's reproducing it and you and i
[1:18:52] hallelujah
[1:18:54] you got to have off you got to have the
[1:18:55] right doctrine and the right spirit
[1:18:58] you got to have both i heard so many
[1:18:59] people say well if i don't have the
[1:19:01] right doctrine and i at least want the
[1:19:02] right spirit why can't you have both
[1:19:04] paul had both paul didn't just have a
[1:19:06] right spirit he had the truth and he
[1:19:08] said if anybody thinks they're more
[1:19:09] spiritual than me let him acknowledge
[1:19:11] that i'm the prophet
[1:19:13] and who does the word of god come to a
[1:19:15] prophet
[1:19:16] he had the right spirit and the right
[1:19:19] doctrine that's what we've got
[1:19:20] hallelujah the holy spirit and the true
[1:19:23] doctrine of the holy spirit you have to
[1:19:25] have both jesus said you must worship in
[1:19:27] spirit and in truth
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:32] dynamics and mechanics
[1:19:36] we've got the mechanics of the doctrine
[1:19:37] and the dynamics of the moving
[1:19:39] supernatural power of the holy ghost
[1:19:43] not when we want to but when god wants
[1:19:45] to
[1:19:46] right i always leave that in there so we
[1:19:47] don't command god to do things god ain't
[1:19:49] going to do nothing unless he wants to
[1:19:51] do it
[1:19:55] jesus will be the showdown
[1:19:57] between denominations and creeds
[1:20:00] which is his word
[1:20:02] so in this the last showdown before the
[1:20:04] rapture is the word versus creeds
[1:20:08] and that ought to make you happy church
[1:20:10] hallelujah
[1:20:12] the last showdown is you want to believe
[1:20:13] a creed the trinity
[1:20:15] father son holy
[1:20:16] ghost right you want to believe that the
[1:20:19] wafer you want to believe the catholic
[1:20:21] transubstantiation want to believe that
[1:20:22] or do you want to be the word
[1:20:24] oh i love how god makes it so simple
[1:20:27] oh we can't miss him brother william we
[1:20:28] can't have you our eyes we are not
[1:20:30] children of darkness hallelujah we're
[1:20:32] children of light
[1:20:33] we can see real well what's going on
[1:20:35] praise god
[1:20:38] glory
[1:20:40] when he comes a showdown the rapture of
[1:20:42] his bride
[1:20:44] the first was mount carmel
[1:20:46] which he put 12 stones back together to
[1:20:49] restore worship
[1:20:50] i use that in the book i believe that's
[1:20:52] a type
[1:20:53] 12 doctrines right 12 mysteries
[1:20:55] the second was mount transfiguration
[1:20:58] this is my beloved son hear him
[1:21:00] the third will be mount zion
[1:21:03] glory
[1:21:04] hallelujah
[1:21:06] now it finally makes sense
[1:21:08] remember this i kind of updated it now
[1:21:09] mount carmel was a physical mountain i'm
[1:21:11] not sure what the forerunner was but
[1:21:13] elijah had to show down with baal
[1:21:15] denominations
[1:21:16] and god won
[1:21:17] mount transfiguration was a physical
[1:21:19] mountain i would also say it was a
[1:21:21] spiritual showdown with the
[1:21:22] denominational spirit now this is
[1:21:24] interesting this was a showdown with
[1:21:26] denominational spirit within his own
[1:21:28] ranks
[1:21:30] right peter peter said let's build three
[1:21:32] tabernacles here
[1:21:34] and the father cut him off and said this
[1:21:36] is my beloved son whom i'm well pleased
[1:21:38] hear ye him
[1:21:40] in other words let's stop talking about
[1:21:41] tabernacles let's talk about you being
[1:21:43] the tabernacle of god
[1:21:45] amen let's talk about jesus is the
[1:21:47] tabernacle of god hallelujah the image
[1:21:50] of the invisible god let's talk about
[1:21:52] that peter and then you're going to grow
[1:21:53] up and you're going to be the stature of
[1:21:55] a perfect man you're going to be a
[1:21:56] tabernacle of the living god amen
[1:21:59] we've had enough temples enough churches
[1:22:01] enough buildings god don't want a dead
[1:22:03] building god wants a living building
[1:22:05] amen
[1:22:06] god it's a living stone praise god god
[1:22:09] is a living believer whose spirit can
[1:22:11] flow through
[1:22:13] hallelujah
[1:22:14] so god had to cut him off and said i
[1:22:16] want a living temple
[1:22:20] so bill brown said there was a four
[1:22:21] former reign to the mount
[1:22:22] transfiguration showdown john the
[1:22:24] baptist
[1:22:26] was the former reign rebuking
[1:22:27] organizations
[1:22:29] but then the latter reign for that day
[1:22:33] was jesus
[1:22:34] overcoming the denominational spirit in
[1:22:36] peter
[1:22:40] that's why church would never worry
[1:22:41] about building a building now if we if
[1:22:43] god gives us enough
[1:22:44] we'll know when it's time to build a
[1:22:46] building we'll have overflow
[1:22:48] or god will give us such a revelation
[1:22:49] we'll know when it's time to build but
[1:22:50] that's why we don't worry about those
[1:22:51] things that's what peter was worried
[1:22:53] about
[1:22:54] let's build a church
[1:22:55] right
[1:22:56] and you got to have one right but the
[1:22:58] same time
[1:22:59] the showdown was about exalting jesus
[1:23:02] christ
[1:23:03] and not thinking earthly or carnally but
[1:23:05] thinking about what god was doing
[1:23:06] spiritually
[1:23:09] so our mount zion we know it's a
[1:23:11] physical mountain in israel but the one
[1:23:13] we've come to is the spiritual mountain
[1:23:16] brother branham planted for the latter
[1:23:17] rain he planted seeds that would be
[1:23:19] fruitful in harvest time
[1:23:22] i don't know after i got the former rain
[1:23:24] and here comes the latter rain he
[1:23:26] rebuked the organizations just like john
[1:23:28] the baptist
[1:23:29] and now we're waiting for a showdown
[1:23:31] with those denominations
[1:23:33] against the word
[1:23:36] i've got three or four videos of
[1:23:38] democrats all basically making all
[1:23:41] evangelical christians devils
[1:23:45] and calling uh you know uh
[1:23:49] mothers you know
[1:23:50] stay-at-home moms and they're just
[1:23:51] criticizing making them look like
[1:23:53] they're terrorists
[1:23:54] when the reality is they're the
[1:23:55] terrorists
[1:23:57] right
[1:23:59] it's coming down it's coming slowly but
[1:24:00] it's coming surely
[1:24:02] the bible said they won't be able to buy
[1:24:04] or sell well we can all sell anything on
[1:24:06] right we can sell anything on
[1:24:08] uh craigslist right now that's what
[1:24:09] benjamin gandy does he sells his
[1:24:11] services on craigslist i used to buy
[1:24:13] things and sell things on craigslist but
[1:24:14] there's coming a time
[1:24:16] right where they're going to push what
[1:24:17] you can't even sell on craigslist
[1:24:19] without the mark
[1:24:20] and brother brahma said it's thus saith
[1:24:22] the lord it's the confederation of
[1:24:24] churches he said you'll belong to a
[1:24:26] church union or you won't be able to buy
[1:24:28] or sell it's coming down to the church
[1:24:30] that you're a part of and thank god
[1:24:31] we're not so much part of a church
[1:24:33] denomination
[1:24:34] yeah our church is registered in
[1:24:35] columbus but that's just our physical
[1:24:38] church we're part of a bigger church
[1:24:40] we're part of a spiritual church we're
[1:24:42] part of the mount zion church amen the
[1:24:44] church of the first lord and we're in it
[1:24:46] by the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:24:49] and they can't shut down that church
[1:24:51] amen they can't lock the doors of that
[1:24:53] church because it's the doors of heaven
[1:24:55] hallelujah
[1:24:57] and the bible said jesus will open a
[1:24:58] door in heaven and we'll step up in the
[1:25:00] rapture
[1:25:01] hallelujah they can't shut that door
[1:25:03] hallelujah
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:07] before they lay down the mark jesus will
[1:25:09] rapture the bride off the earth amen
[1:25:11] that's exactly right he said i'll keep
[1:25:13] you from the our temptation that will
[1:25:14] come upon the entire world
[1:25:17] because you kept the word of my patience
[1:25:21] revelation 3 10. oh sorry
[1:25:24] wrong button
[1:25:25] so i kind of
[1:25:26] clean these up a little bit the first
[1:25:28] reason why does mount zion type the
[1:25:30] rapture it's a time of total unity
[1:25:33] all the weed is gathered
[1:25:35] on the threshing floor
[1:25:37] glory
[1:25:38] and the bible says the fivefold ministry
[1:25:41] is is used by god until we're all in the
[1:25:44] unity of faith unto a stature of a
[1:25:45] perfect man
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:48] remember brother adam gave us a quote
[1:25:50] denominations will break down before the
[1:25:52] rapture thus saith the lord amongst the
[1:25:53] bride
[1:25:55] so this unity in david's time is the
[1:25:57] same unity as the beginning when
[1:25:59] joshua's group was unified now look at
[1:26:00] that outfit omega brother
[1:26:02] in other words the the omega church
[1:26:05] must be unified just like the alpha
[1:26:07] church amen in other words joshua they
[1:26:09] were totally united praise god
[1:26:12] but it wasn't their time to take the
[1:26:14] capital for the king to live on the
[1:26:16] earth praise god but they were totally
[1:26:18] united praise god remember aiken was the
[1:26:19] only one who wasn't but he was kicked
[1:26:21] out of the church amen hallelujah
[1:26:23] because he had the wrong garments all
[1:26:25] right he'd have the wedding garments on
[1:26:27] hallelujah but the alpha church had
[1:26:29] total unity and here's the omega church
[1:26:31] with total unity there's going to be
[1:26:33] unity in the bride and then jesus says
[1:26:36] i'm pulling you up to heaven because
[1:26:37] we're all a family amen
[1:26:41] hallelujah
[1:26:43] thank god
[1:26:45] so it's alpha
[1:26:48] omega that's why in joel chapter two
[1:26:51] remember it talks about the the bride
[1:26:54] the fullness of pentecost will be in
[1:26:55] there thus saith the lord see it's got
[1:26:57] to be on the same baptism holy ghost
[1:26:59] they had we've got to have it too
[1:27:01] alpha omega
[1:27:03] number two they defeated the invincible
[1:27:05] stronghold at a showdown dave was mocked
[1:27:08] we're gonna be mocked the bible said
[1:27:09] they're gonna mock us peter said they're
[1:27:10] gonna mock us where's your god i thought
[1:27:12] he's coming at the end time
[1:27:14] right they're gonna mock us too
[1:27:17] taking the jerusalem stronghold types
[1:27:18] the holy ghostfield church conquering
[1:27:20] the last enemy death
[1:27:22] which has been a stronghold since the
[1:27:24] church was born
[1:27:25] because death is going to be swallowed
[1:27:27] up in victory at the rapture
[1:27:29] did you catch that jesus is even jesus's
[1:27:32] resurrection uh with the saints wasn't
[1:27:35] death swallowed up in victory
[1:27:37] it's when all the saints praise god all
[1:27:39] the saints meet jesus in the air and all
[1:27:42] the dead bodies are raised when the dead
[1:27:45] in christ rise and all those old dead
[1:27:47] bodies are restored and we get new
[1:27:50] bodies then the saying is brought to
[1:27:53] pass death is swallowed up in victory
[1:27:55] amen
[1:27:56] hallelujah when the body when the body
[1:27:59] of brother brown gets resurrected amen
[1:28:01] when the body of martin luther and john
[1:28:03] wesley gets resurrected then death is
[1:28:06] swallowed up in life hallelujah
[1:28:09] and we're a part of that by god's grace
[1:28:12] amen
[1:28:14] i thought death was invincible not quite
[1:28:17] because jesus defeated him once and
[1:28:18] jesus is going to help the rest of us to
[1:28:20] feed it again amen
[1:28:22] hallelujah
[1:28:24] enoch and elijah proved it's defeatable
[1:28:26] as well hallelujah
[1:28:29] the stronghold is strong
[1:28:31] it's kept out many believers from
[1:28:33] possessing the city of god but the true
[1:28:35] bride is going to possess the city of
[1:28:37] god
[1:28:38] hallelujah
[1:28:41] number three the king didn't take the
[1:28:42] city but his wisdom through his servants
[1:28:44] did
[1:28:45] jesus christ
[1:28:47] right is gonna work through us
[1:28:49] to finish the mystery of god
[1:28:52] see david himself didn't take it but
[1:28:53] joab did it by david's wisdom so jesus
[1:28:56] physical body doesn't defeat the last
[1:28:58] enemy but jesus spirit and the church
[1:29:01] defeats the last enemy
[1:29:02] because the bride has made herself ready
[1:29:06] through the holy spirit and she's the
[1:29:08] wise version right she knows the wise
[1:29:10] things of jesus so she takes what he
[1:29:12] says gets her lamp ready gets all the
[1:29:15] extra oil ready and then she goes out to
[1:29:17] meet him because she's ready for the
[1:29:19] rapture
[1:29:24] the king is in the like the king we're
[1:29:25] going to the procession right the king's
[1:29:27] not the physical body of the king's not
[1:29:29] with us but we're going to see him
[1:29:32] through his wisdom
[1:29:34] and he's made us ready
[1:29:36] hallelujah hallelujah thank god number
[1:29:39] four we also it also ties the rapture
[1:29:41] because they have the secret to victory
[1:29:44] david took it through a secret passage
[1:29:46] the bride has the secret things they
[1:29:49] belong to us and our children
[1:29:53] the secret things belong to us david had
[1:29:55] the secret
[1:29:56] plus we have the finished mystery of god
[1:29:58] other churches don't have that
[1:30:00] thank god there's some people hungry for
[1:30:01] it amen
[1:30:03] but they don't have it
[1:30:04] and then the bible said enter into your
[1:30:06] prayer your closet and pray give alms in
[1:30:08] secret do these things in secret and god
[1:30:11] will reward you openly
[1:30:14] so it's the secret things that bring us
[1:30:16] victory praise god and like brother can
[1:30:18] preach john had to go take the book amen
[1:30:22] just like job had to go take the city
[1:30:24] amen and jesus said the violent take the
[1:30:27] kingdom by force amen
[1:30:30] in other words we've got to wait till we
[1:30:31] get the kingdom called praise god right
[1:30:33] and then we know in the rapture the god
[1:30:35] will let us know when the rapture comes
[1:30:36] but we know what to do right now take
[1:30:38] this book and eat it up praise god enjoy
[1:30:41] all the revelations say praise the lord
[1:30:43] feast on this word because you become
[1:30:45] the word
[1:30:47] take it and eat it up praise god that's
[1:30:50] how i tell my children we've got to
[1:30:51] spend more time reading the bible praise
[1:30:52] god
[1:30:53] we enjoy listening to audio and things
[1:30:55] like that but we got to take the book
[1:30:57] and eat it up by god's grace
[1:31:00] hallelujah sorry that's mike let's find
[1:31:02] my car who's got my keys zion probably
[1:31:04] took him
[1:31:04] bless his heart zion
[1:31:06] bless his heart
[1:31:08] or maybe it's me i don't know i don't
[1:31:09] have anything on me
[1:31:11] thank you lydia good job
[1:31:13] oh thank you so desire thank you
[1:31:16] the shot of the king all right
[1:31:18] number five last one the victory at uh
[1:31:22] the jebusite stronghold ushered in the
[1:31:24] physical reign of the king
[1:31:29] in priest words when david got the
[1:31:31] victory then he brought the ark or the
[1:31:33] shekinah glory came into the city of god
[1:31:37] right
[1:31:38] after the unity and the defeat of the
[1:31:39] jebusites
[1:31:41] so that means church
[1:31:43] hallelujah
[1:31:44] after we go in the rapture what's going
[1:31:45] to happen we're going to live the
[1:31:47] shekinah glory of christ comes in
[1:31:50] into us amongst us and are never going
[1:31:52] to leave us
[1:31:53] once david got it in there the glory of
[1:31:55] god was there and he lived in the prince
[1:31:57] of god
[1:31:59] right once david got in there now he
[1:32:01] fulfilled the king and priest type
[1:32:04] once the rapture goes once we defeat
[1:32:05] that last enemy death the shekinah glory
[1:32:08] is forever with us
[1:32:12] beautiful praise god
[1:32:16] now remember that's what i'm telling i
[1:32:17] think i think i said this on wednesday
[1:32:19] sometimes there's types but they're
[1:32:21] incomplete types right just like rahab
[1:32:23] rehab is a type of the rapture but all
[1:32:25] the events afterwards don't really type
[1:32:27] the rapture just that one event
[1:32:29] right because you had a shout and you
[1:32:30] had a trump i didn't see a voice but you
[1:32:32] had to shout into trump
[1:32:33] not sure what the voice is i'm still
[1:32:34] looking for that one
[1:32:36] and so because we see a gentile woman
[1:32:39] saved from total destruction through the
[1:32:41] token
[1:32:42] so we see the same thing here we have
[1:32:44] the final in undefeatable enemy defeated
[1:32:49] by the the direction of the high kingdom
[1:32:52] priest amen hallelujah
[1:32:54] and it brings it brought unity and it
[1:32:56] brought the prince of god
[1:32:58] and it was a showdown that was only
[1:33:01] accomplished through the secret things
[1:33:02] of god
[1:33:06] revelation 10 7 amen
[1:33:08] the mystery of god must be finished and
[1:33:10] then broadcast to every nation
[1:33:12] hallelujah
[1:33:14] see
[1:33:16] now i see at least two meetings what do
[1:33:18] you mean about the showdown brother jess
[1:33:19] well first there's a showdown is the is
[1:33:21] the bride or is the denomination going
[1:33:23] to have
[1:33:25] the born-again experience because
[1:33:26] remember the bible said when you come to
[1:33:28] this mountain showdown
[1:33:30] see that you not refuse the baptism of
[1:33:32] the holy ghost
[1:33:35] see go to hebrews 4 1. i wrote this down
[1:33:37] for a reason go to hebrews 4 1.
[1:33:44] oh my
[1:33:47] hebrews 4 1.
[1:33:51] thank you for your patience here hope
[1:33:53] it's been a blessing so far
[1:33:55] praise god
[1:33:56] hebrews 4 1
[1:33:58] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[1:34:00] being left us of entering into his rest
[1:34:03] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:34:05] it
[1:34:08] now go down to verse 11. that's what i
[1:34:09] mentioned on
[1:34:11] i think last sunday let us therefore i'm
[1:34:14] sure let us labor therefore to enter in
[1:34:16] his rest lest any man fall after the
[1:34:18] same example of unbelief
[1:34:21] in other words it you have to work at it
[1:34:23] at overcoming your flesh
[1:34:25] if you want the baptism of the holy
[1:34:26] ghost in your soul you've got to fight
[1:34:28] against the flesh
[1:34:30] you've got the labor in your mind
[1:34:33] and over to in order to overcome the
[1:34:35] flesh so you can obey the commandments
[1:34:37] of god and be born again
[1:34:39] it is a gift but you've got to show god
[1:34:41] you're going to accept that gift amen i
[1:34:43] don't know you got to accept the gift
[1:34:45] amen
[1:34:46] hallelujah god don't force the gift on
[1:34:48] you he said very few will find it why
[1:34:49] don't why don't they find it because
[1:34:50] they're not looking for it
[1:34:52] they don't want to live a sanctified
[1:34:53] life right they don't want the baptism
[1:34:55] of holy ghost people don't want that
[1:34:57] so it's a gift but you have to accept it
[1:34:59] and you have to work your way towards
[1:35:01] the promised land amen the bible said
[1:35:03] labor that's what i mean and grace
[1:35:05] labors
[1:35:07] paul said i labored more than all of
[1:35:08] them not me but the grace of god which
[1:35:11] was with me
[1:35:13] because works are an expression of faith
[1:35:15] and faith moves by love so if you love
[1:35:17] god you'll let the grace of god move
[1:35:19] through your life work through your life
[1:35:20] and you will make the promised land i'm
[1:35:22] bound for the promised land who will
[1:35:24] come and go with me i'm bound for the
[1:35:26] promised land amen
[1:35:28] hallelujah who's willing to labor and
[1:35:30] overcome their flesh
[1:35:33] so i can see two showdowns one the
[1:35:35] showdown of who will be born again
[1:35:37] it's gonna be the creeds and
[1:35:38] denominations or it's gonna be jesus
[1:35:40] bride oh you know it's going to be
[1:35:42] christ's bride
[1:35:44] also there's another showdown
[1:35:46] who will defeat death and denomination
[1:35:50] right because that's that's the
[1:35:51] impenetrable enemy
[1:35:54] see it's a type of david taking the
[1:35:56] mount zion castle because it was
[1:35:58] impossible supposedly to defeat the
[1:36:01] castle but the castle represents a
[1:36:03] permanent dwelling of the bridegroom and
[1:36:05] bride
[1:36:07] so who's going to be the soldiers that
[1:36:09] really want to see
[1:36:10] christ and the bride become one
[1:36:13] who are going to be the warriors because
[1:36:14] they're going to make this a reality i'm
[1:36:15] going to live so close to christ that
[1:36:17] we're going to be one together amen
[1:36:20] who in other words who's so hungry to
[1:36:23] live in unity with jesus christ that
[1:36:25] every day that they'll fight for it amen
[1:36:27] they'll do the secret things of god in
[1:36:29] order to have this unity this permanent
[1:36:31] dwelling place with christ in the
[1:36:33] rapture
[1:36:35] oh i hope i hope the holy spirit uh
[1:36:37] gives you the interpretation i might be
[1:36:39] chopping it up but may the holy ghost
[1:36:40] give you the revelation of it
[1:36:42] in other words it's through the secret
[1:36:44] things of god that you access the divine
[1:36:47] presence of god
[1:36:49] hallelujah
[1:36:55] thank the lord
[1:36:59] so let's look at david's acts following
[1:37:01] the jerusalem victory
[1:37:02] now we all looked at one here sorry
[1:37:04] the first thing he did after getting the
[1:37:06] jerusalem victory so the first thing
[1:37:07] when he was king he went to jerusalem he
[1:37:09] won it then the next thing he did was
[1:37:11] bring the ark in and he wore the ephod
[1:37:13] it's like an apron-like priest garment
[1:37:17] and this fulfilled the priesthood
[1:37:19] requirement of the type of melchizedek
[1:37:23] he already fulfilled the king type he
[1:37:24] was already king
[1:37:27] but he had to fulfill the priesthood
[1:37:29] requirement
[1:37:31] because he had to inquire of the lord as
[1:37:33] a priest he had to be the intercessor
[1:37:36] for israel
[1:37:38] right
[1:37:39] and every time he did this he was
[1:37:41] undefeated
[1:37:43] every time he went before the ark and
[1:37:45] said great holy spirit
[1:37:46] he would no doubt worship and offer
[1:37:48] sacrifices do we go up to ziklag or do
[1:37:50] we go up against the philistines do we
[1:37:52] go up against all this every time he
[1:37:54] interceded for i want your people to be
[1:37:56] safe i don't want your people to die i
[1:37:58] want your people to be saved every time
[1:38:00] he interceded as a priest god answered
[1:38:03] his prayer
[1:38:04] oh hallelujah may that encourage us to
[1:38:07] go before the throne of god and bring
[1:38:09] others before the throne of god in
[1:38:11] intercession
[1:38:19] so david said he talks to all of israel
[1:38:21] he said verse 3 let us bring again the
[1:38:23] ark of our god to us for we inquire not
[1:38:25] at it in the days of saul
[1:38:27] in other words under the denominational
[1:38:29] days we weren't really in tune with the
[1:38:31] prince of god saul wasn't seeking god
[1:38:33] but we're going to be a generation that
[1:38:35] seeks god
[1:38:36] i didn't know yeah we were generally my
[1:38:38] parents might not have sought god they
[1:38:40] never didn't seek the face of god but
[1:38:42] we're going to be a generation that we
[1:38:44] enjoy the presence of god we seek the
[1:38:46] presence of god and we find it amazing
[1:38:49] how do you want to be that generation
[1:38:51] amen david said i will not repeat the
[1:38:54] heirs of my father's brother man
[1:38:56] and our grandfathers we will not repeat
[1:38:58] the heirs of that but we will live in
[1:39:00] the presence of god
[1:39:02] amen i will inquire of god about my job
[1:39:06] i'll inquire of god about my children
[1:39:08] i'll inquire of god about every decision
[1:39:10] i make because that's what the ark is
[1:39:12] for amen
[1:39:14] the bible said you were chosen for god's
[1:39:17] good pleasure you're not here for your
[1:39:19] pleasure you're here for god's pleasure
[1:39:21] amen
[1:39:22] and the only way to know that is to seek
[1:39:24] the ark of god amen
[1:39:26] hallelujah to seek the mind of christ
[1:39:30] the perfect will of god that's what
[1:39:32] david wanted he wanted god's heart more
[1:39:34] than his own
[1:39:36] is that right church
[1:39:40] that's why i love it when you go when
[1:39:41] all you all you once bring up your
[1:39:43] children or bring up your husbands bring
[1:39:44] up your wives that's the right way to do
[1:39:46] it
[1:39:46] that's that's bringing your your request
[1:39:48] before the ark of god
[1:39:50] right the word of god in other words
[1:39:52] lord jesus i need healing or i need
[1:39:54] victory here i need your guidance i
[1:39:56] don't want to take a misstep i want to
[1:39:57] be in the perfect will of god and i'm
[1:39:59] willing to show everybody that i want to
[1:40:01] live in your presence amen i don't care
[1:40:03] who's around all of us i know is that
[1:40:05] i'm in your presence and i want thus
[1:40:07] saith the lord
[1:40:10] hallelujah
[1:40:16] here's a man he said one thing i've
[1:40:17] desired that i may dwell in the house of
[1:40:19] the lord
[1:40:21] to behold his beauty
[1:40:24] and inquire in his temple
[1:40:27] see because he wants to be ready in the
[1:40:28] time of trouble in other words if you
[1:40:31] pray to god when there's easy times
[1:40:33] god's going to keep you in the tough
[1:40:34] times hallelujah because you thought
[1:40:38] jesus was beautiful and god is beautiful
[1:40:40] because you spent all these easy times
[1:40:42] in god's presence david said i know he's
[1:40:44] gonna keep me in the hard times
[1:40:47] i know there's a benefit to serving god
[1:40:49] amen
[1:40:50] i know if i re if i sow i shall reap
[1:40:53] praise god be not deceived god is not
[1:40:56] mocked if you dwell in the house of god
[1:40:58] god will protect you hallelujah amen
[1:41:02] and this brother answer this is the
[1:41:03] rapture scripture
[1:41:06] that's what look at the rapture 1965.
[1:41:08] this is brotherham's text
[1:41:11] see you want to inquire you want to know
[1:41:13] the mind of god so you stay in god's
[1:41:16] presence in the house of god
[1:41:18] and the time of trouble he'll hide you
[1:41:20] look in the secret of his tabernacle the
[1:41:22] secret
[1:41:24] all god's secrets hallelujah he makes
[1:41:25] known his secrets to you
[1:41:27] and he shall set me up on a rock there
[1:41:29] it is the rock zion the mountain right
[1:41:32] up up on iraq on a mountain the
[1:41:34] spiritual mount where in other words
[1:41:35] we're on the mount zion rock today
[1:41:37] praise god
[1:41:38] hallelujah
[1:41:40] now i got this from a website david was
[1:41:42] called of god to function in both a
[1:41:44] kingly and priestly capacity
[1:41:47] as king david was also claiming to be a
[1:41:48] priest
[1:41:49] clearly david saw himself serving the
[1:41:51] lord as a priest in order of melchizedek
[1:41:54] so a priesthood that was both priestly
[1:41:56] and kingly he had no right to serve as a
[1:41:59] priest under aaron's order
[1:42:01] but as a priest in melchizedek's order
[1:42:03] he was given divine permission to place
[1:42:05] the ark in open view sit before it and
[1:42:08] minister to it
[1:42:10] so god made a special area of grace so
[1:42:13] david and them he wasn't even a priest
[1:42:15] but he could live in the pride he could
[1:42:16] dance in the presence of the ark church
[1:42:18] he could dance and sing praises and
[1:42:20] shout and worship god in the presence of
[1:42:23] the ark which usually was only for high
[1:42:25] priest but god was showing there's
[1:42:27] coming a day hallelujah when the real
[1:42:29] kingdom priests after the order of
[1:42:31] melchizedek will come down to the earth
[1:42:33] and you have a thousand years of peace
[1:42:36] in the city of peace hallelujah
[1:42:39] thank god amen
[1:42:41] he rules in the city of peace and peace
[1:42:44] flows out to the entire world
[1:42:47] through this city of peace
[1:42:51] oh thank god
[1:42:54] now look i like this
[1:42:56] while he was serving in a priest
[1:42:58] capacity david was shown the messiah
[1:43:00] would serve before god in the same
[1:43:02] priesthood
[1:43:03] that's why david wrote in psalm 110 the
[1:43:05] lord has sworn and will not relent you
[1:43:07] are a priest forever after the order of
[1:43:10] melchizedek
[1:43:12] so while he was king and priest god
[1:43:13] showed him there's coming another one
[1:43:15] there's coming a greater king and priest
[1:43:17] than me and he will rule the world in
[1:43:19] righteousness
[1:43:21] he said i'm just fulfilling a type and
[1:43:22] if the type feels this good what about
[1:43:24] that one brother oh what about a
[1:43:26] thousand years of peace amen what about
[1:43:28] a thousand years of no temptation of
[1:43:30] total joy of total victory amen a total
[1:43:34] of just blessings of god that's what
[1:43:36] we're promised as we honor christ after
[1:43:38] the melchizedek order today
[1:43:41] how many enjoy that
[1:43:45] see david had a zeal for zion because he
[1:43:47] knew there's coming another ruler of
[1:43:49] zion who's way greater than me
[1:43:55] jerusalem is a city like no other it's
[1:43:57] the only place on earth god chose as his
[1:43:59] eternal home
[1:44:03] why does god why does the earth care so
[1:44:05] much about jerusalem why is it in the
[1:44:07] news all the time because god's eyes and
[1:44:09] interests are riveted on jerusalem and
[1:44:12] but so are satans as well
[1:44:14] that's why those muslims shoot those
[1:44:16] missiles at israel
[1:44:17] they're trying to take that land because
[1:44:19] they know the real messiah is coming
[1:44:21] they want to try to keep him out
[1:44:22] impossible
[1:44:24] the word of god has already gone forth
[1:44:27] and it will not return void
[1:44:30] they think they can defeat it with
[1:44:31] natural bombs and missiles and and
[1:44:34] shooting out all these bullets they
[1:44:35] think they can defeat the almighty
[1:44:37] supernatural god with natural things
[1:44:39] totally impossible praise god because
[1:44:41] the things that are eternal are the
[1:44:43] things not seen amen god's got greater
[1:44:46] spiritual bombs than they got natural
[1:44:48] bombs it's called the sword of his word
[1:44:50] that shoots out of his mouth and
[1:44:52] destroys the enemies
[1:44:54] hallelujah they think they can stop the
[1:44:56] messiah from coming the melchizedek the
[1:44:59] true milk has in it coming praise god
[1:45:01] but they can't do it
[1:45:03] hallelujah
[1:45:05] that's why there's so much warfare there
[1:45:07] all the time bombing and destroying and
[1:45:09] iron domes and all these things because
[1:45:11] that is god's land and he's coming he
[1:45:14] promised i will not forget uh jerusalem
[1:45:16] i will not forget zion
[1:45:19] remember the bible said that i will not
[1:45:20] rest until zion is mine let me pull that
[1:45:22] up there
[1:45:23] from the first sermon i preached
[1:45:27] where's part one
[1:45:29] down here
[1:45:32] okay
[1:45:33] thank you for your patience
[1:45:39] well
[1:45:40] let me see
[1:45:42] we'll just go real quick where is it
[1:45:45] there's a uh it's isaiah where it talks
[1:45:47] about that
[1:45:48] just give me a sec here this should go
[1:45:50] pretty fast
[1:45:52] help me lord where did i put that
[1:45:55] oh it's part one yeah part one sorry
[1:45:57] i know this is into part two
[1:45:59] all right well anyways
[1:46:01] sorry
[1:46:02] he said i will not relent maybe it'll
[1:46:03] just come back up there forgive me
[1:46:06] the bible says isaiah he said i will not
[1:46:09] rest until i made zion my my city praise
[1:46:12] god in other words god is going to
[1:46:14] constantly watch over zion
[1:46:17] the bible the zion represents israel's
[1:46:20] davidic inheritance or the promise of
[1:46:22] god to establish the son of david on the
[1:46:24] throne of zion forever
[1:46:28] yeah i think oh yeah here it is right
[1:46:29] here i skipped all around to find this
[1:46:31] for zion's sake i will not hold my peace
[1:46:33] and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest
[1:46:34] see god is not resting until her
[1:46:37] righteousness goes forth as a brightness
[1:46:39] and her salvation as a lamp that burns
[1:46:42] god is not going to rest until that city
[1:46:44] of jerusalem shines forth the love of
[1:46:46] jesus christ
[1:46:48] right now it's all wars but that can all
[1:46:50] change in a matter of moments
[1:46:52] that can all change in the twinkling of
[1:46:54] an eye amen amen hallelujah praise god
[1:46:58] god can change it whenever he wants
[1:47:00] of course he's going to let the two
[1:47:01] prophets come and we know the order
[1:47:04] god himself is going to fight without
[1:47:06] rest until jerusalem's righteousness and
[1:47:08] salvation shines brightly in the earth
[1:47:11] david wrote this by the holy ghost
[1:47:13] inspiration thou art a priest forever
[1:47:16] after the order of melchizedek
[1:47:18] and we know the story the second thing
[1:47:20] he did after i'm sure the first thing
[1:47:21] after he got the victory he got on the
[1:47:23] ephod and he started dancing and
[1:47:25] praising the lord because the ark
[1:47:27] there's the ark ark was way up there on
[1:47:29] the shoulders praise god way up above
[1:47:31] hallelujah highly exalted praise god and
[1:47:34] he danced around because he knows wow in
[1:47:36] 3000 years this is going to happen in
[1:47:38] real life the real messiah is going to
[1:47:41] rule here he'll have no enemies that can
[1:47:43] defeat him he'll never sin he'll never
[1:47:45] fall short and he'll rule the world in
[1:47:47] righteousness for the glory of god
[1:47:50] hallelujah
[1:47:51] so this is what david put on david put
[1:47:53] on something like this i don't know if
[1:47:54] you have yurim on or not but he did have
[1:47:56] an e5 which is a blue purple scarf and
[1:47:59] gold
[1:48:01] apron that he had on
[1:48:04] david put that on showing he was a
[1:48:05] priest after the order of melchizedek
[1:48:11] brother mahm said this he said
[1:48:12] melchizedek had no beginning no end no
[1:48:14] father i'm going to skip down he was not
[1:48:16] only a king he was a prince he's the
[1:48:18] prince of peace
[1:48:20] he's a rose of sharon living the valley
[1:48:21] i'm skipping out
[1:48:22] he was before david look at this he was
[1:48:25] in david
[1:48:27] melchizedek jesus christ was in david
[1:48:30] amen
[1:48:31] all right melchizedek had just he wasn't
[1:48:33] jesus christ's body but the spirit of
[1:48:35] god the spirit of jesus was in
[1:48:36] melchizedek so brother man said
[1:48:38] melchizedek's spirit was before david in
[1:48:41] david praise god and after david
[1:48:43] hallelujah
[1:48:44] amen in other words it was christ and
[1:48:47] david saying one day this land will be
[1:48:50] god's land hallelujah
[1:48:52] the whole earth shall be full of the
[1:48:54] glory of the lord amen
[1:48:57] thank god
[1:48:58] look at brother ham said
[1:49:01] brother ram said that goliath's fight he
[1:49:03] knew he was going to win
[1:49:07] can you imagine church
[1:49:09] he wasn't wondering why am i going to
[1:49:10] win this fight or not
[1:49:12] he wasn't scared brother branham said
[1:49:15] watch the prophet david said today i'll
[1:49:17] cut your head off from your shoulder
[1:49:19] amen why he know what he had whom he had
[1:49:22] believed he was fully persuaded he was
[1:49:24] able to keep that which he committed to
[1:49:26] him in other words god by vision
[1:49:29] showed david you're going to get the
[1:49:30] victory that's why he was so bold and
[1:49:32] church that's what god's going to give
[1:49:34] us he's going to give us the word lord
[1:49:36] the spirit of jesus is the spirit of
[1:49:39] prophecy amen think about it if we see
[1:49:41] those saints for a month or more our
[1:49:43] faith is going to be sky high praise god
[1:49:45] we'll know
[1:49:46] that pretty soon the last trump is going
[1:49:48] to go we'll be on fire we're trusting in
[1:49:50] god i don't know how god's going to do
[1:49:52] it but god is going to do it he's going
[1:49:54] to have a people that are ready for the
[1:49:55] coming of the lord praise god and they
[1:49:57] will have thy saith the lord
[1:49:59] just like david knew i'm going to get
[1:50:00] the victory
[1:50:03] he was a prophet
[1:50:05] that's why he knew it
[1:50:07] enoch knew about his rapture uh here we
[1:50:09] go
[1:50:10] elijah knew about his rapture
[1:50:13] jesus knew about his rapture and they
[1:50:15] always knew about the rapture so will we
[1:50:18] praise god
[1:50:23] what did elijah say at the mount carmel
[1:50:24] showdown he said i've done all this
[1:50:26] according to thy word in other words
[1:50:27] that's why elijah could mock those guys
[1:50:29] because he knew what was going to happen
[1:50:32] the spirit of prophecy had told him
[1:50:34] and church we know what's going to
[1:50:35] happen america is going to change the
[1:50:37] laws with the churches and they're going
[1:50:39] to make a one-world church we know it's
[1:50:41] going to happen we just got to stay out
[1:50:42] of that and if we stay out of that then
[1:50:44] we're already in the spiritual mount
[1:50:46] zion amen
[1:50:47] hallelujah praise god
[1:50:49] we know it's going to happen hallelujah
[1:50:52] just like they knew
[1:50:56] at thy word lord i have preached all
[1:50:58] these things
[1:51:00] at thy word i've sung all these songs
[1:51:03] and thy word i've got granddaughters to
[1:51:05] be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:51:07] jesus christ
[1:51:08] and thy word we've done all these things
[1:51:10] amen
[1:51:11] we've kept the word
[1:51:13] and god has blessed us with faith
[1:51:15] hallelujah
[1:51:17] they knew the outcome
[1:51:18] because of vision
[1:51:21] the eyes of the lord see that's why we
[1:51:22] got eyes out so we can see
[1:51:24] ah i see the devil in the roman catholic
[1:51:25] church i see the communism brotherhood
[1:51:27] said the communism is just a tool in the
[1:51:28] hand of the devil
[1:51:30] like that's what they're trying to bring
[1:51:31] in with these 4.5 trillion dollar bills
[1:51:34] they're trying to bring in communism let
[1:51:35] them bring it in
[1:51:36] i don't know what's going to happen i
[1:51:38] don't i'm praying against it though
[1:51:40] right but that's just a tool in the hand
[1:51:42] of god brother i said don't let that
[1:51:44] deceive you you just keep your eyes on
[1:51:46] that purple curtain amen in other words
[1:51:48] keep your eyes on jesus and fight your
[1:51:50] enemy
[1:51:51] don't get your eyes off the enemy
[1:51:56] look at this church
[1:51:58] after he brought in the ark look at this
[1:52:00] though this is so beautiful
[1:52:02] david
[1:52:03] established a worship that moses never
[1:52:05] did
[1:52:07] david got all these instruments together
[1:52:09] and he raised up all these singers moses
[1:52:11] never had it
[1:52:13] but david started a brand new music
[1:52:15] ministry
[1:52:17] because he said i know god needs to be
[1:52:19] praised day and night
[1:52:22] because in revelation 4 verse 8 the
[1:52:24] bible said the angels cry holy holy holy
[1:52:28] day and night before the lord jesus
[1:52:30] christ amen
[1:52:32] look what david said he said we have
[1:52:34] sons of korah and these men are singers
[1:52:36] they're the chief of their fathers for
[1:52:38] they were employed in the work day and
[1:52:40] night in other words david was so under
[1:52:43] the anointing as a type of the
[1:52:45] priesthood of melchizedek he said we've
[1:52:47] got to start all night worship we've got
[1:52:49] to start all night praise unto god he
[1:52:51] said because i'm copying what's going on
[1:52:54] in heaven praise god
[1:52:56] i'm such a type of jesus christ that i
[1:52:58] want total worship for the for god
[1:53:00] almighty on the earth let it be done on
[1:53:03] earth as it is in heaven praise god
[1:53:06] oh hallelujah what a type moses didn't
[1:53:08] do this but david established this
[1:53:11] because he was a prefigure of the
[1:53:12] millennium
[1:53:18] and they rest not day or night saying
[1:53:20] holy
[1:53:21] holy holy is the lord god almighty which
[1:53:24] was and is and is to come
[1:53:27] it's kind of hard to stop right now so
[1:53:29] just bear with me here
[1:53:35] let me uh
[1:53:42] let me close with this
[1:53:44] why is why is this so close to us
[1:53:47] why is it so important to us
[1:53:48] because under jesus's pre-or melchizedek
[1:53:52] priesthood he makes us kings and priests
[1:53:55] as well
[1:53:58] did anybody catch that during the first
[1:53:59] two sermons i'm saying how david the
[1:54:01] king and priest melchizedek king and
[1:54:03] priests did that scripture come to our
[1:54:04] minds
[1:54:05] that's what god wants to make you
[1:54:07] because he said the bride will be a
[1:54:08] kingdom of priests
[1:54:11] unto god that's why your prayers are so
[1:54:14] essential
[1:54:15] that's why your songs are so essential
[1:54:18] hallelujah
[1:54:21] church every chance we get no matter
[1:54:22] whether it's a special minister or not
[1:54:24] we should be praising the lord with all
[1:54:26] of our hearts amen whether it's a
[1:54:28] special preacher not you should be amen
[1:54:30] in the word as hard as you can
[1:54:32] because it's not so much about the man
[1:54:35] it's about the fact that jesus christ is
[1:54:37] high priest now and he's called each and
[1:54:39] one of you to be a priest and king unto
[1:54:42] god
[1:54:44] hallelujah
[1:54:45] so we have one great jesus christ king
[1:54:47] and priest who's making all of us kings
[1:54:49] and priests unto god
[1:54:53] and now it makes sense
[1:54:55] all these years i've wondered why are we
[1:54:56] kings and priests because god is giving
[1:54:58] us a taste of what is to come
[1:55:01] right if you're faithful with a little
[1:55:02] here he said i'll make a ruler over much
[1:55:06] if you can be a spiritual kingdom priest
[1:55:07] here god will make you a natural kingdom
[1:55:10] priest over there in the millennium
[1:55:14] how many understand that you ever ever
[1:55:15] understand that by god's grace
[1:55:17] now it makes sense
[1:55:19] because he's establishing a priesthood
[1:55:22] he's establishing a group of
[1:55:23] intercessors he's establishing a group
[1:55:26] of eternal worshipers
[1:55:30] he's establishing an eternal group of
[1:55:32] kings
[1:55:33] who can rule with his character
[1:55:37] and can worship
[1:55:38] and intercede
[1:55:40] so he will be pleased
[1:55:46] two scriptures say we're kings and
[1:55:47] priests unto god this scripture says we
[1:55:49] reign in life we reign in life by christ
[1:55:52] jesus
[1:55:54] we reign in life
[1:55:57] first peter two five i don't know that
[1:55:59] one i'm gonna look it up i just forgot
[1:56:00] that one let me look at it first peter 2
[1:56:01] 5.
[1:56:03] just hold you a little bit longer here
[1:56:04] by god's grace
[1:56:07] i just want to finish this thought if i
[1:56:08] can please
[1:56:10] hebrews james first and second peter
[1:56:13] first peter 2 5
[1:56:15] yes ye also has lively stones
[1:56:18] or build up a spiritual house a holy
[1:56:20] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:56:22] sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus
[1:56:24] christ
[1:56:27] see god that now there it is again
[1:56:28] church we got to have the right
[1:56:29] sacrifice right how many want your your
[1:56:31] sacrifices to be acceptable
[1:56:33] so you got to worship in spirit and in
[1:56:36] truth
[1:56:37] right
[1:56:38] hebrews 13 15.
[1:56:48] hebrews 13 15.
[1:56:49] remember this you're probably familiar
[1:56:51] with this
[1:56:52] now look at verse 15 i love it i love
