[0:00] verse 27 I'd like to preach again on
[0:03] personal Revival and I'll take it out of
[0:05] this text here Isaiah chapter 10 verse
[0:09] 27.
[0:11] yeah I know these a little bit of a
[0:13] review here but I believe they're
[0:14] important for us
[0:16] especially having a personal Revival
[0:20] reminded of how David said you lead me
[0:22] beside Green Pastures you restore my
[0:25] soul praise God
[0:26] he was constantly being restored
[0:29] Hallelujah
[0:32] Isaiah chapter 10 verse 27 I was
[0:36] listening to a sermon the other day and
[0:37] I thought wow I never think I really
[0:39] preached real deeply on this sermon or
[0:41] this scripture right here so I I thought
[0:43] it tied in pretty well with uh the
[0:45] thought on personal Revival by the grace
[0:47] of God so I trust would be a blessing to
[0:50] you
[0:52] and Lord willing tonight if Jeannie
[0:54] comes again I'll I think I'm going to
[0:56] preach because last week I preached
[1:00] so children I apologize in advance if I
[1:02] can't do some teaching tonight
[1:04] uh because she so received it
[1:07] so if she comes tonight I'm going to
[1:08] preach by God's grace and I'll get into
[1:11] water baptism Lord willing and the
[1:13] modesty and
[1:15] these Revelations the specific
[1:17] Revelations that you know God has set
[1:19] apart for his bride praise God so
[1:23] um
[1:24] you know it's interesting you know I
[1:25] came in through the serpent seat you
[1:27] know and of course in water baptism but
[1:29] everybody comes in a different way you
[1:31] know so just want to be led by the
[1:32] spirit and she looked at me last week I
[1:34] was praying up here for her before I
[1:36] prayed and she said God spoke through
[1:38] you mightily today
[1:40] she said I have never heard a sermon
[1:41] like that and she was weeping and crying
[1:43] she wanted prayer for her
[1:45] her nine children to be saved
[1:48] but she said God spoke to Austin and
[1:50] then God spoke through me and God was
[1:53] dealing with her so we'll see if she
[1:54] continues to yield to the Holy Spirit
[1:56] aren't you glad you yielded though
[1:57] praise God
[1:58] and let's pray that shall yield as well
[2:01] Isaiah 10 27 let's read this if we can
[2:03] on three one two three and it shall come
[2:06] to pass in that day that his burden
[2:10] shall be taken away from off thy
[2:13] shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck
[2:16] and the Yoke shall be destroyed because
[2:20] of the anointing let's have one more
[2:21] word of prayer how many you need the
[2:22] anointing of the Lord today

[4:01] Sheep of your pasture Lord God and I
[4:03] pray you lead them to steal Waters and
[4:05] green grass the Lord God Green Pastures
[4:07] Lord God restore our souls today we ask
[4:10] it in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[4:12] said amen God bless you you're being
[4:14] seated praise God
[4:18] Hallelujah I have some quotes I like to
[4:21] show so you can switch over there
[4:22] whenever you're ready by the grace of
[4:24] the Lord
[4:26] so you want to take a few thoughts here
[4:28] today and I don't like I said there's a
[4:29] little bit of a review but I feel it's
[4:31] important you know like I said this
[4:34] thought was placed on my heart you know
[4:35] before brother amen and sister who had
[4:37] that Revival that he had praise God and
[4:40] then others thought it worked out really
[4:42] well
[4:43] and uh
[4:45] I constantly see this in my life as well
[4:47] the need for continual Revival by the
[4:51] grace of the Lord
[4:52] and so I would like to look at this here
[4:54] one more time here I don't know if I'll
[4:56] be on this next week or not
[4:58] we'll see how the Lord directs here by
[5:00] the Holy Spirit
[5:02] so we want to look at how the anointing
[5:04] breaks the Yokes a personal Revival just
[5:08] a short very short series here we've
[5:10] been of course looking at Revival we
[5:12] looked at the Four kinds of Revival and
[5:13] then you know as I was preaching I
[5:14] realized it was six
[5:15] and so revive means to to cause to grow
[5:18] to bring strength again to renew
[5:20] strength to restore life praise God and
[5:24] so I'm going to skip past those and
[5:26] um
[5:27] remember church that this revival that
[5:29] God sent to us this is the blessing that
[5:33] was for us
[5:35] the fact that you and I can be revived
[5:37] is God's blessing to you amen God told
[5:41] Abraham I'm going to bless the whole
[5:42] world through you Abraham
[5:45] and so many people just see natural
[5:47] blessings that's all they want to see is
[5:49] natural blessings but there's so much
[5:51] more than that
[5:53] because the natural blessings you cannot
[5:55] take with you praise God
[5:56] to the next uh the next World praise God
[5:59] the next Dimension you can't take those
[6:01] but what you can take is the spiritual
[6:03] blessings praise God
[6:05] because you can store up Treasures in
[6:07] Heaven you know when you leave this
[6:08] earth by God's grace you'll have uh
[6:11] you'll have a welcome in heaven you'll
[6:13] have Treasures in Heaven praise God
[6:15] hallelujah
[6:16] and of course you'll take your spirit
[6:18] and your soul with you Hallelujah and
[6:21] all the Godly character that's been
[6:22] built up in your life will go with you
[6:24] praise God
[6:26] just as the Sinners all their human
[6:28] Spirit remains all their immoral
[6:30] character remains we know in the in the
[6:32] Lake of Fire or not like if I rather but
[6:34] in the in in hell and gehenna in the
[6:36] prison house their wicked character
[6:39] remains so our Godly character will
[6:41] remain when we go to be with Jesus
[6:43] Hallelujah
[6:44] and so this blessing of course is The
[6:46] Blessing of Abraham the Bible said Jesus
[6:49] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[6:52] because he was made a curse for us for
[6:55] it is written cursed is everyone that
[6:57] hangs on a tree praise God
[7:00] that The Blessing of Abraham might come
[7:01] on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ
[7:04] that we might receive the promise of the
[7:07] spirit through faith Hallelujah so let's
[7:10] enjoy these blessings amen let's not
[7:13] miss out on this wonderful blessing God
[7:15] has given to us The Fellowship of the
[7:18] Holy Spirit God's spirit able to abide
[7:21] in our thoughts and and we're able to to
[7:23] instead of have our mind instead of
[7:26] thinking our thoughts we can think the
[7:28] thoughts of Christ
[7:30] I'm sure you're like me
[7:32] I get tired of Jesse Smith's thoughts I
[7:35] want to have I don't I get tired of the
[7:37] mind of Jesse Smith I want to have the
[7:38] mind of Christ
[7:40] Hallelujah that's Revival praise God
[7:43] when the mind of Jesus Christ has
[7:46] captured your mind amen
[7:48] and so you're no longer thinking your
[7:50] thoughts you're thinking the thoughts of
[7:51] God hallelujah
[7:54] Church These are the sweetest moments of
[7:56] your life when you're thinking about
[7:57] Jesus Christ
[7:59] when you're meditating and talking about
[8:01] nothing can be sweeter than that praise
[8:03] God the psalmist says it's sweeter than
[8:05] the honey and the honeycomb praise God
[8:10] these thoughts these meditations this is
[8:12] the blessing praise God
[8:14] the blessing is having God's thoughts in
[8:17] the place of Austin's thoughts and place
[8:19] your name in there of Jesse's thoughts
[8:21] and Williams thoughts amen's thoughts
[8:23] the blessing is having the Holy Spirit
[8:27] in your mind Hallelujah you entertaining
[8:30] him you loving him you meditating on him
[8:33] Hallelujah you're focusing on him
[8:36] fellowshipping with him praise God
[8:39] like the cool of the evening praise God
[8:42] how about the chill of the morning you
[8:43] like the cool we like the cool of the
[8:44] evening how about the chill of the
[8:45] morning praise God we saw the frost on
[8:48] the on the ground this morning you know
[8:49] and it's a beautiful still time isn't it
[8:51] you know I love that atmosphere out
[8:53] there in the still of the morning praise
[8:55] God
[8:58] but this is the blessing church that we
[9:00] could be revived and that God's spirit
[9:03] could fill our thoughts Hallelujah
[9:06] instead of the cares of this world as we
[9:08] saw last week because that's the great
[9:09] battle the great battle is are we going
[9:11] to have cares of the world or are we
[9:13] going to have a good and honest heart
[9:15] praise God
[9:16] are we going to choose to be revived or
[9:19] are you going to choose to care about
[9:20] the things of the world
[9:23] that's the test praise God that's a test
[9:25] how many pass in the test by God's grace
[9:27] Glory
[9:29] I got yeah I got my ups and downs but
[9:31] I'm Overcoming By God's grace I know
[9:33] that Hallelujah
[9:36] the Bible says if we live after the
[9:39] flesh ye shall die of course this is
[9:41] speaking not just some natural this is
[9:43] speaking of the Soul death to the soul
[9:45] separation of the Soul
[9:46] but if you live
[9:48] through this Spirit I'm sorry but if you
[9:50] eat through the spirit do mortify
[9:52] crucify the Deeds of the body you shall
[9:56] live amen Paul said I Die daily of
[9:59] course and so Paul is saying it here
[10:00] here mortify means crucified
[10:03] so the way to live through the spirit is
[10:05] to crucify the desires of the flesh
[10:10] and you know you're following the
[10:12] leadership of the spirit when you're
[10:13] actively trying to crucify the lust of
[10:16] the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[10:19] the pride of life you can know right
[10:20] there I know I'm in the will of God I
[10:22] know the spirit's guiding me because I'm
[10:24] trying to overcome
[10:27] I am fighting against these inward
[10:30] passions or these outward Temptations
[10:32] I'm fighting against them I'm actively
[10:34] trying to put him under my feet praise
[10:36] God
[10:37] and you can know in that moment you are
[10:39] led by the Holy Spirit praise God
[10:42] it may not feel like it because it may
[10:43] feel like a battle but it's actually God
[10:45] giving you the tools for the battle it's
[10:47] God equipping you with the full armor of
[10:49] God hallelujah to fight the battle
[10:51] Hallelujah
[10:54] that's what the Bible says
[10:56] I forget that sometimes that's why I
[10:57] appreciate this scripture is a great
[10:58] reminder sometimes I forget I feel like
[11:00] I'm bowed all the time but I'm actually
[11:02] empowered by the holy spirit amen
[11:05] the fact I got strength to fight and I'm
[11:07] fighting and I'm overcoming actually
[11:09] proves I'm led by the Holy Spirit
[11:11] Hallelujah
[11:13] because I'm led by the spirit into
[11:16] obedience to the spirit overcoming the
[11:19] Deeds of the flesh praise God
[11:22] in church we have not received the
[11:24] spirit of bondage of yoke
[11:28] we'll get to that in a moment here
[11:31] the Holy Spirit does not want to yoke
[11:34] you to fear
[11:36] or greed or lust or anger
[11:40] or bitterness
[11:42] the Holy Spirit does not want to Anchor
[11:44] you to that
[11:46] or enslave you to that praise God
[11:49] but the spirit of God is sent here that
[11:52] we've received and the Bible says when
[11:55] we receive that Spirit it cries out Abba
[11:58] Father
[11:58] like Daddy father my daddy my father
[12:03] Hallelujah so what a beautiful text here
[12:05] we've got to crucify the lust of the
[12:07] Flesh and the pride of life amen and the
[12:09] lust of the eyes
[12:11] and the spirit leads us to do that and
[12:14] as we do that we're crying out to God
[12:16] Daddy help me Daddy I need your strength
[12:19] Daddy help me overcome praise God
[12:21] that proves the spirit of God is in you
[12:24] when you're crying out for your dad to
[12:26] help you praise God
[12:28] thank God Amen
[12:32] that's proof of the spirit of God active
[12:35] in your life even in sanctification
[12:37] we're going to get to that a little bit
[12:38] here I know as many numerous of us are
[12:40] in sanctification seeking the baptism
[12:42] Holy Ghost I've had numerous people come
[12:44] up prayer for the last few weeks praying
[12:45] for the Holy Ghost which is beautiful
[12:48] but that's a great anointing
[12:50] justification is a great anointing
[12:52] it caused the woman at the well to run
[12:55] this city and said say come see a man
[12:57] who's told me all the things I've done
[12:58] that's a great anointing
[13:01] Hallelujah
[13:04] now before I get to this thought I just
[13:06] want to brief this again remember Church
[13:08] there's uh remember there's at least six
[13:10] kinds of revivals and we got to
[13:12] constantly make sure we we discern when
[13:14] we're listening to brother Brandon
