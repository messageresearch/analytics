[29:11] praise God amen
[29:13] how did this think our Bibles let's go
[29:15] to Revelation chapter 4 I'd like to go
[29:18] back to the biblical numerology series
[29:22] I've been needed more time to study this
[29:24] so I had a lot of time this week because
[29:26] I'm on spring break
[29:26] now kaikki do me a favor can you run in
[29:28] my office and get my white adapter it's
[29:31] right on top of the printer I'm sorry I
[29:33] forgot that I got the other one from
[29:36] Sunday I use this ones Sunday no last
[29:38] Wednesday Revelation chapter 4 verse 1
[29:45] we're look at numbers I believe 18 up to
[29:49] 40 today by God's grace if the Lord Oh
[29:51] help us now of course this scripture
[29:58] this passage is about the four and
[30:00] twenty elders so we're gonna work our
[30:01] way up to 24 24 seem to have a lot of a
[30:06] lot of numbers associated with it so
[30:08] we'll be happy to look at that here
[30:10] tonight we'll try to pull as much
[30:15] inspiration as we can from the Holy
[30:17] Spirit tonight by God's grace I got a
[30:22] good quote where where I'm said it's up
[30:23] to the pastors to teach you about
[30:24] numerology so I said well thank you lord
[30:27] I really blessed my heart he said of
[30:30] course your pastor will teach you that
[30:32] so I like to fulfill what he taught amen
[30:35] Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 we'll just
[30:45] read the first four verses I'll read the
[30:47] first three and then we'll read verse 40
[30:48] again the revelation 4 verse 1 after
[30:50] this I looked at me hold a door was open
[30:52] in heaven and the first voice which I
[30:54] heard was as it were of a trumpet
[30:56] talking with me which said come up
[30:58] hither and I will show thee things which
[31:00] must be Hereafter
[31:02] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[31:04] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[31:05] one sat on the throne and he that sat
[31:08] was to look upon like a Jasper and a
[31:10] sardine stone and there was a rainbow
[31:12] round about
[31:13] throne in sight like unto an emerald now
[31:17] let's read verse 4 together if we can
[31:19] ready one two three and round about the
[31:23] throne were four and 20 seats and upon
[31:26] the seats I saw four and twenty elders
[31:28] sitting clothed in white raiment and
[31:31] they had on their heads crowns of gold
[31:35] amen they got as Mustangs the dreams
[31:36] word may be seen but by God's grace god
[31:39] bless you so I do have slides here I
[31:46] just had this thought let me pull up I
[31:50] want to pull up that quote for you I
[31:53] tried to find it last Wednesday about a
[31:56] year and a half where brother BAM
[31:59] preached on Revelation yeah here it is
[32:09] okay there it is
[32:10] this is from 1956 the time as they
[32:13] Hamburg Graham said and as we read this
[32:15] marvelous book of Revelation in my home
[32:16] church I've taken once almost a year and
[32:19] a half to go through it slowly each
[32:21] night teaching on just the book of
[32:23] Revelation and comparing it with the
[32:25] rest of the Bible and the ages and so
[32:27] forth that have passed on so don't you
[32:30] like that church that really is
[32:32] encouragement to me now I know this too
[32:36] brother Branham said however you would
[32:38] have acted in the days of Jesus is how
[32:40] you'd act now right so you say well I
[32:44] could have done that if brother Branham
[32:46] was preaching or if somebody else was
[32:48] preaching but no brother bam said Jesus
[32:51] Christ is the same in every detail today
[32:53] except the Corporal body how many under
[32:55] how many know that in other words
[32:57] there's Jesus Christ is here today he's
[33:00] on this earth he's in Akron his Holy
[33:02] Spirit's here and he's the same in every
[33:04] way except we don't see the corporal
[33:06] body that means however we would act
[33:10] would active brother branham's day is
[33:12] the same way we would act today praise
[33:15] God
[33:15] however you would act in the days of
[33:17] Moses or Noah whichever group you would
[33:19] have been in is the same group you'd be
[33:20] in today
[33:21] praise God so we need to rejoice in the
[33:24] fact that we can go through the Word of
[33:26] God just like brother Brandon
[33:27] and enjoy all the Word of God hey man
[33:30] hallelujah I just thought I'd share that
[33:33] I was on my heart to share this is part
[33:35] 14 I forgot to put the dates on there
[33:37] just put question marks in April so I
[33:39] forgot to do that this morning this is
[33:41] part 14 so we read our text now I want
[33:44] to quickly just go through these
[33:46] meanings again to refresh it with you
[33:48] because program said that's the pastor's
[33:50] duty so I like to do that real quick so
[33:54] number one is preeminence in unity to
[33:56] his division difference testimony and
[33:59] unity and friendship three is divine
[34:01] perfection in life for his deliverance a
[34:05] double confirmation and the earthly
[34:06] number five we've seen as Grace or
[34:09] favors also laboring grace and
[34:11] redemption six is fallen man and beast
[34:14] but it's also anointed man and it's a
[34:17] way to measure time seven is completion
[34:20] eight is eternity or the first day again
[34:23] or we might call it new creation new
[34:25] beginning or it could be abundance nine
[34:28] is fruit or consummation it's our
[34:30] consummation
[34:31] or it could be closure or judgment we've
[34:33] seen 10 is divine order or worldliness
[34:36] it can also mean a faithful remnant at
[34:39] times with the ten virgins and so forth
[34:41] 11 is this order or it could be the last
[34:43] call we've seen that with 11th our
[34:45] workers 12 is a government or rule it
[34:49] could also be worship but we're gonna
[34:50] find out today brother Branham says 24
[34:51] is worship as well so that's interesting
[34:55] 13 is rebellion it could also mean
[34:57] victory or Revelation as we saw with
[35:00] Joshua making 13 trips around Jericho 14
[35:04] it looks like a double 7 but seems to
[35:06] relate to generations we saw that a few
[35:08] Sunday nights ago 15 I'm not quite sure
[35:11] it does relate to feasts of course it's
[35:14] a triple five we know that 16 could be a
[35:17] double eight or eight times two oh I
[35:21] want to add this in here yeah so I
[35:22] looked it up in Hebrews 11 there's 16
[35:24] individual names listed there seems to
[35:27] be a little bit of bit of connection for
[35:29] 16 there with 8 and charity and God's
[35:32] divine love able anak Noah Abraham and I
[35:35] skip Sara aside to go back Sarah's
[35:36] actually the fifth one which is Grace
[35:40] a woman of grace which we're the woman
[35:42] of grace Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses Rahab
[35:46] gideon barak samson jephthah they David
[35:50] and Samuel are the actual names listed
[35:52] 16 names but then there's if you keep
[35:56] going there's extra groups which make a
[35:57] total of 22 people Israel passing
[36:00] through the Red Sea Israel saw the walls
[36:02] of Jericho fall down Paul mentions the
[36:05] prophets he mentions all the women that
[36:08] received their dead to life
[36:09] he said others and then he said and
[36:11] others too so I don't really know the
[36:13] numbers for 16 and 22 I just thought I'd
[36:15] share them with you because I came
[36:16] across them this week so perhaps I said
[36:18] I believe this - I believe this as we
[36:20] serve God longer God will make more of
[36:22] these numbers plain to us I believe got
[36:24] to make it more plain like with 17 like
[36:27] when I came in the message I never knew
[36:28] 17 was the bride number but through
[36:31] Aaron and through some other ones
[36:32] studying we see 17 is clearly the bra
[36:34] number
[36:35] amen but remember 16 had charity had 16
[36:39] attributes in Revelation 13 I'm sorry
[36:41] first Corinthians 13 there's 16
[36:43] attributes of charity and then Jesus was
[36:45] raised on the 16th day of the month
[36:46] because the lamb was killed Passover was
[36:49] the 14th day 14 15 16 so there's
[36:53] something about that this hall-of-fame
[36:55] of faith with 16 individual names
[36:57] interesting now we know 17 seems to be
[37:00] Christ's bride sorry with Jewish bride
[37:02] in the day of Pentecost but then of
[37:04] course turned a Gentile bride later now
[37:07] 18 I think is where we're gonna pick up
[37:09] now by God's grace I'm unsure the
[37:12] meaning but it's 9 times 2 there was 18
[37:17] years the woman had the spirit of
[37:18] infirmity before Jesus he owed her in
[37:20] Luke 13 11 and behold there's a woman
[37:24] which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years
[37:26] and was bowed together and could no wise
[37:28] lift up herself and we know Jesus here
[37:31] this woman supernaturally now above
[37:33] injure the other book I've been reading
[37:34] and no examples of 18 so that's why
[37:37] that's quite short
[37:38] like I said we're spending probably most
[37:40] time on 20 24 and 30 probably and then a
[37:44] little bit on 40 19 unsure about 19 I
[37:47] found that the children of Naphtali
[37:49] inherited 19 cities and their villages
[37:52] in Joshua
[37:55] 1932 to 39 so 19 cities in their
[37:59] villages 19 just has a short example
[38:02] their Jerusalem was burned in the 19th
[38:05] year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign just
[38:08] thought I'd put that in there Jeremiah
[38:09] 52 12 in the fifth month in the tenth
[38:13] day of the month which was the 19th year
[38:15] of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon I'm
[38:18] sorry yeah came Nebu Sarah Don captain
[38:22] the guard which served the king of
[38:23] Babylon in Jerusalem and burned the
[38:25] house of the Lord and the King's house
[38:27] and all the House of Jerusalem and all
[38:28] the house of the great men burned he
[38:30] with fire now let's take a little bit
[38:33] time on 2020 has an interesting pattern
[38:36] you can see 20/20 does signal expectancy
[38:41] or you're waiting for something from the
[38:44] Lord 20 deals with expectancy of course
[38:48] it's 10 times 2 or he could say 5 times
[38:50] 4 I forgot to put that one up there as
[38:52] well there's other factors right 220 now
[38:56] interesting Jacob was with Laban for 20
[38:59] years I remember he was longing to go
[39:02] back members mother sent him away but
[39:04] member on his way there he had a dream
[39:06] right and the dream said God said I'll
[39:09] be with you but then I'm gonna bring you
[39:11] back to your land amen so Jacob was
[39:15] waiting 20 years expecting to come back
[39:17] to the land praise God
[39:19] he was waiting 20 years hallelujah
[39:23] that's interesting I've almost been the
[39:25] message 20 years I wonder if there be
[39:27] something special in the 20th year I
[39:29] wonder 2001 I heard the message so I
[39:32] just got a couple more years by God's
[39:34] grace 2 more years
[39:35] we'll see if something happens in the 24
[39:37] 20th year yeah now in this 20 years he
[39:43] reserved
[39:43] Laban for his wives and cattle so this
[39:46] is further on in the chapter he said I
[39:49] serve so 20 years of service and then he
[39:53] got us to wot two daughters of Laban and
[39:55] then six years for cattle has tile
[39:57] changed my wages ten times he said
[40:01] except the god of my father the God of
[40:03] Abraham the and the fear of Isaac I've
[40:05] been with me surely thou has said
[40:07] away now empty oh my god has seen my
[40:10] affliction in the labor of my hands and
[40:12] rebuked the yesternight so I'll say like
[40:15] this it wasn't easy twenty years and
[40:17] you'll see some of these other twenty
[40:20] years they're not always easy but I'll
[40:22] say like this God is faithful and God
[40:24] will show up at the end amen Jacob says
[40:29] without God's favor you would have to
[40:31] serve twenty years for nothing he said
[40:34] but thank God God was with me aren't you
[40:36] glad for God's favor Church you and
[40:39] honest let's be honest we don't deserve
[40:40] God's blessings but he gives us his
[40:42] favor raise God now interesting look at
[40:48] this Israel was oppressed for 20 years
[40:51] before deliverance came through Deborah
[40:55] and barrack 20 years very similar and
[40:59] the Lord sold him in the hand of Jabin
[41:03] king of Canaan that reigned in Hayes or
[41:05] the captain of the host was Sisera which
[41:09] Jeff which dwelt in Harrell Chef of the
[41:11] Gentiles and the children Israel cried
[41:14] to the Lord and he had nine hundred
[41:15] chariots of iron in 20 years he mildly
[41:18] oppressed the children of Israel amen
[41:21] twenty years and then God sent Deborah
[41:25] and barrack
[41:26] here's another twenty the Lord told
[41:29] Moses the number Israel beginning at the
[41:31] age of twenty so it's almost like the
[41:34] men would expect my when I get to twenty
[41:36] that's the time I'll start being a
[41:38] soldier so 20 was the year that of
[41:42] expectancy we expect you to be able to
[41:43] fight praise God
[41:48] so we expect you to go be able to labor
[41:50] now yeah now that you're twenty we
[41:52] expect you be able to fight any man with
[41:54] a sword or spear twenty years old this
[42:00] is interesting I'm not sure how this
[42:02] fits in but in Solomon's Temple that
[42:04] cherubim wings were twenty cubits long
[42:07] they're twenty cubits that's one really
[42:12] this is a cubit
[42:13] remember from your middle finger to your
[42:14] elbow that's a cubit so we're talking
[42:16] about some pretty larger angels right
[42:19] and this was remember showing this was
[42:22] the August time this was the glorious
[42:24] time of and this was showing forth that
[42:26] millennial reign praise God
[42:28] oh what a blessed thing is gonna be to
[42:30] live during the Millennium amen
[42:32] twenty cubits long oh look I had I had
[42:38] this up there twice sorry about that
[42:43] Sampson judge Israel for twenty years
[42:45] and they kept expecting him to do great
[42:48] things right against the Philistines but
[42:50] the greatest victory didn't come into
[42:52] the last year how many can say men of
[42:54] that like okay well waiting for Samson
[42:57] they're expecting Samson to do something
[42:58] you know a little few little things here
[43:00] and there but the Bible said his last
[43:02] victory was the greatest of all the
[43:05] victories so it took 20 years at the end
[43:08] of 20 years there was such a move of God
[43:11] where we could see now we can see why
[43:13] this man was born it took all twenty
[43:15] years we expected great things and it
[43:18] finally came in the 20th year Amen for
[43:23] he judged Israel for 20 years I like
[43:27] that so the dead which he's through at
[43:30] his death were more than they which he
[43:32] slew in his life
[43:33] praise God what a blessing that is
[43:36] praise the Lord right now the Ark of the
[43:40] Covenant was then here Jeff Durham for
[43:44] 20 years in the early days of Samuel
[43:46] until Israel started reviving this is
[43:49] interesting too now it didn't actually
[43:51] come into Jerusalem until 40 years later
[43:53] when David brought it in but once once
[43:58] Samuel came on the scene it was at the
[44:01] 20th year so they were expecting
[44:03] something to happen and then something
[44:06] finally happened in the 20th year and
[44:08] that was Samuel came on the scene and
[44:11] Samuel started judging Israel hey man oh
[44:14] yeah twenty years and all those years
[44:18] see they'll amenda they're expecting
[44:20] something they're crying into God God
[44:21] sent her something and so God did God
[44:24] sent him a prophet amen when noticin
[44:27] all these cases there's women Hannah was
[44:29] crying out to God give me us a son give
[44:32] me a prophet take my reproach away they
[44:35] they cry for twenty years God give us
[44:38] deliverance and God sent him dead
[44:39] Romaric amen so see church many these
[44:43] times the twenty here represents
[44:46] expectancy but the people of God have
[44:49] got to cry out for it
[44:50] amen 20 years of crying out to God and
[44:56] then the 20th year God sent a prophet on
[44:59] the scene oh my what a blessing is a
[45:02] faithful Church what does it show you
[45:05] this shows you that God hears all the
[45:08] prayers of his people but he may give
[45:11] you a little test right he may make you
[45:14] wait a few months weeks years decades
[45:19] Amen but the faithful God hears the
[45:23] cries of his children don't give up if
[45:26] you give up it shows you're not born
[45:27] again whatever you are born again it
[45:30] shows you're Abraham's seed and you can
[45:32] wait a long time amen took Solomon 20
[45:36] years to build both the Lord's house and
[45:39] the king's house imagine the expectancy
[45:41] my when are we gonna get this done
[45:43] Solomon who boy oh boy seven years he
[45:47] finished the Lord's house they said Amen
[45:49] fire fell from heaven but now he's like
[45:52] oh I got to work on my house now that
[45:54] was thirteen years in the building and
[45:56] then five at the other twenty years they
[45:59] all finished at the end of all that
[46:01] labor 20 years he finished building
[46:06] praise God
[46:07] now this is striking this is what is
[46:10] really striking to me there's 20 dreams
[46:14] detailed in the Bible and that's
[46:16] striking so 20 represents expectancy and
[46:20] how many know once you have us real
[46:22] spiritual dream what happens after that
[46:24] what happens that we have that dream
[46:25] church you start expecting it to happen
[46:28] right remember I had a dream about
[46:32] brother Branham a couple years ago
[46:33] remember that and I shared a dream in
[46:34] the dream it was on Victoria's birthday
[46:37] so J in January 28th
[46:40] I woke up but before they had a dream
[46:43] and I was in a prayer and I went to
[46:44] brother Rams meetings and finally came
[46:49] up to my turn brother man looked like
[46:50] he's about 4045 something like that
[46:52] he stood some hair on top I said brother
[46:55] branham you know how come how come the
[46:58] churches and manifesting like the latter
[47:00] a Nia in the book of Acts church and you
[47:02] know I was really burden to see you know
[47:04] more of God and all the supernatural and
[47:06] program told me something that something
[47:07] like this he said well you need to spend
[47:10] more time seeking God about it and I
[47:11] think he thought he questioned me said
[47:13] how much time have you spent seeking God
[47:14] about it and I remember leaving the
[47:16] prayer line little disappointed but when
[47:18] I woke up I was so encouraged I finally
[47:20] had a spiritual dream but what it new
[47:23] replaced an expectancy in my heart
[47:25] because I said expecting if I seek God
[47:28] more I'll start to see more of God and
[47:32] in each one of these cases Church the
[47:35] dream is something spiritual and in many
[47:39] of them it creates an expectancy for God
[47:41] to move now the first one Abimelech had
[47:46] the Deadman dream he said you're good as
[47:48] a dead man he said but thank God you got
[47:50] a heart of integrity right Church look
[47:55] how look how look how straight forward
[47:57] God is sometimes we think God's like a
[47:58] soft dhoti grandpa right God's like
[48:01] you're as good as a dead man right he
[48:06] said but because you've got a heart of
[48:07] integrity I'm not going to cause your
[48:10] women to go barren right I'm gonna have
[48:13] mercy on you because you have a heart
[48:14] you don't want to sin against me so what
[48:19] would God say today to people that take
[48:20] a second wife and a third wife they say
[48:24] you're nothing but a dead man right that
[48:26] right church is he the same yesterday
[48:28] today and forever or not he's the same
[48:31] remember adulterers will not inherit the
[48:34] kingdom of God neither will men that a
[48:37] commit adultery in their minds all the
[48:39] time
[48:39] or women but thank God God knows our
[48:43] integrity God knows if you really don't
[48:45] want to do something like that God will
[48:46] keep you from it the second one is
[48:50] Jacob's Ladder dream promising is
[48:53] keeping from God
[48:54] also his return jacobs Rams dream was
[48:57] next telling him return to Canaan
[48:59] because he had all speckled Rams as God
[49:01] said look what I've done I bless you
[49:03] and laymen's dream next was to speak not
[49:06] to Jacob either good or bad Joseph's
[49:10] dream now this is a real expectancy
[49:11] right Joseph's dreams and all the the
[49:14] sheaves bowed to him when's this gonna
[49:16] happen remember it happened how many
[49:18] years was that later I can't remember
[49:20] now he started ruling at thirty
[49:22] seventeen okay so thirteen thirteen
[49:25] years later this actually happened well
[49:28] a little after thirteen yeah cuz he
[49:30] started ruling I'm not sure what year
[49:31] his brothers actually came to him so as
[49:34] at least thirteen plus years and then
[49:37] Joseph had another dream of how the son
[49:39] bowed to him the Moon and Eleven stars
[49:42] of course that happened a thirteen plus
[49:45] years later as well dream seven and
[49:47] eight were Joseph's dream of the the
[49:49] butler's dream and the Baker's dream and
[49:52] that would create some expectancy didn't
[49:54] they won't know what's going to happen I
[49:56] can live am I gonna die photostream of
[50:00] seven lean cattle devouring the seven
[50:02] fat ones was the eighth ninth dream his
[50:04] dream of the seventh in years was the
[50:06] tenth dream the eleventh dream was the
[50:08] Midian man's dream of the barley cake
[50:10] rolling down the hill and smashing the
[50:13] tent amen
[50:14] and that created such expectancy for
[50:17] Gideon he fell on his knees and started
[50:19] praising God right there I'm more than a
[50:22] conqueror we're gonna defeat these many
[50:24] knights God's gonna drive them all out
[50:26] by the power of God Solomon dreamed the
[50:30] Lord asking him what God should give him
[50:34] that's the 12th dream the 13
[50:37] Nebuchadnezzar his first dream troubled
[50:38] him Daniel interpreter of the image of
[50:40] the the Gentile times the 14th dream was
[50:44] Nebuchadnezzar second dream himself as a
[50:46] tree cut down but then given life again
[50:48] that's when he lost his mind as a beast
[50:50] and God allowed him to humble him so he
[50:53] could expect a better end praise God
[50:56] Oh mine look how God's dreams with
[50:59] believers and even unbelievers look how
[51:01] God gives hope and expectancy with
[51:03] dreams the 15 dream was Daniel's dream
[51:07] of the four great
[51:08] in Daniel chapter 7 the sixteenth was
[51:12] Joseph's dream instructing him to take
[51:14] Mary and name the boy Jesus the
[51:17] seventeen was a wise man
[51:18] what warned of a dream not to return to
[51:21] Herod the eighteenth was Joseph's dream
[51:23] instructing him to flee to Egypt the
[51:25] nineteenth was his Joseph's dream to
[51:27] return to Israel Matthew 219 and the
[51:31] last dream record in Scripture was
[51:34] pilots wife suffered many things in a
[51:35] dream because of Jesus right look how
[51:39] God will give a test to unbelievers
[51:42] he'll send a little bit allow a little
[51:44] torment to come on them to try to shake
[51:47] them up but see even dreams sometimes
[51:50] how many people no even dreams won't
[51:52] turn people to God God will use a dream
[51:55] to try to shake them up but they won't
[51:57] turn to it god help us to humble
[51:59] ourselves and be moved by the dreams
[52:01] that we have we should take a church we
[52:05] should take our dreams as a warning is
[52:07] that right we should take our dreams if
[52:10] it's a scriptural dream now we should
[52:13] take it as the word from God and we
[52:15] should act upon Wheaton's you should do
[52:16] something about it amen
[52:22] now I mentioned this a few last
[52:25] Wednesday yeah let's no two Sundays ago
[52:26] when I preached when a man's sister was
[52:28] here Paul is 20 evil attributes for the
[52:32] last days talking about expectancy my
[52:35] expecting evil lovers their own selves
[52:38] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[52:40] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[52:43] without natural affection trucebreakers
[52:45] false accusers incontinent fierce
[52:47] despisers them that are good there's
[52:51] 1415 traitors heady highminded lovers of
[52:54] pleasure more numbers of god having a
[52:56] form of godliness but denying the power
[52:58] thereof see they can expect the wrath of
[53:01] God because of these 20 attributes about
[53:03] them that's right and from such turn
[53:07] away a church that's what we should do
[53:08] we should turn away from people that say
[53:10] they are messing believer but they don't
[53:12] have the power of God in their life is
[53:14] that right amen
[53:15] turn away than from anyone that loves
[53:17] the world more than they love the
[53:19] message praise God turn
[53:22] away from that we must love the message
[53:24] first and then we must just live in
[53:26] laodicea Amen now 21 this is interesting
[53:32] there's just a few examples 21 seems to
[53:35] be all that makes sense if 20 is
[53:37] expecting 21 would be the arrival aim
[53:42] ahead I didn't catch that so right now
[53:44] forgive me Lord forgive me
[53:46] the arrival the word at 7 times 3
[53:50] completion and perfection Oh glory
[53:54] when did Daniel's prayer come Church
[53:57] when the answer come 21st day hallelujah
[54:02] when the word come after 7 officers
[54:05] serve three weeks of seven days right
[54:09] interesting the Word of God came to
[54:12] Hagee I on the 21st day of the seventh
[54:16] month so I got two witnesses and then he
[54:20] said now be strong zerubabbel because
[54:22] the words arrived amen saith the Lord
[54:26] be strong Joshua son of josedech the
[54:29] high priests and be strong all you
[54:31] people the land sent the Lord and work
[54:33] Fri with you saith the Lord of Hosts
[54:37] boys thank you lord
[54:43] I was want to make sure I get this right
[54:46] yes the Word of God came to me when I
[54:49] was 20 21 years old I was making sure it
[54:57] came on Thanksgiving Day of 2001 and I
[55:02] was 21 years old well hallelujah
[55:06] thank you Lord the message arrived when
[55:09] I was 21 years old I don't know yeah
[55:12] thank you Jesus well he's just blessed
[55:15] in my heart amen thank you how merciful
[55:20] is the Lord praise God thank you Lord
[55:23] Jesus now 22 I don't have a whole lot on
[55:27] this that's why I put a question mark it
[55:28] seems to be disorder but I'm not sure
[55:33] Jeroboam and
[55:35] have both rain for 22 years a hab was
[55:39] the most filthy evil King so it seems to
[55:42] be a double disorder they have the son
[55:46] of Omri reigned over Israel in Samara
[55:48] and two years remember Church on each
[55:51] one of these I typed in the computer you
[55:53] know ten and seven or you know for 1820
[55:56] and 120 and 220 and 320 and for
[56:00] searching all these by the Bible to try
[56:01] to find try to find revelations for us
[56:07] so that was that 23 I'm kind of unsure
[56:10] but Nebuchadnezzar is 23rd year that
[56:15] seven hundred seven hundred five
[56:17] Israelites were carried away captive
[56:20] twenty three thousand I'm skipping a
[56:22] thousand twenty three thousand his
[56:24] rights fell one day due to Balaam and
[56:26] bailiwicks fornication focused feast
[56:29] right they said oh we're on the same
[56:32] come on over here and even if you're not
[56:33] married you can sleep with these people
[56:35] it's okay God will understand you maybe
[56:37] he'll plan to get married next time but
[56:39] God hated it and Bertram's said I listen
[56:41] to nobody I'm saying this this week he
[56:43] said God never did forgive them for
[56:45] saying they're all the same so don't you
[56:48] ever say the message churches are all
[56:50] the same as every other churches we're
[56:51] not the same we're living a separated
[56:54] holy life at least we should be praise
[56:56] God
[56:57] we're not to say God will never forgive
[57:01] those people who say we're the same now
[57:04] the way you know the way you know you're
[57:06] saying that is if you're sinning like
[57:08] they said when we let message churches
[57:12] sin the way the denominational sin and
[57:14] say nothing about it that shows that
[57:16] we're all the same but if we preach a
[57:18] higher life if we demand a higher life
[57:21] because God's Word says so because we
[57:23] know grace helps us to live higher and
[57:26] if you really receive grace you will
[57:28] live a higher life of sanctification
[57:29] when we live a separated life that
[57:32] proves were separated God called our
[57:34] group and a group that's following the
[57:36] pillar fire amen thank you lord amen all
[57:42] right should have totally different
[57:43] praise the Lord there were other
[57:45] people's lives look like hallelujah
[57:50] we're not the same as denominations yes
[57:53] we're all created by God yes we all have
[57:55] the same chance to be saved yes we can
[57:57] all be safe foolish you're wise but we
[57:59] are different people because we're
[58:01] living to please all the Word of God
[58:03] we're living all of it we just don't
[58:05] want to be called Church we want to be
[58:07] called bride amen
[58:13] thank God that we can be called bride
[58:16] remember the foolish virgin is not
[58:17] called bride she's not the bride because
[58:21] she's not part of the wedding in the sky
[58:23] but you and I are privileged to be
[58:26] invited to get married to Christ at that
[58:28] wedding supper and of course we know the
[58:33] invisible unions happened first
[58:34] but brother Branham literally says in
[58:35] 1965 he says the meeting in the air is
[58:39] the wedding ceremony amen that's right
[58:43] hallelujah so thank God if you got the
[58:46] invisible Union if you've got the
[58:48] invisible Union then you'll act like it
[58:50] you'll act like you're married right now
[58:51] and you won't compromise on God's Word
[58:56] amen hallelujah let me see if I can find
[59:00] that quote real quick it's been so long
[59:01] since I read that I like to show that to
[59:05] you
[59:20] yeah it's not the exact word sorry I
[59:23] look good
[59:30] maybe it's married Oscar take me too
[59:35] long
[59:35] help me Lord oh yeah this is kind of
[59:41] that's kind of like it yeah here we go
[59:43] but he's calling not a church group like
[59:45] I said the foolish version gerrae their
[59:47] church good which is a good group that's
[59:49] not the bride but a people for his name
[59:51] that receives his name listen this is
[59:53] what we have engaged you and I are
[59:55] engaged to his name going to a wedding
[59:59] to be married to him to become part of
[1:00:01] them see a predestination church where
[1:00:05] we going we are going to the wedding
[1:00:07] amen you see that we're going to be
[1:00:12] married praise God I thought there was
[1:00:20] another one but I should look at my
[1:00:22] notes I thought it was the exact quote
[1:00:23] forgive me but I think you can see we
[1:00:26] said we're going there we're going to
[1:00:28] the wedding you're yes you have the
[1:00:30] invisible Union but we're going there to
[1:00:32] be married because last time I checked
[1:00:35] when I got married I took my wife home
[1:00:37] and you see Jesus right here do you see
[1:00:39] the physical body of Jesus no but when
[1:00:42] you see that body that's when he gets
[1:00:43] married and then we'll be with him is
[1:00:46] that right we'll be with him glory now
[1:00:49] here we go 24 was a little more content
[1:00:53] on 24 as you can tell there wasn't much
[1:00:56] for 18 - 19 I was a little bit on 20 the
[1:00:59] most was on 20 now the 21 to 23 there's
[1:01:01] not much so 24 we have a little more now
[1:01:04] remember brother Adam calls 12 and 24 he
[1:01:07] calls both them worship and I looked up
[1:01:10] I try to look up every time now he said
[1:01:12] 3 is the number of perfection we all
[1:01:14] know that 3 is God's number in his
[1:01:16] numerology God is known by his numbers
[1:01:18] 3s perfection 7 is worship 24 is worship
[1:01:23] forty's temptation 50s Pentecost Jubilee
[1:01:27] so forth
[1:01:27] all of his numbers as numerals of God is
[1:01:29] perfected is imperfection now 3 is the
[1:01:32] number of perfection just when
[1:01:33] listen not close when the little baby
[1:01:35] christ is born three stars went together
[1:01:36] and made the one morning star that
[1:01:38] reflected the coming of an infant Christ
[1:01:40] a perfect one now this was our scripture
[1:01:45] there's twelve twenty four seats and
[1:01:48] there's twenty four elders in heaven and
[1:01:53] the four and twenty elders fall down
[1:01:55] before him that sound the throne and
[1:01:56] worship Him so brother hands to the 24
[1:01:59] is worship Him that liveth for ever and
[1:02:03] ever and casting their crowns before the
[1:02:06] throne saying thou art worthy O Lord to
[1:02:08] receive glory and honor and power for
[1:02:10] thou has created all things and for thy
[1:02:11] pleasure they are and were created now I
[1:02:18] just want to read these as a reminder
[1:02:19] because I preached on this recently last
[1:02:22] year now the four and twenty elders and
[1:02:25] outers an overseer now notice there were
[1:02:27] twelve patriarchs and twelve apostles
[1:02:29] and they were sending twelve on one side
[1:02:31] twelve on the other there were the
[1:02:33] twenty and four elders which were the
[1:02:35] twelve patriarchs on one side the Old
[1:02:36] Testament the 12 apostles estimate then
[1:02:40] Jesus say you'll sit on the twelve
[1:02:41] Thrones judging the twelve tribes of
[1:02:43] Israel and how the foundations looked
[1:02:47] there was even a tree in there and the
[1:02:50] tree on either side bears twelve manners
[1:02:52] of fruit and they yield their fruit once
[1:02:54] a month which is twelve months in a year
[1:02:55] they render twelve manners of fruit
[1:02:57] every year as it goes by twelve is that
[1:03:00] worship number you see and there's a
[1:03:04] twenty and four would be twenty four
[1:03:06] twelve apostles and twelve patriarchs
[1:03:08] they're setting at the throne and the
[1:03:11] church said and we've seen this now
[1:03:17] here's the quote I was going to share
[1:03:18] with you through the Old Testament the
[1:03:20] New Testament day winding up which
[1:03:22] everything in the Bible by numbers is
[1:03:24] perfect in threes like Father Son Holy
[1:03:26] Spirit justification sanctification
[1:03:28] baptism Holy Ghost water blood spear and
[1:03:31] all these things three sevens 1224 is
[1:03:34] forties fifties is God's numbers that
[1:03:36] you understand forty is this temptation
[1:03:38] 50 is jubilee and oh you understand
[1:03:41] those by your pastors
[1:03:44] so see this is why I wonder well why
[1:03:47] should I preach this and here brother
[1:03:48] man says you're supposed to understand
[1:03:50] those by your pastors so I thank the
[1:03:52] Lord thank you Jesus I can fulfill what
[1:03:55] brother man taught now here's another
[1:03:57] one did you know this David kept 24
[1:04:01] soldiers on duty each month each tribe
[1:04:06] participated one month at a time meaning
[1:04:08] two hundred eighty-eight thousand
[1:04:10] soldiers were ready always to war
[1:04:12] year-round twenty-four thousand per
[1:04:15] month this was since first chronicles 20
[1:04:19] 71 I'm just gonna skip down here which
[1:04:23] came in and went out month by one
[1:04:25] throughout all the months of the year of
[1:04:26] every course were twenty and four
[1:04:29] thousand so David knew I've got to have
[1:04:33] twenty four thousand if I'm going to be
[1:04:36] safe if I'm gonna have protection I need
[1:04:38] twenty four thousand surrounding me and
[1:04:41] isn't that interesting his throne was
[1:04:43] surrounded by twenty-four thousand and
[1:04:44] the throne in heaven is surrounded by
[1:04:46] twenty-four of patriarchs they've been
[1:04:48] you like that
[1:04:50] amen hallelujah it was protection praise
[1:04:55] God its protection for worship now did
[1:05:01] you know this brother Branham says I
[1:05:02] wasn't in church till I was 24 years old
[1:05:06] he wasn't worshiping in church until he
[1:05:09] was 24 this is the church the Living God
[1:05:12] 1951 he said they went to no church at
[1:05:16] all separated my father mother both
[1:05:18] Irish Branham and Harvey they had no
[1:05:19] religion at all came down my I was in
[1:05:22] church of Dobbs
[1:05:22] 24 years old praise God how many knew
[1:05:27] that I know that that was something I
[1:05:29] learned I knew I learned today 24 years
[1:05:32] old he started worshipping see how see
[1:05:36] how numbers can mean different things to
[1:05:38] different people
[1:05:38] 21 means a lot to me because that's when
[1:05:40] I received the message 24 men laughter
[1:05:44] brother Graham that's where you started
[1:05:45] worshipping in the church so it's
[1:05:48] different for everyone
[1:05:49] aren't you glad God makes everybody's
[1:05:50] testimony special I like that now of
[1:05:54] course in nature 24 is important too
[1:05:57] there's 24 hours in a day as one earth
[1:06:01] rotation takes 24 hours so to get back
[1:06:07] to the same spot where you were it takes
[1:06:09] 24 hours to get back to it and also
[1:06:12] church is interesting brother Brad
[1:06:14] points it out numerous times God seems
[1:06:18] to work many times within 24 hours I'm
[1:06:22] not sure if you're aware of that but
[1:06:24] let's pull out some quotes so you can
[1:06:26] see this so many times and Brodeur has
[1:06:28] does a little Joe Kinnear says he says
[1:06:30] if we're supposed to be the seed of
[1:06:31] Abraham if Abraham could wait 24 years
[1:06:35] until God came and told about the next
[1:06:38] year 25th year he says why can't the
[1:06:41] seed of Abraham wait 24 hours he makes a
[1:06:45] little joke there right oh he could say
[1:06:47] amen to that
[1:06:48] if Abraham callate 24 years so God came
[1:06:52] and then the twenty-fifth year
[1:06:53] Isaac came why can't we wait at least a
[1:06:56] day for God to manifest his word praise
[1:06:59] God I would say God help me to be able
[1:07:01] to wait a whole day right amen god help
[1:07:08] me just be able to weigh today because
[1:07:10] there's numerous things in Scripture
[1:07:12] that happened within a 24 hour span of
[1:07:16] time I like this this is beautiful look
[1:07:21] at this if you accepted Christ sincerely
[1:07:24] and you believe it then brothers come in
[1:07:26] the hoist of Holies and they'll yield
[1:07:28] the fruits of the spirit in 24 hours the
[1:07:32] stick that was deadly blossom yoona
[1:07:33] blossoms and almonds in 24 hours let a
[1:07:38] man or a woman that don't believe in the
[1:07:40] supernatural let a man and a woman that
[1:07:42] can't believe the days of miracles let
[1:07:44] them hide behind the horse of hoist and
[1:07:47] the veil of God's Sun will drop between
[1:07:49] them in the world and less than 24 hours
[1:07:52] they'll believe every word of God's Word
[1:07:55] is the truth I know you praise God amen
[1:08:00] so burry him get this foundation from
[1:08:03] the Old Testament lay a dead stick there
[1:08:06] give it 24 hours and you watch it'll
[1:08:09] come to life amen
[1:08:11] how they do yeah because that's what the
[1:08:15] Bible said Moses laid up the rods for
[1:08:17] the Lord and Tabernacle witness and they
[1:08:19] came to fasten on tomorrow the next day
[1:08:21] 24 hours they went in behold it brought
[1:08:27] forth buds and blossoms and yielded
[1:08:29] almonds oh honey here yeah you see now
[1:08:35] just Mountain does anybody understand
[1:08:37] now how comes some people that come to
[1:08:39] message churches like ours they can stay
[1:08:41] here for out a year year and a half and
[1:08:44] then they fall away how come they can do
[1:08:47] that and not bear almonds or not bear
[1:08:51] fruit it's because they never went deep
[1:08:53] enough in God's presence they never went
[1:08:56] all the way oh god help us to go all the
[1:08:58] way men so we can have real fruit of the
[1:09:02] Holy Spirit so don't give up and get
[1:09:05] worldly or just get a church membership
[1:09:07] rather than a fruit producing experience
[1:09:10] with God Almighty hey man how do you
[1:09:14] praise God Day men had a good week so
[1:09:21] far church I've had a pretty good week I
[1:09:23] mean it'll pass out more of my books I
[1:09:24] gave a book today to my chiropractor
[1:09:27] yesterday my friend was sick he's had an
[1:09:29] ear infection
[1:09:30] we're in the middle of the Akron library
[1:09:35] now it's the Akron family center where
[1:09:37] there's all these people stand around
[1:09:38] and he said I've had this ear infection
[1:09:39] I said can I lay hands on you can I pray
[1:09:42] for you in Jesus Christ's name for all
[1:09:44] these people and so we prayed right
[1:09:45] there I'm trusting I'll hear a testimony
[1:09:47] of him being healed oh we should be
[1:09:50] walking this mirror charge we should be
[1:09:52] bringing forth fruit of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:54] we should be manifesting the life of
[1:09:56] Christ every one because if we met in
[1:10:01] his presence we will we've been the
[1:10:04] Friends of God and we've if we've gone
[1:10:06] behind the veil and been in his presence
[1:10:09] then we can't help but bear real fruit
[1:10:12] of the Holy Spirit publicly I don't you
[1:10:16] like that he goes on to say this this is
[1:10:19] the same quote he said but when to come
[1:10:21] to here and stayed in there 24 hours it
[1:10:23] was a yielded tree you

[1:10:45] God's presence in one day why can't a
[1:10:48] dead sinner get in God's presence and
[1:10:49] bear for all kinds of fruit of the Holy
[1:10:51] Spirit hey man god help us to be simple

[1:14:45] Genesis 17 God comes to Abraham and
[1:14:47] reminds him Sarah will have a child she
[1:14:51] will have it for you and he
[1:14:53] laughs in Genesis 17 programs say we
[1:14:59] find here how shoddy I the almighty shad
[1:15:02] means the breasts like a woman's breasts
[1:15:04] and he appeared him in the name of
[1:15:06] el-shaddai which is plural breasted on
[1:15:08] the breast he got Abram ninety nine
[1:15:10] years old walk before me be perfect
[1:15:12] believe my word just keep on believing I
[1:15:15] promise that seventy five here it is
[1:15:17] you've been 24 years now since I made
[1:15:20] you the promise
[1:15:22] what a comfort on that been to an old
[1:15:25] men ninety nine years old and his
[1:15:27] strength our God and here God super form
[1:15:29] and said I'm El Shaddai i i'm the breast
[1:15:31] of god draw your strength from me i am
[1:15:33] your strength how many are drawn
[1:15:37] strength from el shaddai add tonight hey
[1:15:39] men praise god
[1:15:42] ninety nine years old still drawn
[1:15:45] straight from el shaddai i he had
[1:15:47] seventy six more years to live praise
[1:15:49] God
[1:15:50] but he's still drawing strength at
[1:15:52] ninety nine years old
[1:15:53] hey then thank the Lord now 25 through
[1:15:57] 29 there's not a lot of meaning oh
[1:16:00] except I forgot 28 28 can mean life
[1:16:03] because like a woman's cycle and there's
[1:16:06] other twenty eighths there I forgot
[1:16:07] about those yeah I did forget about that
[1:16:10] now bubbling journey's book had no
[1:16:13] scriptures for 25 to 29
[1:16:16] but we know Abraham waited 25 years
[1:16:20] Isaac arrived in the 25th year and of
[1:16:24] course five times five grace grace times
[1:16:27] grace 26 is I could find no 26 is in the
[1:16:31] Bible 27 you know there's 27 New
[1:16:37] Testament books which is 9 times 3 I
[1:16:40] don't think there was anything else for
[1:16:41] 27 no I could find nothing for 28 or 29
[1:16:45] so god jump ahead to 30 we have quite a
[1:16:48] few things for 30 I believe now 30
[1:16:51] stands for leadership how many know that
[1:16:54] 30s leadership in the Bible Jesus cry
[1:17:00] was 30 years old when God gave the
[1:17:03] leadership to start preaching 30 years
[1:17:05] old now a lot of people believe John the
[1:17:10] Baptist started preaching at 30 as well
[1:17:12] but there's not a scripture that
[1:17:14] actually says that but we know of course
[1:17:17] he was conceived six months before
[1:17:20] Christ Joseph was the same age 30 years
[1:17:27] old when he has finally exalted to the
[1:17:29] second in command right hand no Pharaoh
[1:17:31] David was 30 years old when he began to
[1:17:35] reign in Hebron right so 30 is a year of
[1:17:39] or that number of leadership did you
[1:17:43] know the Jewish priests enter the
[1:17:45] ministry at 30 years old they can fight
[1:17:47] at 20 the men but then those Levites
[1:17:50] that became in the lineage of Aaron
[1:17:53] arenites they could start ministering at
[1:17:56] 30 years old and Ezekiel's visions began
[1:18:01] at the age of 30 interesting now for me
[1:18:07] 30 was a great year - 30 was your
[1:18:09] brother cam came and preached just once
[1:18:12] more Lord and I looked back and that was
[1:18:15] the year where I saw the most miracles
[1:18:16] in my life and in my ministry was 30
[1:18:18] years old so God started doing something
[1:18:20] great at 30 there and it's like he gave
[1:18:24] me like a great leadership of the Holy
[1:18:26] Spirit I feel like a great vindication
[1:18:28] at the 30th year of my life I already
[1:18:31] been preaching five years I started
[1:18:33] pastoring oh I'm sorry are they than
[1:18:34] preaching seven years as our preaching
[1:18:36] at 23 and that 30 year was a very
[1:18:39] special year probably the most
[1:18:40] supernatural year I've ever had I
[1:18:42] believe for as far as ministry so 30 men
[1:18:45] a lot to me as well now in judges 10
[1:18:48] these are just some interesting
[1:18:51] scriptures Jer judge Israel for 22 years
[1:18:55] he had 30 sons that wrote on 30 ask
[1:18:58] coats and they had 30 cities in the land
[1:19:03] of Gilead 30 so that's interesting 30 30
[1:19:08] sons 30 Colts 30 cities
[1:19:13] judges 12-8 is man judged guru sorbetto
[1:19:18] ham he had 30 sons 30 daughters and they
[1:19:22] took in 30 daughters from abroad for his
[1:19:24] sons any judged Israel 7 years so with
[1:19:28] these two of the years we can see how 30
[1:19:30] is an important number for them so 30
[1:19:33] seems to represent leadership now this
[1:19:37] is interesting I don't quite understand
[1:19:38] this but I'm just putting in there
[1:19:39] because it's 30
[1:19:40] Sam's remember with Sam Samson told the
[1:19:42] riddle to those men he said when they
[1:19:47] saw him they brought 30 companions to be
[1:19:49] with him and Sammy and said I will now
[1:19:51] put forth a riddle if you can certainly
[1:19:53] declare it with to me within the seven
[1:19:55] days of the feasts and find out then
[1:19:57] when I gave you 30 sheets and 30 change
[1:19:59] of garments but if you cannot declare it
[1:20:01] to me then shall you give me 30 sheets
[1:20:03] and 30 change of garments and they said
[1:20:05] put forth that riddle that we may hear
[1:20:06] it and the spirit Lord came upon him and
[1:20:09] he went down to Ashkelon and through 30
[1:20:11] men of them and took their spoil and
[1:20:13] gave them change of garments unto them
[1:20:15] which expounded the riddle and his anger
[1:20:18] was kindled and he went up to his
[1:20:19] father's house so I'm again interesting
[1:20:22] the thirty there something with thirty
[1:20:27] now here's where we get a little
[1:20:29] interesting the lowest level of
[1:20:33] fruitfulness for an honest hearted
[1:20:36] Christian is 30 fold so 30 times what
[1:20:42] you have
[1:20:44] remember there's 30 60 and 100 remember
[1:20:48] there's only two kinds of Christians
[1:20:49] right there's the foolish and they don't
[1:20:53] bring forth any fruit because their life
[1:20:54] gets choked out by cares of the world
[1:20:57] how many how many tonight are happy
[1:20:59] because you're not you're not mixed up
[1:21:01] with the cares of the world all you care
[1:21:02] about is Christ have anybody happy
[1:21:05] tonight for that yeah praise God
[1:21:10] amen remember there's only two kinds of
[1:21:15] Christians either you are bogged down by
[1:21:17] the cares of the world or your bringing
[1:21:19] forth fruit of the Holy Spirit love joy
[1:21:22] gentleness
[1:21:24] longsuffering aim ahead Alan ooh yeah
[1:21:27] but the lowest amount of fruit a
[1:21:30] Christian will bring forth is 30 so look
[1:21:35] at the leadership so every Christian
[1:21:37] who's born again the Holy Spirit has a
[1:21:40] portion of leadership 9 but then another
[1:21:45] group has a double portion of leadership
[1:21:48] that's striking and then the last kind
[1:21:51] has above 3 right cuz 3 times 30 is 90
[1:21:55] my praise the Lord
[1:21:59] ah how many want to be led by the Holy
[1:22:04] Spirit
[1:22:04] well you got to become like a lamb then
[1:22:06] right we can say 9 lord help me to be a
[1:22:09] real Lamb of God so I can be led in such
[1:22:13] a way to bring forth a lot of fruit to
[1:22:17] the kingdom of God amen hallelujah so I
[1:22:26] don't want you to miss that one you know
[1:22:27] because how do you breathe air 31 glory
[1:22:31] I was thinking that you got like I
[1:22:33] wonder if brother Aaron's thirty years
[1:22:34] old you told me one time but I forgot ok
[1:22:39] the 19th ok phrase the Lord and so
[1:22:43] church this is encouraging let's say you
[1:22:44] know your past 30 or the young ones got
[1:22:46] a little waste of 30 little it'll go
[1:22:49] fast though you watch but see this is
[1:22:52] something we can all strive for god help
[1:22:54] me to take the leadership of the dove
[1:22:56] and help me to be a lamb to be led to
[1:22:59] bring forth fruits to God each one of us
[1:23:02] can take that attitude can't we teach me
[1:23:06] to be led so I can bring forth that's
[1:23:08] what I feel like you know writing the
[1:23:09] book doing the YouTube videos this is
[1:23:11] all me trying to humble myself so I can
[1:23:14] follow the leadership to be led to bring
[1:23:16] forth some fruit unto God at least a
[1:23:20] witness at least a testimony against
[1:23:22] people who hear it and won't receive it
[1:23:25] right just like the Queen of Sheba
[1:23:27] remember she's gonna be used she and
[1:23:30] then all the men of Nineveh are gonna be
[1:23:32] used against all the men of Jesus day
[1:23:34] praise God nah
[1:23:37] Gazi he's a little woman a little queen
[1:23:40] woman Queen Athena Sheba God's gonna use
[1:23:43] her to condemn all those millions of
[1:23:44] people with Aaron Jerusalem she crossed
[1:23:49] the deserts because of but there greater
[1:23:51] than Solomon she crossed it for a
[1:23:53] greater than Solomon right are you heard
[1:23:54] of greater in Solomon she just did it
[1:23:56] for Solomon but you could even cross the
[1:23:58] town to follow that rabbi when he
[1:24:01] preached to the temple she's gonna be
[1:24:04] used as a witness a church that's what
[1:24:06] you and I need to be we need to be
[1:24:07] witnesses to this message praise God if
[1:24:10] even if they won't
[1:24:12] at least we need to tell them at least
[1:24:13] we need to give a Bible give them a book
[1:24:15] give him a message book give them a link
[1:24:16] to the Internet give them a chance they
[1:24:19] hear this word that we loved so dearly
[1:24:22] and that we've left everything to follow
[1:24:25] and support this message amen hallelujah
[1:24:29] that's where I look at a brother here
[1:24:31] and I feel like I'm the I'm like one of
[1:24:33] these I'm just trying to just I'm not
[1:24:35] have to be a witness against people I
[1:24:37] would think of all these people have
[1:24:38] given the book to you of all these
[1:24:40] people that have seen heard preaching it
[1:24:42] and watch these YouTube videos there's
[1:24:44] not more that want to believe the
[1:24:46] message I got to remember I'm living in
[1:24:49] a day when there's few that will find it
[1:24:51] but I want to be a witness that Jesus
[1:24:54] can say but there's one little preacher
[1:24:56] there's one man of God who stood by it
[1:24:59] preached it you heard it you had a
[1:25:01] chance to hear it and he lived it and
[1:25:03] you got to be judged by his example I
[1:25:05] realize that might be part of our
[1:25:08] testimony your testimony my testimony
[1:25:10] but we've got to back up this message
[1:25:12] with all we've got amen because that
[1:25:17] might be what we're living for now
[1:25:25] betrayed by Judas for 30 pieces of
[1:25:28] silver
[1:25:30] did you know masters who slaves were
[1:25:34] slain by an ox were reimbursed 30
[1:25:36] shekels of silver did you know that it's
[1:25:38] like Jesus they looked at Jesus at all
[1:25:40] he's just about the he's as low as a
[1:25:42] slave thirty pieces of silver wasn't
[1:25:45] that much money because a slave yeah
[1:25:47] that's how much replace of slave for so
[1:25:51] Jesus was sold for thirty pieces of
[1:25:54] silver like a slave that's interesting
[1:26:01] do you know Noah's Ark was thirty cubits
[1:26:03] high
[1:26:05] do you know Israel mourn for Aaron and
[1:26:08] Moses for thirty days a piece how about
[1:26:12] did you know for thirty days God gave
[1:26:14] Israel flesh until it came out of their
[1:26:17] nostrils after they complained about
[1:26:20] wanting to go back to Egypt nine thirty
[1:26:24] straight days and of course you know
[1:26:30] thirty days is the prophetic length of a
[1:26:32] month because in Revelation 11:2 there's
[1:26:35] 42 months that the Prophet the two
[1:26:37] witnesses prophesy which is 1260 days so
[1:26:41] each month thirty days makes forty-two
[1:26:44] months of the Ministry of the two
[1:26:47] prophets praise God all right now
[1:26:51] there's not too many meanings for 31 to
[1:26:54] 49 not too many I could find and I'm
[1:26:57] gonna finish up here in a little bit I
[1:26:58] wanna try to make it to 40 there's not
[1:26:59] too much in here to 40 okay have you
[1:27:03] enjoyed this tonight praise the Lord
[1:27:06] I've enjoyed it I had a good time
[1:27:08] studying up it was really good so
[1:27:12] there's no scriptures in the book for
[1:27:15] numbers 31 to 39 but here's the one I
[1:27:18] found in Proverbs 31 is a godly woman
[1:27:22] there's 31 sets of spinal nerves which
[1:27:25] the wood Brotherhood calls the woman the
[1:27:27] backbone so the spy in the backbone so
[1:27:30] those two kind of go together Joshua
[1:27:32] smote 31 Kings and Josiah was a godly
[1:27:37] man reign for 31 years
[1:27:39] so interesting just throwing those
[1:27:41] numbers around there now I can't quite
[1:27:43] see one new pattern other than the godly
[1:27:45] woman 32 I couldn't find any
[1:27:53] but 33 Jacob had 33 daughters and sons
[1:27:58] when he left Canaan to go to Egypt and
[1:28:03] David reigned 33 years in Jerusalem
[1:28:06] Jesus lived 33 years so you see kind of
[1:28:11] like a period of rulership there kind of
[1:28:14] like a season of ruler ruling their
[1:28:20] reign that might be the word 35 this the
[1:28:25] only one I found solomon's pillars were
[1:28:27] 35 cubits high outside of the house of
[1:28:30] God the house of God was 30 cubits high
[1:28:32] we saw that earlier when he had pillars
[1:28:34] outside that were 35 tall they were
[1:28:37] actually higher than the actual house
[1:28:39] itself 36 there was 36 men and Joshua's
[1:28:46] army were slain because of achan's sin
[1:28:50] so 36 men slain interesting 37 second
[1:28:58] samuel 23:39 said there was 37 mighty
[1:29:02] men of David 37 last year what that is
[1:29:09] 38 there's a man that had a disease of
[1:29:13] infirmity and jesus healed him after 38
[1:29:16] days
[1:29:16] I'm sorry 38 years rather 38 years
[1:29:19] imagine suffering 38 years and jesus
[1:29:23] heals you 38 not sure why
[1:29:28] 39 this is interesting these two kind of
[1:29:30] go together there was 30
[1:29:35] nine stripes in a flogging huh me knows
[1:29:38] how many times Paul got a flogging five
[1:29:41] times five times he was flogged 39 times
[1:29:47] because they they the the Jews believe
[1:29:49] the 40th would kill you so five times
[1:29:53] remember he said he was in death oft
[1:29:56] write death oft he was close to death
[1:30:00] very often this servant of God 39
[1:30:04] stripes got him so close to death and
[1:30:07] then it's amazing the Paul himself wrote
[1:30:10] the law was supposed to be good but to
[1:30:13] me I found it to be death and there's 39
[1:30:16] books in the Old Testament and that's
[1:30:19] striking 39 looks like close to death
[1:30:25] all right let's close to this 144 T
[1:30:29] represents a temptation we might say a
[1:30:33] test or persecution now I'm just gonna
[1:30:36] have time to start this I'm not gonna
[1:30:38] finish this one so I want to save a
[1:30:39] little bit for Lord winning Sunday maybe
[1:30:42] Sunday we'll be able to finish 40 all
[1:30:43] the way up because there's not very many
[1:30:45] after this one I've already kind of read
[1:30:47] ahead a little bit this might there
[1:30:48] might be one or two more sermons left
[1:30:50] maybe one more now brother Anderson I'm
[1:30:54] typing something notice God how he's
[1:30:56] done this three times I think I've
[1:30:59] already read this one yeah 40 is the
[1:31:01] number of persecution I'm gonna skip
[1:31:03] right to that one 40 represents the
[1:31:05] persecution Moses he said in 40 days
[1:31:10] Mose was tempted 40 days Christ was
[1:31:11] tempted you see God is perfect in his
[1:31:14] numbers he says it again three is the
[1:31:17] perfect number we know seven is
[1:31:19] completion forties the temptation 50 is
[1:31:21] a Jubilee you know the mathematics of
[1:31:23] the scripture remember Jesus showed how
[1:31:29] or shoulder how it's done 40 days of
[1:31:32] temptation he was tempted above any man
[1:31:34] that ever could be tempted in the
[1:31:37] temptation of Jesus Christ watch he
[1:31:40] showed us how it's done honey I'm
[1:31:45] remember that Jesus tempted three times
[1:31:47] by Satan and brother BAM said that was
[1:31:50] more temptation than any man has never
[1:31:53] been tempted with that means no man's
[1:31:57] ever been hungrier than Jesus no man has
[1:32:02] ever had any more riches tempted tempted
[1:32:06] him than Jesus right or no man's ever
[1:32:09] been tempted more to do a miracle than
[1:32:12] Jesus Christ those three right from
[1:32:17] miracle food or power never no man
[1:32:21] none of us tomatoes stand there and say
[1:32:23] well Jesus it was harder for me actually
[1:32:25] to go through this temptation no man
[1:32:29] well I couldn't overcome because they
[1:32:31] offered me ten million dollars Jesus as
[1:32:33] they know I was offered a lot more than
[1:32:35] that all the kingdoms of this world
[1:32:38] right he said no man has ever been
[1:32:43] tempted above Jesus Christ look he
[1:32:48] showed us how it's done how'd he do it
[1:32:51] by the word that's I done it for he was
[1:32:53] the word in Jesus and if you abide in me
[1:32:55] and my words abide in you you were back
[1:32:57] to the word again the word a promise
[1:33:00] what is the word of promise to every
[1:33:03] Christian greater is He that's in you
[1:33:05] than he that's in the world and how do
[1:33:08] you overcome not me but the word that's
[1:33:12] in me see brother Branham couldn't
[1:33:14] overcome by just being a prophet the
[1:33:17] Prophet had to have the word in him amen
[1:33:20] his life it wasn't easier for him to
[1:33:23] overcome it was just as challenging and
[1:33:26] he had to stand there and let the word
[1:33:29] abide in him and he had to quote the
[1:33:32] word in order to overcome that ought
[1:33:35] encourages that if he can do it we can
[1:33:37] do it as well Dayman in fact I heard a
[1:33:42] quote last week I don't know which
[1:33:43] sermon it was but brother Ham was saying
[1:33:46] he said it's a lot harder for me to find
[1:33:48] the will of God than it is for you did
[1:33:50] you know he said that he said I have to
[1:33:53] sweat it out harder than you and he said
[1:33:55] the reason is because on my ministry
[1:33:57] impacts millions
[1:33:59] people and he said you pastors you just
[1:34:01] got one church you got to worry about
[1:34:02] he said I'm influencing millions of
[1:34:05] people by the tape ministry he said I
[1:34:08] sweated out a lot harder than you do
[1:34:11] right
[1:34:14] god help us just be faithful with our
[1:34:16] little ministries right right and
[1:34:20] realize brother Branham had it harder
[1:34:23] than we do yeah he saw a lot more
[1:34:25] visions but brother ham tells us in that
[1:34:27] quote it was it those visions weren't
[1:34:30] for him all the time many times they're
[1:34:31] frail the other people but he had to
[1:34:35] find the will of God he had to know what
