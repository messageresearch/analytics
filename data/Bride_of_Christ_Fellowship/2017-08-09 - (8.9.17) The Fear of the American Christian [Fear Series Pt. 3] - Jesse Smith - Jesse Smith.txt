tonight by the grace of Lord and I am sorry church got started a few minutes late I was out there talking brother John about his possible surgery and things like that so forgive me I lost track of time that's my fault so forgive me about God's grace okay a few prayer requests here about the grace of God the pastor that Simon talked about in Thailand brother Basheer sent me a message today said just keep the Saints in prayer there are six of his adult family members and two children are in prison still and little update on that and Simon said it's going to take an absolute miracle for them to get out because there's their family made youtube videos talking about all the persecution Muslims are putting on Christians in Thailand and the government found out and so now they're really there we're not going to any of them out of prison for any amount of money that's what Esther went to the lawyers and that's what they said so it's a really bleak situation how many believe though God tears down and raises up let me know that he uproots and plants so let's ask God for mercy for this family brother Bashir I also told brother John we'll pray for his medical situation there and then also I told by the Dustin my brother-in-law will pray for him by the grace of God recovering my wife had a request please keep praying for sister Karen Rolf her mom and the family she didn't have any updates today we just requested prayer for everybody so let's keep them in prayer by God's grace it's nice to see sister Kristen and the family there how's the brother Scott's stepfather okay wonderful amen let's go around Fogg praise Lord Lord for that thank you for the update there sister we have another testimony brother Samson Shetty on Monday morning after remember we prayed for his family said his whole family got the flu and on Monday morning I picked him up and he said mother Jessie he said my wife called me and said God did a miracle every single person in my family was healed last night they went to bed sick and everybody woke up healed that was about eight I think seven or eight people there by God's grace he said see brother that's the power of the prayer of the saints you know we prayed in Akron and God healed them over in India so we just love the Lord Jesus amen we can take any requests to the Lord and he's so merciful and so kind praise God okay just yeah that's the testimony and then one more announcement I have three questions and answers I'll do them on Sunday along with preaching a sermon but if you have any other questions or answers if you can get them into me by Saturday I can work on them and and do the questions and answers so I'll probably don't probably take ten minutes at the beginning of service and I'll make sure I cut the sermon short a little bit by God's grace but I got three questions and answers and I got those finished so if anybody else has anything else please let me know by the grace of the Lord okay I believe that's all we have tonight by God's grace any other needs on anybody's heart they'd like to share tonight I'm gonna have a sister who yeah amen praise the Lord will pray for that by the grace of the Lord amen praise the

pray you'd root up that government Lord and place a one that's tender toward Christians lord if it be thy will Lord all things are possible with our God Lord so father we ask that that his family members be released from prison if it be your will and for your glory dear Jesus we pray for sister Karen's family Lord and her mother Lord you've allowed surely Lord to be still alive this whole time father you're more than able to rise her up and take her home Lord we asked for your will Lord God I don't know your will but I'm asking for healing Lord if it be thy will Jesus comfort the family

for me he will be my guide hold me closely to his side with love and strength for each new day he will make a way he will make a man let's take our Bibles tonight let's go to Luke 21 verse 23 praise God all the saints pressing their way out to the house of God just trusting the Lord to speak to us here tonight Luke 21 verse 23 Luke 21 23 I'm going to continue the little series on fear I'm going to go back to the church ages Lord willing by God's grace but I'm just kind of feeling inspired to preach on fear a little more Luke 21 23 my title tonight is it though maybe you know interesting but it's called the fear of the American Christian the fear of the American Christian Luke 21 23 praise God of course I got that title from a quote from brother branham's I'm not making up my own thoughts you know Luke 21 23 praise God but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people now that's speaking of Titus's coming in AD 70 if you're familiar with that so he's speaking to his disciples the destruction of Jerusalem is being foretold now verse 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations right now they're coming back and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles I mean oh we're still the times of the Gentiles so see we're in this scripture a little bit but he's dealing with Israel but verse 25 we're actually gonna talk about verse 26 but let's read 25 and there should be signs in the Sun and the moon and in the Stars and upon the earth distress of Nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring verse 26 men's hearts failing them for fear that's kinda what we're gonna look at tonight and deal with that's how that's in the times of the Gentiles of course it's the whole world but it's specially the times the Gentiles and for looking after those things which are coming on earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory that will be at the end of the Tribulation Period when they see Christ coming in a cloud member Jesus told the Pharisees oh so you'll see me coming in a cloud a cloud of glory now verse 28 and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh that's speaking to the 144,000 right Christ comes back bro Graham said then he destroys the armies we preach on that in the Book of Daniel remember that he destroys the Rome and all the armies trying to destroy Israel then he reveals himself to Israel but we want to look at men's hearts failing them for fear it's speaking of all the men's hearts during the times of the Gentiles and of course in the tribulation we want to look at the fear of the American Christian tonight how many American Christians we got in here so we all need God's grace amen let's have word of Prayer Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord and father we're just taking these scriptures Lord because they're true it's you're inspired word these are eternal words Heavenly Father and I pray God just ministered to us tonight by the Holy Spirit help me to get completely out of your way may the people hear from heaven tonight they've come so faithfully drove many miles sacrifice other things Lord and father there's no greater sacrifice than to sacrifice for you dear Lord so receive our sacrifices of our time of our praises Lord of everything that we our Lord Jesus may we be living sacrifices and speak to us Lord for we all battle the fear of the American Christian so strengthen us now tonight Lord for your glory in Jesus Christ's name and every said Amen god bless you B and C there praise the Lord fear of the American Christian and I'm gonna set a timer here so I don't go too long on Wednesday night I want to be real careful to be just watchful of time you know our society is so busy I mean Oh America's so busy we're so and we just have to be you know work schedules and everything it's so busy so I want to be mindful of the time so we started in Luke 21 and we saw how Jesus was speaking to the Jews saying there's gonna come a tight us and he's gonna worry he's gonna divide Israel scattered all nations and Jerusalem be trodden down until the times of the Gentiles are finished and they said men's hearts failing them for fear speaking of this end times but then he said when you see the Son of man coming he said lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth 9 in other words he's going to redeem the 144,000 but how many know that our heads should be lifted up right now because our redemption is right now amen the Bible said today's the day of salvation today's the day of deliverance for the Christian amen so we're grateful for God's mercy grateful for a season you know I was talking with brother Simon and he was sharing our brother cam was preaching on the church ages a few years ago and he took the thought from the Thyer tear in church age about Jezebel how God gave her a space to repent I remember that and brother cam had a great thought and I just was and I was praying on my knees yesterday just crying thanking God thinking about this thought God told the church age I'm gonna give you space to repent and I remember how long that church age was almost 900 years and I was just weeping yesterday worshiping how God is so merciful he gave the Roman Catholic Jezebel run Church almost 900 years to repent how many believe in God's mercy today you know we think Oh God's done with me or you know guys had enough of me God is rich in mercy Church and if he gave a woman Jezebel a Jezebel he gave the Jezebel system 900 years to repent and that thyroids here in church age if he gave them 900 years how about that how about the Gentile Church age how about you and I who love Him who are not according creeds and dogmas we just get mind battles and we just get discouraged from time to time how much more is God's mercy for you and I Amen we're not worshiping a pope or we're not you know worshiping a creed or something like that we're just trying to serve God and we go through our battles like we all do and it just made me weep and I'm rejoicing praising God great is your mercy great is your faithfulness thank God His mercy is new every morning amen hallelujah joy I mean no joy comes in the morning amen we have a rough night sorrow comes the night but joy comes in the morning hallelujah that's exactly right great is his faithfulness now just to review member brother Ram said Jesus always said fear not he constantly told people don't fear fear now Sunday we're looking at Joshua I'm gonna tell them I already got my message ready for Sunday so I already know I'm gonna preach it's gonna be Joshua fear not so you like that I think you'll like it we're gonna type out the invasion of the promised land I think you're really gonna like it I at least I am so you can you can't rejoice over it and just rejoice because I'm gonna enjoy it by God's grace I'm gonna type the hittites and the perizzites and the jebusites we're a type that all the Canaanites and see what that stands for because guess what you and I are than the Joshua army today how many know that we're the Josh army and we've got to drive out the inhabitants in this land amen but jesus said always said fear not but man said do not fear don't fear don't do it if you do then God can't work with you but if you do believe then God can work with you how many want God to work with you you just have to believe you just have to cast out all fear and remember how we said it you have to repent and remember the goodness of God leads you to repentance so if you're all caught up and struggling like we all get - we all get down and go get the blues and we all get discouraged from time to time if you're down remember how much God loves you remember his goodness repent and that will make you full of love and use that love to cast out any more doubt aim and then the Bible says that love wants all fears gone that love will actually operate your faith because love faith operates by love according to Galatians 5:6 and then your faith can go into work hallelujah to have faith to confess God's Word and that's what we're gonna see about the american christian tonight brother Branham said everything is don't fear so everything in your life no matter what trouble you're in whether its financial relationship church problems whatever it is brother Anderson no matter what the situation is in every situation you must not fear aim everything is don't fear about death don't fear about sickness don't fear about money don't fear about all these things have faith in God amen everything is don't fear he says the greatest thing I've ever found among Christian people throughout the world has been fear they're always afraid a little sickness strikes they're afraid now I'm going another quote one of the greatest curses of the church today is fear everybody's scared to death what's going to happen who what why jesus said when you see fearful signs lift up your head for redemption draws nigh you know this week I was I drove brother Sampson yesterday uh to Lima and then drove back last night and we were stopped at the McDonald's and all over the news was just ah how it's gonna be nuclear war pretty soon as you know North Korea has bombs and I guess our presidents talking big talk or something like that well charge we don't know the future but we know one thing the Bible said they're gonna be saying peace and safety peace and safety then come a sudden destruction we don't know how many wars we don't know all these things but we must not let this news get to us we must stand on the Word of God brother Branham lived in the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis remember that he lived throughout those days and they had those bomb shelters my wife's grandparents have that shelter that basement where you open up the doors and when I was little my grandparents said you an outside way to get down in the basement case there was a bomb I forget what those are called but sellers you know get in the cellar really fast and in his day it was a great a great stress but brother Adam would always say just type in the wings of Jehovah and the message and you'll find it brother Ram would say we're not to worry about you know getting under concrete or or getting under the ground he said all we have to do is get under the mighty wings of Jehovah eagle amen he said and we'll find our rest right there how many one arrest under the wings of Jehovah men I imagine you get nice and warm by his love amen if he's if you're gathered in as his brood as his family praise God and if you feel far from Christ well then get a little closer to him tonight because he's calling you to get closer amen hallelujah I got a quote and I don't have it in front of me but brother Adam said somebody had given a bomb threat to one of his meetings and he said we into the meeting he was actually preaching and there's a bomb threat and he said what do we have to be afraid of if the bomb goes off we'll be in the presence of God look at look at his perspective and Paul said remember to live I'm sorry to die is what gain Paul said in Philippians it's better for me if I die because I go right to the presence of God but what do you say it's better for you if I live so what did God let him do God let him live right after riding the Philippian letter which we're gonna get to tonight but we're willing he wrote all kinds of other letters and still traveled and did other things but Paul said it's actually better for me if I die but it's better for you if I live oh my that should be our attitude right that no matter what happens we're trusting in God and if something would happen we'll be in the presence of God amen a matter of five minutes amen hallelujah again he says the greatest thing I find against the church and I is fear everybody's scared to death about something he said what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy carefree just like those fellows singing specials up here and the brother testifying back there just free there ain't nothing that can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus God has promised amen hallelujah remember these now here's the quote I got my title from this is from the infallible proof the resurrection in 1997 now brother randoms he's laying a foundation how in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and program said when God spoke that word let there be light he said we don't know how many years it was but at some point there formed a little light called the logos right the pillar of fire another way we could call it a theophany you know something like that he said God's Word is just as good as he is his word is just as eternal as he is how many could say amen to that and then he talks about how God slain Jesus in his mind before the foundation or which is scriptural the Bible said the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world and he said that was just as real in the mind of God as it was on Calvary 2,000 years ago that word that promise was just as eternal and bro Graham says this he said he was slain back there before the foundation roll and God for saw and knew what he would do and he spoke the word it was finished back there in his mind and brother Branham said let me give you a little courage how many want a little courage tonight I could use something oh I'm gonna be a little stronger don't you he said let me give you a little courage which I find amongst the American Christians is that great lack he said is fear so Christians are and we said American Christians in 1961 four years before he goes off the earth the great lack amongst Christians is a lack of faith and it's a presence of fear that's that what you want me to keep preaching or it can we be done right there would you like to hear more yeah I thought mine that struck me American Christians after traveling the world these times American Christians their great battle is fear the American Christian seems to be afraid that God won't keep his word mine and of afraid if you just don't squeeze or hold on to something so he said you got Chris American Christians always got to have something to hold on to like which there's nothing wrong with it but like let's just say a prayer cloth or hold on to a Bible or hold on to you know I always got to have something that's what he notices now he tries it Kirsten here's the word of encouragement he said it's nothing that you could do in the beginning it's what God has done how many know Americans are taught from a young age you got to do something you got to work hard it's on you you're responsible how many how many how many raise that way I was always raised that way fifth grade I had a paper out Jesse go on your own money he want these baseball cards you wanted a new cleats for baseball season you go work for it it's always on us right sir always like well I've got to do something I've got to do something mother ham tries to remind us though and give us courage that with God it's nothing that you and I could do it was already in God's mind from the beginning it's what God has already done for us amen like a few Wednesday's ago I preached on the just shall live by faith that was that was life-changing for me I don't know if it was for you but it was for me since then I've just been so carefree about my salvation it was such a delivering time for me because Mel Bram said we have nothing to do with it it's not nothing but the blood of Jesus and my own good conduct we don't think that it's nothing but the blood of Jesus and all the all the prayer and fasting I did write our salvation is Jesus only it's not Jesus plus something else it's Jesus only and then when we are filled with God's love for his great gift were freely justified God doesn't justifies because of what we done he justifies us because of what Christ done but if that's the right grammar pardon me I know my grammar is pretty awful but forgive me it's not what you have done it's what God has done my dad said you never saw God though you thought you did glory he says this lost my spot but the Bible claims you didn't know man seeks God his nature from the Garden of proves that he's a coward and runs when he sins how many can say amen to that when you sin what do what do you not usually do when we send you should we run away from God usually we run away from the word or away from the person we sinned against that proves were a failure to begin with amen I had somebody text me this week and not from this church anything like that and they said Jesse they said you know you live so close to God and you're they said you live such a high life we can I could never reach that point and I wrote back and said no I'm a failure to begin with because it's not what I can do it's what Christ already did for me so see that person is and I love them to death but they're exalting me way up here and they don't see they don't hang around me they don't live with me they don't come to church here I make mistakes uh-uh am i sanctified absolutely am I filled the Holy Ghost I believe with all my heart absolutely but they don't see my bad spots and I try to reassure them brother Branham said I'm always affair to begin with jesus said apart from me we can do nothing praise God let me know what we're talking about and when we said when I say when you said many times we don't run right to repent right away although we should sometimes we kind of linger to repent we don't we don't reckon fess right away we don't make that right right away I mean know what I'm talking about none of us are perfect so we've got to remember that that we often run away from God's presence when we ought to run to it praise God the program says this it wasn't Adam calling God it was God calling Adam it wasn't Jesse calling God it was God calling Jesse amen you put your name in there wasn't you calling god it was God calling you and I Amen what do we have to fear he says let me give you some courage you had nothing to do with it God's in control of your life amen so what am I trying to do today we're trying to look at the sovereignty of God yes I know last month I preached on good works that's looking at you know your personal decision and dying to yourself which Paul said I must keep my body and bring it under subjection right there's a there's a place for that but if we step back and look at the sovereignty of God the plan of God our lives are in his nail-scarred hand amen I told a family that today we're leaving Target and they said why you got a lot of children I said that's just the half of it I've got three at home I had three with master that's just half of it I got three at home they said my you got your hands full I said but all my life and all my children are in his nail-scarred hands and those women said glory I said amen we could have a rejoicing session target Amen hallelujah because we're in his hands amen he's the one guiding he's the one calling he's the one teaching us he's the one encouraging us amen and brother BAM ends by saying this and the Bible says that you might rest assure that's me tonight I want to rest assure that your names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life those of you were in the body of Christ tonight was written a lands book of life before the foundation of the world church we hear that so often knowing we hear that so often that we forget how important that is for you and I how many can say Amen to the head we hear before the foundation world so much preachers before the foundation and if we're not careful we'll let that become common to us but we've got to keep that fresh don't you want to keep that fresh we cannot let God's Word become common and brother man this is my brother him says to give you courage you American Christians hallelujah that God chose you before the foundation world he called you so he's gonna keep taking care of you hey man hallelujah so what I wrote here is assure your reassure yourself of God's foreknowledge in your life and how he has called you but the Adam did you go looking for the message or did it come looking for you I could do that with everybody tonight I wasn't raised to the messenger I wasn't going looking for an hour seek there was something my heart desired more but I didn't go looking for God came and found me hallelujah Amen jesus said there's no man that seeks God it is God that seeketh man amen take yourself back there that will give you courage amen that will give you strength because our baton America is a great amount of fear rather than faith all the time so I believe that we need to keep preaching faith I need to I believe we need to keep this in two sermons that are raising faith amen and I'm trying to move that way as well I'm a teacher by nature I like to teach things now I love it when the Holy Spirit can come in here and show us the true doctrine on Daniel there - true doctrine on marriage and divorce I love that it thrills my soul because I love to teach the Word of God but I'm seeing that as myself as an American Christian I needed some more sermons on faith amen because that's what the American Christian is going to battle praise the Lord programs praying in Arkansas and he says Lord give us great faith Lord that's what we're needing is a stimulation of faith a stirring how many could use a stirring in their life to stir up the Bible says up your mind by way of remembrance so when when the Holy Spirit brings something to hear your remembrance it's supposed to stir you up amen it's supposed to make you encouraged you're supposed to give you a new renewed strength it's supposed to refresh you amen glory he said we look across and think of the lands tonight down through the many countries the poor people sitting I think of America and all its great education and great seminaries great churches and cathedrals and yet in all of it it's lost the rains are falling and they build their ecclesiastical concrete troughs that runs the rain off of the people and says it's for another day but the heathen in the parched lands are holding up their hands to receive it God send laborers to the harvest quickly we're in desperate need they're just here lingering along in the homeland before shoving across the seas where I believe you'll save a half a million souls so see brother man recognizes in America there's often a lack of faith I hope it encourage you on Sunday - those testimonies encourage you on Sunday brother Benjamin experiencing a great healing there sister sister Marie doesn't even have a CD in her car and it starts playing brother Branham doesn't have her phone on and it starts playing brother branham God wanted her to hear that message then that encourage you josè praying for Jose's loved ones and Samuel and that that woman from New York amen doesn't that encourage you brother Samson telling us said God heard our prayers and his families healed that ought to raise the faith of American Christians amen to see the power of God in our lives remember I told you to study nights ago I was going to feel like I was going to throw up and some faith rose up in me and I spoke to that mountain of sickness and I said get behind me I'm in line I'm in my post of duty I don't have time to be sick and within a matter of moments it had vanished and I was just walking out there praising the Lord amen we must speak to that mountain and watch it move amen glory here you him 1956 when I was talking about again about America and he talks about South Africa how when he had service there they had truckloads he said Carlos seven carloads truckloads cattle trucks of crutches wheelchairs and everything off the ground thirty thousand raw heathens come to Christ at one altar call can you imagine thirty thousand people receive Christ at one time and had truckloads I saw it on Facebook brother Don Ferran from Minnesota went to South Africa this last week and he met someone who saw those seven truckloads drive through South Africa because he used to work he was the worker in the hotel in South Africa when brother Branham was looking out the window and seven truckloads of crutches one of the workers there he met the worker and shook his hand got a picture with him he was there in the 50s when God did a great thing thirty thousand people saved hum you know this message is true praise God then he posted I shared this a few months or last year maybe then he went back to the South African village in just a village and he took a picture with his sister who was healed of paralysis in 2006 he took a fresh picture with her and they're all smiling praising God she couldn't walk and his testimony was they prayed for her and left and she wasn't healed until three days later and now she's walking around and the paralysis is gone I mean oh there's power in the Word of God and I swear you know as American Christian oftentimes were I battles I kind of get discouraged if I don't see something happen right away anybody relate to me that's just that I throw I've got to overcome many time you know because I've seen gods do so many things instantly if I'm not careful in my flesh I feel like it has to happen again but God is teaching me just to speak that word believe it move on and then watch God go to work amen sand still and let God move amen speak the Word of God so three days later this pair paralyzed woman gets up and walks away in the name of Jesus Christ there's power in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah nobody ever says this about Americans he talks about South Africans how they have so much faith he said but oh we Americans mine we're so scholarly and so untouchable you know we know all about it and see as Christians we have as Americans we have English you know we have the message in English we have all the sermons and if we're not careful we'll think we'll we know more about it than other nations he said but that's the reason God can't get in he says you won't listen how many one listen to the Holy Spirit innate we get so scholarly we think we know everything that we won't even listen to simple preaching he says that's the reason the church is not progressing he says now I'm gonna go to the next one in Lima Ohio he talks about how 30,000 were healed from one prayer he said oh how I wish that could happen in America but I'm wondering he said we're so highly educated on until modern times not to down education but we get so educated until we educate ourselves out of the Bible I want to be educated to the Bible it's good to be educated I'm a schoolteacher I love education I love seeing kids learn and I love it I reward them I rejoice with them I love education but our greatest education would be spiritual education amen to humble ourselves and be taught the humble simple Word of God amen he said no he said if we're not careful we seem to want to know more about the Bible than God knows about it he says in that ashame if we're not careful whoa we'll act like we know more about the message or the the Bible then God knows about it and how do we do that we come to church and we're not interested or we're not really pulling on the word and we don't think we need to know anything else that's the spirit of later to see how many know that the spirit layer to see is I'm rich and increased with Goods and I don't have any need of anymore of God that's what we've got to overcome today US American Christians amen he said in doing that we fail to find the simplicity of faith praise God and we remember we went up we went over the simplicity if we don't have faith we just repent we see how much God loves us we repent with you and then we're happy if we repent we're happy God corrected us we should be full of love use that love to cast out any remaining doubt right any fear and then let that love now since love is filling your mind let it operate and move by faith by speaking the Word of God amen hallelujah now this is a different quote the greatest hindrance in the church is fear they're afraid that it just won't work he says well if you if for you he said will not work that way it must be absolutely believers not make believers but believers from your heart how many can relate to that quote there are so there been so many times in my Christian walk where I where we spoken the word and God has done great things right we believe God's where we prayed the prayer of faith but there's been other times in our lives where we've been kind of scared to just speak the Word of God how many know what I'm talking about because if you talk to some of that sick you know you might have an unction to kind of speak the word and you know just believe God's Word but he says American Christians will struggle with fear and he said we're scared that the prayer or the speaking the word just won't work yeah I think we can relate to that he says the greatest hindrance the Christian Church has his fear just a try at it now Christianity is not a try at it it's a no so it's something that is real praise the Lord it's not a hope so well I'll try it out you know people say that all the time well I'm taking a step of faith what they mean is they're just guessing you remember people say that I'm gonna take a step of faith but really they're saying I'm just gonna guess a step of faith is the greatest step it's the most assured step you'll ever take because faith is a revelation of the Word of God that is a substance in your soul you every understand that a step of faith is the safest step you'll ever take it's not a hope so it's I know so amen sorry that's what a step of faith is but people use it like a step of hope that's how they use it well I hope this works I'm gonna take a step of faith they're misusing the word faith faith is you already have a substance you already know God's Word you already know God won't fail Amen that's right so see Christianity is not a triad well I hope God forgives me I hope he you know when I repent I hope he forgives me of my sins I hope he fills me with the Holy Ghost it's a reality I know he forgave me I know he promised to fill me with the Holy Ghost I know I'll get it and I don't know I'll keep serving God all the days of my life hey it's a no so praise the Lord Amen now two years ago in 2015 I preached a series on divine healing you probably member it I called it works you know his faith expressed by the RAM sermon brother Branham tells you he says and I'm just gonna paraphrase because I want to save time you might remember the sermon brother Branham preached it he said you could come up for prayer and get in the prayer line he said I could pray for you all night but if you don't receive it nothing will ever happen in other words if you don't have a revelation he said nothing will happen laram says this exact quote I'm quoting now I can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe can we wrap our minds around that tonight you can't make yourself believe God has to give it to you I'm gonna say Lord give me the revelation hey give me the revelation you can't work your way into it have you ever tried to work your way into it I'll just keep saying over and over again that's a good thing to do it on any promise that you know is right but sometimes we try to do it and it just don't work because we can't work ourselves into it God has to give it to you that's why we pray for revelation more than anything else reveal your word to me Lord it's a gift of God to believe it's not your faith how many know that but it's God's faith praise God we say God give me your faith for this situation sorry Jesus give me your faith for the situation I will not conquer by my human faith but I'll conquer by the supernatural faith you gave me because it's your own faith Paul said I live this life not by my faith but by the faith of the Son of God how many member that from the scripture that's from Galatians the life I live I don't live by the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God tonight I'm living by Jesus's faith amen I'm preaching tonight not by my faith but I faith in Jesus's faith that he said preach the word hallelujah preach the word and these signs shall follow them that believe amen hallelujah it's not your faith it's God's faith your intellectual faith might believe it fine but unless the faith of God is doubt in your heart here's what he says your intellectual faith can accept it and do that he said and just keep believing it with all your heart until God does reveal it to you so here's where we have the balance we can try to work ourselves into it but I would say this brother Anderson quote the word that you already know and believe okay so for example how many believe by His stripes I'm healed don't be that by His stripes you were already healed how many know the Bible says that it says in Isaiah 53 and also says in first Peter I believe chapter 2 if I'm not mistaken by whose stripes you were already healed if that's all we can believe then keep quoting all you can believe until God reveals what you need for that situation with me so for example let's say in the case of let's say John or Dustin or you can put anybody in there maybe sister Shirley you can put anybody in there if we're not I'm not sure exactly what it is but one thing I'm sure of is that God is a healer and that God has already healed them I don't know his will right for this maybe this individual situation but brother Ram said keep confessing the word that you do know until God reveals his perfect will for that situation are you with me Church and that's what we've been trying to in prayer just keep praying just keep interceding show us your will reveal your will to us let me tell this little testimony remember brother Benjamin Gandy on Sunday okay we have a good testimony his girlfriend was in an awful situation uh involved violence and guns and she was shot now she's still alive by the grace of the Lord I just want encourage you honey remember of Benjamin's grandpa that preached over in that that sanctuary Benny Gandhi remember an older gentleman wonderful brother he preaches Sunday night for us one time remember him well Benjamin's a former girlfriend I believe I'm not mistaken she been shot and they didn't they the doctors did not think she was gonna live in his distress he caught up his grandfather and church I don't know how many bullets I think it was around nine it was awful I visit her in the hospital we prayed for her I remember that we went to her prayed for her try to encourage a family but he called his grandfather one night I think it was that night or the next night I forget he could correct me on that he said grandfather grandfather she gonna die and I guess he went to prayer I believe any come back on the phone and he said she's going to be alright and brother Benjamin took that now this is in the face of seeing her with nine bullets comatose and he took that word and believed that word and she's out I've seen her she's out of the hospital she's been out for a while now but the doctors weren't sure and they were assuring the family's not sure and she's in a coma but the word came after pray she's gonna be alright hey do not fear God's Word is God's Word is true praise the Lord and that's what we can do we can just breathe a simple prayer and say Lord what's your will give me reveal your will for this situation is it going to happen or not is it going to be all right or not and church if we pray and ask God how many know God will reveal to you see it's that channel prayer that we find the perfect will of God amen perfect faith program says you must believe what you ask for if you're a believer recognize yourself as a believer recognize that these things are for you do you ever do that when you pray you have to remind yourself oh I'm a Christian I'm a child of God right I'm more than a servant you know the servants get the crumbs that fall from the master's table but you and I are sitting at the master's table how many understand that we are the family of God hallelujah and the Prophet says recognize who you are recognize that you're a child of God no where's Lord I come to you I'm your servant I'm your child I'm your daughter I'm your son I'm your servant and I come with faith in my heart knowing that you told me to come praise God did Jesus invite you to pray to Him absolutely he said ask anything in my name and I'll do it praise God get two or three degree on touching on on earth touching anything and it shall be done in heaven he invited us to pray aren't you glad you're invited to pray amen if there's condemnation your life straighten that out first he said that you can have anybody if you don't have if you have condemnation you can have anybody pray for you and it won't work because you're condemned in your heart we got to repent and get the sin out of our lives praise the Lord he said God if condemnation is in your heart remember that's first John chapter 2 I'm if I'm not mistaken if contact condemnation in your heart God will not come into that heart condemned God won't draw them that God you've got to make that right and then when you do you must have faith if everything's right you must have faith and believe don't be afraid praise God see we got to get anything done confess we got to get that out and we got a ask God Lord purged my heart so I can believe Lord remind me who I am in Christ Jesus remind me that I'm just not I'm not the scum of the earth like sometimes the devil tells me remind me that I'm not just some castaway remind me that I'm a true child of God remind me of my position in Christ Jesus I am now seated in heavenly places and you might not see it but when we're in Christ we are already seated in heavenly places praise God this is for the believer you're not sitting down in condemnation you know or some area of some judgment or something like that you are seated in heavenly places and we have a right to these things he asked us to come and we're the ones that will come we're the ones that will pray we're the ones that will intercede amen that's exactly right Gloria and we know that we will conquer by love how me know love is the greatest conquering force we must fill our hearts with God's love and that love will conquer whatever we're fearing at that time praise the Lord okay I got twenty minutes I'll closed in twenty minutes I by the grace Lord because I just got to my spot where it says closing on my note so I did work that out pretty good by the grace of the Lord hallelujah go to John 14 if you got your Bibles go down 14 I'm sorry I don't I don't put many quotes up here lately I've just been preaching off my notes of hope that's okay let's go to John 14 I want to close with these kind of thoughts here John 1425 you got your Bibles here I'm gonna close with Jesus's words Jesus says let not your heart be afraid what do american christians battle most the prophet tells us fear we're scared to try it I've had brother Tim Myers and now even brother Samson Shetty was telling me how people over there you know in foreign nation they're so poor oh yeah Tim iris told me one time that the people stayed after service and somewhere in Africa and he said they the ministers left the service the people were shouting rejoicing and they drove by two hours later after supper and the people are still there shouting and praising God and worshiping and thanking God for His Word now you know God honors faith like that church praise the Lord have any of us ever done that just just to kind of give us an encouragement you know or to give us so maybe we need a little rebuke yeah sometimes it's because we don't pray long enough sometimes it's just a simple two-minute prayer woman to prayer and that's fine but if we were only we really want to get down with business how did Jacob overcome he had to wrestle all night praise the Lord he had to wrestle in prayer in other words that's for us had to wrestle and prayer that's what the Prophet said he said people would sit out in the rain for his meetings all day just for him to pray for them one time and he said you know God honors faith like that he said God wants God lets you go through hard times so you'll appreciate the blessing when it comes right cuz we know anyone that's born with a silver spoon in their mouth you ever heard that saying they don't appreciate it if you're born with for example all my friends in high school as soon as I turn 16 they got a brand-new car you ever seen your friends get that but then they wreck it or they treat it like trash because they don't appreciate it that's what program says about faith if God just gave us everything a brand-new car gave us everything we want he said we wouldn't know the value of faith how many understand that that's how it is in the spiritual - God lets us get down and pray remember John the Baptist said don't take the kingdom of God easily you take up the violent take it by force in other words you got to press your way past your flesh into the Holy Spirit huh me know you got to plant things of the spear in order to harvest things of the spirit huh me know that the Bible says if you you'll reap whatever you sow right if you plant work if you sow worldliness and so laziness that's what you're gonna harvest right if you plant spiritual things if you plant faith if you plant fastings and prayers and crying out to god you're gonna reap the blessings of that hallelujah it's exactly right because if not you won't appreciate it remember Jesus learned obedience how did Jesus learn obedience by the things that he suffered praise the Lord praise the Lord he had to suffer in order to learn to obey sometimes we wonder why we Lord why am i suffering so you obey next time so obey so appreciate appreciate character building praise God God's building my character we'd appreciate character building we'll appreciate the hard times amen I won't appreciate the hard times don't you John 1425 these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you what a promise like I said a few weeks ago we'd have to worry about what we're gonna say the Holy Ghost will give you what to say in that hour that's why we're giving the Holy Ghost we have to worry about don't have to wonder not to be fearful the Holy Ghost will give you what you need in that hour verse 27 I'm gonna get down here peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid so Jesus gives us two opposites one is the fear and the other is peace now we call that faith to it you understand that's interchangeable because you have faith in God so you're at peace right but Jesus gives us these and did you notice he said I'm leaving it with you I'm not leaving you the peace of the world you know we were reading in Ecclesiastes the other night and it says a man who's satisfied with silver won't be satisfied with silver when he goes to bed he said well you won't sleep well you guys remember that from last night milk I don't know if guys remember that Lydia I don't know in case you remember that but the Bible said if you are satisfied with silver then yours when you go to sleep you won't be satisfied see because there's no real peace in worldly things there's only peace in the love of Jesus Christ and he that's what he's saying here notice he puts the responsibility of being in the state of fear or peace who's he put it on he puts it on you he puts it on me because he said let not your heart be troubled don't notice don't let your condition be a fearful condition let your condition be peaceful so Jesus puts it on us he said I'm leaving peace I'm leaving my peace and don't let your heart be full of fear let it be filled with peace oh what a privilege so we cannot say well brother Jesse and you know I can't stop being afraid I can't stop it I can't stop worrying I can't stop fretting I can't stop wondering if we confess that that's what we're gonna get we cannot say that because life and death we know is in the power of the tongue and Jesus said let not your hearts be afraid glory now don't get me wrong Church there's a balance with everything as a teacher I always say this there's a balance I know a wonderful woman denominational Christian a fantastic person has shown great kindness to my family and my wife but this individual this sister struggles greatly with anxiety greatly and has she's had me when I testified us americo she had me pray for her and said you got better then you know she's just constantly struggling with it every time we go back she's always talking about my anxiety my anxiety so in other words what I'm saying is that's kind of like her battle remember brother Ram said what was his bad remember his battle he's a nervous person Lord Ram said he was a nervous person he always battled that just being nervous can anybody relate to that tonight a nervous person just nervous about everything oh I do this then you have you know the carefree people that they're hardly worried about anything and I've met some of those people they're so carefree they hardly get anything done but then the people that are so nervous they try they think they get everything done and then they feel like they got nothing done and they sit there and guilt and they condemn them yeah yet they got so much done during the day you see but that's their battle that's program calls that's their that's their genetic makeup right that's their spiritual makeup in other words that's how that's how they're built and so this individual constantly talks about anxiety attacks and one time I posted something on Facebook I was reading in Proverbs I think it was and the Bible said do not have sudden fear I think was Ecclesiastes have no sudden fear when things come upon you don't get scared of and that that individual you know responded right away and said thank you Jesus that's just what I needed to hear this morning and that scripture lifted the spirit of that individual who struggles with anxiety because the Bible said we don't have to have that we don't have to confess that we don't have to stay like that because jesus said don't let your heart you're the one who controls your atmosphere praise God you're the one that controls whether you live in fear or whether you live in peace I say let's live in peace amen let's be American Christians that overcome the greatest hindrance of the church and let's have faith and let's not live in fear praise God Isaiah 26:3 says thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee what uh what a condition that is how many how many striving for that condition perfect peace Isaiah said this is Old Testament so it was possible the Old Testament it's possible now I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind stays on me because they're trusting in me so see we have a choice it's going back some closing guy with the the battle of the mind we can have victory in the battles of our minds go to Philippians 1 verse 7 go to Philippians 1 verse 7 while you're turning there I'm going to close with these thoughts or flip pians 1:7 and I got 13 minutes Wow praise the Lord it's a lot of time go to Philippians 1:7 you and I control our hearts men's hearts will be failing for fear Americans struggle so much with fear but let not your hearts be afraid in other words try not to let it happen like my man said don't don't fear if you fear God can't work with us will he save us and deliver us yeah of course he will his mercy extends even when we can't have the victory his mercy will extend to us but we also want to walk in the promises that he gives to us amen we want to inherit all the divine promises like Peter said we want to be a partaker of the divine nature a man ha ha ha ha in other words I see a lot of my carnal nature I see a lot of the carnal Jesse Smith come out I want to see the divine Jesse Smith come out I want to see the God part into me I want to see that part manifest yeah I see the carnal Jesse Smith all the time tired or upset or worried but I want to see that divine part I want to see that seat of God in my soul I want to see that Express they men the divine nature inside of me I want to live from that praise God flippy ins 1:7 now you're there I'm there let me give you some background so you just look at me for a moment if you want or you can look at your Bible there Paul wrote this letter from prison to the church in Philippi this church was founded in acts 16 a European Church Philip I was a Roman colony and the history I saw says that retired Roman soldiers a lot of retired Roman soldiers lived there and there's a lot of business it was known as a patriotic City which in other words they're very faithful to Rome so much so that Christians were persecuted in Philippi because we see Paul we find Paul in prison for what being a Christian preaching the gospel so this is the background on the book of Philippians how many appreciate that I prefer got about that and I was reminded that this morning I thought praise the Lord here's a man writing from prison which you and I I don't think anybody in here has been in prison if you have sorry you know it's all must be awful thing to do that have happened to you maybe you know how that is but a lot of us can't relate to that I can't like that I'm never been in a prison before I've been in football camp that was like a prison but it wasn't actually a prison yeah I've been in hospital that was kind of seem like a prison I can't move I got surgery and I seem like a prison but none of us have really probably been locked up before but Paul is locked up in a prison and he's writing this letter now look at verse 7 Philippians 1:7 even as it is meat for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart and that beautiful the prophet had the church in his heart I hope this church is in your heart in other words I hope when you're not here you pray for us and you think of us I hope when I'm not around that you pray for me because I'm praying for you I want I want to be in your heart I want to I want to be your friend right I want to be your pastor I wanna be your your brother in the Lord I want to be in your heart because you're in my heart in as much as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel you are partakers of my grace so see he's in bonds he tells you right there I'm in bonds I ain't even remembering you while I'm in prison now I would think as just a human out I might be so discouraged in prison I'd forget about everybody else and I just haven't I might have a pity party on myself you know because I'm in prison I have no freedoms but Paul even in prison all's he can think about is the church know what a heart what a heart of love what a real sincere Christian Paul was a man fill with the Holy Ghost now go to chapter 4 I'm closing here I got about 8 more minutes flip pins 4 I just want to prove that to you by the scripture he's in jail he's in jail writing this letter and he writes about how you can keep your mind pure which were familiar with but let's go through it slowly flip ins 4 let's go there verse 3 Philippians 4 3 he's in prison and I entreat thee also true yoke fellow says the other their fellow laborers help those women which labored with me in the gospel with Clement also with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the book of life that's a beautiful scripture you see Paul says all those people that work with me their names in the book of life just like my name's in little house book of life see Church when you work with the message of the hour see where your names at it's in heaven verse 4 rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice a man in prison is telling them rejoice be happy let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing so see don't be anxious for anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God so Paul and imprison says don't be anxious about anything now he can't say that unless he knows what it's all about right he can't preach this unless he knows what it's about and he's telling the people this thing he's saying don't be anxious cuz I'm not anxious I'm in prison and I'm not even anxious because I prayed and I've asked God for his will now look what it says everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God Church stop stop a minute think about your prayers when you ask God for something today did you thank God for the answer for yet you should have right because that's what the Bible says in everything so in every prayer make your requests known to God but say thank you Lord I know you're gonna do it somehow or another you're gonna answer this prayer that's that's being content here that's that's being careful for enough I'm not gonna worry about nothing because I'm gonna pray for I'm just gonna leave thanking the Lord Lord you're gonna take care of it that's a real prayer how many want to pray those kind of prayers my hands up praise God I want to pray those kind of prayers I don't want to be careful for nothing and if you do that look at verse 7 if you and I can do that more and more the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus amen jesus said I'm leaving you my peace where's that church it's in prayer it's in prayer how many how many how many need that reminder from time to time your peace that he left you is in prayer and the prayer of thanksgiving Lord I'd ask you about this situation with my my mother or my mother-in-law or my father my father-in-law I've asked you about this situation with the church and actually about most financial need I'm actually about this temptation that keeps coming and I thank you that you're gonna answer it and the Bible says if you pray that the peace of God will take over your life amen you have so much peace you're gonna walk in the midst of a trial and have peace in your heart Amen what a blessing verse eight now verse 8 gives you eight different things you can focus on eight different things you can focus on finally brethren what summer things are true there's one so if you're going through a battle set your mind on what something that's true something that's true don't focus on on what you're wondering about don't focus on the question don't focus on the question focus on what you know is true how many can say amen to that you had we have to we have to set our minds after we pray set our mind on I know this is true I know this is true whatsoever things are honest right whatever things are just think about things that are fair and true what sort of things are pure think of the purest thing the cleanest thing in the word the cleanest thing in your life the cleanest experience you've had with God and to think of something that's clean and pure that's free from defilement think of that don't think of the person that's done evil to you don't think of the evil that that's so-and-so Center don't think of anything that's that's unpure think of something that's pure whatever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report and see so many times we think about the bad reports that people say oh this brother said this about me and that sister said that about me and we think about a bad report instead of the good report and the Bible says you have eight different options praise God you have eight different options one of them is think about a good report think about the good testimony that you heard praise the Lord don't focus on the negative brother man said you can go to every service and find something wrong and every service don't leave this service church no don't leave Sunday let's not leave a service remembering the wrong thing let's leave remembering the right thing I was talking to somebody the other recently and they went to a great service but I don't know what state they were in but all's they remembered was that the preacher didn't call for an altar call and they were all upset about that well you don't church let's just step back a minute I'm not trying to criticize but all the person left with was nothing in that our sermon all they left with was something negative and what if the Holy Spirit wasn't calling an altar call that night just like what if the Holy Spirit doesn't there's no one to be healed that night what if it's a night for something else do you see how we can meditate on the bad report can every see that and that's not going to bring us peace right that's gonna bring us fear that's gonna bring us a discouragement leave here with the good report Oh sister so-and-so saying a wonderful special oh I appreciate our brother singing another special oh I appreciate the pastor preaching the Word of God to us oh I'm so happy to see my brother gave him a big hug and haha Oh sister was there tonight you mutt we must leave we must leave the our house we must leave work focus on the good report if there be any virtue don't focus on things that SAP your energy focus on things that strengthen you I've got this story on my phone whenever I get discouraged and the Holy Spirit brings it to me Marie Mertz I go back and listen to that it's like a motivational it's like a spiritual motivation for me it just it just inspires me every time I hear it write something that strengthens you you see people that do workout the CrossFit you see those people I have friends on Facebook that do CrossFit what do they do to get a motivate in the morning I've ever seen so my friends oh you when I was in football what do they do as soon as they get up they set their alarm and it starts playing their favorite song right ever seen that when I was in football camp we used to get up at 4:30 church that was awful that was like prison I guess but the point was some guys in our dorm would have like their favorite rap song and so before 30 and embracing this rap song and pretty soon the guys are jumping around now that was like the first few days of camp after that everybody was tired if your body gets worn out but at least at the beginning they were trying to they're trying to use something that gave them strength and how many times have you turned on a good YouTube song or turn on your music and it's given you strength how many times have you done that the Bible said think on things that have virtue think on something meditate on something that's going to give you strength I've noticed it too I'm a teacher let me just share this real quick oh my god oh my time just went off okay give me one more minutes here here I'm a teacher and I love questions and answers I love questions and answers with the especially with the Bible not so much at school sometimes I can't answer those kids that's really hard question sometimes I'm like well I'm not a high school science teacher yeah Wow look it up but I love Bible questions because that's my main focus well sometimes I go on those believe the sign sites and all those things and God has shown me great things I share ones brother crying he's like my never seen that revelation and got to give me a revelation on where this believed the sign in video was all wrong is off the word but I find myself if I go on there too often I find myself weaker in the faith I find myself a little you know wondering I'm wondering about things and I've got to quickly go back and go back to something that's got virtue on it are you with me Church that is that help you out by God's grace I can I love to find what they're wrong I love to I love I love to find the truth and why they left you know I love to find that because I love to see what we're standing on that will strengthen you and I hey man I love to answer and I love for questions and answers brother branham I love questions and answers but I've got to make sure brother Jesse myself I think on things that give me strength not sap strength away from me focus on things that will strengthen you if there be any praise I can if I can praise the Lord for this all praise the Lord for this praise the Lord think on these things verse nine those things which you both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of peace shall be with you now for us look at the life of Paul we can learn from Paul we can look at the life of brother brand we can learn from that we can look at the life of each other those that are stronger than that strong in the faith look at their lives and the God of peace will be with you if you do the same things they do so the Bible gave you eight channels that you can that will bring you peace eight different things to think on lovely things right pure things things of good report things divert you eight different options aren't you glad God gives you eight options amen he's didn't say oh just listen to songs only or just go listen to your sermon or just listen read your Bible only he gives you eight options same ahead eight channels that if you think on these things you'll have the peace of God in your heart now look here's a man that knew God's peace sitting in a prison cell and he knew God's peace look at verse 10 but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again where and you were also careful but you lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned that whatever state I'm in therewith to be content I know both how to be abased or humbled I know how to be humbled and I know too how to bow nor how to be rejoicing and happy everywhere and in all things I'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need and then the famous verse verse 13 how many like this verse I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me that scripture is so misused I as a senior in high school I wrote that scripture Philippians 4:13 on my wristband when we go to football games and I'd say I can do all things through Christ like Christ really cares about who in the football game I was totally misusing that scripture I wanted to score touchdowns because I can do all things through Christ he don't care nothing about that souls are going to hell that's what he cares about amen saving souls sounds misusing that and in the context of this Paul saying I can be just as happy in prison as I can be as a free man why because the peace of God amen and if you know this story a poor froude itis that's a big name I was practicing early today FF Road itis had brought this offering from the church at Philippi he brought it to the prison where Paul was and then Paul so happy he writes this letter he says to the church at Philippi and graced me with you all these thing he writes them a letter and said thank you for the gift I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me when we feel I can't go another day brother Jesse or husband or wife I can't go another day this is so hard remember you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you look at verse 19 but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus so Paul just received the gift and he said I can do all things through Christ and he said I just received your gift you just gave to me you're a poor people you're poor Church you gave to me but believe me because you gave to me God will supply all of your needs as well so what were Paul's greatest lessons that he learned from God where did Paul learn that I can do all things through Christ that strengthened me was it when he raised the dead was it when he threw the serpent in the fire was it when he was on the ship and the a he met the angel on the bottom of the boat no it was in a prison Church in a prison that's where he learned his greatest lessons was in a prison that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me the state of our feet let not your heart be troubled how many will say that tonight I'm not gonna let my heart be troubled because I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I will not live a life of fear I'll not be scared of this person or this situation I won't be scared of tomorrow I won't be scared of next year I won't be scared of next month because I have learned to be content I have learned that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me how many love him tonight say Amen
