========================================

been better to me than I've been to myself as we can all probably say those things is for the Brooks Used to Say and uh we could have receipts here so we'll talk a little bit here you know the Lord's been so faithful and so kind to us and every day we should count our blessings for our freedoms you look at the the news and how Wars and riots and uprisings and civil Civil War things and everything is crumbling contact with the Pakistani and Pakistan and how the persecution's stepping up a little bit and he said he's keeping his congregation stay in the house because the Muslims are very rampant and they're obviously so it's and here we are yet and still peace and why God would allow us to live in such these dainties and these Finer Things and uh not worrying over our life constantly today could be our last to due to a martyrdom and maybe a persecution or however and we should thank the Lord for those things I was talking to a brother and he said he said you know the Bible said in the third seal that the voice of the throne says touch not the oil and the wine so the saints of God if you have the Holy Ghost within you and that Revelation keeps coming because Satan cannot touch you so we are believing in all things you know his promises are yea and amen he's uh he promised there would be a bride and not only just have a bride but that woman that wife of his would not see death And We believe We Believe those things so stay in prayer and just ask the Lord to guide you because remember when this thing starts and I'm talking like when it starts the finish the final move here remember the word Gentiles and God does not deal with us as a as a whole but he deals us with as us with individuals so we want to keep our lives right right so let's turn to the stand and turn to Exodus three I don't know if this is going to go or not but uh I'll see it though you can do this Exodus three just a little simple thought it was uh but just was so kind to give me a little room over there at the hotel and uh I don't know about you guys but I get tired I don't know just running things doing this and that run help this person do this he got jobs and work and and just the stress of this and you're sometimes your apprentices immune worries sometimes I A lot of times I give myself worries and uh so I was studying and nothing was really dropping and then so I took a little micro nap like which I mean some would call that a long nap I took like an hour and a half nap and I woke up and then it sure enough the little quotes I had pulled up before kind of one of them had something to do with Brother band was preaching an Akron a little service so I figured I went with that way so that was to me that was confirmation I was like oh there he is yes so I felt confident in where we're going this morning by God's grace so in Exodus 3 verse 1. is everything okay can you hear me okay all right all right so all right so Exodus 3 verse 1 and we'll read to verse 5. now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law and the pre-summitian and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to aurab and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked and behold the bush burnt with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned up and when the Lord saw that he that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and he said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hi hither he says put off those shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standeth is Holy Ground amen so let's turn to uh let's turn to Exodus 34 Verse 5. Exodus 34 Verse 5. a verse yep Exodus 34 5. and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation amen so say a word of Prayer foreign Lord Jesus Lord we love you we come before you humble Lord on this uh Resurrection Sunday Lord God this day Lord be honor Lord because of what you did Lord what you could accomplish what no one else could do Lord everyone died Lord very very few made it out alive Lord God but Lord you had and came your purpose was to come and die and we're not just that little but to rise again and prove and Lord Jesus Lord we certainly love and appreciate you Lord we ask a blessing Lord upon our pastor brother Justice Lord strengthen him and we went upon the the children Lord the the bride of Christ here Lord God your wife Lord as they stand Lord Reverend holding your precious word in her hand the sword there of the spirit Lord God lord The Holy Bible Lord Jesus and oh God your precious words Lord written on their lord and and Lord Jesus Lord be with us this morning our Lord may your spirit Lord covered hearts Lord answer questions Lord or whatever you have Lord we certainly love you bless the people in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have receipts sir amen okay oh gotcha I think I've used this here before and it worked but if not no problem this is no problem we can go with that one thank you amen amen Saints all's well this morning we are uh here and I said we'll be ready to go here by God's grace and uh this morning I'd like to teach on on a subject day patient God and with the sub topic of a patient bride so we think we thank the Lord for giving us Grace to be here and uh for some reason last night and even this morning I had a little I don't have this too much too often you know mostly here in gung-ho mode and you know we're brothers we're man and sisters we're women you know and with the grace of God by the hand of by the strength of the lord we can take on anything you know and that uncircumcised for those teams your head's coming off and you know how we you know how I was like this when your faith is strong and the anointing is there and uh your word and and just you feel the presence of God anything is possible there is no fear God did not give us the the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind right but last night I had this thought about uh and for some reason it came on to me hard about uh uh what if I have to die and and I wasn't even thinking Nestle martyrdom or whatever but just coming to that point in life where uh my heart would stop or something would take place and I would have to move on and and I had almost had like a little fear come up uh on me and I was like Wow and I'm like why is this why why am I why am I feeling this right now why is why is this affecting me and I could feel a little bit of fear and I'm thinking and I started trying to rehearse the scripture and I'm thinking after this after this death is nothing but a door death is nothing but uh uh just just another Gateway it's it we there is life after death right there is something Beyond this life there has to be right there I mean this can't be all of it this can't be you know uh you wake up in the morning and you brush your teeth and you go to work and uh if God gives you Grace you go out to eat for for lunch eat at Chipotle and whatever and you and then you go back to work you finish the day you come home you you eat again and you talk to your wife or husband and or your family or however this and that and and then you go to sleep and you do it again that's that's life I mean that's essentially how things go every day maybe not now they'll order however but the general routine is the Sim is similar it's it's it's just exactly the same the day before it's just a repetition right but but on this side you have a beginning and you have an ending you have a the the the the morning and the night and you have the rising the sun you have the setting of sun and there's always there's always that there but once we get on to the other side there is none of that it is joy unspeakable and full of Joyful forever more it is the Lord Jesus I'll say like this and as I had those thoughts and fear came up I thought but um we're doing this for eternal life for him for Jesus Christ and he gives us and Promises eternal life why wouldn't we go in boldly and and fearless and without doubt without those sort of things uh we have to we are born to do this and may God rise our faith up to move into this these sort of things amen amen so I just want to be transparent before you that I I battled that last night for whatever reason I haven't battled that in a long long time and for some reason that came upon me and uh and I just saying well nonetheless nonetheless I'm here nonetheless you were born and when you were born God gave you a The Gift of Life and he gave you something to do on this side for him and now we have to now if we have if we have I was like this when we got baptized what would that what was that supposed to represent a death to self when a brother came up to I'll say like this when it came up to a point where a brother had to die or this is Brother bam said he said brother are you scared to die he goes I died way back then right when I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what we gave our lives to him amen and he has been faithful ever since amen that's the truth see so so we've got to look back we've already died back there to him what so we could have her here one and walk with him for all eternity that is our goal that's our desire none of this matters I'll say it like this and if you've been able to keep the very first dollar he ever made and he'll be able to keep uh your wealth or your health can anyone just say I'm never getting sick from here on and never get it chances are you're going to get sick again you're going to get tired again well I don't need sleep well try that for about two days we found out how we find out how weak and how mortal we are how fragile I says how fragile life is so uh I guess the starting with this topic uh uh a patient God and a patient bride and I guess sister cases you have to hang with me here because I'm running some scriptures here I don't know if you're since this isn't kicking up I don't know if you want some scriptures for the saints of God or not or however in Psalms 33 and 20. uh it says our soul waiteth for the Lord he is our help and our shield now notice this is this is talking about what he's saying he's our soul awaiteth what did they are they are in constant anticipation it's a time of danger it's a time of of of of anxiety a time of stress in fact he says if they've if visas are awaited in other words they have done something Beyond just waiting they believed they had spoken to him they've called out to him and now they're on at that point where they're just waiting why because they need help they need protection right in Psalms 62 verse 1 and to the chief musician to death to uh judathon uh Psalm of David my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation saints of God here's David he he battled from the time he was born as a little boy Shepherd all the way to the time his very end his last dying breath he had to fight and fight and fight and overcome what and he was trusting the Lord Jesus what did he would deliver him in every battle and because I'll say this and he rehearsed to David rehearsed he says a lot of times before David would go into battle he says he says boys he says God's going to deliver us God's going to deliver us now sometimes God we've seen the scripture where God would speak to him and say you're go ahead and take it you will you will capture all things back right but other times it's not recorded if God said anything to him he just said well he says this man's going down and we're going to take this one he literally prophesied he spoke and ordered his own footsteps Why by because what he believed and knew he was anointed and what he was the he was the chosen King right and then what God was with him and that's where we have to believe this point in ourselves and our lives we have to know that God is with us amen does he heal your prayer or does he not does do you feel him uh at times here or times there when you speak something and you just believe does it take place amen that's where we're supposed to be right now a lot of times he says now here he says he says truly my soul weighth upon God and from him cometh my salvation David was waiting what for Christ to come on this right here this ground we stand on today and what perform when you had to perform what and that he would rise up and go in a Rapture with him absolutely and that took place what a thousand plus years or however after he died right sure but who knows the exact numbers I don't know but uh he was waiting what for that body change which is what true salvation why David was down in the paradise he was down there separated he could look over and see how those in Hell could come and see him but he wanted out of that place that was not his final resting spot amen he knew what that salvation was getting out of there amen sure sure now so here we see the people of God we see David he they always waited on the Lord in Psalms 130 verse 6. he says my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watched for the morning I say more than they that watch for the morning David was up before the morning he went to bed the Bible says sometimes he would be on his bed at midnight crying out weeping upon his bed trying to find favor with God trying to make contact one more with the Lord Jesus Christ and and here he says he's I'm waiting for the Lord more than any us like this for people waiting to wake up in the morning to go to work and this is he says I'm waiting on the Lord we're waiting for this Rapture we're waiting for this time well this thing will strike and we will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of I and that's where we're that's that's that's we're waiting for people like the people the in the karma people these people here however they're way they're doing their jobs every day they're waking up and just doing the routine just like we do but overall our main our main focus our main objective is we're what waiting on the Lord Jesus we're waiting for him and we believe him now uh Isaiah 64 verse 4. he says for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither hath the I seen or o God beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him well brother side the Rapture we've been preaching I remember it was a prophecy in this Delta Assembly of God and somebody spoke with tongues and someone interpreted and the interpretation was the angel of the Lord the trumpets coming upon his lips very very uh close right now and everybody in the church just went ah you know how it was back in uh in the old church but just when the the power of God would come down and people would run and shouting uh and and um all that where we saw that and uh but we we see here uh that we're waiting for him and they were excited back then in the early in the late 80s for what the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and yet it's been preached he's coming he's coming he's coming and what we are still waiting we have not given up we still believe what the word is saying amen amen now in Romans 8 verse 18. he says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us there are things Beyond this life Beyond this the greater things you get on and listen to some testimonies of people who went on on Beyond and then God's called back and they did not want to come back but the voice said you must come back I'm not finished you're not finished with your work on earth right you've heard those testimonies those sort of things but they never wanted to come back you see sister uh uh hope when he's when she's talking to brother Brandon and brother Bram calls her back he says she said Bill why did you call me back she had a brand new baby had a son and she did not want to come back to them children or to her husband because what's over there is far greater than the struggles of life than the Temptations of the earth and the Temptations of the devil those sort of things and the things we have to go through the struggle constant grinding we're just grinding and pushing and and at least just just doing our best to make it through this life absolutely that's the best we can everything is a struggle life is a struggle it is a fight he says for I reckon that uh that the sufferings of this present time are not worldly to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in Us Now That Glory that's to be revealed in US is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ there is coming a time where what his life his nature will be displayed and be fully manifest in you absolutely it's coming it's coming and we are we are what we as the bride are waiting for those things absolutely and we are being very very patient and what we're trying to watch our steps everybody trying to watch your steps as you walk through this world this world if you walk out just one step and it's sinful you your mind gets uh corrupted and polluted your eyes what you take in from what you see and what you hear it pollutes your entire being Mom and what we're still walking through it trying to do our best to keep what this Temple clean Amen to keep our our three-part uh person Body Soul and Spirit just as clean as we can now by the grace of God we don't have to keep our soul clean because once you receive the Holy Ghost the Bible says you are sealed until the day of your Redemption amen then God himself locks himself up in your being right there and you are God become one amen and that's when you become the bride right absolutely sure we believe those things yes now as we continue to move on here I want to uh there's I don't know so sometimes I get a little emotional sometimes I um see something and I say this if you keep if you allow the Lord keep your heart soft if your heart is soft and not hard if that that that Stony heart is gone and you have a heart of Flesh and you see things you know when it moves you sometimes it tears and let me read this these scriptures Romans 8 19. I don't know why I I mean I I love people are wonderful I love people but just something about nature it has almost the same effect if not more I say it like that just seeing the Fallen state of nature it says for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God they're waiting as well the Lions the giraffes the hippos the gazelle the Bears the squirrels the Chipmunks they're waiting on us for the creature was made subject to vanity not willing by reason of whom he hath sub hath subjected the same in Hope so as Adam and Eve fell as well because Satan used the animal kingdom use an animal to bring in the fall of Man God had to use what God God not only allowed Humanity to bring go into the fall but he allowed what animal the animal kingdom to go as far as that as well right they they die they have to suffer they they're not Eternal they don't have perfect bodies they're they are in a fallen State as well he says because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of gods sometimes I see uh something like a dog herding or a cat hurting or you catch a uh somebody sends you a video of of like something in the Safari and how this lion ate this hyena or killed us in my heart just starts inside I just start melting not long I long to see nature in harmony I cannot wait to see everything get along then you think about humanity and how they're just as vicious as animals there's this one in the same the same animal nature is within what Humanity why because it's a serpent race it's animal and it just breaks my heart to see it every time for we know that the whole creation groaneth and surveilleth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the fruits first fruits of the spirit saints of God if you have the Holy Ghost there should be something within you saying Lord God change this body get me out of here I am so tired of this thing acting and this thing's saying and this thing thinking the things that it does amen I want I want my new body I want freedom from what unbelief I want freedom in in what in the liberty of the Holy Ghost I want I'll say this I want to walk pure I want to walk holy amen yes what and that comes by what the new body that God's going to give you yes that glorified body that still can eat and rest in play and build and plants saints of God we're coming to something greater absolutely yes sir praise God well that's our that's that's something what he because remember the spirit of God does everything he what he's the one that reveals the deep and secret things he's the one that draws us to those sort of things and he's also the one we see here right here that he's calling us what to that new body Amen to that body change that we believe in he says even we ourselves grow within us ours waiting for the adoption to win the Redemption of our body amen bring it Lord Jesus praise God for we are saved by hope but what hope that is seen is not hope but what a man seeth why does he yet hope for but we hope for that which we see not then do we have patience then do we with patience wait for it we don't see it so what we're hoping and we wait in hope in patience amen we are waiting for these things absolutely sometimes I'm going to uh a lot of times when Emma would come over and well sometimes she didn't come over all the time but when she does come over he usually ends up talking about her mom or dad or Uncle so and so or Aunt so-and-so so guess what I do I go up you get my little picture albums out and I start looking at pictures and you just look and even me in my mid-40s you're looking how Jess looked I got a couple of sister Kristen when she was young and how they young and when they looked like they when they were cases age and Lydia Malachi's age and just there's just it was like fresh [Laughter] and new and no wrinkles no stress they're just like and they know they look good see I mean that's they they just because they're young but that youth and I'm just and you know I say Emma look at this picture looks picture but I'm thinking the entire time I'm thinking look what we're going back to this when we cross over young Malachi gets his probably have the same kind of body if the Lord Terry's a little bit longer as well you meet your dad on the other side you're gonna be like whoa dad you're young I'm like no this is who I always was this is me if our father never gets old then we should not never get old as well amen so we come back what to the original thought that what we are Eternal we can never more die again amen we get that new flesh that what the skin of a child the Bible talks about remember when he was baptized there yes the Flesh of a child absolutely it's weird it's strange age and time I'm understanding it more and more every day brother Jose you understand that with the silver Moses beard absolutely he says looking more like Moses every day amen so we have we went with patience we wait for it by God's grace in second Peter one and four wherefore are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and be besides this giving all diligence and your faith virtue into virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance into Temperance Temperance patience and into the patience godliness and God and his brother kindness and brother kindness to charity these are what they call the stature of perfect man these are Divine uh uh this is the divine nature now the prophet God said all these can be imitated you can see people who are very diligent this this but it's a carnal some some are very tempered and can handle a lot of stress and this and this but without the Holy Ghost is carnal right but when you have the Holy Ghost these these virtues are within you now notice that patience is in there and his brother Brandon would break this down in the Statue perfect man in one uh 10 14 and 62. patience he's talking about this Divine patience remember be a patient God and a patient bride and they're supposed to have the same Divine patience right patience he says patience with what what kind of patience he's dealing with that second Peter right there one he's talking about the statute proof man he's dealing with patience and what do you say first the first thing with patience is have patience with God something was string up in your life if something else I'll say this uh Brother Andy remember how he had that accident with his hand he can't play the guitar anymore he's now waiting he's waiting for God to restore that hand so he can play the guitar again does he get upset and say God I don't know he doesn't do that he's what having patience he's waiting on God if you have a sickness or an illness or something wrong in this or in that part of your life whatever it might be always we have to do is ask the Lord Jesus to do something in there to intervene and what have patience on him that's why he gave in the gifts of the Spirit healing and miracles one does not require patience the other one does you have to wait a lot of times for your healing amen but a miracle is like boom boom boom absolutely it just happens absolutely uh brother Jesse anointed whatever praise for somebody or or brother amen or brother Jose whoever they they pray over someone and they get healed instantly that is a miracle but if they do not get healed and we still believe we're waiting for a healing amen and a lot of times that healing will take some time absolutely he says first thing in this divine nature is have patience with God the Bible says you're going to make a rapture the prophet said in his message he said that when he comes you're going to be just like well I don't see it I'll be honest I don't see it right now like I want to see but I have to have patience with God he said that where he's going to put us through so much and he's going to build us and make us in such a way that when this thing strikes he's coming out and will be just like him explain it I don't know we're just going to see what he does when it comes to pass then we'll be able to explain it there it is this is that which was prophesied amen amen he says first thing is have patience of God if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience see that's why faith is the base of that that patience has to have faith to lean on to that's the foundation of that Faith he says When God says anything you believe it he said that's all you've got patience you say well I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just as sick in the morning oh my what patience what patience saints of God when you get sick and God doesn't heal you the rat that night keep waiting I've learned in my some 40 years or however that when you get hurt I'll say like this I just got my my tonsils out about a month ago and they and the nurse is like it's very very painful are you sure you want to do this and I'm like she's trying to scare me and the other nurse was like it's very very tough you're going to have a it's gonna it's a rough one and I'm like okay and I was going into that knowing that right but just like in any any time any time I get hurt on the job whether I I crush a thumb or cut this or cut that the next day it's going to get better and the next day it's going to get better and the next day it's going to be better and first the next thing you know you'll forget all about it because you know how it works you just have to give it some time you have to have what faith that God has given you a nice uh immune system and a healing uh healing and abilities within your body what God does the healing right the doctor can only set something or give you this medicine or this chemical or whatever but God does the healing amen yes so guess what I get these out I didn't take any pain pills it was just to me it was just a sore throat maybe you might have to drive a high pain tolerance I don't know but I wasn't I wasn't scared because I knew the next day it was gonna get better the next day it's going to get better the next day it's going to be better why because I was trusting in the Lord the next day the next day and now a month later I'm completely fine but I knew it was going to be that you just have to wait in every situation wait when I was Malachi and Lydia's age in high school thank God your home's gone when I was in high school there would be some a situation would take place in high school and you're under so many eyes you think when you're walking through that everybody's watching you in your mind in your mind everybody's watching you oh my goodness what do you think about this and you trip or something or somebody messes with you and embarrass you in front of everybody and you're like oh if I could only I don't want to come to school anymore because everybody's gonna laugh at me and at that at your age those things are huge I mean you're like what am I gonna do my life is over literally something like that small and you're in at that age in your mind my life is over I gotta run away from home and go to another school but as as you get older and the Lord puts you through more tests and more trials when something embarrassing or someone does this this you just keep on marching because you care less and less and less about what someone thinks about you I felt like my mom there wait a second yeah absolutely why because what we what you have to trust the process day after day and what God will encourage you and says don't worry about what you did in the past don't worry what happened to you yesterday or this person said just keep moving on amen that's a true face of God we're warriors we don't stop because this hits me or that hits you if this something bad takes place in your life it doesn't matter we're warriors we're soldiers in his army hey when I teach something up here and it's contrary to a mainstream message do you think I care I can only teach what God allows me to see and if I see something wrong you pray for me but I'll say it like this I can't teach anything I can't see or the way I see it I can't I can't affect that I can't change that this is how God has built me this is how God is about brother Jesse we can only teach and by the anointing about what's revealed to us the way they see it amen and we're all different he says well he says but God he said God believed now the reason I that's crazy I just said okay now God told Abraham 25 years later he said there wasn't signed he was still believing he had patience with God he said now the number of them said why he says he says the first part of that Divine patience is with God you know what the second one he says was dealing with that Divine patience that divine nature he says and we should have patience with one another too see one time we get so impatient with one another's we think we got to be like Moses Moses had patience with the people so there's a big shot Lydia just graduated all tough and super smart got a new job awesome building this Enterprise and this Enterprise she's got habilo patient on her sisters her little sisters who quite ain't there quite yet right and it's the same in the house of God from Malachi little Zion comes up to brother man okay big brother hate can you teach me how to play the piano oh and Malachi's going and Zion's just like think [Laughter] ing Malachi has to have patience with his little brother he can't just store offices he's too young I can't help there are virtuosos who are four and five years old who can play that piano probably as good as brother Malachi right but the same in the spiritual within ourselves if you see me lacking where you are strong patience with me amen and we the same we are I'll say like this I'm going to say this because I saw it in the natural brother Jess could you come up here real quick president Jesse what year were you born 1980. you know when I was born 1977. three years older and when I was growing up Jesse was like this like this and like this and then around junior high or High School freshman eighth grade Jesse for the Jesse caught up with me and was tall as I was and then I'm going to try and get my senior year and uh some of us grow a little more than others and grow faster some slower remember a dollar can't be a penny and a penny can't be a dollar okay that's why you have to have patience with one another but Jesse God bless you thank you yeah thanks for God two claps [Applause] you've got to have patience with God and one another well if this sister would just get the Holy Ghost she'd be able to see it my way or this brother saints of God wait we're a family we are a body just like he says here he says Moses had patience with the people they complained and bellyached after Miracle after Miracle after Vindication after Vindication and God what showed them continually that Moses was the one whether he was the he was the microphone he was the one to listen to and God was going to speak to him and him alone and the people complained and complained and complained and Moses stood in that gap for 40 years millions of people and he stood in the gap look that's what caused them not to go over see if you're trying to do something so that patience that Divine patience you'll have patience with God and your brother and sister can't they can't see the Deep things maybe they're just slow growing I will say this I will say this that when we see someone come into the word of God like such I've seen them grow so fast in Revelation and understanding and and be able to grasp the deeper things of God within a year or two just like that after they get baptized they start hearing that coming to church listening to the word of God and they grew rapidly many times they go Way Beyond me and understanding and types and shadows those sort of things amen right absolutely now he says like I've tried he says to get this message over he says now notice he says and we should have patience with one another too see one time we can get someone patient with one of the others and the prophet goes on he says like I've tried to get this message over to the Tabernacle he's to to see that each member of the Tabernacle become this he's preaching what to his own church he says I'm trying to get them what to the stature of Christ to get them to this measure right he said he said uh he said it's hard to do I've tried to have patience this is 33 years see Malachi 4 still could not get his church in line with this though he had this though he had this you're dealing this this the two signs you cannot get them to submit down to that he says have patience women still Bob their hair just the same just have but just have patience see just have patience wait have to it ain't got to if you ain't got it don't try to build on on this down here just have patience no matter what you're seeing let's say like there's something in the I don't know any problems here if there's if there is any but if there's a problem here just wait on it just wait on God God will fix everything because remember at the end he said he would he said he would restore all things so right now what we see look beyond that and see the Unseen amen see that brother and sister perfect see that brother uh just living as clean as he ever could that sister clean and this this see it all as a finished work amen as Christ sees you when you when you sin and mess up or have this thought to do that why doesn't God strike you dead because what you are under the blood of Christ and he only sees himself he sees you perfect already from the foundations of the world and if we could catch the same eyes not even the mind but let these eyes be in you which was in Christ that he sees each one of you as pure and holy amen yes and you someone says well brother listen just giving them excuse oh it's okay he'll come through it or she'll come through it all is well amen right yes yes yes yes now in Exodus 3 and 1. how he started there now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law uh the priest Dominion he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel Lord appeared in him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked and behold the Bush was burned of fire and the Bush was not consumed so here what takes place Moses sees a sign he sees a sight he sees something he's never seen before Supernatural and it was so Supernatural he looks at it and the Bible says what that he turned he says now I turn aside and see this great sight now notice God was waiting for that he says in the Lord he says and when the Lord saw thee he turned aside the sea see God was waiting to see if this sign and God knows how to appear to you and I he knows how to speak to you and I he knows how to move us he knows how to turn us amen it literally took I'll tell you after 40 years in the desert raising sheep it took God to come down it is a ball of fire and sit in the bush and just burn that's what that's what it took to catch Moses attention at the time amen something that big that's substantial why because something that big and that substantial is about ready to take place amen so the great God came down and now he saw a sign and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called out unto him in the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I so notice after this sign he's he actually he he turns aside and looks at it and now God speaks and the prophet of God would teach many times he says with every sign there is a voice with every Supernatural Southern you see there's always a voice a lot of times it goes with it so what must we check is the sign an absolute or should the voice be the absolute you check the voice because remember when God when Moses heard we saw he saw this light come down in this bush that voice said behold Moses he says he says aye what do you saying he says Moses Moses he said here am I he called out to him he knew his name I'll say it like that how did this bush how'd that voice or whatever was in this bush know the name of Moses sure he said here am I he's a draw not hither and if you look down Beyond it was a scriptural voice because God said he says I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he says and I have come down to deliver my people right and that was prophesied up 400 plus years beyond that and take them into the promised land which was promised to Abraham Isaac and Jacob right so notice every every sign will have a voice or the majority time there's a sign there's a voice and you've got to check that voice by the word amen by the scripture then not those in Matthew 7 says Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and cast out tongues in thy name and cast out demons in a name and done many wonderful Works in thy name right but what we must see though those were signs and wonders we must see what was being taught amen the voice behind those signs what was the voice and God discerned The Voice he said your workers of iniquity right absolutely sure now let's continue on here and if you look at this dealing with these what God was doing right there when it comes down to the whole story Moses was told he says I've come down and I need you to go into Egypt and deliver my people and Moses made all these excuses he says well I can't talk and I'm not smart and I'm old and this and that and God said and God actually got angry with him he says who's doing this me or you who's in this voice right here me or you can set them who's on fire and who's not right now notice in Exodus 4-1 and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken into my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee so here is a prophet who gets a sign with a voice and is scriptural so the prophet said this is thus saith the Lord and then now he's called to go to the people he's supposed to deal with God says he says he says there Moses said they're not going to listen to me and God says he says what is in their hand and he said oh rod and he said cast it upon the ground and he casted upon the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and Moses said unto the in the Lord's unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and became a rod in his hand that they may believe the Lord God of their fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob hath appeared unto thee right so notice there was a sign give or there's a sign given and it was a supernatural sign as well right and let me jump let me hit this real quick if you look at second Timothy now we know the story right Moses actually did go down to pharaoh and he and Moses said you got to let my people go we've got to let God's people go we've got to go worship we've got to we're taking them out of here and Pharaoh says no he says so Moses does exactly what the Lord says he takes his Rod drops it on the ground and it becomes a snake and Moses and the Pharaoh is looking at this and he's saying he calls his wise men out right his magicians and they performed the very same thing right and what remember children remember what takes place that Rod of Moses came and swallowed up the other two snakes right now how many magicians were there according to scripture there was two of them Janice and jambres he says now as Janice and jambers with student Moses so did these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith right now notice if you think about this I'll say like this if you think about that that was a sign right this one rod would turn into a snake and the other odds of The Magicians would turn to snakes and that one snake would swallow up two what does Scripture say would be swallowed up death would be swallowed up in Victory but how many deaths are there two deaths the first death and the second death showing what that this natural life right here there would be some that would Escape it because the scripture says he says for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so in this corrupt that will have put on immoral and Corruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory saints of God when you have received the Holy Ghost and you make this Rapture you bypass the first snake and you bypass that second Snake once you receive the Holy Ghost you are no longer in danger what of going to the second death which is the Lake of Fire right absolutely notice this power is it's exactly scriptural sure now think on this um uh now the second sign let's see here and the second sign he said he says put now forth in thine hand thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it behold his his hand it was leprous as snow what does that leprosy represent sin right he says he says and leprosis it was leprous as snow and he put forth I and he said put forth I hand again into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his wisdom behold of the turn again as his other flesh these two signs are prophecy right these are absolutely prophecy what is this who was in the prophet of God said who was that hand he said that was Jesus Christ because he was the right hand of God the power what an authority of God right so what Jesus came and he was what he came and went and went and went to the bosom came out of the bosom became sin and then when he went back to the bosom and was revealed that he was no longer sin right we know those things right so those two signs were given to Moses now and that's exactly what the prophet said he says but the other two had voices of Prophecy okay let's see if I can find that scripture I got here somewhere yeah there's so John 1 and 17. he says for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ but no man has seen the father at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him so the sun came out of the bosom and then had what come back in sure now he says right here he says and it came to pass and it shall come to pass Jesus God said that if they will not believe thee nor hearken he says to the voice of the first sign that they will that that they will believe the voice of the latter sign uh so here each one of these signs was given a voice and the prophet said this he says now watch he said he said uh man where did that go oh that's I just read it sorry he said but the other two voices he's talking about the third he said the other two voices were prophetic so when Moses went and did this hand in front of the Pharaoh when he did this hand in front of the the his his brothers and sisters the Israelis uh the Jews and when he did the snake and all those sort of things there was nothing said but these voices were the voices of the prophecy that they were prophetic they actually these signs were signs that would come with a voice and these voice the voices was Jesus Christ right absolutely sorry now let's continue on here and then the third thing that would come to pass if they did not believe the voice the two voice the two signs he says it shall come to pass if they believe not also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt tank of the water of the rivers and pour upon dry land he says and the water which thou take us out of the river shall become blood upon dry land so to reject the first pull to reject the second pull there was literally nothing else left but judgment and the prophet said he said this was judgment when it comes down to blood now water their life Source what the user the plants uh to to irrigate to their plants to feed their sheep to feed their oxen their their cattle when he takes that Life Source away in terms of the blood he says there's nothing left but judgment right he says now watch that third sign he give them was not related to his occupation neither was it related to his person his third sign notice the other two signs are related to him himself his occupation but they were the only two signs the Bible said had a voice right the other sign didn't have a voice but the two signs that was given was from his own person to his people and had voices but the third sign now notice it was given the sign the third sign was the sign of death so saints of God it's as as we had Malachi 4 come and he was given those two signs as well as they rejected those things I'll say like this they accepted the signs but they rejected the voice of the sign the prophet not only had two sons but he had a voice and they loved him when he did this when he had the healing when he had the sermon they loved him but when he started bringing the voice of God and the word back when they rejected that there's nothing left but death right absolutely now and as this as he would drop the first judgment and we know there was ten judgments right and it went on and on from from lice to to frogs and to uh light and darkness and then to uh death of the firstborn and God did all that but what was the trigger what was what triggered all of this what triggered all of this and then when they when Pharaoh finally did let him go they went into the Wilderness and they came to the Red Sea and God parted the Red Sea and God did another miracle for the Israel but what triggered it this is literally a type of the third pole of what's coming he said brother Brown said he says he says once this bride is able to come into into Perfection the way they're supposed to and coming to speaking conditions what they'll be able to open and shut those heavens and earth they'll be able to they'll be able to do control nature and do all these things and and as the Lord would lead them right but what was the trigger what started this whole thing in Exodus 3 7. in Exodus 3 7. and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians do you see yourself here do you see what we're gonna have to do to get out of here what was Revelations 10 God comes down what is what is the voice out Trump God descending to come to get his bride what what kind of position or situation are we going to be in to fulfill this prophecy I am come down to deliver on the hand of the Egyptians verse 9. now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel's come upon me now God had everything in set he was set in stone the prophet was waiting the prophet was already born he tried to do it himself and he went off the scene but God had him holding place in the desert God was waiting on Israel to be tired of where they're at the entire move the entire judgment all the signs all the Miracles everything that took place after this was waiting on them when they were ready to make the move when we're I'll say this when we are ready for this rapture it'll happen when we cry out for the body when we are waiting if they're waiting we are he who's we have to be patient with God and God has been patient with us he is waiting for us to get tired of this life Enoch he said I'm just sick of this I'm just going home today I'm just when he's what the Bob the Bible said he just went on and walked with God and walked right up to Glory he got just tired of his everyday life notice Psalms 50. Psalms 50. verse 14. everything is set up ready to go the big machinery that God has everything is ready setting waiting it's been fueled up it's been lubed up everything is right there Psalms 50 14 offer unto God Thanksgiving and pay thy vows upon the most unto the most high and call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me there it is what is the what is the day of the Lord the day of the Lord is not a a good thing it's either Darkness nor lion it's a day of just it's day of judgment right look at this Psalms 18. verse 1. he says to the chief musician the psalm of David the the servant of the Lord who spake unto the Lord the words of the song and the day of the Lord delivered him from the hand of his all of his enemies and the Hand of Saul and he said I he says I love thee O Lord my strength the Lord is my rock and my Fortress my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my buckler the Horn of my salvation and my high tower I will call upon the Lord now remember when did when did Davis write David sing the song or write the song it was directly after he took what the last battle with the Philistines those last four giants to fall David got weak and one of job's job's Brothers came and saved him and and said he said we can't you've got to stay home now why because you're the light of Israel you've got to stay home right he says and David said God you deliver him one time you need the inspiration of the Holy Ghost hit him and he started Penning he says God has delivery from what all my enemies from Saul which is a denominational organizational Spirit he delivered me from all this and all he had to do was what call upon the Lord now notice what kind of situation was David in the Sorrows of death Compass me there it is the sorrow's death he saw it coming David out of breath he probably just killed someone he's out of breath holding a sword like this just trying to get he was older he was trying to get some air and one of the Giants from across the field saw him he'd probably just slew the Israelite and he said this is the opportunity he's running towards the king and Dave is like here he comes what death was coming but one of his brothers amen a mighty warrior a gentile Warriors came in and slew the Giant and saved him amen that's exactly right that's the kind of inspiration where death is right there right there you're about ready to be expired put down in pain and suffering and what someone steps in and saves you and he gives does he give that brother any Glory he gives it to God I'll say it like that he never meant once mentioned this brother that saved him he gave all the glory to Jesus Christ because God knew that the Lord David knew that God had to anoint this brother and saw that giant coming he uh he's a hell or whoever saw saw the whole scene he might have just slew someone too took a little break saw David hurt and this guy seated him and he's like run into intercede amen saints of God that's a perfect thing for prayer right there if you see your brother and your sister down and out or going through something get on your knees and pray him through amen do something for him to encourage him amen and what God will stop what you will stop that death from hitting them amen that's why we pray for our brothers and sisters he said now notice he says the Sorrows of Hell come it's about me the snares of death prevented me he says in my distressed I called upon the Lord see what took place the Giants running David's here breathing he said Lord Jesus help me god Jehovah deliver me he called from what and he knew that what God was with him and he cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his Temple notice he knew that he was not his own he knew what he was here to serve God Amen as we are too once you receive the Holy Ghost once you have the spirit the indwelling spirit of God you become the literal temple of God oh how we ought to behave ourselves how we ought to watch what we see uh taken with our eyes taken with our ears and speak with our mouth amen sure yes he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even unto his ears now why does this why am I reading this because this is this is literally the type of the Rapture right here this is your rapture now notice as David is he's bringing these things he's saying how he's delivered and this and that if you look what happened in his distress he says I called into the Lord and Cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and my Craig Cry came before him even into his ears and the Earth Shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills were moved and were shaken because he was Roth there went up smoke out of his mouth nostrils and fire on his mouth devoured the coals were kindled he bowed the heavens also and came down this is the situation the bride's going to be in it's going to be a battle it's going to be very close to death that's exactly right he cuts he catches us right before what the Great Tribulation starts in the persecution those things are striking the Earth right and what God can comes down and delivers him in verse 13 the Lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice see right there's your thunders at the same time and now notice in verse 16 he says he sent from above he he took me and Drew me out of many Waters there's your rapture right there but what was God waiting for this entire time he's waiting for David to cry out and say Lord help Lord deliver me yes amen now look here so God is waiting for us there's a there there's there's we see things being set up in this rapid so rapid what if in Target they would have set up those things back 30 years ago with those shirts and that filth like that that perversion the miracle would have what insane it's been so much uh backlash on that but now it seems like it's just growing you can't stop I've heard even Chick-fil-A's into this now saints of God it's coming all that will not take the mark of the beast or go into the system will be killed this thing is rapidly approaching now notice in verse in James 5 and 7 be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waited he's waiting on on us and we're waiting for him notice he waited for the precious fruit of the earth and had long patience for it until he received the early and the latter rain be ye also patient so notice God's being patient and you must be patient as well establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh here's when two omnipotent patients meet something must take place say to God and we are waiting on the Lord but Saints he is waiting on us saints of God if there's a time to cry and call out for desperation it's right now right now and never since since I've been alive and probably you've been alive have they been saying the economy this thing's going to be bad it's coming it's coming I don't know have you has anyone ever studied the Great Depression you have were they saying before months and years before that there's a Great Depression coming took them as a snare they took them as a snare and people lost everything their Banks did it bail in instead of a bail out and they lost all their money people suicide and going insane and average dirt poor and there was no warning we are getting warning after warning they're blasting it on their headlines they're saying this now this this bubble is going to burst this bubble is going to burst this bubble is going to burst saints of God there God is trying to speak to us what if brother Brown was here right now what would he what would he preach sing the Highland headlines for the grandpa from the headlines all the time you hear in science they just did this and watch the politics is corrupted what would he be saying right now he said we better pray amen right now notice what the prophet God said here he says oh that we need today is a calling together a great a getting ready and not depending on the preacher but you as an individual before God making yourself ready for the coming of the Lord to escape all this corruption no matter what they call you or what action they take that doesn't change God one bit he says God will do it just the same he's depending and waiting on us oh my he's waiting on us some people say well I go to church on Sunday morning I listen to our pastor that's a which is a fine preacher that's good and I appreciate that he says and you are an America of the world whoever it is but it takes more than a good than a good message from the pulpit it takes your life it takes you to get ready he's literally waiting for us to get ready so brother Randy was texting me and he's just a Revelator and he was saying he said he said brother side you ever notice how when they when the world like has something like demonic or they have the devil they always put fire around it like you always see Flames or this or that you know dealing with he said and yet the Bible says in Revelations 3 he said God said I'd rather you have be hot or cold on fire or freezing and not live warm literally they're they're saying the devil's got the fire when he doesn't the devil is literally the coldest being on the face that ever was if the bride of Christ is supposed to be fired up I'm saying the fire the who is fire the fire is Jesus Christ he is a what a consuming fire he's the one that one can set a man and send them a blaze absolutely that's the one the brother said he says you light one man on fire and they'll come from a from miles and miles to watch The Man live to watch the man preach the watch the man uh act however what and that's what catches that's what that's what stopped Moses was what the pillar of fire right there Satan's the most coldest being there ever was hates everything evil I was like that's that's really good anybody now he says in Revelations 19 verse 7 he said the Bible said speaking of the bride of Christ she hath made herself ready she hath made herself ready and you as a member of this bride you've got to make yourself ready 1958 he said that was a historical God that gave this promise and we're the people today of his pasture we're the Sheep of his fold and he's waiting on us to stand and call him on the action 1958. he's waiting for us to really stand saints of God I'll say like this what is what is God requiring here because I'm in I I was sitting in the in the the the the the the Job trailer with a bunch of guys 10 guys and you know how that is and you know what I did I just was quiet Sat by myself to say my my my lunch or break you know yogurt whatever just I'm ignoring it or should I be in there tearing that place up what we'll call the God on the scene I wonder see I'm trying to examine myself because Lord is this how I'm supposed to be or am I supposed to be so on fire not trying to separate from the world but now we're saints of God we're supposed to be pleading for lost souls these people are going to go to hell they're going to miss the Rapture they're going to go into Great Tribulation should not I be like gosh quit talking like this watch your borrows let's talk about God or get out what should I be doing and then you know what's going there's going to be backlash on that people are not going to like that very much they're not going to be pleased with my actions and what at that time I'm gonna have to say well you're the Lord's gonna have to judge between me and you is that what he's looking for what was the message of John the Baptist he come out of the Wilderness repent for the kingdom of God is at hand repent he says repent for the king and as John the Baptist was taken to prison who took up that same message Jesus did he said repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he mentioned and the first word was repent and as he would send his disciples and John six or seven five however he's told us two disciples he sent him two by two he says he told them what is your message he said preach repent for the kingdom of God is ahead the Kingdom of Heaven is hand he's waiting us to stand and make and call him on the action call him on the scene watch him go into movements watch him do the Supreme watch them do the thing that God will that man will wander and scratch their heads and not understand it he wants someone to stand there and say no the Lord wants this and see what God does and watch God back him he says and not understanding he's a he's a historical God in a present day God he's waiting to be called out of History I'll say it like this there's been a couple times that's happened one time I was backpacking in New Hampshire and I met a through hiker his name was Bootlegger you live names Bootlegger so me and him went to this Barn and we're up there because we rented a little cot to sleep and open this Barn and I told him I said I can't remember his name it's called boolier it's a bootlegger and I started bringing down serpent seed and showing how this and this and this and he's just like whoa that's wild because he was Catholic I said Kane was this and Abel was this and settled this and how they mingled and this and that and I said why do I said I said why do you think they can't find the missing link and when I said that he goes hold on I gotta go to the bathroom she walks downstairs in the barn goes to the bathroom and there was other through hikers watching a science documentary down there and he comes back up he goes Simon you're gonna believe this the guy down there does she said he says we can't find the missing link laughs he goes why'd it happen I said it was for you to prove that this was true and what he was scratching his head that night something like that but what did it take I had to open my mouth and say something bring some correction try to bring some enlightening to the man amen and then here God comes down and vindicates it just below sure yes amen now let's let's stand here by God's grace just a little cut up study here by God's grace but we are trying to see the where we're what we're supposed to do what he's what's what's going to happen next you say well brother Brandon you say let's let us that's what God's waiting on we're waiting on Jesus to return and Jesus is waiting on us you say well how can we do what can we do about it the Bible said the hour has come in his and his bride has made herself ready Hallelujah he just made herself ready we've got to start crying out Lord if this is the time please come Deliver us because we see the hand of death death is all around us if there's ever been a time where the darkness is dark it's right now when you walk past people I was like this when you walk past people that have this situation going on you feel like in you feel uncomfortable you feel the darkness from it you go get a coffee at a certain place and you look at these people and you're like speechless you're like a deer in the headlights you can't believe what you're you literally can't believe it and in your mind you're running what is wrong how would it I think think the Lord Jesus Christ did I know who I am and what what I'm supposed to do and why I know the truth saints of God we are we're literally at that point of Darkness where it's a day of Noah Dave we are right there help us to make ourselves ready Lord amen all's well I know it's kind of cut up but saints of God he is waiting off and he's going to why do you think the squeeze has to happen why do you think there's a persecution coming because he he has to literally Force us and cry out and say Lord come Deliver Us for those who prayed this morning in the last whole week has anyone prayed Lord Deliver Us from come get us in this rapture anyone pray that Mr Kristen has all right see but we that should be every prayer Lord Deliver Us get us ready Lord show us the way out Lord God give us this rapturing Faith give us this Rapture in Grace amen amen
