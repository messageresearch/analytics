wonderful i'd like to if we can uh go to philippians chapter two i kind of been feeling led to get back to this here so flipping chapter two wonderful songs by the email philippians chapter 2. i want to um emphasize a few scriptures i've kind of already gone over but let's uh let's do verse five here i'd like to just spend a few minutes on uh verse six here in a couple moments by god's grace thank you okay yeah thank you let's just read verse five and six let's read five and six together on three one two three let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto god here heavenly fathers we bow our heads lord god we're humbling ourselves in your divine presence lord and you promised if we gather lord god in your name and we ask anything in your name you'd grant it to us so we're taking out your word tonight lord god we're asking you lord god to speak to us to strengthen us heal us lord guide us direct us correct us lord and just show us your love lord god show us more of your grace and and lord as we fall more in

these things to our hearts we truly need you i need you lord god and i just pray god you minister to every hungry heart in jesus christ's name and the church said amen god bless you being seated praise god okay so i want to spend a few minutes looking at a couple scriptures here uh there's a one thing i want to look up here i'd look at this up real quick i just want to get a greek okay great greek definition real quick all right so let's um look at verse five here i'm kind of heading back to five now i'm not gonna rehearse of course all chapter one uh but as we were looking this we saw how this book and this letter was written for the minds of the saints right to get in one accord uh to get in like-mindedness now remember they already had the baptism of the holy ghost paul was there for a short time people got saved born again the philippian jailer was saved god shook the whole earth i'm sorry god took the whole prison house and uh and then god cast devils out of uh women and and then god raised up lydia there in the church and they were they were a really holy ghost church praise god uh but they were born again and but yet 11 years later paul's you know letting them know the desire of the holy spirit is for everybody to be in one accord amen like-mindedness right as we saw from our visual this morning we need to have our minds constantly uh filled with god's word amen constantly if not we'll backslide away from the things of god we'll build up complexes in our lives and like with brother branham it almost got him out of position and that's why we'll see people that are born again in the message even and they'll actually go too far right they'll they'll they'll disobey the the gentle reminders of the lord the warnings of the lord and they'll actually get out of position at times that's true it does happen uh you see a in certain lives and people's situations where like for example a minister might stop preaching because of his own sin because of his own complexes right that's a very easy one to see you know where you might see like a person have mental trouble they call it mental health today but really it's just a mind that needs transformed they give it they give it the title mental health but really they just need a refilling of the holy spirit in their mind right it's all this mental health well i know how to get well in your mind fill your mind with god's word and confess all the sins so those demons have to leave amen that's that's how we deal with mental health of this church amen now don't get wrong counseling is good right yeah we all need counseling we have we all need to you know share our hearts and thoughts but really the problem is demons have camped out and set up fortresses in people's mind and they fail to confess them that's mental health that's that's the problem people have but i want to um remind us again paul said if there's any joy in christ i'm sorry if there's any comfort or consolation fulfill my joy that we be like-minded that's what i can see i can see it in all of our lives like we come to church to hear god's word we come to church because we're all thinking about the rapture amen right so i know in our church i feel like we're fulfilling this scripture people are like-minded you see more people coming to the evening service right most the time most the time now people get plans they get tired they get sick we understand that they get pregnant you know but the idea is when everybody's mind's in one accord it's all on christ right and then jesus can he can guide us he can help us to grow right he can he can unite us praise god so we can feel closer to him and closer to one another amen that's what he's trying to do he's trying to remember this is uniting time right remember brother ram said the fulfillment is right now he said that the fulfillment is the tears are binding in other words the tears are being united right that's that's what's that's fulfilled right now the tares are being bound they're bound first right but then the wheat is gathered out praise god and then the tares are burned later so see it's so it's it's it's their uniting time and it's our time to lay the prince of the sun waiting for that great uh the great harvester coming through praise god amen with this great rapture sickle to cut us out amen and take us to the heavens to meet up christ in the air amen but see the they're picking out the terrors you know they're binding them together right now but the wheat is maturing i'm so glad to mature in christ amen thank you lord and that's what's happening we're we're in one accord we're in one mind like i was telling sister who on wednesday night i was saying sister i look forward to seeing you on saturday and because i was thinking about on saturday but but she looked at me she said yeah but sunday i can't wait to see on sunday remember that i thought that's awesome like she's already thinking her mind is already on the service amen i thought that was a good testimony since i thought i kind of felt a little rebuked like oh help me lord that was great that's great that's what we want we all want to be thinking about oh the word of the lord amen the music of the lord the worship of the lord getting refreshed in his presence amen overcoming fear overcoming doubt and unbelief and being strengthened is in his presence praise god it's a one it's a unified spirit amongst the church praise god now i want to look at verse 5 let this mind mean you which was also in christ jesus now i found a good uh greek definition that's why i want to look look this up here real quick okay that's it all right now who being in the form of god now we know that's the word morphe right so he christ was in the form of god he thought it not robbery to be equal with god okay but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men now here's the great understanding i think that i felt like well i believe it's right now robbery has two connotations this author says it could mean to grasp because of jesus deity it probably means to clutch or to hang on to at all costs so when we read it he thought it not robbery in other words jesus did not selfishly cling to equality with god but gave up his privileges to become human i thought that was great because let's go back a little bit he was the logos right he was the light that came out of the invisible god amen but he thought it not robbery let me read that again he did not just cling to his equality with god he humbled himself and the bible said he made himself of no reputation humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross saints that light couldn't die amen how do you believe that amen the logos light couldn't die so he had to think it not robbery now this is a different we think rob like robbing a store but that's not what it means uh it means to clutch on to or grasp in other words jesus didn't grasp on to his equality with god as far as he took upon him flesh and so he had two parts to him brother brahm said he had divinity full holy ghost god deity supreme deity but he also took on humanity amen and that's what it means he didn't just hang on to the divinity he took upon humanity now that helps out a lot right that helps a lot because he he could have stayed and just play all deity all deity but he come down and he hid himself behind a man right hit himself behind a man and that's i thought that was such an important uh understanding because here's the here's the here's the reason i'm saying this is because and amen i don't know if you know this but i want to share this a few years ago brother cam i remember there was a little bit of a split at brother cam's church well one of the reasons why because one of the preachers who left took this text and he said see if we have the mind of christ then it's not robbery that we're equal with god and he said see you are equal with god and then he took it this far to say uh you're equal with god he said not only did god write the lamb's book of life he said the bride wrote the lamb's book of life he said you wrote the book of life and i got the sermon i still have the sermon on audio if you want to hear it and that you know and it it shook it shook up most of the people in the church now the the people that that uh the people that didn't uh i'm sorry the people that didn't accept it they stay with their camp but the people that agree with it most of them left and start another church now see how this see how this definition would totally do away with that it's not saying like uh it's not saying we are equal with god it's saying jesus chose not to just hold on to divinity he actually humbled that holy spirit humbled itself and came and lived down in a a body that could die it doesn't mean uh it doesn't mean robbery like we would say okay because yes we want the mind of christ how many with the mind of christ amen aren't you glad you got it praise god we need it every day we need more of the mind of christ right because satan's trials get harder but god raised up a standard harder harder and harder praise god all the way down to the end but see that's what happened he he made it he humbled himself so the all divine all divine one the son of god the logos he didn't he didn't hang on to all divinity he actually put on a part of humanity and humbled himself and came down so i hope that was a helpful thing by god's grace i just want to share that and that caused a big uh well there it calls the big church split and uh brother amen i even went and talked with the gentleman i sat down and i i sat with him uh we went to i think a wendy's or mcdonald's or something like that and i tried to talk him out of it and he wouldn't all he would admit was that uh perhaps i wouldn't preach it the same next time and i said brother you need to go and apologize to brother cam and so far to this day he hasn't uh and so you know taking those things church into account you know to me that's very close to that's very close to like almost uh blasphemy almost like where we say we're equal with god brother graham said the bible says jesus had the holy ghost without measure we have it with measure and so see how just see how just uh one little misunderstanding of the word can cause such confusion division uh and we might even say critical maybe a critical spirit now i'm just sharing that so you can see that that this scripture has been misunderstood many many times he was in the form of the logos but he thought not robbery to be equal he didn't hang on to that equality he actually took on humanity and he humbled himself and died right the bible said he was obedient unto death and because he did that god exalted him with the name above every name praise god hallelujah church if we can humble ourselves god will exalt us amen in due season praise the lord now we are not equal with god we have a portion of god but we are not equal with god with full the full eternal amount and as i said last week jeffersonville is saying brother branham was just like jesus in every way except the corporal body now that's that's almost blasphemy i would say uh it's such an awful thing to say uh if you have your bible uh keep your spot i'm gonna keep my spot but go to romans three just for a simple thing and on the same video i have it i shared it with brother jose this week um they're saying that uh every word's infallible they're saying every word of brother is infallible it's just impossible so let's just look at just a few scriptures here i just want to go to romans 3. and now i'm bringing this out because again the scripture talks about jesus thought it not robbery to be equal with god but that doesn't apply to us praise god where were you before you were here you were in the mind of god brother ram said you didn't have a soul you don't believe in pre-existence of souls you weren't like wandering or floating around in heaven no you were in the mind of god right and god wanted to have fellowship with you and when it came time you know he spoke the word and and sent your soul right from his thoughts and he sent his soul down when you got you were born you cried out and the soul entered into your body praise god that's how god does it now let me say this you do have a theophany in heaven praise god you know the bible says you have eternal bodies waiting in the heavenlies praise god but brother man said we didn't we weren't there we we we were thinking before we were here we weren't existing but there's a body waiting for us the bible says that there's a house waiting for us eternal in the heavens amen and paul said be sure that you'd be not found naked in other words don't be without a a theophany in other words live for jesus except jesus and there will be a theophany waiting for you praise god there'll be a home ready to receive you romans 3 praise god now i want to just read it here yes verse 12. well let's just read 10. as it is written there is none that righteous no not one there's none that understand that there's none that seeketh after god now can the bible be any more plain church there's none righteous there's none that seeketh after god they're all gone out of the way they're all become i'm sure they're all together become unprofitable there's none that do with good no not one praise god i know there'll be no bragging on the day of judgment right just bragging on jesus now look at verse 13 their throat is an open sepulcher that's like a open grave a stinking open grave as much as we hate to think about that that's what it's like like a rotting corpse with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asp is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of peace have they not known there's no fear of god before their eyes now we know that that what things whatsoever the law saith they say to them who are under the law that every mouth look at this church every mouth may be stopped see brother brandon's not going to be able to paul's not going to be able to no one's going to be able to say that they were righteous of themselves amen god had to share it with us amen amen through substitutionary effects christ took our place so that we might receive his righteousness that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god see everybody is guilty before god therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin and i'd love to just go down to verse 23 being justified freely by his grace look at that it paints a picture we're all guilty we're all like dead open graves but by god's grace he justifies us freely and we're saved now oh there's no religion like christianity praise god where we're all like dead stinking corpse but then because of grace he makes us alive he brings us back to life and we take on his righteousness and his holiness amen praise god that's brother branham he said people are saying brother branham is more than a man he can create and jesus can look like brother branham he said now ever who said this i'm your brother jesus is your savior i cannot be your savior for he's already saved you now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth brother branham could jesus look like you or you be jesus or something like that one sense of the word that's exactly truth another sense of the word is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the lord jesus would be an antichrist for the that person the lord jesus is sitting at the right hand of the majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you you who have him it's exactly the truth and you become christ remember my message on messiah see the word messiah means the anointed one now you are if you have the holy spirit you become the anointed one see then there's all kinds of anointed ones praise god but to me as a person william branham or any other man or woman to be the lord jesus christ our savior that is an heir but to be anointed with his spirit which brings his own person of his life into you he said now you understand we are messiahs but not that jesus he is our father we're just anointed with the spirit and that's the reason his life that gets people see if you don't know look he says it right here just want to make it to you if you don't set and think it through it gets people to believe well this guy would be the messiah so see but i'm showing us all these false doctrines start with people who don't set and think it through they don't even think what they're going to say or preach praise god like brother man said why is there so much marriage in divorce trouble he said they didn't wait on god and they didn't read the scripture that's in marriage in divorce 65 february he said there's two reasons they don't study the scripture and they don't pray and wait on god amen so see brother abraham says he's the messiah and we're little messiahs aren't you glad to be anointed hallelujah now here's another one i want to get to now the bible says let me go pull up the scripture real quick with a scripture where it says we're shaped in iniquity let me pull it up here real quick oh it's psalms yeah psalms 51 5. i believe this is when david sinned with bathsheba that's right yeah verse 1 says it's bathsheba so he's repenting before god he said behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me now the only way brother branham uh the only way he could be equal with god is if he'd have to be virgin born right so i said like this brother bran was different in all three ways than jesus christ praise god there's no way he was the same because jesus never sinned in his mind jesus never sinned in his flesh remember he read that uh they're swift to shed blood remember brother man was gonna go kill people when he was a teenager they're swept to go shed blood that's right but jesus never did that praise god he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing praise god and so see the virgin birth makes jesus christ a new creation praise god totally different than anyone else who's ever lived on the earth amen amen adam was partly like him but not all the way so that's uh psalms 51 5. behold i was shaping in iniquity and in in sin did my mother conceive me now this word means uh to be twisted uh to be distressed yeah to be twisted together i guess so i was twisted in iniquity so like the bible talks about you were knit together in your mother's womb now look at that church isn't it isn't it striking with the other series we're on the mystery of iniquity satan is the mystery of iniquity and he and he tries to get into us who are shaped in iniquity but see even though we start now look but man said we come to the earth without a fighting chance we'd have a fighting chance on our own because the mystery of iniquity is already working in us he's already working iniquity in us and the iniquity is already in our members praise god we're creatures of iniquity in our flesh in our minds and satan's got a he's got a pretty easy job right to the unbeliever but god in his mercy reaches down and he gives us a portion of himself praise god amen he gives us a portion of godliness amen of faith and virtue and knowledge and he just fills us up and that empowers us to want to kick out all the iniquity praise god amen oh it's glorious so we start off our iniquities in our flesh right and our mind is often set on iniquity david said i was shaping iniquity and sin did my mother conceive me now brother adam reads this scripture from uh hebrews 6. we're not going to turn there but he says you'll probably remember it uh he says let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundations of laying on of hands and baptisms now i want to look at this word here uh i want to read this quote here now do you know there's only one way you'll stand the presence of god that's being perfect god cannot tolerate unholy things you know i so often think about that when i come here to church before to pray before service many times i cover my face because when i pray i remember brother branham said even the holy seraphims have two wings that cover their faces and brother says if they uh if they're so holy yet they have to humble themselves what about us right now i know the blood of jesus christ you know unites us back right and we have we have perfect forgiveness but we want to humble ourselves brother says we use those six wings to humble ourselves right two to cover your face two to work and then two to fly i can't remember all the three i can't remember the three now uh in service humility i can't remember the third one but you have two sets i'm sorry three sets of two wings and we learned from the seraphims that we've got to humble ourselves praise god and i think how can i think that i can just come into god's presence i need to humble myself if the holy angels who never sin have to humble themselves what about me and it helps me to humble myself bill graham said how are you going to stay in the presence of a holy god he says and you legalist how you ever perfect yourself when you have not one thing to perfect yourself with you were born in sin your very conception was in sin the very desire of you being here was sin you're born in sin shaken iniquity come to the world speaking lies now where are you going to stand at he said where you sinner that said i'll quit smoking i'll go to heaven where are you lukewarm moss back so-called christian that goes around here with a long face saying well i belong to the church he said you sinner he said that's right unless you're born of the spirit of god you're lost now we know he changes that later right because he says you can be saved you can be justified and be saved right you can be sanctified and be saved see so he this is in 57 this is way before he got that revelation in 63. he said how are you going to heaven you say i never lied in my life oh the darling it was just an angel this was an angel to begin with he said that's a lie he said i don't care how good you are you're a sinner and you don't have one thing there's no priest no bishop no cardinal no pope no nothing else can save you because he's just the same boat that you're in we'll get into in a few minutes just the same he said whether he was the pope of rome he was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born by sexual desire of a man and woman where are you going to get righteous out of that well his pop and mama were born the same way and his grandma and grandpa on back he said it's sin to begin with so probably i'm showing how we were born and shaped in iniquity and he says later we have no fighting chance in other words we need a deliverer we need someone to save us amen we cannot save ourselves so if you listen to the hebrew series i was listening to this morning brother madam is majoring on this this series is a major on salvation he just goes over more to show how there he goes every every uh thought he can bring across to show how we are not saved by our works we're saved by grace he says so you who say that this is holy and that is holy there's only one holy thing that's jesus christ the son of the living god who has been made perfect and our requirement is to be perfect now how are we going to be it try it yourself i'd hate to try to get to heaven on the merits of i was born five minutes ago and going out of the world right now he said i'd be lost if i never had an evil thought in my life if i never spoke a bad word in my life if i never looked at anything evil never thought anything evil or nothing i'm just as rank and black as the smutty walls of hell i'm a sinner now that's an interesting quote because later brother said all babies go to heaven right and we know he changed that doctrine right but brother is making the point here that without god's grace we're all destined for hell he said i might join the lutheran baptist pentecostal he said when i'm on the cradle role and live faithfully to that church until 100 years and my life is took and no man ever point their finger at me and say has he ever heard had as much as a bad thought i'll go to hell just as sure as i'm standing look what brother man says i'm a sinner that's correct i have nothing there's no way at all i could find any price to be paid god required death and if i gave my own life if i give my life then how can i repent because the debt has to be paid first and god was the only one who could lay his life down and take it up again so he could become sin and lay his life down and pick it up and i call it justice and the debt is paid there you are so i just read through that i know it's a long quote so bear with me but i just want you to show how brother ram said he was a sinner and he couldn't save himself and there's nothing he could do to save himself without god intervening to save him he would be lost so it takes him out of the way of he was not like jesus in any way jesus was all holy he was the word made flesh amen amen so i just want you to see that brother says without god's grace i'm a sinner and you know the quotes where he says i'm not infallible okay now i just want to uh start with that by god's grace now you know brother ham said he had a critical spirit many times remember the woman with the purple lipstick in ohio with the cops remember that story brother random walked in and there's two so there was two cops abusing the woman so flirting with her and brother man walked in the bathroom and said god how can you put up with this trash why does my rebecca and sarah have to grow up with all this trash and then remember how god showed brother branham a vision how do you remember what i'm talking about i'll read a little bit of it here he said oh god how can you look at such stuff as that my little sarah and rebecca have to grow up in a be in a world like that why don't you just destroy the whole thing and take it off i don't see how you can stand it to look as such as that and i was standing there criticizing her he said i went back he said and it kind of got dark in the corner and god gave me a vision and changed my mind he said i saw a world and around the world looked like a red streak just to spray and something said this is the blood of jesus who died to save sinners that's the reason that god can't destroy he can't see her now look at that he can't see her he can't every mortal being has a right has a right to accept their salvation until they die and go beyond that blood they don't have to stand the judgment they're already judged the day either of the day you die but as long as you're here you got a right to the tree of life if you if you'll accept it and then i looked above it there the blood the bro the blood ring and there's to the lord jesus and i've seen his thorns on his head and blood running down his face and big mockery spit over his precious beard now that's probably gross to think about tonight but remember try to picture that spit all over his beard and he was jerking his head like that every once in a while jumping like that i thought what is it my lord and he said that's your sin now brother branham your sin brother man's sin was jerking the head of jesus and he's got spit in his beard and he's got a crown of thorns on and then i seen the blood of the lord jesus to my own sins was acting like a bumper if i'd went beyond that stream of blood there and around the earth when he died to settle the same question if i went beyond that then god would have killed me just like a bumper to the car to keep your car from being hurt the bumper catches the lick the blood of jesus catches your sins amen father forgive them they don't know what they're doing he says and i looked there and my name was lying on an old book wrote with all kinds of things condemned so brother adam had a book and it was written condemned on it and i crawled up to his feet and i said lord jesus will you forgive me i didn't mean and i said you mean my sins hurt you like that and jesus said yes he took his hand and dipped it in his side took his fingers and wrote across the book and said pardoned put it behind him like that put his arms together looked at me and said i forgive you didn't i i said yes lord i love you for he said but why are you condemning her then you're willing to condemn someone else but look you was condemned once yourself and freely i pardoned you that changed my motive he said as soon as i came out of the vision he said lady i want to ask you will you forgive me for having such thoughts towards you now look are those words infallible when he was condemning them no no god was merciful she said certainly son will you pray for me that i'll be saved and i said we'll need will you kneel down here and she said i will we turn that place into a prayer meeting amen glory that's right the woman got saved see god will provide money god will provide he's already provided a way of escape for everyone amen all right praise god i just want to bring that out by god's grace hope that's okay i just want to bring that as a little bit of reminder about being equal with god you know what like brother madam said they're going to try to make an image under the prophet in the last days but we will not bow to that praise god we'll bow to christ now let's go to verse uh 12 philippians 2 12. so paul's talking about now let's get back to the humbling of christ christ humbled himself the greatest became the least and then he went back to the greatest a name that's given above every name verse 12 wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling remember this is the church of lydia this is the church of the philippian jailer right it says work out your salvation with fear and trembling not that not to get saved right because we know they're already saved but to apply the salvation right to apply the word to your life you're already saved right but you say work it out for your full obedience to christ praise god see church that's why we got to come many times with fear and trembling to the house of god right that's why brother brown would say they're popping chewing gum they're drinking coffee they're they're not taking this as seriously as they need to take it he says work it out with fear and trembling verse 13 for it is god which worketh in you both to do well to will and to do of his good pleasure now look at that in other words god will work through you when you have the right attitude when you are in fear and troubling when you're sincere before the lord then god is going to work through you but he can't work through you unless you got the right attitude praise god verse 14 do all things without murmurings and disputings so god doesn't want to hear complaining and god doesn't want to hear criticizing of others you got to correct somebody that's different right if they need to be corrected but he says let's make sure we don't complain for our selfishness and then attack other people in the body of christ remember this is all about being in one mind like-minded how can everybody in our church be like-minded this is the way right here humble ourselves search it out with fear and trembling i like what he said take upon the form of a servant be come to church thinking how can i serve people who can i serve here praise god thank you lord next verse verse 15 that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as light in the world church have you ever if we ever saw a cricket and perverse nation it's right now right have we ever seen it on this level no we've never seen it on this level the crookedness and the perverseness of all the rioters right many most politicians crooked and perverse lying as we saw this morning so we must stand out we must stand out as a light to the world in the midst of this crooked and perverse nation and we do that by refrain being thankful right not complaining and not disputing verse 16 holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain look what he's saying he's like please don't waste my efforts please don't let my preaching be in vain remember church he hadn't seen him for 11 years it's been a while since he heard this prophet it's been a long time so look at the look at the uh look at the effect of one visit look what one visit a preacher can do like when cam or brother brooks will come or all of our other precious brothers look at the value of one visit to a local church that just shocked me right there the value of one time i remember i preached up in maine one time with amen uh brother mike chinister said i just feel led to fly up there i'm like okay brother let's go up there so we flew up there i preached on the saturday night boy there was a rough spirit on that sunday morning i was the people were free and afterwards we prayed for a few people i went in the office and the pastor's sister she was in her 60s she come up and weeping brother amen and she said thank you for coming i'll never be the same amen i didn't hear you praise god that's just one trip and that's why mike was led to the lord to go up there and now see to me that was totally worth it just leaving a whole weekend i barely got any sleep you know we got there late and then the planes were delayed in boston we had to rent a hotel for like four hours and wasted like 250 bucks on one hotel for one night it was a total waste of money as far as the world is concerned but it's a great sacrifice in god's eyes amen but see one trip of one visit a one minister god is trusting that him sending that person to the church that the church will keep what was preached that many years ago in other words let's not forget what we've heard let's remember those great services let's not forget what was preached because what the answer for and we want to become what god was calling us to become back there amen amen now church for as a pastor that's my desire to i want everybody to hold forth the word of life that i haven't preached and pastored in vain right and we want to live so that brother graham's ministry wasn't in vain that there will be a bride who's ready there will be a bride who makes yourself ready for christ coming amen that it wasn't in vain here it was valuable here it was a real good investment here in akron ohio what do we do we hold forth the word of life i want to make brother brooks rejoice on that day i want my life to make brother branham rejoice on that day all the wonderful preachers we had come in i want to live in such a way that they rejoice on that day that god sent his word god sent the brother from indiana or god said the brother from louisiana uh like my wife's testimony right god said bro brother joe uh all the way from louisiana to lima to say sister that's the devil right so my wife could get victory over postpartum depression and now each time now she got a victory there and now each time she's able to take that and battle that because she knows what it is but god god thought so much of it he sent him up all the way from louisiana to iowa i'm sorry ohio that's how church that's how much god thinks of preachers praise god that's how much he thinks of the word of god he'll send somebody around the world praise god just to you amen you'll send someone across the country just to deliver you the word of god amen but then he expects you to live it right he expects you to make the most of it don't forget what was preached oh i love it praise god amen verse 17. in other words our lives validate the ministry that god sent us it proves it was the right ministry and we don't want anyone to lose their reward do we because we'll lose our rewards maybe we don't lose our souls of course but we want to live in such a godly way remember what was preached live it so that the preaching wasn't in vain church what what good would it have been for god to shake that prison house save the jailer do all these miracles and then they all go back into the world what good have that been no good right so again it places the salvation and the the baptism of the holy ghost in such a high esteem praise god now that the greatest miracle that can happen is someone to be fully committed permanently in the kingdom of god not temporary permanently i never set my timer you're good people nobody stood up to correct me on that one let me uh how long have i been preaching lydia okay okay give me five minutes see we don't want to lose our reward church and we can't help but people leave right we just can't help and we do all we all we can do we do all we can do to try to bring them back right but we are the ones who have to receive the word and run the race for christ verse 17 yay and i if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith paul's a sacrifice for who for their faith jesus was looking who can i make a sacrifice to raise their faith ah choose paul paul will be the sacrifice he will sacrifice everything he was doing he'll sacrifice his family right now he wasn't married but you know his regular family he'll sacrifice everything he loved and i will call him to go on missionary trips i'll make him the sacrifice that you yet your faith can be encouraged if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all most of us have never seen an animal sacrifice have you now some of us have seen animals die right you ever see a joyful animal sacrifice you ever see an animal that likes to die no but see god's altar is different remember paul said present your bodies a living sacrifice and so paul says i jesus chose me to be on the altar of sacrifice for your faith and he says i do it with joy now that's that's quite a testimony in other words i've sacrificed my life but i have joy because i know jesus christ is strengthening you that's beautiful church you don't hear much preaching like that right we don't these these usually aren't the main texts right like revelation 10 7 luke 17 30 malachi 4 5 and 6 which they're all great texts but here he's saying i am i become the sacrifice for your faith verse 18 the same cause also do you joy and rejoice with me so see they should rejoice thank god god gave us a sacrifice god gave us a minister to minister god's word and raise our faith amen praise god verse 19 but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i may be also or maybe of good comfort when i know your state now look at this again verse 20 for i have no man like minded who will naturally care for your state remember this was all about verse two five and seven in this chapter it's all about having the same mind so it's the revelation of being in one accord for service and ministry not just for receiving the holy ghost but for continued ministry in the holy ghost that i become a servant take the mind of christ humble yourself become a servant and that's the all the mindset that's the mindset each one of us have to receive humble myself so i can sacrifice my life to serve other people verse 21 for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christ well guess what you're the all right i'm the all how many are all we're all we're all in the all see we're all selfish right we all seek our own but paul's saying be a sacrifice think the same think like me think like timothy think on the things of what does jesus christ want done on this sunday what does jesus christ want done tomorrow praise god verse 22 but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he has served with me in the gospel let's look how malcolm's my son right look how he always does what i tell him to do always i'll say malcolm go get this say malcolm go get that mountain i type that in there right that's how that's how timothy was with paul whatever the prophet said let's do it praise god amen glory see he said they have this father-son relationship the preacher preached the word we believed it we acted upon it we did what he said that's the unity god wants for all of us church him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me remember he wasn't sure am i going to get out of prison or not now of course he did verse 24 but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly yet i suppose it necessary to send unto you epiphanitis now this is the one i want to look up here look at this man upper for eyes there's my five minutes epiphanies you know this means in the greek lovely his name means lovely yeah i thought it necessary to send to you lovely my brother and companion in labor and fellow soldier but your messenger so see paul was the prophet and he needed a messenger to get a message to the fl the church in philippi so he sent epiphanitis and he that ministered to my wants so he was taking care of the prophet's needs food clothing shell no not shelter that was a prison but any knees he could get into the prison that was epiphanist's job now look what he thought about the church for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that he had he had heard i'm sorry he had heard that he had been sick now look at that is that isn't that the love we have oh i longed to see brother cam right oh i longed to see brother joe see longing for saints in other churches you longed to be with them but then he heard i'm sorry but then they heard he was sick for indeed he was sick and i unto death but god look at this god had mercy on him see church when god heals you it's his mercy god healed sister who is dead that's god's mercy so epiphanist was going to die but paul said god had mercy on him not on him only but look on me also and i think from yesterday god had mercy on your mom sisterhood too right and she was uh crying and just saying how hard it was not to see her husband for two weeks because he because of covet god not only had mercy on him but god had mercy on his wife see when god heals somebody it's not just for that person it's for other believers as well but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow look at that god will heal somebody on the brink of death just so you're not so sad praise god i mean we all got to die eventually right unless we go in the rapture but if not we're all going to die eventually but yet god will postpone it just so you're not so sad oh isn't that god isn't that merciful god no he'll let somebody get right to the brink of death and then snatch him back just so you're not so sad for a while oh god is so gracious i set him therefore the more carefully that when you see him again you may rejoice that i may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold him such i'm sorry and hold such in reputation because for the work of christ he was dying to death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me let's stand to our feet now you're going to see this later the church in philippi they missed a chance to help paul in prison but later when they got the second chance they took on that chance to help them out may god uh help us to learn a lesson from that oh wait i didn't get the chance to witness to that friend god give me another chance to witness to that friend i didn't get a chance to pray for the person god give me another chance to pray for the person that's what was happening here and church that's one thing i'm thankful for you as a church you receive god's preachers with gladness every preacher comes in here and said what a good church you have everybody pulls on the word they're not loud but they're pulling really hard i say yes because i'm the loud one god likes variety i'm the loud i got the big mouth and everybody else is just come on brother josh god likes variety after see when i read this this is how many believe this is thus saith the lord i can relate to this ah this is the book of acts being glad at the preachers who came after the prophet who are bringing you the word to raise your faith be glad and don't let brother man's ministry be in vain but receive that word and become that word how do you do that become a servant humble yourself let's just sing one song can we sing one song and just see if anyone needs prayer tonight that just bless i want to get to that because of sister who is dead god had mercy on their family and you should have saw it yesterday each one come up one at a time chiwa came up and then coup came up they each come up one at a time we're just thankful dad's still here thankful for god's mercy church that's exactly why god and you'll see it when i when i pray for sick people when you pray that's what i pray for god have mercy have mercy you don't have to let them stay lord you know how this will impact the family god have mercy spare their life and give them a longer life for your glory that's book of acts do you believe that that's like i love what brother johnny was saying god rare you know god doesn't do it instantly all the time that's that's a miracle that's a gift he's seen in his life i've seen in my life or god's healed people instantly but many times it's that divine healing that's building up our patients that we can trust god more and more let's pray here as we pray if anyone needs prayer i'll be happy to put my faith with yours how many would say uh bro jesse pray for me that we will live the word sent to us from the prophet how many would say amen to that that's my prayer lord i didn't want brother branham to run in vain i didn't want brother brooks to run in vain he ordained me a pastor here i don't want that to be in vain i
