[38:53] anointing their praise God let's take
[38:55] our Bibles here and let's go to
[38:57] Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 by God's
[39:00] grace I want to continue that little
[39:01] thought from Sunday morning about
[39:03] clothes with the cloud I want to keep
[39:06] going on that thought by God's grace
[39:11] revelation 10 verse 1 we're very
[39:14] familiar with revelation 10 7 but I
[39:16] believe revelation 10 1 was fulfilled in
[39:20] February in March of 1963 I just happen
[39:23] to believe that I'm crazy enough I
[39:24] should say I'm anointed enough to
[39:26] believe that I'll say like that the
[39:28] world will call me crazy but I'm
[39:29] anointed in God's eyes amen to recognize
[39:32] that God sent a prophet in this day amen
[39:35] and I want to I've just been felt
[39:36] burdened to do that you know as you're
[39:39] turning there you know I had a I had a
[39:41] couple from Florida contact me and they
[39:45] said brother Jess how do you explain the
[39:47] cloud you know our children are kind of
[39:50] coming against the cloud and and I've
[39:52] been talking about the Jose about the
[39:53] cloud for years and I thought I need to
[39:55] preach us someday
[39:56] so that happened last week and then I
[39:58] just kept studying on it studying on I'm
[39:59] just gonna preach it this with this
[40:01] Sunday and so if you didn't get a chance
[40:03] to listen that I think you'd enjoy that
[40:04] from Sunday morning close with the cloud
[40:07] to show how God did vindicate our
[40:09] prophet by bringing that cloud in 1963
[40:13] and so I got some good feedback on I was
[40:16] very happy a blessed people some people
[40:18] sent me some videos and some texts just
[40:20] saying what a blessing it was so that
[40:22] that makes it all worth it you know by
[40:24] God's grace when you know the Word of
[40:25] God has blessed someone it's met a need
[40:28] that they had in their heart answered
[40:29] questions we just say thank you Holy
[40:31] Spirit for helping the people praise God
[40:33] revelation 10 verse 1 let's read it
[40:39] together on three one two three and I
[40:43] saw another mighty angel come down from
[40:46] heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[40:49] rainbow was upon his head and his feet
[40:51] were as it were the Sun and his feet as
[40:54] pillars of fire amen I'm sorry I said
[40:57] that wrong his face was as it were the
[40:59] Sun not his feet forgive me let's just

[41:37] service here tonight we'll be careful to
[41:39] give you all the praise and glory and
[41:41] honor in Jesus Christ's name and
[41:43] everybody said amen god bless she's
[41:45] being seated praise the Lord I would
[41:48] like to just start with a just a brief
[41:51] review so Malachi whenever you're ready
[41:52] can switch over there I just went to a
[41:54] brief review and today I had Lydia while
[41:59] I was on the drive ahead Lydia read a
[42:00] chapter in this book it's a great book
[42:01] if you never had this Acts of the
[42:03] Prophet by Perry Greene there's over
[42:05] three hundred thousand copies in the
[42:07] world it's a great testimony of his
[42:10] interactions with brother Branham I
[42:12] think he knew program for 15 years I
[42:14] think and it's just a beautiful book
[42:18] my family's read and my family finished
[42:20] the church age book so we're grateful
[42:21] boy they just we're busy readers you
[42:23] know and so we're very thankful we
[42:25] finished the whole Bible we finished a
[42:26] church age book and now we're going to
[42:27] Acts of the Prophet I'm not sure what's
[42:29] after that maybe we'll do the seven
[42:30] seals I don't know that's that's a bit
[42:33] more difficult kind of read because it's
[42:34] not edited but the children just kind of
[42:37] they're really flown through that so but
[42:40] if you if you need a copy that let me
[42:41] know I'll buy you a copy I mean that's
[42:43] what the ministry is here for if you
[42:44] need church age books take them if you
[42:46] need books take them whatever you need
[42:47] let me know if you don't have the money
[42:49] I'll help you out by God's grace that's
[42:51] why we're here we're here to help feed
[42:52] the flock of God many ways there's a
[42:55] whole chapter in here on the cloud and
[42:57] most of it was familiar to me but a few
[42:59] things I'll add you know to this little
[43:01] message here today but let's look at our
[43:06] text here oh I forgot to read the other
[43:08] one okay but we'll get to that
[43:09] eventually that's okay we'll get to that
[43:10] one I forgot to read that when I was
[43:11] just in the thought of worshipping you
[43:13] know in Revelation 10:1 so let's just
[43:16] review from Sunday morning just real
[43:18] quick I just got a few slides there was
[43:21] a cloud pictured over flagstaff on
[43:23] February 28 1963 and it was a
[43:25] supernatural manifestation of Jesus
[43:27] Christ the cloud was formed by seven
[43:29] angels and the cloud fulfilled
[43:31] Revelation 10:1 which was important
[43:34] because it led to the
[43:36] filling of Revelation 10 7c brother
[43:39] branham couldn't finish the mystery of
[43:40] God without meeting the angels who
[43:43] commissioned him to go back east open up
[43:44] the seven seals amen and take the seven
[43:47] seals off of the book of God or the
[43:49] revelation of Jesus Christ amen and
[43:53] based on the evidence the cloud must
[43:55] have appeared twice one time it appeared
[43:58] publicly over Flagstaff on February 28th
[44:02] and then a second time it appeared to
[44:04] brother Branham privately on either
[44:05] March seventh or March depending on who
[44:07] you talk to now the critics brought up
[44:11] four main accusations against the cloud
[44:14] being a legitimate sign from God but I
[44:17] showed how they're wrong on all four
[44:19] issues remember it was prophecy and
[44:21] location and timing and I can't remember
[44:23] the other one but we looked at that on
[44:24] Sunday like I said if you're interested
[44:26] in this I would encourage you to listen
[44:28] to that one but we saw three examples
[44:31] from the Bible of people being public
[44:33] witnesses of the supernatural remember
[44:36] there was Paul when he was got knocked
[44:38] down by the light there was witnesses
[44:40] around there Jesus spoke and a thunder
[44:42] you know the what God spoke to him and
[44:44] it was heard as a thunder and there was
[44:46] one more I can't remember the third one
[44:47] and others did not but I'm sorry
[44:50] some still did not believe and others
[44:52] did not receive the full experience as
[44:54] others the third one was Jesus after he
[44:55] raised it resurrected five hundred
[44:58] people saw him at one time his eleven
[45:00] apostles saw him at one time some people
[45:02] believe some people did it so it just
[45:04] proves that you and I can't force
[45:06] anybody believe their heart has to be
[45:08] open to believe and that's the fact
[45:11] that's where brother that's where the
[45:12] Bible gets predestination from God
[45:14] cannot pre to predestiny one until first
[45:17] by foreknowledge he knows what they're
[45:20] going to choose then when he know if
[45:22] since he already knows what they're
[45:23] gonna choose then the Bible said he can
[45:25] predestinate he can ordain everything in
[45:27] their lives to work out for their good
[45:29] because they love God amen because God's
[45:32] not gonna force anybody to love him he's
[45:34] never he's a he's a gentleman he's never
[45:36] gonna force himself he's always gonna be
[45:38] humbling and you know he's always gonna
[45:40] be knocking saying open the door I like
[45:43] to eat with you I like to have a
[45:44] spiritual meal with you amen
[45:46] he's always going to be doing that and
[45:49] some people don't get the full
[45:51] experience some people just doubt the
[45:52] whole thing but the believers boys
[45:55] believe the Word of God amen and
[45:57] programs cloud vision and experience
[45:59] match Ezekiel's prophetic experiences
[46:02] that was beautiful that that was just
[46:03] tremendous one time God literally picked
[46:06] up
[46:06] Ezekiel took him from his home in
[46:09] Jerusalem right oh right over to Babylon
[46:12] it was a translation just like Philip
[46:14] the Bible says that the second time he
[46:16] stayed in his house and the Bible said
[46:18] God picked him up by the hair his body
[46:20] stayed there God picked him up by his
[46:22] theophany hair carried him over to the
[46:24] the temple of in Israel showed him all
[46:27] the abominations in the temple and
[46:29] brother Brahim experienced the same
[46:30] thing a man brother man was physically
[46:33] caught up into the cloud physically a
[46:35] translation caught up into that cloud
[46:37] and then the other time when he went
[46:39] beyond the curtain of time his body
[46:40] stayed there but God lifted up his
[46:42] theophany amen we serve a
[46:45] miracle-working God amen we serve the
[46:48] same God of the Bible and the same God
[46:49] of the brother branham amen
[46:51] beautiful now then then we saw this how
[46:54] the first time brother Branham mentioned
[46:56] that Life magazine article which I left
[46:58] in my office but we looked at it on
[46:59] Sunday if you want to borrow it let me
[47:01] know but just please take real good care
[47:02] of it because I someone gave it to me
[47:04] and it was over a hundred dollars or
[47:05] something like that but the very the
[47:09] very first sermon brother Branham rep
[47:11] mentions this this this cloud brother
[47:13] way died in the end of the service
[47:15] brother Branham went in prayed for him
[47:17] and he came back to life right there in
[47:19] service so that was the vindication that
[47:21] life was with that cloud life was in
[47:23] that cloud Jesus was that cloud amen and
[47:26] Jesus is the way the truth and the life
[47:29] he's the life amen so Life magazine
[47:31] Jesus Christ and Jesus brings him back
[47:33] to life amen
[47:35] beautiful and then we saw on Sunday how
[47:38] the critics of the cloud had many
[47:39] erroneous videos but they rarely attack
[47:42] the doctrine of brother Branham because
[47:44] they have no scriptural backing for
[47:45] their false doctrine
[47:46] they'll never defeat water baptism they
[47:48] never defeat how God's one person though
[47:50] never the Bible never says he's three
[47:52] gods so they don't attack the doctor
[47:54] because the doctrine is rock solid amen
[47:56] but we must love our enemies we want to
[47:58] speak the truth in love now for today I
[48:00] excited try to keep it really short with
[48:02] the review
[48:03] for today I would look at a few things
[48:05] as I read this as Lydia rather read this
[48:08] to me on the way to church I was I was
[48:10] driving to church there's a few things
[48:12] that I want to mention that we wrote
[48:13] down here I thought would be helpful to
[48:15] you and actually let me one of them I'm
[48:17] going to mention I'm gonna show you back
[48:18] the picture that brother Chad Lam so in
[48:22] a moment in a moment we'll talk about
[48:24] this but the first one brother Perry
[48:27] Greene noted how st. Paul was caught up
[48:30] to the third heaven how many more of
[48:31] that it was in second Corinthians
[48:33] chapter 12 I believe Paul said I knew a
[48:35] man above 14 years ago he was caught up
[48:38] into third heaven later he said it was
[48:40] me he said because of the abundance of
[48:42] my revelations God allowed Satan to buff
[48:44] at me with buffeting messengers remember
[48:47] to keep me humble for all the
[48:49] revelations that have been that have
[48:50] been given to him okay so the same thing
[48:53] with brother ran just as Paul was carved
[48:55] a third heaven brother Brandon was
[48:56] caught up into a constellation of angels
[48:58] and it's exactly scriptural now this one
[49:02] this was even more striking here but
[49:05] there Chad lamb preached this at his
[49:07] church and I'm sorry I got cut off there
[49:08] I didn't do a good job of I didn't do a
[49:10] good job of that anyways the critics of
[49:13] the clouds say that the cloud that was
[49:16] seen here over Flagstaff that that
[49:18] pyramid cloud was actually the debris
[49:21] from an exploded rocket but as this
[49:25] brother said as the Perry green said he
[49:26] read the other scientific articles that
[49:29] that for rocket exploded five hundred
[49:31] miles off the coast five hundred miles
[49:37] he said that's what the weather wise
[49:39] magazine said so it makes it even more
[49:42] impossible so I don't know if this is
[49:43] the I don't think it's 10 miles from
[49:45] Flagstaff to California I'm pretty sure
[49:47] it's not so I don't know if this trip
[49:50] this calculation is wrong or if it's
[49:52] even more than that I think it's more
[49:53] net because he says in here it exploded
[49:56] 500 miles off the coastline so it could
[49:59] have been down here could have been out
[50:00] there and then somehow three hours and
[50:03] 48 minutes at sunset on September 28th
[50:06] it's a bug of it's above Flagstaff and
[50:08] the shocking thing was if it did explode
[50:11] 500 miles out here it traveled all these
[50:13] miles and no one even saw it until it
[50:16] got over Flagstaff
[50:17] and then when it was over flagstaff more
[50:20] than 80 people took a picture of it sent
[50:22] it in to the scientists and said we saw
[50:25] this this is amazing we've never seen
[50:27] anything like it before
[50:28] - my opinion it could not been a thaw
[50:30] rocket it had to bet Almighty God Amen
[50:33] because when have you seen when have you
[50:35] seen debris look that nice you've never
[50:39] seen an explosion look that nice where
[50:41] it's just perfectly like a pyramid or
[50:43] anything like that never Church it never
[50:45] looks like that where's all the pieces
[50:46] of the rocket you know where's all that
[50:48] it just doesn't make any sense so I
[50:50] wanted to tell you a little more facts
[50:52] that brother Peregrine knew about that
[50:54] brother Peregrine says he talked to the
[50:56] man who studied it there at the
[50:58] University of Tucson or Arizona
[51:00] whichever University was and I want to
[51:03] make sure you saw that by the grace of
[51:05] God so there was no way that could have
[51:08] happened okay so does that help by God's
[51:11] grace I just hope that's just I just
[51:13] want to real real quickly review that
[51:15] let me set my timer here so I don't go
[51:17] too long tonight I'll be honest if I go
[51:20] too long I really have a hard time on
[51:22] Thursday because I get I have a hard
[51:23] time going to sleep the longer I preach
[51:25] the more I feel like I get in the spirit
[51:27] and then the hardest for me to fall
[51:28] asleep and then it wears me out for the
[51:30] next few days but if I can just punch it
[51:32] you know but and so there's a bounce you
[51:35] know brother branham told brother
[51:36] neville he said if you can preach a 35
[51:38] or 45 minute sermon he said that's just
[51:40] what the people need but then he says
[51:43] sometimes you got to preach really long
[51:44] and he says because you fill up heavy
[51:47] you got to empty out long you know so
[51:49] there's a balance so on Wednesday night
[51:51] so maybe I'll try to just shoot for this
[51:52] hour here that's what I like to do I
[51:54] think you understand what I'm trying to
[51:56] say now I want to just bring this out of
[51:58] the scripture so if you have your Bibles
[51:59] you can turn but I do have the
[52:01] scriptures up here I believe we want to
[52:03] you know part of this sermon about clos
[52:05] with the cloud we are taking sides with
[52:08] God's prophet that's what we're doing
[52:10] and the same thing had to be done in
[52:13] Paul's day I don't know if you knew this
[52:14] but Paul said he told Timothy in his
[52:16] very last letter before his head got
[52:18] chopped or chopped off by the Roman
[52:20] government he said be not thou therefore
[52:23] ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor
[52:26] of me his prisoner so don't be ashamed
[52:29] to my testimony
[52:31] but be thou partaker of the afflictions
[52:33] of the Gospel according to the power of
[52:36] God
[52:37] so Paul tells them if you actually
[52:38] accept me as God's prophet and messenger
[52:41] you're gonna suffer you're going to be
[52:43] rejected
[52:44] people are gonna disdain you people are
[52:46] gonna you're gonna have reproach all
[52:48] because you accept the messenger of the
[52:50] hour how many how many have ever
[52:51] experienced any reproach we're following
[52:53] the message of the hour all the time
[52:55] amen no he says now we are not ashamed
[53:00] of brother branham's testimony Oh Paul
[53:03] spent time trying to convince the
[53:04] Corinthian church to receive him and use
[53:07] his testimony for support can you
[53:09] imagine that a man who'd raised the dead
[53:11] a man who had done miracles healed a
[53:15] complete island the island of Malita the
[53:17] Bible said everybody on the island got
[53:19] healed and God had got it done so many
[53:22] miracles in Paul's life and yet here he
[53:26] has to convince the Corinth in church
[53:27] won't you receive me won't you receive
[53:30] my preachers he was begging for them to
[53:32] let him in their door and preach to them
[53:34] a man of God like that what does it show
[53:38] it shows that God's messengers as much
[53:40] as God vindicate them it takes an
[53:42] individual to have a heart that loves
[53:44] the Word of God amen
[53:47] now look what he says now look in
[53:49] Chapter seven in Chapter 11 he says
[53:51] receive us he's begging them receive us
[53:53] we've wronged no man so there must have
[53:56] been someone who thought Paul had
[53:57] wronged the Corinthians isn't that what
[54:00] they do to preachers they try to say
[54:01] with a preacher this wrong the preacher
[54:03] did that wrong the preacher did they're
[54:05] always pointing out the wrong things
[54:06] instead of the good things and the
[54:07] church said because if you want to find
[54:10] something wrong with me or anybody else
[54:12] you're gonna find it but if it's wrong
[54:14] you got to go to the person to correct
[54:16] it praise God and then the person's
[54:18] really letting the Holy Spirit they'll
[54:19] receive their correction and their life
[54:21] will line right back up with the Word of
[54:22] God
[54:22] everybody does that in fact I'll be just
[54:24] as bold to say everybody has to do that
[54:26] every single day of their life amen Paul
[54:31] says receive us please a Messenger of
[54:33] God who saw the pillar of fire who got
[54:37] his eyesight back after being blind you
[54:39] know his scales fell off his eyes and he
[54:41] saw Jesus Christ the hope the pillar
[54:43] fire
[54:44] like receive us please receive us in
[54:47] Chapter 11 he says I say again let no
[54:50] man think me a fool that means people
[54:52] were calling Paul a fool in the very
[54:55] church he started he said all they're
[54:56] just he's just a fool a mighty man of
[55:00] God we'd say letter the Holy Spirit if
[55:03] otherwise yeah as a fool receive me so
[55:05] he said if you're gonna call me a fool
[55:07] receive me as a fool that I may boast
[55:10] myself a little say yea just consider me
[55:13] a fool but let me brag on Jesus Christ
[55:15] amen
[55:16] let that be your testimony of the night
[55:18] for anyone to anyone here if you just
[55:21] think someone's a fool just let them
[55:22] back just appreciate how much they love
[55:24] Jesus amen
[55:25] somebody makes a mistake forgive them
[55:27] right receive them receive the Word of
[55:30] God amen
[55:31] so Paul know as as as mighty as God and
[55:35] vindicated his message he still was
[55:38] rejected by many people so remember what
[55:42] did he say he sees so trying to convince
[55:44] them he says of the Jews five times I
[55:47] received forty stripes save one thrice
[55:50] was i beaten with rods once was i stoned
[55:53] thrice I was shipwrecked a night and a
[55:56] day I have been in the deep now I've
[56:00] never experienced anything like that but
[56:02] I have been told you're not welcome to
[56:03] come back there to preach anymore I
[56:05] haven't told that we don't want to hear
[56:07] preaching like that anymore we're not
[56:09] going to give you any more invitations I
[56:10] haven't told that I know people have
[56:12] told people stay away from brother Jesse
[56:14] don't listen to his preaching I've had
[56:16] had that but I've never had anything too
[56:18] severe but remember he had to experience
[56:20] this so he could understand the
[56:22] sufferings of Christ which he used to
[56:24] put on people holding their coats they
[56:28] could stone Stephen just standing and
[56:30] not saying anything so he had to suffer
[56:33] because he caused so much suffering he
[56:35] allowed so much suffering but he said he
[56:37] said for me to live as Christ to died as
[56:40] my gain amen
[56:41] it was a joy to him it was a pleasure
[56:44] for him to suffer like his Lord because
[56:47] of ours Lord had done for him ain't
[56:49] ahead saved him from no doubt he'll mine
[56:54] now here's
[56:55] I've mentioned recently I may have been
[56:57] a little wrong on this I want to bring
[56:58] this out tonight Paul says now this is
[57:01] the same last letter to Timothy this
[57:03] thou knowest that they all day which are
[57:05] in Asia be turned away from me of whom
[57:10] are Fidelis and Hermogenes the Lord gave
[57:14] mercy on the house of own F for us
[57:17] Inessa for us for he oft refresh me and
[57:20] was not ashamed of my chain so now we
[57:23] know the reason many of the people in
[57:25] Asia rejected Paul because he got
[57:28] arrested and put in jail how could a
[57:31] real preacher go to be put in jail come
[57:34] on your your pastor is a real man of God
[57:37] he got put in jail
[57:38] Oh your church age messenger he preaches
[57:41] the truth and yet he's arrested and
[57:43] spending years in jail that's so the
[57:46] reason they were ashamed of it was
[57:48] because he was suffering for the gospel
[57:49] of Christ but little did Satan know that
[57:51] while Paul was in prison he was right in
[57:53] most of the New Testament Amen
[57:55] hallelujah praise God
[57:57] see God works everything for his glory
[57:59] amen how could it be God's glory for me
[58:02] to be in prison how could it be in God's
[58:04] glory for me to be arrested and
[58:06] everybody's rejected me and God's like
[58:07] just let them go let the blind lead the
[58:09] blind you preach the word you write the
[58:12] word let me write my let me breathe into
[58:14] you my very words that you might write
[58:17] it and send it out to the churches that
[58:19] even the churches in Akron 2,000 years
[58:21] later can receive strength from the
[58:23] message of that hour amen glory because
[58:26] that's the same letters we're reading
[58:27] tonight amen the same ones he penned in
[58:30] prison are inspiring you and I tonight
[58:32] are you inspired you ought to be but man
[58:35] said don't love ever lose your
[58:36] enthusiasm for the word of God in other
[58:38] words never leave your first love
[58:40] hallelujah they're ashamed well he got
[58:44] arrested well your your your man of God
[58:47] went to jail my pastor didn't that's
[58:49] because he didn't preach against sin
[58:51] that's because he let everybody sin in
[58:53] the church that's because he rejects the
[58:56] holy spirit right but Paul didn't and
[59:00] that's why he was arrested and put in
[59:03] prison they're ashamed of his
[59:06] imprisonment now this is a commentary
[59:08] brother Ram did
[59:09] reference this I could show to you if
[59:11] you want this is the commentary he used
[59:12] in church you know brother branham never
[59:16] said you know the lexicon or the dyg lot
[59:18] was thus saith the Lord
[59:19] he never said Scofield er or any of
[59:21] those guys with us saith the Lord
[59:23] but brother Brandon would read them and
[59:24] then the Holy Spirit would point out
[59:26] that this was the truth of God and he
[59:28] pulled this truth and that truth now all
[59:31] of it was truth of course because
[59:32] they're not the Bible those writers and
[59:33] those books the lexicon of Adar not
[59:36] though the true Word of God but there's
[59:38] thoughts in there that he could pull out
[59:39] and then he would show them to the
[59:41] people and those would be inspired
[59:42] thoughts of God amen
[59:44] there it is brother am pulling
[59:46] inspiration from the written truths that
[59:49] were out there which that's just what
[59:50] Jeremiah did remember um so that's what
[59:52] Daniel did remember the Bible said
[59:54] Daniel read the words of Jeremiah and
[59:56] then he understood the 490 years Daniel
[1:00:00] seventy weeks that's what the Bible says
[1:00:01] the way Daniel understood it was by
[1:00:04] reading what Jeremiah said brother
[1:00:06] Branham do the same amen now this one it
[1:00:09] says here all who there are now when
[1:00:11] they were in Rome not be or are but
[1:00:13] turned from me then were ashamed of my
[1:00:15] chain in contrast to Oh Nessa for us so
[1:00:19] those in Asia at that church now this is
[1:00:22] where I've been wrong I thought that
[1:00:23] every church in Asia rejected Paul but
[1:00:25] apparently that's not the truth
[1:00:27] according to this this commentary but
[1:00:29] again I don't know I'm just saying I
[1:00:31] could be wrong I'm just letting you know
[1:00:32] I could be wrong I want to be humble
[1:00:34] enough if I'm wrong to say I'm wrong I
[1:00:37] want to be humble enough he said they
[1:00:41] did not stand with me but forsook me it
[1:00:42] is possible that the occasion of their
[1:00:44] turning from him was that his
[1:00:46] apprehension and Nicko Paulus whether
[1:00:48] they had escorted him on his way to Rome
[1:00:50] but from which they turn back to Asia a
[1:00:52] hint to Timothy now in Asia not to be
[1:00:55] like them but to imitate rather onesa
[1:00:57] force and to come to him amen
[1:01:00] so for whatever reason these Asian
[1:01:01] churches didn't like him being arrested
[1:01:03] they didn't come visit him anymore they
[1:01:05] didn't come seeing him anymore but Paul
[1:01:07] says be like own Ephesus he's often
[1:01:09] refreshed me in church we got to make
[1:01:12] sure that we're constantly seeing to the
[1:01:14] words of brother Branham we have to make
[1:01:16] sure we don't leave brother Branham
[1:01:17] behind like they left Paul behind praise
[1:01:20] the Lord we have to do the
[1:01:22] to make sure we're hearing the voice of
[1:01:25] God's prophet amen
[1:01:28] see they left him behind that's what I
[1:01:29] said before the same it's the same idea
[1:01:32] when Joanna
[1:01:33] when Herodias cut off John the Baptist's
[1:01:35] head she silenced the prophet and we
[1:01:38] can't let brother and his voice be
[1:01:40] silenced in our lives it's the same
[1:01:43] ideal I'm not going to listen that
[1:01:44] anymore I'm not gonna put up with that
[1:01:46] anymore I'm not gonna do that anymore
[1:01:47] it's the same idea they're silencing the
[1:01:49] messenger the star of the hour but we're
[1:01:52] not to run from it were to enjoy the
[1:01:54] light and the fire of the star amen
[1:01:57] hallelujah we're supposed to gain power
[1:01:59] from that every time I hear brother
[1:02:02] Branham preach I get something off some
[1:02:03] some type of inspiration off one of the
[1:02:05] office servants every single one there's
[1:02:07] only something that strikes or I never
[1:02:09] heard of like that never heard of like
[1:02:10] that it's constantly pouring out to us
[1:02:12] because why the Holy Spirit was with him
[1:02:14] and the Holy Spirit's with us amen so I
[1:02:19] could be wrong it may not have been
[1:02:21] every church in Asia but at least all
[1:02:23] those with Fela genus and high manias I
[1:02:27] may have said that wrong they're Asian
[1:02:29] churches had rejected Paul now Church I
[1:02:33] don't know about you but I'm going to
[1:02:34] stand with brother Branham the critics
[1:02:37] mostly attack on their videos and their
[1:02:39] websites and their blogs they mostly
[1:02:41] attack how he changed dates when he told
[1:02:43] stories and details of his stories
[1:02:46] that's what they attacked the most but
[1:02:49] let me say this
[1:02:50] none of those changes contradict the
[1:02:53] state the Lord statements so so for
[1:02:55] example the brother Branham said there's
[1:02:58] one video they have can you believe they
[1:02:59] did this silly video they did a video
[1:03:01] where brother Branham said my dad died
[1:03:03] in my arms when I was just a boy
[1:03:05] and they calculated and found out
[1:03:07] brother Branham was like 32 years old
[1:03:09] and so they say oh brother and was not a
[1:03:13] boy he was 32 years old but if you go
[1:03:15] back and listen to brother Branham
[1:03:16] that's what he means by a young man he
[1:03:18] just calls young man boys and brother
[1:03:23] Aaron is never saying like thus saith
[1:03:24] the Lord like my dad died in my arms
[1:03:26] when I was fifteen he never said that
[1:03:28] and yet they make a whole video saying
[1:03:31] he he wasn't a boys 33 years old see he
[1:03:34] wasn't a prophet shame on them
[1:03:36] are they attacking water baptism they
[1:03:38] won't touch that because that's the sort
[1:03:40] of the word they say they can't handle
[1:03:43] that sharp sword of the Word of God
[1:03:45] so they go off on little details like
[1:03:47] like that well then another one they did
[1:03:48] was a but the bærum said the cars will
[1:03:50] be in egg shapes at the end time so they
[1:03:52] they they showed a video of a Cadbury
[1:03:54] bunny car and they play silly music mock
[1:03:57] and brother branham but if you listen to
[1:04:00] the quote brother Ram said it would be
[1:04:01] an egg-shaped type of car he didn't say
[1:04:03] just like an egg he said an egg shape
[1:04:05] and if you compare cars from 1933 there
[1:04:08] like rectangular boxes like rectangular
[1:04:10] prisms compare that now to just your
[1:04:13] Honda Accord and you can see the top of
[1:04:15] any car out there any that's like a
[1:04:17] four-door sedan they're all egg-shaped
[1:04:20] there are all of them compared to what
[1:04:22] they were nine thirty 1933 what are they
[1:04:24] doing they're picking that little thing
[1:04:26] they're straining at a net and
[1:04:27] swallowing a camel but you and I by the
[1:04:30] grace of the Holy Spirit our bodies will
[1:04:33] be swallowed up in life at the rapture
[1:04:35] amen that's a swirl look you're gonna
[1:04:37] have amen they're swallowing down all
[1:04:40] kinds of lies but we're going to be
[1:04:42] slowed up in the Holy Spirit in a brand
[1:04:44] new glorified body when we meet Christ
[1:04:46] in the air amen
[1:04:48] I hope it happens in my life birth amen
[1:04:50] over the air and I hope it happens
[1:04:51] limonite if not I'll be the first one to
[1:04:54] be there because the Bible said the dead
[1:04:56] in Christ will rise first they met on a
[1:04:58] new yacht
[1:04:59] amen thank you Jesus plus as I said this
[1:05:05] have any of those critics ever had a
[1:05:09] schedule like brother branham and what I
[1:05:11] mean by that is brother brand didn't
[1:05:12] have time to write down all these dates
[1:05:14] and all these details you never had time
[1:05:16] to write a book leave al edited that
[1:05:18] book for him right the church age book
[1:05:20] leave bro man just he just heard it and
[1:05:22] he wrote back his comments and
[1:05:24] everything like that he didn't have time
[1:05:26] look what he was doing I can show you
[1:05:28] quotes from Noah that listen to know
[1:05:30] that not 1965 brother Graham said he
[1:05:32] drove all night to get the church agreed
[1:05:36] to get back to Jeffersonville and he
[1:05:38] said I didn't have time to crack open my
[1:05:39] Bible because I drove all night and day
[1:05:41] to get back and brother Neville just
[1:05:43] said come preach to the pulpit and he
[1:05:44] didn't have many texts or any notes
[1:05:46] that's how dedicated that man was the
[1:05:48] church
[1:05:49] and listen that tape he said I could
[1:05:51] have sat home and I could have rested
[1:05:52] and stayed there he said but how could I
[1:05:54] do that knowing that all of you are
[1:05:55] gathered on a Wednesday night prayer
[1:05:57] meeting worshiping the Lord he said I
[1:05:59] needed to be in the house of God like
[1:06:01] you are amen
[1:06:02] that's a real example right there amen
[1:06:05] hallelujah
[1:06:07] now one of those critics ever done that
[1:06:09] drive all day then preach their hearts
[1:06:10] out and this whole time brother branham
[1:06:14] he's preaching he's praying for the sick
[1:06:16] he got calls all the time
[1:06:17] pray for the sick encountering visions
[1:06:20] and then dealing with the physical
[1:06:22] strain of visions one vision left Daniel
[1:06:25] sick for several days the Bible says and
[1:06:28] brother Branham I have the coal I could
[1:06:31] show it to you afterwards brother
[1:06:32] Branham says the reason I can handle
[1:06:34] more visions is because Jesus Christ
[1:06:36] said in John 14:12
[1:06:38] that the word he said greater works will
[1:06:40] you do because I go to my father
[1:06:43] hallelujah he knew where he stood he
[1:06:46] said I can handle more than Daniel
[1:06:47] because Jesus said I could do greater
[1:06:49] works than that hey man I wonder how
[1:06:53] many of those critics ever had to do
[1:06:55] that how about interpreting dreams or
[1:06:58] answering questions I wonder how many
[1:07:01] but see they got all this they got all
[1:07:02] this free time they're not reading their
[1:07:03] Bibles save all this free time to attack
[1:07:05] God's prophet all this time to make
[1:07:07] videos and blog posts and and all these
[1:07:10] things like that to attack brother
[1:07:11] Branham and what are they doing for the
[1:07:13] kingdom of God all brother Branham was
[1:07:14] trying to do was get demons cast out of
[1:07:16] people he's trying to get soul saved and
[1:07:19] get him baptized in Jesus Christ saying
[1:07:20] well these guys do it they don't
[1:07:22] understand nothing so they should get
[1:07:24] off his back amen
[1:07:25] you understand that's why I stand with I
[1:07:29] stand with brother Branham although he
[1:07:30] mixed up a few dates
[1:07:31] nothing was mixed up with thus saith the
[1:07:33] Lord he just got a few dates you know he
[1:07:36] just said things though different than
[1:07:37] what people understood it doesn't change
[1:07:40] the meaning of those experiences also
[1:07:44] now this is very sensitive I hope you
[1:07:47] understand the critics attack the
[1:07:49] statements about miss dogmeat and
[1:07:51] marriage and divorce where brother Ram
[1:07:52] calls a woman immoral woman not a godly
[1:07:55] woman and a moral woman a spiritual he
[1:07:59] said that he's a sexual trash disposal
[1:08:02] that's what he calls a more
[1:08:03] now that's rough and the church said
[1:08:06] this is rough miss dog me and Anna
[1:08:10] sexual of this garbage disposal that's
[1:08:12] rough but that is the scripture because
[1:08:15] that's what we read that on last
[1:08:17] Wednesday night we read that with
[1:08:18] Solomon members in Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:08:22] 7 he said where can I find out of a
[1:08:24] thousand women I can't find one good one
[1:08:26] of course he was hanging around bad ones
[1:08:27] that was his fault he knew it a proper
[1:08:30] Saudi one woman he knew he should have
[1:08:31] been hanging around those but he had BAC
[1:08:33] stood in his own age and so see people
[1:08:37] criticize well he's just so hard on
[1:08:39] women will so was so was every Bible
[1:08:41] preacher everybody Paul said don't even
[1:08:44] let him speak in the church make sure
[1:08:46] they ask their husbands the questions at
[1:08:48] home that's what Paul said right that's
[1:08:51] the Word of God but see they don't
[1:08:54] remember how Elijah was forceful even
[1:08:58] aggressive with the prophets of bail
[1:09:00] they don't remember that brother Branham
[1:09:04] had this spirit of Elijah and today's
[1:09:06] culture is different than his day as
[1:09:08] everyone was aware of the controversy
[1:09:10] with makeup wearing pants and all the
[1:09:12] other things that were changing you
[1:09:15] listen to our challenge you go listen
[1:09:16] look up mrs. dog me and listen to what
[1:09:19] the people do they laugh after it we'll
[1:09:21] see in those days you could say things
[1:09:23] like that people would laugh you say
[1:09:25] today people are gonna call you
[1:09:26] hypocrite they're gonna want to fight
[1:09:28] you after church they're gonna walk out
[1:09:31] the door and slam the door behind them
[1:09:32] and don't get me wrong that's personal
[1:09:34] that's there was some very tough things
[1:09:36] to say but Elijah said the same thing on
[1:09:39] Mount Carmel he said where is your God
[1:09:41] did your God Baal fun vacation is he
[1:09:44] taking a nap somewhere do you want to
[1:09:46] wait till he wakes up from his nap he
[1:09:49] said go ahead and cut yourselves going
[1:09:50] to all these things he said but I've
[1:09:52] done everything at the command of the
[1:09:54] Lord in other words I saw the visions
[1:09:56] and I know what's going to happen I've
[1:09:57] got the saint the Lord he said and just
[1:10:00] like Joshua said choose you this day
[1:10:02] whom you're gonna serve Elisha said the
[1:10:04] same day are you going to serve the God
[1:10:05] in Israel or the gods of a land that's
[1:10:08] what that's what a Jezebel is doing
[1:10:09] today they're serving the God of fashion
[1:10:12] they're serving the God of Hollywood
[1:10:14] rather than the God of the Bible Jesus
[1:10:18] Amen in church I don't know about you
[1:10:22] but when God gives us a stern rebuke the
[1:10:25] elect can take it you can take a rebuke
[1:10:29] from God because you know God loves you
[1:10:31] and he's your father
[1:10:32] what did Jesus tell the men after after
[1:10:35] his resurrection oh you sweet disciples
[1:10:37] it's okay you didn't believe those women
[1:10:39] when they came to you
[1:10:40] you're such fine men you're so fine
[1:10:43] cultured and find rest you know you're
[1:10:45] so handsome meant he said Oh fools so to
[1:10:47] believe every word of God he called his
[1:10:50] own people fools but see did they get up
[1:10:54] and leave the church and say no I'm
[1:10:55] leaving ah you're too rough Jesus ear to
[1:10:57] rough Jesus said sit 70 has left me do
[1:11:00] you want to go to can you imagine if I
[1:11:03] said that tonight you guys will leave
[1:11:04] the church to go ahead there's the door
[1:11:07] that's what Jesus said
[1:11:09] jesus said if you want to go go ahead I
[1:11:12] know what God's called me to do and I'm
[1:11:14] gonna stand on the Word of God amen
[1:11:16] because every child of God can stand the
[1:11:18] test that God brings them a man they can
[1:11:21] stand the chastening of the Lord you see
[1:11:25] people don't consider that people don't
[1:11:27] consider these things that he was under
[1:11:29] the spirit of Elijah and Bible prophets
[1:11:32] don't play around with people they're
[1:11:35] sincere they're strict they're rough
[1:11:39] what would they have thought when
[1:11:41] Ezekiel I think it was his equal Isaiah
[1:11:43] give me a minute
[1:11:44] remember they laid on their sides naked
[1:11:46] for two years remember that let me get
[1:11:49] that real quick I think I could pull it
[1:11:51] up real quick by God's grace okay bear
[1:11:54] with me let me see if I can pull it up
[1:11:56] this will be a real blessing if I can
[1:11:59] pull this I'm looking for a note
[1:12:04] prophets were allegories yeah there it
[1:12:07] is okay glory Hosea okay God told Hosea
[1:12:13] to marry a harlot oh you see who the
[1:12:17] Prophet married he married that
[1:12:19] streetwalker and he calls himself a man
[1:12:23] of God I'm never going back to his
[1:12:25] church again
[1:12:28] and he's saying there and say I know it
[1:12:29] looks bad but God told me to do it
[1:12:31] I wonder who would left his church would
[1:12:34] you have left his church
[1:12:36] look at Isaiah Isaiah walked naked as a
[1:12:39] sign to for the coming Egyptians for
[1:12:42] three years so the king of Assyria led
[1:12:46] the Egyptians Brit led away the Egyptian
[1:12:48] prisoners and the Ethiopian captors
[1:12:50] young and old naked and barefoot even
[1:12:52] with their buttocks uncovered to the
[1:12:53] shame of Egypt how many you had followed
[1:12:55] Isaiah in his ministry oh I saw his
[1:12:59] bottom doctor honestly happened the
[1:13:04] prophets got his bottom hanging out
[1:13:06] mercy he's not being very modest and
[1:13:09] then people get upset a brother man
[1:13:10] takes his shirt off you see how we need
[1:13:14] God to wash our minds a little bit see
[1:13:17] how we need some patience in our hearts
[1:13:19] you know how you know it is true we need
[1:13:23] to put some things up on the Shelf
[1:13:24] before judging other people put it on
[1:13:27] the Shelf and say God just show me I'm
[1:13:29] not going to judge them I'm not the
[1:13:31] judge the Bible says I just have to
[1:13:33] judge myself amen authorities and then
[1:13:36] if we judge ourselves right then we'll
[1:13:38] judge angels at the white throne
[1:13:39] judgement amen well we got to judge
[1:13:41] ourselves first
[1:13:45] he said go loose the sack cloth from off
[1:13:49] thy loins the loins is the reproductive
[1:13:50] parts and put off thy shoe from thy foot
[1:13:53] and he did so walking naked and barefoot
[1:13:55] and the Lord said like as my servant
[1:13:57] Isaiah have walked naked and barefoot
[1:13:59] three years for a sign and I wonder upon
[1:14:01] Egypt in Ethiopia it was a sign God
[1:14:04] hadn't do it for a sign
[1:14:08] Ezekiel now look at this church talk
[1:14:10] about your diet how you want to eat
[1:14:13] healthy God commanded Zico to eat dung
[1:14:17] cakes in the sight of Israel because
[1:14:20] Israel would eat defiled bread among the
[1:14:22] Gentiles and be driven to the Gentiles
[1:14:28] thou shall eat it as barley cakes and
[1:14:31] thou shalt bake it with the dung that
[1:14:32] cometh out of a man so as Eko had to see
[1:14:35] a man go number two walk over there can
[1:14:37] you imagine this church grab it pack it
[1:14:40] with other stuff
[1:14:41] and eat it in the sight of all Israel
[1:14:44] well that prophet he really lost it
[1:14:46] today he was eaten dung
[1:14:50] can you imagine what his breath was like
[1:14:53] honestly and people criticize brother
[1:14:58] branham for saying mrs. dogmeat
[1:15:00] do you understand and these guys walked
[1:15:04] around with their bottoms hanging out
[1:15:05] eating dung and were also led with dust
[1:15:10] say at the Lord let's be careful how we
[1:15:12] judge things Church Berbera said I'll
[1:15:15] see that just the ideas of man how about
[1:15:17] this man I wonder what the doctor would
[1:15:19] think of this when a prophet in the
[1:15:20] Bible was command to strip off his
[1:15:21] clothes and walk naked before the people
[1:15:23] what would your doctor say about that he
[1:15:27] would really have been crazy what knee
[1:15:28] now God told us about the brand it's
[1:15:30] look away to Jesus but God told him to
[1:15:32] it
[1:15:32] another one had to lay on his side for
[1:15:34] 340 months or sorry so that's the one I
[1:15:37] couldn't find get a lay on the side for
[1:15:40] off to look that one up I believe was
[1:15:43] laying on his side and one through the
[1:15:44] other side and eat a pot of lentil that
[1:15:46] he made there and had to go and see this
[1:15:48] stuff and make it together eat it all at
[1:15:50] the time reach over get a handful eat it
[1:15:51] laying on a Sun oh how far people can
[1:15:54] get away really from the Word of God now
[1:15:56] listen we just get so educated till they
[1:15:59] educate themselves away from God I don't
[1:16:02] want education I want revelation and
[1:16:05] though the Word of God will always bring
[1:16:09] you and I revelation how me understand
[1:16:11] that amen so see we have all these
[1:16:14] critics that won't stand with brother
[1:16:16] Branham because of all their excuses
[1:16:18] when it comes down to it how do they
[1:16:20] know that God wasn't telling him to do
[1:16:22] that they don't know and it shows they
[1:16:25] don't know because they don't believe
[1:16:26] what he taught from the Bible amen
[1:16:30] I don't know does ever understand I
[1:16:33] don't mean to sound upset tonight I'm
[1:16:34] not mad at anybody I'm not upset with
[1:16:37] anybody here I'm not upset with anybody
[1:16:39] listening Elijah me I'm not gonna said
[1:16:40] with anybody but I want people to know
[1:16:42] they just don't wait on God they just
[1:16:44] people watching or whatever they don't
[1:16:46] pray long enough about it they're quick
[1:16:48] to judge they're quick to think they
[1:16:50] know everything about it instead of
[1:16:51] being humble we've got to humble
[1:16:53] ourselves on the side of
[1:16:54] and then got to lift us up God's known
[1:16:59] in simplicity by humility what's that
[1:17:00] Malkin
[1:17:02] okay Rita buddy glory amen all right
[1:17:16] give me I'll carry on father thank you
[1:17:17] sir that's all right look it up buddy
[1:17:18] yeah lore Ezekiel 44 okay praise the
[1:17:22] Lord
[1:17:22] that's right see people just don't
[1:17:25] understand God sometimes God does things
[1:17:27] out of the ordinary in order to disprove
[1:17:30] that the people that don't believe just
[1:17:32] to give him something to stumble over
[1:17:34] wasn't Jesus called the stone of
[1:17:36] stumbling how we know that he was called
[1:17:38] the rock of offense he was called the
[1:17:41] stone of stumbling Jesus was all rock
[1:17:43] but to the unbeliever he's a rock they
[1:17:45] stumble over I'm not gonna stumble over
[1:17:48] Jesus I'm gonna fall on Jesus that I get
[1:17:51] crushed a man that he can request me and
[1:17:53] make me a Moby there's a scripture on
[1:17:55] that now he's either gonna fall on you
[1:17:57] or you're gonna fall on him I want to
[1:17:58] fall on him I don't want him to crush me
[1:18:01] I would have fallen him I'll be crushed
[1:18:03] and he can make me over by God's grace I
[1:18:05] love area church I'm staying with
[1:18:07] brother branham you can I know you are
[1:18:09] too but I'm just telling to the people
[1:18:10] that might listen is they can stand with
[1:18:12] whatever they want but I'm standing with
[1:18:13] us saith the Lord from the Word of God
[1:18:15] now let's look at this I got a few more
[1:18:18] minutes here you know I never set my
[1:18:20] timer so forgive me I never said it
[1:18:23] forgive me okay I just said it for 15
[1:18:27] more minutes I'll try to go 15 or 20
[1:18:28] here and this is uh this is a thought I
[1:18:33] had recently probably last year I've
[1:18:36] just kind of been saving it my notes
[1:18:37] were waiting to preachers I'm gonna
[1:18:38] preach it tonight by God's grace is that
[1:18:39] okay
[1:18:40] it's your Bibles go to first Kings I
[1:18:42] think that's our first Scripture first
[1:18:44] Kings I believe it's chapter 20 if I'm
[1:18:45] not mistaken yes first Kings 22 rather
[1:18:52] chapter 22 first Kings chapter 22 I saw
[1:19:01] on Facebook and I appreciate all the
[1:19:03] brothers that on Facebook that always
[1:19:05] put out brother branham stuff now let me
[1:19:06] tell you I don't do that all the time I
[1:19:08] don't do that all the time because I'm a
[1:19:10] public I'm a public worker I'm a public
[1:19:13] schoolteacher and I've been to meetings
[1:19:15] with my Union and I have to be very
[1:19:17] careful what I put on social media I've
[1:19:21] been very careful because people could
[1:19:23] put they could they could screenshot
[1:19:25] some of my posts and they could place at
[1:19:26] other places and if it might seem
[1:19:29] offensive I could lose my job and you
[1:19:32] say well you don't have enough faith
[1:19:33] that's not true Daniel worked in the
[1:19:34] government of Babylon all those years
[1:19:36] and the church said so did Shadrach
[1:19:39] Meshach and Abednego they were
[1:19:41] government officials the whole time and
[1:19:43] they never lost their jobs so see they
[1:19:45] lived a separate life without blasting
[1:19:47] and condemning everybody so I'm just
[1:19:49] balancing my walk by the scripture when
[1:19:52] I put quotes on it that are more severe
[1:19:54] I put it you know I or more honest I say
[1:19:56] like that or more harsh I put them on
[1:19:57] our church's YouTube page I'm sorry
[1:19:59] Facebook page on now this is the first
[1:20:02] time this month this is the first time
[1:20:03] I've ever put any really thing about
[1:20:04] brother Branham I put a few things
[1:20:06] before but this month with our outreach
[1:20:08] meetings you know with our the the 2500
[1:20:11] postcards we sent out this is the first
[1:20:13] time I've really put things out there on
[1:20:15] my personal page and I'm trying to do it
[1:20:17] in wisdom without specifically stating
[1:20:19] it so someone who's really hungry will
[1:20:21] follow the link and then watch one of
[1:20:23] our sermons and this week I did get a
[1:20:26] message from one friend she's an older
[1:20:27] friend from the Copley area and she
[1:20:29] watched our sermon from Sunday night
[1:20:31] about thus saith the Lord for the future
[1:20:33] she said those are some compelling
[1:20:35] thoughts brother Jesse I said yes they
[1:20:37] are I said let me know if you have any
[1:20:39] questions but she said she and she said
[1:20:42] she's got to be in her 60s or 70s and
[1:20:44] she said you brother she said one thing
[1:20:46] you're right about Jesse is this nation
[1:20:47] is in decline spiritually so she's seen
[1:20:50] it her whole life you know she's 70
[1:20:51] years old she's seen the decline of the
[1:20:53] nation so she can't deny that now let's
[1:20:55] see if God doesn't let's see if God will
[1:20:57] draw her in or I'm sorry if she'll
[1:20:59] listen to God's drawing because we can't
[1:21:02] do it ourselves we have to let the Lord
[1:21:04] do it anyways I got this whole thought
[1:21:06] right here from a meme and I'll show it
[1:21:08] to you at the end of the service here
[1:21:09] and which should we just be hope
[1:21:10] hopefully a few more minutes now God
[1:21:12] gave brother brand the most Bible base
[1:21:14] minister
[1:21:15] any man I've ever seen in my lifetime
[1:21:19] here's what I mean look at this let's go
[1:21:23] with each one a time like job God talked
[1:21:26] to brother Branham in a whirlwind who do
[1:21:31] you know on TV or who do you know in
[1:21:34] your denomination
[1:21:35] that talked to God in a whirlwind I
[1:21:38] don't know anybody that never talked to
[1:21:40] God no ruin but if you go to job 42 God
[1:21:44] speaks to job out of a whirlwind and the
[1:21:47] first time but brother Graham saw the
[1:21:50] whirlwind voice told me six years old he
[1:21:52] said don't you ever smoke drink or chew
[1:21:54] her to fire body anyway there'll be a
[1:21:56] work for you to do when you get older
[1:21:57] amen
[1:22:00] who is more Bible base than William
[1:22:03] Branham I've never seen anyone who's
[1:22:04] more Bible based than William Branham
[1:22:05] and my testimony was when I preach
[1:22:07] brother Graham sermon in South America I
[1:22:09] cast out devils just the way Jesus
[1:22:12] Christ did I'd pray for them and they
[1:22:16] let out a scream like they were dying
[1:22:17] they'd fight and they were foaming
[1:22:18] they'd scream and they fall down like
[1:22:20] they were dead and I waited a few
[1:22:22] minutes pray over me and they'd raise up
[1:22:23] and me deliver to the name of Jesus
[1:22:24] Christ that's when I knew that was 2010
[1:22:27] that's when I knew more for sure that
[1:22:30] this message was absolutely right and of
[1:22:32] course I knew it before that but that's
[1:22:34] when I saw the god of this message amen
[1:22:37] the very same God of the Bible did the
[1:22:40] same things in the Bible in my life and
[1:22:42] they had to better their to knock on my
[1:22:44] door to get me out of my my pajamas to
[1:22:46] come out there and cast the devil out I
[1:22:48] was already my pajamas ready to go to
[1:22:50] bed that night I'd preach that day and
[1:22:53] they said come out here that he got
[1:22:54] Devils in a mic oh my lord have mercy I
[1:22:56] gotta cast out Devils today I tried
[1:22:58] before it didn't work because I didn't
[1:22:59] have enough faith but at that time my
[1:23:01] faith rose and I saw the very same God
[1:23:04] of the Bible operate and it's just a
[1:23:06] humble little setting just like he did
[1:23:08] in 2000 years ago he did it the same way
[1:23:10] in 2010 and he's the same today in 2018
[1:23:13] amen
[1:23:14] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:23:16] forever like MO
[1:23:19] the pillar of fire led him so much so
[1:23:21] that brother Ram got a picture taken
[1:23:23] with the pillar of fire and George J
[1:23:25] Lacey said light actually struck the
[1:23:28] lens it was a literal light also this is
[1:23:33] beautiful you know this man God gave
[1:23:35] brother Branham two signs to get the
[1:23:37] people to believe just like God gave
[1:23:38] Moses two signs
[1:23:41] so he's like job and he's like Moses so
[1:23:44] far oh my brother bear had the sign in
[1:23:48] his hand the bumps and there's numerous
[1:23:50] people you can watch on youtube if you
[1:23:51] want some links I'll shared you they
[1:23:53] actually saw them they saw the bumps on
[1:23:55] mother man's hands road man would pray
[1:23:57] for them they see the bumps and he pray
[1:23:59] for them and they behold again and the
[1:24:01] bumps would be gone this is legitimate
[1:24:03] this is actually a gift from God just
[1:24:05] like Moses because remember Moses could
[1:24:07] stick his hand in it come out leprous he
[1:24:09] could stick his hand in and it come out
[1:24:11] wide his snow right and then he put it
[1:24:13] back in and come out normal he had a
[1:24:15] gift in his hand so did our prophet have
[1:24:17] a gift in his hand that's right and then
[1:24:21] of course you know the second pole the
[1:24:22] first pole was the gift in the hand the
[1:24:24] second pole was the discernment which we
[1:24:25] know and love and I've met people that
[1:24:27] have gone through discernment lines and
[1:24:28] God discerned their hearts like sister
[1:24:30] Humes from North Carolina now she passed
[1:24:34] away but I showed the video I showed the
[1:24:36] picture a few weeks ago at our first
[1:24:38] July first outreach now he got your
[1:24:41] Bibles first Kings 22 verse 7 like my
[1:24:46] kaya brother Branham was reviled by the
[1:24:50] clergy let's see how the clergy reviled
[1:24:54] him now I don't think brother man was
[1:24:55] ever beaten up like micaiah was micaiah
[1:24:57] was slapped in the face and thrown in a
[1:24:59] dungeon
[1:24:59] I don't think brother bear I've ever had
[1:25:01] to go through that but they did revile
[1:25:03] him and they tried they try to set traps
[1:25:05] for brother Branham ok 22 7 now I don't
[1:25:11] want to read it because my voice but I'm
[1:25:13] gonna read it because the people were
[1:25:14] livestream and say they can't hear you
[1:25:15] when you read it so now I'm stuck I got
[1:25:17] to read it that's ok
[1:25:19] verse 7 and Jehoshaphat said is there
[1:25:21] not you're a prophet of the Lord
[1:25:23] besides that we might inquire of him
[1:25:24] remember hey I want to go up to
[1:25:26] ramoth-gilead and take God's land back
[1:25:28] but it wasn't the time and season and
[1:25:30] Joseph s like well 400 prophets are
[1:25:33] saying yeah
[1:25:34] isn't there one more and that shows
[1:25:36] there's a truth there's got to be a true
[1:25:38] discernment in a real believer to know
[1:25:39] that a true believer can recognize false
[1:25:41] prophets versus a true prophet
[1:25:43] hey honey that's right you could go to
[1:25:46] churches that you always felt
[1:25:47] something's missing there's got to be
[1:25:49] more there's got to be some other
[1:25:50] preacher who's preaching about Jesus
[1:25:52] Christ who's more right than these
[1:25:54] fellas amen oh I hope I'm one of them
[1:25:56] amen I believe I am by God's grace I
[1:25:58] always knew there was something you know
[1:26:00] when I went to the president's hearing
[1:26:01] church I always knew there was more the
[1:26:03] Pentecostal church I knew there was more
[1:26:05] and the last time I was listening to
[1:26:07] Baptist John Piper I loved it but I knew
[1:26:09] there was more and then came the message
[1:26:11] amen and it proves right here a real
[1:26:14] believer can recognize there's got to be
[1:26:15] more to this and the king of Israel said
[1:26:20] unto Joseph at yet there is yet one man
[1:26:23] mark I the son of imlah
[1:26:24] by whom we may inquire Lord but I hate
[1:26:26] him I hate that prophet oh my for he
[1:26:32] does not prophesy good concerning me but
[1:26:34] evil I wonder how many people have left
[1:26:36] this shirt saying I hate brother Jesse
[1:26:38] well they don't even call me brother but
[1:26:40] I hate the way he preaches that's okay
[1:26:44] because they're entitled to what they
[1:26:46] want to believe but if you're gonna
[1:26:47] stand on God's side you got to be
[1:26:48] rejected and persecuted you have to be
[1:26:51] spoken evil against if you're gonna be
[1:26:52] on God's side that's okay don't bother
[1:26:55] me and your host Matt said let not the
[1:26:57] king say so please like all your little
[1:27:00] rough you got a rough spirit there a hab
[1:27:02] now you know the story let's go down to
[1:27:04] verse let's go to verse 13 and the
[1:27:13] messenger that was gone to Mike I spake
[1:27:14] at him saying behold now the words of
[1:27:16] the prophets declare good under the king
[1:27:17] with one mouth let not word I pray they
[1:27:19] be like the word of one of them and
[1:27:21] speak which good talk about peer
[1:27:22] pressure the preachers are the king
[1:27:26] saying come on all 400 I've said good
[1:27:28] can't you just say something good about
[1:27:30] me can't you just give me something good
[1:27:32] thus saith the Lord for me what do you
[1:27:35] think it's not a real mount a real man
[1:27:37] of God will never give in to peer
[1:27:39] pressure no matter how many people you
[1:27:41] say well you should preach this or you
[1:27:43] should do this or you should do that or
[1:27:44] you should change your tune on this or
[1:27:46] you should
[1:27:46] your tune on that a real man of God
[1:27:48] stays with us saith the Lord amen he
[1:27:51] ain't gonna compromise one bit on thus
[1:27:53] saith the Lord so glad we have thus
[1:27:56] saith the Lord today
[1:27:57] thank you Jesus and Mike I said verse 14
[1:28:01] as the Lord liveth what's that what the
[1:28:03] Lord saith unto me that way I speak now
[1:28:07] you know that you know what he says he
[1:28:10] kind of gives him a little Johnny look
[1:28:11] how he jokes in verse 15 so came the
[1:28:13] king and the King said I didn't Micmac I
[1:28:15] shall we go up against ramoth-gilead to
[1:28:17] battle sherry forbear and the answer go
[1:28:19] and prosper for this Lord shall deliver
[1:28:20] in the hand of the king
[1:28:21] did you realize he's joking right there
[1:28:23] do you realize he's being sarcastic
[1:28:25] right there does it sound familiar like
[1:28:28] Elijah being sarcastic with the prophets
[1:28:30] of bale Mount Carmel brother branham
[1:28:33] being a little sarcastic about the dog
[1:28:34] meat and everything like that kind of
[1:28:36] mocking them do you see that he's this
[1:28:39] prophet is anointed and he's so filled
[1:28:41] with the spirit that he's bringing a
[1:28:43] rebuke upon the false believers and God
[1:28:46] never had him apologize and I never
[1:28:49] heard brother Branham apologize for
[1:28:51] those statements either
[1:28:51] Oh God open up our understanding praise
[1:28:56] the Lord look at the King said in verse
[1:28:59] 16 how many times should I journey that
[1:29:02] thou tell me nothing but that which is
[1:29:03] true in the name of the Lord and he said
[1:29:07] I saw all Israel scattered upon the
[1:29:10] hills as sheep that happen to have not a
[1:29:12] shepherd and the Lord said these have no
[1:29:14] masters so there now he's telling the
[1:29:15] King basically you're not even a
[1:29:17] shepherd to these people you're going to
[1:29:19] be killed and they're going to all your
[1:29:21] people are going to be scattered they're
[1:29:22] not gonna have a king and look at verse
[1:29:25] 18 and the King said unto Joseph did not
[1:29:27] I tell you that I was prophesied no gird
[1:29:29] concerning but evil didn't I tell you
[1:29:32] this Holy Roller preacher always balls
[1:29:34] me out for my sin didn't I tell you he's
[1:29:36] always against me this preachers always
[1:29:38] preaching against my sin he ought to
[1:29:40] preach against their said he was a
[1:29:41] murderer praise God
[1:29:44] he let Jezebel get away with murder so
[1:29:46] that means he accepted murder he's got a
[1:29:49] murdering spirit on him so God let God
[1:29:54] lets him get mocked God
[1:29:57] a little sarcasm because all the evil
[1:30:01] he's done by now they ask him and they
[1:30:08] say who's gonna persuade and that oh I'm
[1:30:11] sorry Micaiah says he saw the vision and
[1:30:12] the Lord said I need a spirit to
[1:30:14] persuade a have to go to Mount Gilead
[1:30:15] and on lying spirit came up and the Lord
[1:30:17] said yes you can go and deceive
[1:30:19] hey hab now look what the Bible said
[1:30:22] look at the Bible said verse 23 now
[1:30:26] therefore behold the Lord hath put a
[1:30:27] lying sphere in the mouth of all these
[1:30:28] prophets and the Lord has spoken evil
[1:30:30] concerning thee so what he's basically
[1:30:32] doing he said you you're preachers are a
[1:30:33] bunch of liars
[1:30:35] you're preachers are saying it's okay to
[1:30:37] baptize in the father son Holy Ghost
[1:30:38] bunch of liars that kind of hits home
[1:30:42] doesn't it oh you're preachers say it's
[1:30:45] okay for women to wear pants and cross
[1:30:48] dress like men bunch of liars that's
[1:30:51] rough but that's what the Spirit of God
[1:30:54] then did then did then at that time and
[1:30:56] that's we didn't brother Brandon's
[1:30:57] ministry and that's what the Spirit of
[1:30:59] God will always do it'll always declare
[1:31:01] truth from a lie now look how they
[1:31:04] treated him Church look at verse 24 but
[1:31:09] Zedekiah the son of jamya went near and
[1:31:12] smoke Mike ayah on the cheek and said
[1:31:14] which way went the spear Lord from me to
[1:31:17] speak unto thee and macaé said behold
[1:31:19] thou shalt see in that day when thou
[1:31:21] shalt go into inner chamber to hide
[1:31:23] thyself look at verse 28 Mike I said
[1:31:25] have valerie turn it on peace the Lord
[1:31:27] hath not spoken by me that man knew
[1:31:30] where he was standing with God and the
[1:31:31] church said now let me read you a quote
[1:31:34] where brother Branham so see Mike I was
[1:31:35] reviled let me read you a quote where
[1:31:37] brother Branham was reviled I think I
[1:31:39] copied it right here yeah this is from
[1:31:44] is your life where the gospel how many
[1:31:45] ever listen to that one that's one of my
[1:31:47] favorite sermons when I first came in
[1:31:48] the message brother Ram said he was
[1:31:50] going miss Chicago and 300 preachers
[1:31:53] were sitting there and the Lord told me
[1:31:55] that night what they was going to do
[1:31:56] they had a trap set for me 300 against
[1:32:00] one ha ha ha I wonder who's gonna win
[1:32:03] now look it's just in the scripture they
[1:32:05] had 400 against one ah is it it's just
[1:32:09] it's just like it's like a type right
[1:32:11] just like how Joseph was sold for 20 and
[1:32:13] Jesus thirty pieces of silver it's not
[1:32:16] exactly but it's very similar the same
[1:32:17] thing here
[1:32:18] 300 verse 1 400 verse 1 God toys in the
[1:32:21] minority but with God where the majority
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:25] where the majority when we stand with
[1:32:27] dust saith the Lord
[1:32:28] Oh hallelujah he said me go over there I
[1:32:32] went up and told brother Carlos and I
[1:32:34] said you'll not have it in that hotel
[1:32:36] you'll have to take it to another place
[1:32:37] it'll be a green room and they have a
[1:32:39] trap set for me haven't they brother
[1:32:41] Carlson and he dropped his head he sat
[1:32:44] there in my office a few days ago come
[1:32:46] from Chicago meaning I said I'll never
[1:32:48] forget that brother branham and that's
[1:32:50] how Perry green church where's that book
[1:32:52] that's how Peregrine eventually realized
[1:32:54] he was the prophet Elijah because
[1:32:56] brother Brandon discerned his harsh so
[1:32:58] many times he tells it in this book he
[1:33:00] said he said after that last time he
[1:33:01] said he said you got he said I perceive
[1:33:04] you're a prophet and I perceive you have
[1:33:06] the spirit of Elijah and brother man
[1:33:08] said why don't go broadcasting that he
[1:33:09] said but that's the truth that's what I
[1:33:14] said to God God revealed every every
[1:33:16] truth to me reveal every minister to me
[1:33:18] reveal every true call of God person I
[1:33:21] want to know because I want to be led by
[1:33:23] the Holy Spirit amen
[1:33:24] I wouldn't know what God is doing today
[1:33:26] amen amen now we know he's not gonna be
[1:33:29] a major profit today but what I'm saying
[1:33:31] is God reveal who your people are reveal
[1:33:33] who the true saints of God are in this
[1:33:35] hour there's my 15 minutes man and I
[1:33:43] said brother
[1:33:43] why won't you speak he said I couldn't
[1:33:45] do it he said I thought you said you'd
[1:33:51] do me a favor and I said last night the
[1:33:54] Lord told me you're going down there
[1:33:56] today and you will find out you're not
[1:33:57] going to get that building you're going
[1:33:59] to another building dr. Meade will be
[1:34:01] set in this side that colored man his
[1:34:02] wife that sings will be sitting right
[1:34:04] here and so forth whether I'll be
[1:34:05] sitting I said there'll be a Buddha
[1:34:07] priest there and I said now find out
[1:34:09] they got it against me because I
[1:34:10] preached the water baptism in the name
[1:34:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ ray and they
[1:34:16] got against me because I preached the
[1:34:17] Serpent's seed did I tell you I had
[1:34:20] somebody a few weeks ago send me a text
[1:34:22] from overseas and they said I watched
[1:34:24] your video on the serpent seen in the it
[1:34:25] says they said that was one of the
[1:34:27] greatest videos I've ever watched in my
[1:34:28] life I know about you Church but that
[1:34:32] does something to me when God can take
[1:34:34] his word and use me to present something
[1:34:36] that literally changes a person's life
[1:34:38] where they can see the truth of God so
[1:34:40] clear it's one of the greatest
[1:34:42] revelations they received in their life
[1:34:43] I just say Lord let me be humble just
[1:34:46] keep using me open more blind eyes that
[1:34:49] they can walk in the truth of the word
[1:34:50] of God amen
[1:34:54] they got it against me because the
[1:34:56] evidence is not speaking with tongues he
[1:34:59] says and I said come down and watch God
[1:35:02] 300 against one he said I got in there
[1:35:06] they went down there and the very two
[1:35:08] hours from then or better at the same
[1:35:10] time that afternoon they called her
[1:35:11] brother Carlson he said that guy that
[1:35:13] let them have that room they paid a down
[1:35:15] payment on it we have to cancel because
[1:35:17] the manager said he'd already promised
[1:35:18] it to a band for that night and they
[1:35:20] couldn't have it in the room the first
[1:35:22] room so he went out of town and he said
[1:35:25] he went out to the town and country
[1:35:26] hotel and that morning we got in there
[1:35:28] and stood there and brother Carlson said
[1:35:29] there's one thing he's so he standing
[1:35:31] before all these ministers and brother
[1:35:32] Carlson says there's one thing you
[1:35:35] brother might disagree with brother
[1:35:36] branham but he's not scared to say what
[1:35:39] he believes he told me these things
[1:35:42] would happen just exactly the way they
[1:35:44] are now here he is let him speak for
[1:35:46] himself and brother man said he took the
[1:35:48] scripture from the book of Acts where
[1:35:49] Paul said I was not disobedient to the
[1:35:52] heavenly vision oh my
[1:35:56] and I said you've got it in for me for a
[1:35:59] lot of baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:36:00] Christ
[1:36:01] better than 300 of you introduce
[1:36:03] yourself as dr. so-and-so and dr.
[1:36:04] so-and-so and I said I haven't even got
[1:36:07] a grammar school education but I
[1:36:09] challenge any man here to bring your
[1:36:11] Bible and stand here by my side and deny
[1:36:14] that one of those words about baptism
[1:36:16] and Surrency and deny one of them that's
[1:36:18] been ever said amen holiday left and he
[1:36:22] says you got it on me here he said I got
[1:36:24] it on tape if you want to hear it he
[1:36:26] said that was the quietest crowd you
[1:36:28] ever heard hallelujah that's how it is
[1:36:34] today when I talked to people or you
[1:36:36] know either text them were talking about
[1:36:38] the Word of God like I told my friends a
[1:36:40] few weeks ago about women preachers I
[1:36:43] said show me I said I just made a video
[1:36:46] how women are not to preach the gospel
[1:36:47] and I'm sorry about high heels and I
[1:36:51] said I just made a video about high
[1:36:53] heels and how they're not in the Bible
[1:36:54] and that's the quietest group of
[1:36:56] brothers you ever heard they wait a few
[1:36:59] seconds they change the subject
[1:37:02] see that nothing they don't have any
[1:37:04] Word of God they don't have any truth to
[1:37:06] show them that it's okay to for a woman
[1:37:09] to press herself out like that in a
[1:37:10] sexual manner they don't have any truth
[1:37:12] but we've got the Spirit of Truth amen
[1:37:15] and it only shuts the mouth of the devil
[1:37:17] hallelujah he said that was a quietest
[1:37:22] crowd you ever heard three hundred the
[1:37:24] quietest preachers you ever heard oh
[1:37:27] thank you Jesus but I said what's the
[1:37:29] matter is there anybody here tonight was
[1:37:31] in that morning meeting let's see hold
[1:37:32] your hand well sure he said then if you
[1:37:35] can't support it then get off my back
[1:37:40] all right he said there's a lot of
[1:37:42] hollering when they're around the corner
[1:37:45] but come face-to-face with the issue
[1:37:48] it's different he said then men walked
[1:37:50] out of the preaching they'll say a lot
[1:37:54] of things behind your back that they
[1:37:55] won't say in front of her face Tommy
[1:38:00] Hicks
[1:38:01] now here's one man and watch this one of
[1:38:02] the men stand up and say I want 300 of
[1:38:04] those tapes so every and I'll send it to
[1:38:07] every Pretender Trinitarian preacher I
[1:38:10] know of he said some of them men were
[1:38:12] shaking my hands they will come down
[1:38:13] there Jeffersonville and be baptized and
[1:38:15] brother BAM said now says in 63 where
[1:38:18] are they at
[1:38:20] he said they all made excuses and said I
[1:38:22] can't do it my denomination won't let me
[1:38:26] do it and brother BAM said that's just
[1:38:27] what Jesus said
[1:38:28] I married a wife and I can't come to the
[1:38:31] wedding supper
[1:38:31] I bought a yoke of oxen and I bought a
[1:38:35] piece of ground I've got to go look at
[1:38:37] it he said is that a life that's worthy
[1:38:41] of the gospel 300 men say I'll be
[1:38:45] baptized give me some of those tapes I
[1:38:47] want to hear the message and not one of
[1:38:49] them came down to be baptized can't you
[1:38:52] see how the Bible said Liars will not
[1:38:54] inherit the kingdom of God I'll be
[1:38:58] baptized in Jesus Christ I believe you
[1:38:59] ah I believe God's will in person I'll
[1:39:02] believe I'll meet I'll come to your
[1:39:03] church service I've had so many people
[1:39:04] tell me they're gonna come to my church
[1:39:06] and they never come to our church I
[1:39:07] wonder if they're gonna answer on the
[1:39:08] day of judgment is that a life that's
[1:39:11] worthy the gospel when all you're doing
[1:39:14] is sharing the love of Jesus Christ and
[1:39:15] the Word of God and the revelations of
[1:39:16] the Bible is that our life that's where
[1:39:18] the gospel it's not and the church said
[1:39:22] let me try to finish here my boy it just
[1:39:25] gets good I get all excited and get all
[1:39:26] stirred up and I don't want to quit I'm
[1:39:28] gonna pay for it tomorrow
[1:39:30] now I love this look at this man like
[1:39:33] Elijah he's a man of the earnest he
[1:39:35] rebuked the modern-day Jezebel and Ahab
[1:39:37] my own brother have said that Jezebel
[1:39:38] was the Roman Catholic Church now his
[1:39:42] you know Kennedy's wife Jacqueline she
[1:39:44] was a bad influence but brother man
[1:39:46] never says she was Jezebel the quotes
[1:39:48] I've read say that the Roman Catholic
[1:39:50] Church was the Jezebel behind the Ahab
[1:39:52] of JFK are you with me but of course she
[1:39:56] did influence you know Jacqueline
[1:39:57] Kennedy did influence the nation in the
[1:39:58] wrong way but I can't find a quote where
[1:40:00] he literally said that sober man said
[1:40:03] Elijah rebuked man-made religions and
[1:40:05] immoral women and they both spoke with
[1:40:07] thus saith the Lord like Jeremiah he
[1:40:11] wanted to quit preaching brother I
[1:40:13] remember said he had a complex
[1:40:14] standing in the gap he says I'm just
[1:40:16] gonna go up the wilderness I'll take my
[1:40:17] wife up there and I'll just stop down
[1:40:19] here when I got thus saith the Lord he
[1:40:20] was gonna quit preaching but the Bible
[1:40:24] said in Jeremiah Jeremiah said the same
[1:40:26] thing
[1:40:26] let's read it Jeremiah 20 verse 9 and
[1:40:31] I've always said this until you're in
[1:40:33] jail and you feel like quitting being a
[1:40:37] Christian until you're in jail you
[1:40:38] shouldn't really use this phrase oh it
[1:40:40] was like fire shut up in my bones and
[1:40:42] then the next day you're all discouraged
[1:40:44] and bent out of shape about something
[1:40:46] Jeremiah said I had fire shut up in my
[1:40:49] bones after I'd spent months in prison
[1:40:52] so let's be careful how we use that and
[1:40:55] the church said if you got fire your
[1:40:58] bones let's see some real fire and let's
[1:40:59] see some Holy Ghost fire not up one net
[1:41:02] in one week and next week you're down
[1:41:03] well where is the sister where's the
[1:41:05] brother it's Church time it's time to
[1:41:07] pray where they at where's the fire in
[1:41:08] their bones now is that right keep yeah
[1:41:13] that's why you got to keep the fire
[1:41:14] going at your house you get a fire here
[1:41:17] you got a fire they're gonna fire the
[1:41:19] Word of God
[1:41:20] keep the fire burnin in your prayer
[1:41:22] closet amen it's exactly right I've
[1:41:27] never said that all the fire show up in
[1:41:28] my bones I never said that because I
[1:41:30] think it's a little irreverent I think
[1:41:31] it's without understanding Jeremiah
[1:41:34] 20 verse 9 then said I then said I will
[1:41:40] not make mention of him nor speak any
[1:41:41] more in his name but his word was in my
[1:41:43] heart as a burning fire shut up in my
[1:41:44] bones and I was weary with forbearing
[1:41:46] and I could not stay now look at verse 2
[1:41:50] look he just got smacked in the face and
[1:41:51] put in stocks look at this then pastor
[1:41:54] smoked Jeremiah the Prophet and put him
[1:41:55] in the stocks that were in the high gate
[1:41:58] of Benjamin which was by the house of
[1:41:59] the Lord so not only did Mike I get
[1:42:02] slapped
[1:42:02] of course Jesus too but Jeremiah did too
[1:42:06] and then he feels like quit and given up
[1:42:08] and then God sends a holy anointing he
[1:42:11] feels fiery so that's okay I'll keep
[1:42:12] preaching I'm not ready to give up
[1:42:14] I've been smacked in the face I've been
[1:42:16] thrown into prison I feel like quit but
[1:42:18] all of a sudden I got the anointing now
[1:42:19] when you go through that let me know
[1:42:21] then you can say I got fire in my bones
[1:42:23] but if you if we can't witness and we
[1:42:26] can't pray for more than five minutes
[1:42:27] that we can't
[1:42:28] have more of the Spirit of God let's be
[1:42:30] sound on that let's first get it and
[1:42:32] then let's talk about it after that
[1:42:33] let's first get the fire keep the fire
[1:42:36] burning and then let's talk about a fire
[1:42:38] shut up in my bones
[1:42:39] that's always a certain sermon or
[1:42:42] thought I like to inject because I think
[1:42:45] people just throw it around the wrong
[1:42:46] way
[1:42:47] this man was beaten and accused and
[1:42:50] persecuted all right
[1:42:53] like Daniel he saw the visions of the
[1:42:55] future they both saw the end of the
[1:42:58] Gentile dispensation
[1:43:01] Daniel saw Daniel chapter 2 with the
[1:43:04] image of Nebuchadnezzar brother Branham
[1:43:06] saw in the seven major visions on an
[1:43:09] area both prophet saw at the end of the
[1:43:12] Gentile dispensation amen glory so can
[1:43:16] we just review real quick
[1:43:18] he's like Joe Moses mkhaya Elijah
[1:43:20] Jeremiah Daniel which preacher do know
[1:43:22] is like that I don't know any preacher
[1:43:24] that's like that like David he fought
[1:43:26] against the religious Goliath of the day
[1:43:28] brother Branham had the vision of the
[1:43:30] man with a three-headed club and
[1:43:32] defeated it with the Word of God
[1:43:34] remember that mission he said the man
[1:43:37] kept beating down the woman as soon as
[1:43:38] the woman rise up with the baptism that
[1:43:40] 3-headed club would beat her down no
[1:43:42] it's Trinity it's late person three
[1:43:43] person and brother and finally said he
[1:43:45] got the nerve up and when he spoke the
[1:43:47] name of Jesus that man got small small
[1:43:49] small see brother been defeated the
[1:43:51] Goliath of his day and Samson hey
[1:43:53] preached it when he was here he said
[1:43:55] what did he said what did
[1:43:57] what sort of David use to defeat Goliath
[1:44:00] he said Goliath own sword
[1:44:02] what sore did brother random use to
[1:44:05] defeat the trench hands the very sword
[1:44:07] they were holding the Word of God amen
[1:44:10] hallelujah see they're holding the Word
[1:44:12] of God saying it's father so he goes
[1:44:14] program takes that sort and chops off
[1:44:16] that Trinitarian head amen
[1:44:18] glories the Goliath of his day haha I
[1:44:21] like that praise God because he was
[1:44:24] holding the word hallelujah what are you
[1:44:26] holding tonight we're holding the Word
[1:44:28] of God amen the sword is the Word of God
[1:44:34] like Isaiah bar BAM saw angels but
[1:44:36] Bertram saw the angel of the Lord Isaiah
[1:44:40] saw seraphim's now there may be other
[1:44:41] visions I could forget brother BAM saw
[1:44:43] numerous angels it could have been well
[1:44:45] he saw the seven angels there you go
[1:44:46] amen
[1:44:47] how did they appraised it hard he saw
[1:44:49] the seven angels and there's probably
[1:44:52] more like Jonah brother BAM tried to run
[1:44:55] from the Lord due to his mother's law
[1:44:56] his mother-in-law's influence he ran
[1:44:59] from the commission all those
[1:45:00] invitations to do evangelistic work he
[1:45:02] ran from he ran from his commission I
[1:45:05] have a quote brother BAM or Church I
[1:45:08] have a quote where brother BAM said he
[1:45:09] was in the shoes of Balaam did you know
[1:45:12] he said that it's unlikely I think it's
[1:45:14] like in 1953 at one time in brother hams
[1:45:17] ministry he was telling the people bring
[1:45:20] the hardest cases bring the hardest
[1:45:22] miracles and I'm praying for them first
[1:45:24] and brother BAM said that was being in
[1:45:27] the seat of Balaam because he said he
[1:45:29] was trying to get attention he was
[1:45:31] trying to produce attention and proved
[1:45:32] everybody how great God was and he said
[1:45:34] he was going about it the wrong way and
[1:45:37] programs because he was using a gift the
[1:45:45] wrong way see how important it is that
[1:45:48] we use God's gift for the right way like
[1:45:54] Paul Moses but this is what one brother
[1:45:56] Branham preached I think it was a
[1:45:57] marriage in divorce just like Paul Moses
[1:46:00] brother Branham was sent to the desert
[1:46:02] in 1963 to receive instruction from the
[1:46:05] Lord Moses received the law in the
[1:46:07] desert Paul received the New Testament
[1:46:10] the desert brother Brandon received the
[1:46:14] restoration of what Paul had plus the
[1:46:17] revelation of what Paul had not heard
[1:46:19] yet which was the book of Revelation and
[1:46:21] the writings of st. John the Revelator
[1:46:23] and the church said all right we have a
[1:46:28] modern-day prophet that's visited to
[1:46:31] this age and like Saint Paul this is the
[1:46:34] one we read Sunday he preached long and
[1:46:36] a man died but then he prayed the prayer
[1:46:38] of faith and the man rose up and
[1:46:40] received his life back Paul preached one
[1:46:43] time all night unica's fell out of the
[1:46:45] window he went down and prayed for him
[1:46:47] the Bible said life came back into them
[1:46:49] they lifted him up same thing happened
[1:46:51] in June of 1963 like John the Baptist's
[1:46:56] brother Ram had the spirit of Elijah was
[1:46:58] a man of the wilderness and saw visions
[1:46:59] John saw the Spirit descend a remain of
[1:47:01] Christ
[1:47:01] both men were forerunners of Jesus
[1:47:04] Christ Oh hallelujah let's stand to our
[1:47:07] feet I'm gonna have to close I better
[1:47:09] stop here I'm already an hour and 15
[1:47:14] minutes that's longer I wanted to preach
[1:47:15] like Saint Peter brother random baptize
[1:47:18] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:47:20] remission of sins and preached the
[1:47:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost here's the
[1:47:26] last - I got two more slides again any
[1:47:30] other preacher was Billy Graham doing
[1:47:31] all this do all this any preacher TD
[1:47:38] jakes does he do this no one Josey no
[1:47:42] none of them do this and that's fine
[1:47:45] they can only do it that was what the
[1:47:46] gifts they've been given but our prophet
[1:47:48] had the gifts of God like John the
[1:47:52] Revelator brother random saw the opening
[1:47:54] of the seven seals now remember John saw
[1:47:56] the symbols and he heard what the
[1:47:58] thunders uttered the thunders were the
[1:47:59] voice of God uttering the seven thunders
[1:48:01] were the revelations of the seven seals
[1:48:03] but John was forbidden to write them
[1:48:06] brother branham though received the
[1:48:08] revelation of them along with the timing
[1:48:11] of them in other words he said when the
[1:48:13] first seal took place the second third
[1:48:16] fourth he told us when they all took
[1:48:18] place so he received the reality form as
[1:48:20] well and was even allowed to preach them
[1:48:23] John wasn't allowed to ride him brother
[1:48:25] branham was allowed to preach them amen
[1:48:28] hallelujah thank you lord like John the
[1:48:33] like Moses Elijah Christ
[1:48:36] yeah the Holy Ghost anointing him in
[1:48:37] manifestation did you ever hear this
[1:48:40] quote brother Branham said did you know
[1:48:44] brother man had the spirit of Moses on
[1:48:46] him Elijah and Christ today I know that
[1:48:50] let me review the quote Church this is
[1:48:53] not Maya this is saith the Lord romances
[1:48:56] in December 4 1960 the revelation of
[1:48:58] Jesus Christ he talks about a women
[1:49:01] we've prophesied numerous times over him
[1:49:03] and she said and then before she could
[1:49:06] say anything the Holy Spirit give the
[1:49:07] interpretation and said thus at the Lord
[1:49:09] within three months there would be the
[1:49:11] spirit of Moses Elijah and Christ
[1:49:14] ministering in this bram tabernacle and
[1:49:16] there it happened perfectly now is that
[1:49:19] the scripture or not can the spirit of
[1:49:22] Elijah go on other people yes or no
[1:49:24] turkey yeah can the spirit of Moses gone
[1:49:28] people yeah remember the Bible said God
[1:49:31] said the spirit of Moses of Moses and
[1:49:34] put it on seventy other people and of
[1:49:38] course if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:49:39] you've got the Spirit of Christ amen
[1:49:42] hallelujah brother man says thus saith
[1:49:45] the Lord the spirit of Elijah Moses and
[1:49:48] Jesus Christ will minister from band
[1:49:50] Tabernacle within three months and he
[1:49:52] said it was thus saith the Lord had
[1:49:53] happened Oh hallelujah brother and I
[1:49:56] feel like shouting hey not in the Yellow
[1:49:59] Sea God can take that Holy Spirit with
[1:50:02] the characteristics and put it on
[1:50:03] another man for the purpose that God
[1:50:05] wants to fulfill now the very last one I
[1:50:08] saved the best for last because who do
[1:50:12] you love best Moses or Jesus Jesus
[1:50:15] Jeremiah or Jesus who do you love most
[1:50:17] the Lord Jesus like the Lord Jesus
[1:50:21] Christ brother Branham discerned the
[1:50:24] thoughts and intents of the heart Jesus
[1:50:27] was the son of man notice I capitalized
[1:50:29] that brother Branham was just a minor
[1:50:33] lower son of man don't worship brother
[1:50:36] Branham and call him Jesus he wasn't in
[1:50:38] Jesus he manifested the spirit of Jesus
[1:50:41] what them okay my oh my battery's dead
[1:50:45] okay this for the live streamers not
[1:50:48] because I want to be heard I don't like
[1:50:49] to hear my voice anyway so the live
[1:50:50] streamers okay
[1:50:52] is it on okay so on thank you so see
[1:50:55] what greater on or could God give to his
[1:50:58] prophet than to be like a son oh it's
[1:50:59] okay Brad you finish off with that thank
[1:51:01] you though for being willing sir I
[1:51:02] appreciate that
[1:51:05] so in closing this is this
[1:51:07] the mean that I saw from Facebook I know
[1:51:10] it's hard to read but I basically just
[1:51:12] took these than I either added some or I
[1:51:14] basically added to it this is from
[1:51:18] brother rod maleva from the Philippines
[1:51:19] I saw this and brother it just struck me
[1:51:22] brother William like hey this is
[1:51:24] powerful brother Brandon was such a
[1:51:27] bible-based vindicated modern-day
[1:51:30] prophet you could see his life in almost
[1:51:32] every prophet in the entire Bible so how
[1:51:36] many appreciate that by God's grace I'm
[1:51:39] you're thankful who wants to stand on
[1:51:41] that this profit side who wants to take
[1:51:43] sides with the message of the hour I'll
[1:51:45] be the first one I know you would be too
[1:51:47] we all be wrestling for the first spot
[1:51:48] will stand behind God's prophet because
[1:51:51] he had a bible-based ministry and he
[1:51:53] preached thus saith the Lord amen let's
[1:51:56] just bow our heads here for a moment by
[1:51:57] God's grace I'm believe that the God of
[1:52:00] brother Branham is here tonight how many
[1:52:01] believe that I believe with all my heart

[1:52:16] my wife got here the migraines it's just
[1:52:18] on a Wednesday night there was just
[1:52:20] there was less people here tonight than
[1:52:21] this I was preaching on how Jesus Christ
[1:52:23] is a healer he's the same yesterday
[1:52:25] today and forever and my wife said she
[1:52:27] sat there and she and I said how the the
[1:52:30] the children's bread is just the the
[1:52:34] crumbs the the children eat the crumbs
[1:52:35] I'm sorry the dogs eat the crumbs that
[1:52:37] fall from the master's table how much
[1:52:39] more do the children eat the bread of
[1:52:40] God and my wife sat there and the God
[1:52:44] spoke to her heart and said I'm a
[1:52:45] daughter of God I received the
[1:52:47] children's bread I don't have to have
[1:52:48] migraines anymore and God gave her
[1:52:50] healing right there in her seat now it's

[1:53:25] and criticize him with the wrong spirit

[1:53:32] his ministry matched the Bible perfectly
[1:53:34] and he said he came that we would have a
[1:53:38] spiritual relationship with you
[1:53:40] Lord while brother branham's not here we
