And I hope you come to hear from God. Amen. Let's just let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God today. If you have an unspoken request as we bow and close our eyes, just lift your hand to the Lord. Make your request known unto him. Lord God, Father, I lift my hands, Lord, because there are many things, Lord, I want to see you do in my life, Lord. Lord, I'm not content where I am, Lord. I know there's still more of you to get, more of you to receive. Lord, more of you to be unveiled unto me, Lord. Even though I've been serving you a long time, Lord, there's still a hunger there for more of you, Lord. And you see the different hands that are lifted to you, Lord. And you knew about those needs before the foundation of the world. But Lord, you told us to ask that our joy may be full, Lord. So Lord, you see, Lord, that we're asking, Lord, our hands are lifted, Lord. And we know and believe that we're in divine presence because we have a promise in the word that says wherever two or three are gathered in your name, there will you also be in the midst. So Lord, believing that you're here, Lord, and you're here as our our Jehovah, one who dwells with his family, Lord. And Lord, we're here as your children, as the sheep of your pasture, Lord. And Father, we just pray, Lord, that you would just have your way with us, Lord, in our minds, Lord, that we are only receive the thoughts of God, &gt;&gt; Lord God. And father receiving those thoughts not just Lord God in a thought process but let it become action Lord. Let the thoughts of God become action in our lives, Lord. And Lord, and give us the spirit of humility and surrender, Lord, and teach us how to yield to your purpose and your way, Lord, as we hear the word of God, Lord. And help us not to crave anything that's not of your will in our lives, Lord, and continue to bless this church, Lord, and the pastor. Continue to give him wisdom and guidance and leadership, Lord. Father God, just let the sheep follow him as he follows Christ, Lord. Lord, and we'll be careful to give you all the honor, glory, and praise. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to Matthew 24. Matthew the 24th chapter. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many feel good today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, uh coming to church, you should feel good when you come to church. You shouldn't feel condemned. Hallelujah. cuz this is the place where you can be yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Of all places, church, you should be able to be yourself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh Matthew chapter 24. I feel like I said Genesis. Matthew 24. Um let's start reading at um verse 4. Genesis. I mean, I'm sorry. I don't know. Must be something going on. Somebody must be having a beginning this morning. &gt;&gt; You know, Genesis means the beginning. Amen. Let's let's let's go to verse four. Matthew 24 and4. The Bible says, "And Jesus answered and said unto them, take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many, and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that ye be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nations shall rise against nations, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines, and pestilence, and earthquakes in diverse places. All these are the beginning of sorrow. Then shall they deliver you up to to be afflicted and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, and the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh second Peter chapter 1. Second Peter chapter 1 verse let's start at verse 18. Second Peter 1 and8 the Bible says and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we heard with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn on the day star rise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. Amen. May the Lord a bless read of his word. You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know this morning by the grace of God we what we have is almost in the form of a of a Bible study but I'm I'm I'm not a teacher. So you pray for me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I I I I I want to make you aware of something. Amen. Now today, by the grace of God, I want to talk about prophecy will find you. Prophecy will find you. How many has ever heard that word prophecy before? Hallelujah. Prophecy is something that God talks about in his in his word in his word. You know, it said things have been prophesied, things have uh uh been fulfilled. But when we think about prophecy finding you look in the Bible they ask Jesus you know how do we know where we are? How do we know that the end is soon to come? &gt;&gt; You know and we've been hearing this most of our lives that we are in the last days. &gt;&gt; You know that that the Lord is soon to come. Church, I want you to really understand that God is coming back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is coming back. And it's been foretold. It's been prophesied uh uh different signs and things that will take place as the Lord is making his way back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what we want to do today, we want to by the grace of God show you that God is in motion. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is in motion. He's making his way. Now, now what is what does prophecy mean? Prophecy is the foretelling of things to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophecy is, hallelujah, maybe a future event that's being made known or something that's going to take place in your life. Hallelujah. That's what prophecy is. Now, I said prophecy will find you. How do we conduct ourselves? This is the question. How do we conduct ourselves when we hear prophecy? Amen. &gt;&gt; When we hear future events being foretold, things that's going to affect our lives. Now to make it even more simple, hallelujah. Every day we are a part of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whatever age you are in this building, you are a part of prophecy. Hallelujah. There's a prophecy and then there's a manifestation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand that you can hear a prophecy, but a lot of times you are walking in the manifestation of the future. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, you might look at that and say, "Man, that's that's kind of deep." No, it's simple. Hallelujah. Like I said, every day we walk in the fulfillment of a prophecy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, Brother Diggs, every day today has been prophesied what the weather's going to be. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Yesterday on the news, the person that did the forecast of the weather, they said, "Well, it's going to be 80 something degrees, sunny, shiny, the wind's going to be blowing this or whatever." So, what do we do? We dress according to what we heard. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If they said it's going to be nice and sunny, none of us are pulling out hoodies. Hallelujah. None of us are pulling out gloves and hoodies and boots, snow boots and all that. Why? Because you heard the prophecy and now you're going to step into the fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going to step into what you heard and become, Hallelujah. what was prophesied. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we today, most of us, we went out the house, we dress according to the weather. Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; What if they said it was going to I'm going to show you now how often you fulfill prophecy and don't even realize it. Hallelujah. If they say it's going to rain, what do you do? You put on all your weather. You put on all your rain clothes. &gt;&gt; Some of us, Hallelujah. It hadn't even started raining yet, but you getting ready for it. So, you take an umbrella with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What are you? You're preparing yourself to manifest what's about to happen in the future. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you become the manifestation of what was said. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, you take that you take that umbrella. Hallelujah. You might even put it in your car. It ain't raining yet, but you're preparing for it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you believe what you heard was truth. &gt;&gt; Oh my. This is rich. Hallelujah. You believe, hallelujah, that the weatherman would lie to you. Hallelujah. So you are preparing, hallelujah, yourself for what you heard. You are now stepping into the thoughts of the weatherman. You are now, hallelujah, letting the voice of the weatherman, hallelujah, control your actions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you don't even know him, but there's a level of trust in what he said. Hallelujah. So you going to dress right. Hallelujah. You going to get the umbrella. You might even have on shoes. Hallelujah. That won't where your feet won't be affected. Hallelujah. By the water. &gt;&gt; Every step. Hallelujah. You're going to step according to the prophecy that you heard. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are now stepping into your future. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So prophecy can just be as simple as a fulfillment of a weather pattern. Hallelujah. And we step into, hallelujah, that next day saying it's going to rain. &gt;&gt; We step into the next day saying, "Well, it's going to be 90° or whatever the weather man said." We're looking to be the fulfillment of what was said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, the prophet of God said, "Amen. When it comes to prophecy, hallelujah, it's something speaking in the future." Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; But church, what I want to talk about today, I want to make it real clear. Hallelujah. When it comes to us, what's been prophesied. Hallelujah. We're living it right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is called a book of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Bible is future events being foretold, lived out by sons and daughters of God. Hallelujah. So, when Hallelujah. Now, what is the Bible? The Bible is God in letter form. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The thoughts of God, &gt;&gt; the voice of God, &gt;&gt; the actions of God, &gt;&gt; the mind of God, &gt;&gt; everything about God is in this Bible. &gt;&gt; So when you have this Bible, you have God. &gt;&gt; Now, the thing of it is is hallelujah. We don't want to Hallelujah. reason with this because it's going to happen. Hallelujah. It's going to happen because why? God, hallelujah, has never hallelujah deterred or with a different way detourred. Hallelujah. From what's written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible can't be changed. The Bible can't be altered. Hallelujah. But the Bible is exactly what God means. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if you can find it in the Bible, you can rest on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the devil doesn't want you to read your Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he knows if you read your Bible, you'll start to understand God's way. &gt;&gt; And as you begin to understand God's way, then you begin to prepare for what's about to come. &gt;&gt; H the Bible, Hallelujah. The Bible will teach you how to dress for your future. &gt;&gt; It'll show you where to step for your future. It'll show you things to come for your future. Hallelujah. This is a book of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, it's very important. Hallelujah. Don't lay this on the shelf. Seek for understanding. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But are we in a time where the Bible is becoming real? Church, let me say it like this. Now, I ain't going to be long. Y'all know I'm about to close. But listen, church. When it comes to you, prophecy for prophecy finding you, the word of God. Hallelujah. In every age searches for a people to fulfill what's in their day. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Every every age. And we're in the last church age. So God has sought out a people that could manifest the prophecies in the 20th century. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you want to believe that you are a part of the prophecy. You are a part of the fulfillment. Hallelujah. Because if you are a part of the fulfillment, hallelujah, your life, hallelujah, is a statement of what God is doing in your day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, I'm going tell you a a personal testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As a young man, when I first came into the ministry, I I didn't told this testimony in a couple places, but it kind of goes with this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just like some of you, I was just in church, you know, just trying to find my way, find my find find, you know, like we say, I'm I'm trying to find God. No, you ain't. God ain't missing. &gt;&gt; God is not missing. Stop saying that. I'm trying to find the Lord. And surrender. &gt;&gt; Just surrender. Hallelujah. Because if you are making that statement, that mean God is dealing with you. Just surrender. Hallelujah. Just just my you know my mama used to tell me son don't try to be all mysterious with God. Talk to God like a friend. Hallelujah. You know, there's times, church, where I don't have no words, but Lord, I don't know what's going on. I just need your help. &gt;&gt; Just like that. We don't have to come before God and say, "Oh, Lord, you are the great August being. You come from the land of nothingness." And oh, that don't impress God. &gt;&gt; Don't none of that stuff impress God? You just come to God and say, "Lord, my my my spirit is broken." &gt;&gt; Like, Lord, Lord, I want to know you. Lord, I got this habit I can't get over. I need your strength. Talk to God like that. Amen. Talk to God with sincerity. Hallelujah. Don't come to God trying to be something you not. Hallelujah. Don't come to God, Hallelujah. Trying to express something that you can't keep up to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but be simple with God. Be plain with God. Hallelujah. And you know, she used to tell me, she said, "Son, there's a part where the prophet of God did, the prophet didn't know God." And he said, he said, "Mr. Great God, whoever you are, he just started talking to him like a tree, &gt;&gt; the God of the ABCs, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be simple with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God is hidden and revealed in simplicity. &gt;&gt; When you really start to take time with God, this is not difficult to understand. When you enter into a willing place to serve him, this becomes understandable. &gt;&gt; You know what he wants. You hear people say it all the time. Well, the Bible confusing, so I'm going to get me a New International Version. No. No. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Even right now. Hallelujah. Don't do it. Don't do it right now, but when you get home, look at what kind of Bible you got. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because you can have a Bible that's been inspired by man. Say, you know what? I'm gonna make the word of God easier. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to take this scripture out and I'mma add this in &gt;&gt; or I'mma take this word out and I'mma add this in and make it easier so the people can understand it. What they're doing, they're trying to change God's mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. where God may have that word in there purposely because it has something that you need. &gt;&gt; Church, in a lot of these new Bibles, the New International Version, the the version of the heavens and and the versions of the Mcabes and all this stuff, they are inspired by men wanting to make things easier to understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Bible says God hides his word from the wise and prudent, but he reveals it unto babes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen to that. He reveals it unto babes. What he's saying, the word of God, when you apply yourself, it's so easy to understand that a baby can f the baby can find their way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But church, back in back in the day, many many many years ago. Oh, hardly. I ain't going to tell you my age, but many years ago, I was doing a youth meeting. And in this youth meeting, there was a sister sitting on the front row like my brothers right here. And as I was preaching, she got up and went to the bathroom. She said the reason why she got up and went to the bathroom because she felt like something demonic was happening to her while the word was being preached. She said, so she went in the bathroom. Hallelujah, Sister Smith. And she says she started to repent. &gt;&gt; She started to say, "Lord, forgive me. I I don't know what's going on, but I want to hear the word and something just ain't happening." Hallelujah. How do you respond when things are off in your life? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you feel like there's a spirit there or you feel like, hallelujah, something's stopping you from getting to that place in God, how do you respond? Do you just go with the flow or you say, "All right, it'll be all right." Or do you cry to God, "Lord, help me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, she didn't understand what was going on. So, she went in the bathroom. Now, this is in the middle while I'm preaching. She went in the bathroom and start She said she started repenting. She said, "Lord, I don't know what's going on, but Father, please help me." She said God spoke to her and said, "Everything is all right. Go back in there. I something I need you to tell my servant." Hallelujah. See, one thing I want you to understand, hallelujah, I said this yesterday. God talk to us all the time, but are we aware of it? &gt;&gt; Are we aware that he's speaking? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because what I want to share right now is that when the devil speaks and God speaks, it's the same voice of your conscience. &gt;&gt; But it's up to you to interpret which spirit is behind that voice of your conscience. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, when you leave here, hallelujah, and you start to rehearse what was preached, you're not going to hear my voice in your conscience. You're going to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I give you a prime example. Everybody under their breath right now say, "Stop." &gt;&gt; Under your breath. &gt;&gt; Not out loud. &gt;&gt; Listen to me real good. &gt;&gt; Under under. No, you know what? I got something for you. Hallelujah. Let me find it. I hope I still got it. Okay, without saying it out loud, say this back to me. Now, I'mma ask you something. Say it again. Did you hear it? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about all of it. &gt;&gt; Where's that voice coming from? &gt;&gt; That voice is in you. &gt;&gt; Now, it's it's up to you to interpret whether this is something good or this is something bad. &gt;&gt; Because it's your voice rehearsing it back to you. Hallelujah. It ain't the what makes it God's voice or the devil's voice. The way you interpret it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are all saying amen right now under our voice. You don't hear brother de. Let's say it one more time. &gt;&gt; You didn't hear my voice, did you? Hallelujah. You heard your voice. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times, church, when spiritual things happen. Hallelujah. You can't blame it on nobody else. You're hearing it under your own perception. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're hearing it under your own voice. So, it's up to you to interpret what kind of spirit is behind it. Hallelujah sir. &gt;&gt; And you know, hallelujah. Back to the testimony. She was, you know, this this, you know, I carry this sometime cuz people just look at you and they don't say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if y'all get a little cold on me, I'mma hold this up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, look, church. Hallelujah. She said she she was in the bathroom and and God told her, "Go back out there. There something I need you to tell your servant." Now, she started to say this. What was happening? Hallelujah. As I'm preaching, she saw two of me up there, Brother Jesse. Hallelujah. She saw one uh uh on your left, which is my right. And she saw another one. Hallelujah. On your right, which is my left. Hallelujah. She said, "And this one over here would step into this one, and then this one would preach, and it would step back out," she said. And then it would step back in, and it would preach, and then it would step back out. And she said she thought she was seeing something demonic. Hallelujah. So she ran to the bathroom. She said when she came back out, God started to explain to her what was happening. &gt;&gt; That's why what we have the message of the hour is very important to understand. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God, and I'm going to get to this, God sent a vindicated prophet so that we could understand the book of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There are people been reading this Bible for years with no understanding. &gt;&gt; It's just intellect. &gt;&gt; Putting putting uh definitions with definitions. No, we want to live the life of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But look, church, she said she gets in there and she sees one one me stepping into the other me. And when that one steps in, I begin to preach. She said, "And then he steps out, steps back in, preach, steps out, steps back in, preach." And she was looking like, she said, she was thinking, "Oh, oh, Malachi, it's something demonic going on." She said she sat there, she said, God began to rehearse back to her what she studied in the message. Hallelujah. She said, remember, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Angels are in this room that's just a little too faster for this eye. &gt;&gt; That dimension is here right now. Angels are in this room. Hallelujah. But we can't see it with our natural human eye unless God hallelujah. puts us in that realm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Unless your spirit Hallelujah. Slows everything down and God allows you to step into it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wouldn't you want to be able to see angels? &gt;&gt; And he said, if angels are in this room, God is in this room. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You say, "Really, brother Diggs? Ain't got is is angels and God? Are they is God really in this room?" Again, you have to understand that this cannot change. The Bible says, "Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there will I also be in the midst." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I know I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I Is there another believer in here? Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there another believer? Is there another believer in here? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believer. &gt;&gt; Believer. Believer. Believer. Believer. Believer. Believer. Believer. Believer. H. So, we got more than two or three. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, that means God has to be here. &gt;&gt; Prophecy fulfilled. &gt;&gt; We're living in the manifestation right now of God's presence. H God is in this room. &gt;&gt; That ain't no skim milk. God is in this room. Church, when you when you go back home and they say, "How was church?" You say, "Man, I I was in there with God." &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; I was in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was in the presence of the Lord. Church, those are not just good slogans or good things to say. No, it is a reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; My book of prophecy which cannot change the foretelling of future events says that wherever two or three believers gather, God will also be in my midst. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Lord is here. &gt;&gt; Church, she said, and I'm still telling you testimony. She said she could see two of me. She's saying what God was showing her. She said, "See what you're seeing is his theophony giving him the word to preach to the people." &gt;&gt; That's a word, hallelujah, that's been revealed and and and and unraveled unto us through what we study in the message of the hour. A theophony body, which is a word body. Hallelujah. A theophony is your representation in heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what she was seeing was my spiritual representation &gt;&gt; that's already in the presence of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Coming down to give the church a word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For what they needed in that moment. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She said the the will jump back into my flesh and the flesh would preach. And then the word will jump back out. Then the word will jump back in. Preach. Then the word will jump back out. Then the word will jump back in and preach. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother D, what are you saying? If my theophony is preaching to you, it's preaching to your theophony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my church. If I'm preaching to you right now and there's something in you that says amen, that's not your flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your flesh has never been in heaven. Right, brother. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Bible says flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So, if I'm saying anything to you, and there's something inside of you that says, "Amen," that mean you have a theophony. &gt;&gt; That means, hallelujah, that one place, one point of time, you were in heaven with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's where your amens are coming from. It's coming from your representation. &gt;&gt; I got a couple amens on that one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, she say she was seeing all that. She said, "Now, what you seeing?" She said, "God was showing her sitting in service." She said, "God is showing her." Said, "What you're seeing is his his theophony. His theophony is giving him the word to preach to the people." And she said, "That went on for a while." And she said, "There's something I want you to tell him when service is over." And this is what God told her to tell me. Say, tell him that I called him to preach. &gt;&gt; And that I'mma use him and take his ministry in places he could only imagine. &gt;&gt; I had just started preaching. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let me say it like this. I wasn't looking to be a preacher, &gt;&gt; but it was all the choosing of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church, I say that to say this. Last year I was in the Philippines around Christmas time and me and some brothers was riding. I think I told brother Jesse this. Me and some brothers was riding. The brother asked me, he said, "Bro Digs, have you been to all the continents?" I was like, "I don't know." Hallelujah. Geography wasn't my strong point. Hallelujah. Not math, not English. I love biology. the study of Hallelujah. Biology was my thing. Hallelujah. But you know, he he he said, "Well, let's name them out." He said, "How many other ones?" He said, "Sven." So, they started naming them. I said, "Yeah, I've been there." They started nameing. I said, "Yeah, I've been there, church. I've been to six of the continents. &gt;&gt; There's only one I haven't been to, and that's Antarctica, and I have no desire." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you saying? That what you're looking at is a fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that you are a part of this fulfillment. &gt;&gt; Me traveling to Akan, Ohio is a part of prophecy being fulfilled. But today it's a manifestation of prophecy. &gt;&gt; You are not just the prophecy. You are the manifestation of what God said. See, so when God called me, he saw you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, "You know what? I'm going to take your ministry into places you could only imagine." I never imagined coming to Akan. I never knew of Akan until LeBron became a pro basketball athlete. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Never even heard of it. Hallelujah. But God knew of you. So what he did, he put a gift in me. Hallelujah. To get me where? To Akan. Because there was a people who would manifest the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It goes so much deeper. Hallelujah. God put a seed in a man named Jesse. Hallelujah. He put a word in him, a gift of a pastor. Why? To start a church. Why? To fulfill what was told to me. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesse, hallelujah. Was already a part of the vision for my life. Yes. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Jesse, his wife, all of you, this whole church. &gt;&gt; You're a part of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother D, what are you saying? You are a part of God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; You are a part of God's mind. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God created me just to speak to you. &gt;&gt; God created him just to speak to you. Hallelujah. You are the manifestation of what God's thoughts were. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But let's backtrack a little bit. Hallelujah. Now, there's always a prophecy and there's a fulfillment. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or there's a manifestation. Now, let's look at it, church. The Bible is not like any other book. Right? &gt;&gt; So what you ought to do in your service to God is study this, know this, become this &gt;&gt; because this is unchangeable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you say, "God, all I'm doing is what's in the Bible." God can't deny you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this is who he is. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet of God says. He says, "Now, the Bible is a different book from any other sacred book." Hallelujah. There's a lot of other sacred books. The Quran, H is considered to be a sacred book. H the book of the Mcabes and the book of Jash, all these things. H book of Ja, whatever they call it. H all of these supposed to be sacred books. But then he says there's no book like the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to me good now. Follow me. Amen. I ain't going to be long. Follow me now. He said there's no book like the Bible because the Bible is God in word for &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not the Quran, not the Mcabes, not the book of Jes. But he said the Bible is God in word form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you know what? When you got a Hallelujah, a Bible, Hallelujah, a King James version tucked under your home, you walking with God. I don't have to go to heaven. Heaven is with me. God is with me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; Oh my. The Bible is God in word form. See, it's a word. It's a thought expressed. God's thinking expressed it. His word. Hallelujah. Through the prophets and they wrote the Bible. Hallelujah. See, the prophets of God were inspired to put God's thoughts in a book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just a man saying, "Well, I don't know what that means." So, we going to take that word out &gt;&gt; and we going to make it simple. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, like the Bible says a woman shouldn't wear pants. Somebody else say, "Well, nah, nah, that ain't in that ain't in the Bible. I don't see that." &gt;&gt; Oh, it's in there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's according to your understanding. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. The Bible says garments pertaining to a man. Now, the last time I checked my closet, I don't have no dresses in there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Pertain to me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Last time I checked my car, I ain't got no tutu. I ain't got no halter tops. I ain't got none of that and stuff. All of that pertains to a woman. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now, talk to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you brothers when you step out, you put on a wrap skirt? That's right. &gt;&gt; If you do that, you got a perverted spirit on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or you going to find you a nice little mini, a little jean mini, and put that on and say, "I'm going to go shoot some basketball." &gt;&gt; No, you got a perverted spirit on you then. &gt;&gt; The Bible says garments pertaining to, hallelujah. Pertaining means, hallelujah, to be, hallelujah, to seek after. Hallelujah. To look like, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So garments pertaining to the man is what? These. Hallelujah. Well, they say, "Well, back in those days, they wasn't even wearing pants." You know what? We ain't back in those days. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not putting on a moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo or goooo or tutu. I'm putting on pants. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, in my day, Hallelujah. The word is to match what's in my day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. So for a woman to put on garments pertaining to a man, what does that mean? If a woman stands beside me and we look alike, that means that our garments are the same. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's more than just Hallelujah. garments. There's so many other things that go on why you shouldn't wear pants. Hallelujah. There is the lust factor. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because when a woman puts on garments, it shows a whole figure. There's no more a mystery. Everything about her is seen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was talking to a brother, a fellow I used to work with, and we started talking about this, right? He was the denomination Christian. We started talking about this. He said, he said, "Well, man," he said, "Dre," they called me Dre. He said, "Dre, I don't see nothing wrong with it." I said, "That's cuz you like seeing your wife in pants. That's why you don't see nothing wrong with it." But when you want to be pleasing in God's eyes, hallelujah, you want to be the manifestation of God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There is a word and there is a fulfillment of that word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look, the Bible is not like any other sacred book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, I'll tell all you young people, hallelujah, don't get mad at your parents because of the way you're living. All they're trying to do is give you God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not their thoughts. &gt;&gt; It's not their mind. All we're trying to do is conduct ourselves according to how God thinks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. He says God speak and express his words, thoughts, hallelujah, his words through the prophets. And they wrote the Bible which is in word form. And Jesus called it a seed. Hallelujah. So church, when we begin to live out this, hallelujah. It's the planting of the seed inside of you. Hallelujah. And as you continue to live this word, the seed in you will grow. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What waters that seed? The word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. God put himself in you and uses himself to make you grow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith cometh by hearing. Hearing what? The word of God. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; He said, "And Jesus called it a seed, and a seed will bring forth of its own kind." So if you study the word, you listen to the word, it can only bring forth what? The word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother D, I want to know more about God." Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; You say, "I want I want more victory." Study your Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Listen. And any seed will bring forth of his kind. if it is in the right conditions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, so you cannot bring forth God listening to the Quran. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because he's not in that book. &gt;&gt; His nature is not in that book. You can't study about the Buddhist and Confucious and all these things and say, "I want to be like the most high." He's not revealed in that book. Those are books of good ethics, books of good morals. But this books tell us how to live. &gt;&gt; This books, hallelujah, tells us how to generate his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This book tells us what we will be if we become this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. But Jesse, one thing I found out is &gt;&gt; when you start pointing people back to the Bible, they kind of shut you off a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because they have their own perceptions on what they want to do. &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people don't want raw Bible &gt;&gt; because they want a religion where they can still smoke and drink. &gt;&gt; They can still go to the club. &gt;&gt; They they they Oh my hallelujah. We got Christians. I know somebody who say she was a Christian. Hallelujah. And every time I turn around, she on IG. Hallelujah. Putting up a video. &gt;&gt; Got her boots on the ground. Every time you turn around, I see some of y'all holding y'all laugh back. You didn't see them video. Everybody Everybody turn boots on the ground. I got my boots on the ground. Boot bendy to church. Praise the Lord. My thing always be Hallelujah. No matter what you think is all right. Hallelujah. If it's all right, will God be there with you? &gt;&gt; While you going to the cookout and boots on the ground, will God be at the cookout with you with his boots on the ground? &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, they got a movie about the Lord and this and that." Will God be at the movie theater with you eating popcorn with you? &gt;&gt; Eating some gooboos and and Eminem drinking a good old ice cold cherry coke. Will God be there with you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, hallelujah. The Bible presents a separation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. He said, "This book, oh my," he said, "In the right atmosphere now, this book," Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; "Prophecy, it foretells future events." Church, hallelujah, ain't going to dwell too much into this, but think about it. Where are we concerning prophecy? &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. And now the book contains the entire revelation of Jesus Christ. This is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I want to know you." Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, am I living right? Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Can I be a good husband? Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Can I be a good wife? Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; It's all in there. I just want to be a good son, a good daughter. Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I want to uh make good investments. Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; It's all in there. Everything about life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's in this Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Listen now, the book contains the entire revelation of Jesus Christ. You don't add to it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; We don't add to it. &gt;&gt; We don't add to the Bible because if we add to it, now we trying to tell God how to think. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said or take away from it. You don't take away from it because now you're trying to tell God what he can and cannot be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we read it, we accept it, and we walk in it. Hallelujah. Read it, accept it, and walk in it. &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Read it, accept it, and walk in it. One more time. Read it. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all were lip singing. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't audible, the devil didn't hear it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he's not taking you serious. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelu. You know, if Satan got a grip on you, hallelujah, he don't have to back up until your confession is heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The power of confession. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Listen. Amen. I hope y'all don't mind me reading. Hallelujah. Listen. He says, "It's got to come according to the word if it comes from God." &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I want to do this. I want to do that and you want to be a Christian, it better be in here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said because it's to vindicate it or to prove God's presence and he forneew all these things being his fornowledge. He ordained for ordained is called hallelujah. It's called in the Bible predestination. Listen to this. Every age are you with me? &gt;&gt; Every age to its place. He say that's what the Bible is doing. That's what God has predestinated. Every age to his place. Now, we'll accept that. But listen to what else he says. And every man to his place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we have a age. Hallelujah. That God has predestinated to be in a certain place. He's also put a man and placed him in that age. Hallelujah. And predestinated him to be something in that age. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't have Noah's message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was for his day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Joshua didn't have Noah's message. It was for his day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jeremiah, hallelujah, didn't have Isaiah's message. Isaiah's message was for his day. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, you can quote what happened in those days, but you got to live for what God has for you in your day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it right now. Me and Jesse say, "You know what? That's enough of this. We We going to build a boat cuz it's going to rain. &gt;&gt; I I I'm getting inspired. I want to be like, "No, I'mma build me a big old boat and we gonna bring we gonna go to the zoo and get two of everything and bring it on the boat." &gt;&gt; Think about that. H. That would be something that we just want to do. &gt;&gt; What Noah did came directly inspired by God. &gt;&gt; Noah didn't have to go get animals. They automatically came. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They came in to Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, God was inspiring that in that day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, so if God is behind it, Hallelujah. You don't have to waste your strength. &gt;&gt; God will do it himself &gt;&gt; because it's his work. Hallelujah. The bride of Christ fellowship is God's work. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said every man to his place and every messenger to his place. He is God. The devil ain't pulling nothing over God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, let me dwell over here for a little minute. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand something about God and Satan's relationship. &gt;&gt; I I ain't think understood that they got a relationship. &gt;&gt; God and the devil have a relationship. &gt;&gt; They talk to each other all the time. &gt;&gt; And they talk about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan comes to God. He says, "You know what? I saw him. I saw him on social media. He was looking at this and looking at that." And then God said he under the blood. I ain't see nothing. &gt;&gt; He said the devil say but I saw it. He did it last night. God said he repented. I ain't see nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He repented. I don't know what you're talking about. All I see is blood. &gt;&gt; So these are the conversations God and the devil have all the time. Hallelujah. Satan comes and say, "Oh my, he was watching us on social media, watching us on the internet. He said this out his mouth." Hallelujah. Then you went and got in prayer and repented. Hallelujah. So Satan comes, he said, "God, they cussed the other day." &gt;&gt; Think y'all know I'm a blood hound, too. &gt;&gt; If it ain't under the blood, we going to sniff it out. &gt;&gt; Somebody tongue stripping every now and then. &gt;&gt; Get a little cussing out every now and then, but that's all right. Hallelujah. If you slip up, you go to God and repent. Hallelujah. The devil come and say, "Hey, they got a cussing spirit on them." Hallelujah. They You talking about them your children, they cussing. God say, "I don't know what you're talking about. All I hear is praise." [Applause] &gt;&gt; See about this church. Hallelujah. God, he made Peter a part of the resurrection. Yes. &gt;&gt; He made Peter a part, hallelujah, of the filling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Knowing he had a custom demon in him. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. &gt;&gt; Knowing he was going to deny him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Knowing Hallelujah. In his early stages, he was going to try to cut somebody head off. &gt;&gt; He wasn't He wasn't that skillful. He I'mma cut your ear off. &gt;&gt; Right. No, he was trying to cut his head off. All &gt;&gt; right, brother. &gt;&gt; But God, hallelujah, not willing for his testimony to be damaged, he just let it be an ear. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; And then God came and got rid of the evidence that it was ever that it ever even happened. &gt;&gt; Church, you look at Peter's whole journey, God evidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was a part of prophecy. &gt;&gt; He was a part of the fulfillment of what God was going to do. God said in the book of Joel, "My spirit is going to pour out upon men." Hallelujah. Peter was a part of that prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, what do you mean? Oh my. This is coming fresh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God had to get rid of all the evidence because Peter had to stand up and say, "This is what the prophet Joel talked." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My he had to be there when the Holy Ghost was being poured out because he was a manifestation of what Joel prophesied. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why God will allow you to repent and get right because you may be the fulfillment of things to come. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. That's right. &gt;&gt; And church, what I love about it, Hallelujah. God gave Peter the keys to the kingdom, knowing he would deny him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Knowing he would cuss, &gt;&gt; knowing he would walk away after Christ was crucified, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; But he gave him the keys to the kingdom. And then he said, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You got power to remit." Hallelujah. Or retain sins. Or forgive sins. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I've given you that power." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My And Peter say, "I know not the man." &gt;&gt; Right, brother? Right. &gt;&gt; None of that bothers God. &gt;&gt; Because what I want you to understand is you can't stop prophecy. &gt;&gt; There it is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's going to come to pass whether you like it or not. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, I had trips I ain't feel like going on. &gt;&gt; Right, brother? &gt;&gt; Tell your testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't know if I told this a year ago I was going to South Africa and I normally brother Jesse know I travel light but because I was going to be over there almost two weeks I travel with a bag bigger than what I normally do cuz I don't like to check my bag in cuz I don't like for my stuff to get lost. Hallelujah. If you ever have a bag lost, you're real cautious, cautious whenever you travel. I had a bag lost before. So now when I travel, I travel as light as I can. Hallelujah. So, but this time because I was going to be over there so long, I travel with a bigger bag. And I'm still talking about prophecy finding you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I travel with a bigger bag. So I check the bag in. So I flew to I flew from Carolina to Atlanta and I was going from Atlanta to Joberg Johannesburg from Johannesburg to Durban, South Africa. H Once I hit Johannesburg, I'm in South Africa. Hallelujah. So but I had a layover for a day in Johannesburg. So I got a hotel room and I said, "Okay, I come back to the airport in the morning, finish the finish the rest of it to get me to Derban." So church, when I got on the plane, hallelujah, from Atlanta to Joberg, my bag didn't. Now, I didn't know that. So the next day, I get up, I fly down to Derban. I'm at the baggage thing, waiting on my bag. No bag. Pastor sitting there waiting on me. Me and him, I was like, I don't know where my bag at. No bag. No bag. 20 minutes later, no bag. No bag. I said, "Okay, let me pull this ticket out and go to the counter." Go to the counter. Talk to the lady. Ladies, let me look it up. Oh my goodness. Your bag is not even here. All I got, hallelujah, is my book bag. But in my book bag, I got my toiletries. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. I got my Bible. Hallelujah. And my iPad. Hallelujah. and all my charges. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So I don't feel as bad and I ain't got no clothes. Hallelujah. But at least I got some soap. Hallelujah. So anyway, hallelujah. The people say, "Well, we'll get your bag on this flight and send it to you." They say, "Okay, praise God." Hallelujah. That didn't happen before. One day, now we got to go. I got to go buy some clothes. Got money that I don't want to spend. Money that I need. Hallelujah. But now I got to go to the store, buy clothes, cuz I got a service at 3:00. I just got there at 11. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the pastor, he don't care about me not having clothes. He's like, "Come on, let's go. We'll just go get something. Come on. Come on. Come on." So, we go there, church, go to the store. Hallelujah. I get uh enough clothes to last me the weekend cuz I'm thinking my bag will be here by Monday. Hallelujah. So, I buy some pants, some shirts, and ties. Pants, shirts, and ties. at least maybe three pairs, something like that. Two pair because I had a couple services. You know, when you get to Africa, you ain't sitting still. You gonna preach. Hallelujah. So, I bought like three outfits, two three shirts, two three pair of pants, something like that. Hallelujah. Had to buy some shoes, too, cuz they had no dress shoes. Hallelujah. So, anyway, everybody all right? So, anyway, hallelujah. We had services and I mean, we preached. Hallelujah. So, the first night I got there, I said, "Hey, y'all pray for me because I'm feeling very uncomfortable. My bag was stuck in Atlanta and I have no clothes and now I got to preach. Y'all pray with me. I love to have my clothes. I love to put my stuff on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I love to put it on. Hallelujah. But now I got some wood lights, some whatever you know some of that stuff. So I'm feeling very very uncomfortable, but I got to preach. So I preach, we have a good time, everything. So brother, hallelujah, calls me the next day. He says, "Hey, brother Digs." He looks me up on uh and get my number. He say, "Hey, brother Dicks, uh, can I buy you some jeans?" Now, here come this false humility. I'm talking about me. False humility. Nah, brother. I'm all right. I'm good. I don't have no clothes and I'm telling this man, I'm good. &gt;&gt; Trying to be humble. &gt;&gt; God knows who you are. We don't have to fake one another out. If God has put it on somebody's heart to bless you, just receive the blessing. &gt;&gt; Stop trying to be all super spiritual. &gt;&gt; I'm trusting God. God, hallelujah, is sending somebody to answer your prayers. And you putting on this false humility. No, I'm good. I appreciate you, brother. All is well. &gt;&gt; I got a pet peeve. Hallelujah. We know what a pet peeve is. You know, you talking to somebody, huh? I shook a one a young sister's hand one time. Walk up to her. She walk, "Hey, brother Digs, how you doing?" Say, "God bless you.

Praise God. Yeah. Praise God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Okay, give you send me your size and I I I I'll get you some Levis's and bring them to you tomorrow." And just like he said, he did that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He bought me some Levis's and brought them to me. Hallelujah. I was like, "Praise the Lord." Hallelujah. Monday comes, no bag. Hallelujah. So, we go back and search the bag out. They didn't send the bag to London. I think they were looking at my itinerary because two weeks from there I was supposed to be in London. So they they they sent my bag. Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; They sent my bag to London. So now I still ain't got no clothes. So that you know time go I'm preaching. Hallelujah. Got services all over the place. But now I need more clothes. The same brother he says, "Hey, brother Diggs is on my heart. Let me and my wife take you shopping. There go this false humility again. Nah, brother, you ain't got to do all that. I don't have no clothes. That's like you praying. You praying to the Lord. Say, "Lord," and I pray this prayer all say, "Lord, I just need more finances for this, for that." And then somebody says, "Hey, I want to give you like, no, no, I'm good. The Lord gonna take care of the Lord is using you to take care of it, &gt;&gt; right? and you rejected it because of your false humility. &gt;&gt; That person is a manifestation of your prayers being answered and you won't accept it because they go to church with you. &gt;&gt; Right, brother? Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my church. I'm so beyond that. Now, if you come to me and you say, "Bro D, the Lord want me to get his eyes say, "Praise the Lord." Hal Hallelujah. I might shout the house down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God has taught me a lesson. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be uh uh super spiritual for one another. &gt;&gt; Just be real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, church. Hallelujah. Now, now, now this brother says to me, he me and my wife want to take you uh uh shopping. I'm like, "Brother, that ain't necessary." He's like, "No, no, we want to do it." I said, "Okay." Called back again about the bag. time we we'll get back in touch with you. I said, "Well, let me go ahead and go shopping with them." So, we go to the mall. Hallelujah. And the perception is, let me let me tell you, let me say this for you. Hallelujah. Certain parts of Africa, they got better malls than we got. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like one time, I was getting shots going somewhere and the lady say, "Is it true they got monkeys in the street?" I say you got monkeys in your street. Foolishness watching CNN and all kind of nonsense. Hallelujah. Brother picked me up in a BMW. Hallelujah. But anyway, church. Now, hallelujah. We in the store. We in the mall. We go in the store. He said, "Hey, you like Nike, don't you?" Man, he talking about language now. Hallelujah. He got me some Levi. Now we in a Nike store. He like, "Hey, you you you need a you need a sweatuit. Get you a whole sweatuit." He coming back, lining it like I'm his child. Line it up on me. Yeah, you can fit that. Go try that on. Go try that on. Hey, he go shirt. Hey, go try that. Get get the parent here. Go try that on. How many you need? Two. Three. I said, "No, no, bro. That's too much. Too go try. You need a hat, church." He had about three outfits in that store. In that store, probably about two outfits. Then we went to the bar with dress code. Hey, get you some more dress shirts. Hallelujah. Get you some underwear, some socks. Hallelujah. Some night garments. Hallelujah. Get you some ties. Get church. I walked up out of there like I was in a shopping spree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I had to tell him, "Brother, this is enough. Stop. Stop." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church. Hallelujah. When God puts it on somebody heart to bless you, you will be blessed. Now we walking out. Everything paid for. I got about four bags. Everything I needed. I got it now. I'm walking out. I still want my clothes though. I'm walking out and he says to me, he says, "Brother Diggs, the burden has lifted." I'm like, "Huh? The burden?" He says, "Yeah." He says about a year and a half to two years ago, there was a prophecy in church to me and my wife that somebody was going to come and y'all need to take them shopping. &gt;&gt; My bag was lost to fulfill that prophecy that was told to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church, you can be a part of a prophecy and not even know it. You can be the fulfillment of something God is doing in somebody else's life. You can be the blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, I was a fulfillment of what God told them to do. Hallelujah. And instead of saying, "No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good." And they wouldn't stop. Hallelujah. Until the prophecy was a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just that trip alone, one young brother when he found out I was in the area, he said, "Lord, I want Brother Diggs to preach to me on my birthday." Now, I didn't even know it was his birthday. I had no intentions on coming to his church. Basically, I couldn't make it to his church cuz I was going someplace else. But then they asked me to preach at this place, but it was on a Wednesday and a camp meeting I was doing from Thursday to Sunday. So when that Wednesday came, I said, "No, I ain't preaching nowhere Wednesday. I'mma rest cuz from here on out I'm going to be preaching." So when the brother found the pastor found out that he called back, he said, "Where brother D's going to be at?" He said, "Well, the pastor, host pastor, he said, "Okay, you can get him Tuesday night." He said, "Praise the Lord." So we get there and I'm preaching. We having church. Everything is going. We're having a good time. Hallelujah. And after I finished preaching, he said, "This day the prophecy is fulfilled. He said, "You see that young man right there? He prayed a prayer and he came and told me, hallelujah, pastor, I want Brother Diggs to preach to me on my 21st birthday." And I wasn't even in the country yet. &gt;&gt; And God honored that prayer. &gt;&gt; I was there, hallelujah, preaching to him on his 21st birthday. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing he prayed about became a manifestation. Hallelujah. Church, you can be a blessing of something God is doing. &gt;&gt; I got I got to close. I got to close. &gt;&gt; Prophecy will find you. &gt;&gt; But just to show where we are. Hallelujah. And brother Jesse can go back into these things. I'mma hit the highlights of it. Hallelujah. In 1954, the prophet prophesied that there'll be an American pope. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 1954, 71 years 71 years later, in our day, we have an American pope. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just like he prophesied, the pope today is a manifestation of what the prophet said was going to happen. Hallelujah. But just to show you, hallelujah, how, hallelujah, accurate and distinct God is when the prophet spoke that, hallelujah, nine to 10 months later, this pope was born &gt;&gt; in 1954. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you may be speaking things into your own future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. &gt;&gt; So the pope we have today is a fulfillment of what the prophet said in 1954. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said that there'll be a woman that run the country. Already happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can take your pick. It's a dual prophet prophecy. Hallelujah. You can say the Catholic Church or you can say it's Kamla Harris. &gt;&gt; Already happened. H. You say, "Bro, she was never the president." I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. You say she was the vice president. You know, when Joe got sick, they had to swear somebody in to run the country. Who do they swear in? The vice president. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, in that moment, whether it was an hour, two hours, a week, a month, whatever it was, they swore her in as what? The leader of the country, &gt;&gt; fulfilled. &gt;&gt; You say it could be the it could be it could be it could be the Catholic Church. Hallelujah. When Joe, slow Job, hallelujah, when he was elected in as prophet, you know what he did? He had a Catholic mass where he went and bowed down to the pope, &gt;&gt; giving the Catholic church authority over the country. &gt;&gt; Already fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Prophecy will find us, church. &gt;&gt; These things are taking place. Well, you might not be paying attention to that. Well, let's look around. He said in Luke 17, it said, "Just like it was in the days of Noah. Just like it was in the days of Lot, the homosexuals got more rights than we got." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They they come picking they come pick at your restaurant or whatever, nobody say nothing. &gt;&gt; But as soon as you say something about them, it's bashing. It's hate crime. It's this. It's that. &gt;&gt; That's what Sodom and Gomorrah was all about. Read your Bible. God got tired of the filth. &gt;&gt; He got tired of all the things that were going on in Sodom. It says the couple of iniquity has reached up to God. And God said, "I'm going to destroy this place." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Homosexual demons. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Really? Are we in that day?" Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. And God has put people in position to fulfill prophecy. Hallelujah. It's found us. Hallelujah. Where did the homosexuals get all these rights from? Y'all black President Barack Obama. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Preacher, brother. &gt;&gt; And we like we got a black president. Yeah. We've overcome. Ding dong. The witch is dead. &gt;&gt; Don't realize it is every president, I don't care who you look at. Hallelujah. Every president is &gt;&gt; this, &gt;&gt; a puppet, &gt;&gt; to fulfill God's word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't about black or white. It was about Obama putting laws in place to bring Sodom a reality like the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Obama let the right Hallelujah. I think it was 2010. Yeah. Forgive me, brother. You know, he it was 2010. He he he he he put into action, don't ask, don't tell in the military. Hallelujah. Well, you could be a homosexual or a lesbian and still be a part of the military. Before that act, you couldn't be a homosexual or lesbian and be a part of the armed forces. &gt;&gt; But Obama came in and made it okay &gt;&gt; for men to shower with men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Women to love on women. Hallelujah. What was it? He said just like it was in the days of Sodom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then in 2014, he Hallelujah. He didn't create the act, but he agreed with the Supreme Court to allow same-sex marriages. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what happened in Obama's day in his term. Hallelujah. He was put in office. Why? To fulfill the prophecy of Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And now they have homosexual rights. A woman can marry a woman. A man can marry a man. You know what Obama said? They asked him say, "What do you say?" He said, he said, "Leave it up to every state. They can do whatever they want to do." He put that into action &gt;&gt; and we black president &gt;&gt; so much bigger than what we looking at. &gt;&gt; It's prophecy being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then after him, Hallelujah. Trump gets in office. Oh my god. Hallelujah. I ain't like most most black people. I ain't got nothing against him. Hallelujah. I actually like him cuz he's the most funniest president we ever had. I said, "Mr. Trump, what do you think about Joe? You think he'll be able to to draw a good audience?" Oh, no. All Joe draws his flies. The man's hilarious. I I don't care what nobody say. The man's hilarious. Hallelujah. I don't care about his politics, none of that. The man's hilarious. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Bible says that there will be pestilence in the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There'll be famines in the land in that end time. That's the prophecy. Famines and pestilence. You remember? Hallelujah. A while back, we had a famine of what? Eggs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Church, we're in this day, in this time. We had a famine of eggs also under his reign. Hallelujah. Back in his first term, the the Bible where it says pestilence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pestilence means plagues. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Under his term, we had one of the greatest plagues ever. What was it? COVID &gt;&gt; 19. &gt;&gt; Prophecy being fulfilled right before us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And you know what church if you really really paying attention. Hallelujah. What was CO all about? CO was the forerun. Hallelujah. The preview of the one world government. &gt;&gt; Yes. Very good. &gt;&gt; Because I traveled and wherever you went, everybody was under the same rules. &gt;&gt; Talk about those those seven continents. When I went to Australia, they had masks on. went to Canada, they had mask on. Went to Asia, they had mask on. Went to Europe, they had mask on. And you couldn't go certain places without what? A shot. &gt;&gt; One world government. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Didn't matter how much money you had, didn't matter what family you came from, didn't matter your religion. Everybody had to operate under these rules. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or be penalized. &gt;&gt; Yes. See, church, &gt;&gt; we're getting the preview of prophecy already. The fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many know what I'm saying? I'm not making this up. &gt;&gt; It's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, I've been places they wouldn't even let you in the store unless you showed them a vaccination. Delta wouldn't even let you fly if you if you ain't had a vaccination card. &gt;&gt; Certain countries wouldn't even let you in. Australia wouldn't even let you in. Forget the quarantine. They weren't even letting you in. Nobody can go out. Nobody can come in. Oh my. But just to say that, oh my, you know, it was a disease and you know, and all of a sudden it just happened. I beg your pardon. If it was something that just happened, something that just arised and wasn't created. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why did our president at the time, Trump, Hallelujah, when he got co everybody else quarantine 14 days or two weeks or two and a half weeks when he got it? No, no, I'm good. I'm good. I I don't need anything. I'm good. I'm good. His quarantine, hallelujah, was three to four days. &gt;&gt; And nothing happened to him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Cuz he had the secret. &gt;&gt; Secret wasn't some kind of potion. Remember, they never said there was a cure. Just take the shot. Hallelujah. I'm gonna leave this stuff alone, but I want to show you that we're in that day. &gt;&gt; We're in that time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where prophecy is being fulfilled. We see the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Fulfilling itself, coming out. One world government where everything's going to fall under this channel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't get caught out here saying, "Well, I don't I don't know if I really want to be a Christian. This is not the time to have that kind of mindset &gt;&gt; because if you can see the devil and all his tactics forming up, we see Sodom. Hallelujah. We see Noah's day. Hallelujah. We see families in the land. Hallelujah. There's still a war going on between Russia and and and Ukraine or wherever is at &gt;&gt; still going. That's in the Bible. Wars and rumors of wars. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's happening right now. Hallelujah. Every time America gets out of a war, they're trying to put them back in one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Bible says so wars and rumors of wars. Hallelujah. It say children will be disobedient to parents. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The love of many will wax cold. We seeing all these things. Hallelujah. Where loved ones are turning on each other, killing each other. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church in my old neighborhood. Hallelujah. A a son, hallelu, who was mentally challenged. He went in the house, killed his mama and his daddy and went to bed like nothing never happened. My oh my. We're in that time prophecies being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; But in my closing, this is what I'll say. We can agree that we see everything the devil is doing. &gt;&gt; We see Sodom, &gt;&gt; Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We see the famines in the land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We see the kingdoms of this world falling down. &gt;&gt; Wars and rumors of wars. &gt;&gt; Children disobedient to parents. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Men's hearts are failing for fear. &gt;&gt; One of the greatest spirits right now wrestling in the church is fear. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. People won't fully and and and this is such a sorry excuse, brother Jesse. People won't fully give their heart to God because they say, "Well, I ain't ready." And this is what they say. Here's what they say. I ain't ready yet. Cuz when I serve the Lord, I really want to do it. I ain't I ain't sought for the Holy Ghost yet. Cuz when I do it, I really want to serve God. I don't want to go back. Just go ahead and say you like living the life you living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just just just just stop playing games and just say you don't want to be a Christian yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and don't say, "Well, I when I do it, I really want to do it. I really want to serve God. You ain't going to never make your mind up to do that. &gt;&gt; God got to do it for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, it it'll it'll be none of us can keep ourselves. It's God keeping us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we're going to be tested and tried as long as we're here. But it's up to the Lord to keep us. &gt;&gt; It ain't up to me, Hallelujah. to prove God's a savior. It's up to God. &gt;&gt; It ain't up to me to prove he's a provider. It's up to God. It ain't up to me to prove he's a healer. It's up to God. His reputation is on the line. But I say all that to say this. We can see the mark of the beast. We can see the country being being led by people fulfilling, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; the end time prophecy. We can see Sodom and Gomorrah. We see all these things. We see the devils getting ready to come to full strength. The Bible says the devil will incarnate in that pope. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can see all these things taking place. So hallelujah. If we can see that, shouldn't we be able to see God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be able to see God stronger in our lives? &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be able to see prayers answered? &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be able to see a greater anointing in church? &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we see healings? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we see the fulfillment of grace, the fulfillment of love? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't our atmospheres in church bust through the darkness? Shouldn't there be more joy in the church, &gt;&gt; more love, more peace? &gt;&gt; If we can see the devil about to come to full strength, we should also be able to see God coming to full strength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We should be to a place where we pray our loved ones back in church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; If we can see the devil mounting up &gt;&gt; about to ride into the sunset, we should also see God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We should see the wings of a snow white dog. &gt;&gt; We should see that eagle anointing &gt;&gt; moving among his people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prophecy is not all about what the devil is doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church. Hallelujah. The end of this the end of this message is God said, "Hallelujah. In that day, I'm going to present to myself, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; a church without spot. Hallelujah. Without blemish, without wrinkle, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, sir. &gt;&gt; So, we can see all these other things going on. Shouldn't we see oursel being cleaned up? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we see ourselves getting The Bible says, hallelujah, his wife has made herself ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, I don't know about you, but I'm looking for God to do great things in my life. &gt;&gt; Great things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not praying small prayers anymore. He's a God that can do the impossible. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for the impossible to become possible. &gt;&gt; Because he promised it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He promised it, church. &gt;&gt; So if we see prophecy being fulfilled, there's a prophecy for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, hallelujah. In Isaiah, he said, "A virgin shall conceive." Hallelujah. That was 6 700 years out there in the air, &gt;&gt; but then it found the person that would fulfill it in Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That word was put out there. Hallelujah. But there was somebody to be the manifestation of that word and it was Mary. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah also said, hallelujah, there's a voice of one crying in the wilderness some 600, 700 years. And then here comes a John. Hallelujah. John looks so much like Christ. They say, John, who are you? He said, I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; What was he? Prophecy found him. He was the manifestation of what Isaiah prophesied. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are we? We are the manifestation of what William Brennham prophesied. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of Joel. &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of another book of acts. &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of Revelations 10. Hallelujah. 8 through 11. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Burnham has fulfilled his part. Now we got a part to play. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Musicians come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know this kind of felt like a Bible study, but don't take it light. &gt;&gt; Find out where you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. Glory. &gt;&gt; Just like there was a Goliath, there was a David to destroy Goliath. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good. &gt;&gt; And what I want you to realize, when Goliath was born, David was born in that time to challenge him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So whatever the enemy is doing in a particular time, there's a people born to resist it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a people born to defeat it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand, no matter what's going on in this world, you were born in a day to show that your God is real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My God is real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's Let's pray.

And that work, Lord, is to to make you visible, Lord, to be your hands, to be your eyes, to be your feet, to be your voice, to be your children, walk upon this earth in a dark time, to be the light of the world. Lord, we love you and we thank you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
