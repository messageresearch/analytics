[21:25] Ruler
[21:27] all
[21:29] praise the Lord let's take a few
[21:31] requests uh tonight by God's grace
[21:33] brother Kevin gave me a few
[21:35] requests uh he asked for prayer for a
[21:38] family they were going to a funeral
[21:39] tonight um a family had a young boy I
[21:42] think he was in the military children is
[21:44] that right do you remember and he got
[21:45] accidentally killed so they're praying
[21:47] for a a family that lost a young
[21:51] man so we pray for that
[21:53] family also he asked prayer um he asked
[21:57] for God would lead him to a job in
[22:00] Pennsylvania I guess it's right across
[22:02] the border or something like that you
[22:04] think that'd be a better job for
[22:06] him also I have um a Bible study Tuesday
[22:09] with that family and cople I just like
[22:11] ask you to keep that in prayer and the
[22:13] wife still wants to be baptized the
[22:14] husband's praying about it they're kind
[22:16] of waiting for warm weather and then
[22:18] like I said a little child one of the
[22:19] boys came up to me a fourth grader said
[22:22] his mom said his God's really to deal
[22:24] with him and he said he chose me to
[22:25] baptize him so I said okay you know a
[22:27] fourth grader was want to be baptized so
[22:29] I said we got to sit down and do a bible
[22:31] study on baptism so and then another
[22:34] gentleman like I told you this morning
[22:35] another gentleman he's in his 40s I
[22:36] think and he wants to be baptized too so
[22:39] there's three people that possibly would
[22:41] want to be baptized trusting that
[22:43] they'll go beyond baptism into
[22:44] sanctification amen and the Holy Ghost
[22:46] so numerous things to pray about are
[22:48] there anything else that uh we want pray
[22:50] for tonight anything
[22:52] else
[22:53] sister amen praise God let's pray for
[22:56] our sister hallelujah praise God
[23:00] anything
[23:02] else okay praise the Lord amen God is
[23:07] good let's take these knees before the
[23:08] Lord here let's just bow our heads and
[23:10] ask God to minister to each one of these
[23:12] Heavenly Father Lord God we come through
[23:14] the channel of prayer Lord we saw this
[23:16] morning Lord that prayer is such a help
[23:19] Lord to others when we enter into their
[23:21] sufferings as your Prophet said we need
[23:23] to feel it what the person's feeling
[23:26] when we pray for them so Lord tonight as
[23:28] we pray as I pray may we lord have the
[23:31] burden of the person behind the request
[23:33] Lord God we ask that Jesus we come
[23:36] through that blood Lord as we think
[23:38] about that song Through the blood we
[23:40] come in your presence it's through your
[23:42] sacrifice your goodness your Works your
[23:46] Deeds that we come tonight reverently
[23:48] forgive us of our sins Lord and I pray
[23:50] Lord hear our
[23:52] prayers dear Lord first I pray for the
[23:54] family that Kevin knows having a funeral
[23:57] for uh a son who died Lord accidentally
[24:00] father May the holy spirit guide them to
[24:02] be a light and a help and a witness dear
[24:04] God may he bring Comfort Lord through
[24:06] them Kevin and Marie to that family Lord
[24:09] Jesus be with them Lord he ask for
[24:11] prayer for a job Lord he's already got a
[24:13] job but he he would like this job just
[24:15] in the Pennsylvania border Lord I just
[24:17] pray you'd give him Grace to receive
[24:19] that job if it Be Your Will Lord God you
[24:22] know what he has need of Lord and I pray
[24:23] you'd help him dear God to find the
[24:25] right position he needs to be in with
[24:28] our sister Karen's unspoken request God
[24:30] Of Heaven God of Mercy the father of
[24:33] mercies I pray your hand of Mercy would
[24:34] reach down to our sister's request meet
[24:37] that need Lord God we know if we pray
[24:39] all things are possible we must only
[24:42] believe so we believe tonight knowing
[24:43] you can give our sister a touch Lord God
[24:46] answer to this request we ask that in
[24:49] Jesus name Lord and I pray for this
[24:51] bible study on Tuesday lord it's on
[24:53] repentance may you bring this family to
[24:55] True repentance dear God as I've I've
[24:57] cried this alar I plead this Altar for

[25:08] Bible study and may that husband want to
[25:09] be baptized too I pray the weather would
[25:12] warm Lord in your time and we could
[25:14] baptize all three individuals the the
[25:16] wife and then the husband and perhaps a
[25:19] fourth individual the husband would be
[25:21] the fourth but that young man I think
[25:23] his name is Wayne Lord that Wayne would
[25:25] be baptized soon and then the little boy
[25:26] Andrew Lord Jesus May these Hearts open
[25:29] to water baptism justification and to

[31:02] let's go to Psalms chapter 14 verse one
[31:05] like I said this morning I like to
[31:06] preach on the fool has said there is no
[31:09] God I want to look at these proofs of
[31:11] God uh that are in science and brother
[31:13] brandom's proofs from his
[31:15] stories and from scripture as well by
[31:18] God's
[31:22] grace it seems like all my Christian
[31:24] life I've just one always been wanted to
[31:26] answer somebody this is proof that God
[31:28] exists you know so this sermon has been
[31:30] on my heart a long time long time and I
[31:33] think I can get it's probably two parts
[31:35] I probably won't be able to finish
[31:36] tonight I'm going to check the the timer
[31:38] set the timer
[31:39] rather to make sure I don't strain my
[31:42] voice and things like that uh Psalms
[31:46] 14:1 appreciate everybody coming out to
[31:48] the house of the Lord tonight that could
[31:49] make it by God's grace brother Ram was
[31:51] here I'd be in church tonight wouldn't
[31:53] you I always use that as my leadership
[31:56] and guiding you know if brother r was
[31:58] here how would I act that's how I'd act
[32:00] I'd go to church with him praise God but
[32:02] he's not here in the flesh but the holy
[32:05] spirit is here amen so Psalms 14
[32:08] verse1 to the chief musician a Psalm of
[32:11] David the fool has said in his heart
[32:13] there is no God they are corrupt they
[32:16] have done abominal works there is none
[32:19] that doeth good the Lord lookth down
[32:21] from heaven upon the children of men to
[32:23] seek if there were any that did
[32:26] understand and seek God and we'll close
[32:28] with verse or finish with verse three
[32:29] they are all gone aside they are all
[32:31] together become filthy there's none that
[32:34] doeth good know not one amen let's have
[32:37] a word of prayer let's just bow our
[32:38] heads one more time Father in heaven we
[32:40] thank you for this word Lord God we know
[32:42] you're real lord even demons know you're
[32:44] real Lord God and we're thankful that
[32:46] you're real thank you that you've made
[32:47] yourself real to us you haven't blinded
[32:50] us like you blinded Israel Lord God but
[32:52] the Gentiles now can have eyes that are
[32:55] illuminated the Bible says oh Lord thank
[32:57] thank you for the ice Sal of the holy
[32:59] spirit that we can see that you're alive
[33:01] today you're interested in our lives and
[33:03] Lord You've committed Our Lives to your
[33:05] word we've committed ourselves to you
[33:07] Lord and we thank you God for your
[33:09] purpose in our lives take this night and
[33:11] just bless this message to the hearts of
[33:13] the people it's been such a blessing to
[33:15] meet Lord and I just pray it we just sit
[33:18] in Heavenly places here tonight enjoying
[33:19] your word in Jesus Christ's name and
[33:21] everybody said amen God bless you uh so
[33:25] let's look at this thought tonight the
[33:27] full said it there is no
[33:32] God so I have about like I said I found
[33:35] a I've just been listening you know over
[33:36] and over as I listen to these sermons
[33:38] where the ram tells stories about
[33:39] meeting infidels and things like that
[33:41] and you probably heard them how many
[33:43] have the supernatural books does
[33:44] everybody have the supernatural books
[33:45] that Owen Jenson okay we've loved those
[33:48] and we've listened to those quite a bit
[33:49] maai can you switch over and a couple of
[33:51] these came from remembrance so I'm going
[33:53] to read through those and uh I know
[33:55] they'll be a blessing to you I want to
[33:56] go through some scriptures first by the
[33:58] grace of the
[34:00] Lord and uh we'll start there in Psalms
[34:02] 14 it's a real good uh real good thought
[34:06] by the grace of the
[34:07] Lord so the fool said there is no
[34:11] God now the Bible said the fool said in
[34:13] his heart there is no God now the word
[34:15] fool means senseless and that's kind of
[34:17] as you get in the the science realm of
[34:19] things uh when the atheist says there is
[34:22] no God they're literally denying what
[34:24] the senses tell them and that makes them
[34:27] an Absol absolute fool because they're
[34:29] denying their senses they're denying
[34:31] data they're denying observations
[34:33] they're denying the reality they God
[34:35] gave us so that's really uh why God
[34:38] calls him a fool because they don't they
[34:40] refuse to use the five senses that they
[34:42] so claim to use right scientists claim
[34:45] to use all the five senses the
[34:46] scientific method and yet they deny it
[34:49] when it points to a Creator so uh that's
[34:52] why God calls them fools so we can I've
[34:55] I've sat with Austin and I've looked
[34:57] across theable table at our friend Bell
[34:59] and I've said you know not to offend you
[35:01] but the Bible calls you a fool for being
[35:02] an atheist remember when I told him that
[35:03] the first time we met him and he didn't
[35:06] I said I'm not defend you but that's
[35:07] just what the Bible says um so we have
[35:10] to say what the Bible says and God's
[35:12] word is true God always back up his word
[35:14] his word will never fail so we're
[35:15] thankful that we get to use our senses
[35:17] and find God now that's the scripture we
[35:19] had earlier now here's the one I
[35:21] mentioned in prayer thou believest there
[35:23] is one God thou doest well the demons
[35:25] also believe and tremble so it's got to
[35:28] be more than just an intellectual belief
[35:30] it's got to be a revelation and that's
[35:32] why we know a lot of churches today that
[35:33] preach water down Doctrine they say they
[35:35] believe in God but do they even tremble
[35:37] at the word no the word says don't
[35:39] commit adultery they don't tremble at
[35:41] that the word says a woman should have
[35:42] long hair they don't tremble at that
[35:44] they don't tremble at the word but yet
[35:46] they say they believe so it's an
[35:48] intellectual belief it's not a
[35:50] revelation hasn't gone down to the heart
[35:52] yet now I just want to show how the real
[35:54] science that God approves of uses the
[35:57] senses because remember a fool he's
[35:59] senseless he don't use any of his senses
[36:01] he denies his senses so God certainly
[36:04] approves of science that's real
[36:06] science uh Mariam Webster says science
[36:09] is the knowledge or system of knowledge
[36:11] covering General truths or the operation
[36:13] of general laws especially has obtained
[36:15] and tested through scientific methods so
[36:17] I teach first grade so basically what
[36:19] they say they kind of they kind of break
[36:21] this down just to the scientific method
[36:22] they say teach the children in science
[36:25] basically teach them the scientific
[36:26] method and the scientific method of
[36:28] course is uh principles or procedures
[36:31] for the systematic pursuit of knowledge
[36:34] and it involves I'm just going to skip
[36:35] to the yell involves the collection of
[36:37] data through observation and experiment
[36:40] and the formulation and testing of
[36:42] hypotheses so you have to you have to in
[36:45] order to be real science you got to be
[36:46] able to test it over and over and it's
[36:48] got to be repeated and it's got to be
[36:49] observed through the senses right but
[36:52] atheist says denies all the senses they
[36:54] deny everything they see and read and uh
[36:57] so that makes them a fool they're
[36:59] senseless okay now God of course loves
[37:02] science God bless Daniel haniah Michel
[37:06] and Azariah you know God blessed them
[37:08] the Bible said they were under they were
[37:10] those that understood science so God's
[37:13] not against science as long as it's real
[37:15] science praise
[37:17] God uh false science does not use the
[37:19] senses as we said and Tim Paul wrote to
[37:22] Timothy about this Paul was the prophet
[37:24] Paul was not against science either the
[37:26] Bible said oh Timothy keep that which is
[37:28] committed to thy trust avoid profane and
[37:31] Vain babblings and oppositions of
[37:35] science falsely so-called so he knew
[37:38] there would be people that would have
[37:39] science and would come against real
[37:41] science but uh science but they're
[37:44] falsely called science they're not
[37:45] really science so they are false science
[37:48] which some professing have ear
[37:50] concerning the faith Grace be with thee
[37:53] amen so see that's obviously scripture
[37:56] brother Bram talked about science all
[37:58] the time all the books and Popular
[37:59] Mechanics I don't have many quotes on
[38:01] that but I know I've heard him say that
[38:03] now I want to just switch over to some
[38:05] Bible Club slides these are the slides I
[38:07] used last year when I taught on proof of
[38:09] Creator at bible Club here and I'm going
[38:12] to skip ahead to the ones we started at
[38:14] so here's what I was teaching at the
[38:15] Bible club with the kids in other words
[38:17] stay away from false science teachings
[38:19] that are not facts things that cannot
[38:22] you cannot observe and see so if you
[38:25] can't observe it or see it it's a lie
[38:27] right it's that's not real science for
[38:28] example I told the kids Evolution uh
[38:31] they say man came from an ape well
[38:33] that's false we know that's false uh
[38:36] because that's not true science who is
[38:38] there to observe that nobody can we do
[38:42] experiments today to prove monkeys turn
[38:43] into men can we do that is there any
[38:46] data or any tests or what we can do over
[38:48] and over again and get th that fact of
[38:50] course not so this is not true science
[38:54] no because the Bible said the Lord God
[38:56] formed man
[38:58] now I was with the kids and I said' now
[39:00] to be fair you know none of us were able
[39:02] to observe god making man like none of
[39:04] us were there right uh and we cannot do
[39:07] experiments that prove God created man
[39:08] like I can't do an experiment and show
[39:10] you like God created Adam I can't do
[39:12] that
[39:13] today uh but all the scientiic facts we
[39:17] observe and all the experiments we do
[39:20] lead to us lead us to know that all the
[39:22] energy and life in the universe came
[39:24] from somewhere or someone
[39:27] because and I'm not I'm I'm not ready to
[39:29] preach this uh today but if you uh start
[39:32] studying a little bit on science and the
[39:34] be the the the beginning of the universe
[39:36] you'll find that scientists now believe
[39:38] the universe had a beginning and the
[39:40] universe is filled with energy and so
[39:43] they know there had to be something even
[39:45] more powerful than all the energy in the
[39:47] universe to create all that energy in
[39:50] the universe so there had to be
[39:52] something more powerful to create all
[39:54] the power and energy in the
[39:56] universe and so atheist say well that's
[39:58] that's the nothing that's actually
[40:00] something because they said everything
[40:01] came from nothing so they say all where
[40:03] wherever that all this energy came from
[40:05] in this system that we call the universe
[40:06] wherever this came from that's the
[40:08] nothing that uh everything came from so
[40:12] they said so the chrisan say so you're
[40:14] saying the nothing is a something and
[40:16] they say yes so see it's senseless there
[40:19] there's no sense to that for something
[40:21] to create something it's got to be
[40:22] something
[40:24] right right so I'm just going to lay
[40:27] this down here just briefly I just want
[40:29] to go through that so see everything we
[40:31] look to and this what the Bible actually
[40:33] says is God makes himself known to all
[40:35] men the Bible says that but the Bible
[40:37] said God gives knowledge to every man
[40:39] that he's alive and he's he is the real
[40:41] power of the universe which we'll get to
[40:43] that Romans 1 in a little bit so why is
[40:45] evolution false this is good for Lydia
[40:48] and Sarah and all the Malachi and the
[40:49] little ones well the first reason it's
[40:51] false there's no known observable
[40:54] process by which new genetic information
[40:56] can be added to the genetic code of any
[40:58] living thing nothing can new nothing new
[41:02] can be added uh but there's a lot of
[41:04] genetics that that can have uh that can
[41:06] uh Express themselves what's in what's
[41:09] called adaptation with you know Darwin's
[41:11] finches and everything like that their
[41:12] beaks would change and I'm not ready to
[41:14] preach on that yet but I've been reading
[41:16] about that that genetic code to change a
[41:19] beak is already in the finch it's
[41:21] already there nothing's being added to
[41:23] it uh there's no nothing's evolving it's
[41:26] just addap ation inside the the the
[41:29] creature itself that God created so
[41:32] again so a ape cannot gradually change
[41:34] into a man because it cannot add to the
[41:37] genetic information inside of itself it
[41:38] can never add to it whatever it's got at
[41:41] the beginning that's what it's got and
[41:43] Sciences prove that even a little baby
[41:45] in the womb of her mother a little baby
[41:47] girl has all of the egg she'll ever have
[41:50] already in the womb before she's even
[41:52] born so it's see it's already set it's
[41:54] already finished you cannot add to that
[41:58] God and God said it's finished right all
[41:59] the creation was already finished so it
[42:01] works out
[42:03] perfectly amen so the genetic
[42:06] information inside of being is all it
[42:07] will ever have you cannot add the
[42:09] genetic information to change it so
[42:12] here's another thing uh there are no
[42:14] known examples or observable examples of
[42:16] evolution right
[42:18] now for example can anyone show me a cat
[42:20] that is almost evolved into a lion or
[42:23] how about a monkey that's almost
[42:24] involved into a man there's no because
[42:27] God said it's finished nothing's
[42:28] changing nothing's turning into
[42:30] something else it's already finished
[42:32] because God put a stamp of approval upon
[42:34] it and said it's good amen it's good
[42:36] it's already good it's already
[42:38] finished number two why is evolution
[42:40] false there's no known observable
[42:42] process by which life came from
[42:46] non-life Life only comes from Life okay
[42:50] so that's another thing atheists say
[42:51] well life came from non-life that's
[42:54] impossible life only comes from Life
[42:56] Energy only comes from more energy right
[42:58] you have to have a source of energy
[43:00] before you can have energy so false
[43:02] science says life came out of non-life
[43:05] so this is a you know of course a
[43:07] timeline you know from a we'd say from a
[43:10] atheist or something like that some say
[43:12] the cells formed four billion years ago
[43:14] by chance so these are billions and
[43:16] billions here it says billions of years
[43:17] old they just you know they they're just
[43:19] making guesses but again who observed
[43:21] any of that did anybody observe any of
[43:23] that can we test that today no then
[43:26] you're not following the scientific
[43:27] method then it's not science it's
[43:29] religion so an atheist is living by
[43:32] false religion of course right now just
[43:35] a few more here and then we'll get back
[43:36] to the the sermons and stories so number
[43:40] two life only comes from Life the law of
[43:43] reproduction that's what God said in
[43:45] Genesis 1 11 and 12 God said let the
[43:49] Earth bring forth grass the herb
[43:50] yielding sealed and the fruit tree
[43:53] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[43:55] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[43:57] so praise God so God designed it life
[44:00] only comes from life so where did you
[44:03] get your life from God Almighty your
[44:06] spiritual life I'm not and your natural
[44:08] life but your spiritual life as well
[44:09] that had to come from a seed it had to
[44:11] come from God it come from God's eternal
[44:13] spirit amen now I moved on there uh I'm
[44:17] gon to skip ahead a little bit I found
[44:19] some archaeology remember last year they
[44:20] found hezekiah's seal they saw they
[44:22] found the Seal of the king there in
[44:24] Israel last year that was pretty
[44:25] wonderful CNN reported on that
[44:28] um and some of the wisest and most
[44:30] respected scientists of all time
[44:32] believed in God did you know that only a
[44:35] fool would not believe in God right
[44:38] that's what God Said now all these I
[44:40] looked up this is a infographic you know
[44:42] that I found online but I went and
[44:45] looked up all these guys in uh the
[44:47] online dictionary and there're it's all
[44:50] true like everything on this infograph
[44:51] is true so you can't trust every
[44:53] infograph but you got to go back and
[44:55] study it out so Galileo let's look at
[44:57] Galileo and then we'll look at well I
[44:59] don't think I got to Johannes ke I don't
[45:00] think but I know I got to Newton I'm
[45:01] pretty sure I got to Newton yes here's
[45:04] Galileo he lived from
[45:06] 1564 to
[45:08] 1642 he made legendary discoveries in
[45:11] the study of motion observables
[45:13] observational science astronomy through
[45:15] the use of the telescope and how the Sun
[45:17] is the center of the solar
[45:19] system and let's see what did he say I'm
[45:21] going to go back to that what did he say
[45:23] pardon me he said uh mathematics is the
[45:27] alphabet with which God has written the
[45:29] universe amen remember brother ra said
[45:32] God is in the numerology I like to
[45:34] preach a sermon on that too I've started
[45:36] a file where I've listed all the numbers
[45:37] and when I when I find numbers in the
[45:39] Bible I try to plug them in there and
[45:40] one day I like to preach a full message
[45:42] on that Lord
[45:43] willing Isaac Newton said yeah I didn't
[45:46] get to Johannes but I get to Isaac
[45:47] Newton I found him gravity explains the
[45:49] Motions of the planets but it cannot
[45:51] explain who set the planets in motion I
[45:53] like that God governs all things and
[45:56] knows all that is or can be
[45:59] done Newton actually was a real he was
[46:02] like a kind like a part-time Theologian
[46:03] I don't know if you knew that but that's
[46:04] in the history too so let's look at that
[46:06] let me go past him again I'll kind of
[46:08] skip
[46:09] ahead okay Aristotle yeah he wasn't on
[46:12] my infog graphic was he okay he lived
[46:14] from 384 to 322 boy short life uh
[46:18] legendary scientist and philosopher who
[46:20] believed in God most universities still
[46:22] study as teaching I did when I was in
[46:23] school at acru he wrote that the best
[46:27] form of philosophy is thinking about the
[46:28] universe and nature this was the reason
[46:30] God gave man Godlike intelligence was to
[46:34] have wisdom or philosophy God wanted you
[46:37] to think about God wanted you to think
[46:39] about uh all these things and have the
[46:42] wisdom in the of the universe and to be
[46:44] able to you know live the right kind of
[46:46] life now Isaac Newton he was a he was a
[46:48] lightweight
[46:50] Theologian by God's grace 1642 to 1727
[46:54] legendary
[46:55] physicist and mathematician who started
[46:58] the Scientific Revolution of the 17th
[47:00] century he made amazing discoveries in
[47:02] Optics which is a study of light
[47:04] mechanics motion physics which is the
[47:06] law of gravitation and
[47:08] calculus uh and then this yeah this is
[47:11] this is actually on the britanica he
[47:12] spent years of his life studying the
[47:14] godhead did you know that I didn't know
[47:15] that father son Holy Ghost and the
[47:18] Prophecies of Daniel and St John The
[47:20] Book of Revelation he has all kinds of
[47:22] letters and pamphlets that he wrote
[47:24] trying to study prophecy and understand
[47:26] the Bible don't you love that one of the
[47:28] smartest most scientific men the
[47:30] history's ever known they still read him
[47:32] today in the
[47:33] universities and he was a believer in
[47:35] the Bible amen just thought I'd uh
[47:38] encourage you with that here's a new man
[47:39] you never might never seen before I
[47:41] found him while I was studying some
[47:42] YouTube videos and I thought well let me
[47:43] see if that's legit let me go look him
[47:45] up but it actually was his name is
[47:47] Anthony flu now he passed away in 2010
[47:51] he's a famous former atheist philosopher
[47:54] and I guess he was really staunch
[47:55] atheist for many years who fought the
[47:57] belief in God for most of his life six
[47:59] years before his death his heart changed
[48:00] and he publicly stated he believed in
[48:02] God due to the complexity of human
[48:06] DNA he actually wrote it in his
[48:09] book in 2006 he joined other scientists
[48:11] who urg British Prime Minister Tony
[48:13] Blair to introduce intelligent design to
[48:15] Britain's Public
[48:17] Schools I thought that was pretty
[48:19] powerful so DNA Le has has led a couple
[48:23] scientists to be Believers in God I've
[48:25] read about that and I got a few of them
[48:26] out we have to research later I have to
[48:28] research more and show you later but
[48:29] these are the ones I got a chance to
[48:31] research last year do you like that by
[48:33] God's grace isn't it is encouraging to
[48:35] see that some of the smartest scientific
[48:37] men ever all believed in God they
[48:39] weren't fools they believed their senses
[48:42] and they realize all this information
[48:44] all this creation points to God
[48:47] Amen okay so I'm gonna stop right there
[48:49] because I had now I showed the kids a
[48:51] video I got a video here of LeBron James
[48:53] they asked LeBron James last year and
[48:54] the kids were laughing they asked him
[48:56] said hey when when uh I forget which
[48:59] player on the team when he gets back
[49:00] from his injuries is everything going to
[49:01] be all right and he said uh he said no
[49:04] he said you can he said there's only one
[49:06] person you can Bank on he said that's
[49:08] Jesus
[49:09] Christ now I know he don't live a good
[49:11] life because he cusses and all kinds of
[49:12] things like that but even someone as F I
[49:15] was telling the kids even if someone as
[49:16] famous as him is not a fool he knows
[49:18] there's a God and listen he's got to
[49:20] answer to God we've all got to answer to
[49:22] God so I just thought that would be an
[49:23] encouragement to the kids there they
[49:24] really like that but uh remember all
[49:27] these wise men these smart men they all
[49:29] believed in God okay now let me get back
[49:32] to
[49:35] here now I think I'll kind of go through
[49:37] this kind of quickly because I uh uh
[49:40] last year I preached on the lean Church
[49:41] age and one of the sermons I talked
[49:43] about blindness you might remember it
[49:45] let me make that larger and I spent a
[49:47] little bit of time in Romans 1 and two
[49:50] uh proving that God can judge everybody
[49:53] because they're all they're all
[49:55] accountable to God's creation
[49:57] for the wrath of God is revealed from
[49:59] Heaven against all ungodliness and
[50:00] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[50:02] truth in
[50:04] unrighteousness because that which may
[50:06] be known of God now listen is appearing
[50:09] or manifesting in them for God has
[50:13] showed it unto
[50:15] them so God I'll just here's what's my
[50:19] notes God has shown the knowledge of
[50:21] himself to each man and this knowledge
[50:23] appears and is recognized in them so
[50:26] every person can look at their body and
[50:27] say there must be a God God there's some
[50:30] knowledge of God
[50:31] somewhere right that's what the Bible
[50:33] says God has shown this to every man and
[50:37] it's in you it's in them and that's what
[50:39] the scientists can't explain they asked
[50:41] Bill NY the Science Guy they asked him
[50:42] had a debate with Ken Ham a couple years
[50:45] ago they said they said okay you try to
[50:47] explain where uh matter comes from where
[50:50] does uh where does the Mind where does
[50:52] the mental state come from he's like we
[50:53] don't know that science can't explain
[50:56] that
[50:57] because they said uh that the spiritual
[51:00] can't come from the physical in other
[51:01] words uh that did not evolve the the the
[51:04] mental state of man could not evolve so
[51:06] they have no answers for that but what
[51:08] is God showing God's showing them this
[51:11] that he has made it plain to everybody
[51:13] that there is a God somewhere because
[51:15] they can look at their own bodies their
[51:17] own minds they can't explain how this
[51:18] all happened so God proves it to
[51:21] everybody that he's real amen that's his
[51:23] knowledge Hallelujah now verse 20 lays
[51:26] it out a little bit clear for the
[51:28] invisible things of him from the
[51:30] creation of the world are clearly seen
[51:32] my being understood by the things that
[51:35] are
[51:35] made even his eternal power and godhead
[51:38] so that they are without excuse there'll
[51:40] be nobody here within any excuse right
[51:43] I'm not without excuse every man has no
[51:45] excuse because God has shown invisible
[51:48] things through the things that are
[51:50] seen all
[51:52] creation Now I'm going to skip ahead
[51:54] here so verse 20 it said the eternal
[51:56] power and godhead are clearly seen as
[51:58] they are understood by creation or
[51:59] nature the presence of nature or
[52:02] creation leaves all men without excuse
[52:04] on the day of judgment that's right now
[52:07] see the Bible said now two verses later
[52:09] the Bible said they professed themselves
[52:11] to be wise they became what fools oh
[52:14] we're so smart we there is no Creator
[52:16] and the Bible literally instantly called
[52:18] them fools because you're denying your
[52:19] senses you're denying the creation and
[52:22] even as they did not like to retain God
[52:24] in their knowledge see they didn't want
[52:25] they didn't want God's word in their
[52:27] minds because they knew they were guilty
[52:28] of breaking the commands of God God gave
[52:31] them over to reprobate mind to do those
[52:33] things which are not
[52:35] convenient now here's the one that I
[52:37] really liked uh Romans
[52:39] 2 it's 1 through 16 but for time sake
[52:42] I'm just going to read a few of these
[52:44] here for there is no respect of persons
[52:47] with God for as many have sinned without
[52:49] the law shall also perish without the
[52:51] law and as many have have sinned in the
[52:53] law shall be judged by the law so see if
[52:56] people didn't have the law of Moses they
[52:58] would still perish without the law for
[53:00] not the hearers of the law are just
[53:02] before God but the doers of the law
[53:05] shall be
[53:06] justified for when the Gentiles which
[53:09] have not the law do by Nature the things
[53:12] contain the law these having not the law
[53:14] are law unto themselves now that's where
[53:16] we get this thought where you can go to
[53:19] Every culture and you find murders wrong
[53:21] you go to Every culture lying stealing
[53:23] is wrong why because God wrote the law
[53:25] in their conscience amen right so see
[53:29] even if you don't know the law of Moses
[53:30] even if you don't know the law of God
[53:32] you have a something inside of you
[53:33] telling you there needs to be
[53:35] laws because you can observe all the
[53:37] laws of nature right and also the laws
[53:39] of the spiritual
[53:40] realm which show the work of the law
[53:43] written in their hearts see the the law
[53:45] of God is written in their hearts they
[53:46] know better their conscience also Bears
[53:49] witness and the their thoughts the mean
[53:52] while excusing or else excusing one
[53:54] another I'm sorry accusing or else
[53:55] excusing
[53:58] in the day when God shall judge the
[53:59] secrets of men by Jesus Christ according
[54:01] to my gospel so do you remember that
[54:03] when I preached on that does anybody
[54:04] remember that from last year I don't
[54:05] know if you did or not but see the the
[54:08] law is already in their hearts people
[54:10] will have no excuse before God because
[54:12] God put the law right in there and he
[54:14] showed them through nature uh all his
[54:17] power and godhead are seen clearly by
[54:20] what we see out in nature praise God
[54:22] let's go through a through few stories
[54:23] about the prophet of God proving God
[54:25] would you like that would you like to
[54:26] hear that oh I think they're really I
[54:28] think you'll really enjoy these you
[54:29] probably heard them before I'm not sure
[54:31] Austin has uh I don't know yeah I'm not
[54:34] sure my children I think we might have
[54:36] heard them uh I know I have of course
[54:38] but okay here's the one about the
[54:40] Kentucky Infidel in nature remember this
[54:43] one he went with Mr wood with banks wood
[54:46] he went to this this man in Kentucky he
[54:48] says Mr wood and I are coming home we
[54:50] drove down the mountains in Kentucky
[54:51] little country where I had been at the
[54:53] Methodist campgrounds down there a place
[54:55] called active
[54:57] just one grocery store filling station
[54:59] and Campground and it's called Acton
[55:00] Kentucky the little place has a post
[55:03] office its own in the
[55:05] store all right and I think I forgot to
[55:07] set my timer I just put on 30 minutes
[55:10] okay because I don't know how long I've
[55:11] been preaching
[55:14] okay I had a meeting there and it looked
[55:16] to me like a good squirrel hunting
[55:17] country so I want to go back down and Mr
[55:19] wood said brother brand I know where
[55:21] there's a man who's got about five or
[55:23] six hundred acres and has got Hills and
[55:25] Hollows
[55:27] I'm going to jump a little bit it'd be
[55:28] wet we could walk in the creek bottom
[55:30] wouldn't scare them he's an Infidel well
[55:32] I said let's go try him I said maybe we
[55:34] better go but if you know him I better
[55:36] set in the car he said all right so he
[55:40] got out and walked around and said how
[55:41] do you do he said my name's wood he said
[55:44] my name is bankswood he said oh I just
[55:45] wonder if it'd be possible if we could
[55:47] hunt here a a little while said we've
[55:50] been hunting over here on another Creek
[55:52] he said' it's dry over there we can't
[55:53] hunt he said are you Jim Woods boy now
[55:56] his father was a reader in the Jehovah's
[55:57] Witnesses he's one of the readers say
[55:59] honest very fine man he said I'm his son
[56:02] he said well Jim Wood is one of the most
[56:04] honest people I've ever met said you
[56:06] just have your choice huh anywhere you
[56:08] want to I said thank you sir I brought
[56:10] my pastor along I guess it's all right
[56:12] for him to go and I look what this old
[56:14] man
[56:16] says he said you don't mean you got so
[56:18] low down you have to carry a preacher
[56:20] around with you everywhere you
[56:22] go I thought I better get out so I got
[56:24] out the car this brother B talking and
[56:26] walked around and said' how do you do he
[56:28] said 'ow do you do he said OU know I
[56:30] guess I'm kind of hard against guys like
[56:31] you fellas I said 'well every man to his
[56:34] thought yeah I just wanted to hunt so I
[56:37] guess you can every fellow to his own
[56:39] thought he said yes there's nothing I
[56:42] have against you but just one thing
[56:44] you're barking up the wrong tree how
[56:46] many knows what that means a lion dog
[56:48] you see barking the is here when
[56:50] he's gone there ain't a up there
[56:53] see he said well I've been on this
[56:55] country here here that old chimney up
[56:57] there is where the original home burned
[56:58] about 60 years ago my father built this
[57:00] place I've lived here walked over these
[57:02] places I'm 76 years old I've never seen
[57:05] no God no angel no nothing
[57:08] else therefore there isn't none look how
[57:11] brother BR handles it well of course
[57:13] that's still to your
[57:15] opinion I said was you ever in church he
[57:18] said no I don't believe in going there
[57:20] was one fellow one time that come in
[57:21] here about two years ago from Indiana I
[57:24] had a place over there they had a
[57:25] meeting the meth's campgrounds I forget
[57:27] the guy's name if I ever meet him I want
[57:29] to talk to
[57:30] him he said wait he lives up here on the
[57:33] ridge by the name of something she was
[57:35] dying with
[57:36] cancer her we had her out to Louisville
[57:39] to the cancer specialist and they tried
[57:41] to operate it was in the stomach and she
[57:43] said she was so wound up through her
[57:46] stomach and intestinal tract they
[57:48] couldn't even wash her with an anema or
[57:50] enema and they just brought her home to
[57:53] die and said she gotten so low till they
[57:55] couldn't put her on the bed pan no more
[57:57] just had to use the draw sheet said wife
[58:00] and I would go up twice a day change
[58:01] your bed she was
[58:04] dying and then he said this preacher was
[58:06] over here at Acton he was there for two
[58:08] nights and he said her sister lives down
[58:10] there another Creek about 30 miles below
[58:12] she went up there that night and said
[58:14] the man never was in this country before
[58:17] and he said he was standing on the
[58:18] platform looked out across about 1500
[58:20] people and said a lady there by the name
[58:23] of such and such when you left home
[58:25] tonight you put a little white
[58:26] handkerchief in your pocket you got off
[58:28] a marble toop dresser and it's got a
[58:31] little blue working in the corner you
[58:33] got a sister named so and so that's
[58:35] dying with cancer go take that
[58:37] handkerchief and put it on the sister
[58:39] for thus sayi the Lord she shall
[58:42] live and said about 11 o'clock in the
[58:44] night I thought that they had the
[58:46] Salvation up Army up there on the top of
[58:48] the hill of all the noise and said it
[58:51] woke me up I said to my wife well she
[58:54] died and so tomorrow morning I'll get my
[58:56] wagon to take her out the only way you
[58:58] could get where she lived we'd have to
[59:00] bring her out to where you could get her
[59:02] to the car with the wagon said I'll just
[59:04] wait till the morning and said we'll go
[59:06] get her and bring her out but he said
[59:08] the next morning wife and I got up early
[59:10] to go out there and what did we find
[59:12] when we went in but she was eating fried
[59:14] apple pies at the table with her husband
[59:17] and said she's up there now she don't
[59:19] only do her own work but she does her
[59:21] neighbor's work and I thought uhoh here
[59:24] it is and I said ow you don't believe
[59:27] that look at brother brandom the the
[59:30] infidels telling brother brandom about
[59:32] brother bram's
[59:35] Ministry and brother Ram's like oh you
[59:37] don't believe that story do you and he
[59:39] said well if you don't believe it go up
[59:41] and see for yourself brother said look
[59:42] now the Infidel is preaching to
[59:44] [Laughter]
[59:46] me said how I went to ask that man how
[59:49] did he know that that woman was up there
[59:52] he never was in the country before she
[59:54] was dying with cancer how did she know
[59:56] or how did he know she was dying with
[59:58] cancer how did he know her name and how
[1:00:00] did he know that was her sister how did
[1:00:02] he know that she was going to get well
[1:00:04] when that handkerchief was put on her
[1:00:05] said I want to talk to him when I see
[1:00:07] him I said I hope you
[1:00:11] do so he turned around it was for about
[1:00:13] about the middle of August it's red real
[1:00:15] hot and the leaves beginning to fall in
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:18] trees and brother Bram said you mind if
[1:00:21] I have one of them apples and he said oh
[1:00:23] the yellow jackets are eating them how
[1:00:25] knows what a Yellow Jack is so they're
[1:00:26] eating them you might as well I said
[1:00:29] strange thing you notice we haven't even
[1:00:31] had a frost we haven't had a cool spell
[1:00:33] or nothing and yet all those leaves are
[1:00:35] dropping off the tree I said I wonder
[1:00:37] why that is he said well the life left
[1:00:40] the leaf and now brother bram's gonna
[1:00:42] get into proving God so now listen
[1:00:45] carefully a leaf h a tree losing his
[1:00:49] Leaf can help you prove God did you know
[1:00:50] that that's true I said the life left
[1:00:53] the leaf he said yes I said where did it
[1:00:56] go he said down in the root of a tree oh
[1:01:00] I said what' to go down there for he
[1:01:03] saidwell to keep out of the winter said
[1:01:05] you see it gets about 20 below zero here
[1:01:08] if that life was up in the tree the life
[1:01:10] would die it's got to go down into the
[1:01:12] root I said oh I see uhhuh I went to ask
[1:01:15] you a question you know that tree don't
[1:01:17] have any intelligence because it's just
[1:01:18] a tree a part of botney life I said
[1:01:22] whatat kind of intelligence tells it
[1:01:24] before the frost Falls get out of there
[1:01:26] right
[1:01:28] quick so what intelligence is telling
[1:01:31] the sap to go down to the roots brother
[1:01:33] manam said run down the route and hide
[1:01:35] if you don't you're GNA die what
[1:01:37] intelligence does that well he said
[1:01:40] that's just
[1:01:41] nature I said well I'll tell you he said
[1:01:44] take a bucket of water and set it on the
[1:01:46] post out there in August and let me see
[1:01:48] all that water run down the bottom of
[1:01:50] the post and then come back again this
[1:01:51] spring so brother man is very this very
[1:01:54] uh inspired thought
[1:01:56] if sap sap has to run down on an
[1:01:58] intelligence right just like water if
[1:02:01] you put water on the top of a post and
[1:02:02] give it a a plastic line to go down it's
[1:02:04] not going to go down on its own right
[1:02:07] that's what brother R saying the sap
[1:02:09] can't go down on its own something's got
[1:02:10] to move it down there just like the
[1:02:12] water has to be it would have to be
[1:02:14] moved down there water doesn't move on
[1:02:16] its own does ever understand that he
[1:02:19] said oh I hadn't thought of that and I
[1:02:22] said you think of that he said you think
[1:02:24] of that while I go World hunting and
[1:02:26] then when I come back if you will tell
[1:02:28] me what intelligence tells that sap in
[1:02:31] that tree that life go down in the roots
[1:02:33] and hide till spring then come back
[1:02:36] again when you find out what
[1:02:38] intelligence works that life up and down
[1:02:40] through that tree at the seasons I'll
[1:02:43] tell you what intelligence told me that
[1:02:46] woman was gonna be
[1:02:47] healed Glory he said told you yes sir he
[1:02:52] said you're not that preacher he said I
[1:02:54] said' I'm brother brandom he said ' can
[1:02:56] you prove it sure I guess I don't look
[1:02:58] like it said ' no I admire that you look
[1:03:01] human and I said 'well well all right
[1:03:04] sir he said are you the minister yes sir
[1:03:07] the same God that can speak to a tree
[1:03:09] can speak to a man and there I led the
[1:03:12] old fellow to Christ am is that
[1:03:15] beautiful see something has to speak to
[1:03:17] sap to go down into the into the roots
[1:03:19] right just like water will not go down a
[1:03:22] pole by itself unless you push it or
[1:03:24] something like that something to move
[1:03:26] that sap and then something's got to
[1:03:27] send it back up what life what tells
[1:03:30] that sap to do that it's God brother
[1:03:32] brandom said and the same God that give
[1:03:35] intelligence to move sap up and down a
[1:03:36] tree is the same God that told Brother
[1:03:38] Bram the thoughts and intents of the
[1:03:40] hearts amen Bram said year later I come
[1:03:43] back and he' went to meet the Lord and
[1:03:45] the wife told me brother Bram he died in
[1:03:47] Victory praising God what was it he seen
[1:03:50] God speaking in his Universe of all the
[1:03:53] things that he had seen and yet the very
[1:03:55] nature of a declared to him that there
[1:03:58] was a god see and he found it and Found
[1:04:01] Jesus Christ as his savior you like that
[1:04:03] by God's grace let's give that a round
[1:04:05] of applause praise God Amen I love that
[1:04:08] one there's an intelligence in nature
[1:04:11] it's not the sap sap Sap's not smart
[1:04:13] right there's got to be something
[1:04:15] telling that plant to do that and that's
[1:04:17] God that's God's life that he put in
[1:04:20] there
[1:04:21] amen remember the old fisherman story
[1:04:23] let's go through I'm not sure if this
[1:04:24] one's longer or shorter
[1:04:27] but B said what is it it's God God's
[1:04:29] provided way God makes a way not long
[1:04:31] ago there's a little preacher a little
[1:04:32] minister in a nearby City and he thought
[1:04:34] maybe he knew Lots about the thing and
[1:04:36] there's a little boy that went to his
[1:04:37] church and he asked his mother well
[1:04:40] first little boy asked his pastor Pastor
[1:04:43] I've heard you speak so much of God
[1:04:44] could anybody see God well the Pastor
[1:04:46] said no honey said nobody can see God
[1:04:48] and live now that's actually a scripture
[1:04:50] but that pastor's got it mixed up a
[1:04:51] little
[1:04:52] bit you can't see the invisible Spirit
[1:04:55] of but you can see God's manifestations
[1:04:57] can't you you could see Angels you could
[1:04:59] see the pillar of fire you could see
[1:05:00] different manifestations of God you see
[1:05:02] the Holy Spirit like a a tongue of fire
[1:05:05] right lick of fire over foreheads you
[1:05:07] could see
[1:05:08] that well he was just a Sunday school
[1:05:11] boy and he asked his mother and his
[1:05:13] mother didn't know he asked his Sunday
[1:05:14] school teacher she didn't know said no
[1:05:16] one could see God he was so
[1:05:19] disappointed he used to stay up the
[1:05:21] river near the Six Mile Island up there
[1:05:23] there's an old fisherman there that had
[1:05:25] long beard he hung around with this old
[1:05:27] man so this little Sunday school boy
[1:05:29] hung around this old fisherman all the
[1:05:31] time one day up the river they were and
[1:05:34] a storm came up and after the storm they
[1:05:36] came down the river any Boatman here
[1:05:38] knows what the rhythm of oing your boat
[1:05:41] and feel of the Waves tips the ores you
[1:05:43] know and the old man looked around the
[1:05:45] Sun had come out there was a rainbow
[1:05:46] setting the leaves were all washed off
[1:05:49] and pretty the old man kept pulling his
[1:05:52] boat tears begin to roll down his cheeks
[1:05:55] he'd pull p a little further and look
[1:05:57] back
[1:05:58] again the little fell sitting in the CER
[1:06:00] of the boat became so enthused till he
[1:06:02] run up in the middle of the boat and
[1:06:03] said sir I'm gonna ask you a question my
[1:06:05] mother couldn't answer my father
[1:06:07] couldn't answer my pastor my Sunday
[1:06:09] school teacher no one could answer me
[1:06:11] said I believe there's a God and said
[1:06:14] could I ever see
[1:06:17] him it was too much for the old
[1:06:19] fisherman he just pulled his ores in
[1:06:21] through his hands to his face and wept
[1:06:22] like a baby he reached and put his arms
[1:06:25] around the little boy and said God bless
[1:06:26] your heart honey all I've seen for the
[1:06:29] past 35 years has been God hallelujah
[1:06:33] why sure there was so much God on the
[1:06:35] inside he could see him on the outside
[1:06:38] amen I like that we got to get God on
[1:06:40] the inside when you get God on the
[1:06:42] inside you can see God on the outside in
[1:06:45] nature if you want to see God in his
[1:06:47] Universe get him on the inside watch how
[1:06:50] the birds sing differently in the trees
[1:06:51] even your enemy looks
[1:06:54] differently he says when God he's in his
[1:06:56] Universe he's in you looking out showing
[1:06:59] you the Magnificent part of his Universe
[1:07:04] amen a little girl coming from Sunday
[1:07:06] school this one's even shorter I think
[1:07:08] remember this one he asked the little
[1:07:10] girl one day who was coming from Sunday
[1:07:12] school why did she waste her time on
[1:07:14] doing such a thing as that she said
[1:07:17] because she believed that there was a
[1:07:18] God and Mr dorsy said that he said child
[1:07:21] you are so wrong to believe in such a
[1:07:23] thing as
[1:07:24] that and said that the little girl
[1:07:26] stooped down and picked up a little
[1:07:27] flower off the ground pulled it from its
[1:07:30] petals and said Mr dorsy could you tell
[1:07:32] me how this flower
[1:07:34] lives there it
[1:07:36] was when she be to search back she could
[1:07:39] have said to the child or he could have
[1:07:40] said to the child well it's growing in
[1:07:42] the earth and then the questions would
[1:07:44] revolve back where did the Earth come
[1:07:46] from how did that sea get here how did
[1:07:48] that happen and on and on and on and run
[1:07:51] it back until he's seen see not the
[1:07:53] great glamorous things that we think of
[1:07:55] about but it's the simple things that
[1:07:57] God is so real the simplicity so it
[1:08:00] pleases God to reveal himself and then
[1:08:03] hide himself amen you like that one that
[1:08:06] one goes back to the original seed
[1:08:07] praise God the spoken word is the
[1:08:10] Original Seed so if you start with well
[1:08:12] where did this flower get life well from
[1:08:13] a seed where does that seed get life
[1:08:15] from and you take it all the way back
[1:08:17] pretty soon you end up with what the
[1:08:18] beginning right uh the first mover and
[1:08:20] that had to be God hallelujah there's
[1:08:23] another one now let me see many more I
[1:08:25] got here by God's grace here's the
[1:08:27] Infidel on the street I think you might
[1:08:29] like that one and then the Kentucky man
[1:08:32] who didn't believe in Divine
[1:08:33] Healing this one's a pretty long one
[1:08:37] okay let's
[1:08:40] see is that who's that Caris is that hav
[1:08:45] best her heart I told my wife I said
[1:08:47] sometimes I have the effect on people I
[1:08:48] put them to
[1:08:50] sleep let's go through this one this is
[1:08:52] a good one this is one of my favorite
[1:08:54] stories uh the Infidel on the street
[1:08:56] brother Bram had just got saved and an
[1:08:59] Infidel tried to argue with him brother
[1:09:00] br's out preaching on the street don't
[1:09:02] you like that he's a Street Preacher I
[1:09:03] like that at the beginning of his
[1:09:05] ministry here some time ago I was
[1:09:07] speaking with an Infidel down the street
[1:09:09] he said look here Jesus of Nazareth this
[1:09:11] Infidel studied to be a Roman priest and
[1:09:13] got sour against the thing he went back
[1:09:15] out into the world and become a perfect
[1:09:16] Infidel and I was on one corner
[1:09:19] preaching he was up in the little lot
[1:09:20] there in New Albany out in the park with
[1:09:21] a Bible laying there and said that he
[1:09:24] said that Bible's Orest ornest book ever
[1:09:27] written it a it ain't even shouldn't be
[1:09:29] put in the public literature or out
[1:09:31] amongst public literature and things
[1:09:32] said oh it was so deceiving it was all
[1:09:36] he called it and me on the other Corner
[1:09:37] preaching the gospel and he said if I'll
[1:09:40] prove to you brother Rand there's no
[1:09:42] such thing as God will you accept it I
[1:09:43] said yes
[1:09:45] sir and I was well just a kid then I
[1:09:47] didn't know too much about the scripture
[1:09:49] I don't yet tonight but I know the
[1:09:50] author of it that's the main thing so
[1:09:52] then he said well how many senses do the
[1:09:54] human body and he was a smart man and I
[1:09:57] said see taste feel smell and here said
[1:09:59] all right if he was a human God now as
[1:10:03] they claim he was he was made manifest
[1:10:06] here among us then one of these five
[1:10:08] human senses ought to declare him and he
[1:10:10] said is that right well a gang of people
[1:10:13] the Infidel and the preacher together so
[1:10:15] you know what caused it or what it
[1:10:16] caused here come everybody running up
[1:10:18] you see so have an Infidel and a
[1:10:19] preacher kind of debating I like that I
[1:10:22] said well that sounds reasonable why he
[1:10:25] said said all right did you ever see
[1:10:26] your God I said well yes sir one night
[1:10:29] he said now let me see him so see what
[1:10:31] he's saying he said have you ever seen
[1:10:33] God he's like yeah he said well then
[1:10:34] show them to me let me see
[1:10:35] him I said well of course of course
[1:10:38] you're lost he said see we ain't talking
[1:10:42] about faith I want my sense of sight
[1:10:44] just the same as yours and if You' see
[1:10:46] him let me see him I said well I saw him
[1:10:49] by Vision he said well let me see the
[1:10:51] vision see you can't give somebody a
[1:10:53] vision right Visions are gifts and
[1:10:55] calling of God are without repentance
[1:10:57] she's saying basic give me that gift and
[1:10:59] you can't give anybody that gift I said
[1:11:01] well you don't oh not believe now no no
[1:11:04] you can't cut me off he said you never
[1:11:06] did see him you never did feel him so
[1:11:09] see you never can't feel God and brother
[1:11:10] man said oh no I felt him the Infidel
[1:11:13] said no well if you felt him let me feel
[1:11:16] him my sense of feeling is just as good
[1:11:18] as yours and it's the same sense said
[1:11:21] bring him here let me feel him here and
[1:11:24] I'll believe him said you said you felt
[1:11:27] him I said I feeled him in my heart he
[1:11:30] said well let me feel him that
[1:11:32] way I said Well if you get down and
[1:11:35] believe he said no not your psychology I
[1:11:37] want to know truth and he was holding
[1:11:40] well I know I wasn't up against no
[1:11:42] little boy and he chewed that tobacco
[1:11:44] you know spit it out like that I said
[1:11:45] well don't spit on my foot sir and he
[1:11:47] said well see well you were all tied up
[1:11:49] here aren't you he said you never did
[1:11:52] see him feel him taste him smell him or
[1:11:54] hear him and there therefore if none of
[1:11:55] these five senses won't declare them
[1:11:57] then there's no such a thing and quit
[1:11:59] your nonsense around here deceiving the
[1:12:02] people I thought oh my that's quite an
[1:12:05] argument huh well you're saying you uh
[1:12:08] he you felt god with your senses but you
[1:12:10] can't let me feel God with my senses
[1:12:13] that's quite an argument brother BR
[1:12:15] said Oh my he said now if he was a human
[1:12:18] God you believe that he was human yes
[1:12:20] sir I believe Jesus Christ was human and
[1:12:23] he rose from the dead as among man today
[1:12:24] yes sir I believe that he rose from that
[1:12:26] body yes sir that's right all right then
[1:12:29] let me see him let me see one of the
[1:12:32] senses declare Jesus in other
[1:12:34] words and oh he had a pretty stiff
[1:12:37] argument I thought oh Lord I'd been
[1:12:40] preaching about three months then I
[1:12:41] thought what am i g to do I said Lord
[1:12:43] you told me to take no thought what I'd
[1:12:45] say that you said you'd add it at that
[1:12:47] time I thought Lord what can I do in my
[1:12:50] heart I was praying I begin to see
[1:12:51] something you know what they say give a
[1:12:52] cow enough rope it'll hang itself that's
[1:12:55] about right so I begin to see something
[1:12:57] moving up the Holy Spirit moving up I
[1:12:59] said ' that's true I certainly I believe
[1:13:00] you got he said 'oh you begin to come to
[1:13:03] yourself aren't you I said maybe I am I
[1:13:07] said I tell you you're a really smart
[1:13:08] man you got a good mind buddy look at
[1:13:12] this he said well my mother never raised
[1:13:14] no fools and he spit like that I said
[1:13:18] well you're a really smart man you got a
[1:13:20] good mind he said sure I got a good mind
[1:13:23] now get away from all that kind of stuff
[1:13:25] I said just a moment did you say you had
[1:13:27] a mind he said why sure I said I don't
[1:13:31] believe
[1:13:32] it he said well what's the matter with
[1:13:35] you you must have lost the mind you had
[1:13:38] I said no no if you I said is it a human
[1:13:42] mind because remember he said does Jesus
[1:13:43] have a human body so brother B asked do
[1:13:46] you have a human mind he said why yes I
[1:13:49] said well come on I was a gentleman with
[1:13:50] you you be a gentleman with me you want
[1:13:52] to embarrass me now come was it a human
[1:13:54] mind he said why
[1:13:56] yes I said if it's a human mind one of
[1:13:59] the human senses ought to declare I like
[1:14:02] that I said how many senses is the body
[1:14:04] and he said so he tells him you know
[1:14:07] tells him all five senses he says see
[1:14:09] taste feel I said did you ever see your
[1:14:11] mind see do you ever smell your mind do
[1:14:14] you ever taste your mind do you ever
[1:14:16] feel your mind did you ever hear your
[1:14:18] mind he said no sir I said then you
[1:14:22] haven't got any mind that's right you're
[1:14:24] just absolutely without a mind he said
[1:14:27] well I know I got a mind and I said I
[1:14:29] know I got a God too and that's just
[1:14:33] exactly amen so see it goes back to that
[1:14:36] point we made earlier about Bill and N
[1:14:37] the science guy he knows he has
[1:14:40] something that the five senses cannot
[1:14:41] declare he can't deny it and he has no
[1:14:45] idea how it got there well brother
[1:14:46] brandom used that argument uh to get
[1:14:49] over on this Infidel he says oh
[1:14:51] everything you believe has to be able to
[1:14:53] be seen proved by the five senses and
[1:14:55] brother BR said your mind can't be
[1:14:56] proven by the five
[1:14:57] senses that's right because right now
[1:14:59] you can picture can you get a picture of
[1:15:01] brother brandom in your mind right now
[1:15:02] or Jesus Christ get a picture and yet
[1:15:04] you're looking at me how can you do that
[1:15:05] because you got a mind I can't touch
[1:15:07] that you can't touch that you can't feel
[1:15:09] that hear that taste that or smell that
[1:15:12] but you can do it because it's something
[1:15:14] spiritual and that's the argument where
[1:15:16] brother Bram got the upper hand on him
[1:15:19] amen God gave us uh we all see that's
[1:15:22] God's knowledge revealed inside every
[1:15:25] man amen God's power is manifested in
[1:15:28] every man we all have something that's
[1:15:30] Supernatural inside of us didn't brother
[1:15:31] B say that that everybody has a
[1:15:33] Supernatural part to them
[1:15:37] Hallelujah and one of the boys was
[1:15:39] standing there and had a rose pinned on
[1:15:41] his lapel and I pulled the pin out like
[1:15:43] that I thought I would have a little fun
[1:15:45] out of him then I walked over where he
[1:15:46] was and I said now you see what I mean
[1:15:48] and I stuck him on the arm with a pin a
[1:15:51] needle he said hey I said did you feel
[1:15:54] that he said said
[1:15:55] yes and I said he was going to slap me
[1:15:58] then so I said I didn't feel that poke I
[1:16:01] didn't feel it he said well let me stick
[1:16:03] you I said that's what I thought I said
[1:16:07] that's right if you accept the same
[1:16:09] Jesus Christ that I've accepted and now
[1:16:12] you will feel him the same way I feel
[1:16:14] him just exactly let the pin stick the
[1:16:17] other way let's give that around PA like
[1:16:19] that one praise God
[1:16:21] Amen see if you if you surrender your
[1:16:24] Supernatural part if you surrender your
[1:16:26] human Spirit you'll experience God but
[1:16:29] you have to surrender that part that's a
[1:16:31] proof of God Amen Hallelujah it proves
[1:16:34] it to an Infidel see they they can't say
[1:16:36] everything has to be proved by the five
[1:16:38] senses because God put something
[1:16:39] Supernatural in every person amen I'm
[1:16:42] doing pretty good on time okay I got
[1:16:44] about eight minutes here now this is
[1:16:46] where it all kind of came to me because
[1:16:47] brother tells a story about a Kentucky
[1:16:49] man who didn't believe in Divine Healing
[1:16:50] in the Ephesian Church age sermon from
[1:16:52] 1960 this one's really simple and
[1:16:55] wonderful too it reminds me of John
[1:16:57] chapter 1 where Jesus told uh Peter
[1:17:00] James and John I believe he said or
[1:17:03] Peter Peter and j John I think it was if
[1:17:06] I'm not mistaken or Nathaniel yeah he
[1:17:08] said if you believe this he said you'll
[1:17:10] see greater things in this you'll see
[1:17:11] the son of man or Angels ascending and
[1:17:13] descending on the son of man so in other
[1:17:16] words if you can believe God a little
[1:17:17] bit you'll see more of it amen so here's
[1:17:20] the story last one here one time down in
[1:17:23] Kentucky I was having a meeting fell
[1:17:25] come out and he said oh I don't believe
[1:17:26] that healing I said well it's all right
[1:17:28] you're
[1:17:29] American he said I don't believe
[1:17:31] anything unless I see it I said well
[1:17:33] it's all right he said no I ain't got
[1:17:35] nothing against you but I don't believe
[1:17:37] what you're saying I said it's your
[1:17:38] American privilege you don't have
[1:17:40] to he said now I never accept nothing
[1:17:43] unless I can see it plainly H I said
[1:17:47] well now that's good you must be from
[1:17:49] Missouri because Missouri is the show me
[1:17:50] state brother makes a joke with him oh
[1:17:53] you have to see it to believe it you
[1:17:54] must be from Missouri said no I'm a
[1:17:56] kuckian woo don't sound very good for
[1:17:59] Kentucky I said but anyhow I said if you
[1:18:01] that's the way you think you go
[1:18:03] ahead and I said how are you going home
[1:18:06] he said I'm going across the hill I live
[1:18:08] over well go over with me nice man said
[1:18:11] go home with me and stay all night
[1:18:12] brother Braham so the man invites
[1:18:13] brother Braham over even though he don't
[1:18:15] de believe in Divine Healing he liked
[1:18:16] brother Braham enough to invite him over
[1:18:17] to stay the night with
[1:18:19] him brother bam said I wish I could
[1:18:21] brother but I said I'm going up here
[1:18:23] with my uncle and he said and I said you
[1:18:26] want a ride over nope I got to go up
[1:18:29] across the hill up there up this way and
[1:18:31] down a hollow and up and you know how it
[1:18:33] is down there and I said well I said how
[1:18:36] you gonna get up how you gonna get there
[1:18:38] he said I'm going up The Path there why
[1:18:41] I said now here's where brother Ram
[1:18:42] starts bringing in this this wrong
[1:18:44] thought the thought is I gotta see it to
[1:18:46] believe it so brother Ram starts Reb or
[1:18:48] correcting him or on this thought right
[1:18:49] here he said why you can't even see your
[1:18:52] hand before you it's so dark I said how
[1:18:54] going to get up there he said I've got a
[1:18:57] lantern I said well how do you what do
[1:19:00] you think or what what do you do light
[1:19:02] the lantern then walk with it he said
[1:19:04] yes sir I love the Simplicity brother
[1:19:06] brandom used I said when you light that
[1:19:09] Lantern can you hold it up high like
[1:19:11] this I'd like to see your house he said
[1:19:13] no you can't see it I said then how you
[1:19:16] gonna get there oh he said I'll just
[1:19:19] light the Lantern and as I walk I just
[1:19:21] walk as the light and I said that that's
[1:19:25] just it amen just walk in the light so
[1:19:29] brother B is saying oh you can't see
[1:19:30] your house so how do you believe it he
[1:19:32] said I know it's there if I just keep
[1:19:34] holding the light I'll eventually get
[1:19:36] there and brother Bon said just keep
[1:19:39] walking don't stand still you'll never
[1:19:42] get nowhere if you've been saved walk to
[1:19:44] sanctification amen you say how do you
[1:19:47] get there just keep walking is the
[1:19:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost after
[1:19:51] sanctification how do I get that he said
[1:19:53] just keep walking in the light how about
[1:19:56] his signs wonders and miracles he said
[1:19:58] just keep walking in the light see just
[1:20:01] keep on every time you make a step the
[1:20:03] light will jump just a little ahead of
[1:20:05] you because he's always ahead of you he
[1:20:08] don't push he leads amen he is the light
[1:20:12] oh I'm so glad of that aren't you he's
[1:20:15] the light in him there is no Darkness
[1:20:18] praise God can you trust God to if you
[1:20:20] can trust God to walk the little light
[1:20:22] he'll take you all the way to where you
[1:20:23] need to go praise God okay I got about
[1:20:26] four
[1:20:28] minutes now I have
[1:20:31] um I did some Bible proofs here I
[1:20:34] watched a video about scientific
[1:20:35] research in the Bible and so I'll
[1:20:37] probably just do one or two I'll just
[1:20:38] probably I got about 11 of these or 12
[1:20:41] of these is the Bible scientific books I
[1:20:44] think you'll like these by God's
[1:20:46] grace yes it is because number one the
[1:20:49] Earth's free flow in space was foretold
[1:20:51] by job job said the Earth hangeth the
[1:20:55] Earth or God hangeth the Earth upon
[1:20:58] nothing amen is the Bible scientific
[1:21:01] it's very scientific praise God is it
[1:21:04] Supernatural it's very Supernatural
[1:21:06] praise God now the Earth's free flow in
[1:21:10] space was written by job at about 1520
[1:21:16] BC that's when job's book was written it
[1:21:18] was a little bit right after uh Moses's
[1:21:20] time at least that's what uh the
[1:21:23] Scofield bible says
[1:21:25] now science discovered Earth's free flow
[1:21:27] in space around 300 to 400
[1:21:31] ad so God told this fact about 1,800
[1:21:34] years before science discovered it amen
[1:21:37] we got a pretty good science book here
[1:21:39] Church you like
[1:21:40] that Amen brother Ram proves god with
[1:21:43] these simple little illustrations you
[1:21:45] know and it's so true and science
[1:21:47] continues uh the Bible continues to
[1:21:49] prove the science the correct science as
[1:21:52] well amen now if you look up Universe on
[1:21:55] britanica because I have a subscription
[1:21:56] to that it says in the 4th Century BCE I
[1:21:59] can't say that name ponticus a follower
[1:22:02] of uh Pythagoras taught that the
[1:22:06] spherical Earth rotated freely in space
[1:22:09] and that Mercury and Venus revolved
[1:22:11] around the Sun so there's a history to
[1:22:13] back that up amen so the Bible's very
[1:22:17] scientific what was it 1,00 years before
[1:22:20] science figured out God already told him
[1:22:22] amen number two the expanding of the
[1:22:26] universe you know this is just up until
[1:22:28] recently most people thought the the
[1:22:30] universe was fixed and was
[1:22:32] eternal most atheists thought that but
[1:22:35] now they know the the universe is
[1:22:37] actually
[1:22:38] expanding because the Bible said this in
[1:22:40] Psalms
[1:22:41] 104:2 God covers himself with light as a
[1:22:44] with a garment and he stretches out the
[1:22:46] heavens like a
[1:22:48] curtain this is written in the Book of
[1:22:50] Psalms about a th BC and science
[1:22:54] discover this
[1:22:55] somewhere between 1900 and 1950 that's
[1:22:58] when science discovered uh that the
[1:23:00] universe is actually expanding and just
[1:23:02] so you know the planets are not
[1:23:05] expanding space is expanding in the
[1:23:07] planets just it's just a little detail
[1:23:10] uh the planets remain the same ma size
[1:23:11] and matter and everything like that the
[1:23:13] stars do what's expanding is the space
[1:23:15] the literal space that everything sits
[1:23:17] in so things are getting further away
[1:23:20] okay that's called the receding of the
[1:23:21] galaxies and I was reading about that
[1:23:22] yesterday as well
[1:23:24] so that's what's expanding so like Earth
[1:23:26] is not getting bigger or we're not
[1:23:28] getting bigger uh but the space itself
[1:23:30] is expanding now look at this science
[1:23:33] discovered this from 1900 1950 God told
[1:23:36] this almost 3,000 years before science
[1:23:38] figured it out God is so wise his book
[1:23:41] of science is always right praise God
[1:23:45] and if you look up expanding Universe it
[1:23:47] talks about Edwin Hubble and he used
[1:23:50] observations from Isaac Newton with the
[1:23:52] law of relativity and uh receding
[1:23:54] galaxies some other scientists
[1:23:55] discovered receding galaxies galaxies
[1:23:57] that are moving farther away from each
[1:23:59] other because space is stretching
[1:24:01] out and he used that uh to do a
[1:24:05] discovery to discover that the universe
[1:24:08] is expanding yeah I'll just read that
[1:24:09] right there the universe is expanding
[1:24:11] and there's a lot of stuff I don't
[1:24:12] understand right
[1:24:13] there but see they can actually date it
[1:24:16] they can actually they get an idea
[1:24:18] because the universe is expanding they
[1:24:20] can get about a date when uh when it
[1:24:22] began now remember brother brandom said
[1:24:24] history is only 6,000 years old right
[1:24:26] but he said the universe might be
[1:24:28] millions and trillions of years old
[1:24:29] remember he said
[1:24:31] that he said because out of God came the
[1:24:33] logos and out of logos came all the
[1:24:35] creation and God the logos stopped all
[1:24:38] the planets and everything and all the
[1:24:40] stars and then he started you know
[1:24:42] making love to the Earth and brought
[1:24:44] forth all the seeds and then we know
[1:24:46] that so that thought that's very
[1:24:48] inspiring very inspired from the Bible
[1:24:51] praise the Lord okay I got one more
[1:24:53] minute I'll just close on this one the
[1:24:55] hygiene practice of washing hands and
[1:24:57] running
[1:24:58] water that don't sound very scientific
[1:25:00] but it was very it is very scientific
[1:25:02] because of microorganisms right so
[1:25:05] levius 15:13 there's my time that's
[1:25:07] about an hour so this my last
[1:25:11] one this is of course God's uh God's
[1:25:14] word to Moses and when he that hath an
[1:25:17] issue is cleansed of his issue then he
[1:25:19] shall number to himself seven days for
[1:25:20] his cleansing and wash his clothes and
[1:25:22] bathe his flesh in running water water
[1:25:25] and he shall be clean so God commands if
[1:25:27] you're going to be clean from this
[1:25:28] infection you must use running water now
[1:25:32] here's a man named uh
[1:25:34] ignaz seawise and you can look him up
[1:25:37] he's on he's all over all the you look
[1:25:39] on Wikipedia or Botanica or whatever you
[1:25:41] want he ordered the students uh to wash
[1:25:44] their hands in a solution now this he's
[1:25:45] at a hospital he ordered the students to
[1:25:48] wash their hands and chlorinated lime
[1:25:50] before each examination because they
[1:25:52] would examine women who were sick and
[1:25:54] they would go from sick women to
[1:25:55] pregnant women and they would spread
[1:25:56] disease that way and many about I think
[1:25:59] up to 40% of women died because they
[1:26:01] would take these microorganisms these uh
[1:26:04] these diseases on their hands they would
[1:26:05] take them right over there from a a
[1:26:07] woman dying to a woman giving birth or
[1:26:09] who just given
[1:26:11] birth under these procedures the
[1:26:13] mortality rates in the first division
[1:26:15] dropped from
[1:26:16] 18.27% to
[1:26:19] 1.2% and in March and August of 1848 no
[1:26:22] woman died in child birth in his
[1:26:23] division
[1:26:25] amen so God told Moses this in about
[1:26:29] 1490 BC and seis discovered this in
[1:26:33] 1848
[1:26:35] 3,300 years God told it before science
[1:26:38] discovered it how many love the how many
[1:26:40] love the Lord tonight let's stand to our
[1:26:42] feet by God's grace like I said I just
[1:26:44] got a chance to maybe do part one I got
[1:26:46] a lot more uh like the life is in the
[1:26:49] blood and how the Earth is a sphere I
[1:26:52] know Austin I been talking about how
[1:26:53] people say it's a FL Earth but I still
[1:26:54] believe it's a sphere I still do because
[1:26:57] the Bible say it's the heart of the
[1:26:58] earth the earth has a heart the Earth
[1:27:00] has a center amen and then oceanography
[1:27:04] there's a very famous man oh this is
[1:27:06] this was just burned in my heart Matthew
[1:27:08] Mari read the Bible he read psalms 8
[1:27:10] ver8 and said where the Bible said
[1:27:12] there's paths in the sea and he went out
[1:27:14] and discovered the ocean
[1:27:16] currents just by reading the Bible and
[1:27:19] then he wrote the most famous book on
[1:27:21] oceanography still used today in uh many
[1:27:24] schools for oceanography my how many
[1:27:27] thank God for this book that we got here
[1:27:28] by God's grace basic instructions before
[1:27:31] leaving Earth amen God's proof of his
