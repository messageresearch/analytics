together just to give you a chance to read there I'll read verse 5 6 7 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men let's read verse 8 together one two three and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross praise God let's have one more word of Prayer never need on your heart let's just make it known unto the Lord here raising our hands

thank you for all the sacrifices that have been made Lord God and father we love your presence bless us now in Jesus name every said Amen god bless yous being seated praise God you [Music] can switch over here hon I got some slides here again for tonight it's like to continue this morning night when I try to do between every service on Sundays like I try to study both or two different subjects so I was trying to study the Statue perform and study this I just kind of felt led to go this way hopefully it'll be a blessing to you I'm sure will by the grace of the Lord but let's look continue on this thought of this this is such a beautiful chapter dealing with Christ dear how Christ Christ is our model on how to come into a unity of the faith right Paul we looked at this morning Paul wants us of one mind of one Accord all thinking the same thing he knows if they're born again of the Holy Ghost they're sealed in their souls but that's once it's sealed the battles not there anymore the battles now in the mind praise God and so his desire is to see every Christian come into a unity of like mindedness he calls it like mindedness so we we should all be even tonight we should all be thinking about the same thing praise God I'll be thinking about Jesus Christ amen now we read 6 we read five through eight but in 6 through 8 up here I just gave my little thoughts you know he gives us two subjects so look at we'll probably start with the Godhead Lord willing and then we will move here to servanthood and Paul's thoughts on this it's a real great thought here so verse 6 now for those of you who real familiar with the message this is brother Rams text for the unveiling of God he preached it twice once in Jeffersonville and once elsewhere I can't remember exactly where that one was preached but he preaches the unveiling of goddess into it yesterday or most of it not all of it so if you know the the text it's a beautiful text brother Branham shows how God is veiled in every generation God is invisible no man had ever see him so he had to come into a form just to be seen but no matter what form he's in he's always veiled brother BAM says he was veiled in the prophets he veil himself in Jesus Christ and that was the god veil we'd say praise God the perfect veil but boom he emphasizes that he says now you're the veil of God praise God now you hide God's presence amen he said then that's one of the major points of his sermon is to show that you and I now become the veil of Jesus Christ oh what a privilege praise God but it's just like the Old Testament he's hiding behind badger skins right he's hiding behind a very humble outward a texture writer outward appearance so humble but yet God Himself is hiding behind that praise God another great emphasis brother branham makes is the veil he focuses on the veil he said the veil of Jesus Jesus's veil was his flesh right the flesh was the veil of God but then he gets into the part where each age should go behind the veil and he brings it down to this day he said today there's a Methodist veil there's a Baptist male right there's a Pentecostal veil but he said believers have to break beyond the veil and get into the presence of God praise God amen and so that's another main thought that he brings out that we have to break through the veil praise God of denominationalism into the Friends of God now here form form is the word brother Graham emphasizes and if you have a Scofield Bible Scofield quotes a man named Thayer I don't know who there is actually didn't look that one up but the word form Thayer says is an morphing now in my lexicon I don't know what lexicon Thayer was using but there's no end before it I don't know if it makes a difference and just it's more fake more fake so in the word for means more fate it's the form by which a person or thing strikes the vision the external appearance so Jesus was in the form of God Jesus was in the external appearance of God praise God because God is invisible and this is the whole this is outside this this is the whole revelation of the Godhead if you can catch and I love it God sends a prophet tells him thus saith the LORD trinitarianism run but he's got to give us something to point to and he points us right here to Philippians to praise God he's got to give us some benefits if it's not truly what is it it's the form God in three forms amen God in three manifestations praise God and he points us of all the scripture he points us to Philippians chapter 2 praise God he said Christ was in the form of God he was in the morphe he was in the external appearance or the mask of God amen I just want to read you some quotes so you can have kind of the context of it God changed himself changed his form if you notice here in Philippians he said thinking they're not thinking at robbery but took the form of a man now the Greek word there for that form I've been looking at it all day yesterday trying to think out what it was I find I come with this word of and more faith now see that's Scofield and I added that that's Scofield reference but in the Greek there's no en which I don't know that makes a difference it smelled in then the spells it looking in the Greek to find out what a morph a was I may pronounce that wrong but reason I spelled it is the taste is released the people will scholars well you know what I mean by he said he when the morph a that means he changed himself he come down the Greek word there means something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eye catches it see like Elijah Dothan the servant couldn't see all those angels around there and God just changed he brought the Angels down but he changed the seeing of the servant and there was the mountains full of angels and fire horses a fire and chariots of fire all around his prophet see they he changed the seeing the thing is already there praise God so God is already here praise God amen but he's hiding behind veils amen he's a more faint right he's he's hiding behind a veil he has a form in this case is we believe which were real Bible believers he's behind the form of the preaching of the word tonight now he might be in the form of a gift in you but he he certainly isn't behind the form of me praise God because it's my it's my lot to pray next weekend it's not but it's my lot to preach so God takes the form of the veil and he's hiding behind that speaking his word to his children tonight hey man hallelujah that's God's grace to us he's already here but he he changes his form so what I'm trying to say God has always was is here the only thing he done we become a man he changes masks and morph a changes its mass to what he was what he is or his mask another act like in a great drama I was speaking this morning kind of catching up on the Shakespeare it's been a long time when Shakespeare wrote the drama for King James of England when he character of Macbeth see Shakespeare did not believe in witches but in the play for the King did believe in witches so he had to include witches and now in order to do this they changed the cast Becky here and Carmen they acted that in the school where she just graduated a few weeks ago now maybe one person play three or four parts in order to do that he changes Mass sometimes he comes out he's this character and next time he comes out he's another character but this is the same person all the time and that's God he changed himself from a pillar of fire become a man then change himself from that back in the spirit again that he might dwell in man God acting a man what he really was Jesus Christ was God acting in a man in a man in a man that's what he was he changed from the pillar fire and had come in which was a veil in the wilderness and that hid God from Israel Moses seen the shape of his body but really he was hid all the time behind the pillar of fire which was the logos that went out from God hallelujah now okay I thought I got one more - got one more yeah one more now we find out here since Pentecost God is not acting and he said now he's acting through man oh what a privilege amen oh no it's so humble let's try to see God tonight I know it's so hum I know I know it's hard and it's difficult for us at times but let's see try to see the Word of God that God wants to speak to us tonight praise God because since Pentecost it's God hiding in men and women bracelet and we were gathered together like this it's behind up man preaching the word he was acting in a man then Jesus now he's acting through man that has chosen for this purpose God in the form of man he changed himself he said from the form of God to a form of a man I knew you now let me go back and I'm gonna rehearse this real quick I kind of got this other one ready I just want to go back to this it's been a years and years since I preaches this but four or five years now let's go back to theophany of God just I wanted to briefly go through he said take a little trip with me this is from 53 before there ever was a star moon he said there was a time there wasn't nothing it was all forever and eternity let's go out here on the edge of the Bannister look over and see these things happen he said now no man has seen the father at any time no man can see God in bodily form because God is in a body form God's a spirit no man has seen the father only the begotten of the father declared him so he quotes John 1:18 now he said there's no light no dark no nothing it seems nothing but in there is a great supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all space of all places at all times he was from everlasting from everlasting the beginning of the creation that's God see you can't see nothing can't hear nothing can't move an atom in the air not nothing yet God was not yet God was there that was God no man has seen that now that's the father that's God the Father so before even the first day of creation before time and days and what could be seen in the human dimension so before any creation there was just God amen and then after a while I begin to see a little sacred line I like that little sacred light begin to form like a little halo or something you can only see it by the spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking so you'd have to have a vision to be able to see it praise God because it wasn't a natural in this natural realm like a light we see outside right now but it was in a spiritual dimension probably the seventh dimension right he said we're standing on the great big Bannister watching what God doing we'll get right down to this question here and you'll see how he brings it so before day one Genesis one you have this is that weeds call this the logos right and then scripturally this is what made everything this this pillar of fire made everything so you can't have light time or days without first having the Sun because the Bible said that all the Sun created all things praise God so out of the invisible came a visible light and that visible light spoke and created amen all things were created by him and for him speaking of Christ so this is the Christ this is the anointing the next thing we've been going to see my eyes of supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there that was called by the Bible readers of logos the anointing the part of God begin to develop into something so human beings could have some type of type of idea what he was a little like moving that was the Word of God so the first thing God tried to get us to try to show us what he was was light amen light and we have to have light to have life praise God and so God could choose anything you would choose light to represent himself amen and that's how in the first veil that he chose the first master hidebehind was liked amen hallelujah so these are all the same thing when we say the logos or the word or the anointing or the theophany of God the Son of God a bit or a visible form of the Holy Spirit it's all the same thing it's all the logos it's all the Son of God it's all the Holy Spirit praise God in a visible form amen so this is a morphing this is God and morph a hallelujah now here where it gets down to the real deep part here yeah okay now God gave himself birth to this son so a Sun coming out of a father right which was before there was even an atom or or air to make an atom see Jesus and glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world praise God so this is to me right here is the mystery the relationship between the father and the son that's the mystery of the Godhead I have more respect for people that believe in two persons than 3 because 3 is totally 3 then the father the holy ghosts are separate people Jesus has two fathers but I have a lot more respect for the Tunis people now that's just a small group I've only met one one time that believe in two persons I think John Graham and I had a meeting with him one time he believed in two persons but that's closer than three praise God see Jesus says father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was so this light the light that came out of God was the son praise God and God was in the Sun and Jesus can reference back that walk that's amazing oh he's on earth he can reference that he said glorify me with the glory we had we shared before the foundation of the world now that's the mystery right there if anybody can explain that their God right cuz you and I can't explain that and then he says father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world so the invisible God looked at that light and he loved that light Oh hallelujah praise God amen I don't believe the Bible praise God and to me this is the deepest part of the Godhead right here this is the part that no man can explain Mamre said the glory that we shared yea with thee and there's other scriptures that say we we and us they actually use the pronoun there looks like too but it's not to people it's to forms praise God or we say an invisible and then a visible form its form it's a morphate praise God now first John I'm sorry John 1 in the beginning was the word the words with God the Word was God who's made flesh and dwelt among us God unfolding himself down to human being now watch how he did it ok now verse 3 John 1:3 all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made okay so everything was made by the word right by the logos now we know the scripture says the first words recorded or let there be light right now I believe those are the first words where when brother Brooks was here he said the first word was Jesus well it might be I don't know but the first words recorded in the Bible are let there be light right those are the first words of God so it was a voice coming out of the invisible saying let there be light in other words I want my future children to to see Who I am amen I want to become tangible I want my I want my children to be able to see Who I am I want to be I want to love my children and I want them to love me amen so he starts working his way towards flesh in Jesus Amen but he starts with light he wants to be known he wants to be felt he wants to be loved he wants to be worshipped and that's what we're doing tonight praise God amen that's what he was he was condescending himself down changing his form bringing himself down but he hear the word is the logos it speaks the word I'm sorry the misérable speaks the word that's the logos that came out from God God's first form and that beautiful Christ is God's first form he said or the Bible says Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God amen it's a dual purpose it's the creation here of light but it's also the creation of a sinless body amen both were creations right the light was the crash the beginning let there be light and then Jesus's body in the womb of Mary that was also the beginning of the creation of God it was a new race praise God there's a new group of humans praise God that starting with Jesus there would be a group of humans that have no sin in their bodies and their spirits and their souls Jesus was the first but we will be the rest praise God that's right the beginning of the creation of God oh I'm looking forward to it aren't you to have a body where there's no sin in it at all praise God where death is swallowed up in life amen now I'm gonna stop there go back the other one okay that's a little review now I do that because I got a lot of kids here let me count real quick one two three well I got 12 kids here you've all dots have heard it over and over again but they haven't so let's bear with them praise God so they can understand because one day they're gonna have those questions what does that mean daddy what's the low cost mean what is that what was the beginning of the creation of God what does that mean and so the sooner we introduce it humming bleah that's better oh yeah because we we were pointed back to the Bible program point us back to the scripture he point us back to the word for to understand God God just changes his form he changes his mask and that's how we receive it praise God now now I'm gonna hold off on this just for a moment let me go over this I want to make sure I never have to put 1/2 you have to put slides on this but let me just read through this I got some notes nor willing in the upcoming book Church how many realize that we're not actually official oneness of God how many understand that there's a whole denomination called oneness and church they've done the same thing the Pentecostals that they've denominated around Crees now it's sad to say they've done the same thing they they caught a revelation Oh God's out three persons but then they went and just in the last we'd say 30 or 40 years I have to look it up you can look it up on the U P CI website United Pentecost was incorporated their oneness and they've written up just in the last Emagine they had a little revival they caught some of this endtime revival but they went and denominated on it and now they've got a denomination oh god help us not the denominator is God God help us to put a comma after everything we believe praise God but they caught the idea that God is not three people or two he's one but they went and organized around it now when you talk with people and I've talked with just a few different ministers about this they're gonna ask you are you oneness and you would say well we would say like brother Branson they ask brother Branham are you Calvin or Armenian right what one believes what one believes it's all grace other one believes it's all works and what Madison I'm with Calvin as long as Calvin stays in the Bible he said I'm Armenian as long as Armenians stay in the Bible praise God so our answer is well I'm oneness as long as they stay in the Bible praise God so if you and they and people ask me I always say that well I believe God's one but I don't agree with all the oneness doctrine all the oneness organization Deborah I understand now the common word Trinitarians will call us if they don't call us oneness they'll call us motorists a motorist that's what they call us now and do I consider myself a motorist no because if you look up motorless they have a certain definition in the dictionaries of them and it doesn't line up with the scripture I'm gonna give you some examples but modalism is closer than try theism right so modalism oneness they're all words but we we never we never we never label ourselves by a term we're just Holy Ghost field Bible believing Christians and my Creed is the Word of God my Creed is Christ amen hallelujah so see we never want to organize and clampdown in and a limit god right the scripture says Israel turn their backs on God and they limited the Holy One of Israel that's why I Church I don't want to that's why I don't want to get in this this thing of we only need two takes you only need the taste only what if God would want to give us a revelation from a book brother Ram never preached on them because there's numerous Bible books but I've never preached I'll what if there's a scripture in the Bible that pertains to the bride but brother Branham never mentioned it is it possible God could anoint us to see that scripture and benefit from it and then it would help us in our lives is it possible yes amen I believe that if it's in the Word of God if it's in here now what it will do but Adam says in the church age book it'll just give us more information it won't change the original revelation you know aligned with and it all it'll be harmonious with the original revelation God gave us through brother Brendan it won't take away from water baptism or the Godhead or serpent seed or the church ages or the seven seals it won't take away from that we don't add more understanding to that praise God thank the Lord so modalism is the doctor that the persons of the Trinity represent only three modes or aspects of the divine revelation and not co-equal a coexisting persons now that's true so the I'm sorry that definition I use that from the dictionary a dictionary out for my app computer so I sight it on there so that definition is actually right God is just changing his mode or his appearance right he's changing his form amen now what they do though modalism sometimes breaks down in two ways because the father and the Holy Spirit are identical but the father and the son were not always identical okay the father and son share identical nature but God is his word and his word became flesh in Christ but their substance was different when Jesus was a man okay because the father substance is invisible but the and Eternal Spirit is invisible but Jesus had a human substance praise God okay so that's where it breaks down because the modalism will say all three of them are identical well not exactly see they'll say the Father Son Holy Ghost are all mortal some says they're all three identical but the son said I can do nothing but what the father shows me and Jesus said the father is greater than I don't believe that so see even modalism when they start that's what happens when they start making their Creed's they start limiting the word of God okay and now see with modalism each form had a different name but see with us we know there's only one name to the Father Son Holy Ghost that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank the Lord so that's a second way so the moralism says see each form has a different name but we know their titles father's a titles sons a title Holy Spirit is the title praise God but the name the power of the name is the name Jesus how many feel that power tonight praise God you just you just say let's all say the name Jesus ready Jesus let's say little louder Jesus let's wake ourself up let's say louder ready Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus amen there's no power in son I'm a son but there's power in the name of Jesus Church just breathe his name I start feeling good already crazy huh Jesus just start saying his name with faith in his name Peter said it's his name through faith in his name has made this man strong it's his name through faith in his name that makes us strong today just speak in his name Jesus so modalism says they're all equal wrong the son's body wasn't equal to the father they all have three separate names that's wrong they all one name and the third way it says listen can you believe this the modal ISM believes the father suffered along with Christ on the cross because they say he was actually present in and personally identified with the son a church the father can't suffer physically because he don't have flesh and bones he's the spirit right and so see this is another way modalism fails remember the father for sup Jesus Jesus said my God my God why is thou forsaken me so see Jesus had to become cursed right so that we could be blessed and so now I don't know how this is possible Church I don't know but God must have a remove his holy spear out of Jesus's soul I don't have even sure if that's possible so I'm just presuming right here right but somehow because how could how could God curse a Holy Ghost filled salt debris with me I know it's kind of deep out there buddy everybody okay tonight so Jesus has a body spirit soul his soul is born again how does God take that anointing off the soul I don't know but we know God cannot curse himself praise God but he could curse a body praise God he couldn't curse a body so he he created this body he some event says he probably took it off in the Garden of Gethsemane the anointing he took the anointing off so the curse could come upon him and then he cursed that body of Jesus the Bible said he was made a curse for us and God hath made him to be sin God is not sin God does not sin but Jesus body became sin for us amen okay so that's the three areas where modalism fails so I think that's a help to you is that help to you by God's grace see we're not of the oneness denomination nor do we say well we're modeless but what I've said is that don't be well modalism is the closest thing to us but whenever you start defining it whenever you start organized wherever organization is there's death as soon as a group organizes they die amen as soon as they say we got to all figure it out and God's not going to reveal anymore in other words as soon as you get complacent we start dying if you get complacent abusive and say like this if you don't keep search searching either we'll get complacent and you can backslide we have to keep seeking after more of God growing in grace growing in knowledge praise God amen see everybody and you know this church anybody can become their own denomination because we know some right we we've had friends and family people when they get their own idea they won't take anything else and now they've become the denomination of brother you may even put a name there they won't take the pastor's word anymore they won't be corrected by anybody they are their own denomination they've limit this cut off any floor revelation or any corruption they cut God they cut down off and they're organized and their spiritual lives die and they wonder why they're not on fire for God's because they've denominated they've limited the Spirit of God they're not hungry and thirsty for righteousness oh god help us to stay hungry and thirsty oh it's so true church oh my mmm there's five million oneness believers worldwide five million I wonder how many message people there that's just that's interesting number five million but there's almost 8 billion people on the earth 5 million our oneness oh my well no wonder Jesus said few there be that find it right few there be that find it no no let's get now I just want to lay that in there that's especially for the children I hope it helps the adults as well by the grace of the Lord so let this mind be in you now the mine part is is mainly in verse seven right but let's read verse six now here's where I just heard I think one or two preachers stumble on this they try to make us equal with God well we are in one way but we are not in another way because look at the word equal now look and see or that's important work Jesus only is fully equal with God only because now he's got a perfect body right body soul spirit and all power is given unto me in heaven earth praise God but see equal means equal in quantity or quality okay so we would say as Christians if we have a portion of the Holy Spirit like program says if that's a portion a spoonful of eternal life it has the same quality of eternal life as a whole ocean of water right it's the same thing but it's not the same quantity but it's the same quality praise God now here's a few quotes I wanted to read just to give you an idea this is Corinthians this is where bo-ram says he's not equal with God no brother what God does is perfect we ain't got no business with our minds putting anything to it just leave it the way it is God did it God said that sells it just take it or don't know how if I could explain it then I'd be equal with God I can't explain it I just believe it that's all that's all master dude see if we could explain every single thing he said we'd be equal with God but the fact we can't shows we're not equal with God here's where he says Satan's not equal with God the devil is not a creator the devil perverts what has been created but he's not a traitor if he was he'd be equal with God he would make himself a world but God is the only crater and the devil perverts what God has gree here's another one here now this is what I survived I was mentioned earlier the very first expectation was you become the absolute II was tempted and she wanted to become the absolute she wanted to be just like God and that's what jeffersonville's doing they're making brother Bram the absolute so to me in my opinion they're falling to the first lie the same lie Satan told Eve is the same lie these tape worshipers are falling to right now it's because it's a no changes tricks right now the fourth verse I read Genesis 3 4 and then 4 and 5 we know that you should not surely die see he's giving her a reason will you like to be equal with God in other words you really want to be right with God take my advice listen me God don't mean that he just didn't and like let me try that in now the people that become their own denomination I said earlier may become their own absolute right they won't take anybody's correction they won't hear any other thoughts outside their own they can only believe it the way they want to believe it because now they say they're equal with God that's why God will cast them down Satan said I will exalt my throne up I will be like the Most High I will be the absolute and God said because that you'll be brought down to the pits of hell that's right so we saw Eve and Satan are not equals right and their brother Ram wasn't equal with God so let's not get that thought in our mind here as far as like we are equal with God to the full degree as Jesus we're not now before I get to verse 9 though I'm gonna read verse 7 so here's how honey what the mind of Christ here's how we get it let this mind be in you he was in the form of God he thought it not robbery to be equal with God verse 7 but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant this is where the people that have heard two preachers get off on this I'm equal with God or work brides equal with God well this is what they don't they don't keep reading and see that if you got this if you got this mind you become a servant to other people you don't become the master you become the servant Jesus then the exalt himself right he let God exalt him verse seven but he made himself of no reputation and took upon in the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and that's the same greek word and more faith so Jesus was in the external appearance of God and he took himself and took upon him the form of a servant or took upon the mask of a servant and was made in the likeness of men his body was the mask praise God verse 8 now here it is for us to and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself yet he had the access to the fullness of the word humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross so someone will who has access to all power all anointing his he was limitless right his potential was limitless because all of the power of God could be behind him but we learned Paul saying learn from him although you have all of this power you have all this word and you have all this ability you have the name of Jesus he said humble yourself unto self death writes of crucifixion dying out to your will humble yourself just as Jesus had he had this equality he had the quantitative humble himself take upon the mine of becoming humble and Jesus said I do nothing except the father shows me first thanks God I think that's beautiful don't you so the mind of a person the mind of Christ who was equal with God the only one who was fully equal with God his thinking was I need to humble myself become a servant and I need to take up my cross right and die but we take up our cross daily and follow him church every day right should feel like something is dying right we've got that something has to die every day of our lives right it has to if it's not then we're not bearing a cross if life is just all fun and all games and going after every pleasure every place then there's no death there's got to be a death if we have the mind of Christ we must humble ourselves and accept the death of taking up the cross of Jesus every day if you got your Bibles go to Psalms 12:6 I kind of ended with this one on Wednesday night but I want to go back over here Psalms 12:6 now copy you that fan on the hot air get all these bodies in here right pumping out all that heat thank you sir Psalms 12:6 wow look at David man look at verse 1 help Lord for the godly man Cephas in that about today Lord where are the godly people we see him on Wednesday and Sunday if your family right here you might see more often not let me around my family I love my brothers is my sister for the faithful fail from among the children of men my co so I see it shows in every age there's a small little remnant right now we're set to 6 is where we ended on Wednesday night speaking of the Statue program in the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times now this is a little bit of a paradox scripture right God's Word doesn't need purified and the church said but David is giving an example the only thing I can compare God's Word to us would be silver that's already gone through seven fires right and it's in other words it's in the most complete pure state that's the only thing I can apply it to is the the purest thing is remember proverbs 35 and 6 says every word of God is pure a man but see I used I use the scripture to show the statue over man there's seven purifications amen a church you know you know when gold or silver is fired what do they do they got to take the dross out right the good silver and gold it comes up to the top and the dross goes down amen right so it's like our character our character we got to have that's why this seven Holy Ghost revivals amen seven hot fiery Bibles our God adds faith and virtue a knowledge to the fire of God purging and cleaning us out sanctum and that links us waiting for that great picture praise God it's a good reference for me each one is a fire and it burns away remember each one you got to reject you got to reject human reasoning and unbelief and hypocrisy and selfishness and this is what it's showing that that's how God fully purges that's how he fully sanctifies his people amen God's Word doesn't need reply but it's we're the ones that need refined praise God go to Malachi 3 this because these two scriptures tie together Malachi 3:1 see that's why God uses the 7 because 7 is the 7 steps and that's the completely pure believer after going through sanctification because they're seven virtues Malachi 3:1 we know the Word of God has already pure so David was saying the closest thing I could see would be silver that's purified seven times would be like the Word of God but the reason uses 7 is because there are seven golden candlesticks praise God there's 7 stars in the hand of Jesus 7 is God's number of completion amen and silver is redemption so that's how we're fully redeemed through sanctification and then capped off with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Malachi 3:1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant who need the leiden behold he shall come saith the Lord of Hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeared for he is like a refiners fire and like a Fuller's soap and he shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may for unto the Lord and offering in righteousness amen she Church God is going to receive our offerings after we're purified praise God right that's not going to accept our offering if we got sin in our lives and we got dross and we're not confessing the way we ought to do we're not living a godly life we got to go through the fires of God amen we go through the fire burns away our dross that's what I'm trying to get you like every morning we got to pray and ask God to take the dross off us and then when we offer the sacrifice gallery say that praise God because it's from a pure heart a purified heart because he liked that amen thank the Lord so see seven times silver is purified each time dross is retracted from the silver and the silver solidify then it's got to be washed and purified another fiery anointing on it oh thank the Lord praise God thank God for his fiery anointing how many could say amen to that thank God those times where he comes around and he heats you up and he melts you it would ever be melted by the Lord and you feel like you're falling to pieces right here you feel like you're just dripping down he's that's what he's there to melt your desires away praise God amen to burn your desires away to apply heat to your life amen to apply pressure to your life until he burns away your selfishness or your hypocrisy or your unbelief the refining fires of God then then come to church and offer sacrifices once you're refining the fires of God once your life is and all the dross is burned out and you're clean before the Lord and you've laid in this fire praise God you've remained on the altar of God when we preach on that state keeping on yourself on the altar of God present your body as a living sacrifice so you keep your body keep your mind your thoughts on the author of God and let God's altar fire burn away all your dross when it's completely done baptize you with the Holy Ghost how many could say amen to that oh thank you lord okay now back to Philippians I want to bring that out there praise God I never really got to finish it I kind of felt bad I wonder and that's not the full finish but that's about it good that's good for now by God's grace thank the Lord so with all the power at his disposal he could ask anything you can ask the Father anything he showed his mind was I got to humble myself and I've got to obey isn't it simple church doesn't Christianity become so simple when we look at the scripture well Jesse I want to be anointed I would have Auto I don't have the mind of Christ obey praise not obey humble yourself and obey that's the mind of Christ put yourself in the fire of God in the prends of God he'll burn away any questions or any doubt any excuses they'll burn away all the dross and what's left will be pure silver oh thank the heart hallelujah remember the holiest of Holies remember the outer core had brass and silver the inner core the hold of the holy place had gold and silver but the holy place a horse voice was all gold named God see there was Redemption going on see there's redemption through justification sanctification there's a Redemption going on those seven purifying agents with the Holy of Holies there's only God there's only deity there's only the Holy Spirit their praise God hey man oh my just goes together perfectly doesn't it well thank the Lord Jesus praise God thank you lord so the mind of Christ is that I'm a great big somebody I'm equally God no it's homing yourself so I can do what God I can obey what God wants me to obey that's the anointing of God it's not well I'm the bride and look what I can do and I wrote the Bible and I can I'm a miracle worker and all these great things yeah you might be but first you got to humble yourself become obedient and do the works that the father wants you to do thank you lord okay let's clip in let's finish up here okay good now here nine through 11 is some of the most beautiful poetry scholars say they say this is some of the most beautiful poetry in all scripture some some ages have actually used this as a Creed because it's so beautiful verse nine so before we read nine again god only does this because Jesus took the mind of a servant and obedient humble lowliness of mind he only does that or he only exhaustion because Christ did that first night wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father how many people on earth right now you should bow to him praise God right the Bible says everything will bow even on earth or in heaven under the earth everything will bow and I'm talking about not just bowing on your knee I'm talking about bowing down your will and becoming obedient to the cross that's what we're talking about bowing to every word of God there's anybody at church today any Church can maou their need and you know the catholics do i will you last night with oh they got the benches there people got on there are black benches and they had their prayer beads there anybody can bow that's not what it's really talking about it's all about who can be obedient to the word glory so the highest exaltation comes to the lowest servant amen proving the way up is down the highest name the highest praise goes to the one who became the lowest of all of us the weakest of all of us the most despised of all of us the most hated of all of us the one who became the lowest now becomes the highest church don't feel bad if you're the least despised in your family praise God don't feel bad if you're the black sheep of the family don't feel bad if you're the black sheep of the church right don't feel bad if you're the black sheep of YouTube or the black sheep of the message preachers don't feel bad if you're the loved us and most despised and rejected your your duty is just to obey the word amen we just must humble ourselves and become obedient to God's will for our lives and have loneliness of mine and simply obey God's Word and the Bible said if you humble yourself God will exalt you in due season the lowest is exalted to the highest thank you lord verses twelve to sixteen I'm closing with 12 to 16 ah I was looking to verse 17 I must have to hold out for next time back that's great verse 12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed wow this is a church that always obeyed the Lord now of course we know he's talking about God right in God's sight we boys obey right because we own our souls do not sin the soul does not sin because the seed of God remains in the believer but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling oh brother Jess I'm equal with God I've got the Holy Ghost I've got a portion of eternal life in me hallelujah bless God I'm III and Paul says take them take the mind of Christ see how little you can become see how humble you can become he said work out your own salvation with fear and trembling see Church that's what's kind of I'm sure Karen and others can admit in the days past people used to come to church fearing and trembling yeah you see them praying before service they're you know they're fearing the trembling weeping what happens as time goes on you see a lot less of it seekers we're getting towards the end right going toward the end but Paul says if you've got the mind of Christ and you become a servant and humble yourself he said you'll work out your salvation with fear and trembling in other words you won't take God's word lightly right you won't take your Christian experience lightly you'll in other words you'll care about it you'll be so concerned sometimes you'll tremble in the Friends of the Lord praise God you'll be so you'll be so respectful that the Bible calls it fear and it actually means terrified it actually means terrified you're terrified in the presence of the Lord with fear and trembling and I just put this little I kind of used some of the words but I kind of twisted or not twist but I added my own little I customized it so the outworking so this these scriptures on the out working of the inward working salvation and those who have the loneliness of mind in other words this is what we'll see on the outside if you've got the mind of Christ if you and I have the mind of Christ we'll be working out our salvation in fear and trembling how many believe that there'll be times we'll be so fearful in God's presence will be trembling in God's presence right because we want to we're working it out we're trying to reach the finish line amen we're trying to be the winner of the race right Paul said run the race he said bring your body into subjection as if you would be the one who would win praise God he said approach this with fear and trembling so here's the Greek for work so work out perform your salvation with fear and trembling accomplished I like that word achieve your salvation with fear and trembling in other words reached the goal praise God you achieve it remember God is going to save us because we chose to be saved because we submit our free moral agency God's not going to force us to heaven forces to the rapture is because we decided we - we took God's present we accepted God's presence and yes I think that salvation ain't net he's not gonna force us so the part of it our victory is faith faith is our victory where we accomplish the salvation he said perform your salvation with fear and trembling now I'll say like this Johnny Graham and I used to talk about this there's times we feel like we're acting as Christians because our bodies don't feel like going to church right or our bodies don't like feel if you like reading the Bible or praying so yes church you've got to perform it you've got to go through the acts and preform the the salvation works of God you've just got to perform it until you can get under the anointing of the Holy Spirit okay cuz your body the Bible says you're your body and mind is enmity against God most of time your body and mind don't want to think about the things of God so that's why he says work it out you've got to just choose to do it you don't feel like it you just got to choose it you've got to work it out in other words let the soul let the will of the soul work out through your mind and your body bring this objection bringing the captivity and be a real worshiper of God that's good praise God huh baby thank you I'm just saying amen to the Lord here not to myself to the Lord we're performant you say you're saved performance act like you're saved be a worshiper right be obedient oh I was it be obedient to the death of the cross your cross take up your cross trembling quaking with fear I like this one who distrust that's what we saw this morning you distrust your ability you distrust your flesh right lowliness of mind I have a deep sense of my moral little littleness the Greeks said see I distrust my ability completely to meet all God's requirements my flesh is not going to meet God's requirements it doesn't want to meet God's requirements so I got to work it out I've got to just let the Holy Spirit I got to bring everything into subjection to the Holy Spirit so I can meet all the require thank the Lord now how many earlier said they want they all want the same mind how many can we get some hands out there who who said okay good this is all right this is all leaning into that we all say oh I want to be in one accord brother justice okay I do too I want to be all I want to be like minded like all the other Saints I we all want the same thing well this is what it is where we all will work out we'll perform our salvation with fear and trembling and verse 13 is beautiful now this is it right here this is what I've been trying to say the whole time for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure in other words that's living from the soul that's letting the desire of the soul live out through your life that is obeying the Holy Spirit in your soul that's obeying and submitting to the Holy Spirit in your soul it's God working through you amen if you let God work through you praise God aren't you it doesn't make it happy when you see God working through you when other people see God working through you that that's a time where you can say wow the Lord I submitted to the Lord I let the Lord work through me and this is what Paul says if you want the mind of Christ like those other brothers that preach the false doctrine they never say anything about this I never said anything about fearing trembling it was just how great they were how how equal they were with God how powerful they were but Paul says the way to do that is through fear and trembling and then when we church when we have fear and trembling then we'll actually be in a spot where we want to obey God's Word hallelujah and god only works in you to the extent you let it so see we must sacrifice our human will of our mind and our flesh in order to do his good pleasure what did I do okay now verse 14 I'm not going to spend much time on this I want to get this sixteen as as I closer 14 do all things without murmuring and disputing okay so now you know that's not the mind of Christ right if we're complaining about the mind of Christ if we're disputing it's not the mind of Christ all things verse 15 that he may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom he shine as lights in the world think about church think about all the riots going on and just think about all the lawlessness out there that's all darkness those are all bunch of dark I just saw today Portland Oregon has had what thirty four days of riots in a row things burning down everything being destroyed those are deemed those are demon filled darkness people out there they're just filled with the power of darkness but here we stand in the house of God this evening worshiping God praising God we are the light of the world praise God others will choose to submit to the darkness and live in darkness but the Bible says we shine as lights in the world when we are blameless harmless without rebuke in other words when we obey God's Word we shine as lights verse 16 holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ they have not run in vain neither labored in vain so what's this holding forth mean presenting it church all God asks us to do search out our own salvation with fear and trembling don't complain let God work through you and just ho just present the Word of Life praise God that's all we have to do we just have to present the message right just present a godly life just present holiness under people and about and Paul says that's what I'll be called for that's what I'll achieve on the day when I finish my race he says then I'll rejoice in that day that I didn't run I didn't waste my life oh how many want to make their life a real testament to Christ I want my talents I want the things God has given me to count for something I don't want it to be wasted and Paul said this is how we do it we approach our salvation with fear and trembling we let God work through us we're blameless harmless and we just present the word of life to people Paul says if I do that I know I've run a were a worthy life can I say like that your life is worthy the gospel praise God let's stand here I'll stop right there that's my last one that I had anyway musicians you're welcome to come there children isn't that beautiful Church isn't isn't this scripture just so beautiful I hope this is helping you read your Bible I'm not going to ask you raise your hands but I hope preaching like this is encouraging you and I to read our Bibles more just read right down through the scripture and see what the Holy Spirit can bring out to us now you know like brother Branham said all the people that are going to be surprised in the Day of Judgment they're going to be surprised because they didn't do what was already given to them the word that they already had the scripture was already given to him and they're going to be surprised because they're gonna think they're going to be accepted but they're not because they didn't do what was simply given to them the Word of God now how many want to do Philippians chapter 2 how many want to search out your salvation with fear and trembling how many really want the mind of Christ amen humbling yourselves obedient unto picking up your cross daily praise God let's pray father in heaven we thank you for this word that we work tonight you're gonna I've tried to you Lord I've tried to consecrate your God everywhere I know [Music] all the voices you saw the hands who wind up missing the God's will I want the mind of Christ I want to search out my salvation that's the answer that's those Souls it so they meant to that your God these times are in our society darkness [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
