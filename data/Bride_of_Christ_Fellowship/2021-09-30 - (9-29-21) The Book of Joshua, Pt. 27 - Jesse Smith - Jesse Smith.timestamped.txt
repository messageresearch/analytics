[1:26] uh
[1:27] well i'm sorry i must have wrote down
[1:28] the wrong ones here
[1:33] oh that's the birth scripture i'm sorry
[1:35] genesis 49 21 i'm sorry 49-21 i'm sorry
[1:38] i was looking at the the birth
[1:40] scriptures and mixing them up
[1:42] genesis 49 21 that's right sorry
[1:45] one verse said about naphtali as at
[1:48] least right here according to
[1:50] his father jacob
[1:54] read that together one two three now if
[1:57] tali is a hind let loose
[2:00] he giveth goodly words he's a deer
[2:04] that's set free
[2:06] and he gives good words
[2:10] strange doesn't sound strange this is
[2:11] what you speak about your son
[2:14] you're a deer let loose
[2:17] you're just running all over the
[2:18] mountains right just having your liberty
[2:19] having your freedom
[2:21] and you speak good things
[2:24] wonderful things what a prophecy
[2:26] we're going to look to that tonight here
[2:27] by god's grace let's go to philippians
[2:28] 2.
[2:30] it seems mysterious right but as you
[2:32] start thinking about christ and start
[2:33] thinking about the word it's all going
[2:35] to come together by the grace of the
[2:36] lord philippians
[2:37] 2 verses 2 and 3.
[2:54] praise the lord
[2:56] i was praying this i think it was
[2:57] yesterday morning this morning i'm
[2:58] saying lord
[3:00] just show me better how i can esteem
[3:02] others better than myself
[3:05] like how can i make brother william
[3:07] more important than me
[3:09] how can i make my children more
[3:10] important than me how can i esteem them
[3:12] better than myself
[3:14] i take care of myself i feed myself i
[3:17] brush my teeth
[3:19] but how can i esteem others better than
[3:21] myself how many want a better revelation
[3:22] of that praise god
[3:24] eternal life living for others but what
[3:26] is that i want to know more about that
[3:27] praise god
[3:28] philippians two let's read verses two
[3:30] and three ready 1 2 3 fulfill ye my joy
[3:34] that ye be like-minded having the same
[3:38] love being of one accord of one mind let
[3:42] nothing be done through strife or vain
[3:44] glory but in lowliness of mind let each
[3:48] esteem other better than themselves i
[3:51] think verse 4 kind of gives us a greater
[3:53] revelation right
[3:55] look not every man on his own things but
[3:57] every man also on the things of others
[4:00] praise god
[4:01] so church if you're aware of somebody
[4:03] that doesn't have something let me know
[4:04] or you know you you can do something too
[4:06] praise god let's have a word of prayer
[4:08] how many want that uh that desire to
[4:10] esteem others better than yourself

[5:30] praise god
[5:38] okay so let's look here to the word of
[5:39] god here tonight i trust this is going
[5:41] to be a
[5:42] blessing to you
[5:44] um
[5:45] you know i just like to uh
[5:48] real quick if you got your bible let's
[5:49] you know i i just found it interesting
[5:52] on two or three emails and and then a
[5:54] few conversations
[5:56] uh this is way off topic but i just want
[5:58] to remind you you know uh people
[6:01] people have come to me three times at
[6:02] least in the last few weeks and
[6:04] um
[6:05] they're like am i even saved
[6:07] and i'm like yes it's a free gift
[6:10] so let's just read over those scriptures
[6:11] can we let's just read over these
[6:13] uh
[6:15] verses because i just want our church to
[6:16] be encouraged you know sometimes we get
[6:18] mind battles and like these three people
[6:20] have either emailed or talked to face to
[6:22] face
[6:23] uh satan can just you know corner us
[6:25] right he can corner us and make us feel
[6:27] so bad you know and trap us in our
[6:29] thoughts and oh look at you look look at
[6:31] your sin look and no doubt we can look
[6:33] at our sin and we're ashamed of
[6:34] ourselves
[6:35] no doubt about it
[6:36] but the fact still remains that we're
[6:39] saved by grace through faith
[6:41] right that fact can never be taken away
[6:43] but satan gets us in the corner it makes
[6:45] us feel like oh you're not even saved
[6:47] and look at what you do and look how you
[6:50] look how you failed here failed there
[6:52] and church let's just be honest we fail
[6:54] all the time that's why we need a
[6:55] salvation that's why we need a lamb
[6:57] praise god but i just thought it'd be
[6:59] helpful to encourage us you know here
[7:01] tonight we can look to some of these
[7:02] scriptures here malachi can you read uh
[7:04] 15 and 16 for us
[7:08] so also is the free gift for if through
[7:11] the offense of one many be dead much
[7:13] more the grace of god the gift by grace
[7:16] which is by one man jesus christ hath
[7:18] abounded unto many
[7:20] and not as it was by the one that sinned
[7:23] so is the gift
[7:24] for the judgment was by one to
[7:26] condemnation the free gift is of many
[7:28] offenses
[7:31] amen so no notice twice did you see that
[7:33] twice it calls it a free gift
[7:36] free how many like getting gifts you
[7:37] children like getting gifts on christmas
[7:39] birthday everybody like it i like
[7:40] getting gifts too
[7:41] but that's what the bible the bible
[7:43] literally says that language how many of
[7:44] you like salvation's free a free gift to
[7:46] you is it that special is it that
[7:49] wonderful i just want to remind you i
[7:51] emailed a woman through sanctification
[7:53] baptism of holy ghost if you want to be
[7:55] fully filled with the life of christ
[7:57] that takes a little process but just
[7:59] being saved is like freely receiving a
[8:02] christmas gift
[8:03] and uh this you know this i just found
[8:05] these particular scriptures
[8:08] to be a help to about three people just
[8:10] within the last week that we just need
[8:12] reminders many times that god is so
[8:14] loving he just wants to offer this as a
[8:17] free gift i like what the bible says
[8:20] there
[8:21] through jesus christ this free gift has
[8:23] abounded to many amen hallelujah many
[8:27] people have received this free gift over
[8:29] the course of the 2000 years right since
[8:31] uh christianity was was birthed on the
[8:33] day of pentecost praise god but it's a
[8:36] free gift uh
[8:38] and uh the bible says the free gift is
[8:41] of many offenses
[8:42] unto justification listen we have many
[8:44] offensive you i've you have many
[8:46] failures if you follow me along a lot
[8:48] around enough you're gonna find many
[8:50] offenses but that doesn't take away from
[8:52] the free gift of god amen that in fact
[8:55] that magnifies how great god's grace is
[8:59] and it says many offenses unto
[9:01] justification praise god amen just i
[9:05] just i just want to just remind you
[9:06] those few things here and i'm going to
[9:09] read 17
[9:10] first by one man's offense death reign
[9:12] by one
[9:13] much more they which receive abundance
[9:15] of grace and of the gift of
[9:17] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[9:20] jesus christ so once you receive the
[9:23] gift you're so grateful by that gift you
[9:25] reign over sin right because you've got
[9:28] a gift you have grace you have favor
[9:30] because i favor i'm now reigning over
[9:33] sin in my life because i received jesus
[9:36] christ's great gift to me amen
[9:39] as one of offense uh judgment came upon
[9:41] all men to condemnation even so by the
[9:44] righteousness of one man the free gift
[9:47] came upon all men unto justification of
[9:50] life amen because one man all died but
[9:53] because of one man all live and all can
[9:55] be saved amen
[9:57] a free gift so three times church three
[9:59] times paul says it yeah in a matter of a
[10:02] few breaths we'd say he's reminding us
[10:05] of this free gift praise god
[10:07] hallelujah
[10:11] so it's by it wasn't by our obedience
[10:13] we're made righteous can i just
[10:14] emphasize that by the obedience of one
[10:17] many shall be made righteous i'm not
[10:19] righteous by my
[10:21] works it's the works of christ that
[10:23] makes me righteous
[10:24] amen and the devil he can't argue with
[10:27] this amen hallelujah he can't argue with
[10:29] that that's the unfailing unchanging
[10:31] word of god amen and if i've received
[10:33] the gift of god then i'm justified amen
[10:36] i'm made righteous in his sight through
[10:38] the work of christ all i have to do is
[10:40] repent amen
[10:42] i just got to repent and then the bible
[10:44] says that grace did much more bound to
[10:46] us praise god through the grace of jesus
[10:49] christ
[10:50] amen sinneth reigned unto life even so
[10:52] might grace reign through righteousness
[10:55] unto eternal life by jesus christ our
[10:58] lord church what is reigning in our
[11:00] lives our lives are reigning by grace
[11:03] praise god grace is protecting our lives
[11:05] grace is is giving us jesus
[11:08] righteousness it's given us favor in
[11:10] heaven so let's be thankful for the free
[11:12] gift tonight can we give god a round of
[11:13] applause for the free gift of god's
[11:15] grace
[11:16] three scriptures church it's a free gift
[11:19] praise god and it just is bestowed upon
[11:21] us amen
[11:23] hallelujah and of course it was by a
[11:24] predestination god knew you'd want it
[11:26] that's why he sent it to you
[11:28] hallelujah all right i just want to
[11:29] start with that because i was so strike
[11:32] i was praying about that i'm like my
[11:33] goodness three people have asked me this
[11:34] week am i saved and what's wrong and
[11:37] i've just the holy spirit's brought me
[11:38] back to that scripture it's a free gift
[11:40] there's nothing you did to do it it was
[11:42] christ's righteousness that gave it to
[11:44] you amen the substitution right the
[11:46] substitutionary replacement he was your
[11:48] substitute and therefore his
[11:50] righteousness comes upon you amen
[11:52] all right now i showed this on sunday
[11:54] night i think i don't think i showed it
[11:55] on sunday morning
[11:58] but there's at least two of the tribes
[12:00] that had prophecy about land that i've
[12:02] studied so far
[12:03] in the blue zebulun uh
[12:06] he's at the haven of the sea and i
[12:07] haven't preached on zebulun yet but the
[12:09] bible says he's by the sea and you can
[12:11] find him on the map that's exactly where
[12:13] he's by he's right by the sea
[12:16] uh and also mentions the mountain so
[12:17] there's one particular mountain in his
[12:19] region i don't know which one it is yet
[12:20] because i haven't studied it but the
[12:22] bible lists that issachar's kind of
[12:24] questionable um it mentions kind of a
[12:26] pleasant land
[12:27] and the mountain again with zebulun so
[12:30] they they're pretty close together asher
[12:32] mentions bread and yield from the ground
[12:34] but not much on lunch about his land in
[12:37] particular
[12:38] and then gad pardon me mentions a
[12:40] portion of the lawgiver
[12:42] uh does this portion mean judah's land i
[12:44] don't know now we're looking at tonight
[12:46] here we're looking at naphtali
[12:49] i hope i'm saying that right everybody
[12:50] says it different everything i've read
[12:51] and listened to they all say different
[12:53] you know so i'm just going the best i
[12:54] can i'm not a hebrew so at least not
[12:57] physically
[12:58] the bible says naftali is to possess
[13:01] thou the west and the south so that
[13:03] gives us some direction
[13:05] right some placement in the land and
[13:08] asher mentions he had his foot in oil i
[13:10] haven't studied this one out yet but
[13:11] maybe the lord willing sunday we'll get
[13:13] to this one what does that mean i'm not
[13:15] quite sure what that means
[13:16] because oil get it from a few different
[13:18] places right you get it from the ground
[13:19] but the most common way they got it was
[13:21] from the fig tree right or i'm sorry the
[13:23] olive tree the olive trees where they
[13:24] would get oil from the olives right
[13:27] so that's interesting oh so we'll get to
[13:29] that now so from my studies to date
[13:32] there's nothing prophesied about land
[13:35] for reuben simeon levi judah benjamin
[13:39] and dan so half of the brothers at least
[13:42] what i can see so far there's no mention
[13:44] of land
[13:45] okay
[13:46] but there is mention about warnings and
[13:48] blessings all right
[13:50] so the ones we covered so far i put in
[13:52] red so we preached on reuben uh levi
[13:55] judah simeon and dan
[13:57] and so let's just review those briefly
[14:00] reuben was the oldest but he was
[14:01] disgraced and actually demoted from his
[14:05] oldest child position
[14:07] all the authority as priests of the
[14:08] family and the blessings he was all
[14:10] demoted from that for a sexual sin right
[14:13] and he was never able to really get the
[14:15] victory over that he was unstable as
[14:17] water
[14:18] right we saw that on sunday that we
[14:19] don't always can anchor in the word of
[14:21] god amen
[14:22] but see reuben was disgraced and he
[14:24] ultimately came to shame as far as his
[14:26] tribe now he himself was saved
[14:29] but
[14:30] ultimately he didn't have a blessing
[14:32] because he turned on the blessing
[14:35] okay and we looked at simeon and levi
[14:38] and we saw how they both were together
[14:40] they were partners in crime but one was
[14:43] disgraced simeon and the other one was
[14:45] exalted levi
[14:47] and god was showing his mercy and god
[14:50] was so merciful that god gave him uh the
[14:53] position of priests in the family praise
[14:56] god
[14:56] uh to minister there in the presence of
[14:59] god with the urim and thumb amen and the
[15:01] ark of the covenant and we also saw how
[15:04] judah he took the lead he was exalted
[15:06] because he was
[15:07] such a wonderful son he was exalted to
[15:10] the lead so god pulled down reuben and
[15:12] raised up judah and gave judah the
[15:15] biggest portion of land
[15:17] because judo was going to have amazing
[15:19] testimony out of out of judah became
[15:21] great men like caleb right afnil
[15:24] and all the way down to david and then
[15:26] solomon and all the good kings
[15:28] jehoshaphat right all the uh all these
[15:31] great kings asa good man of god josiah
[15:34] wonderful men of god god saw that in
[15:36] their lineage that they were going to
[15:38] produce those great things amen
[15:40] and so god exalted judah and said even
[15:43] the messiah i'm going to give judah the
[15:46] scepter praise god and and he will reign
[15:49] with the scepter until shiloh come and
[15:51] that was christ amen and then christ
[15:54] come and then now christ can i say it
[15:55] tonight christ has the scepter tonight
[15:58] amen hallelujah he's the one ruling in
[16:00] the kingdom of god praise god and we
[16:03] have the name of jesus christ that's
[16:04] what we rule by today amen right the
[16:07] lord the name of the lord is the strong
[16:09] tower the righteous run into it and they
[16:11] are saved amen so christ still has the
[16:14] scepter tonight amen but he's in heaven
[16:17] he's ruling in heaven and his rule has
[16:19] come down to the bride of jesus christ
[16:21] who's ruling the kingdom of god here on
[16:24] the earth
[16:25] until the tribulation period hallelujah
[16:28] now dan
[16:30] had a nice start with uh samson
[16:33] had a nice 20-year reign but uh but then
[16:36] of course he was lived a life that was
[16:38] constantly back and forth but then
[16:40] ultimately after uh samson not long
[16:42] after that he was his tribe was
[16:44] disgraced with idolatry we read this on
[16:46] sunday night
[16:47] where dan let uh king jeroboam build a
[16:51] calf and put a calf in in dan and i
[16:53] believe the other one was in
[16:55] yeah manasseh if you're not mistaken
[16:57] right and then of course later in hosea
[16:59] that's where uh ephraim got got their
[17:01] idols
[17:02] and that's where uh uh dan and eve
[17:06] remove
[17:07] from the tribes of israel
[17:09] okay so we've been through those one two
[17:11] three four we've been through five now
[17:13] right so tonight we'll look at uh
[17:15] naftali by the grace of god and this i
[17:17] just studied this this morning and this
[17:18] afternoon and i i just found some
[17:20] wonderful things i hope it'll be a
[17:21] blessing to you okay so here's a little
[17:23] a map now i'm gonna zoom in
[17:25] but naphtali's here
[17:28] okay so it's right by the sea of galilee
[17:30] uh now here's the jordan jordan runs
[17:33] down here jericho's way down here so
[17:35] look at all the miles naphtali is north
[17:38] kind of heading up into uh
[17:40] asia and europe over here so it's quite
[17:42] a far ways north
[17:44] than when you know when joshua possessed
[17:46] the land here
[17:48] and uh you came in and got the victory
[17:50] there's gilgal jericho jerusalem's all
[17:52] the way down here bethel it's quite a
[17:54] ways up there
[17:56] to naftali
[17:58] it's a nice chunk of lamb but of course
[18:00] not the biggest or anything we'd say
[18:02] like that
[18:03] uh but it's a nice portion so here it is
[18:05] zoomed in a little bit you know you
[18:06] might be you're probably only familiar
[18:08] like me i was only familiar with
[18:09] capernaum i wasn't really familiar with
[18:10] any of these other ones
[18:12] key dish is not kadesh that's a
[18:14] different one
[18:15] all these other ones i wasn't really
[18:16] familiar with but i was familiar with
[18:18] capernaum how many familiar with that
[18:20] we'll end the service with capernaum
[18:22] we'll get there by the end by the grace
[18:23] of god but this is the the land given to
[18:27] and i look at his portions bigger than
[18:29] zebulun bigger than issachar about the
[18:31] same as asher
[18:32] uh you know but not as big as some of
[18:34] these other ones on the other side so
[18:36] that kind of gives you just a picture
[18:38] of his his size of his land for the
[18:41] tribe so if you let's read these because
[18:43] we have time here tonight let's read
[18:44] these uh maybe we'll get our bibles here
[18:47] genesis 29 7-8
[18:51] and then i'll get to deuteronomy 33 as
[18:53] well
[18:54] yeah genesis 29 7-8
[18:58] here's the birth scripture so you can
[19:00] see what is his name right because
[19:02] remember we were just we're trying to
[19:03] balance out the quotes where brother
[19:04] brown said each of the mothers
[19:05] prophesied about where they would be in
[19:07] the land we can't find that in the
[19:08] scripture that's okay we take everything
[19:10] back to the word it wasn't spoken with
[19:12] us saith the lord uh but it was brother
[19:14] and he said let's say that's what it
[19:15] means so he was just doing his best as
[19:17] he uh would preach the word of god and
[19:20] in the time that he had to study when he
[19:22] wasn't praying for the sick right making
[19:24] sick calls and and envisions and
[19:26] interviews and all the ministries that
[19:28] he had
[19:29] so genesis 29 7-8
[19:34] and he said lo it is yet high day
[19:36] neither it is time that the cattle
[19:38] should be gathered together water ye the
[19:40] sheep and go and feed them
[19:43] verse eight and they say we cannot until
[19:45] all the flocks be gathered till they
[19:46] roll
[19:47] the stone from the well's mouth
[19:50] then we water the sheep okay that's not
[19:52] the scripture i must have wrote down the
[19:54] wrong one here
[19:56] forgive me
[20:01] let me tap it in there real quick
[20:08] okay
[20:09] yeah it's chapter 30 sorry not 28 i
[20:12] wrote the wrong one chapter 37 8 sorry
[20:18] genesis 37-8 but i'm just glad i can
[20:20] find it praise god thank god for the
[20:22] phone
[20:23] now 7-8 and bilhah rachel's maid
[20:26] conceived again and bear jacob a second
[20:28] son and rachel said with great
[20:30] wrestlings have i wrestled with my
[20:32] sister and i have prevailed and she
[20:35] called his name
[20:36] naftali
[20:38] okay
[20:39] so this didn't this didn't even come by
[20:41] rachel it came by rachel's maid this is
[20:43] the one that reuben slept with right
[20:46] right so remember uh so we have to
[20:49] balance out the quotes right so we see
[20:50] here we see nothing talked about land
[20:53] naphtali is named after what bill or
[20:55] what rachel was going through
[20:58] as she gave
[20:59] jacob her handmaid
[21:01] she was i'm wrestling with my sister
[21:03] leah
[21:05] it's a
[21:06] that's what that's what naphtali is
[21:07] named after the wrestling
[21:10] that she had with her sister
[21:12] how would you like to be named after a
[21:14] family struggle right
[21:15] a sibling rivalry how would you like to
[21:17] be named after a sibling rivalry
[21:19] that's a naphtali
[21:21] he's wrestle right she wrestled but i
[21:23] like it she prevailed amen i've wrestled
[21:27] but i prevailed
[21:28] because god gave me another son now it
[21:30] wasn't through her it was through her
[21:33] sir or her maidservant bilhah
[21:36] okay so i can't find brother and giving
[21:38] this uh giving any name to naftali
[21:40] there's only three quotes in the whole
[21:41] message about naftali and it all deals
[21:43] with the tribes of israel being placed
[21:45] in their different places
[21:47] okay now let's go to jacob's prophecy
[21:49] i'm sorry yeah we read this one but i'll
[21:51] read again genesis 49 21 we'll try to
[21:53] keep you moving here in the word of god
[21:56] one scripture naphtali is a hind let
[21:59] loose
[22:01] he giveth goodly words
[22:05] so
[22:06] this is quite strange
[22:08] he's compared to a deer
[22:10] right or a stag
[22:13] and he says he has goodly words have you
[22:15] ever heard a deer talk to you
[22:17] no but somehow
[22:18] somehow the holy spirit sees in naphtali
[22:22] a deer
[22:23] and then he sees goodly words through
[22:25] naphtali's life
[22:28] seems like a very strange connection
[22:29] right how are these connected i think
[22:31] we'll see by the end now go to
[22:33] deuteronomy 33 verse 23
[22:38] and hope we're getting real deep and
[22:40] rich in the scriptures here now praise
[22:41] god
[22:43] hallelujah 20 33 23 and of naphtali he
[22:47] said oh natalie satisfied with favor and
[22:49] look at that
[22:50] god gave him favor
[22:53] and full with the blessing of the lord
[22:56] possess thou the west
[22:59] and the south
[23:01] possess now the west
[23:03] and the south
[23:07] now i i do
[23:10] uh the word west here means west of the
[23:12] sea of galilee so if you go back to
[23:15] west
[23:17] and then it's south of
[23:19] syria area
[23:21] because so he said be thou the west
[23:24] south
[23:25] okay or perhaps it means the southern
[23:27] part of naphtali i'm not quite sure what
[23:29] the south part means but i know west
[23:30] means west here
[23:32] uh of of the the river here the lake
[23:34] hula here or
[23:37] so this is west and then south so i'm
[23:39] not quite sure what the south means but
[23:40] here you can see west
[23:42] of the sea of galilee
[23:44] all right
[23:45] so that's that's quite a scripture now
[23:47] i'm doing a little bit of reading here
[23:48] to kind of build up some background to
[23:50] give you some idea yeah brother
[23:55] did i say 23.
[23:59] deuteronomy 33 23. did i get that right
[24:02] yeah that's right okay sorry about that
[24:04] brother while i'm here though i'm gonna
[24:06] fix that
[24:07] because that was chapter
[24:09] yeah that was 30.
[24:12] right and then deuteronomy 33 let me
[24:14] check that 23. yeah yeah that should be
[24:16] right by god's grace yeah thank you
[24:20] all right
[24:22] so this is one of the the few brothers
[24:24] that had a prophecy about their land
[24:27] okay
[24:29] now let's read a little bit here
[24:31] now the easton's bible dictionary just
[24:33] this is general information about the
[24:34] tribe of naftali
[24:36] okay he says jacob says you're a hind
[24:39] let loose you give goodly words it's
[24:41] intended us to set forth under poetic
[24:43] imagery the future character and history
[24:46] of the tribe
[24:47] at the time of the exodus this tribe
[24:49] numbered 53 000 but the close they were
[24:52] only 45
[24:54] thousand along with dan and asher they
[24:56] formed the camp of dan under a common
[24:58] standard so they were by the eagle
[25:00] standard
[25:02] which is interesting as we'll look to
[25:03] later occupying a place during the march
[25:05] on the north side of the tabernacle
[25:08] which is interesting there on the north
[25:09] part of the land as well so just that's
[25:11] just interesting i don't really have any
[25:12] revelation on that
[25:16] but their possession assigned to set
[25:17] forth in joshua 19 it's in the north
[25:20] eastern corner of the land bounded on
[25:21] the east by the jordan and the lakes of
[25:24] mariam and galilee on the on the north
[25:26] extended to the far into cole syria the
[25:29] valley between the two lebanon
[25:31] ranges
[25:32] now look at this
[25:33] it's comprehended a greater variety of
[25:36] rich and beautiful scenery
[25:38] and of soil and climate than fell to the
[25:40] lot of any other tribe
[25:43] so the scenery and soil was more
[25:46] beautiful than any other tribe
[25:48] so when you want to see a beautiful
[25:50] place in israel that's where you'd go
[25:52] naftali they're the prettiest land and
[25:55] the most beautiful soil of all of them
[25:58] and isn't that what the bible said that
[25:59] he'd be full of blessings
[26:01] right
[26:03] moses said you're going to be full of
[26:05] blessings and so god gave them the most
[26:07] beautiful land to look at because have
[26:09] you i saw a video today of the sea of
[26:12] galilee it's just a beautiful calm most
[26:14] the time it's calm right sometimes
[26:15] sudden storms would come in that's when
[26:17] jesus would walk on the water or rebuke
[26:19] the storms
[26:20] but it's such a beautiful peaceful place
[26:22] people still love going there today and
[26:24] they just love sitting by the beautiful
[26:26] seaside of the sea of galilee it's such
[26:28] a such a very popular place for tourists
[26:32] to go because it's so beautiful it's the
[26:34] only fresh water in all of israel
[26:37] and so the holy spirit said
[26:39] uh you're going to get the blessing
[26:41] you're going to possess the west and the
[26:43] south and you're going to be satisfied
[26:45] with my favor amen
[26:47] and that's what they got
[26:49] it's about 800 square miles double that
[26:51] of issachar
[26:52] we'll get to that one later
[26:56] now here's where we're going to start
[26:57] getting in some the spiritual aspect of
[27:00] this a large number of the foreigners
[27:02] settled here among the mountains and
[27:04] hence it's called galilee of the
[27:06] gentiles
[27:08] so that's interesting now we start get
[27:10] the gentiles in here
[27:12] hallelujah right the southern portion of
[27:15] natalie has been called the garden of
[27:18] palestine
[27:20] because it's such a place of favor the
[27:23] bible said and
[27:24] full of the blessings of the lord
[27:27] amen it's like a garden place right
[27:32] it was un it was of unrivaled fertility
[27:37] it was the principal scene of our lord's
[27:39] public ministry
[27:42] here most of his parables were spoken
[27:44] and his miracles wrought did you catch
[27:46] that church
[27:47] the majority of jesus's preaching
[27:50] took place in naphtali
[27:54] the majority of jesus's miracles in the
[27:57] bible now because remember the whole
[27:58] world couldn't contain all that jesus
[28:00] did but as far as the the miracle
[28:04] bible the majority of them took place
[28:07] in naphtali
[28:10] there's something special about this
[28:12] land
[28:13] hallelujah
[28:16] now getting back to natural things the
[28:18] tribe though was the first to suffer the
[28:20] invasion of ben haydad in 1st kings 15.
[28:25] when they swept over the whole north of
[28:27] israel and carried the people into
[28:29] captivity
[28:30] so that was a very sad part but then the
[28:32] kingdom of israel came to an end and
[28:34] seven uh the northern part came in in
[28:35] 722 bc
[28:39] naphtali though now is almost holy like
[28:41] a desert now this was written uh i don't
[28:44] know how long this might maybe a hundred
[28:45] years ago it'd be interesting to see
[28:46] where it's at now
[28:49] okay
[28:50] uh
[28:51] so that's just interesting you know this
[28:53] is the natural turn or natural result of
[28:56] the tribe it was uh invaded and then uh
[29:00] uh you know it lost a lot of its
[29:02] fruitfulness over the years
[29:05] now if you got uh we don't have to turn
[29:07] there but uh the only really important
[29:09] historical event which is concerned is
[29:12] the defeat of javen's host which is
[29:15] celebrated in the song of deborah and
[29:17] barrack
[29:18] in this passage we may study the
[29:20] character of the tribe
[29:22] okay so in other words naphtali joined
[29:25] with their their soldiers and they
[29:27] brought him down to fight with deborah
[29:29] and barrack when they defeated their
[29:31] enemies remember they sang a beautiful
[29:33] song
[29:34] so that's the only thing we can see from
[29:36] their history that was really
[29:37] outstanding
[29:39] okay other than the natural blessings
[29:41] where the bible said they had full
[29:42] blessings okay
[29:45] now
[29:50] there's uh
[29:51] a few scriptures i'd like to get to here
[29:53] in a few moments here now we're gonna
[29:55] turn to matthew four so we're gonna turn
[29:57] to matthew four here
[30:00] this is quite a amazing text here
[30:04] so of course i've read this before but
[30:05] i've never been uh kind of struck by the
[30:08] the importance of this until today
[30:10] actually
[30:13] so four met let's go to matthew 4 verse
[30:14] 12. i know that says 13. let's go to
[30:16] matthew 4 verse 12.
[30:27] church did you know that scripture
[30:28] foretold that jesus christ would spend a
[30:31] lot of his time in naphtali
[30:34] and zebulun that was new to me i read it
[30:38] but i never got the understanding
[30:41] and scripture says this is a fulfillment
[30:43] of prophecy
[30:45] okay so if you look at verse 12. now
[30:47] verse 11 jesus was just tempted the
[30:49] devil right he was tempted that we
[30:51] overcome we know the three attacks from
[30:52] satan no man could be tempted like that
[30:54] but jesus overcame everyone not by a
[30:56] miracle but by obeying the word of god
[31:00] verse 12 now when jesus had heard that
[31:02] john was cast in the prison he departed
[31:04] into
[31:05] galilee now galilee contains vulneran
[31:08] and naphtali's land
[31:11] northern israel
[31:13] so jesus gets the holy ghost he goes out
[31:16] for 40 days he defeats satan once he
[31:18] gets strengthened by the angels he says
[31:20] i'm going up to naphtali
[31:22] i'm going up this villain
[31:25] praise god because there's something
[31:27] special about that place
[31:31] verse 13. and leaving nazareth he came
[31:34] and dwell in
[31:36] capernaum
[31:38] which is upon the seacoast in the
[31:40] borders of zabulon and
[31:43] naphthalim
[31:46] that it might be fulfilled which was
[31:48] spoken by isaiah's the prophet saying
[31:50] the land of zebulun and the land of
[31:52] natalie by the way of the sea beyond
[31:54] jordan galilee of the
[31:58] gentiles my hallelujah so right after
[32:01] gets the holy ghost he follows the holy
[32:04] ghost up north
[32:06] to a land that has both jew and gentiles
[32:10] amen
[32:11] hallelujah jesus wasn't just going
[32:13] anywhere he wanted he was going where
[32:15] the holy ghost was directing him to go
[32:19] can i say it like this brother william
[32:20] he went swiftly there praise god
[32:23] like a deer amen
[32:25] hallelujah praise god amen
[32:28] god knew there was a certain place he
[32:30] was supposed to go
[32:33] glory
[32:35] now what was the prophecy why was this
[32:37] so important
[32:39] verse 16
[32:41] because it was fulfilling prophecy in
[32:42] verse 16. the people which sat in
[32:45] darkness saw great
[32:47] light
[32:49] and to them which sat in the region in
[32:51] shadow of death light is sprung up
[32:54] so this was a place of death
[32:57] but god sent christ there
[33:00] quickly to be light to them it was this
[33:03] they were under the shadow of death amen
[33:06] there's a it's death it's dark and so
[33:09] god said i'm going to send my light
[33:10] there to give them a light and to
[33:12] brighten them up praise god
[33:15] this is a land that had fallen away
[33:16] right they were they were taken captive
[33:18] and then they'd come back right but it
[33:20] was still a place of darkness so god
[33:23] said i'm going to send my son jesus
[33:24] there and he's going to bring them my
[33:26] light
[33:28] amen praise god
[33:31] then what happens verse 17 church did
[33:33] you know this where did jesus preach
[33:36] first amen he preached first in zabulon
[33:40] and naphtali amen
[33:42] his first preaching glory his free his
[33:45] first goodly words amen
[33:48] came to naftali and zebulun by the plan
[33:51] of god amen that was an accident that
[33:54] was prophesied 1500 years earlier amen
[33:58] hallelujah praise god god has a provided
[34:01] place god knows if there's darkness god
[34:04] knows i know just where to send the
[34:06] light to amen church that's how our
[34:08] lives were our lives were buried in
[34:10] darkness but god gave us a great life
[34:12] hallelujah
[34:14] amen hallelujah
[34:16] thank god and it came swiftly
[34:18] and it came with goodly words amen
[34:22] hallelujah praise god
[34:24] thank you jesus
[34:26] verse 17 from that time jesus began to
[34:28] preach that's when he began preaching
[34:32] and to say repent for the kingdom of
[34:34] heaven is at hand
[34:36] hallelujah
[34:38] who did jesus preach you first
[34:40] naphtali and zebulun
[34:42] it was prophetic god wanted him there
[34:45] amen god wanted his deer to run there
[34:48] praise god hallelujah and he went in
[34:51] there you hear the gospel
[34:53] god always does that can you say like
[34:55] that god god's always sending light
[34:57] hallelujah
[34:59] oh thank god you know what history says
[35:04] did you know this church shocking this
[35:05] morning fella i really said
[35:08] most of jesus disciples
[35:11] were from these two tribes
[35:16] most of his disciples were from naphtali
[35:20] or zebulun
[35:22] hallelujah when nebuchadnezzar won over
[35:24] the land he replaced many people in the
[35:26] land
[35:28] the area became more gentile later from
[35:30] intermarriage of jews and gentiles the
[35:32] people were called samaritans
[35:35] but did you catch that most of jesus's
[35:37] disciples
[35:39] were from naphtali or zebulun that that
[35:42] land region
[35:44] now it's interesting uh
[35:46] jacob's prophecy says the other tribes
[35:48] would admire him
[35:50] so the meaning of this is unclear it may
[35:53] indicate this tribe would have an easier
[35:54] life than the other tribes because of
[35:56] their fertile land
[35:57] uh the sea of galilee the fresh water it
[35:59] was right there next to them they didn't
[36:00] have to do any work for the fresh water
[36:03] or i believe
[36:05] they would admire them because of the
[36:07] future ministry of christ the messiah
[36:11] see just like judah judah had prophecy
[36:13] about the messiah that wasn't uncommon
[36:15] when jacob you know jacob said that
[36:17] that's part of it right
[36:18] the scepter would come to judah and
[36:20] they'd reign until it came to shiloh
[36:22] there was already prophecy about the
[36:24] messiah so it appears here now naphtali
[36:27] is getting some prophecy or not really
[36:29] about the tribe themselves but later the
[36:33] messiah that would come to that portion
[36:36] of that land in the area of naphtali and
[36:39] zebulun amen in other words jacob was
[36:42] talking about christ amen
[36:44] and those disciples
[36:46] hallelujah
[36:48] oh my thank you jesus let's go there
[36:50] let's go to isaiah 9. i'll show you
[36:52] where this is talking this is speaking
[36:53] of isaiah 9 verses 1 and 2.
[37:01] and church you know what this really
[37:03] makes me want to preach brother i don't
[37:05] know if you've been here when i said
[37:06] this but one of my next uh sermon series
[37:09] i want to do is called
[37:11] the life of jesus of nazareth i just
[37:12] want to preach on his whole life i want
[37:14] to place these all together brother i
[37:16] think we're going to find some real deep
[37:17] rich things here
[37:19] that's going to be a that's going to be
[37:20] a long study
[37:21] i'm gonna preach his whole life from
[37:22] beginning to end if the lord would let
[37:24] me and you know why it's it's important
[37:26] because the bible says our ministry have
[37:28] to match christ's ministry as the
[37:30] headstone comes down
[37:31] it's gotta fit perfectly on laodicea
[37:34] right so our ministry has to exactly
[37:36] match jesus christ and it's very easy to
[37:38] do because jesus was led by the holy
[37:40] spirit and as long as we're led by the
[37:42] holy spirit then we match the ministry
[37:44] of christ
[37:45] no matter how humble because we don't
[37:46] have to do the whole thing brother
[37:47] william we just got to do our portion of
[37:49] jesus's ministry amen we have a portion
[37:52] of the fullness of god the bible says
[37:55] we have a portion of that right
[37:57] that's what the bible said the fullness
[37:59] of the portion given to us i just
[38:00] preached on that on sunday we don't have
[38:02] the fullness in us but we get a portion
[38:04] of his fullness
[38:07] in other words our ministry doesn't have
[38:08] to do everything but our ministry has to
[38:10] play the part that god has given to us
[38:13] and the church said amen and how do you
[38:15] do that you follow the leading of the
[38:16] holy spirit very simple jesus said i do
[38:19] nothing except the father showeth me
[38:21] first amen and everything we're doing
[38:23] tonight is because the father showed us
[38:25] it first
[38:26] right we're supposed to gather more
[38:27] we're supposed to feed on the preaching
[38:29] of the word right we're supposed to let
[38:30] the fivefold ministry uh help us to be
[38:33] edify us right strengthen us help us to
[38:35] grow up in the knowledge of god amen
[38:37] everything we're doing tonight is what
[38:39] the bible told us to do and we're doing
[38:41] what the scripture tells us amen
[38:45] isaiah 9 isaiah 9
[38:48] 1-2
[38:50] nevertheless the dimness shall not be
[38:52] such as was in her vexation when at the
[38:54] first he lightly afflicted the land of
[38:56] zebulun and the land of naphtali and
[38:58] afterward did more grievously afflict
[39:00] her by the way of the seed beyond jordan
[39:02] in galilee of the nations
[39:04] the people that walked in darkness have
[39:07] seen a great light
[39:09] they that dwell in the land of the
[39:11] shadow of death upon them half the light
[39:14] shined
[39:16] praise god this these were tribes that
[39:18] were backslidden right they were the
[39:20] first ones to be taken over right uh
[39:22] taken to assyria but yet god promises
[39:26] even in their dark state i'm going to
[39:27] eventually send them the light in other
[39:30] words i'm going to send them my son the
[39:32] only begotten son of the father the lord
[39:34] jesus christ and he is the light of the
[39:36] world amen
[39:39] this land especially this land was going
[39:42] to be visited with the messiah
[39:46] praise god
[39:49] now i'm going to read this here uh it's
[39:51] from john gill a preacher from the 1800s
[39:55] now he says naphtali is a hind let loose
[39:59] now one man says his lot fell in a good
[40:02] land and his inheritance a fruit-bearing
[40:04] one was was as the most fruitful country
[40:06] of geneserit which gave the name to a
[40:09] sea or lake by which abounded with
[40:11] gardens with palm trees fig trees olive
[40:13] trees which josephus says one might call
[40:15] the ambition of nature and strabo a
[40:18] heathen writer says of it it was a happy
[40:21] blessed country and bearing all sorts of
[40:23] good things and another historian said
[40:26] uh this is the veil of jenna jenna
[40:28] gasarit where it was which was as quick
[40:30] to bring forth through as a hind is
[40:32] swift to run
[40:34] okay
[40:34] so different riders will say well this
[40:37] this this phrase a hind let loose it
[40:39] means how quick the plants brought forth
[40:42] how quick the trees brought forth and
[40:43] that could be true but we know scripture
[40:46] has compound prophecy and the church
[40:47] said
[40:49] amen that's right
[40:51] now
[40:52] it says here
[40:55] let me go down here
[40:56] some will have this prophecy to be
[40:58] fulfilled in barrack which i believe too
[41:00] because that's multiple prophecies so
[41:02] barrick and
[41:03] deborah who was of this tribe so barrack
[41:05] was of the tribe of naphtali
[41:09] and who at first was fearful like the
[41:11] hind this is interesting right because
[41:13] remember he said i'm not going up there
[41:15] deborah unless you go with me
[41:17] remember a man now think of that a man
[41:19] in bible days a man saying i'm not going
[41:21] without the woman
[41:23] i mean that don't sound like an old
[41:24] testament saint
[41:26] he probably said like you stay here i'll
[41:28] go myself
[41:29] but it showed how he's
[41:31] fearful like the hind and backward to go
[41:34] out to war when called but afterwards
[41:37] readily went out with deborah who at
[41:38] last gave goodly words
[41:41] in the song they both sang
[41:44] so that's a beautiful thought
[41:46] right
[41:47] so we can see compound prophecy but it
[41:50] better describes the genius disposition
[41:52] and manners of the tribe who are kind
[41:54] and loving swift and expedient in their
[41:56] affairs lovers of liberty well-spoken
[41:58] persons humane affable courteous and
[42:01] pleasing languages follows okay
[42:05] so to me i can see the hind in barrack
[42:08] and deborah and the good words
[42:10] because he was fearful but yet when he
[42:12] got the goodly words then he was that he
[42:14] could he was very graceful right they
[42:16] got the victory god gave them the
[42:18] victory so we can see at least the
[42:19] prophecy there fulfilled in deborah and
[42:22] barrack all right
[42:24] now here's here's the the christ this is
[42:27] what i want to get to and i've got about
[42:28] 10 minutes here if i keep my 45 minutes
[42:32] he giveth goodly word so natalie would
[42:35] give good words
[42:37] to those he converses with it may be
[42:39] applied particularly to christ and his
[42:42] disciples to the inhabitants of this
[42:44] tribe in his in his time
[42:46] among whom they were much
[42:48] uh he himself is compared to the hind of
[42:50] the morning in a title or a row or a
[42:53] heart
[42:53] uh song of solomon 2 9 and song of
[42:56] solomon 8 14. let's get your bibles
[42:59] let's go there

[43:45] flings out too far they're just so
[43:47] graceful i mean they're just
[43:49] they're so beautiful they're so swift
[43:51] and quick
[43:52] and the schulamite says oh the voice of
[43:55] my beloved
[43:57] he said he's like see skipping upon the
[43:59] hills just frolicking around now let's
[44:01] all read verse nine ready one two three
[44:04] my beloved is like a row or a young
[44:07] heart behold he standeth behind our wall
[44:11] he looking forth at the windows showing
[44:14] himself through my lattice
[44:18] right he's like a deer out there just
[44:20] looking at you
[44:21] he's like swiftly coming down he leaps
[44:24] upon the mountains the woman is saying
[44:26] this about the husband
[44:28] he's like a deer so swift and quiet and
[44:30] gentle looking at me through the lattice
[44:34] who did solomon represent he represented
[44:36] jesus christ amen looking through the
[44:39] lattice which means he's not fully
[44:41] revealed right we kind of see through a
[44:43] glass darkly amen praise god but we hear
[44:46] his voice and his voice skips down to us
[44:49] oh the words of christ come so
[44:51] pleasantly amen they can come so quickly
[44:54] in service amen we might not be
[44:56] expecting it but we can see it come down
[44:58] so gracefully oh the grace of god flows
[45:01] down to us
[45:02] amen like a deer praise god
[45:05] amen
[45:08] oh that's beautiful
[45:10] that's and that's the holy spirit church
[45:12] that ain't me that's the holy ghost
[45:14] saying solomon is typing christ
[45:16] like a deer
[45:18] he's so gentle he's so quiet he's so
[45:20] graceful and beautiful
[45:22] he swoops down from the mountains
[45:25] like he's just falling down just just
[45:27] gracefully coming down oh he's so
[45:28] beautiful how he comes
[45:32] hallelujah thank god amen
[45:36] uh chapter 8
[45:38] verse 14. do you remember when i
[45:40] preached this not long ago how does the
[45:42] book of song of solomon end it ends the
[45:44] same way the bible ends
[45:47] hallelujah i'm just getting excited here
[45:49] so forgive me if i'm gonna this is
[45:51] beautiful
[45:55] how does it end in verse six he says set
[45:57] me as a seal
[45:58] upon thy soul so solomon's saying make
[46:01] me a seal i want to be the seal in your
[46:03] soul amen i want to be sealed into you
[46:06] praise god amen hallelujah
[46:09] and then look how he comes down
[46:15] we're going to verse 12.
[46:16] my vineyard which is mine is before me
[46:18] thou o solomon must have a thousand and
[46:20] those that keep the fruit thereof two
[46:22] hundred so he sees connecting solomon to
[46:25] this fruitfulness right that's what
[46:27] naphtali had very fruitful ground praise
[46:29] god
[46:30] verse 13 thou that dwelt in the gardens
[46:33] the companions hearken to thy voice
[46:34] there it is cause me to hear it praise
[46:37] god so god's voice is like this this
[46:39] deer
[46:40] verse 14 make haste my beloved and be
[46:43] thou like a robe or to a young heart
[46:46] upon the mountains of spices
[46:49] in other words jesus come quickly praise
[46:53] god
[46:54] come down and visit me come swiftly let
[46:57] your presence fall in the church amen
[46:59] let your presence fall in the car let
[47:02] your presence fall in my house let your
[47:04] presence just come quickly to me i need
[47:07] make haste come quickly i need you and
[47:09] come in your grace and your power
[47:12] amen
[47:14] so now we got the word of god now we
[47:16] have the scripture saying jesus christ
[47:18] is like a deer
[47:21] his voice is like a deer
[47:23] as it gracefully descends upon us amen
[47:29] why because he's amible that means
[47:30] lovely his loveliness in himself and for
[47:33] his lovingness to his people for his
[47:36] swiftness to do the will and work of his
[47:38] father being sent out as hear the word
[47:41] signifies by him into the world on the
[47:43] business of man's salvation amen
[47:47] hallelujah and so his disciples who were
[47:49] galileans were swift to obey his call
[47:51] and left all and followed him and were
[47:53] sent out by him to preach his gospel and
[47:56] both he and they may be said to give
[47:58] goodly words as the doctrines of the
[48:00] gospel are words of grace truth and life
[48:03] wholesome comfortable pleasant and
[48:06] delightful good tidings of good things
[48:08] of peace pardon righteousness salvation
[48:11] and eternal life by christ and the
[48:13] inhabitants of this country in christ's
[48:16] time we're swift to run after him that's
[48:18] true because the bible said multitudes
[48:21] follow jesus christ there amen
[48:24] multitudes they just swiftly followed
[48:26] after him because he was he was giving
[48:28] them the goodly words of eternal life
[48:30] amen it was darkness and it's as if
[48:33] somebody had turned on the light and
[48:34] mouthed highly praise god it was dark
[48:37] but christ brought light amen
[48:39] he brought the gospel he brought good
[48:41] news he brought salvation he brought
[48:43] forgiveness can i say it like this he
[48:45] brought the free gift
[48:47] amen
[48:48] praise god
[48:50] they panted after him
[48:54] as the deer pants for the water
[48:56] so my soul
[48:58] longs after
[49:00] thank god amen
[49:02] after the water brooks they both
[49:04] received and gave out the goodly words
[49:06] of the gospel and were made free thereby
[49:09] so i can hide let little say man
[49:12] i like a bird from prison bars has flown
[49:16] we're set free tonight amen
[49:18] hallelujah thank god
[49:21] just as a deer set free from his prison
[49:24] bars
[49:25] oh that's beautiful
[49:27] my goodness
[49:29] that's beautiful that's just history on
[49:31] the west and the south like i already
[49:32] shared with you i'm gonna for time say
[49:34] i'm gonna skip past it
[49:37] now look church one of these cities
[49:40] in naphtali was bethsaida
[49:44] because it was on the west side of the
[49:45] sea of galilee
[49:49] it was the home of peter
[49:52] andrew philip and frequently resorted by
[49:56] jesus this was the same city so this
[50:00] naphtali was the home of peter andrew
[50:03] philip and more
[50:06] right
[50:08] and this was where christ fed 5 000.
[50:11] this is where the blind man received his
[50:13] sight
[50:14] praise god
[50:17] i'm reading the rest of that there
[50:20] so this was a place of great
[50:22] manifestation this this is a place where
[50:25] things happen fast
[50:27] the the darkness it just instantly
[50:30] changed to light
[50:31] before it was spiritual death and now
[50:33] jesus there now there's light amen
[50:36] it happened quickly
[50:38] all this area of naphtali and zebulun
[50:42] now i don't have time to read all that
[50:44] that's a lot
[50:48] and i'm just going to skip that one too
[50:51] now let's look at the sea of galilee so
[50:53] now remember here let me zoom out here
[50:55] okay that's that's slide 28.
[50:58] but here let's look up here just briefly
[50:59] so now see here we have the sea of
[51:01] galilee right there's capernaum i think
[51:04] beth side is right in here also as well
[51:07] but this is where christ
[51:09] this was basically christ's home base
[51:11] or his headquarters
[51:13] right
[51:14] he spent as far as in scripture the
[51:16] majority of his time he spent here in
[51:19] capernaum and i've got numerous
[51:20] scriptures i could show you on that one
[51:22] where capernaum was like his home base
[51:25] he spent a lot of time there and that's
[51:27] where the disciples were from as well so
[51:28] i'm going to go back to that
[51:31] now what's so special about the sea of
[51:32] galilee
[51:34] this is where this is a freshwater lake
[51:37] and it was the main freshwater source
[51:39] for much of israel you can't drink salt
[51:40] water
[51:42] you got to get fresh water somewhere and
[51:44] what was jesus he was living water amen
[51:48] and this is where he lived
[51:51] most of the time he was here a lot of
[51:52] times
[51:53] fresh water
[51:55] and that's where christ was
[51:57] this is 70 miles 70 miles
[52:00] north of jerusalem
[52:04] and so jerusalem and the sea of galilee
[52:06] or land of naphtali
[52:09] that joins israel or jerusalem as the
[52:11] two main two main locations of jesus
[52:14] ministry
[52:16] now church i don't have the picture i
[52:17] really maybe i can look it up real quick
[52:18] yeah maybe i can look it up
[52:22] there is a there was a road
[52:24] called the via marius
[52:26] okay
[52:28] so in the times of jesus there was a
[52:30] road that went right by capernaum and
[52:32] the sea of galilee and it was the only
[52:34] road that connected you to africa
[52:37] europe and asia
[52:40] praise god
[52:42] and god placed jesus christ not by
[52:44] jerusalem most of his ministry place him
[52:47] in capernaum because capernaum is right
[52:50] by this can i say like it's like a
[52:52] highway it was like a highway in those
[52:53] days it was like an international
[52:55] highway brother william
[52:57] and so god did all these miracles and
[53:00] all these great works of jesus near
[53:02] capernaum and it's right where all the
[53:04] travel lines were
[53:06] for the whole world that way the word of
[53:09] god could be taken to all the
[53:11] generations and all the continents and
[53:14] all the peoples very quickly amen
[53:17] glory swiftly amen so the gospel even
[53:20] though he had only a three and a half
[53:22] year ministry his the news and the fame
[53:24] the bible said the fame of jesus spread
[53:27] through the whole region amen
[53:30] because god had to place him in a spot
[53:32] where his works would be so great it'd
[53:34] be right along the highway where
[53:35] everybody would talk and all the
[53:37] travelers would hear about it and so the
[53:39] name of jesus and the ministry of jesus
[53:41] would be much talked about he was placed
[53:43] positionally there in naphtali amen
[53:47] oh
[53:50] so he was placed right on the road to
[53:52] europe right on the road to asia right
[53:55] on the road to africa
[53:58] church look at this
[54:00] scholars say jesus spent 70 of his
[54:03] ministry
[54:05] on the northern shore of the sea of
[54:06] galilee
[54:08] 70 percent
[54:10] almost two-third i'm sorry almost
[54:12] three-fourths of his ministry he spat
[54:14] near the shores of the sea of galilee
[54:18] and all the world travelers had to pass
[54:20] through the via maras the roman road and
[54:23] they would have heard about jesus's
[54:25] mighty miracles
[54:29] so remember matthew 4 13 said jesus's
[54:32] ministry moved to capernaum after he got
[54:34] the holy ghost he went from nazareth to
[54:36] capernaum
[54:38] right
[54:40] six of his disciples were from the
[54:42] northern shore area peter andrew james
[54:45] john matthew and philip
[54:49] so his his apostles were waiting there
[54:52] naphtali waiting for the great deer to
[54:55] come praise god and bring the goodly
[54:57] words amen and then they would instantly
[55:00] forsake their nets they'd forsake their
[55:02] tax collecting and they'd follow christ
[55:04] the lamb amen or christ the deer i'll
[55:06] say it like that they'd follow them
[55:07] quickly
[55:11] now look at acts 1 11. i'm going to read
[55:13] that acts 111 just so you got it
[55:17] the bible says most of his apostles were
[55:19] from the galilee region so zebulun and
[55:22] naphtali acts 1 11
[55:26] which also said ye men of galilee why
[55:28] send you gazing up into heaven the same
[55:30] jesus which is taken up from you into
[55:31] heaven so shalt so come in like manner
[55:34] as you have seen him going to heaven if
[55:35] you know the story jesus just left for
[55:37] heaven and all that's left are his
[55:39] followers
[55:40] and so the angel says ye men of galilee
[55:43] you men of naphtali you men of zebulun
[55:46] why wait here go down to jerusalem
[55:48] travel 70 miles south and get the holy
[55:51] ghost amen
[55:53] oh my
[55:55] but church look at this
[55:58] up by the up by the sea of galilee jesus
[56:01] calmed this sea on multiple occasions
[56:05] he fed the four thousand he preached the
[56:08] sermon of the mount right next to the
[56:09] sea
[56:11] his most beautiful sermon people say
[56:13] which is i mean that's arguable they're
[56:15] all beautiful man
[56:16] the most beautiful one they say came
[56:18] right there on the sermon amount right
[56:20] near the sea of galilee jesus cast out
[56:22] devils in their synagogues
[56:25] he had the miraculous catch of fish
[56:27] there with peter

[1:00:26] naphtali
[1:00:28] his first miracle praise god his first
[1:00:31] sermon was in gubernium
[1:00:34] god sent a great light to bring these
[1:00:36] out of darkness
[1:00:38] because of his grace now church we don't
[1:00:39] have time but here's all the scriptures
[1:00:41] of all healings
[1:00:43] and in the bible in matthew and all
[1:00:45] these have taken place in galilee in
[1:00:46] capernaum
[1:00:48] many of them i just read them to you
[1:00:52] all just they were chosen his 12
[1:00:55] disciples were chosen there
[1:00:57] he called it and those are the ones that
[1:00:59] are going to sit on 12 thrones praise
[1:01:00] god
[1:01:02] all of these goodly words come and
[1:01:04] follow me praise god all these words
[1:01:06] were spoken there it was a special place
[1:01:09] it was a place of grace it's a place of
[1:01:11] goodly words it's the place of messiah
[1:01:14] it was a place where darkness had to
[1:01:16] flee because light had come amen
[1:01:19] oh my god
[1:01:21] and let's stand
[1:01:24] because jesus did this because god sent
[1:01:27] it look
[1:01:28] greater responsibility was on naphtali
[1:01:30] than all the other places
[1:01:33] now he put a great one on jerusalem too
[1:01:34] he said whoa whoa whoa into jerusalem
[1:01:36] right
[1:01:37] how long i'd like to hover over you but
[1:01:39] you would not
[1:01:41] he said very similar things to bethsaida
[1:01:44] charizard and capernaum
[1:01:47] he said woe unto you because you've seen
[1:01:49] such great miracles right but he said
[1:01:52] you'll be brought down to hell because
[1:01:53] you didn't repent adam think about that
[1:01:55] the dead rays the blind sauce all these
[1:01:58] miracles and the most people refused to
[1:02:00] receive the goodly words but thank god
[1:02:02] there was some elect that received it
[1:02:04] amen that's you and i praise god
[1:02:08] now look at this now look church jesus
[1:02:09] said blessed are those who believe yet
[1:02:11] haven't seen maybe like in my life i
[1:02:13] haven't seen the blind eyes open the
[1:02:15] natural blind eyes
[1:02:17] i haven't seen the dead raised
[1:02:19] but maybe that's not god that's
[1:02:20] obviously not god's portion for my life
[1:02:23] at least not yet
[1:02:25] but this group had it
[1:02:27] the naphtali cities there they had all
[1:02:29] this chance to receive it but most of
[1:02:31] them would turn it down
[1:02:33] but jesus says don't worry about what
[1:02:35] you see he said worry about what you
[1:02:36] hear be concerned about what you hear
[1:02:39] live the gospel praise god
[1:02:41] not everybody gets to see the same
[1:02:42] miracles but the more miracles you see
[1:02:44] the more responsibility you have
[1:02:48] his remember he said to be more
[1:02:49] tolerable for you on the day on sodom
[1:02:51] and gomorrah than for you on the day of
[1:02:52] judgment
[1:02:54] that's what he told torizon
[1:02:55] messiah all these naftali cities the
[1:02:58] more you see supernaturally the more
[1:03:00] you're responsible for so my desire is
[1:03:03] lord let me see what you want me to see
[1:03:05] that's fine but let me believe and live
[1:03:07] the gospel of jesus christ
[1:03:10] even if i don't see it i still believe
[1:03:12] it praise god
[1:03:14] amen he said blessed are those who have
[1:03:18] not seen
[1:03:19] yet have believed
[1:03:22] and so what do we see we see our beloved
[1:03:24] gazelle
[1:03:25] our heart
[1:03:26] our stag our deer
[1:03:28] returning for his mate
[1:03:31] hallelujah let's thank the lord can we
[1:03:32] thank the lord for that praise god
[1:03:34] now god can come
[1:03:36] this is what we see in naphtali's life
[1:03:40] we see a promise of natural blessing
[1:03:42] we see how they helped out deborah and
[1:03:45] barrack
[1:03:46] but we see the prophetic aspect to the
[1:03:48] messiah the messiah comes swiftly
[1:03:52] he speaks goodly things
[1:03:53] he's graceful he's beautiful he's humble
[1:03:57] i said like he's humble like a deer
[1:03:59] praise god he looks at you through the
[1:04:01] lattice
[1:04:02] he's real humble
[1:04:04] his voice is so sweet and calm
[1:04:06] his power is evident but we have a
[1:04:08] responsibility to receive those goodly
[1:04:10] words
[1:04:11] and we must not forsake that opportunity
[1:04:13] that we have aren't you glad you had a
[1:04:15] chance
[1:04:16] to receive god's dear praise god
[1:04:20] it's prophesied but it was given to us
[1:04:22] praise god church we were in darkness
[1:04:24] how many were in darkness but god sent
[1:04:26] you a great light
[1:04:28] amen just like naphtali let's bow our
[1:04:30] heads here
[1:04:31] you can stop the livestream god bless
[1:04:32] our live streamers there
[1:04:35] see i thought i could take one whole
[1:04:37] service on naphtali there
