[0:00] that happened right after World War II.
[0:03] And all the historians recognize that he
[0:05] was a true prophet of God. Um, and so
[0:08] I'm taking a thought from a sermon he
[0:10] preached and I'm going to preach the
[0:11] Bible uh from that text here by God's
[0:14] grace. I'd like to preach on the
[0:15] masterpiece today. I've been listening
[0:16] to this off and on the last few weeks,
[0:18] you know, as I mow and as I travel and
[0:20] even studying, of course, but I trust it
[0:22] to be a blessing to you uh by the grace
[0:24] of God today. Isaiah 53. We'll do verses
[0:28] uh we'll read verses 1-5.
[0:33] Just, you know, brother Gary, I usually
[0:34] preach about an hour and a half. So, if
[0:36] people need to get up and get water and
[0:38] things like that, then they're of course
[0:39] more than welcome to do that. Uh that's
[0:42] just kind of like my average time.
[0:43] Sometimes less, sometimes more by God's
[0:46] grace. But I'll try to try to watch the
[0:49] time, especially with the mothers and
[0:50] the children, you know. Uh I try to
[0:53] watch the time here. Isaiah 53. What a
[0:56] beautiful chapter. I've often said this.
[0:57] If if I happen to die before Jesus
[0:59] returns, I want this chapter read at my
[1:01] funeral. Praise God. Because it's only
[1:04] through the life, death, and
[1:05] resurrection of Jesus Christ that I can
[1:08] even be saved. Hallelujah. It's only
[1:10] through the hope of Jesus Christ that my
[1:13] heart could be changed and I could love
[1:15] Jesus Christ, serve Jesus Christ, and
[1:18] desire to have eternal life with our
[1:20] Lord and Savior. Praise God.
[1:23] Uh we'll read verses or I'll read verses
[1:25] 1-4 and then we can all read verse 5
[1:27] together. Who hath believed our report
[1:30] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:32] revealed. So see Christ must be revealed
[1:34] to us by the spirit. For he shall grow
[1:37] up before him as a tender plant and as a
[1:39] root out of a dry ground. He hath no
[1:41] form nor calmliness. That means
[1:43] splendor. So when Jesus was born and we
[1:45] saw these pictures, but when he grew up
[1:47] there was no splendor. Like wow, he's
[1:49] just so different from other children.
[1:52] There was no splendor. And when we shall
[1:55] see him, there is no beauty that we
[1:56] should desire him. This was prophesied
[1:59] 700 years before Christ. He wasn't a
[2:01] beautiful man. He wasn't a handsome man.
[2:03] Wasn't a great man. But he was God's
[2:06] man. Hallelujah. Verse three. He has
[2:09] despised and rejected a man, a man of
[2:12] sorrows and acquainted with grief. And
[2:14] we hid as it were our faces from him. He
[2:17] was despised and we esteemed him not.
[2:21] Surely he hath borne our griefs.
[2:23] Hallelujah. And carried our sorrows.
[2:25] That word means our mental sorrows. So
[2:28] any mind battle, any depression, any we
[2:30] call people call it mental health today.
[2:32] Jesus has already carried that away. If
[2:34] people are willing to receive it, praise
[2:36] God. But you have to be willing to
[2:38] receive it. He's already carried those
[2:41] sorrows away. Yet we did esteem him
[2:44] stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
[2:47] Let's read verse 5. 1 2 3. But he was
[2:50] wounded for our transgressions. He was
[2:53] bruised for our iniquities. The
[2:56] chastisement of our peace was upon him,
[2:59] and with his stripes we are healed.
[3:02] Let's have one more word of prayer.
[3:04] Father God, this text brings me to
[3:05] tears, Lord, almost every time I read
[3:07] it. I'm the one that turned away. I'm
[3:09] the one that ran from you for 19 years,
[3:11] Lord God. I was the guilty one. I was I
[3:14] hid my face from you, Jesus. And I was
[3:17] worthy of judgment and punishment, Lord.
[3:19] But according to these verses, you took
[3:22] my punishment. You took my shame, Lord.
[3:25] You and then you carried all my
[3:26] infirmities away. All my sins,
[3:28] hallelujah. All my iniquities, you
[3:30] carried them away. You separated me from
[3:32] my sins. You've done that for all of us.
[3:35] And we give you glory and honor and
[3:37] praise for that this morning. Thank you
[3:38] God that with your stripes with each and
[3:40] every stripe Lord Jesus that you endured
[3:43] you were healing us till now we are
[3:46] completely healed Lord God thank you for
[3:48] the power of the cross it's still alive
[3:50] and well today because the spirit of God
[3:52] is here Lord Jesus let the Holy Spirit
[3:54] anoint this word Lord as I preach it I'm
[3:57] no preacher I can do nothing Lord God
[3:58] there's only one preacher and Lord that
[4:01] is you oh God almighty so Lord God
[4:03] anoint this service today may we hear a
[4:05] masterpiece from the only one who can
[4:06] give a masterpiece the Lord Jesus
[4:09] Christ. We ask all these things in Jesus
[4:11] Christ's name. And the church said,
[4:13] "Amen." God bless you as you're being
[4:14] seated. Praise God.
[4:30] So, I'd like to look at this thought
[4:32] here on the masterpiece. I'd like to
[4:33] start with just a definition of what a
[4:35] masterpiece is and our understanding of
[4:37] it. Of course, the word masterpiece
[4:39] isn't in the Bible. Uh 1964, as I said,
[4:42] brother Ram picked up this thought and
[4:43] I'm going to show you where he got this
[4:45] thought from. It was a beautiful
[4:46] thought.
[4:48] Uh but we would call a masterpiece is a
[4:50] work done with extraordinary skill. Uh
[4:53] so like I'd say Malachi and Lydia on on
[4:56] the instruments, that's that's a
[4:57] masterpiece because if I got on there,
[4:59] it would be no masterpiece. Praise God.
[5:02] there there'd be no extraordinary skill.
[5:03] There'd be a lack of skill. But when
[5:05] someone is extraordinary skillful at
[5:07] something and they produce a work, it's
[5:10] called a masterpiece. Praise God. It's
[5:12] also a it's especially a supreme
[5:15] intellectual or artistic achievement.
[5:17] That's what we're going to see today in
[5:18] the case of Michelangelo. Uh by God's
[5:20] grace, it's a a rank I'm sorry, it's a
[5:23] piece of work presented to a medieval
[5:25] guild as evidence of qualification for
[5:27] the rank of master. So in the old days,
[5:29] you could become a master. uh and if if
[5:32] you pass certain uh uh qualifications,
[5:34] you would be termed a master. They even
[5:36] have that today in education. I'm a
[5:38] school teacher. You can become a master
[5:39] teacher in Ohio. Now, I'm not there. I'm
[5:41] not going to go through all those hoops.
[5:43] Uh I just want to be the best God called
[5:45] me to be. But, uh we have something
[5:47] similar today where you have they have
[5:48] al also have master technicians when we
[5:50] go to take our cars in, right? Yeah. You
[5:52] can earn the status of being a master.
[5:54] That means you have extraordinary skill.
[5:57] And I believe Christians should strive
[5:58] to do their very best for the kingdom of
[6:00] God. Hallelujah. Right. The Bible says,
[6:02] "Whatever you do, do it with all your
[6:04] heart in the book of Ecclesiastes."
[6:05] Praise God. And then Paul says in
[6:07] Colossians, "Whatever you do for the
[6:09] work for the Lord, do it with all your
[6:10] might." Praise God. How many want to do
[6:12] that today? Praise God. Certainly want
[6:14] to do that by God's grace. And uh so as
[6:16] I've been listening, you know, these
[6:17] last few weeks, this sermon, uh brother
[6:18] Random got his inspiration uh from
[6:21] Michelangelo's
[6:23] masterpiece
[6:24] uh that he sculpted there by uh
[6:27] direction of the pope. So I just I'll
[6:29] briefly just share this is this sermon.
[6:31] Brother was uh traveling in Rome and he
[6:33] saw this masterpiece and and he was
[6:36] inspired by this masterpiece. How many
[6:38] heard of of this piece Moses by
[6:40] Michelangelo? Everybody heard Anybody
[6:41] heard of it? Okay, a few people. Maybe
[6:43] not the young people. Who knows what
[6:45] they teach him anymore in these schools,
[6:46] you know, right? Uh but I don't think I
[6:48] learned it in school either. But uh I
[6:51] think I learned it in ma art class
[6:53] actually. Art class. Yeah, if I'm not
[6:54] mistaken. But he finished this
[6:56] masterpiece called Moses around 1513,
[7:00] give or take a few years. Uh Pope Julius
[7:02] II commissioned him to build this for
[7:05] his tomb, for his death. And of course,
[7:07] he died before it was finished. Um and
[7:10] what's interesting, you know, right off,
[7:11] you notice the horns there. And and and
[7:13] there's two thoughts on this. You know,
[7:15] u some people think Michelangelo just
[7:17] used those horns as that was the glory
[7:19] of God that was coming uh off of him
[7:22] because when he come down from the
[7:23] mountain, he's got the two tables of
[7:24] stone. The Bible said he shone with the
[7:27] glory of God for being in the presence
[7:29] of God for so long. Other people think
[7:32] there was a misinterpretation in the
[7:34] Latin Vulgate, which was an earlier
[7:36] translation uh of the scripture and and
[7:38] the the translation said horns rather
[7:40] than the glory of God. So, it doesn't
[7:43] really matter to us cuz we know he
[7:44] didn't have horns, right? We know people
[7:46] today aren't born with horns. Uh, and so
[7:49] whatever it was, uh, he was inspired to
[7:52] do it. How many believe he was a he, how
[7:54] many, how many know he was a master?
[7:55] Praise God. A master sculptor, we'd say,
[7:59] undoubtedly, uh, without question, a
[8:02] master sculptor. Uh, and just look at
[8:05] the amazing details. You know, I look at
[8:07] my I was looking at my hand this
[8:08] morning. I'm like, my my hand is a lot
[8:09] like that. same uh same muscles and
[8:12] ligaments and
[8:14] you know uh just how many years or
[8:16] decades did this man put into this uh
[8:19] and this is out of marble. This isn't
[8:22] out of play-doh where you can easily fix
[8:25] something in the right shape. This took
[8:27] dedication, years, devotion, attention
[8:31] to every detail. Right? That's why a
[8:34] mechanic could be a called a technician
[8:36] or a master technician if he's watching
[8:38] every detail to make sure the vehicle's
[8:40] in the proper condition or a master
[8:43] teacher that he or she could assess
[8:45] where the children are, what they need,
[8:46] what's the next thing they need in order
[8:48] to to get to the next level of learning
[8:51] and then get ready to to take them even
[8:53] higher, right? And do that with a class
[8:55] of 17 or 22 students. That's what a
[8:59] master teacher would do. Praise God.
[9:01] Hallelujah. We see amazing detail
[9:04] craftsmanship and this is church the
[9:06] work of a man.
[9:09] This isn't the work of God. This is the
[9:10] work of a man. So it just shows what
[9:13] could a human uh accomplish if they're
[9:16] yielded to God almighty. Hallelujah.
[9:19] Amen.
[9:21] Now this reference says this and this is
[9:23] the story where brother Random heard
[9:24] about this story back in the 60s.
[9:27] This statue uh has a famous antidote
[9:30] about Michelangelo and when he finished
[9:33] it, imagine him stepping away, you know,
[9:34] he takes his chisel, lays down his
[9:36] chisel, he's all sweating, he steps
[9:38] away. There's a story that that's
[9:39] written about him, an anecdote about
[9:41] Michelangelo. I don't think he said it
[9:42] himself, but somebody wrote this about
[9:44] him. He saw the perfection of of what he
[9:47] had produced.
[9:49] And he takes his hammer, he gets his
[9:51] hammer back in his hand, and he strikes
[9:53] the knee and says, "Why don't you
[9:55] speak?" because he saw the image in his
[9:58] mind come to reality and it so moved him
[10:02] to see this masterpiece
[10:05] in a reality in front of him that he
[10:07] believed it should talk. Amen.
[10:10] Hallelujah. Praise God. And this
[10:12] inspired brother Brandham to preach the
[10:14] sermon masterpiece. Hallelujah. How many
[10:17] know where we're going by God's grace?
[10:18] Oh, there's one great masterpiece.
[10:20] Hallelujah. Amen. That God gave. Amen.
[10:23] Now, we say we're minor masterpieces,
[10:25] right? I mean, we're no doubt amazing as
[10:27] it is. The Bible said, "Each one of you
[10:29] are fearfully and wonderfully made."
[10:31] Don't let the devil tell you you're not
[10:32] good enough or smart enough or handsome
[10:34] enough or pretty enough. You are made
[10:36] exactly how God wanted to make you.
[10:38] Praise God. You're fearfully and
[10:41] wonderfully made. Don't let the devil
[10:42] tell you lies and get you discouraged.
[10:45] You take courage in what God said about
[10:46] you. Hallelujah. Take God's word over
[10:49] the devil's word. The devil's a liar.
[10:50] Hallelujah. But God is the truth.
[10:53] Hallelujah. Amen. And so Moses was I'm
[10:56] sorry. Michelangelo was so inspired he
[10:58] said, "Why don't you speak?" And if I'm
[11:01] not mistaken, I could be wrong, but that
[11:02] arrow there, that's the that's the part
[11:05] that he struck with the uh the hammer
[11:07] there. He was so inspired to see his
[11:10] vision become a reality, he wanted to
[11:13] speak. Hallelujah. Amen.
[11:17] So, it's a it's a beautiful story.
[11:19] Brother Ram heard this in the 1960s and
[11:21] uh he caught inspiration. And here's a
[11:23] little bit of the quote. And now, just
[11:25] so Brother Gary knows, we we uh we
[11:27] follow Brother Brandham like the
[11:28] Lutheran follow Martin Luther, right?
[11:32] Like the Methodists follow John Wesley.
[11:34] And church, I heard in his in his
[11:36] notebook, John Wesley, they would go
[11:38] from house to house and they would spend
[11:41] time, the preachers would spend time in
[11:42] your house and if your house wasn't
[11:44] clean enough, they'd kick you out of the
[11:45] church. I'm talking naturally and
[11:48] spiritually if they saw any trash.
[11:52] That's how serious he was about serving
[11:53] God. How many know we can be more
[11:55] serious about serving God? Do not let
[11:58] sin in your home. Praise God. It will
[12:00] have it will start growing. The Bible
[12:02] says it's like leaven in dough. It'll
[12:04] have a puffing effect, a prideful
[12:06] effect. The the longer you allow sin in
[12:08] your life, the more it it exalts itself
[12:10] again against God. But that's why God
[12:12] told the Jews, "Get the leaven out of
[12:14] your house." And Paul picks it up and
[12:16] says, "Christ is our Passover." And what
[12:19] does what does Paul say? There's two
[12:20] things that keep sin out of our lives.
[12:22] Sincerity and truth. I sent that to
[12:25] brother Chris this week. Right, brother
[12:26] Chris? You got asked about that. Great
[12:28] question, brother. If we are sincere,
[12:30] we'll keep the sin out of our homes. If
[12:32] we're truthful, we'll keep the sin out
[12:34] of our lives. We all We're all going to
[12:36] sin every day, but every day, let's be
[12:38] sincere. Let's confess it. Let's tell
[12:40] the truth. Let's confess our sins. Get
[12:42] it out of our lives. And let's have a
[12:44] home that magnifies Jesus Christ.
[12:46] Hallelujah. Let's not have a home that
[12:48] allows sin to grow and develop and
[12:50] become more like the world. We're we're
[12:52] not of the world. We are of heaven.
[12:54] Hallelujah. Amen. We're in the world but
[12:56] not of the world. Hallelujah. And so
[12:58] what brother Ram said, you know, after
[13:00] Matt Michelangelo had spent all that
[13:01] time for years and years to make this,
[13:04] he said under the influence of seeing
[13:07] fulfilled what he had seen in his heart
[13:08] and his vision and desired to see it was
[13:11] completed. And it was completed. So he
[13:13] was inspired by it till he thought his
[13:16] own masterpiece should speak back to
[13:19] him.
[13:20] And he struck it across a leg, hollered,
[13:23] "Speak." And it made a flaw on it. It
[13:26] put a flaw on the image. Right? So if
[13:29] you look back at the image, it looked
[13:30] like, "Why is that? Why is that there?
[13:31] It doesn't look like it should be
[13:32] there." Well, there's a purpose behind
[13:34] that because the creator said speak. He
[13:38] wanted it to speak. He was inspired by
[13:41] what uh had become to a reality. The
[13:44] vision had become reality.
[13:47] And brother Bam said to me, so this is
[13:49] brother Bam's opinion. To me, the flaw
[13:53] was what it made it a masterpiece.
[13:56] Now, most of us wouldn't think that,
[13:57] right? I mean, look at the hair. Look at
[14:00] the tables of stone. And look at the
[14:01] face of Moses. And just look at the
[14:04] beard and the muscles, the arms, as I
[14:06] said, the ligaments,
[14:08] you know, the flaw there in the leg.
[14:10] That doesn't seem like it would be the
[14:11] masterpiece. But to brother Brandham, he
[14:13] said that was what made it the
[14:15] masterpiece.
[14:17] He said, "Maybe your mind might think
[14:18] different. You think that spoiled it,
[14:20] but to me, that made it what it was."
[14:24] Because after so many years of careful
[14:26] work and toils and inspiration and so
[14:28] forth of making it, his toil had proved
[14:31] not in vain. It was perfect. And that's
[14:34] why he cried out, "Speak."
[14:38] He had seen before him that he had been
[14:41] able to achieve and bring to pass the
[14:43] vision that was in his mind. And
[14:45] therefore, under inspiration, he done
[14:47] something out of the reason, out of the
[14:48] ordinary. He struck it and hollered,
[14:50] "Speak."
[14:51] See, he wouldn't have done it if he had
[14:53] thought. But he didn't think. It was
[14:56] inspiration of seeing what he had in his
[14:58] mind sitting there perfectly before him.
[15:03] So, we all know where this is going.
[15:06] Jesus Christ is God's masterpiece.
[15:11] The Bible said, "For God so loved the
[15:13] world that he gave his only begotten
[15:17] son." The key word there is only. We all
[15:21] were begott of God, right? Begott means
[15:23] to come from. We all came from God. The
[15:26] Bible said we were chosen in Christ
[15:28] before the foundation of the world in
[15:30] Ephesians 1:4.
[15:32] But if Jesus was only begotten, then
[15:35] this is a different kind of begotten.
[15:38] This means there's no one that came
[15:41] forth like him. So no one can be greater
[15:44] than him and no one can do greater than
[15:47] him. I don't care. I don't care what the
[15:49] false teachers say or I don't care what
[15:51] the lying preachers say. No one can do
[15:53] greater works than Jesus Christ. They
[15:56] misunderstood John 14:12 where he said,
[15:59] "Greater works than these shall you do."
[16:01] You've misunderstood the translation
[16:03] from the King James version. Greater
[16:05] means more works. In other words, the
[16:08] church for 2,000 years would do more
[16:10] miracles than just the body of Jesus.
[16:12] And think of that even the body of Jesus
[16:14] did so many that John said it would be
[16:16] impossible to contain all the books that
[16:19] could be written about his works. So
[16:21] what about the Holy Ghost in believers
[16:23] for the last 2,000 years? Of course, the
[16:26] church did greater number of works, but
[16:29] nobody could do greater than Jesus
[16:31] Christ.
[16:34] We've never seen anybody walk on water.
[16:35] We've never seen anybody raise someone
[16:37] from the dead after three days. Jesus
[16:39] Christ is the greatest. Hallelujah. He
[16:42] is God's masterpiece. Hallelujah. He's
[16:45] the single of its kind, the only of its
[16:48] kind.
[16:50] Hallelujah. Is Jesus Christ our Lord.
[16:54] The Bible says how he was made. He
[16:57] wasn't made like we were. We looked at
[16:58] it a few weeks ago. Psalm 51. The David
[17:02] said, "In sin did my mother conceive
[17:04] me." In other words, of course, his
[17:06] parents uh David's parents were married.
[17:09] Uh and so it wasn't sin for his his
[17:12] parents to have conception but it
[17:14] David's saying I was conceived in sin.
[17:17] The sin nature passed from my parents
[17:19] into me.
[17:21] And that's the battle that we all face
[17:23] today. Our greatest enemy is who?
[17:25] Ourselves. My greatest enemy is Jesse
[17:28] Smith. Brother Brandham said my greatest
[17:30] enemy is William Brandom. You are your
[17:32] greatest enemy because it's the sin
[17:34] nature inside of you. We've all got a
[17:37] battle to overcome. But the Bible said,
[17:39] "Take hope because greater is he that's
[17:41] in you than he that's in the world."
[17:44] Hallelujah. But Jesus Christ was the
[17:48] word made flesh.
[17:52] The word was made flesh and dwelt among
[17:54] us. And we beheld his glory. The glory
[17:57] as the only begotten of the father. As I
[18:00] said, he was created in a different way.
[18:03] Jesus was conceived uh we'd say egg and
[18:06] germ or egg and sperm both by God
[18:09] without any human uh impartation or any
[18:13] human effort. God created the fertilized
[18:16] egg of Jesus's body. Hallelujah. God
[18:18] created that and in that body was not a
[18:21] sin nature. It was a word nature. There
[18:24] is no Bible verse that said Jesus had a
[18:26] sin nature. It said his body was under
[18:29] the curse of death.
[18:31] So his body was would eventually have
[18:33] died if he not been crucified. But he
[18:35] had to be crucified. That was the cup
[18:37] the father had for him. And he prayed,
[18:39] "Father, let this cup pass.
[18:41] Nevertheless," those beautiful words,
[18:42] "let not my will be done, but let thy
[18:45] will be done." But Jesus had no sin
[18:48] nature. He had a word nature, but his
[18:50] body was under the curse of death.
[18:54] Hallelujah. Adam and Eve proved. Now,
[18:56] Adam and Eve was the closest. Adam was
[18:58] the closest. He was created perfect.
[19:00] None of us were created that perfect.
[19:02] Adam was the closest. He was created
[19:05] sinless, but then chose to sin because
[19:07] he didn't want to be uh away from Eve,
[19:10] his wife. Eve was deceived in the sin.
[19:13] But Adam wasn't deceived. Adam knew what
[19:15] he was doing. He was taking on her sin
[19:18] in order because he knew God would
[19:20] redeem Eve. Hallelujah. Amen. How could
[19:23] Adam just uh let his wife just die uh
[19:26] and and he would remain sinless? She was
[19:29] a part of him. Amen. And that's what
[19:31] Christ did. Christ took on our sin on
[19:33] the cross. Because he was our husband.
[19:36] Hallelujah. He was our savior and we're
[19:38] a part of him. Hallelujah.
[19:41] Chosen in the mind of God. Ephesians 1
[19:43] vers4. Before the foundation of the
[19:45] world. This is why the angel sang.
[19:47] Praise God. Hallelujah. This is why the
[19:49] earth shook when he had died. It wasn't
[19:51] just Adam. It wasn't kind of a a mixture
[19:54] of a human and a h a sinful human. It
[19:57] was a God man. Hallelujah. It was God in
[20:01] flesh. It was Emmanuel. None like him
[20:04] before, none like him afterwards. He's
[20:06] the only man worthy to be praised.
[20:09] That's why we praise him today.
[20:10] Hallelujah.
[20:14] I love this verse. I think we did a
[20:15] Bible study last week, Brother Chris,
[20:17] and we mentioned this verse. Speaking of
[20:19] Jesus, it said who being the brightness
[20:22] of his glory and the express image of
[20:25] his person. Notice Jesus is the image of
[20:28] God's person. The Bible never calls God
[20:31] three persons. We know that we're taught
[20:33] the word of God. Well, that was invented
[20:35] about uh I think the earliest time the
[20:38] word trinity was was uh coined was 180
[20:41] AD. That word came into creation 80
[20:44] years after the last apostle died. The
[20:47] word trinity is not even in the Bible.
[20:50] Right? So we know the trinity is an
[20:52] addition to the Bible. We never want to
[20:54] add to the Bible. We never want to take
[20:56] away from the Bible. Hallelujah. But
[20:59] Jesus is the express image of God's
[21:01] person. God's one person. And he upholds
[21:04] all things by the word of his power when
[21:07] he by himself purged our sins.
[21:10] Hallelujah. Sat down on the right hand
[21:12] of the majesty on high. Now that word in
[21:14] the Greek express image is the word
[21:16] where we get character from. Someone has
[21:19] good character. That that means the good
[21:21] part about them, right? But the
[21:22] difference with us, we have some bad
[21:24] parts about our character. We still got
[21:26] some things we're trying to overcome.
[21:27] And the church said, hallelujah. When
[21:30] you're done overcoming, it's when you
[21:32] pass from this life and you go into the
[21:33] next body. Hallelujah. That's when
[21:35] you'll be done overcoming. But until
[21:37] then, we've got to overcome and strive
[21:40] as the Bible said, "Give all diligence
[21:42] to have the character of Christ."
[21:45] So this word express image in the Greek
[21:48] is carere and it's got two definitions.
[21:52] An instrument for engraving or carving.
[21:54] So it's as if God carved his nature into
[21:57] the body of Jesus.
[22:00] Children in school, have you done any
[22:01] wood carvings yet? Okay, you will. I did
[22:04] them in school. You'll get out a nice
[22:06] piece of wood and they'll give you like
[22:08] some carving instruments and you'll dig
[22:10] that that that that uh that knife. It's
[22:12] like kind of like a knife. You'll dig
[22:14] that knife into the wood. What's another
[22:16] name for? How do you know the names of
[22:17] the wood carving instruments? So, my
[22:20] general term is a knife. They have all
[22:21] these different knives and to create
[22:23] different kind of shapes. And that's
[22:24] what God did. God took the body of Jesus
[22:27] and he spiritually carved his nature
[22:30] into Christ.
[22:32] Not the sin nature, but the divine
[22:34] nature. Hallelujah. I like this last
[22:37] one. It's like a stamp. Now, you got
[22:39] children got stamps out. You ever use a
[22:41] stamp? Right. You put the stamp on you
[22:44] if you put the stamper on the stamp pad,
[22:45] get all that ink on there, and what does
[22:48] it produce? It produced the same image
[22:50] that's on the stamper.
[22:52] And that's what the that's what Jesus
[22:54] was. Jesus was the exact image of God in
[22:58] a human being. I like this lack. I like
[23:02] this last one. Fax simile. Tammy worked
[23:03] in an office. I I used to work. We send
[23:06] faxes all the time. Right now we don't
[23:08] have to so much. Now we can email a lot.
[23:10] But in the old days, we had fax
[23:12] machines. Well, that's what God did. He
[23:13] put his character Amen. in the fax
[23:16] machine. Hallelujah. And he sent the
[23:17] same character down into his son.
[23:19] Hallelujah. Not a different character,
[23:22] but the same character. So if we want to
[23:25] know how would God act in on earth, we
[23:27] just got to look at Jesus. That's true.
[23:30] Hallelujah.
[23:32] Amen. And that nature was in Jesus's
[23:36] body. He didn't have a sin nature. So
[23:38] when he was tempted, did he fall into
[23:39] sin? No. He overcame. What did Jesus do
[23:42] when he was tempted? He quoted the word.
[23:44] Quoted the word. Thank God he did it.
[23:46] Praise God. Hallelujah. He defeated
[23:48] Satan every place, every time, any day.
[23:51] Jesus defeated him every time so that we
[23:53] can defeat Satan. Amen. Brother Ram
[23:56] said, "The weakest Christian can defeat
[23:58] Satan any day of the week, any time, any
[24:01] place, anywhere, by simply doing what
[24:03] Jesus said, quote the word of God. It is
[24:06] written, Satan."
[24:08] And you and I can defeat Satan on any
[24:11] grounds, even around the bar. Right,
[24:12] Brother Gary? You can defeat Satan by
[24:15] standing outside the bar. Praise God.
[24:17] You can defeat him in your car if he's
[24:18] trying to tempt you there, on the job,
[24:20] in the school, wherever you are. You can
[24:22] defeat Satan any place, anytime,
[24:25] anywhere, because God's given you the
[24:27] word nature in your soul. Praise God.
[24:30] Hallelujah. But you're different. You
[24:31] still remain the sin nature when you get
[24:33] saved or filled with the Holy Ghost.
[24:36] Hallelujah.
[24:38] But look at that. God precisely put all
[24:40] of his character in Jesus Christ.
[24:44] So Jesus was tender. Jesus was kind.
[24:47] Jesus was forgiving. But sometimes he
[24:49] was stern, too. That's the part most
[24:51] churches don't like. But the churches
[24:52] should be aware of that. Hallelujah.
[24:54] Jesus flipping tables over and saying,
[24:57] "This is not how church should be. Our
[24:59] house should be a house of prayer."
[25:01] Hallelujah. It's not a house of
[25:03] merchandise to get rich and and and and
[25:06] uh deceive people uh and try to take
[25:08] money from people. That's not why God's
[25:10] house was made. God's house is to be a
[25:12] house of prayer, mercy, and judgment,
[25:15] and truth, and integrity, and character.
[25:17] For the people of God to contact God,
[25:20] and for God to put his spirit into their
[25:22] souls. Hallelujah.
[25:24] Amen. In other words, for God to engrave
[25:26] his nature in your life.
[25:29] How many want God to do that today?
[25:32] God's not done with you and I. God's not
[25:34] done. He still wants to engrave his
[25:36] character into your heart today. What
[25:38] does it take? It takes humility. It
[25:40] takes repentance and it takes obedience.
[25:43] Hallelujah. And God can carve his
[25:46] nature. Well, I don't pray enough. I
[25:47] don't read my Bible enough or I get
[25:49] angry too much. Repent and let God carve
[25:52] some patience into your life, some
[25:54] dedication into your life, some
[25:56] diligence into your life, some devotion
[25:58] into your life. Hallelujah. Let God
[26:00] carve that into you because with God all
[26:03] things will be possible.
[26:05] Amen.
[26:07] Hallelujah. Trying to control myself
[26:09] here by God's grace. Sometimes I'm just
[26:12] like clap too loud and spitting all over
[26:13] the place. I'm trying to control myself
[26:14] today. Hallelujah.
[26:17] Gets loud in here. Now, we're not going
[26:19] to read through this, but brother Random
[26:20] read this entire chapter to start the
[26:23] sermon. It was a 2 hour and 17 minute
[26:25] sermon. So, I'm not going to keep you
[26:26] that long today. But put yourself in
[26:28] those days. Would you have went and
[26:29] listened to Brother Brandham preach for
[26:30] two hours and 17 minutes? Or would you
[26:32] have said, "Nah, it's time for lunch."
[26:36] See, church, we got to make sure we're
[26:37] sincere. Hallelujah. Got to make sure
[26:39] we're sincere.
[26:42] But let's look at God's masterpiece just
[26:44] for a moment. In verse two, he had no
[26:47] splendor. So when we, you know, all the
[26:48] pictures when Jesus is born, they got
[26:50] this glow about him. The Bible said he
[26:52] had no splendor. So who are you going to
[26:54] believe? Artist or the Bible? We're
[26:55] going to believe the Bible.
[26:57] He had no beauty. That's why this this
[27:00] is not Jesus, but it's just the artist's
[27:02] rendition of him. But I love it because
[27:04] uh it's it's Hinrich Hoffman's painting
[27:06] from the late 1800s. We love this
[27:09] picture. We know it's not Jesus, but it
[27:11] reminds us of Jesus. In the full
[27:13] picture, though, he's looking away from
[27:14] the rich young ruler. He's trying to
[27:16] talk to the rich young ruler about
[27:17] forsaking everything. And the rich young
[27:18] ruler is all handsome. He's all clean
[27:20] shaven. He's got beautiful clothes on.
[27:22] He's young and he just looks beautiful.
[27:25] And Jesus looks all, we'd say, scruffy.
[27:28] He looks tired, worn out. Look at the
[27:31] bags under his eyes. And so this is the
[27:34] closest image that that we found. And
[27:37] brother Ram said when he had two visions
[27:38] of Jesus, he looked very similar to
[27:40] this. Hallelujah.
[27:43] And so we we want to remember that that
[27:45] that artists paint Jesus a certain way,
[27:48] but God painted his masterpiece
[27:50] differently.
[27:53] And if Jesus was here today, he wouldn't
[27:54] be the most handsome preacher behind the
[27:56] pulpit.
[27:59] He would he would not be anything like
[28:01] that. I tried to do my hair today and
[28:03] dress up nice and make sure I shaved a
[28:05] little bit, but Jesus had no beauty that
[28:08] we would desire him. All of you sisters
[28:09] got out your nicest dress or one of your
[28:11] nicest dresses. Brothers got out,
[28:12] Malachi looks pretty nice today.
[28:15] But Jesus had no beauty that we would
[28:17] desire him. That was God's thinking.
[28:18] That was God's masterpiece. And I'm not
[28:21] saying you should come to church looking
[28:22] scruffy. I'm not saying that. Take care
[28:24] of yourself.
[28:26] But I just want you to see how God
[28:29] formed his masterpiece different than
[28:31] what we thought. He was despised and
[28:33] rejected by everyone.
[28:36] Now that must include the women. Now we
[28:38] know the women went to the cross too.
[28:39] But right but there would there would
[28:41] have been some point in there where they
[28:42] were fearful and afraid. Right? He was
[28:45] rejected by everyone. Now eventually
[28:48] they came to the cross. But Jesus bore
[28:51] our sins. The Bible said he was smitten
[28:53] of God. Just like Michelangelo's statue
[28:56] was smitten,
[28:58] right? When Michelangelo got so
[29:01] inspired, it was such a masterpiece, he
[29:03] had to smite it because he was expecting
[29:05] it to speak. God did the same with
[29:07] Jesus. He was wounded. I love that. He
[29:10] was bruised for our iniquities. We've
[29:13] been preaching on iniquities lately. And
[29:15] I got a good testimony. I'm going to
[29:16] read it at the end to make sure I don't
[29:17] forget to I got a good testimony about
[29:19] those iniquity sermons.
[29:22] Yeah,
[29:25] because church, this is something we can
[29:26] all relate to. Iniquity is wickedness
[29:28] when you know what's right and wrong. We
[29:31] all do things wrong when we know we
[29:33] shouldn't do them. But God makes a way
[29:36] to forgive even the purposeful sins.
[29:39] That's God's rich mercy. Praise God.
[29:42] That's why we love him. That's why we
[29:43] praise him. That's why we sing. Because
[29:46] God is merciful despite our sins and our
[29:48] purpose. rejection sometimes of his
[29:51] word. Hallelujah. The Bible said in
[29:54] verse six, he took all of our iniquity.
[29:58] So if Satan's trying to convince you you
[29:59] got a little hanging on, just confess
[30:01] it. And then you know he can't hold it
[30:03] against you any longer. Hallelujah. Just
[30:06] confess everything. Say, "God, forgive
[30:07] me of my past. Forgive me of last week.
[30:09] Forgive me of that. Lord, forgive me. Uh
[30:12] I know I'm guilty. I I deserve
[30:13] punishment, but I believe Jesus has
[30:15] taken my place. Forgive me. and don't
[30:17] let the devil beat me up with my past
[30:19] sins anymore.
[30:21] Hallelujah. Because Jesus paid for all
[30:23] of my iniquities.
[30:26] The Bible said he's like a lamb. This is
[30:27] God's masterpiece. A lamb, a sheep.
[30:31] The Bible said he was cut off, stricken.
[30:34] There was no deceit in his mouth. He
[30:36] wasn't trying to deceive anybody with
[30:38] his words to get a little one up on
[30:40] them. He wasn't trying to convince them
[30:43] uh in in any sinful or prideful or
[30:46] selfish purposes. He said everything
[30:48] with the purest intentions. That's what
[30:50] we need. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[30:55] The Bible said it ple pleased God to
[30:57] bruise him
[30:59] just like Michelangelo was was pleased
[31:02] to smite that. He was overtaken by that.
[31:07] And the Bible says this. Let's read 11
[31:09] and 12. These are just some beautiful
[31:11] verses. He shall see the travail of his
[31:14] soul. So God shall see his son's travail
[31:16] and he shall be satisfied. See, Jesus's
[31:18] sacrifice satisfied God's wrath.
[31:22] The Bible says we're no longer under the
[31:24] wrath of God. God doesn't hold wrath
[31:26] against us. God has love for us.
[31:28] Hallelujah. Jesus paid for the wrath of
[31:31] God.
[31:34] By his knowledge shall my righteous
[31:36] servant justify many. Justify means to
[31:39] declare righteous as one would wish to
[31:42] be in a court setting.
[31:44] Right? If you were in court and you were
[31:46] guilty, your knees would be knocking.
[31:47] You what's my judgment going to be? But
[31:49] Jesus stepped in and paid the fine.
[31:52] Praise God. So, we don't need to be
[31:54] nervous about eternal life. Jesus has
[31:56] paid the fine. He's justified us. Jesus
[31:59] has declared us righteous.
[32:02] Hallelujah.
[32:05] For he shall bear their iniquities.
[32:07] Jesus took my iniquities on him at the
[32:10] cross. Jesus took your iniquities on him
[32:14] at the cross.
[32:16] Therefore, I will divide him a portion
[32:19] with the great. He gets to reign a
[32:21] thousand years in the millennium.
[32:24] Hallelujah. Jesus Christ gets to do
[32:25] that. He gets a portion with the great.
[32:28] Hallelujah. He rules all nations with a
[32:31] rod of iron for a thousand years.
[32:34] Hallelujah. And then there's that
[32:36] mysterious verse we've talked about.
[32:37] Austin and I talked about it. 1
[32:38] Corinthians 15. At some point, once
[32:40] we're in that pyramid-shaped New
[32:42] Jerusalem, Jesus will turn the kingdom
[32:45] back to the father. Now, somebody tell
[32:47] me that mystery. I got a feeling we're
[32:48] not going to know that till we get
[32:49] there. Praise God. The Bible said the
[32:52] son will turn and give the kingdom back
[32:54] to the father. Hallelujah.
[32:58] Amen.
[33:00] The Bible says in verse 12, finishing
[33:02] verse 12, he shall divide the spoil with
[33:05] the strong. See, what were the spoils of
[33:08] the cross? Forgiveness,
[33:10] healing. And that's what we had today.
[33:12] Brother Gary's soul's been healed.
[33:15] Right, Sister Beatatric's soul's been
[33:17] healed. My soul's been healed. Your
[33:19] soul's been healed. We have the spoils
[33:21] of Jesus' victory. Hallelujah.
[33:24] The joy of the Lord, the peace of God,
[33:26] the faith of Jesus. We have all these
[33:29] spoils of what Jesus fought and paid for
[33:32] on the cross. We gain from all of his
[33:35] labor. Hallelujah. We gain from all of
[33:38] his his battles and everything he fought
[33:40] to to die for, live for, died for. We
[33:43] get the benefits of his sacrifice.
[33:46] Hallelujah.
[33:50] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[33:53] death and he was numbered with the
[33:55] transgressors and he bare the sins of
[33:58] many and made intercession for the
[34:00] transgressors.
[34:02] So that's what Jesus did. Jesus went to
[34:04] the father for us. Jesus was uh the
[34:08] intercessor between God and man. As Tim
[34:11] as Paul says in the book of Timothy,
[34:13] there's one ma mediator between God and
[34:15] man. It's the man Christ Jesus. If
[34:18] there's any separation in your heart
[34:20] towards God, go to Jesus. Jesus is your
[34:23] intercessor. Hallelujah. He bore your
[34:26] sins. Hallelujah. He paid your price for
[34:29] your sins. He's, the Bible said, he's
[34:31] ready to pardon you.
[34:33] Amen. This is God's masterpiece. And the
[34:37] church said,
[34:39] "This is God's masterpiece." Hallelujah.
[34:42] Oh, much greater than Michelangelo.
[34:45] Billions, trillions. We don't even know
[34:46] what trillion means anymore with our
[34:47] national debt. We don't even know what
[34:48] it means. But but God's masterpiece is
[34:51] trillions times greater than
[34:53] Michelangelo or your ability to teach or
[34:55] your ability to be a mechanic or
[34:57] something like that.
[34:59] This is God's masterpiece to us.
[35:02] Hallelujah to the lamb of God.
[35:06] I'm glad he loves me. Praise God.
[35:09] Hallelujah.
[35:11] Amen. I found this on uh YouTube and I
[35:14] just from time to time I just look at I
[35:16] think this is God's masterpiece.
[35:19] He hung there for you and I
[35:22] if I'll just make it real to us. He hung
[35:24] there for Aander and Tulsi.
[35:27] For everyone, all the new ones that have
[35:29] been here just got here and all of us
[35:31] older ones. Hallelujah. He hung there
[35:35] for us. This is a masterpiece. And I'm
[35:37] not talking about the wood or the brass,
[35:39] whatever it's made out of. I'm talking
[35:41] about when Jesus died on the cross. That
[35:44] was God's masterpiece.
[35:47] An excellent,
[35:49] skillful work that could not be topped
[35:52] by anyone. Hallelujah. And I'd like to
[35:55] say that today, Lord Jesus, thank you
[35:58] today for everything you've done for me
[36:00] and my family and this church.
[36:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you. I don't do
[36:06] it enough, brother Mercy. I got to do it
[36:07] more. Thank you, Jesus, for all you've
[36:10] done for saving a rest like me.
[36:12] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. God's
[36:16] masterpiece.
[36:17] If you don't like seeing blood, you
[36:19] don't you probably want to close your
[36:20] eyes just for a moment here. But in
[36:22] 2005, I saw the movie The Passion. And
[36:25] this was Mel Gibson's closest idea he
[36:27] could get to what would it look like?
[36:32] And I cried during the movie. I still
[36:34] cry when I think of what God's
[36:36] masterpiece went through to save my
[36:38] soul.
[36:40] The Bible said he was marred more than
[36:43] any man. That's pretty awful. But that
[36:47] that that wasn't even close to what
[36:48] Jesus looked like. There's another verse
[36:50] I couldn't find this morning, but I have
[36:51] to go look. I should have asked the
[36:52] internet. But there's a verse where the
[36:54] Bible said he didn't even resemble a
[36:56] man. I know David said, "I'm more as a
[36:58] worm than a man." And David was
[37:00] prophesying of Christ.
[37:02] So he looked much worse than this. That
[37:05] was God's masterpiece. How different
[37:08] from most churches today, right? How
[37:10] they might present Jesus. But this was
[37:13] God's masterpiece. This is what God was
[37:16] trying to show. He said, "For God so
[37:18] loved, God was expressing. This is my
[37:20] love toward mankind. This is what your
[37:23] sins deserve, but I'm going to pay the
[37:25] price for you." Hallelujah. So you don't
[37:29] have to pay it. Praise God.
[37:34] And church, you know, despite God's
[37:36] masterpiece, sometimes, church, it's a
[37:38] reality. We all struggle with whether
[37:40] we're saved or not, despite what we've
[37:42] read, right? The devil's working on us.
[37:45] You know, the Bible said there's times
[37:46] and seasons where Satan comes to tempt
[37:48] us and so forth. But despite all that,
[37:51] we read Isaiah 53. And despite all the
[37:55] scriptures we've been preaching on about
[37:56] iniquities, we still struggle with it.
[38:02] And our only answer is that God wants to
[38:04] renew our minds. Hallelujah. The Bible
[38:07] not doesn't say once a week God's going
[38:09] to renew your mind. Yes, you should go
[38:10] to church once a week. I'd recommend
[38:12] more. Hallelujah. I go at least twice.
[38:17] The more you're in the house of God, the
[38:18] better you're going to be as long as you
[38:20] have sincerity and truth. Hallelujah.
[38:24] But the Bible says uh in uh uh 2
[38:27] Corinthians 4, if I'm not mistaken, the
[38:29] Bible says that we're renewed in our
[38:31] spirits day by day. Paul says that's the
[38:33] phrase, day by day. Every day we must
[38:36] renew our minds and remember what did
[38:38] God's masterpiece accomplish. And let's
[38:41] remember the cross was a masterpiece.
[38:44] Because the devil tries to make us think
[38:45] it wasn't enough. Surely it was enough,
[38:47] church. Surely the cross was enough.
[38:49] Hallelujah. to cover all of our sins,
[38:53] all of our iniquities,
[38:55] each one of our past. God has paid the
[38:59] price for that and it is forgiven by
[39:01] faith in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[39:03] Romans 3:25 plainly says that faith in
[39:06] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[39:09] Hallelujah.
[39:11] You know, and in this sermon, Brother
[39:12] Random uh he talks about while while
[39:16] before he came out to preach, if you
[39:17] ever been to the tabernacle there, he's
[39:19] got an office, you know, just right off
[39:21] from the pulpit. And he had interviews.
[39:24] There were so many people, he had
[39:25] hundreds of peoples that want that
[39:26] wanted interviews with him. A sister
[39:28] named Sister Bruce had an interview. And
[39:30] brother Bram asked her if they could
[39:31] record it. They recorded it. It's
[39:33] beautiful. If you haven't listened to
[39:33] it, I encourage you to listen to it.
[39:35] It's just like a 10-minute audio.
[39:38] And in this interview, our sis, the
[39:39] sister Bruce, she said,"I just don't
[39:41] feel like I'm saved. How can I be good
[39:43] enough and I don't have the Holy Ghost?"
[39:45] And brother Ram said, "God showed me in
[39:46] a vision you are born again." But she
[39:49] just couldn't accept it because of her
[39:51] own faults. Anybody, you don't have to
[39:53] raise your hand. Don't raise your hand.
[39:55] But some of us might be in that camp. We
[39:57] beat ourselves up so much that we wonder
[40:00] if we're born again.
[40:02] That's an awful camp to be in, right?
[40:04] That's a that's a hard thing to fight.
[40:05] But it's also hard to think, I'm so
[40:07] good. Of course, I'm born again. That's
[40:09] an awful That's another bad state to be
[40:10] in. We need right down the middle.
[40:13] Praise God. I'm a sinner saved by grace,
[40:16] but I'm a child of God. I'm doing
[40:19] everything I can to walk in the power of
[40:21] the Holy Spirit. Daily confessing my
[40:24] sin. Daily being sincere. Hallelujah.
[40:28] Daily telling the truth.
[40:31] And so, you can hear it on tape. She's
[40:33] almost cried. She like, "Brother Bam,
[40:34] but I just don't have an experience."
[40:35] So, Brother, Brother Bam said, "Let me
[40:37] pray that God will let you speak in
[40:39] tonesues so that you can have an
[40:41] experience." And brother Bam said later,
[40:43] Brother Bam says, he said, "Uh, she's a
[40:45] person that needs to speak in tonesues."
[40:47] So, brother, brother Bam thought God
[40:49] would let her do it. But he said, "Some
[40:51] people aren't like that. They can have
[40:52] assurance just because they had a
[40:54] different kind of experience." In other
[40:55] words, God will give you the experience
[40:57] that you need. Don't doubt that because
[41:00] Thomas was like that.
[41:03] Right. Thomas said, "I'm not going to
[41:05] believe unless I can see those prints in
[41:08] his palms and the and the and the
[41:09] piercing of his side." So, what did
[41:11] Jesus do? I'll give it to you. That's a
[41:13] loving God, right? That's a masterpiece
[41:15] right there. Amen. God giving us what we
[41:18] need to believe. Church, we can't
[41:20] believe on our own. The Bible even says
[41:22] in Ephesians chapter 2, "Faith is a gift
[41:24] from God." Hallelujah.
[41:26] Just the ability to believe in Jesus
[41:28] Christ is a gift. Hallelujah. Amen.
[41:31] Children, we're halfway to Christmas.
[41:32] We're going to get some more gifts.
[41:33] Hallelujah. So, think about that. You're
[41:36] going to get You don't even deserve it.
[41:37] Well, some of you do. You know, I guess
[41:38] in some ways. Caris has really been
[41:41] working hard. She deserves some gifts
[41:42] this year.
[41:44] Making me eggs and making breakfast for
[41:46] everybody.
[41:47] But in all reality, you know, we're all
[41:49] sinners. We don't really deserve gifts.
[41:51] But we're g we're given faith just to
[41:54] believe. It's a gift. We don't deserve
[41:57] it. And yet God gives it to us. So it's
[42:01] true for us. Whatever you need to
[42:02] believe, you keep seeking God for it. I
[42:04] believe and the Bible believes. The
[42:05] Bible teaches God will give it to you.
[42:09] What do you need to believe? Ask God for
[42:11] it. God will give it to you.
[42:14] Hallelujah. Amen.
[42:16] Glory. Uh before I would believe, and
[42:19] I've told this many times, but since
[42:20] Tammy here, I thought I might share it.
[42:22] And brother Gary, I needed something to
[42:24] believe that I was called to preach.
[42:25] When I first started preaching in 2004,
[42:27] I needed something to believe.
[42:30] And so, uh, Brother Brooks invited me to
[42:32] preach. I didn't ask to preach. He
[42:33] invited me to preach. And he said, "You
[42:35] can preach a Sunday night service in
[42:36] Lima." I said, "Okay." So, that week
[42:38] after, uh, two days during that week, I
[42:39] fasted the whole day. And after work,
[42:41] after work at school, it was in January.
[42:43] Oh, no. Actually, that's right. I was
[42:45] out of school. Okay. Yeah. So, I just
[42:46] had all day. That was nice. Litty was
[42:47] around. Little Babster.
[42:51] And so Kristen was very kind and
[42:52] gracious as a godly wife is. And she let
[42:54] me go study, pray, fast. Two days I got
[42:56] to fast.
[42:58] And heading into that Sunday night
[42:59] service, I was the most nervous person
[43:01] that I I've ever felt as far as my own
[43:03] self the most nervous I've ever been.
[43:04] But I just cried and prayed and I felt
[43:06] myself shaking. I felt the spirit of God
[43:08] on me. I said, "God, just vindicate.
[43:09] Just show me if I'm called to preach."
[43:11] Right? And I got up there and preached
[43:13] there in Lima. And at the end of the
[43:14] service, uh, the whole altar was filled
[43:16] with people weeping and crying. Brethren
[43:19] would come up and tell me, "I got
[43:20] delivered from video games. I got
[43:21] delivered from cigarettes. I got
[43:22] delivered from all these things." See,
[43:24] those are evil spirits trying to take,
[43:26] they're trying to take your focus away
[43:27] off of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[43:31] And just people weeping and crying. And
[43:32] that happened the first two times I
[43:33] preach in Lima. So God gave me what I
[43:36] needed so I keep preaching even when
[43:38] people don't come to the altar because
[43:41] it's not about it's not about what I
[43:43] need to know. It's not about I have to
[43:44] have people at the altar every time. I
[43:46] just want to be faithful to what God
[43:48] called me to do. Amen. Hallelujah. We
[43:50] all go through seasons of life. Praise
[43:52] God. We all gone through seasons where
[43:54] we see more miracles, seasons where we
[43:56] don't see any miracles. Thank God we
[43:57] have seasons of life, though. It keeps
[43:59] us balanced in the word of God.
[44:00] Hallelujah. Keeps us thankful for the
[44:02] good times. The hard times, right? We
[44:04] got to have the hard times to be
[44:05] thankful for the good times.
[44:08] Now, as hard as this is to say, I'm
[44:09] thankful for CO because now CO's over
[44:12] and we've lived through CO,
[44:14] right? I'm thankful. As hard as is to
[44:17] say, I'm thankful because now we got
[44:20] more freedoms back. Now we don't know
[44:21] how long it's going to last. People got
[44:24] things up their sleeves all the time.
[44:29] But I needed that just like Thomas need.
[44:31] I need to see it. And remember Thomas
[44:33] after he got that, he was no longer
[44:34] doubting. He took the gospel further
[44:36] than anybody else. So don't let anybody
[44:39] talk bad about Thomas around you. At
[44:40] least don't believe it. If you can't
[44:41] stand up for Thomas, just don't believe
[44:43] him.
[44:45] Because after God dissolved his doubt,
[44:46] he was the greatest missionary as far as
[44:48] distance out of all the apostles. That's
[44:51] a true man of God. And what have you,
[44:53] what have you and I done for missionary
[44:54] work. We haven't done as much as Thomas.
[44:57] Right? Amen. Now, brother says, "Now we
[45:01] find that the antivian world, so days of
[45:03] Noah, come along and destroyed the whole
[45:05] thing because the covenants that was
[45:06] made was continually if you'll do this
[45:08] or if you'll do that." So, brother's
[45:10] getting into covenants. God the great
[45:12] sculptor. So now he's talking about
[45:14] Christ seeing that man could not keep a
[45:16] covenant. He just can't do it. Right?
[45:17] Adam and Eve couldn't keep the covenant.
[45:20] Right? They just couldn't do it. He just
[45:23] can't do it. There's just no way at all
[45:25] because he's got a sin nature.
[45:28] And brother Bam said talking about
[45:29] Sister Bruce on the interview a few
[45:31] moments ago. I was speaking to a person
[45:32] in the room that's present now. Speaking
[45:34] of the Sister Bruce, an older sister.
[45:36] She said, "Bro, Brother Brandham, I have
[45:38] so many things I know that's wrong. A
[45:40] godly little woman." on the audio, you
[45:42] can hear her tell her, "I've seen you in
[45:44] a vision. God, let me see you in a
[45:45] vision. You're born again now." Brother
[45:49] Brother Ram's visions came true. Brother
[45:50] Gary, Brother Ram saw a vision of United
[45:52] States Church dancing to rock and roll
[45:55] with very little clothes on. And look
[45:57] what they wear today in the churches,
[45:59] dancing to rock and roll. That was in
[46:00] 1965. And I asked my mom about that. I
[46:03] said, "Mom, you were in the Assemblies
[46:04] of God." That's what brother was talking
[46:05] about. Pentecostal church. I said, "Were
[46:07] they playing rock and roll in Assemblies
[46:09] of God?" My mom's like, "No, I didn't
[46:10] see it till about year 2000."
[46:12] So, Brother Bam told that in advance 35
[46:14] years because it was a vision from God.
[46:17] Right? I told you the story of Tom
[46:18] Brown. Tom Brown, he's passed away now,
[46:20] but Chris and I stayed at his house one
[46:22] night there in Lima and he said, "I was
[46:24] struggling with serpent seed and
[46:25] baptism." And I went to have an
[46:27] interview with brother Brandham and this
[46:28] is the story. I went listen to it. They
[46:30] had the conversation for 15 minutes.
[46:32] Brother Brother Tom Brown asked him all
[46:33] the questions and brother Brandham said,
[46:35] "Okay, praise God. We're done. All your
[46:37] questions answered." He said, "Yes."
[46:38] Brother Rams had the piece of paper. He
[46:40] took the piece of paper, slid it across
[46:42] the table. Tom Brown picked it up and
[46:44] said, "Oh, these are all the questions I
[46:45] had before." Brother Ram wrote them down
[46:48] before Tom Brown got there.
[46:51] Because God showed him visions.
[46:53] Hallelujah. Amen. That's right.
[46:58] So, Brother Ram had a vision of Sister
[46:59] Bruce.
[47:01] But look, sister, you don't look at
[47:02] yourself. I love what Brother says,
[47:04] "Don't look at yourself." So, Sister
[47:05] Bruce is like, "Look, looking looking."
[47:07] Church, all she need to do is do this.
[47:11] Am I going to make it now, church? How
[47:13] how much closer to God would we live if
[47:15] we did this every day? I'm not talking
[47:16] about just looking at a literal picture.
[47:18] But if we stop looking at all of
[47:19] ourselves, oh, look at this stain. And
[47:21] look at this. Oh, my just a mess. If we
[47:23] stop doing this and just look to Christ,
[47:26] how much closer will we live to God?
[47:29] She's I have so many things wrong.
[47:33] There's so many things wrong in my life.
[47:34] Brother Ram said, ' Don't look at
[47:36] yourself. It's just, you know, he tries
[47:38] to summarize it. It's what's your desire
[47:41] is and what you try to do for God. If
[47:44] you really love the Lord, you try to
[47:45] serve him with all your heart. That's
[47:47] Jesus's greatest commandment. Love the
[47:48] Lord your God with all your heart, soul,
[47:50] mind, and strength.
[47:54] And then all your mistakes is hid in the
[47:57] blood of Jesus Christ. See, he made a
[48:01] way. I'm glad he made a way for me,
[48:03] church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[48:08] Doesn't the Bible say that when we get
[48:10] baptized, the Bible said we're buried
[48:11] with him in baptism wherein also you're
[48:14] risen with him. So, we're buried our the
[48:17] old person, our old nature or our desire
[48:20] dies. And we're risen through the faith
[48:22] of the operation of God. It's God's
[48:25] operation. It's God's work. God's the
[48:27] one that gives us a new heart. God gives
[48:30] us faith. whom he hath raised from the
[48:33] dead. And you being dead in your sins,
[48:35] and the uncircumcision of your flesh
[48:37] hath he quickened. Let's all say
[48:38] quicken. Ready? Quicken. Quicken means
[48:40] to make alive, something that's dead. So
[48:43] our lives were dead in sin. But after
[48:45] we're baptized, the Bible said he's
[48:47] quickened us together with him. So we
[48:49] have the same spirit that was on Jesus.
[48:52] It now comes on us.
[48:54] And church, he's forgiven you all your
[48:57] trespasses.
[48:59] Oh, if we could just believe that today.
[49:01] Hallelujah.
[49:04] The Bible said he blotted out. So like
[49:05] the erasing of the handwriting of
[49:08] ordinances that was against us. Jesus
[49:10] blotted it out. He erased it. He did
[49:12] away with it. It was contrary. It was
[49:14] against us, contrary to us, and took it
[49:16] out of the way. And it was nailed to his
[49:18] cross. Paid in full. Hallelujah. The
[49:23] price of all of our sins was paid by the
[49:25] blood of Jesus Christ. That's what the
[49:28] word ransom means. It's a payment,
[49:30] right? We, you know, in the in the
[49:31] world, I saw all kinds of ransom movies.
[49:33] You know, somebody would get abducted
[49:34] and then so somebody had the good guy
[49:36] had to pay the bad guy some ransom
[49:37] money, right? Bunch of nonsense.
[49:41] But that's what Jesus did. Jesus paid
[49:42] the ransom. And that's actually what the
[49:45] word ransom means. It's you go into a uh
[49:48] you go into a pawn shop and you pay
[49:50] money to get something out of the market
[49:53] and now it's yours. And that's what
[49:56] Jesus did. He went down to hell, right?
[49:59] The Bible says he preached to the
[50:00] spirits in prison and he took the keys
[50:02] of death in hell and he rose and he took
[50:05] the Old Testament saints with him. He
[50:07] brought them out of prison. Hallelujah.
[50:09] Proving that their sins were forgiven
[50:12] because he took them out of prison.
[50:14] That's how our lives are. When we get
[50:16] victory over the prison of our sins,
[50:18] that's just proof we're forgiven.
[50:19] Hallelujah.
[50:21] Glory to God. Hope I'm not wearing you
[50:24] out. I'm not even at an hour.
[50:27] But he took it out of the way. He nailed
[50:28] it to his cross.
[50:30] And Jesus said when he had received the
[50:32] vinegar, he said those words, "It is
[50:35] finished." It's got three Greek
[50:37] definitions. That's the first part of
[50:39] it. It's the word uh tell eo. I can't
[50:42] even say it. I'm not I'm not a Hebrew
[50:45] scholar or Greek scholar. But I like
[50:47] this last one. It's finished means to
[50:49] pay. Christ satisfied God's justice by
[50:52] dying for all the sins of the saints.
[50:55] These sins can never let's say never.
[50:57] Ready? Never. Your sins can never be
[51:00] punished again
[51:02] since that would violate God's justice.
[51:06] How can God punish you for his sins when
[51:08] Jesus already took the punishment?
[51:10] Praise God. It's impossible. It would be
[51:12] against the nature of God. Oh, church,
[51:14] we ought to feel free today. We ought to
[51:16] feel forgiven. We ought to feel accepted
[51:19] in the beloved. Hallelujah.
[51:21] God has accepted us in heaven because of
[51:24] the work of Jesus Christ.
[51:26] I love these uh simple Bible messages.
[51:28] Don't you? I love these masterpiece
[51:30] messages.
[51:33] And what did God do? God told his
[51:35] masterpiece to speak the word.
[51:41] Remember when Jesus was on Mount
[51:43] Transfiguration? We looked at it
[51:44] recently.
[51:47] Moses and Elijah, their theophony or
[51:49] celestial bodies the Bible calls them.
[51:51] They came down to talk to Jesus about
[51:53] his death. They prepared him for his
[51:55] death. And there came a voice out of the
[51:58] cloud saying, "This is my beloved son.
[52:00] Hear him." Jesus is God's perfect
[52:02] masterpiece because God said, "Speak or
[52:05] hear him." So, do you see the similarity
[52:08] between Michelangelo and Jesus?
[52:12] Michelangelo was a type of God the
[52:14] Father smiting the son of God.
[52:17] Hallelujah. Michelangelo saw the reality
[52:20] of it. He said, "Speak." And that's what
[52:22] God did. God saw Jesus Christ and God
[52:25] said, "Speak."
[52:27] Hallelujah.
[52:30] And church, these words are so powerful.
[52:32] If you didn't put them on your lips yet
[52:33] today, put them on your lips. Jesus
[52:35] said, "The words that I speak unto you,
[52:37] they are spirit and they are life." You
[52:40] want some life in your life? Start
[52:42] speaking the word of God. Hallelujah.
[52:44] When was the last time you spoke the
[52:45] word of God against your temptations,
[52:48] against your uh depression or anxiety or
[52:51] temptations or lust or greed or guilt or
[52:54] shame? When was the last time you spoke
[52:56] the word against those evil spirits?
[52:59] Do it, church. You'll get the victory.
[53:01] Hallelujah.
[53:03] Don't just stand there. Speak the word
[53:05] of God.
[53:07] John 12:48, the word that I have spoken,
[53:10] the same shall judge him in the last
[53:12] days. So, not only does the word give
[53:13] life, the word will actually judge us as
[53:16] well.
[53:18] Hallelujah. Their life or judgment. Paul
[53:20] said the same thing. Paul's word. So,
[53:22] this is where now we know all scripture
[53:25] will judge us either for the good or the
[53:27] wrong, right? I'm sorry, the good or the
[53:29] bad.
[53:31] Most people don't know that. But Paul's
[53:33] letters will be the judgment standard
[53:36] for us. In other words, the whole Bible
[53:38] will be judged. Did we repent of our
[53:40] sins? Did we let God have full control
[53:42] of our lives? Did we love the Lord our
[53:43] God with all of our heart, soul, mind,
[53:45] and strength? That'll be the judgment,
[53:48] right? But we know the Bible says if
[53:49] we're saved, we're judged for rewards.
[53:53] Hallelujah. Because the sin's already
[53:54] been paid for. And the church said,
[53:56] "Amen. We will never go to be judged for
[53:59] punishment. Jesus already took it.
[54:02] will be judged for what rewards we get.
[54:06] But we all believe the greatest reward
[54:08] uh you know don't talk to me so much
[54:10] about crowns and nations. Talk to me
[54:12] just let me see Jesus. Just let me
[54:13] worship him. Praise God. That's the
[54:15] greatest reward you could give me.
[54:16] Praise God. As brother Ram said, let me
[54:18] just give me 10,000 years laying at the
[54:20] feet of Jesus, kissing the feet of
[54:22] Jesus. That will be enough a reward for
[54:24] me. Praise God.
[54:26] Oh my. Glory to God. Hallelujah. That
[54:30] will be enough. Just let me see him.
[54:32] Hallelujah.
[54:34] Just let me say thank you, Jesus, for
[54:37] what you've done for me. Paul said, "I
[54:40] certify you, brethren. The gospel which
[54:41] was preached of me is not after man."
[54:43] Paul's letters were not man's words.
[54:45] They were God's words. For I neither
[54:47] received it of man, neither was I taught
[54:48] it, but by the revelation of Jesus
[54:50] Christ.
[54:52] So, we know all scripture, Jesus' words,
[54:54] Paul's words, they'll be the judgment
[54:56] standard. For us, it'll be judgment for
[54:58] rewards. For the disobedient, it'll be
[55:00] judgment unto the lake of fire,
[55:03] right? And there's greater damnations in
[55:05] hell. As Jesus said, the Pharisees get
[55:07] the greater damnation
[55:09] because they held the key of knowledge,
[55:11] but they kept people from getting to it.
[55:14] So preachers have the greatest
[55:15] responsibility. I have the greatest
[55:17] responsibility in this congregation
[55:20] because I am preaching God's word. God,
[55:22] let me do it with the sincerity and
[55:24] truth that I should have. Hallelujah.
[55:25] That's why I pray. That's why I seek
[55:26] God.
[55:29] Now, brother Brandham here likens
[55:30] himself to Michelangelo, not to God. So,
[55:34] watch your types there. Watch your watch
[55:36] your types and shadows in your
[55:37] parallels. So, Michelangelo worked for
[55:40] all those years to create a masterpiece.
[55:42] And brother Ram is now going to tell us
[55:44] and I'm we're already almost at an hour.
[55:46] This is kind of the clo kind of near the
[55:48] close, but don't but don't me. It's kind
[55:52] of near the close. So other words,
[55:54] Michelangelo worked for all those years
[55:55] and brother said, "I've worked for all
[55:57] these years on something too
[56:01] and it was an actual teaching from the
[56:02] Bible."
[56:04] In other words, God for years, God was
[56:06] showing him more and more and more about
[56:08] different teachings in the scripture.
[56:12] You might be surprised because I when I
[56:13] when I was listening to this, I was
[56:14] like, "Oh my goodness, I had forgotten.
[56:16] I've listened to this before, of course,
[56:17] but I'd forgotten it." And you might be
[56:20] surprised. What was Brother Brandham's
[56:22] masterpiece?
[56:23] Now, church, I look at I've joked around
[56:25] with my wife. I've written two books,
[56:26] but that last one, the second one, that
[56:28] was 800 pages. I've joked around with my
[56:30] wife wife and said, "That's my
[56:31] masterpiece on it. I ain't going to
[56:32] write anything better than that, as far
[56:33] as I know. I can't even believe I wrote
[56:36] that thing." But, you know, you might
[56:38] look at uh you fixed up a car, that
[56:40] might be your masterpiece. Right?
[56:43] Each one of us, you know, our lives now,
[56:45] your mothers, you fathers, your children
[56:46] are your masterpieces. Hallelujah. All
[56:49] the prayers you put into him, right? All
[56:53] the labor, all the training, all the
[56:54] teaching,
[56:56] right? Like I'm I'm telling Zion, you
[56:58] know, where's Zion? Tell Z Oh, he's
[57:01] sleeping. Oh, he's almost sleeping. I
[57:02] tell Zion, I'm training him. Hey, Zion,
[57:03] put your shoes right here every time. Or
[57:05] Zion, don't leave your socks on the
[57:06] floor. Zion, go take your socks to the
[57:08] dirty basket. Right. All that training.
[57:10] I'm trying to produce a masterpiece
[57:12] where he cleans up after himself.
[57:15] Hallelujah. As parents,
[57:18] God's trying to make us a masterpiece.
[57:20] Hallelujah.
[57:22] Where we can give God glory in our
[57:24] lives. But I want you to see this.
[57:27] Brother Ram wasn't a sculptor. Brother
[57:28] Brham was a preacher. So, let's look at
[57:31] what his masterpiece was.
[57:35] His masterpiece is this idea of a wheat
[57:37] plant. And I'm going to show pictures
[57:38] here in just a minute, but let me read
[57:40] this.
[57:41] And the wheat plant represents the life
[57:43] of the church through the last 2,000
[57:46] years. So the wheat plant represents the
[57:49] church growing for 2,000 years. I think
[57:52] you'll catch it once I show the picture.
[57:54] Shouldn't be too hard to understand by
[57:56] God's grace. I hope not.
[57:59] Now, and I'll say this, if Gary and and
[58:01] Tammy can catch it, then everybody could
[58:02] catch it because this is their first
[58:03] time here in a long time. All right? And
[58:06] if not, you pray about it. We can have a
[58:07] Bible study about this. I can break it
[58:09] down a little further. I'm probably
[58:10] going to preach multiple, this is
[58:11] probably going to be a series. I'm going
[58:12] to preach multiple sermons on this here.
[58:15] He says, "Now the stalk doesn't look
[58:16] like the seed, right? The stalk's the
[58:18] first part that comes out of the ground.
[58:19] Neither does the tassel or the head part
[58:21] of the wheat plant. Now, Pentecostal
[58:23] brethren throughout the nations, I want
[58:24] you to listen, my brother, if this is
[58:26] the last message I'll ever preach,"
[58:28] which it wasn't. But he's saying, "This
[58:30] is my masterpiece." What? Brother
[58:33] Brandham spearheaded the charismatic and
[58:35] Pentecostal revival after the World War
[58:37] II. Uh he was the leader of this and his
[58:40] masterpiece was the wheat plant.
[58:44] Yes sir. Yes sir. The wheat plant
[58:48] because it ties in the seven church
[58:50] ages. It ties in the baptism of the Holy
[58:52] Ghost. Hallelujah.
[58:55] Ties in the four beasts up in heaven. It
[58:58] just ties everything all in together. It
[59:01] ties in the statue of perfect man.
[59:05] Do you notice when the wheat, the corn
[59:07] of the wheat falls in the ground. So the
[59:09] seed falls in the ground when it begins
[59:11] to form back to its grain again. So
[59:13] think about a seed of wheat going into
[59:15] the ground and all produces. Think about
[59:17] that whole process to get the seed to
[59:20] come back to seed. That's what brother
[59:22] Ram says. That's my masterpiece.
[59:26] Hallelujah. I was shocked, too. Some of
[59:29] your faces look kind of shocked. No, I'm
[59:30] just kidding.
[59:32] But I was shocked. I was right on the
[59:33] mor like what did I catch that right? I
[59:34] said let me go back and listen to that.
[59:36] He said this was his masterpiece. In
[59:38] other words, for years and years and
[59:40] years he preached
[59:42] to see the reality so the people could
[59:45] see this masterpiece. And church to me
[59:46] it is a masterpiece. I hope it is to
[59:48] you.
[59:50] Watch nature now. Not nature sharp.
[59:53] Nature exactly is God. We love using her
[59:56] names in I like those Bible names. He
[59:59] said God working in nature. It's all he
[1:00:02] can. Is God working in you today,
[1:00:03] sister? But from the Pentecostal revival
[1:00:07] as they think was the seed, it wasn't.
[1:00:10] So, think of 1906 Isuza Street. They
[1:00:13] thought that was the seed. They thought
[1:00:15] God's life had come all the way back to
[1:00:18] maturity. But I'm saying no, they're
[1:00:20] still more maturing the church needs to
[1:00:22] go through. Now, I preached on that two
[1:00:24] years ago. Isuza Street was a phenomenal
[1:00:26] revival. In one place, brother Ram
[1:00:28] called it the second greatest revival
[1:00:30] since the day of Pentecost. It was such
[1:00:32] amazing revival, miracles, uh gifts of
[1:00:35] the Holy Spirit, healing, supernatural.
[1:00:38] Remember when they first sent their
[1:00:39] missionaries across the ocean, uh to
[1:00:43] England and China, they would preach in
[1:00:45] English and the Chinese and uh the
[1:00:48] Russians and and the Europeans, they
[1:00:51] would hear them in their own language
[1:00:52] without an interpreter. That's just like
[1:00:55] the day of Pentecost.
[1:00:57] That's how powerful that revival was.
[1:00:59] Hallelujah.
[1:01:03] He said, "But they thought it was a
[1:01:04] seed, but it wasn't." Now watch. But
[1:01:05] something come forth like the seed. Now
[1:01:08] watch what Jesus said in Matthew 24:24.
[1:01:10] Jesus said, "The two spirits at the last
[1:01:12] days," now this is a paraphrase, "would
[1:01:14] be so close together, it would deceive
[1:01:16] the very elected if it were possible."
[1:01:19] So, brother said Pentecost was close,
[1:01:23] but it wasn't quite yet the fullness of
[1:01:26] the word.
[1:01:29] Now, here is Brother Ram's masterpiece.
[1:01:32] Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is like
[1:01:34] a is like a grain of wheat." In Mark
[1:01:37] chapter 4, the earth brings forth fruit
[1:01:39] of herself. First, the blade. So, we'd
[1:01:41] say this is the blade or the stalk,
[1:01:43] right? And I had chat GTP make this for
[1:01:45] me. So, I appreciate AI. Hallelujah. I
[1:01:47] don't think it's going to take over our
[1:01:48] lives. The Bible doesn't predict that.
[1:01:52] We just got to learn to use it the right
[1:01:53] way. First the blade, then the ear,
[1:01:57] which now we call it the head.
[1:02:00] And after that, the full corn or the
[1:02:02] corn, the seed comes back to its
[1:02:04] fullness.
[1:02:06] The fullness of this plant where it
[1:02:08] started, it produces it again.
[1:02:11] And church, this is like Jesus
[1:02:12] resurrection. Jesus was one seed
[1:02:14] planted, but when he rose, many rose
[1:02:17] with him. There's not just one seed up
[1:02:18] here. There's many resurrected with
[1:02:20] Jesus. Hallelujah. In other words, one
[1:02:22] seed multiplies and produces many more.
[1:02:25] And that's what we are. We are the
[1:02:26] offspring of God. The Bible says we are
[1:02:29] the seed of God. Hallelujah.
[1:02:32] The Bible says, "Be born again of the
[1:02:33] incorruptible seed, the word of God."
[1:02:35] So, let me say like this. Even our young
[1:02:37] people, each of us need the seed of God
[1:02:39] in our souls. That's what you receive
[1:02:42] when you get the Holy Ghost. You get a
[1:02:43] spiritual seed and then it starts
[1:02:45] growing. Right, Brother Gary?
[1:02:46] Hallelujah. It starts growing. The more
[1:02:48] you feed that seed, keep it in water,
[1:02:50] keep it in sunlight, keep it in the
[1:02:51] ground, the more it grows. God's life
[1:02:53] should be growing in our lives. Amen.
[1:02:57] Sorry,
[1:02:59] got that preacher in me. The loud
[1:03:01] preacher in me.
[1:03:03] There's a time to be loud. So these
[1:03:06] three stages represent Luther's revival
[1:03:09] in the 1500s, John Wesley's revival in
[1:03:12] the 1700s, 1800s, and then brother
[1:03:15] Bram's revival here from the 1940s even
[1:03:17] to today.
[1:03:19] Or you could say this represents the
[1:03:22] seven church ages of Sardis,
[1:03:24] Philadelphia, and now we're in the
[1:03:26] Leodysian church age. That's the church
[1:03:29] age that we're living in as Jesus
[1:03:31] prophesied in Revelation chapter 2 and
[1:03:33] three.
[1:03:34] Hallelujah. So now, can everybody get a
[1:03:36] good understanding what brother's
[1:03:38] talking about? This was his masterpiece
[1:03:41] to see that the church was planted.
[1:03:43] Glory. The church was planted on the day
[1:03:44] of Pentecost,
[1:03:46] right? And that life kept moving up. But
[1:03:49] what does the life have to do? The life
[1:03:50] has to eventually bring it back to seed.
[1:03:55] Can everybody see that? All right.
[1:03:57] Glory.
[1:03:59] Now, I'm going to get to this later, but
[1:04:00] there's all these different elements in
[1:04:02] here.
[1:04:04] And I didn't even get to all of them.
[1:04:05] There's, like I said, there's church
[1:04:06] ages in here. Uh there's the statue of
[1:04:08] man that we got hanging up on the wall
[1:04:09] there. All these Bible truths, but some
[1:04:12] of these elements are in the
[1:04:13] masterpiece, the anointed ones of the
[1:04:15] end time, which we're going to see here
[1:04:16] shortly.
[1:04:18] In other words, Jesus said at the end
[1:04:19] time, there's going to be two groups
[1:04:20] with the same anointing.
[1:04:23] The Bible calls them false Christ. Well,
[1:04:25] Christ means anointed. They're false
[1:04:26] teachers, but they have the Christ
[1:04:28] anointing. They have they do God does
[1:04:29] miracles in their lives just like Balum.
[1:04:33] There's my hour.
[1:04:35] They have the right anointing, but
[1:04:36] they're false teachers. So, see, church,
[1:04:39] just because people have miracles, that
[1:04:40] doesn't mean they're saved.
[1:04:43] That it just means they for a time and
[1:04:45] season, they stop sinning. They come do
[1:04:47] miracles. God anoints them to do
[1:04:48] miracles because they consecrate. They
[1:04:50] sacrifice for God, but then they go back
[1:04:52] right into iniquity. Jesus talked about
[1:04:53] in Matthew chapter 7. He said, "Many
[1:04:56] will say in that day, Lord, Lord, have
[1:04:58] we not prophesied, spoke in tongues,
[1:04:59] done many wonderful works in your name?"
[1:05:01] Jesus never denied it. Jesus said,
[1:05:03] "Depart from me, you workers of
[1:05:05] iniquity. I never knew you." In other
[1:05:08] words, they had miracles. They had all
[1:05:10] these things. But then when they were
[1:05:11] done with that, they would go living
[1:05:13] into their sinful conditions. It's so
[1:05:14] important to live a clean life when you
[1:05:17] leave church. Hallelujah.
[1:05:19] If God is if God does give you some
[1:05:21] miracle or some gift, thank God for it.
[1:05:23] But you better live for God Monday
[1:05:25] through Saturday. Praise God.
[1:05:28] Just living for God on Sunday is an
[1:05:30] awful thing to do. It's a dishonest
[1:05:33] thing to do. That's what workers of
[1:05:35] iniquity do. They live just they only
[1:05:36] live godly on Sunday. We should live
[1:05:38] godly every day of our lives.
[1:05:39] Hallelujah. If you're married, you're
[1:05:42] lucky like me. I got a wife to keep me
[1:05:43] in line, too. Praise God. She'll point
[1:05:45] out when I'm wrong. I appreciate that. I
[1:05:48] got children that can point out when I'm
[1:05:49] wrong, too. Let's say if I'm just
[1:05:50] walking the flesh or something like
[1:05:51] that. I'm thankful for that. And I'm
[1:05:54] there, too, to help out my family.
[1:05:55] Hallelujah.
[1:05:57] But brother also uses this uses this to
[1:06:00] show how denominations now the systems
[1:06:02] are dead. People can still get saved in
[1:06:05] them,
[1:06:08] but the systems themselves are dead
[1:06:10] because they write up their creeds. I'll
[1:06:12] just use this and and church. I was in
[1:06:13] denomination. I know that. I mean, I
[1:06:15] went I went through classes to join the
[1:06:16] Assemblies of God. They've got they've
[1:06:19] got their own book outside the Bible.
[1:06:21] And they said, "You got to believe this,
[1:06:22] Jesse." And I'm like, "No, I I just got
[1:06:24] to believe this."
[1:06:26] Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] But see, the system's dead. God has
[1:06:30] moved out of all denominations
[1:06:33] because they write up their creeds and
[1:06:35] manuals and bylaws, and that's the only
[1:06:37] way God's going to work. And he's not
[1:06:38] going to work outside of that. That's a
[1:06:40] lie. And that's what that that's what
[1:06:43] this is. Uh let me get to that one.
[1:06:47] That I'll just skip ahead just for a
[1:06:48] moment. That's what this plant shows.
[1:06:50] God did a great work during during
[1:06:52] Martin Luther's life. He was filled with
[1:06:55] the Holy Ghost, but he didn't have all
[1:06:57] the truth. He still smoked cigars, drank
[1:07:00] alcohol.
[1:07:02] He didn't have he didn't have a
[1:07:03] revelation of living a sanctified life,
[1:07:06] but he had justification by faith. He
[1:07:08] brought them out of Romanism. Amen.
[1:07:10] Thank God for Martin Luther. Amen. He's
[1:07:12] one I'm going to walk up to and thank
[1:07:13] you. Martin, you're Martin Luther. Your
[1:07:15] testimony meant a lot to me on earth.
[1:07:17] Hallelujah. I'm I like using you, buddy,
[1:07:19] because you sit right up here. He's
[1:07:21] another one. Martin Luther, I'm going to
[1:07:22] thank thank you for standing against
[1:07:23] Romanism. Hallelujah.
[1:07:26] And then I walk up to John Wesley
[1:07:27] because you know Luther can only live a
[1:07:29] certain time. And then God said, I'm I'm
[1:07:31] going to take this life and I'm going to
[1:07:33] bring it into the head. It's the same
[1:07:34] life. But notice here's what brother
[1:07:36] says. The life left the stalk.
[1:07:39] Eventually the life leaves the stalk and
[1:07:41] it goes up into the head. And that was
[1:07:44] John Wesley. John Wesley's like, "You
[1:07:46] better live a clean life now, church. He
[1:07:48] was really strict. You couldn't even
[1:07:50] drink coffee. Now, I don't see I
[1:07:52] wouldn't have been a good Methodist.
[1:07:55] But you you couldn't. I went to Charles
[1:07:56] Finny's church over there in Oberlin.
[1:07:58] They had to swear, I will not drink tea
[1:08:00] or coffee.
[1:08:02] That's how that was extreme, right?
[1:08:04] Because we know now we have liberty of
[1:08:06] the Holy Ghost. But they were so and
[1:08:07] sure they live short lives. I don't
[1:08:08] blame them. You know, they they didn't
[1:08:10] have proper hygiene and all these
[1:08:11] things. I mean, the the average lifespan
[1:08:13] was very very short. And they didn't
[1:08:14] understand science, germs, all these
[1:08:16] things. But they were so they they they
[1:08:18] they learned. In other words, the life
[1:08:20] moved up and now it's something new.
[1:08:22] Now, oh, we got to live closer to God.
[1:08:24] We shouldn't drink. We shouldn't smoke
[1:08:26] cigars.
[1:08:27] God revealed more of that to John Wesley
[1:08:31] and church. They hated him. They threw
[1:08:33] him out of churches. They threw pumpkins
[1:08:34] and tomatoes at him and all because he
[1:08:36] said, "You got to live a holy life." Who
[1:08:39] threw the pumpkins and everything?
[1:08:40] Lutheran that didn't move on to more
[1:08:43] truth of God. And the church said,
[1:08:47] No, was there a there was no doubt some
[1:08:49] good people in there. There are still
[1:08:50] are. Right. Tammy uh Tammy Kristen were
[1:08:53] in the Lutheran church and my mom's
[1:08:55] still in the uh uh my mom's still in the
[1:08:57] summies of God. There's good people,
[1:08:58] same people in there. But see, when a
[1:09:02] church I'm talking about a church
[1:09:03] system, when they fail to accept more of
[1:09:05] the Bible, God has to move on because
[1:09:08] that's what God said. The kingdom of God
[1:09:10] is like unto a wheat plant. That's
[1:09:13] brother Ram's masterpiece.
[1:09:16] So what did John Wesley say? He said,
[1:09:18] uh, live a life of dedication and
[1:09:20] consecration and sanctification.
[1:09:23] But that was wonderful. But that wasn't
[1:09:25] it. There was still chaff. I'm going
[1:09:27] back here. There was still chaff. And
[1:09:29] brother Ram said that was Isuza Street.
[1:09:32] It was so close.
[1:09:34] But church, we preached on that. What
[1:09:36] did they do? Pretty soon they they said,
[1:09:38] "Okay, everybody's got to speak in
[1:09:39] tongues." That was the chass mistake
[1:09:42] right there. They now that's what that's
[1:09:44] why I left the denomination of
[1:09:45] Assemblies of God. That pastor told me,
[1:09:47] I love my pastor. I love my former
[1:09:48] pastor. He said, "Jesse, you got to
[1:09:49] speak in tongues." I said, and I went to
[1:09:51] the Bible. I said, 'The Bible says not
[1:09:53] all speak with tongues.
[1:09:55] So I said, "Pastor, what about that?" He
[1:09:56] said, "Well, that's what we believe." I
[1:09:57] said, "Okay, pastor, I love you, but I
[1:09:58] can't I'm not going to join the church."
[1:10:00] Even at that, even before I heard
[1:10:01] brother's message, I knew that was wrong
[1:10:04] because that's chaff. The life, the life
[1:10:07] was once in there. God's life was in
[1:10:08] there once, but now it's matured. It's
[1:10:11] moving on. time is going on and the the
[1:10:13] life has now come into the seed. And
[1:10:16] what is the seed? The seed is the full
[1:10:18] revelation of God's word that God had
[1:10:21] brother Brandham preach. Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] It's all these revelations of water
[1:10:26] baptism. Baptism is to be performed in
[1:10:28] the name of Jesus Christ. God is one
[1:10:31] person.
[1:10:33] Hallelujah. Women are not called to
[1:10:35] preach. Hallelujah. Uh the rapture is
[1:10:37] pre-tribulation rapture. Hallelujah. All
[1:10:40] these hell is not eternal. How can you
[1:10:43] burn eternally if you don't have eternal
[1:10:45] life?
[1:10:47] And the Bible said the only way to have
[1:10:48] eternal life is to believe in Jesus.
[1:10:52] God would be unjust to make somebody
[1:10:54] burn eternally for only sinning for a
[1:10:56] few decades. Right? And that was the
[1:10:58] Catholic. The Catholics made that up.
[1:11:00] And I'm not bashing individuals. I'm
[1:11:02] bashing the system. Hallelujah.
[1:11:05] The creeds and the bylaws. Everybody
[1:11:09] understand? See, the chaff is so close
[1:11:12] similar to what the wheat was, but it
[1:11:14] pulls away from the seed. And here's the
[1:11:15] verse brother used to talk about. It's
[1:11:17] beautiful. As many as I love in
[1:11:19] Leodysia, I rebuke and chasen. Be
[1:11:21] zealous, therefore, and repent. Behold,
[1:11:23] I stand at the door and knock. If any
[1:11:26] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[1:11:28] will come into him and will s with him,
[1:11:30] and he with me. To him that overcomemeth
[1:11:33] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:11:35] even as I also overcame and sat down
[1:11:38] with my father in his throne. So here's
[1:11:40] what brother Random observed.
[1:11:43] Brother Ram said the church didn't have
[1:11:45] Christ. Right? Because Christ is
[1:11:46] knocking trying to get back in. Right?
[1:11:49] He's outside the church. He's trying to
[1:11:51] get back in the church.
[1:11:53] Okay? He's outside the church just like
[1:11:57] the chaff when it pulls apart it doesn't
[1:11:59] have the seat anymore. Isn't that
[1:12:01] beautiful?
[1:12:02] The seed comes out of the chaff. The
[1:12:05] dominations reject the word. So this is
[1:12:08] what happened when when uh this is what
[1:12:10] happened when when Martin Luther was
[1:12:11] here, right? Martin Luther was the seed,
[1:12:14] but he this was the chaff, the old
[1:12:16] system was Romanism. Luther was the
[1:12:19] life. Hallelujah. John Wesley was the
[1:12:22] life coming out of the old Lutheran
[1:12:24] system. Hallelujah. Amen. The Zuza
[1:12:28] Street was the new life coming out of
[1:12:30] the old Methodist system. And what we
[1:12:32] call the message of the hour is the new
[1:12:34] life coming out of Pentecostalism,
[1:12:37] the denomination.
[1:12:40] I hope you see it today by God's grace.
[1:12:43] Hallelujah.
[1:12:46] So now we can see the two previous uh
[1:12:50] parts die, but the life stays in the
[1:12:53] seed.
[1:12:55] Hallelujah. This shows the life of the
[1:12:57] Holy Ghost passing through the church
[1:12:59] ages. And brother Bram said, "That's my
[1:13:02] masterpiece." In other words, God gave
[1:13:04] him a revelation just like God gave uh
[1:13:06] Martin Luther the the revelation of the
[1:13:08] just shall live by faith. You know where
[1:13:10] he got that, church? He got that out of
[1:13:11] Habach in the Old Testament.
[1:13:14] He He's reading the Old Testament. Then
[1:13:16] he goes to Romans and he sees it's
[1:13:17] repeated. and he's and he's a he's a
[1:13:20] he's a Catholic monk or he's a Catholic
[1:13:22] priest on his knees with the prayer
[1:13:24] beads and he realizes God gives him
[1:13:26] revelation. I don't have to do this. I
[1:13:27] don't have to get forgiven by uh prayer
[1:13:30] beads. I'm forgiven by the blood of
[1:13:32] Jesus. I'm forgiven by faith.
[1:13:33] Hallelujah. And it caused the revival.
[1:13:36] The life left there. The life went
[1:13:37] through Martin Luther and here it comes.
[1:13:39] And even now to us, we should be
[1:13:41] grateful. The life is with us.
[1:13:43] Hallelujah.
[1:13:44] I know because I went to all all similar
[1:13:47] churches like this. When I first got
[1:13:48] saved, I went to a very similar Lutheran
[1:13:50] church, but I saw they didn't have the
[1:13:52] full life of Christ. They uh the
[1:13:54] churches allow them to live in sin,
[1:13:56] commit fornication,
[1:13:58] uh watch dirty movies, smoke and drink
[1:14:01] and cuss and all these. A Christian, the
[1:14:03] Bible says a Christian shouldn't do
[1:14:04] those things.
[1:14:06] The Bible says if you say cuss words,
[1:14:08] then your religion's in vain. And yet,
[1:14:10] and then people watch movies filled with
[1:14:12] all these cuss words. How can they enjoy
[1:14:14] that? If you got the spirit of Christ,
[1:14:16] you can enjoy that.
[1:14:19] And I saw that. And so it's like I went
[1:14:22] through this myself, brother Mercy, in
[1:14:23] my own life. I went through this and
[1:14:26] then I went through more that were more
[1:14:27] dedicated. And of course, I was raised
[1:14:29] in that. I knew what that was. I knew
[1:14:30] there was power. God healed my my mom
[1:14:32] cancer. I know there's power. It it was
[1:14:34] I know there's power in the Pentecostal
[1:14:35] movement. But when they say you got to
[1:14:37] speak in tonesues and church, I tried to
[1:14:38] speak in tonesues and I didn't do it. I
[1:14:40] tried. I tried.
[1:14:44] And that's because the Bible said no man
[1:14:46] can add one cubit to his stature.
[1:14:48] Whatever gift is inside of you, that's
[1:14:49] the gift God that's God's going to come
[1:14:51] out in that gift. Hallelujah. You can't
[1:14:53] add one gift to your life. Whatever God
[1:14:55] wants you to be, it's already in you
[1:14:56] when you're born. Tulsi and Vander
[1:14:59] already got those gifts inside of their
[1:15:00] lives. Amen. We're just going to see
[1:15:01] what it is.
[1:15:03] Like we're seeing Jen's gift right now
[1:15:05] in Victoria on the music, right? Music
[1:15:08] is a gift of healing. And the church
[1:15:09] said, "When they play music, it sets us
[1:15:12] free from mind battles and uh doubt,
[1:15:14] unbelief, just like David played the
[1:15:16] harp and it set Saul free from the evil
[1:15:17] spirits that tormented him." Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] I know I'm going long. I'm Okay. Hour
[1:15:22] and 10 minutes. All right.
[1:15:25] Okay. Let me uh close. How many more?
[1:15:27] Let me see how many slides I got here.
[1:15:31] I got a lot here.
[1:15:34] Okay. Well, let me just show this for uh
[1:15:36] Brother Gary and just for us. So in
[1:15:38] other words, the gentile bride is God's
[1:15:40] masterpiece. So these this is the church
[1:15:42] ages since 53 AD. That's about 20 years
[1:15:46] after the day of Pentecost all the way
[1:15:48] up till today. Jesus's seven letters to
[1:15:51] the seven church ages were they were
[1:15:53] prophetic. They were actual letters to
[1:15:55] the churches around 100 AD. But they
[1:15:57] were also prophetic because revelation
[1:15:58] is a book of prophecy.
[1:16:01] So as the life of God, that's the white
[1:16:03] part, the life of God moves through the
[1:16:05] the the wheat plant. So that light moves
[1:16:08] through these circles or these we call
[1:16:10] them suns or moons or whatever they
[1:16:12] might be just circles. Okay everybody
[1:16:14] understand by God's grace and God sent
[1:16:16] these messengers Paul Iranius Martin
[1:16:18] Columbus Martin Luther John Wesley and
[1:16:20] we put brother Brandham there because he
[1:16:22] spoke with thus sayith the Lord. I have
[1:16:24] a video at least six times he said thus
[1:16:26] sayith the Lord and it came to pass.
[1:16:28] Sometimes 10 years later sometimes 35
[1:16:30] years later like I told you he was a
[1:16:32] prophet of God. Who else do you know
[1:16:34] that said thus sayith the Lord and it
[1:16:35] came to pass? I don't know anybody other
[1:16:37] than the Bible. And then of course the
[1:16:40] proof of that was he gave us pure Bible
[1:16:42] doctrine. Hallelujah.
[1:16:45] Now brother Ram then brings it to us
[1:16:47] church. You were smitten out. Right?
[1:16:50] Just like God's masterpiece was smitten.
[1:16:52] So were you smitten out. You're you're a
[1:16:55] part of God's masterpiece. In other
[1:16:56] words,
[1:16:59] because the Bible said, "I've heuned
[1:17:01] them by my prophets." So God used
[1:17:02] prophets to cut out believers. In other
[1:17:05] words, to separate his faithful
[1:17:07] followers from those that don't want to
[1:17:10] be faithful.
[1:17:12] And that's what Jesus said. Chris,
[1:17:13] remember we did this, brother? Think not
[1:17:15] that I'm come to send peace on the
[1:17:16] earth. Everybody thinks, "Oh, when I
[1:17:18] become a Christian, everything's going
[1:17:19] to be peaceful." It's exactly the
[1:17:21] opposite.
[1:17:22] Jesus said, "I came not to send peace,
[1:17:25] but a sword." And what sword? Truth. The
[1:17:27] word. I came to bring truth. And what
[1:17:30] it'll do, it'll set a man against his
[1:17:33] father, a daughter against her mother,
[1:17:35] the daughter-in-law against her
[1:17:37] mother-in-law, a man's foe shall be they
[1:17:39] of his own household.
[1:17:42] He that loveth father more than me is
[1:17:45] not worthy me. He that loveth son or
[1:17:47] daughter more than me is not worthy me.
[1:17:49] And he that taketh not his cross, so he
[1:17:51] we have a daily dying we must do. We
[1:17:52] have a daily cross we must take up and
[1:17:55] follow after me is not worthy of me. He
[1:17:58] that finds his life shall lose it. He
[1:18:01] that loses his life for my sake shall
[1:18:04] find it. Amen. Hallelujah. So other
[1:18:07] words, to find, you have to lose. If you
[1:18:10] lose, you win. I say like you got to
[1:18:12] lose if you want to win. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:18:14] going to skip ahead. I'm going to try to
[1:18:15] close here. And now, church, see, God's
[1:18:18] people are called to speak as well
[1:18:19] because we're part of God's masterpiece.
[1:18:21] Now, I'm kind of going too fast here at
[1:18:23] the end, but I just want you to
[1:18:24] understand, you are part of God's
[1:18:26] masterpiece. God wants you to speak the
[1:18:28] word of God. God's masterpiece is this
[1:18:30] church for the last 2,000 years. Aren't
[1:18:32] you glad you're part of it? God cut
[1:18:35] believers out of Ephesus, Samrna,
[1:18:37] Pergamos. He cut them out there, right?
[1:18:40] All the way down Sardis, Philadelphia.
[1:18:41] And now God's cutting believers out of
[1:18:43] the church systems, right?
[1:18:46] And he's bringing them to him. He's
[1:18:48] cutting them out, making them separate
[1:18:50] to manifest all the seed life, all the
[1:18:54] word of God. We just don't want to
[1:18:55] believe some of the word. We want to
[1:18:57] believe all the word, the life, the
[1:19:00] original life of the seed. In other
[1:19:01] words, we want to be a book of acts
[1:19:02] church just like the book of acts church
[1:19:05] in Acts chapter 2.
[1:19:09] So see what what can you say church? You
[1:19:11] can say to people come hear the word of
[1:19:13] God. Come pray with me. Come let's do a
[1:19:16] Bible study, right? Come pray. Come seek
[1:19:18] God. Because the Bible said the spirit,
[1:19:20] the Holy Spirit and the bride. Who's the
[1:19:22] bride? The woman who's going to marry
[1:19:23] Jesus, the church. The spirit and the
[1:19:26] bride say, "Come." Let him that hear us
[1:19:28] say, "Come." And let him that is a
[1:19:30] thirst come. And whosoever will, let him
[1:19:33] take the water of life freely. See, the
[1:19:36] this the the Bible truths we're
[1:19:38] preaching today is life. That's why when
[1:19:41] we go often to older denominations, we
[1:19:44] don't hear a lot of life in their
[1:19:45] sermons because they haven't accepted
[1:19:47] the life. They haven't accepted the full
[1:19:50] truth of God's word. Hallelujah. That
[1:19:52] that's why God brought me through that
[1:19:54] that whole leaf plant system myself. I
[1:19:56] went through I went through that whole
[1:19:57] thing to until now I can see the seed. I
[1:20:00] can see the word. I can see the life of
[1:20:02] Jesus Christ. The real life I should
[1:20:04] live. Hallelujah.
[1:20:07] Brother Bam says, "Yes, sir. The church
[1:20:09] is no longer the mouthpiece of God."
[1:20:10] Speaking about the stalk or the head,
[1:20:12] right? Or the chaff. That's not the life
[1:20:15] of God because God is bringing it back
[1:20:17] to his seed. We're in the time of the
[1:20:18] finishing of the seed.
[1:20:20] It is the church is its own mouthpiece.
[1:20:23] So God is turning on her. He will
[1:20:25] confound her through the prophet and the
[1:20:27] bride. For the voice of God will be in
[1:20:29] her. Because we just read it. Yes, it
[1:20:32] is. For it says in the last chapter of
[1:20:34] Revelation verse 17, the spirit and the
[1:20:36] bride say come once more. The world will
[1:20:39] hear direct from God as at Pentecost.
[1:20:41] But of course that word bride will be
[1:20:43] repudiated as in the first church age.
[1:20:48] And I want you to I want you to
[1:20:49] encourage with with this as well.
[1:20:52] There's some people that that they say,
[1:20:53] "Well, only Brother Brandham's the voice
[1:20:55] of God or only Billy Graham's the voice
[1:20:57] of God." Or, in other words, that they
[1:20:58] try to say, "Well, you'll never be the
[1:21:00] voice of God." Church, every one of you,
[1:21:02] God can use your voice for his glory.
[1:21:04] And brother Ram taught that. Brother
[1:21:05] Graham never said, "I'm the only voice
[1:21:06] of God." Like they try to say today or
[1:21:08] you should only listen to uh any
[1:21:11] preacher. You can put any preacher name
[1:21:12] and Joel Ostein or TD Jake or what John
[1:21:15] MacArthur. They're the voice of God. As
[1:21:18] the Bible says, we can all be voices of
[1:21:21] God. God wants you to speak. God wants
[1:21:24] me to speak for him. I just want you to
[1:21:26] see this. It might encourage you today.
[1:21:29] I was talking about the the educated
[1:21:31] denominations. Yeah. They've been to
[1:21:32] Bible school. We're so smart, right? We
[1:21:34] know the Bible from generation to
[1:21:35] generation. And yet they think an apple
[1:21:38] caused all the sin in the world. They
[1:21:39] think an apple. And brother said, "If it
[1:21:41] was an apple, let's pass them out again
[1:21:42] so these women know they're naked out on
[1:21:43] the streets." Right?
[1:21:46] It wasn't an apple. It was adultery.
[1:21:48] Because as soon as they ate that fruit,
[1:21:50] the fruit of adultery, now God tells the
[1:21:52] serpent, "You've got seed. She's got
[1:21:53] seed." Seed means offspring. As soon as
[1:21:57] they ate of the fruit, it was it was
[1:21:58] symbolism. As soon as they partake of
[1:22:00] that fruit, now we got two offsprings.
[1:22:02] Well, how did that happen? It wasn't it
[1:22:03] wasn't even that's God's words. That's
[1:22:06] not what Adam said. That's what God
[1:22:07] said. God started the serpent seed
[1:22:10] teaching.
[1:22:12] People don't know that, right? They just
[1:22:13] they're so smart that they're they're
[1:22:16] caught up in their own creeds and
[1:22:17] denominations. And that's what Jesus
[1:22:19] said in Matthew 15. They make their
[1:22:22] traditions the doctrines of men.
[1:22:24] Therefore, their vain is worship. And
[1:22:26] the church said, "So many people are
[1:22:29] giving vain worship today because
[1:22:30] they've created their own creeds and and
[1:22:32] they won't accept the life of God, the
[1:22:34] truth of God's word." That's just one of
[1:22:37] the many, many.
[1:22:39] Now, I'm just going to skip down here.
[1:22:40] Jesus said, "I am my father one." And
[1:22:42] then Jesus said, "I and them and thee in
[1:22:43] me." God speaks through him. He's no
[1:22:46] more his own, but he's God's voice
[1:22:48] through human lips. Hallelujah. And
[1:22:50] listen, church, every believer in him
[1:22:53] tonight is likewise possessed or filled,
[1:22:56] so completely given over till his words
[1:22:59] become like the words of Christ. Why am
[1:23:02] I reading this? Because every one of us
[1:23:04] face battles and trials every day. And
[1:23:07] God wants you to speak the word of God.
[1:23:10] God wants you to take the word in,
[1:23:12] right? Let the spirit speak through you.
[1:23:14] You're the bride. How many raise your
[1:23:15] hand if you believe you're the bride of
[1:23:16] Christ? I believe I'm the wife of
[1:23:18] Christ. Amen. Hands up. Well, then speak
[1:23:20] it because the Bible said the spirit and
[1:23:22] the bride. Say, "Come." We've got to
[1:23:25] speak the word of God and God's word
[1:23:27] will give us the victory.
[1:23:31] Jesus said, "If you have faith and doubt
[1:23:34] not, and shall not only do I'm sorry, ye
[1:23:37] shall not only do that which is done to
[1:23:38] the fig tree, but also if you shall say
[1:23:40] to this mountain, be thou removed, and
[1:23:42] be thou cast in the sea, it shall be
[1:23:44] done." In all things, whatsoever you
[1:23:46] shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall
[1:23:48] receive. Now, we know this needs balance
[1:23:51] with God only does what his will is.
[1:23:53] People can try to speak, well, I want a
[1:23:55] car or I want a spouse. They can try to
[1:23:56] speak all these things, but you must let
[1:23:58] God lead you on what to speak. We just
[1:24:01] don't speak our fleshly, lustful
[1:24:02] desires.
[1:24:04] Now, I want to finish with this.
[1:24:06] Brother, look how brother prays. I think
[1:24:08] this is my last two. Yeah, I got these
[1:24:10] are my last three here.
[1:24:12] Okay, brother's praying at the end of
[1:24:14] this. Great father, include us, Lord. If
[1:24:17] we've sinned, take it away from us. We
[1:24:18] don't want to be that way, Lord. It's
[1:24:19] not our intention. We realize we're
[1:24:21] living in such a horrible, dark way. And
[1:24:23] as we said at the beginning, we're
[1:24:25] walking up a mountain through rugged
[1:24:26] places, dim as the trail, but we're
[1:24:28] packing the light. Hallelujah.
[1:24:30] May we see step by step step as we go
[1:24:33] now until we meet like the pilgrim's
[1:24:34] progress till we finally catch the top
[1:24:36] of the hill. Guide us, oh shepherd,
[1:24:38] great Jehovah, lead us by thy spirit.
[1:24:41] And we know that we're far from a
[1:24:44] masterpiece. Look at this. Brother Ram's
[1:24:45] not saying, "Well, I got it all figured
[1:24:46] out. Look at me. I'm I'm better than
[1:24:48] everybody else." No. Brother Ram's
[1:24:50] honest. I battle sin just like we all
[1:24:52] battle sin.
[1:24:55] He says we know we're far from a
[1:24:57] masterpiece. So let me give you a clue.
[1:25:00] You and I, we still have a lot of work
[1:25:02] to do on us so we can become
[1:25:04] masterpieces of God. Amen.
[1:25:07] So see the next part is like you got to
[1:25:09] be smitten too. In other words, you got
[1:25:10] to go through trials if you want to be a
[1:25:12] masterpiece, right? And we heard it on
[1:25:14] the radio, right? A case we heard on the
[1:25:15] radio this morning, count it all joy
[1:25:16] when you go through diverse temptations,
[1:25:18] right? I thought, boy, God's talking to
[1:25:19] me through the radio again today. Praise
[1:25:21] God. That's the exact verse that goes
[1:25:23] with this.
[1:25:27] We're looking where we were hewed from.
[1:25:29] Where do we come from? We come from the
[1:25:30] mind of Christ. He's the real
[1:25:32] masterpiece. And in him, we trust. Just
[1:25:35] take us to him, Lord. Grant.
[1:25:38] And church, what are we really groaning
[1:25:39] for? The Bible says when we finally get
[1:25:41] our new body, that's when we'll have no
[1:25:43] more sin. See, we're groaning. How many
[1:25:46] are groaning to be a masterpiece? Oh,
[1:25:48] God. God, I just wish I could do more
[1:25:49] for you. I wish I was better. I wish I
[1:25:51] had more zeal. I wish I had more energy.
[1:25:53] I wish I had more ability to help
[1:25:54] people. The Bible says that's normal.
[1:25:57] That's what we should be doing. We
[1:25:58] should be groaning to be like Christ.
[1:26:01] For we know that of our earth earthly
[1:26:03] house of this tabernacle, we're
[1:26:04] dissolved. We have a building of God and
[1:26:07] house not made with hands eternal in the
[1:26:09] heavens. For in this we groan earnestly
[1:26:12] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[1:26:14] house which is from heaven.
[1:26:18] If so be that being clothed, we shall
[1:26:20] not be found naked. For we that are in
[1:26:23] this tabernacle do groan, being
[1:26:24] burdened, not for that we would be
[1:26:27] unclothed, but clothed upon that
[1:26:29] mortality might be swallowed up in life.
[1:26:32] I just want to live where I don't have
[1:26:34] to worry about sinning. Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] Amen. I just want to live where there's
[1:26:38] no temptation. Hallelujah. Amen. And I
[1:26:41] can just glorify God with my whole life.
[1:26:43] Hallelujah. That's what the Bible said.
[1:26:45] real Christians grown to be a
[1:26:46] masterpiece. The finished masterpiece,
[1:26:51] church, he shall change our vile body.
[1:26:54] See, every every one of us should tap
[1:26:56] our let's tap our arm and say, "I'm
[1:26:58] vile." Ready? I'm vile. All of us are
[1:27:00] vile. The flesh is a vile creature.
[1:27:03] Vile, filthy creature.
[1:27:05] He'll change this vile body that it may
[1:27:07] be fashioned like unto his glorious
[1:27:09] body. according to the working whereby
[1:27:12] he's able even to subdue all things unto
[1:27:14] himself.
[1:27:16] Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and
[1:27:17] it does not appear yet what we shall be,
[1:27:20] but we know that when he shall appear,
[1:27:22] we shall be like him, for we shall see
[1:27:23] him as he is. And every man that hath
[1:27:26] hope in him purifith himself, even as he
[1:27:29] is pure. Let's have all the future
[1:27:32] masterpieces stand to our feet by God's
[1:27:34] grace. Musicians can come.
[1:27:41] We're not masterpieces yet, but we're
[1:27:45] going to get there by the grace of God.
[1:27:47] The best part is we know the real
[1:27:49] masterpiece. Praise God. We know Jesus,
[1:27:53] God's true masterpiece.
[1:27:56] Let me read this uh testimony here. Do
[1:27:58] you remember when I preached on David's
[1:28:00] battle against David with iniquity? A
[1:28:02] brother sent this to me. Uh
[1:28:05] he said, "Last week I was sick. I had
[1:28:07] problems at work and I was fighting with
[1:28:09] myself.
[1:28:12] I felt a very strong urge to listen to
[1:28:15] one of your sermons. I don't listen to
[1:28:17] sermons on the internet almost never.
[1:28:19] He's from Hungary, the nation of
[1:28:20] Hungary. I know some of you are hungry
[1:28:22] right now, too. So, I should not have
[1:28:24] said that. I should should have should I
[1:28:25] should have just said Europe.
[1:28:29] He said, "But it was a very strong and
[1:28:31] convincing leading of the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:33] God led me to turn to the last sermon
[1:28:35] from Bride of Christ Fellowship. The
[1:28:37] leading of God was exact. Brother, I
[1:28:40] want you to know that God was speaking
[1:28:42] to me with every word
[1:28:44] when I preached on iniquity and
[1:28:46] repenting from sins. And I showed the
[1:28:48] three steps. It's just in the Bible. The
[1:28:49] three steps of overcoming iniquity.
[1:28:52] See, church, this is I'm so glad God
[1:28:54] calls us to speak, too. We're not even
[1:28:56] finished masterpieces, but God wants to
[1:28:58] speak through you and I. I love things
[1:29:00] like this. Just little things where the
[1:29:02] whole sermon God was speaking to his
[1:29:05] people. That's how we all want to live
[1:29:07] our lives, right? Where God can use our
[1:29:10] voice to point others back to him.
[1:29:15] He said, "I was weeping and crying and
[1:29:17] God restored the joy of my salvation
[1:29:19] through his word." At the end, I shouted
[1:29:21] praises to God.
[1:29:24] Hallelujah.
[1:29:27] I believe that small encouragements are
[1:29:29] useful and needed. That is the reason I
[1:29:30] write. I hope you don't mind this tiny
[1:29:32] testimony. I like tiny testimonies. I
[1:29:34] like them whether they're big or tiny.
[1:29:38] And he says, "My life was Psalm 66:16.
[1:29:42] Come and hear all you here who fear God.
[1:29:44] Let me tell you what he has done for my
[1:29:46] soul." Amen. Let's bow our heads. If you
[1:29:49] would play that song, you sang it last
[1:29:51] night. M. Okay. Uh
[1:29:54] Calvary. What Calvary song did we sing
[1:29:57] last night?
[1:30:00] wasn't at the cross.
[1:30:03] It's the whole rugged cross. I thought
[1:30:05] that'd be so perfect because that was
[1:30:06] God's masterpiece. That's where I find
[1:30:08] healing for my sorrows. That's where we
[1:30:11] find healing for our bodies, church.
[1:30:13] That's where we find healing for our
[1:30:15] minds. Victory over sin and temptation.
[1:30:18] We find it in the cross of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:22] That sacrifice paid for all our benefits
[1:30:26] today.
[1:30:33] Let's bow our heads here. Father God, we
[1:30:34] thank thank you for today, Lord. Thank
[1:30:36] you for the patience of the people. I'm
[1:30:37] now about an hour, hour and a half,
[1:30:39] Lord. I didn't know I'd go this long,
[1:30:40] but thank you, God, for your patience,
[1:30:41] especially our visitors. Uh my dear,
[1:30:44] precious mother-in-law Tammy and brother
[1:30:46] Gary. We appreciate their patience, Lord
[1:30:48] God.
[1:30:50] Lord, we just can't hardly want to leave
[1:30:52] your presence, Lord God. It's so
[1:30:53] wonderful thinking about Jesus. Thank
[1:30:56] you God for sending your masterpiece.
[1:30:59] So Lord, you could make something
[1:31:01] special out of my vile life. Oh God,
[1:31:05] I know I was vile. I still got a vile
[1:31:07] nature inside of me. But Lord, because
[1:31:10] of your masterpiece, Lord God,
[1:31:13] we purify ourselves today
[1:31:17] and we ask you to forgive our sins. Lord
[1:31:19] God,
[1:31:21] we're going to open up the altar soon
[1:31:23] and open up the prayer line if anyone
[1:31:24] wants to confess their sins and purify
[1:31:26] themselves.
[1:31:29] Maybe someone needs prayer for healing.
[1:31:30] Lord God, we believe your life is here.
[1:31:32] Amen. The life is in the seed.
[1:31:34] Hallelujah. The life is in the word,
[1:31:36] Lord God. You've moved on
[1:31:38] and you're revealing more and more truth
[1:31:40] today.
[1:31:42] The life of Jesus Christ. Thank you for
[1:31:45] such a wonderful masterpiece out of the
[1:31:47] book of Mark, out of the book of Isaiah
[1:31:49] 53. Lord God,
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:55] Lord, you were wounded for Jesse Smith's
[1:31:57] transgressions.
[1:31:59] You were bruised for Jesse Smith's
[1:32:01] iniquities. The chastisement
[1:32:04] of Jesse Smith's peace was upon him. But
[1:32:07] with Jesus's stripes, Jesse Smith is
[1:32:10] healed. Lord, Brother Ram told us, each
[1:32:12] one of us to put our names in that
[1:32:14] verse, Isaiah 53:5. Thank you, God, that
[1:32:18] you've healed us. Thank you, Lord God,
[1:32:22] for the masterpiece of Christ. We'll
[1:32:25] sing about it for a thousand years on
[1:32:26] earth and then all eternity in the new
[1:32:29] Jerusalem, Lord God. Oh, thank you, Lord
[1:32:32] God. How we cherish the old rugged cross
[1:32:34] today, Lord God. Purify our hearts, Lord
[1:32:36] God.
[1:32:38] Thank you, Lord, for showing us the
[1:32:40] life,
[1:32:42] the life of the Holy Spirit working its
[1:32:45] way through these last 2,000 years. And
[1:32:48] we're thankful we can be gathered around
[1:32:50] the seed today,
[1:32:52] God. And we're not making ourselves
[1:32:53] better than anybody. As brother said,
[1:32:56] we're not masterpieces of ourselves.
[1:32:58] Only Jesus is really the true
[1:33:00] masterpiece.
[1:33:01] But Lord, you've just revealed more
[1:33:02] truth as you prophesied. I will restore
[1:33:05] in the book of Joel. I will restore,
[1:33:07] sayeth the Lord. And Lord, that's what
[1:33:09] you've done today. You've restored the
[1:33:11] revelation of your word.
[1:33:14] We know tongues aren't the evidence. We
[1:33:16] know we got to live a sanctified life.
[1:33:19] Hallelujah.
[1:33:20] We got to live above sin. Hallelujah.
[1:33:22] Thank you, Jesus, for your grace and
[1:33:24] mercy, Lord God. We shouldn't smoke and
[1:33:27] drink and cuss,
[1:33:29] dress immoral, Lord God.
[1:33:32] We shouldn't gossip, Lord God.
[1:33:36] shouldn't be greedy.
[1:33:38] Oh God, thank you for your amazing
[1:33:40] grace. Lord God,
[1:33:43] change our lives, God. I pray, Lord,
[1:33:45] every heart, Lord, would purify itself
[1:33:47] today, Lord. If they're anything like
[1:33:49] me, they battled sin last night or
[1:33:51] battled sin yesterday morning or last
[1:33:53] week. Lord, perhaps this morning, some
[1:33:55] people battled sin. Oh God, may they
[1:33:57] confess it, Lord God.
[1:34:00] Hallelujah, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:02] and may the people be purified by the
[1:34:04] washing of the waters of the word.
[1:34:08] I ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[1:34:10] name. And the saints said we're going to
[1:34:12] sing that. If you want to pray at the
[1:34:13] altar, you can. If you want to have come
[1:34:15] in the prayer line,
