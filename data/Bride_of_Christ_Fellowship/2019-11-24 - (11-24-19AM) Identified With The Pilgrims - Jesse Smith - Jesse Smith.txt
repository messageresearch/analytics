everybody the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise God good be in the house Lord today praise God before I forget brother Greg I like to just give you my card here and case you ever need to pray for me prayer requests and then here's a free copy of my book by God's grace yes sir you know sometimes we we always love our visitors but sometimes they have to leave before I get a chance to talk to them so but I'll get chance to talk to you that's my contact information there by God's grace so proverbs 14 verse 33 I probably preach out on both today right I think so okay just that the batteries run out okay looks like the battery's pretty good proverbs 14 33 praise God I don't every year preach you know like a Easter message or a Thanksgiving message or a Christmas message but I'm gonna preach a Thanksgiving message today praise God proverbs 14 just you know seeing the inspiration you know the books have been reading lately I've been reading this book by Derek Prince he was a Pentecostal guy he passed away though but it's basically just like a Bible study about prayer and fasting and how prayer and fasting shaped the history of the Jews and America and it's really quite quite inspirational I'm really enjoying it I'm almost done with it it's been a wonderful book if you want to read after me let me know I'll give you this coffee it's a great book and I recommend it to anybody but a reading about you know the pilgrims and you know the early American fathers the the role that prayer and fasting prayed or played in their lives and the founding of this country it's pretty astounding but it just proves to us that God's Word is true God's Word is a reality and anyone that takes God at his word he will reward them he's early warder of them that diligently seek Him proverbs 14 33 wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding but that which is in the midst of fools is made known now let's read verse 34 together one two three righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer never need on your heart just making known unto the Lord here how many father again we're happy to be in your house there's nowhere else we'd rather be Lord then showing Lord the world showing our friends our family and even you your angels which side we're on we're on the Lord's side Lord it's a privilege to be in your house Lord and we never want to lose our reverence for your house your prophet said it's like coming Lord to a courthouse because the Bible said judgment begins at the house of God and so we come here reverently softly Lord examining our lives our motives our objectives we come reverently Lord just use your word to cut out any unbelief in our hearts Lord God and Lord may we use the word to drive back Satan and his devils or try to attempt us and attack us and put disease is on ass Lord we just come against him in the name of Jesus Christ with the sword of the word dear God thank you Lord for sharing this sword with us may we use it lord have faith in it Lord just blessed us here in your divine presence in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise God so I'll be taking some inspiration from a couple of quotes brother Greg do you know about William Branham okay praise Oh looks like you both did but you know sometimes the visitors come in and you know they don't hear about brother Branham you never know you know sometimes we've had visitors in the past from Apostolic churches you know that they don't recognize your brother Branham as a prophet but yet they have a holy appearance you know and they try to live right it's been a couple years since we've had those but we're very thankful that you've heard about brother Branham praise God thank the Lord praise the Lord it's been I wasn't just you know I wasn't raised in around the message I was raised in a Pentecostal Trinitarian church that did not believe in holiness but then my brother Simon met with some message believers in 2001 and that's when I received the message in 2001 so it's almost been almost been 19 years by God's grace so thankful to Lord and we've been here about thirteen and a half years preaching the gospel so we're thankful for God's love and we're thankful for this message praise God amen which is ba bamp says is the Word of God that God is vindicating today praise God that's the message the Word of God God is manifesting today praise God I'd like to preach on this thought I think the I think the thought I had on there was identified with the pilgrims that's my title for today by God's grace because I just want to take a few thoughts from brother Branham out of the masterpiece and then go out go through some history here and I know it'll be a real blessing to you and I know you'll be encouraged it's a it's a sermon you know that when we look at the the pilgrims it brings a lot of humility to us and I'm hoping this will give us you know humility and and Thanksgiving today praise God so that when we sit down at the table on Thursday that we can truly give thanks and really be thankful not and yes for the natural things but also for the spiritual food that we've received in this day because we're in a season of great you know the Bible said great famine around the world for the Word of God you know though they'll travel denominations will travel you know the charismatic movement people will travel around the world seeking for the the word of the Lord and no doubt some of them have gifts of prophecy right some of them can prophesy and say thus saith the Lord but but but as a but but as a word for the age we've already received thus say at the Lord and we are not in a famine we're feasting on the Word of God and so we've got to make sure that we're feeding more on the spiritual word and the spiritual food so that we don't get deceived by the natural food and the natural blessings in other words we got to stay more strong spiritually and not get deceived and complacent in the natural right because of all the natural blessings in America and of course around the world because it goes forth around the world so I like to look at this I want to take a few scriptures here now this is a very famous scripture of course for United States of America for righteousness has exalted the United States of America because our founders and beginning with the pilgrims founded this nation they founded it in righteousness and that's what we want to show today and because of that God has raised up America as the greatest nation perhaps ever perhaps ever and the reason I say that is because of number wise number wise our nation is greater than any nation Israel ever was right how many do we have I think it's almost 500 million in this nation they're not mistaken and and while Israel was great don't get me wrong there was a great you know David and Solomon and great and of God but the one thing that we've got different is we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God we've got the blood of Jesus Christ that just doesn't cover over sins but completely abolish is the sin praise God and sends them away like the bleach of the blood amen driving away all the ink of stains and blood and so that's why we say it's the greatest nation because it was founded of course in a later age when the Holy Ghost was available when the blood of Jesus Christ was in effect in power and he's sitting as high priest upon the right hand of the Majesty on high praise God and I think that's why God has blessed it more than any other nation praise God now I want to read a little quote like I said I guess it's not a little one I guess it's a long one but I think I said go on I think you'll enjoy it I do apologize it wasn't masterpiece it's mighty God unveiled before us June 29th or you'll be familiar as I begin the quote but Ram's talks about how we're identified in everything God has done anything God has ever done throughout all time we were identified in it and I think a word that made you you and I may be more familiar with is associated that word kind of makes a little more maybe sense to me hopefully to you or whichever one works for you the word associate means connected related or linked praise God so you and I we are all related to everything God does we are all connected to it right because as we said earlier God is our Heavenly Father we are his children and like the scripture says a man Isaac we're talking about this he is God of both the dead and the living praise God he's the God of all he owns all because he created all and then he he paid for all the sins of all as well amen with one sacrifice for all praise God hallelujah and so I want to read this quote beginning in paragraph 176 he said we're identified with him in acts 2 we're identify with them with the same autism the same thing water and spirit all he was then and all he is all he was and all he is we are that's exactly it just like if I wanted to be a true American I got to be identified with everything she was and everything she is I've got to be identified with it if I'm a true American if I am a true American then I landed on Plymouth Rock we're look at that today with the Pilgrim Fathers on Plymouth Rock when they landed out there I was with them so was you everybody so all Americans were with the pilgrims when they landed on Plymouth Rock now of course you night we don't know we don't mean physically right we were not with them physically because bourbon tells us and who is his melchizedek he tells us the order of our manifest station we started out in the mind of God as a thought we went from thought he said to flesh body so my flesh body was born in 1980 I could not have been there in 16 whatever it was when they landed I think 16 20 if I'm not mistaken so I wasn't there physically but brothers were there by association by connection were associated with it after you became flesh body but man said after you leave this realm you take on your theophany and then after the theophany when the rapture comes then you get your glorified body and that's your final manifestation amen how they live as far as I know praise God that's what he taught us in who's this know Kecak but Jesus came different Jesus came from thought to theophany which the man said was that pillar of fire when there was nothing and there was just blackness out of that blackness and space came forth a pillar of fire he said that was the son that lo Goss Amen so went from invisible thought to theophany then Jesus came to flesh and then from flesh the glorified praise God so you and I physically weren't there right you know III I'd even say I don't even know if your soul was there I mean if God was there you were there in his thoughts I guess you know so somehow you were there we just say you were there and God's being I'll say like that or God's thoughts but I'm not like a fanatic like some people say while I was actually there no I don't can't see that because we go from thought to flesh our theophanies the by the Bible never said alpha knees float down around here the Bible said that theophanies are in heaven right now Paul said that the Alpha knees are eternal in the heavens waiting Paul said that bodies waiting there for me when this body of flesh drops I'll go to meet the theophany so there's we're not fanatics like that he said I rode with Paul Revere right down the road to warn her of danger that's right he says right down there at Valley Forge I crossed the icy Delaware with a bunch of soldiers who half of them didn't have shoes on I prayed all night with George Washington oh my god help us to pray amen sincerely I crossed the Delaware with a vision in my heart we are American yes sir Valley Forge I certainly did I returned thanks with the original Thanksgiving father's praise God if I'm a real American I was then if I'd there at that table what about the table that God gives us amen hallelujah there's a table now where the saints of God are fed praise God but there's also the marriage supper the land table amen hallelujah we know we'll be there by God's grace he said if I'm a real American I was identified when I stood with Stonewall Jackson I don't remember that part of history although I think was Civil War if I'm a real American I was defied at the Boston Tea Party yes sir when we refused to have things pulled over our eyes well I'm as real America he said I'm as real America I was identified there with that yes sir I rang the Liberty Bell the first fourth of July in 1776 I rang the Liberty Bell here and declared that we are independent to be a real American I had to I was identified with her shame he says in the Revolutionary when brother fought against brother I think he means Civil War but I could be wrong I've got to bear her shame the shame as I have to bear her glory if I'm an American I have to be as identified with her I was identified at Gettysburg down there when Lincoln made his speech I was on Wake Island over them bloody soldiers bodies I rose on Wake Island on Guam I helped hice the flag I'm a real American all she is I am and proud of it yes indeed all America's men all she is I'm still that to be America a part of this country Turks yes am i proud of their sin absolutely not but I'm proud of the blessings I'm proud of the father's now not in a prideful way but I'm thankful for the founding fathers and the seeds they planted and the fruits that were enjoying because of their obedience the bear said I'm proud to be American he says same thing he said everything she was I have to be because I'm identified with her same thing by being a true Christian you have to be identified with it I preached with Moses I'm sorry I said I preached with Noah and warned the people of the oncoming judgment to be a real Christian I was with Moses at the burning bush thank God I saw his glory I was there with Moses up there in the wilderness to be a Christian I have to be identified with everything God was to be a Christian I seen his glory I heard his voice don't try to explain away from me now because I was there I know what I'm talking about I see what happened yes sir now I wonder if he's breaking into a spiritual realm here because he's a he's a prophet maybe he was talking about visions he'd seen it seems awfully like this seems like he's breaking into vision perhaps because we know the order the order we our physical bodies weren't there nor were our theophanies so the only way we could have been there was in part of God we were part of God he said I was at the Red Sea when I seen the Spirit of God moved down and parked the water from one side not through a bunch of reeds that they're trying to say today but through a 90-foot sea I seen the Spirit of God I walk with Moses through that dry ground across that Red Sea I stood by Mount Sinai and seen the thunder lightning falling I ate manna with them out there I drank from that rock I'm still doing it tonight amen did you know that rock is still pouring forth water tonight amen the eternal rock the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ amen I was identified with the manna eaters I was identified with him that drunk from the rock I was also identified when Joshua blew a trumpet and the walls of Jericho fell down I was in the lines they would Daniel I was in the fiery furnace with the Hebrew children I was with Elijah on Mount Carmel I was with John the Baptist before them critics I seen the Spirit of God descending I heard the voice of God say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased yes sir I was identified with them I was identified there at the grave of Lazarus when he raised up Lazarus I was identified with the woman at the well when he told her her sins yes sir I surely was identified with him in his death and I was identified on the first Easter I raised with him from death I'm identified with him in his death glory I was with 120 in the upper room I was identified up there with them he said hey I feel religious I was identified there I'm one of them I was identified I got the same experience they had I was there when it happened to be a true Christian so we're talking about the same experience as far as feeling the same and then here's what I want to say it's we're feeling the same holy spirit amen see we go through our difficult trials of life and when we go through different trials who is it that shows up it's the same God that showed up for Noah and Moses and Daniel in the Hebrew children and and Paul and Silas the same guy that showed up for them is the same guy that shows up for us amen so see we're identified we knew we could get an understanding what it's like praise God when we see America and God heals somebody from something that should have died up you know we can say my it's just like being there when Goliath fell down amen I know what it's like to defeated Goliath because we prayed and we've seen God do great things that deliver people from sin and disease and sickness and save them from the grave so we know it's like there when David met Goliath and he fell because we see Giants falling around us ain't no glory I witness the mighty rushing wind come in I felt the power of God as it shook I was with them their spoken tongues I felt the anointing come in there I was with them I was identified with them when the Holy Ghost began to speak through tongues with them I was with Peter before the critics in acts 2 when he preached the great sermon that he did yes sir in acts 4 when they assembled together I was with them when the building shook after prayer meeting the building ship where they were sitting I was identified there with them I preached with Paul on Mars Hill in acts 17 ha ha there's a bunch of unbelievers there and they're God's to everyone but brother man was right there preaching with Paul he stood there against all the the false gods and all the false religions he stood there declaring that there's one unknown God you don't know but I'm gonna let you know his name it's Jesus Christ a man and that he's not unknown now he's known to you and now you're accountable believe and you shall be saved amen save yourself from this untoward generation praise God I was with John on the Isle of Patmos and seen as coming in the book of Revelation I was with Wesley that firebrand snatch from the fires that great revolt against the Anglican Church I was there with him and Here I am tonight 1964 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania identified with that same kind of group with the same kind of experience I must be to be a Christian he says I must stay identify where the Word of God is being manifested I'm identified with a group that feels the Spirit of God I'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled and that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever that knows that this is not fanaticism it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group here tonight yet they're called a bunch of heretics a bunch of fanatics and a on account of the Word of God but I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ first the power of God and a Salvation and I'm one I'm with them living epistles I spoke of vindicated God veiled in human form in men and women all right so he's talking about the unveiling of God praise the Lord and how God had a veil in every age praise God now as you just don't forget this though as we talked about the New Testament is different because God veils behind the TWiT I'm sorry God they´ll I'm sorry God dwells behind the veil of human flesh permanently since Pentecost before Pentecost you know God would anoint Moses and then the Spirit would leave and then he you know strike the rock instead of speak to and God say you're not going over the promised land he would anoint David he'd slay Goliath but then the anointing will leave right from his human spirit and then David would take a Bathsheba commit adultery but see that problem of the temporal temporary noin ting was solved when Jesus Christ blood forgave our sins and now the Spirit of God has access to the soul of man and now the soul can receive the eternal seal praise God and now we're sealed not to the next revival or not to the next disgrace where we fall into this or well know that we're sealed to the day of Redemption praise God that's the difference before the Old Testament he was veiled temporarily but church thank God we had nothing to worry about no matter what comes with the squeeze no matter what comes upon this nation we have nothing to worry about if we're born again we've got the permanent Living God permanent dwelling behind the veil of this flash amen and in their hour when we're tempted or that hour when we have to choose life or death if we have to go that way no matter which way it goes we have confidence that jesus said don't worry don't plan ahead what you'll say but the spirit of my father will give you what to say in that hour because it's not temporary it's permanent glory he said I'm with them living epistles vindicated God veiled in human form in men and women last paragraph of this quote God in His amor fate again veiled himself and made himself known to his people the great king who laid aside I'm sorry laid aside his glory yet a little while and the world won't see me no more I'll be veiled to them but ye shall see me probably with you even in you all the way to the consummation changing like Bowie says changing from Luther to Wesley to on and on from glory unto glory I'm still the same God that lived and going back to the original glory hallelujah oh thank the Lord amen so God has always been veiled behind men women that were following the word of the hour occasion to switch over here I just got I just got a couple pictures I'm not going to show too much today I'll probably it to the other ones later on Wednesday we'll probably look at like the founding fathers you know like George Washington and James Madison and John John Adams and everything like that but today you know Lord willing Lord willing on Wednesday we'll look at you know how George Washington and John Adams and James Madison would fast and pray these were not pushovers these were men that were atheist like or agnostics like they tell you these were men that they in our early nation our early fathers they voted and paid Congress or the Congress voted and they've the first book they ever printed on this land was the Bible a man they spent thousand dollars the first printing press ever did was 10,000 Bibles for the American schools amen that's what were founded upon a man how do you and I was there when they printed a brother oh yeah not physically but I was part of God's Spirit amen glory now let's take a moment here and look at some pilgrim history by God's grace now like I said there's a lot in here and then there's a documentary' if you want to write it down it's by Kirk Cameron he did dock you marry a few years ago called monumental it's a it's a great one now just so you know there's a little bit of rock and roll riffs in there you know like when they transition from one thought to the next they'll put rock and roll or a rap and I'm like come on my goodness but I bought it anyway because it's so rich in American history of course I don't I don't enjoy those parts of it but so I'm getting a lot of my thoughts from that documentary and then also from this book because this man he was invited to speak at the what was it the 300 yeah the 350th anniversary of the landing of the pilgrims on Plymouth Rock this preacher was asked to preach and so he read numerous books by William Bradford and then other journals from the men and women who were actually there at the first establishment the colonization there and so I want to look at some history here like I said let's ask the Lord may God God help us to be thankful today praise God and help us to see that where we would have been with them had we been alive in that day you were there in one sense but if you would have been there in the flesh you'd been right with them that's right now let me here uh a few because last week our last Sunday I was kind of struggling with to remember the word the word I couldn't remember was Puritan I kept saying pilgrim and separate to vist but I'll try to clarify that today now governor Bradford he was the first governor of the new colony after the Mayflower landed and the Pilgrims set up their first government it was the the document they used was the Mayflower Compact I'm sure you've maybe read about that in history but let's go back before that while he lived in England or maybe it was Holland that part I don't know because the pilgrims had to move a little bit because of persecution at 12 years old William Bradford became given his life over to the Lord he started reading the Bible studying it and he grew to be a real good man keeping the scriptures and let me just skip ahead here yeah I'm sorry I'm on the wrong page here we go yeah he was born at York Shire in the early spring of 1590 at 12 years old he became a constant reader of the Bible maokai is 12 so here you go son good good place to look for inspiration right here as a lad he was so moved by the word he joined a group of Puritans who met for prayer and discussion at the house of William Brewster in a nearby village and when he finally decided to join that church in 1606 he joined at it at the wrath of his uncles and the scoff of his neighbors because remember during this time it was Queen Elizabeth and I remember her it was King James yet but it was almost - King James but they were a part of the established church system in fact this was the end of the Thyatira beginning of the Sardis Church age so that tells you how dark it was Thyatira was the darkest age there's ever been but restless the darkest we're in the most deceptive age but that was the darkest age because they didn't have access to God's Word they had to be led by the Holy Spirit and traditions and passed down so this is the age that we're living in and and they started printing Bibles and and and they smuggled on now if you got caught with one you word that you were dead it was life or death they started printing in my briefs soon they got out of most of people and you had a group of people that call themselves Puritans and they elected or they were trying to stay within the denomination glory and they were trying to change the denomination from the inside and so that's what he joined up with first because that was the move of the day but pretty soon they realized they were not going to change it from the inside because Moran said every every every revival dies when they read that when the leader dies the revival dies because they denominator round his word and they fail to see the Holy Spirit moving on oh my so they scoff at him but his life revolved around that of his church and congregation and so then after that there became another group out of the Puritans came another group because the Puritans were trying to they were trying to correct the Pentecostal church can I say like that I remember brother have said member and when's the end time brother and prophesy and he said thus saith the Lord he said every denomination will take the mark of the beast thus saith the Lord he said they'll never come back to the Apostolic teaching he said see if it isn't right write it down your Bible that's thus saith the Lord and here we are fifty five years later and that one denomination has never gone back why because he knew God our God showed him as a prophet that that's the way of death and revival the only way to be revived is to come out of her my people praise God it should be not partakers of her sins and her plagues praise God and so he said it would thus saith the Lord stands still to this day praise God hallelujah so there became two groups now now you got the Puritans and Queen Elizabeth made that word like a cuss word it was so dirty because they would arrest the Puritans and they it pretty certainly got illegal because the government had power of church over state the state the Queen and King would tell the preachers what to preach right and that's where we're getting to my brother and said that's what the squeeze is all about the state and church unite in the United States and they change the laws and they're going to bring a boycott against Bride of Christ fellowship if the Lord tarries right that's Macy when it comes back to it's coming back to that but I REM taught that plainly right and spoken words original see look away to jesus 63 he taught that plainly that's how the boycott in the church age book that's how the boycotts going to come about the churches have to rally around the government and I showed you that video last week 28 religious leaders met with the President Trump and they say and they all say we've never seen such agreement with churches and the government they're gonna see more though don't let's not forget about that they're gonna see more but see not from us we're not going to unite to the government we're uniting with the word praise God do we pray for the government yes I believe it's a sin not to pray for the government because Paul said in first Timothy 2 he said first of all make prayers and supplications for all men and then make prayers for the leaders I mean it's a sin not to pray for the government praise God so so he has to make it stay with the Puritans or do I separate myself from them and so you know what he chose he chose to separate himself from the Puritans they and later church after they were called separatists after they were called separatists then they needed a word to call themselves that's when they came up with the word pilgrim because the Bible said we are pilgrims and strangers and see Church they're running from Queen Elizabeth now they're running from the cops and they're running from the police department and history says they had to hide out brother amen there was like a hundred of them no 200 of them and they would have to hide out in the biggest homes possible and they would have night meetings they couldn't meet during the day because the cops would see him and so their children were the lookouts at nighttime they'd have the older children out there and watching in spite you know looking for any spies going on and then once they thought it was clear all the children would come back in and they'd have worship by candlelight that was in England but the pressure kept mounting see God was pushing them out of their glory God was pushing those Eagles those comfortable Eagles God was stirring the nest amen I know aren't you glad God started your nest one day praise God and push you out of your comfortable state and and you're comfortable denomination aren't you glad God did that amen you had to stay us up and get us to be able to spread our wings and fly upon the winds of faith amen glory so see God allows in his wisdom he allows all these political pressures and church pressures and crazy-ass Co pressures and it's pushing us to do God's will see it says the Puritan who is part of the church was a nationalist believing that a Christian nation is a Christian Church we got a lot of people like that today there's a lot of people still denominations that say oh we need we're a Christian country no we're not anymore you better read revelation 13 if you think we're a Christian nation start at verse 11 where to beasts that rise up out of the sea and where does it get its power not from heaven it gets its power from the Beast that was before it which was pagan Rome it started out as a Christian nation but it's no longer anymore see so we're not we're not nationalists we're Christians praise God amen but the pilgrim was a separatist or separatist sorry keep saying that run separatist now only from the Anglican prayer book and Queen Elizabeth's Apocrypha but from all national churches the pilgrim wanted Liberty for himself and his wife and his little ones and for the Brethren to walk with God in a Christian life as the rules and motives of such were revealed to him from God's Word see the Bible was like a fresh thing brother William it was like new wow this is hot off the presses and this is an important thing and this is very special and they're in the mayonnaise amen ah they're in the mayonnaise they don't really they don't have the eagle revelation yeah but yet they know there's more ha ha ha ha there's more like when you when I was in nomination I knew there was more I didn't know where it was but I was going deeper and up you know Baptists and deeper into more doctrine and then I found the message and I found with the more that I was looking for praise God so where the pier the pilgrims here they always knew they was there was more to God's Word and so this history says the difference between the Puritans in the established church and the pilgrims was two different words and brother Graham uses them to the one word for the Puritans was Reformation which Martin Luther the Reformation but even history says his word was not restoration as our Reformation his word was restorations are you and that's what we have the restoration of the broad tree based on a man jesus said I'll restore I'm sorry no Joel said I'll restore all the years of the caterpillar and the Palmer worm and the cankerworm amen my great army which I sent him on you praise God they're wired their keyword was restoration they one of the original church they believe the ultimate purpose of God was to restore the church to its original condition as portrayed in the New Testament ah a memorizer program said thus saith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride so see brother brothers he had he had that desire the Spirit of Christ was guiding him was guiding the pilgrims to complete restoration they wouldn't let you see it when I sure hope we do praise God amen I sure we're gonna see it when the bread comes back to being the full bride she was at Pentecost glory that's the prophecy for the end time it's done saith the Lord brother Branham said Joel to 23:26 so the pilgrims had a vision of not Reformation restoration Wow look at that church there in the there in the the age of Reformation but their vision goes beyond that to restoration talk about advance you put kids in the advanced classes at school these guys were spiritually advanced they're living in the age of Reformation but God has already given them a vision for restoration maja mercy Lord so that's what they did they joined themselves by covent and they tried to as near the primitive original pattern of the first churches as the others all right now let me read a little bit of the history real quick here a little more so this was a time where to have a Bible it was a league almost in many places so out of the Puritans came separatists which later call themselves pilgrims now let me share something with you too when I first heard the message in 2001 brother Greg I was so part of it like a megachurch we call an Akron okay and they were talking with me I was trying to you know starting to realize I got to come out of here and I was saying you know I say Pastor Mike I said I don't want to go to the movies anymore they cost they swear they show naked women and I shouldn't go to that and he's like you don't want to be a separatist he said because then you lose track and lose touch with the world and they can't relate to you and that has always stuck with me that was back in 2001 or 2002 he said you don't want to be a separatist he used that exact word and that's exactly what he was he said we've got to be separate from the things of the world amen so see that proves that their church and other churches like that they're going for Reformation in senator from restoration amen but we are going for full restoration that never left me I always thought why do you tell me you're being a separatist he must have been reading must been around Thanksgiving time or something like that he must been reading about it and maybe criticizing these guys I don't know but the Bible says the Bible says you must separate yourself from all unbelief praise God the Bible says in the fear of God cleanse yourself from all filthiness of flesh and spirit praise God amen the Bible teaches a complete separation from the things of the world hallelujah so they met for four years but they met for years they met there in England in the biggest houses there was about 200 of them and only met at nighttime because they get arrested during the day the children would look out then they run it okay time to have Church okay let's get the song lead off there let's start singing of raise the heart there's there's more this word can you imagine the first Bibles huh let's read the book of Job for the first time oh my let's read the book of the gospel of market and mine they were so hungry for the things of God amen we should be hungry for the things of God hallelujah so they give himself this name pilgrims well they got to the point where the pressure was so great they had to leave so they made a decision after four years we're gonna go to this country of Holland which is southeast of England and you might heard his story so they paid a boat master but they didn't know what he was going to betray them so all 200 of them go out to this boat at nighttime to get this boat and what already happened the boat guy had already betrayed them and brought the cops in and when he brought him in all the women had their money and everything they sold everything they were moving they had it hid it under their skirts and is a very very big embarrassment and so the police stripped down the women and got right in front of everybody there's two hundred of the pilgrims there and they stripped him down got the money all their possessions let him get their clothes back on and they took him out of prison that was their first attempt but Church let me tell you this they didn't give up amen in the midst of embarrassment in the midst of a rest in the midst of prison they didn't give up I don't know how long it was but they did it again they hired another guy but this time they divided up they divided up the group they had men and women go I'm sorry men go one way women and children go another way and during this time they got on two boats but this time there's a storm and thus there was a great storm now the women and children got caught they went back to jail and they didn't get you then he get the hon for one year later to one year later but the men got in this vote the other one stayed there because they got caught the boat said about it was Oh too weak storm out on the ocean and they were gonna that all these ships the history said a hundred ships sank out on the ocean but this little sliver of message believers amen this little fanatical little this little flock out there on the ocean waters amen everybody else is sinking there and they're praying for two weeks God stopped the storm and it was so bad it stored for two weeks straight didn't even know where they were and they just kept praying Cape Cod praying all of a sudden the storm broke and they could see where they were going and they sailed to Holland and started a new life there and the men had to write back and so forth send money to get the women there and finally a year later they're all families are all United again he imagines Satan saying look even believe this is of God and your wife and children you're not only have your wife and children you got arrested twice but they knew they knew they were standing on God's Word Hey and though the way be stormy I'll praise the Lord though the way be thorny no matter how hard the road is it was just the tasks praise God because they couldn't worship God in the old system in Reformation they knew a restoration praise God so as God's Spirit guiding them out of this that was churches and he was guiding them out to follow Christian Liberty amen oh yes so that was the first miracle it should have sank hundred ships sank but not that one because that had some predestinated seeds in it he was one of them amen glory now they got a pastor there they were God raised up a pastor named John Robinson in Holland and they say they're burly men for 12 years once they got their families they stay there for 12 years building them up in the faith this was a new book they didn't understand everything so you know pastor there he started studying it for 12 years and they barely struggled to get by in the natural sea because they're from a different they were a part of the Guild's they weren't a part of the unions kinda say like that they weren't in the unions and because of their beliefs they weren't allowed to join them they were kept out now now what's amazing is that that storm helped direct them to Holland and Holland was the only nation in the world at that time that didn't have a murderous tyrant leader every other leader in the world would have killed those predestinated seeds amen but God had to send them to a place where his predestinated seeds could be preserved amen because God knows how to preserve this word amen hallelujah so he said it too the only place they could go Holland god bless Holland a man 12 years the pastor trained him up and it was a hard life naturally but it was glorious spiritually because they for the first time in their lives whether Greg they have to worry about something not going to notice it what do you guys thinking about in there I'm pulling you off to jail what are you reading in there they were free as well they were free to praise the Lord and worship and love God although it was hard on the children the children had to go to work because just like today companies will hire children because they'll have to pay him taxes right not to pay taxes on earth to report it which is illegal but they had no their choice for 12 years their children labored and worked for the adults how could this be the plan of God what do you mean I'm a man I can't even work but yet it was the plan of God what did it take it took a lot of humility in church you know God's gonna reward those children one day for all their great work they the history says they barely had enough food but the children with and that's how they got their food was through the labors of the children for 12 years but they were free in the spirit um so guess what they did in their church they set up a modern-day internet in other words they set up a print press because they had the message but they couldn't just hope to themselves they had to get it out praise God they had to get it out so they built themselves their own printing press and distributed I think a thousand books before it finally word got back all the way back up to England what they were doing and English came down and shut him down they destroyed they burn up their house they burnt the printing press destroyed it all and now at this point they've been hearing about the new land and after 12 years they destroyed the printing press they took away their their right to their opportunity to print the Bible they sent books all over England and Scotland but that was the end of their printing ministry at least till they got to America and could print some more Bibles amen now they realized we are we have to we have to leave Holland they can't they felt like they couldn't go back to England and so they got two boats we all know the Mayflower right but they actually got to the second one was called the Speedwell and like what the guy said he said it wasn't speeding and it wasn't well half of the pilgrims got on the Speedwell half of them got on the Mayflower and off they went but a leak sprang in the Speedwell and it had to turn around and go back and both ships went back here because the other one had to provide for the needs of the other and they had to make a decision they're not really got one boat which one or what do we do do we all go give up and go back to England well they prayed and they felt led we're gonna split up we're gonna half we're gonna stay here go back to England to get established and just try to do all they can do and then the other group said we're gonna go across and where he said we're in the wilderness see because they were they were they were imagining themselves as an exodus lorry solely amen we're not taking a nap truck sis we're taking a supernatural Exodus amen over this earth into that seven dimension praise God in the presence of Jesus Christ himself amen but they were understood we're in excess we had to come out of the church Egypt and now they said we've got to wonder through the wilderness of this ocean in order they reach our desks our promised land hey with the message of the hour praise God because member I'm not in read all of it but they knew there was more than Luther they'd received Luther's message it was age they received that but they knew there was more to it than that they didn't want to just stay in Luther's teaching his Luther and passed away Luther passed away they don't as they knew the church was corrupt right the church would get corrupt would no matter where it was and so they wanted to start a new thing by the grace of the Lord now that Speedwell cracked they both came back the pastor John Robinson stayed with them to go back to England to Shepherd their souls that's that's interesting he decided to stay with the other ones to go back to England and try to survive the Mayflower takes half of them back now before they before they left let me read this here yeah I actually brought this before they even left Holland yeah well that's Holland we're here on the Mayflower to go william bradford writes this being ready to depart they had a day of solemn humiliation their pastor john robinson took his text from ezra 821 and i read that a few weeks ago I don't remember that or not and they're by the river by Ahava I proclaimed a fast that we might humble ourselves before our God and seek of him a right way for us and for our children and for our substance praise God so before they jumped on the Mayflower they got their inspiration from Ezra and Ezra was getting his and his inspiration was do I leave Babylon and go back to the promised land and try to reestablish restore worship and that's what he decided we're gonna pray and fast here by the river Ahava and let's see if God will take us back to begin restoration praise God amen and you know what happened God did God bless them God took Ezra back and Nehemiah and zubaba God to come back and help restore the worship praise God amen and so the pilgrims took their inspiration from that but we a fast and pray to see if God would have a do this and God answered and they felt led to go across the ocean so they spent an entire day church just praying and offering up prayers to God God should we go God do we get on this Mayflower you know the other one broke down God what do we do God and they prayed and said I won't eat any food because I'm eating God's Word oh let's find somebody that's sincere thanks God you're more interested in eating God's food than man's food where do we come from church we came from godly men like this who fasted and prayed and believed the Bible was the message of the hour bunch of small little holy rollers praise God finally they rejected few the little flock that's where we came from praise God that's right now here's what the last address pastor Robinson gave he said for he was very confident the Lord had more truth and light yet to break forth out of his Holy Word they knew there was more truth to be revealed out of the Word of God so he took occasion also miserably to bewail the state and condition of the Reformed churches who were come to a period a standstill and religion and would go no further than the instruments of their Reformation or their leaders of the Reformation ah they knew it they said we're not going to stay a part of the established churches we're not going to be just be part of the Reformation we've got to establish the restoration of the true Church of God he said the Lutheran's could not be drawn to go beyond what Luther saw he said the Calvinists he said cannot be drawn to go beyond what Calvin saw he said but we are ready and willing to embrace further light praise God amen thank the Lord amen hallelujah that's what God is sent in this day brothers message is a further I I'll say like this is final night to this age Amen how they do because my dad said his ministry was the last sign thus saith the Lord is the last sign to the Gentiles before the destruction it's the last light and that this message is actually where they decide to be called pilgrims I'm sorry so I said little early after this after John Robinson's message about embracing further light they said we're pilgrims praise God because they were all on a pilgrimage looking for the further revelation of truth that lay ahead as they walk in obedience to truth they already received Amen oh thank the Lord praise God so they prayed and prayed and prayed and they felt led to go after the day of prayer and fasting they got on there now most you know most you know this the trip over from England to North America was only a three-week journey during the good season but they left there September October November the worst time to sail on the ocean so their three-week journey 21 days turned into eight week journey and get this it was 66 days and there's 66 books in the Bible they had to endure all 66 ah that's the very reason they were handing over their praise God which for the sake of living in liberty and obedience that God's books every one of them not just a couple but all 66 amen 130 people aboard it was about a hundred or to say 102 pilgrims about 30 members of the of the crew they saw as a modern Jews taking a wilderness trip to the promised land but Church sickness was awful can you imagine using the restroom without trying to get really gross but how do you use the restroom on a ship like that they must have little bowls and then you dump him off the side or something I'm not sure how they did it but when it was storm it was just you know they would go below the deck obviously and there was only four and a half feet tall I'm almost 6 feet tall so the lower deck would we be round right here and they had to be crap all day he imagined with a man we crammed all day like this in the bottom you and your children and your family 66 days of that not not six minutes but four and a half feet and your delay down there a hundred thirty people crammed down that little Mayflower all for the sake of what this message praise God all by the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God amen then that makes me wonder who my is my life so hard is my life so difficult no it's not yes we have spiritual battles but we never suffered like that god help us to do his will with grateful hearts amen and as we battle the mind battles may God bring all these things they meant by the Holy Spirit bring all things to our members so that we can serve God except ibly and reverently in fear of the Lord amen how is your testimony and my testimony gonna measure up to people like that well by God's grace all the way it will measure up by God's grace okay coming down I just dumped the toilet water coming down here Oh children how you doing down here and the history says they just went back and forward like this people throwing up all over down there for 66 days I want to read this one part it's just a beautiful let me read this it's almost a quote from this historian the seeds of the richest most prosperous nation in the entire history of humanity we're laying in the bottom of this tiny boat called the Mayflower okay picture picture of New York City the landscape picture all those big buildings picture any American civilization where the skyscrapers the Sears Tower in Chicago picture that the scenes of that what was he going to take to build that the seeds of that was laying in this little Mayflower going back and forth there would have been no Sears Tower there have been no Twin Towers then there have been no Washington DC and White House had there not been for some faithful message believers that endured eight weeks of torture eight weeks of torment the very seeds of this church a mehendi we're laying in the bottom of that boat amen let me say like this that was a special boat because there's a special God protecting that boat hallelujah but their tragedy struck them you know we the first person that died on the boat was his wife now he wasn't the governor yet but he was going to be the governor the first person who died was his wife who fell off the boat their sailing so she must have went up to maybe to do some business I don't know but she fell off the boat and the very pilgrims God we pray your blessing us we're making it the very god they're praying to allows this to happen and the history says they still praise God amidst all the tears they still never lost their vision despite seeing wives and then children dying and all these things they never lost their vision so you couldn't shake it from him why because it was written upon their hearts amen these weren't pushovers these weren't these little cartoon creatures I see at my school you know with little turkey guns and you know pilgrim hats and these little fuddy-duddies these were warriors these were men that knew God they knew the power of God they knew the grace of God they did the protection of God and they knew God's Word amen and the midst of tragedy they could seal with tears running down their faces it is God who gives and God who takes away the name of the Lord amen that's our foundation that's our family members praise God that's our ancestry is men and women like this that love God they knew their purpose was greater than the trials and tragedies of their experiencing right now so it is for you today the struggles you're going through the struggles I face are meaningless in comparison to God's will for our lives in other words God's will must be done the word must be kept hey man someone's gonna keep this word God is gonna preserve his word just like he preserved the way through them and I want to be one of those smaller number oh oh I want to be in that number praise God I want to be one of those Saints that goes marching up in the rapture and to the marriage supper laughs I want to be one of those Saints and how would I be if I keep the word now they had a great miracle they're out in the middle of the ocean and the main beam on the Mayflower cracked at the very base of it and the captain came down and he said he imagined him come and stomping down the steps he said prepare to meet your God that's when his door history says and the pilgrims there were still shaken but one of them said hey we brought a square wooden screw with us it's kind of screw used when you when you refile when you put a new foundation on a house you got to use a screw to kind of move the foundation somebody felt led of the Holy Spirit to bring a screw a wooden this grow so they said hey pass the screw down and the pilgrims weren't there there's water raisin the pilgrims went up there and they plug the hole with the screw screwed it in and it gave that support to the beam so the beam could hold hold the sails and everything and the people rejoice that was a second miracle praise God Oh Satan couldn't sink it why because God was in there you were in there phrase god I was in there I was in that ship dad wouldn't let us sink because God was doing something hey man God was restoring he was restoring Co what's the purpose of that what's that big old wooden screw doing here oh I left my daughter back her I left my grandpa back what does that big old screw doing here it has a purpose everything has a purpose God is not the author of confusion God is the author of peace praise God they seen one miracle after another while they're on the boat they wrote at the Mayflower Compact and they say we need to govern that's by the people and for the people and the Mayflower Compact that said we do this for the glory of God for the advancement of the Christian faith amen that's why I'm here today to advance the Christian faith to these children who don't if they don't yet believe praise God amen I'm trying to advance the Christian faith into your life I want to advance of my life we're trying to advance the Christian faith as long as God cares we must have been sit we must give it to the next generation and be prepared to make sacrifices now so that the next generation knows God knows the word knows the revelation and can be part of the promise restoration of the church praise God hallelujah and sixty-six books I mean days later sorry just 66 books of the Bible later they saw land and they landed on Plymouth Rock once they landed though the captain's like it's too cold August November it's too cold to go back to England now we'll die the captain wasn't a believer he wasn't a pilgrim he said our boat we're gonna we're gonna dock out we're gonna set the anchor down we're a dock out a mile offshore we'll just stay there during the day they take boats you know to come in now the pilgrim man they slept on the island and the women and children each say they'd work they send the women children out to the boat to sleep so that cover but the men just set up you know like little forts you know wooden parts and he said there was snow probably two or three feet deep said that you know shovel the snow out with their bare hands you know they had a few and a few tools you know they brought over on the boat but the first year was awful 47 out of 102 pilgrims died 55 what were only left almost half the church died almost half the church left and the church said so you can't look at numbers always as proof of God's favor or God's disapproval you know you know the most people that died died that was women because the women would sleep on top of their children with and without suffocating them to keep them warm so all the children survived that winter but most of the mothers died because they subjected themselves to the cold and they kept their children warm what sacrifice is that priests got no one to program said that's why the mothers she's got a mother's heart you know God took the rib out of Adam because it was close to his heart there's a mother's love right there most of the women died they slept on the children in the springtime with 55 of them left the captain said I'm going back to England boys y'all is ladies you all better get on here not a one of them one to go back they were singing I have decided to follow Jesus they said see ya see you later and God said them you know the story Squanto God said I'm Squanto how do we do that this land is different that we our crops are produced in the right way so God sent them a messenger to feed them naturally praise God and then the pilgrims had the spiritual food for the hem one the Squanto gave them natural and the pilgrims gave the Indian spiritual praise God yeah there was Wars and Fighting's and things like that but the real Christian pilgrims didn't wanna do anything any harm to the Native Americans all they wanted was a church and life where they were in Liberty to obey the Bible I don't want a queen or king telling me how to worship God I only want Jesus Christ the King of Kings tell me how to worship in the hey back and it was worth it it was worth to death it was worth it is structured it was worth of the sorrow and the tragedy so that we can serve God in the beauty of wholeness not being under denomination oh thank god I'm so happy today praise I just feel like dancing her out of it praise God why because I'm not controlled by denominational anti spirit I'm controlled by the Holy Spirit praise God amen and he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed amen I'm free to worship I'm free to live down I'm free no babies away and we're not controlled by man we're controlled by God but would you want to turn around and go back if you're a message believer you say I'll stay God's brought me this far he's gonna take me the rest of the way home for a haze God can I say like this if you look at it spiritually they had escaped that iron tooth beast that Daniel talked about right you had the the the bear and I say the lion the bear and the leopard this last this is the last Kingdom right last Gentile Kingdom it was a beast that had teeth like iron teeth and so they're on the boat and they get over they finally get these fresh crowns and they're like hey you guys want to go back to the iron tooth Beast No thank you I'm I'm quite happy over here where the Spirit of God has control of me and I'm not controlled by a beast power of that kind of beast power praise God they were controlled by the anointing to get the man praise God and then pretty soon the eagle anointing would come and they do it they knew there's a greater amazing than this there's more light to this word that we know but we're willing to separate ourselves until God sends it amen oh thank the Lord praise God said we'd rather die in the wilderness than go back to Egypt praise the Lord Amen what men and women of God praise the Lord I'm almost done that's one look at a few scriptures here you know they were they were so they were such Christians that there was a there was a pilgrim man who murdered somebody and the only witnesses were Native Americans and so they set up a court because the court was based upon the ten commandments and they said if we can find two or three witnesses that this man killed him he's got to die that's how far what they went back they went back to the law of Moses and they couldn't find any pilgrims that saw but two Native Americans come up and saw it and they gave their witness against this murder and they executed the manner talk about justice Church talk about righteousness see because they had the revelation all men are created equal knives of God what a man shows that shall you reap I don't know about the death penalty you know as far as today I don't know about that but I'm just showing you look how much they honored the Word of God they didn't favor well he's he's a pilgrim so I favor him see what see what see what it was he was born in the pilgrim church but he wasn't born from the heavenly church there's a man that's more than availab will not be a murderer praise God if he does is before I got saved a man like Moses right that's a good example of how all men they late in other words they lived out what they believed from the scripture because of that God honored them now a couple years is the last thing I know I just want to read this last history I want to read a few scriptures and we'll be done here all right are you enjoying the history of America if you like you were there I feel like I've been sick lately so I kind of feel like I've been there you know sick in the boat see we have to be identified my when I've been willing to cross the ocean a three-month almost a three-month journey perked up sorry two and a half month journey what I've been willing to cross the ocean for two and half months of total torment just to get the Word of God tis next location just to start a church where I'd be willing to cross the ocean where are we willing to suffer two and half months of torture so I can start a new church praise God that's the reality of it Church that's the reality God's gonna find a way hallelujah God's gonna find a way in this hour to get every predestinated seed saved sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost praise God amen even got to raise up a little small Church in Akron he'll do whatever he can whenever he has to do to make sure the predestined seats here the way receive the live and walk in the further light he won't let him die into that old light he won't die with those carcasses right the the maggot filled carcasses of a day gone by but he lets them feed on the fresh word amen where the carcasses the Eagles will be gathered praise God thank the Lord amen so last story a couple summers after they were there it was the Summer of 1623 do I have it yeah okay yeah pilgrims of Puritans he chose pilgrims fast prayer yeah sorry fasting and prayer before the Mayflower trip here's what I wanted us to last stir Wintel in the drought of 1623 it says by a drought it continued from the third week in May until the middle of July can you imagine that no rain I've never seen that my lifetime I remember there was one drought in the 80s I was a young boy I don't remember the details but it might have been the summer of 88 yeah 88 or 89 it was an awful drought everything was dead Brown you know but the the pilgrims in their first couple summers were this is one of their first couple summers and they're experiencing a drought no rain May June and now we're into July and it says without any rain the great heat for the most part the Corps began to wither away you ever feel like that your hopes are withering away raise little chairs if we like you know your hope to to get your family member save is withering away your hope to see America you know is withering away don't give up Church if God brought you this far he'll take you the rest of the way God didn't save you to lose you got him to save you so you would lose to the devil praise God right and they knew that they do we got to not bring us here for us to starve and die they knew the scripture but the corn began to wither the grounds got drier and parched to the the withered hay so the preachers said let's set aside a solemn day for humiliation to seek the Lord by humble and fervent prayer so the preachers like well pilgrims here we are we're Pilgrims and strangers of this land and our food is going to wither away we're gonna die if we if we don't get some rain here so they said what should we do we should start a new denomination no no we should you know just get drunk and eat drink and be merry because we're all gonna die no let's not revert to natural things let's pray so history says they set aside a day of prayer and what's interesting is that Bradford said all the Native Americans they weren't Christians they were just watching them because they're like hey we need some rain too and they could communicate you know they could translate they're just watching these guys pray all day history says it was blazing hot the whole day on this day of prayer and fasting sky was blue not a cloud in this guy and the Native Americans are like what these guys believe in God you know they they were they weren't trusted in God and history says at about evening time in the evening time it shall be liked but it wasn't like here it was rain in the evening time it began to get a little overcast and shortly after a rain with such sweet and gentle showers gave them cause of rejoicing and blessing God under those circumstances usually you get thunderstorms and lightning storms which would kill the crops but the Indians William sit back amazed like what is going on soft gentle rain and so I don't know if the Indians got converted but the Radford said they all had to witness that the pilgrims God was God they've had I that's what we need in our lives we need to seek God so our owner I don't say family and friends we'll see in the midst of our struggles when we cry out to God the Living God comes on the scene amen let's not be discouraged by our struggles their trials that God is alive so he can get the glory out of my say Matt Bradford said it was a gracious and speed answer seven weeks later no seven weeks of rain for rain they set one day aside and for seven weeks of no rain a sweet calm water pours then the rest of the year was great they got the harvest God spared their crop because of why prayer fasting and the desire to be the original book of Acts church there if we go to this altar so be to that original Church and we act upon it as Satan will bring up trials but if we got the desire God will help us and overcome every trial that comes against us praise God amen now few scriptures was that okay Oh about stirred my heart I just I'm like I'm reading this and I'm like it's 5:00 in the morning I'm like what in the world there were message believers they were looking for a greater light I was just like them I'm just like them I'm look I've received the greater light and now I'm trying to stablish real Christian worship amen trying to re-establish the book of Acts in Akron Ohio hallelujah so Church you and I are separatists right we have to continue separating from the things of the world we must do it Wednesday we'll look at the foundations of the founding fathers but remember this nation started out as a godly nation but revelation 13:11 says that this nation is now an unholy beast because it's power comes from the first beast pagan Rome then it had power you know to send fire from the heavens mother and said was the atomic bombs of World War two in 1944 if I'm not mistaken but fire to make fire fall from the heavens and and impress the men on the earth but see we're not our nation's not Christian like it was but there are Christians here praise God you and I are the modern-day pilgrims yeah now let's go to scripture here I was look up the scripture go to 2nd Timothy I just thought of it while I was praying up here I'm sorry it's 1st Timothy 6 sorry 1st Timothy 6 now Lord willing we'll pray in a little bit here as we close we'll pray that God will help us to remember some of these thoughts on Thursday at our Thanksgiving meals Church I tell you that turkey or that hams can taste a lot better and we can think about pilgrims falling off boats vomiting all kinds of sickness gross grossest all that they had to endure so we can have a real Thanksgiving 1st Timothy 6 now verse 5 is going to 1686 5 perverse disputing of men of corrupt minds into this destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness can you imagine telling those pilgrims oh if you were more golly you know you would have gained a bigger boat than the Mayflower if you really godly know don't confuse that the thing is God made a way praise God God made a way from such withdraw yourself but godliness with contentment is great gain you know you've got somewhere with Christ when you enjoy the fact that you're living a godly separated life no matter how much money or food or clothing you got you're just content with living a godly life I'm just happy to skip Thanksgiving because my children are all alive and they don't have disease and I'm not sick and I'm not in the hospital I'll just thankful I got a little bit of food a little bit of money in the bank I got a decent job you know see we should be used to be thankful for these things that we have praise God and it's a great achievement as a Christian to possess godliness with contentment but then the next morning Friday morning people say thanks Lord for the food they'll watch football all day basketball they'll show with other food and they'll push people line they'll cuss people to get the the latest TV the 5k TV or sweater that's on sale for 29 it was $79.99 but it's an on sale at Men's Wearhouse for 29 nine I'll put somebody down get out of my way you me but he bleepity bleep that's real thankful isn't it my goodness our lives should be a the Bible said a sweet savour unto the Lord as an offering of Thanksgiving sure you want to get nice gifts for your family let us have a Christian attitude while we do it praise God let's tell somebody Happy Thanksgiving I was doing that yesterday people looking at me uh all the off said happy Thanksgiving they're like whoa they're like they you know they're not used to people being nice to them I can't wait to say Merry Christmas thank God for His Son Jesus Christ can't wait to say that yes thank God for sending his son Jesus Christ I like that it's add a little bit to that can't wait to say that the Bible says verse 7 for we brought nothing into this world it's certain we could carry nothing out if anyone knew that the pilgrims knew that they we're gonna carry any of their possessions out in Holland or England they weren't - they were gonna carry anything out all I wanted was godliness the ability to lead live in the liberty of the Holy Spirit under the guidance of God in complete obedience to the Word of God and I'll be happy with that glory and having food and raiment let us be R with be content ascend to our feet but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and too many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil the love of it which while some after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves see who did they hurt when they loved me they hurt themselves they damaged their own Souls right they they they destroy their own walk with God because they love money more than love godliness pierced them through with many sorrows see why they can't have to be happy at church they can't be happy at church because they haven't received God's Word they want to receive money they want to receive the riches and all these things so when they come they're just sorrowful they know they can't get excited about spiritual riches they don't get excited about talking about heaven they don't get excited about the mayor's self or the lamb praise God it doesn't excite them anymore because they're just sorrowful they just want things down here why can't it go my way Micah what if the pilgrims would have said that why can't it go my way my wife had to be strip-searched right in front of everybody I can have it my way my wife and children are back there in England I'm here in Holland for a whole year I can't have it my way it's not about our way it's about God's Way hey man we keep the word we obey the word we keep the vision of the complete restoration and whenever God allows he'll allow it in his wisdom but we got to have grace to be thankful in the midst of our trials praise God musicians if you come praise the Lord he said fight the good fight of faith how many fires got there today fighting for this message oh yeah lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou are also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses I'll give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment here it is without spot unreviewable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus that should be our desire live spotless live blameless we don't know when the squeeze is we don't know when the rapturous will will fill the season but until then we live wholly spotless blameless and tell this next generation about the real Jesus Christ is that that's what they were living for those pilgrims we're never gonna live to see the day when the White House was built and they finally got to move in they're a nice beautiful house they were never to see the twin towers go up they were never to see Sears Tower go up but they were they were believing that God was gonna bless the nation and God has poured out
