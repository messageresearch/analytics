[27:49] well let's take our Bibles here today by
[27:52] the grace of Lord let's go to first
[27:53] Timothy chapter 3 then we'll go to
[27:56] Philippians 4 so first Timothy chapter 3
[28:31] by God's grace would like to preach on
[28:34] the mystery of godliness restored to man
[28:38] it's going to take numerous sermons
[28:41] imagine Oh feet maybe five or more we'll
[28:45] see now in Chapter three
[28:56] Paul as far as background he's giving
[28:59] qualifications for elders or bishops so
[29:03] pastors and then deacons in verses 8 to
[29:08] 12 I'm sorry 8 to 13
[29:13] and then 14 we'll pick it up there I'll
[29:16] read in 14
[29:18] I'll read 14 15 16 and then we'll all
[29:21] read the memory verse verse 14 these
[29:25] things write I unto thee hoping to come
[29:28] unto thee shortly but if I tarry long
[29:31] that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
[29:34] to behave thyself in the house of God
[29:38] which is the Church of the Living God
[29:41] the pillar and ground of the truth so
[29:47] the church is the pillar of truth it's
[29:49] the ground of truth verse 16 is our main
[29:55] scripture for the text and without
[29:58] controversy great is the mystery of
[30:03] godliness God was manifest in the flesh
[30:06] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[30:11] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[30:15] in the world received up into glory now
[30:19] let's go to Philippians chapter 4 verse
[30:22] 7 and 8 are in the three verses seven
[30:42] eight together let's begin on three one
[30:45] two three and the peace of God which
[30:49] passeth all understanding shall keep
[30:52] your hearts and minds through Christ
[30:55] Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things
[30:59] are true whatsoever things are honest
[31:03] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[31:07] things are pure whatsoever things are
[31:11] lovely whatsoever things are of a good
[31:14] report if there be any virtue and if
[31:18] there be any praise think on these
[31:21] things amen
[31:23] may God add his blessings with reading
[31:25] his word you may be seen
[31:40] all right so Lord willing we like to
[31:43] look at this next mystery we've been
[31:46] preaching on numerous mysteries I think
[31:48] we started with the kingdom of heaven
[31:50] was the first mystery that we preached
[31:52] and then as we preached the book of
[31:55] Revelation series we preached the
[31:58] mystery of Babylon and then by God's
[32:03] grace we just finished up the mystery of
[32:06] the rapture and off and on as we
[32:09] preached on the soul of man we've been
[32:13] looking at the mystery of Christ in you
[32:16] the hope of glory because that all ties
[32:18] together I want to start Lord willing as
[32:21] we look at this topic of godliness I
[32:26] want to look at brother Rams quote real
[32:30] quick so it's from sirs is this the end
[32:35] time and brother Rams talking about all
[32:39] the scriptures the seventh angel is
[32:42] gonna fulfill and all the duties that
[32:47] he's supposed to fulfill all the
[32:48] scriptures and then as as our churches
[32:51] familiar with many churches are in the
[32:53] message brother Adam shows how the
[32:56] mysteries of God must be finished and
[32:59] brother Ram references his Scofield
[33:02] Bible and they have eleven mysteries
[33:04] down at the bottom I believe after if
[33:06] you do a concordance search on the word
[33:08] mystery in the New Testament there's 26
[33:11] hits on mystery and if you go through
[33:14] each and every one of them I've done
[33:15] that by God's grace twelve of them seem
[33:18] to be mysteries that are individual
[33:21] doctrines and so that's why 12 seems to
[33:25] fit you know twelve is a number of
[33:28] tribes of Israel twelve is the number of
[33:31] apostles it's the number of foundations
[33:34] it's the number of pieces of shewbread
[33:36] and so twelve seems to be a fitting
[33:39] number
[33:42] to speak on the mysteries of God
[33:44] especially with the shewbread because
[33:46] God's mysteries are his bread that he
[33:49] feeds to his people according to brother
[33:51] Branham and according to scripture
[33:55] there's numerous scriptures that refer
[33:57] to the bread of life Jesus is the bread
[34:00] of life
[34:01] and the Bible says we are even as a body
[34:05] of believers with Jews and Gentiles we
[34:08] are one bread and we partake of the
[34:11] bread of God the bread of life
[34:13] so I'm reading here this is paragraph
[34:23] 251 sirs this is the end time
[34:25] he says the seventh mystery of God even
[34:29] Christ as the incarnate fullness of the
[34:32] Godhead embodied in whom all divine
[34:36] wisdom so that's the mystery of the
[34:38] Godhead and then without saying the
[34:41] number eight brother Adam just says and
[34:43] godliness is restored to man then he
[34:47] goes the ninth mystery is the mystery of
[34:50] iniquity found in 2nd Thessalonians and
[34:53] so forth and he says the tenth mystery
[34:57] is the seven stars of revelation 1 verse
[35:00] 20
[35:02] all right brother ham says that some of
[35:05] the mysteries the Angels supposed to
[35:06] wind up all the mystery he said the
[35:10] mysteries of God all right so we're
[35:12] gonna preach or willing off of my notes
[35:15] that I've been writing here for the next
[35:16] book and we started with that first
[35:21] quote and I just want to say this on to
[35:24] my personal conviction I think of all
[35:27] the 12 mysteries of the New Testament I
[35:29] think this may be one of the most
[35:31] confusing for message people ok so
[35:35] there's we know there's 12 and we know
[35:37] almost every one of these mysteries is
[35:40] confusing to the nominal church world I
[35:43] mean some of them are are pretty easily
[35:46] understood such as Jew and Gentiles one
[35:50] church but you know I've talked to new
[35:55] first people in person over email text
[35:58] and most people that go to churches
[36:01] today in just regular churches outside
[36:04] the message they have a hard time with
[36:07] the Godhead they have a hard time even
[36:09] even confessing that the church is the
[36:11] Bride of Christ I remember when I when
[36:14] we first put our church online I had
[36:16] numerous people contact me and say oh
[36:18] the name of your church isn't scriptural
[36:20] and we're not you shouldn't call
[36:22] yourself the Bride of Christ well yet
[36:25] there's so many scriptures that call the
[36:27] New Testament church the wife and Jesus
[36:30] Christ as the bridegroom and so there's
[36:33] a lot of people that struggle with that
[36:34] one we know there's a lot of people that
[36:37] struggle with Mystery Babylon as the
[36:39] Roman Catholic Church most people
[36:43] struggle with Christ in you the hope of
[36:45] glory right most people have a hard time
[36:47] with that doctrine because they think as
[36:50] soon as you say a prayer oh I invited
[36:52] Jesus into my heart and and now I've got
[36:55] now I'm born again but that's not true
[36:59] they're forgiven they're justified
[37:02] they're there they're accepted but
[37:05] they're not quite filled yet because
[37:07] they're not sanctified yet as Jesus said
[37:10] there's three steps to maturity we'd say
[37:15] justification sanctification baptism of
[37:18] the Holy Ghost and this mystery the
[37:20] mystery of godliness lays out even more
[37:23] details of the growing process we'll
[37:26] call it like that and so that's my
[37:28] personal opinion that this mystery of
[37:31] godliness is the most confusing to
[37:35] message people I could be wrong on that
[37:38] but that seems to be the case now as I
[37:43] was led of the Holy Spirit I believe to
[37:46] start studying this and teach on this
[37:48] years ago I think it was in 2013 the
[37:51] Holy Spirit took me to the seven seals
[37:54] and showed me how every time brother
[37:56] Branham got a fresh revelation from by
[37:59] vision or from directly from the angel
[38:02] the Lord as he preached the seven seals
[38:03] he said and the quotes are easily found
[38:07] in the seven seals
[38:08] he said I'd spend the rest of the day
[38:11] running those words down through the
[38:13] concordance for example oil and wine he
[38:17] would spend the rest of the day looking
[38:19] at every time oil and wine is mentioned
[38:21] in the scripture he did it with a horse
[38:25] a beast as a power right he did it with
[38:28] the colors white red black and pale he
[38:31] was run running those down through the
[38:32] scripture what his white represent
[38:34] that's why at the beginning of 1960 and
[38:38] 61 brother Adam was confused about the
[38:41] white horse rider because he he was
[38:42] using white to always symbolize Christ's
[38:45] righteousness with the the first white
[38:48] horse rider but then when God opened it
[38:50] up it was the Antichrist spirit and so
[38:54] then you then other scriptures open up
[38:56] later how even satan transforms himself
[39:01] into an angel of light and so the
[39:06] revelation of the Holy Spirit tears the
[39:12] confusion off of the Bible right it it
[39:15] tears the veil off Scripture and then
[39:18] you have the right understanding and
[39:20] then when you look to the concordance
[39:22] and look to the Word of God you can see
[39:24] how the symbols and the meanings of
[39:27] words all fit together to be rightly
[39:30] divided to the word of truth so in my
[39:34] personal experience that's what I did
[39:35] because we know godliness is the sixth
[39:39] step on the statue of a perfect man and
[39:41] that's not according to brother Branham
[39:43] necessarily it was first according to
[39:45] Peter the man who had the keys to the
[39:48] kingdom praise God and God just gave
[39:51] brother Branham the present-day
[39:53] understanding of it but no doubt Peter
[39:55] had that understanding first because he
[39:58] wrote about it praise God in his second
[40:01] letter and so with that kind of
[40:06] background we move now to teaching on
[40:10] godliness
[40:12] so our scripture is first Timothy 3:16
[40:18] so Paul's laying out all the attributes
[40:21] of our
[40:22] real pastor and a real deacon and even a
[40:25] pastor's wife and a deacons wife right
[40:27] they have to be holy as well and then he
[40:31] talks about behaving yourself in God's
[40:33] house and then goes in this description
[40:38] of Jesus Christ he said so there's
[40:42] there's no controversy so it's it's not
[40:46] debatable right there's no debate the
[40:48] great is the mystery of godliness so
[40:51] what's interesting is that marriage is
[40:53] called a great mystery right this is a
[40:55] great mystery but I speak concerning
[40:57] Christ in the church and this subject is
[41:01] also called a great mystery praise God
[41:03] so in other words is going to take a
[41:05] greater studying of Scripture and
[41:09] revelation of the scripture from the
[41:11] Holy Spirit
[41:12] in order to understand this mystery
[41:14] praise God that's why most message
[41:16] churches and most denominations have no
[41:19] idea about the revelation of the mystery
[41:22] of godliness but thank God Jesus has
[41:26] revealed it to us praise God amen and
[41:28] for that we're grateful we're eternally
[41:31] grateful because it shows us that we can
[41:35] know where we are where we stand with
[41:37] God where we where we were where we
[41:41] currently are and where we need to go
[41:43] praise God in other words it's our
[41:45] roadmap to holiness praise God amen
[41:48] just as Jesus is the highway to holiness
[41:50] praise the Lord now so godliness is a
[41:57] mysterious yet obtainable level of
[42:01] Christian character so it's a level
[42:05] godliness is a level of action in a
[42:08] Christians life it's a level of daily
[42:11] living in a Christians life like Paul
[42:14] said in Philippians 3:14 he said we are
[42:19] to press toward the mark for the prize
[42:24] of the high calling in Christ Jesus so
[42:28] what is this prize is this level of
[42:31] godliness to obtain character
[42:36] Christ now if you look in the Greek
[42:41] which brother branham did that as he
[42:43] taught many subjects like the Godhead
[42:46] like when he looked at a morphate with
[42:48] Jesus was in the form he became in the
[42:51] form of a servant and Philippians 2 but
[42:54] now with godliness when you look in the
[42:55] Greek it means reverence respect and
[42:58] piety towards God
[43:01] so other words for reverence might be
[43:03] loyal faithful devoted or dutiful praise
[43:09] God so this is a mystery of loyalty
[43:13] praise God amen it's the mystery of
[43:16] faithfulness praise God in your
[43:19] christ-like character brother ramps of
[43:20] godliness is simple a description he
[43:23] said you're being like God right because
[43:26] you're godly praise the Lord
[43:28] you're loyal like God Amen you're
[43:30] faithful like God and so it's God's
[43:34] invitation it's our opportunity to be
[43:38] like him a lot of people think well I
[43:42] can't be like God now it's true as far
[43:44] as God's unlimited power and is
[43:48] immutability of course you know we
[43:51] cannot be like God but Jesus says you
[43:55] can reach a very godly state because
[44:00] Jesus says in Matthew 5:48 he says be
[44:05] therefore perfect even as your father
[44:07] which is in heaven is perfect
[44:10] now there's two thoughts on this
[44:12] scripture because we know perfect means
[44:17] complete right so God doesn't mean
[44:20] sinless it just means you've come to
[44:23] completion and so Jesus is asking us to
[44:27] come to a completed product come to a
[44:29] complete level of loyalty or maturity
[44:33] the highest level of loyalty that you
[44:36] can achieve Jesus says I'm going to
[44:38] strive for that try to be perfect try to
[44:40] come to completion now that's the first
[44:43] thought the second thought is that we
[44:45] are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ
[44:47] amen
[44:49] so our souls are perfect so there's two
[44:53] thoughts on Jesus saying be perfect he's
[44:57] saying he's saying submit your will that
[44:59] you can reach a very loyal character but
[45:05] he's also saying I'm making your soul
[45:07] perfect because I'm sealing your soul
[45:10] I'm I'm sharing my nature with your
[45:14] nature praise God
[45:17] I'm giving you an anointing in your soul
[45:20] my life in your soul and then that makes
[45:24] your soul perfect spotless the Bible
[45:27] calls it blameless the Bible calls it
[45:29] incorruptible praise God so your soul
[45:32] can be perfect your soul can be
[45:34] incorruptible the nature that lead your
[45:38] mind and causes your mind to bring your
[45:42] body innocent objection praise God so we
[45:46] can be like God to an extent not to the
[45:49] phonus will never be exactly the full
[45:53] glory of God of course but we can reach
[45:56] a high level of faithfulness like God
[45:59] amen so it's a state of loyalty or state
[46:07] of reverence that you live in your life
[46:10] so if Jesus asked us to be perfect
[46:13] writers there must be a way to get there
[46:16] and that's what this revelation is all
[46:18] about amen he said great is the mystery
[46:21] of godliness and he went through what
[46:23] Christ did God became flesh was
[46:30] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[46:33] preached unto the Gentiles Christ was
[46:37] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[46:40] in the world and Christ was received up
[46:43] into glory
[46:46] so to understand godliness you have to
[46:50] look at Paul's context it was the life
[46:53] of Jesus Christ in other words Jesus
[46:57] Christ's earthly life manifested true
[47:01] godliness we're only going to know
[47:03] godliness by looking at the life of
[47:05] Jesus Christ and thank God we got four
[47:08] devoted books to that right Matthew Mark
[47:10] Luke and John
[47:11] of course other ones mention it but if
[47:14] we want to know what godliness looks
[47:16] like in someone's human life we must
[47:19] only look to Jesus Christ now we know he
[47:22] was truly tempted the Bible said he can
[47:25] be touched by the feeling of our
[47:27] infirmities that feeling you you get
[47:30] when you're tempted to lie Jesus knows
[47:32] what that's like that feeling you're
[47:35] tempted you know whether it's physically
[47:37] or lust or it's an anger or bitterness
[47:41] or it's a cheat whatever feeling you get
[47:47] Jesus knows exactly what that feels like
[47:49] and yet he was able to overcome that
[47:53] with at each and every battle that say
[47:57] in the bra upon him he was able to
[47:59] overcome it by casting down anything
[48:02] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[48:04] of God you wouldn't entertain it he
[48:07] wouldn't enjoy it he cast it down by the
[48:10] power of speaking God's word amen
[48:13] it is written it is also written praise
[48:15] God so Christ is the epitome of
[48:19] godliness this is because he lived by
[48:22] every word that proceedeth on the mouth
[48:25] of God so if you want to understand
[48:29] godliness we just gotta look at the
[48:30] character of Jesus Christ now how did
[48:35] Jesus manifest godliness it's very
[48:39] scriptural it's in Luke 2:49 and Luke
[48:46] 2:52 Jesus grew in godliness by
[48:54] constantly increasing his wisdom or fear
[48:58] of the Lord right because the fear of
[49:00] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[49:03] so given overnight even at 12 years old
[49:08] Jesus's heart was burdened he just
[49:11] wanted to do the father's business right
[49:13] but the scriptures right after that tell
[49:16] how he grew in godliness the Bible said
[49:19] he increased in wisdom
[49:21] that's why church with each service and
[49:23] I've said it before try to get just a
[49:25] couple things if you only get one thing
[49:27] to instantly take and apply to your life
[49:32] get that one thing and get that increase
[49:36] that God wants you to get now my life I
[49:39] often see it the easiest application as
[49:43] I can see when we've had preachers
[49:44] preach on things I need like prayer like
[49:47] I need help with my prayer life and a
[49:49] preacher will preach something and I can
[49:50] instantly go and take that and apply
[49:52] that to my life and begin working that
[49:55] into my prayer life and then I see
[49:57] improvement praise God but Jesus
[50:01] increase in wisdom and stature and in
[50:03] favor with God and in man so God gave
[50:09] him more favor and man gave him more
[50:12] favor
[50:13] so church always you know we're not
[50:16] always gonna have persecution if we're
[50:18] obeying God and loving God and and
[50:21] submitting to God there's so there's a
[50:24] period of Jesus's life right where he
[50:26] wasn't being persecuted these first 30
[50:28] years he just got more favored with men
[50:31] all the time he got more favored with
[50:33] God all the time so we know there's
[50:38] times and seasons for everything we know
[50:40] at the beginning of his Holy Ghost film
[50:42] ministry everybody loved him he had
[50:43] multitudes following him but when in the
[50:45] second phase when he started prophesying
[50:47] especially against the religious groups
[50:49] that's when the big crowds left him and
[50:52] eventually they crucified him but this
[50:56] is how Jesus grew in godliness by
[51:01] increasing his wisdom and how do we get
[51:03] wisdom it's revelation of God's Word
[51:06] praise God because number Paul said you
[51:08] must receive the spirit of revelation in
[51:11] the wisdom of God amen
[51:13] wisdom is skillful decision-making so as
[51:16] you seek God what do I decide about this
[51:19] next step this relationship or this job
[51:22] or so
[51:26] Christ increased his devotion to God and
[51:29] his loyalty loyalty to God his godliness
[51:33] increased now what's the confusion
[51:40] because this is a mystery so what's the
[51:42] confusion that message people or even
[51:45] any denominational people have about
[51:48] godliness well with message people the
[51:52] confusion is when is it but when is it
[51:55] achieved most people believe you get
[51:57] born again first justified sanctified
[52:01] Holy Ghost filling and then you start
[52:02] working your way up the statue program
[52:04] man but I believe that the the Bible
[52:07] truth is exactly opposite you start with
[52:10] faith and work your way up and get the
[52:11] godliness and then brotherly kindness
[52:13] and then you get born again I believe
[52:17] that's the scriptural path on how
[52:21] godliness works but the confusion in
[52:26] most churches is about human effort and
[52:31] even its attainability right because
[52:35] most churches will say well your your
[52:37] preach and legalism now brother Jesse
[52:39] err oh we can't obtain that or just
[52:41] sinners saved by grace which we are
[52:43] sinners saved by grace but Jesus says be
[52:48] therefore perfect and there's numerous
[52:50] other scriptures we'll get to that speak
[52:54] about this so it is it how much effort
[52:58] is required can it even be attained
[53:03] is it legalistic to preach this and then
[53:10] as we start talking about this
[53:12] particular confusion we go back to the
[53:15] works versus faith debate right so this
[53:19] all this age-old debate is revived when
[53:22] you come to godliness but
[53:29] you study God's Word as we start
[53:30] studying this and looking down in these
[53:32] scriptures and course we'll get back to
[53:34] the Philippians series as well will kind
[53:36] of keep I like to keep two series going
[53:37] at least at a time God's Word settles
[53:41] this once and for all because the
[53:43] revelation of God unfolds as you start
[53:46] digging through the scriptures searching
[53:48] the Scriptures daily right well things
[53:51] be so so now let's look at Bible
[53:53] evidence for the revelation now I'm
[53:57] going to begin with Jesus
[54:00] so is human effort required or not okay
[54:06] and I want to just say this real quick
[54:09] remember the Bible says we're saved by
[54:13] grace through faith so we have to have
[54:16] faith to be saved but what motivates
[54:18] faith remember the scripture how does
[54:22] faith work parfaits works by faith which
[54:28] worketh by love so Galatians says then
[54:30] also that in Galatians so we are saved
[54:34] by faith but what actually becomes
[54:36] before faith love so children when you
[54:40] first see Jesus on the cross and you
[54:41] hear a preacher bottom what do you do
[54:43] you hate him or love them loving them
[54:45] and then that love motivates you to work
[54:49] right so when it comes down to the works
[54:53] verse faith debate it's a it's not a
[54:58] very Bible based debate right because we
[55:03] we don't work if you're working by your
[55:06] own strength then yes works will fail
[55:10] that's what the law was about but if
[55:12] you're working by love if love motivator
[55:16] works as Paul writes if anybody knew
[55:18] about works versus love right or a faith
[55:23] works it was Paul Paul said my faith
[55:26] works by the love of God in me and we
[55:32] know faith is a gift right so God gives
[55:34] you that gift of faith when he sees you
[55:37] love him and now Jesus I had to back
[55:40] around that to get to this
[55:42] Jesus settles it forever how much effort
[55:45] is required so Matthew 22 children can
[55:51] unit Matthew 22 actually why don't you
[55:54] guys go to mark 12:30
[56:02] I'll read Matthew 22 37 to 39 how much
[56:08] human effort is required the four-letter
[56:13] word tells you how much Jesus said unto
[56:17] him thou shalt love l.o.v.e love how
[56:22] much love it's a three-letter word thou
[56:25] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[56:29] heart and with all thy soul with all thy
[56:33] mind this is the first and Great
[56:35] Commandment and the second is like unto
[56:37] it thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[56:39] thyself
[56:41] praise God so how much effort is
[56:44] required all of your love that's what's
[56:46] required right because everything else
[56:49] hangs on these to love the Lord your God
[56:52] and love your neighbor as yourself
[56:53] everything else hangs on that so human
[57:01] effort is required all of it because
[57:04] it's all your strength let me read that
[57:06] in mark 12:30 Jesus says all your
[57:09] strength is required all your human
[57:11] effort this is the first commandment
[57:21] praise God
[57:22] so the very first thing we need to know
[57:24] is that we must give all of our strength
[57:27] all of our human effort to God but it
[57:31] must be motivated by love so start with
[57:36] do I love God's Word or not and start go
[57:40] back to that yes I love so I will give
[57:43] all my effort all my human effort to
[57:46] become more like God amen praise God
[57:55] so Jesus answers this age-old question
[57:58] works or faith
[57:59] well it's love because love love is
[58:05] first faith works by love faith is a
[58:10] gift God gives you salvation when he
[58:14] sees you love him
[58:15] praise God now I want to bring this
[58:18] fresh thought I just had this thought
[58:20] tonight and I've had it before but he
[58:22] just came to me right before a service
[58:23] so listen now some people say oh no
[58:27] effort is required for salvation Saints
[58:32] if no effort is required for salvation
[58:35] then all sinners are going to be saved
[58:37] right
[58:39] that means Judas is scared it's going to
[58:42] be safe because there's no effort
[58:43] required that means Jesus is going to
[58:46] take that rich man out of hell that he
[58:48] talked about that was mean to Lazarus
[58:50] the ripped of the beggar but yeah Jesus
[58:53] said he's got to stay there because you
[58:55] can't pass between the bosom and the
[58:58] fire so see it's ridiculous to say that
[59:05] no human effort is required it's
[59:08] ridiculous there has to be some human
[59:12] action that humans make that are saved
[59:16] they have to do something that to meet
[59:20] God's condition brother Graham says over
[59:22] and over we have to meet God's
[59:23] conditions right the reason people are
[59:30] lost is because they refused to love God
[59:33] down in their souls we must do something
[59:41] and that is love God because once we
[59:45] have love faith will work by love in our
[59:49] hearts I hope that's a blessing praise
[59:52] God we yeah I hear preachers say it all
[59:54] the time any time now not message
[59:58] preachers but you know regular preachers
[1:00:00] that are outside the message anytime a
[1:00:03] preacher starts preaching about a
[1:00:05] specific act of sanctification let's say
[1:00:08] men not smoking or are men not cussing
[1:00:12] or women wearing modest clothes they
[1:00:15] instantly go to the evangelical preacher
[1:00:20] was attacking the Mormons now I believe
[1:00:23] the Mormons have a lot of wrong doctrine
[1:00:24] I don't know if they're saved hopefully
[1:00:27] some of them are but Mormons really
[1:00:32] emphasize good works well as soon as
[1:00:36] they say good works that evangelicals
[1:00:37] say we can't do anything to be safe what
[1:00:39] do you mean we can't do anything now
[1:00:42] it's true we I mean in one way but it's
[1:00:44] wrong another way yes Jesus did all the
[1:00:50] sacrificial work for our salvation but
[1:00:53] yet he can't force us to receive it
[1:00:56] right he can't force us to act upon it
[1:01:01] right because the Bible says whosoever
[1:01:05] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[1:01:07] shall be saved
[1:01:09] amen you got to call you have to have a
[1:01:12] desire a deep desire to call and Jesus
[1:01:15] said you must take up your cross and
[1:01:17] follow me
[1:01:19] if you want to be saved if you want to
[1:01:21] be a disciple so see people will use
[1:01:25] that that phrase where oh we know
[1:01:31] there's nothing we can do to save
[1:01:32] ourselves well that's true we didn't
[1:01:33] save ourselves Christ died for us his
[1:01:36] blood as we went over on Easter paid all
[1:01:38] the price but we have something to do we
[1:01:43] have to love God and by loving him we'll
[1:01:47] use all of our strength to obey Him
[1:01:50] we'll choose to obey Him with all of our
[1:01:53] strength and that means that will mean
[1:01:56] turning down evil works right children
[1:01:59] and doing good works that's why Paul
[1:02:02] said be zealous for good works so back
[1:02:07] to the works verses faith which one is
[1:02:10] it
[1:02:10] well I'd say it's neither I'd say if
[1:02:13] it's one of the other it's faith right
[1:02:15] I'm still working with some of these
[1:02:16] thoughts but first before faith you have
[1:02:18] to have love because faith works
[1:02:21] I love praise God all right so that may
[1:02:31] surprise people and maybe in our church
[1:02:33] people have never heard me preach that
[1:02:36] but listen church the Bible's plain
[1:02:39] every action is based upon love whether
[1:02:42] it's God's love or perverted love and
[1:02:46] that scriptural now guide john 3:19
[1:02:49] and Lydia second Timothy three four so
[1:02:58] these scriptures will prove it G again
[1:03:00] Jesus proves this I'm not making this up
[1:03:02] this is Jesus Christ saying all your
[1:03:06] strength is required if you want to be
[1:03:08] godly all of it's required but it's got
[1:03:10] to be motivated by love praise God
[1:03:12] okay so Lydia Malachi John 3:19
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:24] hey men so right after Jesus says for
[1:03:28] God so loved the world that He sent His
[1:03:30] Son he says this is the condemnation men
[1:03:34] love darkness rather than light why do
[1:03:37] people go to hell they love darkness
[1:03:40] instead of loving Jesus Christ
[1:03:43] so see all their sinful acts are
[1:03:45] motivated by a perverted love right it's
[1:03:50] not agapo it's figlio human a human
[1:03:53] perverted love can everybody see that
[1:03:56] they're lost because of their love their
[1:03:59] their perverted love and then Lydia
[1:04:04] second Timothy three four okay Paul says
[1:04:12] in these last end times they'll be
[1:04:14] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:04:18] God it didn't say they didn't have any
[1:04:21] of them for God because they have a
[1:04:22] figlio love for God you know they see
[1:04:24] the beautiful sunsets and maybe God will
[1:04:27] heal them or God will spare somebody's
[1:04:29] life No
[1:04:31] I have some type of figlio love but then
[1:04:34] when it comes down to obeying God's Word
[1:04:36] or doing pleasures they go get drunk
[1:04:38] right or they get married a third or a
[1:04:40] fourth time or they commit fornication
[1:04:43] or something like that or some evil
[1:04:46] wickedness right so we need God's agape
[1:04:52] love in our hearts right and then faith
[1:04:57] will work based upon that love all right
[1:05:04] and so Jesus silences anyone even who's
[1:05:09] listening now who could be or in the
[1:05:11] future on the archive Jesus silences
[1:05:14] anyone who's trying to accuse us of
[1:05:16] being legalistic because legalism is
[1:05:22] excessive adherence to the law in other
[1:05:26] words legalism is adding something to
[1:05:28] the word remember God's Word says we
[1:05:32] can't and I add or take anything away ha
[1:05:35] verse 35 and 6 says add thou not his
[1:05:38] words lest I become a liar revelation
[1:05:42] 22:18 and 19 says do not add to the Word
[1:05:45] of God or else plagues will be added to
[1:05:48] you on examples when the Galatians were
[1:05:53] getting tricked into adding circumcision
[1:05:56] back into the faith of Jesus Christ Paul
[1:06:00] call that legalism he said that's
[1:06:02] falling from grace so Jesus never asks
[1:06:07] us to do anything outside of his
[1:06:10] commands and what was his top command
[1:06:12] give all your strength give all your
[1:06:14] human effort praise God give all your
[1:06:16] love to God Almighty praise God all of
[1:06:20] it and that's how we'll get to godliness
[1:06:23] or loyalty that's why people are loyal
[1:06:27] or faithful as they should be right
[1:06:30] especially people that sit around the
[1:06:31] message many should be more loyal they
[1:06:35] should be more faithful they should be
[1:06:37] more dutiful right but they're not
[1:06:41] because they start falling out of love
[1:06:43] they've
[1:06:44] their first love amen there it is Bree
[1:06:47] Scott I don't know if I got that on my
[1:06:49] notes don't write that down that would
[1:06:59] be a good spot to add that that's one of
[1:07:05] those that fresh scriptures that will
[1:07:07] come right when I'm preaching and I
[1:07:09] didn't really have planned on coming
[1:07:17] all right so Jesus doesn't ask us to add
[1:07:20] for the word he just empowers our human
[1:07:25] effort by his love and that's the
[1:07:29] scripture so let's read this one Malachi
[1:07:31] can you read Romans 5:5 that guy's going
[1:07:34] to read Romans 5:5
[1:07:39] it's just how Pais empowers your effort
[1:07:50] praise God
[1:07:52] so how do you get love the Holy Ghost
[1:07:54] sheds it into your heart so you gotta
[1:07:57] pray you gotta contact God got to repent
[1:08:01] right get out of the sin get out of the
[1:08:04] get out of the condemnation the guilt
[1:08:06] and when you get in God's presence ask
[1:08:08] him to forgive you his presence anoint
[1:08:10] you right in his friends is fullness of
[1:08:12] joy and that anointing that Holy
[1:08:15] spending brings the love of God and then
[1:08:18] with that love then you have good works
[1:08:21] your faith will start working hallelujah
[1:08:23] praise God oh thank you Jesus it's a
[1:08:26] great mystery hallelujah the mystery of
[1:08:29] godliness whoo hallelujah
[1:08:36] now obeying God with all your effort
[1:08:40] through love is attainable but it comes
[1:08:42] through self crucifixion so Lydia Luke
[1:08:46] 14 27 Keysha can read Romans 8:13
[1:08:57] then Lydia died give me one okay and
[1:09:03] then Malachi Colossians 3:5 and 6 so
[1:09:11] start with Lydia in Luke 14 27 self
[1:09:16] crucifixion is how to get more love in
[1:09:21] our hearts it's glad to do okay so we
[1:09:30] want to follow Jesus to godliness a more
[1:09:33] godly life we have to take up a cross
[1:09:35] that's an across his crucifixion Acacia
[1:09:41] Romans 8:13 yeah I think that's right a
[1:09:51] [Music]
[1:09:57] men mortify means crucified so if you
[1:10:02] lit just feed your flesh all the time
[1:10:04] the black dog he says Paul says you're
[1:10:07] gonna die but if you feed the white dog
[1:10:10] you've got to crucify the black dog to
[1:10:13] feed the white dog right then you live
[1:10:17] you really live you know what it's like
[1:10:18] to be a servant a love slave a prisoner
[1:10:20] to Jesus Christ amen
[1:10:22] thank the Lord hallelujah and so Paul
[1:10:26] says it anew a couple times in Romans
[1:10:28] and Colossians talks about self
[1:10:30] crucifixion of the will the human will
[1:10:33] so Malachi Colossians 3:5 and 6 mortify
[1:10:38] therefore your members which are upon
[1:10:39] the earth fornication uncleanness
[1:10:42] inordinate affection evil concupiscence
[1:10:48] yeah pretty close and covetousness which
[1:10:52] is idolatry we're rich things sake the
[1:10:54] wrath of God come with amen Paul says
[1:10:59] mortify anything any sin any temptation
[1:11:04] mortify it crucify it and that's how
[1:11:08] you're gonna walk in the Holy Spirit
[1:11:10] that's not going to
[1:11:11] more godly the trouble is especially
[1:11:13] message churches we hear this and people
[1:11:15] are like they're like Israel coming out
[1:11:17] of Egypt they pass through the waters
[1:11:19] they get baptized but a lot of people
[1:11:22] this my own opinion they getting that
[1:11:25] hot desert of sanctification and pretty
[1:11:30] soon they they don't mortify the deeds
[1:11:33] of the flesh and then pretty soon they
[1:11:36] might not say it out loud but you can
[1:11:38] tell by their life they're complaining
[1:11:40] like I guess were they murmured a
[1:11:42] complaint against the preach in and the
[1:11:44] direction the preaching was going and
[1:11:46] everything and it happens a lot around
[1:11:49] this message and people will never get
[1:11:52] over into the promised land where their
[1:11:54] life can get placed they get placed in
[1:11:57] their position they know their gifts
[1:11:59] they know their calling in life they
[1:12:02] know God's perfect will for their life
[1:12:03] and they're actually obeying it with a
[1:12:05] God for their life how many people do
[1:12:07] you know like that very few and so see
[1:12:11] it's it's because that hot desert they
[1:12:14] they don't they cater to the flesh
[1:12:16] rather than crucifying the flesh and of
[1:12:22] course Paul experienced this self Chris
[1:12:24] crucifixion every day that's why I
[1:12:27] church Zdenek money but I made that
[1:12:29] morning routine video it's so
[1:12:31] scripturally true if you want to get
[1:12:33] closer to God you have to die daily it
[1:12:36] has to become your habit to read your
[1:12:38] Bible every morning your habit to pray
[1:12:40] your habit to study the scripture and
[1:12:42] meditate upon the Word of God it has to
[1:12:46] become your habit because Paul said I
[1:12:49] protest by your rejoicing which I have
[1:12:52] in Christ Jesus our Lord I die daily I
[1:12:56] die daily forming uh forming a streak of
[1:13:04] good habits is so important because
[1:13:07] remember bad habits are bad spirits
[1:13:10] they're evil spirits that's the reason
[1:13:13] people can't grow in godliness because
[1:13:15] they've got evil spirits up here mostly
[1:13:18] up here most of them are religious
[1:13:21] spirits right because they lack
[1:13:23] religious
[1:13:24] though we'll get to this my this is a
[1:13:26] good thought form of godliness they'll
[1:13:29] have a form of godliness which is a
[1:13:30] religious spirit they'll do all the
[1:13:33] certain things but when it comes down to
[1:13:35] their daily life are they daily
[1:13:38] crucifying the lusts of the flesh and
[1:13:41] forming godly habits on a daily basis
[1:13:45] that right there my friends is what
[1:13:48] separates someone who's born again and
[1:13:50] someone who's not so see this is obeying
[1:14:01] God's Word by crucifying the will the
[1:14:05] flesh every day that will the flesh must
[1:14:09] be crucified Paul said I die daily now
[1:14:15] you either yield it to one of two
[1:14:17] masters right Luke 16:13 no man can
[1:14:21] serve two masters for either he will
[1:14:23] hate the one and love the other or else
[1:14:26] he will hold to the one despise the
[1:14:27] other you cannot serve God and Mammon
[1:14:30] which is translated as riches so who's
[1:14:33] your who's your God is it God or is it
[1:14:37] riches who do you serve God or money and
[1:14:42] Paul says you either yield yourself
[1:14:45] that's why God has to send people to
[1:14:47] hell because they yield themselves to
[1:14:49] love Mammon or money or pleasures Paul
[1:14:55] says your human soul your will is what
[1:14:58] yields to either one or two masters
[1:15:01] right the white dog or the black dog
[1:15:04] Romans 613 neither yield ye your members
[1:15:08] as instruments of unrighteousness unto
[1:15:10] sin but yield yourselves unto God as
[1:15:14] those that are alive from the dead
[1:15:16] praise God and your members as
[1:15:19] instruments of righteousness unto God
[1:15:23] praise the Lord if you yield to God with
[1:15:27] all your strength and love through God's
[1:15:30] love in your heart you will achieve
[1:15:33] godliness praise God that's what Jesus
[1:15:36] said give me all your strength
[1:15:38] give me all your mind give me everything
[1:15:40] that's the first command and you'll be
[1:15:43] like God praise God amen all right I go
[1:15:47] a little bit further here I got about 10
[1:15:49] minutes Lord willing
[1:15:56] okay yeah I wanna yeah I'll close with
[1:15:59] this this is a really good thought as
[1:16:02] far as I believe in other words I
[1:16:03] believe was from the Lord not because
[1:16:04] I'm saying it but because it's from the
[1:16:07] Lord
[1:16:07] I found this through the concordance but
[1:16:11] this is true there are two types of
[1:16:14] godliness
[1:16:15] which is why godliness is called a great
[1:16:18] mystery you say Oh what do you mean let
[1:16:25] me give you another example there are
[1:16:28] two kinds of fillings of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:31] that's a thought that came to me today
[1:16:33] allows for apparent WS Oh what do you
[1:16:36] mean they might they might question and
[1:16:38] say what do you mean there's there
[1:16:39] there's two kinds of godliness well let
[1:16:43] me ask you are there two kinds of
[1:16:45] fillings or not yes of course they're
[1:16:48] hard there's a feeling of the human
[1:16:50] spirit right which is what Bezalel had
[1:16:56] Amos remember different people had it
[1:16:59] John the Baptist had the filling of the
[1:17:02] Holy Spirit in his mother's womb
[1:17:04] Elizabeth Zacharias
[1:17:07] so see just like there's two kinds of
[1:17:09] fillings there's two kinds of godliness
[1:17:13] and if you're a spiritual and catching
[1:17:16] it those two kinds of fillings are part
[1:17:18] of the mystery of the baptism with all
[1:17:21] the guns the re4 he's God see that so
[1:17:27] whenever there's some confusion you know
[1:17:29] there must be a mystery laying there two
[1:17:32] kinds of fillings two kinds of godliness
[1:17:36] two kinds of Christians there it is
[1:17:38] right there amen
[1:17:39] wise and foolish praise God amen
[1:17:42] hallelujah
[1:17:44] beautiful there's two kinds of faith
[1:17:47] right there's a human faith there's
[1:17:49] divine faith
[1:17:51] oh thank you Jesus praise God I felt
[1:17:55] that was just such an inspired thought
[1:17:56] because it wasn't me but the Holy Spirit
[1:17:59] directed me back to the word
[1:18:03] so the first godliness is what we
[1:18:06] started with is the godliness Jesus
[1:18:08] Christ had as he obeyed every word of
[1:18:11] God in other words the mature loyal
[1:18:14] faithful godliness that Jesus Christ
[1:18:17] embodied and this godliness comes after
[1:18:23] you're born again so you have to to
[1:18:25] godliness or to two part forms of God
[1:18:29] this one is after you're born again
[1:18:32] justification say invocation Baptist
[1:18:34] only goes born again the other one is
[1:18:36] before you're born again right just like
[1:18:39] you have one filling in your mind and
[1:18:41] another feeling in your soul
[1:18:44] thank the Lord God is so good god is so
[1:18:47] good so well so we'll start with the
[1:18:54] mystery of godliness
[1:18:55] as far as Jesus is godliness the great
[1:18:59] mystery of godliness well that's what we
[1:19:03] see first now the second type is before
[1:19:06] you're born again it's a smaller initial
[1:19:09] anointing of the Holy Spirit then you're
[1:19:12] gonna find out each one of these faith
[1:19:13] virtue knowledge each one is just a
[1:19:15] little more anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:17] so they're no more because the Bible
[1:19:19] calls it measures so we're going to go
[1:19:22] through that each one is more anointed
[1:19:25] the Holy Spirit now here's here's a
[1:19:30] great mystery - you can have a great
[1:19:35] anointing on you Church and you and I
[1:19:36] know them but if we say the wrong thing
[1:19:39] or think the wrong thing that anointing
[1:19:40] leaves we're right here and it's like we
[1:19:42] got to start all over again right you
[1:19:45] got to confess your sins get your mind
[1:19:47] back on the Lord and then pretty soon
[1:19:48] that anointing you come right back to
[1:19:50] you so the
[1:19:58] second godliness is before you're born
[1:20:00] again it's the sixth step on Peters
[1:20:03] process on the steps to becoming a
[1:20:07] born-again Christian yeah Peter and Paul
[1:20:21] devote a lot of writing of course Paul
[1:20:24] because he wrote more letters Paul wrote
[1:20:27] a lot more about this mature form of
[1:20:30] godliness yeah let's just read a couple
[1:20:42] more scriptures so Lydia so Lydia if you
[1:20:50] can get first Timothy 4:7 now guys you
[1:20:57] can get second Peter 3:11 so we want to
[1:21:02] look at how both Peter and Paul these
[1:21:06] are the men you know Peter had the keys
[1:21:07] of the kingdom Paul at the dispensation
[1:21:10] of the Gentiles right Peter had the
[1:21:12] dispensation to the Jews or the ministry
[1:21:16] to the Jews this the ministry to the
[1:21:19] circumcision pi had the ministry to the
[1:21:21] non circumcision so let's let's look at
[1:21:25] Paul's words then Timothy then we'll
[1:21:28] finish with the Lord Jesus so Lydia is
[1:21:32] going to read first Timothy 4:7 so the
[1:21:37] doing okay
[1:21:46] so Paul said exercise yourself unto
[1:21:50] godliness now here's where the lazy
[1:21:51] Christian in all of us has to be
[1:21:54] crucified I've said this before I'll say
[1:21:58] it again but most people that don't
[1:21:59] exercise naturally they have a hard time
[1:22:02] exercising spiritually right because the
[1:22:06] the mind body and soul are
[1:22:10] interconnected
[1:22:11] and so a lot of times not every time a
[1:22:14] lot of times people that don't keep
[1:22:17] their body strong they get a weak body
[1:22:20] because they got a week's human spirit
[1:22:22] and they're not disciplined up here
[1:22:24] because they're not disciplined here
[1:22:27] they can't be disciplined down in their
[1:22:29] spiritual life right or in their
[1:22:32] physical body and we know brother
[1:22:34] Branham got plenty of exercise when he
[1:22:36] would preach you know there's a great
[1:22:38] strain on him preaching then going to
[1:22:41] hunt and walk for miles and miles and
[1:22:43] miles and climb mountains climb climb
[1:22:48] down and up valleys right hills valleys
[1:22:51] he did get a lot of exercise so Paul
[1:22:56] says we got to exercise this there's two
[1:22:59] kinds and if we want not really both of
[1:23:02] them
[1:23:02] you gotta exercise for but it's gonna
[1:23:04] take exercise in other words gonna take
[1:23:06] self crucifixion like Jesus said okay so
[1:23:11] Malachi can you read second Peter 3 a
[1:23:14] good read 1112 please what manner of
[1:23:21] persons ought you to be in all holy
[1:23:23] conversation and godliness looking for
[1:23:26] in haste and to the coming of the day of
[1:23:28] God wherein the heavens being on fire
[1:23:30] should be dissolved now look at this
[1:23:35] church Peters using fire to motivate us
[1:23:40] he said because we know there's a fire
[1:23:43] coming it's gonna burn the earth he said
[1:23:45] what manner of person should we be we
[1:23:48] know Christ is coming back before the
[1:23:49] fire well what kind of person should we
[1:23:51] be in all holy conversation and
[1:23:54] godliness
[1:23:55] we need warnings here's the man with the
[1:23:57] keys of the kingdom and he's warning
[1:23:59] them if you know fires coming in Jesus
[1:24:01] is coming to rescue us from the fire
[1:24:04] let's live a godly let's exercise
[1:24:06] ourselves in all holy conversation and
[1:24:10] godliness in other words let's act like
[1:24:13] Christ is coming and we want to escape
[1:24:16] the fire praise God
[1:24:21] so
[1:24:23] both apostles are pointing us to mature
[1:24:25] godliness and we must not miss that it's
[1:24:32] this godliness that will close like this
[1:24:33] like Christ godliness because Jesus said
[1:24:37] in John 5:19 he said I do nothing of
[1:24:42] myself but what I see the father do and
[1:24:49] this is so important for godliness Jesus
[1:24:52] kept growing in godliness because he
[1:24:54] would only do what the father showed him
[1:24:57] to do so he waited on everything he
[1:24:59] waited for the right time waited for the
[1:25:01] right season and as we approach a mature
[1:25:07] godliness we must do only the actions
[1:25:11] that God leads us to that's a big
[1:25:13] statement I know that we all wrestle
[1:25:15] with it but that's where we got to grow
[1:25:17] towards that Christ even only spoke the
[1:25:21] words God gave him John 8:38 says I
[1:25:25] speak that which I have seen with my
[1:25:28] father all right so let's stand here
[1:25:34] we'll finish with that by God's grace
[1:25:43] this thing that created me a clean heart
[1:25:46] O God brother amen when to sing that a
[1:25:47] couple weeks ago just kind of came to my
[1:25:50] mind here what a message and I'm not
[1:26:01] saying that's me I'm saying nuts the
[1:26:03] Word of God
[1:26:06] we're taking the same under the Holy
[1:26:09] Spirit that brother branham use once he
[1:26:11] saw supernatural visitations from
[1:26:15] visions and angels this Holy Spirit
[1:26:19] directed him to the word so we have to
[1:26:21] look at it every time the Bible uses
[1:26:23] godliness find out what it means so
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:38] let's pray I think so thoughts that kind
[1:26:44] of way on my mind are our habits and
[1:26:48] exercise are we exercising as
[1:26:51] spiritually
[1:26:52] are we taking up the cross daily what
[1:26:58] kind of habits are we developing I mean
[1:27:00] something you do every day many times we
[1:27:10] don't have to have it because we're not
[1:27:12] in love like we should be left our first
[1:27:15] love the cross cross of Jesus doesn't
[1:27:20] impact us like it should the
[1:27:23] resurrection doesn't amaze us like it
[1:27:26] should the member the Holy Ghost sheds
[1:27:31] his love abroad in our hearts and then
[1:27:35] faith works by that love so let's have a
[1:27:43] word of Prayer here let's ask God to
[1:27:47] created us a clean heart heart full of
[1:27:51] love for Jesus
[1:27:54] I will motivate our actions tonight
[1:27:57] because number every action you do it
[1:28:00] because you love something cutter Mammon
[1:28:06] now to herself holiness or the world
[1:28:11] it's all motivated by the that's that's
[1:28:14] powerful scripture here
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:30:01] created us a clean heart a heart that is
[1:30:05] full of your love agape love the Lord in
[1:30:13] the great debate is it who works or
[1:30:15] faith we know it's faith but love
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:19] motivates our faith and faith goes to
[1:30:23] work or Jesus bless your people tonight
[1:30:29] they've sat through your word and been a
[1:30:31] faithful audience North Mountain I pray
[1:30:34] in Jesus name Lord God it have new
[1:30:37] hearts tonight hearts full of love
[1:30:39] they'd be so impressed with the cross so
[1:30:42] impressed with the resurrection that
[1:30:44] they'd want to take up their cross and
[1:30:48] follow you wherever you lead them deer
[1:30:52] gun I thought of thoughtful you love the
[1:30:55] flower lead or develop the most godly
[1:30:57] habits I want more anointing gear gun
[1:31:01] would you to add more portion in my life
[1:31:04] more measure of your Holy Spirit I know
[1:31:08] it's a slow process then they grow in
[1:31:10] favor with God and man each person in
[1:31:14] our church those that don't have a home
[1:31:17] church may we fear God
[1:31:21] keep your commands ro and wisdom forgive
[1:31:32] your people they have developed bad
[1:31:34] habits Lord God let me take up their
[1:31:37] cross and die daily Lord God through
[1:31:40] love you asked us to do it with all of

[1:31:58] lives transform their minds by the
[1:32:00] renewing of their minds Lord may they
[1:32:02] see their habits may I see my habits
[1:32:07] each one of us may we see our habits
[1:32:10] being exercised becoming more and more
