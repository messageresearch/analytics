[0:00] Amen. If it wasn't for him, where would
[0:02] we be? Amen. Amen. And
[0:05] uh it's because of him we gather on
[0:09] nights like this. Amen. And we just
[0:12] appreciate him so much. Let's just um
[0:14] bow our heads and we'll get right into
[0:16] the word of God by the grace of God.
[0:18] Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we
[0:21] love you tonight and we thank you for
[0:22] the mercy that you've given us, Lord
[0:25] God. And we know that it's unmmerited.
[0:27] Lord, it's favor from on high. Lord, we
[0:29] know that there's nothing we've done,
[0:31] Lord, but you put a seed inside of us,
[0:34] Lord, and you have to be obligated to
[0:38] that seed of life, Lord, because that
[0:40] very seed reflects who you are and what
[0:43] you are and everything about you, Lord.
[0:44] And we know, Lord God, that your
[0:46] reputation is on the line concerning
[0:48] your children, concerning our lives,
[0:51] Father. So, you make sure, Lord God,
[0:53] that we're protected, Lord. And Father,
[0:55] you're forever faithful, Lord. You're
[0:57] forever on time. Amen. Lord, we just
[0:58] pray that tonight, Lord, you guide and
[1:01] lead us, Lord, as the words of truth
[1:02] come forth, Lord. Let the gifts of God,
[1:05] Lord, be expressed, Lord, through the
[1:06] pulling of the word. Yes. Lord God, and
[1:09] let the edifying of the Holy Spirit be
[1:11] among us today, Lord. Bless both speaker
[1:14] and hearer in the wonderful name of
[1:16] Jesus Christ, we pray. And church, say,
[1:17] "Amen."
[1:19] Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[1:22] let's turn to Genesis chapter 15.
[1:31] Genesis chapter 15 and we'll go to 2
[1:34] Corinthians
[1:38] 5.
[1:43] Genesis 15 and 2 Corinthians
[1:47] chapter
[1:49] 5. Praise the Lord. How many glad to be
[1:51] in church tonight?
[1:54] Praise the Lord.
[2:04] Amen. Let's um let's let's start reading
[2:08] at uh verse
[2:11] 4. Genesis
[2:13] 15 and 4. The Bible says, "And behold,
[2:19] the word of the Lord came unto him,
[2:21] saying, Thus shall not be thine heir,
[2:24] but he that shall come forth out of
[2:27] thine own bowels shall be thine heir."
[2:31] And he brought him forth abroad, and
[2:34] said, Look now towards heaven, and tell
[2:38] the stars, if thou be able to number
[2:40] them. And he said unto him, So shall thy
[2:44] seed be. and he believed in the Lord and
[2:48] he counted it to him for righteousness.
[2:53] Amen. Second Corinthians chapter
[2:56] 5, just want to read a verse out of
[2:58] here, verse
[3:00] 7, the Bible says, "For we walk by
[3:03] faith, not by sight."
[3:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. You can have your
[3:08] seats.
[3:13] I'm sure you know uh we've all heard
[3:17] plenty of messages and um teachings on
[3:22] faith you know and just the thought of
[3:25] faith is very important because the
[3:27] Bible says without faith it is
[3:29] impossible to please the Lord. And then
[3:32] the scripture says faith is the
[3:33] substance of things hoped for the
[3:35] evidence of things not seen. So as a
[3:39] believer uh it's very important to
[3:42] believe beyond the natural eye. Amen.
[3:46] You know, but that's our challenge. Our
[3:48] challenge is Amen. living a life in a
[3:51] realm of things that we cannot see.
[3:54] Because that's where the goodness of God
[3:56] is. That's where the grace of God is.
[3:58] See, even right now, I could ask you,
[4:00] show me some love, and you would have to
[4:02] demonstrate that. But you couldn't give
[4:04] me a handful of love. Right. See, that's
[4:07] that's in a that's in an atmosphere of
[4:09] faith. Hallelujah. And so are so many of
[4:12] the attributes of God. They're in an
[4:15] unseen realm. So when we say we walk by
[4:18] faith, not by sight, faith, hallelujah,
[4:22] is something that God gives us to
[4:24] believe in him.
[4:26] But faith is not therefore what you can
[4:29] prove with your natural eye. If you can
[4:32] prove it with your natural eye, it's not
[4:34] faith. Hallelujah.
[4:35] So, so God wants us to live beyond what
[4:39] we can see. Hallelujah. And we know that
[4:42] the prophet of God said faith, amen, is
[4:45] a revelation. And once something is
[4:48] revealed to you, it can't be taken away.
[4:51] You know, so as I look right here in the
[4:53] scriptures and I look at this, you know,
[4:56] we think about Abraham. Abraham was
[4:58] what? Called the father of faith. Amen.
[5:02] He was called the father of faith. You
[5:05] know, so we are the children of faith if
[5:08] we come from Abraham's seed. So you take
[5:12] Abraham in the scriptures we read right
[5:14] here and and tonight my my subject is
[5:17] faith beyond circumstances. Hallelujah.
[5:20] Faith beyond circumstances. See church,
[5:24] we got to have a faith that pushes us
[5:27] beyond this natural realm, this natural
[5:29] place. But we look right here in in
[5:32] Genesis chapter 15. You know, uh
[5:35] Abraham, he had a son named Ishmael.
[5:40] But Ishmael was a product of them, uh uh
[5:43] Abraham and Sarahi and Hagar, all of
[5:46] them getting together saying, "Hey,
[5:48] we're going to make the promise of God
[5:49] come to pass." That's not faith.
[5:52] Hallelujah. Faith is not you doing
[5:55] something per se to say, "I'mma make
[5:57] this happen." No. Faith is believing
[6:00] what God said. And standing on the
[6:03] promise. Hallelujah. But you know, uh,
[6:05] Abraham and and Sarah and Hagar, they
[6:07] got together and they produced an
[6:09] Ishmael, which we know that the prophet
[6:11] of God in the Bible said he was a wild
[6:13] man. And then now he's Abraham is
[6:16] standing here with this child and per
[6:18] se. He's like, "Lord, I did it. We we
[6:21] have a child, but God's like, no, that's
[6:24] not your heir."
[6:26] Hallelujah. I said you and Sarah were
[6:30] going to have a child. Not you and
[6:32] Hagar. You and Sarah. How often do God
[6:36] gives us promises and we try to make it
[6:38] happen our way? And God brings
[6:41] everything to a halt.
[6:45] Why does he bring it to a halt? Because
[6:47] he doesn't want your reasoning or your
[6:50] wisdom. He wants your faith. Hallelujah.
[6:53] So in this moment, he brings everything
[6:55] to a halt. There's a child, hallelujah,
[6:58] of Abraham's seed, but it's not a child
[7:01] of Abraham's promise. Hallelujah. See,
[7:04] so that's the kind of faith we want. We
[7:06] want a faith that can produce the
[7:08] promises of God. Hallelujah. So God
[7:11] comes and he says, "Hey, see, why did
[7:14] Abraham and Sarah and Hagar produce
[7:17] Ishmael?" It was because of the
[7:19] circumstances.
[7:21] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[7:23] Hallelujah.
[7:24] It was because of what they saw. It
[7:26] because of what they physically knew in
[7:29] the natural realm. In the natural realm,
[7:32] Sarah was old. She has produced the the
[7:35] the time and the age of childbearing.
[7:38] So, she looked at herself and she said,
[7:40] "My, with these circumstances, how am I
[7:43] ever going to produce a child?"
[7:45] Hallelujah. What I love about God, God,
[7:49] God, oh my God, speak a word in our
[7:54] lives knowing we don't believe it yet.
[8:00] Boy, that's heavy, ain't it? He's so
[8:03] sure of his word. He's so sure that
[8:07] it'll come to pass. He'll tell you
[8:09] something that he's going to do in your
[8:11] life knowing you don't believe it yet.
[8:15] My What does that mean? That mean God
[8:18] has faith in you. Hallelujah. Not only
[8:21] faith in you, but he has faith in
[8:23] himself. Hallelujah. So God can speak a
[8:25] word knowing we don't believe it and
[8:28] he'll just sit back and put everything
[8:30] in position to make it come to pass. God
[8:34] protects his own promises. God protects
[8:38] his own word. God is not concerned about
[8:42] the circumstances in your life.
[8:47] Hallelujah.
[8:49] And you know, sometimes the
[8:51] circumstances causes us to back away
[8:53] from God. Many of people are not in
[8:55] church today because they're blaming
[8:58] their circumstances.
[9:00] You think God didn't know what your life
[9:02] was going to be. You think God didn't
[9:05] know the challenges of your life. You
[9:07] think God didn't know the different
[9:09] storms that were going to come.
[9:11] Hallelujah. He allows those things. Why?
[9:14] to unlock faith.
[9:18] Hallelujah.
[9:21] I've been saying as of late, Hallelujah.
[9:23] Brother, if you don't mind, can you can
[9:24] you give me the other water? I don't I
[9:26] don't want to open another fresh
[9:28] one. I've been saying as of late,
[9:31] Hallelujah. that we say, "Lord, increase
[9:34] my faith. Lord, give me more faith.
[9:37] Lord, I I I I want I want you to
[9:39] increase my faith for the situation."
[9:42] Yes. It don't work like that.
[9:46] It don't work like that. God could never
[9:51] increase your faith
[9:54] because for God to come and increase
[9:57] something he gave you that mean he
[9:59] didn't give you enough.
[10:02] So how could he be God and do something
[10:04] in your life that's incomplete?
[10:08] That's totally against his character.
[10:10] That's totally against him being
[10:12] infinite. Hallelujah. So God doesn't
[10:15] increase our faith. God unlocks our
[10:18] faith. See church. Hallelujah. God can't
[10:21] come back and add to you more faith. He
[10:24] has to give you everything you need when
[10:27] you were created.
[10:30] Oh hallelujah. Church. He didn't have to
[10:33] come back and add to Adam. Adam was a
[10:36] God when he created him. He was in his
[10:38] image and he was likeness and all
[10:40] creation obeyed him as long as
[10:42] hallelujah he had the nature and
[10:44] character of God. Hallelujah. So we come
[10:48] you say Lord give me more faith. Give me
[10:50] more faith he can't do it. Hallelujah.
[10:53] You say why my brother Dicks you know in
[10:55] some areas he said oh ye of little
[10:57] faith. He said in some areas you know uh
[11:00] where is your faith? And then he said in
[11:02] some areas I've never seen such faith.
[11:05] Yes. But he never in those situations
[11:07] say, "Hey, stand over here
[11:10] and I've added faith to you."
[11:16] God doesn't operate like that. H I'll
[11:19] make it even more plain. You take a
[11:21] farmer. When a farmer goes and let's
[11:24] just say apples, we all know apples,
[11:25] right? I like apples. Hallelujah. Full
[11:27] of fiber. Good for your sister. Amen.
[11:30] You know, uh apples come in different
[11:32] colors. Red
[11:37] Let me help you out a little bit.
[11:43] Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Apples come
[11:46] in red.
[11:48] Apples come in green.
[11:51] And apples come in yellow.
[11:54] But no matter which color they come in,
[11:56] it's still an apple. So, let's just say
[11:59] I was a farmer. Hallelujah. Hey, the
[12:01] reason why I hold that up because this
[12:03] is not an insurance
[12:04] seminar. If you know the word, Amen, the
[12:07] word. Hallelujah. If you know what I'm
[12:09] speaking is truth. Amen. The truth.
[12:11] Hallelujah. A lot of times, that's why
[12:13] we don't make a connection in church
[12:15] because we're somewhere in space.
[12:17] Hallelujah. Show God you understand what
[12:19] he's talking about. Hallelujah. Show be
[12:22] like Haderite. Had it sitting there
[12:24] listening. She She wasn't there to
[12:26] experience anything, but she believed
[12:28] it. Hallelujah. And just her saying that
[12:31] ain't nothing but the truth. God came
[12:33] down and say give her whatever she want.
[12:36] Because of her faith, believing in what
[12:38] I did in your life, I'mma give her
[12:41] something special for her life.
[12:44] Gotcha.
[12:46] Oh. Oh my. But you think that farmer,
[12:49] let's just say the farmer says, "Hey, I
[12:52] want to plant me some red gayla apples."
[12:54] Hallelujah. So what he does is he go get
[12:57] a seed. Hallelujah. per se with the
[13:00] characteristics of red gayla apples. So
[13:03] what does he do when that seed the seed
[13:05] might not even be red? Nine times out of
[13:08] 10 it's brown. Hallelujah. Now you
[13:10] explain that to me. Hallelujah. How you
[13:12] going to get red apples out of a brown
[13:14] seed?
[13:16] Why? We can't understand God with our
[13:19] own wisdom. It's by faith.
[13:22] Hallelujah, church. And then he calls
[13:24] you. You you say you say, "Okay, he gets
[13:26] gay ables get the seed and he plants
[13:29] it." Hallelujah. He plants it in dirt.
[13:31] Hallelujah. And he waits. What does he
[13:34] do? He waits by faith. Hallelujah. He
[13:39] can't make that seed grow. That's right.
[13:41] There's certain laws of faith that has
[13:44] to take place in order for that seed to
[13:46] grow. Laws that the farmer can't
[13:49] control. H There's a law in the sun
[13:51] that's connected to that seed.
[13:54] So what the farmer has to do, he has to
[13:56] stand back and to rely on faith that the
[13:59] son is going to do his job.
[14:02] [Applause]
[14:03] Hallelujah. God puts certain things in
[14:06] your way that'll come in contact with
[14:08] you that he knows by faith it will
[14:11] unlock something in your life.
[14:15] Hallelujah.
[14:17] God is a lover. He doesn't make us do
[14:20] anything. He just puts us in connection
[14:23] where whatever's in us will start to
[14:26] come out. Hallelujah.
[14:28] Hallelujah. The son, hey, the farmer
[14:31] doesn't say, "Now, son, I want you to do
[14:33] your job now. I I'm planting a seed and
[14:36] you better shine like you've never shine
[14:38] before." No. Hallelujah. The sun has a
[14:41] reputation.
[14:42] [Applause]
[14:46] Hallelujah.
[14:48] The sun has a reputation of what it can
[14:51] do when the seed gets in contact with
[14:54] it.
[14:55] And you think about our God, the S o n,
[14:58] he has a reputation of what'll happen in
[15:01] your seed if you ever get in contact
[15:04] with him.
[15:07] So, first things first, hallelujah. The
[15:10] farmer can't look at the conditions.
[15:13] That's right. What kind of sense does it
[15:15] make if you uh uh you just you just
[15:17] think about the way we were raised? Now,
[15:19] we believe these things because we've
[15:20] seen it happen. But you take a farmer
[15:22] say, "Hey, I want apples. So, first
[15:24] thing I'm going to do, I'm going to
[15:25] plant this seed in some
[15:29] dirt. It seemed like we shouldn't be
[15:33] able to get anything out of dirt." Amen.
[15:37] But dirt is the start of the process.
[15:40] Hallelujah. Dirt is the whole thing that
[15:43] gets it going. Get what going? The
[15:45] unveiling, the unlocking of life.
[15:48] Hallelujah.
[15:50] And it's because of the dirt.
[15:52] Hallelujah. That's in our life.
[15:54] Hallelujah. That brought Christ on the
[15:56] scene to be a redeemer. Hallelujah. So,
[15:58] it was those circumstances, hallelujah,
[16:01] that brought God on the scene to bring
[16:03] us out of our circumstances.
[16:07] Hallelujah.
[16:08] So, so, so it's all right. Hallelujah.
[16:11] If you got a little dirt in your life,
[16:13] we all got dirt in our life. But look at
[16:15] here. That seed doesn't remain in the
[16:17] dirt, though.
[16:19] [Applause]
[16:20] G.
[16:22] Hallelujah. So, God's not calling us to
[16:25] remain as a sinner or have a dirty life
[16:28] of filthy thoughts. No, he want us to
[16:30] come out of the dirt. How do you get out
[16:32] of the dirt? You got to grow.
[16:35] Hallelujah.
[16:37] Hallelujah. Oh my, I feel my helper
[16:40] coming on. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank
[16:44] you, Jesus. How do we get out of the
[16:46] dirt? We start to feel the presence of
[16:49] the sun.
[16:52] But we have to get out of a stage of
[16:53] being cold, stale, and dry. Hallelujah.
[16:57] There are some things that unlock that
[16:59] seed, the sun, but also water, moisture.
[17:02] Amen. Being sensitive to your
[17:04] surroundings. Amen. As all these things
[17:06] starts to happen, life starts to come
[17:09] forth. But look at here. The farmer
[17:11] doesn't say, "Okay, now water. I'm going
[17:13] to sprinkle you and I want you to do
[17:15] your job." No. He trusts that it will do
[17:19] what it's supposed to do by faith.
[17:25] Yes, sir. He doesn't dig it up three
[17:28] weeks later and say, "Are you growing
[17:29] yet?" No.
[17:31] He plants it and he steps back and he
[17:34] waits. Hallelujah. Because he knows if
[17:39] the atmosphere is right. Amen. He knows
[17:42] if the sun is doing its job, if the
[17:45] season is right, if the rain is coming.
[17:47] Hallelujah. That seed ain't got no
[17:50] choice but to come forth.
[17:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that's what
[17:55] God has done to us. He's put us in place
[17:58] where we can come in contact with all
[18:01] the things we need to bring forth life.
[18:04] Hallelujah. G. But I say that I say all
[18:07] that to say this. You think about that
[18:09] farmer. You say, "I want red gaya
[18:10] apples." And now the apples are starting
[18:13] to come out of the ground. And the plant
[18:16] tree is what? Green.
[18:22] Ain't nothing resembling red yet.
[18:25] Started out brown.
[18:27] Now it's growing and it's green.
[18:31] This thing of of of life and unlocking
[18:34] is so difficult.
[18:37] If you're trying to believe with
[18:39] intellectual faith,
[18:42] if you're trying to understand this with
[18:44] your own mind of reasoning. Hallelujah.
[18:47] See, reasoning says I can never get red
[18:50] out of brown or red out of green. That's
[18:53] right. Amen. Amen. But it's the life of
[18:57] the seed. Hallelujah. And we can't see
[19:00] that with our natural eyes. Hallelujah.
[19:03] So he plants it. Hallelujah. Now you
[19:05] think about how steadf Oh, I feel good
[19:07] tonight. You think about how steadfast
[19:11] in what the farmer believes he has to
[19:13] be. Amen. Depending on what he's seeing
[19:17] now. He had a handful of brown seeds.
[19:19] Put it in the ground. It starts to grow
[19:22] in dirt. Hallelujah. It starts to grow
[19:25] in dirt. And as it's growing,
[19:26] hallelujah, those red apples he want,
[19:29] the tree is green.
[19:33] Yes, sir. We walk by faith,
[19:35] not by sight. Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:40] See, the Bible says, "Every seed brings
[19:43] forth of its own kind whose seed is in
[19:46] itself." Hallelujah. So the red apples
[19:50] is in that seed. The seed just has to be
[19:53] planted. Hallelujah. So as he planted,
[19:56] Hallelujah. See, God doesn't want us to
[19:59] be confused. God just want us to
[20:01] believe. What normally makes us confused
[20:04] when we try to figure it out with our
[20:06] own human ability.
[20:10] When we try to figure it out with our
[20:11] own human ability. Now you tell me how
[20:14] brown seeds bring forth a green branch.
[20:17] Amen.
[20:20] I have no idea.
[20:22] All I know is it is a law of God.
[20:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. It's a law
[20:30] of God. And what I love about it, it'll
[20:32] come forth without my help.
[20:37] Hallelujah. That seed will produce of
[20:40] its own kind without my help. All it
[20:43] needs is the right conditions.
[20:46] Hallelujah.
[20:49] All we need is the right conditions and
[20:52] we'll bring forth what God put inside
[20:54] this seed,
[20:58] church. So that that that that just to
[21:00] show you that God I'm I'm going back to
[21:02] this uh Lord like we say Lord give me
[21:05] more faith now we look Hallelujah. And I
[21:08] said by the grace of God he can't do it.
[21:11] I stand to be corrected but that's my
[21:12] understanding. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[21:15] Yes, sir. Cuz in many things I've seen
[21:17] the Lord do, I never felt like I had
[21:19] more faith for a different situation.
[21:22] Amen. Yes, sir. I never felt like I had
[21:24] more faith. I felt like it was the same
[21:26] faith. Hallelujah. Just a different
[21:28] situation. Hallelujah. Because look,
[21:32] church, you take that man, he plant the
[21:34] seed, it's brown, it's coming up green.
[21:36] But then what I love, the prophet of God
[21:38] said, hallelujah, every bushel,
[21:43] everything that it would ever produce is
[21:46] in it when it's that big on the ground.
[21:48] Hallelujah.
[21:50] I want to say this to you. Hallelujah.
[21:53] In a baby stage, Hallelujah. Every
[21:55] prayer, every victory that you ever have
[21:58] is in you when you a baby.
[22:02] Hallelujah. Every triumph, hallelujah,
[22:05] every conquering of the trial, amen,
[22:08] every testimony, hallelujah, is in you
[22:11] when you say, hallelujah, I accept the
[22:13] Lord Jesus Christ as my savior.
[22:16] Hallelujah. Every victory is in you
[22:19] right now.
[22:22] And there's no circumstance that can
[22:25] stop that. Hallelujah.
[22:29] Amen. Glory.
[22:32] Yes, sir. Think about that, church. We
[22:33] got things we praying about, right?
[22:40] [Applause]
[22:42] We got things we praying about. We got
[22:45] things we won't we won't we want to see
[22:47] God do.
[22:49] Well, I'm telling you, the victory is
[22:51] already in you.
[22:55] Hallelujah. The testimony is already in
[22:57] you.
[23:00] Okay. The tree is growing now. It's
[23:03] green.
[23:05] Hallelujah. One thing that farmer
[23:07] doesn't do because he can't add to the
[23:10] seed. Amen.
[23:14] He doesn't come and I I know my sister
[23:16] Smith, she don't like these kind of
[23:18] things. I know. Hallelujah. That farmer
[23:21] doesn't go get some red
[23:23] 20. Hallelujah. Or some yellow number
[23:26] five. Hallelujah. And pour it on that
[23:31] Yes, sir.
[23:33] Hallelujah. That's one of our private
[23:36] jokes. He doesn't he he he doesn't go
[23:39] get some some red 20 or some yellow
[23:41] number five and pour it on that tree and
[23:44] say, "Okay, my now it's red." Go get
[23:47] some red food coloring and pour it on
[23:49] there and say, "Okay, it's going to
[23:50] produce red." No, that would be adding
[23:54] to it.
[23:56] That would be adding to it. Hallelujah.
[23:58] How many of you ever seen a farmer push
[24:01] out some coloring on his tree? No. The
[24:04] apples just come out red. Why? Because
[24:06] it's already inside of it. It's a part
[24:09] of it. Hallelujah. He doesn't have to
[24:12] whether it's green, whether it's yellow,
[24:14] he doesn't have to come and put some
[24:16] coloring or hook up some some some
[24:18] sprinklers and spray it over the whole
[24:20] crop.
[24:22] I want yellow
[24:24] apples. Sh. No. It's already in there.
[24:30] Hallelujah.
[24:32] I'm saying to you tonight, the victory
[24:35] you're looking for is already in there.
[24:40] I ain't going to be long. I'm about to
[24:42] close. Hallelujah. But church,
[24:44] hallelujah. That farmer, he doesn't come
[24:46] and add to that tree, add to that crop.
[24:50] Everything that he's believing it to be
[24:52] is in it when he planted. Amen.
[24:56] Therefore, I'm saying no matter what we
[24:58] going through, God doesn't have to come
[25:00] and add faith to us. The faith we need
[25:03] is in us is the trial unlocking what we
[25:06] need.
[25:08] [Applause]
[25:09] Hallelujah. What's the difference
[25:11] between adding to and unlocking?
[25:14] Unlocking means that it takes a key.
[25:16] Hallelujah.
[25:18] Hallelujah. Unlocking mean it takes a
[25:21] key. What is the key? The key is faith
[25:24] that unlocks the door. Hallelujah. And
[25:26] once your faith can unlock it, you have
[25:29] access.
[25:31] [Music]
[25:32] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That's right.
[25:35] Yes, sir. Faith is the key that that
[25:37] that unlocks the door. But then Christ
[25:40] comes and says, "I'm the door."
[25:45] My So your faith should be in who?
[25:48] Christ.
[25:50] [Applause]
[25:52] Oh my. But church, as I looked at this,
[25:56] I began to think about, you know,
[25:59] circumstances and faith to believe
[26:02] beyond the circumstances. We walk by
[26:03] faith and not by sight. Y'all know as a
[26:07] Christian, I want to say 99% of our life
[26:11] should be walking by faith.
[26:13] Amen. Amen.
[26:16] Cuz the Bible says we're what? pilgrims
[26:18] and strangers down here. Amen. So there
[26:21] there shouldn't be something in us that
[26:23] settles down. Hallelujah. To stay here.
[26:27] He see the seed of Abraham. What was
[26:29] Abraham? The Bible said Abraham was
[26:31] looking for a city. Hallelujah.
[26:34] Hallelujah.
[26:36] It wasn't Egypt.
[26:39] It wasn't Canaan. Hallelujah.
[26:42] Hallelujah. It wasn't It wasn't
[26:44] Ethiopia. Hallelujah. He was it wasn't
[26:47] it wasn't Israel. He He wasn't looking
[26:48] for those places. He was looking for a
[26:51] place whose builder and maker was who?
[26:54] God.
[26:56] So he was living in a place that the
[26:59] natural eye couldn't see.
[27:03] Hallelujah.
[27:05] Amen. And so is you and I. Or so are you
[27:09] and I.
[27:12] We should be living in a place as a
[27:14] Christian. Hallelujah. Yes. Amen. An
[27:16] unseen realm. Hallelujah. Where we
[27:20] believe all things are possible.
[27:22] Hallelujah. When bills get behind, we
[27:24] have a promise. As long as I paid my
[27:26] tithe and offering, hallelujah. I'm
[27:28] blessed.
[27:30] If you get sick, we have another
[27:32] promise. Hallelujah. A promise of faith.
[27:35] By his stripes, you were healed. Already
[27:38] healed. See, he's not adding nothing to
[27:40] us. He's already there. Healing is
[27:42] already yours.
[27:44] Amen.
[27:46] Oh Lord, give me some faith for this
[27:49] healing. He said we're healed. That
[27:51] means past tense. He's already done it.
[27:54] Hallelujah.
[27:58] He just wants us to believe.
[28:02] But we get too caught up in the
[28:03] circumstances. What do the word
[28:05] circumstances mean? Circumstance means a
[28:08] fact or condition connected with or
[28:12] relevant to an event or action.
[28:16] Now, we're going to deal with the fact
[28:18] of a matter, but I want to show you
[28:21] faith is stronger than your facts.
[28:27] The fact of Abraham's life
[28:29] was he was old,
[28:33] right, when God gave him the promise.
[28:35] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. He had no
[28:38] children. That's right. That was a fact.
[28:43] Him and Sarah had no children. That was
[28:46] a fact.
[28:48] Her womb was shut up. That was a fact.
[28:53] Hallelujah. Amen.
[28:56] She probably hadn't hit menopause
[28:58] already. That was a fact. Hallelujah.
[29:02] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. She said, she
[29:05] said, "How am I going to have pleasure
[29:07] with my Lord at this old age?" Amen.
[29:11] Hallelujah. What she was doing, she was
[29:13] looking at the circumstances, the facts
[29:16] of her life.
[29:18] So, she laughed and she said, "Oh my
[29:21] goodness." Abraham laughed first. He
[29:23] said, "Oh my goodness, God, please. My
[29:26] wife is old. I'm old. And how can we
[29:28] have pleasure? I know these things can
[29:30] happen." It's like, "God, I appreciate
[29:32] you being God, but
[29:36] And that's what we do sometimes. God
[29:39] speaks a word in your life knowing that
[29:42] you not there to believe it yet, but
[29:44] he's going to get you there.
[29:47] Hallelujah.
[29:49] Hallelujah. God's going to show you you
[29:52] got more faith than what you think.
[29:57] He's going to allow you to go through
[29:58] trials and tribulation to do what?
[30:01] Unlock more faith.
[30:03] Hallelujah.
[30:05] He lets Hallelujah. He lets him have he
[30:08] lets him
[30:09] have Ishmamail and then he put the
[30:12] brakes on that whole thought. Said,
[30:13] "Nope, that ain't what we're doing." I
[30:15] said, "You and Sarah." That's right.
[30:18] Hallelujah. You and Sarah, then they
[30:20] made the deal. Hallelujah. Hagar and
[30:22] Sarah made the deal. And then after the
[30:24] deal, Sarah got mad.
[30:28] Hallelujah. She looking at this woman
[30:30] with a child and with her husband. He
[30:32] said, "No, we ain't going over. You got
[30:33] to go. You got to get Now, that wasn't
[30:35] the plan at first." Hallelujah. See?
[30:38] Hallelujah. What does circumstances do?
[30:41] Circumstances deal with your emotions.
[30:48] Now, Sarah didn't got all emotional and
[30:50] she's like, "No, no, no. You got to go
[30:52] get out of here. You and your
[30:53] child." But God comes back. He says,
[30:56] "Okay." Abraham and Sarah, they leave
[30:58] the land. Hallelujah. But let's back up
[31:01] a little bit. Him being h the father of
[31:05] faith, God had to unlock stages of faith
[31:09] in his life to get him to perfect faith.
[31:13] Amen.
[31:16] That's what the trials are all about.
[31:19] God is producing out of you. Hallelujah.
[31:23] Himself. That's right.
[31:26] Not a partial faith, but a perfect
[31:29] faith. Hallelujah. I got a quote for
[31:31] you. The prophet of God said,
[31:32] "Hallelujah." He said, "Hallelujah. The
[31:34] world," He said, "the power, oh my, this
[31:37] is heavy. This ain't skim milk." He
[31:39] said, "The power that created the world
[31:41] is in every Holy Ghost fil believer."
[31:45] Great.
[31:49] [Music]
[31:52] Woo. So if I got the Holy Ghost, I got
[31:56] the power to create what I need.
[31:59] Talk to me, church. Isn't that what
[32:02] Abraham did? Hallelujah. When it all
[32:05] came down to it, Abraham said, "The Lord
[32:07] shall provide himself a sacrifice." And
[32:09] next thing you know,
[32:12] where did it come from? It came from
[32:14] Abraham's faith. Hallelujah. That's
[32:17] right. Out of a trial. Hallelujah.
[32:21] Oh my. But look, how did how did he get
[32:23] there? Amen. Lot got taken down in
[32:26] Sodom. Hallelujah. Abraham got 318
[32:29] servants against an army.
[32:34] But he trusted and believed that God was
[32:36] with him. Hallelujah. What was that?
[32:38] That was faith.
[32:41] So God allowed situations in his life
[32:44] that his faith could unlock. And you
[32:46] think about this man went down there
[32:47] with servants, not warriors, not an
[32:49] army. He went down there with service
[32:51] and defeated an army. Hallelujah. What
[32:54] would that do for your faith? Amen.
[33:00] Think about it. You come up against
[33:02] something that seems so big, so strong,
[33:04] and in the name of Jesus, you defeat it.
[33:06] Amen. You have no problem going into
[33:09] another battle. Amen. That's right.
[33:13] Because that trial unlocked something.
[33:17] [Applause]
[33:20] Those circumstances unlocked something.
[33:24] When it looked like he didn't have
[33:26] enough, he had more than enough. Cuz
[33:28] what was his more than enough? Faith in
[33:30] God. Amen.
[33:34] Every trial in your life, every
[33:35] situation in your life, every
[33:37] circumstance in your life should be
[33:39] unlocking a measure of faith.
[33:43] Amen.
[33:47] But you look at all the things Abraham,
[33:51] you take that. Hallelujah. Go down there
[33:53] and get lot. Hallelujah. Unlock
[33:56] something. Him and Sarah go down into
[33:59] Aimilec. I may not be saying this in
[34:01] order, but it goes down to Aimilec.
[34:03] Aimilec sees Sarah said, "Man, I got to
[34:05] have her." Abraham said, "Hey, hey, hey,
[34:07] hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, girl, you
[34:09] looking good now."
[34:12] See,
[34:13] look, he was so caught up in the
[34:16] circumstances,
[34:18] he couldn't he he's speaking to his wife
[34:20] as a young woman.
[34:24] He's speaking to his wife as a young
[34:27] woman. The promise is right in front of
[34:30] him, but he's letting the circumstances
[34:33] get the best of him.
[34:37] Yes, sir. Good. Hallelujah. How often
[34:40] the promise of God is right in your
[34:42] face, but you letting the circumstances
[34:44] get the best of you.
[34:48] The promise was fulfilled right in his
[34:51] eyes. He said, "Honey," he said, "Honey,
[34:54] you looking good. You look you looking
[34:56] so good. The king want to kill me and
[34:58] want to take you at his wife. Why would
[35:00] a young king want a grandma?
[35:03] That's right.
[35:06] Yes. Glory. I done been around a long
[35:08] time, but I ain't I ain't seen a young
[35:10] man marry a grandma yet. Amen.
[35:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But this young
[35:18] man saw something in Sarah. What did he
[35:22] see? He saw the restoration of God's
[35:24] promise.
[35:27] You and Abraham are going to have a
[35:29] child. Hallelujah. Look at it. The
[35:31] unbeliever could see it before the
[35:33] believer could see it.
[35:39] Hallelujah. And so were some of us that
[35:42] tried to fit in the world. And our
[35:44] unbelieving friends would tell us, "Ah,
[35:45] you don't fit. Go. You going to church.
[35:48] You know this a church night. Go on to
[35:50] church." Amen. Stop trying to hang. Stop
[35:51] trying to hang out with us. your life
[35:53] get all messed up, jacked up, and tow
[35:55] up, and you still be trying to make it
[35:57] fit
[36:00] God's allowing these things to happen on
[36:02] purpose.
[36:04] So faith in him can come out.
[36:08] So God allowed that. God allowed Abraham
[36:12] to go down there, man, take his wife
[36:14] just like he spoke.
[36:16] Now the circumstances didn't change.
[36:18] Amen. Yes. But then God has to come in
[36:21] and protect his promise. Hallelujah. If
[36:25] you doing what you supposed to do, God
[36:26] going to do his part. Hallelujah. Even
[36:29] when you ain't doing your part, God
[36:31] going to do his part.
[36:33] Cuz he has to protect his promise.
[36:38] His reputation is on the line. If God if
[36:42] you got a scripture and you standing on
[36:45] that scripture, God's reputation is on
[36:47] the line.
[36:49] Hallelujah,
[36:54] church. In in in in in Abraham's folly,
[36:59] hallelujah, in his unbelief, yes, God
[37:03] comes in and unlocks something.
[37:07] Even when he wasn't believing, God still
[37:09] gave him a measure of faith.
[37:13] [Applause]
[37:14] How? Through a trial. Yes. And then God
[37:18] comes and meets uh Aimilec aimc in a in
[37:21] a in a dream and say,
[37:23] "Hey, that's my prophet."
[37:26] And you better give him back his wife or
[37:28] you as good as a dead man. And this is
[37:31] this is what I want you to do. He said,
[37:34] "But he lied to me, God. She she even
[37:36] said that was her brother." He said,
[37:38] "Yeah, yeah, I know the integrity of
[37:40] your heart." Said, "That's why I'm
[37:42] stopping you from sinning against me."
[37:44] Amen. Amen. God just stepped in fighting
[37:47] this battle. Hallelujah. Abraham ain't
[37:49] had to do nothing. God just stepped in.
[37:51] What is that going to do? That's going
[37:52] to unlock something in Abraham's life.
[37:55] And look, church. Hallelujah. Now he
[37:57] comes and he tells him say, "Hey, give
[37:59] that man back his wife. And before he
[38:01] leave, I want you to bless him. Bless
[38:04] him and let him pray for you." Amen.
[38:12] But de, what are you saying, church?
[38:14] There have been times in my life when I
[38:16] should have gotten judgment, but God
[38:18] gave me grace.
[38:22] Hallelujah. And he blessed me. Talk to
[38:25] me somebody. There are times when we
[38:28] should have got judgment, but God gave
[38:30] us grace and favor.
[38:35] Hallelujah. What did that do? That
[38:38] unlocked another measure of faith in
[38:40] Abraham's life. Hallelujah.
[38:46] Hallelujah. Now, Abraham, I'm going to
[38:48] speed up a little bit. You can keep
[38:50] looking at the different trials of
[38:52] Abraham's life. Now, Abraham get to a
[38:53] place that God says, "Hey, all right.
[38:57] Now, those are circumstances. Those are
[38:59] facts. Hallelujah. They did take Sarah.
[39:02] Fact. Hallelujah. She was in the palace.
[39:04] Fact. Hallelujah. But then God came in
[39:07] and took her back. And now Abraham
[39:10] Abraham is leaving the kingdom.
[39:11] Abraham's leaving the kingdom blessed
[39:14] just told a lie. Then did all kind of
[39:16] foolery,
[39:19] right, brother? And God still gives him
[39:21] blessings.
[39:24] Hallelujah.
[39:26] Thank you,
[39:28] Jesus. Cuz the Bible says all things
[39:32] work together for good.
[39:37] All things. Not sometimes, all the time.
[39:42] But Jesse, I don't understand why people
[39:44] don't want to give God their all. That's
[39:47] right. They they want to play pickoo
[39:48] with God or hide and seek. One week they
[39:52] one week they in church, next week they
[39:54] hiding. One week they in church, next
[39:56] week they hiding. Why do that with God
[39:58] when all he want to do is bless you?
[40:01] [Applause]
[40:03] That's all he want to do. He want to
[40:05] bless you. He want to put you in
[40:07] heavenly places. He want to show you
[40:10] that you are the child of a king.
[40:14] [Applause]
[40:19] Oh,
[40:21] church. Now look, he gets to the place
[40:25] now through all the trials and
[40:27] tribulations, God God gives him the
[40:30] ultimate challenge. He says, "Hey, now I
[40:32] want you to take him and kill him."
[40:35] [Music]
[40:38] The circumstances.
[40:41] Look at the
[40:43] circumstances. Yes. He waited 25 years.
[40:47] Now he has the son and God say, "Go kill
[40:49] it."
[40:51] He says, "Go take him up on the
[40:53] mountain." He said, "I'll show you. Just
[40:54] get out there and go." He gets up the
[40:56] next morning. He says,
[40:58] "Hey, I lag going to go and I lag going
[41:02] to return."
[41:06] Hallelujah. What was what happened?
[41:08] Amen. From that place to the place where
[41:11] he was a liar.
[41:13] Now God done so much in his life.
[41:16] Hallelujah. God's unlocked a perfect
[41:18] faith to know that if God give me
[41:20] anything, I can't lose it.
[41:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if I lose
[41:27] it, that mean he got something better.
[41:29] Hallelujah.
[41:32] Hallelujah. Oh my. He said everything
[41:34] that Job lost, he gave it back to him
[41:36] double.
[41:40] Hallelujah. He said go return. God
[41:44] didn't tell him that. That's right. But
[41:47] faith can put an anointing on you.
[41:50] Hallelujah. Oh my. I I'm looking for the
[41:52] right words, but I'm going to say it
[41:53] like this. That'll even supersede what
[41:56] God had said. Amen. Amen.
[42:02] Didn't Jacob wrestle with the angel and
[42:04] prevail? Amen.
[42:06] Hallelujah. His faith superseded.
[42:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[42:11] Oh my church. Look. And now Oh. Uh uh I
[42:15] give you another case. God put and God
[42:19] allowed an evil spirit to get on Saul.
[42:21] Amen. But every time David came in
[42:24] there,
[42:27] probably he probably was saying, "Speak
[42:29] the name of Jesus." Amen.
[42:33] And them spirits will lift up and leave.
[42:38] Hallelujah.
[42:40] That's who we should be, church. Amen.
[42:44] We should be God's in the circumstances
[42:47] of our life. Hallelujah. The evil spirit
[42:50] belonged there, but it couldn't sit
[42:51] there in David's presence.
[42:56] And when David left, the spirit came
[42:58] back. When David came, the spirit left.
[43:01] Hallelujah. A spirit that God put on the
[43:04] man.
[43:06] [Applause]
[43:13] I need to close. But church, you look
[43:18] Abraham said, "I lag on go. I lag going
[43:20] to turn." His faith was unlocked in such
[43:22] a place now to the circumstances didn't
[43:24] matter.
[43:26] It didn't matter. He get out there. H
[43:28] didn't tell Sarah nothing. You know why?
[43:30] Cuz he was expecting to come back with
[43:32] Isaac.
[43:34] Hallelujah. He was expecting to come
[43:36] back with Isaac. Hallelujah. He like
[43:38] what he going to tell her I'm going to
[43:40] go kill my son for he knew he was going
[43:42] to come back with Isaac. That's the
[43:44] that's the realm of faith he was
[43:46] operating in curse. He tells his he
[43:48] tells his servants I lag going to go and
[43:50] I lag going to return honey. So they get
[43:53] out there and they go way out there
[43:54] where there's nothing out there. H way
[43:57] out there all the way out there in the
[43:58] mountains way out there. Then they start
[44:00] gathering
[44:02] wood gathering wood. Getting a get
[44:04] getting the altar together all these
[44:06] things. And Isaac, hold Isaac looks to
[44:08] his daddy. He says,
[44:10] "Papa, he says, "I see the altar. We got
[44:15] the wood, but where's the sacrifice?"
[44:18] And Abraham's faith has been unlocked
[44:21] now. Amen. To he can create in his
[44:24] circumstance.
[44:29] He's the master of his circumstances.
[44:34] That's right. Oh, that's who we should
[44:37] be. We are the master of our
[44:40] circumstances.
[44:43] Abraham became the master of his
[44:45] circumstance. Hallelujah. He was
[44:48] speaking as Adam spoke in the garden of
[44:51] Eden. He says, "Son, the Lord shall
[44:54] provide himself a sacrifice." And they
[44:57] don't. Where did it come from? It came
[45:00] from Abraham's faith.
[45:02] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[45:05] His faith put it there. Yes, sir. No
[45:09] matter what the circumstances was,
[45:12] hallelujah. Was no animals running
[45:14] around out there. His faith created it.
[45:18] Honey, friend of mine in Arizona, far
[45:21] close. Friend of mine in Arizona, he was
[45:23] out hunting deer and he had got to a
[45:27] spot where he saw a bunch of doese's
[45:29] around a tree. said the tree wasn't that
[45:31] big. He could see behind the tree, both
[45:34] sides of the tree with his binoculars,
[45:36] how many other yards it was. He said,
[45:38] "Now, if those doe's are there
[45:40] gathering, a buck got to be somewhere."
[45:42] He said, "But I don't see it."
[45:44] Binoculars looking, don't see
[45:47] nothing. He said, he waited a little
[45:51] bit, put the binoculars back up, still
[45:54] don't see nothing. All he see is the
[45:55] tree and a couple doe's around the tree.
[45:58] He said that buck got to be somewhere.
[46:00] So what he did was he said I know it's a
[46:04] buck
[46:05] there. So he said he stood up, put his
[46:09] goggles out. He said, "Hey
[46:13] buck." Now he done looked out there four
[46:16] times already with the goggles. And when
[46:19] he yelled, "Hey buck," he said a big big
[46:23] huge buck came from behind the tree.
[46:27] Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. The tree wasn't
[46:31] that big to hide that book. Amen.
[46:35] [Applause]
[46:39] Where did it come from?
[46:42] [Applause]
[46:43] He called it on the scene. Hey, buck. He
[46:46] said the buck came from behind the tree.
[46:48] He shot it. Took it home. Amen. And I
[46:52] came just a little quicker. I would to
[46:53] add some of that meat. I love testimony
[46:56] meat.
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:03] Oh my church. Don't worry about the
[47:05] circumstances. Look, church. Oh, another
[47:09] friend of mine, he was working the
[47:11] graveyard shift. I think he go in like
[47:13] 10:00 and get off 3:00 in the morning.
[47:14] Whatever the hours is, he get up like 3
[47:16] two two or three in the morning. So this
[47:19] one morning he got off, jumped on the
[47:22] highway, started riding.
[47:25] his gas hand wasn't
[47:27] working. He ran out of gas in the middle
[47:29] of the highway 2 o'clock in the morning.
[47:32] Nobody's out there. He said he didn't
[47:35] want to call his wife cuz it was 2
[47:36] o'clock in the morning. Then she was so
[47:38] many miles away. It would have been a
[47:40] whole headache. And he was like, "Man,
[47:42] what I'mma do?" So he started looking
[47:44] around. He was miles away from her exit.
[47:48] Nobody was coming. He's like, "Man, what
[47:49] I'mma do?" He lift up the trunk. Didn't
[47:51] have no gas jug back there. He fumbling
[47:53] around. He said all he saw was a a a a a
[47:57] gallon of water. He's like, "Man, I
[47:59] ain't got nothing." He said, "But then
[48:02] he stood on the side of the car and he
[48:04] started to think about the Lord." Amen.
[48:09] Said,
[48:11] "God, you turn water into wine." Amen.
[48:15] Amen. Amen. Amen. You can turn water
[48:18] into gas.
[48:24] Hallelujah. He didn't go home. He didn't
[48:26] sit in the car and pray 15 hours. He
[48:29] said, "Lord, if you turn water into
[48:31] wine, you can turn water into gas." He
[48:34] took the water out the trunk, pulled it
[48:36] in the pulled it in the gas tank, jumped
[48:39] in, crunkked the car, and drove all the
[48:41] way home.
[48:45] Hallelujah.
[48:47] Who cares about the circumstances? You
[48:50] are the master of your circumstance.
[48:53] [Music]
[48:55] That's the God I serve.
[48:58] Hallelujah. He allows things to happen
[49:01] to unlock your faith.
[49:04] Now, who's going to tell that brother
[49:06] that we are not recipients of
[49:08] supernatural things?
[49:10] Hallelujah.
[49:11] The Bible is true. Hallelujah. He can
[49:14] stand there and say, "It's true. I've
[49:15] seen God do it." Amen.
[49:19] That's right.
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:23] Hallelujah. Glory to I'm going close
[49:26] with
[49:27] this. Circumstances.
[49:31] Facts.
[49:36] Facts. But that don't change who God is.
[49:41] Remember, they sent a call. They sent
[49:42] the messenger out to Jesus. Lazarus is
[49:45] sick.
[49:47] Jesus, okay, okay, I'm coming. Keep on
[49:50] going wherever he
[49:51] going. They say somebody said, "Lord,
[49:54] Lord, Lazarus, he he he about to die."
[49:58] He said, "If you believe this is for the
[50:00] glory of God, just hold on. This is all
[50:03] this is happening for the glory of God."
[50:07] So now Jesus, get there. Hallelujah.
[50:10] and and and mother says,
[50:13] "Lord, if you would have been here, my
[50:16] brother wouldn't have died."
[50:20] But even mother knew that those
[50:22] circumstances couldn't stop God.
[50:27] Mother said, "Even now, Lord,
[50:30] whatever you ask the Father, it'll
[50:32] happen right now." See, that's how we
[50:34] should be. No matter what we're looking
[50:36] at, what do you believe? Amen. What do
[50:39] you believe God can do? No matter what.
[50:41] Let's stop living with oh my credit
[50:43] score ain't this and my this ain't that
[50:45] and all that. Who do you believe or
[50:47] don't you?
[50:51] I can't buy no car because of my credit
[50:53] score. I don't make enough on my job.
[50:55] Are you a son and daughter or not?
[51:00] Hallelujah.
[51:05] Hallelujah. church. Then the mother keep
[51:08] talking to Jesus and you know and then
[51:11] mother says
[51:13] Lord by now he's thinking
[51:16] facts.
[51:22] Let's look at the
[51:24] circumstances. Now most of us have have
[51:26] have
[51:27] have maybe seen something get hit by a
[51:30] car and die. You know it's on the road.
[51:32] It's stinking. It's dead. Just terrible.
[51:35] But think about a dead body.
[51:38] Worms coming out of it. Parts are
[51:40] falling off. Eyes done sunk in. Worms
[51:43] eating everything. It's the body is
[51:45] decaying. It's deforming. Four days
[51:47] later,
[51:51] completely against physics.
[51:56] Jesus. They said
[51:59] they talk about the circumstances versus
[52:02] who God is. He said, "Lord, he's
[52:04] thinking by now." Did mother mess around
[52:06] and say the right thing? She said,
[52:09] "Lord, even he said, I know my brother
[52:12] going to raise again in the dead of
[52:13] resurrect." Jesus said, "Ah, I am the
[52:16] resurrection.
[52:19] Where have you laid?
[52:23] Where's that stinking 4 day old dead
[52:26] body? Where is he?
[52:29] Take me to the tomb. Where is he? Amen.
[52:34] Now, can you imagine they get to the
[52:35] tomb, Jesus say, "Roll a stone away."
[52:38] And when they roll a stone away,
[52:40] everybody probably wish they was in CO
[52:42] with mask on
[52:45] when that smell came out of that tomb.
[52:47] Some people probably said, "Lord, I I
[52:50] believe,
[52:54] but I believe in miracles, but this this
[52:56] this smell is just too much."
[53:00] I believe
[53:02] that when that stench came
[53:05] out, it couldn't even touch the nose of
[53:08] Jesus.
[53:10] [Applause]
[53:10] [Music]
[53:14] Hallelujah.
[53:15] Why? Because he Hallelujah. controlled
[53:18] death.
[53:21] Death had no power over him. The smell
[53:25] of death couldn't even touch him.
[53:29] Hallelujah.
[53:32] That's right. Look at the circumstance.
[53:34] A dead body, the stench come out cuz she
[53:36] said by now he's stinking. So they know
[53:38] what a dead body happens, what it smells
[53:41] like. But Jesus roller, thrown away. I
[53:43] believe death couldn't even come up
[53:45] under his nose. Hallelujah.
[53:49] Then he stands out there and he says,
[53:54] "Lazarus, come forth."
[53:57] Yes. And a man that been dead four days,
[54:03] the decay of the ears start to come back
[54:05] together. The eyes start to come back in
[54:08] his
[54:11] Look, church. Look, he didn't get hooked
[54:14] up to a respirator. His heart started to
[54:17] pump it again. The blood started moving
[54:19] through his
[54:23] life. Hallelujah. started flowing
[54:25] through his body again. Why? Because
[54:28] Jesus called for it. And when the master
[54:31] comes, he can change every circumstance.
[54:34] [Applause]
[54:41] And if he did
[54:43] that for the glory of God, what about
[54:45] us?
[54:47] What is he unlocking in your life?
[54:50] Hallelujah.
[54:52] Don't sit and complain and be
[54:54] crying and oh Lord I don't know what
[54:57] I'mma do. You going to believe that what
[54:59] you going to do.
[55:03] I'm going to believe.
[55:05] I'm going through this for the purpose
[55:08] of becoming stronger.
[55:11] Hallelujah.
[55:12] He ain't giving me more faith. He's
[55:14] unlocking the faith. And every child is
[55:17] unlocking the faith. Amen.
[55:21] There are some things that are in you
[55:23] that you don't even know in you. And God
[55:25] pushes it out of you. The prophet of God
[55:28] wasn't looking to speak squirres into
[55:30] existence. But God allowed him to get in
[55:33] that situation. And then he told him,
[55:35] "Hallelujah, if you want squirrels,
[55:37] speak them and they'll appear."
[55:40] [Applause]
[55:44] He wasn't looking to create. He put them
[55:46] in a position. Hallelujah. on top of the
[55:48] mountain in Colorado. Storm was coming.
[55:50] He said, "If you speak to it, it'll obey
[55:53] you."
[55:56] Hallelujah.
[55:58] [Applause]
[56:01] I got to give him up before I break
[56:02] something. Hallelujah. Think about it,
[56:06] church. Right now, you're going through
[56:09] things because God is trying to unlock a
[56:11] level in you.
[56:14] Amen.
[56:15] He's trying to unlock something in you.
[56:18] He knows about your storms. He told him,
[56:20] he said, "Hey, let's go to the other
[56:21] side. Y'all go ahead. I'm going to
[56:23] pray."
[56:25] Then he went to pray. And then then the
[56:27] Bible say by now they're in a storm. You
[56:30] think he didn't know it was a storm out
[56:31] there?
[56:33] He let that happen so they could see
[56:36] another level in him that they are
[56:39] supposed to produce.
[56:43] They seen him heal the sick and raise
[56:45] the dead, but they never saw him walk on
[56:47] water. So now he's coming out there in
[56:49] the midst of
[56:51] [Applause]
[56:52] Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. The
[56:54] question is, is that same God coming to
[56:56] you in your storm? Amen.
[57:00] Hallelujah.
[57:03] He should be, we should be believing.
[57:06] Faith beyond all the circumstances. Yes.
[57:09] You tell me one circumstance in the
[57:11] Bible that stopped God from moving.
[57:16] When it was something he wanted to do,
[57:18] nothing could stop him. Hallelujah.
[57:20] Hallelujah. And it should be the same
[57:23] way in our lives.
[57:25] The circumstances of this life shouldn't
[57:27] hinder who we are.
[57:31] Cuz the mistake they made, they said we
[57:34] crucify you not because of the good
[57:36] works and all. crucify you cuz you a man
[57:38] saying you God. See, they were crossed
[57:40] up. They were looking at it wrong. Say
[57:42] you you you you do all these things, but
[57:44] man, you messed up when you said you was
[57:46] God. They had it wrong. Hallelujah.
[57:50] He wasn't a man saying he was God. He
[57:52] was God saying he was a man.
[57:56] He was God first.
[57:59] That's right. He was God first and he
[58:02] became a man. Now I say unto you, if he
[58:05] was God first and became a man, who are
[58:07] you?
[58:11] Hallelujah.
[58:13] I'm a son of God first, living a life
[58:16] down here as a man. Cuz the prophet of
[58:19] God said we bypass our theophony.
[58:23] Hallelujah.
[58:25] Hallelujah. Don't let these
[58:27] circumstances down here stop you from
[58:29] believing.
[58:33] I want everybody to get that key out.
[58:36] Come on, get your keys out. Get your
[58:38] spiritual keys out. And I want you to
[58:40] turn that door. Turn that door. That
[58:42] thing you praying about, turn that door.
[58:45] Hallelujah.
[58:48] Come on, you sisters. I'm closing. Come
[58:50] on.
[58:52] Hallelujah.
[58:55] Hallelujah. Let's pray. Hallelujah.
[58:59] Lord Jesus, Father, we love you and we
[59:01] thank you for your word. Lord, we pray
[59:03] it was something said to help your
[59:04] people, Lord God. Father God, we are
[59:08] supposed to rise above the circumstances
[59:10] of life and live in this truth, Lord.
[59:12] And the truth is that we are sons of
[59:15] God, daughters of God. Lord, and this
[59:18] earth down here is only the proving
[59:20] ground. And it can't stop us from being
[59:23] what we are. But what it should do is
[59:26] unlock the measures of Christ that are
[59:29] already inside of us. Lord, we thank
[59:31] you. We love you. We appreciate you.
[59:34] Continue to bless Pastor Smith, his
[59:35] family, his church family. Lord God, all
[59:38] those connected to the end time word. In
[59:39] the name of Jesus Christ,
