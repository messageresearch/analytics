Paul preached Hallelujah and that's what I want to do I want to preach what Paul preached Hallelujah that's what we'll be uh judged by and and Paul brother Ram said if Paul goes in I'll go in because I preach the exactly the same word that Paul preached glory to God so we want to preach God God's word today Hallelujah 1 Corinthians chapter 10 if anybody's listened to uh 1957 book of Correction by

and two here uh then we'll have just a brief word of Prayer by God's grace let's read one and two we can probably all read that together uh by God's grace one 2 three moreover Brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God and surely if you pull on the word of God then God will meet your need need Hallelujah father God you see my hand Lord I Need Your Grace today Lord each person needs Amazing Grace today thank you Lord you paid our sin debt Lord we're Sons and Daughters of God we're forgiven and Lord we need instruction on our journey Lord God so thank you for this book here Paul wrote Lord God this letter turned into a book now for us Lord God giving us thus sayith the Lord for our lives God we thank you for that Lord and thank you for sending a prophet here Lord in the previous generation Lord God to give us the word of God to point us back to the scripture to give us a book on correction Lord God father we sure need it Lord each and every day we fall short of your glory so we're renewed day by day by the transformed mind that you give us Lord transform our minds today Lord God and I pray you meet every need for your glory in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God maybe if my wife is listening you could uh send me a text honey and say uh how the song service sounded hopefully it sounded good and hopefully they got to clap along and uh Zion was laying there on the on the you know the The Lazy Boy and he's like Daddy we're going to live stream today I'll make sure I live stream Daddy I said I said I know you'll be faithful buddy I know you be faithful he's such a sweetheart so we're thankful again to be gathered in the house of God thank you for pressing your way out how were the roads brother Austin loo were they okay they were bad okay okay well thank you for coming through that ours were very clear you know once we got uh to the high well I live on a highway so ours were pretty clear just the the wor the first road was the worst and then it was all clear from 76 down to 77 so thank you for pressing your way to the house of God by God's grace Hallelujah I got a few uh quotes here so we'll go through some of the slides by God's grace I appreciate uh everybody again pressing the route to the house of God I've set a timer here I know everybody we want to be uh cautious of the time here by the grace of the Lord hallelujah so let's look at here this is part 13 if I'm not mistaken yeah part 13 and uh we're looking at the Corinthians hopefully everybody was able to listen to Wednesday night's sermon this is all tied together because this is the sections on the same thoughts about Liberties of the Christian uh but then there's warnings uh inside these Liberties of course we know that uh there's warnings uh uh with all the commands of God right if you don't do this this will happen there's there's temporary curses for Christians right we know that uh if you do this you're going to get that punishment but even in the Liberty areas of Liberty whether you know you put up a tree or you don't put a tree up or you uh drink wine or you don't drink wine or you eat meat or you don't eat meat or you wear the jewelry or you don't wear jewelry even in that there's warnings in there too so we want to be mindful of that and remember what God has given to us here in the word of God now this chapter 10 has a outline there's three different kind of ideas he talks about Israel in the wilderness is a warning example so we're going to look at that in the first 15 verses and then it goes to the fellowship at the Lord's table demand separation so this is nice this ties in what we looked at on Wednesday if you remember I just briefly talked about how Corinth had many Idol temples right we looked at Aphrodite uh posidon and Apollo they actually had temples and and some of these message Believers and the early Christians were actually going into those temples and eating uh but they were houses of demons right like we compare it to like a adult uh club like nightclub or something like that we compare it to that or a bar uh just houses of lewdness houses of wickedness because they were houses of prostitution and homosexuality and fornication and adultery and so here Paul the next chapter or two chapters over now he gets into saying you can't have fellowship with both right you can't you can't go to those places and then try to come here and have communion so he kind of uh he gave us the introduction there in chapter 8 uh to that and then here in chapter 10 he's going to say you cannot drink from both cups you cannot do both things uh so that's of course a warning there and now it becomes a command do not go to those places and of course he said as long as the world stands I wouldn't do that because it would cause somebody to stumble but the young immature Christians would need those reminders by the grace of God pardon me I'm battling a little runny nose myself here by God's grace but doing good verse thir 20 23 rather to 33 looks at the law of love in relation to eating and drinking again finishing up this section on Christian liberties so we're right here we you know we've been going through chapter 8 n 10 as on Christian Liberties and their warnings so we've looked at all these other topics here in this letter I'm glad you know I'm glad there was such a thing as a Corinthian Church because it shows us people can do these things and yet still be saved but there the way we'll know they're saved is if they receive the correction of the word right as we'll see in this chapter this chapter actually lays it out here and gives the warning uh to how people know they're saved or not uh it gives it very plainly in here and then it's interesting he'll go into the headship with hair and uh Christ I'm sorry God Christ man woman in the next chapter the then communion he deals again with communion as we read that countless times uh hundreds of times we'd say for the our communion Services then looks at the spiritual gifts God bless you Sister and then of course charity uh in Chapter 13 and then the gifts of the holy spirit tongues in chapter 14 and then resurrections the the certainty of the Resurrection praise God okay okay so uh remember this was brother braham's text if you haven't listened to that I would encourage it's only like an hour and 20 minutes if you uh if you're on a drive or something or just sit down and listen to it it's a great message uh he talks about Corinthians book of Correction so in the in the 12th paragraph So the beginning of the the message he said this message has come to my heart is a message of warning so chapter 10 is a message of warning that's what Paul's giving them warning uh and that's I imagine brother bam got it right here from the scoffield because it says a warning example he said I thought maybe if we could get this warning to the people as Paul was warning these Corinthians if we can get this warning to the people knowing that we're facing a Revival now and an examinating time when we must be examined as Paul said and then he reads of course the first two verses that reread so his text was verses 1 and two of chapter 10 to preach about the entire book of Corinthians so after reading verse two he says now he's given them an understanding that when God brought out Israel from the Wilderness Into the Wilderness to serve him and to take them to the promised land he's setting forth an example there that as we are brought out in all the material things all the rituals and orders they were the same so we're going to see here you know uh in other words Israel went through all the rituals right in other words they got baptized right uh they they followed the prophet right all these initial things you know when Aus and I first heard the message oh we didn't know there was a prophet that was new to us like some of you were raised in it God bless you for that our children were raised in it uh so you learn about the rituals right away but to us Austin and Lena it was different it was like wow I didn't know this is all the a beginning instruction and we thank God for it but Paul's saying Israel went through all that as well just as the Christian Church goes through all these beginning rituals or the beginning uh procedures of becoming a Christian or the beginning steps we'd say of Christianity verse 13 and we find on down a little farther in our lesson that many of those were overthrown because they they could do all the rituals and all the orders and everything that God required and still their hearts wasn't right with God okay so in other words like this people can go through justification but they still need full sanctification or else their hearts will not be right with God they got to be fully Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah now the battle is going to be hard enough with the Holy Ghost and the church said but without the Holy Ghost it's it's a very very likely someone without the the Holy Ghost will fall into one of these uh sins that we're speaking of here in chapter 10 right because Paul said most of Israel fell to these things and why did they fall because they didn't make it they didn't have the the hearts weren't right and they didn't actually want to go to the promised land how many want to go to the promised land amen glory so see their hearts weren't right with God and it was shown all the way uh through the Old Testament you know all all the story of Moses to Joshua it was shown time and time again over 10 times cuz remember 10 times they they murmured against Moses 10 times they complained to God about their tough journey and that and that was just 10 times on top of that there was other times other tests that they failed as well so all these tests just showed their hearts weren't right so it's so important to make sure we have a clean heart you know a brother emailed me uh from I think he South Africa again this week and he said brother Jesse I've fallen into fornication again I can't get rid of it what should I do and I've told him many times I said brother go read Psalm 51 and if if God made David's heart pure for him after what he did surely God will make your heart pure if you come on the same grounds Hallelujah in other words if you come with the same repentance God will create in you a clean heart as well Hallelujah see but you got your you have to open up your heart and say God make my heart is my heart's dirty wash my heart and create in me a clean heart put your desires in my heart brother man says and we know if you come to God with the same desire or the the same approach same faith God is obligated to give you the same results Hallelujah if you want to be saved by grace through faith and God saved that one by Grace then God Will Save You by Grace as well Hallelujah he has to right he has to meet everybody the same or else he's he's unfair but we know God is just Hallelujah and he no one no one will be able to accuse God of any Injustice on the day of judgment Hallelujah and so we got to make sure uh you know people can go through all all all the rituals here of a Christian all the beginning steps but they got to make sure their heart gets clean before God now brother R list some examples so these will be common to us here now we can do many things think about that think of all the people in our church over the years that have taken communion anybody can do that that's good but anybody can do that we could be baptized we can come to church have our names on the book or you can have your uh phone number in the church group text because we don't have a membership book he says or just as respect and reverent as we could be sit there and be so respectful and and so Pious right they can look so holy and he says still be lost that's a solemn warning we could just rejoice when the spirit would fall and in a meeting where the word was being preached and our souls would just Rejoice with the word and still be lost the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same rain that makes the wheat grow makes the weed grow it's the the nature of the product see it's the nature of it that tells what we are therefore it's the nature that's in us that tells what we are Hallelujah see church we should constantly brother said don't judge yourself by how many miracles he said judge yourself by the current fruit your life is producing the fruits of the spirit I'm going to just to read them again real briefly here since I I got it there because I always for some reason I always quote the NIV version because when I was a child I memorized that NIV verse so uh I'd rather read the the King James I of course you can get saved in a NIV but uh you're not going to get to the baptism Holy Ghost I don't think in one of those versions verse uh 20 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace I really got to Commit This to Memory love joy peace longsuffering that's the one I always forget gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against against such there is no law praise God hallelujah read that again love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law that's the fruit of the spirit that's the nature that we want inside of us hallelujah the fruit of the Holy Spirit now uh this is the last one I got two more quotes yeah two more quotes before I get to the scriptures now we might be so religious till we could turn our hands on Sunday morning on Sunday to do a thing I'm sorry we wouldn't turn our hands in other words I'm not going to work all day Sunday now that's a good thing I really think that's a good thing you want to have at least one day of rest right we might not even take a stitch in our clothes on Sundays to just put one stitch now this is the old days when they used to sew but when they had sewing machines most of you sisters don't sew anymore right I've never i i soed in high school but I was in a home at class but not not since we might not even feel Justified to buy food on Sunday so look brother mam always bought food he always took his family out on Sunday to the Blue Bar Cafe right so brother Mam's even said some people probably criticize me because I take my family out and brother say there's and I have a quote brother say there's a lot of legalists in our church he said that's okay right so some people in the church would look at brother Bram said well you you you make people work on Sunday you go out to the blue board brother BR says well I got the Liberty to do it but he's saying you might be so religious you don't even buy food on Sunday you won't even go to the the store on Sunday he said you might be so religious and so Pious but yet if we're not literally born again of the spirit of God we're just worshiping in vain right in other words if we got sin in our lives right and our hearts are clean of course if you're Justified and your heart's clean you're worshiping God God's receiving your worship if you're Sanctified God received your worship but he's talking about people that will ultimately be lost he's talking about these Corinthians here right and bringing it down to our day where people can act so holy or they can be so loud another quotes remember the one I read Wednesday he said you might be able to clap your hands louder than anybody else he said but make sure your heart is right with God hallelujah I can clap with the best of them I can clap till Lydia has to leave this room because I clap so loud I can Scream and Shout I can cry I can cry crocodile tears with the best of them but that don't mean I'm saved Hallelujah the life I daily live proves I'm saved Hallelujah that's right and it stand a testimony stands the test of time that's right he says now so now it's pretty stiff that's a pretty stiff thing to say you don't even buy things you won't even Stitch a stitch on Sunday you won't even uh go to the store on Sunday You're So holy it's so stiff and we want to really find it and know the truth because remember we're not going to get a second chance at this Hallelujah see there's some people they won't get a second chance at coming to our church right look think about down through the years it's just one this one time and we got one life to do it so you better be real sure he's saying you got the nature of the the Holy Spirit Glory now Brethren I would not have you ignorant now he gets into verse one I would not have you ignorant brother now these Corinthians what did I say in the first place they were basing their Eternal uh holds upon some sensation so you'd ask them say uh you'd say Hey brother God bless you sir uh uh you know are are you going to heaven and and yes yes I'm going to heaven why you going to heaven they'll say because I shouted or because I play the piano because I lead songs on Sunday night or because I pastored for 18 years uh uh oh yeah and God came on me and I danced one time or I prayed for somebody and they were healed right there instantly they were healed and I felt the power of God come on me brother said that's the equivalent to today to people saying well I'm going to get to heaven because I had this experience now Church do we need a place and and some of you shouted amen which I enjoyed a few months ago I said you got to put a steak down we all got to put a steak down but he's he's comparing this how the these these uh Corinthians so so the so so so they were saying well I have all the experience but yet they're suing people they're divided saying well I'm of Apollos I'm a brother Jesse or I'm a brother cam I'm a brother Brooks I'm a brother Jim schake you put the name in there whatever name you want we're all Sinners saved by grace and they were causing divisions in the church some were they were saying oh I put a steak down but I can still get drunk at the Lord's table so see that that's what we're saying yes you got to put your Stak down but you also got to live a holy life Hallelujah yes well I I've I've made 400 YouTube videos surely I'm saved that's not what we're saved by we're saved by grace Hallelujah I've written two books that has nothing to do with anybody people can write hundreds of books that doesn't mean you're saved you're saved because the love of Jesus Christ has been shed abroad in your heart Hallelujah and you're living as close to God as you possibly can you die daily praise God and you ask for a transformed mind Paul said examine yourself make sure you know you're living in the faith Hallelujah but they were basing well I can sue people I can sleep around I can cause div Vision in the church I can get drunk at the Lord's table and I had an experience the Holy Ghost anointed me well of course the rain falls on the just and the unjust if you just get yourself in in the certain conditions yes the Holy Ghost is going to fall but they were basing it on some sensation Paul says when I come around you one has this one has that that's all right now he that's in 1 Corinthians 14 that's a great verse I like to use that verse it's a just a beautiful verse uh let me see if I can find it yeah verse 20 it's 14:26 it's a beautiful verse how is it Brethren when you come together every one of you hath a Psalm and a Doctrine and a tongue and a revelation hath interpretation let all the things be done and edifying so in their Church saints they they came to church and every Sunday somebody had something from God well I heard from God this week imagine a church like that we're rarely like that right our church is just not like that this this Sunday the brother comes in I heard from the Lord I got a revelation and it might be exactly right and then a sister I've got a revelation oh God spoke through me I felt this I felt that I yeah there's a lot of things we feel that might not be right let's check it by the word hallelujah I've had a lot of feelings this week I didn't like so much right but I was feeling things right he says that's all right we have nothing against it but that's not we're talk what we're talking about so just because God can flow through us and use our gifts that's wonderful but we also have to have the character of Jesus Christ to go along with the flowing of God's gifts in our lives this is kind of like a review for all of us but it's fresh it's good and fresh I love this I love seeing what brother Bram said what would what would a prophet of God in this day say about it and we've seen it he said you can act so holy you can jump so high you can clap so loud you can cry so much you Cann not work on Sunday you can do all these great things but how are you living your life to your brother and sister Hallelujah verse verse one now we'll get into some preaching here uh by God's grace and I'm going to be using some uh I'm going to go back to chapter 10 I'm going use in some of these Bible uh references these U references and let's go back and see in Exodus and numbers and so forth let's see uh what what what Paul is talking about and he's saying we can learn so much from the Israelis we can learn so much from the the generation that left Egypt Hallelujah hard to imagine what does that show Saints the sin nature doesn't change yes you and I are so modern boy we got the nicest hair and we got some of the nicest clothes but we still got that a old same dirty sin nature inside of us so we ain't that much different right now we got access to more power that's the big difference amen we got access to more power whereas David could fall in murder and adultery we should be able to overcome that because greater is he that's in us than and he that's in the world we have rest unto our souls Hallelujah they couldn't have that in the Old Testament they couldn't have rest to the soul the soul was constantly in unrest but now we can have rest and Power in the soul moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea now ignorant in the Greek means not to know not to understand so let's make sure we understand all that Israel went through so it'll help us uh to navigate our Christian Life as we head to the promised land and as we head to the Millennium as well Hallelujah verse two and were all baptized unto Moses the prophet they were baptized by the prophet in the cloud and the Sea now he already mentions the cloud and the Sea right but now he brings in the prophet well actually the prophet allowed this Cloud the prophet called on God was led by God to bring about the cloud the pillar of Fire by Night Cloud by day and to part the sea but it was done through a prophet verse three and did all eat the same spiritual meat verse four and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that fou them and that rock was Christ oh my ain't it wonderful Church to know that as we go through our we go through the famines of Life as we go through the deserts of life isn't it comforting to know that Christ follows you amen if he followed them he follows us as well Hallelujah and you always know he's got plenty of water praise God oh you're going to get thirsty you're going to get tired you're going to get exhausted you're going to get worn out you're going to get frustrated on this journey but don't forget Christ is he goes before you in the cloud and he follows behind you as well Hallelujah it's Christ that rock was Christ Christ is following us now there that's quite a statement that this is quite that that word many is quite a word there but with many that means 9999999999999 it's hard to be so repetitive I'm just trying to make the point God was not pleased with 99.9% of the message Believers because how many adults made it over two two now don't forget God was pleased with some of them like Moses uh Aaron Miriam you know they were still God's servants but they died in the Wilders but two two of them that that walked across through the waters imagine the walls of water and it's dry ground and two of them that saw the pillar of fire every day I would just like to see it one time right cam seen it Cam said he saw it over dve lwell and shoulder one time in the service there cam seen the pillar of fire but they saw the pillar of fire every day like clockwork and they could walk outside every day oh there's some fresh angel food out here you talk about Fresh Tortillas now how how good those tastes are fresh bread this was angel food this is even better it said honey taste to it some of you like cinnamon bread with honey on it or something like that or cinn bonds or whatever this has honey on it from Heaven freshly delivered to your door every day praise God and that wasn't enough that that would convince them to love God and have a pure heart see Church all these blessings we got to look past the blessings the blessings don't make us love God we should be grateful for him but we should love God just because he's God no matter what he allows no matter the story that he writes with our lives no matter how much suffering or pain we should love God just because he's God hallelujah he's our creator he's our father hallelujah amen but think about that seeing Miracles uh seeing a prophet seeing the pillar of fire having food and and water gushing out of the that that rock I've seen that rock on videos have you ever seen that rock uh archaeologists have found that rock it's a huge Rock standing up there on this on this near the mountain and like there there's a hole like there's a hole where erosion has Eros Ed out where the water went and there's streams still my wife has a video I think we saw a video on it like it's still there water came out of nothing right it seemed like but really water God just created water just like God created the loaves of bread Hallelujah he just at that little point there inside the rock where the crevice was he just brought he just created water right there and brother man said it wasn't like a little drop of Guster brother says how could I artist think that little boys were going up there with cups and catching water he said he had to feed three million people plus all the cattle he said it was gushing out of there when God pours out his water it gushes for us hallelujah we don't got to worry like God don't have enough God's gushing forth his Spirit Hallelujah you can enjoy God's spirit there's so much of it Hallelujah but with 99.9% of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in sanctification and the church said most of them didn't make it to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why with all you got keep pressing on until you get baptized with the Holy Ghost till you have a moment where you know power came inside of you all I know like I you know sometimes I dramatize it but all I know is I started weeping and crying I saw a vision in my mind and you know in that moment I didn't even really know it was a vision I was just enjoying the worship I just know when I walked out of there I had so much love I never felt that before but then I had to constantly test myself was that real was that right was that right and over the years I just I just had to make a a stake there something happened there and I'm living a new life Hallelujah power came into me there and I've lived differently since that moment praise God he says now they were overthrown in sanctification verse six now these were for our examples huh Old Testament stories are your examples to learn from to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted so now let's look at some of these examples here uh as we go through the scripture we you'll be turn your Bibles in just a minute but I just thought about this Paul lists five things experiences and five is a number of Grace in other words God poured out his grace and look these all have spiritual meanings what does the cloud represent leadership you got someone going before you right so all of us when we came in the message we started seeing Oh God's leading me oh now I can see my life is being led the right way now I know where to go follow those that love the Lord right follow the pastor follow the example of the preachers they're the leaders of the church they have the rule over the church as we've seen it in the scripture recently they have the full Authority all authority rebuke and teach with all authority when I got leadership the pillar of fire is leading me on the spirit of God is leading me and they passed through the sea and they didn't just stop there they got up the tambourine and the sisters started dancing and praising God and giving all the glory this was F experience praise God it's a shame some people don't even have that and they say they're baptized or they say they've had been forgiveness right oh my it ought to make us have joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah to know that we're forgiven hallelujah oh Grace Grace provided this Grace provided leadership forgiveness of my sins and the joy of being free The Joy from overcoming addictions and slave masters Grace provided I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I know God sent a prophet that's God's grace to me remember brother Ram commanded he said thus sayith the Lord if you've been baptized in the titles father son Holy Ghost you've been baptized false he said I command you to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a prophet Hallelujah he wasn't he wasn't stutter brother said he didn't stutter with thus say the Lord Elijah didn't stop down down there and say uh uh I I don't know about this he said thus sayith the Lord it will not rain for three and a half years till I call for it Hallelujah he didn't stutter with thus sayth the Lord neither did Brother brandom Hallelujah he gave us thus sayith the Lord and they ate the same spiritual meat my which is the body remember the body's the meat the body's the bread boy you've been you we've all enjoyed some of these wonderful sermons it tasted so good it's been so fresh uh we felt full leaving the house of God oh I could just love God I could just listen to sermons forever now what happened to that we got to be careful we got to keep feeding on the word of God but we've all I mean all the people that have been here to this church over 18 years they they all could say that my they enjoyed the meat of the word and they all drank the spiritual drink and Christ the Rock which is the holy spirit they've all been drunk uh drunk drunken on the things of God and tasted they've tasted and seen that God is good they they they I'll say like this for a moment they stopped thirsting for the things of the world and they only enjoyed in the thirst quenching blessings of the Waters of life that's right and then Paul says you can have all these experiences and still live a displeasing life to our Lord Jesus Christ and remember in fact the majority will not be pleasing so you know what I don't feel so bad that our church is small because we got we might be in that we might be in that small minority praise God think about that the big churches there the minority might be the only one saved in those big old churches yep beatric not head she knows what it's like to be in a big church you've seen them over the years right you see the people who really believe and who really don't I really believe let's really believe Hallelujah let's have a clean heart before God that's right and remember it was only two that were 20 years and older that made it unless they died before they got there and Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life see it's got to be found you go to and where do you find it on your knees in prayer that's how you find the narrow road that leads to life Hallelujah so I just thought that was amazing there uh he Liv five uh experiences where they could say I've had the experience of the leadership of God I've been led by the pillar of fire oh I've had Joy I've been forgiven oh I believe God sent a prophet I feasted on the word uh my thirst for the the things of God has been quenched I've drank of the Holy Spirit and yet their heart is not right with God what a thing to say and brother calls all these the routines of the the rituals of the church right our rituals that when they want to be baptized go baptize them right our ritual is teach them what brother bam said brother point us back to the word of God our ritual is preach the word sing in the spirit till the spirit falls on them Hallelujah and yet Hearts cannot be right when they experience all these things okay get your Bible ready here by God's grace now he gives now he gives the sins the the sins to warn the people these are the sins to warn the people in this message Church in the early church okay neither be ye idolators as were some of them as it is written oh I did set a good I did set a timer good amen glory all right I got half I got 30 minutes left Glory as some of them were as is written people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play now let's go read that that is uh Exodus 326 pardon me Exodus 3 I don't need that right now Exodus 326 now many you remember this I preached on this with uh the music series I did last year I think if I'm not mistaken verse six and they rose up early on the tomorrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play then God tells them in verse 6 and 7 they better go down the people have already got into idolatry uh God said he's going to destroy him but Moses stands in the Gap now uh look at verse 17 and when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said to Moses this is a noise of war in the camp okay now and then uh verse 19 it came to pass as soon as he came n to the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and Moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out the hands and break them but benath the mount all right now so the first warning is be not idolators now look what went along with this idolatry this was loud music right some of you in the world know what I'm talking about they really like to crank up the music right so the the Believers got to be careful don't give yourself to Idols where they crank up the music really loud but look what goes along with it sinful dancing and also fornication so sexy dancing right there's nothing wrong with cranking up the music the Bible said play Loud for God but Joshua said this is a wrong kind of loud this ain't the this ain't the the the loud noise of worship this is the loud noise of uh sexual immorality right so he he said they sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play when did they do this when there was no more prophit around now church I believe this is my home opinion I believe this is fulfilled Maybe not by message people but by the charismatics and the Pentecostals such as uh the Mike ble groups I don't know if you heard about Mike ble he started uh he started 24-hour prayer Chapel they prayed and sang 24 hours a day for years and years and everybody said he's the most H holy guy but you know what happened he got caught 17 acts of sexual abuse 17 17 but yeah if you look at their services loud loud all these things but you also look at them the women got pain on their faces they're dressing sex with short hair so see this is this is a modern example of that and then you know the when they pray for them they shake and it looks like they're in pain that's not the Holy Ghost and how do you know by their fruits they're known right by their fruits they're known so they the the prophets off the scene and all these guys but Austin you probably seen the videos all these guys say what a man William brandham was what a boy he had a gift of God we can have that same no you can't all of them say that oh yeah we uh and one guy his name is Chris valon I'm going to make a video on it he said I prayed to God and said God can I have the mantle of William brandom he said no that I'll make you prideful he said well how about it get gets on everybody and then we won't uh no one will no no one will look better than others and he said God said I'll do that that wasn't God that said that because not everybody's born a prophet and brother Ram said there'll never be a greater gift than his ministry right so it's impossible the Bible said are all prophets yet the people and the people will swallow it down they all honor brother Ram but when the prophets off the scene what do they do they crank up the music they allow sexy things to come in and what they do they raise up the play they're not serving God they're not getting down to business with God they're really not being uh Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but they got loud music they got loud music in 17 counts of sexual abuse that's what they got now could yes this does this happen in mess Church yes it does I've told you about some of them right I'm not going to maybe get in those details today but that's what people got to watch out for some people would be in the loud worship Services the loudness and then the uh the immoral clothes and then sexual immorality he says don't be like that hallelujah how many believe the word of God that's right verse eight and I'm you know just stay there uh 1 Corinthians 10:8 neither let us commit foreign fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 okay this was numbers 251 and N numbers 20 I think this is speaking of balum numbers 251 and N 25 1 and n and Israel Abode in shtim and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab now if you remember I don't know if you remember CU I I even any reminders if of this there's a four-step Antichrist process with the four horse riders the first step is Deeds of the nicians the second is doctrine of the nicians the third is uh balum bism that's what this is and the fourth is Jezebel religion that's the four steps of antichrist spirit this is Israel and step three balum religion what was balum religion he said Israelis come on down let's have a combined worship service and he stripped the women almost nude and there was a fornication between the men of Israel he taught them it's okay to commit fornication and 23,000 what was it 23,000 died in one day right now this is hard to find anything applicable to this in the message that I've heard of but I'm sure some people have been sinful around the world right but this is the but this is what he warns us of don't don't people should not commit fornication they need the anointing of temperance to control their sexual passions Hallelujah right that's what it he takes the anointing of the Holy Ghost so he gives us uh the golden calf and then he gives us uh balum balum right and brother man said that was liken unto spiritually it was liken un the Council of NAA where a lot of the church members United with the Roman Catholic church and uh Constantine right all right so we got two examples there uh golden calf loud music sexual immorality dancing and then uh next is just uh going to worship with denominations can I say it like that church we unless I'm going to preach I'm not going there unless I'm going to witness too right you see my example if they invite me I'll go preach I'll preach little like brother bam brother said when I'm out there I Don't Preach Doctrine so much but I'll I'll try to lay some things in there so the elect will catch it right because the elect cannot be deceived okay so Paul gives us these two examples balum and uh uh his Feast of balum bpor and then he also gives us the golden calf now number I'm sorry first 1 Corinthians 109 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents okay so this is uh Exodus 172 and7 Exodus I'm just using my uh uh my notes there from scoffield Exodus Exodus 17 2 and7 tempting Christ all right verse one 171 Exodus 17 and all the children of the children I'm sorry all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of sin after their Journeys according to the Commandment of the Lord and pitched in Reid him and there was no water for the people to drink so think about a time where you've ever uh felt like you've had no resources it's all run out what was your response we're going to see the wrong response that we might learn to give the right response praise God verse two wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said give us water that we may drink and Moses said to them why chide ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the Lord all right so here is a third example and uh of course we know the Lord sent water of course to them so we see a third example we should not tempt Christ so we shouldn't complain we shouldn't question God when things aren't going our way and I'll say like this even when we don't have our basic necessities we shouldn't tempt God because God's letting you be tested to see if you will serve God or not now most of us thank God in America most of us haven't had to deal with that some of us have right but it's a test God lets different ones go through this and how many want to pass the test hallelujah amen they so in other words when things got bad they spoke against the leader in our case the pastor or they some people might speak against brother brandham right why are things so hard in Leo deia maybe brother Bram didn't do his job of course he did his job Hallelujah he's a genuine prophet of God hallelujah of course but they speak against the leadership and they complain like it's it's God's fault that they're in the S situation that they're in it's not God's fault it's God's plan the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord God had ordered this as a test Hallelujah and church think about this just because everybody else fails a test doesn't mean we have to brother Austin there was a joshu and Caleb saying I believe God will give us water amen the rest of the crowd's like well God has forsaken us we don't have no water shame on Moses but Joshua and K like praise God it's got to be around here somewhere praise God because God's with us God brought us out God won't bring us out to kill us God Will Make A Way Hallelujah there was two people that wouldn't say these things Joshua and Caleb got any joshuas or Caleb ETS out there any calebs out there yeah I see some some Joshua ETS out there yeah I see a few by God's grace Hallelujah and what did God do they tempted God they spoke against God and his servant and so they were destroyed of serpents but then God even gave in the midst of that God gave Grace and said just look and live just look to Jesus just look to the one who took away your sin who paid the penalty for your sin sin was already judged Jud Jesus Christ took the Judgment upon himself just look to Jesus and you're forgiven Hallelujah just look to Jesus and you'll be healed Hallelujah all right I've got 20 minutes left some of you are like how did that happen already some of you like it's about time verse 10 uh 1 Corinthians 10:10 now here's what we've experienced in our church lately I put it up there neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer so some some people tempted God put the fault on God other people murmured against god let's look at the the reference here numbers 142 and 29 numbers 142 and 29 numbers 142 and 29 so cor and daythan I preached it last week I think was in chapter 16 that was also murmuring right remember the Bible said they complained let me just get that reference for you if you want it the whole church complained uh against Moses it was number 1641 all the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron all right number and uh yeah now numbers 14 numbers 14 2 29 according to scoffield this is oh this that Kadesh barnea that's right okay they didn't want to take the promise thing verse one and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night so see that's the wrong kind of crying they're crying out of Despair that's worldly sorrow we need Godly sorrow Hallelujah cry and say God raise my faith God I'm going to cry but it seems it seems I'm emotional right it seems like things are hard but I'm still going to believe Hallelujah but they're crying worldly sorrow verse two and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said to them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in the wilderness so sad verse 29 your carcasses shall fall in this Wilderness so in other words you're not going to make the baptism of the Holy Ghost now none of us are perfect brother BR like I said brother Bram battle a critical spirit but I'm saying once you realize you got it repent of it and get that Spirit off you right verse 29 your carcasses shall fall in this Wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upward which have murmured against me see murmur against God or the five-fold ministry or brother brand people can murmur against whoever but look these are the sins look at this idolatry which was loud music and uh sexy dancing and sexy clothes fornication right going with the nominations or people just for sexual pleasure G unlawful Gatherings tempting Christ because you don't have water like it's the it's the preacher's fault or it's it's God's fault it's a test you just got to be a little more patient and then murmuring so he gives four what's the four number four is the number of the Earthly number so four trials on Earth murmuring these are the four and he said this is for us everybody say this is for me ready this is for me this is for you this is for me fornication murdering I'm sorry murmuring uh tempting the Lord idolatry this is for us uh no brother it's for some other Church I think we know it's for us hallelujah this is for the book of Acts Church Hallelujah that God is restoring I'm glad to be a part of it praise God so see we all need reminders brother man said his spirital I'm sorry his critical spirit was Haunting him there in the 50s and we know he battled all the way up to standing in the Gap 1963 where he said well if they won't receive it I'll just go up he said I lost the feeling of the people just like Moses when he said Rebels brother man was comparing himself to brother uh to brother Moses yeah there we go uh and then but then he got the victory right the the the angel said you're not an Old Testament Prophet you have many Apostolic gifts right you're a new testament prophet and we've just come through this tell it to the church situation and the main sin that I saw was murmuring false accusations Hallelujah so I found this church the Bible's always applicable to our lives praise God whether I'm preaching in Corinthians whether I'm preaching in Hosea about backsliding whether I'm preaching a revelation about the Seven Seals there's always going to be something that applies to the church hallelujah it's an eternal book praise God that's right Glory I can see I'm probably not going to get through this chapter today maybe we'll see because some of it's review like uh the last uh the last 10 verses are very repetitive they say a lot of the same things Romans 14 say so we'll see we might we might get verse 11 now all these things happen unto them for amples okay so we're supposed to learn all these things happen for the New Testament Church why oh that just makes it more beautiful with the three works of Grace right because we would have to come out of Egypt right justification we'd have to go through the red sea water baptism we'd have to go through the Wilderness sanctification and then we want to possess the promised land we want to go into the baptism of the Holy Ghost there it is new heart new spirit my spirit three works of Grace Cam and I just recorded or yeah we last week we recorded the next podcast on the um on the Bible versions and we saw numerous of these verses they changed to get rid of the three works of Grace the dominations do not like three works of Grace and they'll throw every dirty word at you oh you're a legalist you're a heretic uh no uh they say you haven't been to school no I've been to the school of the scripture like brother brandom said I've been to the school of scripture you're the one trying to change the Bible not me I'm trying to stay with the Bible and the church said remember he said don't add one word don't take one word away and you know do you know what the uh the new the new versions do to Revelation 18 they say uh if any man taketh away the words of the life Words of Life from this book The the Amplified cam showed it to me the Amplified says his part will be taken out of the Tree of Life church that's a see see the the Slick lie of that that's not what the Bible says the Bible said Your name's taken out of the Book of Life see what the new versions do oh now well you just miss out on a few bites of fruit in the future home Austin that's all they miss out on for changing the Bible but you still get to be there uh no you don't the Bible said Your name's not even in the book see how the devil see why they do that because the devil's anointing these people well well I'm going to take words away but I'm still going to be saved no you're not not if you take away the words of God on I'm talking about on purpose Hallelujah right just like blasphemy blasphemy if it's done ignorantly well God will look past that and if you're real real child of God you'll repent of that we saw it right we see it when we preach on that on backsliding and uh uh yeah the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost when brother Chris heard on that and he was uh hearing the same thing God was discerning in the thoughts and Tents of his heart so Church all these things all these five experiences plus these four sins were written for our help and our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come think about that church we're living right at the end of the world we're living right at the end we can look back and see oh my all this has happened to get the bride to get a bride ready for Jesus Oh My Hallelujah and I know feels like you got your whole life in front of you that's how I felt 21 years ago and when I heard the message too or 24 now oh my goodness I heard the 2021 yes I'm sorry 2001 so 24 years ago but it's going to go like this so make sure you give every yeara make sure because the years are just going to go like this make sure you give every year to Jesus Christ no matter when he comes you're ready when he comes Hallelujah so we can see the end of the world conditions verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take he lest he fall don't raise your hands but how many think you're standing for Christ today all right well then you then you're given a direct command since you think you're standing you better take you better check up and make sure you don't fall how many people have we seen fall in our church fall into one of these sins that we've been through right we've seen it so many times I've seen it so many times over the years that's why I've told people in my office I don't care who leaves or comes or goes I'm going to serve Jesus because my faith isn't in somebody else my faith is in Christ I don't have the faith of sister so- and so I don't have the faith of brother so and so I don't have the faith of my mom I got the faith of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's the faith I got Hallelujah my hope is built on nothing less than brothers so and so and righteous no than Jesus blood and righteousness that's what my hope is built on so let people come and go I've seen it for almost two decades they just come and go let them keep going the real believer will keep walking on with Christ Hallelujah that's right amen that's right let him that thinks he stands in this message take heed lest he fall so be careful that you don't fall to one of these sins as well idolatry fornication tempting Christ murmuring this is for our admonition this is for our correction and don't forget church this is all written right after verse 25 in chapter 9 said every man that striveth for the Mastery who's striving for the Rapture you must be temperate in all things so it doesn't mean you're not going to be tempted you're going to be tempted with idolatry you're going to be tempted with fornication or adultery or something like that you're going to be tempted to speak against God you're going to be tempted to murmur against and complain but if you got the anointing of the Holy Ghost you'll overcome it because you have control over these things Hallelujah that's what it is it's self-control it's the control of the Holy Spirit over this human Temple because the temple of God is your body which Temple you are the temple the Holy Ghost so this is the context I'm trying to win a race Glory I'm trying to get to the promised land or for me I'm trying to stay in the promised land I'm trying to drive out all now all these Devils that are trying to invade my land I'm I'm trying to fight them and drive them out because I'm already there but I'm still fighting battles I'm still pushing the Giants Out Sister beatress Hallelujah remember they had to drive out the Giants so there was Giants before I could show that Moses that they they fought Giants uh there uh in in the sanctification but they also fought Giants in the land as well that's right so see you're going to have giants either way let's get to the promised land where there's power amen let's get to the promised land where we've got the promise of verses that give us Victory we can enjoy the blessings of God where all things are possible to them that believe hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord now let's remember this I love this verse some people misunderstand this verse but I I've just been be I've become aware of it recently there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man you're not the only one that's battled that you're not a special case that uh uh well no one's ever been tested as hard as me that's why I can give in that's a lie well I I should have pity on myself no one's been through what I've been through that's a lie somebody's been through through it it's common to all men someone has been through the difficulties you've been through and you've heard me say before I've never been tempted like job and I don't want to be I I'm not going to ask for that that's just one simple example when was the last time all your family died on the same day your wife your children every I'm not wife your all your children you lost all your money on the same day and you lost your health not long after that it's never happened to anybody here very very few people I ever know had this ever happened to let's not act like we're job if we're not like job right this is common we've all you the same battle you fought I probably fought it in some other way just a little different uh a little different approach from Satan I love this but God is faithful we all we all get tested but God remains faithful I'm glad when I'm unfaithful God is faithful still Hallelujah Glory I can say someone's some preacher's been through this before I'm not the only preacher that's been through this before I'm not the only one that's been tested like this there's been some other preacher I love when I can find it right in the Bible sister be I love when I can find somebody just went through this just like I am right and I can gain courage from that praise God and God will be faithful if I want to overcome it God will help me overcome it praise God let's be the let's be in the group that want to overcome it and not give into it brother Chris gave a good reminder to me last week he and I were talking there and I it's probably okay that I share this cuz I'm just going to leave out this the specifics but he said he was tempted recently in an area and he said he went right to his Bible and got Victory he said he felt the demons leave he said but then a couple weeks later it came uh the the the Temptation came harder and it he went to the Bible and it didn't leave and he said brother Jesse what happened and I said the verse just came to my mind that demon went and got seven more and came back and he said and he said 'w why can't I overcome because now you're fighting eight of them instead of one I said so you've got to go to Greater lengths to overcome eight if I was in a fight with eight people I'd fight differently than just one person hallelujah thank God I'm not the most we've done at Ty one knows too you fight two people at a time Eight's another story but he he's like that's right brother Jesse oh yes he said uh so we were talking about that and that's a good reminder for us all just because we've defeated something in the past doesn't mean it's going to stay away it's actually coming back next time and we got to be more willing and more able and more uh in tune with God to be able to overcome it the next time Hallelujah but don't forget God's faithful Hallelujah he will make a way look at the verse says he won't allow you he won't allow you to be tempted above your strength and that includes his strength right because you're not fighting your battle all alone right you're fighting a battle that's already been won he's given you the power Jesus overcame all these sins so now now his spirit's in you so you can overcome all those sins Hallelujah but will with the Temptation he'll make a way see that's why I love that song God will make a way where there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see right he will make a way for me this is in Temptation right whether you got one demon or you got eight demons I don't know if they double after I I don't know if they get seven more and then we get uh 15 I don't know I don't know if it keeps increasing like that but either way we've got the sword of the spirit you got the you've got the greatest weapon that was ever given to man Hallelujah God gave you the greatest weapon it is written God says this God says that we've got the greatest weapon so Whom Shall We Fear Hallelujah right who are we going to be afraid of a bunch of devils or we're going to fear God let's fear God hallelujah we fear God more than we fear Devils let's keep his word hallelujah so your your experience that's not that's not so hard that you can't overcome let's not see that's why I was telling uh somebody we don't want to we don't want to baby Spirits I'm not going to Baby Spirits you shouldn't baby spirits and give into evil spirits whether acting sad or however they're acting whether they're acting real friendly or whether it's like Delilah oh I love you so much don't give in Devil Spirits Hallelujah don't give into them and I thought of this this morning Church you're going to be tempted to lie like Abraham but but you'll tell the truth hallelujah you'll be tempted to commit adultery like David but you'll be faithful to your vows right you'll be tempted to curse God like his wife said why don't you curse God and die you'll be tempted to that but you'll overcome and you'll bless God hallelujah why because God's going to make a way out Hallelujah you'll be tempted to exalt yourself like you bunch of rebels I'm the only one you name call everybody in the church but you'll overcome and as we've seen some people might strive for power like cor and Dayan but not the the children of God the children of God will submit to the word of God hallelujah you'll be content with what God has given you Hallelujah well I I know Heaven's amen and by God's grace you might run from God's call like Jonah but God's going to come running after you praise God that's God's mercy God's goodness is running after you he's going to chase you down get you on the right path right that's right Hallelujah see in the in the time of Temptation he'll make a way for you to escape and you'll be able to Bear it oh man I'm down to two minutes unbelievable okay can't believe that now some some people have said this um well the Bible says Temptations will never be above your ability or in the Greek it means power or that's what I like right here resources brother brandham says it plainly we are no match for Satan Satan's more than a match for us so when we when we realize that we're we're we you know we'll never have a Temptation uh that we can't overcome it's talking about we have to take Christ's word to do it of our own selves none of us could defeat Satan but with Christ we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus Jesus Hallelujah because greater the sources we have is the spirit of God the resource we have is the sword of the spirit the word of God greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world Hallelujah he makes a way Escape because he is the way the truth and the life now so I heard a preacher say this but he was using this in the next book to show that sometimes we are tested above Abel and I said no I think you misunderstood this for we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life now we don't have time to go there but in Acts 19 all this multitude came against Paul because he was against Diana and the silver smith remember that and remember Church they shouted for two hours so Paul's in this mob of people shouting to kill him for two hours and this is what he's talking about for two hours he thought this mob was going to rip him to pieces this is what he's talking about and he said this is pressed out of measure so this this felt like it was above anything I could handle this was above my strength because he's surrounded by a mob and angry mob wanting to kill him shouting for two hours let's kill Paul let's kill Paul now church if then you read chapter 20 the first thing he does he's he gets out of there he says let's go to another city let's get out of this place because these guys are going to kill me but see he says it seems like in this case there's my hour he said it felt like I was pressed all the pressure and all the violence coming around me I felt like it was I was pressed out of measure and I despaired even of life in other words job said I wish I wasn't born remember Jeremiah he cursed the day he was born such Trials of being arrested and thrown into a pit almost drowning in a pit of mud just for preaching the gospel just telling him thus sayith the Lord and he said but we have the sentence of death in ourselves that means they knew they were going to die so for two hours the men are violent pushing and the the crowd is surround him he's like I'm just going to die here he thought he was pressed above measure like he couldn't handle it but what happened church that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raised the dead so what happened he delivered us hallelujah see it wasn't above measure it felt like it but it wasn't he he had to wait two long hours but after when was the last time you fought sin for two hours now I'm talk that's what I was talking about brother Chris you got to fight longer than five minutes Paul thought I'm dead for two hours I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead but finally God come down delivered his servant out of there and he said why did he do this because in whom we trust that he would now when he was pressed beyond what he thought was measure now God had a chance to teach him I'll even protect you in this too Hallelujah so now trust you more next time because you were with me in the midst of this fire you'll be with me again you've taught me a lesson greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world hallelujah amen so see God's going to allow us to go through a new season right a harder test than we've ever had before we've just come through a hard test in our church we haven't had one like this like I told you we have never had to tell to the church before but in each time if we keep true to God God will give us more grace amen and will'll learn to trust God the next time God will Deliver us from our trials it will teach us to trust in God see they some people say oh see this is th this this negates or it does away with First Corinthians 10:13 it can't it's got to all it's got to all be harmonious church it's all written by the Holy Ghost God will not allow you to go through something that you cannot handle you might have to hold on for hours but God will bring bring you through it if you want a way out of it Hallelujah so this proves they were able to withstand the trial although they thought they were going to die they just hung on to God God brought them through Hallelujah now I've had a few times just I've just had a few times where I was near death right some car accidents like like I told you on the way to college we spun my buddy was going 90 miles per hour I'm like dude slow down and he slam on the brakes and we slid across four lanes and as soon as we stopped right by the the concrete barrier then all these 18 wheelers drove by God spared my life there now I thought I was going to die in Guyana when I first got there because we're driving through the the city and there was these men with machine guns and they were staring at and the the guy said they don't like Christians very much here like oh God have mercy what did I sign myself up for but you know I what I'm saying is I haven't been that close but the times that I had been close and I felt like the planes were going to crash and we were flying through lightning and thundering and storms the times that I had been close God is held the Anchor's held Hallelujah and I haven't even been that close other than the car accidents which thank God God's protected us so see God will press us maybe beyond what we thought we could handle but in every case God is faithful God Will Make A Way Out of the Temptation or the trial every understand that all right that's my hour so yeah I should probably stop here let's see it probably be a good spot to stop right here where therefore my dear dearly beloved flee from idolatry so he ends this section actually verse 15 is the next one but I'll just read it I speak as to wise men judge ye what you say now did I yes I did so think about this idolatry loud m music drunkenness dancing sexual sin fornication mixed meetings with with people that aren't in the message really have the Holy Ghost tempting Christ getting mad at God murmuring against anyone any leader or anybody in the church it don't have to be the leader it could be anybody in the church murmuring against all these were written that we would learn and that and that we would do this in the moment of Temptation my dearly beloved we must flee from idolatry you must run from that situation here's what it means and I'm closing with that so just so you can see what does flee mean in the Greek you go that's the English way to say to escape You Must Escape murmuring we must escape tempting Christ right don't join in with that kind of sin right the Bible said you that are are Meek go to them and try to correct them but be careful that that Spirit doesn't jump on you that's what the Bible says Galatians 61 and2 so what must what must we do church when we're tempted to flee away seek safety by flight to flee to shun just shun that thing just don't give it any attention get away from it as fast as you can flight run away from it drive away from it something abhor especially vices do everything in your power to get away from temptation to be saved by flight to escape safely out of danger poetically to flee away to vanish out of that atmosphere vanish out of the people and away from the people that do all those sins Hallelujah this is what advice would would a prophet of God give us vanish out of it Escape out of it flee from it do not partake in it and the church said amen all right let's stand on our feet I'm not going to get to this I could probably preach a couple hours here but I want to be mindful of the time musician malind video can come here by God's grace how many appreciate 1 Corinthians chapter 10 praise God appreciate that what a great reminder for us who's this written for written for us oh you know this is for somebody else no no no no this is for bride of Christ Fellowship this is for me this is for you I need this kind of preaching we all need this kind of preaching if you think you're standing if you think you're so strong today you better take heed lest you fall because we've how we've seen the Mighty Fall think about that David song how the Mighty Fall people we think are so mighty spiritually and such gifted uh gifted people and I'm talking about all over all the years all these people people I thought preachers that I thought were so so anointed and I've seen them fall how the Mighty Fall may God have mercy on us let's take heed to our lives today let's bow our heads for a word of prayer uh play uh spirit of living God fall fresh on me because if we let the spirit of God fall fresh on us then we won't let these other spirits of uh tempting God murmuring idolatry fornication sexual sins we won't let those Spirits fall on us if the spirit of God is on us I just saw this morning as you play that Malachi just what did I read in Isaiah where is it yeah my chapter this morning I'm going to read this church this is what I believe happened remember we preached on at the beginning of this series God gives you the desire your heart God gave balam what he really wanted he wanted money he wanted to be an evil teacher so God gave it to him I read this in Isaiah this morning Isaiah 19:14 the Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof and they have caused Egypt to air in every work thereof as a drunken man stagger in his vomit so what am I saying I'm saying just like this Corinthians chapter here God sometimes allows God allows evil spirits to come in there to see if the people are going to overcome or not God mingled it didn't the Bible say God sent the evil spirit on sa isn't that what the Bible said it's right there in First Kings I'm sorry it's 1st Samuel 6 put put that up there 1st Samuel 16:14 God allowed this in here you think was it brother Jesse's fault was it my fault was it the sister's fault God allowed it it's a test remember God allowed three million people to have no water and the church said what kind of God would do that a a wise God who wants to see who will watch their tongue who will trust in God for just a few more hours by God's grace who can hang on a few more hours glory to God Amen put that up there H would you uh 1st Samuel 16 I got four Witnesses sometimes God allows these evil spirits to come in to see which side we're going to stand on but the spirit of Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from who the devil no God allowed it because Saul was angry and jealous of David so God gave him what he wanted God allowed that put up uh First Kings 22:22 this is with Mah we preached on this I think last week and the Lord said to him wherewith and he said I will go forth and I'll be a lying spear in the mouth of All His prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him go forth and do so God sends the lying Spirit to test the people are going to stand with M and Elijah you going to stand with brother Bram or you going to stand with the people sinning last one job 1 vers2 yep is it 1:12 I can't read my uh Chicken Scratch and the Lord s to Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord God allowed Satan to go do this if you think you're standing today you better take heed lest you fall and the church said a fresh reminder from God's Prophet Paul and God's Prophet brother Bram how many appreciate that let's thank God for today hallelujah praise God what a good reminder let him take he look at your life let's look at our lives today lest we fall to some of these spirits that the Lord has allowed to test us and try us father God we thank you for today Lord I bow my head in reverence to you Lord Jesus Lord to think we were for told about this by a minister Lord God who shut in and fasted and preached Lord God we've been prepared Lord by your grace you are so kind and so loving we see here in the scripture you test your people you don't give them any water you let them get to dry places at times Lord and you test them who's going to watch the Gate of their lips that they not speak evil you let them get to a spot where there's no Prophet around anymore how they going to act when there's no prophet [Music] you let them get and hear about invitations to group Gatherings that seem seem like there's some good there but there's also a bunch of sin there too they're tested by hearing about the invitations they hear somebody say some murmuring against somebody or or God even and Lord we're tested are we going to join in or we going to flee from these things Lord help us Lord Jesus we've been admonished by the word of God these are written for our sakes in the New Testament oh it's so sad these people that say they don't need the Old Testament God help them Lord Jesus we need it now more than ever Lord God to learn to understand Lord where we are father I pray you'd bring every person Lord God hallelujah out of Egypt through the Red Sea through sanctification into baptism of the Holy Ghost into the promised land bring your people Lord God I pray into the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord God and Lord today May each person take heed of their lives lest they fall Lord I don't want to be one of those that's talked about well he fell away and he did that I want to be one that's talked about by God's grace he's still standing on the word of God Only by the grace of God only because greater is he that's in our brother or sister than he that's in the world help us Lord God help us remember the words of Paul I I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me when it seems like death might be around or I have no resources or I feel all alone maybe remember we just got to hold on a little longer Lord God help us to hold on Lord Jesus a little longer keeping the word of God keeping the spirit of God on us Lord may we cast out any evil spirit any Temptation you're faithful Hallelujah we know Lord God you'll give us a way out if we keep trusting in
