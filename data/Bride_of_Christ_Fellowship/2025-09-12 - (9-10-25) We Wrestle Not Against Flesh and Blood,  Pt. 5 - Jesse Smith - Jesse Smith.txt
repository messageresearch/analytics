========================================

you. I love you. God bless you. You know, just seeing all you makes me want to cry because I'm so thankful that you're here tonight and love you and appreciate you. Thankful for uh opportunity to be with the saints by God's grace. So, just always want to cherish life, don't we? We just want to uh &gt;&gt; cherish what God has given to us and be thankful in every uh every situation. Ephesians 6:10, 11, and 12. I think for time sake, because we've preached on this numerous times, I'll probably just read verse 12. Ephesians 6:12. We've done four parts on uh wrestling not against flesh and blood. So, this will be part five tonight. Uh by God's grace, If we can, if you're there, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read this on three. 1 2 3. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. May God add his blessing to the reading of the word. You may be seated. So, we want to look at this here again tonight. Uh, by the grace of God, you I've already had a runny nose, you know, so I apologize. I'm kind of bad, a little runny nose this week. And then now I'm kind of emotional about today's uh assassination. Um, but um just bear with me here if I got to wipe my nose and blow my nose a little bit by God's grace. Uh, so we want to look at uh wrestling not against flesh and blood. Uh, I had this thought to preach, you know, weeks ago and then I kind of forgot about it. I went to brother Cam's church. I preached this at brother Cam's and uh, you know, at the end of the service, you know, Cam always comes up and boy, he I tell you, he's so gifted, brother Rod, at picking up the anointing. So, when I leave the pulpit, he gets up there and it's like it's like he's going to preach and like he's ready to go like locked and loaded. like he just gets under that anointing and he starts preaching and I'm, you know, I'm down here saying amen and loving it. I'm raising my hands. Might it might be on YouTube. That part's probably on YouTube. And Cam starts preaching and he says something just really beautiful. Uh which I'll share in just a moment. Um but you know, in the first four parts, you know, saints, we're looking at all the different evil spirits that we might wrestle, right? We saw how there's four layers or at least uh four different classifications of evil spirits we might wrestle right in verse 12. We see there's principalities, there's powers, there's rulers of the darkness of this world and there's spiritual wickedness in high places. So now there's either four levels or maybe those are just different titles to the same thing. It could be that too because remember in Revelation 12, Satan is called that old dragon, that old serpent, uh, Lucifer, Satan, you know, I'm missing one. There's one one more in there. Um, that the wicked one it might be. And so he's given many titles, but he only has one name, right? Lucifer is his name. And now he's called uh Lucifer means the bright one, the shining one. Um but now he's called Satan the adversary uh the accuser. uh but you know by God's grace uh whether it's four different layers or whether it's uh you know four different uh meanings of the same uh battle or or same realm I'd say uh we we wrestle against evil spirits and uh you know through this series we tried to look you know I felt most impressioned here you know uh to look at like what Jesus said Jesus said cares of this world and riches and then what I've seen in the message I I I felt led to preach a lot on porn and lust and everything like that. You know, those were those were the three main ones that I was dealing with uh in these series, you know, fear, the cares of the world, that means anxieties of this world. &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus said that'll choke you out if you're not careful. You get so uh anxious about things of life that you don't have any testimony, you don't have any praise, uh you don't have any witnessing ability. Uh but if if you're in that condition, we saw God can give you overcoming power. God can renew your strength and you can get back up your up on your feet and start fighting for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to live in fear. We don't have to live in anxiety. And I' I've told you different stories about me how I've battled that the last few years, you know, maybe more than ever, you know, uh but God knows and God allows it. God allows it. Um I was studying on uh the other series God hiding himself in simplicity and and brother Random said this about Moses. He said God let him get trained for 40 years in the wisdom of Egypt. That's the smartest wisdom on the earth. Brother Ram said God did did this only to show him that it would fail him. &gt;&gt; Imagine that. a 40-year lesson of natural studies and then it takes 40 years to beat that out of him. Brother Brandham said on the backside of the wilderness, &gt;&gt; God used twothirds of his life just to show him you're nothing. And then God also let him become a murderer. That that just that's so hard for me to understand. But God's ways are higher than our ways. &gt;&gt; And so we realize, you know, our lives are every footsteps or every footstep is order the Lord. You have to forgive me. I'm just kind of not really with it here like I normally would maybe would be by God's grace. I'm just a little uh just a little emotional here tonight. But uh you know those are the three we looked at the cares of riches. You know um I don't know how much that battles maybe so many people here just wanting to be rich. I feel like I'm just struggling just to get by. Praise God. uh just to try to save up and uh you know deal with inflation. &gt;&gt; I don't really I never want to be rich. I just would I'd like to have just peace, you know, and not have to worry about everything, you know. I've gone through scenes of life where I haven't had to. I'm thankful for that. Uh and we're blessed abundantly just beyond measure, you know, many times overall compared to the whole world as our sisters from Africa know. We're blessed beyond measure. Um, but you know, yet yet we're still we're still we still have to wrestle that. We still have to wrestle and not get choked out by &gt;&gt; uh financial concerns. I'll just say it like that because I'm not trying to be rich, but the finances do sometimes they get stressful &gt;&gt; just like uh fears about, you know, violence as we saw today. You know, there's there's fears about that and uh there's always been nuclear war fears since the 40s, right? There's always been brother Ram on the tapes. Brother Rod, Brother Brandham always is telling people, "Don't fear that. Trust in God." He he'd always say, "Get under the shelter of Jehovah's Wings." &gt;&gt; You know, they had uh all those sellar shelters. Do you remember what they were called? Or &gt;&gt; bomb shelters. &gt;&gt; Bomb shelters. Yeah. And he said, "Get under the bomb shelters of Jehovah's Wings." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jehovah eagle. Rest under his wings. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, there's that was a definitely a fear in that day. And so, you know, we have fears in this day, of course, as well. uh every age has its fears. Uh and then you know we looked at uh you know pornography and the lust of of the eyes and so forth. And you know I heard a I heard a interesting stat this week uh from a preacher from Africa. Uh and I I like a lot of his preaching but some of it I disagree with. You know I feel like he lifts brother Ram too high and but I'm you know I don't call his name because I don't I have nothing against it brother. I really enjoy a lot of his preaching. But he's preached a lot of youth meetings and regarding uh you know lust and porn. He said when he started teaching youth camps, he gave out uh surveys to the youth that were anonymous so they didn't have to put their names on them. And he especially asked the young men and the and the young so these are the young people uh anywhere from 13 to 20 something right in the message right message. So I want you to catch that. Beatric and Naomi message people. And he asked these young people how many are addicted to porn? He said 90% of the boys were and he said 60% of the girls were in one form or another. Now that could be reading that could be reading just books, magazines. So he, you know, that just really struck me, you know, as I was talking about wrestling. You know, it's never been easier for Satan to show people porn than than today. So the the young people, male and female, need to know how to wrestle against these evil spirits. &gt;&gt; And he was making the point, I might share it with you, Sister Naomi, Sister Beatatric. I was going to share it with my wife. And he was making the point, you've got to be the first, try to be the first one to talk to your children about this area. &gt;&gt; Just educate them about uh reproduction, human reproduction, because they're, think about that. They're either the the first person they're going to hear from is either filled with the Holy Ghost or filled with demons. &gt;&gt; And so if they can have the if they can have the the instruction, the education from a Holy Ghost fililled person, it's way better. They'd be able to recognize if they're living right. And if they have a pure heart, they able to recognize, oh, that's the devil. &gt;&gt; That's not pleasing to God. &gt;&gt; Right? And every natural human reaction, the first time you see something like you know, oh that's wrong. I mean, you you know, because you have such an innocence from God, you know, and we're thankful for that. But, uh, you know, for these four services, I preached on just wrestling against, you know, uh, whatever evil spirit you might battle. But Cam brought out this thought and he just said it so plainly. He said, and I'm just paraphrasing. I'm probably chopping it up, so forgive me. But, uh, I want to look at this tonight. But brother Cam and as I was preaching, you know, I did preach something there that I didn't preach here when Jacob wrestled with the angel. And I just I just glanced over it, saints, you know, I didn't give them anything I wouldn't give you, but I just glossed over that, you know, and brother Cam comes up under the anointing. It's just amazing, Malcol. It's like a switch. He can get up there. He goes from just, you know, Cam to preacher mode like instantly. And I've seen him do it many times. He can just really get under that anointing. And he starts preaching like like he's been up there for two hours like I was. And he looks at the congregation, you know, he said, "Just like brother Jesse preached." He said, "So many times we're always worried about wrestling cigarettes." Now, because there's somebody in the church wrestling cigarettes. They got to wrestle porn. You got to wrestle fear. He said, "So many times we're doing that." He said, he said, "We would do better if we just got our mind off wrestling that." And we started wrestling with God. And that just hit me like a ton of bricks. Like, oh, that's right. And church. And I thought about Job. And I thought when he was complaining and everything's going wrong, he's wrestling with his emotions, &gt;&gt; right? Wrestling with, well, this is my family. What about my money? And what about here &gt;&gt; and what about my cattle? And what about my home? And and when So, he's wrestling with these thoughts and wrestling with God. And what does God do? God shows him his character and his ability. &gt;&gt; So in his we'd say his darkest moment, his moment where he had the least amount of hope, his moment of his biggest question. Remember he said, "I'm full of confusion, at his lowest spot, God doesn't even answer his question. God just tries to show him how little you are, how vile you are, and how great I am. And so I thought just for a few minutes tonight we'll look at when we wrestle with God with God. So Jacob is the first one that we see wrestling with God in Genesis 32. So if you have your Bibles, let's go there. And I thought, you know, many times, what what is he wrestling? You know, what what is why does this have to wrestle? Why does he have to wrestle? Now he meets God right before uh he wrestles God. Let's go to Genesis actually 32:1. And Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's host." And he called the name of that place Meahanim. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau's brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. And he commanded them, saying, "Thus shall you speak unto my lord Esau, thy servant Jacob saith, thus I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now, and I have oxen and assa's flocks, and men's servants, woman servants, and I have sent to tell my lord that I may find grace in thy sight." So we see he's afraid of his brother. So the wrestling match here is fear. Jacob's afraid because his brother vowed to kill him. &gt;&gt; And look how he butters him up. I got all this money. Oh my lord. When did he become your Lord? &gt;&gt; Now, we know Lord, you know, Sarah called Abraham Lord. So, we know there's a Lord form of deity and then there's just a respectful way to use Lord. &gt;&gt; Right now, my wife's never called me Lord, but she could. Okay. So, there's just a little hint, honey. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. She shakes her. Give me the side eye. I call you princess then. No, I'm just joking. Of course. But church, look at what he says. You know, he says in verse uh 7, then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. Verse 8, "And if Esau come to one company and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape." And Jacob said, "Oh God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which says unto me, return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal deal well with thee." So now, what does he do? Now, as he starts praying, he's in he's in fear. He starts praying and what does he do, church? He starts quoting the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Now, how many know that's the way to pray? &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, you said this." &gt;&gt; That's not what I said. It's what you said. &gt;&gt; I can always make my request kn. But God doesn't have to honor my request. But God does have to honor his word. &gt;&gt; His general word to the believer, he does have to honor that. And he will honor that. &gt;&gt; So, he's afraid for his life. But God had told him, "I'm going to do deal well with thee." Well, that's right. And we picked it up last night. He lived 147 years. This man got to live almost 150. Almost 150. Now, I love this prayer. This is one of the most beautiful prayers. I've repeated this numerous times. I forgot about it, but over the years, I keep coming back to it. Look at verse 10. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies of God. &gt;&gt; I think anybody could say amen to that here tonight. I don't deserve anything good from God as far as me being able to earn it. &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy of it. Well, Brother Jess, you did that. I did nothing. &gt;&gt; It's all by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Remember John 15:5, he said, "Apart from me, you can do nothing." So if anything good came out of my humble little insignificant life, then I finally surrendered to Jesus and Jesus could finally use this old vessel of clay. &gt;&gt; It wasn't me. It was Christ in me. And he says, I'm not worthy of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant. I'm not worthy of this message. Brother had another sermon to preach. I was going to go through the rest of those thus sayith the Lords because we had thus say the Lord but maybe next time but with this assassination happening I thought well this seems like be the right way to go. I'm not worthy of a message like this that everything I can believe I can take it back to the Bible right now. There's things we wonder but it's not it's not a major the major things are thus sayeth the Lord in the Bible. I'm not worthy of a message like this. &gt;&gt; I don't deserve it. He says, "Which thou has shown unto thy servant. For with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I'm become two bands. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he will come smite me and the mother of I'm sorry, mother with the children. As thou said, so see now he's quoting that word again. As you said, Lord, I will surely do thee good. Make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude." Okay, now just I just want to skip forward. But what happens is Jacob's so afraid he sends everybody before him to meet Esau. &gt;&gt; Now church, was that a manly thing to do? &gt;&gt; That was not a manly thing to do. You mean you're going to let your wife and your children meet your archeneemy before you do? Truth. This shows he really needed a spiritual change in his life. &gt;&gt; He was a slave to fear. The Bible said greatly distressed, right? great fear, greatly afraid and distressed. Now he sends everybody over. Then in verse 24, and Jacob was left alone. That's exactly what God knew he needed. He couldn't rely on his wives. Oh honey, honey, let me He couldn't rely on his children. He was left with him and God alone. &gt;&gt; Church, that's what you will find, church. Many times when we need victory in our lives, God has to get us all alone with himself. &gt;&gt; Where there's nobody, no distraction, no one's around. It's just you and God. &gt;&gt; And there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. Now, in this place, he calls it God, but other places said he wrestled an angel. So, it's either God in it in his angelic form or it was just the fact that the angels carry the presence of God like the Bible says. &gt;&gt; The Bible calls it the angel of his presence. &gt;&gt; So, when you feel the Holy Spirit, it could be an angel because it you feel the presence of God. It could be an angel. And we have angels camped around us here tonight. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And if I could say it like Elisha, oh God, open the eyes of Bride of Christ Fellowship. Amen. Open the pastor's eyes, too. open all of our eyes to see that there's more with us than there is with them. &gt;&gt; So he wrestles until the breaking of day. Now he's afraid and he's he's with this angel and he's wrestling the angel. Verse 25. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. And he said, "Let me go, for the day breakth." and he said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me." This is such an amazing story. Jacob seems to overpower the angel of God. An angel visits him and he so wants something that will strengthen him to be able to face his biggest fear. He's like, "Angel, I'm not letting you go. I need you to do something. I need a supernatural miracle." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he didn't wrestle for five minutes like we want to do. We wanted to wrestle five minutes in prayer and be done with it. But Jacob had to wrestle all night for this victory. &gt;&gt; This is why brother Ram Church would talk about some people need all night prayer. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Rod can correct me if I'm wrong, but not every person in the Bible had to do all night prayer. &gt;&gt; But some people in particular had to get Yes. Amen. Brother had to get in spots where they could they had to have a spirit. They had to seek God long, long hours. And remember, it's all for your good and it's all for a testimony to encourage others. &gt;&gt; So, this is a testimony for us that uh we should wrestle with God until we're changed. And brother would say it like this. You stay there and pray until &gt;&gt; if you need something from God and you really want it, then just pray until &gt;&gt; until you get something. Until you feel changed. That's happened to me one time. The first time I had a real close friend uh, you know, betray me in the church or get a critical spirit. I went into my furnace room, Malachi know, and I was crying. I said, "Oh, God, strengthen me." And I just kept I just stayed there. I don't know, maybe it was 20 minutes, 30 minutes, I don't know how long it was. I just stayed there until I felt the power of God come on me and I felt strong enough to deal with this. And then I got up and went and made the call to talk to them. I didn't know that was going to happen. I just was like, "Lord, you got to do something in my life. I can't believe this person treats me like this." But I stayed there until I got a change. &gt;&gt; And then I was able to face it and deal with it. And that's the best I felt out of the five times, you know, people have tried to come and uh, you know, accuse me of things. Uh, and each time they were wrong, as far as I understand. Um, but that was the one. So when I stayed there and prayed until I had some type of experience, it was just emotional worship and I just felt the love of God in my heart. I didn't I felt the fear of leave. That that that's the one I feel about the best. So that that to me that's the closest I could get to something like this with Jacob. He said, "Don't let me go till you bless me." So I'm I I'm full of fear. I need a blessing to get rid of fear. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, the same thing we apply to men. I need a blessing to get over this porn. &gt;&gt; I need a blessing to get over this uh cares for riches. &gt;&gt; Right? I need a blessing to get over this critical spirit. &gt;&gt; Or I need a blessing to get over this pride in my life. &gt;&gt; Now, here's what I've seen, too. We need a blessing to get over this bitterness. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, whatever wrestling match and and notice uh Jacob has to go to God to win this match. &gt;&gt; He doesn't go to fear to this. Now, church, do we cast Yes. Do we cast spirits down? Yes, we can cast them down. Yes, we can do that. But in this case, God wanted him to meet him, his presence face to face, whether through an angel or God in a theophony. 27 he said unto him, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy name shall be no more called Jacob, but Israel." In other words, I'm giving you a name change. I'm changing your identity. And church, that that's what uh that that's what the medical science wants you to do. Say, "I'm an alcoholic or I'm an addict or I'm a porn addict." That's they want you to change your identity. But you can't say that. You got to say, "I'm a Christian." Praise God. &gt;&gt; You can't let them You can't let them uh &gt;&gt; put a different identity on you. You have to You have to accept the name change God gave you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, like somebody might say, "Well, I'm bipolar." No, you just took on that spirit. &gt;&gt; Hey, I don't doubt any chemical change in your life. I don't doubt anything physically, but that still should not be our confession. &gt;&gt; That's not who I am. That's not who you are. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And so, see, people will take on identities and it's the wrong thing to do. You got to confess, I'm saved. I'm forgiven. I'm a victor. I'm an overcomer. I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, God has to do that to Jacob. You're no longer suppler or deceiver. I name you Israel. Amen. Praise God. Which means prince and power with God. Because he says, "For a prince thou hast power with God and with men and hast prevailed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Bible said uh and Jacob said to him, "Tell me, I pray thee thy name." And he said, "Wherefore is it that thou ask after my name?" And he blessed him there. You'll see Solomon wanted to know the name of the Lord too. Hallelujah. He said, 'What is thy I think he said, what uh what is thy son's name? What is thy name and the name of thy son? I think that was in Proverbs 30 and 31 if I'm not mistaken. And verse 30, and Jacob called the name of the place Pineal, for I've seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. Now, this doesn't contradict what the Bible said. No man has seen God at any time. It doesn't contradict that because Jacob's just saying, "I've seen an angel. I've seen a theophony. But God is invisible and no man will ever see the invisible spirit of God." &gt;&gt; So they they fit together perfectly. Hallelujah. And so then we see in the next chapter, you know, uh Jacob is able to face his biggest fear and God blesses him and now his greatest enemy has become a friend again. Praise God. Amen. His greatest fear is now washed away by the power of his experience. That's why church, some people need, like brother Adam was saying, some people uh need God to just take something out of them. Other people need to learn to wrestle in order to get the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. There's differences. There's different experiences, different things you're going to struggle with versus somebody else. And so, not everybody's experience is going to be the same. But I'll say it like this. If we love Jesus Christ, our character should be the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. because everything is working together for us to have more Christlike character. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm watching the time. Got about 15 minutes here by God's grace. So, here's the example uh of Jacob, you know, and church, think about, you know, think about different ones, you know, they had to uh David had to wrestle Satan, and Satan pinned him down and made him number the people. I shouldn't say made him, influenced him. Forgive me because remember the Bible said Satan tempted David. And remember the Bible said God was already angry with those 70,000 people. So God took advantage of both of their their weak. I'm sorry. Yeah. Satan took advantage of both of their weakness, right? And God allowed Satan to do that to show David his pride and also to punish these disobedient ones. &gt;&gt; Right? So God God was able to work with both in order to bring correction to both. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay? So we can see that quite plainly there. So so David gets wrestled down. A man after God's own heart gets wrestled down by Satan himself &gt;&gt; and loses the wrestling match. But church, don't let's not be I'm not I'm not doubting David. But thank God David got back up again. Praise God. Amen. How do you know? Because at the end of his life, he's still writing letters. Everything he says. He's still writing songs. At the end of his life, everything he said was beautiful. Praise God. And God accomplished getting Solomon on the throne. Hallelujah. Thanks to Basheba and of course David as well. those two working together. So if you asked Jacob, you know, what what was what was the what was your hardest wrestling match of your life? What would he say? God, it wasn't, oh, my two wives, you know, boy, just trying to deal with this one and that one. My goodness, this is so hard. You know, no doubt it was, you know, you would ask him, well, you know, did you struggle with fear, doubt? You know, what was your greatest wrestling match? He would said, "When I wrestled that angel, that was the greatest wrestling match of my life." Right? Some of us, what would we say? What was our greatest wrestling match ever? It's good to ask ourselves that. Praise God. It's good to know too that church when you're in a fearful situation or whenever you're in we say uh a lifealtering situation you've got to go and wrestle with God &gt;&gt; and say God change me &gt;&gt; change my heart change my outlook and just say this prayer like he did. I'm not worthy of this but I need delivered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Basically said I don't deserve the message. I don't deserve the truth. I I'm not worthy of anything, but deliver me. Keep your promise to me. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And God heard Israel. I'll say like that. Amen. No longer Jacob. God heard Israel. Amen. &gt;&gt; A prince with power with God and man. Hallelujah. Now, for time sake, I'm not going to be able to get into all these here uh by God's grace, but let's just hit a couple here. Uh, 2 Samuel 12:15. 2 Samuel 12:15. This is, of course, David's repentance, and Basheba has the child from their adulterous experience. 2 Samuel 12:15. And Nathan departed unto his house, and the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife bear unto David. but was very sick. David therefore besought God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth. So church, here we have David wrestling with God, right? What's he doing? He's laying there all night. God, if you could spare the child. Now, church, you, some of us might think that's ridiculous, but it's not. God had already spared David. &gt;&gt; He should have died for his adultery. He should have died for his murder. So if anybody knew about the mercy of God, if anybody believed in the mercy of God, it was David. Hallelujah. And church, that's what I found. When you've really receive mercy, you can give mercy. You can hope in mercy. When you've really accepted the mercy and the forgiveness of Jesus Christ, then you can pray for it for other people. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And then church, we can't forget Hezekiah. I'm not going to read it, but remember Hezekiah, he cries out to God. Now, we don't know how long his prayer was, but he turns his face towards the wall after Isaiah gives him, "Thus sayeth the Lord, set your house in order. You're going to die." And he cries out to God. He wrestles with the Lord. Lord, don't you know the integrity of my heart. I've served you with a perfect heart. And God tells him to go back and said, I've heard your prayer. Amen. I've heard your wrestling. Amen. In prayer. And I'm going to grant you, what was it, 15 more years? Was that what it was? Couldn't quite remember if it was 15 or 10. 15. Thank you, brother. So, we can see that there's these uh times to wrestle with the Lord. And I imagine David would probably say that was one of his hardest wrestling matches, you know, like God, please have mercy. It's a little child. I mean, look at our little babies. We got Thank God we got two little babies here tonight. And you know, Vang's baby's getting to be one year old now. You know, not much of a baby anymore. such a sweetheart. But you know, imagine pleading for one of them. God have mercy. Oh Lord, I I'm wrestling with you in prayer. Lord, I know you can do it. You forgave me, but then to come to the wrestling match and you lose that one. God doesn't give you what you want on that one. How how difficult that might be. But again, it's like Job. Now, let's read what Job said. I just want to read this briefly. Now Job recognizes in Job 9:32 and33 that there is neither any daysman betw twix us that might lay his hand upon us both. But but Job actually learns God does send some somebody. It's Elahu. God does send an intercessor. Remember Elahu starts picking up on the the the the proof of nature as God's proof of God's existence. He starts hitting into that before God does. Elahu caught the mind of Christ because he was a type of Christ. Now go to Job 13:3. Hun, let's read that one. Surely I was speak to the Almighty and desire to reason with God. In other words, I want to give God reasons why I'm right. So see, he's wrestling. He's wrestling in in this thought life. And what Lord, what could I I just want to talk to you to give you this reason so you'll know what I think. And church, God already knows what he thinks. &gt;&gt; God doesn't need to hear our reasons about why things should be different. God just wants us to obey. To obey is better than what, church? Sacrifice. God would rather have us obey than do some amazing religious sacrifice. So at this point, God didn't want Job to go get, you know, he didn't have any ox sacrifice, but God didn't want that. God wanted him just to obey, just to keep praising God, trusting God. God wanted him just to keep praising and not curse God. And God knew he wouldn't. Stay in chapter 13 22 and 23. Then call thou and I will answer. Or let me speak and answer thou me. How many are mine inquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin. So he's he's calling out to God. Lord, I'll call and you answer. I want to talk it over with you. Now, look at Job 23 3:4 and 5. Job 23 34 and 5. He gets even more uh more serious. Oh, that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat. I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments, arguing to God about why Job is right and God must have done something wrong. Talk about a wrestling match. Now, this one, he's just wrestling in his mind, right, brother Rody? He's not really wrestling an angel yet, right? He's just in his mind wrestling with I would tell God this. I'd tell brother Jesse that. I'd tell brother Angley that. Right. People got their bad attitudes. I tell brother Random this and that. &gt;&gt; They think they know all about it, right? Think think they got all these arguments, all these reasons why they're right. And most church, most time church, they got that kind of spirit, they're wrong. Because they're trying to pridefully exalt themselves. I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me. Now remember, he's confused during this time. He's saying good things and he's saying wrong things. because he's sleepdeprived and he has five layers of confusion and stress that you and I really know nothing about. Job 31:35. Th this is another time he says it right before God comes down. Job 31:35. Oh, that one would hear me. Behold, my desire is that the Almighty would answer me and that mine and that mine adversary had written a book. Exactly right. Amen, brother Rod. And the church said, "Amen. It's coming. God is going to give him an answer." As we went through it, over 75 total questions, including Aahu's questions and God's. I think Alahu did four or five. God did 70 or 69 or 68. 75 questions. God says, "Who is this? Did you measure the earth? Do you did you lay it on its foundations? Are you the father of rain? Where are the storehouses of hail and snow, Job?" So, see, every time we complain or wrestle with God, God is trying to change our perspective &gt;&gt; to get it off of ourselves and more to a eternal perspective. I think for the sake of the last one, uh, this one just always blessed me. Uh, the Lord Jesus. Let's go to Luke chapter 18. Luke chapter 18. Familiar passage. You know, I don't remember the last time I preached on it, but verse one. the parable of the unjust judge. Now, church, here's where we get into where God wants us to wrestle in prayer. And like brother Cam said, so I so it was just so striking to me like I was like, "Oh my, that's right." So many times, and brother Bam talked about it, remember talks about your sin like a serpent, right? And brother said, "Sometimes that we'll just sit at that serpent and try not to get by, try not to get bitten. We'll just try to stay away from it. And I rebuke you. I rebuke you. And brother man makes a statement, brother Rod. He said, he said, "What you can do though is just walk away from it." In other words, we focus all of our energy on this problem. In other words, just think about it all the time. But brother Cam brought that out. A lot of times we do that. We focus on the problem instead of going to talk to God about it. &gt;&gt; I thought that was a very inspired thing to say because we see Jacob doing it. We didn't have time, but I'm sorry. We saw David do it. We saw Job do it. We didn't have time, but Hannah did it. Abraham did it. He went from 50 down to 10. God, I'm wrestling with you, God. Please, please, God, please hear me one more time. Wrestling for souls. And he spake a parable unto this end that men ought to pray, not to faint. In other words, don't stop pleading your cause with God. That's what I love about Brother Rod. He would plead the blood. It's a wrestling match. God, I need you. God, forgive us. God, have mercy on us. God, we need your your tender kindness. We're not worthy of your mercies. The blood of Jesus wasn't shed out of my works. It was shed by grace to me because my works were evil, &gt;&gt; and I don't deserve it. Saying, there was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man. And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary." And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself, "Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleeth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming, she weary me." And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth. Let's stand to our feet. Uh musicians can come here. Now, church, one important thing we get out of here is verse seven. They pray day and night. Day and night. Now, nighttime is honestly usually just a time of sleep for me, but there has been times I've woken up and I felt like God wanted me to pray. But Jesus records it. Jesus says there's going to be times to wake up and cry to God during the night. Praise the Lord. And then the whole time the Bible says that God is bearing long. God is bearing with that. God is understanding that. God is seeing all of our wrestling in prayer. &gt;&gt; Church, I always think about my dad. How many times in the last 40 some years have I prayed for my dad in tears pleading with God to have mercy on him and save his soul. Deliver him from addictions and uh depression. How many times? But what does the Bible say? God is bearing along with me. God hears me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My prayers aren't in vain. &gt;&gt; The time we really cry out to God and really ask God to move, God hears every time. But God's story is what's important. God's story is the right story. Praise God. It's his story. It's history. Praise God. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer here tonight. Dear Lord, we thank you for another opportunity to be in your presence. Lord God, I want to thank you again for a man like Jacob. Lord God, &gt;&gt; totally unworthy and he knows it. Lord, that's that tells my life story. That tells everyone's life story here. Father, thank you for putting that in the Bible. What a beautiful story. His greatest wrestling match wasn't with the spirit of murder, wasn't with jealousy between his wives. Perhaps it was with God. And Lord, I could see now that was Job's greatest wrestling match. Dear God, why is this happening to me? Why did this happen? What did I do? I want to give my arguments. I want to give my reasons why to God. I want to talk to God. Oh Lord, Lord, your ways are so much higher than our ways. If Job could have seen it, Lord, he would have looked at your ways and he would have seen in heaven you bragging about him. Then he would have felt sorry, which we know he did later. He said, "I abhore myself. I repent in dust and ashes." In other words, I'm not worthy of the least of all thy mercies. Dear Lord, you know what the people go through, Lord God. So I pray, Lord Jesus, for those that need a wrestling match with you, Lord, they really want to change. I pray you would grant it to them, Lord God. Over the years, I've seen it numerous times, people laying at the altar or waiting in the prayer line or and they just wait until pray until. Brother Random called it praying through. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praying through the waiting process. Praying through the tiredness. Praying through the confusion. Praying through the timer. [Music] Like on the day of Pentecost, the Bible said when it was fully come, 10 days of just waiting, praying through until God moved on the scene. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Lord, it's such a scriptural truth, God, that we just got to get our eyes off the trial and get our eyes on you, Lord God. Oh God, help us to get alone with you, Lord God. Help us, Lord Jesus. I pray [Music] that God, that we're alone with you, Lord, we can really see what's in our heart. You'll speak something truly in our heart, dear God. And you'll give us a change, dear God. Hallelujah. And we'll know we've had a name change. We'll go from fear to powerful, from fearful to powerful. Lord God, Lord Jesus, you did it in an Old Testament form, Lord. We'd say, "How much more can you do it under the blood of Jesus Christ, which has a better covenant, with better promises, Lord God?" Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And on this night, Lord, with this assassination, Lord, I kind of in my heart, Lord God, I just want to ask you, Lord, just give me peace, God, and bless that family as they mourn, dear God. protect and provide for his wife and those two children. May those children be raised to love you, Lord God. I saw the video of the daughter running to her daddy a couple weeks ago and she could never do that again. But Lord, may she run to the arms of Christ, dear God. That'd be the greatest the greatest run she could she could have in her lifetime, God. Oh Lord, I think about my children and I think about Lord even these men, these three men that have lost their lives in the last few weeks or months rather. So I pray you'd be with these families, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; One in CPPley, Lord, the Mercy's family here, Lord, and the other one there, the Thompson family, God, just be with them, Lord, as they're experiencing something on the same lines, unexpected loss. So, Father, let your spirit comfort the hurting. I pray Lord, thank you, God, that in your mercy, you wrestle with us and you let us prevail. You change our hearts, oh God. You give us our heart's desire, Lord God. We're not worthy of it, yet you grant it to us. Jacob didn't deserve deliverance, but you gave it to him anyway, dear God. Thank you, God, for being such a merciful God. Lord, empower us, Lord, to overcome through your Holy Spirit. Grant it, Lord. I ask this in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints said, "Amen.
