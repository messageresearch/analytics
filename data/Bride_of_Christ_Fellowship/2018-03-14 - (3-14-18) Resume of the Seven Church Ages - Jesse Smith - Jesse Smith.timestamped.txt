[8:17] a little late starch here kind of rush
[8:35] in at a meeting after work and
[8:36] everything but let's start with some
[8:39] prayer here I have three prayer requests
[8:42] I'd like to share with you and then let
[8:44] me know if you have any prayer requests
[8:45] tonight
[8:47] the first one is for brother John's

[8:50] night and he said he's healing up a lot

[8:54] continued healing he said he's gonna
[8:56] come tonight too so it hopefully he'll
[8:57] be here tonight by God's grace but I
[9:00] just thought it'd be good to pray for
[9:00] our brother as he recovers and also
[9:03] gotta lead him in the next phase of his
[9:06] life with work and different things he's
[9:08] praying about so secondly Lydia has a

[39:34] I'm feeling good after those songs
[39:37] praise the Lord hallelujah thank the
[39:41] Lord let's go to Revelation chapter 3
[39:44] I'm gonna finish the church agents
[39:46] tonight I believe by the grace of Lord I
[39:48] want to preach one more message I'll be
[39:51] message number 59 tonight by God's grace
[39:53] so very thankful for that and I can feel
[39:58] complete as a pastor and I guess that's
[40:02] just as a brother maybe as a man I'd
[40:04] like to finish what I started so I look
[40:06] forward to tonight finishing this
[40:07] thought up and I trust you've been
[40:09] blessed I know there's been so many
[40:12] things as I preached this series that
[40:13] I've needed to write at that hour and
[40:16] God has made himself of course more real
[40:18] during this time to me the secrets to
[40:21] the church ages and all these things
[40:23] that have been revealed to us we're so
[40:25] thankful for them I trusted
[40:26] been a great blessing to you as well so
[40:29] I have guys can put it up there maokai
[40:31] when you're ready Revelation chapter 3
[40:33] let's go to verse 20 we'll just read the
[40:35] last few scriptures again as we did last
[40:36] Wednesday night
[40:41] then Sunday Lord willing I'll be
[40:43] preaching Sunday I think I'm going to
[40:45] preach on the last chapter of Proverbs
[40:47] I'm going to preach on to proverbs 31
[40:49] woman so I think I'm feeling led to
[40:51] preach on that by the grace of the Lord
[40:53] remember that's supposed to be a message
[40:55] of encouragement that's not supposed to
[40:56] be a message of you know making women
[40:59] feel bad or something like that it's
[41:02] actually a chapter that shows the
[41:03] potential of what a woman can achieve
[41:05] over the course of her lifetime that's
[41:07] what that chapter shows I know in times
[41:10] past you know I've talked to different
[41:11] people and I could never be a proverbs
[41:13] 31 woman or I could never do that but
[41:15] you have to look at the scope of this
[41:16] this is a woman throughout her entire
[41:18] life at one stage of her life she's
[41:20] ministering to her children she makes
[41:22] sure her children have everything they
[41:23] need a winter time right then another
[41:25] stage of her life she's out there buying
[41:27] a field planting a vineyard making money
[41:29] and having a food shipped in from other
[41:33] countries this is a woman who's mature
[41:36] this is this is the UH the the full
[41:38] fruit of a godly woman over the course
[41:41] of decades so it's something to keep in
[41:43] mind and we know they're rare to find
[41:46] the Bible says they're very rare to find
[41:47] because the Bible said her price is far
[41:48] above rubies and so I'm sure our sisters
[41:52] want to be that but I'm sure our
[41:53] brothers want to be a spiritual proverbs
[41:55] 31 woman they want to be a pleasing wife
[41:58] to Christ I know I do it's kind of odd
[42:01] to say that though you know a man wanted
[42:03] to be a wife it's hard to say that but I
[42:05] think you understand spiritually
[42:07] speaking revelation 3:20 behold I stand
[42:12] at the door and knock If any man hear my
[42:13] voice and open the door I will come in
[42:16] to him and will sup with him and he with
[42:18] me aren't you glad you've heard the
[42:19] voice aren't you glad you've opened the
[42:21] door I'm so happy I'm having supper with
[42:23] Christ tonight verse 21 to him that
[42:26] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[42:29] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[42:32] I'm set down with my father in his
[42:33] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[42:36] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[42:38] let's just bow our heads and word of
[42:39] Prayer
[42:40] you have a need on your heart just
[42:41] making known to God as we pray Heavenly
[42:44] Father Lord I'm so thankful for tonight
[42:46] for many reasons the Lord for life
[42:48] breath my being my family this church
[42:51] Lord my job the Saints were so grateful
[42:54] for all that we have most of all were
[42:56] grateful for you Lord our Lord and
[42:58] Savior Jesus Christ and father were
[43:01] grateful to come to the conclusion of
[43:02] this series Lord God it seemed like it
[43:04] would never get here at times because or
[43:06] as this my human mind I just want to
[43:08] finish what I start
[43:10] and so Lord I'm grateful for tonight I'm
[43:12] asking for grace that I could finish
[43:14] this subject Lord God as far as at least
[43:17] for now Lord perhaps the Holy Spirit
[43:19] will direct me here later on but Lord I
[43:21] know this series has been tremendous for
[43:23] me personally Lord God it so helped me
[43:26] to understand the spirit within the the
[43:28] two spirits rather within the framework
[43:30] of the church Lord and by your grace
[43:32] Lord I believe with all my heart our
[43:34] churches part of the true the true vine
[43:36] Lord God and we're overcoming the false
[43:39] vine Lord and we're recognizing the
[43:41] false spirit and withstanding the false
[43:44] spirit Lord Jesus by your grace Heavenly
[43:47] Father so Lord speak to us here tonight
[43:49] we need you Lord meet every need of
[43:51] every individual Lord our hearts are
[43:53] raised our hands are raised Oh God speak
[43:55] to every heart we need you tonight Lord
[43:57] God and we're so looking forward to your
[43:59] word and our worship afterwards we give
[44:01] you glory in Jesus Christ's name
[44:03] everybody said amen god bless she's been
[44:06] seated here praise the Lord so I started
[44:13] the church ages in 2015 I just
[44:15] introduced them and then I preached on
[44:18] Laodicea and then I took a break
[44:20] 2016-2017 I'm sorry I took a break in
[44:24] 2016 and then I picked it back up in
[44:26] 2017 and now Lord willing tonight we can
[44:29] finish it by the grace of the Lord so
[44:33] let's look at this here part 59 this is
[44:35] the resume so chapter 10 of the book
[44:37] which I finished lat couple weekends ago
[44:39] is called chapter 10 is called the
[44:41] resume of the church ages which means a
[44:43] summary like when you fill out a resume
[44:45] for your job it's a summary of what
[44:47] you've done over the course of your life
[44:48] and so brother branham you know felt led
[44:51] of course maybe with lavell you know to
[44:53] right a summary of the church ages so
[44:55] I'd like to do that tonight and just hit
[44:57] the highlights of these last 14 pages of
[45:00] the book if you have a chance to to read
[45:03] that then I'm gonna read the last three
[45:04] paragraphs Malachi let me borrow a copy
[45:06] his book I left mine in my car after
[45:08] work so I'm gonna read the last few
[45:11] paragraphs to kind of show what how the
[45:13] Prophet closes this thought now he
[45:15] begins his chapter by saying due to the
[45:18] fact that our studies have been a verse
[45:20] by verse exposition of those scriptures
[45:22] that deal with the seven ages we've not
[45:24] set forth a continuous historical
[45:26] pattern of the church as much as we
[45:28] ought to have done it is therefore our
[45:31] purpose now to take this chapter and
[45:33] beginning with the vision age trace all
[45:36] through the ages the church and her
[45:39] history has given to John by the Spirit
[45:41] of God we will not be adding any new
[45:43] material as much as correlating what we
[45:45] already have okay so there is there's
[45:48] not much new in this last chapter but so
[45:51] the purpose of this is to trace the two
[45:53] spirits from Ephesus back all the way
[45:56] down to today the time of Laodicea
[45:59] that's his purpose to kind of focus on
[46:01] those two spirits so he says before we
[46:04] even start remember there was three
[46:05] great revelations about the church ages
[46:08] that we must remember the first is that
[46:11] the church in Revelation in chapters 2
[46:13] and 3 refers to anyone who calls himself
[46:16] a Christian it includes the elect and it
[46:20] also includes the reprobate because it's
[46:22] anyone who calls himself a Christian
[46:24] whatever comes out of your mouth God's
[46:26] gonna hold you accountable for what
[46:27] comes out of your mouth right with you
[46:30] I'm a Baptist or I'm a Luther I'm a
[46:31] message believer I'm a Buddhist I'm a
[46:34] Muslim whatever comes out of your mouth
[46:36] God's gonna hold you accountable for
[46:38] that unless you repent of it because the
[46:40] Bible said Jesus said every idle word
[46:42] will be given account for so we must
[46:45] make sure the words that come out of our
[46:47] mouth are sincere we must stand up and
[46:49] say what we believe and we must stand on
[46:51] the truth of God's Word now the second
[46:54] part was that the last two vines would
[46:55] grow side by side until the harvest you
[46:58] would never get rid of all the tares and
[47:01] then thank God the tares could never get
[47:03] rid of all the weak - amen Rome tried to
[47:05] squash her out and
[47:07] her out in the thyroid here in church
[47:08] age but she couldn't do it because God
[47:10] is always gonna have a witness amen and
[47:13] thirdly the Holy Spirit could and would
[47:16] fall upon both vines that's another
[47:18] truth these three truths are the three
[47:21] major revelations of the church ages we
[47:24] have to understand that that they flow
[47:25] all the way through the church's elect
[47:29] and reprobate it's filled with both and
[47:31] then you have both vines growing side by
[47:34] side and the Holy Spirit will fall on
[47:36] both because the church ages are like a
[47:38] field and in a field you have wheat and
[47:40] you have tears amen this might be a
[47:44] short sermon tonight we'll see Ephesus
[47:47] now Ephesus the Prophet gives a few
[47:49] things to note
[47:51] he says the birth of the church was at
[47:54] Pentecost that was the birth of it and
[47:57] the church shortly thereafter became a
[48:01] fallen woman so a few years after
[48:03] Pentecost the church became a fallen
[48:06] woman and the Prophet tells us why he
[48:10] says just like Eve he said just like
[48:12] Satan got to Eve right before Adam and
[48:15] Eve could come together and multiply so
[48:19] did Satan get to the true church before
[48:21] the rapture that's what the Prophet says
[48:23] before the future home so the same thing
[48:26] happened the church fell and the church
[48:29] as a whole like we said there's
[48:30] reprobates and many of them left their
[48:32] first love the church is a whole fell
[48:34] just like Eve fell at the beginning and
[48:37] death entered into the church and
[48:40] brother Branham says this is can be
[48:42] proved because Jesus later in the Church
[48:45] ages offers them to partake of the Tree
[48:48] of Life hey Holly literally I thought
[48:51] that was beautiful
[48:52] amen death had already entered because
[48:55] Jesus was offering the Tree of Life to
[48:58] the overcomer
[48:58] so it shows the churches started dying
[49:01] they left their first love they had left
[49:04] their their focus on the Word of God and
[49:08] they let something else enter in to
[49:11] their lives the Prophet said this this
[49:14] was the age of leaving the first love
[49:16] the church left their first love and now
[49:20] the Prophet said the message of course
[49:23] was to them but also to the entire Age
[49:25] the entire Age had left their first love
[49:28] and then the Prophet tells us here they
[49:31] had added things like titles like
[49:34] bishops and they started doing the deeds
[49:37] of the Nicolaitans and here he says the
[49:40] tears always flourish more in a field
[49:43] unless they're uprooted but we know
[49:45] Jesus told the angel don't uproot the
[49:47] tares while the wheat grows with it so
[49:50] the tares flourish more the tares grew
[49:53] more than the true church
[49:54] yeah the deeds of the Nicolaitans
[49:56] entered a member deeds were not anything
[50:01] written in concrete they weren't you
[50:03] know doctrines of the church they're
[50:05] just little habits the church got into
[50:07] they were sinful habits that people
[50:09] started doing like we say like we gave
[50:12] some examples at the beginning like
[50:13] baptizing babies you know sprinkling
[50:16] babies baptize them father said well I
[50:18] should say baptism father suddenly goes
[50:20] but just doing other little things like
[50:21] that letting women have a ruling in the
[50:24] church and and all kinds of things and
[50:26] just letting little sins go it's okay to
[50:28] have this bad habit and it's okay to let
[50:31] this sin go they started compromising on
[50:34] the word and then they started giving
[50:36] preachers titles like Bishop and and
[50:39] presbyter and all these different titles
[50:41] they gave them and they started leaving
[50:44] the initial truth of the word of God and
[50:48] he said it's like when a married couple
[50:50] the first first few months of marriage
[50:53] are just fine and dandy but you give it
[50:55] a little time give it a few years and
[50:57] then they lose their first love in their
[51:01] wedded life so that's what happened to
[51:03] the church and the Prophet said that
[51:06] Jesus bought all the humanity on the
[51:08] cross he said and so all the church
[51:11] belongs to him and so everyone is
[51:14] required to obey the word of Jesus he's
[51:17] the husband he's the one who bought the
[51:19] entire church so the Prophet summarizes
[51:22] it like that so now we'll just start
[51:24] summarizing the sins I'm gonna go down
[51:26] like this up and around
[51:27] so the first church age their deeds were
[51:30] wrong they started let it they started
[51:32] cooling off towards God
[51:34] they cared more about what the world
[51:37] thought about them than what God thought
[51:39] about them that's right
[51:41] now for some urn of the Prophet shortens
[51:45] this as well and he says what happened
[51:47] in Samara now you have of a full church
[51:50] first there was just deeds and the and
[51:52] the the reprobate we're hanging out
[51:54] amongst the sinner or I'm sorry that the
[51:56] elect reprobate among the elect but then
[51:58] in this church age they started
[52:00] separating themselves and they started
[52:02] having their own churches and Jesus says
[52:04] now they're the synagogue of Satan
[52:06] they've at this point in the submergence
[52:08] earch age they've already separated
[52:10] themselves they have their own churches
[52:11] and now they're the synagogue of Satan
[52:14] and now they start persecuting the true
[52:18] vine in the second church age and the
[52:21] Prophet said this is the stage where we
[52:22] start seeing the children of the
[52:24] bondwoman persecuting or making fun of
[52:27] the children of the free woman
[52:30] so like Ishmael persecuting Isaac during
[52:33] this time you had the false Church now
[52:36] persecuting the true Church yet saying
[52:38] were the true seed were the true people
[52:40] of God but it wasn't true and Jesus let
[52:44] many of them die because we're getting
[52:45] towards the Ox age the Ox anointing
[52:48] jesus said I understand I know your
[52:50] sufferings I could I could keep you from
[52:53] being a martyr but he allowed them to be
[52:55] martyrs because Jesus knew that the
[52:57] bride must be faithful unto death and
[53:00] then we must love Jesus more and more
[53:03] amen no matter the trials we must fall
[53:05] in love with Jesus more and more
[53:07] hallelujah now the Prophet said Jesus
[53:11] will hold these people in the
[53:12] synagogue's of Satan he'll hold them
[53:14] accountable because they're saying
[53:16] they're Christians they they say we're
[53:18] the Church of Christ and but jesus said
[53:20] they're liars they baptize they go
[53:22] through ceremonies they sing songs they
[53:25] have rituals they do all these things
[53:26] but they're still not of God when they
[53:28] have the wrong spirit behind them he
[53:30] said this is just like Balaam because
[53:32] Balaam knew the proper approach to God
[53:35] he sacrificed 7 clean bullocks that was
[53:38] part of the approach to God under the
[53:41] Feast of Israel the seventh feast
[53:44] I believe the feast of atonement David
[53:46] toment one of the sacrifices was seven
[53:48] feasts of Israel I'm sorry seven clean
[53:50] bullocks and so Balaam picked that up
[53:53] and Balaam copied that worship and he
[53:56] brought seven clean bullocks as part of
[53:59] his worship he copied the worship of God
[54:02] that's right but yet Balaam still chose
[54:06] his own way the Prophet said he wanted
[54:09] his own way and so God gave him his own
[54:12] way
[54:12] God gave Balaam his heart's desire and
[54:15] how me know God's gonna give you your
[54:16] heart's desire - it all depends though
[54:19] what's your heart's desire hey man and
[54:21] your choices you out make in your life
[54:23] will show what your heart desire is if
[54:26] you choose to run after money or choose
[54:28] to run after relationships and put that
[54:30] above God and break god's word or if you
[54:33] choose to walk in full obedience to the
[54:36] word of the Lord amen and that's why
[54:38] Balaam went to hell because God offered
[54:40] him and showed him the perfect will of
[54:42] God
[54:42] but he turned on the perfect will of God
[54:44] and walked in the permissive will of God
[54:46] for the love of money and that's why God
[54:50] sent him to hell because he chose with
[54:53] his harsh desire he chose money
[54:55] popularity and fame over the perfect
[54:58] will of God now the Prophet said the
[55:01] churches of today all represent Balaam
[55:04] these churches these false churches that
[55:07] are synagogue of Satan he said gave
[55:09] examples they'll take the permissive
[55:11] will of God like women preachers he said
[55:13] organizations denominations false
[55:16] doctrines they all represent Balaam
[55:19] today they all claim God spoke to them
[55:22] which Balaam could claim that - God
[55:23] spoke to Balaam
[55:25] he said but and they all have
[55:27] manifestations of the Holy Spirit like
[55:29] Balaam had but they left the perfect
[55:32] will of God for the permissive will of
[55:34] God so see when it all boils down to it
[55:37] what matters most is that we do the will
[55:39] of God
[55:40] how many can say amen to that glory now
[55:43] we see their hatred increases they're
[55:46] the synagogue of Satan that's about
[55:47] where I left off on many of my notes
[55:49] because I just ran out of time now a
[55:52] Pergamos in Pergamos the main thing that
[55:55] Satan was doing was bringing the
[55:57] doctrine of Balaam okay we mentioned
[56:00] that earlier but see how Satan works he
[56:02] from just deeds that were written down
[56:03] now they have their separate churches
[56:05] persecuting the true church and now
[56:07] they've got the doctrine of balaam which
[56:09] happened in the third church age which
[56:11] deals with Constantine which of course
[56:13] this is right around the time of the the
[56:15] Council of Nicaea which we'll talk about
[56:16] here in just a moment
[56:19] now the Prophet said the doctrine of the
[56:21] Nicolaitans was also the doctrine of
[56:24] Balaam and this is the a when the
[56:27] preachers started making themselves
[56:29] higher than the laity this is the age
[56:32] where they started doing that he said
[56:35] this involved evolved in today what we
[56:37] have a modern-day priesthood and this
[56:42] doctrine forbid the lady from their
[56:44] spiritual rights so it puts all the
[56:47] holiness and the priests it puts all the
[56:50] power and all the authority in the
[56:52] priests and the people have no holiness
[56:53] they have no anointing they have no
[56:55] power they have no authority so that's
[56:58] what Satan wants to do Satan wants to
[56:59] put all authority in the person behind
[57:01] the pulpit all power in them and he
[57:04] wants the church to feel like they have
[57:06] none but as we heard on Sunday morning
[57:09] we do have power and authority
[57:11] every bride member has power Authority
[57:13] the scripture is talking about me it's
[57:16] prophetic of me it's talking about you
[57:18] is it not they've had it's me the
[57:20] scripture is talking about you we are
[57:23] all supposed to fulfill the scripture
[57:24] we're all supposed to have the
[57:26] leadership of the Holy Spirit it's
[57:28] exactly right that's what I believe our
[57:32] church does that I believe our church by
[57:34] the grace of God I believe our church
[57:36] preaches that everyone should have the
[57:38] power of God in their life can you say
[57:40] amen to that
[57:40] I believe our church preaches that you
[57:44] shouldn't come just expecting the
[57:45] preacher to have anointing but you
[57:47] should come with your anointing to I
[57:50] believe that our church preaches that
[57:52] every person should have a gift of the
[57:54] Holy Spirit and a ministry I believe our
[57:57] church preaches that and I and I believe
[57:59] I do as master I believe I do everything
[58:02] I can do to try to encourage the people
[58:03] to do that and if not let me know praise
[58:06] the Lord I invite you to come early to
[58:07] pray I might to a prayer service we try
[58:10] do everything we possibly can do to let
[58:12] every person have a part of the Holy
[58:14] Ghost ministry
[58:17] but in this age that was the key
[58:19] deception to make the priests hire make
[58:23] them have all the rights all the
[58:24] authority or the power it gave more
[58:28] rights to the clergy than the land
[58:31] t-then buh-bam said the antichrist
[58:33] spirit tried to get the local leaders to
[58:35] have more responsibility than just their
[58:38] local church now we don't have anything
[58:39] like that going on I don't have any
[58:41] influence over any other churches other
[58:43] than this one right here but you know
[58:45] churches that do right I know there's a
[58:47] lot of people in the message they've got
[58:49] they rally around one man and so what
[58:52] they'll have is satellite churches
[58:53] especially with the internet today right
[58:55] now one man and he's got you know
[58:57] through 30 churches that are satellite
[59:00] churches that's wrong it shouldn't be
[59:02] like that the Bible said ordain elders
[59:04] in every city praise the Lord
[59:07] there should be a local elder a local
[59:09] pastor in every church even if they are
[59:12] in the same city they should have their
[59:14] own pastor one pastor should not rule
[59:17] over numerous congregations now of
[59:19] course can a pastor help out a church
[59:21] you know for a little bit you know until
[59:23] they get a pastor yes but the plan
[59:25] should be that the pastor just helps
[59:27] them out for a while until God anoints
[59:30] somebody who can who can be the ox of
[59:32] the team right but this is the age when
[59:35] they started putting men having more
[59:37] than just local responsibilities
[59:39] I've had people reach out to me lately
[59:41] can you give me money to do this than
[59:43] that and they're from other church and I
[59:45] say no I'm sorry I don't know you first
[59:47] of all I don't know you
[59:48] and I said my responsibility is to help
[59:50] the sheep that God gave me you have to
[59:53] say that humbly I want to help them but
[59:54] I don't know what they're gonna do I
[59:56] don't know I never from overseas I don't
[59:58] know what they're gonna do but that's
[59:59] what God that's what that person needs
[1:00:01] to do they need to go to their pastor or
[1:00:02] get a pastor and and and work with the
[1:00:05] pastor support the pastor proving the
[1:00:07] past year not a goat prove to the pastor
[1:00:10] you're a sheep and how do you do that by
[1:00:12] obeying everywhere that's in the Bible
[1:00:14] not every order of the pastor but every
[1:00:17] thing the pastor says that's in the
[1:00:19] Bible because again I don't have any
[1:00:21] real authority over you other than just
[1:00:23] to preach God's Word to you that's the
[1:00:26] only authority I have over you I don't
[1:00:28] tell you how to run your life
[1:00:29] I don't tell you I give you a
[1:00:30] suggestions on higher in my life and you
[1:00:32] can follow it if you want you can follow
[1:00:34] my example if you want but I don't lord
[1:00:36] over you I don't tell you what to do I
[1:00:38] don't tell you all these things like
[1:00:40] that
[1:00:40] that's what Gentiles do that's what
[1:00:42] that's what the Antichrist spirit does
[1:00:44] but the true Holy Spirit will give us
[1:00:47] influence over the local church to try
[1:00:50] to point them to Jesus Christ the word
[1:00:52] amen hallelujah
[1:00:54] now he said the doctrine of balaam the
[1:00:57] Prophet says this he said the doctrine
[1:01:01] of balaam literally was when Constantine
[1:01:04] around this point right here around 325
[1:01:07] AD
[1:01:07] so right after the beginning of the
[1:01:09] church age through here's 312 so right
[1:01:11] after that right in here
[1:01:12] Constantine gathered all the Christians
[1:01:15] together that would come now not the
[1:01:16] true ones they didn't go to the meeting
[1:01:17] brother Branham said and of course
[1:01:20] history would say that too he tried to
[1:01:21] gather them all together and unite
[1:01:23] church and state that's exactly what
[1:01:25] Balaam did Balaam was the religion and
[1:01:27] then Balak was the state and he United
[1:01:30] them at bale peor and the Prophet said
[1:01:32] that's exactly what happened when
[1:01:34] Constantine United church and state did
[1:01:36] he not he did and then he let the the
[1:01:39] Christian churches had after that
[1:01:41] council of nicaea he let them have the
[1:01:44] buildings of the pagan gods and they
[1:01:46] just they kept the statues but they
[1:01:48] swapped out the names so went from
[1:01:49] Jupiter to Paul right right from Venus
[1:01:53] to Jesus they just they have the same
[1:01:55] Babylonian religion just with Christian
[1:01:58] names and that was called the doctrine
[1:02:01] of balaam they United the church and
[1:02:03] state and now their worship if you go to
[1:02:05] a Catholic service when was last time
[1:02:06] you went to one it's been a while for me
[1:02:08] but I went to Catholic wedding recently
[1:02:09] and their whole service is based upon
[1:02:12] creed dogma and tradition now we've got
[1:02:18] to make sure our services don't turn
[1:02:19] into Creed doctrine and religion in
[1:02:22] other words we've got to come here
[1:02:23] looking for the Living God we got to say
[1:02:25] God speak to brother Jesse or speak to
[1:02:27] brother Darrell as brother Brooks come
[1:02:29] speak to brother Brooks speak to us that
[1:02:32] our lives can be changed and we can
[1:02:34] realize that you're right amongst us
[1:02:35] amen whether it's through healing or
[1:02:38] forgiveness or repentance or salvation
[1:02:40] or the baptism of the Holy Ghost let us
[1:02:42] feel your power and let us obey your
[1:02:44] spirit amen
[1:02:46] we can't let our churches turn it our
[1:02:49] church sir into Creed's and dogmas in
[1:02:50] rituals we must call upon God for the
[1:02:54] supernatural power of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:56] it's exactly right now brother Branham
[1:02:59] said the biggest the greatest danger who
[1:03:01] knows what the greatest danger of the
[1:03:03] doctrine of balaam is anybody no program
[1:03:06] said the greatest danger of this
[1:03:07] doctrine he says is to for the clergy or
[1:03:11] the preachers to tie the people to
[1:03:14] themselves instead of the Christ and
[1:03:18] that's why I've always said like this
[1:03:20] I've always said if you feel led to
[1:03:22] leave this church follow that leading
[1:03:24] and leave this church I'm not gonna bind
[1:03:26] you here to myself but I also have to
[1:03:29] say on the other hand if the Holy Spirit
[1:03:31] tells you to stay here you better stay
[1:03:33] here right is that right but but the
[1:03:36] clergy the the the were the worst
[1:03:38] deception of that was they trying to get
[1:03:41] the people to be fearful oh if you don't
[1:03:43] practice this sprinkling if you don't
[1:03:45] teach your children the catechism
[1:03:46] they're going to be lost they try to
[1:03:48] keep them in the church by fear rather
[1:03:51] than by faith and I want I want our
[1:03:54] church and all true churches should keep
[1:03:57] the people there by faith and not fear
[1:04:00] amen that means God faith is a
[1:04:02] revelation so God has revealed to you
[1:04:05] this is where your home church is this
[1:04:07] is where you feed like a sheep on the
[1:04:09] word of God this is where you grow in
[1:04:11] Christ amen but like I said before if
[1:04:16] God takes me out of the pulpit and and
[1:04:17] pulls me away from me in a pastor you
[1:04:20] would be just as strong here and pray
[1:04:22] until God sends another pastor because
[1:04:24] you're not tied to me you're tied to
[1:04:26] Christ amen
[1:04:28] never understand that by God's grace now
[1:04:30] of course I hope you love me as your
[1:04:31] pastor I hope you appreciate me as your
[1:04:33] pastor I appreciate you as the church
[1:04:34] but we're not tied together like that
[1:04:38] like denominationalism in other words
[1:04:40] you can stand if I'm not here I can
[1:04:43] stand if you're not here because we're
[1:04:44] standing for Christ amen but that's the
[1:04:48] danger of the doctrine of balaam they've
[1:04:50] got to bind themselves to the state they
[1:04:52] got to bind themselves to the preacher
[1:04:53] the preachers got to keep the people
[1:04:55] there with fear
[1:04:56] or if you leave the satan will get after
[1:04:58] you oh my it all depends on the
[1:05:03] leadership of the Holy Spirit amen
[1:05:04] we must be led by the Holy Spirit now he
[1:05:10] said this also was they they made the
[1:05:13] leadership of the church human
[1:05:15] leadership rather than spiritual
[1:05:17] leadership of the Holy Spirit they
[1:05:20] wanted the human leaders rather than
[1:05:22] Holy Ghost leaders and he said what they
[1:05:25] did is they wrapped up for the Roman
[1:05:27] Church wrapped up I already said it
[1:05:29] before I'll say it again they wrapped up
[1:05:31] Babylonian worship and gave it a
[1:05:33] Christian title so kind of like a wolf
[1:05:35] in sheep's clothing right
[1:05:36] that really behind all Roman Catholicism
[1:05:38] is Babylon confusion of the word they
[1:05:41] don't really believe the word and that's
[1:05:43] wrapped up in this sheep's type of
[1:05:46] clothing it's hid behind a Christian
[1:05:48] mask we'd say and the Prophet says this
[1:05:52] I haven't preached this yet so this is
[1:05:53] not review the Prophet said if the
[1:05:55] rapture took place today no one in the
[1:05:59] denominations today would have any
[1:06:01] excuse for missing the rapture he said
[1:06:05] and that's because they all have a human
[1:06:08] conscience they all at some point should
[1:06:11] have been able to discern is this the
[1:06:12] Bible or is this not the Bible right he
[1:06:16] said they're mean he said there will be
[1:06:18] no appeals in the core of God's judgment
[1:06:22] because they're in the wrong ranks oh my
[1:06:25] aren't you glad to be in the ranks of
[1:06:26] the message of the hour I'm so glad I'm
[1:06:29] not in the Presbyterian ranks like I
[1:06:31] used to be or the the Baptist race or
[1:06:33] the Pentecostal ranks I'm so glad to be
[1:06:35] in your ranks amen the race of the bride
[1:06:38] because there'll be no excuse for the
[1:06:40] rapture comes member he that's holy is
[1:06:43] holy still he that's righteous the
[1:06:46] foolish virgin is righteous still and he
[1:06:49] that's unholy is unholy still amen and I
[1:06:52] forget the other one what's the other
[1:06:53] one - unrighteous thing is unrighteous
[1:06:56] unholy unrighteous and holy and
[1:06:58] righteous I believe from Revelation
[1:07:01] chapter 22 when the rapture comes
[1:07:03] there's no excuse for whatever rank
[1:07:05] you're in now Church does that give you
[1:07:07] hope - that no matter what people
[1:07:10] around me decide I'm gonna stay in God's
[1:07:12] church amen
[1:07:14] I'm going to stay in the true Church of
[1:07:16] God I'm gonna stay in the right ranks
[1:07:18] the Satan can't offer me anything that
[1:07:21] would cause me to leave these ranks amen
[1:07:23] because we're in the ranks of the
[1:07:25] prophetic hour of the day amen glory
[1:07:29] there's no excuses everybody has a
[1:07:32] discernment everybody should be able to
[1:07:33] say well well I know there's one book
[1:07:35] that God's going to judge us by
[1:07:36] everybody knows God's gonna judge the
[1:07:38] world by this Bible everybody knows that
[1:07:40] that's why they're the most popular sell
[1:07:42] book every year it's just human it's
[1:07:45] just human conscience God places that
[1:07:48] understanding in the human conscious
[1:07:50] remember we said we saw that Romans 1
[1:07:52] recently everything that's we know known
[1:07:55] about God or like what is known about
[1:07:56] God is already revealed in every human
[1:07:58] being it's in your mind you see in your
[1:08:00] body you look at your mind you look at
[1:08:02] your body use do you think about your
[1:08:04] mind everybody knows that there's a
[1:08:06] creator they can't deny it and then only
[1:08:08] a fool is an atheist and says there is
[1:08:11] no creator that's right now program says
[1:08:16] let me limit let me say it again we are
[1:08:18] not against this the people were against
[1:08:20] the system that's why I'm friends with
[1:08:23] many people that go to domination on
[1:08:24] church I'm so friendly with them when
[1:08:27] they asked me about different things
[1:08:28] about women preachers or makeup I tell
[1:08:30] them they still thankfully I've only
[1:08:33] lost a couple of friends because of
[1:08:34] makeup I lost a few friends because that
[1:08:36] video makeup in the Bible I haven't lost
[1:08:39] too many other friends other than that
[1:08:41] the ones that left me come back to me
[1:08:43] and we're my friends again
[1:08:44] so haven't lost too many other than a
[1:08:47] few so it must must not be the hour yet
[1:08:49] you know where they have to turn
[1:08:50] remember that's a term we saw that last
[1:08:52] week they have to turn from any vestige
[1:08:54] of truth and then if they're persecute
[1:08:56] the true bride so we know it's probably
[1:08:58] not that our yet we're not against the
[1:09:01] people were for the people were against
[1:09:03] the system now brother Adam says because
[1:09:07] of all this marrying church and state
[1:09:09] this set the stage for the Dark Ages
[1:09:12] this thousand year period here the Dark
[1:09:15] Ages I already went over this here I
[1:09:17] just put little reminders up there for
[1:09:19] myself now we're ready for the Dark Ages
[1:09:22] which is thyroid pterosaur
[1:09:24] getting down to the end here now the
[1:09:28] Dark Ages was thousand years of darkness
[1:09:33] spiritual darkness and brother branham
[1:09:35] said this is the depths of Satan so you
[1:09:38] could not get any deeper in Satan's
[1:09:42] Antichrist spirit than to have the
[1:09:45] Jezebel religion right I'm sorry we're
[1:09:48] not there yet
[1:09:48] that's that's what happens this this
[1:09:49] period yeah this is what happened this
[1:09:50] period this is as deep as you can go to
[1:09:53] have Jezebel religion you already had
[1:09:55] the deeds you had the little sinful
[1:09:57] things that weren't bathrooms yet then
[1:09:59] you made them doctrines here and now
[1:10:01] you've got Jezebel religion which is the
[1:10:05] false church with full complete power
[1:10:08] that's Jezebel religion because this is
[1:10:11] the age when Rome had most of their
[1:10:15] martyrs of the 68 million member of 68
[1:10:17] million brother man talked about that
[1:10:19] six to eight million from foxes Book of
[1:10:20] Martyrs this is the age where we had the
[1:10:24] Crusades this is the age where you had
[1:10:27] the other Inquisition Inquisition that's
[1:10:31] where he had that as well millions and
[1:10:33] millions and millions of Christians died
[1:10:35] this was the depths of Satan that were
[1:10:38] warned about now he says this with money
[1:10:44] political power and religious influence
[1:10:47] the only place left to go was Jezebel
[1:10:50] religion so this teaches us that the
[1:10:53] worst religion possible is Jezebel
[1:10:56] religion that's the worst religion
[1:10:57] possible she was a murderer and so was
[1:11:01] the Roman Catholic Church she controlled
[1:11:04] Bert I'm sorry Rome controlled both
[1:11:07] church and state just like Jezebel did
[1:11:10] and then the Prophet tells us these
[1:11:13] three manifestations are on the same
[1:11:15] antichrist sphere just in a different
[1:11:17] stage so this is how Satan will increase
[1:11:22] in false churches he'll start out with
[1:11:25] deeds and they'll move two doctrines and
[1:11:27] Nicolaitans the deeds that become
[1:11:29] doctrines and then doctrines have become
[1:11:32] like Balaam where you compromise right
[1:11:35] with the world
[1:11:36] you come out from the
[1:11:37] Church compromised of the world and then
[1:11:39] you become a part of the false church
[1:11:41] system which in our day would be the
[1:11:43] Roman Catholic Church and her daughter's
[1:11:46] Church we're not our church is never
[1:11:49] gonna go join the Catholic Church right
[1:11:51] and our church is never gonna say oh
[1:11:54] let's leave the message and let's go
[1:11:55] join with the Baptist's you know we're
[1:11:57] never going to do that but what do we
[1:11:58] need to worry about church right here
[1:12:00] deeds we will never we will never write
[1:12:03] bylaws and give you like bylaws that
[1:12:06] break the Word of God we have to have
[1:12:07] bylaws but we're never going to write
[1:12:08] bylaws that break the Word of God right
[1:12:11] we're not going to do that but what
[1:12:13] happens as you've seen it in message
[1:12:15] churches right we see it where they have
[1:12:16] just traditions that are not written
[1:12:18] down there just deeds and the deeds
[1:12:22] produce sin in the church and it creates
[1:12:25] a cancer in the church right because
[1:12:28] it's like leaven and that leaven is
[1:12:31] going to keep multiplying unless it's
[1:12:32] cleaned out right
[1:12:35] and so you see churches go through good
[1:12:37] times where the leavens all cleaned out
[1:12:38] and they go through bad times when sin
[1:12:41] is left sitting in people's lives so now
[1:12:45] now the preachers have to preach against
[1:12:47] that and then the preacher and the
[1:12:49] people have to go to that individual
[1:12:51] let's say it's this individual right
[1:12:52] here there's no but let's say the
[1:12:54] individual sits at this chair which
[1:12:56] nobody does the either the pastor has to
[1:12:59] go to this individual or somebody the
[1:13:01] church has to go to this individual and
[1:13:03] talk to them in order to get the leaven
[1:13:05] out because if we don't get the leaven
[1:13:07] out it's going to leaven the whole
[1:13:09] entire church it's gonna cause unbelief
[1:13:12] that spirit will hinder you while we're
[1:13:15] trying to raise our faith that spirit
[1:13:17] will try to hinder you it's led leaven
[1:13:20] that leavens the whole lump is that
[1:13:23] right like we recently we've seen in the
[1:13:25] years past
[1:13:26] God has taken out sinners out of the
[1:13:28] church that didn't believe the Word of
[1:13:29] God amen
[1:13:31] right I've had asked a couple people not
[1:13:34] to come back you might not know about
[1:13:37] that but I've had told people until you
[1:13:39] repent brother Brooks was there when I
[1:13:40] told one person that is not allowed to
[1:13:42] come to our church anymore I said until
[1:13:44] you repent of this you're not allowed to
[1:13:46] come back and so there was other things
[1:13:49] exceda in exchange
[1:13:51] but I told that person you're and
[1:13:53] they've called me numerous times but I
[1:13:55] told him I said until you repent you're
[1:13:56] I'm not I'm not letting you come back I
[1:13:59] cannot let leaven sit in here and think
[1:14:02] oh it's just it's not going to hurt
[1:14:04] anybody
[1:14:04] eventually we'll get rid of it I've got
[1:14:08] to get rid of it right now and if you
[1:14:11] know somebody who's got leaven in their
[1:14:12] life whether fornication greed
[1:14:14] unconfessed sin if you know and I don't
[1:14:17] know you've got to go to them or you've
[1:14:19] got to let me know about it because
[1:14:21] that's what's gonna happen our churches
[1:14:23] you have to worry about this I'm not
[1:14:25] going to say let's go up let's go down
[1:14:27] here to the Southern Baptist Convention
[1:14:28] let's have some fellowship with a
[1:14:30] Southern Baptist I never going to invite
[1:14:32] you to do that
[1:14:33] that's what Balaam did he said let's go
[1:14:36] join up with bale PR and they fornicated
[1:14:39] in 24,000 I I'm never going to say oh
[1:14:41] let's go join the Roman Catholic Church
[1:14:43] it's never going to happen but what
[1:14:46] could happen here is that if I'm not
[1:14:48] careful you're not careful we'll start
[1:14:51] doing things that a little bit sinful
[1:14:52] and if we don't repent of them it'll
[1:14:54] start growing and that will start
[1:14:57] hurting the church right your prayer
[1:15:00] life will be hurting your Bible reading
[1:15:02] we're burning your church attendance
[1:15:03] will hurt your giving work it'll just
[1:15:05] start somehow it'll start affecting your
[1:15:07] spiritual life you won't have patience
[1:15:09] with your brother or sister anymore
[1:15:10] right you know some of those fruits
[1:15:13] remember brother may have said what is
[1:15:15] the thing that Antichrist spirit eats
[1:15:16] off first the fruit of the Spirit so
[1:15:19] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:15:21] kindness goodness faithfulness all those
[1:15:23] fruits you start seeing little joy leave
[1:15:24] your life you start seeing little
[1:15:27] gentleness leave your life what's
[1:15:28] happening some deed came into the church
[1:15:31] we've got to cut out the deeds amen all
[1:15:33] of our deeds must just be Christian
[1:15:35] needs Amen that's right Church this is
[1:15:39] what I've got to watch out for this is
[1:15:41] what you've got to watch out for
[1:15:42] we'll never get into this you know we'll
[1:15:45] never do that but it's this we've got to
[1:15:46] make sure we keep the little sins
[1:15:48] remember it's the little foxes that
[1:15:50] spoil the vine and that was written a
[1:15:52] song a song it's the love book amen
[1:15:55] the love book the love letter the love
[1:15:57] letter says you must keep little sins
[1:16:00] out of our lives roast 11 the whole of
[1:16:02] Amen Church
[1:16:05] so that's that Jezebel religion on it I
[1:16:07] wasn't planning and say all that but
[1:16:08] that was good praise the Lord I like
[1:16:11] that and that's that's what we've got to
[1:16:15] watch out for these deeds see wheat and
[1:16:17] that's why we preach it over and over
[1:16:18] again we've got to keep Christ as our
[1:16:20] first love we got to keep Christ as our
[1:16:23] first up we got to make come into the
[1:16:25] house of God our most important thing as
[1:16:27] I preached recently though more wise you
[1:16:29] get in Christ the more preeminence
[1:16:31] you'll give Jesus the more with the more
[1:16:34] of your time you want to give to Christ
[1:16:36] because the wise redeem the time they
[1:16:39] take back the time and they invest their
[1:16:41] time and things of God amen so that's
[1:16:46] what we've got to do in this hour now
[1:16:48] let's go to Sardis let's skip skip on
[1:16:50] here by the grace of Lord what kind of
[1:16:53] set a timer here but let me just set
[1:16:54] timer I'll try to it I was telling my
[1:16:56] wife first on somebody else oh brother
[1:16:58] John I said I'll try to be done by 8:45
[1:17:00] I will give us you know some time to
[1:17:03] sing and then worship but I want to go
[1:17:05] too late Sardis Sardis now finally thank
[1:17:14] God can you imagine
[1:17:15] finally after a thousand years people
[1:17:16] start protesting the Roman Catholic
[1:17:18] Church residence on the church age book
[1:17:20] finally after a thousand years people
[1:17:22] start saying ma this church is not
[1:17:24] exactly right now the true vine was
[1:17:26] always out right the true vine was
[1:17:28] always out but it kept shrinking
[1:17:29] shrieking shrieking shrieking but
[1:17:30] finally in the Sardis age people started
[1:17:33] thinking my must not I don't think it's
[1:17:35] right to steal and kill like that I
[1:17:36] don't think it's right to do indulgences
[1:17:37] you know I think it's right to you know
[1:17:39] pay the priest you can kill somebody I
[1:17:41] don't think that's right they finally
[1:17:43] because this was the age of restoration
[1:17:45] I'll say like this this was the age of
[1:17:47] springtime brother branham caused it
[1:17:49] they were in the winter in the Dark Ages
[1:17:52] and now we're starting to see signs of
[1:17:54] spring don't you wish we saw more signs
[1:17:55] of spring we'll see last time signs the
[1:17:58] winter it's a good type for this oh I
[1:18:01] thought spring was coming Sardis is the
[1:18:04] springtime oh it started to get us
[1:18:07] that's so cold in the mornings you know
[1:18:08] I can get out and walk around a little
[1:18:10] bit and go for a walk now right now but
[1:18:13] that's what the Reformation was right
[1:18:16] have said Reformation began with
[1:18:18] Luther he said men started to begin
[1:18:23] protesting the wickedness of the Roman
[1:18:25] Catholic Church after Martin Luther
[1:18:27] received and preached the revelation of
[1:18:29] I'm justified by faith
[1:18:31] I'm not justified by my works amen
[1:18:35] I'm justified because I believe that
[1:18:37] Jesus Christ is the son of God I'm
[1:18:40] justified amen I'm righteous and now
[1:18:43] that I'm righteous what can I do that's
[1:18:45] good now right that's what when you get
[1:18:47] safe once you're saved you want to do
[1:18:49] good works but the other side is I'm
[1:18:51] just doing good works to try to be
[1:18:53] justified the other the right side is
[1:18:55] I'm saying now Lauren what can I do for
[1:18:57] you that's right that's that's the right
[1:18:59] approach brother Branham said that their
[1:19:03] churches broke from the false vine like
[1:19:06] Luther but eventually after Luther died
[1:19:09] the next generation they all went back
[1:19:11] to the mother
[1:19:13] and that's actually historical because
[1:19:16] history says they all got state
[1:19:18] financial support the church is needed
[1:19:21] to keep their churches going so they
[1:19:23] needed money from the government so even
[1:19:26] and that's what the best what Jesus said
[1:19:27] Jesus said they had a name that they
[1:19:30] live but were dead remember that that's
[1:19:33] what this church age is all about let me
[1:19:35] skip forward they have names but they're
[1:19:37] dead now Luther wasn't dead Church he
[1:19:41] was alive amen
[1:19:42] many of those men were alive but it was
[1:19:45] the generation after that that
[1:19:47] denominated again right brother Brahim
[1:19:50] said and I got to make a correction
[1:19:52] later brother Bramson Luther had the
[1:19:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost when I
[1:19:55] preached I said Luther didn't have the
[1:19:56] baptism Holy Ghost because of other
[1:19:58] quotes I kind of got some quotes mixed
[1:20:00] up so if I was wrong forgive me I still
[1:20:02] don't actually don't know the answer to
[1:20:03] that I I can't prove it you know what I
[1:20:06] mean I can't prove it because earlier in
[1:20:09] the Sardis Age I preached that you know
[1:20:10] they only had justification they didn't
[1:20:12] have Saint fication bats as Holy Ghost I
[1:20:13] preached that I remember Adam and Beau
[1:20:14] we're here and I appreciate I remember
[1:20:16] they were here but anyways I'm just
[1:20:18] letting you know I could be wrong on
[1:20:19] that because at the end of this chapter
[1:20:20] brother Branham says that Luther Wesley
[1:20:23] and Azusa all had the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:20:25] the people who were true to God which it
[1:20:30] could be I could be wrong like I said
[1:20:32] but I was just basing it off other
[1:20:34] quotes so you have quotes on both sides
[1:20:35] so I honestly don't know the answer at
[1:20:37] this point right now because remember
[1:20:40] Luther hated Jews and I don't see that I
[1:20:42] have a hard time or he didn't hate Jews
[1:20:44] but he said the Jews were the enemies to
[1:20:45] Christians and it actually caused some
[1:20:47] Jews to be persecuted so I don't see how
[1:20:50] somebody with the baptism holy ghost
[1:20:51] could say that I just don't know I don't
[1:20:53] know how that's possible so I'm just
[1:20:55] saying I don't know
[1:20:56] so could luther be born again he could
[1:20:58] be I don't know I just don't know how
[1:21:00] you could be born again and not like
[1:21:02] God's people the Jews I don't know I'm I
[1:21:06] don't know that's just I'm just saying I
[1:21:08] just don't know now just so you know
[1:21:11] again it was not Luther's age they I'm
[1:21:14] sorry not Luther's generation he had it
[1:21:16] right it was the next generation that
[1:21:18] organized and that was wrong now brother
[1:21:21] have said this is not an age of
[1:21:23] restoration it's an age of reformation
[1:21:25] he said this is springtime he says this
[1:21:28] is the little shoe of the seed that was
[1:21:30] playing that in the ground back here
[1:21:32] during the death of the church now it
[1:21:33] started shooting up this is the tassel
[1:21:36] and then this is the seed at the end so
[1:21:41] brother Graham said Luther was
[1:21:43] springtime
[1:21:43] that means Wesley what's summertime
[1:21:48] brother branham said when you get a lot
[1:21:50] of your good fruit summertime right when
[1:21:54] you harvest your food usually well it
[1:21:55] depends you have cold weather crops and
[1:21:57] warm weather crops but you harvest a lot
[1:21:59] of good stuff in the summertime right we
[1:22:01] got apples and peaches and all these
[1:22:03] great corn sweet corns right in the
[1:22:05] middle of the summer right how many love
[1:22:07] sweet corn so Luther was springtime
[1:22:10] romances Wesley was summertime and Moran
[1:22:14] said this is the age of the open door
[1:22:16] see all these souls being saved well
[1:22:18] Graham said this is the age where God
[1:22:20] flourished the number of believers more
[1:22:23] than any other age because it was a
[1:22:25] missionary age but member they'd have
[1:22:27] all the power because they were just
[1:22:29] getting the realization of the name of
[1:22:30] Jesus the open door was the name they're
[1:22:33] just starting to get that the power in
[1:22:36] Jesus name
[1:22:37] program said though the generations that
[1:22:39] followed Wesley organized and died and
[1:22:43] that set the stage for the daughters
[1:22:45] three
[1:22:45] turn back to the mother Rome in laodicea
[1:22:48] man what wisdom church this had to bend
[1:22:50] the Holy Ghost I mean this has to be the
[1:22:52] Holy Ghost and let me tell you why
[1:22:54] because my family some of some people my
[1:22:57] family they bought my children church
[1:23:00] history books you guys remember that
[1:23:01] Malick I'd remember the church history
[1:23:02] books that our family bought us there's
[1:23:05] like a series of seven or eight books
[1:23:06] remember that and talks about
[1:23:07] Constantine okay
[1:23:09] so my family members I believe they used
[1:23:12] to go to the Baptist Church I'm not sure
[1:23:13] what they go to now but they bought my
[1:23:15] children a a series it was basically the
[1:23:18] seven churches except through the eyes
[1:23:20] of the Baptist Church and they were
[1:23:23] praising Constantine for uniting the
[1:23:26] church and state praising him and they
[1:23:29] were praising everything Luther did
[1:23:32] which remember not everything it was
[1:23:34] good and that so that's the way the
[1:23:37] denomination sees the church ages they
[1:23:40] see oh it's a good thing Constantine is
[1:23:41] it's a good thing for the Roman Catholic
[1:23:44] Church it's a good thing for the Dark
[1:23:46] Ages good thing for the Crusades they
[1:23:48] see all that is good where we see the
[1:23:50] opposite we say that we see that is bad
[1:23:52] right and so we see all this return of
[1:23:56] denominations and I was even when that
[1:23:58] Trinity guy was emailing members
[1:23:59] attorney guy was he he never emailed me
[1:24:01] back when I said him that thought that
[1:24:02] remember you shared that shot thought
[1:24:03] with me he never emailed me back yeah
[1:24:06] that's he's still thinking about it
[1:24:10] but even he was saying see he said all
[1:24:13] these denominations are good because at
[1:24:15] least people had a Creed that they could
[1:24:17] believe and not be deceived but I
[1:24:21] thought what about the move of the Holy
[1:24:23] Ghost that was trying to show them the
[1:24:24] truth and get them away from a tradition
[1:24:27] and get them back to the word amen now
[1:24:29] program did say God use organizations
[1:24:32] and denominations for a little bit of
[1:24:33] time but after that he sent the Prophet
[1:24:36] to reveal the Word of God to everyone so
[1:24:39] see were the only ones really there's a
[1:24:42] couple of churches like apostolic the
[1:24:44] oneness apple stock that they believe
[1:24:46] this too but most people do not believe
[1:24:48] this most people see denominations as a
[1:24:51] good thing but we see it as daughters of
[1:24:54] the mother harlot and they're all going
[1:24:56] to be thrown into a bed together and
[1:24:57] burn the Bible said
[1:24:59] but like I said I have books for my
[1:25:01] family Baptist history that says all
[1:25:03] these things are good the dark ages
[1:25:05] Constantine the Council of Nicaea they
[1:25:08] don't see it as daughters of a mother
[1:25:09] and a bad sense they see it as a good
[1:25:11] sense well she's the mother she had good
[1:25:12] holy daughters but she's an evil woman
[1:25:14] right she's called Mystery Babylon she's
[1:25:18] the mother of abominations it's exactly
[1:25:21] right and so what a program called this
[1:25:24] well gee I'm sorry Jesus called it Jesus
[1:25:26] not brother Graham Jesus called this age
[1:25:28] the synagogue of Satan again remember
[1:25:30] how repeated brother Branham gave this
[1:25:32] illustration he said notice synagogues
[1:25:33] and Satan he said one two gave it three
[1:25:36] gave it three Church ages and then it
[1:25:38] was back again
[1:25:39] but this is the age of the open door
[1:25:42] amen well while Satan is establishing
[1:25:45] his own churches and denominations
[1:25:46] synagogue of Satan Jesus is open the
[1:25:49] door say come on into the rapture hey
[1:25:50] come on in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:53] come into Jesus name in water baptism
[1:25:55] hallelujah that's right and now we're
[1:25:59] getting down to the end here praise the
[1:26:01] Lord can you believe this 59 sermons on
[1:26:05] the church can you believe that
[1:26:07] oh it's been I'm so happy it's kinda
[1:26:11] like if you finish a project you've been
[1:26:12] working on for years
[1:26:14] anybody got any projects you're working
[1:26:15] on for years out there this is like a
[1:26:17] project I've been working on for you
[1:26:18] Haven you got a project okay good
[1:26:20] praise the Lord Haven now Laodicea the
[1:26:28] last age now I got some thoughts up here
[1:26:31] I'm gonna go through these a little bit
[1:26:33] slower Luther with springtime Wesley
[1:26:35] with summer that means layer to see his
[1:26:36] harvest time
[1:26:37] this is the age of the harvest now
[1:26:42] program said there's not a great growth
[1:26:44] physically in harvest time how many can
[1:26:46] say amen to that you know that you've
[1:26:48] seen a fruit right before you pick it in
[1:26:51] the fall doesn't grow very much from
[1:26:53] summer to fall it's about the same size
[1:26:55] and program said that's exactly what's
[1:26:58] happening right now
[1:27:00] well the RAM said even the Falls Church
[1:27:03] their numbers aren't growing in fact if
[1:27:05] you I saw a recent study online and it
[1:27:07] said the church attendance in churches
[1:27:08] is falling nationwide even though the
[1:27:12] churches even
[1:27:13] I hate to say it like that but even the
[1:27:15] tear churches their numbers are
[1:27:16] declining it's not getting bigger and
[1:27:19] bigger and bigger now will it get bigger
[1:27:20] yes when they start putting money if you
[1:27:23] don't come to church we're gonna call if
[1:27:25] your ATM cards as soon as that happens
[1:27:27] you're gonna see a lot more people in
[1:27:28] their churches because the Bible said
[1:27:31] that take the mark of the beast they
[1:27:33] can't buy or sell anymore I'll go to
[1:27:35] church as long as I can have my money in
[1:27:37] my bank account that's the wrong reason
[1:27:39] to go to church you should go to church
[1:27:41] because you want to have a bank account
[1:27:43] in heaven amen
[1:27:44] you would have treasures in heaven amen
[1:27:46] but they only go to church you know and
[1:27:49] they can get their money in there their
[1:27:51] credit cards and ATM accounts ah but
[1:27:55] yeah church attendance is declining
[1:27:56] everywhere in America subra have said
[1:28:00] the same things true with the true line
[1:28:02] is our attendance skyrocketing here at
[1:28:04] Myra Christ fellowship no not really
[1:28:08] I want a round little message no every
[1:28:10] professor I talk to they're just trying
[1:28:12] to what they're trying to is just trying
[1:28:13] to train the young people up in the next
[1:28:14] generation because all their efforts
[1:28:16] they might win a soul here might win a
[1:28:18] soul here in the United States because
[1:28:19] member it's already been sowed over they
[1:28:21] might win a few souls here there but the
[1:28:23] main emphasis in America is the Train of
[1:28:25] these shouldn't try to get them saved
[1:28:27] before Satan gets to them amen
[1:28:29] try that's what I pray for my children
[1:28:31] up for every Sunday God fill him with
[1:28:33] the Holy Ghost help them to be
[1:28:34] sanctified God keep them from the grips
[1:28:37] of Satan I've already dedicated to
[1:28:39] Christ that don't mean I'm gonna give up
[1:28:41] praying
[1:28:41] I'm gonna pray even more hallelujah
[1:28:43] because I want Jesus to hear my prayers
[1:28:46] and I believe that he can't go over my
[1:28:48] prayers if I ask in his name Amen I'm
[1:28:50] just unbelieving like I said I can't
[1:28:52] guarantee my true gonna be safe but I'm
[1:28:54] gonna give it every effort I can to keep
[1:28:55] them safe and I had a good preacher one
[1:28:57] time tell me he said brother Jesse he
[1:28:59] said he told me this he had a future and
[1:29:02] I went wayward he said brother Jesse
[1:29:04] he said do everything with your children
[1:29:07] he said the mistake I made was that I
[1:29:09] didn't do more with my children he said
[1:29:12] I took too many preaching trips and left
[1:29:14] my children at home he said then when
[1:29:16] they got to be teenagers he said I let
[1:29:18] them hang out with questionable families
[1:29:20] in the church and they got introduced to
[1:29:22] pornography movies video games he said I
[1:29:25] should have what I should have done is
[1:29:27] then bring their friends over to my
[1:29:29] house that sound like godly wisdom right
[1:29:34] there
[1:29:34] absolutely he said everything you do do
[1:29:37] with your children don't let them go off
[1:29:38] and do some game you go with them but
[1:29:41] make sure it's a good game don't make it
[1:29:43] an unholy game make go play basketball
[1:29:45] with them or go play baseball with them
[1:29:47] go whatever be with them guard that like
[1:29:52] the Bible said guard your heart with all
[1:29:54] that you have amen
[1:29:55] guard the guard them guard your heart so
[1:30:00] see we have that responsibility we've
[1:30:01] got to train the young in the next
[1:30:03] generation we're not going to see much
[1:30:05] growth we'd say as far as great revival
[1:30:07] numbers because it's harvest time the
[1:30:10] seed doesn't get much bigger it's just
[1:30:12] it just change this member from the
[1:30:14] green stage to the yellow stage to the
[1:30:16] white stage remember that load the wheat
[1:30:18] the wheat seed has three stages in the
[1:30:21] first stage you can you can you can clip
[1:30:23] it and it bleeds milk the second stage
[1:30:25] you can rip the top part off but the
[1:30:28] third stage you put your fingernail on
[1:30:29] that thing it doesn't budge it's so
[1:30:32] solid you can't hurt it all and that's
[1:30:34] the kind of walk we need with Christ we
[1:30:36] need to be so solid that Satan's
[1:30:38] temptations can't hurt us at all amen oh
[1:30:40] yeah
[1:30:42] Satan can squeeze us all he wants and
[1:30:44] there's gonna come a squeeze yeah but it
[1:30:46] ain't gonna change us we're gonna be
[1:30:48] full word seed we're bride Christians
[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:52] the squeeze is just going to show what
[1:30:54] we are we're real Christians hallelujah
[1:30:56] amen it's exactly right not much growth
[1:31:02] during this time in fact what Jesus said
[1:31:05] it's fewer and fewer actually be saved
[1:31:06] as we go along
[1:31:07] let's preach on that and during the
[1:31:09] Philadelphia Church age program said the
[1:31:12] false seed will mature through false
[1:31:15] preachers but he said the true seed will
[1:31:19] mature through the message of the
[1:31:21] prophet of Malachi 4 5 and 6 he said
[1:31:26] the word of the Prophet will make the
[1:31:28] bride mighty inward and mighty in power
[1:31:31] amen I love that we're gonna be mighty
[1:31:36] in word and mighty in power
[1:31:39] how many can see the power of God
[1:31:41] already work in your life amen if it's
[1:31:45] not an outside miracles we're thank God
[1:31:47] for outside miracles when they happen
[1:31:48] but we should see the power of God on a
[1:31:50] daily basis in our lives
[1:31:52] overcoming sin death Helmand and the
[1:31:55] world overcoming this on a daily basis
[1:31:58] that's what we should see in our lives
[1:32:02] then the Prophet said the World Council
[1:32:04] of Churches is what is going to unite
[1:32:07] together the person the Antichrist will
[1:32:10] lead them although they won't envision
[1:32:12] it they won't they won't start out
[1:32:13] thinking he's going to lead them but
[1:32:15] eventually he'll take over because the
[1:32:16] woman Catholic Church rides the Beast
[1:32:18] and the World Council of Churches is the
[1:32:20] image erected to the Beast okay so the
[1:32:24] world counts the churches is the image
[1:32:26] and everybody's gonna see that's the
[1:32:27] organization but then that woman will
[1:32:29] ride that beast system the Roman
[1:32:32] Catholic Church will control that power
[1:32:34] and then the Prophet said then we'll see
[1:32:36] the maturation of the final fruit of
[1:32:39] both vines brother Branham said the mark
[1:32:44] in the hand is what I'm sorry the mark
[1:32:46] in the head is what the doctrine
[1:32:48] trinitarianism false baptisms women
[1:32:50] preachers all these false doctrines
[1:32:51] that's the mark in the head rabbana the
[1:32:53] mark in the hand is doing what the
[1:32:55] church wants you to do I know I'm
[1:32:56] reviewing these but it's part of that
[1:32:58] that's part of that chapter I thought I
[1:32:59] should review them and then he says
[1:33:03] remember this chapter is tracing those
[1:33:05] two spirits all the way down to the
[1:33:08] consummation and then he gets into the
[1:33:13] part we went over last week the
[1:33:14] beginning of this age and Laodicea was
[1:33:16] Azusa Street they sense in their spirits
[1:33:18] something told them this is the end so
[1:33:21] he started crying out to God send us
[1:33:23] powers than this power God answered amen
[1:33:26] after prayer means for February March
[1:33:29] God sent the Holy Ghost in April amen
[1:33:31] look at 3 don't worry just like the
[1:33:35] resurrection three days right so after a
[1:33:38] prayer means for February March and
[1:33:39] April
[1:33:40] God send the Holy Ghost away was the
[1:33:41] April 9th 1906 God sent the Holy Ghost
[1:33:44] or was April 13th I can't remember which
[1:33:46] one it was they thought it was the
[1:33:50] latter rain but we found out it couldn't
[1:33:53] be the latter rain because the former
[1:33:55] rain had not come yet which was the
[1:33:56] message of the hour former former in the
[1:33:59] Hebrew means teaching so the former rain
[1:34:01] is the teaching rain from the messenger
[1:34:03] and then the latter rain is rapturing
[1:34:05] faith from the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:34:09] in Wilbraham said remember there's two
[1:34:11] spirits there's Jesus of spirit and
[1:34:14] there's Judas his spirit there traced he
[1:34:18] said through the first four seals so let
[1:34:21] me get to that slide there the two
[1:34:24] spirits you've seen it before
[1:34:27] but these two spirits this period of
[1:34:29] Jesus is fighting the spirit of Satan in
[1:34:31] all four of these stages Jesus spirit
[1:34:35] was like a lion in the early days then
[1:34:37] it was an ox and it was a man
[1:34:38] now it's an eagle spirit a flying eagle
[1:34:41] or you're flying above denominations and
[1:34:44] the Creed's of man say in spirit went
[1:34:48] from white deception to red bloody to
[1:34:51] black ruling over the world in dark ages
[1:34:53] and now it's the pale spiritual death a
[1:34:56] sick it's so sick Jesus spits it out of
[1:34:58] his mouth right lukewarm is so is so
[1:35:02] pale and sick he spews them he don't
[1:35:04] talk through them anymore he'll talk
[1:35:06] through the bride because the spirit the
[1:35:07] brides they come that's right
[1:35:10] brother Branham said it is the spirit of
[1:35:13] Judas in the pale horse rider so the
[1:35:16] spirit of the Antichrist we'd say is the
[1:35:17] spirit of Judas it's one the same and
[1:35:20] notice he says this the person of the
[1:35:24] Antichrist will lead the world council
[1:35:26] of churches by his money just as Judas
[1:35:29] controlled the money bag oh what a good
[1:35:31] type there
[1:35:32] Judas held the money so the Antichrist
[1:35:34] will hold the gold of the world brother
[1:35:36] Branham says the gold the world all
[1:35:40] right now preaches
[1:35:42] most times but let's read it again
[1:35:43] because this is the this is the doctor
[1:35:47] and you're supposed to have I'm sorry
[1:35:48] this is the prophecy Joel 2:23 I
[1:35:50] preached it numerous times lately but
[1:35:52] I'm gonna keep preaching it until we
[1:35:53] live it
[1:35:54] that's includes me - Joel 2:23 brother
[1:35:58] Branham said these three these four
[1:36:00] scriptures are the prophecy thus saith
[1:36:02] the Lord it's going to happen before the
[1:36:04] rapture be glad then you turn it up sign
[1:36:07] and rejoice in the Lord your God so we
[1:36:08] should be happy rejoicing in Christ
[1:36:10] forgiving you the former rain monalee
[1:36:12] that's the prophets message and he will
[1:36:14] cause to come down for you the rain the
[1:36:16] former rain and the latter rain in his
[1:36:18] first month and the floor shall be full
[1:36:22] of wheat and the VAT shall overflow with
[1:36:25] wine and oil this is where he says the
[1:36:27] fullness of the Spirit will be in the
[1:36:29] bride
[1:36:30] all the wine all the oil all the wheat
[1:36:33] all the bread everything spiritually we
[1:36:35] have need of is supposed to be with us
[1:36:38] before the rapture amen that's right
[1:36:40] that's not saith the Lord and I'll
[1:36:43] restore to you the years that the
[1:36:45] locusts have eaten the canker and the
[1:36:47] caterpillar of the poem and member these
[1:36:49] are the four horse riders right there
[1:36:51] the for insects same insect in four
[1:36:53] stages just like the four horse riders
[1:36:56] are the same demon power just four
[1:36:58] different stages amen so everything that
[1:37:01] had at Christ fear took away from the
[1:37:02] church we're supposed to get it back
[1:37:04] hallelujah that's why I get excited
[1:37:06] because I would live to see that I would
[1:37:09] have lived to see where the fullness of
[1:37:11] Pentecost is in this church amen
[1:37:14] and I so believe that that you remember
[1:37:17] when I preached on the keys of the door
[1:37:18] I preached on keys the door on December
[1:37:23] was at December 4 2016 remember I told
[1:37:27] people when they come up to the altar I
[1:37:28] said write it down what you prayed for
[1:37:30] it you remember that when I preached
[1:37:31] that it's okay if you don't remember
[1:37:32] that but I wrote it down and I was
[1:37:35] crying up there and I said the key to
[1:37:36] the door okay the key is the word I'll
[1:37:41] remember that the key is the word so
[1:37:43] this is the key I'm holding on it you
[1:37:46] probably don't see it but I'm holding on
[1:37:47] this key tonight and what I'm holding it
[1:37:51] on to is my hand the mother may have
[1:37:52] said you're holding on to at the hand of
[1:37:54] your
[1:37:56] and he said you're only as strong with
[1:37:59] the key as your faith is with the Word
[1:38:01] of God that's why I said yeah I'm
[1:38:05] praying I'm gonna see this key open the
[1:38:08] door in my lifetime where this church we
[1:38:10] see the fullness of Pentecost in this
[1:38:12] church what does that mean really just
[1:38:13] that means that when God wants to do a
[1:38:15] miracle he can do it because all the sin
[1:38:17] is purged out of our church right and I
[1:38:22] said that's the key I said I want Lord I
[1:38:23] said I want those two promises I want
[1:38:25] the full of full of the Pentecost and
[1:38:27] the bride and I prayed for another
[1:38:29] family too that would come to the church
[1:38:30] they haven't come yet but I'm still
[1:38:32] praying for them I just asked God I
[1:38:34] didn't I just was hoping God would bring
[1:38:36] that family to the church but see we're
[1:38:38] supposed to have it restored it's
[1:38:40] supposed to be given back to us restored
[1:38:43] the great army which I sent among you
[1:38:45] and ye shall eat in plenty that's what
[1:38:47] I'm saying we should be happy when we
[1:38:49] eat on the Word of God we should have
[1:38:51] plenty to eat on with the Word of God
[1:38:52] and be satisfied we should be satisfied
[1:38:55] with the word and praise the name of the
[1:38:57] Lord your God who had dealt wonderous
[1:39:00] Lee with you and my people shall never
[1:39:02] be ashamed we won't be ashamed to be
[1:39:04] Holy Ghost Oh Christians hey hallelujah
[1:39:07] we won't be ashamed
[1:39:09] we'll be so thankful how God has worked
[1:39:11] in our lives God you have worked
[1:39:14] wonderfully with my life you've kept me
[1:39:17] from such evil you've kept me from all
[1:39:19] my temptations you have one nurse Lee
[1:39:21] dealt with me that's what the bride's
[1:39:23] gonna have that's thus saith the Lord
[1:39:25] it's not enough save me
[1:39:27] it's thus saith the Lord does that help
[1:39:30] by God's grace I know I preach that
[1:39:32] probably five or six times in the last
[1:39:34] two years I preached out a lot but
[1:39:36] listen that's the prophecy we have to
[1:39:38] fulfill like when brother Darrell
[1:39:40] preached that it's me it's me what's me
[1:39:42] that Joel too is me Joel too is you
[1:39:46] that's you that's what you're supposed
[1:39:48] to be that's what I'm supposed to be I'm
[1:39:50] supposed to be satisfied with the things
[1:39:52] of God I'm supposed to rejoice in the
[1:39:55] Lord my God I'm supposed to enjoy all
[1:39:57] the wine all the oil and all the wheat I
[1:40:00] can possibly have oh oh
[1:40:02] glory amen thank you Jesus now you got
[1:40:07] your Bible well you've got it memorized
[1:40:09] brother ban would close to this part by
[1:40:11] saying Mathew 24:24 is in complete
[1:40:14] fulfillment right now so I'm gonna read
[1:40:15] that for you mo so you could probably
[1:40:18] you can probably finish it after I
[1:40:20] started so let's see I'll give you a
[1:40:21] test and we ready for a pop quiz tonight
[1:40:24] Matthew 24 I don't give them at school I
[1:40:27] just I just gave my church Matthew 24:24
[1:40:31] I'll start it you finish it for there
[1:40:34] shall rise good false Christ good and
[1:40:39] false false prophets good false Christ's
[1:40:42] and false prophets good and shall show
[1:40:45] great signs and wonders and so much that
[1:40:49] if it were they should have Siva all
[1:40:54] right give yourselves run you pass
[1:40:56] the test
[1:40:58] glory but see it's got like with this is
[1:41:01] I know how this is how you feel I want
[1:41:03] it in my head but I also want to in my
[1:41:05] heart because any preacher out there I
[1:41:08] anybody can have anywhere in their heart
[1:41:10] but this is the word where we gotta say
[1:41:11] this is me it's written on my heart and
[1:41:14] I'm gonna manifest this prophesy amen
[1:41:16] glory it's a great job on your pop quiz
[1:41:20] tonight program said this isn't complete
[1:41:23] fulfillment right now and look around
[1:41:25] you see how the big the big TV preachers
[1:41:27] with all kinds of money they have
[1:41:28] miracles I was reading on one of the
[1:41:30] I'll just say it Joel scenes website and
[1:41:32] his testimony page has many healings on
[1:41:35] that page many but yet he said I'll go
[1:41:39] to a homosexual wedding and support a
[1:41:41] homosexual now Church see that see the
[1:41:44] deception that the anointing falls on
[1:41:47] him while he's preaching and people get
[1:41:49] saved well I don't know maybe but I know
[1:41:53] one thing they get healed and I've seen
[1:41:56] videos where people have driven across
[1:41:57] the country to come to his church shake
[1:41:59] his hand and some thank you for a
[1:42:00] preacher I got healed by your preaching
[1:42:03] the anointing falls on the just and the
[1:42:06] unjust but yet he'll go to a homosexual
[1:42:11] wedding and say it's okay for a man to
[1:42:13] marry man it's okay for a woman to marry
[1:42:15] where marry woman that's fine and he
[1:42:18] says I don't preach on that because I
[1:42:19] don't want to cause division in the
[1:42:21] church well that's what
[1:42:22] Jesus said I come to divide your family
[1:42:25] I don't come to bring peace now he gives
[1:42:28] peace in you but he said I don't come to
[1:42:30] bring peace in your family I come to
[1:42:32] bring a sword in your family so see he's
[1:42:35] preaching a different Jesus right he's
[1:42:40] got some things right about Jesus but
[1:42:41] there's other parts and don't really
[1:42:43] line up with Jesus on it and I think
[1:42:45] he's a fine he's a probably fine man but
[1:42:47] if he don't take a sin against sin he's
[1:42:48] gonna answer for that on the day of
[1:42:49] judgment just like me if I don't think I
[1:42:52] stayed on sin I'll answer on the day of
[1:42:53] judgment I'm not picking on preachers
[1:42:56] I'm not jealous of him I mean I'm happy
[1:42:58] he's got money but that can be a big
[1:43:00] snare if you're not careful that can be
[1:43:02] a big snare what we need is not more
[1:43:04] money we need more of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:06] that's what we need amen
[1:43:07] to keep all the sin out and then do
[1:43:09] miracles and save people we just need
[1:43:11] more of the Holy Ghost but see they have
[1:43:14] partial Holy Ghost but not all the Holy
[1:43:16] Ghost that's complete fulfillment today
[1:43:22] false Christ
[1:43:24] false prophets rising up among you and
[1:43:25] it's so deceptive that they deceived the
[1:43:29] very lected if it were possible that's
[1:43:30] in fulfilling right now
[1:43:33] now look can I let me read you this here
[1:43:35] brother Bram said these false preachers
[1:43:38] will listen outshine he said outshine
[1:43:41] the elect in effort and zeal no let me
[1:43:48] ask you this question how much effort
[1:43:50] have you given to feed the poor you say
[1:43:52] well I maybe did this to that let me
[1:43:55] show you one of my friends is in
[1:43:55] denominational Church and he runs
[1:43:57] marathons to get sponsors and had they
[1:44:01] just their group just raised a million
[1:44:02] dollars to send food to Africa and to
[1:44:06] dig wells in Africa where they don't
[1:44:08] have clean water now who gave more
[1:44:11] effort to the poor the message churches
[1:44:14] or denominational churches the church
[1:44:19] said they gave way more effort than we
[1:44:21] did right prove it well I will prove it
[1:44:26] they gave thousands of their own dollars
[1:44:28] so they gave more money than we did and
[1:44:32] they ran a 26.2 mile marathon they gave
[1:44:38] a lot more effort and brother Graham
[1:44:39] said they're gonna have more effort and
[1:44:40] zeal than we have he said but it's the
[1:44:43] wrong zeal amen Lori just like the Jews
[1:44:47] they have a lot of zeal for Moses but
[1:44:50] they got the wrong zeal because now
[1:44:52] Christ is our Moses with me church
[1:44:55] brother band says the false church is
[1:44:58] going to outshine you in effort and in
[1:45:02] zeal but it's not about natural effort
[1:45:04] it's not about natural zeal it's about
[1:45:07] holy go seal amen because that same guy
[1:45:11] will wear shorts when he runs the race
[1:45:13] brother Adam and he'll wear a tank top
[1:45:16] showing off his big muscles the same guy
[1:45:18] and then they'll have women painting
[1:45:20] face with makeup showing off their
[1:45:22] chests running in a race cause some
[1:45:25] brothers so I wonder how many brothers
[1:45:26] look over there and during the race lust
[1:45:28] after them and commit adultery while
[1:45:30] they're doing it but who's got more
[1:45:32] effort and zeal they do naturally but
[1:45:35] what about you
[1:45:36] you've got spiritual
[1:45:39] you got spiritual CIA men and let me
[1:45:43] tell you this church listen you you put
[1:45:46] forth more spiritual effort to crucify
[1:45:49] the lusts of the flesh than they ever
[1:45:51] did Amen somebody ought to be saying
[1:45:54] Amen out there I just told you you're
[1:45:57] not giving effort like them but now I
[1:45:59] told you you're giving more effort than
[1:46:00] them you're giving more effort
[1:46:02] spiritually to crucify the lusts of the
[1:46:05] flesh than they ever give to crucify
[1:46:07] their lusts of the flesh
[1:46:08] Amen I just said you don't have as much
[1:46:12] zeal and effort now I'm saying you have
[1:46:13] more zeal and more effort spiritual zeal
[1:46:17] and effort are you with me Church that's
[1:46:19] why I've got to make sure I don't feel
[1:46:21] bad I went to remember I told you went
[1:46:22] to my students game on Saturday at this
[1:46:24] fancy Church in Fairlawn it's a huge
[1:46:26] mega church in Fairlawn and they were
[1:46:29] showing how they sent twenty thousand
[1:46:32] meals to Africa last year twenty
[1:46:34] thousand and I felt bad for a moment
[1:46:37] for a moment and then I watched all
[1:46:41] those women walk down the the mothers of
[1:46:43] all the people the children playing
[1:46:44] basketball i watch them all walk down
[1:46:46] with high heels on i wants to mark with
[1:46:49] high heels on and their skin tight jeans
[1:46:51] on and they're paying up faces and cut
[1:46:53] hair and I wonder hum and then they're
[1:46:55] showing off their cleavage I wonder how
[1:46:56] many of those women are they sending
[1:46:57] those men to hell praise the Lord and if
[1:47:01] they don't repent they're gonna answer
[1:47:02] for exposing themselves so I felt bad
[1:47:05] for a moment and I think of this quote
[1:47:08] now those churches are going to blow us
[1:47:12] away in natural effort and zeal
[1:47:15] naturally but by the grace of God we
[1:47:19] will have more effort and zeal in the
[1:47:21] spiritual side there's my time does
[1:47:26] every wonder standing I'm not trying to
[1:47:28] make you feel bad I hope you understand
[1:47:31] they have more physical and natural
[1:47:33] effort zeal we have more spiritual zeal
[1:47:36] and more spiritual effort when you're
[1:47:39] down there on your knees Church and your
[1:47:41] prayer closet god help me not to give in
[1:47:43] to this money temptation help me not to
[1:47:45] give in this lust and help me not to
[1:47:46] give and you're preying on these and yet
[1:47:48] they get they don't have to do that they
[1:47:49] got they could just do whatever they
[1:47:51] you know Oh God will forgive me God Oh
[1:47:52] forgive me who's given more effort
[1:47:54] you're giving more effort amen
[1:47:58] will you come to church faithfully three
[1:48:00] times a week and you don't care how hard
[1:48:02] the preacher preaches you just say let
[1:48:03] Jesus's word be preached amen
[1:48:06] but they won't come to church unless it
[1:48:08] tickles their ears Oh fine
[1:48:11] he won't preach what I like I'll go to
[1:48:13] some other church I'll change my ranks
[1:48:17] and I'll go to the Methodist tonight or
[1:48:20] I'll go to the the the Canton church or
[1:48:22] the the Canton mega church I'll go to
[1:48:25] that mega church down in 77
[1:48:27] they won't preach what I like you see
[1:48:30] but you just keep coming back for hard
[1:48:34] sermon after hard sermon because it's
[1:48:36] Christ words it's because you love Jesus
[1:48:39] Christ and you know Jesus Christ is the
[1:48:42] word amen hallelujah so don't feel bad
[1:48:47] that we don't send 20,000 meals overseas
[1:48:49] to Africa we can't we can't do that we
[1:48:54] don't have the plane to do that they
[1:48:57] have all kinds of resources and millions
[1:48:59] and millions of dollars pumping into
[1:49:01] theirs we have you know maybe three
[1:49:02] thousand dollars a month and a 1200 that
[1:49:05] goes to rent Church some months four
[1:49:09] thousand I'll show you the finances if
[1:49:12] you'd like me to show you the money
[1:49:13] heads but see God's not after the number
[1:49:16] he's after the quality he's never been
[1:49:20] after big numbers and he's after the
[1:49:21] quality of the number just like you do
[1:49:27] you want to do you just want the
[1:49:29] cheapest and you're the cheapest pair of
[1:49:31] shoes or do you want a quality pair of
[1:49:33] shoes it's gonna last you longer you
[1:49:35] want the cheap cheap jacket or you want
[1:49:38] a jacket that's gonna last you you want
[1:49:40] quality because you know if you get a
[1:49:42] cheap one you just got to get another
[1:49:44] one a few months later right more and
[1:49:47] more and more and more money you know
[1:49:48] you want quality and that's how God is
[1:49:51] he wants quality and his wife you don't
[1:49:54] want to pretend wife that can produce
[1:49:55] all like Vashti you know just be pretty
[1:49:57] on the outside but not have real
[1:49:59] character he wants to Esther he wants a
[1:50:01] star of God he wasn't somebody who
[1:50:03] shines the light of God
[1:50:05] hey man let me close I'm going over
[1:50:07] again here here we go
[1:50:08] praise the Lord you love the Lord
[1:50:10] tonight I just you know have all these
[1:50:12] ideas and I'm just trying to follow the
[1:50:15] idea of the holy spirit help me Jesus
[1:50:17] brother branham said how do you know
[1:50:19] that the effort zeal is false he said
[1:50:22] because they go after big crowds look
[1:50:24] after big churches big money and then
[1:50:26] they brag online and they brag on
[1:50:29] Facebook and they brag on their church
[1:50:31] signs of how much they gave away where
[1:50:34] Jesus said real giving is giving in
[1:50:35] secret and Jesus said giving two mites
[1:50:39] 3/8 of a penny if that's all you have
[1:50:42] giving 3/8 of a penny it's more than
[1:50:44] giving a million dollars if that's just
[1:50:46] your extra money see God's looking at
[1:50:49] the quality of what you do how many love
[1:50:52] the Lord I love a God like that he's not
[1:50:54] looking at the amount he's looking at
[1:50:56] the quality of what you give sincerity
[1:50:59] secrecy private giving humble giving
[1:51:01] humility God's looking for humility and
[1:51:07] brother Branham said here's another
[1:51:08] thing he said they won't preach on
[1:51:10] controversial subjects because it'll
[1:51:12] deplete their crowd and their less money
[1:51:14] that's why Joel Osteen and other
[1:51:16] preachers won't preach about
[1:51:17] homosexuality it will decrease their
[1:51:20] numbers whereas that's about all we
[1:51:22] preaches controversial things right yeah
[1:51:27] I've had people visit you know and I had
[1:51:30] a brother remember Steve Alexander never
[1:51:32] remember Steve Alexander he used to come
[1:51:33] here Malachi okay he's a big tall skinny
[1:51:35] guy he kind of exhaustion you know
[1:51:37] physical problems you know he brought
[1:51:39] some of his preacher friends one time
[1:51:41] over when we were at the wilder church
[1:51:43] and I was preaching on the three works
[1:51:44] of grace and he couldn't I started off
[1:51:47] with justification he was looking at me
[1:51:49] pretty good but pretty soon when I got
[1:51:50] into sanctification and the baptism all
[1:51:52] he goes he got real stiff on me and we
[1:51:55] talked afterwards and he said well he
[1:51:57] said I kind of understood some of the
[1:51:58] things you said and he's a rope he's a
[1:52:00] real smart guy he's he's a teacher that
[1:52:02] one of the chapel churches over here and
[1:52:04] he said but I'll have to look up that
[1:52:05] Wesley and Zuza and random thing off
[1:52:09] they look back that look at that get
[1:52:10] back to you and he never got back to me
[1:52:12] I don't have his number I'll somebody
[1:52:14] got back to him he didn't want me to
[1:52:16] have his number
[1:52:17] in fact he sent me a text saying don't
[1:52:19] keep my number he actually took me that
[1:52:20] into text he didn't want to contact me
[1:52:23] but see that's what they don't want to
[1:52:26] preach on controversial things and that
[1:52:29] shows we do love God because God's Word
[1:52:31] in its purity is controversial to them
[1:52:34] but to us its purity to us there's no
[1:52:38] controversy about it
[1:52:40] it's the plain truth amen it's just if
[1:52:43] that's what it says believe it it's
[1:52:45] God's Word amen what do you mean
[1:52:48] sanctify I can't smoke and can't wear
[1:52:51] high heels and what do you care
[1:52:53] the Bible says you don't tinkle on these
[1:52:56] you know the Bible says these things but
[1:52:59] it's too controversial we don't want to
[1:53:00] split our church let the church be split
[1:53:02] let the chips fall where they may
[1:53:04] the true children of God will never
[1:53:06] leave the Word of God amen that's
[1:53:10] encouraging me amen
[1:53:11] small Church that's fine oh we love it
[1:53:13] we just want people here that are in the
[1:53:15] right ranks hallelujah
[1:53:17] we don't want goat amongst our sheep we
[1:53:21] don't want wolves amongst our sheep do
[1:53:22] we Paul cried because wolves would come
[1:53:25] against or come amongst the Sheep Paul
[1:53:27] cried and here's the last thing Miriam
[1:53:32] says whenever the false churches these
[1:53:34] false tainted churches whenever they get
[1:53:37] cornered on a false doctrine where
[1:53:40] they're wrong let's say father and only
[1:53:41] ghost I'm trying to close mercy or
[1:53:43] Trinity whenever they get cornered their
[1:53:45] last excuse is well we get results don't
[1:53:49] we so we must be of God and that's what
[1:53:53] churches say today
[1:53:53] well we help the we have the poor in
[1:53:55] Africa we're saving all these souls or
[1:53:57] we get we get healings on our website
[1:53:59] there's testimony people we get results
[1:54:02] God must be with us so where does it
[1:54:05] come down to they don't even they can't
[1:54:06] even ascertain the true spirit of God
[1:54:08] from the false spirit they think the
[1:54:10] true spirit of God that heals their sick
[1:54:12] and save souls and save people from
[1:54:14] dying they think that same spirit lets
[1:54:16] them watch dirty movies
[1:54:17] cut their hair cuss and smoke and do all
[1:54:20] these evil things that the Bible says is
[1:54:22] wrong they have so little understanding
[1:54:25] they can't even discern the two spirits
[1:54:26] but thank God we can discern the two
[1:54:29] spirits in the framework of the church
[1:54:31] let's stay on our feet alright last
[1:54:37] thing this is the I'm gonna read the
[1:54:43] last paragraph of the book if you
[1:54:45] haven't read it read it not for one
[1:54:48] moment do I brother branham bring a
[1:54:50] message to the people that they may
[1:54:52] follow me or join my church or start
[1:54:57] some fellowship and organization I've
[1:54:59] never done that and I will not do that
[1:55:01] now I have no interest in doing those
[1:55:04] things but I do have an interest in the
[1:55:08] things of God in people and if I can
[1:55:10] accomplish just one thing I'll be
[1:55:12] satisfied who knows what brother Graham
[1:55:14] wanted to accomplish the one thing is to
[1:55:19] see established a true spiritual
[1:55:23] relationship between God and men amen
[1:55:26] that's one reason why I love brother
[1:55:29] Branham brother Branham never point
[1:55:31] himself come to my church remember they
[1:55:33] all want to join his church he said go
[1:55:34] where the Holy Spirit lead you he never
[1:55:37] said start an organization and follow
[1:55:38] William Graham call the Branham
[1:55:40] organization he never said that that's
[1:55:44] why I love brother brand that's why I
[1:55:45] know he's a true man of God he never
[1:55:47] said you've got to follow me to be saved
[1:55:49] you got to follow me to do this you got
[1:55:51] to follow me he never pointed to himself
[1:55:53] he only pointed to Christ his whole goal
[1:55:58] writing this book or preaching what this
[1:56:00] is 381 pages the whole goal writing this
[1:56:04] book is so that you can have a spiritual
[1:56:06] relationship between God and yourself in
[1:56:12] other words you can discern the fall
[1:56:13] spirit this is not a relationship with
[1:56:15] Jesus and this is a relationship with
[1:56:17] Jesus and that's what this whole chapter
[1:56:20] was about tracing these two spirits
[1:56:22] through the church the one thing I want
[1:56:27] to see is establishes a true spirits
[1:56:28] relationship between God and men wearing
[1:56:30] men become new creatures in Christ
[1:56:33] filled with the spirit and live
[1:56:35] according to his word I would invite
[1:56:40] plead and warn all to hear his voice at
[1:56:42] this time and yield your lives
[1:56:44] completely to
[1:56:45] even as I trust in my heart I have given
[1:56:48] my all to him god bless you and may his
[1:56:51] coming rejoice your heart let's get a
[1:56:52] lawyer on the law they met hallelujah
[1:56:55] Jesus thank you lord
[1:56:57] oh my thank you Jesus
[1:57:00] that's why we know he's a man of God he
[1:57:03] wasn't trying to say oh you better if
[1:57:05] you leave my church if you don't read
[1:57:07] the church age book you're going to hell
[1:57:08] you know he said as I've tried to do is
[1:57:11] get you to feel like you have a true
[1:57:13] relationship between God and yourself
[1:57:15] that you can no I'm not of the false
[1:57:18] church I'm not of the Antichrist I am of
[1:57:21] the true spirit of Christ how many
[1:57:23] thankful you're part of the true spirit
[1:57:24] of Christ how many are thankful that the
[1:57:27] message has come and now you feel like
[1:57:29] you know who God is that's the whole
[1:57:32] point of this message was to help us to
[1:57:34] know Christ and him crucified and in
[1:57:37] knowing him and his crucifixion then the
[1:57:39] power of the Holy Ghost comes into you
[1:57:40] and then you become a part of the true
