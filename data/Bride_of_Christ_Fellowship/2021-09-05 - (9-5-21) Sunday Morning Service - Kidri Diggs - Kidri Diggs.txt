========================================

it ain't too often i hear a song and i don't want to serenade my lord but you think about that i've been touched by fire you know it's saying it says let the whole world watch me burn hallelujah think about that when you see something on fire everybody stops to see what's burning hey man you can be on the highway a car catch on fire it'll back all the traffic up because everybody want to watch it burn hallelujah a house catch on fire in the neighborhood everybody comes out of their houses just to watch it burn hallelujah now if we're on fire for god you better believe somebody is watching your life amen amen and it's jesus amen great hallelujah i'll tell you right now we're going to be singing it at our church amen amen i already already know i'm gonna call the musician and say hey i got a song i want to sing oh my glory i'm just happy about the lord amen we certainly love all of you and thank god for you we certainly appreciate brother jesse and his wife and family amen and spiritual family you know it's always a blessing coming this way but most of all we appreciate the presence of the lord you know for what good would it be for us to gather and god not be here you know and just god confirming his word even but jesse telling me what the brother preached at the nazarene church and confirmed to me that i'm finna speak the right thing amen so so uh the lord is in control you know and uh he's worthy of praise let's have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of god if you have an unspoken request you can acknowledge it by uplifted hand for god knows the thoughts and intents upon each and every heart and i want you to believe that as you lift that hand god hears your prayer he knows exactly what you stand in need of but give him a chance to answer that prayer let's pray lord jesus father we raise our hands unto you as an act of faith lord knowing that your word is true lord and you say wherever two or three are gathered in your name you're also there in the midst so we believe that we're standing and we're we're in divine presence so lord we just pray you just continue to shape and mold us into the image of your mind lord there's anything in us that's not like you we pray that you would remove it lord jesus and replace with something new and refreshing of thy spirit lord forgive us for our sins and trespasses lord and we don't just want to be sometimes christians but we want to be every day all day leaning on the blood of jesus christ living by the virtues of the spirit lord and lord listening for your your word and your direction as we daily walk believing that the spoken word is real and lord god we put our different requests out there lord knowing that there's a god who knows and sees all and father we we ask lord you just come lord and send your anointing your holy ghost anointing lord to break us away from this flesh and put us back in our original places our original spots where adam had daily communion with you lord he wasn't afraid he didn't it didn't matter how he looked or what he thought he just knew at this certain time i'm going to go meet god and lord we're here because we believe that this place has been dedicated to meet you father now lord we know that you're going to do your part just help us father to surrender all unto you lord and we'll be careful to give you all the honor glory and praise in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray at church amen amen you have your bibles let's turn to matthew uh saint matthew chapter six by the grace of god i'm gonna go ahead and come out of this jacket amen matthew chapter six hallelujah matthew chapter six let's start reading at um verse 30. matthew 6 and verse 30. the bible says wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which the day is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or whether will wherewith shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but this is the solution but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you there take therefore no fault for tomorrow for the moral shall take thought of the things of itself sufficient until the day is the evil thereof let's go to second peter chapter one second peter chapter one and verse five let's let's let's back up to verse four second peter one and four the bible says whereby are we given unto us exceeding and great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption is that is in this world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness into godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen may lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats amen you know by by the grace of god i want to use for a subject spiritual alignment spiritual alignment amen you know one one thing i i love about god god is obligated to his word you know he can't alter it he can't change it he once he give it he can't take it back and he has to confirm it amen so god is you know he's held he's handcuffed to the word of god amen so if we could find ourselves aligned with that word we'll get the results of what god said amen you know but when we think about alignment what is an alignment alignment is to be uh running in the same direction of something that that that that's working for your good amen but if i can let me start with a vehicle you know most of us have cars out here and you know your wheels have to be aligned amen you know it doesn't matter you could be driving a uh uh uh one of my favorite cars you could be driving a 2021 ghost rolls-royce amen or you could be driving a 2021 uh maserati but if your tires are not aligned you will still have a rough ride amen the tires have to be balanced and aligned amen no matter how expensive the car is no matter how good the luxury text and wood grain and all that things inside of it if your wheels are not balanced and aligned you're in for a rough ride amen it doesn't matter how good the warranty is on the car it doesn't matter how expensive it is if the tires and the wheels the foundation of that vehicle is not aligned and balanced you're in for a rough ride amen so for us as christians it be habit does it behold us to be aligned and balanced with the word of god you say brother jesus how do i know if i'm unbalanced how do i know if my tires are not aligned just look at your life amen look at your life and and pay attention whether you're listening to god amen because god on a daily basis is trying to light us up amen with his word because whether you believe it or not god wants to bless you more than you can imagine because when you get blessed it turns us into testimony mode and we start to lift up his name we start to exalt the lord holy and out of all that god gives glory amen so he knows when he allows us to be lined up and balanced amen we get blessed and he gets glory out of our life but how do you know when your car is not aligned hey man it's very easy just turn the steering wheel loose and it'll go into a certain direction that's off hallelujah now you look at yourself spiritually amen are you going into a direction that's off hallelujah it's your daily life moving you to a direction that's off the things that you read isn't off the thing that you listen to is it all the things that you look at is it off and if you're going to a direction that's not leading you to god that means you need to be spiritually alive it's very simple hallelujah without god your life will go into a direction that doesn't edify him but if you are lying right everywhere you look you see god hallelujah see sometimes in alignment amen you can buy some brand new tires but if that car is not a line those tires will wear down faster and if you're not aligned with god you will mentally be wear down faster you will spiritually wear it down faster amen but if you hallelujah get aligned with god you will realize that we have an advocate what is an advocate a advocate is someone who can do what you can't do hunger and god is our advocate we couldn't save ourselves we couldn't redeem ourselves we don't even know the direction we should go but because he's an advocate he leads us in the paths of righteousness oh my church let's get spiritually aligned because once you align yourself with the word of god then you have god hardly on your side think about it he said don't take no thought of your clothes don't take no thought of your eating or your drinking but seek ye first the kingdom and if you seek the kingdom now the bible says all these things church church i'm not boasting i'm not bragging but i've given my life hallelujah to to serve the lord so i ride to the neighborhood hallelujah of the house i want to build holly the place i want to stay and i'm looking for god to do something why because i'm already alive i'm already hallelujah lined up doing what god wants me to do so i'm looking for him to fulfill his word he said seek me first and all these other things to be added to you so i'm looking for god to bring something to my life the bankers say do you got the down payment no but god does [Applause] how many bedrooms at least four do you have enough furniture for foe no but god does let me give you an example let me give you an example sometimes we stop the lord from moving by what we speak out of our mouth spoken word is the original seed you know the greatest battle of a fault where in the mind but most of those battles are lost and worn by your mouth every battle is either won or lost by the way you speak about what's going on in your mind hallelujah so you know church what i would i like to do i like to a man speak positive things over myself but you know i i i have a real a friend who's a real estate broker and she went and bought this nice big massive house harley she comes she comes out of a prosperity church but you know it's it's that's why i commend what brother jesse is doing when we met she was going to a prosperity church but sweet person you can tell that she's really her and her husband they're really living to their conviction right here they may not understand the whole ins and outs about prosperity but what they believe they give their whole heart to it amen and you know we've become friends over the years real good friends me and her husband and her real good friends and when they bought this new house hallelujah one day i she they were showing me the house and she said kadri come on over i want you to see the new house and we were in there walking around church her basement this building can fit in her basement why because they believe god and you know church i was looking around leaving and i said i was leaving the house and i was like man this is nice this is a nice house i said but i don't need something this big she said who told you that that's right that's right she said who told you that she said we're supposed to be children of god and before god can give give us what he wants to give us we're already stopping him from doing it hallelujah if god wants to bless you honey according to how he wants to bless you who are you to tell him not to do it church the scripture says he can do exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ask or sing now i'm sitting there looking at this house and i'm thinking this is too big but the scripture says he's exceedingly [Music] he's exceedingly think about a blessing right now i want you to think about something you want god to do amen you got it are you thinking about it now i want you to know that he will do exceedingly no i don't need a 6 000 square feet house but if god give it to me i'm going to praise him all day long no i don't need a maserati but he give me one i'll drive it up here and preach in it because that's what it means to be spiritually aligned when you get spiritually aligned all the things that god promised you become yours [Music] but you have to line up with the word of god hallelujah not only just thinking of lining it up with the word of god but lining up with the purpose of his calling there's too many people in church not living by purpose but they're here just to relieve their conscience well they're here just to oh it's sunday i'm supposed to be here no god has a purpose for you you say brother dave i'm gonna show you how special you are if god had a purpose for judas and he was to be he was to be given over unto the devil why wouldn't he have a purpose for you if he's gonna let the devil walk with the church do all the supernatural things in the church hallelujah get so close to jesus he can betray him with a kiss you think he got a purpose for you hallelujah but are you spiritual you're lying see what we have to realize that god has laws hallelujah he has spiritual laws amen that he can't take away hallelujah he has natural laws that are still operating from the day of creation hallelujah just the natural laws are still operating the way god told them to operate hungary church by show up amen can a bird still fly i said by a short amends can a bird still fly you see that don't you don't you see that bird flying why is he flying because he's aligned with the law of god nothing can stop that that's what he was created for he was created to fly holy it doesn't matter how high the mountain is it doesn't matter how high the tree is there's a law in him that when he jumps off of it something kicks in by revelation and says fly he doesn't doubt it he doesn't reason with it it doesn't matter whether it's raining snowing a hurricane a tornado it doesn't change that love your child and tribulation doesn't change the law of god working inside of you you ever seen a bird jump off the cliff with his wings closed no those wings have a purpose so when they jump off they're already in motion it's it's like first nature they know that they've been given something for this particular purpose holly so when it jumps off it doesn't jump off in fear it jumps off knowing that it has an element of faith already built inside of it [Music] there's an element inside of it that just operates in the law of god harley and you know what you can do you can take that bird and put it in a zoo put it in the cage that doesn't change the law [Applause] why do you think when they capture eagles and different birds they put a chain on his ankle hollering because they know as soon as they open that cage let's go go why because it's not created to live down here on the ground it's creating to be in the heavens and the first opportunity it gets to show the world the law inside of it it's going to fly nothing can stop it he can be caged up for five years but it's just like riding the bike and sometimes it can be so caged up that it gets depressed remember the prophet talked about that bird right how long that had it was it was tied up so long that even when it got free he still thought it was tied up but you know what the man had to do he had to shoot it he had to run it hardly he had to push it into the law that it was already given earlier and sometimes god has to push us into the law that's already in us look brother branham didn't know he had spoken word authority god put him in positions where he had no choice but to speak hallelujah god put him on a mountain with a blizzard coming hallelujah and then god said hey can i walk with you and then the lord stopped walking with him in the midst of the blizzard and the blizzard going he said snowflakes were so big you couldn't even see it in front of you and then god came and said there's a law inside of you speak to it and it will obey you i want somebody to speak to their storm and that storm will obey you that's why i ain't worried about it honestly the place that i'm renting right now they they they they sent me a they sent me a new lease and they say well your rent is going up if if you don't sign a new lease i say no i'm on month to month a new property management company took over and you know how when something new comes in they try to force you to do something right holy so you know i ignored him i ignored them and then they said hey because you're not responding we're going to put you out i say hey i've been living like this for the past two years on a month-to-month lease why because i'm believing i can move at any time i don't want to be locked up into some kind of unbelief i don't want to be locked up into an agreement that i don't believe in because where we want to be when god tells us to move you got to be free enough to move hallelujah so they kept sending me and sending me and sending me harder all the way up to this morning so you know i emailed customer service this morning and i said please stop mailing me a renewal lease i have chosen to remain month to month hallelujah you know what they said they said well mr diggs if you decide to remain month to month your rent is going to go up 150 bucks i say and so if god's been paying this hallelujah he can pay that [Applause] seek night or tomorrow don't think about how you gonna drink don't think about how you gonna eat don't think about how you gonna survive honey you know my subtitle today my subtitle is he's still jehovah he is still jehovah let's go to exit exodus chapter six hallelujah hallelujah exodus chapter 6. the bible says in verse 1 then the lord said unto moses now shall thou see what i will do to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of this hand of his of his land hallelujah see god allowed all that persecution all that stuff to happen so he could pull moses aside and he said watch what i do to pharaoh he's still the same god hallelujah you know what he said brother man he said watch what i do to your bills watch what i do you know what he said watch what i do with your family hallelujah watch what i do hallelujah he made it that way he put it that way to show you his power if you stay alive everything else has to come behind you don't get discouraged hallelujah if you stay alive holy oh accurate will know that god is here he let pharaoh look so mighty he lets the egyptians look so mighty then he put moses aside he says watch what i do to pharaoh somebody give god some praise listen and god spoke to moses and said unto him i am the law see we got to realize holy we're not serving a buddha we're not serving all out we're not serving some fictitious god we're serving a god who's alive look there's not even bones or dust in his in his in his temple in his gravesite amen because when he rose he took every evidence of death with him [Applause] he took the bones he took the dust he took the stink of that he took it all with him showing that all power in heaven and earth is given unto me i am the that's why the lord says the tomb was empty then they started coming up with foolishness saying all the disciples came and took his body no when he rose he took every evidence of death with him hardly showing that he controls death [Applause] kobe can't do nothing to you it lets god [Applause] i've been vaccinated for 2 000 years [Applause] hallelujah i've been living i've been living under this this this this i've been living under this quarantine hallelujah this vaccination hallelujah for 20 hallelujah plus years in the natural but before the foundation of the world hallelujah i was already vaccinated and what i love about this hallelujah no matter what kind of new disease comes my vaccination is still legal no matter what new disease comes my vaccination doesn't have an expiration date [Applause] [Music] of the holy ghost just stay aligned with the word and satan can't touch you he said as long as eve was behind the word of god satan was powerless she was a female god but once she stepped from behind that word then satan could challenge the law [Music] but as long as you're behind the word he can't challenge the law look police officers don't mess with you if you're not breaking law hallelujah hey man he come a ride up on me hey man i'm doing 55 in 1555 and he rise up on me and he says hey hey give me your license registration i go through the protocols give it to him give him all this and that and he said hey you were speeding i'll quickly say no i wasn't right he said yes she was i said no i wasn't if he wants to go back and forth i'm not talking being arrogant but knowing that i'm innocent if he keeps going back and forth you know what i'll say to him show it to me [Applause] today my subtitle is i seen them do it [Applause] church i seen god do it a friend of mine was driving down the road and the police stopped him because he had a souped-up looking car and he had on the back of it no slow 84. so if it looked like he was pushing everybody but he wasn't police from out of town pulled him over he said he was speeding he said no i wasn't he said yes she was he said show it to me the man said oh i wish i had another police officer here he says but you don't so show it to me what was he doing he was operating in the law amen i'm not talking about all these different movements we got i'm talking about right is right and rogue is wrong there's a truth and there's a lie but listen look right here in exodus the bible says he says and i appeared he's verse two let's go back he says and god speaking to moses and saying unto him i am the lord and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac holy and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known see so church what i'm saying to you today is that we should look for increases of god in our life because right here he's going to do something with moses that he didn't do with abraham they didn't do what isaac that he didn't do with jacob hallelujah what he's going to do now he's going to conduct himself hallelujah as a father amen because jehovah means one who exists with his family and now he's gonna show moses hallelujah that i'm the father over this whole nation and i got everything under control hallelujah he said gather the people and y'all go and they were being led they would go out they made pharaoh chasing them then they got to the red sea but you know what he's still jehovah think about it church what does a father do amen amen we call him jehovah jairo he provides steve well he's showing moses right here every attribute of jehovah i'm feared to express in y'all right amen hallelujah as a provider he gave them food when there was no food as a provider he gave them healing when there was no need for healing right oh church the prophet of god say they traveled for 40 years in the desert without a red cross nobody ever got sick why because he acknowledged himself as jehovah he who exists with his family they couldn't be beat they couldn't be overcome why because he was a banner he was jehovah neeson he was wrong [Applause] hallelujah and you know when they when they got there to that to that red sea amen and it looked like oh moses brought us out here what we gonna do now see he was jehovah right hallelujah he was there existing with his family amen and now he had to do something amen why he had to come to the people to the rescue why because he was jehovah shalom he had to give the people peace because he introduced himself as jehovah so it wasn't their job to figure out how they gonna get through it was god's job think about it harley j if i can use jesse his kids are not worried about how they're going to eat that's his problem why because he's the jehovah of his house hallelujah he's the one existing with his family the kids are not worried about their protection that's his problem hallelujah they're not worried about a roof over their head that's his problem why because god exists with his family amen amen and that's who he was but i want you to understand god will lead you to a certain way just so his attributes can be manifest and even right now god's trying to get things out of us hallelujah that we're not willing to give him that's right right you know what he did he brought them to the red sea because he was trying to get something out of him brought him to the red sea amen and moses moses went back there and he started crying he started oh god what should i do oh god what should i do now mind you before that point moses created frogs moses created lies moses called down fire hallelujah moses was doing all these things that god did supernaturally but now how easily we forget moses should have stepped back and told the children of israel don't worry about this i've seen him do it already but you know what he does he leads them to the red sea just to try to get something out of him that they didn't know they had in him so he tells moses he said stop crying speak to it and move forward moses he didn't say anything to the sea the sea was not the problem what was the problem the enemy chasing him hallelujah so moses tell the egyptians he tells them he tells the israelites stay still see the salvation of the lord for the egyptians whom you've seen you shall see them no more forever and when he said that creation heard god speaking and the sea started rumbling the sea started quaking the sea started shaking they had to get in line with what they had to line up hallelujah the sea had to line up with what moses had spoke in the sea lined up hallelujah the sea got enlightenment hallelujah with the destroying power hallelujah to take care of the egyptians notice he didn't say see he didn't say see i want you to get out of the way he said no the egyptians who you see you should see them no more forever and the only way to destroy them in that moment was that all of them drown so to see heard the law of god speaking and the sea began to react to the voice of god and the sea started rumbling and the sea started shaking and the next thing you know the walls of the seat lifted up boom when you get in your position when you get in your place hallelujah the walls of your troubles will lift up and you can walk right through it church you say brothers how can you ask god to do something like that you know or for a house and you ride in the neighborhood and all this stuff because i seen them do it right some friends of mine they moved to carolina and they were renting a house because the lord was dealing with the father to move early so he obeyed god didn't know where he was moving he moved in a place but the place was really a little too small and his wife started praying she said lord i need something bigger and i want somewhere with it with a lot of space we need to be specific with god that's right that's right cause you're gonna get what you asked for four bedroom three thousand square feet two car garage hallelujah you got to be specific with god hallelujah you say come on brother jeez remind i'ma remind you not i seen him do it right hallelujah if he did it before he can do it again holly so church she started praying hallelujah and then she looked in the paper and she saw a house for rent honey she said so she rolled around harder however she found it may not even be for rent but she was riding around in the neighborhood and she saw a house and you know what she did she started throwing prayers out in the window lord i want that house lord i want that house that's just one thing you got to realize somebody was already staying in that house but if god got something for you and somebody squatting on your land that means they got to get up why because in the bible they had they had jebusites and entities squatting on their promised land but god told them go take the land that i've given you hardly line up with the promise somebody even lied up with the promise all she was doing was riding up with what god had already had for her for the foundation of the world so you know what she's arrived by that hollywood sit in the driveway pray a little bit see the driveway pray a little bit say lord that's my house church i see them do it right sometimes i go down there and visit with them and i ask my friend she like my sister's like where's she at he said man you know she down there praying over the house again she down there riding by the house keep in mind somebody was staying in the house and then church all of a sudden earlier they put the house on the market hallelujah for rent hardly and this is the thing just the thing i want to realize the person that was staying in the house was the owner's son the owners called their son and told him you got the moves it's time for you to move what was happening hallelujah her prayers were being answered by god holman he didn't understand hallelujah there was a family getting lined up with god's promise hallelujah so nothing can stop it amen and the man he wanted to continue to rid the house but they said no we don't want to rent we want to buy this house you can make your body obey your confession you can make your situation do what you wanted to do honey so they told the owner they said no we don't want to wreck we want to buy he said well okay y'all move in let me talk to my wife about it they will stand in another state hardly been standing for a while he went and started talking to his wife about it his wife looked at me in his face and he said she said honey i ain't never moving back to south carolina sell that house [Laughter] let me tell you something god is exceedingly because they didn't know hallelujah there was a certain part cleared off it was cleared off it was about five acres hallelujah but when they bought the house 12 acres came along with [Applause] i see them do it and if god can do that surely three hundred thousand dollars ain't nothing to it i know another brother hallelujah see i'm in testify mode now because i'm believing god's gonna do something you better find your testimony and start reciting it i seen him do it hallelujah church hardly i know of another brother his wife they were about to buy a house and the whole deal fell through and his wife started praying and praying and praying he said some mornings he would wake up and she wouldn't be in the bed she'd be in the other room praying say she did that for two years hardly he said one day he went out to preach his pastor couldn't make it so his pastor told him hey i want you to go preach in my spot hallelujah this was in the in the in the ukraine somewhere so he got there he preached services went well and the brother that he preached for was very wealthy so he told him he said hey uh you got children he said yeah he said they like candy he's like yeah they like candy he said i'ma give you a bag of candy to take back with him he said okay praise god so on his way back he traveled went through the airports all these things he got back home he's very tired his wife in her position hallelujah she started unpacking stuff and she said what's in his bag he's all that's just some candy for the kids she went and started unpacking the bag she came back out she said hey this is not no candy this is a bag of money church it was 350 000. i seen him do it he's still jehovah let me tell you something god's already working on the other end he just wants you to get lined up because this brother hallelujah that invited him to stay he had already said to god he was a millionaire and he said lord holly if you bless me with this next deal hello i'm going to get a tithing to the next minister that come and preach hell yeah now the pastor hallelujah wasn't the one god wanted to bless so the past he got the pastor tied up so the pastor let his evangelist go because he was praying about a house and god knew that this is how he's gonna get his house so god had everything already set up god was aligning everything god was aligning everything god was aligning everything hallelujah and you know what his wife forgot about that house right and she built the house this house had a swimming pool inside of it [Music] i seen him do it church he's still jehovah once you lined up god has no choice but to fulfill his word hey man i know another sister in london hallelujah she's been praying and praying about a job she said she filled out over 100 applications and nobody would hire her she started to pray she said lord all i need is just one opportunity just one opportunity so somebody called the hallelujah and these this was a very high profile job so she started praying and somebody called her she got hardly an interview amen got through the interview but you know how these jobs have tests and different things you got to take hallelujah she said math is not her thing hey man so she had this math quiz to take this math test and by this test is whether you're gonna get your next interview and it's a very exclusive group of people i think it was no more than four people that made it to this level hallelujah and they said out of this four you go to the next level so she was taking his test she looked at the test and she was like and i'm paraphrasing some of the testimony to get to the meet she said she was looking at the test and she was like i don't know none of this stuff she said but i know you god yeah how many ever did this in school i don't know what this is so i'm gonna go a b c d c b d a a b c d c b d e she's ridiculous ain't it but when you got god on your side he can make the impossible possible yeah she looked at that test and you know what she did she just took the answer sheet she didn't even look at the questions and she prayed she said lord i need you to guide my hand she wasn't even looking at the questions she said well okay i believe this one is a i believe this one is c just going by the leadership of god what was she doing she was lining up with faith hallelujah church and she took the whole test like that not looking at any question right not solving any problem she put the whole test in god's hands so when it came back they called her and they told her okay you're going to the next level but then when she got to meeting with the people they told her they said you're the only one that made it to the next level she they said the reason why you're here because your test scores were higher than anybody we ever tested [Applause] worried about a job i've seen him do it i've seen him give jobs i've seen him make jobs that goes to my church hallelujah she she doing the cover she contracted sickness and got sick and she had just started a new job hallelujah and church she got the job she didn't even get a chance to start on the job and she's like oh my goodness i'm gonna lose this job but you know what started to happen in hallelujah she didn't work one day on the job and every day she got a check i should say every week every week payday she got a 40-hour check and didn't work one hour on the job yet all i got to say is won't he do it what did he do in church i said wouldn't do it [Applause] hallelujah church all we have to do is line up with the law of god oh yeah there's a law in the fish hallelujah where you can swim down in the deeps of the ocean hallelujah and come back up again hallelujah there's something in it hallelujah that just allows it to happen that way nothing can stop it a bird can't do that but a fish can that's right it can dive up and go back down harder in this habitat and stay there for hours you know why because there's a law inside of it that it lines up with hollywood it doesn't matter hallelujah when storms come it doesn't change the law you know how hurricane starts it starts out there on the water right between high pressure and low pressure starts to spill and spinning and then it gets stronger and stronger you know what it doesn't change the law within the fish you say boy that hurricane tore up some stuff and that fish say but i'm still swimming church let me read you something and then i'm gonna get out your way but notice one thing about god hardly and you know i had to i had to get on board with us that god would allow things to happen in your life just to make you better right that's what it's all about you know when people will accuse they'll give false accusations and all these things and god has sit back saying it's exactly where i want them i want them exactly right here in this trial a line up spiritually hallelujah you know what church amen there were two brothers who were twins one name of jacob one name of esau hungary but they didn't know hallelujah god had already gave a promise hallelujah that they told uh what was jacob's wife um rachel rebecca mr rachel told rachel hurling you got two nations inside of you hallelujah two nations so he was already spoken of that these two boys are gonna fight right hallelujah so they come out one grab and the other one healed hallelujah and even while she was pregnant she was feeling the birth pains hallelujah why because there was a word spoken that you got two nations inside of you but you know those nations got to a place where they really had to fight amen now it comes down hallelujah that esau was like more like manly like his daddy he was a hunter he when i got venison and all these things he was rugged he was burning but jacob hallelujah seemed to be soft seemed to be a mama's boy but he had to be close to his mama because his mama was aligned with the promise that he can get the birthright [Applause] he didn't know why he was so close to his mama he had to be close to his mama because he couldn't trick his daddy by himself he needed his mama boy but you know what they were getting in line with god's promise and one day he saw went out to hunt holly it was all in god's alignment right holly he went out to hunt and he couldn't find no venison and jacob hardly because he was close to his mama he knew how to cook [Applause] see it's the alignment of god [Music] you know his friends his friends they might have come through the neighborhood and say jacob you going out to play ball today he said no i'm in the kitchen with my mama cooking if i say he ain't number a little boy little boy we out here shooting bowls and shooting guns and shooting arrows and all that stuff and you and they're talking about cooking he was right in line with god's promise right so there's one day hallelujah all that hanging around mama was going to come into play hey man esau said man i'm hungry i'm about to die hallelujah and jacob say smell that you're hungry smell that and you know what i ain't had to go hunt for it i made this in the kitchen you're hungry he's like yeah man i'm about to die he said hey the only way you can eat hardly jacob get in the line he said the only way you can eat if you give me the birthright and he saw not valuing it like jacob value hallelujah he wasn't willing to stay aligned church it was his the birthright was his but he wasn't able to stay in line with the word of god with the promise of god see church we have to stay in line because there are promises that it's yours but when you got it when you get out of line god will give your promise to somebody else that's right oh my hey esau said what good is this burn right to me man i'm about to die i'm hungry and taking whatever man do what you got to do but to get this right here you got to promise me the birthright he says okay man take the birthright jacob goes in there hallelujah started talking to his daddy started talking imitating he saw and all this look his mama hallelujah helped dress him hey man put hairs on his arms just like he saw and everything why didn't that why did once once they found out hallelujah what jacob and his mama did why didn't isaac get rid of them hallelujah hallelujah amen you cannot hardly judge somebody for doing the will of god [Applause] and that was a lesson for jacob hallelujah something that looked like it was wrong he was really right holly cause she was in position hey man and you know church hallelujah we know jacob tricked his father got the birth right esau comes in finds out he's like oh no father do you have a blessing for me he says my son i've given it all right then he saw you know what i'm gonna kill him i'm gonna kill him and jacob said i got to run i got to go hallelujah but you know what's happening god was lining them up again he got down to layman's house hallelujah he he saw a girl named rachel hallelujah and he said man i want to marry this girl hallelujah so he worked seven years hallelujah worked seven years only to get to the chamber and found out it was leah oh my and just like his mama he learned to push through it hallelujah why didn't he why didn't he get rid of her why because she had will in the chamber and saw his mystery whoa she had rid of the bad chain but hallelujah jacob had injected his seed and he couldn't get it back what was happening holly leah was a part of the alignment she had four boys of that promise hallelujah and did you notice rachel was barren she couldn't have no kids so you know what she said i'll give her my hands made she had two babies hallelujah right and then leo says you you gonna play like that i give him my hands man she has some babies hallelujah and now it looks like there's four women fighting over one man no that was the alignment of god hallelujah because it took those four women to bring forth the children of israel hallelujah what was it it was god spiritually enlightening jacob oh my church let me close let me say to you that when it comes to life there's nothing out of order god is in control he has us exactly where he wants us but what we have to learn how to do is to give god praise in all things paul said if our glory our glory the things are suffering and let's look at some of the things he suffered a night and day in the sea that that ain't talking about in a boat that's in the water a night and day hallelujah dog pedaling trying to survive hallelujah bit by viper whip with stripes at least five times stoned and thrown over the wall paul went through all these things and in one place he was in jail and he was cold he said and can y'all bring me a coat and he says if i glory i'll glory the things i suffer why because his sufferings align him with god hallelujah i want you to catch a church without the submarines he would have never lined up and without the alignment hallelujah we would have never got the book of the book of all ephesus we will not have got the book of philippians the book of corinthians first and second thessalonians the book of romans the book of hebrews [Music] it took all that summary to keep paul alive because god said there's an abundance of revelation inside of you what brought it out suffering hallelujah oh my church you know i like to tell young men if you ever get to struggling hardly about your position go read about king david hallelujah because king david didn't have a spotless life hallelujah but he had a life that was worthy to be called a man after god's very own heart hallelujah david had ups david had downs david even committed adultery and premeditated murder but god said he's a man after my very own heart hallelujah and as long as david stayed aligned with god god always gave him mercy what was david alignment his alignment was repentance because no matter what he did david fell on his knees and said lord i have seen father forgive me that's why god hallelujah could step out there and let him kill a lion let him kill a bear then look at goliath and say you're going to be just like that lying in bed why because he was aligned with god's word hallelujah you read about king david david was a man who knew how to wait on god hallelujah david went out to battle one time came back his whole family was gone his wives were gone the children was gold and the whole camp turned their back on david but david knew how to wait on god he said lord shall i sit still or shall i pursue hallelujah you say lord if i see the wind blowing in the marbury trees that's when i'll go and david's sitting still but he's watching those trees because we know god asks us prayer what are you looking at what are you looking at david had a sign pulse and david sodom trees glory david told everybody let's go get what belongs to us that's what you need to tell the devil i'm here to get what belongs to me i want my family back i want my children back i want my health back oh my church in the in in the restoration of the bride tree the prophet of god say we got the right to enforce the law restoration means we got a right for it to be restored back to his original condition that's why when you get sick and you believe the blood of jesus christ you're enforcing the devil to let go that's right that's right amen what he gonna do what are you gonna say he can't say that he can't do it he can't hold on once you proclaim the blood of jesus christ he got to let go hallelujah once you confess the lord jesus christ as your savior you've got to let go but the problem is we forget so often what god has done what i love what david did when he killed goliath david tucked the head right david took the head of the enemy and i can imagine they went to the next battle and they started talking they gnaws and all this and that and david probably stood up in front of everybody and he probably got out there in front of the whole armies of all the different armies of the hittites and and philistines he said hey y'all show y'all want to do this y'all so y'all want to fight me and my army before y'all think about fighting us he pulled the head of the light out and say do you all remember this guy right y'all remember how he how he made havoc all over the world how you make habit from kingdom to kingdom do y'all remember him my god has delivered him into my hands church you need to pull hallelujah your testimonies back out pull your testimonies back out and say look what god has done i've seen them do it remind the devil what god has done in your life oh my church i'm a close look seek ye first the kingdom and all these things are gone the prophet god said you don't have to do nothing special it says and these signs shall follow them that belief church even right now while i'm preaching there are signs behind me everywhere i go there are signs behind me there there are testimonies behind me there are babies to be created hallelujah hallelujah wherever you go hallelujah yeah you've been praying about that amen now it's time to have that baby hallelujah hallelujah if you are online hallelujah ask god but whatever you will honey you thought you thought it was an unspoken request but god knows all things [Music] babies church i've seen god do so many great things this ain't a time to be discouraged church he got us right where he want us you know what makes the the the battle at that at the red sea so powerful god wanted to pull something out of them they didn't even know they had in them so once they got through the sea holly the bible says miriam took a a tambourine hallelujah and she started the dancing what i want you to understand earlier that tambourine was created in bondage so even while she was in bondage she still had a praise hallelujah when she got through the red sea holly another brother saying why did they dance because they look behind them and all of their heartaches all their pain all they distress all their misery oh they start coming all the things that the devil would do was washed up in the sea [Applause] [Music] and they started to dance in hallelujah and the bible says moses sung a new he started a new song why because a new song is a new inspiration and a new song is a new victory come on musicians church don't get tired praise god now was our time yeah amen now it's time for us to see things that we've been praying about hallelujah we're in the season if we can see solomon gomorrah on the earth we ought to be seeing our prayers come to pass solomon gomorrah is here they mean they have they have uh uh uh uh gay month honestly when they run around they perverted the covenant making the rainbow day symbol bunch of liars hallelujah but you know what i don't get mad when i see that that just let me know that god has to answer my prayer because if i see noah's day if i see lot's day hallelujah right here where i'm at god said in that day hallelujah he would restore [Applause] everything that the devil has taken why because it's the law look when a baby cub a lion is born there's a law already in him there's a law inside of him that that little that little roar that you go as a cub that's how it sounds there's a law inside of him that one day that look is going to be heard for five miles [Applause] all he has to do is grow he don't have to do nothing special all he got to do is eat and push out drink and push out and then one day he'll be in the wilderness and he'll go and everybody will see how much he has matured and there'll be there'll be other people in the jungle there'll be other animals in the jungle that grew right up with him but when he was a cub they didn't fear him hallelujah but now he's an adult [Music] they didn't even challenge him just by the sound coming out of his mouth what about you church sometimes satan would dare to challenge you by what's coming out of your mouth speak the spoken word let's stay in line with god and god will continue to do his part hallelujah we have a right to enforce these laws amen because it says seek ye first the kingdom and all these things will follow you [Music] church i haven't been to the doctor with my lifespan at least three times and they kept saying i had diabetes and every time i walked away saying no i don't he said yes she doesn't know i don't yes you do i say no i don't do you understand the word coming out of my mouth now sometimes you have to make a stand and stand on it according to your faith honey you know when covert started hallelujah as a full-time evangelist i couldn't travel i couldn't go nowhere that's how i lived hallelujah i lived off the gospel and you know what i was thinking i was like lord i can't travel can't do nothing but i got to survive i said well you called me to this so it's up to you church and i'm not boasting but i'm talking about the saints of god church i called one brother i mean he was talking about the pandemic and where's that and everything and in the midst of our conversation he said well how things going for you i say honestly i say i'm doing all right he said brother that's a politically correct answer he said me and you sitting on the porch drinking some iced tea i want you to tell me how you really doing i said well brother you know how it is i got bills and all this stuff we just trusting god he said okay that's what i wanted to hear now give me your bank account number right hallelujah i gave him my bank account number church churches sent me two thousand dollars in the mail [Applause] i was talking to another brother within the same span of time he said well hey brother jesus how you doing he said i know it's kind of rough you can't go out in minnesota therefore you know you can't provide and all these things he said uh is everything all right i said well you know we believe in god he said give me your bank account number nine since i gave my bank account number hurry and the next day i had a wire for three thousand dollars [Applause] kobe can't stop god from traveling [Applause] right man me another brother was talking all this around the same thing everything was locking down because i was like brother you all right you good i say hey i said i'm doing pretty good yeah you said i'm gonna send you something anyway he sent me a thousand praise god [Applause] somebody need to hear this church i was at a church preaching and i started talking about hallelujah your faith will put it there right you know abraham abraham was was was was believing god that isaac was the chosen one so you know what he said he said the lord shall provide himself hardly his faith put what he needed right there in that moment church that i was preaching and i started thinking about my debt and all these things this has been a couple months ago i started thinking about you know my debt and all these things and i said lord about ten thousand will get me out of this hallelujah in two weeks somebody sent me ten thousand dollars [Applause] my down payment for my new house is between 12 and 15 000 you think i'm worried about it i seen him do it [Applause] let me tell you what i'm operating let me tell you what i'm lining myself up i'm aligning myself with malachi hallelujah where it says bring the master house first hallelujah and he said hallelujah that you'll be blessed and you say see if i will open the windows of heaven god say prove me those of you who ain't paying your tithes you know you curse that's right but if you are you are aligned with a promise and let me say this i don't have some surplus of money sitting in the bank no everything god sent me allowed to happen these testimonies is what i needed in that moment that's right why because he's jehovah he exists with his family it's up to my father to provide for me and most of the times it comes to sensitive people that i fellowship with hollywood they say brothers i don't know what it is but god just leave me to do this for you i say well let him lead [Applause] all god's trying to do is get that praise out of you that's what the red sea was all about the red sea was about some praise the last she was about some dancing hallelujah and after they went through that red team hallelujah there were two million people on the bank dancing and singing and shouting god trying to get some praise out of you let's pray let's pray lord we love you jesus lord we worship you you're such a great god lord we just thank you for all the great mighty things you've done lord and what you will do [Music] before we know that this word that's been spoken today has to find a resting place and it has to bring forth that which you send it out for and it won't return to you void so lord god as we speak these things lord lord let it fall on good ground and let it bring forth a hundred fold with the blessings of god lord continuously bless this church lord lord provide us needs lord continue this influence go throughout all accurately lord and live those who are following follow him as he follows christ lord god and in their own lives when they choose to pick up this mantle

trying to reach out to lord we pray to you give them the grace to respond know that they don't miss that visitation lord for only you crying out my soul lord even by the way lord [Music] we love you
