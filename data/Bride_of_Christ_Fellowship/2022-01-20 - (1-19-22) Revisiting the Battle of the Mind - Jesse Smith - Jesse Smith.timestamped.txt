[0:07] brother austin and i were trying to hook
[0:08] up today for a bible study but we
[0:10] weren't able to get it
[0:12] because zion was really sick and
[0:13] everything
[0:15] so i thought tonight i'll just preach on
[0:17] his
[0:17] he had a question about the battle of
[0:19] the mind so i i just thought well i'll
[0:21] preach that tonight and hopefully
[0:22] they'll get here if not we got it saved
[0:24] and then you can listen to it tomorrow
[0:25] or whoever gets a chance so it's going
[0:27] to be a little bit of review for some of
[0:29] us
[0:30] but i know i got a lot of young children
[0:32] here and i know they don't uh understand
[0:34] everything right away so they need a few
[0:36] repetitions right to understand things
[0:38] so
[0:39] uh we'll look at that here tonight
[0:40] second corinthians chapter 10
[0:43] verse three
[0:44] second corinthians 10 verse three just
[0:46] revisiting the battle of the mind i just
[0:47] want to revisit this here
[0:49] tonight get it on uh tape here for
[0:51] brother austin and there's a sub topic
[0:53] with complexes but austin a question
[0:55] about complexes so i'm hoping by god's
[0:57] grace we can minister
[1:00] uh in this area here tonight
[1:05] second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3.
[1:14] so i appreciate everybody's patience
[1:15] thanks for all your prayers and support
[1:18] for austin and lena and
[1:20] all the saints
[1:26] you know i emailed that gentleman who
[1:27] was very kind with his love offering
[1:29] this week and
[1:30] emailed me right back and he just said
[1:32] i'm in tears reading about the testimony
[1:34] and
[1:35] uh he said praise jehovah he said jesus
[1:37] is the author of all of it he said god
[1:38] gave me a word of knowledge
[1:41] he said to help those two in the
[1:42] congregation
[1:44] so he's just watching our youtube videos
[1:45] our sermons and he said i just the lord
[1:47] told me to send a certain amount of
[1:49] money to help out that couple he said i
[1:51] didn't know why
[1:52] he said but i just had a word of
[1:54] knowledge knowledge is understanding so
[1:55] i just understood to send them this
[1:57] certain amount of money
[1:59] and uh
[2:00] he said brother jesse he said please
[2:02] just be patient with them he said i
[2:03] remember when i we're not real
[2:05] we'd say dogmatic people you know we're
[2:07] not impatient people how many have the
[2:09] patience of the holy spirit
[2:11] i remember when i got the patience of
[2:12] the holy spirit it's a great anointing
[2:13] praise god before i couldn't be patient
[2:15] with god or i couldn't be patient with
[2:16] my family or could be patient with
[2:18] others but
[2:19] i remember the anointing of god coming
[2:21] upon me and then you realize oh i can be
[2:23] patient i can wait a little longer if i
[2:25] waited this long i can wait a little
[2:27] longer brother graham's example of that
[2:29] was noah
[2:30] if he could wait 120 years how many can
[2:31] wait a couple more weeks or months
[2:33] praise god
[2:34] you can wait a couple years as well so
[2:35] thank god for his anointing
[2:37] and he gives us that
[2:39] ability by the holy spirit so second
[2:41] corinthians 10 verse 3.
[2:51] i'll read verses three and four and then
[2:53] we can all read verse five together why
[2:56] don't we do that i'll read three and
[2:57] four we can all read verse five here
[2:59] tonight
[3:00] for though we walk in the flesh
[3:03] we do not war after the flesh
[3:07] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[3:09] carnal
[3:10] but mighty
[3:12] through god
[3:14] to the pulling down
[3:16] of strongholds so see god's weapons only
[3:18] work when we're using them according to
[3:20] his word
[3:22] in other words his word is only affected
[3:23] when we're letting the holy spirit
[3:24] anoint that word
[3:26] where we obey it and we live it
[3:30] again through the pulling down of
[3:32] strongholds or fortresses verse five
[3:34] let's read that together can we one two
[3:37] three casting down imaginations and
[3:40] every high thing that exalteth itself
[3:44] against the knowledge of god and
[3:46] bringing into captivity every thought to
[3:49] the obedience of christ praise god let's
[3:51] have one more word of prayer if you have
[3:52] any on your heart just make another unto

[5:19] and children get another good lesson and
[5:24] you know there's times in life you just
[5:26] gotta get reviews you know you just
[5:27] gotta hear that again
[5:30] i mean who doesn't benefit from hearing
[5:31] brother brandon preach another sermon
[5:32] now you already heard it but don't you
[5:34] catch something new each time you know
[5:35] that's
[5:36] that's a well-known uh
[5:38] uh
[5:39] that's a well-known word of wisdom that
[5:41] you listen to it again you catch
[5:42] something new in it praise god
[5:45] so hopefully uh this will be a help here
[5:46] tonight
[5:47] by god's grace you know i was
[5:50] thinking about brother austin's question
[5:51] about complexes and i remember i
[5:52] preached a message back in 2014
[5:56] uh
[5:58] and we had had some issues in our home
[5:59] church you know different disagreements
[6:01] you know with uh some families and
[6:03] things and
[6:04] um
[6:06] i looked you know i was looking i was
[6:08] talking with his brother and as i was
[6:09] counseling with his brother in the
[6:10] church
[6:11] uh i started realizing he's got a
[6:13] complex
[6:15] and then when i saw his complex god is
[6:17] my witness then i saw mine
[6:21] and i i didn't even realize it so i was
[6:23] looking at my notes you know from these
[6:25] uh eight years ago right
[6:27] and uh i remember that this idea of
[6:29] complex is that awesome was asking about
[6:31] i was wow this at one time this was a
[6:32] major message i remember preaching this
[6:34] at cam's church brother brooks's church
[6:37] brother jim schumacher's church and
[6:39] some of these thoughts and this message
[6:40] were so powerful
[6:42] i remember praying with brothers just
[6:44] preachers weeping at the altar
[6:47] over uh complexes and i don't know if
[6:49] anybody's gonna come up here tonight
[6:50] like that but i don't always expect that
[6:52] it's it's all god's time and season
[6:54] praise god god works in a season there's
[6:56] times i thought my god's gonna move
[6:58] mightily with this sermon then nobody
[6:59] you know it seemed like nobody moved and
[7:01] that's okay it's god's you know it's
[7:03] god's time there's other times i thought
[7:04] well i don't know how this is gonna work
[7:06] out and then god moves mightily you know
[7:07] and helps people uh brings them to
[7:09] repentance or gives them a healing or a
[7:11] victory or something uh so we never know
[7:14] exactly uh what's going to happen but we
[7:17] know god is in control of what happens
[7:19] and and we can't live our lives
[7:20] wondering you know uh worrying about the
[7:23] future we have to just choose the word
[7:25] of god obey the word of god and god will
[7:27] take care of the results amen
[7:29] so i'm trusting in that here and again i
[7:31] saw this brother had a complex and then
[7:33] i started looking at my life and that's
[7:35] when i told you this before but i had
[7:36] complexes to at least four preachers and
[7:38] maybe might have been more
[7:40] and so every time i would hear that
[7:41] preacher's name and these were my
[7:42] friends these were some of my friends
[7:45] every time i'd hear that preacher's name
[7:46] i'd get jealous
[7:48] or i'd get upset with that brother or
[7:51] i'd have to
[7:52] stop my tongue from saying something bad
[7:54] about that brother and i was a young
[7:55] preacher i was probably my 25 26 27 i
[7:59] was a pretty young preacher that's why
[8:00] the bible says you don't make a a young
[8:02] pr a new convert a preacher right away
[8:05] right you know you wouldn't want to make
[8:06] a novice a preacher
[8:09] uh
[8:09] and so you know i've been preaching at
[8:11] that time probably for you know if this
[8:12] was 2014
[8:14] i'd probably been preaching for
[8:16] well maybe nine or ten years then by
[8:18] yeah ten years probably ten years by
[8:20] that time
[8:21] and i developed all these complexes and
[8:23] and so i remember one by one i either
[8:25] emailed or texted or called the brothers
[8:27] and i confessed my
[8:29] complex to them
[8:31] and they forgave me of course and now
[8:33] we're in you know good fellowship and
[8:36] and i've learned that you know i can uh
[8:38] it's okay to
[8:40] uh it's
[8:41] okay to have questions about people's
[8:43] lives you know it's okay
[8:45] but it's not okay to speak evil about
[8:47] them
[8:48] or think evil about them
[8:51] for example remember paul went to the
[8:52] galatian church and he said do i have to
[8:54] labor do i have to travail again for you
[8:56] to get a new birth
[8:57] he said i stand and doubt of you so
[9:00] because they they were they started in
[9:02] christ but then they brought legalism
[9:03] back into it
[9:04] in other words paul looked at their
[9:06] lives and said
[9:07] do i need to labor with you gentlemen
[9:09] here to get the holy ghost again what
[9:10] happened here you can't get the holy
[9:12] ghost twice in the soul you can only get
[9:13] it once
[9:15] and so there was there was this idea of
[9:18] where as a believer
[9:21] sometimes you have questions about other
[9:23] believers
[9:24] uh but you also want to always say
[9:27] positive things about them you know you
[9:29] always want to say positive things and
[9:30] i've learned that over the years and
[9:32] uh at least in two different situations
[9:34] now with the original brother when in
[9:35] 2014 when i preached this with a brother
[9:37] and sister actually
[9:39] um
[9:41] when i preached this it actually brought
[9:42] the brother up to the altar weeping and
[9:44] crying
[9:46] and i remember he told me afterwards he
[9:47] said i saw the last we were in the
[9:49] message at that point for
[9:52] 12 years he said i remember he said this
[9:54] i saw the last 12 years of my life
[9:56] flashed before my eyes
[9:58] of all the different times i'd heard him
[10:01] or a couple times he misunderstood me i
[10:03] didn't really hurt him
[10:05] but we spent the next month or so
[10:07] meeting every sunday after church
[10:10] he and his wife you know and
[10:11] talking and going through all and
[10:13] emailing back and forth it was a can i
[10:15] say like this it's a very draining
[10:17] process
[10:18] but was it worth it absolutely
[10:21] absolutely so all these questions over
[10:22] the years and i remember uh they'd bring
[10:25] up things from like the very beginning
[10:26] of the church or you know i'd be like
[10:28] well i don't remember that
[10:30] and if i couldn't remember i just say
[10:31] okay if that's how you said it i'm sorry
[10:35] i i i wouldn't think i would ever do
[10:37] that but if i did you forgive me
[10:41] right and then of course i expected them
[10:42] to forgive me as well
[10:44] uh sorry yeah as well and then i would
[10:47] tell them here's the times you hurt me
[10:48] and you don't you know what church each
[10:49] time they said
[10:51] i remember doing that
[10:54] look we can get anointed of the devil
[10:55] and do things and not even know we're
[10:57] doing it not in the soul and not
[10:59] possessed by the devil but by an evil
[11:01] thought
[11:04] so in both cases i remember on both
[11:05] sides both of us were like i don't
[11:07] remember doing that
[11:09] now a couple times i can remember doing
[11:10] it and that's why i said yes that's
[11:12] right i was a little discouraged that
[11:14] day or
[11:15] i was a little bit angry with you i'm
[11:17] sorry about that
[11:20] but uh
[11:21] that's where this sermon actually came
[11:23] out of and then i saw god use it to help
[11:26] you know numerous churches
[11:29] and then you know of course as you study
[11:30] yeah
[11:33] remember brother bran talked about a
[11:34] complex and he said how many here in
[11:36] brenham tabernacle have a complex he
[11:37] said my look almost every hands up
[11:40] now there's two thoughts on that it's
[11:42] like wow either uh these people are not
[11:44] getting they're not really working out
[11:46] their complexes
[11:48] or
[11:49] brother ram asked you know and they
[11:51] should have they should have taken care
[11:52] of the complex how we know we shouldn't
[11:53] we shouldn't live with the complex right
[11:56] right we shouldn't live with it so
[11:57] either they were being disobedient and
[11:59] uh
[12:00] hadn't confessed it or the other idea is
[12:03] they just recently got a complex
[12:07] right and they
[12:08] they now were real now they were
[12:10] receiving the present word of god and
[12:12] they're being instructed it's now time
[12:14] to take care of that by the grace of god
[12:17] so see either one
[12:19] uh could have uh been a real source here
[12:23] of the trouble it could have been well i
[12:24] should have dealt with this years ago
[12:27] and uh or
[12:28] or this is something new and i got to
[12:30] take care of this but either way church
[12:31] we got to take care of the complexes
[12:33] we've got to take care of the
[12:35] the hard feelings we're going to take
[12:36] care of those things now now what was
[12:39] interesting is
[12:42] you know uh like with the brother both
[12:43] of us had different kind of
[12:44] personalities i'm like a happy-go-lucky
[12:46] kind of person normally you know so if
[12:48] somebody offends me sometimes i'll just
[12:50] let it go i forget about it but yet it
[12:51] stays there right
[12:53] the fact that somebody hurt me it stays
[12:55] there and i don't i don't act as loving
[12:57] to the person right
[12:58] but the other guy was he's like uh
[13:01] kind of
[13:03] different he wasn't like happy-go-lucky
[13:04] he's just a quiet person but over the
[13:06] course of the years because he kept
[13:08] those complexes in he got even more
[13:09] quiet even more cold even more
[13:11] emotionless well you still see me
[13:13] emotionally smile happy how you doing
[13:15] brother
[13:16] god bless you
[13:18] but the other brother didn't have that
[13:19] same type of personality so we came to
[13:21] knew over time something's wrong
[13:24] right and that's why i preached it
[13:26] because i've seen all these scriptures
[13:27] and i heard all these quotes coming
[13:28] together brought together
[13:32] and preached it and then i saw it set
[13:33] the captive free
[13:36] and that's what christ came to do
[13:38] now we weren't captive in physical
[13:40] chains right but we're kept sometimes in
[13:42] spiritual chains
[13:45] like we sing that song on sunday uh i'm
[13:47] no stranger to remember oh yeah brother
[13:49] ben saying it all my hope is in jesus
[13:51] that song says i'm no stranger to a
[13:53] prison
[13:54] i've known shackles and chains now only
[13:56] a few people we know could even sing
[13:57] that as far as natural
[14:00] right people that have been in prison
[14:01] but if you've ever been a slave to sin
[14:04] or you've been a sinner which every hand
[14:06] should go up at that point right then
[14:08] you know what it's like to be a prisoner
[14:09] because you're a constant addict or a
[14:12] sin addict and you just don't get over
[14:14] it right
[14:17] but it's a beautiful song but jesus
[14:19] comes along and he shows you you don't
[14:21] have to be in those chains anymore he
[14:24] pays your debt
[14:26] and he's your judge he's your lawyer
[14:28] he's your advocate and he calls you
[14:31] forgiven and he forgives you as though
[14:33] you never did it in the first place
[14:34] praise god
[14:36] he gives you his righteousness but you
[14:38] know you did do it in the first place
[14:40] right
[14:41] you know your human mind chose to do
[14:43] that or your flesh you gave into your
[14:44] flesh you chose to do that now but then
[14:47] you realize my soul never did it the
[14:49] anointing of god the the gene seed of
[14:51] god that represents me the gene seed
[14:54] never did it but my flesh did it
[14:57] and i'm not going to choose uh to live
[14:59] from my mind and rem and i'm not going
[15:01] to choose to condemn myself from my my
[15:04] past i'm going to choose to walk free
[15:06] because i have a gene seed of god and i
[15:08] come from the mind of god amen
[15:10] i'm not going to choose to remember my
[15:12] earthly
[15:13] background i'm going to choose to
[15:14] remember my heavenly background
[15:17] hallelujah praise god
[15:21] and so we live in uh we live in a a time
[15:24] where things are complex how many know
[15:26] brother adam said we live in a complex
[15:28] age so listen church we battle complexes
[15:31] constantly yet we live in a complex age
[15:36] or a difficult
[15:38] age a very intricate age now church
[15:41] where we gotta we gotta watch our every
[15:43] step every day
[15:45] we have to take uh we have to uh take
[15:47] account of our lives every single day
[15:51] you gotta really consider what did i
[15:52] watch and listen to today
[15:55] what did i say today
[15:58] you have to take that consideration
[15:59] because it's influencing whether or not
[16:01] you're winning the battle of your mind
[16:04] this is a complex age i wrote down
[16:06] numerous things here that tell you it's
[16:08] complex
[16:09] but random said remember we have three
[16:11] pressures
[16:12] riches
[16:14] soft living and nervousness
[16:18] you and i in our minds are battling
[16:20] those three things other words your
[16:21] human mind is saying get rich you need
[16:24] to get rich you need more money you need
[16:26] more money right it's a constant
[16:28] pressure the other pressure is
[16:31] your life is too hard you need to ease
[16:32] your life make your life easier make
[16:34] your life easier right and are all these
[16:36] things true no they're not true
[16:39] and the third thing is
[16:41] there's pressure there's pressure
[16:43] there's pressure
[16:44] you should be stressed about this you
[16:45] should worry about this you need to care
[16:47] more about this you need to worry about
[16:48] this and so it's a complex age
[16:52] where these three spirits are trying to
[16:55] constantly battle us
[16:58] and not only not only on top of that the
[17:01] bible says there's a lack of love jesus
[17:03] said the love of many shall wax cold
[17:08] so not only are these pressures trying
[17:09] to get on us we look at other people
[17:11] most people are cold
[17:14] right most people are living in iniquity
[17:17] and because of that their lives are cold
[17:20] so you look around you're having my
[17:21] battles you're just like i just want
[17:22] somebody to love me but there's very few
[17:24] people that are even
[17:29] you just wanted from somebody
[17:33] but the very few people that actually
[17:34] love people god bless you
[17:37] good to see you there's your guitar
[17:38] brother
[17:39] amen
[17:41] see it's another gift in the house of
[17:42] the lord
[17:46] so this is a complex age
[17:50] where we have constant battles on our
[17:52] mind
[17:53] and yet we're looking for love from
[17:55] other people but there's very few people
[17:56] to love us
[18:00] and then there's this is the age of the
[18:02] days of lot and sodom and noah all
[18:04] rolled into one so everywhere we look
[18:06] outside the church there's violence
[18:09] there's homosexuality there's uh
[18:12] there's pleasures of food uh remember
[18:15] the bible said eat drink and be merry
[18:17] right so that's all the world wants they
[18:18] want to eat drink and have a happy uh
[18:21] foolish life joking life they just want
[18:23] jokes all the time
[18:25] these are the pressures trying to
[18:26] squeeze their way into our minds
[18:30] paul said deceivers wax worse and worse
[18:32] so that means there's more deceivers
[18:34] trying to deceive you and get your mind
[18:37] off the things of god
[18:39] or make you think that you're thinking
[18:40] right about god when you're actually
[18:42] thinking the wrong thought about god
[18:44] or like god wants you to be rich
[18:47] or god wants you to have an easier life
[18:51] when god may be saying well i need to
[18:52] take them through some trials so they
[18:54] can obey me better right
[19:00] but these are all complex things and bro
[19:02] that's what we're looking at tonight
[19:02] we're going to kind of do a bible study
[19:04] what we would have done yesterday okay
[19:06] we look at uh we're revisiting the
[19:08] battle of the mind okay
[19:13] so we have the greatest deception there
[19:15] ever was at this time
[19:17] plus we have the days of noah violence
[19:19] eating drinking
[19:20] jokes
[19:22] we have the homosexuality the days of
[19:24] sodom and gomorrah rampant homosexuality
[19:26] sexual sin
[19:29] we have very few people that even love
[19:31] us or love god right
[19:34] and then we have all these pressures
[19:35] trying to get into us god have mercy our
[19:38] only hope is jesus christ amen
[19:41] in this complex age and with all of our
[19:43] complexes in our minds our only hope is
[19:46] a savior who will set us free from our
[19:48] complexes amen
[19:51] because our soul our soul if it's filled
[19:53] with the holy ghost that's wonderful
[19:55] but we're still got to live up here in
[19:58] the mind
[19:59] we're still going to make active
[20:00] decisions in our mind and we still got a
[20:02] body to deal with it wants things right
[20:05] it wants food it wants uh lust of the
[20:07] eyes lust of the flesh it wants things
[20:10] and the mind the mob of the bible said
[20:12] the desires of the mind the mind has
[20:14] desires too
[20:15] it wants to imagine things of the world
[20:17] wants to do all these things
[20:20] so it's a very difficult age to live in
[20:23] but god would never send a soldier into
[20:25] a battle unless he fully prepared him
[20:28] with the right weapons and defenses and
[20:30] protection praise god
[20:32] and god sent us into this last age in
[20:35] satan's eden praise god with a sharp
[20:37] sword of his word that can defeat any
[20:40] enemy any time any place anywhere and
[20:43] you've got your hand on it you just got
[20:45] to grab it and you just got to use it
[20:48] amen
[20:50] hallelujah
[20:52] now
[20:53] let's review here
[20:55] so you have these three
[20:56] parts to you
[20:58] the bible says god is trying to sanctify
[21:01] all of you so god's kind of trying to
[21:04] keep your body sanctified so you don't
[21:05] give in to the desires of the flesh the
[21:08] flesh wants to smoke like i used to or
[21:10] drink you got to stop that you got to be
[21:13] a sanctified body right or sexual sin
[21:17] also you got to sanctify your mind
[21:20] your mind has to be sanctified and
[21:22] cleaned out and set apart in other words
[21:24] you can't think constantly about evil
[21:27] things your mind has to be dedicated to
[21:29] god amen god has to be your first
[21:32] thought god has to be your next thought
[21:34] god has to be your every thought praise
[21:36] god
[21:38] and then your soul needs to be filled
[21:40] with the life of god so that when you
[21:42] when you're in your
[21:43] the hardest battles and all and
[21:46] everything else seems like it's going
[21:47] crazy you can you can be still and know
[21:50] that god is in you amen
[21:52] and you can listen for the voice of the
[21:54] holy spirit praise god
[21:56] that's right church that's right now
[21:58] let's review real quick now don't notice
[22:00] the body's not on here right now i'm
[22:02] just looking at the mind and the spirit
[22:03] okay
[22:05] now what happens with the complex is
[22:06] satan injects
[22:08] an evil thought in there
[22:10] and then he builds up a fortress to
[22:13] fight against something that's good
[22:16] for example like with that brother and i
[22:19] um
[22:20] i was talking about earlier i think
[22:22] there was one complex he had against me
[22:23] because we were having a minister's
[22:24] meeting one time and i think it was i
[22:27] wouldn't share my notes with him
[22:30] and i admit i was wrong i should have
[22:32] but part of me my human thought was like
[22:34] well why don't he just study it himself
[22:36] do i have to do all the studying for
[22:37] that other brother
[22:40] the bible says study yourself approved
[22:43] to see how i had a mind battle
[22:45] and so i let that build up so every time
[22:47] that brother asked me for quotes i was
[22:49] like
[22:50] the enemy would shoot out and
[22:52] well the enemy actually shot out and
[22:53] said no i'm not going to give you this
[22:54] one you study it out
[22:57] and so he felt
[22:58] he was a younger minister than me i've
[23:00] been preaching longer so he felt that i
[23:02] was fighting against him
[23:04] and so we had to talk about that
[23:06] and i'd apologize now there is a thing
[23:08] there is a truth to that you have to
[23:09] study yourself approved
[23:11] right but at that moment i should i
[23:14] should have just shared it
[23:16] but that whole time before we talked
[23:18] about it i always had this hurtful
[23:19] feeling toward him
[23:22] and uh
[23:24] it wasn't right
[23:25] it's a complex the enemy built up a
[23:27] fortress against that brother in my mind
[23:31] so i didn't want to get an email from
[23:33] him i didn't want to get a text from him
[23:34] because i had a complex against him
[23:37] okay does that make sense
[23:40] the bible said don't give place to the
[23:41] devil where in your mind
[23:44] anybody whether you're holy ghost filled
[23:46] or not anybody can give satan a place in
[23:48] your mind
[23:50] so our battle is to not give satan any
[23:53] place in our body mind or soul praise
[23:55] god
[23:56] hallelujah
[23:58] now and then we learn brother austin and
[24:00] lena that you have five parts to your
[24:02] mind
[24:03] your mind works in five ways in other
[24:05] words you have an imagination right we
[24:07] can imagine what it's gonna be like when
[24:08] the weather is warmer again hallelujah
[24:11] how does william feel right now over
[24:13] there in ghana
[24:15] you have affection which is your
[24:17] emotions
[24:19] right
[24:20] that's part of your human spirit like
[24:22] when we were crying last week because
[24:23] you got the victory buddy
[24:26] it just overwhelmed our affections like
[24:28] our affections wasn't set on money it
[24:30] was on the fact that jesus christ loves
[24:31] you
[24:33] right and that overwhelmed us so we
[24:35] start crying and praising the lord and
[24:37] worshiping god and pounding on the
[24:39] pulpit and everything like that you just
[24:40] you get happy amen
[24:42] then you have reasoning right and
[24:44] reasoning is your reasons for decisions
[24:48] well
[24:49] i'm gonna do this because of that
[24:51] i think i'm gonna
[24:53] i think i'm gonna uh
[24:56] do this i think i'll go there so i can
[24:58] buy that get that and i'll go back i
[25:00] think i'll like remember like brother
[25:01] man said
[25:02] the reasoning is well remember from
[25:04] james i'm going to go move there and
[25:05] make so much money right but the bible
[25:08] said don't say that don't plan on making
[25:10] the money say if the lord willing i'll
[25:11] make the money
[25:13] but reasoning as well it's kind of like
[25:15] a lot well i'll move to sodom and
[25:17] gomorrah because i have a easier life
[25:19] there
[25:20] there's water there
[25:22] there's big business there but that was
[25:24] the wrong reasoning he should have said
[25:26] where can my family serve god better
[25:28] amen hallelujah my family can serve
[25:30] better hanging around abraham god's
[25:33] prophet amen
[25:35] hallelujah i don't want my family
[25:37] hanging around homosexuals in other
[25:38] words
[25:40] i want my family hanging around godly
[25:41] people like abraham and sarah and there
[25:44] are 300 servants praise god i want my
[25:46] family around saints because whoever you
[25:49] hang around with that's who you're going
[25:50] to turn into
[25:53] memory is one we can all remember we've
[25:55] where we've been hurt in the past how
[25:56] many remember being hurt in the past
[25:57] ever
[25:59] we've got a choice we can either let
[26:01] that memory stay there and i said i'm
[26:02] going to be against my dad or i'm going
[26:04] to be against my mom
[26:06] because my dad left my mom i'm going to
[26:07] be against my dad and every time i hear
[26:09] his name i don't want to see him i don't
[26:11] want to talk to him
[26:12] right i got a choice i can either build
[26:14] up a complex or i can forgive him and
[26:16] say father forgive him he doesn't know
[26:18] what he's doing
[26:22] right and then the other the last part
[26:25] is the conscience
[26:27] and that's called the stoplight it's
[26:29] called the stoplight of your mind
[26:32] right so when you want to go let's say
[26:34] you want to let's say you want to skip
[26:35] church right and the devil's saying hey
[26:38] go and skip church but there's a red
[26:39] light saying no turn around go to church
[26:43] my conscience tells me i need to but you
[26:44] fly through the red light anyway when
[26:46] you could have done a u-turn and gone
[26:48] right back to church
[26:49] right that's a conscience well i know
[26:52] that's right so i should do it it's a
[26:54] light there to tell you
[26:55] stop go back or go this is the will of
[26:57] god right it's that stoplight that tells
[26:59] you what to do
[27:01] okay now
[27:03] i'm gonna stay back on this i'm just
[27:05] gonna use this
[27:06] now give me uh let's see let me take a
[27:08] half hour here i'll just try to hit the
[27:09] highlights on these scriptures
[27:13] um
[27:14] if you would get your bibles here let's
[27:15] have some readers here uh let's start
[27:17] with my oldest can you hon
[27:19] okay
[27:21] proverbs 23 he said remember return
[27:23] there proverbs 23 7.
[27:26] then we'll just hit some uh scriptures
[27:28] here i'll just try to keep it brief and
[27:30] then but austin we can talk more about
[27:31] it and it's a great topic brother uh
[27:33] it's a great topic i preached numerous
[27:35] times on the complexes and
[27:38] you know the mind we we just went over
[27:39] that before you guys got here in
[27:41] december and november we went over the
[27:42] mind again with all the children
[27:44] remember you guys come up with all those
[27:45] good examples i know maokai was shooting
[27:47] out all these good examples and all the
[27:49] girls you know you're doing a great job
[27:50] giving me examples of saints with mind
[27:52] battles
[27:53] did a great job
[27:55] proverbs 23 7. liddy when you got it can
[27:58] you read it
[28:07] all right
[28:08] so the bible says as a man thinks in his
[28:11] heart so is he
[28:14] okay so whatever you meditate on on
[28:17] think and think on that's what you are
[28:21] right so the the best example is i'm
[28:23] weak
[28:24] or i'm discouraged
[28:27] and the church
[28:28] said like all day you're thinking i'm so
[28:31] discouraged
[28:34] i'm such a weak christian i'm such a
[28:36] failure
[28:38] who told you that was that god that said
[28:40] that
[28:42] god doesn't call you a weak
[28:45] a wimp god calls you more than a
[28:47] conqueror
[28:49] i mean
[28:50] if you think you're weak if you think
[28:52] you're nothing if you think you're
[28:53] useless that's how you're going to act
[28:56] as a man or woman thinks in his or her
[28:59] heart so is he or she
[29:02] wherever you think you are that's what
[29:04] you are
[29:05] i'm jesse i'm loving the lord
[29:08] that's who i am amen that's my idea
[29:11] that's what john said i'm john i'm the
[29:13] disciple of jesus loved amen
[29:16] that's who i am
[29:18] that's your identity
[29:22] you're the one
[29:23] who god emptied out heaven for amen
[29:28] i shouldn't say empty not but he sent
[29:29] his son praise god
[29:32] he sent his son from heaven he created a
[29:34] body of jesus he sent his son filled his
[29:37] son with his holy spirit
[29:39] and then had his son's sacrifice for you
[29:42] praise god he thought so much of you he
[29:44] gave you a lamb to die for you praise
[29:47] god
[29:48] nobody else has done that for you
[29:50] satan's trying to kill you and destroy
[29:52] you but god's trying to save you empower
[29:54] you and exalt you to heaven praise god
[29:57] amen
[29:59] glory
[30:02] you are the purchase
[30:04] price of jesus's blood in other words
[30:06] jesus blood was worth whatever it paid
[30:08] for what it paid for your love
[30:11] your soul praise god hallelujah
[30:14] you are the purchase of jesus's blood
[30:17] hallelujah so your value
[30:20] is above measure amen your values above
[30:24] rubies amen like i said about the woman
[30:25] amen
[30:26] a proverbs 31 woman
[30:29] she's more valuable than far above
[30:31] rubies praise god she's worth millions
[30:33] and billions of dollars any real man
[30:36] who's married to a godly woman knows the
[30:37] value of a godly wife
[30:40] she's she's her value is in in
[30:43] immeasurable
[30:44] incalculable praise god
[30:46] because of all that she does
[30:49] over humility
[30:52] and the bible says that god for me my
[30:55] mother's womb and this is let's look
[30:57] look at your hands for a minute this is
[30:58] a pretty good job
[31:01] god did a pretty good job on your body
[31:02] praise god all of you walked in here
[31:04] nobody was packed in here on a
[31:05] wheelchair
[31:07] right god did a really good job
[31:10] and he said you're fearfully and
[31:12] wonderfully made praise god
[31:14] those are god's thoughts
[31:16] and god's thoughts are the best thoughts
[31:18] amen
[31:20] god thought so much of you he sent his
[31:22] son
[31:24] to die for you and he allowed the word
[31:26] of god somehow to reach its way into
[31:28] akron at a burger king to come to you
[31:31] praise god
[31:33] or he sent brother branham like your dad
[31:35] told me all the way to ghana
[31:37] just to be at the airport and brother
[31:38] and prayed made the message go forth in
[31:40] ghana and then god sent that message all
[31:42] the way down to your hometown sister
[31:45] amen
[31:46] god thought so much of you amen
[31:50] this is god's thoughts
[31:54] and the bible says god's thoughts are
[31:56] the greatest thoughts god's thoughts are
[31:57] the highest thoughts
[31:59] there's no thoughts higher than god's
[32:01] thoughts hallelujah
[32:03] no thoughts greater than god's thoughts
[32:07] now let's move on here
[32:10] as a man thinks so is he so you have to
[32:13] think all day about god
[32:15] now i know there's times you got to take
[32:16] a break when you're working but let's
[32:18] say this lord i'm having trouble on the
[32:19] job lord help me to solve this problem
[32:22] on the job that's what you need to do
[32:24] lord i got a problem i got a little

[32:40] many times i had a lot of all-nighters
[32:43] well not all all-nighters but i had a
[32:44] lot of late-nighters writing 30-page
[32:46] papers
[32:48] instead of tests when i became a
[32:50] master's degree i had to do papers and i
[32:52] was writing all the time i say lord i
[32:54] have no words for this computer but
[32:56] somehow they always came
[32:58] because i say god help me we don't shut
[33:00] out god said well god you can't help me
[33:02] no god wants to help you praise god keep
[33:04] thinking about god say god you can help
[33:06] me write this paper i always pray like
[33:08] this lord you can help me remember
[33:09] everything that i learned and studied i
[33:11] forgot it all but you can bring it back
[33:13] to me and don't you know god did that
[33:15] amen
[33:16] he always does that praise god because
[33:18] he's faithful
[33:20] as a man thinks in his heart so is he
[33:26] now i want to just look at here let's
[33:27] look at a few uh
[33:30] so what happens with a complex uh
[33:32] brother austin will you read proverbs 18
[33:34] 14. everybody can turn there proverbs 18
[33:37] 14. what happens when a complex occurs
[33:40] how does it start it usually starts like
[33:42] this
[33:46] it usually starts
[33:47] through affection
[33:50] go to brother austin when you're ready
[33:51] uh uh proverbs 18 14.
[33:57] the spirit of a man will sustain in his
[34:00] firm infirmity but a wounded spirit who
[34:03] can bear it very good
[34:05] so what happens you get wounded somebody
[34:07] said this austin somebody hurt your
[34:08] feelings
[34:11] or somebody did something last week and
[34:12] then the next day you remember oh
[34:14] they said that about me
[34:16] they put that on youtube about me i get
[34:19] it every time i get it a lot
[34:21] every time i oh there's another one i
[34:23] was in that one oh well praise god
[34:26] point out all my heirs and all my
[34:28] differences you know
[34:29] that's okay i still love those guys
[34:32] hallelujah if you're watching now spies
[34:34] i love you i'm praying for you hope you
[34:35] get saved by god's grace come talk to me
[34:38] come talk to me personally if you have
[34:39] something against me please don't go
[34:40] share with somebody else you come talk
[34:41] to me that's what jesus said did he not
[34:44] that's what jesus said somebody offends
[34:45] you go talk to them themselves
[34:50] but see you get wounded so somehow your
[34:52] feelings get hurt
[34:54] and then if you don't
[34:56] if you don't let god heal that it's
[34:58] going to keep hurting
[35:02] i'll never forget that i felt really bad
[35:03] as a dad one time genevieve got burned
[35:06] and i put a band-aid on it right away
[35:08] without
[35:09] yeah yeah listen
[35:11] we got some doctors in here
[35:13] and i forgot to put salve on it or
[35:16] whatever it was
[35:17] and that band-aid stood on there
[35:20] it was
[35:21] on there for like a week maybe two
[35:23] and it was so painful
[35:26] and that was another one of my dad fails
[35:28] just like that broken arm back there
[35:29] that's another dad fail but that was on
[35:31] accident
[35:32] i was just trying to help zion and
[35:34] uh genevieve i love you honey that was
[35:36] daddy's fault
[35:38] but yeah
[35:40] i need god's grace as a dad that's all i
[35:42] can say
[35:43] i really need god's grace i'm not
[35:45] perfect
[35:47] but that's a wound right it's a wound
[35:49] and if it's not taken care of properly
[35:51] it becomes a long-term problem
[35:55] a church that's a natural thing now what
[35:57] about
[35:58] spiritual
[36:00] what about always building up our
[36:01] children
[36:03] loving our children forgiving our
[36:04] children
[36:05] and saying the right things to our
[36:07] children
[36:09] if i had a choice now
[36:10] i'd rather
[36:12] make a mistake hurting the physical
[36:14] aspect of my child than the natural
[36:17] but do i ever desire to hurt anybody no
[36:20] but i'm a human
[36:21] and we have to go through mistakes we
[36:23] have to learn from our mistakes we have
[36:24] to suffer in order to learn mistakes i
[36:26] hope everybody understands me tonight
[36:27] here i never hurt anybody ever but if i
[36:30] had a choice
[36:31] i'd say lord let it be in the natural
[36:33] and not the spiritual
[36:35] because i want their spirits i don't
[36:37] want them to have wounded spirits
[36:39] i want them to when they see me to love
[36:41] me
[36:42] not to want to run away from me i don't
[36:44] want to be around dead i want them to
[36:46] run to me when i walk in the door i want
[36:47] to see jen run to me
[36:49] and zion like i want to get well too you
[36:51] know they used to run to me you know
[36:53] i want it i want their spirits to be
[36:55] strengthened with the holy spirit with
[36:57] god's love amen
[37:01] so what happens
[37:02] someone wounds us now we know it's the
[37:04] devil it's not the person it's the devil
[37:06] working on that person
[37:08] right then if we're not careful that
[37:10] memory will come up
[37:12] if we don't if we don't let that heal
[37:14] satan's going to take that wound and
[37:16] he's going to build up and well oh they
[37:18] did this but guess what remember last
[37:19] year they did that oh remember remember
[37:21] five years ago when they did that and
[37:24] pretty soon he has to build up this all
[37:26] these hard hard feelings you have such a
[37:28] case against this person to be angry
[37:30] with them but no you don't you have to
[37:32] remember the blood of jesus christ comes
[37:34] to forgive all their diseases right i'm
[37:36] sure all their iniquities all their sins
[37:38] the blood of jesus comes to offer
[37:39] forgiveness
[37:41] that's right
[37:43] go to hebrews 12
[37:44] hebrews 12 14 maybe lena you could read
[37:46] this one hebrews 12 14 take your time
[37:48] it's the back of the bible back of the
[37:50] bible
[37:52] hebrews and james so it's towards the
[37:53] back
[37:55] hebrews 12 14 and 15.
[38:02] so the enemy comes in he tries to wound
[38:05] you
[38:06] but church i just pray the holy spirit
[38:08] when we have hurt feelings i just pray
[38:10] the holy spirit would come near to us
[38:12] and remind us
[38:13] it wasn't them it was the devil
[38:17] trying to
[38:18] hurt us
[38:20] and that we will say our prayer
[38:21] forgiveness father forgive them
[38:24] and now many times that will that will
[38:26] that will make everything okay but
[38:28] church there are some hurts that are so
[38:29] hurtful you have to go talk to the
[38:30] person or you're not going to feel
[38:33] you're not going to feel deliverance
[38:35] you're not going to feel victory
[38:37] until you go talk to the person face to
[38:39] face and then all that pressure goes
[38:41] away
[38:42] i know what i'm talking about
[38:46] with 15 years of pastor and 17 years of
[38:48] preaching there's been times i've hurt
[38:50] people's feelings or they've really just
[38:52] not really liked me
[38:53] but as soon as we talk about it i feel
[38:55] like a brand new person the weights off
[38:57] my shoulders i feel happy again because
[39:00] i'm not holding in this
[39:02] wound i'm letting the holy spirit heal
[39:04] it right
[39:06] i'm i'm setting the person free from
[39:08] hurting me
[39:10] right like jesus daily prayers father
[39:14] father uh forgive me of my debts as i
[39:16] forgive them who are indebted to me
[39:19] i don't think like austin owes me
[39:21] because he hurt me or malachi owes me
[39:23] because he hurt me i can i can let them
[39:25] be i can let i can let their debt be
[39:27] paid and jesus forgives them jesus loves
[39:29] him
[39:30] i can let go of that pain
[39:32] all right so sister lena could you read
[39:34] verses 14 and 15 please
[39:58] great thank you so now we get another
[40:01] picture so a complex can either be like
[40:03] a stronghold
[40:05] or it can be like a root or like a weed
[40:08] okay like a weed so this is either can
[40:10] be like a weed or a castle fortress
[40:14] satan's either trying to get a weed to
[40:15] grow up and what does a weed do it takes
[40:17] up precious space and precious minerals
[40:20] right that same ground could be used to
[40:22] bring forth fruit
[40:24] that same ground could be a blessing
[40:26] but instead it's a waste
[40:29] right
[40:30] we don't want to waste our lives we want
[40:32] our lives to be productive for the glory
[40:34] of god we don't want to waste our
[40:36] thoughts we want our thoughts to have a
[40:38] a benefit we want to see the fruits of
[40:41] good thoughts praise god and we see that
[40:43] through the words of our mouth praise
[40:45] god because our mouth
[40:47] reveals what's in our heart
[40:50] okay
[40:51] your mouth reveals what's in your heart
[40:53] let me let's go to the book of matthew
[40:54] jesus said that matthew
[40:58] i will get it in just a moment
[41:01] yeah matthew
[41:03] 12 34 yeah
[41:06] matthew 12 34 and malachi when you're
[41:08] ready you can read that matthew 12 34.
[41:16] in other words your mouth will always
[41:18] say what you're thinking about
[41:21] as a man as a woman thinks in their
[41:24] heart that's what they are
[41:26] they're currently weak if they're
[41:28] they're currently discouraged if they're
[41:29] saying i'm discouraged i'm discouraged
[41:30] then they're currently discouraged
[41:33] they're saying i'm condemned and god
[41:34] don't love me then they're currently
[41:36] condemned temporarily but not eternally
[41:38] amen praise god amen temporarily
[41:43] right because remember paul was to be
[41:45] blamed paul was to be condemned
[41:47] temporarily because he wouldn't eat with
[41:48] the gentiles but peter
[41:50] i'm sorry yeah peter was to be rebuked
[41:53] but paul corrected him and they both and
[41:55] peter got the victory by god's grace
[41:57] all right so uh mal i'm sorry malachi
[42:00] read matthew 12 34 please
[42:11] all right
[42:12] so that proves whatever comes out of
[42:14] your mouth that shows what you're
[42:15] thinking
[42:17] and the real secret to victory is
[42:20] rejecting the evil thoughts thinking the
[42:24] right thoughts and then making your mind
[42:26] and mouth say the right words
[42:29] praise god
[42:30] because every word starts as a thought
[42:32] right
[42:33] thought word action
[42:36] right i'm gonna go read my bible i'm
[42:38] gonna i'm gonna go pray well it starts
[42:40] as a thought then you speak it and then
[42:42] you do it praise god in church you have
[42:44] a 40 better chance of doing it if you
[42:47] write it down there's something about
[42:48] getting your
[42:49] something about prophesying
[42:51] with your words
[42:53] you are almost
[42:55] 50 percent more likely to do it if you
[42:57] write it down
[42:59] that's why i write down my goals for
[43:00] every day
[43:01] right but i don't write it down anymore
[43:02] but read my bible because i always do it
[43:05] it's a part of me
[43:07] i know my day hasn't got started unless
[43:09] i read my bible and i don't want the day
[43:11] to start unless i read my bible praise
[43:13] god amen
[43:16] you have to write it down
[43:18] speak it
[43:19] think it speak it act on it
[43:22] amen
[43:23] i'm gonna say i'm gonna get up at seven
[43:25] or i'm gonna get eight and i'm gonna
[43:26] read my bible right away you gotta speak
[43:28] it
[43:30] we'll see it's so important that you
[43:32] write it down speak it and then you'll
[43:34] act upon it praise god out of the
[43:36] abundance of your heart the mouth speaks
[43:38] praise god so speak whatever's in your
[43:40] heart if it's in your heart and it's
[43:41] god's will it's going to happen praise
[43:43] god
[43:44] so speak it anyway the devils won't stop
[43:47] it but god will bring his word to pass
[43:49] and you'll be the beneficiary of it
[43:54] thank god amen
[43:56] now go to ezekiel 36 here
[44:04] ezekiel 36
[44:06] 26
[44:09] now i want to show the three works of
[44:10] grace here what the bible calls it
[44:15] the bible also calls it
[44:18] new heart is justification
[44:20] new spirit is sanctification
[44:23] and my spirit is the baptism of the holy
[44:25] ghost now we just had two recent
[44:26] baptisms that's why i'm going over this
[44:28] so thankful uh for them all celina
[44:31] obeying the word of god and being
[44:33] baptized in the name of the lord praise
[44:34] god that proves they have a new heart
[44:36] that proves they're forgiven god has
[44:38] forgiven them praise god
[44:40] because you get a new heart you go to be
[44:42] baptized the bible said wash away your
[44:44] sins praise god it washes away your sins
[44:47] now ezekiel 36 26 uh you got it haven
[44:51] are you just writing it down it's okay
[44:52] you got it
[44:53] no it's okay
[44:55] okay ezekiel 36 26
[45:00] so before you're a christian you have a
[45:01] stony heart which means god
[45:04] cannot write his word upon your heart
[45:06] it's not it's not alive it's not it's
[45:08] not living it's a dead thing the word of
[45:11] god is dead to you
[45:13] unless you're saved
[45:14] if you're saved now the word of god
[45:16] becomes a flesh it becomes a part of you
[45:19] right your new life
[45:20] you love the word of god it's alive
[45:23] haven uh ezekiel 36 26.
[45:37] great go and read 27 too now here's the
[45:39] third step new heart new spirit third
[45:40] step
[45:50] amen great job haven i almost want to
[45:52] give you two claps but
[45:54] so there's three steps first god gives
[45:55] you a new heart you have now you have a
[45:57] feeling toward god you have a soft
[45:59] tender heart toward god it's not a stony
[46:01] heart where it's not alive to god it
[46:02] fights against god but now you have a
[46:04] heart of flesh and then so now that you
[46:06] guys are baptized now your goal is on a
[46:08] new spirit or a new mind
[46:10] so god is going to work through the word
[46:12] of god your prayers your bible reading
[46:14] he's going to give you a new spirit
[46:16] which is a new way to think
[46:18] so look at this time of your life as i'm
[46:21] getting washed my brain's getting washed
[46:23] i'm being brainwashed by the holy spirit
[46:25] okay because that's really what we all
[46:26] are the bible says we're washed by the
[46:28] washing waters of regeneration praise
[46:30] god
[46:32] that's what god's trying to do he's
[46:33] trying to wash away our evil thoughts
[46:35] wash away our evil memories glory amen
[46:37] he's trying to wash away all our evil
[46:39] hurtful feelings our evil imaginations
[46:41] and he's trying to clean it out so he
[46:43] can put his word in that mind amen and
[46:45] then it becomes the greatest weapon god
[46:48] ever had amen this is the greatest
[46:50] battle god ever we ever fought but also
[46:52] if we win the battle it can become the
[46:54] greatest source of a weaponry and
[46:56] victory that we can have is with a mind
[46:58] that's fully dedicated to the things of
[47:00] god
[47:02] i was thinking about that look look how
[47:04] god used my imagination to write those
[47:06] two books out there where do those two
[47:08] books come from
[47:10] do those books like look like brother
[47:11] branham's books no
[47:13] they come from the realm of the
[47:15] imagination
[47:17] right
[47:18] they weren't before they weren't here
[47:21] but god's spirit came in my mind and
[47:23] god's spirit led me to write those and
[47:25] now we have something from the
[47:27] imagination of my mind
[47:29] or when god gives you a new song can't
[47:30] wait till we get that
[47:33] it was it was out there somewhere in the
[47:34] mind of god before it wasn't here
[47:37] but if the holy spirit can anoint that
[47:40] the holy spirit
[47:41] you'll go out there by the spirit of god
[47:42] you'll catch the rhyming words or you'll
[47:44] catch the scripture and you'll put it
[47:46] down together like haven called a new
[47:48] song brother haven't just got a new song
[47:49] this week
[47:51] i'm trying to get her to play it now i
[47:52] said not tonight how about sunday
[47:56] i even gave her a little rhyme there
[47:58] about uh die what was to die in the sky
[48:00] right we're going to meet the lord in
[48:01] the sky and we never have to die
[48:04] right there's going to be a group of
[48:05] people that get to experience that
[48:07] see so her imagination was so unique to
[48:09] the holy spirit that just she climbed up
[48:11] there in heavenly places in christ jesus
[48:14] amen
[48:15] and caught the thoughts of god amen
[48:17] hallelujah
[48:19] now she could have used that to imagine
[48:21] well i'm going to get back at charis or
[48:22] i'm going to get back at daddy when
[48:24] daddy didn't let me have a fruit strip
[48:26] or something like that
[48:28] right she could have used that wow
[48:30] i'll make dad's life harder or something
[48:32] like that but instead she uses her
[48:34] imagination to catch the thought of god
[48:37] amen
[48:39] hallelujah
[48:41] see that's what god wants a mind that's
[48:43] yielded to him
[48:46] like how many testimonies have i got
[48:47] brother jesse your videos or your books
[48:49] have answered all these questions i
[48:50] always had but i never had the answers
[48:52] for it
[48:53] what was that praise god god put his
[48:55] word into my mind and i just shared what
[48:58] god put in there and it goes out there
[49:00] that meets the needs of the people it's
[49:02] a it's a life that's yielded it's a
[49:04] constant yielding to the holy spirit and
[49:06] god will magnify his gifts in our lives
[49:09] amen
[49:13] it's beautiful
[49:15] a mind that's yielded to the holy spirit
[49:18] right
[49:19] so that that's the goal of your life
[49:20] right now is that god wants to build a
[49:23] brand new way of thinking in your in
[49:24] your life
[49:25] in your mind
[49:26] he wants your conscience to be dedicated
[49:28] to the word always obey the word he
[49:30] wants your memory i'm just gonna i'm
[49:32] gonna forgive all my uh all the debtors
[49:34] and i'm not gonna remember those things
[49:36] so much and i'm gonna remember the word
[49:37] of god i remember when christ died for
[49:39] me
[49:40] amen i'm gonna remember the cross when
[49:42] jesus paid for my sins amen that i can
[49:45] forgive other people praise god
[49:47] holy day i remember when god took that
[49:49] financial blessing and god said i'm
[49:51] going to always remember that god will
[49:53] provide all my needs amen
[49:57] hallelujah
[50:00] i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna develop
[50:02] the reasoning to do what's right i'm
[50:04] gonna remember i'm gonna bring up all
[50:06] the reasons to do what's right
[50:08] i'm gonna focus on the right reasons
[50:11] and i'm only going to feel emotion for
[50:13] the things of god
[50:15] i'm not going to long after uh the
[50:17] desires of the past like we talked about
[50:19] i'm not going to desire to be an nfl
[50:20] football player anymore i'm not going to
[50:22] desire to be a famous musician in the
[50:24] world anymore right i'm not going to
[50:26] desire that
[50:27] i'm going to set my affections my
[50:29] emotions on the things that matter
[50:31] and then imagination we've kind of
[50:33] talked about that i want to catch what
[50:34] does god have in store for my future
[50:36] what is god what new things can god
[50:38] bring that i've not never even thought
[50:39] about before
[50:41] and the church said
[50:43] god bless you
[50:44] let's keep going a little bit further
[50:45] here tonight is that okay
[50:47] all right got some amen praise the lord
[50:49] let's do that
[50:50] all right
[50:53] i think church uh let's see
[50:59] i think let's go to colossians 3 and
[51:00] i'll try to bring this down and then
[51:02] just a couple more scriptures
[51:05] colossians chapter 3 verse one so if
[51:07] you're getting the new testament chapter
[51:09] the four gospels and some other uh
[51:12] romans corinthians then you start
[51:13] getting into the epistles of paul
[51:15] pauline epistles they call them
[51:17] basins ephesians philippians colossians
[51:21] look for galatians
[51:22] ephesians philippians colossians
[51:27] colossians chapter 3.
[51:48] amen colossians 3 1.
[51:53] all right i'll read verse 1
[51:55] if you or ye then be risen with christ
[51:58] seek those things which are above
[52:01] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[52:03] of god you catch that
[52:05] paul says seek the things that are in
[52:07] heaven what things are in heaven
[52:09] answers to prayer right
[52:11] god's will heaven and we want to come
[52:13] down on earth
[52:15] seek god's will on everything not our
[52:18] will
[52:18] now here it is verse two is where you
[52:20] and i are absolutely commanded
[52:22] to set our what
[52:25] our affection set your your emotions
[52:28] your mind
[52:30] your mind on things above
[52:33] now this word in the greek means to
[52:35] direct your mind to strive for
[52:40] to side with god
[52:43] so direct your mind on things above
[52:47] how many know that you can point your
[52:49] mind in any direction it wants to go how
[52:51] many know that
[52:54] it's just like a steering wheel your
[52:55] mind is like a steering wheel right go
[52:57] wherever you want to go
[52:59] do you want to go right you want to go
[53:00] left you want to turn around where do
[53:01] you want to go do you want to go
[53:02] straight
[53:04] your mind is the steering wheel and
[53:06] jesus or paul through jesus or jesus
[53:08] through paul says set your affection or
[53:10] take the steering wheel towards the
[53:12] things of god in other words go directly
[53:14] go only to the word of god
[53:20] set it on there can i say it like this
[53:21] cruise control everyone ever know what
[53:23] curious control

[55:07] the greatest blessing we've been ever

[55:34] going to make any stops you're not going
[55:36] to do anything abrupt you're just going
[55:37] to cruise through life praise god i'm
[55:39] not saying no trials but the trials

[55:51] right through it because my mind was on
[55:53] cruise control with christ
[55:56] amen
[55:57] hallelujah
[55:59] verse 4 when christ who is our life
[56:01] shall appear then shall ye
[56:03] also appear with him in glory so look at
[56:05] verse five now brother austin can you
[56:07] read verse five brother mortified means
[56:09] to crucify brother
[56:11] so paul says set your mind on cruise
[56:14] control on christ and then he said
[56:16] crucify thee so go and read verse five
[56:28] concuptions
[56:36] thank you
[56:37] so paul tells us the whole victory right
[56:39] here
[56:40] set your mind on christ and then crucify
[56:43] concuptious means desires and lust of
[56:46] the flesh i just looked it up
[56:48] so evil desires you have to crucify that
[56:50] now brother austin is a crucifixion is
[56:52] it a a fast death or a slow death
[56:59] church did joshua drive out all the
[57:01] inhabitants fast or slow
[57:05] all you learned you learned great job
[57:07] you learned through all those 39 sermons
[57:08] great job church i'm so proud of you
[57:11] told joshua you will not drive them out
[57:13] in a day you'll not drive them out the
[57:15] year he said but you're gonna have to
[57:17] fight year after year amen you have to
[57:19] battle these things for years and but if
[57:21] you stay with me you'll drive up
[57:24] all the inhabitants and you'll be
[57:26] blessed and you'll have rest amen
[57:28] i don't know i'm not going to drive all
[57:30] the animals right away right i'm not
[57:31] going to drive out all the inhabitants
[57:32] you got to fight step after step day
[57:35] after day you got to learn how to serve
[57:37] god you got to learn to set your
[57:39] affection on things above
[57:41] you learn how to serve god
[57:44] you gotta learn how to crucify
[57:46] the lusts of the flesh
[57:49] fornication right sexual sin
[57:52] you gotta learn how to crucify sexual
[57:54] sin
[57:55] you gotta learn how to crucify
[57:58] uncleanness which is
[58:01] luxurious living right the desire for a
[58:03] luxurious living rich living you have to
[58:06] crucify that
[58:08] inordinate affection means
[58:10] uh
[58:12] a calamity a evil affliction a mishap
[58:16] sadness
[58:18] so sad feelings so now how many how many
[58:20] god how many gonna battle depression
[58:21] right we got a battle depression or
[58:23] grief
[58:24] we've got to crucify that it's not going
[58:26] to go away instantly now it could if
[58:28] there's a miracle but if you're going to
[58:30] battle right if it's a battle you have
[58:32] to crucify those feelings
[58:34] in other words say i'm not going to set
[58:35] my my my thinking on depression or or
[58:38] grief or or anger or malice i'm going to
[58:42] set my thinking on the joy of the lord
[58:44] on forgiveness i'm going to focus on
[58:47] forgiving people i'm going to focus on
[58:49] being positive knowing that god is with
[58:51] me god is for me and god's going to
[58:52] bring me through this trial
[58:54] amen
[59:01] hallelujah
[59:03] so how do i get the victory brother
[59:06] set your mind on god
[59:08] and crucify everything else
[59:11] that's how you do it
[59:14] does that make
[59:17] in sense words you got to crucify this
[59:19] you got to break this down now listen
[59:20] church anybody knows
[59:23] if you're going to break down a wall how
[59:25] does it happen it happens one
[59:27] brick at a time
[59:29] hallelujah you see we're in one accord
[59:32] one brick at a time
[59:35] unless you're samson
[59:36] if you're samson you just pick up the
[59:38] whole gate
[59:39] well commands
[59:42] but if you're not samson
[59:44] it's a slow crucifixion it's a just take
[59:47] down that wall get your sledgehammer out
[59:50] break down a few bricks there and break
[59:51] down it's a slow process it takes time
[59:55] kind of like shoving all that snow a few
[59:56] days ago i shoveled it so for three
[59:58] hours
[59:58] i felt about breaking down a wall right
[1:00:00] there it's about building up a wall
[1:00:05] see
[1:00:07] satan wounds us but we gotta ask god to
[1:00:10] for forgive the person or go to that
[1:00:11] person
[1:00:13] if somebody offends you jesus said let's
[1:00:15] go to matthew 18 15 matthew 18 15. if g
[1:00:18] if someone offends you you need to go to
[1:00:20] them
[1:00:23] that will get the guilt or the sin de
[1:00:26] off your mind
[1:00:29] matthew 18 verse 15.
[1:00:44] as our church knows you know i've just
[1:00:45] shared this often sometimes i have a
[1:00:47] hard time going to people because i just
[1:00:48] want to forgive them and love them
[1:00:51] but i i've learned over the years if
[1:00:53] that feeling stays i need to go talk to
[1:00:55] them
[1:00:56] then it was a really painful hurt
[1:00:59] and it could develop a complex if i
[1:01:01] don't go to that person
[1:01:03] okay so brothers think you read matthew
[1:01:04] 18 15
[1:01:09] if thy brother shall trespass against me
[1:01:12] go and tell him his fault between thee
[1:01:14] and him alone if he shall hear thee thou
[1:01:17] has gained thy brother
[1:01:19] good verse 16 but if he'll not hear thee
[1:01:21] then take with thee one or two more than
[1:01:23] the mouth of two or three witnesses
[1:01:25] every word may be established and if he
[1:01:26] neglect to hear them tell it to the
[1:01:28] church but if he neglected the church
[1:01:30] let him be unto thee as a he the man and
[1:01:32] the publican. so jesus said uh three
[1:01:35] strikes and you're out right or two
[1:01:36] strikes in your app right
[1:01:39] now this is for people in the local
[1:01:41] church right
[1:01:43] so
[1:01:44] but the point of this brother and sister
[1:01:46] is that if somebody's offended you
[1:01:48] you're you're going to be hurt and if
[1:01:50] you don't go talk to them satan could
[1:01:52] build up some complex or some evil
[1:01:54] feelings against the person does that
[1:01:56] make sense
[1:01:58] now what's what's wrong today is that
[1:02:00] people will go
[1:02:01] just bash somebody i'm going to go bash
[1:02:03] them on twitter right instead of
[1:02:05] hey can i call you we can need to talk
[1:02:07] about this
[1:02:08] right or send them a text and just tell
[1:02:10] them off and bleep any bleep and emojis
[1:02:12] like devil emojis you know i got one of
[1:02:14] those the other day i'm like what
[1:02:17] what in the world i said i'll pray for
[1:02:18] you sir he's from california
[1:02:20] so i don't even know what you're talking
[1:02:21] about i never said that
[1:02:23] i said well i said lord jesus father
[1:02:25] forgive them they don't know what
[1:02:26] they're doing got to offer love and
[1:02:27] forgiveness
[1:02:30] all right
[1:02:33] so your mind can be said everybody say
[1:02:35] that say my mind can be set ready my
[1:02:38] mind can be set you can you can set your
[1:02:41] mind on something and just keep
[1:02:43] everything else out
[1:02:44] you can do it
[1:02:46] you have to set your mind you have to
[1:02:48] hit cruise control and set it
[1:02:51] right i don't know i don't know about
[1:02:52] george but i gotta hit on i gotta turn
[1:02:54] cruise control on first and then i gotta
[1:02:56] get up to the speed i want and then i
[1:02:57] turn it on
[1:02:59] then i can set it so look there's
[1:03:00] multiple steps to setting it right so
[1:03:03] for us i got to pray first i go talk to
[1:03:05] the person and i can set my mind on
[1:03:07] things above
[1:03:10] see so it's going to take some time but
[1:03:12] as a man or woman thinks in their heart
[1:03:14] so are you
[1:03:16] so remember that you're a
[1:03:18] blood-bought
[1:03:20] blood forgiven
[1:03:22] child of the most high god
[1:03:26] and god is for you
[1:03:28] god is not against you
[1:03:34] all right i want to close with just a
[1:03:35] few thoughts here okay now go back to
[1:03:38] second corinthians 10. i think brother
[1:03:39] austin lina just missed this one but
[1:03:40] let's go back we're at the beginning
[1:03:42] it's okay we're just very glad you got
[1:03:43] here but i want to go over it one more
[1:03:45] time just let the church know
[1:03:47] uh 2nd corinthians 10 verse 4.
[1:03:51] the word complex is not in the bible the
[1:03:53] bible calls it a stronghold which is the
[1:03:55] same thing or it's a fortress or a
[1:03:58] castle or some type of military fortress
[1:04:00] okay
[1:04:02] so when i say i've got a complex that's
[1:04:03] what i'm saying i've got this i've got
[1:04:05] this all these evil feelings built up
[1:04:07] toward brother or sister or
[1:04:09] the president or you know a senator or
[1:04:11] something like that
[1:04:14] now verse four for the weapons of our
[1:04:17] warfare are not carnal they're not
[1:04:18] natural weapons
[1:04:20] but mighty through god to the pulling
[1:04:23] down of strongholds
[1:04:27] okay so in other words church we have
[1:04:29] weapons to tear these strongholds down
[1:04:34] okay who knows what's what's the name of
[1:04:36] the weapon that we use what's the one
[1:04:37] weapon the offensive weapon that we have
[1:04:39] is the
[1:04:41] the word the bible this which is a sword
[1:04:44] so in other words god is saying you go
[1:04:45] up to this wall you take my sword and my
[1:04:48] sword is so powerful now usually you
[1:04:49] want to use a sword against a brick wall
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:51] but god said my sword's a different kind
[1:04:53] of sword it's a double-edged sword amen
[1:04:56] it discerns the thoughts and intents of
[1:04:58] the heart and he said if you take my
[1:04:59] sword against the wall he said that
[1:05:02] sword will break through the wall
[1:05:04] it will tear down the wall
[1:05:08] that's what god's sword does
[1:05:11] now what does it look like for us verse
[1:05:13] five
[1:05:14] casting down imaginations
[1:05:18] and every high thing that exalts itself
[1:05:20] i'm sorry every high thing that exalted
[1:05:22] itself against the knowledge of god and
[1:05:24] bringing the captivity every thought to
[1:05:25] the obedience of christ
[1:05:28] in other words that thought about
[1:05:30] oh i hate my brother i hate my sister i
[1:05:32] i can't stand the preacher you've got to
[1:05:35] take that and cast it down and say i'm
[1:05:37] not going to let this stay in my mind
[1:05:39] i'm going to throw this down and it's
[1:05:40] leaving my mind i've got to cast out
[1:05:43] everybody say i've got to cast it out
[1:05:44] ready i've got to cast it out i can't do
[1:05:46] it for you you can't do it for me we've
[1:05:48] all got to choose to take to capture
[1:05:50] that thought bring that thought into
[1:05:52] capture and then cast it down and get it
[1:05:55] out of our minds but the bible said we
[1:05:57] have a mighty weapon do that the word of
[1:05:59] god
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:04] now church look most people are going to
[1:06:06] be lost about jesus said few there be
[1:06:07] that find it so most people will never
[1:06:09] be able to do this they'll never be able
[1:06:11] to cast down evil thoughts
[1:06:14] like i shared with you that example uh
[1:06:16] michelle obama now she might be a nice
[1:06:18] woman but just one example she said i'll
[1:06:20] never be able to forgive donald trump
[1:06:22] for what he said about my husband not
[1:06:24] being born in uh the u.s
[1:06:26] well what is she basically saying she's
[1:06:28] basically saying i'm gonna hold a
[1:06:29] complex against him the rest of his life
[1:06:33] now that's just one example now there's
[1:06:34] all kinds of other examples i'm not
[1:06:36] picking on her i disagree with her
[1:06:38] politics to a million miles right
[1:06:40] but i'm sure she's a nice woman i'm sure
[1:06:43] but the point is it's this idea where
[1:06:45] i'm never going to forgive i'm going to
[1:06:46] let this complex grow and grow and grow
[1:06:50] until what it eats her away takes away
[1:06:52] her joy takes away her forgiveness now
[1:06:55] and jesus said if you can't forgive
[1:06:57] somebody else what do you say i'm not
[1:06:58] going to forgive you
[1:07:00] so look we look where people are placing
[1:07:02] themselves most people will never get
[1:07:04] victory over complexes but we are the
[1:07:07] few who can live free from complexes
[1:07:09] because we have mighty weapons amen we
[1:07:11] have the word of god praise god and we
[1:07:13] are more than conquerors and we are able
[1:07:16] soldiers we just must set our affection
[1:07:18] on things above
[1:07:21] set your mind on jesus christ and you'll
[1:07:23] remember well christ forgave me i will
[1:07:25] forgive everyone else
[1:07:27] and i'll go to them if i have to
[1:07:30] i say brother jesse we gotta talk her
[1:07:32] sister so-and-so can we please talk
[1:07:36] you've hurt me
[1:07:38] you offended me here here here
[1:07:41] and you have to let these areas be
[1:07:43] destroyed and you have to let the holy
[1:07:45] spirit heal you
[1:07:48] that's how you get victory over the
[1:07:49] complex
[1:07:51] okay so does that make sense by god's
[1:07:53] grace the bible says mighty so these
[1:07:55] things the word of god is mightily takes
[1:07:58] down our complexes
[1:08:00] okay
[1:08:01] now here's just a simple example
[1:08:06] in the book of genesis
[1:08:08] how many members of the man jacob
[1:08:10] abraham isaac jacob
[1:08:13] so jacob was the grandson
[1:08:16] of abraham
[1:08:18] he's the one that had 12 boys
[1:08:20] by four different women
[1:08:22] okay because it was it was okay in those
[1:08:24] days
[1:08:25] uh like a legal thing
[1:08:27] okay anyways
[1:08:29] before he had children he was living
[1:08:31] with his brother and his parents
[1:08:34] and he deceived his brother esau so he
[1:08:37] could because esau was the one who was
[1:08:39] born first he deceived his brother so he
[1:08:41] could get the birthright and not only
[1:08:44] the birthright he also got the blessing
[1:08:46] so he stole by deception he stole two
[1:08:48] things
[1:08:50] from his brother
[1:08:52] now when his brother found out guess
[1:08:54] what he said he said oh i forgive you no
[1:08:56] no he said i'm going to kill you
[1:08:58] right and so what did jacob do
[1:09:00] he ran away
[1:09:03] he ran and left i thought it was like
[1:09:04] 400 or 500 miles i think it was maybe
[1:09:07] maybe less
[1:09:08] by foot no i meant he wasn't in an uber
[1:09:12] he he walked
[1:09:13] all these miles
[1:09:15] and church who knows how long until he
[1:09:17] met esau and anyone know
[1:09:20] 19 years
[1:09:23] 19 years he worried my brother's going
[1:09:26] to kill me my brother's going to kill me
[1:09:28] he's going to kill me
[1:09:30] 19 years
[1:09:31] and then church he was leaving that land
[1:09:33] coming back to where his brother lived
[1:09:35] and you know what happened
[1:09:39] jacob
[1:09:40] heard esau was coming
[1:09:42] and he said before i meet this brother
[1:09:45] who's going to kill me i need to go talk
[1:09:47] to god about this because i've had a
[1:09:49] complex about him for almost 20 years
[1:09:52] church even the saints can have
[1:09:54] complexes for 20 years
[1:09:56] even saints
[1:09:57] but let me advise you let's not let it
[1:09:59] go 20
[1:10:00] years let's not live in fear for 20
[1:10:03] years where life can be miserable every
[1:10:05] time i get a call from that person or
[1:10:06] every time i get an email every let's
[1:10:08] not live in like that let's live in
[1:10:10] victory
[1:10:12] so you know he's a brother austin here's
[1:10:13] how we overcome complex you know what he
[1:10:14] did he said you know i'm going to send
[1:10:17] my wife's
[1:10:18] i'll send my wives first
[1:10:20] then i'm going to send my children
[1:10:21] behind them
[1:10:22] so they can go in mesa or go eat or go
[1:10:24] meet esau and he said i'm going to go
[1:10:26] pray in my closet
[1:10:28] we didn't go to the closet he went down
[1:10:29] to a river amen hallelujah he said i'm
[1:10:32] going to go down to the river and pray
[1:10:34] i've got a complex
[1:10:36] i'm afraid of this he's going to murder
[1:10:38] me
[1:10:39] knowing that after 20 years he probably
[1:10:41] killed me even more
[1:10:43] so what did what he did the bible said
[1:10:44] he prayed all night brother austin he
[1:10:46] was praying say god help kill me his
[1:10:47] name was jacob which means supplanter
[1:10:50] which means like a deceiver
[1:10:52] that was the name jacob the deceiver
[1:10:55] but as he's praying he saw the angel of
[1:10:57] the lord
[1:10:59] and the angel visited him and the angel
[1:11:01] tried to leave he said ibrahim said
[1:11:03] i'm not letting you leave until you
[1:11:05] bless me with victory over this complex
[1:11:07] amen i didn't hear you praise god and no
[1:11:10] i gotta go he's like no you're not
[1:11:13] leaving until you change me
[1:11:15] i need you to change me praise god
[1:11:16] that's how we get victory praise god we
[1:11:18] gotta plead with god in prayer say god
[1:11:21] change me i'm not leaving here until you
[1:11:23] change me praise god the bible said he
[1:11:25] wrestled the angel all night and he
[1:11:27] prevailed amen
[1:11:29] and then god changed his name he's no
[1:11:32] longer jacob now he's israel
[1:11:34] israel means a prince with power amen so
[1:11:38] he went from a deceiver after one prayer
[1:11:40] meeting amen one really long prayer
[1:11:42] meeting he went from from a deceiver to
[1:11:45] a prince a warrior that had favor with
[1:11:48] god and man praise god
[1:11:50] and then after that after he got up the
[1:11:52] bible said he had a new walk that next
[1:11:54] day the angel heard him but he had a new
[1:11:56] walk amen he had a new testimony praise
[1:11:58] god and now the best part was that he
[1:12:01] wasn't afraid to go meet the man that
[1:12:03] was going to murder him praise god now
[1:12:05] he wasn't you didn't have the complex
[1:12:06] anymore now he was fearless because he
[1:12:09] met somebody greater than esau amen
[1:12:11] he met the angel of the lord praise god
[1:12:13] and if he had met the angel lord and
[1:12:15] lived then surely that angel was going
[1:12:17] to protect him and he would allow him to
[1:12:19] live and face his greatest enemy because
[1:12:22] he met the greatest person there was god
[1:12:24] almighty
[1:12:26] praise god
[1:12:28] in church when you met god and you have
[1:12:30] fear for god you don't fear other people
[1:12:32] praise god
[1:12:34] one time you meet jesus christ one time
[1:12:36] you get born again one time you have a
[1:12:37] prayer meeting and the holy ghost comes
[1:12:39] down you won't fear anybody after that
[1:12:41] praise god because you know what real
[1:12:43] fear is
[1:12:44] that's being in the presence of god
[1:12:45] almighty
[1:12:46] so after 20 years jacob is able there to
[1:12:48] walk over and say brother esau
[1:12:51] he said will you receive a blessing
[1:12:53] and he said i was like no no and the met
[1:12:55] and they wept and cried together
[1:12:58] see but he'd build up this complex he's
[1:13:00] going to kill me he's going to kill me
[1:13:02] but he went to the prince of god and the
[1:13:04] bible said god does not give a spirit of
[1:13:06] fear
[1:13:08] so he went in the presence of god and he
[1:13:09] got the spirit he got the spirit of
[1:13:11] power
[1:13:12] love and a sound mind
[1:13:15] hallelujah so god wiped away the manner
[1:13:17] it is god might thrive the way the
[1:13:19] memory of my brother wants to kill me my
[1:13:21] brother wants to kill me in the prince
[1:13:23] of god this was all defeated by the
[1:13:25] mighty weapons of god
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:29] hallelujah
[1:13:31] 19 years of mental torment i'm going to
[1:13:33] be murdered i'm going to be destroyed
[1:13:35] god wipes it away in one night
[1:13:38] with a prayer meeting and wrestling with
[1:13:40] the angel
[1:13:41] i don't know about you but i couldn't
[1:13:42] even i don't know if i could wrestle
[1:13:44] five minutes let alone all night
[1:13:46] right
[1:13:50] thinking about how weak we are right as
[1:13:51] human beings
[1:13:54] right now all of our food is mostly
[1:13:56] hybrid at least they had good food back
[1:13:57] then
[1:14:00] before the industrial revolution
[1:14:03] all these chemicals and everything
[1:14:06] but see he overcame his mind battle by
[1:14:09] getting in the presence of god and then
[1:14:11] he no longer feared man anymore and he
[1:14:14] forgave his brother and his brother
[1:14:16] forgave him and god worked it out when a
[1:14:18] man or woman church will go into the
[1:14:20] prince of god looking for help looking
[1:14:22] for answers god will answer their
[1:14:24] questions god will meet them and god
[1:14:27] will show up
[1:14:28] amen let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:14:34] musician can come
[1:14:38] how many enjoyed the word of god tonight

[1:14:42] we're standing here

[1:14:52] colossians 3 verse 16 church it says let
[1:14:57] the word of god dwell in you richly
[1:15:00] in all wisdom
[1:15:03] now let me just say this again
[1:15:05] remember this chapter begins by set your
[1:15:07] mind on god crucify anything else
[1:15:13] and then it said let the word of god
[1:15:15] abide in you abundantly
[1:15:19] what does that look like
[1:15:23] how does somebody let god's word abide
[1:15:25] in you abundantly

[1:16:13] applause

[1:16:27] i'm that's my goal that's my only goal
[1:16:29] for today amen is to think about christ
[1:16:34] crucify everything else
[1:16:37] every evil desire and then let that word
[1:16:40] dwell in you abundantly put the word in
[1:16:42] you all the time

[1:17:06] little tune a little bit i mean they put
[1:17:09] up with me all these years i mean
[1:17:12] how do you do that
[1:17:14] you let god's word dwell in you with
[1:17:17] psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing
[1:17:19] with grace in your hearts to the lord

[1:17:24] still sing all day

[1:18:06] casey a little bit too
[1:18:08] but it was some of the most glorious
[1:18:09] time
[1:18:10] where i could spend the whole day nature
[1:18:13] hearing god's word
[1:18:15] hearing the prophet of god teach me the
[1:18:16] word of god for three straight summers
[1:18:21] add that up how many how many hours is
[1:18:22] that you know

[1:18:51] the lusts of the
[1:18:52] flesh and set your mind on things above
[1:18:55] did this help tonight by god's grace the
[1:18:57] brother brother austin does help a

[1:19:03] definitely preach more i got a lot on
[1:19:04] here
[1:19:06] some battles are going to get victory
[1:19:08] right away but other ones take
[1:19:10] time
[1:19:12] some take years because you might not
[1:19:14] even realize you're building it up
[1:19:16] because you're so busy and so you know
[1:19:18] trying to do the right thing but
[1:19:21] pretty soon the lord will show you oh
[1:19:23] you've got this area
[1:19:24] you've got this this funny feeling this
[1:19:27] this wrong feeling toward a brother
[1:19:29] toward a sister
[1:19:31] and then the holy spirit will say let's
[1:19:32] take care of that
[1:19:33] reach out to that person and tell them
[1:19:35] what's going on
[1:19:38] you're the only one that knows what's
[1:19:39] good what's being built on the inside
[1:19:42] you're the only one who knows i don't
[1:19:44] know now the holy spirit can tell me
[1:19:45] through preaching but i don't know
[1:19:48] you're the only one who knows is any
[1:19:50] fortress of the enemy being built in
[1:19:52] your mind you're the only one who knows

[1:20:23] let's play that remind me who i am we'll
[1:20:25] sing that here after we
