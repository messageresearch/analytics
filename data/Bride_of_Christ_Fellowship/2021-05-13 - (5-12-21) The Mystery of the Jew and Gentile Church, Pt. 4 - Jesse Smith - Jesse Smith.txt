just i'll read five verses five six and seven myself and then we'll read the memory verse together tonight by the grace of the lord which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel i'm so glad i can partake of his promise praise god not just hear about it not just think about it but i actually partake of it i'm a i'm a benefiter i'm an heir of the promise verse 7 wherefore i was made a minister according to the gift of grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power i like verse 8 though unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given less than the least uh what a humble man paul was i'm less than the least thank god for grace let's go to psalms 19 here psalm 19 verse 13 and 14 we'll read this one together here let's read verses 13 and 14 ask the lord to write this upon the fleshly tables of our hearts here tonight let's read that on three one two three keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer amen may god add his blessings to the ring of his word you may be seated praise god we'll look at part four tonight on this mystery of the jew and gentile church uh brother branham calls it uh the longer version the mystery of the new testament new testament church rather composed of both jew and gentile amen i'm going to pick up right where we left off here i've been really enjoying this series here it's been a real blessing uh i got a little story to kind of go along with it uh tonight we just had a we had some guests over a couple weeks ago and my wife had a nice little opportunity to share the word of god with one of her friends it's just a really nice testimony but before that let's go to acts 13 here in acts 13 uh paul i think i'll lord willing i think uh we'll go to acts 13 and uh we see paul here uh finally gets to go to the gentiles we ended last week by looking at peter and paul how they were men of failures right they'd failed god one way or the other paul was uh consenting unto murder of stephen right a legalistic person he failed god that way peter was the opposite uh not very legalistic but he just lost all of his all of his dignity lying cussing i'm sorry not lying but cussing and running deserting jesus in the very hour jesus would need someone to stand with him but the bible said the sheep would be scattered right from the shepherd and so uh here but yet god's grace comes to these two men and then one has uh a ministry uh the ministry to the circumcision peter and then paul has the ministry of circumcision uh ministry to the uncircumcision the gentiles but in acts 13 here we get to see the moment paul turns to the gentiles and i just want to pull out a couple thoughts in here that may encourage you as i was reading this today i was i was uh i was just kind of remembering you know the reason many times people get mad at you as a christian is because they're jealous of you that's many times the reason someone will get mad at you and that's kind of what happened to paul here as paul started taking the gospel to the gentiles the jews got a uh if you've done nothing wrong and you're just living a christian life and testifying and you're loving the lord and someone kind of gets mad at you and uh they're accusing you that then many times it's just jealousy and that's kind of what the scripture says remember the bible said all k all contention comes by what pride right so see that's why they're jealous you know they're prideful that you know they they want their way they want all the attention or they they want the the gifts of that you have or they want the attention that you have and so we see that here as paul ministers to the jews okay so just to back up a little bit on the story here this is paul's first missionary journey he's in antioch which we know christians were first called christians in antioch what a what a testimony that is there there was never the word christian before until these uh gentiles got the holy ghost and when these gentiles and antioch got the holy ghost they said they're so much like christ they're christ-like they're christians what a testimony praise god that you're so much like jesus christ that you take his name amen what a what a beautiful testimony that these gentiles receive they're so much like christ they call them christians and so paul and barnabas go to antioch and and the bible said uh here that they they go into the synagogue and uh they wait for an opportunity to speak and that's kind of what i'm feeling led to do i've been talking about this for about six months once my book comes out i'm feeling led to just go to churches and i just kind of feel compelled to share this message with somebody anybody that will listen uh but just to go and wait for an opportunity to speak and so paul and barnabas go and wait and uh can you pull up proverbs 18 16 honey we'll just pull that up real quick remember a church that they were sent out by prayer and fasting by the holy ghost and that's what i would before i'd go i'd have to do that too i want to pray and fast and feel the leading of the lord i kind of mentioned this in my prayer earlier a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men now we know paul eventually went before you know festus and different ones leaders and he went before great men but here jesus sent him out ministering a missionary work and uh he he had a gift to be a prophet right we saw that he was a prisoner to his gift and so eventually he sat there and he just laid in there in the synagogue and then god opened up a door for him to talk right for him to preach that's in acts 13. and so you probably are familiar with the story a little bit but but god's word is true gifts make room for themselves so paul didn't have to beg anybody to preach paul didn't have to persuade anybody can i say a word the bible said that they just offered him an opportunity to speak praise god and so if god sends you to do anything he's going to provide opportunities for you if god wants you to witness to someone and god's going to give you a listener that wants to hear it praise god because god's gift make room for themselves everywhere i've gone and preached i've never asked i never had to beg anybody to preach right the doors have just always opened for me right that's i've always taken that approach if if god sends me he's gonna uh make a way for me to get there he's gonna make a way for me to minister the door's going to be open now in this chapter it's a beautiful chapter uh the you know he about verse 14 he goes down to the synagogue and the bible says in verse 15 ye men and brethren if any of have any word of exhortation for the people say on so they just said if anybody has anything to say go ahead and stand up and paul of course paul takes his opportunity well this is what i've been waiting for paul stands up and he preaches the history of the law he starts at moses and goes to joshua like we've been preaching on joshua and then he goes through the judges kings and then he skips forward from the kings and goes to john the baptist praise god and then he and then he goes from john the baptist to the one john was talking about jesus christ this is around 1844. this is 14 years after calvary imagine that 14 years our church is 15 years old in a couple weeks 14 years after calvary and paul's finally sharing the gospel with these antioch people these jews so he preaches jesus death and resurrection can i say like this today if the gospel was just as fresh 14 years after calvary it's just as fresh today praise god almost 2 000 years after calvary amen right because if it's fresh 14 years it's going to be fresh 1400 years and now 2 000 years it's just as fresh because the blood is still on the mercy seat praise god christ is still on the throne amen hallelujah the blood will never lose its power amen as long as the the messiah the savior the christ is on the throne then the power of god is in effect today amen it's when he steps off that throne that's when the there's no more covenant right there's no more opportunity for them to get the holy ghost the gentiles speaking but this is our time as i said like last week this is the times of the gentiles church this is your time this is my time jesus said this is the acceptable year of the lord it's your year amen it's my year it's our opportunity to do something with the message with the word of god we must do something while it's a day praise god right like summer spring is coming up this is your time if you want to plant crops this is your time to do it right if you want to get something in the fall this is your time to do it it's your season we got to do something with it praise god so we're preaching it with all we've got with all we got we're singing with all we got we're doing everything we can right doing everything we can because this is our one opportunity we don't know when it will be taken from us so we better make use of it right now amen this is the year uh this is this is the acceptable year of the lord it's been a two thousand year year amen hallelujah let's read that the acceptable year of the lord let's go to acts i'm sorry isaiah 60. let's remember these benefits that we got church i'm sorry 61. remember brother brahm said in verse we'll get that we'll read we'll read 61 verse 1 and 2. the spirit lord is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek that's why i'm supposed to preach good news to you right i'm preaching the good news right that we can possess the land praise god every footstep of yours spiritually is your possession praise god is that good news or bad news you can defeat any giant that's battling you you can drive them out by obeying god's word you'll have great success driving uh those giants if you meditate on god's word that's good news to me no giant's gonna defeat me i'm gonna overcome every giant praise god i'm going to overcome every obstacle every every adversary i'm able to overcome i have great success i'll be strong in the lord i'll be courageous in the lord as long as i meditate on the word and keep the word of god amen see it's anointed me to preach the good tidings he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted so when we're brokenhearted we have the power of the holy spirit to heal the broken hearts glory we proclaim liberty to the captives we don't have to be bound by the spirit of depression right we don't have to be bound by the spirit of greed right or the spirit of fear or the spirit of lust we are proclaiming you're free in jesus name that's my message that's the message of the brother abraham gave us we are free in jesus name amen we're proclaiming liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound see along the same lines you can be free you don't have to stay uh captive you don't have to stay a prisoner you can walk out of that prison jesus christ opened the prison doors you just got to walk out praise god he paid your fine amen he paid your ransom right you don't you no longer are bound in the prison the ransom is paid now verse two is where brother shows us uh jesus paused this here he he fulfilled the first part but not the second part of the verse to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and that's where jesus stopped in luke chapter four he read this portion of the scroll but he stopped right there to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord he closed the scroll sat down and everybody was watching him he said this day this scripture is fulfilled amen praise god right and jesus still said jesus went to heaven and said you cast out devils you pray for the sick you'll speak with tongues praise god all these things he promised all these things that means this is still the acceptable year of the lord amen now the day of vengeance of our lord that's the tribulation right to come for all to comfort all that more so brother showed us jesus stopped after that first phrase to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord this is the year of the lord this is like we sing it this is the year of jubilee praise god this is the year we don't have to be bound we don't have to be slaves right we ought to be encouraged we ought to be strong in the lord we ought to be very courageous amen this is our opportunity this is your time my time to do something with god's word hallelujah now back to acts 13. ah he said hey anybody got anybody anybody got anything good to say go ahead and say on paul says i'll stand up and preach let me preach the acceptable year of the lord amen he was just waiting he was led by the holy spirit he sat in that synagogue just waiting for the opportunity god had arranged it perfectly because he knew a great multitude of antioch christians would believe amen of course they weren't christians then but they became christians paul stood up and preached the gospel he gave a warning to anyone that would reject it and then the bible said that the next sabbath they came together again praise god let me just see if i can find that here briefly here yes yeah so verse 42 says they come the next sabbath and verse 43 now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and religious prosecutes follow paul and barnabas who speak to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god so paul was persuading them continuing salvation by grace continue in grace not law stay in the grace of god right verse 44 the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god so now almost the whole city wants to hear they had a great big stir paul preached a lot of people started believing now the news spreads see when something real happens in your life you got to spread the news right when jesus does something for you you just can't help but you got to spread it praise god hallelujah it spread throughout the whole city verse 45 but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with enemies so this is what i was saying when when uh when god has favor on you people get jealous of you right and speak against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming so the jews see all this big crowd come and they get jealous they get angry right and then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles and there it is right there and for so the lord hath commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should be for uh salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to er eternal life believed and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region now isn't that something the gentiles rejoice now look church what what are they showing paul's showing them that before they had no connection to moses right no connection to joshua the judges the king david john they had no connection the gentiles had no connection because of the law but paul's saying no now you are you are connected to them but now you have grace instead of law those people are part of your heritage amen they're a part of your heritage and so that was good news to them i can look back and i i realize uh uh moses i can believe moses but moses was pointing this is what moses pointed to this is what joshua pointed to amen nobody can say that i don't have a part with them they could say we have a part with them we have the further revelation of what they were preaching praise god amen they weren't cut off from the patriarchs they weren't cut off from the prophets they were the fulfillment of the prophets did we just read it last week church they were the fulfillment of jeremiah isaiah hosea right all these prophets in other words they wrote about me amen isaiah they could say isaiah wrote about me church we can say the same thing hosea wrote about you amen hallelujah ezekiel wrote about you uh jeremiah wrote about you all these prophets can i say like this god spoke about you to abraham in genesis chapter 12. right you're not disconnected from them you're connected for them you are the very fulfillment of what they talked about praise god oh church we could get a grasp of that tonight amen we are the fulfillment we are what they wanted to see and what they wanted to experience praise god church remember the bible said every sacrifice they had they left there with a with still a defiled conscience you don't think they wanted to see this day you don't think they wanted to see the day where they'd have to worry about animals anymore it was all by faith and grace and they could actually feel forgiven by the holy spirit you don't think they wanted to see that the bible said even the angels look wanted to look into those things amen hallelujah the bible jesus said those prophets longed to see these days that jesus was preaching right and so we are the fulfillment oh we should be praising god amen oh my what a blessing church it was necessary did you catch that it was necessary the word of god should have first been preached to you he said but lo now we turn to the gentiles anybody had everyone and anybody ever felt uh someone was jealous of them because you had the blessings of god on your life that's what happened to the paul barnabas and the antioch uh gentiles right they were just totally uh jealous because of the blessing of god upon their life now church i want to i like if you would just let's look at a few scriptures here this particular text right here proves something i i just want to make sure i i state it the the right way yeah let's go to verse 46 can you put up verse 46 again there verse 46 this particular verse proves that blinded jews are responsible for their blindness i'm going to say that again this verse proves that when god blinded the jews they actually wanted to be blind he didn't blind them and they didn't want to be blind he blinded them because they wanted to be blind okay in other words god's not going to blind somebody without their will to be blinded right because the the gospel was available to them they were now they preached at 14 years right paul after 14 years finally says hello we turn to the gentiles now he wasn't preaching that whole time but i'm just giving you an idea the jews had 14 years to receive that message and they turned it down now here's where it is seeing you put it from you you judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life so when god blinded the jews it's because they didn't want to receive it and people that are blind today the bible said they're blinded by the god of this world satan and the reason they're blind is because they want to be blind the bible says they don't want to retain the knowledge of god in their minds and so because of that god gives them over to believe a lie oh church you ought to be so happy that you don't have a reprobate mind amen you don't serve the god of this world your eyes are open and you see the truth of god's word you see it clearly you rejoice in it praise god and god has turned his favor toward you amen and you're not blinded you see the light amen oh hallelujah church they wanted to the bible said they wanted they turned themselves they judged themselves we've got to be sure we judge ourselves the right way too right because each service we either leave closer to god or further away from god right you judge yourself right you judge am i am i living the gospel or not right you judge yourself either worthy or unworthy of that and so this is a great this is a great scripture that we have and so god says well after 14 years if you don't want it i'm going to give it to the hungry-hearted people like we saw last week if somebody won't take up a ministry god will give it to somebody else i think i'm sorry that was sunday i think it's mother's day yeah that's mother's day if somebody won't take a position if you won't fill the position god's called you to do god will find somebody else to do it or he'll take the candlestick totally away right that was ephesus god told ephesus i'm taking the candlestick away within 50 years of i'm sorry within 20 years of that letter ephesus was almost uninhabited god took the candlestick away so for us it's a warning if we don't let the light of jesus christ shine god could take the church out of akron there could be no church in akron right if we don't repent constantly if we don't keep our first love god can remove the candlestick or he'll raise somebody else up to do it oh let's make the most of this year that we have amen let's make the most of it this is our time it's our opportunity praise god let's put everything we got into it praise god like this weekend i know it's a lot of services but we got to put everything we got into it praise god we got to do everything we can because we can see over the years people will compromise on one service and compromise on another pretty soon within a few years or months we never see him anymore right because they compromise and they don't live the gospel satan has somehow set up some something that's more attractive than the word of god oh my look at that look at the lie that he he gets people to believe lies that something of the world is more valuable than eternal life let me tell you there's nothing more valuable than eternal life amen than the word of god what could be more important than god's word and and and learning how to be like christ being a christian amen being like christ what could be more valuable than that but the bible said they judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life and remember brotherhood said that he said man don't he said god don't send anybody to hell brother man said right what's he talking about this scripture right here they send themselves to hell right because it's their choice right the word they've heard the word either accept it or reject it so this proves god doesn't blind anybody outside of their perfect i'm sorry outside of their free will right they have to they have to turn it down now church after many more uh missionary travels it's beautiful paul returns to antioch in acts 14 27. if you could pull that up and he testifies all that god did to the gentiles in verse 27 he said that when they were come had gathered the church together they rehearse all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles the only reason god could open the door was because the jews closed the door oh man our door is always open for jesus may we always invite the holy ghost holy ghost come on in cleanse us of our sin increase our faith for miracles amen right increase our boldness to speak the word of god always come in change our lives make us more pure make us more like you make us more holy praise god amen we've got to open the door because the jews closed the door they're blinded and now the door's open to the gentiles and jesus said i am the door amen yeah he rehearses it the door of faith that's jesus we've opened jesus unto the gentiles oh i think that's a beautiful scripture see all are responsible to open the door to christ each and every one of us and god doesn't blind anybody outside of their free will god has to work with free more agency i want to get this next thought here so the next thought i take is paul's gospel is christ's judgment standard so to say to say paul's teachings are important is a huge gross understatement right just as if you just said oh paul's paul's teachings are pretty important that's a huge understatement paul's words are of the utmost importance they're of supreme importance is that right he was he was the messenger the prophet to the gentiles he was a teacher to the gentiles he was the minister of the gospel to the uncircumcision and the bible places curses on anyone who changes paul's teachings because they are the judgment standard on judgment day they are christ's judgment standard on judgment day let's pull up galatians 1 if you could verses 6 and 7. let's just go over this here briefly because this kind of ties in this little story i want to tell just a small little story of a testimony i marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel and as you read later i preached this years ago it's the legalistic gospel they were moved back into legalism they had some liberty and grace but then because of circumcision they got moved back into legalistic gospel paul says which is not another but there will be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ so any addition to the word of god becomes a perverted gospel right it becomes something that's not real it's it doesn't have the same power praise god and so any addition to the word any addition makes it perverted now go to verses 8 and 9. galatians 1 89 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed and no and and you know he says it again he doubles down on this he says if you add anything you're cursed now why would paul say such strong words why would he say you're cursed to add anything to the gospel well i think the answer is in verse 10. so uh in case you can put up 10 we'll read 10 11 12 13. the reason paul would curse anybody because he said for now do i persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet please men i should not be the servant of christ verse 11 but i certify you brother that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man next verse for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it by man but by revelation of jesus christ go to verse 13 for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it i will stop right there so why would paul have such strong words he said because no man taught me this right i didn't learn it from myself jesus revealed it to me jesus unveiled this to me now look look at this god could have had peter teach paul right pretty good teacher how many would say amen to that pretty good teacher peter's a good teacher how about james yes wonderful teacher any of these men of god luke right any of these many of these mighty teachers could have taught paul but jesus said i'm not going to use any of them i'm not going to use an angel i'm not going to use anything i'm coming myself to deliver this message amen this is so so important i'm going to use paul in such a mighty way i'm not i'm not giving this uh uh this job to any man i'm gonna do it myself praise god amen it was such importance and that's why paul could say if you change what jesus showed me you're cursed remember proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 says don't let or let no man add to the word of god the bible says or god will call you a liar if you add to the word of god revelation 22 18 and 19 says if you add to the word of god the prophecy the plagues are attitude if you take away your name is taken off the book of life and how come people can't see that you can be saved and lose your salvation how can your name be on a book of life and then be taken off and you not lose your salvation people they just can't understand that they have such a baby gospel they have such a milky baby gospel that they can't even accept the plain words of christ right it shows that because they're not taught by christ they're taught by man and they can be persuaded by men jesus said in the in the church ages he says if you don't obey if you don't repent i'll blot your name out of the book of life so jesus christ gives that warning and then paul says though we are an angel so not even him not even his preachers no one can change a word that christ taught him now where did paul get this revelation galatians 1 17 he received it likely in the wilderness of arabia god didn't send paul to a seminary although god used some of those sometimes right he doesn't use them anymore really he didn't send peter as we say he didn't send peter to teach him he had a special meeting praise god he had to meet paul face to face he said neither went out to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went to arabia and returned again into damascus amen he had to have a special fellowship a special meeting with jesus now church i just trust each one of you will have that room meeting with jesus praise god not to write the bible but to accept the bible praise god each one of our children no matter our adults no matter how young or old each one of you have to have a meeting where you met the grace of god where you met jesus right where you experience the life-changing power of the gospel praise god if a man can talk you into it a man can talk you out of it but if you meet jesus face to face you know where it happened you know when it happened nobody can talk you out of it praise god amen paul says i can't change it angels can't change it this is jesus's gospel he gave it to me in the desert i like that can you imagine paul he's out there in the desert maybe he's in a cave maybe he's in a tent and that same light starts shining in the tent let's say it's an early morning like brother branham would meet the angel of the lord early in the morning he'd paul be praying or something pretty soon he'd see a bright light and he said oh that's a sun is really bright today it but it wasn't the it wasn't the s-u-n it was the s-o-n and he had the same feeling he had when he got knocked off the horse on the road to damascus praise god he said that's not a different light that's the same light amen and now that light is talking to him again and now he now he doesn't say who are you lord he said he said he said uh lord jesus uh i bless your holy name i thank you lord thank you for coming to meet with me i worship you jesus amen praise god it's not who are you lord it's o lord i love you i humble myself what would you have your servant to know praise god he met the same light that he met on damascus out there in the desert and he taught him the word of god what a privilege and now he's not persecuting that light now he's trying to save people by that light praise god now he's trying to point people to that light it's a great blessing what a great revelation he persecuted the light but now he's getting revelation from the light to shine the spiritual light of god amen just like moses met god in the wilderness praise god just like moses met god in the wilderness of mount sinai for 40 days praise god his face shone like an angel i wonder if paul's face shone like an angel he met jesus face to face and then brother bretta met the angels the seven angels out in the out of the desert praise god out in arizona god met uh brother branham there to give him the revelation of marriage and divorce praise god and so we see we have a modern example of god meaning a prophet in the wilderness so 1500 years before christ and then about 15 or so years after christ and then about 1900 years after that god is constantly meeting with prophets giving them the word of the lord amen hallelujah so this is a modern day example we see giving the standard now let me just tell this brief little testimony and i call it a testimony because my wife was able to witness for a while maybe was it maybe five or ten minutes you got to talk a little bit in person yeah so we every now and then we have friends over and and uh you know the the friend was a mother as well and was kind of confiding in my wife and and talking about one a situation where her one of her daughters can i say it maybe not okay just trouble with the daughters right uh with one of the daughters and a very serious issue i'll just sound like that very serious sin maybe that's the best i could do a very serious sin and uh and though the mother asked my wife her opinion you know my wife's opinion on it and my wife said well saint paul said this sin is so-and-so saint paul called it a sin and then the the mother said well that those are just paul's opinions she said that's what we've been taught and this person's been going to church their whole life and this is an obvious blatant i'll say it like this it's an abominable sin that kind of gives you more our older ones a little more understanding the kind of sin this is and uh and this this this daughter was telling her mother well well yeah the bible says that but that was just paul's opinion and the holy spirit must have anointed my wife and my wife said no those are not paul's opinions paul didn't get his thoughts from himself paul got his thoughts from jesus christ and they got talking and this this mother she's in her 50s right she's in or if not 50s late 40s i think 50s maybe mid 50s she said wow i never knew galatians 1 said that so i think later after they went home my wife sent the scriptures from galatians 1 the ones we just read now can you imagine that you're 50 years old and you never knew now we're raising it now he's raising it my children are raising it you're raised to know that paul had such authority that he said if you change one word of it you're cursed but this you know this sweet woman here this mother is 50 some years old and never knew it until god anoints my wife to share the scripture with her and now and now think of the understanding think about this what a difference it is to say oh this is just opinions to change from that to say no this is the absolute truth and you're responsible for it then my wife sent me a text and i said well yeah share this scripture from romans 2 where it said you'll the secrets of men's hearts will be judged by jesus christ according to paul's gospel amen now what now to me church this was such a eye-opening uh reminder about the condition of denominational churches i'm talking about outside of this message and most churches in general most churches have no idea that paul lay down a standard and if they if churches don't meet the standard they are cursed it's gonna be hard to make it to heaven when you're cursed right as we said you're either permanently cursed like cain or temporarily cursed right like saul king saul because he had those evil spirits on him right and it's it's obvious a lot of people going to churches denominational have evil spirits on them right they're anointed with some like depression or whatever it is you know pride whatever it is they're anointed with something that's that's not holy it's evil right and so it was just an eye-opening uh lesson and i just love how god anointed my wife she sits back there you know year after year we we talk about our desire it was so it's so beautiful we always talk about our desire to share the message with our friends and we never would have thought you know this would have been the moment i hit that thing last week you know we never would have thought this would have been the time but because this sin has raised up in that person's family a very serious abomination by the way it caused her to kind of bring it up this mother to bring it up to my wife and god had those scriptures right on my wife's mind to be able to witness and share right there and now the mother has a better realization this isn't an option this is required praise god and so now we'll see where the family i don't know where the family the direction they'll go whether they'll support the abomination or keep standing against it but also but i can say this uh that the door of faith has now opened that family and that at least that mother and she has to walk through that door of faith can i say it like that that the door is open wow this is a new understanding and church this is part of the revelation of the jew and gentile church as one church amen both jew and gentile have the same standard it's the word of god brought by paul praise god amen it's the same standard that's the standard for you malachi for your acacia it's the same standard for me we are all under the same standard we all must live the bible and keep its precepts and we'll be blessed amen but if we change it we'll be cursed or it'll preach a perverted gospel where the power of god doesn't move anymore but we've got to stay with the original word so the blessings can remain on us there's just an amazing reminder to me how blessed we are to have had a prophet come we really are because now like uh the believe the sign people if they're watching they haven't made a video about me yet so we'll see maybe it'll be this week and i'm just waiting for it to drop but that that's what they do um you know like hair like women's hair or men's hair they don't make it a command they make it that's just a custom now we know it's not a custom paul says all the churches he said we have no other practice this is the only practice we have and so that's just one example where they've made that teaching it's a doctrine right it's a bible command you can see it all through the scripture they've made that just a custom and they've made it of no effect right they make a net effect and now paul's gospel is changed right and now they and now they also preach they don't preach three works of grace anymore as soon as you say a sinner's prayer you're filled with the holy ghost with all the power of god and all all the holiness of god but their lives don't even testify to it right you don't see any fruits but jesus said if you abide in me and i in you you'll bear much fruit praise god amen see we can see the effects of a perverted gospel we can see the effects of it and then what do you do they mock brother branham they make fun of brother branham they they uh they just take his name through the mud a servant of god right just speak against him and uh say all kinds of evil things against a servant of god which their lives can't their lives can't even compare one one lick to brother branham's life all that he sacrificed all the miles he traveled all the sermons he preached all the people he prayed for laid hands on uh discernments in the prayer lines all the sacrifice their lives don't even come close to the sacrifice that brother random gave for the gospel it's because they're preaching in a different gospel now let's read romans 2 16. can you pull that up here and that just really brought a real reality these churches most churches have no idea about paul's gospel therefore how can they be the bride like you said with the last with the last revelation the mystery of the church is bright how can they breathe be the bride church when they don't keep the bridegroom's word it's impossible it can't be because they'll allow such abominable sins they'll allow in their family they'll allow the church how can they be the bride it's impossible because they're breaking the word of the bridegroom that he delivered through paul romans 2 16 this is the one i think i share with my wife in that day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel now church how in the world is god going to do that is he going to have people stand there and then god is going to have like a tv screen like we we picture our minds and god's going to play back all their secret thoughts that they thought about the word of god then what is god going to do have a have like a bible reader over here one of the angels reading the scripture that they broke let's go to women's hair uh that's just old-fashioned what does hair have anything to do with it those preachers have lost their mind their you know it'll play their thoughts and then the angel will read the scripture where we have no other practice no no nor do the churches of god and they'll be judged by that right the secrets will be judged things they wouldn't say out loud will be judged on that day may god help us to say the right thing may god help us to confess all of our secrets because we all got them right we all got secrets but we got to confess them under the blood and we can't meditate upon them that's why that memory verse was so beautiful the meditation let let me meditate on the word right that's what that's what god told joshua think about the word meditate on it day and night then you'll be a success we just have to make sure we don't meditate on the wrong things we don't we can't meditate on the evil secrets of our heart we must confess the secrets of our heart and learn to meditate on only the word of god because that day church you and i are gonna stand there right because we're gonna do it right after the rapture it's under the blood of jesus right all of our secrets all of our any of our evil words or thoughts or deeds we have to make sure it's all under the blood because if not the white the white throne judgment they'll stand there and they'll have to answer for every secret thing they said about you or us right in this hour the word of god though all their secrets will be judged all the times they mocked it mocked you made fun of you spoke evil of you called you a loser old-fashioned whatever they called you every evil secret they thought will be judged according this word praise god that's why i'm so thankful everything we believe we got a scripture for praise god right if not then we just say well it's a liberty or something like that right or a custom you can have some traditions as long as they're liberties but everything we believe we can find it on here because this is what's going to be our judgment standard praise god the secrets of men's hearts will be no made known by the gospel of jesus christ how important it is to know what paul preached that's why i'm going to continue on that lord willing the next one i'm going to get to is colossians right galatians ephesians philippians i preach those next one's colossians i got to preach all paul's gospels until the lord comes because paul we are judged by that right we don't have any option we got to know what paul said and we have to do what paul said because that's our judgment standard and the church said praise god see it's not preached enough right paul's paul's letters aren't preached enough they need to be preached more praise god like when i like just preaching through you know how many blessings did we get out of you know galatians ephesians and philippians the book of joy i mean how many how many how many wonderful blessings came out of that series i was just on cloud nine and there are no sermons praise god there's just a fresh thing here tying in here and all the blessings that's when we have the faith for the prayer cloth right that's what philippians remind us where did philippians start there at the philippians they're at philippi when when paul got the the clause laid on him and that's what caused us to pray for vang's dad and who is that that way that's the sermon that moved it was the the philippians series praise god oh my that's what moved it was that's where it started in acts 19. that's the city of philippi and so see uh like brother man said we go from glory to glory from bible experience to bible experience amen hallelujah praise god i'm almost at an hour there i got about 15 more minutes here i'm going to try to finish up now paul's now when he says my gospel he's not saying like they came from his thoughts right but they come from his dispensation or his stewardship that came from jesus christ not every word paul wrote or uttered from his lips was from jesus right uh go to uh go to first corinthians seven i'll just show you an example real quick not every word paul said was thus saith the lord and that's what i can't understand about brother branham's worshipers and joseph branham's worshippers i can't understand how they say they keep saying it they just said it last week every word he said was thus saith the lord i have a quote brother brahm said he said this is not thus saith the lord this is william branham now how in the world is that not thus saith the lord when he says this is not thus saith the lord how is that thus saith the lord he just said it isn't but yet they'll still just fight through it and they'll still pervert the gospel of jesus is what they'll do they're doing they're perverting the gospel because it's not scriptural that every word a man says is thus saith the lord outside of christ first corinthians 7. now look at verse 25 now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord look at this so even paul couldn't say every word i say and write is thus saith the lord even paul couldn't say that now most of it was that was written but not all of it yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful he said i don't have a commandment for this one this is just my judgment now early in the chapter there's another i just flipped to that one i saw it right away because i got it highlighted there in my bible yeah here it is verse 10 go to verse 10. and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the white depart from her husband but it but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife to the rest speak i not the lord not the lord so see how especially you young people see how you got to be very careful how you rightly divide the word of god paul says you're judged by my gospel but then he said there's a few thoughts in there that are just my thoughts you guys understand so you have to be very careful now most of it is god's thoughts and the the best part of it is paul will say this is not i i'm sorry this is not the lord this is me like those examples right there so when when the random worshipers make every word thus saith the lord they're actually making brother branham equal to jesus christ higher than paul right remember brother and said in his day men tried to trick him to make him write or make his words another part of the bible and brother graham said he said no you can't do that because you can't add one word to it or take one word away hallelujah that's a real prophet right there amen not joseph smith who has a whole new testament to the the bible he says he says another testament of jesus christ there is no other testament this is the only testament of jesus christ the king james version of the bible praise god you know why paul did that you know why paul said this because he knew men would worship him go to first corinthians 2 1 verse 12. first corinthians 1 12. paul's like i'm glad i didn't baptize you because you would have said i baptize you in my own name that's how much they worship paul that's evil right it's evil look at this now this i say that every one of you saith i'm a palm of apollos i'm a cephas i have christ next one is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of paul verse 14 i thank god that i baptized none of you but christmas and gaius verse 15 lest and he should say that i baptized in my own name wow around the message of the hour people would get their eyes off the message and get eyes too much on the messenger it's the same now right same problem now they get their eyes on a man instead of on jesus christ same thing today right it's the spirit of our look how close the spirit of idolatry hovers around this message right and and if you listen to those jeffersonville people they're so sincere they sound so happy so sincere but when they say every word is thus saith the lord they've got the wrong spirit they've just exalted a man equal to jesus christ no man's equal to jesus christ he's the man of he's the man of among all men right he's the he's the he's the highest of the highest praise god he's the he's he's the all-in-all praise god he's the he's the holy one of israel he's the high lifted up one he's the only one that deserves our praise and our worship praise god but they are exalting just like they did paul they're exalting brother branham today and they're making him higher than paul like you've heard him say this that they said if you had a message book and a bible i've heard his his followers say this the brandon followers or the joseph branophobes they say if you had a message book and a bible which one would you take they said i take the message book because it has the fresh revelation of the bible i'd say no i take all of god's word and then if i love god god will reveal to me the revelation that's in that message book see the the the best part is god ain't going to make you choose right that's why he sent them the prophet to us that's why he had printing machines and computers right in his mind hallelujah see same thing did they do today they still baptize them brother bram's name they worship brother branham they say every word brother ram said what same thing they did to paul because he was such a man a mighty man of god see only paul's commandments from jesus christ carried authority now remember paul said in romans 3 can you put up romans 3 4 real quick romans 3 4. now who wrote romans say it out loud who wrote romans paul god forbid yay let god be true but some did he say some every so that includes who paul not every word paul said was thus saith the lord every man's a liar didn't brother i lied to the irs then how is that thus saith the lord to lie to the irs it's not as is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and might just overcome when thou art judged uh would you go to verse 13 313. their throat is open sepulchre with their tongues they have used a seat the poison of ass was under the lips verse 14 whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness so all men every man says evil things right from time to time paul puts himself in there he's the one that wrote it paul was never saying every word i say is thus saith the lord he said only the commandments from jesus are thus saith the lord and so much thus saith the lord that you'll be judged by them on the day of judgment amen what a statement that the secrets of men's hearts will be judged by my gospel in that day by jesus christ these are not just common words right the commandments are the word of the lord ah remember in romans 7 paul said i did things that i hated the thing that i i hated that what i did he said oh wretched man that i am but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ let me close here paul was not infallible but his revealed gospel from jesus christ was infallible that's the difference paul's revelation from jesus is god's divine will for mankind and think about that all people will be judged by paul's letters every single person on this earth will be judged by romans corinthians second corinthians right galatians ephesians philippians colossians first thessalonians second thessalonians first timothy second timothy all men will be judged by those epistles you cannot overemphasize the importance of paul's letters they are god's divine will for us so water baptism paul taught water baptism in the name of the lord jesus right in the literal name of the lord jesus christ that's of course an acts but paul said whatever you do in word or deed in colossians do it all in the name of jesus christ the godhead paul said never said was three persons he said jesus is the image of the one person paul taught all the church's appropriate hair length right paul taught modest clothing how many people are going to answer for that one almost the whole world women preachers paul forbid women preachers how many churches are going to answer for that one the false doctrine of inviting jesus into your heart that's a lie right you're inviting jesus in your heart and then you're born again no you repent and then the holy spirit comes upon you praise god right you repent of your sins it's not just oh jesus i love you i believe in you come into my heart he won't come in you got to repent first you got to be justified sanctified then he comes in praise god then he comes in the soul this is the revelation of jesus christ given to paul the word of god that we've received how many glad to have heard it by god's grace let's stand to our feet i'm gonna stop there by god's grace so thankful growing up i never heard these things i had no idea all i knew was john 3 16 that's about all i knew musicians can come now i thank god for john 3 16. but as i became a man i was 19 when i got saved i started going like i said i went to a baptist church for a while i went to that uh the chapel for a while which is basically presbyterian uh i went back to my pentecostal church for uh for a few services to try i went to the membership classes to understand their doctrine and i just i just saw all these differences and i just hungered for something i just hungered somebody tell me the truth just give me the truth and i'll believe it and finally simon said jesse you've got to listen to this sermon you got to do it tonight on thanksgiving night 2001. i still got the picture that night what a glorious night that was see there see there's something about mankind there's something about humans it's and god wants us we all long for absolute truth we all long for some just give me a give me a rule to live by right give me a guideline to live by give me give me a standard to live by just tell in other words just tell me what you want and i'll do it that's what god gave us in paul's letters amen god gave us the standard we'll be judged by this standard on judgment day naomi graduated college right i graduated college you're getting close my wife graduated college they always told us with every lesson they always gave us a rubric right do this this this you get this grade if you don't do this you don't get that grade well we had i don't know if you did you have them sister did you have rubrics we had rubrics in almost every assignment in other words it was always clear what was expected of us and we knew how we'd be judged amen oh it's so clear how we're going to be judged praise god we're going to be judged with god's mercy in other words we're going to pass god's judgment we're going to be judged now we're going to be corrected now so that there is no judgment there's just reward later praise god we're going through the judgment right now haven amen judge me now show me where i'm wrong now so i can be right later amen of course i want to be right now too but you understand show me where i'm wrong now so i can be corrected now so there's no trouble later on so i don't have any secrets that need to be revealed on judgement day because i've confessed them all i fought against them my whole life praise god i've fought the giants my whole life i fought against the amorites and the hivites and the jebusites and the lying heights and the pride heights and the lustites and the fear heights praise god i fought against them my whole life and i've done everything i can to cast them down in jesus name and so when i cross over there's no trouble breakout there's no more judgment for me because i overcame them amen amen on my deathbed i just confessed all again just freshly confessed everything and all i felt was the peace of god or if i die in an accident i already had the peace of god in my heart god prepare me for that however it happens i'll be ready to go over i'll have been judged now i've met the standards and so i'll get the highest reward praise god i'll get the great i was looking for amen praise god somebody asked me last week who was it charis she said daddy did you ever get any f's and i said no i never got a f oh yeah haven did now on my grade card i never got a f she said did you ever get a c i said no i never got a c i only got a's and b's on my grade cards my whole career you know why because they gave me a rubric and you know why cause i was scared to get a c i was scared to get a d i was scared to get a f i didn't want it i want to do my best i wanted to know was expecting me and i wanted to do it and i wanted to get the best grade i could and so you know what they did on my you can look at my high school picture haven you know everybody else has just black robes on but there was like the top the top 20 got this extra white little sash that goes over you and i was one of them now my wife is number one so i'm not bragging she had she had all the honors and the rope whatever the ropes and whatever but i'm just giving us a human example i didn't want to fail how many how many want to overcome and how many want to prevail with the gospel in other words i don't want to fail the grace of god the bible says you can fail the grace of god we don't want to fail the grace of god we want to meet the requirements of god's grace and like the bible said oh the bible said like in jeremiah we want an expected end praise god in other words i want to know i want to expect what's going to happen and actually have that happen to me i want to know what's going to happen to me when i die amen i don't want to i don't want to be surprised praise god i don't want any surprises after i die well you weren't clean and you were no i wouldn't expect it to end i want to know exactly what's going to happen when i cross over the angels of god will carry me up not devils take me down but the angels of god will carry me up into the presence of god amen i want an expected end so god gave me a rubric to make sure i get there and all i gotta do is keep preaching paul keep keep reading paul praise god keep teaching paul because this is how you live this is how you please god this is how you have an expected end the secrets of men's hearts will be judged on that day by jesus christ according to my gospel so thankful church that at 21 years old i got to hear that there's only one gospel and you'll be judged by it i was 21. this woman just a few weeks ago she's probably 55. she didn't hear that until she was 55 years old think about the regrets this mother now has now of course god can forgive him but think about the regrets this woman has 55 years i never knew i was going to be judged by this but church we have the privilege of knowing it right now that ought to make us thankful that ought to make us feel blessed by god's grace and it will cause us to live more obedient to god's standards how many want to live more obedient to the standards of god how many want to meet the requirements and get an a plus can i say it like that i want an a plus on my grade card i want to hear well done student well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord let's pray here heavenly father thank you for giving us this rubric lord god lord your prophet paul even said we must all walk by the same rule the same standard lord i love that in school and the teachers would tell me all that i had to do i would read that over and over again of
