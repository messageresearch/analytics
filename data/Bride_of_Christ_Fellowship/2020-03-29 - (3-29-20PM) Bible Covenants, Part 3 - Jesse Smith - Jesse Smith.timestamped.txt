[5:52] [Applause]
[5:53] [Music]
[6:06] praise God
[6:07] well we're not gonna have you stand here
[6:10] today because it's no strange with the
[6:13] camera angle but let's just open our
[6:15] Bibles here let's start with 2nd samuel
[6:18] 7 we like to start with david's covenant
[6:21] here so 2nd Samuel 7 verse 4 2nd Samuel
[6:38] 7 4
[6:41] [Music]
[6:49] we're willing tonight maybe we'll get
[6:51] done with all the covenants we'll see
[6:53] how everything goes here 2nd Samuel 7 4
[7:09] extra 3 verse 3 because verse 3 is one
[7:11] brother branham points out as important
[7:13] to show how God's prophets make mistakes
[7:16] and they're not infallible of course you
[7:20] know they're where they are infallible
[7:22] when they say thus saith the Lord but as
[7:24] far as their their human words and ideas
[7:27] and opinions those are not infallible
[7:30] let's start with verse 3 and Nathan said
[7:35] to the king go do all that is in thine
[7:38] heart for the Lord is with thee so we
[7:42] know David was desiring to build a house
[7:44] for the Lord and David said do Nathan
[7:46] said do all that's in your heart David
[7:49] let's read verse 4 and it came to pass
[7:51] that night that the word of the Lord
[7:53] came unto Nathan saying go and tell my
[7:56] servant David thus saith the Lord shalt
[7:58] thou build me in a house for me to dwell
[8:00] in whereas I have not dwelt in any house
[8:04] since the time that I brought up the
[8:06] children of Israel out of Egypt even in
[8:08] this day but I've walked in a tent and
[8:10] in the tabernacle in all the places
[8:14] where and I walked with all the children
[8:16] of Israel spake ayuh word with any of
[8:18] the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to
[8:21] feed my people Israel saying why build
[8:23] ye not me and a house of cedar now
[8:27] therefore so shalt thou say unto my
[8:30] servant David thus saith the Lord of
[8:32] hosts I took thee from the sheep coat
[8:35] from following the sheep to be ruler
[8:37] over my people my people over Israel
[8:41] what a way what a beautiful way for God
[8:44] to remind David where he brought him
[8:47] from he took him from the Sheep the
[8:49] Sheep coat and made him king over Israel
[8:51] praise God verse 9 and I was with thee
[8:54] whithersoever thou wentest and I've cut
[8:57] off all thine enemies
[8:58] out of thy sight and have made thee a
[9:01] great name like unto the name of the
[9:03] great men that are in the earth moreover
[9:06] I will appoint a place for my people
[9:09] Israel will plant them that they may
[9:11] dwell in the place of their own and move
[9:13] no more neither shall the children of
[9:15] wickedness afflict them any more as
[9:18] before time and as since the time that I
[9:27] commanded judges to be over my people
[9:28] Israel and have caused the to rest from
[9:30] all thine enemies also the Lord tells II
[9:33] that he will make thee and a house
[9:37] praise God
[9:38] so we'll pause right there just for a
[9:40] moment we're looking at the fifth
[9:42] covenant David's covenant and there's
[9:48] two main portions of Scripture this is
[9:50] the first one second samuel 7 for 217
[9:54] and then after this we'll go to Luke
[9:56] chapter 1 verses 30 to 33
[10:01] so it looks like here that we can see
[10:05] how David's covenant is getting set up
[10:07] and again one interesting thing about
[10:08] this covenant I don't I don't think it
[10:11] has a blood sacrifice connected to it as
[10:16] we'll see the other ones did you know
[10:19] Adam and Eve God gave coats of skins to
[10:21] Adam and Eve and then Noah's covenant
[10:24] Abraham's covenant and Moses his
[10:26] covenant all had animal sacrifice and
[10:29] blood but it seems this one doesn't have
[10:31] one now let's pick up reading there in
[10:36] 2nd Samuel 7 12 and we'll read down
[10:39] through 17 and when thy days be
[10:42] fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy
[10:44] father's I will set up thy seed after
[10:45] thee which shall proceed out of thy
[10:48] bowels and I will establish his kingdom
[10:52] he shall build an house for my name and
[10:54] I will establish the throne of his
[10:57] kingdom forever I will be his father and
[11:02] he shall be my son if he commits
[11:05] iniquity I will chasten him with the rod
[11:07] of men and with the stripes of the
[11:09] children of men but my mercy shall
[11:12] not depart away from him as I took it
[11:14] from Saul whom I put away before thee
[11:18] and thine house and thy kingdom shall be
[11:22] established forever before thee thy
[11:25] throne should be established forever
[11:28] according to all these words and
[11:30] according to all this vision so did
[11:32] Nathan speak unto David
[11:34] what a beautiful covenant such amazing
[11:39] promises but let's get a little bit of
[11:42] background here this covenant was given
[11:46] to David about 500 years after Moses
[11:49] covenant and God as we saw initiated
[11:53] this covenant through his prophet Nathan
[11:58] and just like Abraham's covenant here
[12:00] God is choosing the deal with one man
[12:03] and his offspring rather than making a
[12:07] worldwide covenant with everyone at the
[12:09] same time so we seek Abraham and David's
[12:13] covenants start with one man and they
[12:15] work out towards all the others and this
[12:20] is a beautiful pattern to see here in
[12:23] David's covenant God is building upon
[12:26] the Mosaic Covenant because Moses's
[12:30] government had the law and the
[12:31] priesthood so he starts off with law
[12:34] priesthood and now he builds a kingship
[12:38] or a kingdom a kingship for one king
[12:42] he's remember in the Old Testament they
[12:44] were God told Moses they would be a
[12:46] kingdom of priests remember that
[12:49] children have God called them out of
[12:51] Egypt and said you're gonna be a kingdom
[12:52] of priests unto me but now he says I'm
[12:56] gonna put one king above all of you so
[12:59] we know who that king was Jesus yeah
[13:02] praise the Lord he was the ultimate king
[13:05] we know David I'm sorry Solomon was the
[13:08] first king there and there was numerous
[13:12] kings have followed him but eventually
[13:14] the throne of David was cut down as
[13:17] we'll see here tonight through the
[13:19] scripture so God builds upon the law the
[13:25] hood and now he builds kingship or a
[13:28] single king over his people this
[13:32] represents the true king the Lord Jesus
[13:34] Christ who the Bible says one day he
[13:37] will rule all nations with the rod of
[13:38] iron
[13:39] praise God according to revelation 12 5
[13:43] and that's in the Millennium praise God
[13:46] and it looks like even in the future
[13:48] home so we read our our text here out of
[13:54] 2nd Samuel 7 and you saw three things
[14:00] that God was going to establish through
[14:03] Solomon a throne a house and a kingdom a
[14:09] throne house and a kingdom and this was
[14:13] spoken to be forever now and I I'm sorry
[14:17] in Psalms 89 3 and 4 God specifically
[14:20] caused this a covenant so I'd like to
[14:23] read that to you I have made a covenant
[14:26] with my chosen I have sworn unto David
[14:29] my servant thy seed will I establish
[14:32] forever and build up their own to all
[14:37] generations say law so that scripture is
[14:42] important because it specifically calls
[14:44] this a covenant now I want to read a
[14:50] couple scriptures where everybody can
[14:53] clearly see how this covenant is
[14:56] conditional now it didn't sound like it
[14:59] right when we read 2nd Samuel 7 it
[15:01] sounded like it was just gonna be
[15:02] forever seemed like there would be no
[15:06] conditions but there were and that's why
[15:09] it's important to hear all of God's
[15:11] prophets because the more you hear God's
[15:14] prophets the more details God gives
[15:17] about his prophecies right just like
[15:20] with Jesus first coming he would bruise
[15:22] the head of the serpent and then later
[15:25] we come out of Abraham's lineage later
[15:27] he come out of David's lineage then he'd
[15:29] be born in Bethlehem with each prophet
[15:32] we got more and more detail more and
[15:34] more clues about where Christ would be
[15:35] born and so with other
[15:38] prophets we can see more details about
[15:41] David's covenant now it's interesting I
[15:44] went online and I found a couple
[15:45] websites where people actually believe
[15:47] that David's throne is England you know
[15:52] how they have kings and queens in
[15:54] England
[15:55] some people believe that's David's
[15:57] throne today and we disagree of course
[16:00] but they try to make some ancestor
[16:04] connections and they try to create some
[16:06] type of lineage where like Queen
[16:08] Elizabeth today would be the the lineage
[16:12] of David now of course we don't believe
[16:14] that and the reason they do that is
[16:16] because they read second Samuel 7 and
[16:18] they see how this throne is to continue
[16:20] forever and so they think well that must
[16:23] mean forever and but it takes
[16:26] understanding it takes reading the rest
[16:28] of the scripture to understand that God
[16:31] actually paused this covenant kind of
[16:33] like you did with the Daniel 70 weeks he
[16:36] paused Daniel 70 weeks and God will pick
[16:39] up this covenant but pick it back up
[16:41] during the Millennium so let's read a
[16:45] few scriptures and so you can see them
[16:51] let's start with 2nd chronicles 7 18 to
[16:55] 22 but actually where we just verses 19
[17:00] and 20 second chronicles 7 19 and 20
[17:17] okay so second chronicles 7 19 and 20
[17:20] but if you turn away and forsake my
[17:22] statutes and my Commandments which I've
[17:24] set before you and shall go and serve
[17:27] other gods and worship them then will I
[17:29] pluck them up by the roots out of my
[17:32] land which I have given them in this
[17:35] house which I've sanctified for my name
[17:37] will I cast out of my sight and will
[17:42] make it to be a proverb and a byword
[17:44] among all nations did you catch that
[17:47] where he says and this house that you
[17:51] see that is what was God's promise to
[17:53] Solomon throne house Kingdom so here God
[17:57] says this house if you don't obey my
[17:59] statutes I'll pick up this house out of
[18:04] the land okay so Solomon sins and the
[18:08] many sins of his royal offspring
[18:10] eventually turned Israel away and God
[18:15] had to pluck up the nation and then
[18:18] scatter them abroad into other nations
[18:20] the last king of Israel of David seed
[18:24] was Zedekiah if you remember of the Book
[18:26] of Jeremiah and he was expelled from his
[18:30] throne around 587 BC 587 BC and since
[18:38] that moment there has not been a son of
[18:40] David ruling in Israel so he was the
[18:44] last son of David ruling now like I said
[18:47] some people believe Prince Charles and
[18:50] Queen Elizabeth is continuing that but I
[18:52] don't see that by the scripture because
[18:54] the Bible said he will pluck up the
[18:56] house now there's another there's a
[19:01] couple other scriptures that are really
[19:03] important to seeing this so god
[19:09] postponed the promises until jesus'
[19:13] second coming and it states it plainly
[19:17] in Ezekiel 21 so if you have your Bibles
[19:21] equal 21 verses 26 and 27
[19:27] don't we have malachi read that one I
[19:30] would get now kind of case you may be
[19:32] reading that okay
[19:33] can you read okay Malachi Ezekiel 21 26
[19:40] and 27 let's say Lord take off the crown
[19:47] you shouldn't have to just sing exalt
[19:49] him that is loan evasive meditite I will
[19:52] overturn overturn overturn it and it
[19:54] shall be no more until he come right it
[19:57] is I will give it to him amen
[20:00] so hopefully you could hear that but
[20:01] Malachi read how thus saith the Lord
[20:04] remove the diadem take off the crown so
[20:08] God speaking to Israel he's gonna take
[20:10] away that crown of David he said I'll
[20:14] overturn it shall be no more until what
[20:18] a beautiful word praise God until he's
[20:22] gonna remove David's throne from Israel
[20:24] until he come whose right it is so who
[20:28] has rights to the throne of David Jesus
[20:30] Christ that God said I will give it to
[20:34] my son Jesus Christ see God will never
[20:38] do away with David's house although
[20:41] they're on we'd say a probationary
[20:43] period or disciplinary period he'll
[20:47] never do away with them he'll never do
[20:49] away with Israel because of his other
[20:51] covenants his glorious promises praise
[20:54] God
[20:56] God promised to preserve the house of
[20:59] David because of his promise in 2nd
[21:02] chronicles 21 7 so I'll read that one
[21:06] and then acacia if you would go to
[21:10] Jeremiah 33 so I'm gonna read I'm going
[21:17] to read 2nd chronicles 21 7 the case you
[21:20] will get Jeremiah 33 verse 20 333 20 let
[21:27] me read this one 1st 2nd chronicles 21 7
[21:30] howbeit the Lord would not destroy the
[21:32] house of David because of the Covenant
[21:36] praise God the agreement the league
[21:40] because of the covenant that he made
[21:42] with David and as he promised to give a
[21:44] light to him and to his sons forever
[21:49] praise God so there's two beautiful
[21:54] scriptures Lydia you go to Jeremiah 31
[21:57] so KC's gonna read a beautiful scripture
[21:59] work these two portions are both in
[22:02] Jeremiah Jeremiah 33 and then Jeremiah
[22:04] chapter 31 and they both prove that God
[22:07] cannot ever forget Israel so acacia can
[22:13] you read Jeremiah 33 23 24 25 and 26
[22:56] [Music]
[23:14] hey men not sure if you can hear that
[23:17] but God said I will cause the captivity
[23:20] of my people to return and I'll have
[23:23] mercy on them God said I will not cast
[23:30] away the seed of Jacob and of David my
[23:32] servant so and he even makes a promise
[23:38] based upon day and night he said thus
[23:41] saith the Lord if my covenant be not
[23:43] with day and night and I have not
[23:45] appointed the ordinance of heaven earth
[23:47] so in other words God is saying my
[23:49] covenant with Israel is as sure
[23:52] as this beautiful sky here it's sure
[23:56] this beautiful sunlight the daytime the
[23:58] nighttime as sure as day and night is
[24:00] sure so is my covenant with Israel and
[24:03] the house of David he said I will not
[24:06] cast him away forever but I will bring
[24:08] again their captivity
[24:10] that's jeremiah chapter 33
[24:12] I asked Lydia to go to Jeremiah chapter
[24:15] 31 Lydia will read verses 31 to 34 and
[24:21] you can read them and then when you're
[24:23] ready Jeremiah 31:31 to 34
[24:43] [Music]
[24:51] [Music]
[24:59] [Music]
[25:08] amen so God recognizes here in Jeremiah
[25:12] 31 that Israel's already broken the
[25:15] Covenant that he's given to them he says
[25:17] although I was a husband unto them so
[25:20] God has stayed with Israel despite the
[25:22] times they've broken his covenants and
[25:25] of course this is the new covenant which
[25:27] we'll get to in a few moments here but
[25:30] if you go to verse 35 are we that thus
[25:32] saith the Lord which giveth the Sun for
[25:36] a light by day and the ordinance of moon
[25:38] and of the stars for a light by night
[25:43] now stay with me o this beautiful which
[25:45] divided the sea when the waves thereof
[25:48] roar the Lord of Hosts is his name
[25:52] look at verse 36 this is beautiful if
[25:54] those ordinances depart from before me
[25:57] saith the Lord then the seed of Israel
[26:00] also shall cease from being a nation
[26:02] before me forever praise God the moon
[26:06] the Stars the light the day the darkness
[26:09] he said if those pass away then Israel
[26:12] will pass away but if they never pass
[26:14] away my promises with Israel will never
[26:16] pass away now look at verse 37 this one
[26:20] brother man mentions in the fifth seal
[26:21] because we even listen to that he said
[26:23] thus saith the Lord if heaven above can
[26:26] be measured who can measure the heavens
[26:29] science still can't do it and the
[26:31] foundation of the earth searched out
[26:33] beneath I will also cast off all the
[26:37] seed of Israel for all that they have
[26:38] done saith the Lord who can measure no
[26:41] man can measure the heights of the
[26:43] heavens or the depths of the earth
[26:45] praise God so God says since no man can
[26:48] measure that neither can anyone measure
[26:50] my love for my people Israel and the
[26:52] house of David beautiful
[26:54] praise God Alleluia beautiful promises
[26:58] all God's covenants are so so steadfast
[27:02] completely sure now let's look at a few
[27:08] more scriptures here let's go to Isaiah
[27:11] 9:6 and 7 maybe a case you can do Isaiah
[27:14] 9:6 and 7
[27:20] and then Malachi have you get Luke 1:32
[27:25] and 33 so let's look at what Isaiah says
[27:30] about the David or the Davidic covenant
[27:34] and then also what the angel Gabriel
[27:38] tells Mary about it because it has a
[27:41] deeper meaning obviously than what we
[27:43] said with some of these people trying to
[27:44] guess and try to hope that the seed of
[27:47] David still has a king somewhere but we
[27:51] read the scriptures how he's gonna take
[27:53] away the diadem so praise God
[28:46] beautiful beautiful promises we love we
[28:48] love this verse right for Christmas time
[28:51] wonderful counselor the babe should be
[28:53] born unto you born of a virgin but I
[28:56] specifically want to point out of the
[29:00] increase of his government and peace
[29:02] there shall be no end so that's why it
[29:06] seems like the Davidic covenant is
[29:08] actually an eternal covenant it's part
[29:11] of the eternal covenant as well because
[29:13] there will be no end to Jesus's reign as
[29:16] son of David on the throne of Israel
[29:24] now the angel Gabriel visits Mary and
[29:27] gives her more revelation about this the
[29:30] deeper meaning of the throne of David so
[29:34] Malachi can you read Luke 1 32 and 33 he
[29:42] shall be great and shall be called the
[29:43] son of the highest David and he shall
[29:48] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[29:50] and of his kingdom there shall be no man
[29:52] a man praise God of his kingdom there
[29:55] shall be no end who this son of David
[29:57] this babe that was to be born of Mary
[30:00] what a promise praise God so we can see
[30:03] that this Davidic covenant it's on pause
[30:07] right now but it's going to be renewed
[30:09] soon praise God in the Millennium and
[30:12] then from there it will have no end this
[30:14] covenant has a deeper meaning this
[30:17] kingship this kingship turns into an
[30:20] eternal kingship by the grace of the
[30:23] Lord now it's important to note I
[30:28] preached this numerous times but this
[30:30] kingdom was actually first offered to
[30:32] Saul but because Saul was disobedient it
[30:37] was given to David and the Bible says
[30:42] that in 1st Samuel 13 13 and Samuel said
[30:45] to Saul dah has done foolishly now has
[30:47] not kept the commandment of the LORD thy
[30:51] God which he commanded thee 4 now with
[30:54] the Lord have established the kingdom
[30:56] upon Israel forever alright what a
[30:59] promise that psalmist out on church I
[31:03] just want to say this god only knows the
[31:05] great blessings and rewards men and
[31:08] women lose due to their selfish
[31:11] disobedience it's so important for you
[31:13] and I just to learn how to obey to
[31:16] humble ourselves and just simply submit
[31:19] and not rebel against God's simple
[31:22] humble commands remember Saul just did
[31:24] it in a few in a few ways he just
[31:26] sacrificed right before allied you got
[31:29] there and then he didn't kill everything
[31:31] he should have destroyed everything
[31:33] that should apply to our lives we should
[31:35] cut out everything that hinders our walk
[31:37] with the
[31:38] we should live by every word that
[31:40] proceeds out of the mouth of God I want
[31:47] to read a quote real quick I mentioned
[31:49] it on Wednesday night from the church
[31:51] age book this is from the summer nian
[31:55] church age chapter four programs talking
[31:59] about a free existence of souls the RAM
[32:03] said is not the person that comes
[32:05] predestinated eternally from God it is
[32:08] the word or seed that is it way back
[32:13] there too far back for the human mind to
[32:16] grasp the eternal God with eternal
[32:18] thoughts thought and decreed Romans nine
[32:22] thirteen Jacob have I loved and Esau
[32:25] have I hated
[32:27] and neither was born and neither had
[32:29] done good or evil
[32:31] brother Ram gets back to writing for
[32:34] himself see it was the thought and then
[32:37] that thought became expressed and God
[32:40] bought back Jacob because Jacob alone
[32:43] was seed I like this watch because it
[32:47] deals with the Covenant next Jacob alone
[32:49] had the seed and that is why he had
[32:52] respect to the birthright and Covenant
[32:57] of God praise God there it is he said if
[33:00] you are true seed you will hear that
[33:02] word the spirit will baptize you into
[33:05] the body of Christ filling you and
[33:07] empowering you and you'll receive the
[33:09] word for your day and your age
[33:11] hallelujah so this sets apart the seed
[33:15] of Abraham and Jacob and Moses and as it
[33:20] goes down now to David the reason David
[33:23] respected this covenant was because he
[33:25] was a seed of God and so will be today
[33:28] as we now get closer to moving now to
[33:30] the New Covenant or the present covenant
[33:33] were under now those that are the true
[33:38] seed of God that were eternal in the
[33:42] thoughts of God they're the ones that
[33:44] will respect and honor and obey and keep
[33:47] God's covenant praise the Lord
[33:50] hallelujah
[33:52] so let's do that now now Lydia actually
[33:57] already read our our scriptures for the
[33:59] new covenant so God told Israel and to
[34:08] give you a new covenant he sent me to
[34:10] give you a new heart and I'm gonna write
[34:12] your write my words upon your heart
[34:16] praise God
[34:18] now this covenant does have the shedding
[34:21] of blood of course we know whose blood
[34:25] that is that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:28] praise God but before that let's see how
[34:32] when this new covenant is made the Old
[34:35] Covenant waxes old the Bible sent so
[34:39] I'll just read that Hebrews 813 so
[34:43] Hebrews 813 in that he saith a new
[34:49] covenant he hath made the first old now
[34:53] that which decayeth and waxeth old is
[34:56] ready to vanish away praise God and we
[35:05] looked at that this morning how many of
[35:07] the requirements from the the Old
[35:10] Covenant or the law are vanished away
[35:12] right for example the Levitical
[35:15] priesthood is vanished away from New
[35:19] Testament believers because we don't
[35:20] have to sacrifice animals physical
[35:22] animals anymore many of the civil laws
[35:25] as we looked at this morning like with
[35:26] men growing beards some of those no
[35:30] longer apply but the moral law the truce
[35:35] the moral laws that God gave us such as
[35:38] the Ten Commandments and abominations we
[35:41] can see scripturally by searching the
[35:43] New Testament we can see many of those
[35:45] still apply today and the Bible says
[35:47] that we through the spirit keep the
[35:50] righteousness of the law praise God
[35:52] that's in Romans chapter 8 we're not
[35:55] going to read that now so we see Church
[35:58] when we when we have the New Covenant as
[36:00] we're receiving the New Covenant
[36:02] it makes the old vanish away
[36:06] now we know what that can't mean we get
[36:08] rid of everything that Moses said right
[36:10] because we just read this morning in
[36:12] Ephesians chapter 6 where did Paul get
[36:15] his authority to tell the children to
[36:16] honor the parents he got it for Moses so
[36:20] we have to understand these scriptures
[36:22] by rightly dividing them and you know
[36:24] why God does that because he loves to
[36:26] hide himself from the wise and prudent
[36:28] prudent those people who think they can
[36:30] all figure it out but he reveals himself
[36:32] unto babes such as we learn so people
[36:35] will use Hebrews 813 and say we don't
[36:37] need the law we don't need the Old
[36:39] Testament and then they'll let women
[36:41] wear pants they let men wear skirts
[36:44] though the reject a lot of the
[36:47] scriptures from the Old Testament it's
[36:49] because they haven't rightly divided the
[36:52] Word of God so may God help us to always
[36:54] rightly divide the word of truth
[36:57] okay now acacia are you next or is
[37:01] Malachi next okay what's our vacation
[37:03] they should go to Luke 22 20 Hebrews 9
[37:09] 16 and 17 let's look at two more
[37:12] scriptures that talk about how this
[37:14] covenant is founded upon Jesus's blood
[37:18] it's dedicated and established through
[37:21] the blood of Christ so okay so when
[37:24] you're ready Luke 22 verse 20 he meant
[37:38] so Jesus specifically caused or caused
[37:41] the Lord's Supper the New Testament in
[37:44] my blood see he was just ready to shed
[37:48] his blood because that was the ninety
[37:49] got arrested the next day was gonna be
[37:51] his crucifixion
[37:52] so he's letting the the disciples know
[37:55] I'm gonna make a New Testament and it's
[37:57] gonna be in my blood now remember at
[38:00] this point they don't understand they're
[38:03] not even sure he's gonna resurrect the
[38:05] Bible said they didn't really understand
[38:07] it till after his resurrection so they
[38:10] were just missing it but you know God
[38:12] was gracious we all would have missed it
[38:13] it just went over their heads because it
[38:15] just wasn't the time for them to
[38:17] understand it because God reveals
[38:18] everything in this
[38:19] time and season so Lydia through
[38:23] Christ's death and his blood sacrifice
[38:26] and his resurrection the Covenant goes
[38:31] into effect and we see how it the
[38:35] Covenant can't go in effect until Christ
[38:37] dies because of Hebrews 9 16 and 17 so
[38:42] Lydia can you read that
[38:55] Braes god so here we see that the New
[38:58] Testament could not have any effect
[39:01] until after Christ died the Bible said
[39:04] Jesus destroyed death through death he
[39:07] had to go through the door of death as
[39:09] an innocent sacrifice in order to defeat
[39:12] death and so once Jesus died the the
[39:18] benefits of the Testament went into
[39:21] effect praise God we saw those we saw
[39:24] that inheritance begin getting poured
[39:26] out on the day of Pentecost praise God
[39:28] that's when they started getting poured
[39:30] out all the inheritance right we receive
[39:33] the inheritance of the Saints in light
[39:35] the scripture says that so just as a
[39:39] natural man or a natural son can't
[39:42] receive his father's inheritance doctors
[39:43] father passes away so it is with our New
[39:46] Covenant we can't receive the benefits
[39:49] in the inheritance until the testator
[39:52] died and so that shows how God and the
[39:56] son were one in the same praise God I
[40:02] just want to make again the point I
[40:05] don't know if you remember this but I
[40:07] was making the point on Wednesday how a
[40:08] lot of the covenants have animal
[40:11] sacrifices of course Jesus was not an
[40:14] animal although his nature was like a
[40:16] lamb and he was led by a dove but just
[40:20] as the other sacrifice or the other
[40:22] covenants had sacrifices that were torn
[40:25] so Jesus was torn the Bible said he was
[40:29] so torn that his bones stared at him
[40:33] they were so exposed and so it was with
[40:37] Noah Noah tore apart the sacrifices
[40:40] Moses tore about the sacrifices Abraham
[40:43] sacrifices were torn apart so much that
[40:45] God came as that fiery smoking furnace
[40:49] of the pillar of fire and came and his
[40:51] presence hovered right between those two
[40:54] sacrifices so we see that Jesus had to
[40:57] be opened up his body had to be opened
[41:00] up just like the other sacrifices had to
[41:03] be torn apart and so God uses another
[41:09] sacrifice here a blood sacrifice to
[41:12] confirm his covenant that he is going to
[41:14] keep his promise arch' glad he keeps his
[41:16] promise praise God and he backed it up
[41:18] by shedding blood they got and it was
[41:21] just not just any blood it was holy
[41:24] blood praise God so the pardoning of
[41:27] Jesus holy blood cannot ever be
[41:30] overemphasized while the other covenants
[41:34] had blood Adam and Eve had coats of
[41:36] skins Moses sprinkled the people with
[41:39] blood Abraham had sacrifice sight of
[41:43] sacrifices the nude the New Covenant
[41:46] blood completely abolished his sins and
[41:51] it it clears our guilty conscience okay
[41:56] and that's in Hebrews 10 1 to 5 the
[41:59] Bible said the Old Testament worshipers
[42:00] would make sacrifices but their
[42:04] conscience 'iz were still defiled they
[42:06] still felt guilty a church that should
[42:09] help us if we really confess our sins
[42:10] through the blood of Jesus Christ we
[42:13] shouldn't feel guilty anymore we should
[42:15] be able to say praise God God cast in
[42:18] the sea of forgetfulness I know I did
[42:19] wrong but he forgave me praise God
[42:21] that's what the power of Jesus blood is
[42:25] supposed to do under this new covenant
[42:27] it's supposed to purge our guilt guilty
[42:29] conscience so that we leave the church
[42:32] service or we leave our prayer closet or
[42:35] we leave wherever we confess our sin we
[42:38] leave there with a clear conscience that
[42:41] God has forgiven us praise God if
[42:45] there's any
[42:47] about your sins and if they still remain
[42:49] we just have to read Hebrews chapter 10
[42:52] that's all you have to do because he
[42:55] settles it once and for all praise God
[42:58] and then Colossians 2:13 says it plainly
[43:01] Christ has forgiven you all trespasses
[43:04] not some but all this is why God had to
[43:08] keep sending covenants as we said
[43:10] Abraham's covenant was wonderful there
[43:12] was many blessings and Noah and all out
[43:15] all down Moses but none of them handled
[43:18] sin none of them abolished sin until the
[43:20] new covet the new covenant did away with
[43:22] all sins praise God because it's it's a
[43:26] blood was of a greater power hallelujah
[43:30] Jesus blood is the perfect remedy for
[43:33] sin and it's the last covenant that
[43:38] requires blood because it's the eternal
[43:41] covenant doesn't require blood the first
[43:45] edan covenant was bloodless and so is
[43:48] the eternal covenant the future home
[43:51] covenant so let's read a good scripture
[44:01] here Malachi you get Hebrews 13 verses
[44:07] 20 and 21 this is just a beautiful
[44:09] scripture if we ever battle you know
[44:14] what God's Spirit is doing in our lives
[44:16] you know we go through seasons of highs
[44:19] and lows go through mountaintops we go
[44:21] through valleys times you can everyone
[44:25] can tell God is moving doing great
[44:26] things but then you go through quiet
[44:28] seasons if we ever wonder about that we
[44:31] just have to turn to Hebrews 13 verses
[44:33] 20 and 21 because we see what the blood
[44:39] does for our daily works right so today
[44:43] you have the day off most you have the
[44:45] day off from work but tomorrow I got a
[44:46] work still at work from home but I still
[44:48] got to work but our daily works are
[44:51] taken care of by Christ's blood so
[44:54] Malachi Hebrews 13 20 and 21
[44:59] he's the prop again from the dead our
[45:00] Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the
[45:02] sheep through the blood of the
[45:04] everlasting covenant make you perfect in
[45:06] every good work to do his will we're
[45:08] giving you that we just won't easy to
[45:11] decide through Jesus Christ praise God
[45:16] now brother Branham pulls out this
[45:18] scripture he says notice it's the blood
[45:20] it's the blood of the everlasting
[45:22] covenant not the eternal right because
[45:27] we will not need blood in the New
[45:30] Jerusalem will we well we have to have a
[45:32] blood sacrifice we can say oh god I'm
[45:34] sorry
[45:35] no because we'll have new bodies death
[45:37] will be swallowed up in life
[45:39] praise God and are our greatest enemy
[45:42] who's our greatest enemy he'll be done
[45:45] away with is that the white throne
[45:47] judgement he'll be tossed in the lake of
[45:48] fire so you won't have a tempter anymore
[45:51] we'll have brand-new bodies that don't
[45:52] have sin nature so the new covenant is
[45:56] everlasting but not eternal because the
[45:58] Bible says the blood of the everlasting
[46:00] covenant church it will make us perfect
[46:04] in every good work to do his will so
[46:09] whether we're in a mountain top we see
[46:11] God doing great things
[46:12] signs miracles wonders or we're just in
[46:14] a valley we're still doing God's will
[46:18] because God takes us through mountains
[46:20] of valleys there's a time and season for
[46:22] everything and the blood is working in
[46:26] you and I that which is well pleasing in
[46:29] a sight so see the Covenant is gonna
[46:31] take care of you and I you and I should
[46:33] be so secure in the blood of Jesus
[46:35] Christ constantly confessing our sins
[46:37] trusting in the blood knowing that God
[46:39] has wiped away our sins because it's the
[46:41] blood or it's the Holy Spirit's life
[46:44] that is gonna daily help us to do what's
[46:51] well pleasing in God's sight praise God
[46:54] it'll lead us and guide us into all of
[46:57] God's perfect will all of his every good
[47:01] work right you'll go to work tomorrow
[47:03] you're stayed home you should do good
[47:05] works right we should do good things
[47:08] tomorrow right children chinnu evil
[47:10] works
[47:11] if the blood is with us in this covenant
[47:13] it will make us do good works right it
[47:16] will help us do good works because it's
[47:18] gonna make us do every good work to do
[47:21] God's will so see it's the perfect blood
[47:34] that makes our lives
[47:36] perfect perfect blood makes the
[47:39] worshiper perfect praise God
[47:41] just like job right is he Ana he had a
[47:44] perfect sacrifice for his dispensation
[47:47] his covenant in are a dispensation his
[47:49] covenant he had a perfect sacrifice God
[47:52] said he's perfect
[47:53] he met the requirements so you and I
[47:56] with a perfect blood it'll make the
[47:59] worshipers perfect because the Bible
[48:02] says he that his sacrifice sanctifies us
[48:08] he that was sanctified sanctifies us
[48:10] once and for all
[48:12] praise God so the sight of God were
[48:14] forgiven forever praise God amen
[48:19] now I want to read this in Hebrews 8:6
[48:21] I'll just read it
[48:23] Jesus's blood is a better covenant
[48:27] established upon better promises praise
[48:31] God I hope you've seen it in our last
[48:33] three sermons on the Bible covenants
[48:35] each covenant got better and better
[48:37] didn't it each one got better and better
[48:40] and here this is an even better covenant
[48:44] than Moses's covenant this is the even
[48:47] better covenant than David's covenant
[48:49] this covenant is gonna make everything
[48:52] we do every work we do it'll make it
[48:55] work together to be well pleasing in the
[48:58] sight of God it's because the token
[49:01] because the token is not something
[49:04] outside like the rainbow is not even
[49:09] something under our clothes we'd say
[49:11] like the male circumcision it's not
[49:12] something like that we said it's not
[49:14] something outside is not something under
[49:16] it's something inside praise God inside
[49:19] the soul of the believer praise God
[49:24] now because it's based upon better
[49:27] promises there is a greater
[49:29] responsibility for this covenant member
[49:31] jesus said that he said there's there's
[49:35] greater punishments for those Pharisees
[49:38] and Sadducees who rejected his ministry
[49:40] then even for Sodom and Gomorrah
[49:42] remember that because a greater than
[49:45] Solomon is here
[49:46] so each covenant had greater and greater
[49:48] promises so much so that Jesus says it's
[49:54] gonna be worse off for the Pharisees and
[49:57] Sadducees and unbelievers who rejected
[49:59] him
[49:59] then even Sodom and Gomorrah now Hebrews
[50:03] 10:29 I read this will go for about five
[50:07] five or ten more minutes here let me set
[50:09] the timer Hebrews 10:29 may God help us
[50:24] to to rejoice in this new covenant look
[50:29] what it says that there's what scripture
[50:31] warns to those who don't take the
[50:32] covenant very seriously Hebrews 10:29 of
[50:38] how much sorer punishment suppose ye
[50:42] shall he be thought worthy who hath
[50:45] trodden under foot the Son of God and
[50:49] hath counted the blood of the Covenant
[50:52] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[50:56] thing and hath done despite unto the
[51:01] spirit of grace okay so people that
[51:05] disobey grace people that reject grace
[51:09] people that reject God's commands in the
[51:12] New Covenant are considering God's blood
[51:16] covenant and unholy thing it's not
[51:18] sacred it's not special they're saying
[51:21] you know alcohol is more special than
[51:23] God's covenant they're saying being
[51:25] married two or three times is more
[51:27] special than God's covenants what
[51:29] they're saying they're counting the
[51:30] blood of the Covenant and unholy thing
[51:32] it's not a special thing it's not a
[51:34] sacred thing to them
[51:37] and how sad that is but the Bible said
[51:39] how much more punishment will they get
[51:41] because it's a covenant with better
[51:43] promises so there's a greater
[51:45] responsibility to respond to the
[51:48] Covenant and receive it this covenant is
[51:52] so powerful God's spear is gonna cause
[51:55] men to go all around the world to preach
[51:58] this good news to every nation God won't
[52:00] let this this world end until every
[52:04] nation has heard the good news of this
[52:06] new covenant praise God that's Matthew
[52:09] 24:14 and this gospel of the kingdom
[52:11] shall be preached in all the world for a
[52:14] witness unto all nations and then shall
[52:17] the end come praise God and that's
[52:20] because God has appointed a day where
[52:23] he's gonna judge all men by Jesus Christ
[52:26] acts 17:31
[52:28] because he hath appointed a day in which
[52:30] he will judge the world in righteousness
[52:33] by that man whom he hath ordained
[52:37] whereof he hath given assurance unto all
[52:40] men in that he hath raised him from the
[52:44] dead now look at that church Bible said
[52:47] God gave every man the assurance that
[52:50] he's going to judge them all by raising
[52:53] Christ from the dead so see the fact
[52:56] that these plants raised from the dead
[52:58] or they go down under they come back up
[53:01] that's a sign of the resurrection God
[53:04] said God says he's let every man know
[53:07] that he's raised Christ from the dead so
[53:09] all these things in nature speak of God
[53:12] raising his son from the dead and
[53:14] there'll be no excuses on that day
[53:16] according to acts 17:31
[53:21] as we're finishing up here the token of
[53:24] this covenant is the baptism of the Holy
[53:26] Ghost
[53:27] praise God it's the seal of God in the
[53:30] soul of the believer
[53:31] so God marks the believers soul with
[53:34] Abraham he marked just the men's bodies
[53:37] with Noah he just marked the sky right
[53:42] temporarily every now and then you'd see
[53:45] it with Moses he just marked them one
[53:47] time by sprinkling them with blood but
[53:50] here
[53:51] a positive covenant he gives an
[53:53] indwelling token praise God he gives
[53:56] them a eternal sign in their souls
[53:59] praise God that's the power of this this
[54:03] token of the new covenant praise God and
[54:07] this has spoken three times it's called
[54:10] a seal three times we're familiar with
[54:13] Ephesians 4:30 but it's also Ephesians
[54:15] 1:13 and here's when we don't read too
[54:18] much Lydia can you get this one 2nd
[54:21] Corinthians 1:22 this is one we're not
[54:24] really maybe familiar with I'm not as
[54:27] familiar with it because we often just
[54:29] quote Ephesians 4:30 but 2nd Corinthians
[54:33] 1:22 causes a seal as well so that he
[54:41] whenever you're ready 2nd Corinthians
[54:42] 1:22 amen praise God so God has sealed
[54:52] us and given us the earnest which is a
[54:54] downpayment so church you and I if we
[54:56] have eternal life imagine that it's just
[54:58] a portion of eternal life there's a lot
[55:00] more praise God it's just a downpayment
[55:03] just a portion but there's so much more
[55:05] for us to enjoy by the grace of God amen
[55:13] all right so the life of the animal
[55:18] sacrifices all the way since Adam and
[55:20] Eve when they left the Garden of Eden
[55:21] could never come upon them but now the
[55:24] life of the sacrifice Jesus Christ can
[55:27] come upon you and I praise God remember
[55:32] this new covenant was first sent to
[55:34] Israel but when they rejected it the
[55:37] Bible said they were blinded and so it
[55:40] is today any person who chooses not to
[55:42] believe it
[55:42] spiritual blinders get put over their
[55:45] heart right Paul says what that veil
[55:48] over their heart is done away in Christ
[55:51] when they say I don't believe that and
[55:54] if all religions are the same a veil a
[55:57] blindness goes over their heart they
[56:00] don't feel what you and I feel for
[56:02] Christ and for Christian
[56:05] remember God promised he foreknew
[56:08] Israel's failure and he promised to have
[56:11] mercy on them but just like the story of
[56:14] Joseph in the Old Testament God was
[56:16] gonna blind the Brethren and through the
[56:19] blindness he was going to save the
[56:20] Gentiles right God saved the nation of
[56:23] Egypt through Joseph praise God and God
[56:29] promised to return to blinded Israel and
[56:32] give her another chance to receive the
[56:35] New Covenant and that will take place
[56:37] shortly after the rapture of the Gentile
[56:40] bride which we believe were a part of by
[56:43] the grace of the Lord in closing here
[56:47] revelation 4 revelation 14:1 2:5 says
[56:52] that Jesus Christ will stand with
[56:56] 144,000 guileless guiltless Jews on
[57:00] Mount Zion which from what I understand
[57:03] is the tallest mountain or the highest
[57:06] mountain in the city of Jerusalem which
[57:09] can be seen today he's gonna stand with
[57:12] them and they'll be reunited that's when
[57:16] Israel will receive this new covenant
[57:19] that we have right now this mountaintop
[57:22] experience is of course before that it's
[57:25] preceded by Jesus revealing his identity
[57:27] to Israel it will cause them to mourn in
[57:31] anguish upon realizing they crucified
[57:36] their Messiah and they'll go from house
[57:38] to house crying and weeping after they
[57:42] realized what they've done to their
[57:44] Messiah let's read that it's been a long
[57:46] time since we read that Zechariah 12:10
[57:49] so Malachi can you get zechariah 12:10 I
[57:54] try to turn there as well before this
[57:56] wind picks up and blows my Bible some
[57:59] other place Zechariah 12:10
[58:16] so we want to show this how God returns
[58:20] to Israel in the New Covenant
[58:22] right now they're blinded because they
[58:24] turned it down but after the rapture of
[58:27] the Gentile bride God will graph back in
[58:30] Israel give them another chance and that
[58:32] merciful and that's so gracious they
[58:34] turned it down so God cuts him off but
[58:37] then after he's done with the Gentiles
[58:38] he grafts him back in and gives him
[58:41] another chance a second chance to
[58:43] receive it zechariah zechariah Krays god
[59:12] so that's where a spirit of grace gets a
[59:16] pour poured upon them and they mourn in
[59:18] bitterness verse 11 in that day there
[59:21] should be a great mourning in Jerusalem
[59:22] as the morning of hey Dad remand in the
[59:26] valley of Megiddo verse 12 and the land
[59:31] shall mourn every family apart the
[59:34] family of the house of David apart and
[59:36] their wives apart the family of the
[59:38] house of Nathan apart and their wives
[59:40] apart the family of the house of Levi
[59:42] apart and their wives apart the family
[59:45] of shamea apart and their wives apart
[59:48] all the families that remain every
[59:51] family apart and their lives apart right
[59:53] so they're younger twelve tribes all
[59:56] party up but even have the brothers
[59:58] mourning in a separate place and the
[1:00:00] sisters verse 1 of chapter 13 in that
[1:00:04] day there shall be a fountain opened to
[1:00:08] the house of David and to the habitants
[1:00:10] of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness
[1:00:14] praise God
[1:00:16] what a beautiful promise so this is the
[1:00:19] new tusks new testament new come
[1:00:21] being brought back a second chance given
[1:00:25] to God's people because remember he said
[1:00:27] I won't forget you he said if you can
[1:00:29] measure the heavens then I'll forget he
[1:00:30] said but no man no man can measure the
[1:00:32] heavens praise God
[1:00:34] he said if day and night stops I'll
[1:00:35] forget Israel but day and night keep
[1:00:38] going don't they they're perpetual and
[1:00:40] just as God keeps these beautiful
[1:00:42] covenants out here so God will give
[1:00:44] Israel another chance at the new
[1:00:47] covenant praise God when's this when
[1:00:52] this happens they'll weep and they'll
[1:00:54] cry they'll repent and the Bible says
[1:00:56] the nation will be born in one day
[1:00:58] Isaiah 66 as a nation will be born in
[1:01:01] one day after they weep and mourn
[1:01:03] they'll be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:04] a church that ought to be a good lesson
[1:01:06] for us if we want to be born again we
[1:01:08] have to weep and cry and mourn over our
[1:01:11] sins don't we the RAM so you have to
[1:01:13] have a boohoo experience you got a
[1:01:15] boohoo it out you got to cry and be
[1:01:17] sorrowful for your sin and then God
[1:01:19] he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:21] and fire praise God hallelujah last
[1:01:25] scripture Romans 11:26 and 27 Paul
[1:01:30] shares the scripture and shows that
[1:01:33] Israel all of Israel be saved all the
[1:01:37] predestinate of Israel all that all the
[1:01:39] Israel that God foreknew in his mind the
[1:01:42] 144,000 all of them shall be saved and
[1:01:45] so all Israel shall be saved as it is
[1:01:49] written there shall come out of Sion the
[1:01:51] deliverer and shall turn away
[1:01:53] ungodliness is my covenant unto them
[1:01:57] when I shall take away their sins so see
[1:02:02] the new covenant began at Jesus's death
[1:02:05] and resurrection right he had to pay the
[1:02:07] price with his blood then he had to
[1:02:10] raise from the dead and then it ends
[1:02:14] this new covenant probably ends at the
[1:02:17] white throne judgment because blood for
[1:02:20] forgiveness is no longer needed
[1:02:22] that's because death hell Satan have all
[1:02:26] been cast in the lake of fire sin is
[1:02:30] forever defeated praise God
[1:02:33] let's sing a little song here freeze gun
[1:02:42] let's just uh God God God God by his
[1:03:21] word our God our God ring he's alive and
[1:03:34] he's alive
