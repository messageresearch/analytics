this morning praise the lord the uh brother heard brother amen say something about resurrection morning this is wherever they finished everything right here it was finished on the cross but when he rose that sealed the deal it's over now he's alive and well and uh he's proven in all of our lives and he's exactly what he said he was and he's going to fulfill everything he promised as i heard long ago uh in the uh maybe communist countries uh they would have checkpoints for people visiting and church was illegal back then or at that time and a lady was heading to a underground service and the guard asked her where are you going she goes i'm heading to hear about it to see what's in the will the reading of the will was uh today and uh he's like okay so when he was gonna check her when she come back and uh they got done with service they come back and the guard's like so what'd you get in your will she goes i got everything the saints of god this is our will today and we get it all yeah i'll take that absolutely and i have not seen we have heard what good things he has prepared for those that love him how much do we love him today we appreciate him holy good seeing all the saints faithful warriors and precious soldiers singers man i heard some children out here tearing it up brother ape uh brother jose was there a wonderful song special video and all them singing their hearts out praise the lord so uh let's uh get right into the word here today um i wanna as always i i just kind of teach and uh and saints said one thing i you know in the when you're battling in the word when you're going sword versus sword iron versus iron as it sharpens one another um as you know there's uh some that i would say like this not only have left the message uh in that sense but left the doctrine and as uh i've kind of went back and forth and back and forth and i'll tell you what saints the lord's opened up some tremendous and revelations to me uh i was battling a little bit there on a certain topic and and i think to god maybe lord willing i'll teach this next time but i understand i really believe i understand uh the taking of the book what was that the breach i really believe i understand why that breach had to happen that day when the seals were opened and the lamb came and took that book and it was revealed i really believe i think we've got a grasp on it by god's grace maybe we'll teach that next time um but i'm going to continue on to something lord willing that i've been ministering on for a while even at home and i've shared quite a few here but greater understanding this is i'm actually going to reteach something i thought probably six or seven years ago but now i have a greater understanding of a real what we're dealing with here you know what why is the way things they are and i like to have more knowledge and just a true understanding because if you have a true understanding of something you can actually explain it simply amen and you can actually tell someone about it and witness and and you can have confidence because you have a full revelation of it um anyhow let's start in genesis 12. i don't want to keep you guys holding too long we have two poor passions the scripture about this long i will go on the next one here shortly and uh genesis 12 verse 1 through 7 it says and the lord said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i was shooting and i'll make of thee a great nation and i'll bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing we only be blessings here to others it's nice to be blessed but when you bless someone else saints of god that'll go eternal and i'll bless them the blessing and curse him that curses thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was 75 years old when he departed of iran and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran or haran how we gonna say it and they went forth into the land of canaan into the land of canaan they came and abram passed through the land and the place of sichuan citrum under the plain of moray unto the and the canaanite was then in the land and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there he builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him let's read one more passage of scripture in mark 12. i kind of want to jump there god bless your souls for traveling this far i know we got some very long drivers here and of course the the very close uh soldiers that uh god bless you all this morning we see mark 12 verse one and he began to speak unto them by parables a certain man planted a vineyard and set a hedge about it and build it and dig the place for the wine fat and build a tower and set it out and let it out to husbandman and went into a far country and as the season and at the season he sent to the husbandman a servant that he had might receive from the husband of the fruit of the vineyard and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty and again he sent unto them another servant and and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled and again he sent another and him they killed and many others some beating and killing some having yet therefore one son his beloved he sent him also last on him saying they will reverence my son but those husbands said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours so they took him and killed him and cast them out of the vineyard what shall therefore the lord the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husband and give the vineyard unto others so let's say a word of prayer dearly father lord jesus lord you know that this was uh one of those one of these things lord has just been on my heart lord and just been a real blessing for me to see lord to understand and a little greater a little bit further lord lord jesus we just pray lord that you would bless these people god lord lord i'm not here to to be anything in the lord or to do anything lord outside of the lord i want to be a blessing lord god and i want you to bless the service lord for be your will lord which we know it is lord and lord we just lord yield ourselves forward to you god and lord may you have your way lord with the people god we love you so much lord bless the soldiers lord this is your bride god and lord god we're just here lord to prevent to uh present a meal lord that you gave me lord that is actually for them lord and lord we just love you so much we'll bless people god in the name of jesus christ amen you may have your seats so one thing you know when you there's within the the framework of the church you know we know there's two spirits there's the true and the faults the spirit of god and the spirit of the antichrist and what are they warring for they're warring for the bride right they're this and though they're the people stand up here this could be the the clergy or those fivefold ministries and then there's the laity but remember everything that is revealed to a a a a five-fold is actually given to you it's for this for you to feast on us for you to understand it's for you to grasp this is this we're in a way we're just chefs we're just chefs the food comes in here it's it's come at a lot of times at night the guy the semi guy drives in there you know and he's unloading and and then the guy's receiving the back and they're just separating this and this and sorting it business and then they wake up early in the morning some of them not necessarily me i'm more of those late night guys that prepares the food before the day before and then the chef will get it you know he'll make it a certain way just have it on the pots bowling and as soon as that store is open or that business is open then the customer sees everything is for you and what's it supposed to do for you i just saw a brother cam just showed me a tremendous quote last night he said the laity is in control you control everything he said the pastor's the head he says but the laity is in control of everything or supposed to be if there is a problem in this church in the laity the laity should deal with it should start calling it out and confront the person or confront this this or this or this and sort it without within themselves though the past to be the head and the pastor may want to oversee the saints of god you are the keepers yes absolutely i thought i'd share that because to me that's tremendous we have to that's why that's why who keeps this church clean than the nine spiritual gifts what from the from the laity we're supposed to get in the in the spirit and speak in tongues and then someone's supposed to interpret and call out this and call out that and get everything just right absolutely it's a it's a high we we've got to really come into this because remember program said over and over again he said the local assembly would have the local body would have these nine spiritual gifts does our church have them no but saints of god we desire them we're hungering and thirsting after those things absolutely so anyhow we want to get into this study um and saints of god is we got to pray for my nephew last night and got to share on baptism we got to share on being filled with the holy ghost we got to got to share between father and son i had them in the room just them guys and we got to share about baptism wise and foolish virgin saints of god it is coming down and who cares about next football season st is gone we might our money might be nothing let me let me tell you like this i'm building an apartment right now for somebody and what are the uh what two two and a half dollars could buy a year ago won't even buy two of it or or or or one of them even today a piece of lumber or two by four by eight is 750 right now seven dollars and fifty cents it was two dollars or less a year and a half ago in some spots what does that mean our money has lost one two thirds of its value almost it let's let's just be real real we can't it's coming exact everything that prophet said is coming and we're seeing it you know it's in our faces right now and yet our even be but the effects of the world and how stall our dolled our senses and we just really haven't really woken up yet to it to where we're praying all night and witnessing and we're living to the lord and doing everything we can for the kingdom anyhow i just wanted to share that and because i'm seeing it as i'm building and how much money i'm spending i'm spending two or three times more than what i thought i would have to spend it was costing the lord allowed that and it's something you just i just have to do because i'm in that the lord allowed him so here's what i'm going to teach down here by the great gods of grace we're going to continue on the trail of the serpent and uh with the sub-topic of war on the meek so we want to get into this by god's grace uh trail of the serpent what is what is why why what's coming down here uh we know how the nicolaitans come in we know all that from 2000 years ago we know we're working those things but uh i want to kind of hit a certain thing here and you'll see it at the end how clear it is what is what is going on um of course there's many areas that things are going on but i want to hit the specific reason why this is coming so let's let's get into this here now and we read this beginning here in genesis 12 1 here god now appears to abram right and he says he says boy he says if you will pack up he says if you leave mom and daddy if you leave all your family he says i'm going to bless you tremendous and what does he do he brings his nephew along right and that broke the word right there that was so he was not supposed to do that what god came down in vision or spirit form or however and he said he says boy he says i want you and your wife to leave and yet here abraham goes back i'm sure he tells his family says i'm going going and something anoints a lot and says i want to go to and abraham uh unaware he says he allows it and sure enough here he comes and you know the story from there but remember there was a reason for these things sure all our mistakes god is going to make them work out for his good and for his glory absolutely even for your good sure he says so here he says but what's up what's the whole point of this he's calling someone out to receive some land something that god has promised him an inheritance absolutely he's promised him something uh that he's going to give him and abraham sure he says absolutely he says i met god now remember that changed him now when god when god appears to someone or they i was like this even a feeling of the holy ghost they know that god is real absolutely and that there is a spirit there is an invisible person there is an invisible spirit that now is like dwelling within you and you have met him and come face to face and now there's something that in you that knows that this is a real move that this is a real situation that this thing is actually real absolutely he says the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land absolutely so now here's the the promise now when mo when abraham went and had his name changed and he traveled here to egypt and back over here and back to egypt and here over there did he receive thy land no but the promise was to him and to his seed absolutely but there has to come a time where he would actually receive it sure uh now as god is now dealing with abraham here before abram he says now he's that god actually prophesies he says he says he says you really aren't going to see this land you've been in this land you've dwelt in this land you actually have you bought a po a portion of this land uh uh from the the sons of hath he says he says he says but your children he says your children great great great great he says they're all he's they're actually going to receive this land he says and they shall afflict them 400 years so here is going to be over 400 year plus going down the line he says but he says but eventually he says your seed will inherit this land sure uh now as we continue on here um in verse 18 he says unto thy seed have i given this land and from the river of egypt unto the great river the river of euphrates absolutely so all these promises of inheritance all these promises of the land sure uh now what kind of land is this here in exodus 3 and 8 he says he says i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them out of the land unto a good land and a large he says until a land flowing with milk and honey saints of god and thinks about this is the type what what was that land moving they were moving into it was a type of the holy ghost absolutely it was a time of the move of god which is the book of acts absolutely it was it was exactly what god had in his mind naturally which we receive what spiritually sure now but remember as they were to travel this land they had many many battles and saints of god that you god is not going to give you something easy he's going to make you fight for it you have to struggle part of i was like this you meet someone with good character it's because either number one god imparted it or gave them to him or they had to go through many many many trials if you look at the prophet of god he says he says you think this gift's easy he says but if you actually knew what i had to go through he said the kind of life that god makes me live the kind of experiences i have to have the sufferings that i have to have and he's even mentioned over the pulpit a lot of the things that he had to go through he said he wouldn't even speak of them but why it was to mold his character to make it more sincere to more humble i heard a story one time where someone asked sister uh meaty before she passed what kind of man was brother brandon and this is just second hand but i heard that he's that she said that he was the kind of guy that if someone was behind him and he was going down the stairs and they would push him down the stairs and he would fall that he would get up and say are you okay cared nothing for himself he only wanted the divine will of jesus christ and what in that kind of mindset as he's tumbling and maybe taking a tumble here this and god bless him you know in that kind of scenario he would not snap his attack or become injured or whatever he would get up and his mind would be like what was wrong what kind of demon made that man do that and he would be more concerned about what kind of spirit because he know that was not that man man men want to be happy men want to be joyful they want to prosper they want they want they have children and and food and all those they want to be just like everyone else but what made that man do that to me see it's a spirit everything is spirit we wrestle not against flesh and blood but by powers and principalities and those sort of things so we have to have the mindset why did that man do that or that sister do that and we know it's a spirit a demonic influence sure absolutely but that's the kind of character we must have in this hour especially in this hour no no not knowing who's who but what that but we know that everyone is influenced by one or two spirits amen and one of the things i heard just brother graham say the other day how do we know what a true christian is now the bible says in mark 16 he says he says these signs shall follow them that are filled the holy ghost no those that believe see because matthew 7 said he said lord lord have we not done this and have we not what they believe the gospel they believe the effects of the preaching of the word and the anointing and they get the same results as the true but jesus said you'll know them by their fruits amen sure absolutely we're going to go we're going to go through that a little bit today as well amen so but now to receive to get it to get this this kingdom i was like to get this land they wanted they had to fight they had to go to war strategy they had to put their life on the line before someone going to battle they they i mean this this is a psychological thing you have to know you this might be your last day i've never been in a battle never been to war i'm not a military man i tried to go in the military the lord shut it down but as i'm as i would imagine someone going out loading their rifle getting their their gear on their arm or this and that they're going out their constant thought says what was it like to taste the steak what was it like to kiss their wife when they left what was it like to do this and this knowing that could be their very last time they ever do it on this side it's real those are real things absolutely and it's just uh i was like this it's just like any other thing it's real life your life is not easy now i want to go into this here by god's grace and hope this will be a blessing notice here in psalms 24 verse 7 he says lift up your heads oh ye gates and be lifted up the everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in he says who is the king of glory he says the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle right amen god is a soldier jesus christ is a warrior absolutely who is who was the greatest war general ever was jesus christ in the flesh amen he waged a spiritual war against the devil's kingdom and he never lost the battle amen he never lost the one that was given to him absolutely did he lose jesus absolutely but judas was what born the son of perdition he says all for the father's give me he says i'll not lose one and what he went to battle because this is not a natural thing this is a spiritual thing saints of god we have to want free our brothers and sisters who are still under bondage lord show brother amen where this soul this scene is brother bang with this scene brother john and when this seed is absolutely brother jose where are these these sisters where are the seeds of god that you can release that god can use you to free amen in this battle this war because the enemy has strangled the enemy has wrapped many of our brothers and sisters who we don't even know might not even be in this church yet that is supposed to be right here and god can't do nothing until they get right here remember everything has to be in place when the when the holy ghost came down the day of pentecost all hundred and twenty had to be in position amen i believe you praise me to god amen and i believe you're gonna see a move of god right here when every person that is supposed to be here is here amen and now say to god we must catch this mentality amen we must catch this revelation that we have to have our brothers and sisters amen amen we cannot take a rapture with just with all of them except one what jesus said he's going to leave the 99 just to go get that one hey man and that's our mentality let's say i say it like this brother bang may call brother uh amen and say brother i need this but brother a bang may say brother hold on i can't come i believe the lord is leading me to this man over here or to this sister over here and it might look like a complete heathen they might be they might we must forsake each other sometimes amen but even though we must take care of each other first we got to take care of the house of god first those in this house absolutely but but there is time where god is going to call you out to go and rescue someone absolutely sure praise be to god yeah amen sure now here in exodus 15 1 then saying moses and the children of israel the song unto the lord and said he says saying i will sing unto the lord that he hath triumphed gloriously who won these battles as the moses came out who did all these who won who brought the plagues it was god almighty amen he says the horse in his river has he thrown into sea saints of god they did absolutely nothing here moses just held out his staff god sent in the powerful winds dried the ground had the waters up they walked through turned back and the waters fell i mean they did absolutely nothing but by this by this one they could say moses he didn't start preaching sermon he started singing amen man the lord is a man of war wait a second god he did not destroy the priesthood of the egyptians he destroyed the military of the egyptians and they were the most technical the most skilled the most advanced what warriors of that day you look at our day and they they're decked out and they got like 10 different eye things here and they can see through walls and they that is nothing the bible says the lord is a man of war and the lord is his name amen praise be to god he did that he'll he'll win your battles for you you just put them on the scene say lord this mountain's right in front of me or that's the person's business or that or you you you don't talk about it you talk to the lord jesus christ about it amen and he will make a way yes sure pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea who did that god warrior oh your god absolutely sure he says that his chosen captains are drowned into the the greatest captains under pharaoh he says they're long gone all their military knowledge and might gone and now they're having a jubilee on the other side [Laughter] he says thy right hand oh lord has become glorious in power he says thy right hand the lord has dashed in peace is the enemy he showed right there ain't no one can step before god almighty they are the creation i am the creator [Laughter] i give life and i can take life amen we're not dealing with an average man we're dealing with god amen yes sure excuse me sorry now as we're dealing with the mighty man of war i want to show you i taught this probably six seven years ago brother amen may remember this i don't know but i have a better clearer understanding of this i hope this is a blessing because the revelations lord give me i i like him and he gives me certain revelations because that's that's what i like i don't know i might not know about this one but this brother can preach that but it might not mean so much to me or what but he just gives me stuff i like you know i just hope you like it too sure absolutely so here in deuteronomy 20 he says now here this is a battle chapter this is a warrior's chapter these are laws and certain things that can pertain to war okay oh thank you soldier thank you i don't do this story often praise the lord thank you he says but when thou goest out to battle these are specific things we must obey these are certain things and you'll see as we go for those who haven't heard this yet you're going to see some things right here that this to me this is beautiful in fact i had to wait i had to do a sunday school on a sunday morning at like 9 00 a.m and i had nothing at midnight and i sat there and sat there and i waited and waited and i said lord i need something to feed your children and i waited until two or three in the morning and then he dropped this sometimes you just got to wait on god yeah and i'll see i'm one of those guys that the the semi comes in it's like two or three in the morning and i have to unload it and this then i get so that that's me it's not no no i wouldn't i won't go to bed at eight o'clock and wake up at two that makes no sense to me i'll just stay up and then he says when thou goes out to battle against thy enemies he says and see his horses and chariots and people more than thou be not afraid of them so the first thing in war you can't be scared you cannot fear the enemy i don't care if they have 10 different guns and knives and decked out and everything they're carrying 150 pounds is just complete click and destruction it doesn't matter don't be scared of them i don't care how tall they are you can't be scared of trust me i've dealt with some big boys yeah you can't be scared he says and when thou seest horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee which they brought thee up out of the land of egypt what he reminds them remember what i did you had nothing to do with this god could take all credit he said remember what i did yeah i'm still that guy that did all that he's i'm still with you yes sure he says and it shall be when thou come as night unto the battle and they get real close and you start to see all the enemy that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people as they as the priests would come notice these are not these are not warrior like you would think but he god actually caused the priesthood up before battle and the priest would go before him and say guys see them over there see them see everything they got horses chariots you see all that why because if they're that close to the battle the battle is certain to happen but the priest must go through certain things before the battle starts to make sure the people are ready there are certain things god wanted to see take place before the battle ensued before you put your lives on the line and what does he do he reassures them number one hero israel hero spiritual israel you approach this day into battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be terrified because of them because saying it beforehand is one thing but when they see the enemy and the great with all the fearless and here that may be chanting and stomping and making the ground rumble you could start a fear could start making someone scared so he has to reassure them don't be scared he says for the lord your god is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you so he says don't be scared and once he sees the people are not scared he has to go through three things now we're going to see these three things and the officer shall speak in people saying what man is there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it warriors anyone build a house here and you have not dedicated your house to god he says you don't even need to go out right now he says let him go and return to his house lest he die in battle and another dedicate it that's one thing now i like what gill says he says that he has built a new house and not dedicated it he says it is evident that it was a custom in israel to dedicate a new house to god with prayer he says praise and thanksgiving and this was done in order to secure the divine presence and blessing he says no for no pious nor sensible man could imagine that he could dwell safely in a house that was not under immediate protection of god real islam our israelites know that we need god we need jesus christ in our house amen we need his protection his providence we need everything he has amen amen so at the time of dedication among the jews besides prayer and praise a feast was made to which the relations and neighbors were invited something of this custom is observed in some parts of our own country in which it is called the house warming and the warming of the house you go ahead like let's say someone gets married they go get it they get together and they rent for a little bit and they go buy a house and they say oh let's come over for a housewarming and just celebrate that we have a place to live they call around [Laughter] and the wife will be decorating this and decorating that the man's i'm sure making sure they have two bathrooms running and uh do what men do or whatever and just maybe sit on the couch when so that's what married couple yeah something of this custom is observed in some parts of the house called the house warming jesus but in these cases the feasting is only kept up in what america in laodicea come have a housewarming and what do they do what do we do housewarming we may bring presents like oh congratulations brother praise god i love i love the place absolutely hey man praise brown brother that's just i just like how you did this and did that and then we'll be bringing the uh uh a famous dave is with steak and barbecue and all those things we started eating have a good time and we're just all just joking around us that two or three four five six seven hours later then we saw a pirate go home and that was the house for me but the real way a housewarming is supposed to play pray he says he says the prayer and the praise is forgotten thanking god for all that he's done for us so that the dedication appears to be rather more to bacchus then to jehovah the author of every good and perfect gift without praise to the lord jesus christ it means nothing saints of god in everything we do whether in word or indeed must be in the name of the lord jesus christ we must praise him and give him the glory and respect uh the sincerity the the and just let him know how worthy he is and how thankful for we saints of god we all has anyone missed a meal lately because they didn't have any money struggling anyone seriously just barely i mean it's great i mean i think everybody got their buying checks [Laughter] [Music] now if he had lately built or purchased a new home and has not taken possession of it not dedicated that made a sound uh festival for the entanglement of his friends that came to him to welcome him to his house let him go home and take comfort of that which the lord has blessed him with remember try it think about this um you know how long it took me one i built a house it took me a year i labored and labored siding roofing uh uh plumbing uh uh i didn't do the electrical um painting finishing work all that flooring however we if there's a lot of work into it imagine a man just finished his house and the captain of jerusalem or israel says boys we got a war and the guy's going [Laughter] i'm tired anyhow where's my sword i don't even where it's at maybe it's in the attic but notice why they tell these guys to go back home if they built the house and not dedicated it he says go take comfort of that which god bless and bless him with until by enjoying it for some time he become less fond of it for those who have new vehicles even if they're new use which is mostly my i've never had a new vehicle i've always had new use but when you get that new used vehicle wow you get in you're like oh it smells good in here oh that's clean and that's clean and all everything's clean and smelly and everything works actually you know windows go up and down it don't stop here there or you know there's cracks here you can hear this thing rattling and but it's new but give it a month or two or a year jump in the cars fill the uh i i like when i travel i buy those uh fritos flavor twists for snacking and just today i saw one down in the cracks of the scene i'm like i might get that later but what i'm saying is it gets old it gets you get used to it and it doesn't become so special he says for this he said he says and you become less fond of that house you just built labor he's and consequently less disturbed in the war by the thoughts of it remember trying to go into battle thinking man i want to enjoy my house and you're fighting and your mind on the house and someone comes out and takes you out they they god is looking for warriors that are sold out housing lands don't matter lord where's the enemy where's my lost brother where's my lost sister everything in the world is behind them they don't care lord show me lord help me to do exactly what me to do oh there's someone demon possessed cast them out blah blah blah or however someone needs help as soldiers we must be done with the things of the world he says and more willing to lie and leave it he says for this is the nature of all our worldly enjoyment that they that they please us best at first after a while they see the vanity of them you know that house i labored for you for a year after three years i lost that thing the old uh that housing market crashed and i ended up losing it you know what i think about houses anymore i don't even care about it you ever lose ever build a house spend an entire year of your life and this and energy this this to lose it saints of god there is no consider continuing city on this earth it means nothing anymore anything i get i realize this could be gone tomorrow if it's if it's natural things it's just natural it means literally nothing fighting over housing fighting over land and this or this it means nothing and you're gonna see why here a little bit now let's continue on here oh i gotta re-up here now let's read this here in uh in psalm 73 verse one he says a psalm of asaph he says truly god is good to israel even to such as our of a clean heart but as for me now notice david was struggling but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had high well and i slipped for i was envious of the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked saints of god whatever god has given you be content with it amen and as keeping this church clean if a brother or sister prosper be joyful for them within ourselves we want all of us to prosper we want all of us to be happy to be healthy to be strong spiritually to be strong naturally yes we want it all to prosper amen and it might not hit this brother or this sister at the same time they might come in different seasons but whatever season be happy for one another amen and saints of god as we see our spiritual rights getting less and less and you know one day we're going to have to let go of a lot of things very soon because what the mark of the beast is coming the economical world council of churches is coming and as we are bound and and band together and we see the heathen flourishing and taking those things and walking right into that and regaining housing regaining lands regaining i was like this jobs and prosperity don't you dare nbn why because at that time we're going somewhere beyond this place we are going to we are going we're going to receive exactly what our will said we would receive we're going to get it all we just have to suffer for just a brief moment i'm telling you saints when this stuff comes it's going to be so real it'll be i i really believe this is going to be if we can get that spirit and that stay in the atmosphere that it's going to be an easy walk i'll say it like that spiritually because we're going to see everything that prophet prophesied everything malachi 4 said is going to happen exactly and we're going to say there it is there it is there it is praise be to god we we are we we see it they don't see it but we can see it blessed are our eyes and our ears for they see it here amen amen absolutely he's but notice he says david said he says he says i was starting to slip because i what i started letting my heart get envious of the heathen making millions in the stock market by gamestop making millions and bitcoin who cares hey that stuff can go up and down there is nothing stable about bitcoin let me tell you if it's not the holy ghost it ain't stable amen yeah that's right that's right he's the only thing stable he's the only one that can hold things together amen sure yes ah let's continue on here and david goes on and on and why well they got this and they got that and he got this and david's like oh man if i could no no but then he comes to himself verse 14 for all the days long jesus i was plagued i've been plagued and chastened every morning he was hunted down by his own father-in-law hated by his own people he was anointed but if i say if i speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children for when i thought to know this it was too painful for me just how hard his life was and it wasn't hard it was absolutely hard until and something changed until i went into the sanctuary of god then i understood their end i went into the sanctuary of god then i understood their end let me tell you something about judgment how are they brought into desolation as in a moment god revealed to david that the heathen would be destroyed in a moment what by coming into the house of god to what comes in the house what comes to the sanctuary the hearing of the word see why i supposed to go to church well i'm envious of this and this but david had to go to church and hear exactly the judgments i wonder if david read this scripture let me tell you something the great tribulation when were those judgments set all the way back in job hashtag went into the trails of the snow the treasure of the snow or hashtag seeing the treasure of the hail he says the treasures of the hail he says which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war remember those hailstones are going to come down in the book of revelations 100 150 pounds each he said god already had him set up right here god knows the end from the beginning when was that flood set when was the judgment of the flood set as soon as enoch went up because then god started looking for one more righteous man and he found noah and assumed i was like this when did god know that noah was like this god had the dimensions of the ark already done and he gave the dimensions of that ark to noah 120 years before the judgments came right before the waters fell why because god knew no one else would be saved here he knows the end from the beginning it's already set it's already done sure now let me say it like this did jesus dedicate his house if jesus is a mighty warrior did he dedicate his house because we know in revelations 19 he comes to war jesus did not get a chance to dedicate his house he was murdered but here i believe this might be the dedication of his house before revelations 19. and i saw another sign in heaven and great and marvelous seven angels having the last seven plagues and then them is filled up the wrath of god and he goes on and on notice in verse 13 and verse 3 and they shall sing the song of moses what was that song of moses he had thrown the horse and the horse rider into the sea and those four horse riders of revelations and the seals he said he's gonna throw those into the sea the lake of fire oh hallelujah that's the truth they started singing that same song again he says we shall not fear thee oh lord he says he says who shall not fear thee oh lord and glorify thy name for only thou art holy and all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest yes he says then after i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle the heaven testimony in heaven was opened and the seven angels came out into the temple having seven plagues clothed in pure white linen having the breasts gold would go a breast girdle with golden girdles and one of the four beasts came unto the seven angels seven golden vials for the wrath of god who live for and ever and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god is this the dedication of the house of god because remember moses nine months to build the tabernacle in the old testament and at that last nine months they had everything in place everything was set in the glory of god at the dedication in the wilderness that temple the glory of god came and filled the house amen praise be to god and the same thing took place in solomon's day when david had stored up all the wood and stored up all the gold stored up all the silver and he started and solomon's son took over and started building that temple and what after they got everything was finished everything was set in place the glory of god came down once again in that temple and then what it was dedicated but this time the dedication takes place his house up there takes place yeah sure is this it sure let not your heart be troubled believe it ye believe in god believe also me in my father's house are many mansions if we're not so i would have i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you he is dedicating your place right now and not only that let me say like this each one of you is a vessel and when you repented you were getting you are the priest of your tabernacle of your vessel and when you repented god saw you were getting things in line and then he started working and cleaning you each up and getting you ready this and that and what he see that you were the priest of your temple but when that holy ghost came down and filled your vessel and filled your tabernacle and your temple what then what he knows right then he's dedicated you his house now for the all the service of the lord absolutely that's what the infilling of the holy ghost he's dedicating you amen sure he's showing that god has that god is going to use you absolutely amen right here he says he has uh he also has lively stones or build up a spiritual house amen a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices praises and glories to god holy acceptable lives he says to god by jesus christ amen here's another dedication the holy ghost comes down in this church and what these 120 were dedicated to god it's over finished now what's the next thing if a man build a house and he is not dedicated he's not supposed to go to war also and what man is he that planted remember the priest is going back captains the priests are going back and he's looking at the army he says he built a house he said you're dedicated go back he says if you planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it yet he says go back let him also return to his house lest he die in battle another man eat of it and that's absolutely scriptural if a man had been at great expense to plant a vineyard probably much like today ever the prices are higher inflation's sent in and it's very expensive to buy seeds anymore and buy them two by four posts and run them liars and set up he says and long to eat the fruit of it which he had for which the first three years he was forbidden to do by law so a man can plant a vineyard and then three years have to wait for it and at the end of three years we call the war he's like oh grapes and and tangelos and uh dragon fruit and i don't know what they got in israel but all these things definitely not durian there's no durian on there i'm sure of it maybe the queen fruit yes absolutely thailand nose no durian in that uh vineyard praise god he says now notice what was it considered he says for forbidden uh by law to do it let him alone to let him go home as if he had mine and gra and gratify to his own humor of the fruits of it see see how indulgent god is to his people in innocent things and how far from being a hard master wait a second god would rather if you labored right here god would rather you not have you go to war and you can enjoy the future labor instead of go and have a chance to die he wants you to enjoy what you've did you have to eat of it taste the fruits of your labor you labored all that and here's a god that says no you're not even worthy go and put your life on the line no he's not even he's that great of a god how kind and sweet is that because why you're by law by his own word you can't even for three years and he will not withhold you that fourth year amen what a wonderful savior we serve but now notice what the law says about that like i said and when you come into the land and have planted all manner of trees for food then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised notice how they put that word in uncircumcised three years shall it be uncircumcised unto you and it shall not be eaten of but in the fourth year all the fruit there ever shall be holy to praise the lord with all do you see the scripture in this do you see the spiritual moving application of this i'll say it like this what in type what is the vineyard jump to it he says and i will he says i will lay at waste verse six it shall not be pruned nor digged and there shall come up briars and thorns i will also command the clouds they rain uh they rain no rain upon it for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel jesus christ came to his vineyard he planted the vineyard and for three and a half years he counted as uncircumcised they did they were not allowed to have the holy ghost [Laughter] but remember he died in battle he died in battle he never got to eat of the fruits of the very vineyard of israel that he planted now why did he not get to eat the fruits we're going to show you a scripture here it is christ preaching the exact same thing and jesus spoke in the parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard there we are or israel southeast israel in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit there and found none then he sent her the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i kept seeking fruit of this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbersome to the ground god says i was hungry for it he says but there was no fruit on it three years he says no fruit he says cut it down but notice grace came in and he and he answered he said to him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well if not then after that we shall cut it down what'd they do god send in titus or nero however in 70 a.d and cut down that tree but christ has still not eaten of the fruit of the vineyard here's another thing as they would go back these ministers going back before the warriors before the camp he says if you take a house and you didn't dedicate it go back if you planted a vineyard for three years they have not eaten it head back then he says if you if there is a man that betrothed a wife and not not taken her let him go and return into his house lest he die in battle and another man take her so this man has a wife if a man's engaged to be married and he has not taken her he's not supposed to go to war and when a man taking a new wife he shall not go the war neither be charged with any business but he shall be free at whole one year and shall cheer up his wife which she has taken why does the rapture take place before revelations 19. [Laughter] one year jesus i'm taking three and a half years we're gonna have a wedding suffer for three and a half years am i praising god i didn't get you two thousand years ago he said but let me tell you something for three and a half years we're gonna eat and dying and worship and praise you're gonna praise me and you're gonna serve me man we're gonna have a glorious time up there he will get his wife but notice look what took place christ died in battle before he could actually go to war he was leading up to the great consummation of taking the entire place if christ would have not been killed he would have took it over why do you think we have to be taking the rapture because that bride knows what's hers and she would completely take this place over but that's not part of the plan these heathen have been heated so much and the cup of iniquity is so full that what god says boy it says he said woman he said come on now up here he says he says we're not we're not we're not fighting yet let i want to i want to judge these people first then i'm going to give you a house then i'm going to give you this but notice for i am jealous over you with the godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband then i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means he says as the serpent begotten eve through subtility notice christ came and left the virgin paul espoused a virgin to christ but what took place she was defiled is that scriptural absolutely deuteronomy 22 25 if a man be find and betroth dams on the field the field is the world if a man finds someone else's betrothed someone's else's uh a bestowed wife someone else's uh engaged with their wedding ring and everything on in the world and the man of forcer the god of force and lie with her defile her morally spiritually then the man only that lie with her shall die she doesn't die no why but the damsel thou shalt do nothing praise be to god and we can thank our forefathers now notice for as when a man rises up against his neighbor and slayeth him even so is this matter oh this man is a fuller wrath his husband he said you mess with my wife you're a dead man off with his head oh throw him in the lake of fire sure he says notices for he found her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried and there was none to save her did that first church age cry out the apostle paul said for three and a half years i warned you with tears and crying he says there's grievous wolves coming there's nicolaitans there's things they're going to do deeds are going to do to defile you and i've cried that lady would have taught and have taught i preached and i preached and they're coming and they're coming i'm telling you and paul went off the scene and sure enough they come in and defiled the very church to god had started they defiled christ's wife did she scream out absolutely in fact jesus said he heard her screams let me show you nevertheless i have somewhat against me christ's own words because thou has left thy first love why because someone came and defiled her remember therefore from thence thou art fall and repent and do the first works outside would come quickly and remove that cancer god's place except that repent he says but this thou has that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitan amen they they god heard they said we don't like the way you're doing this and we don't like to do that but there were so many of them they overcame them but god heard their voice and said we i know you hate the deeds he says and so do i he said they tried the apostles and they were apostles and he found out they were liars saints of god that early bride did their best and they called them out and called them out and called them out until what they finally and what god allowed it he was off the scene he had died in battle but now why did i was like this why did the bride get the file notice notice this scripture right this is beautiful everything in the bible is perfect deuteronomy 18 15 and it shall come to pass but thou shalt not hearken if thou are not hearken to the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which i command these days that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee what was one of the curses verse 30 thou shalt betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her thou shalt build the house and shall not dwell around now shall plant a vineyard and thou shall not and not gather the grapes throughout have christ done any of this yet no he was killed but he had planted a wife he had planted a vineyard and he was trying to prepare a house to get his house ready but he died and now this has taken taken him by storm right because what he was made a curse god that's why everything in the church ages happened the way it happened because christ became a he took all our curse of disobedience and when he took that on he knew he would lose his wife he knew he would not be able to finish his house and then he would not that he would not be taken of the fruits of the vineyard but we're not dealing with the normal man [Laughter] chase of god when you're dealing with the law you're dealing with god god does as he please i can come back to life again and take exactly what i lost praise you to god amen yes oh you know it's the truth you're not dealing with a mortal man even that very body of jesus christ that died and bled and rose again that same body is still alive on the throne amen but the greatest slap in the face is that he's waited this long to let the devil get what he deserved even he did not punish cain right away he did not punish satan right away god is a god of grace and mercy now brother why did you go through all that because i'm going to tell you why this is going on what is coming why are these tr why are these transgender people all like that there is a group select small group of people who who now whether they're more male where they're born female now within them is this feeling that they want their bodies changed what is that that is the anointing of the rapture scriptures the bible says behold i said that show you a mystery we shall not all die but we shall be changed we are promised a body change and it shows that that scripture is very anointing all that word is is hovered for thousands and thousands of years in this this area this arena as that word was spoken by paul as it was spoken by christ the anointing of it now is very close to come that's why we know we're at the point of the rapture because even the heathen are wanting a body change but notice the anointing that striking them is also striking us we want a body change but because the anointing is affecting the wrong vessel remember there's two kinds of people on the face of the earth there are in romans romans 9 there are vessels prepared for destruction and vessels prepared for glory two separate vessels and that anointing strikes both and it affects both differently why because one's carnal and the other one's spiritual [Laughter] yeah why is there i was like this we live in the world i see spider-man this and batman that and superman why are they pushing superheroes so much why is that just just coming like super people are coming in why it's a type of the bride the invincible but they say they'll be a super natural race they are going to be a people who can control the weather there are people who speak and things take place there are people who just believe something by faith and his strikes that lay hands where do all their powers come from their hands are shooting this or that and they touch things by the hands they lay on them and they're healed thanks to god see the the effects the anointing of what's everything we're seeing in the world think spiritually about it it's the anointing of what's ready to strike super super super heathens there's a real super and it's christ in his bride amen because all these superheroes got their power where's their pop our power is the holy ghost [Laughter] with fire hey man some of them got fired we got fire too everybody right here in the soul what was cape so same on it keeps our feet so praise be to god yeah now now here's christ revelation 19 he comes down for war he's already now remember this is revelation 19 when the rapture takes place well what right right around revelations before this revelation 4 revelations 5 4 right there where does israel restore revelations eleven hundred forty four thousand when is this when is house dedicated revelation 15 christ now has fulfilled everything he wanted to do now he can go to war but why is he going to war what is the war about he's already got his wife we're already going to be there saints we're going to be up there what's there to fight for what's this war about brethren why are they trying to dial in technology they literally can hunt down any single person and shoot a missile from 8 000 miles away and hit the exact pinpoint what are they what are they prepping for why they want this underground facility testing atoms they're looking for a power that can defeat god but what's the war for i'm going to show you it's about inheritance remember they were here first adam's feet did not take set on this ground to genesis 2. but all the animal the serpent was here genesis 1. already reproducing already building shanties already being intelligent doing things figuring things out and doing this and that they think it's theirs but who gets it when god arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth you know that's one word that god the bible uses as the defining or or describing the bride as meek good and upright is the lord therefore he will teach sinners in the way the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way what is meek what is a meek person what i mean the bible says that moses was the meekest man on the face of the earth but what is it what is the definition mild of temper well brother jose i remember when he hey if i do something to hurt your feelings please just come talk to me i will repent [Laughter] versailles you're not perfect i know i know tell me again i'll tell you i'm not again you messed up on this i sure did tell me one thing i've done good i can't name one either i'm a complete failure as my pastor say captain failure [Laughter] he says a mild of temper soft and gentle lamb sounds lamb or dove nature don't you think not easily provoked or irritated man hanging out with this sister is just gets under my skin hanging out with his brothers like [Laughter] as brother graham said what made moses so meek that hot temper ethiopian wife moses you didn't even sacrifice your boy i'm sorry not sacrifice but the circumciser boy on the eighth day she had to do it saved his life she was a hot tempered woman and he was just like how about think of this moses leading unconverted people and as the bible says our messenger says heathens majority were lost only two from the original group made it moses moses for 40 years he's walking i'm thirsty i'm hungry two thousand two million people lord could you just bring some water smack thank you moses thank you most thank you moses a week later fall on the pole fire i'm thirsty i'm hungry [Laughter] a lot of times so much let's start him moe's like oh god i'm old man i'm so tired [Laughter] and that complete that complete another drive will drive a man completely nuts and he did it with he there was so much on him that molded him and made him the meekest man that his father-in-law said you need some help get 70 helpers moses like thank you but after 40 years i'm thirsty i'm thirsty and it finally brought broke moses and he disobeyed the word of god and glorified himself because he did not speak to the rock he smoted twice and yet he was the meat he could take two million people i didn't hit it no no no drove them nuts but it made him me not easily they sinned against you lord lord jesus blood their mouth that's what he says blot me out and not them moses was in the presence of almighty god for 40 days and 40 nights in the presence of god and he could have said with the glow around his face kill them all what did he do he was remember he was a shepherd for 40 years too dumb absolute animals that do not obey god was god why do things why does it seem like this why does it seem like things in your life just don't go like you want to make you meek well this i just spit this and slow of anger maokai strumming on the guitar for the a man strumming the the the the the the guitar string snaps oh my goodness will they do that no small i know that's i'm not trying to find i'm saying those small little things don't let them get you hey when i'm and i'm in a sewer and i have to jump right into the sewer to work on a pipe and there's the good stuff praise the lord absolutely all that smells money [Laughter] we must become the meekest people on the face of the earth nothing will phase us well my nephew struggle on this or my uncle's struggling this this it doesn't matter what kind of cancer they got it doesn't matter what's going on in your life god's in control and god have mercy on all of them and lord if you want to block someone out me let them live because what we've been in the house of god we've been in the sanctuary and we know the end of these unbelievers you know what it's like not knowing what we understand and what we know what was revealed to us we don't know what it's like now we did if we i'd like this i knew what it was like well because i was an examination we knew nothing but i have something to compare it to i i i tell you what we are so blessed to be right here i'm telling you what you we had better think back think about where we came from what do we have now saints even from a year ago how much more in the world do we understand how much more do we trust in god right now how much more has he blessed us this year than even last year he's kept us there are people falling away and not even believing this word anymore and they believe it for 20 30 40 years don't even believe cain was of the servant they think cain was of adam's son no scripture for it none but only the meek what does the bible say the meek will inherit the earth the meek will inherit those that are have no temper or mild temper that are soft and gentle not easily produced yielding given to forbearance under injuries he hurt me praise the lord thank god it was me that got hurt and not them that's who gets the inheritance brother that's a tall order just yield all you gotta do is like lord you're in full control i know it well this just happened it doesn't matter god's in control it doesn't matter god's in control how many have you been in your life with a certain certain situation whether physical financial uh a spiritual anything you come up and you're like how am i gonna get through this and that was what five years ago ten years ago we're still here still attending the word of god and we know it's coming we see it's finally coming saints of god the sixth vision has just taken place the sixth vision has just taken place i waited 20 years for this and finally we have a woman vice president thus saith the lord and you know the way things are going she may become president sixth vision we better not be here for the last one this is the last one we are going to see the seventh vision we do not see except from up there this is our last vision we're done we count up to six and then go up come on yeah you know what appropriately humble in the evangelical evangelic uh evangelical sense submisses to divine will lord you want me to go to thailand again and not win any souls you just want me to teach for two weeks under third uh third third shift conditions super hot and you want me to go and just plant seeds and see nothing grow yes sir okay wait take two weeks off of work lose that pay come back the very next day go right back to work no rest six trips yes lord okay brother you want me to work a little bit harder to feed my family lord you want me to listen absolutely lord you want me to witness this guy with his earrings and these tattoos and this net yes lord submissive to divine will not proud not a good thing about me except the lord jesus christ self-sufficient or if uh not proud or self-sufficient or refractory uh not peevish no i had to look up what peevish meant what is peabish fretful what if this happens and what if that apt to mutter or complain a meek person does not complain those inherit the earth something takes place and says be angry and sin that praise the lord i can really say something right now but i'm gonna go pray about it in my closet a meek person well this person uh like these children here my brother my sister they go talk to his mom and dad i'm dead this is heaven okay thank you i'm sorry sister i love you whether it's his fault or not her fault or not meek peevish not easily vexed or fretted not hard to please discontented silly childish these do not inherit the earth there but now remember there's impersonations to be meek thanks again wow my goodness i'm going a long time i'm so sorry okay let's let's just jump here now look what the brother bran is dealing with here is this may they flee we have one service thing when they flee them denominations of greed god way out there and some creeds and denominations god mercy saints of god you know we all feel this we've met some of the finest brothers and god how i say it when they'll see i i how can i say when they'll see it and let them see the word it bothers me me bothers me but i know again that you said no man can come on come no matter how good how meek how gentle it must be the meekness of the holy ghost the only way you can be meek is the holy ghost in you it's not you this has god in you it's god in me amen take a deep breath and say lord come on the scene and you know it's not you because i know what i unless my father had called him and all my father gave me they will come and lord i will i feel my soul responsibility telling the truth amen now let's continue on why is this even tied to serpent seed let's get there let's just hit it think about that blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth all right notice here genesis 1. so god created a man his own image and image of god created him male 1 female he blessed them and god blessed them he spoke to them they heard him and be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it it is yours i give it to you to control this is your title deeds sermon right here i'm gonna send you a little bit later you're going to be the last one on the scene but it's yours just like the canaanites we're in there before abraham but this world is yours now let's continue on i'm going to run through this there's the wheat and tears remember good seed bad seed these are not good seed turned into bad seed there is good seeds separate and there are bad seeds separate people don't don't believe that anymore saints saying this now notice here in second peter called them natural beasts and cursed children sorry serpent seems cursed they're just cursed they can't get away from the curse they just curse yeah but what's the curse what is the curse let's look at it what is the curse that fell on cain and the lord god sent the serpent now this is an animal now he's dealing god is speaking to an animal and he curses him what do you say he says you're going to be the lowest animal because he was an animal he said all the animal other animals walk above the ground on feet they are not on the ground so god made the serpent the lowest creature like this belly face right in the mud face eyes everything right in the mud right in the dirt right in the dust made him the lowest but he's dealing with an animal and he places him so in the animal kingdom but when it comes to cain it shows that he was now mingled with humanity look at cain's curse now thou art cursed from the earth you do not even though you came out of eve even though now you have a place for a soul and you have a soul even though you're in the image and likeness of god now you do not get to inherit the earth that was the curse what do you think the tribulation is what do you think revelation 19 is god says fulfilled all his things he had to do before he goes to battle he's going to take his wife he's going to restore his house in revelation 79 15. he's going to restore the vineyard revelation 11 and then he's coming to destroy and they are what they're going to fight for they want this land they want the earth it's ours why do you think there's a prop why is there title deeds or property needs for your property because it's not yours they give you a right to do on that property what but it's already theirs i believe it's in the 1400s one of the popes wrote a bull a papa bull and it said the catholic church owns the entire world they put a curse on it and put it in their vaults the war is for this this is all they got now jesus has fulfilled everything he said he's gonna do and now they have one they have one shot if we can't stop him from getting the jews if we can't stop him for getting a bride if we can't stop him from doing this we want the land at least that's what it's all about that's what this last battle's about they want the earth they're going to try and take the inheritance the saints of god thus saith the lord it's ours amen and the bible says what you will plant and you will build another will not take anything of it's all yours they're not saints of god if you want to live on a valley if you want to live on a mountaintop if you want to live in a valley all type of mountain time with a river or water or pond or hover it's yours and sense of god when you plan something you're going to eat from it everything you do everything you sow you will reap accordingly it's going to be yours so what do we do when they come fighting for here shortly said if you don't sign up you don't get your stuff let it go because it's already ours but let's do some practicing as we leave here and we go on the highways in the streets and you like this certain property say lord that's mine but not right now say lord i want this valley and i like i like how this there's a there's a place when beth was driving today and there's this real deep golly and it's got that beautiful river it's not a high it's like a giant hill you know and it's beautiful i'm just like i want that that's my that's mine but not right now i'll get it i'll get it later i'll show you a little bit about three give me about four years i'll be here hey man sons of god the lord is gonna make sure we're all gonna prosper amen we just let's just give it up for this season things the world will column has done we count them as nothing amen let's stand stand praise be to god thanks to god when you go home tonight here's like man you know that little side guy he's just little he teaches a little too much and i think you know how he is and how well yeah but no he's always all
