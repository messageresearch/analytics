[0:04] first Crown called the endures Crown the
[0:08] one who can endure James 1 verse 12 of
[0:12] course this is
[0:13] most of our crowns here in laodicea East
[0:15] in America this will be the crown that
[0:17] we're striving for by the grace of God
[0:19] James 1 to verse 12.
[0:25] let's read that if we can verse 12.
[0:27] let's read that on three ready one two
[0:28] three blessed is the man that endureth

[0:42] him praise God the endures Crown let's
[0:45] read about the next Crown Revelation 2
[0:48] 10 the martyrs crown
[0:52] Revelation 2 12.
[0:55] sorry 210 right Revelation 2 10 pardon
[0:58] me
[1:07] let's read that on three one two three
[1:09] fear none of those things which Thou
[1:12] shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast
[1:16] some of you into prison that ye may be
[1:20] tried and ye shall have tribulation ten
[1:23] days be thou faithful unto death and I
[1:27] will give thee a crown of life amen may
[1:31] God as blessings to the Ring of his work
[1:32] and maybe seated praise God
[1:36] so I have a few slides to show here by
[1:39] God's grace and I have some scriptures
[1:41] here
[1:45] as we said just one service today I
[1:47] imagine you know we're kind of exhausted
[1:49] a little bit from yesterday and again we
[1:51] appreciate all the efforts and
[1:53] especially to the mothers and anyone who
[1:56] cooked and bought food and thank you so
[1:58] much for feeding all those people praise
[2:01] God it was kind of a surprise we had so
[2:03] much left over but God knows all things
[2:06] and
[2:06] I was extremely nervous but God worked
[2:08] it out it's been a long time since we
[2:10] had a wedding
[2:12] so we're thankful that we got through it
[2:15] by God's grace I was telling I think we
[2:17] talked yesterday it seemed like it would
[2:18] never get here and then it just went so
[2:20] fast where was it it just kind of but we
[2:23] thank the Lord for his grace and mercy
[2:25] so this thought you know I just was kind
[2:27] of inspired I wanted to get to this on
[2:28] Wednesday I didn't get to it Wednesday
[2:29] we looked at uh that thought were not
[2:31] all giant Killers but we are all
[2:33] Overcomers we looked at part two
[2:36] and uh focused on the lives of King Saul
[2:39] who could have been a giant killer but
[2:42] but failed because of fear and then John
[2:45] the Baptist who was not a physical giant
[2:48] killer but Jesus called him the greatest
[2:51] a believer of the Old Testament
[2:53] Hallelujah and we looked at the
[2:55] attributes of John the Baptist he was
[2:57] such a faithful man a diligent man
[3:00] he fulfilled so many scriptures I
[3:02] couldn't even get to all the scriptures
[3:03] uh but brother Graham said God loved
[3:06] that Spirit of Elijah because it was so
[3:08] obedient to the word of God and God
[3:10] loves the spirit that's on the bride
[3:12] it's the Holy Spirit praise God because
[3:14] she lets herself be washed in the waters
[3:16] of his word hallelujah amen so my
[3:19] inspiration though to get to this
[3:20] thought was this picture my wife bought
[3:21] me the Clarence Larkin book I think last
[3:23] year and
[3:25] um this is a page he has the Judgment of
[3:27] reward so the Bible said all of us will
[3:29] stand before the Judgment right
[3:32] but for us it's a judgment to reward not
[3:35] a judgment to whether you're saved or
[3:37] lost or that's at the white Throne
[3:39] judgment but our judgment comes sometime
[3:41] around the marriage supper of the Lamb
[3:43] during the tribulation period when the
[3:45] bride has been caught up into Glory
[3:47] praise God
[3:49] and so I don't know what point I don't
[3:51] know if it's imagine it's after the
[3:52] presentation of the Bride you know uh
[3:54] Paul said I'll present you as a Chase
[3:56] virgin so each Church H Messenger will
[3:59] will present The Believer from each age
[4:01] Hallelujah will be standing there with
[4:03] brother Branham hallelujah amen amen uh
[4:06] we'll be standing there being presented
[4:07] as the bride to Christ but and brother
[4:10] Brown says at some point you know we'll
[4:11] sit down and we'll sit on a long table
[4:13] and we'll all we'll sit with the ones we
[4:16] labored with praise God hallelujah amen
[4:18] they said Jesus will come around and
[4:19] serve us communion Hallelujah just like
[4:22] uh Melchizedek came and served communion
[4:24] to Abraham after the battle was over
[4:26] Hallelujah so I don't know if rewards
[4:28] will be given out beforehand or after
[4:31] but
[4:32] we can expect rewards and as I said on
[4:36] you know Wednesday you know we're not
[4:37] laboring for the rewards we're laboring
[4:40] for Christ amen amen and if and if you
[4:43] know I said this kind of in passing but
[4:45] if you have a competitive Spirit we'll
[4:47] make that com competition against the
[4:50] devil
[4:51] or make it against your flesh praise God
[4:53] but we're not competing against one
[4:55] another we're not trying to be greater
[4:56] than a previous Church age or greater
[4:59] than that person or that person what we
[5:02] are in a contest praise God right we are
[5:05] in a race we are in a competition the
[5:08] Bible says run the race as if you'd be
[5:11] the only one who'd win praise God yes if
[5:14] there's only going to be so many saved
[5:16] out of a city you be one of those praise
[5:18] God
[5:19] make your calling an election sure the
[5:21] Bible says hallelujah approach your
[5:24] salvation with fear and trembling now we
[5:26] know most churches don't do that most
[5:28] churches when they come to church they
[5:29] don't tremble at the word of God right
[5:31] they don't tremble during the song
[5:32] service they don't tremble a prayer but
[5:35] the Bible tells us there's times that we
[5:37] have uh fear and trembling in the
[5:39] presence of God hallelujah
[5:41] and God hasten the day that we have some
[5:44] more of those by God's grace hallelujah
[5:45] amen your life can sometimes get so easy
[5:48] or or we can uh get so distracted with
[5:50] the carers of the world the Bible says
[5:52] that Jesus said the cares of Life many
[5:55] times distract people from having good
[5:57] and honest hearts right they don't uh
[5:59] weed out all the cares of the world as
[6:01] Jesus said in Matthew chapter 13. so we
[6:04] have to make sure that we constantly uh
[6:06] rededicate Our Lives to the Lord
[6:08] hallelujah and then we approach
[6:10] salvation with fear and trembling
[6:12] Hallelujah
[6:13] that's why many times I like to lay at
[6:15] the altar you can break your seat before
[6:17] service or after service but we need a
[6:19] time where we feel absolutely sincere
[6:21] with Christ amen where it's not a game
[6:23] we're not playing church but this is
[6:25] eternal life we're talking about praise
[6:27] God
[6:28] and we got one shot at eternal life
[6:31] Hallelujah we've only got one
[6:33] opportunity to live praise God and so
[6:35] this picture when I just saw I was
[6:37] instantly inspired I thought wow I need
[6:39] to preach on this
[6:40] um I don't know how Larkin taught this I
[6:43] don't know if he taught there were Five
[6:44] Crowns I don't think so one two three
[6:46] four five I don't know if he taught that
[6:48] uh
[6:50] this doesn't say Five Crowns he just
[6:52] says this is Judgment of Believers for
[6:55] their Works remember all these works are
[6:57] based on your appreciation Hallelujah
[6:59] yes or if you want to make a competition
[7:02] against the enemy or you know like Paul
[7:04] said I'm fighting but I'm not beating
[7:06] the air but I'm actually I have an enemy
[7:08] and I'm trying to hit the target praise
[7:10] God hallelujah taking down the kingdom
[7:13] of darkness the Bible says
[7:15] but here we see uh this course will be
[7:17] at the Judgment seat of Christ and
[7:19] that's talked about were you familiar
[7:20] with these scriptures I just thought it
[7:22] was a really inspired uh picture here
[7:24] you know the Bible says in First
[7:26] Corinthians 3 that the fire of this day
[7:29] so there's some type of fire here at the
[7:31] Judgment seat of Christ
[7:33] um and also the great white Throne
[7:35] judgment because the Bible said the fire
[7:37] will determine what type of works we had
[7:39] I would say our God is a consuming fire
[7:43] hallelujah amen
[7:45] so at the Throne of God will be a fire
[7:47] Hallelujah
[7:48] and it will prove what our works were
[7:51] were they motivated by
[7:53] sincerity or selfishness
[7:56] right
[7:58] now the Bible does say like lot
[8:01] uh that you can have salvation like King
[8:03] Saul you can be saved but lose your
[8:05] reward
[8:06] that's what we don't want to have
[8:09] but yet we will rejoice yet we will
[8:11] rejoice in those who are saved even if
[8:13] they have no reward
[8:14] because they've had eternal life right
[8:17] they're not they're not being tormented
[8:20] uh they're not being uh annihilated for
[8:24] a year however many years it would be we
[8:26] would Rejoice that they were saved
[8:27] praise God amen we'd be sad and they
[8:30] didn't have uh some type of reward the
[8:32] Bible said Jesus will wipe away tears
[8:34] from our eyes
[8:35] so there will be some emotion there will
[8:37] be some reason to cry
[8:40] uh even Beyond this realm there will be
[8:43] some reason but we will rejoice in any
[8:46] person being saved but imagine if you
[8:48] don't want a person to be saved
[8:49] something's wrong with you you got to
[8:50] come back to this altar all right
[8:53] if you wish to see anybody tormented in
[8:55] fire or or or Tormentor at all he said
[8:58] you've got to get back to Calvary praise
[9:00] God yes
[9:02] but we see I like this picture you know
[9:04] the Bible says you know we'll either be
[9:06] vessels of gold or silver but the
[9:08] vessels of wood and hay will all be
[9:09] burned up
[9:11] so this is like the this is like uh we'd
[9:14] say that the kingdom of Saul it was all
[9:16] burned up because remember he did he he
[9:18] won a lot of battles remember we looked
[9:19] on Wednesday on that he beat the
[9:21] the uh the malachites I mean
[9:24] Philistines he had all these victories
[9:27] but he'll lose all the reward because of
[9:30] what he did to David
[9:31] and what he did to the priests right
[9:34] he'll lose his reward the Bible said he
[9:36] could have had the kingdom forever
[9:38] but he didn't keep the kingdom with an
[9:41] honest heart God help us to keep the
[9:43] kingdom with an oddest heart and uh and
[9:45] not uh not go after our brother or
[9:47] sister but let's build them up praise
[9:49] God yes that's what King Saul did right
[9:51] he went after his precious son-in-law
[9:54] he was trying to kill his influence and
[9:56] hurt him you know and kill him
[9:58] uh but by God's grace
[10:01] at the end God brought him back
[10:03] Hallelujah I like how some of these uh
[10:05] pictures here you know they listen
[10:07] Jasper's artist stones and all these
[10:09] precious stones in other words uh the
[10:11] reward that you earn here and all the
[10:14] all the good works we did with good
[10:16] intentions those will be preserved
[10:19] aren't you glad hallelujah amen aren't
[10:21] you glad Jesus will remember every time
[10:23] you tried to do something for his name
[10:25] Hallelujah
[10:26] each and every work when it was a good
[10:29] work a selfless work
[10:31] it was an act to glorify God he'll
[10:33] remember it remember the Bible said
[10:34] about corneas the angels of God had seen
[10:37] his memorial stored up in heaven
[10:40] Hallelujah
[10:41] so the Angels would be able to walk by
[10:43] this vial or this bull and then maybe it
[10:45] said maybe it was a bold it said
[10:46] Cornelius on the side and he said
[10:48] there's a memorial for you in the
[10:50] presence of God amen amen Church there's
[10:53] a memorial for you in the presence of
[10:54] God
[10:56] God sees your prayers God sees your
[10:58] fasting God sees your owns God sees your
[11:01] ties and offerings God sees all that and
[11:03] he's keeping track of it praise God Amen
[11:05] Hallelujah
[11:08] so I I don't think he's you know
[11:10] Larkin's saying there's Five Crowns
[11:12] but there's at least five scriptures
[11:14] about them so we'll go through these of
[11:16] course I I just love his pictures I love
[11:18] how he's a I'm a visual person uh the
[11:21] Rapture right Christ meeting the church
[11:23] at the air go some somehow connected to
[11:26] Heaven here judgment for the Believers
[11:28] and the marriage of the lamb and then uh
[11:31] go down for the Revelation okay I'm not
[11:33] sure what that's referring to but
[11:35] of course we don't agree with Larkin on
[11:37] everything he wasn't a prophet like our
[11:39] Prophet brother Branham but I just was
[11:41] inspired by this and I thought I'd like
[11:43] to preach on this one time and I didn't
[11:44] get to say so
[11:46] um
[11:47] preach on it today of course this is the
[11:49] most deceptive day brother random said
[11:51] uh the samuran church age
[11:54] um was uh the the most darkest age
[11:57] uh the age of the Dark Ages because very
[12:00] few people had Bibles
[12:02] and it was the age where uh they'd had
[12:04] Jezebel religion brother said they were
[12:07] Christians were almost snuffed out
[12:09] but God brought a light out of Darkness
[12:11] called Martin Luther praise God
[12:13] hallelujah so that was the darkest age
[12:16] but we live in the most deceptive age
[12:19] and that's what the Bible says the Bible
[12:21] says deception will wax worse and worse
[12:23] so I'll tell you the church and there's
[12:25] ever time we need fear and trembling
[12:26] it's right now praise God because most
[12:28] people will be deceived in the thinking
[12:30] they're saved when they're not saved
[12:32] right amen
[12:34] the Bible say yeah all that live Godly
[12:36] in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[12:38] we've been through this in numerous
[12:39] times I'm just going to say it remember
[12:40] brother said his worst persecution was
[12:43] the last three years of his life out in
[12:45] Arizona because he's been rejected by
[12:46] all the preachers
[12:49] out here in this desert like I've never
[12:51] suffered in my life
[12:53] rejection no limitations no one no one
[12:56] wanting to hear the word of God
[12:59] he said that was his greatest
[13:00] persecution the most he'd suffered in
[13:02] his life so church when you and I are
[13:04] are are uh when when we're rejected by
[13:08] friends or
[13:09] that's probably our level of persecution
[13:12] at least for now right we all look
[13:14] forward to the squeeze I'm certainly
[13:16] look forward to it well we all know this
[13:17] please is coming praise God we don't
[13:19] look forward to it our flesh certainly
[13:20] does not we look forward to the Rapture
[13:22] praise God
[13:23] but no one looks really forward to
[13:25] suffering
[13:26] but the point I'm trying to make uh is
[13:29] that as far as now in in laodicea our
[13:33] greatest persecution will be uh from
[13:35] those that have rejected us because of
[13:37] the stand we take
[13:39] but the Bible said evil men and seducers
[13:41] should wax worse and worse deceiving and
[13:44] being deceived Church we've got to
[13:45] realize that we've got to look at every
[13:47] preacher not as just maybe a servant of
[13:49] God but we got to realize most of them
[13:51] are seducers
[13:53] right we can all name them right Joel
[13:55] Osteen TD Jakes right Benny Hinn we can
[13:57] all name those that are seducing people
[13:59] into false Doctrine
[14:02] right but we got to remember that these
[14:04] are there's many more seducers most
[14:06] preachers are seducers
[14:09] right right they're trying to seduce you
[14:11] to give them money
[14:13] right uh some even more wicked things
[14:16] than that
[14:17] right it's a type of sexual sins and all
[14:20] kinds of power and uh of course satanic
[14:23] Powers they're trying to get over people
[14:24] influence and all these things
[14:26] but that's that's the uh the prophecy of
[14:29] this day it's only going to get worse so
[14:31] that's why I have to search my heart
[14:33] every preacher has to search their heart
[14:34] and make sure they're doing this for the
[14:36] right reasons I'm trying to give you
[14:37] sheet food as brother Brandon said I'm
[14:39] trying to point you to the Bible praise
[14:40] God I'm trying to help you make your
[14:42] calling election sure I want to be in
[14:44] heaven right with you praise God amen
[14:46] amen and I know I'll be judged more
[14:48] strictly than you will be as a preacher
[14:51] that's why that's why I try to live a
[14:53] pretty strict life
[14:54] Hallelujah
[14:56] if I know I'm going to be judged more
[14:57] harshly than I want to live I want to be
[14:59] very careful about the decisions I make
[15:00] right the things I say I want to be real
[15:03] slow before I make decisions unless I
[15:05] absolutely know
[15:06] uh the the word of God the will of God
[15:11] so we know we're living in a very
[15:13] deceptive age I love this quote for
[15:14] other random it always comes to my mind
[15:15] when I think about this
[15:16] he preached Satan's Eden that was his
[15:18] last sermon preached at Branham
[15:19] Tabernacle and remember church in the
[15:22] morning service he let brother Neville
[15:24] preach
[15:25] and he said I felt led of the Lord to
[15:27] let brother Neville preach why didn't he
[15:29] tell brother Neville press play that's
[15:31] my one time to inject that in there okay
[15:33] sir
[15:34] so think about the last time he was a
[15:37] robin Tabernacle he let the five full
[15:38] ministry preach first right he said I'll
[15:41] take the evening service
[15:42] look at that humility right right and
[15:45] bro remember there's closer brother
[15:47] Brown saying he says whatever he said
[15:49] I'm not the pastor now other quotes say
[15:51] he is the pastor but there's quotes from
[15:52] brother Brandon from 1957 the Hebrew
[15:53] series he says brother Neville is the
[15:55] pastor here he said I only own the
[15:57] property
[15:58] he said whatever brother never wants to
[16:00] preach that's between you and him
[16:03] so see look at brother bear as a prophet
[16:05] he could not assert authority over the
[16:07] local pastor
[16:09] right
[16:11] but yeah and then the pastor couldn't
[16:12] serve authority over the prophet and
[16:14] tell him what to do right so each one
[16:17] has their position has their place right
[16:20] my brother I'm talking about the
[16:21] Antichrist system here he's quoting II
[16:23] Thessalonians chapter 2 the Son of
[16:25] Perdition the Antichrist he says the
[16:27] devil then people worshiping Satan in
[16:29] this day thinking they're worshiping God
[16:32] but they're worshiping him through a
[16:34] Creed a man-made denominations and
[16:36] Creeds that's brought the people right
[16:37] down to the greatest deception the world
[16:40] has ever known of
[16:42] no matter how much the word of God
[16:44] promised for this day is preached and
[16:46] Vindicated they still won't believe it
[16:48] they won't believe it thank God we
[16:51] believe it yes yes amen thank God but we
[16:54] got to remember we're on the side where
[16:56] everybody's gonna think you guys are
[16:58] insane you guys are uh racist you guys
[17:01] are homophobic we have to remember that
[17:04] the side we're going to be on right and
[17:07] we're none of those things
[17:09] I'll say this we're full of love
[17:11] hallelujah we're the only ones that are
[17:13] full of love amen amen the real kind of
[17:15] love the love of Christ
[17:18] and church
[17:20] we know the majority of people that go
[17:23] to church are deceived
[17:25] and likely lost but brother Brown says
[17:28] he said it but if I went all my day
[17:30] thinking about that and burdened for
[17:31] them he said I'd go crazy I'll Define
[17:33] that quote for you
[17:35] you know if you put all that burden on
[17:37] you to save each and every one of them
[17:38] when you but we know very few of them
[17:40] will be saved yeah yeah but if you focus
[17:42] on just that all the time he said he
[17:44] would go insane
[17:46] right just like you said with the the
[17:48] children from India remember we went to
[17:49] India and she tried to sell all uh I'm
[17:52] sorry he took all the cash and he'd go
[17:54] buy candy and he gave out all the candy
[17:56] to all the little starving uh little
[17:58] Indian children and he said his heart
[18:00] would just bleed he'd come back home
[18:02] he's like how can I he actually blasted
[18:05] the Americans how can these Americans
[18:06] throw this food away in the trash when
[18:08] there's children Starving in India
[18:10] he blasted Americans
[18:12] right for just throwing food away
[18:14] so we got to be careful praise God yeah
[18:16] right we got to be diligent
[18:18] now of course we can't send our food
[18:20] over to India right our spare food but
[18:22] we can say love offerings over there
[18:25] right when we know Believers I don't
[18:26] know any believers in India but if we
[18:28] ever do we could do that
[18:31] but it's just it's this great hour of
[18:33] deception that we're living in and we've
[18:35] got to be uh ready you know we we can't
[18:37] we can't put all the burden on ourselves
[18:40] right God in other words God will bring
[18:43] us the opportunities that he wants us to
[18:46] uh to fulfill God will help us feed the
[18:49] poor God will help us uh do whatever
[18:52] he's called us to do bring those
[18:54] opportunities to us and we will
[18:55] recognize it praise God why because we
[18:57] can't be deceived
[18:59] right the elect cannot be deceived
[19:03] but this is the greatest deception the
[19:05] world has ever known is right now
[19:08] so how do we how do we discern deception
[19:10] you've got to have the truth praise God
[19:12] Amen how do you discern a counterfeit
[19:14] dollar study the real dollar
[19:16] s
[19:17] so what does that mean for us study the
[19:20] word of God hallelujah
[19:21] amen stay in the word of God absolutely
[19:26] now I found this quote this morning I
[19:27] forgot of course I preached this whole I
[19:29] preached the whole churches but I forgot
[19:31] about this quote but Iran said what is a
[19:32] crowd he said it's it means that you
[19:35] have a domain
[19:37] Hallelujah you are a king if you're
[19:40] crowned and we are sons of God when
[19:43] we're crowned with eternal life how many
[19:45] have it praise God amen amen have
[19:48] eternal life already Jesus says amen
[19:50] we've already passed from Death on life
[19:53] Hallelujah
[19:55] he says make your he said make you
[19:57] priests and Kings unto God is that right
[19:58] so there you are
[20:01] so we have a spiritual domain we've got
[20:03] to rule over right now in our lives
[20:06] think about that think about how many
[20:07] people come to message churches and they
[20:09] lose their domain
[20:11] they stop ruling over their spiritual
[20:13] lives they let something take away their
[20:16] Church time they rob them of their
[20:19] prayer time
[20:20] unless something Rob them of their Joy
[20:23] Rob them of their peace amen
[20:26] they don't handle their Dominion like
[20:28] they're supposed to praise God oh man
[20:31] brother said set up garrisons in your in
[20:34] your spiritual life he said those are
[20:35] garrisons of prayer amen outposts and
[20:39] Lookouts for the enemy that's how you
[20:41] look out for the enemy you stay in
[20:43] prayer Hallelujah So when you say in
[20:44] prayer you stand to the anointing and
[20:46] then you can spot the enemy when he's
[20:48] coming praise God
[20:50] Hallelujah
[20:53] so church if we have eternal life now
[20:55] brother man said we're already crowned
[20:57] which I take as an anointing you're
[20:59] Anointed with eternal life
[21:02] I don't know I can't prove it by the
[21:04] Bible but if m is born again I I I don't
[21:07] know in herself I'd see a little Crown
[21:08] like hanging there maybe floating there
[21:10] and or so I don't know
[21:12] I I think the crown means it's the
[21:15] anointing of the Holy he goes it's the
[21:17] seed of God
[21:19] that we're sealed with unto the day of
[21:21] our Redemption praise God but we know
[21:23] later there is a visit or I would say a
[21:26] physical spiritual Crown coming praise
[21:27] God
[21:28] with a glorified body and we'll get a
[21:31] glorified Crown praise God
[21:33] amen
[21:35] now there's two kinds of crowns brother
[21:36] tells us this in chapter four the
[21:38] Sumerian Church age he's quoting uh
[21:40] Revelation two and I'll give you a cry
[21:42] to life it says not even a cup of water
[21:45] think of that not even a cup of water
[21:48] Given In The Name Of The Lord fails to
[21:50] receive a reward
[21:52] I know brother amen bought some drinks
[21:54] yesterday he did it in the name of the
[21:55] Lord
[21:56] right all those drinks
[22:00] I give you this in the name of the Lord
[22:03] how great shall be the reward to him who
[22:06] gives his life as a martyr for the name
[22:10] of the Lord Jesus
[22:13] you can either keep living a few more
[22:14] years or decades or you can die
[22:17] for the name of Jesus Christ which one
[22:19] would you do deny Christ and live a few
[22:21] more decades or keep Christ and lose
[22:24] your life now
[22:26] of course the believer knows if I lose
[22:28] this life I gain another praise God Amen
[22:31] I'm getting eternal life amen
[22:34] he said perhaps we can get a small idea
[22:36] if we compare this crowd with the crown
[22:39] one in a race
[22:41] Paul says know ye not that they which
[22:43] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[22:46] the prize so run that ye may obtain so
[22:49] here we got the competitive idea we're
[22:51] running a race praise God and we're
[22:54] trying to obtain a crown we want to win
[22:57] glory amen we don't want to lose we want
[23:00] to win Hallelujah
[23:02] amen we're not losers right we're
[23:04] winners hallelujah praise God we're all
[23:08] they're young
[23:09] man we're not going to quit we're not
[23:11] going to give up we're not gonna let
[23:12] somebody else win the race we're gonna
[23:15] win the race praise God
[23:17] amen
[23:18] brother man breaks into the Olympic
[23:20] history a crown given to the Winter
[23:22] Olympic race was a Garland of olive
[23:25] branches but the crown spoken of in
[23:27] Revelation given to a martyr is the
[23:29] crown of royalty
[23:32] see you're a part of God's royal family
[23:34] amen
[23:36] Jesus calls it the Crown of Life
[23:39] the one Crown is for those who have
[23:41] striven
[23:42] right that's our Crown by God's grace at
[23:44] least now
[23:45] we're striving for the crown praise God
[23:49] the other is for those who have given
[23:51] both crowns are Incorruptible they will
[23:54] not perish hallelujah amen
[23:57] the winners of the worldly race of life
[23:59] will soon lose the joy of the planets of
[24:03] the world
[24:04] their Glory will fail but those who give
[24:06] their life for God either by daily
[24:08] striving or shedding their blood as the
[24:11] crowning sacrifice of their lives will
[24:13] be given the Crown of Life praise God
[24:17] you remember when Johnny's family were
[24:18] coming I brought my gold medals in from
[24:20] when I was a state champion
[24:22] you know I do with those I went and hung
[24:23] them up in my garage a couple years ago
[24:25] well guess what they look like now
[24:26] they're all rusted and worn out
[24:29] and I thought what a great reminder
[24:32] you say brother Jesse you'd put your
[24:34] state champion medals and just let them
[24:36] rushed out well eventually they're going
[24:37] to rust out anyway I mean yeah
[24:40] you want me to put them in my casket
[24:41] with me if I go to the Grave
[24:44] make sure you put all those uh Metals
[24:46] around me Lydia before I go to the Grave
[24:48] what good is it gonna do me
[24:50] it's a great reminder that all Earthly
[24:53] crowns
[24:55] fed life will never fade hallelujah amen
[24:58] and there's a greater race we're
[25:00] fighting for praise God
[25:03] nobody calls me up and says are you the
[25:05] state champion from 1997
[25:07] is that you I walk through the store oh
[25:11] are you the one that did that no nobody
[25:12] cares nobody cares it all fades right
[25:17] but when we get to heaven thank God Amen
[25:19] we'll be shaking one another's hand and
[25:22] hug you another saying God bless you my
[25:24] precious brother like they told over him
[25:26] if you would not have it I would not be
[25:28] here praise God Amen let's do something
[25:30] to get somebody saved hallelujah amen
[25:36] they run up and say my precious brother
[25:39] Hallelujah I don't recognize you and the
[25:43] voice said that's the woman you baptized
[25:44] when she was 95.
[25:47] and now she looks like she's 21.
[25:50] Hallelujah so there's tons of crowns you
[25:53] you and I are going for the he endures
[25:55] crown
[25:56] we've got to endure the trials of life
[26:01] very few
[26:03] now people have asked me this question
[26:04] what about
[26:05] um
[26:06] you know a year ago there was those uh I
[26:08] forget the name of it um
[26:11] the Muslims were cutting off Christian's
[26:12] head you remember that a few years ago
[26:13] it was on YouTube and everything all
[26:15] over there and people ask me like
[26:16] they're not message Believers will they
[26:18] go on the Rapture I don't know which
[26:19] Resurrection they'll come up in but I
[26:22] know they've got a Martyrs crown
[26:24] I'll tell you that's real faith
[26:26] to die for your sins I'm sorry to die
[26:29] for for believing in Christ
[26:32] and they know it's going public and they
[26:34] know they can get out of it they just
[26:35] deny Christ and even if they didn't know
[26:36] the message they knew Christ amen right
[26:39] they might not know about water baptism
[26:42] or or the godhead or anything like that
[26:44] but they knew Jesus Christ was the
[26:46] Savior praise God
[26:47] and think about that church that was
[26:49] enough faith that they could give their
[26:51] life for Jesus Oh My how much faith we
[26:53] should have having the Revelation that
[26:55] we have by the grace of God amen amen
[26:58] how much we should be able to endure
[27:00] because of what we know praise God right
[27:05] you should be able to help us right
[27:06] whatever our next battle is whatever
[27:08] whatever our next struggle is it should
[27:10] be able to help us and encourage us I'm
[27:13] I'm a Child of God I'm a message
[27:15] believer praise God God is uh we're a
[27:18] part of the restored bride of Jesus
[27:20] Christ
[27:21] I can get through this because he chose
[27:23] me to be his bride amen amen
[27:26] amen I can endure this trial Hallelujah
[27:29] because he endured the cross for me
[27:31] praise God
[27:33] and I'll say like this if foolish
[27:34] virgins can give their natural lives
[27:36] what could bribe you what could wise
[27:38] virgins do by God's grace
[27:40] they can endure praise God
[27:43] you can endure whether you have cancer
[27:44] whether you have Alzheimer's
[27:47] or whether you uh you get in a car
[27:49] accident whatever happens we should be
[27:51] able to endure because we've got the
[27:53] same life hallelujah amen eternal life
[27:58] there's two kinds of crowns the program
[28:00] tells us now there could be more like I
[28:01] said
[28:03] now let's look at the martyrs crowd
[28:05] so when the blood of thy martyr Stephen
[28:08] was was shed I also this is Paul of
[28:11] course talking with standing by and
[28:13] consenting unto his death and kept the
[28:15] arraignment of them that slew him now
[28:17] what's striking to me is that the name
[28:19] Stephen means crowned Hallelujah so the
[28:24] one whose name Crown was going to be
[28:26] crowned with the martyrs Crown the first
[28:28] one to be crowned with the martyrs crown
[28:31] it's so fitting right in other words God
[28:34] chose that name for a purpose praise God
[28:36] yes he would be the first one crowned
[28:38] with the martyrs Crown in the New
[28:40] Testament right we know there's Old
[28:42] Testament Martyrs as well
[28:44] but he was the first one the first
[28:46] martyr
[28:48] remember the scripture says of Antipas
[28:51] now brother says we have no history on
[28:53] him but we have the history that Jesus
[28:55] gave us hallelujah
[28:57] and the fact was he was a Believer where
[29:00] Satan's seat was I believe it's pergamos
[29:03] if I'm not mistaken
[29:05] he said I know that works and where thou
[29:06] dwells and even where Satan's seed is
[29:08] and thou hold his fast my name and has
[29:10] not denied my my faith rather even in
[29:13] those days where an antipast my faithful
[29:16] martyr who was slain among you where
[29:18] Satan dwelleth look at that now that's
[29:22] really something
[29:24] even and we'd say like an Earthly head
[29:26] course for Satan God has to have
[29:28] Believers there right
[29:30] right now you want to talk about people
[29:31] with a lot of faith how about the saints
[29:33] that live in New York
[29:35] New York City I'm talking about
[29:38] like brother Ivan Karen in the family
[29:41] right they I've gone there three times I
[29:44] don't really want to go back
[29:46] just the street conditions and the
[29:48] traffic and you know all the things that
[29:49] happened in New York the violence and
[29:51] all kinds of things like that
[29:54] but
[29:56] it takes a person of special Faith to
[29:59] live in that type of environment praise
[30:01] God
[30:02] right
[30:03] like it takes a certain faith for us to
[30:05] be in this protective place right and
[30:08] we've got to overcome lukewarmness
[30:11] right whereas they in New York City they
[30:13] might have to battle more persecution
[30:15] like outward persecution
[30:18] right and we yeah and then you know with
[30:20] all the you know the adult stores all
[30:23] around and just you know it's everywhere
[30:24] right all sin temptation is everywhere
[30:27] they're in New York City down there in
[30:28] the Bronx
[30:30] but look here Antipas was just one of
[30:33] those Believers but Jesus had chosen
[30:36] activists to be a martyr like what the
[30:38] Bible calls him he said that's my
[30:40] faithful martyr praise God oh my God we
[30:43] can obey God's word he'll call us
[30:45] faithful Hallelujah
[30:47] Jesus calls us faith faithful praise God
[30:49] in other words we're faithful to God's
[30:51] will for our lives amen amethyst is a
[30:55] calling of Christ was to be a faithful
[30:57] martyr
[31:00] so as far as we know you haven't you're
[31:02] not having been called to be faithful
[31:03] Martyrs we've been called to be faithful
[31:05] endures right amen can I be faithful and
[31:09] endure this the trials of life that come
[31:12] The Temptations of life that come can I
[31:15] Faithfully endure them and glorify
[31:17] Christ
[31:19] Hallelujah
[31:21] but look he was right in the midst of
[31:23] we'd say Jezebel religion
[31:25] my brother Satan's eating for that day
[31:28] he was right there but he was faithful
[31:30] unto it and notice Jesus said I know
[31:32] you're worse I know what you're going
[31:34] through I know what it's like to be a
[31:35] martyr right Jesus
[31:37] right God's the god martyr we'd say he
[31:40] was the god Prophet is God martyr right
[31:43] of course God is Spirit can't pull can't
[31:45] die in a spirit form he died the flesh
[31:46] form
[31:47] Hallelujah
[31:49] but here this these are men that
[31:52] received the martyrs crown
[31:54] and they have a great reward
[31:57] now here's I I showed something similar
[31:58] to this a while back when brother
[32:00] William was here that's all I remember
[32:01] about that service I know it was on a
[32:02] Wednesday night but here's how all the
[32:05] died
[32:07] James the Greater was
[32:11] he's the one who wrote the book of James
[32:14] James the Lesser stoned to death
[32:16] that was his
[32:18] his lot in life
[32:20] Saint Jude was filled with arrows like
[32:22] you see I mean in the world I seen
[32:24] movies like that they just filled him
[32:27] and he stood he said true to Christ
[32:31] Phillip was crucified by soldiers
[32:34] Thomas was thrust with the spirit that's
[32:36] why I don't like when people make fun of
[32:37] Thomas and call him doubting Thomas
[32:40] remember he's the one that traveled the
[32:42] furthest to take the gospel he was the
[32:44] missionary that traveled more miles than
[32:46] anybody else how many miles of these
[32:48] people these preachers traveled by foot
[32:51] that make fun of Thomas today
[32:54] he only died it because that was his
[32:55] calling in life and each one of us doubt
[32:58] who doesn't doubt right
[33:00] right you could call me doubting Jesse
[33:02] but now I'm believing Jesse each one of
[33:05] us doubted at some point yeah yeah it's
[33:07] God real is God can hear my prayers God
[33:08] gonna forgive me this is God Really
[33:10] Gonna Save Me
[33:12] we all doubt
[33:13] Saint Paul was beheaded in Rome
[33:17] Saint Peter was crucified upside down
[33:20] Saint John was the only one who died a
[33:22] natural death
[33:23] the Beloved
[33:25] Matthew was stabbed with a sword Judas
[33:28] is Garrett courses traitor committed
[33:30] suicide
[33:32] St Simon crucified Bartholomew Flay and
[33:35] beheaded I'm not going to tell the
[33:37] details on that
[33:39] Andrew was crucified on an x-shaped
[33:41] cross
[33:42] and Matthias was crucified in Judea some
[33:45] people think Matthias didn't do anything
[33:46] well he lived such a Godly life they
[33:48] crucified
[33:50] he was so close to the Holy Spirit
[33:53] now think about all these men and then
[33:55] put Antipas in there Stephen they got a
[33:57] special crime
[33:58] the martyrs crowd
[34:00] Hallelujah Church did they earn it
[34:04] how'd they earn it by being faithful
[34:06] reminds me of the three three Hebrew
[34:08] children right right
[34:10] all as we know is that we're not going
[34:12] to bow to Satan's Eden
[34:17] miracle coming or not all I know is I
[34:20] cannot bow to the things of this world
[34:24] just got to stand and if God's going to
[34:26] deliver me praise God but if not I'll
[34:29] I'll promise as I'm done to deliver me
[34:32] my angels into his holy presence amen
[34:36] I'm delivered one way or the other
[34:38] Hallelujah
[34:41] what faith these men had and they get a
[34:43] special crown
[34:45] Hallelujah
[34:48] let's look at those attributes that
[34:49] Larkin talked about
[34:51] I mean that's just some notes I had
[34:54] first of all the crown is called the
[34:57] Crown of Glory
[34:59] now verse 3 speaking of preachers
[35:00] neither as being Lords over God's
[35:03] Heritage but being and samples to the
[35:05] flock preacher doesn't boss you around
[35:08] tell you what to do
[35:09] uh not do any work himself he's the
[35:12] example to the flock
[35:14] that's why I like when sister Beatrice
[35:16] lets me sweep out there by God's grace
[35:20] I want to be an example right
[35:23] I want people to follow my example
[35:26] serve others praise God and I I need you
[35:29] to do a better job by God's grace I will
[35:30] by the help of the Lord
[35:33] and when the chief Shepherd Christ shall
[35:35] appear he shall receive a Crown of Glory
[35:37] that fate is not away
[35:40] amen hallelujah
[35:41] so if as ministers we're examples to the
[35:44] people Jesus has a Crown of Glory he'll
[35:46] give to us
[35:49] but notice he says it's beautiful
[35:50] scripture I couldn't leave this one out
[35:52] likewise he younger submit yourselves
[35:55] unto the Elder yeah all of you be
[35:57] subject ones and I look all of you
[36:00] includes me right there's times I have
[36:01] to submit times I wanna go along with
[36:03] the Saints
[36:05] and be clothed with humility
[36:08] for God resists the proud but gives
[36:11] grace to the humble and we know Pride
[36:14] goes before the fall yeah
[36:16] right hallelujah how the Mighty Fall
[36:18] River on Wednesday night right how the
[36:20] Mighty Fall David sang now under the
[36:21] inspiration of the Holy Spirit Jonathan
[36:23] of course he was very faithful Saul not
[36:25] so much but he was still Mighty when he
[36:27] was obedient to the word of God how the
[36:29] Mighty Fall why why it's all fall
[36:30] because of pride Samuel said when you
[36:33] were little on your sight you were
[36:34] victorious when you become great in your
[36:36] sight you became prideful and that's
[36:38] when you fell
[36:40] so we see it's a Crown of Glory now the
[36:43] word Glory I didn't I thought I had the
[36:45] definition in their Glory
[36:47] oh yeah sorry it's way down there all
[36:49] right so I'll go back up there what does
[36:50] glory mean
[36:52] it means a crown of Splendor or
[36:54] brightness
[36:55] magnificence a crown of Excellence a
[36:59] crown of dignity I like I like all these
[37:01] words a crowd of majesty kingly Majesty
[37:04] now let's get past some of these
[37:07] in other words it's a crown of the most
[37:09] glorious condition you could be in the
[37:11] most exalted State you could possibly be
[37:13] in
[37:14] the condition of the blessedness into
[37:16] which is appointed and promised that
[37:19] true Christians shall enter after their
[37:20] saviors return from Heaven praise God
[37:24] in other words the highest state of
[37:26] existence is what the Crown of Glory is
[37:28] hallelujah
[37:30] we think we're having a good time now
[37:32] wait till we get our crowns Hallelujah
[37:33] it's a Crown of Glory Hallelujah
[37:37] like I heard a preacher say you if you
[37:39] thought I danced a lot now wait till I
[37:41] get to heaven praise God the half has
[37:43] not been told
[37:45] Hallelujah if you shouted or screamed or
[37:48] praise God the half hasn't been told and
[37:50] what we're gonna enjoy over there it's
[37:52] an even higher state of blessedness Amen
[37:55] a higher state of Glory a higher state
[37:58] of enjoyment praise God
[38:00] this is what we read frog text here
[38:02] blessed is the man that endured
[38:04] Temptation Now isn't it strange the
[38:06] devil makes us feel like we're cursed
[38:07] when we're being tested
[38:09] but the Bible said blessed blessed and
[38:13] who goes through temptation
[38:15] we all feel it right we all
[38:21] we're so blessed right now
[38:23] because your faith is being perfected
[38:28] you're being tried
[38:30] in other words I'm proven to the devil
[38:31] like a joke I'm proven to the devil what
[38:33] you're really made of
[38:35] Hallelujah you're really made of Faith
[38:38] Hallelujah
[38:42] you shall receive the Crown of Life
[38:43] which the Lord has promised to them that
[38:46] love of how many love God today amen
[38:49] well that you have about faith the Lord
[38:50] that if I love him he's promised me a
[38:54] crowd of life
[38:56] he's going to put
[38:58] he's going to put a crowd on your head
[39:00] and it's a crown of Dominion
[39:02] right for the millennium
[39:04] and also for the future home
[39:06] and then who knows what's after that
[39:08] right or what I'm sorry who knows what
[39:10] that entails all eternity
[39:14] but it's a absolute promise
[39:16] if you can just make it through if you
[39:18] can just persevere if you can just get
[39:21] through the season that you're going
[39:22] through Jesus promise if you love me
[39:25] I'll give you a Crown of Life hallelujah
[39:27] amen
[39:32] the third attribute is called a crown of
[39:34] righteousness now remember righteousness
[39:35] is simply just doing what's right
[39:38] having moral character integrity
[39:42] doing what's right Paul says I fought a
[39:44] good fight I finished my course I kept
[39:46] the faith that's the scripture I read in
[39:48] my track coach hours before he died
[39:51] I didn't know he's gonna die I knew he
[39:52] was close
[39:53] I just opened up my Bible and that's
[39:55] what I read to him he read the Bible 25
[39:57] times
[39:59] as a Catholic man
[40:05] we all have a fight that we must win
[40:09] praise God we have a course we got to
[40:11] keep running praise God
[40:13] we have a faith we have to keep
[40:17] and henceforth so afterwards if you can
[40:20] finish the fight again if you can finish
[40:22] the course if you can keep the faith
[40:24] Jesus has a crown of righteousness
[40:27] laid up for you
[40:29] which the righteous judge shall give me
[40:31] at that day what the day of Rewards
[40:35] right
[40:36] because we know we all know Revelation 5
[40:38] where the 24 Elders they cast their
[40:40] crowns so see they've already got their
[40:43] crowns
[40:46] he said and not to me only Hallelujah I
[40:49] love that I love that part right there
[40:50] amen not to me holy but unto all a
[40:53] Double L praise God all of them also
[40:55] that love is appearing praise God
[40:58] we're all looking forward to Jesus we're
[41:01] all looking forward to seeing his holy
[41:03] face praise God
[41:04] Hallelujah
[41:06] and because of that the Bible said he
[41:08] has a crown of righteousness waiting for
[41:11] you
[41:12] amen so it's glory it's life it's
[41:15] righteousness
[41:17] this is the crown that he puts on us
[41:19] praise God
[41:20] think about that I'll never sin again
[41:22] you'll never sin again
[41:24] amen because you your crowned with
[41:25] righteousness you have a Dominion of
[41:27] righteousness
[41:32] and then also the Bible calls it now
[41:33] this this is a little slightly uh
[41:36] different here for what is Our Hope or
[41:39] Joy or crown of Rejoice what is our
[41:42] crown of rejoicing he says are not even
[41:45] ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus
[41:47] Christ at his coming for ye are our
[41:50] glory and joy
[41:52] so he's speaking to the Thessalonians uh
[41:54] Thessalonians right that's Thessalonians
[41:58] Paul says these believers they
[42:01] they crown of rejoicing so again I don't
[42:04] know if this is a physical crown or just
[42:05] like we said anointing on the person
[42:09] but one reason we will have rejoicing is
[42:11] because of the lives that we've impacted
[42:14] praise God
[42:16] because of the lives that we touch amen
[42:19] God help us to touch lives amen amen
[42:22] amen God help us to pray and say God
[42:23] which life you want me to touch this
[42:25] week praise God
[42:26] who could I be a blessing to this week
[42:29] who can I encourage on their walk with
[42:31] the Lord like I told you last week I had
[42:33] a man email me and said I was just ready
[42:35] to leave the message until I then God
[42:37] directed me to your YouTube and podcast
[42:38] channels
[42:40] and he said no I'm staying in the
[42:41] message I said well that's what I was
[42:42] called to do amen that's what we were
[42:44] called to do right
[42:46] we're called to strengthen people's
[42:48] Faith Hallelujah
[42:50] the Bible says strengthen those things
[42:52] that remain hallelujah amen amen praise
[42:54] God whatever you have left strengthen it
[42:56] praise God make yourself stronger
[42:58] encourage yourself in the Lord don't get
[43:00] weak or get stronger praise God Amen
[43:03] why would you get weaker when there's so
[43:04] many blessings in the word of God
[43:06] hallelujah we got over 1100 sermons from
[43:09] Brother Randy got my sermons you got
[43:10] other preacher sermons why would we get
[43:12] weaker we should get stronger praise God
[43:15] oh my he's got a he's got a crown of
[43:17] rejoicing for us that is coming praise
[43:20] God
[43:24] and also I think this is the fifth and
[43:25] final description I don't think I don't
[43:27] think there are separate crowds I think
[43:28] they're just descriptions of the same
[43:30] crowns either one the
[43:33] the one for striving and the one for
[43:35] giving your life
[43:36] know you not that they which run in a
[43:38] race run all but one receiveth the prize
[43:41] so run that ye may obtain
[43:43] that's why we've seen that song now
[43:45] sometimes we laugh at it but I'm running
[43:46] for my life every day I'm running for my
[43:49] life
[43:50] so sometimes we feel like we're just
[43:52] bowing the enemy all the time right so
[43:54] we gotta we gotta run for our lives
[43:56] I'm running the race to be the winner
[43:58] praise God
[44:00] not running the race to lose
[44:02] I'm not running for second place we
[44:05] should be running for first place
[44:06] Hallelujah
[44:08] so run that ye may obtain the prize
[44:12] and every man that is striving for the
[44:14] mastery is temperate in all things
[44:18] now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[44:20] Crown but we an Incorruptible crown
[44:23] that's where I go back to that story of
[44:25] James Browning he said I ate too much
[44:26] fast food uh he said that kept me from
[44:30] uh preaching as much as I like so that's
[44:33] one example be temperate put good things
[44:36] into the body God gave you right amen
[44:40] strive for the Mastery and thank God you
[44:42] know you
[44:43] he's corrected at the end like he said
[44:47] but we're all guilty of that I was
[44:48] guilty of going to Too Much fast food
[44:51] right
[44:53] so he says strive for Mastery
[44:56] have self-control in other words let the
[44:58] Holy Spirit have control over your
[45:00] temple praise God Amen
[45:01] let him control what comes in into your
[45:05] temple praise God
[45:07] because we're trying to win a crown
[45:10] hallelujah we're trying uh to win the
[45:13] prize amen we're trying to to please
[45:16] Christ we're trying to uh to hear him
[45:19] say Well done good and faithful Runner
[45:21] praise God amen
[45:24] you endure the Temptation you endured
[45:27] the trials of life so come in and
[45:29] receive your reward come in and receive
[45:31] your crowd hallelujah amen oh it's
[45:33] beautiful
[45:34] so according to Larkin I just thought
[45:36] putting these together just makes it
[45:37] look really good
[45:39] it's a Crown of Glory a Crown of Life a
[45:42] crown of righteousness when you win
[45:44] souls and encourage Souls it's a crown
[45:46] of rejoicing praise God Amen and it's an
[45:49] Incorruptible Crown amen think about
[45:52] that church
[45:54] whatever good God has you do here
[45:56] whatever you put into the kingdom of God
[45:57] it will never be forgotten
[46:00] nobody can take nobody can ever take
[46:03] that away
[46:04] I remember then when we were state
[46:06] champions a couple times they said
[46:08] you're a champion and nobody can ever
[46:09] take that away from you well that's true
[46:12] but then next year there's another
[46:13] champion you're not always the champion
[46:15] right
[46:15] yeah you're just Champion that one time
[46:18] but when you're a Christian there you go
[46:20] when you're a Christian you you're a
[46:23] Believer you're a conqueror for all
[46:25] eternity praise God Amen you overcame
[46:27] every Temptation every devil that
[46:29] trapping scenario that the enemy set for
[46:31] you every Thorn and every care of this
[46:34] world you overcame all that and you're
[46:36] you're an overcomer for all time praise
[46:38] God
[46:40] remember as the Holy Ghost build Saint
[46:41] you're given a place of prominence the
[46:43] Bible says
[46:45] you're not being judged you're sitting
[46:47] with him in the Judgment praise God
[46:50] you're a part of the Judgment team I'll
[46:52] say it like that
[46:54] you get to be part of the Judgment team
[46:57] that's for the Overcomer who's filled
[47:00] with the Holy Ghost praise God
[47:05] now
[47:06] I want to rehearse this there's a
[47:08] section on this in my book it's the uh
[47:10] the parable of the pounds I'm gonna turn
[47:12] there
[47:14] Luke I think it's 19 if I'm not mistaken
[47:20] I didn't write the chapter down I forgot
[47:23] about that
[47:25] yeah there it is praise God Luke 1911 uh
[47:28] verse 11 through 27.
[47:34] yes
[47:35] it says then he said therefore a certain
[47:37] nobleman went into a far country to
[47:40] receive for himself a kingdom and to
[47:42] return and he called his ten servants
[47:45] and delivered them 10 pounds and sent
[47:47] them to them occupy till I come
[47:50] Hallelujah
[47:53] so each servant got the same amount of
[47:56] money
[47:57] right now that's different from the
[47:59] parable the talents they got different
[48:00] amounts
[48:02] and so there's different applications
[48:04] right
[48:07] so in this one though we're all given
[48:09] the same opportunity
[48:11] it's not the same I'm sorry that's
[48:14] different than like preachers preachers
[48:15] preachers will have you know certain
[48:16] levels to get five talents two talents
[48:18] one Talent you know uh some brother you
[48:21] know even with any sister your your gift
[48:23] of Miracles might be a five Talent gift
[48:25] a miracle
[48:26] but somebody's got a one-tailed miracle
[48:29] right
[48:30] and that's true but in this Parable this
[48:33] is speaking of everybody has the same
[48:35] opportunities
[48:37] right to serve God Amen
[48:41] and remember some of them uh some of
[48:43] these servants hated Christ right that
[48:45] would have been the Jews they didn't use
[48:46] their talents
[48:49] and some of them didn't invest because
[48:50] they feared
[48:52] uh Christ they thought he wasn't a a
[48:54] fair person
[48:56] they thought Christ reached where he
[48:58] didn't sow
[49:00] and Jesus has your own mouth will judge
[49:02] you
[49:03] anyone that speaks against Christ their
[49:05] own words will judge them right somebody
[49:07] emailed me about that said well Jesse
[49:09] what about every Idol word you're coming
[49:10] to account for I said well that's true
[49:12] for some people that's I don't think
[49:13] that's true for the bride of Christ
[49:15] why because there's no condemnations
[49:17] then they're in Christ Jesus yes Amen in
[49:20] other words Every Idle Word you spoke
[49:21] you asked God to forgive you of it right
[49:25] is that right
[49:27] I said I think that that warning for
[49:29] Idle Words I think that's for the
[49:31] Sinners yeah
[49:33] because the blood of Christ takes
[49:34] everything away
[49:36] if not then it wasn't big enough oh it
[49:38] wasn't great enough but the blood of
[49:40] Christ is great enough hallelujah amen
[49:43] Hallelujah
[49:45] takes away every Idol or think of the
[49:47] idle words we speak now God be merciful
[49:49] to us right the complaining we do
[49:52] whatever whatever whatever Idle Words we
[49:54] speak
[49:55] the blood of Christ forgives all that
[49:58] that's why I told the brother I said I
[50:00] don't think that applies to me so you
[50:01] might be different with me you might
[50:03] call me a heretic that's what I believe
[50:04] I mean what the Bible says praise God
[50:07] I believe that but I also believe the
[50:09] Bible says there's no condemnation
[50:10] praise God nobody can lay any charge to
[50:13] our account Hallelujah
[50:15] it's God that justifies if God's for me
[50:18] who can be against me praise God
[50:21] anyways
[50:23] so we see with this this Parable
[50:25] everyone has the same amount of
[50:27] opportunity
[50:30] Jesus said in verse 26 for I say unto
[50:32] you that unto every one which hath shall
[50:36] be given and from him that has not even
[50:38] that he has shall be taken away from him
[50:42] all right
[50:43] now
[50:45] program says this and Simon read this
[50:47] that's why this sermon was all my
[50:49] thoughts since I heard Simon preach it
[50:51] and I wanted to preach a full sermon on
[50:52] it so I hope it's okay
[50:54] brother Adam says in chapter 4 all too
[50:56] little time is spent on laboring for the
[50:58] Eternal rewards of God
[51:00] the recompense of God is too lightly
[51:02] esteemed if we believe in the reality of
[51:05] the resurrection of the body and the
[51:07] Eternal Kingdom of substance then we
[51:09] ought to lay up
[51:10] in heaven those good Treasures that are
[51:13] available to the faithful Saints
[51:15] now we know the treasures are like a rod
[51:18] of iron we know the treasures or the
[51:20] Morning Star we'll get to that a little
[51:22] bit we know Treasures are ruling over
[51:23] cities
[51:25] right but brother Adam says they are
[51:28] actually substance rewards so that means
[51:30] there is a crown that's an actual
[51:31] substance that will go on your head it's
[51:34] actual substance
[51:36] right so we're actually laboring for
[51:38] real things amen amen this is not
[51:40] imaginary praise God that's right this
[51:42] ain't some mystical dreamer some hope so
[51:45] this is an absolute will be hallelujah
[51:48] amen this is an absolute promise of God
[51:51] and he promises it to all those that
[51:54] love is appearing amen how many love
[51:56] Jesus today amen
[52:01] now I want to count all these rewards
[52:03] that all of us can get this is not just
[52:05] for preachers Not Just For Men it's for
[52:08] every single one of us
[52:10] if you withstand persecution and endure
[52:12] Temptation you get the reward Crown of
[52:15] Life
[52:16] if you give give a water in the name of
[52:18] Jesus or disciple you get a
[52:21] be cautious that you know in my house
[52:22] I'm very careful I think the Lord I
[52:25] think the Lord is very careful to remind
[52:26] me when we have guests I always try to
[52:28] give them a glass of water after I offer
[52:30] them some water
[52:31] because I want to fulfill that
[52:34] right I do it in my class as a teacher
[52:36] as well you know Bible club we do it
[52:39] I just mean to be aware of that like I'm
[52:41] here to serve other people praise God I
[52:44] have to be hospitable that's one of my
[52:45] requirements for a a bishop or a Bible
[52:48] calls an elder or pastor
[52:50] I have to have that so I want to
[52:52] constantly remember that what can I give
[52:54] you are you thirsty can I get you some
[52:55] ice water
[52:57] the Bible says if you receive a prophet
[52:59] or a righteous man you get a prophet's
[53:01] reward
[53:03] now program said that's you know come in
[53:05] handy right so if you're around a
[53:07] prophet that Prophet can pray for you
[53:09] but it's also true for us even listening
[53:11] to program sermons remember I told you
[53:13] that story about Elijah Gibbs he's a
[53:14] pastor in Connecticut he was born with
[53:16] some type of a foot defect and he walked
[53:19] with a limp but he was going to be a
[53:21] preacher he was a young man he just kept
[53:23] listening to Brothers tapes and he was
[53:24] listening to a brother random tape and
[53:27] brother Ram told this person on tape
[53:29] exactly what was wrong with his foot
[53:31] the man on the tape and that was exactly
[53:34] what was wrong with Elijah Gibbs and he
[53:36] said the Holy Spirit pushed his chair
[53:37] over and he fell flat on his back when
[53:40] he got up his foot was completely made
[53:41] well a church to me that's a prophet's
[53:44] reward right there yeah
[53:46] yeah because you listened to a prophet
[53:47] you get a reward
[53:49] amen hallelujah there's lots of people
[53:52] that have experienced that Angie Brown
[53:54] and
[53:55] I don't know where she goes to church
[53:56] now but she would call us for prayer
[53:57] requests for years and years and years
[53:58] she was here listening to a tape of
[54:00] brother Brandon like in that in that
[54:02] moment the presence of God comes down
[54:04] why because you're Drawing Near to God
[54:08] right we've had people healed right in
[54:10] this congregation right in this service
[54:12] we've seen it a couple weeks ago
[54:14] right whenever you draw nights ago
[54:18] [Applause]
[54:21] the prophets real
[54:25] and George I just believe there's a
[54:26] reward I'm just thankful to believe God
[54:29] sent a prophet and the I believe there's
[54:31] just a reward of living holy in other
[54:34] words message made me live holier than I
[54:36] ever lived before and to me that's a
[54:38] great reward amen
[54:40] because I don't live under the
[54:41] condemnation of living a worldly life
[54:43] I'm separated from that and I get the
[54:45] reward of having a clean conscience
[54:47] before God amen amen
[54:50] Hallelujah
[54:53] that's that's the only prophet's reward
[54:55] I get Hallelujah I'll take that
[54:56] Hallelujah
[54:58] I get a lot more rewards than I'll have
[54:59] cast out Devils heal the sick in other
[55:01] words all the bible promises all those
[55:03] great rewards
[55:05] praying in secret getting reward we saw
[55:07] that with Cornelius there was a memorial
[55:08] in heaven when you pray that way
[55:11] same thing when you give alms
[55:14] you get a reward for that
[55:16] it's in heaven there's a memorial in
[55:19] heaven with your name on it
[55:22] when you plant oh this is for creatures
[55:24] I imagine because that's the context
[55:26] plant and water the gospel you get a
[55:28] reward
[55:31] City
[55:35] there's a reward for that I didn't fall
[55:36] asleep

[55:54] people would get healed just having his
[55:56] shadow pass over there I believe God was

[56:01] and family God would just let his shadow
[56:03] where's my shadow here's my that's just
[56:05] right under me but if Malachi fell under

[57:40] preaching I want to love song media but
[57:41] I am a love song leaving whatever we're
[57:43] called to do
[57:45] like your sisters love cooking sometimes
[57:47] right at least I know it's a lot right
[57:49] especially yesterday the day before but
[57:52] you love it right you love it why don't
[57:53] you love what people tell you you did a
[57:54] good job cooking yeah
[57:56] how about did they say you're the best
[57:57] cook in the country would that make you
[57:59] feel good
[58:00] Graham said I'd like to come over to

[58:10] you'd like to do it praise God yeah
[58:13] anytime you diligently seek God there's
[58:15] a reward for that amen
[58:18] you know see I feel sorry when people
[58:20] say well I'm seeking for the Holy Ghost
[58:21] but I didn't get it and they're
[58:22] discouraged Satan has actually tricked
[58:24] them out of it
[58:25] because they should know maybe they
[58:28] don't know this maybe it's immaturity
[58:29] but they should know I'm diligently
[58:31] seeking God there is a reward for that
[58:33] nice in other words I'm drawing closer
[58:36] if I draw an eye to God he'll draw a
[58:38] knight to me praise God
[58:40] but see that's just discouragement that
[58:41] young believer's face or whoever's going
[58:43] through trials like that right but we
[58:45] should be encouraged you're spending
[58:46] more time with God Amen if I could I'd
[58:48] give you a spiritual pat on the back
[58:49] praise God keep it up keep drawing
[58:52] closer to God God is with you Hallelujah
[58:55] if he wasn't you wouldn't try to be
[58:57] getting in his presence the fact that
[58:59] you're drawing onto him that means he's
[59:01] drawing you like Solomon through the
[59:03] suit of I praise God Amen draw me and
[59:06] I'll run after you Lord
[59:08] that's what's happening you're feeling
[59:10] the pull
[59:12] you're feeling the draw of the Lord
[59:13] Jesus Christ
[59:15] there's a great reward for diligently
[59:17] seeking God
[59:20] fasting in secret get you a reward
[59:22] Cornelius again
[59:26] that's what I want to uh
[59:28] remind people too I've had numerous
[59:29] people asking about the Holy Ghost
[59:30] remember cornelius's house the Holy
[59:32] Ghost fell while they were preaching
[59:35] and the Bible said they magnified God
[59:37] and they glorified God right during the
[59:40] preaching
[59:42] think about that some people get the
[59:43] Holy Ghost right when the preacher
[59:45] preaches about Jesus
[59:47] it talks about the Holy Spirit somebody
[59:50] could get the Holy Ghost right there and
[59:52] you'd see it and you'd hear it like
[59:53] Peter said
[59:59] you're in God's presence right now
[1:00:01] praise God
[1:00:03] each one of us are in God's presence now
[1:00:05] because God's word is being preached
[1:00:07] hallelujah amen amen
[1:00:10] giving food drink shelter clothes to a
[1:00:13] Christian or visiting one when he's sick
[1:00:16] or in prison yields some and entrance
[1:00:19] into life eternal According To Jesus
[1:00:22] I don't know if they had repentance
[1:00:24] before that but in the story remember
[1:00:25] they're surprised that when do we do
[1:00:27] this for you Lord
[1:00:28] we didn't know your people was actually
[1:00:30] you a part of the word I love my brother
[1:00:33] Anderson brother I said you're a part of
[1:00:35] God I'm a part of God but he said none
[1:00:37] of us are all of God we all have a part
[1:00:39] of God
[1:00:40] I like how brother said I'm not all of
[1:00:43] God because people make him all God
[1:00:45] there's a second one like that
[1:00:49] brother I'm always blasting the
[1:00:50] Jeffersonville movement okay son
[1:00:52] I'm trying to watch myself that's only
[1:00:54] two in this service okay so I just I
[1:00:57] guess I battle it all the time so that's
[1:00:58] every day I get comments you know I
[1:01:00] gotta just let it go
[1:01:02] and I love this one loving your enemies
[1:01:05] blessing those who persecute you praying
[1:01:07] for those who despitefully use you gotta
[1:01:09] let yourself be you sometimes
[1:01:11] lending with hope of no repayment yields
[1:01:14] a great reward among the title being
[1:01:16] called Children of the highest
[1:01:19] who are the highest most exalted
[1:01:21] Believers those who land and hope nobody
[1:01:24] gives back money right
[1:01:26] who are the children of the highest
[1:01:29] bless others when they curse them out
[1:01:34] that's the children of the highest
[1:01:36] these are real children of God
[1:01:40] they bless those who persecute them they
[1:01:43] love their enemies
[1:01:45] may God help us to always say God bless
[1:01:47] you to our enemies right God bless you
[1:01:50] now of course in my mind I think God
[1:01:51] bless you with the repentant heart right
[1:01:54] right because they're under the
[1:01:55] the influence of the enemy or else they
[1:01:58] want to be fighting against me they want
[1:01:59] to be my enemy
[1:02:00] right they'd be my friend because I'm
[1:02:01] their friend
[1:02:03] providing for a Christian's physical
[1:02:05] necessity so giving somebody food
[1:02:07] shelter clothing yields a Heavenly
[1:02:09] reward upon someone else's account
[1:02:12] the Bible says we have accounts in
[1:02:13] heaven
[1:02:14] Paul said Philippians because you gave
[1:02:16] to me it's now on your account in heaven
[1:02:19] that's what that Violet Cornelius
[1:02:20] there's an account in heaven with your
[1:02:22] name on it
[1:02:25] so don't compete against other people
[1:02:27] but run the race praise God
[1:02:30] run the race against soar up Treasures
[1:02:32] in Heaven and I love this I love this
[1:02:34] list these are all the rewards of the
[1:02:36] seven Church ages I can put them in one
[1:02:37] place
[1:02:38] so I can see all those and really
[1:02:40] encourage us so what what rewards do you
[1:02:42] get if you overcome and later this year
[1:02:43] brother said you would
[1:02:45] bye
[1:02:49] if you can just overcome now in 2023 in
[1:02:53] laodicea if you can just overcome all
[1:02:55] these temptations that we go through

[1:03:29] upon him and you're sitting with Jesus
[1:03:31] in his throne oh
[1:03:34] that's what I call the reward praise you
[1:03:36] guys amen just one of those would be a
[1:03:38] great reward
[1:03:40] right but we get all of them if we can
[1:03:42] just overcome
[1:03:43] the trials that we go through amen you
[1:03:47] can just defeat the Devil all these
[1:03:49] blind battles
[1:03:50] if we can just overcome these my mouths
[1:03:52] and it may be persecution later
[1:03:55] maybe rejection if we can just overcome
[1:03:59] these trials the Bible calls them light
[1:04:01] afflictions and the church said amen if
[1:04:03] we just overcome these light afflictions
[1:04:05] there's great Eternal rewards for us I'm
[1:04:08] almost done
[1:04:09] so what do we know Jesus is watching
[1:04:12] right yes I forgot to put the scripture
[1:04:14] up there but the Bible says God is Not
[1:04:16] unrighteous to forget your labor of love
[1:04:21] he sees everything
[1:04:22] Hallelujah he remembers everything that
[1:04:25] you've done amen hallelujah
[1:04:29] he's watching you he knows your heart he
[1:04:33] hears your prayers
[1:04:35] he's watching
[1:04:38] brother says but now this
[1:04:41] in this special promise to the True
[1:04:43] Believers of all ages God's had to God
[1:04:45] is declared he will give them rewards of
[1:04:48] great Beauty and eternal duration
[1:04:50] let the wealthy look down on the poor
[1:04:52] and that how he feels sometimes
[1:04:55] people drive by with their big Dodge
[1:04:57] Charger or they drive by
[1:05:00] I drive slow so a lot of people flash me
[1:05:02] some inappropriate signs when I'm
[1:05:04] driving now I'm not claiming to be the
[1:05:05] best driver either maybe I make mistakes
[1:05:07] but I get a lot down on me for some
[1:05:09] reason maybe I'm not a good driver
[1:05:11] but I'm trying to be a good driver but
[1:05:13] you know how the rich are you know they
[1:05:15] drive by or you
[1:05:16] by their house and they just think
[1:05:17] they're the greatest people ever
[1:05:19] they might look down on his church
[1:05:21] but just remember also there's other
[1:05:23] there's another person who's looking
[1:05:24] down on us that's Jesus it's a different
[1:05:27] kind of looking down amen hallelujah
[1:05:29] it's looking down with love hallelujah
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:33] let the wealthy look down the poor
[1:05:37] let them give large some to the church
[1:05:39] that it may turn that in turn it might
[1:05:42] honor the by placing a marble plaque or
[1:05:45] some statuary in their honor unplug
[1:05:48] public display that all may applaud
[1:05:51] right we've all I've been to Dedicated I
[1:05:53] work at the school they always have
[1:05:54] dedication Services well this is going
[1:05:56] to be an honor of so-and-so this is
[1:05:58] going to be honor and so and so let the
[1:05:59] world have their honor
[1:06:01] right
[1:06:03] but someday the God who sees and knows
[1:06:07] all
[1:06:08] once more will once more commend the
[1:06:10] Widow for giving her all though it might
[1:06:13] be but two mites and he himself reward
[1:06:16] with the treasures of Heaven
[1:06:21] I thought about this
[1:06:26] hey they gave a tenth away right
[1:06:29] well they would get the same reward if
[1:06:31] somebody had a thousand and gave a
[1:06:33] hundred away
[1:06:34] is that right
[1:06:37] yeah so it's Jesus tells us it's the
[1:06:40] percentage of what you give away and I'm
[1:06:42] not telling anybody to go into poverty
[1:06:45] but I'm saying
[1:06:46] that Jesus is looking at your heart when
[1:06:49] you give
[1:06:51] right and we also want to be led by the
[1:06:53] Holy Spirit when we give and I'm not
[1:06:55] passing around the offering basket again
[1:06:57] I've never done that I'm telling you I'm
[1:07:00] telling you and reminding you give to
[1:07:02] those that have a need of it
[1:07:04] when you're led by the Holy Spirit
[1:07:07] when you see the opportunity
[1:07:12] this woman gave two mites a might was 3
[1:07:15] 8 of a penny and I don't know what a
[1:07:16] penny was in that day
[1:07:18] I don't know if like they call like a
[1:07:19] day's wages or certain I've spent a
[1:07:21] while since I looked at it with the
[1:07:22] talents and everything
[1:07:24] by the word she gave six eight six
[1:07:26] eighths of a penny away
[1:07:28] that's all she had
[1:07:29] and Jesus said she gave more than the
[1:07:31] thousands or millions of dollars that
[1:07:33] the Pharisees gave in the treasury
[1:07:35] because it's based upon your percentage
[1:07:37] and church really we just want to give
[1:07:39] all that we can for God yes right amen
[1:07:42] because what about you know you know
[1:07:43] some people look at the scripture and
[1:07:44] that's true but what about the other
[1:07:47] scripture in Proverbs where it says a
[1:07:49] wise grandfather leaves an inheritance
[1:07:51] to his grandchildren what about that one
[1:07:53] well if I gave it all away I can't be
[1:07:54] wise and give to my grandchildren right
[1:07:57] so there's a balance you got to follow
[1:07:59] the leading of the Lord
[1:08:00] what God's leading you to do
[1:08:03] and of course the nice thing is at the
[1:08:05] end of your life of the Lord should
[1:08:06] Terry you can give it all away
[1:08:08] because you can't take it with you right
[1:08:10] like I heard the brother say uh you've
[1:08:12] never seen a U-Haul truck behind a
[1:08:14] hearse right
[1:08:17] we saw one the other day we saw a
[1:08:18] funeral presenting going I didn't see a
[1:08:19] U-Haul truck taking all your Treasures
[1:08:22] to the Grave
[1:08:25] so we got to give our all
[1:08:27] I love this Jesus sat over against the
[1:08:29] treasure look he's just sitting and he
[1:08:31] was just watching that that's why I love
[1:08:32] that quote brother said Jesus is just
[1:08:34] watching everybody
[1:08:36] he's watching when that basket got
[1:08:37] passed around today now don't feel bad
[1:08:38] if you didn't give because sometimes I
[1:08:39] don't give you know
[1:08:41] uh I can't give every week because I
[1:08:42] only get paid but I'm just saying in our
[1:08:44] lives Jesus looks at each one of us and
[1:08:45] he's watching how do we
[1:08:48] I love that
[1:08:50] the sick Church
[1:08:52] right he could have been teaching in the
[1:08:53] in the The Sanctuary but he's watching
[1:08:56] how we give to the Lord
[1:08:58] I love that
[1:09:00] and then he points out to his Apostles
[1:09:02] here's a good example here's two
[1:09:03] examples this is the right example this
[1:09:06] is the wrong example
[1:09:07] he's watching you Church Hallelujah
[1:09:09] right he's watching me
[1:09:11] and Jesus sat over against the treasury
[1:09:13] and beheld how the people cast money
[1:09:16] into the treasury and many that were
[1:09:18] Rich casting much
[1:09:21] and there came a certain poor Widow and
[1:09:23] she threw in two mites which make a
[1:09:25] farthing
[1:09:27] and he called unto him his disciples and
[1:09:29] saith unto them very thus in you that
[1:09:31] this poor will have cast more in than
[1:09:33] all they which have cast into the
[1:09:36] treasury
[1:09:37] for all they did casting of their
[1:09:40] abundance but she of her want did cast
[1:09:43] in all that she had even all her living
[1:09:46] I don't know anybody
[1:09:48] at least yet maybe that I remember
[1:09:50] that's cast in they've given away every
[1:09:52] single thing they've had
[1:09:54] that is a real sacrifice yeah yeah we
[1:09:57] don't know anything about this Widow now
[1:09:58] remember Widow was the worst place you
[1:10:00] could be you don't have a husband taking
[1:10:01] care of you don't have a son
[1:10:03] widows were the worst one of the worst
[1:10:04] places you could be
[1:10:06] just watched her and let her give
[1:10:10] sometimes Jesus is going to watch us and
[1:10:12] let us get when even when it hurts even
[1:10:15] as your account gets left Hallelujah
[1:10:19] remember he's looking down in love
[1:10:22] the rest of the world looked down and oh
[1:10:24] I'm better than them look how great I am
[1:10:25] but Jesus looks down in love
[1:10:28] he's gonna reward all that we do for his
[1:10:31] namesake
[1:10:34] remember Church
[1:10:35] Jesus
[1:10:36] wore a crown of thorns and then he's the
[1:10:39] one that gives us the crown
[1:10:41] Crown of Life
[1:10:42] the soldiers played a crown of thorns
[1:10:44] and put it on his head and they put on
[1:10:46] him a purple robe and they said hail
[1:10:48] King of the Jews and they smote him with
[1:10:50] their hands
[1:10:52] they slapped our King
[1:10:56] we know Jesus wore Thorns so we could
[1:10:59] wear eternal life
[1:11:02] he became our sin that we might be made
[1:11:05] his righteousness
[1:11:07] Hallelujah
[1:11:09] remember the scripture says
[1:11:10] where'd the first Thorns come from they
[1:11:12] come from the Garden of Eden
[1:11:15] Thorns were the result of the curse of
[1:11:18] sin so Jesus took our curse upon himself
[1:11:21] that's why he wore the Thorns right
[1:11:25] he was crowned with all of our sins he
[1:11:28] was crowned with all of my iniquities
[1:11:31] Hallelujah
[1:11:33] he took that Dominion upon him did he
[1:11:35] not
[1:11:36] he took that Dominion upon him so that
[1:11:38] he could pay the price for all of our
[1:11:40] sins
[1:11:41] Hallelujah the Bible said Christ has
[1:11:44] redeemed us how many people redeemed
[1:11:45] today you feel bought out of the pawn
[1:11:48] shop amen you're out of the pawn shop
[1:11:51] praise God hallelujah amen you're a part
[1:11:53] of your father's Kingdom Hallelujah I'm
[1:11:55] redeemed
[1:11:57] from the curse of the law being made a
[1:11:59] curse for us for his written curse it is
[1:12:02] every one that haneth on a tree
[1:12:05] he became a Blessing of Abraham might
[1:12:07] come on you through Jesus Christ what a
[1:12:10] blessing praise God Amen he was cursed
[1:12:13] so you could be blessed
[1:12:14] they curse him with the crown of thorns
[1:12:16] so he could bless you with the crown of
[1:12:18] everlasting life
[1:12:21] Hallelujah that we might receive the
[1:12:24] promise of the spirit through faith
[1:12:28] what a blessing
[1:12:31] to church I just want to end with this
[1:12:33] because this is something we can all do
[1:12:34] right now
[1:12:35] all right we all can't go cook food
[1:12:37] right now right you know
[1:12:39] can't all go start fasting I guess you
[1:12:41] could start fasting right now man
[1:12:43] what we can all do right now is pray
[1:12:47] that's how I want to end the service
[1:12:49] brother man I was listening to souls in
[1:12:51] prison yesterday
[1:12:53] but Ram said even Abraham crying if I
[1:12:55] can find 50 righteous on down to 10
[1:12:57] righteous and God said yes find 10
[1:13:00] righteous
[1:13:01] then he breaks you know program ends or
[1:13:03] he spends actually the last half of that
[1:13:05] it's like a three and a half hour sermon
[1:13:08] trying to encourage the sisters right
[1:13:10] because in JCPenney remember he saw all
[1:13:12] the women that looked like they were
[1:13:13] women from hell with all their makeup
[1:13:15] and blue and purple and everything on
[1:13:17] hanker and he said look like canker
[1:13:20] so he spends the last half showing how
[1:13:22] it's a woman's World sinful women
[1:13:25] but then the beauty of a Godly woman
[1:13:29] he says let me tell you something sister
[1:13:31] just a minute you might be old-fashioned
[1:13:34] but you got something these queens has
[1:13:37] in God
[1:13:38] you've got something that she can never
[1:13:40] have think about that they can never
[1:13:42] have it
[1:13:44] right you might be old-fashioned or
[1:13:47] dressing dress up like a lady they might
[1:13:49] say look at an old Holy Roller don't you
[1:13:50] worry she's got something that that old
[1:13:52] Queen that's got all the world looking
[1:13:55] at her out there she hasn't got it she
[1:13:58] can never have it she's lost
[1:14:00] eternally she's doomed you got morals in
[1:14:03] other words you've got righteousness
[1:14:04] amen you've got a crowd of righteousness
[1:14:07] Hallelujah
[1:14:08] amen they can never have that
[1:14:11] think about how many men Beyonce I'm
[1:14:14] just gonna name some of them Jennifer
[1:14:15] Lopez
[1:14:16] Kim Kardashian
[1:14:18] think of all these men that they've sent
[1:14:21] to Hell program says
[1:14:27] right from Brother Adam's day
[1:14:30] he says you've got virtue we've got
[1:14:33] virtue
[1:14:34] but that woman
[1:14:38] else chosen to Hell the blind walks into
[1:14:40] it but now you've got something you
[1:14:41] sisters you really got something this
[1:14:43] morning praise God
[1:14:45] that's right you got a crowd of Life
[1:14:47] hallelujah amen
[1:14:49] they know nothing about that they're
[1:14:51] crowned with adulteries right
[1:14:54] they're crowded as whoremongers that's
[1:14:56] what they're crowding with
[1:14:58] God of Mercy
[1:15:00] but they can't praise God
[1:15:02] it's got eternal life
[1:15:04] got a great reward praise God
[1:15:07] when they persecute you or they make fun
[1:15:09] of you are there people scoff at you the
[1:15:10] way your hair looks or your dress looks
[1:15:12] when they scoff at that Jesus has he has
[1:15:15] a reward because looking down to reward
[1:15:16] you
[1:15:18] exactly right
[1:15:23] and here's here's where I want to get to
[1:15:24] you know you might not even

[1:15:34] here but it might be I love this it
[1:15:36] might be your righteous life and I
[1:15:39] believe this is true that's holding the
[1:15:41] wrath of God from the world today
[1:15:42] sisters and brothers
[1:15:44] right we saw and this this example the
[1:15:47] example is locked lot and his two
[1:15:49] daughters were holding back the wrath of
[1:15:51] God on Sodom
[1:15:54] your life is holding back the wrath of
[1:15:56] God on Ohio and we got some Pennsylvania
[1:15:59] Saints their lives are holding back the
[1:16:01] wrath of God
[1:16:03] why because we're righteous
[1:16:06] through the grace of our Lord Jesus
[1:16:07] Christ
[1:16:11] the world won't believe it you women
[1:16:13] that's called holy rolly little man that
[1:16:15] don't hardly know anything
[1:16:17] that's me but you cry to God day and
[1:16:20] night for the sins of the country look
[1:16:22] at that sins of the country
[1:16:24] you might be holding off the Wrath
[1:16:27] if I can find 10 I'll spare it if I can
[1:16:30] find 10. Lord is there 10 more souls in
[1:16:34] Akron right look we just got two more

[1:16:37] two more souls in Africa they're spared
[1:16:41] is there any more no we got we got the
[1:16:44] family right I believe there's more

[1:16:57] amen
[1:16:58] is there more
[1:17:00] if I can find 10 I'll spare it
[1:17:03] as it was in days of Silence so shall it
[1:17:05] be see what I mean
[1:17:08] I love this the Bible said it came to
[1:17:10] pass when God destroyed the cities of
[1:17:12] the plain God remembered who Abraham
[1:17:16] God remember the people that prayed
[1:17:19] right
[1:17:21] and sent lot out of the midst of the
[1:17:24] overthrow when he overthrew the cities
[1:17:26] in which lot dwelt
[1:17:30] you know we had our it's just a small
[1:17:33] simple thing but we had our new uh
[1:17:35] neighbors move in and then my wife said
[1:17:37] something very inspired to me
[1:17:39] you know they're not really I mean they
[1:17:42] say they're Believers but they don't go
[1:17:43] to church and they play worldly music
[1:17:45] and
[1:17:47] all kinds of things
[1:17:49] but I love what my wife said she just
[1:17:50] said that one time after they moved in
[1:17:53] she said maybe we are the only people on
[1:17:58] Earth praying for this family to be
[1:17:59] saved
[1:18:00] I thought yeah that's probably right
[1:18:03] they come from a bunch of Sinners you
[1:18:04] know
[1:18:05] they're family of sinners
[1:18:07] and so God had to move them
[1:18:09] foreign
[1:18:16] but now we gotta pray for him yes
[1:18:19] yes today we'll pray for him
[1:18:20] and you can pray for your neighbors
[1:18:22] God Place those people as co-workers God
[1:18:25] placed them for you to pray for
[1:18:27] yes God's remember your prayers
[1:18:29] Abraham's seed Hallelujah
[1:18:32] I use this over in Pennsylvania I use
[1:18:34] this scripture I don't remember that
[1:18:35] brother or not
[1:18:37] God said I sought for a man among them
[1:18:39] that should make up the Hedge who's
[1:18:40] going to make up the Hedge who's going
[1:18:41] to make the The Fortress of protection
[1:18:44] around the people
[1:18:46] who's going to make a hedge around Akron
[1:18:48] it's you
[1:18:50] and stand in the gap before me for the
[1:18:54] land that I should not destroy it but I
[1:18:56] found none
[1:18:59] so God destroyed Israel I'm sorry the
[1:19:00] Jerusalem he scattered them because he
[1:19:03] didn't find anybody trying to put a
[1:19:04] hedge of protection around the city
[1:19:08] praise God and this is something we all
[1:19:10] can do
[1:19:11] I got a few I'll just use virtue a few
[1:19:13] weeks ago virtue come up for prayer for
[1:19:15] brother Chris and I texted brother Chris
[1:19:16] I said we got little ones praying for
[1:19:18] you brother Chris he said thank you for
[1:19:20] praying for me
[1:19:22] I like that just trying to put a hedge
[1:19:25] around them
[1:19:27] they
[1:19:30] invited to church yesterday to this
[1:19:32] video he didn't come that's okay keep
[1:19:34] praying by God's grace we'll pray for a
[1:19:35] hedge to be around his life
[1:19:38] all that the father's given me will come
[1:19:40] program says be thou faithful unto death
[1:19:42] be that's my last yeah that's my last
[1:19:44] name let's say in our feet musician's
[1:19:45] gonna come but that's quote you're
[1:19:46] probably familiar with us be thou
[1:19:48] faithful unto death he does not say be
[1:19:50] faithful until death
[1:19:54] but unto death
[1:19:56] Amen in other words obey the Lord's will
[1:20:00] for you to be a martyr
[1:20:02] you may have to steal your testimony
[1:20:04] with your blood thousands eight Millions
[1:20:06] have died during all these all the ages
[1:20:08] they died in the faith like Antipas the
[1:20:10] faithful martyr they held not their
[1:20:12] lives dear unto death
[1:20:16] often we think that if it would be
[1:20:18] almost impossible to be a martyr
[1:20:24] I honestly think that like how in the
[1:20:26] world
[1:20:27] could I have such an anointing to be a
[1:20:29] martyr you know as a school teacher
[1:20:30] we've had two Vietnam veterans come into
[1:20:32] our classes over the years and one of
[1:20:34] them was in the Vietnam prison for I
[1:20:37] think it was three years
[1:20:38] and they would beat him and they would
[1:20:40] you know infections
[1:20:42] they beat him so bad he had numerous
[1:20:44] surgeries when he got back
[1:20:48] but he never lost hope and I think how
[1:20:50] could these guys survive like wouldn't
[1:20:51] you go crazy I I would think where did
[1:20:54] you go crazy
[1:20:56] every day you know it was going to be
[1:20:57] they almost starving to death they beat
[1:20:59] you they abuse you all these things
[1:21:02] yet they held out just for a natural
[1:21:04] life
[1:21:06] they they refused to give in
[1:21:11] and thank God they were rescued
[1:21:14] but we think how could we make it
[1:21:16] through that how can we make it through
[1:21:17] what program tells us how he says
[1:21:20] he says recall remember the faith that
[1:21:23] we daily use to Triumph in Christ is the
[1:21:26] same faith that upholds the polycars and
[1:21:29] all martyrs
[1:21:31] think about that the last time Satan
[1:21:32] think about the last time Satan almost
[1:21:34] had you tempted to do something but yet
[1:21:37] you overcame
[1:21:38] that same Faith would help you overcome
[1:21:40] will be the would be the same Faith you
[1:21:42] would need to overcome if you were going
[1:21:43] to be a martyr
[1:21:46] because your flesh would want to say no
[1:21:48] I don't want to die no I don't want to
[1:21:49] die but yet the soul would say yes I'll
[1:21:52] do whatever God calls me to do right is
[1:21:55] that right
[1:21:57] how many spirits are there church
[1:21:58] there's only one spirit how many faced
[1:22:00] are there there's only one faith
[1:22:02] One Faith one Lord one baptism I love
[1:22:06] that the Supreme Faith The Temptations
[1:22:08] that's when you'll feel the spirit of
[1:22:10] God the most Hallelujah hey
[1:22:12] let's borrow heads here
[1:22:16] now let's make this a time of prayer I'm
[1:22:17] going to Trump the live stream
