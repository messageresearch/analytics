austin good beat buddy nice job way better than me amen praise god let's get your bibles here let's uh turn to the word of god i started first thessalonians chapter five i'm going to take a little break from the series i just kind of wanted to look at this thought i've been going through some of my notes or as i was preparing i i wanted i realized i wanted to preach on that uh situation a few months ago where i was trying to correct a brother that had 24 false statements in a sermon and i just went through real quickly i didn't preach it but i'd like you to hear it and i like to preach on that and i have some things to share at the end that i'll stop the livestream that kind of connects to that so lord winning i'll try to be mindful of the time here got a lot of ground to cover but i'm glad to be on the lord's side praise god i'm glad i'm on jesus's ground amen we've got a lot of ground to cover but we can make it by god's grace and i'll just let austin and lena know this is more kind of a deeper subject you know uh the last few weeks i've been preaching very more simple subjects you know like the cities of refuge and some of those other thoughts the lord is my portion last wednesday you know very very simple things but very needful we need to hear those praise god and i think it was evidence because we had numerous people come up for prayer that we need to hear those from time to time now today's gonna be a little deeper you know it's gonna be uh i'm not sure all these things will be familiar to you brother but it'd be good to hear and it'll help you i'm sure it'll help you on your walk with the lord you too lena i'm sure it'll help you by god's grace so uh let's go to first thessalonians 5 21. i told some brothers outside of our church preachers that i was going to preach on this tonight if they'd like to listen to it later to kind of understand the reasons why i think this is such an important sermon to preach i guess i'll just put it like that i never would want to attack somebody but the same time i felt like this sermon that i listened to i felt like it was a subtle attack upon the fivefold ministry and so i make sure i want to preach this so that it's fresh on my mind and that i can share it perhaps i'll share it with the brother as well i wrote him an 18-page letter two-sided single-spaced that's a lot of let that's a lot of writing there so trying to help the brother and uh by god's grace he didn't want my help and that's okay but maybe a sermon will help him as well i want to try all those means and it kind of connects to what i want to say at the end for our home church you know so i don't want to say say it right now but after we close the live stream i'll share that first thessalonians 5 21. let's all read this if we can let's read this on three one two three prove all things hold fast that which is good now just for the sake of you know austin alina let's read the next verse 22. let's read this one one two three abstain from all appearance of evil so paul says when you're trying to be a christian and uh you know serving god try to abstain from all appearances of evil even if it looks evil even if there's like a shred of it try to stay away from it that's going to help you walk in the holy spirit's anointing if you try to avoid all appearance of evil but notice that first statement prove all things see we have to prove and make sure what we hear is the truth okay now here's how you do it acts 17 11. go there if you've got your bible acts 17 11. here's how you do it acts 17 11. so these are the bereans which paul was a missionary towards they heard paul preach and after hearing paul preach they didn't say well i believe everything he said that's not what they did they saw the miracles they saw the teaching but then the bible said they spent all their time searching the scriptures to make sure what paul said was the truth remember they didn't have new testament letters they had old testament letters so paul was dealing with the old testament showing how there was prophecies about jesus christ okay and they had to go back and make sure this man was saying the right thing that's what i want you to do tonight don't take my word for it take the bible's word for it i'll fail i'm not perfect i believe i'm a true servant of god but i make mistakes everybody makes mistakes only christ is the one who makes no mistakes but this here's the lesson we get we got to take everything back to the word so let's read this on three one two three these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and search the scriptures daily whether those things were so so every day you need to have a meeting with the lord and say holy spirit show me if the things that i've heard are right or not amen that's about heads for word of prayer can we let me just say a prayer for you and myself heavenly father god we're here again lord i've been coming to church now here lord this bride of christ fellowship for over 15 years i've loved every service i've been so thankful to be a part of it we're thankful tonight lord for another opportunity to be in your house i pray you'd anoint me lord to preach this and lord be able to prove all things lord god and father lord to search the scriptures whether these things be so so i pray you'd help me and help the people lord god and i just pray this would be a help to our brother lord and all the brothers lord that i've been talking with these last few days here on the text messages and emails and things that it could be a help to the saints of god lord god as we as we endure to labor in the doctrine lord god that you might be honored lord god that your word might be lord magnify dear jesus so we give you thanks and praise in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you for being seated praise god i'm going to set a timer i'll try to go uh a hour here and hopefully that'll be okay for tonight i got a lot of distance to cover so i got you go ahead switch over this is i'm just going to call this prove all things part 17 here tonight and we'll look to the lord for his grace and strength here yeah i'm going to turn that okay so uh you know i preached 16 services on prove all things on this idea and uh i was dealing a lot with how william branham was a prophet but yet he was also a man too right and we have to rightly divide the tapes of brother branham right and this is different than any other day because there was no tape recordings in the day of martin luther there was no tape recorders in the days of paul or moses or uh some of these hot-tempered preachers right or hot-tempered women that they married right there's no tape recorder so we don't know everything that went on we're just we're told what's in the bible okay you having trouble honey getting to that is it not coming up i changed the adapters i changed to this one here oh maybe it fell out let me try that again it might have fallen out so i just wanted to be able to show some of these okay there we go thank you yeah that's my fault again it's my fault see it's always my fault see see forgive me it's always my thought that's true so help me jesus okay so we read our scriptures here now remember church i just want to give a visual we are trying to stand in the middle of the road right there's there's one road to heaven jesus said there's one road to heaven we're trying to stay in the road in the middle of the road right and when we stay in the middle of the road we're walking in truth and we're walking in love but satan's trying to push us off uh to leave the message or leave the bible teachings that god gave to brother branham and he's trying to uh and this side is known for their laschiviousness which means lawlessness right so people that leave the message they say oh you don't need to dress holy you don't need to live holy you can watch whatever you want you can cuss you can do whatever you want you know it's no problem god loves you i mean how can you make god love you more and i see they got these sly arguments like that that's true god can't love you more but god is god's given you a higher calling see they got all these subtle lies they slip into there you know evil reasonings the bible said they're reasoning unto men instead of reasoning the word of god so satan will try to push us off to that side where oh god loves you you can do whatever you want you still go to heaven that's not true jesus said if you don't repent and overcome he said i'll blot your name out of the book of life he said because you love darkness more than you love light we want to be light lovers tonight amen now the other side is the side that worships it goes into legalism and they basically worship brother branham they basically brother branham above the bible that's wickedness that's sin right but it's legalism because they say every word god's prophet said you have to make thus saith the lord right and i just so you know i did email our precious brother in jeffersonville today showing him three of his faults i don't know if i'll hear back but i emailed him today i don't know if we'll see i said please contact me back if you want to and i said i got all the quotes to back it up i do it in love church because if i i see that man and he has such a influence and if he won't repent i don't know what's going to happen so i do it because brother brandon says you correct people because you love them right you have to correct people because you love them so um so we have we have we have these examples people that leave the message i call them brother rams accusers you know they're on that side of lecheviousness they leave the truth then you have the side of legalists you know that exalt brother branham okay now we got to be careful uh because uh there's so many deceptions and the deceptions come by preachers many times because honest people want to they know that god always sends preachers they know that god's way is for a fifo ministry out of the bible and they know god never changes that because the bible said they're going to preach until we're all in the unity of the faith praise god i know it seems like there's less and less unity but that's true because those are the ones that are not born again but amongst those people that are born again there's more unity praise god amen it's true now here's the warning the bible said till we all all all the believers come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect or complete man that doesn't mean something that never sins it means something that's completely become all that god wants them to come see unto the measure of the stature or the maturity of fullness of christ in other words god wants you to reach the highest levels as a christian you can reach he wants you to be as much like jesus as you can possibly be you might be a a hundredfold you might have a hundred a hundredfold increase in your life you might bring forth lots of fruit that might be your cap and thank god that's that's the highest cap there can be right or you might be a 60-fold christian the bible says there's three kinds right three kinds of holy ghost-filled christians you bring a hundred-fold you're 60-fold or thirty-fold but this is saying god wants you to come to your fullness of your productivity as a christian or the fullness of your fruitfulness how many want to reach it praise god i don't want to fall short i don't want to have wasted seed you know i don't have a wasted life i don't want to lose my reward i want to bring forth abundantly unto jesus if not look if not we henceforth be no more children you see if we don't reach our maturity we're then we're not born again right and we're just children tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine so i don't have the fan out here but if i had the fan on i could throw a i could throw a paper up in front of there and blow the paper all around that's not the kind of life we want to live where any little thing we hear blows us out of control right right that preacher said that ah now what am i going to do and then the next preacher says that oh what about we don't want to be tossed around like a bunch of babies amen we want to be solid praise god the bible says the fivefold ministry makes you solid amen you're not tossed around and you're not easily disturbed amen praise god you know where you stand praise god you're not blown by all these false doctrines and winds but you stand on the rock of ages amen see by the every wind of doctrine by the slight of man that's the gambling of men they're trying to gamble to see what will get them the most clicks or the most views right or the most offerings what will give me the most money the most popularity and they'll say anything to be more popular or get more money and cutting craftiness they lie in wait to deceive their whole thing is to deceive because their god is their belly so they can have more prosperity naturally but the bible says we speak the truth in love and grow up into christ in all things in other words our our words should become more like the words of christ our thoughts should become more like the thoughts of christ our actions should become like more like the actions of christ so you grow up into him christ even the head okay now the main preacher i'm focusing on tonight i believe his his 24 mistakes were seeking to deceive others into lasciviousness or lawlessness and also as i listened more and more to it the spirit of fear i felt like fear was trying to get in there as well which would be legalism so it was a strange mixture because on one side uh yeah he was saying you don't have to have a home church or a pastor well that's leschiviousness right that's just law that says you don't need to be accountable you're your own authority you don't have to answer any authority but on the other side putting so much pressure on people fear like if you're not if you're not producing the fullness of christ then you're not even saved i mean that's basically what he's saying well i can never i can never manifest the fullness of christ because i'm not christ i don't have the fullness of the godhead only jesus does amen but using statements like that to bring people to fear so it's such a strange sermon it just struck me now that it's both lawlessness and legalism in the same thir and same sermon now brother graham's accusers i call him the brotherhood's accusers also seeks to deceive people until the shibuousness as seen in their bondage they see they leave they leave our teachings right they leave the bible they leave the bible and say oh you can watch all the movies you want right you can wear sexually suggestive clothing because there's no standards of modesty the bible just says modesty that's a lie women can preach over you which is ultimately a man losing his position and giving the wrong person the position right a dominating female spirit and then denominationalism oh you can go to catholic luther they're all filled with the holy spirit all catholics are filled with the holy spirit basically what they're saying lie that's a lie but see that's lasciviousness lawlessness but we will not be brought under the power of any of that bondage amen will not be brought under fear will not be brought under lies will not be brought under lusts or greed we won't be brought under that we'll be only obedient to the power of christ now the other side the vog side is legalistic because every word is thus saith the lord and they're brought into bondage to every thought every word every personal opinion of brother branham and it may just be his opinion but they're enslaved to that to say i believe it or yeah i'm going to do that or i have to do just like that and there's no room for christian liberty right so remember church there's only three motivations for your obedience you either obey god because of love that's us amen now don't don't don't be confused sometimes you are tempted by the enemy to serve god out of fear right or legalism and sometimes you are tempted to you know sin and say well i don't care what god's word says i'll just do whatever i want that's a temptation but we got to overcome it praise god see if we either serve god by our love for god or legalism i'm scared so i got to do everything i got to do every single thing and if i don't do it i'm going to be lost or less jimmy says who cares what the word says god loves me i can do whatever i want we're not going to be legalism or lasciviousness we're going to be under the love of god the liberty of the spirit because jesus said if you love me keep my commandments amen how many love jesus well see so that's what we got to do when we're tempted we've got to say ah we got to say god forgive me my flesh wants to do this but i'm going to crucify that desire because i love jesus more and i'm going to obey the word of god because i know god's trying to protect my life he knows if i obey him my life will be the best life it can possibly be like our brother austin knows right he was he was telling me about that he said as soon as you leave god's word he said uh you have all this condemnation right that's it every day right as soon as as soon as we and it happens to all of us brother whether we leave the church or not because all of us sin not just you it's all of us we all sin we all fall short of god's glory and so anytime we disobey god it's a sin and our conscience is gonna it's supposed to convict us so we'll say sorry jesus forgive me i'm back to loving you and i'm gonna obey you next time amen praise god amen that's right so we want to serve god by love and it's a constant battle church it's a constant battle to stay out of the ditch how many understand what i'm saying the church said it's a constant battle praise god you'll swerve like on the road sometimes when i'm driving off salinas sometimes i swerve a little bit i gotta get back to the middle you know what i mean i just gotta i gotta stay in the middle of the road praise god it's a constant battle jesus said walk the narrow road he said few there be that don't fall in the ditch that's in that's in matthew chapter 7 verse 14. jesus said few fine few can actually walk or ride this narrow road not many people can do it they either get into well i can sin and do whatever i want or i'm so scared i better do this and they never have the love of god in their hearts but love is what we are presenting love is how we're living we're going to battle the cheviousness we're going to battle legalism but ultimately love will prevail amen okay now let me skip back to where i was now remember i showed you the the side that left brother brandon i call him brother brahms accusers they deny 14 of paul's teachings i'm just going to go through these really quickly when they leave the message they some of them some of them not all of them some of them accept homosexuality some of them accept adultery some of them except fornication murder or birth control pills because those are murder pills right they'll flush out a a fertilized egg and people people only read the label that's what the label says my wife and i know because we were going to get them but then we saw that the holy spirit stopped us from getting them praise god because we just because we read the label so you got to read food labels too but you also got to read all the other labels all that read that little writing there because we didn't know better no one ever told us right so thank god the holy spirit's here to teach us praise god women preachers substance abuse smoking all this drinking and all this uh what was called fentanyl right do you know 30 000 more people have died from fentanyl overdoses this year than cova did you know that it's way it's a way bigger problem than clovid because kova is just a little more of an advanced flu that's all it is 30 000 more because they have the open borders right they're letting all the drugs come in and just kill off more and more americans it's more of a pandemic than the pandemic right just it's awful what these people think uh viewing sinful content like on your smartphone or netflix or whatever it is movie theaters that's a sin to do that shameful hair lengths men with uncut hair right or women with short hair right false conversions basically saying as soon as you repent you got the holy ghost basically saying everybody's got the holy ghost that's a lie and in modest clothing you can wear whatever you want jesus loves you well he loves you but he don't love how you're acting and you're tempting men right or men you're tempted women right if men dress sexy men can dress sexy too right also water baptism they change jesus's name or god's name the three works of grace they basically deny the baptism of the holy ghost uh the godhead they call god three persons but he's one person and then cross-dressing of course we know that we know that by history as well and then some of them deny the gifts of the holy ghost and yet they say they're free by denying the word of god it's impossible to be free when denying the word of god you're enslaved to these lies you're enslaved to these spirits right we saw i showed you this list of a month ago if you watch movies you're under the spirit of lust lust has ruled your life that demon of lust is ruling your life if you look at lustful things right uh the roman catholic church the mother harlot the antichrist spirit if you believe all the denominations are filled with the holy ghost you've accepted the antichrist spirit you're a slave to that in bondage to the antichrist spirit right if you're mocking brother branham or us or anybody you're under the spirit of mocking a prideful spirit right they call themselves professors they call themselves walking bibles they're under the spirit of pride and don't even know it they're under the spirit they're under a lying spirit when they when they when they say they know what brother bran was talking about or what uh they say they know all these assumptions they don't it's an assumption they're they're in bondage to a lying spirit but we've got the spirit of truth amen and all these all these other spirits i could go through all these i'm not going to go through those but all these are spirits of bondage and they're under obedience to the spirits of bondage now there's many disastrous effects of false teaching these two men in paul's day hymenous and philetus were preaching that the rapture had already happened and the bible said their word eat as a canker they say oh the rapture already happened you can just relax and and we're already in the millennium right basically we're already in the millennium there are some message churches that believe that very few but some believe that and the bible says that overthrows the faith of some if someone actually believes that jesus already raptured us and now we're just raptured in our souls and now as the millennium they would say well if it's the millennium then i can do whatever i want it's a thousand years of peace right that means that means i already got peace in my heart i can live however they want and the bible said that eats as a canker does or or it could go the other way and make you say jesus already raptured i miss the rapture i might as well i didn't make it jesus doesn't love me so i that will destroy my faith see how that will destroy your faith so either way to destroy your faith thinking that you're already in the millennium or jesus left you and you don't mean nothing to jesus so i'll just waste my my life away in in and i'll just drink my life away right or live my life in sin i'll live it up i'll paint the town red because jesus left me and he must not love me but the fact is jesus died for you and he does love you amen hallelujah and the rapture hasn't happened yet he's trying to get us ready praise god amen now that means a canker a gang green so false doctrine eats away like gangrene it just starts it eats away your body right it eats away your spiritual life slowly but surely false doctrines slowly make you feel like you're spiritually dead but when you've got truth if you'll receive it let me say it again but if you're hearing truth and if you'll receive it you'll feel alive that's why i felt alive all these years amen because we won't let false doctrine come in and we receive the truth praise god amen see it false doctrines destroy or overthrow that's what the word means in the greek it destroys people's faith they're not as firm they're not as faithful now i got to go faster the bible says now this is a little bit of a side note but the bible says if somebody eats meat that was sacrificed to an idol and a young christian sees it it might destroy his faith right because he thinks i can be a christian and i can eat food sacrificed to an idol so paul said don't destroy him with your meat for whom christ died in other words be careful if you're a mature christian be careful that you don't do things that cause your younger christian brothers sisters to stumble right so be careful how you live because people are watching you and you don't want to destroy their faith you want to build up their faith like i believe wine drinking wine is not a sin as long as you don't get drunk but the bible says the bible says never do it if a person's weak because they might see you drinking and then they'll go get drunk that's why i'll never drink alcohol in public never some people might but i won't because if they see a pastor doing it well i can do it i'll have one i feel so good give me another okay now i feel real good give me another and pretty soon they're drunk and now their faith has been destroyed so wisdom tells you i have the freedom to do it but i'm not going to do it in public right we'll do it at the lord's table praise god you can do it in your home if you want but you better be careful you don't get drunk in your home that's why i don't do it in my home either because i don't trust my flesh not that i don't trust my soul i trust my soul i don't trust my flesh because i'm easily i've already known through my sinful life i get easily addicted to substances alcohol or cigarettes or tobacco whatever i'm eating so i'm not even going to try i'm not going to let it go i'm not going to give it a try because i know better i don't want to cause my family to stumble i don't want to stumble i want to live pure for jesus that's just it's just a scripture it's romans 14 if you want to read that in your free time now i'm going to skip past that because it's a lie now let's get to these because i still got about bless you brother i see about 39 minutes left on this hour so that was about good 20 minute introduction right praise god pretty good now let's see nature's like yeah kind of amen thanks for honesty i appreciate that that's that's what we need to be honest now 24. can you believe that i could have found more in that sermon church but i just kind of got tired of going through it i was so grieved because i felt it was an attack on the fivefold ministry now uh here's number one now bear with me i'm going to try to hit the highlights i went through this quickly one time but i never really got the details i want to see us i want to hear i want you to see it the first false statement was taped churches are equal to fivefold churches because both can have the holy ghost i said brother you said they have the same holy ghost they're the ones that go to church god and god has people in both groups i said i believe you're wrong the truth is most not all of the tape people are not born again because they're breaking the word a person cannot be born again of the word and purposely deny the word see what word are they breaking they're breaking ephesians 4 8 through 16 and if they stay home then they're breaking hebrews 10 24 and 25. and those people that are staying home because of coven these last two years they're sinning too i understand staying home for a little while but when you realize it's just a cold when you realize it's just a fever you need to get back in the house of god stop being afraid god's your healer praise god heals cancer hears heals tuberculosis praise god he can heal covet amen it's nothing to god just trust god amen the bible says gather more as you see that day approaching and remember to change one word of paul's revelation is to be cursed in galatians 1 verses 6 through 12. so by definition tape churches cannot be equal because they limit the fivefold preaching which takes away from paul's commands therefore they're cursed the only way you could be in a tape church and be born again is if you got born again before you started the tape church and then you you live in a place where there's no preachers around there and so you got to play tapes but then if i was a man i'd preach anyway right because brother says if you fall in love with jesus you get so burned the people don't have a preacher you preach it yourself because you want the people to feed on the word of life amen remember there's only two quotes on tape churches and both of them say that brother adam recommends only do it if there's no other church around and look at all these churches around jeffersonville there's plenty of preachers around jeffersonville there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment there's plenty churches around here there's no reason we should push play if we've got men that love the word of god and we've got men that love to preach it and if you see the word taking effect in your life amen hallelujah and i said show me one scripture where it says we don't need more preaching show me that where paul ever said well we won't need the fivefold ministry at the end time because it's the seventh church age nonsense nonsense now there's a whole lot more i could say but every christian should have a pastor because it's in the bible jesus looked when jesus went on earth brother austin he looked at all the multitudes and the bible said he wept or he was sad because they were like sheep with no shepherd they were like sheep that had no shepherd to watch over them the word pastor means shepherd in other words jesus said i wish all these people had a godly pastor to feed them my gospel amen my revelation to pray for them when they're sick and they get well praise god amen to preach to them the truth of god's word i wish they all had a pastor where they could gather around and be fed the word of god they could grow and become a better christian and they would hear the word and they could be happy as a christian because you got the drink of the living water and you got the bread of the word of god amen hallelujah now number two return ministry churches are equal to fivefold churches now return ministry church okay i didn't ever explain to you guys tape churches are people that don't believe in preachers really well they do sometimes but they just want to press play on a tape and just listen to brother branham although he's dead you should do that in your own your own life but not for church services church services you need living preachers now there's another group that say brother brown is going to raise from the dead and come back it's ridiculous these people are so ridiculous uh they just they don't pray they don't pray enough they don't fast enough they don't read their bible enough that's the trouble right they're by the bible's not the absolute anymore it's brother branham and that's wrong brother rams pointed us to the absolute brother brown point us to the bible praise god just like billy graham or any any preacher any real preacher will point you to god's word amen i don't care what their name is they're a real preacher they'll point to jesus christ and say get to the bible read the bible obey the bible praise god but we got a special revelation no doubt of the bible and i said no return ministry yeah the brother said a return ministry person said don't separate there's no difference between us and them i believe you're wrong can you believe that there's no difference the brother said there's no difference between preaching churches and return ministry of churches that's not the truth every return ministry church i've heard of which is like three they all they're all idolatrous they're all worshiping brother branham and they're breaking many scriptures they add to the word and they essentially worship brother branham their major sin is looking for brother branham instead of jesus christ praise god our eyes our minds our thoughts should all be on jesus amen he's the one that's coming back amen he's the one that's returning the brother said there shouldn't be a wall between the tape people and the church people i believe you're wrong because the lies coming out of the tape churches the lies coming out of the return ministry churches are heresies and they're causing people to have a spiritual gang green and commit sins that's right and the three churches i know of have child abuse in them that are returned ministry child abuse adultery and more the three that i've heard of because i've talked to other brothers there that have gone there and they preach there and they know the problems of the churches see because that gay that false doctrine causes more and more sin it starts eating their spiritual lives it eats it up and they know and then they just they surrender to any sin they want to do it's wickedness all right number three there is this brother said there's a william random trial in heaven right now and every service is being watched by the great courtroom looking saying where's the evidence of brother branham's preaching i said brother i said there's the truth is there's no trial for brother branham going on in heaven now because trials are saved to the great white throne judgment brother abraham said the judgment isn't now he says he said the trial is the great white throne judgment praise god yes we will be judged but will be judged at the judgment scene of christ according to 2 corinthians 5 10. and then everyone else who's not born again will be judged at the great white throne judgment according to revelation 20 verse 11. right now the bible does say satan is accusing us before god day and night in revelation 10 12. but god is always having his way praise god and god is always waiting for us to repent and then when we do he says i don't see any charges there's no more charges it's all forgiven praise god amen he can't accuse us when it's under the blood amen so let him accuse whatever he wants just make sure that accusation doesn't last very long in other words confess your sins as quick as possible amen hallelujah but there's no court trial going on right now that judgment is saved for the end time number four this is a real real burner i uh this brother says there's three seeds on the earth right now he talks about brother branham seed oral roberts and billy graham each one planted different seeds now the reason this is i believe this was just brother branham's opinion and the reasoning is simple because the the bible says there's only two kinds of seeds the bible never says there's three kind of seeds the bible says there's two kind of seeds so let's read it let's go to matthew 13 37 would you get your bible there we need some readers lydia malachi matthew 13 37 now church there's only one quote in the message where brother rahm says three seeds and it's in that spoken word original seed sermon i believe brother man was just trying to find something as his opinion i do not believe there's three seeds because the bible doesn't say that the bible says there's only two seeds so let's see lydia you got it matthew 13 37 of course i'm going to ask my oldest go ahead great now go to verse 39 can you read that too okay now we don't have time to read all this but if you read all this there's only two seeds you have jesus's seed and you have the serpent seed or the devil seed there's only two there's not three kinds now i'm not talking about brother brown now i'm talking about the brother that preaches the brother said that billy graham and oral roberts preach denominational seed well any denominational seed is the seed of the antichrist well now you no longer have three seeds now you still have two seeds it's a total contradiction and it doesn't fit the bible because the two messengers that went down to sodom save souls amen they didn't plant denominational thoughts they saved lots all amen whatever seed they plan whatever word they preach it saved three souls amen it wasn't they didn't spread any denominational thoughts down there i know that's hard for message people to believe but most of them don't read their bibles that's the sad part about it just read your bible and again i'll share this brother emailed me back i'm sorry he sent me one text he and he just made this excuse he said well brother you're just way smarter than me and then he defended everything he just defended everything and said i don't want to talk about it god bless you well to me that proves you're wrong you can't i gave you 24 you can't even defend one of them and i said brother just let me know if i'm wrong on five of them let me know if i'm wrong on half of them if i'm wrong on 20 of them for crying out loud let me know if i'm just let me know if i'm right on any of them and the it don't he doesn't want to talk about anything the bible says to search the scriptures daily whether these things are so so see what does it show they're not searching the scriptures daily they won't even they won't even search the scriptures for their own preaching amen you hear me tonight they preach things and they won't even go search the scripture for what they preach god help us that real men of god that search the scripture know what they're saying and point us to the word of god amen i'm starting to get some fiery zeal here amen some fiery indignation amen because how can you be a preacher and not back up what you're preaching amen that means you're a lazy preacher and you're not even studying what you're saying you're just making things up as you go prove all things the bible said try every spirit whether it be of god amen ah there's only one quote on three seeds and then in the church age book brother brahm says there's only two seeds so that proves it he had five years to write that book and he made sure he didn't say three seeds it said two seeds now i could go on and on and on i got 18 pages single spaced i got quotes everywhere number five i'm gonna try to spare your i'm gonna try to spare you tonight i'm not gonna preach three hours tonight i could church i could preach four hours tonight i got so much material but i'm not gonna do that number five the fifth false doctrine the capstone has already been put on the church ages and we find ourselves in the very top of the capstone brother you said the breach isn't there anymore why because the capstone has been put on brother i believe you're wrong the church i'm sorry the truth is that the rapture is the time of the church ages being capped off with christ coming so this is new to austin so austin i'm going now that's the original one brother brand made but he corrected it later i'm sorry he changed his doctrine later but never corrected the picture okay so let me this is the real one that he taught this is you and i austin in the middle god adds all these anointings and then this capstone comes down and caps us off with the baptism holy ghost that's the baptism because god is love god is the holy ghost and brother this is right out of the scripture right here we don't have time to preach it tonight austin and lena but it's right here if you if you read this in your free time it says we have all these things and then love comes last it's right in the bible right and then the bible says we are we are a temple we're a building that god is building up so now when you have that understanding god is building up in every age god is building up christians to the last age and when god is done with the gentiles jesus christ returns this is jesus christ and he caps off the building of god and then god goes back to the jews that's a very quick summary there's a lot of scriptures i skipped over but it's all in the bible okay so this man saying oh the capstone's already on it i said that's not true the truth is it's only capped off when jesus christ returns praise god because that's what brother brahm said i have numerous quotes here what happened at that time the coming of that stone upwent the church into glory at the rapture because it ended with a gentile dispensation the man said sometime the capstone will return the head of it all and receive the bride unto himself praise god these are kind of deeper so don't feel bad you lena and austin you talked to my wife and i when we first came in the message we didn't understand anything anybody said the only thing we understood was water baptism so the preacher would preach all these things that he'd say and you need to be baptized in jesus name and i'd say amen i said amen that's right and i sit back down and i didn't understand anything else that's how it was for like the first month or two you know two or three months i don't understand nothing all i knew is that the bible said be baptized in jesus christ's name and i believed it amen so don't feel bad because we all got to go through this unless you're born and raised and then you start you know but then you still got to understand things right my children still ask great questions questions are a good thing that's why on sunday nights when in february when we start back up you're going to hear all these good questions of these children back here they ask me some of the hardest questions i've ever been asked in my life and then that's when you can ask questions any time but that's a good time to ask questions number six i'm going fast this brother said there's three ages in this last age today then he said in the 80s there was a sanctification and then he said the baptism holy ghost fell around 2 000. that's just ridiculous he said i don't know you know i know where he got he got it from his own experience he's getting he's basing these from his own thoughts rather than the word of god but that's wrong the lutheran age brother was in the reformation 1500s the wesley's age was in the 1700s and now we're in the branham age or the holy ghost age as far as the baptism of the holy ghost okay but he tried to squeeze all of it in the last 30 years or 40 years that's ridiculous okay the truth is that individual believers go through the three works of grace in this age because that's the same in every age right but not that luth or wesley branham ages all took place in 1965 or after 1965 yeah after that's a that's for more advanced people you know as far as i mean not that you guys are in advance but you know they've just heard more right so don't feel bad don't feel bad feel good jesus loves you feel good feel real good yeah jesus loves you number seven he said the saints in heaven are on dangerous ground can you imagine that he says saints that are in heaven right now with the angels are on dangerous ground and i got all the time stamps he can go back and listen to it if you want but you don't want you don't want to listen to it and i'll be honest some preachers don't listen to it either because they're scared because they're either scared or it takes too much time to find the truth but church we ought to be really interested in the truth of god and they say they're between life and death during this trial that's going on and everyone who died in the church ages is hanging in the balance they're not going to make it without the evidence of us manifesting that third seed of brother branham's seed that's ridiculous it's a misunderstanding of hebrews 12 where it says without us they cannot be perfected that's a misunderstanding i said brother the truth is the heavenly saints already have eternal bodies they already got eternal life how are you going to hang in the balance how can you be hanging between eternal life and eternal death when you've already got it amen you've already got eternal life a perfect body a word body in other words you've already got it it's already sealed there's no changing you're not there's there's no change there's no worrying about it you're you're there you're arrived you've got the nature of god amen hallelujah you know all these for all these i say will you please show me a scripture if i'm wrong i'm still waiting two months later this is october so november i'm still waiting two months later for one scripture one thing to show me that i'm wrong but it's an important church i'll show you at the end it's important number eight there's more grace now than when jesus died and mercy is greater now than it was then and you showed mercy to jesus christ i said brother you're wrong the truth is that mercy or forgiveness of sins only comes through substitutionary blood the same blood from jesus cross offers the same mercy both now in the past and all time show me one scripture that says uh jesus blood is not was not as great in his day as it is in our day there's no scripture on that and that's why he doesn't give give me any answers and i say this in love i'm kind of fired up now if our brother watches please know that i'm not i'm not upset i'm just kind of fired up because i want to stand for the truth number nine on the day of pentecost heaven was empty that's not true the truth is jesus body was sitting at the right hand of the majesty on high on the day of pentecost where he still sits today praise god and where's the scripture uh malakai get a scripture luke 20 verse 42 and 43 buddy you got it let's see how fast he can be what time you ready thousand one thousand two look at that yeah go ahead buddy luke 20 42 and 43. amen so jesus went up to heaven and he sat down and the bible says he sits down till all the enemies are under his feet is the pope under his feet right now is russia under is china under his feet right now no is the coronavirus under his feet right now no all enemies will be under jesus feet and then he gets up amen praise god hallelujah and brother ram did say i have quotes or brother brahm did say god's jesus bodies up in heaven and then he sent the spirit down to the earth making up the body of christ number 10 god sent his feminine part to earth at pentecost that's not true the truth is god cannot be divided into two separate male and female parts as he's infinite so no feminine part of god came to earth on the day of pentecost and i said if so please show me a scripture and i'll change my thought i know the type he's trying to use adam and eve but that doesn't work that was just a type god doesn't have a actual feminine part and a female part god doesn't have that because the bible doesn't say that it's a type number eleven there's coming a time in the church ages before the rapture when the fullness of god comes in the bride i said that's not true the fullness of god is only in jesus christ and cannot be in bride in the bride until uh the new jerusalem okay all right in order to have the fullness of the godhead you have to have all power and authority right in matthew 28 jesus said all power and authority is given unto me it never said it was given to us we have a portion of power we have a portion of authority but we don't have it all all of it was given to jesus there's no scripture that says we have all power and authority and here's where the fear starts getting put in here you'll see it in a little bit now uh lydia ephesians 1 23. see how that i put so much pressure forgive me each other i mean uh i appreciate all their work though ephesians 1 23. in ephesians 1 23 there will be a time when all the fullness is in the bride but it's going to be shared between jesus and the bride it's in the future home so read ephesians 1 23. there it is so when the body of christ is with jesus christ in the new jerusalem then the bible said all the fullness of god will be fulfilling them all in all but not right now and i don't even believe before the rapture right because we can't have all the power and authority as long as we have sin in our bodies there's no way we'll have all the power and authority that's why jesus could have all power and authority because he didn't have sin in his life amen think about that church think about your sin nature what would you do with god's authority with your sin nature when you're feeling upset what would you do what would you do let's say you're let's say you're mad at you're you're you're hubby you're you're mad at your wife and you have all power and authority god just do this or that i mean can you imagine what you'd say and then you regret it because you still have sin in your life right you still that's why we can't have the fullness of the godhead until we have brand new bodies amen do we have theophanies glorified bodies and all three are all in one and there's no more devil there's no more temptation that's at the new jerusalem amen like ephesians 1 23 says when all the fullness of god fills everything but not before that and i said so i told the brother i said brother we don't need the fullness to go in the rapture because enoch didn't need it amen john i'm sorry elijah didn't need the fullness of the holy ghost he just needed an invitation from heaven praise god and that's all we need a door open in heaven hallelujah amen he did it under the blood of bulls and goats but we'll do it by the blood of christ amen god's lamb glorious church i'll tell you that's move i love the word don't you then the brother said god came to rapture the bride at the council of nicaea i said brother the truth is jesus coming to rapture the bride is at the end of the laodicean church age because it was predestined before the foundation of the world jesus is the one that wrote the seven letters to the seven churches so jesus knew the rapture was after the laodicean age not the third church age these people they what they do saints is they take one quote and they run a mile with it and they fail to go read the bible or even consider what the bible says brother ram did make that statement right because he was talking about when the church married the state you remember that at the council in isaiah the church married the state through constantine so he said brother man was just dramatizing saying well jesus came to rapture the bride but his bride married the state it was just it was just a drama or it was his own opinion but jesus christ knew i'm not rapturing the bride until the seven church age is over that's why i wrote seven letters i mean you would think people would understand that is this okay brother austin and lean is this okay some of it some some of it might be too difficult but but we can always ask questions that's that's the best part as a pastor i always have more sermons i can preach preach more about god's grace 13 the brother said the church age has ended the truth is the current church age is over at the rapture i have two quotes on that brother brahms said it hasn't ended when it ends the church is gone so as long as the church is here how many church members are here how many bride members are here he said it hasn't ended yet praise god as long as we're here the church age is not over and that's where people get concerned confused about the bride age the bright age is just the baptism of the holy ghost that's all it is praise god it's not something separate brother man says we're still as long as the we're still here laodicea is still going on but we have a special age amen we have a special time when we've got the revelation of the word and our hearts are restored back to the apostolic fathers amen and all truth has been restored that's the bright age amen the baptism of the holy ghost with all the mysteries finished oh thank god amen number 14 now jesus is in you making you the fullness of the godhead bodily and i said the bible says jesus christ had the fullness of the godhead bodily not us only jesus christ has that i got way more way more now here's where it gets kind of personal the brother said anyone that believes uh you can't make the rapture without a pastor has the mark of the beast and basically the brother is saying i preached the mark of the beast i guess that's why it meant so much to me to kind of try to correct this because i believe show me a scripture where god is not going to use the fivefold ministry to bring unity to the church show me one show me well if there's none that says that and ephesians 4 says when he's going to use the five full ministry till we all come in the union of faith then all the holy ghosts feel saints gotta have a pastor and the church said show me one where you don't need the five full ministry you're never gonna find one show me one so this brother is basically saying i'm preaching the mark of the beast but you know what when it looks like it he's saying tape churches are the same return ministry churches are the same we're all the same he's actually the one preaching the mark of the beast right because we're all the same doesn't matter if your return or tape or or fivefold or not no fold he's the one basically saying it's the mark of the beast for them we're all all the same we we all can go to heaven we're all going to rapture nonsense you don't have any scripture for that the scripture says the fivefold ministry perfects you in the image of jesus christ the stature of jesus christ number 15 or sorry 16 yeah and then he kind of lumps us all together and says the message believers accept the fivefold ministry instead of the holy ghost well i said the truth is some of them accept preachers more than christ because then when the preacher falls away they fall away amen but there are some of them that accept jesus christ and no matter who falls away they stay with the bible because they love the bible amen because they did not accept a preacher they accepted jesus christ the one the preacher was talking about amen hallelujah so if i would fall away god forbid but i fall away you'd stay strong because you believe in jesus christ i'm not jesus christ i can never be it's impossible i fall short of the glory every single day but i'm pointing you to jesus christ amen and you need to search the scriptures daily to make sure these things are so and then he see this is an attack on the fivefold ministry here's another one he says it's a weakness to say you need a home church he said you're weak if you say if i don't have a home church i just can't stay in the right place i say brother you're downplaying the need to have a home church by making it sound like only a weak believer feels a need for a home church i believe you're wrong the truth is ephesians 4 and many brother ram quotes say we're perfected by the fivefold ministry without it we're immature and tossed by every wind of doctrine i have quotes from brother brown said you better stay where the spirit of god is being poured out in the church look at all of our friends that have left church and they stopped coming to church look what happens they're no longer under the pouring out of the holy ghost and they get worldly they get sinful they leave god's water amen and they dry up but if you stay here you stay fresh amen you stay drinking on the water of god you'll grow you'll be like jesus amen hallelujah you want to help the poor amen you want to help the fatherless and the widows you'll send people money you'll do whatever you can even if you don't know him you'll send them money because you love god and you want to love god's people praise god become more like jesus all the time and then he said nowhere in the messenger bible does it say you cannot make it without the five full ministry and i said again ephesians 4 says we're perfected with the five full ministry without it you're tossed by every wind of doctrine see it's an attack on basically its attack on me preachers and all of us preachers that love the word of god number 19 the fivefold ministry today is the oral roberts pentecostal group because the spirit moves in the tape church is the billy graham seed the truth is there's only two seeds god's seed in the serpent seed the true bride church has the seed of god that's kind of a repeat but just let you know this brother calls us uh oral roberts churches i just preached on oral roberts he was all about money and church we're not all about money keep your money if you want you'll see god won't bless you keep your ties you'll see you'll find out real fast but god said give a tenth to support the church so you can have a place to worship amen right so they can study and pray and preach the word of god to you feed your souls amen praise god but brother roberts was begging he said if you don't give me eight million dollars god's gonna kill me and that and they raise the eight million dollars to build a building and now the building's falling apart i mean and then he asked for a million more dollars to make a hospital that only lasted eight years it's not even it's not even operating today god doesn't save the world by money god saves the world by love amen god saves the world by the holy ghost amen cleaning out your life washing you and making you a new person amen that's how he saves people not by money but love amen hallelujah the brother said there's a prophecy or decree that the fullness of the godhead bodily would again be manifest in the bride i said there's no prophecy now look he's saying there's prophecy i'm saying show me prophecy and he won't even show me a prophecy so what does that mean he's falsely prophesying he says there's prophecy but there's no prophecy the only time the fullness of god is in us is when we have new bodies in the new jerusalem and i have scripture for that and i'm open to correction if somebody can show me wrong as long as we have sin in this guy there'll never be the fullness because it wasn't meant to be us it was meant to be the fullness in jesus christ the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in him colossians 1 and then colossians 2 9. now look he brings it down to fear look at this i'm almost done i'm 24. look at this i still got five six minutes left on my hour he said he looks at the congregation is there one person here who can make the word live the fullness of the godhead bodily that is so ridiculous that's asking which of you can walk on water like jesus nobody can do that which if you can raise the devil if you can why don't you go to the funeral raise somebody from the dead help out a family that's struggling he's putting all this pressure you it's impossible we can't have the fullness of the godhead bodily the truth is no bride member can do that only jesus christ makes the fullness of the godhead live he said there has to be an evidence in our lives that brings the saints back to life in other words you've got to bring the saints back to life i ain't bringing anybody back to life i never could i never will jesus christ is going to bring people back to life jesus christ brother branstad is the one who does the shout voice and trump amen it's jesus christ calling the dead back to life it's not me show me a scripture where it says you call the dead back to life you don't shout voice trump shout jesus shout voice of the archangel trump of god where are you in there you're not in there so don't worry about it don't put pressure on yourself don't live in fear live in faith but see how these preachers like to do it like to put pressure on people fear they're putting the spirit of fear on people and then he made it seem like brother branham tabernacle played tapes often when brother branham was alive and there's no proof of that the truth is brother branham tabernacle rarely had tape services and those services never resembled the modern tape services like think about this did you know sometimes at tabernacle services today they invite brother brown their pastor to preach and it's like inviting a dead person to preach it's so evil it's spiritualism because it's contact with the dead did you know that they hold they hold weddings and let brother branham do the wedding on a tape i got video of it i watch it i'm sure i'm sure some of you have too i could i could look it up real easily they brother man never did that and this brother is saying well however it is now and tape services is the same way it was when brother brown was alive that's nonsense it wasn't that way when brother brown was alive he'd say see you saints brother neville's going to preach the word to you amen a living man with the fire of god in his soul with the baptism of the holy ghost feeding god sheep amen hallelujah it's not these lies they're talking about today god's spirit will always point us to truth now i'm feeling really fiery over here got a lot of zeal here so forgive me if i love truth last one now i stopped early i could have found more false teachings in this one sermon it's like a two hour two and a half hour sermon i could have found way more but i stopped at 24 i thought that's a pretty good number the 24 elders right that's a good number now i made a video on this brother ram did say this he said the word from pentecost so acts chapter 2 won't work for today but brother brown was talking about the rapture pentecost will get you the baptism of the holy ghost that will work today but that's not enough to get you in the rapture you need more scriptures to be fulfilled right because acts 2 has been in effect all this time but we need god to fulfill the rapture scriptures if we're going to go in the rapture because all the saints down through the ages with the holy ghost they've all died so we need god to fulfill prophecy in other words right just a holy ghost scripture won't take in the rapture you need god to fulfill the shout the voice and the trump amen we need god to fulfill the trump of god the last trump hallelujah where we're changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's what he's talking about we need that scripture fulfilled today if we're going to be raptured praise god just all this means is we need a different scripture for the rapture and just not the scripture for pentecost because that's not rapture scripture see he was
