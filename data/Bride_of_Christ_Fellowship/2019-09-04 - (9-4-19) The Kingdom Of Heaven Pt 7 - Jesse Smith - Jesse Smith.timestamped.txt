[14:18] one scheduled right now for October but
[14:22] I'm trying to get brother Dennis McBride
[14:27] for November so but I don't have that
[14:29] confirmed yet so right now we just have
[14:31] brother Matt come in Lord willing
[14:34] so let's take a few prayer requests now
[14:37] tonight there's a person I talked to
[14:41] last night you know people call me leave
[14:45] me voicemails you know from the YouTube
[14:47] videos but this woman's name was Carla
[14:50] she's a grandmother and doesn't get to
[14:51] see her grandchildren because she's
[14:53] rejected for Christ and so she asked if
[14:55] we could pray for her that she could see
[14:57] her grandchildren and change her
[14:59] children's hearts so it's a pray for
[15:01] this woman named Carla anyone else have
[15:04] a protest Haven or Sargeras

[15:59] blessed him and he went home the next
[16:01] day so the parents were worried like he
[16:03] might die even it was such a scary

[30:45] let's take our Bibles here tonight let's
[30:48] go to Matthew chapter 13 I'd like to
[30:49] continue looking at the kingdom of
[30:52] heaven here by the grace of the Lord
[30:59] Matthew 13 verse 3 like to greet
[31:04] everybody the name of Lord tonight good
[31:05] to see the Saints in the house the Lord
[31:06] and thanks again for supporting the
[31:08] Sunday service with brother Nathanael I
[31:11] talked to him last night and he was
[31:12] really happy with how everything went he
[31:14] said we had a little strange visitor so
[31:17] he tried to talk to him and just know
[31:20] that in the future if that would happen
[31:21] you know we have to watch those people
[31:24] kind of closely and that's probably my
[31:26] fault I know I knew someone was bringing
[31:29] the person but I just thought he'd be a
[31:30] normal person I should have warned you
[31:32] know maybe Aaron or brother Amen or
[31:34] somebody to kind of watch him so I do
[31:37] apologize about that brother Nathaniel
[31:41] was concerned and he shared some of some
[31:45] concerns with me but thank the Lord that
[31:48] everyone was okay by a grace of God what
[31:50] I mean is that one of our visitors maybe
[31:52] had some mental trouble so I'm not sure
[31:54] if you could tell or not on Sunday but
[31:58] we thank the Lord that all as well
[32:00] praise God
[32:01] thank God for His grace Matthew 13 3 we
[32:08] had a wonderful time in Pennsylvania
[32:09] I'll be sharing some specific
[32:10] testimonies I there was it was such a
[32:13] wonderful move of repentance it was
[32:14] mostly in repentance numerous people
[32:17] came up for healing - I don't know who
[32:19] may have got healed though instantly I
[32:20] don't know if it'll be a if it was a
[32:22] miracle or if it'll be divine healing or
[32:24] how will work but on Sunday I want to
[32:27] give like some specific examples just to
[32:30] kind of show all of us that no matter
[32:34] what stage of life because we had young
[32:35] old very young come seeking the things
[32:38] of God
[32:39] was really beautiful and brother Jim
[32:41] said it was one of the best revival
[32:42] meetings they've ever had in the church
[32:44] so all glory to Jesus for that the Lord
[32:48] was leading Eve to fast and pray you
[32:50] know a couple days last week for the
[32:52] meetings and I'm sure some people were
[32:55] there fasting and praying as well but it
[32:58] was such a wonderful move of the Lord
[32:59] and I think our last service was five
[33:03] hours on Sunday so we got start at 11:00
[33:05] and we got out of 4:00 p.m. so it was a
[33:07] la nice long service a lot of Prayer
[33:10] I still got my voice so I thank the Lord
[33:12] for that so praise the Lord Matthew 13 3
[33:17] so praise God now I'd like to look at
[33:22] tonight with part 7 familiar parable I
[33:25] want to go a little deeper into it
[33:27] because I want to preach all these 16
[33:29] parables we looked at last well we've
[33:33] been looking at the last few weeks and
[33:35] trust it'll be a blessing to everyone
[33:37] okay I was looking for something all
[33:39] right there's a little DAP tur all right
[33:41] it's Matthew 13 verse 3 and he spake
[33:46] many things unto them in parables saying
[33:48] behold a sower went forth to sow and
[33:51] when he sowed some seeds fell by the way
[33:53] side and the fowls came and devoured
[33:54] them up some fell upon stony places
[33:57] where there where they had not much
[33:59] earth and for with they sprang up
[34:02] because they had no deepness of earth
[34:04] and when the Sun was up they were
[34:07] scorched and because they had no root
[34:09] they withered away and some fell among
[34:13] thorns and the thorns sprung up and
[34:15] choked them let's all read verse 8 if we
[34:17] can let's hear your voices and we'll
[34:19] join all of our voices together on verse
[34:21] 8 on three one two three but other fell
[34:25] into good ground and brought forth fruit
[34:27] some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some
[34:31] thirtyfold verse nine who hath ears to
[34:35] hear let him hear
[34:36] let's have a word of Prayer if you have
[34:38] anything on your heart just make it
[34:39] known unto God maybe through raising a
[34:41] hand or you know we're private requests
[34:43] in your heart I need the Lord's help
[34:45] here tonight Heavenly Father we love you
[34:48] Lord God Lord as as we go on serving you
[34:51] Lord those words ring
[34:52] more true that the longer reserved via
[34:54] the more we need you Lord God and we
[34:57] need the every hours that song says Lord
[35:00] it's made more clear to me all the time
[35:02] that I need you more every hour dear
[35:04] Jesus not less
[35:06] I need you more Lord so help me tonight
[35:08] I'm reporting from my post to duty Lord
[35:11] Jesus I need your grace bless the lady
[35:14] the Saints and all your people the young
[35:16] and old Lord and father just pray your
[35:19] spirit will bless us speak to us here
[35:21] tonight father we love you we want to
[35:23] hear from heaven dear God and we prayed
[35:25] for that Lord and I just pray that Lord
[35:27] each and every heart would receive your
[35:29] word and bless the Saints those here
[35:31] those live streaming that maybe couldn't
[35:33] make it and those that don't have a home
[35:35] church that are live streaming God may
[35:36] administer them may they find a good
[35:38] home Church Lord so they don't have to
[35:40] livestream anymore the father will give
[35:42] you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name
[35:44] the church said Amen god bless you being
[35:47] seated notes have been I've used in the
[35:58] past about two years ago because this is
[36:01] at the parable on the four kinds of
[36:03] ground so I'm not quite ready for it yet
[36:05] then even I'll switch over in just a
[36:07] moment and do some teaching on the
[36:12] parables okay should be ready now the
[36:20] Lord willing we'll look at these here
[36:22] and I'll just to be a blessing to
[36:24] everyone so we like to look at this
[36:30] thought here and also this Sunday as we
[36:36] said carry in and then I like to preach
[36:38] one service will have two services one
[36:42] service I like to preach on the gifts of
[36:44] the Holy Spirit as we start looking at
[36:46] which gifts we may have and I really
[36:49] appreciate you know we've had people
[36:50] come up for prayer in the last few weeks
[36:52] and asking God to show them their gifts
[36:54] that's a beautiful prayer I've prayed
[36:57] the same thing in my life and and in
[36:59] fact almost the whole church on Sunday
[37:01] and now being came up for prayer to know
[37:03] their gifts or to be more diligent with
[37:05] their gifts
[37:06] so it was a really special time in the
[37:08] Lord I think anyone that really is
[37:10] sincere about Jesus Christ wants to know
[37:12] what gifts they've been given so that
[37:15] they can be faithful with them we know
[37:17] this is not a picnic kingdom this is a
[37:20] laboring in the kingdom that we don't
[37:22] join the kingdom of God to go to a
[37:24] picnic we join the kingdom of God that
[37:27] we might labor in the vineyard praise
[37:29] God and we might you know as it were
[37:31] climb up on those ladders and you know
[37:33] pick some apples out in the vineyard or
[37:35] labor and the hot Sun and you know we
[37:38] know we just got a labor one our church
[37:40] you know we're not much longer to labor
[37:42] so may God help us to labor more as we
[37:44] see that Day approaching praise God
[37:47] so I want to devote one service to
[37:49] looking at gifts and just come prayed up
[37:50] if you would I'll probably have like
[37:53] little sheets to pass out that's my
[37:54] what's what I got playing in my mind
[37:56] right now I don't have it printed out
[37:58] yet but I want to give everybody a sheet
[38:00] that has the nine gifts of the Spirit on
[38:03] it and descriptions of each and then you
[38:05] can write down where you've seen it in
[38:06] your life or in the life of saints here
[38:10] or it could be you know someone outside
[38:12] the church just so we have a better idea
[38:15] about the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[38:18] because most of us know pretty it's
[38:20] pretty clear about miracles divine
[38:22] healing tongues interpretation
[38:25] those are pretty clear okay but the ones
[38:28] we need many times to understand more
[38:30] our discernment wisdom and knowledge and
[38:33] I'm missing one or two there so so I
[38:37] want to look at that one service and
[38:39] then the other service I like to look at
[38:41] the Holy Ghost so I had some good
[38:46] questions from some of the Saints and
[38:49] I'd like to look at the Holy Ghost they
[38:51] were asking me about is the Holy Ghost a
[38:53] new birth or is it just the baptism so I
[38:56] want to look at that question on Sunday
[38:58] and what I'll do I'll probably call it
[39:00] rightly dividing the word because it's
[39:03] one of those subjects where brother
[39:04] Branham changed his teaching as the
[39:06] message went on and so we we want to we
[39:09] want to recognize that and then we want
[39:12] to find we want to find the foundation
[39:14] in the word so and we want to show that
[39:17] to you by the grace of the Lord so
[39:19] were good questions and I want to be
[39:21] able to help the Saints so Lord willing
[39:25] unless the Lord would change something
[39:26] he's of course all in control unless he
[39:30] would change something I want to look at
[39:32] that direction I'd like to set a date
[39:33] for communion so I'll try to text the
[39:36] church maybe let's shoot for October for
[39:39] another Lord's Supper and then I can I
[39:42] like to I like to let brother Aaron know
[39:44] so you can take off work and then anyone
[39:46] else like sister Connie maybe could take
[39:49] off work or maybe find the Sunday that
[39:51] Connie doesn't have to work and then all
[39:53] the saints can be here for the Lord's
[39:54] Supper
[39:55] praise God all right so let's look here
[39:59] to the Word of God here tonight let's
[40:02] look at part 7 and trust to be a
[40:05] blessing to you so let's review real
[40:07] quick those 16 parables and there are
[40:14] themes so you see themes in the the
[40:17] kingdom of heaven two of them deal with
[40:19] sin again the mustard seed and then the
[40:23] leaven hid by the woman and then three
[40:26] of them deal with the rapture or the
[40:29] Holy Ghost this is the parable of the
[40:31] wedding garment ten virgins course we
[40:33] owe the oil and the great supper that's
[40:38] when I was reading today and that one's
[40:40] you it just deals with excuses if you
[40:42] remember that they made three excuses
[40:44] and he made three calls that the the
[40:48] Bible just calls him a rich man it
[40:49] wasn't a king it just says a rich man
[40:51] made a feast a great feasts and he made
[40:53] three calls the first was rejected made
[40:56] light of the second one was calling the
[40:59] the main hall in the blind which looks
[41:01] like divine healing and then the last
[41:04] one was the highways and hedges and then
[41:08] Jesus and Jesus actually speaks it to a
[41:10] Jew so Lord willing maybe we'll look at
[41:12] that one next Wednesday because I've
[41:13] been studying on that one so it's spoken
[41:15] to the Jews because the man kind of cozy
[41:17] up to Jesus and he said oh Jesus he said
[41:19] blessed is he who eats bread in the
[41:21] kingdom of heaven and Jesus said let me
[41:23] tell you a parable buddy he kind of had
[41:26] to correct him a little bit because this
[41:27] man what the man was doing he was he was
[41:30] kind of like saying oh it's all okay in
[41:32] other words he's saying we don't have to
[41:33] worried about the present everybody's
[41:35] gonna be ok let's just look to the
[41:37] future but brother man warned us not to
[41:39] look to the future too much help us to
[41:42] see what God is doing right now and
[41:44] that's why Jesus had to adjust his
[41:45] thinking
[41:46] he said don't think about oh it's not
[41:48] don't think like the kingdom of heaven
[41:49] is something far off
[41:50] he said the invitations out now and
[41:53] that's what we need to see as well
[41:55] that's a mystery of the kingdom of
[41:57] heaven because Jesus calls it he's the
[41:59] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven are
[42:00] given to you to them they're not given
[42:03] because they don't want to accept the
[42:05] invitation alright so we'll look at that
[42:07] Lord willing
[42:08] maybe next Wednesday now five of them
[42:10] deal with salvation treasure in a field
[42:12] the Pearl great price laborers in the
[42:14] vineyard unmerciful servant and the seed
[42:16] cast in the ground now last week I was
[42:20] it last week yeah we looked at the wheat
[42:21] and the tares and the net cast into the
[42:23] sea and then the Jew and Gentile there's
[42:27] one parable on that how the kingdom was
[42:29] sent to the Jew but they rejected it and
[42:31] going to the Gentile and then we looked
[42:34] at the talents and pounds last week I
[42:36] believe it was and then today we'll look
[42:40] at the four grounds which is familiar
[42:42] but I do want to go over it again and
[42:45] add a few more thoughts if we can do
[42:47] that by the grace of the Lord all right
[42:50] so I'm gonna be pulling some quotes from
[42:54] this sermon I preached you can see when
[42:56] I preached it almost well yeah over
[42:59] three years ago okay so over and we were
[43:01] I think in that other sanctuary I just
[43:03] want to pull a few quotes from that in
[43:04] just a moment but let's hear now we read
[43:09] our text now let's go to it back to
[43:10] Matthew 13 let's go to verse 18 if you
[43:13] got your Bibles there so Jesus
[43:15] interprets this parable for us and
[43:19] here's the revelation if I try to
[43:21] challenge myself to put each revelation
[43:23] of every kingdom into one sentence and
[43:26] so this is the revelation of the sower
[43:28] and the foregrounds this is what I
[43:31] believe from the scripture and the
[43:33] message there are four heart reactions
[43:36] to hearing preaching about Jesus Christ
[43:38] you can only react in one of four ways
[43:41] to the gospel of Jesus Christ and that's
[43:45] fitting because four is a earthly number
[43:47] how many know that four is a number that
[43:51] always applies to the earth like the
[43:53] four winds right I got a whole list of
[43:55] them I can't remember all of them but
[43:56] there's a bunch for always deals with
[43:59] the earth now in verse 18 thank the Lord
[44:05] that he interprets this for us
[44:08] so church we can't we can't hardly get
[44:10] this one - wrong - too much because he
[44:13] gave us so many symbols verse 18 here he
[44:16] therefore the parable the sower when any
[44:19] one heareth the word of the kingdom and
[44:21] understandeth it not then cometh the
[44:26] wicked one and catcheth away that which
[44:29] was sown in his heart this is he which
[44:32] received seed by the wayside but he that
[44:37] receiveth the seed and stony places the
[44:39] same is he that heareth the word and
[44:42] anon with joy receiveth it now this is
[44:46] one of the most deceptive ones because
[44:50] these people actually get excited about
[44:52] the word the first kind doesn't get
[44:55] excited it just goes off Satan snatches
[44:58] out their heart but this one they get
[45:00] excited about the word of the message
[45:02] but then in verse 21 yet hath he not
[45:05] root in himself but dureth for a while
[45:08] does he only believe for a while but
[45:13] when tribulation or persecution arises
[45:14] arises because of the word by and by
[45:18] he's offended now we've seen people go
[45:23] through this that have maybe they've
[45:25] lasted six months in them in their
[45:26] church some of last of the year year and
[45:29] a half two years some from other
[45:31] churches have last decades they believe
[45:34] for decades until some little thing rose
[45:37] up they got offended and they no longer
[45:40] believe the Word of God so this is quite
[45:44] a mystery that's why Jesus calls these
[45:46] mysteries he said to you it's given to
[45:49] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[45:51] heaven but to them it's not given verse
[45:54] 22 he also that received seed among the
[45:57] thorns is he that heareth the word and
[46:00] the care of
[46:01] this world and the deceitfulness of
[46:03] riches choke the word and he becometh
[46:06] unfruitful and verse 23 but he that
[46:11] received seed into the good ground is he
[46:13] that heareth the word and understandeth
[46:15] it which also beareth fruit and bringeth
[46:18] forth some a hundredfold some sixty and
[46:22] some thirty now that church should
[46:25] remind us a lot of the parable of the
[46:27] talents and the parable of the pounds
[46:30] see both of those parables talked about
[46:33] an increase right we looked at that
[46:35] scripture how they abounded and so see
[46:38] we see the same thing here the most
[46:40] genuine believer is gonna grow in grace
[46:44] and knowledge of the Lord not get stale
[46:47] and stagnant we don't want to get
[46:49] stagnant with the Lord we don't want to
[46:52] come to a standstill with the Lord but
[46:54] we find that with Israel they just went
[46:56] around the same circle in the wilderness
[46:59] for 40 years they got stagnant and
[47:01] that's what a lot of people do in the
[47:02] message right they just they never try
[47:05] to seek God they stop fasting and
[47:06] praying they never get closer to God
[47:08] what happens is they just give
[47:10] themselves up to the cares of the world
[47:12] they become worldly message believers
[47:15] and they become stagnant there's no more
[47:18] hunger for God they don't really care to
[47:19] grow any closer to the Lord they're
[47:21] happy with what they know they're not
[47:22] beating their body and bring it under
[47:24] subjection they start getting bad habits
[47:26] and habits are spirits bad habits are
[47:30] demon spirits that get in people's lives
[47:33] and so we've got to really make sure we
[47:36] don't become this third ground where the
[47:39] cares of the world creep up in our lives
[47:42] bad habits form and we don't see the
[47:45] real genuine fruit of the Holy Spirit
[47:49] now Jesus gives us the interpretation
[47:53] now there can only be four reactions
[47:56] after hearing preaching about Jesus
[47:57] Christ because there's four grounds
[48:01] now this seed represents God's Word
[48:03] that's found in Matthew 13:19
[48:07] the seed member of the seed last week
[48:09] represented you now the seed represents
[48:12] the word preached
[48:14] and the heart represents the heart of
[48:17] the ground represents the heart of the
[48:19] believer now this church should make us
[48:23] think about what Pontius Pilate asked
[48:27] when he stated what shall I do then with
[48:31] Jesus which is called Christ see you and
[48:34] I are gonna do something with Jesus
[48:37] that's called Christ see everybody's
[48:40] gonna hear about Christ
[48:41] everybody's gonna receive something
[48:43] about Christ and those that don't
[48:44] perhaps God will raise them up but in
[48:45] the Millennium brother branham says
[48:46] maybe they'll get a chance in the
[48:48] millennium to hear the word and be saved
[48:50] we don't really know for sure
[48:51] like let's but say aborted babies and
[48:54] something with that seed that ground has
[48:56] to be treated in one of four ways praise
[48:59] God and so what shall we do with Jesus
[49:04] see God is watching what you and I do
[49:06] with the word that we've heard remember
[49:09] the Bible says you'll either be two
[49:10] kinds of people come to church you'll
[49:12] either be a hearer or doer of the word
[49:15] how am I gonna be a doer of the word so
[49:17] you'll either leave Church doing what
[49:19] the preacher said what brother Nathaniel
[49:21] maybe one thing he was trying to say
[49:23] right if we could think about that if we
[49:25] could just add one thing from every
[49:26] sermon we heard that's like a hundred
[49:29] fifty things right because we about
[49:30] three services a week you would add a
[49:32] hundred fifty blessings or good habits
[49:36] to your life a year or maybe get back to
[49:38] a hundred fifty good things if you're
[49:41] repenting or renewing your strength -
[49:43] renewing your faith if you can just
[49:44] apply one thing from every sermon praise
[49:47] God
[49:48] then you know you'll be directed back to
[49:50] the Word of God and I encourage you to
[49:52] do that you know I see that in my life a
[49:54] lot where one thing I'll preach it'll
[49:57] come back in my life later that week so
[49:59] for example on Monday night I had a real
[50:02] evil attack from an evil spirit and I
[50:04] hardly slept at all Monday night I don't
[50:07] think I told my wife about it I had a
[50:09] real attack the enemy tried to come and
[50:11] attack me and so it was such a bad
[50:13] attack I just had to get up from the bed
[50:15] and go study the Word of God and pray
[50:17] because I thought if I don't do this I'm
[50:21] gonna get I'm gonna get an evil spirit
[50:22] on me it was such an awful attack right
[50:25] after great meetings you know we had
[50:27] some tremendous meetings
[50:28] and then the enemy comes on Monday night
[50:30] I can't can't even sleep and so see the
[50:34] very things I was preaching about and
[50:36] trying to get the people was those
[50:38] spirits came and tried to get on me but
[50:40] by the grace of God I only say that by
[50:42] God's glory by the grace of God he
[50:44] helped me overcome it met five hours of
[50:47] sleeps out five hours on Monday four
[50:50] hours last night so I'm really low on
[50:52] sleep this week but that's okay I
[50:54] realized Satan's trying to battle me but
[50:56] I've got to overcome this in church
[50:58] whether I'm tired or not whether you're
[51:00] tired or not no matter where do you got
[51:02] enough rest or not enough food or not
[51:03] you and I must be overcomers the Bible
[51:07] says in Hebrews 12 very few of us have
[51:09] ever resisted sin to bleeding right or
[51:12] to death which one of you have ever had
[51:14] to choose between well I obey the
[51:15] message or go to jail
[51:16] or I obey the message or get punched in
[51:18] the face you know none of us really have
[51:20] we haven't resisted sin unto like
[51:23] bleeding or death right but we have to
[51:26] resist sin to some degree so well I find
[51:29] many times I've got to resist sin Eve
[51:31] even if that means I don't get up sleep
[51:33] you might see like this I have to resist
[51:36] sin that I lose friendships people don't
[51:39] want to be around me so I've got to
[51:40] choose do I want to have more friends or
[51:43] less
[51:44] I'll take Christ give me Jesus praise
[51:47] God
[51:47] see we got to resist us something so
[51:50] there's gonna be some type of standard
[51:52] that we've got many times it's money you
[51:53] know we take a little extra money and
[51:55] break the word of God or we'll be a
[51:57] little poor but yet please the Lord see
[52:01] there's there's always a cost and we
[52:04] even teach on first grade there's what's
[52:05] called an opportunity cost whenever you
[52:07] have a choice I tell the first graders
[52:09] whatever you whatever you turn down
[52:11] that's that's the cost of it right and
[52:14] Jesus said if you wanted to be a
[52:16] disciple you got to count the cost
[52:19] you're gonna lose something you have to
[52:22] sacrifice something and Jesus says if
[52:24] you can't follow me daily and crucify
[52:26] the flesh daily he said you can't be my
[52:28] disciple you can't be a learner well if
[52:30] we're gonna be learners we got to
[52:32] crucify something every day and if we're
[52:35] not learning then we're what's called
[52:37] the Bible says forgetful here's where we
[52:40] forget even what was preached on Sunday
[52:42] we
[52:42] forget what was pre shell Wednesday
[52:43] night and that's what we're talking
[52:44] about you know these these certain kinds
[52:47] of grounds where people can come to
[52:49] church but if they are not doing what
[52:51] the the Word of God says and even the
[52:53] preachers if the preachers aren't living
[52:55] what they're preaching then it just
[52:57] becomes a backslidden condition praise
[53:01] God and and God is watching what we do
[53:03] with the word amen
[53:05] now I want to I want to move over to
[53:11] that slide I was trying to pull it up
[53:14] here and I'll just put it up there so
[53:19] everybody can see I'll just start with
[53:20] that
[53:21] now we're gonna get down to this there's
[53:23] four kinds of grounds we'll get to that
[53:25] a little bit but how many remember this
[53:26] when I put this up here of three years
[53:27] ago everyone remember okay some people
[53:29] do so everybody falls into one or two
[53:32] categories there's two destinies saved
[53:34] or lost and then the saved are called
[53:36] believers the loss the loss can have a
[53:39] make believer like lot or Lot's wife
[53:41] rather we'll get to that or like Judas
[53:43] we'll get to that a little bit or
[53:44] unbeliever there's two kinds of lawsuit
[53:46] so when we say there's three kinds of
[53:48] believers that's what we're talking
[53:49] about but then the Prophet gives us
[53:51] another revelation he said there's
[53:53] another class of believer called a
[53:55] foolish virgin there's a wise version a
[53:58] foolish version they're both saved but
[54:00] then we still have to make believer
[54:01] believer and you see it all throughout
[54:03] the Bible Abraham was wise but lot he
[54:05] was kind of foolish he was barely saved
[54:07] and then you have Lot's wife she was
[54:10] lost because she almost made it but she
[54:12] turned around and cried for the world
[54:14] see she was sad about losing things from
[54:17] the world we ought to be happy about
[54:18] losing things from the world right we
[54:21] ought not to look back and oh my like
[54:23] Jesus said any man who puts his hands to
[54:26] the plow and looks back he's not worthy
[54:28] of the gospel right and then the
[54:30] sodomites of course they were obviously
[54:32] firmly lost all right now let's look at
[54:39] this first kind of ground actually you
[54:41] know let me keep going here you'll see
[54:45] this in revelation 22 the Bible said at
[54:48] the time of Jesus's rapture he that's
[54:51] holy let him be holy still well let's
[54:53] read now let's get our Bibles here why
[54:55] don't we just read that
[54:56] I can see that revelation 22 11 so it's
[55:07] just so beautiful you know like I said
[55:09] we see these four types all the way
[55:12] through the scripture revelation 22 11
[55:14] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[55:16] still he which is filthy be filthy still
[55:20] and he that is righteous let him be
[55:23] righteous still and he that's holy let
[55:25] him be holy still
[55:27] praise God now remember so there's three
[55:31] kinds of believers in four classes so
[55:36] you have to save than the loss I'm just
[55:37] going through these kind of quick either
[55:39] saved and given a white robe of eternal
[55:41] life or you have to burn for some type
[55:43] of a amount of time but eventually you
[55:45] won't burn for eternally right no no
[55:48] loving God will let someone burn
[55:49] eternally just for like 15 or even a
[55:52] hundred years of sin God would never be
[55:54] so evil horror so hard-hearted to make
[55:57] somebody burn eternally without end just
[56:00] for a few years of unbelief or a few
[56:02] years of sin at some point they'll stop
[56:05] stop existing they'll be annihilated and
[56:09] that's Scripture there's lots of
[56:11] scripture on that so here's the four
[56:12] classes you have the save you have the
[56:14] elect the wise virgin you have the
[56:16] foolish virgin the Gentiles and Jews
[56:18] that were the souls under the altar oh
[56:19] yeah these had these were the Jew or
[56:21] Gentile with Holy Ghost oil you have the
[56:24] loss you have the make believer that's
[56:25] Judas he was filthy because Jesus said
[56:29] remember he said all of your clean
[56:30] except one of you remember that and then
[56:33] like Pharaoh he was unjust he never
[56:35] believed in the first place so you can
[56:38] see all these all the way through the
[56:39] Bible and I already showed you Abraham
[56:41] and there's a few examples there as well
[56:43] so two destinies I'm gonna skip past
[56:46] that we're pretty familiar with that you
[56:47] know the Bible call it's the saved or
[56:49] vessels of mercy they're called wheat
[56:50] they're called sheep they're called
[56:52] children of God they're called good seed
[56:53] The Lofts are called vessels of Wrath
[56:55] tears goats children of Satan and bad
[56:57] seed praise God and then there's three
[57:00] kinds of believers now we saw that
[57:03] believer make believer unbeliever now
[57:07] I'm gonna skip past that program oh
[57:10] we're familiar with that now here's
[57:14] where brother Ram said there's another
[57:15] class of believer so I want to read that
[57:17] to you I'm gonna skip this for times
[57:21] sake okay she but indeed she shall be
[57:24] with him and his throne this speaking of
[57:25] the bride now the bride the wise virgin
[57:27] the holy person but not more than
[57:31] righteous but holy she shall be with him
[57:34] Christ in his throne of judgment judging
[57:36] the world and even angels her name each
[57:39] of her members was written in the
[57:41] section of the Lamb's Book of Life
[57:42] before the foundation world secondly
[57:44] there's another class so see how brother
[57:47] Branham categorizes it he calls it
[57:49] another class huh me know that brother
[57:51] Branham worked about four years on the
[57:53] church age book does anyone know that
[57:54] for years and there's tapes where
[57:57] brother Branham would he would make
[57:59] audio notes with lavell on how to
[58:01] correct the church age book and brother
[58:04] Branham said he was warned of God to
[58:07] preach the seven Church ages when he saw
[58:08] JFK become president a Catholic
[58:11] president the first Catholic president
[58:13] he was warned of God to show the people
[58:16] what our were living in so that God's
[58:18] people might be ready for the rapture
[58:20] amen
[58:21] and so he worked on this for five or
[58:23] four years from the end of 1960 and then
[58:26] all the way to 1965 so he says secondly
[58:29] there's another class he said their
[58:31] names are also in the book of life and
[58:33] they will come up in the second
[58:34] resurrection such are the foolish
[58:36] virgins and the righteous as are spoken
[58:39] of in Matthew 25 in this class also are
[58:43] those who do not worship the Beast or
[58:44] become involved in the Antichrist system
[58:47] but die for their faith even though they
[58:50] are not in the bride not having been
[58:52] born again but they will come up in the
[58:54] second resurrection and go into eternal
[58:56] life praise God help me understand that
[58:58] is that is that clear okay I hope it is
[59:01] by the grace of Lord so another class we
[59:03] have to remember that brother Adam used
[59:04] those words another class now some
[59:08] people don't like the church age book
[59:09] but you'll never find a quote about that
[59:11] some people have stories which they may
[59:13] be true I don't know
[59:14] but some of you have stories and they
[59:16] say you know
[59:17] brother Ram was eventually against the
[59:18] church age book I never find that in any
[59:20] of the quotes I always seem promoting it
[59:22] he's happy about it he calls it his
[59:24] commentary he says if you've got any
[59:26] light at all on you you'll see truth in
[59:29] the church age book so I don't see any
[59:31] reason to doubt that this book was rebel
[59:35] Aidid truth to us from God all right I'm
[59:38] gonna skip past that Judas is the third
[59:41] type and then Balaam Oh baylin's a third
[59:45] type as well and finally those ones were
[59:47] never on the books of life okay so now
[59:50] we can see now we can see the wise
[59:52] virgin is called the bride the foolish
[59:54] version Judas and Balaam are like the
[59:57] make believers and then there's
[59:59] unbelievers who never believed in the
[1:00:01] first place now there was four crosses
[1:00:03] when Jesus died I'm not gonna take time
[1:00:06] to read the quotes but Judas was
[1:00:08] actually on a tree because the Bible
[1:00:10] said cursed it is he who hangs on a tree
[1:00:12] Jesus took the curse of all of us thank
[1:00:15] God and the Bible said he died on a tree
[1:00:17] because that where the cross was made
[1:00:19] out of a wood from a tree so Jesus was
[1:00:22] the the wise version the foolish version
[1:00:24] was the safe thief on the cross Judas
[1:00:26] was the lost I'm sorry to make believer
[1:00:29] and then the lost thief was the
[1:00:31] unbeliever now for the earthly number
[1:00:34] brother Graham said and for classes a
[1:00:37] clear Bible doctrine okay so I'm just
[1:00:41] ranking those down so you can see it and
[1:00:43] then here I'll just stop right here so
[1:00:46] here we see the four types of grounds
[1:00:48] there's a good ground thorny ground
[1:00:49] stony ground and wayside ground first
[1:00:52] Peter 4 says there's elect believers
[1:00:54] righteous believers ungodly believers
[1:00:56] and sinners and Enochs day Enoch was
[1:00:59] raptured Noah had to go through the
[1:01:01] tribulation borderline believers were
[1:01:03] those who maybe hung around Noah but
[1:01:05] then rejected him and then we have
[1:01:06] mockers those that mocked Noah the Bible
[1:01:10] said just like in the days of Noah
[1:01:11] there'll be mockers in the end time I'm
[1:01:13] glad I'm not mocking the things of God
[1:01:15] I'm blessing the things of God hey men
[1:01:17] praise God
[1:01:19] so now let's look at this here these
[1:01:21] let's look at these four kinds of
[1:01:22] grounds we're gonna start right here
[1:01:23] with the wayside now the wayside is
[1:01:26] someone that hears the word but does not
[1:01:28] understand it the birds
[1:01:30] present Satan the wicked one and they
[1:01:34] snatch away God's Word from the person's
[1:01:36] heart birds usually represent Satan as
[1:01:40] you'll see in other parables all right
[1:01:44] the heart that ultimately rejects God's
[1:01:46] Word is lost and not saved Jesus says
[1:01:50] most people fall into this category
[1:01:52] wayside because Jesus said few there be
[1:01:55] that find it all right
[1:01:57] and that's Matthew 7:14 few people will
[1:02:01] find this narrow road up here this Enoch
[1:02:04] Road amen this dedicated Road amen
[1:02:07] hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:02:10] now the second ground is another sad
[1:02:15] heart condition called the stony places
[1:02:17] this person rejoices over the word for a
[1:02:20] season and he can believe for a while
[1:02:23] the Bible says but then he rejects the
[1:02:26] truth due to tribulation or persecution
[1:02:29] you got your Bibles let's read that
[1:02:31] let's go to Luke 813 so you can see that
[1:02:34] Luke 813 if you got your Bible
[1:02:44] I want you to see that see the Bible
[1:02:47] says you can believe for a while and
[1:02:50] people that say once saved always say we
[1:02:52] talked about that the only way that's
[1:02:54] true is if you're for ordained and
[1:02:57] predestinated the salvation by God's
[1:02:58] foreknowledge but doesn't mean that
[1:03:01] every person that receives or believes a
[1:03:02] seed is gonna be saved that's clearly
[1:03:04] not right in the parable whoever was
[1:03:07] foreknown whoever God foreknew they
[1:03:09] would believe yes they can never be lost
[1:03:12] but those who who God knew would fall
[1:03:15] away like the Judas like the Balaam like
[1:03:18] mrs. lot of course they they won't be
[1:03:21] saved if they reject salvation now Luke
[1:03:24] eight thirteen they on the rock are they
[1:03:28] which when they hear receive the word
[1:03:30] with joy and these have no root which
[1:03:35] for a while believe and in time of
[1:03:36] temptation fall away now recently even
[1:03:40] this weekend we were fellowship in and
[1:03:42] and we were we were trying that we were
[1:03:44] we were discussing people that that
[1:03:47] we've known the message that came to the
[1:03:50] message but they never ever shown any
[1:03:52] joy at any time of their their time in
[1:03:54] the message and that's true there's
[1:03:57] there's been some people we've known
[1:03:59] I've known and other ones have known we
[1:04:01] were talking over there
[1:04:02] and it was so sad they came to church
[1:04:04] this their whole lives and never ever
[1:04:07] showed any joy about the word some
[1:04:09] people have been amongst us and church
[1:04:11] they never said Amen one time some
[1:04:14] people have sat in our services and
[1:04:16] never come up for prayer one time can
[1:04:19] you imagine that means they think so
[1:04:21] little of yours your prayers and my
[1:04:24] prayers they never asked for our prayers
[1:04:26] when the Bible said we should always
[1:04:28] pray for one another praise God we've
[1:04:33] sat amongst people that never came up
[1:04:34] for prayer never said one Amen
[1:04:37] never showed any joy about the things of
[1:04:40] God never Shout in the spirit never
[1:04:42] songs never cried never wet down at the
[1:04:45] altar oh my thank God for believers who
[1:04:48] yield all their emotions to God but see
[1:04:51] there's some of us that have come around
[1:04:53] us that have never even expressed joy
[1:04:58] about the things of God but see at least
[1:05:01] see at least these people these stony
[1:05:04] people at least they show some emotion
[1:05:08] see our emotions are good as long as
[1:05:11] they line up with the Word of God God
[1:05:14] wants your emotions to be used but only
[1:05:17] as they line up with God's Word
[1:05:20] emotions don't prove God it's God's will
[1:05:23] what proves God's will is the revelation
[1:05:26] of God's Word that proves God's will
[1:05:28] when something comes to pass but just
[1:05:31] emotion itself doesn't mean it's from
[1:05:34] God because we've all seen emotional
[1:05:36] people that get off the word right they
[1:05:39] make emotional decisions thinking it was
[1:05:41] God but it's really not God so it's got
[1:05:44] to be emotion well the RAM said don't
[1:05:46] look for a motion but a motion comes
[1:05:48] with it
[1:05:49] that's quite a balance I know it I know
[1:05:52] it may be a little deeper but but what
[1:05:55] you want what I mean is that a heart
[1:05:57] that loves God no matter how emotional
[1:05:59] before they make the decision they'll go
[1:06:01] back to the word and make sure that
[1:06:03] decision lines up with God's Word praise
[1:06:06] the Lord
[1:06:08] that's right they on the rock are they
[1:06:12] which when they hear receive the word
[1:06:15] with joy and these have no root which
[1:06:18] for a while believe and in time of
[1:06:22] temptation fall away so this is the kind
[1:06:26] of person like Judas they love they love
[1:06:29] God but they end up not loving God as
[1:06:32] much as they love money or as much as
[1:06:35] they love the world or as much as they
[1:06:37] love popularity or fame or a
[1:06:40] relationship or another man or woman
[1:06:42] they actually love that man or woman or
[1:06:44] that lust or drug addiction or whatever
[1:06:46] they actually love that more than they
[1:06:48] love God may God help us to put God
[1:06:51] first in our lives may we love God with
[1:06:53] all of our hearts Souls mind and
[1:06:56] strength because these love God for a
[1:07:00] while but then they end up loving the
[1:07:03] things of the world more than they love
[1:07:05] God see they fall away
[1:07:11] that's why I knew you know when I was
[1:07:13] battling Monday night you know that's
[1:07:14] why I knew this is a temptation also I
[1:07:16] going to do it took me a while you know
[1:07:19] I thought about it for about an hour
[1:07:21] like wait this is a battle this is a
[1:07:24] demon power I've got to get up and do
[1:07:26] something about that see I didn't want
[1:07:27] to get up because I don't want to lose
[1:07:29] sleep but I wasn't gonna get sleep
[1:07:30] anyway with those demon powers battling
[1:07:32] me hey man I had to get up and pray
[1:07:35] reading my Bible and go study a little
[1:07:36] bit and I got the victory praise the
[1:07:38] Lord my heart I mean when I laid back
[1:07:40] down my heart was so clear and pure
[1:07:42] before God I know it sure is because I
[1:07:44] went through anything I know what I'm
[1:07:46] talking about because I experienced it
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:49] see I'm not I'm not one that likes to
[1:07:52] miss sleep I hate missing sleep because
[1:07:53] then I start you know I don't know not
[1:07:55] as sharp as I need to be but I just
[1:07:57] realized that God was allowing me to go
[1:07:59] through a trial to make sure I lived
[1:08:01] what I preached because I preached
[1:08:04] really hard we had a couple preachers
[1:08:05] come up and say my brother Jesse he sure
[1:08:07] is a hard preacher but it's the truth
[1:08:09] he's they said see so the devil was
[1:08:13] testing me now of course God allowed it
[1:08:15] right and what good is a sermon if it's
[1:08:18] not lived anyway right so God allowed it
[1:08:22] so I could be an overcomer
[1:08:24] so I thank the Lord I thank the Lord for
[1:08:26] His grace and mercy so hope everybody
[1:08:32] can see that the the stony ground
[1:08:35] believes for a while but they don't have
[1:08:38] the deepness of God's Word in their
[1:08:40] hearts and I read this to you a few
[1:08:42] weeks ago I don't know if you remember
[1:08:43] it maybe it was months nine weeks and
[1:08:45] months get all intertwined I know I say
[1:08:47] that all the time but brother have said
[1:08:49] the reason people turned down the word
[1:08:50] is because they don't pray enough he
[1:08:53] said they don't dig down deep enough in
[1:08:55] revelation amen
[1:08:57] he said you got to dig down deeper and
[1:08:59] prayer to get in the spirit of
[1:09:01] Revelation hey glory and here's what it
[1:09:04] says that's what the scripture says here
[1:09:08] for a while they believe but they don't
[1:09:10] have the deepness of a Christian heart
[1:09:12] in other words they don't have a deep
[1:09:14] sincerity for Jesus Christ they're not
[1:09:18] sincere enough they've got to go a
[1:09:20] little deeper right dig a little deep or
[1:09:22] get more sincere
[1:09:24] dig out like what man so you got to dig
[1:09:25] out like Isaac had to dig out well after
[1:09:29] well and that third well was the one
[1:09:31] that did it praise God
[1:09:32] the third labor of love digging out all
[1:09:35] the world and finally struck a well a
[1:09:37] water well amen she had to dig it all
[1:09:40] move out all the trash praise God move
[1:09:43] it all out and then dig down deep enough
[1:09:46] to get in the spirit of Revelation Oh
[1:09:48] hallelujah praise God see the rejection
[1:09:56] occurs because there's no root in
[1:09:58] himself
[1:09:59] meaning no deep genuine love for Christ
[1:10:02] because Paul says Christians are rooted
[1:10:04] and grounded in what never said look see
[1:10:08] that's why it's stony that's why it's
[1:10:10] Tony they're not rooted in the love of
[1:10:12] God because Paul says we're grounded in
[1:10:15] love so see their roots are in stony
[1:10:17] things right but not in the real fertile
[1:10:21] soil of the love of God amen
[1:10:25] hallelujah thank you lord that's
[1:10:28] beautiful beautiful Scripture Jesus says
[1:10:32] this type of stony hard experience
[1:10:34] starts off excitedly lasting longer than
[1:10:38] the wayside but then slowly withers away
[1:10:41] but the Bible says in psalms 1:3 that
[1:10:45] the godly have leaves that shall not
[1:10:47] wither glory real Christian love is not
[1:10:52] wither away Jude describes apostates as
[1:10:55] clouds without water and trees whose
[1:10:58] fruit withereth if you went to my house
[1:11:00] right now I could show you our apple
[1:11:01] tree boy it would look pretty good a few
[1:11:02] weeks ago but now all the apples are
[1:11:04] withering away I looked at some of them
[1:11:08] this week when I was mowing I thought
[1:11:09] man I'm gonna go up and eat one of those
[1:11:10] though it looks juicy it was a from a
[1:11:13] far away off but as I got closer I
[1:11:16] started looking at I think there's some
[1:11:18] wormholes on there and the one I grabbed
[1:11:21] I turn around its rot it looks good on
[1:11:22] one side rotting on the other that's
[1:11:24] about a lot of church members lives they
[1:11:27] look good at church but turn around and
[1:11:29] go to home they're rotting praise God
[1:11:33] and they're withering away instead
[1:11:36] stronger more excited more thankful for
[1:11:39] God they're more bitter they're more
[1:11:42] they're more upset they're more
[1:11:45] depressed right they're more distressed
[1:11:48] instead of being more confident in the
[1:11:51] things of God they're less confident you
[1:11:54] would be surprised how many I'm sure it
[1:11:55] went Sunday but you'd be how many some
[1:11:57] surprised how many people need a prayer
[1:11:59] just for doubt they just doubting God
[1:12:02] doubting if they're believer doubting if
[1:12:04] they're born again just doubt battling
[1:12:08] doubt but see we should we should be
[1:12:11] able to grow beyond that now we all go
[1:12:12] through trials remember God said he'll
[1:12:14] never give us a battle that we can't
[1:12:16] handle see growth not decreasing not rot
[1:12:23] and withering away I'm getting weaker
[1:12:25] and weaker and weaker we've got to grow
[1:12:27] stronger who the Bible said when you're
[1:12:30] planted by waters your fruit will not
[1:12:32] wither amen and that's the waters of the
[1:12:35] Holy Spirit hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:12:38] amen say boys
[1:12:39] we should always be drinking on the
[1:12:41] waters of life drinking from the
[1:12:43] fountain right from the rivers of the
[1:12:46] waters of life glory see it's clear the
[1:12:52] stony places heart is apostate which
[1:12:56] means they reject the word and they're
[1:12:58] lost because they're withering away and
[1:13:01] dying just as the wayside heart
[1:13:11] now the third ground now this is the one
[1:13:13] we really got a watch church if you're
[1:13:16] sincere if you up Dave if you are your
[1:13:20] name is written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:13:22] Life or the book of life section then
[1:13:24] this is the one we really got to watch
[1:13:26] for how many can say amen to that
[1:13:27] well Graham said there's three things
[1:13:29] you got to watch for and later to see
[1:13:31] them down so I wouldn't forget I always
[1:13:33] forget one of them there's three of them
[1:13:34] I don't know why I can't remember the
[1:13:35] third one but they're soft living riches
[1:13:39] and nervous tensions so Graham said our
[1:13:42] age has three things to worry about soft
[1:13:44] living we're life so easy don't work too
[1:13:47] hard
[1:13:47] don't labor too hard for Jesus
[1:13:50] I don't have to fast you know you don't
[1:13:52] have to I'm not of course we don't talk
[1:13:54] we don't say that the nursing mothers
[1:13:55] nursing mothers need to eat because
[1:13:57] they're feeding another baby
[1:13:59] now unless God supernaturally somehow
[1:14:00] feeds you and the baby but see soft
[1:14:04] living where Christianity is not you
[1:14:07] know it doesn't it doesn't cost anything
[1:14:10] there's no sacrifices see you just come
[1:14:13] to church let the preacher sacrificer
[1:14:15] let the musicians or let brother
[1:14:16] so-and-so or sister so and so let them
[1:14:19] sacrifice but me I don't want to
[1:14:20] sacrifice anything I just want to have a
[1:14:22] nice simple humble or eat I'll say not
[1:14:25] humble a nice easy week see what Jesus
[1:14:29] said and brother branham said
[1:14:30] Christianity is all self-sacrifice amen
[1:14:34] that's all Christianity is a sacrificing
[1:14:36] amen because the Bible said not only do
[1:14:40] you sacrifice one time what the Bible
[1:14:42] say you are a living sacrifice so you're
[1:14:46] constantly applying yourself to
[1:14:50] sacrifice yourself I could do this I
[1:14:53] could live a little softer but I'm gonna
[1:14:56] choose the harder way because I love
[1:14:57] Jesus because I know I've got to live
[1:15:00] for others
[1:15:01] I can't live for myself cuz that's not
[1:15:03] gonna it's not gonna do any good for the
[1:15:05] kingdom of God I've got to live for
[1:15:07] others and then riches right putting all
[1:15:11] your money saving all your money for
[1:15:12] yourself now you should save if you need
[1:15:14] a retirement yes you should save but
[1:15:17] like just like John Wesley said save as
[1:15:18] much as you can and give as much as you
[1:15:20] can just do do more you know just do a
[1:15:24] little more right but don't Shrive for
[1:15:28] worldly riches don't make that your goal
[1:15:30] because riches are fleeting they're here
[1:15:34] today gone tomorrow and no man or woman
[1:15:37] on her deathbed ever said I wish I had
[1:15:40] more money nobody ever said that they
[1:15:44] said I wish I had more time I wish I had
[1:15:47] more love right like I've talked to who
[1:15:52] was recently but someone would say
[1:15:55] and we were talking that they wish that
[1:15:58] they could have an order person was
[1:16:00] getting ready to die I forget who it was
[1:16:01] man what was it and they were saying
[1:16:04] they wish they they could love their
[1:16:06] their family more that's the one thing
[1:16:09] they wanted was to love their family
[1:16:11] more that's what they regret it and
[1:16:13] their life may God help us and not have
[1:16:15] regrets like that redeem the time by the
[1:16:20] time back use the time for God's will
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:24] love your family love those closest to
[1:16:27] you redeem the time but see the us
[1:16:30] that's the two soft living and riches
[1:16:35] then the third one nervous tensions did
[1:16:38] you know brother Ram said I think I put
[1:16:39] this up here a few weeks ago how many
[1:16:41] remember abode Ram said nervousness is
[1:16:42] the worst feeling you can ever have like
[1:16:45] nervous tension and that's one of the
[1:16:49] demon powers we fight most in Laodicea
[1:16:52] a nervous person and brother bran also
[1:16:56] calls it it's someone who crosses
[1:16:57] bridges before they get there
[1:16:59] they worry so much about that
[1:17:00] appointment next week mother got all
[1:17:02] figured out I'll do this or maybe the
[1:17:04] next the next deal they're gonna do they
[1:17:06] they cross they they get everything in
[1:17:08] their mind all lined up before they even
[1:17:10] get there and brother Branham had to
[1:17:15] teach people to get rid of that and he
[1:17:17] had to teach them instead of worrying
[1:17:19] and plant now it's okay to plan but when
[1:17:21] you go overboard it becomes a sin
[1:17:22] because it's a nervousness it's a
[1:17:24] nervous spirit so boat ran would tell
[1:17:26] those people instead of nervousness
[1:17:28] seeing at home how many of you sang in
[1:17:32] your kitchen while you're cooking or
[1:17:33] Eden this week I was singing last night
[1:17:37] because I was thinking about that like
[1:17:38] Lord I got to create a better atmosphere
[1:17:42] sing he would tell those nervous people
[1:17:44] sing all day I think he said in one
[1:17:46] place sing all day but those are the
[1:17:50] three things we got to watch out for
[1:17:52] that they're gonna try to choke out your
[1:17:54] life and suffocate the life of God or
[1:17:56] God's life breathing in you because it
[1:17:59] chokes the word it doesn't let the word
[1:18:02] have life cares I'm sorry nervous
[1:18:07] tensions
[1:18:08] riches and soft living now this is
[1:18:17] called thorny because it receives seed
[1:18:19] with and thorns spring up and choke it
[1:18:21] making the plant unfruitful so see it
[1:18:24] had little addictions and habits that
[1:18:26] we're living in their lives and there's
[1:18:28] a load of people that were pending of
[1:18:29] those two habits things that are growing
[1:18:32] up something has life in my heart that
[1:18:34] shouldn't have life in my heart there's
[1:18:38] something living in my heart that I'm
[1:18:40] feeding and I shouldn't be feeding it
[1:18:42] right I've developed a bad habit and I
[1:18:45] shouldn't have this habit this habit
[1:18:47] should die but then they let it grow up
[1:18:51] and it's okay brother so-and-so sister
[1:18:53] so-and-so does it I don't matter it
[1:18:55] matters what the word says varies God
[1:18:58] when we never judge ourselves by other
[1:19:01] churches we never judge ourselves by
[1:19:03] anyone else other than Jesus Christ can
[1:19:06] we take wisdom from brother Branham yes
[1:19:08] can we take wisdom from that brother yes
[1:19:09] but we've ultimately got to align
[1:19:11] ourselves up and look in the mirror of
[1:19:14] the word not look in the mirror of
[1:19:16] pastor so-and-so er sister so-and-so or
[1:19:19] brother Zones oh no we don't look at
[1:19:21] anyone else we don't commend ourselves
[1:19:23] for to ourselves like Paul says we have
[1:19:26] to look to Christ for our example
[1:19:29] hallelujah so this third heart here's
[1:19:37] the word and get some little growth goes
[1:19:40] for a while
[1:19:41] that seed grows up but then it chooses
[1:19:44] the care for the world riches and
[1:19:46] pleasures more than Christ although this
[1:19:50] heart lasted much longer than the
[1:19:52] previous two it still missed the
[1:19:54] ultimate goal of Christianity which is
[1:19:56] fruitfulness fruitfulness is the goal of
[1:20:00] Christianity the goal of any wheat plant
[1:20:03] is to what produce ripe kernels so you
[1:20:07] can you can break them off I forget the
[1:20:10] name of that winnowing process and then
[1:20:12] grind them up and make what wheat flour
[1:20:16] that's the whole point of it is
[1:20:18] fruitfulness what good is the apple tree
[1:20:22] if it doesn't
[1:20:23] fourth fruit Jesus wants us to bring
[1:20:26] forth fruits to serve our God ordained
[1:20:30] purpose think of how rare how many
[1:20:33] people do you know that bring forth the
[1:20:34] fruit of love that they love Christ more
[1:20:37] than everything else I mean everything a
[1:20:39] fruit of love how many people you don't
[1:20:43] have the fruit of joy they have that
[1:20:45] genuine joy of the Lord
[1:20:47] peace who has the peace of God in their
[1:20:52] heart because it's rare because this is
[1:20:54] the rarest kind of heart this good
[1:20:57] ground it's the rarest kind of ground
[1:20:58] it's very hard to find amongst even
[1:21:00] churchgoers who has long suffering that
[1:21:04] even if you say something wrong and you
[1:21:08] hurt them they still love you back with
[1:21:10] long-suffering who has that who has
[1:21:14] gentleness that when you you that you're
[1:21:16] mean to them they're gentle back to you
[1:21:19] they don't bite your head off
[1:21:22] faith who's really expressing faith or
[1:21:26] revelation the will of God with real
[1:21:28] maturity
[1:21:29] how about meekness so meek that they
[1:21:32] never they never exalt themselves they
[1:21:34] always humble themselves and how about
[1:21:36] temperance or self-control that's what I
[1:21:38] was preaching I'm pretty hard over there
[1:21:40] or it's about people that they have no
[1:21:42] control over you know eating sugar late
[1:21:44] too many sweets too many donuts they
[1:21:47] drink too much night coke they can't
[1:21:51] live without it and it causes diabetes
[1:21:53] and cancer I just saw another article
[1:21:54] this week that said soda causes cancer
[1:21:57] like how many warnings do people need
[1:21:59] see they have no temperance then they
[1:22:02] can't control that if they can't control
[1:22:04] the natural things how can they control
[1:22:06] the spiritual things like their tongue
[1:22:07] they can't they can't do it and that's a
[1:22:17] fruit of the Holy Spirit when you're
[1:22:18] planted by Jesus Christ I'm sorry yeah
[1:22:20] by His Spirit you're planted by the
[1:22:22] Spirit of water then you'll produce
[1:22:23] temperance you're able to control your
[1:22:27] appetite you're able to control your
[1:22:29] words you're able to control your your
[1:22:30] passions your sensual bodily passions
[1:22:33] that we all have you're able to control
[1:22:36] that because
[1:22:37] so mature you're so strong because
[1:22:39] you're planted by the rivers of the
[1:22:41] Spirit thank the Lord
[1:22:44] uh-huh thank you Jesus Jesus said he
[1:22:47] chose the disciples to go forth and
[1:22:49] bring forth fruit that your fruit should
[1:22:51] remain Paul warns all Christians that
[1:22:56] riches can cause believers to follow the
[1:22:58] temptation snares and to many foolish
[1:23:01] and hurtful lusts which drown men in
[1:23:03] destruction and perdition Paul's advice
[1:23:08] to Timothy a man of God is to flee these
[1:23:10] things and follow after righteousness
[1:23:12] godliness faith love patience and
[1:23:15] meekness we shall literally run from the
[1:23:18] prosperity gospel we should literally
[1:23:21] run from nervousness we should run from
[1:23:24] the riches we should run from soft
[1:23:27] living he said flee these things run
[1:23:30] from them and follow after a dedicated
[1:23:32] life Paul prophesied in 2nd Timothy that
[1:23:40] men in the last days are lovers of
[1:23:42] pleasures more than lovers of God that's
[1:23:47] what the Bible says but of course these
[1:23:49] people can be saved as we saw earlier
[1:23:52] with the quote that we saw from brother
[1:23:54] Branham so examples are lot and the
[1:23:58] thief on the cross I have them up there
[1:24:00] no I don't have them let me see if I got
[1:24:02] it on the next one I thought I did it
[1:24:09] there bear with me I thought I oh sorry
[1:24:17] about that
[1:24:22] I want to just put those names up there
[1:24:27] so everybody could see him I just want
[1:24:29] to it the highlights of this so we're
[1:24:32] all focused on the the kingdom of God
[1:24:36] sorry I should have looked this up
[1:24:38] earlier I was looking for the actual
[1:24:42] names on there okay there yeah that's so
[1:24:45] kind of one oh yeah so there you have
[1:24:47] Judas then you have mrs. Lotte the safe
[1:24:50] thief yeah there it is saved still a
[1:24:53] believer but he lived a life as a
[1:24:55] murderer right
[1:24:56] he murdered that's why he was like the
[1:24:58] other Barabbas Barabbas was released but
[1:25:01] the one that was on the other side that
[1:25:02] died they were both thieves and they
[1:25:04] were both murderers so they died right
[1:25:07] by Jesus they were died justly Jesus
[1:25:09] died unjustly and so we see they can
[1:25:12] still be saved like lot and the
[1:25:15] repentant thief all right now and then
[1:25:19] Paul says a man can be saved but suffer
[1:25:22] the all loss of reward so let's read
[1:25:26] that real quick since we got our Bibles
[1:25:27] 1st Corinthians 3:13 let's go there in
[1:25:29] the scripture see love is the greatest
[1:25:33] motivator if you love God he said you'll
[1:25:35] keep my commands so these these people
[1:25:38] that are saved they love God but they
[1:25:40] don't love God as much as the others
[1:25:42] because they love they love some habits
[1:25:45] they love some worldliness rather than
[1:25:48] loving the word like they ought to
[1:25:50] praise God all right so I said 1st
[1:25:53] Corinthians 3:13
[1:26:06] every man's work shall be made manifest
[1:26:08] for the day shall declare it because it
[1:26:10] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[1:26:12] shall try every man's work of what sort
[1:26:14] it is now that includes me that includes
[1:26:18] every preacher that includes each one of
[1:26:20] us the fire we'd say the fire of trials
[1:26:24] will test every one's ministry to show
[1:26:27] what they're made of because the Bible
[1:26:29] said the fiery trials of our faith the
[1:26:33] trials we go through will prove if we've
[1:26:35] really got what we say we got verse 14
[1:26:39] if any man's work abide which he hath
[1:26:41] built thereupon he shall receive a
[1:26:44] reward see his work has to withstand the
[1:26:47] fire verse 15 if any man's work shall be
[1:26:51] burned he shall suffer loss but he
[1:26:53] himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
[1:26:56] and the best example of that is right
[1:26:59] here all of lot's all of Lots
[1:27:02] possessions were burned in Sodom Haven
[1:27:05] praise God what was any of Abraham's
[1:27:08] reward burnt no sir hey hey man why cuz
[1:27:11] he was looking for the promised son and
[1:27:13] you and I need to look for the promised
[1:27:15] son Jesus Christ lot forgot about the
[1:27:18] promise son so everything he was living
[1:27:21] for was burned by fire and brimstone he
[1:27:25] got two daughters out and produced a
[1:27:27] moab backslidden nation right I never
[1:27:30] really believed to begin with so all of
[1:27:34] his investments in his entire life was
[1:27:37] burned by fire I don't want that kind of
[1:27:39] testimony so see we we have to remember
[1:27:43] lot looked at Sodom and he saw the money
[1:27:45] so he went towards money rather than you
[1:27:48] know staying see could have stayed
[1:27:49] somewhere else I remember him and
[1:27:51] Abraham couldn't stay together there was
[1:27:52] enough room for their cattle but he
[1:27:55] could have chose somewhere else but
[1:27:57] instead of choosing somewhere else he
[1:27:58] chose for money and he chose to hang
[1:28:01] around the homosexual community right
[1:28:03] that's right but see Abraham said I know
[1:28:07] better than that
[1:28:08] and so Abraham's ministry was this
[1:28:11] Abraham's ministry was this Church he
[1:28:13] was praying God if
[1:28:15] 50 say 50 if there's 45 if there's 30 if
[1:28:19] there's 25 if there's 10 that was
[1:28:21] Abraham history abraham's ministry was
[1:28:23] prayer ministry amen he had the prayer
[1:28:27] ministry and he was trained in his
[1:28:29] family he was trained his servants with
[1:28:31] the commandments of God but lot was over
[1:28:34] there sitting at the gate as the mayor
[1:28:36] as a leader and he's trying to judge
[1:28:38] between these sinners what you say it
[1:28:40] would this homosexual person what
[1:28:42] violent crime did they do and he would
[1:28:44] try to judge and the Bible said
[1:28:46] everything he saw and hurt everyday MEXT
[1:28:48] his righteous soul he saw the evil he
[1:28:51] heard the evil words everything
[1:28:53] tormented him he lived a life of torment
[1:28:55] but Abraham was out here as a prayer
[1:28:58] where he had peace with God amen because
[1:29:01] he separated himself from the things of
[1:29:02] the world we must separate ourselves
[1:29:04] from things that torment us and that's
[1:29:08] the life Abraham lived as a child of God
[1:29:11] because he kept the good ground of his
[1:29:13] heart where as lot he was kind of let's
[1:29:16] see it shows lots heart was a little off
[1:29:18] because his wife was lost perhaps his
[1:29:22] wife you know encouraged him to move
[1:29:23] down to Sodom but we know scripture just
[1:29:25] says that he saw it and he saw the
[1:29:27] welled gardens of Sodom it looked like
[1:29:31] the Garden of Eden he thought and so he
[1:29:33] he was influenced by riches he was
[1:29:36] influenced by money and power as a mayor
[1:29:39] because he sat in the gate judges always
[1:29:41] sat in the gate mayor's leader sat in
[1:29:43] the gate he was more influenced by that
[1:29:46] than by living a life free from sin and
[1:29:50] I was gonna tell testimony I'll say that
[1:29:51] for Sunday cuz that that thought brought
[1:29:53] someone to the altar alright just a
[1:30:00] moment here all right so can everybody
[1:30:02] see that you can be saved but yet with
[1:30:04] no reward see that you can be saved but
[1:30:07] have no reward that's the thorny ground
[1:30:09] there's a thorny ground they'd have no
[1:30:13] fruit they'd have no reward to show for
[1:30:15] all that labor because it was done in
[1:30:17] vain
[1:30:19] cuz they love they let other things grow
[1:30:21] up they fed other things other habits
[1:30:24] rather than the godly habits of the Lord
[1:30:27] so true so true
[1:30:31] all right now all right let's look at
[1:30:37] this final kind of ground here how we
[1:30:38] doing on time pretty good
[1:30:43] let me check I got a few notes I want to
[1:30:46] make sure I I go through okay I got
[1:30:48] those
[1:30:49] oh yeah I'll save one for the end now
[1:30:51] this fourth kind of ground is the good
[1:30:53] ground that brings forth fruit in one of
[1:30:55] the three quantities either get 30 fold
[1:30:58] 64 or 100 fold
[1:31:00] Jesus caused this I love it let's read
[1:31:03] this let's go to Luke 8:15 you got your
[1:31:05] Bible I love what Jesus calls us this is
[1:31:07] so wonderful
[1:31:09] Luke 8:15
[1:31:20] look what Jesus calls this good heart or
[1:31:24] the good ground heart but that on the
[1:31:27] good ground are they which in an honest
[1:31:30] and good heart having heard the word
[1:31:33] keep it and bring forth fruit with
[1:31:35] patience can you say amen to that
[1:31:39] so that means this heart isn't as honest
[1:31:44] right if this heart is totally honest
[1:31:47] with God and Britain keeps the Word of
[1:31:51] God so that means this heart doesn't
[1:31:52] keep all the word and isn't exactly
[1:31:55] honest I say brother how you doing
[1:31:57] sister how you doing you say oh I'm okay
[1:31:58] but yet all rowdy you're not okay are
[1:32:03] you honest then or not that's why I like
[1:32:09] people if you're not doing good just say
[1:32:11] well I'm not doing as good as I need to
[1:32:12] do can you pray for me praise God this
[1:32:17] this kind is not as honest they're not
[1:32:20] as honest in their hearts as they should
[1:32:22] be
[1:32:23] now I'm not I'm not saying to go like
[1:32:26] program said I'm not saying to go bragh
[1:32:28] on the devil the devil's beating me up
[1:32:30] brother Aaron this week my he's kicking
[1:32:32] me to the curb
[1:32:34] let's not praise the devil okay but just
[1:32:39] be honest
[1:32:40] say you know I'm really struggling can
[1:32:42] you pray for me I want to be an
[1:32:44] overcomer can you can you pray with me
[1:32:46] please see honest honest but what do we
[1:32:51] have and sister Beatrice will know this
[1:32:53] she been around the word a long time
[1:32:54] how you doing if you are cup people how
[1:32:56] you doing and they say fine but yet
[1:32:58] they're lying through their teeth pretty
[1:33:01] soon they're out in the world
[1:33:03] pretty soon give him a few weeks or
[1:33:04] months we know that right so see an
[1:33:09] honest and good heart so rare to find
[1:33:13] someone that can be honest and tell the
[1:33:17] truth and keep the word that's being
[1:33:21] heard that's right see they
[1:33:26] here the word they keep the word and
[1:33:29] then they see the fruit of their lives
[1:33:32] hey man thank you Jesus
[1:33:35] with patience one of the fruits of the
[1:33:38] spirit see they're patient I know if I
[1:33:41] do good if if I by God's grace if God
[1:33:44] helps me if I just keep doing the good
[1:33:45] habits I keep investing in the Word of
[1:33:47] God
[1:33:48] I keep crucifying the flesh I keep these
[1:33:50] habits going I know if I keep doing this
[1:33:52] I know I'll bring forth patience
[1:33:54] I'll bring forth the fruits of the Holy
[1:33:56] Spirit see if you're honest hearted
[1:34:00] Christian you'll produce the nine fruits
[1:34:02] of the spirit because you're honest
[1:34:03] about your spiritual condition you won't
[1:34:06] let money riches or pleasures choke your
[1:34:09] love for God's Word as you love God with
[1:34:11] all your heart soul mind and strength
[1:34:12] you'll hate even one sin you'll hate
[1:34:16] even one stain upon your beautiful white
[1:34:18] garments James says pure religion is
[1:34:25] keeping yourself unspotted from the
[1:34:27] world the Bible says you won't let one
[1:34:30] evil root of bitterness spring up and
[1:34:34] trouble your heart because you're
[1:34:36] completely focus on seeing an abundant
[1:34:39] harvest for the Lord's glory amen
[1:34:42] you all let one root of bitterness or
[1:34:45] root of anger or anything root of
[1:34:47] depression root of doubt you all let one
[1:34:51] root of doubt rise up in your life
[1:34:54] you'll have it weeded up by the the
[1:34:57] great Master Gardener the Lord Jesus
[1:35:03] praise God that music on do anyone hear
[1:35:12] music a key thing is like one of my
[1:35:17] computer's like here like a instrumental
[1:35:20] music alright so we've seen those
[1:35:24] examples I'm almost done here oh yeah
[1:35:28] times fine when you have in the glorious
[1:35:30] time now we see the four kinds in
[1:35:33] Abraham's day we see the four crosses
[1:35:36] now here's one we didn't get to I like
[1:35:40] to
[1:35:40] see it is second Timothy to verse 20
[1:35:43] let's go there
[1:35:44] second Emily to verse 20 this is one you
[1:35:45] may not have seen too often 2nd Timothy
[1:35:50] 2:20 thank God if God calls us to have a
[1:36:05] good heart then God has to make a way
[1:36:08] for us to get there it's through a
[1:36:09] honest and good heart praise God
[1:36:12] a heart that loves the word more than
[1:36:16] anything else he's got to make away and
[1:36:20] that way is love hallelujah love love
[1:36:24] the Lord your God the first and greatest
[1:36:26] commandment and that Jesus said you're
[1:36:27] not far from the kingdom love the Lord
[1:36:29] love the word love obedience love to
[1:36:32] sing love to worship love the preaching
[1:36:33] love to read your Bible love to pray
[1:36:35] love God with all your hearts love 2nd
[1:36:44] Timothy 2:20 but in the great house
[1:36:48] there are not only vessels of gold and
[1:36:50] of silver but also wood and earth and
[1:36:52] some to honor and some to dishonor ok
[1:36:55] here it is right here yeah here's the
[1:36:56] the row gold so there's kind these are
[1:37:01] all the kinds of vessels in house
[1:37:02] gold silver would earth notice there's
[1:37:05] four there's always see God's placing
[1:37:07] them in for God is speaking to us
[1:37:10] through the number four all right so see
[1:37:14] the gold represents good ground silver
[1:37:16] the thorny wood the stony and earth is
[1:37:19] the wayside
[1:37:22] obviously gold is more valuable or
[1:37:24] useful or better than silver just as
[1:37:26] Samuel told Saul that David was better
[1:37:29] than he was right
[1:37:32] God saw David's life was more useful
[1:37:35] than saws because of David's pure heart
[1:37:38] okay wood and earth are dishonorable
[1:37:41] disposable vessels showing that the two
[1:37:43] hearts are lost the wood and earth
[1:37:49] was an honorable vessel did you know
[1:37:50] that Jesus literally called him a chosen
[1:37:53] vessel huh me know that hey Laurie
[1:37:56] Paul was a chosen vessel praise the Lord
[1:37:59] to bear his name to the Gentiles Kings
[1:38:02] and Israel the Bible calls Pharaoh a
[1:38:07] vessel of dishonor and that's in Romans
[1:38:11] 9 17 to 23 now here's a beautiful
[1:38:16] scripture proverbs 16:4 let's read that
[1:38:20] proverbs 16:4
[1:38:35] alright proverbs 16:4 it's a beautiful
[1:38:39] scripture right here so this scripture
[1:38:41] shows that God has all kinds of vessels
[1:38:44] and they all have a purpose proverbs
[1:38:48] 16:4 the Lord hath made all things for
[1:38:52] himself
[1:38:53] yay even the wicked for the day of evil
[1:38:56] see God has a purpose for every kind of
[1:38:58] vessel so these wicked vessels over here
[1:39:01] would an earth they have a purpose it's
[1:39:04] for the day of destruction it's the day
[1:39:05] of judgment they've got a purpose to be
[1:39:08] burned but these other vessels have a
[1:39:10] purpose to be used by God praise the
[1:39:19] Lord let me look here I may have one or
[1:39:22] two more thoughts and I got at least one
[1:39:23] more but let me look here at my notes
[1:39:29] okay let's now let's go to Luke 14 here
[1:39:37] yeah Luke 14 18
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:48] there's only four reactions to the
[1:39:51] preaching tonight Haven glory you'll
[1:39:55] react in one of four ways tonight's
[1:39:57] sermon how many believe that that's
[1:39:59] right
[1:40:01] so this sermon is either having one of
[1:40:04] those four effects it's either fallen by
[1:40:06] the wayside falling on stony ground it's
[1:40:10] falling in a heart that's all kind of
[1:40:12] clogged up with thorns bitterness roots
[1:40:14] of sin or it's fawn on a good ground an
[1:40:17] honest heart that's the kind of heart we
[1:40:21] want tonight Luke 14 verse 18 it's my
[1:40:25] last thought now this is the parable the
[1:40:37] great supper I'll preach Lord willing
[1:40:39] the whole message on this one and the
[1:40:41] parable the king's son because they're
[1:40:42] very very similar there's a few
[1:40:43] differences kind of like the talents and
[1:40:45] the pair and the pounds they're very
[1:40:47] very similar let's just start up 16
[1:40:52] Robert oh sorry Luke 14 16 then he said
[1:40:55] to him a certain man made a great supper
[1:40:57] and bade many and sent his servant at
[1:41:00] supper time to say to them that were
[1:41:02] bidden come for all things are now ready
[1:41:04] and they all with one consent begin to
[1:41:09] make excuse the first said unto him I
[1:41:12] have bought a piece of ground and I must
[1:41:15] go I'm sorry and I must needs go and see
[1:41:19] it I pray thee have me excused now can
[1:41:26] everybody see what is this ground
[1:41:27] talking about this ground is the cares
[1:41:30] of the world can Bri see that isn't that
[1:41:33] such a ridiculous excuse he's like mom I
[1:41:37] want to go look at my ground I just want
[1:41:39] to see it the king is like I've got
[1:41:47] everything ready Maya the food is hot
[1:41:49] and you sisters know how hard you work
[1:41:52] on dinner don't you and the Kings got
[1:41:54] all his his cooks got it all laid out
[1:41:56] you can smell it even the desserts
[1:42:01] but the guys like yeah yeah the gospel
[1:42:06] smells good to you but let me go look at
[1:42:08] my ground that I bought I'm really gonna
[1:42:12] transform this property
[1:42:14] look at my hills look at my lakes look
[1:42:17] at my rivers what a foolish thing to do
[1:42:21] the cares of this world why would you
[1:42:26] care so much about the property when
[1:42:28] you've got all the feastings of the king
[1:42:30] you got all the delicious tastes when
[1:42:39] there's a tablespread
[1:42:40] where the saints of God are fed Oh
[1:42:44] hallelujah come and dine hallelujah oh
[1:42:48] my thank you Jesus praise God a
[1:42:53] memorable Ram said that's what brother
[1:42:55] Neville was feeding the people the whole
[1:42:56] time remember the the dream said that
[1:43:00] sister had a dream earned her husband
[1:43:01] mr. Collins I think it was and they had
[1:43:03] a dream that brother Neville was
[1:43:05] delivering all the most delicious food
[1:43:06] in the tabernacle and they got scared
[1:43:08] and ran from it but brother said no see
[1:43:11] that's the message that we've been
[1:43:12] feasting on this whole time so live
[1:43:15] preaching when it goes right to the word
[1:43:17] is the most delicious food you can eat
[1:43:19] oh yeah because it's eternal life it's
[1:43:27] the word in due season and it's the most
[1:43:31] delicious food so see this land is the
[1:43:36] cares of the world he cared more about
[1:43:39] this land than he did about the great
[1:43:42] supper next in verse 19 and another said
[1:43:52] I bought five yoke of oxen and I go to
[1:43:54] prove them I pray thee have me excused
[1:43:57] now here we see the deceitfulness of
[1:43:59] riches right because these oxen would
[1:44:01] eventually allow them to plant seed and
[1:44:03] go harvest and then go sell it for money
[1:44:07] so the first guys just like look at my
[1:44:09] land
[1:44:12] then the next guy is like well I'm gonna
[1:44:15] go make some money I've got to go get
[1:44:17] the seen the ground I've got to get rich
[1:44:19] I've got to have a harvest rather than
[1:44:22] feasting on the things of God
[1:44:25] of course the last one and another said
[1:44:31] I've married a wife and therefore I
[1:44:33] cannot come he's a newlywed so what is
[1:44:37] he interested in the pleasures of life
[1:44:39] there's nothing wrong with being married
[1:44:41] but when a great man asks you to come to
[1:44:44] a wedding
[1:44:45] I'm sorry comes to a great supper you
[1:44:46] should come to the great man supper
[1:44:48] praise God because this is such a rare
[1:44:51] thing to be invited to the supper of the
[1:44:54] key or the great man praise God
[1:44:56] but see this guy looked at his
[1:44:58] relationship and he said well I love
[1:45:00] this relationship more than I love the
[1:45:03] invitation of the great man so that's a
[1:45:08] case where here's a man that loved his
[1:45:10] wife more and he loved Christ here's a
[1:45:13] man tears that we say for a woman here's
[1:45:14] a woman that loved her husband more than
[1:45:16] she loved Jesus the pleasures of life
[1:45:20] and all of these the Bible said choke
[1:45:23] the word cares of the world
[1:45:26] deceitfulness of riches and the
[1:45:28] pleasures of this life they all choke
[1:45:32] the Word of God let's say into our feet
[1:45:35] here
[1:45:43] the kingdom of heaven kingdom of heaven
[1:45:52] let's bow our heads here and let's think
[1:45:55] about our reaction to the things of God
[1:46:09] you know with those four hearts Church
[1:46:11] let's just think about our hearts
[1:46:12] tonight let's just take a little
[1:46:13] inventory looking at my last paragraph
[1:46:21] here okay let's have a word pray Lord we
[1:46:35] thank you for your word tonight dear God

[1:47:02] difference between the spirit and the
