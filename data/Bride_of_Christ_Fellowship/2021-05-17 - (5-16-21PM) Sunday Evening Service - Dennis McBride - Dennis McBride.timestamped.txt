[28:56] chapter 2.
[28:59] we appreciate everything that's been
[29:00] done since we've been here
[29:03] including for sure the fellowship it's
[29:06] been very sweet
[29:08] and good
[29:12] and we just thank god it's been a very
[29:13] enjoyable and blessed weekend for me
[29:16] amen so ephesians chapter 2 starting at
[29:20] verse 1
[29:21] familiar scripture of course it says and
[29:24] you hath thee quickened who were dead in
[29:26] trespasses and sins
[29:28] wherein in times past you walked
[29:30] according to the course of this world
[29:32] according to the prince of the power of
[29:34] the heir the spirit that now worketh in
[29:36] the children of disobedience
[29:38] among whom also we have we all had our
[29:41] conversation in times past
[29:44] in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[29:45] desires of the flesh
[29:47] and of the mind and we're by nature the
[29:49] children of wrath
[29:50] even as others but god who was rich in
[29:53] mercy
[29:54] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[29:57] even when we were dead and sins have
[29:59] quickened us together with christ
[30:01] by grace are ye saved and have raised us
[30:04] up together
[30:05] and made us sit together in heavenly
[30:07] places in christ jesus
[30:09] that in the ages to come he might show
[30:11] the exceeding riches of his grace
[30:13] and his kindness toward us through
[30:16] christ jesus
[30:17] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[30:20] and that not of yourselves it is the
[30:22] gift of god
[30:24] not of works unless any man should boast
[30:28] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[30:30] his word saints
[30:33] i didn't pray that i
[30:37] i need to pray amen let's pray
[30:40] heavenly father we thank you for
[30:42] allowing us to be here
[30:44] lord we pray that you would help us at
[30:46] this time
[30:47] fatherly or just direct this lord
[30:51] especially toward the young children
[30:53] father god
[30:54] to bring them to uh esteem
[30:57] what they have in a greater way
[31:00] father help us to do that lord in jesus
[31:02] christ's name we ask you
[31:04] amen amen amen god bless you
[31:12] all right um
[31:19] [Music]
[31:22] i'm gonna share with you a quotation
[31:24] here uh there are many things that god
[31:27] shared through his prophet it has really
[31:29] helped me along
[31:30] along the way but um this particular
[31:33] quotation here has meant a lot to me
[31:35] because
[31:38] i could really relate to it in regards
[31:41] to my life prior to
[31:44] coming to god and being exposed to the
[31:46] message of the hour
[31:48] when i heard the prophet say these
[31:50] things it was an immediate connection
[31:55] i can identify with it you know he
[31:58] talked about the little boy that never
[31:59] saw a mirror before
[32:01] you know and he sees a mirror and he
[32:03] makes a movement
[32:05] and then the mirror the image in the
[32:06] mirror makes the same movement
[32:09] and then he comes to a realization
[32:11] that's me
[32:13] you know and and that's that's what this
[32:15] had
[32:16] you know that's what it did for me in my
[32:18] life so this is from the god who was
[32:20] rich in mercy
[32:22] um and he goes on to say here
[32:25] he says for when god had you in his
[32:27] thinking at the beginning
[32:29] he says you have to be he says some part
[32:32] of you
[32:33] your life that's in you now had to be
[32:36] with god
[32:37] before there he says well
[32:40] when he before he even become material
[32:43] on earth
[32:44] before there was anything but god you
[32:47] were one of his attributes
[32:49] and we've heard these things over the
[32:51] years right
[32:54] but i do realize that it's a difference
[32:56] or yeah it is a difference between
[32:59] hearing something and then god actually
[33:01] quickening it to you
[33:03] because there are many things that i've
[33:05] heard many times over but it wasn't
[33:06] until the latter time that god actually
[33:08] helped me to see
[33:09] and understand okay wow i see it now
[33:12] you know so we hear these things or
[33:15] whatever but
[33:16] you know for the young people or what
[33:18] have you i know it'll come a time where
[33:20] god will make it real to you
[33:23] by his grace all right so he's saying
[33:26] that we were one of god's
[33:27] attributes he says he know what your
[33:30] name would be
[33:32] how many believe that amen so my mom and
[33:36] dad just didn't come up with a name
[33:41] hey man god already knew my name was
[33:43] dennis
[33:45] before my mom and dad were even born
[33:49] amen one thing i always consider
[33:53] when jesus was talking about elijah
[33:56] and he was talking about how he was
[33:58] going to come but how he's already come
[34:01] yes right yeah he could have called
[34:03] brother brandon's name right there
[34:06] but he held that yeah he looked he
[34:09] looked right at brother branham's face
[34:12] when he was speaking of that future
[34:13] coming of elijah
[34:15] amen he could have called his name but
[34:18] he held it because it wasn't time yet
[34:20] for that name to be made known so for
[34:23] every one of us
[34:24] god knew us prior to us coming amen
[34:27] we we i believe we were a part of him
[34:30] right a personal part of him right
[34:34] okay so he goes on to say
[34:38] he know what your name would be he know
[34:40] what color of hair you would have
[34:43] he knowed all about you you know and
[34:46] that goes into people that kind of want
[34:47] to alter themselves
[34:50] you know god made you in the way that he
[34:52] wanted you to be
[34:55] you know but the world again the
[34:56] influence of the world it influences
[34:58] people to make them
[35:00] not appreciate how they are
[35:03] right you know and try to live up to
[35:04] another standard
[35:06] then you have people trying to make
[35:08] themselves look like other people
[35:11] when god to you to god you're beautiful
[35:13] just like you are you're perfect
[35:16] amen amen he wants us to be able to
[35:19] appreciate that
[35:22] okay he knowed all about you he says the
[35:24] only thing happened
[35:26] he says is you when you being a sinner
[35:28] he says many of you can fellowship with
[35:30] me on this thought
[35:32] and here's here's the meat of it here
[35:33] saints when you were you
[35:36] when you were a little boy or a little
[35:38] girl
[35:39] you would walk around there he says
[35:41] would be certain things that would just
[35:44] he says where it wouldn't bother the
[35:46] other kids
[35:47] it seemed like there was something in
[35:49] you that cried out
[35:53] when i was young just to let you know a
[35:56] little bit about myself
[35:58] i was born in brooklyn new york
[36:02] my memory of brooklyn is zero
[36:06] because while i was one years old
[36:10] there was something that happened uh
[36:13] i don't know if my mom ever found out
[36:15] who it was but
[36:17] uh we lived in new york we lived in a
[36:19] you know an apartment
[36:20] unit of course the floors hi how many it
[36:23] was i don't know
[36:25] but at whatever apartment we were in
[36:27] there was a knock at the door
[36:29] and there was somebody there to do my
[36:31] mom harm
[36:33] and they uh forced their way in
[36:36] and they they went to assaulting my mom
[36:40] and my mom told me that uh the only
[36:43] thing she could do
[36:44] for me was take me and yeah i guess it
[36:47] was a couch that was there she flipped
[36:48] the couch over and she actually tucked
[36:50] me up under the couch
[36:52] and the person just started to assault
[36:55] my mom
[36:57] uh and i don't know how long it went on
[37:00] but
[37:00] whenever the person left my mom was kind
[37:03] of semi-conscious
[37:05] and she was able to remember where she
[37:07] put me and she got me
[37:09] and she went stumbling down the hallway
[37:11] and when she got to a certain door of a
[37:13] neighbor
[37:14] she's in her own words to me and my mom
[37:17] our home wasn't a christian home so i
[37:19] didn't grow up in a christian home
[37:22] it was it was it was worldly it was full
[37:24] of the things of the world
[37:25] so when my mom telling me this uh she
[37:28] she wouldn't try to sound spiritual but
[37:29] she said that when she got to the door
[37:32] of the neighbor she said the door just
[37:33] opened up and nobody was by the door
[37:37] and she looked down and said the
[37:38] neighbors were sitting there looking at
[37:40] her from the couch
[37:41] and when they saw her condition they
[37:43] rushed out to help her
[37:46] so from that my mom got put into the
[37:48] hospital and she was in the hospital for
[37:51] over a month trying to recover so during
[37:54] that time my grandmother
[37:57] which lived in south carolina she came
[37:59] and flew up and got me
[38:02] and that's how i got to south carolina
[38:04] from new york
[38:06] but even in that it was god's will that
[38:09] i go to south carolina
[38:12] you know there's nothing that happens
[38:14] within a believer's life
[38:16] that's just half hazard we believe that
[38:20] you know i'm speaking to you now
[38:22] whatever but each one of us have
[38:23] different backgrounds and things of that
[38:25] nature
[38:26] different upbringings uh and my purpose
[38:28] this morning is just
[38:30] again to help the young people to be
[38:32] able to more appreciate
[38:34] what you have within your parents and
[38:37] how you're actually being raised
[38:40] so my grandmother came and got me
[38:44] when my mother got better she came down
[38:47] her and my father went married
[38:50] so when she got better she came down uh
[38:53] and for whatever the reason was my dad
[38:55] didn't come down
[38:56] so i grew up without my dad uh
[39:00] only child uh and
[39:03] got here mom got here you know she tried
[39:07] to get her life together and whatever
[39:09] you know she wanted to go into nursing
[39:12] and she entered into the nursing field
[39:14] you know the beginning stages of it uh
[39:17] where she would just kind of
[39:18] assist whatever the term is for i don't
[39:21] know what it is
[39:22] but she was an assistant she transported
[39:25] patients and just did like little light
[39:27] work when it came to the nursing part
[39:29] nothing real in depth
[39:31] uh you know at a certain point
[39:34] a certain time period we were doing
[39:36] fairly well you know i wasn't hungry
[39:38] wasn't lacking for anything we stayed in
[39:40] an apartment complex
[39:42] and you know we had the little
[39:44] necessities of life weren't rich by any
[39:46] means but
[39:47] we had the necessities of life she was
[39:50] able to take care of me
[39:51] you know decently but then
[39:54] as time went on um
[39:58] some people became some people uh
[40:01] were introduced into my mom's life and
[40:04] there's one person in particular
[40:06] that was introduced to my my mom's life
[40:09] uh and it was another woman but it was a
[40:12] major turning point
[40:14] from the time that person into my mom's
[40:16] life everything went downhill
[40:21] you know she entered into a life of
[40:22] drugs
[40:25] and i know we've heard about the
[40:26] different type drugs that are out there
[40:29] there's not a drug that's out out there
[40:31] outside of a few that my mom
[40:33] didn't try uh
[40:36] right before my eyes i just saw
[40:38] everything just kind of crumble down
[40:41] and so my grandmother she didn't live
[40:43] far away
[40:45] and she was always concerned about me
[40:48] and uh you know basically our apartment
[40:51] became
[40:52] like a drug location uh
[40:55] i would wake up in the middle of the
[40:57] night sometimes to go and use the
[40:58] restroom and
[40:59] the restrooms across the hall from my
[41:02] bedroom
[41:04] but if i looked up the hall to my left i
[41:06] could partially see the kitchen
[41:09] and sometimes in the middle of the night
[41:10] i'll wake up to go use the restroom and
[41:12] i'll look and there'll be strangers in
[41:14] my home
[41:15] and they'll be in there using drugs and
[41:17] stuff like that
[41:18] you know uh but now now that i look back
[41:22] at it
[41:23] i marvel i marvel because
[41:27] god was keeping me
[41:31] so here i am a young man growing up in
[41:33] this kind of an environment
[41:36] right there was an acknowledgment of god
[41:39] but there was no serving of god
[41:42] okay so i'm growing up in this
[41:43] environment and that's why when i
[41:46] i read this because the neighborhood we
[41:49] lived in
[41:51] god you know as i grew up i got to be 10
[41:53] 11 12 or whatever you know
[41:55] um that's malachi
[42:00] your son's name malachi how old are you
[42:04] you're 14. okay so between 12 and 14
[42:10] the guys in in the apartment complex
[42:12] that i lived in
[42:14] uh they you know as far as
[42:19] they were out there pretty deeply even
[42:21] at a young age
[42:23] they were stealing cars brand new cars
[42:26] off of car lots
[42:29] and they
[42:32] they would take them and hide them and
[42:35] they would come and
[42:36] invite me to go and ride with them
[42:39] and i'm gonna read this again
[42:42] because he says here uh many of you can
[42:44] fellowship with me in this thought
[42:47] when you were when you was a little boy
[42:49] or a little girl
[42:51] he says you would walk around and there
[42:53] would be certain things
[42:55] he says with just where it wouldn't
[42:56] bother the other kids
[42:58] it seemed like there was something in
[43:00] you that cried out
[43:02] he says there was a god somewhere
[43:06] he says yet you were a sinner he said
[43:09] you remember that
[43:12] and as i'm listening to this i'm like
[43:14] lord i remember that
[43:17] and where those guys would come and try
[43:19] to get me to go and take joy rides with
[43:21] them in stolen cars
[43:23] something in me say no i can't do it
[43:29] and what it was was this saints
[43:33] he said you remember that he said
[43:35] certainly he says now what was that
[43:38] he says that was the little form of life
[43:41] in you then
[43:45] and then after a while he said you heard
[43:46] the gospel
[43:48] maybe you went to church
[43:55] he said you picked out this and that he
[43:58] says it went from denomination to
[44:00] denomination he says but one day
[44:03] you being a part of god you had to be a
[44:06] part of the word
[44:08] and when you heard the word he says you
[44:10] know
[44:11] where you come from
[44:14] you know what was the truth he says you
[44:16] are always
[44:18] he says the seed was always in you
[44:25] he says the word seen the word that was
[44:28] in you
[44:29] he says that was before the foundation
[44:31] of the world
[44:32] saw the word in you and you come to it
[44:38] so he was talking about the effects of
[44:40] the seed
[44:43] that was that seed was already in us
[44:46] it was in me and and god was influencing
[44:51] me
[44:52] through that seed even though i didn't
[44:54] know him
[44:56] it's the thing that made me
[44:58] uncomfortable
[45:00] that didn't allow me to go to certain
[45:02] extents that other kids could go to
[45:08] around about 12 or 13 years old
[45:12] living this living in this apartment
[45:14] complex living in those conditions
[45:17] there was something in me that was
[45:18] crying out
[45:21] to the point to where i would get up on
[45:23] my own
[45:25] and get myself dressed
[45:33] and i would walk the church i found a
[45:36] church nearby
[45:37] and i walked i went to that church on my
[45:39] own at 12 years old
[45:41] what was that
[45:44] that was the god who was rich in mercy
[45:49] what was he doing he knew who i was
[45:52] he knew i was a part of him he knew
[45:55] today i'll be here preaching
[45:59] isn't that something and not just me but
[46:03] all of us when we were young little
[46:05] little lads and things running around
[46:07] here you know living
[46:09] like contrary lives and in in wrong
[46:12] situations and whatever god was watching
[46:14] every one of us wherever we were
[46:17] and things could have turned out a lot
[46:18] worse
[46:20] the things i had become engaged in had
[46:23] it could have had a
[46:24] i wouldn't even be here today
[46:27] i would be dead the situations i was in
[46:33] you know outside one time i i didn't
[46:35] know what what crack cocaine was i
[46:37] didn't know what drugs was you know
[46:39] and i'm standing outside and it's a
[46:41] young guy that was involved with that
[46:42] lifestyle and he rolled by on a bike and
[46:45] he asked me to hold my hand out and hold
[46:46] something for him until he got back
[46:49] i'm just a little kid and i'm just
[46:50] standing outside i held my hand out he
[46:52] put it in there i didn't know what it
[46:53] was
[46:54] soon after a police patrol a police
[46:56] patrol car came running through
[46:58] ride through the neighborhood it was
[46:59] looking for him
[47:02] he circled back around and reappeared
[47:04] and asked me to give it back to him i
[47:05] gave it back to him it wasn't until
[47:07] years later i realized that was drugs
[47:09] that was on
[47:10] me
[47:14] i literally saw police come
[47:17] and knock on my like they knocked on my
[47:19] door because there was drugs being
[47:21] housed within the apartment and they
[47:24] literally bust down the door
[47:26] i had to go to my grandmother's house
[47:33] but yet in the midst of all of that
[47:37] there was something that was protecting
[47:39] me it was god
[47:49] message called come follow me
[47:53] he says i think sometimes in going to
[47:55] school now
[47:56] i think send becky and sarah and joseph
[47:59] he says into these
[48:00] these high schools and things he says
[48:02] where all this is going on
[48:04] he says i think i'll take take them and
[48:07] get them back into the mountain
[48:09] and raise them up there like the indians
[48:12] live
[48:13] why did he say that he was concerned
[48:17] about the activity and just just the way
[48:19] that the age was and the influences that
[48:22] were so dominant
[48:24] amongst young people you know
[48:27] you hear now today about you know young
[48:29] people bringing guns to school
[48:31] stuff like that look at the shootings
[48:32] that's taking place
[48:35] you know it's just so much we don't want
[48:38] to go into all the little group
[48:39] no details of everything but you can
[48:42] just see what's
[48:43] out there even amongst the young groups
[48:45] the young crowds
[48:47] know when i was growing up it's just a
[48:50] lot saints but
[48:51] he was concerned about the upbringing of
[48:54] his children in these environments
[48:56] because he didn't want the influences of
[48:58] the world a man to infiltrate
[49:00] to penetrate his children's lives
[49:06] and he goes on to say but here he says
[49:08] and then this is very important here he
[49:10] says
[49:11] he says but here is what it is he says
[49:14] what's in the kid is going to come out
[49:19] no matter where it is it's got to he
[49:22] says it's going to come out
[49:23] he says if it's evil in there it'll come
[49:26] out in the indian count
[49:28] if it's good in there it'll come out in
[49:30] any camp
[49:31] see it's what the child he says is it's
[49:34] what's
[49:35] in the kid the makeup of the kid he says
[49:38] what's on the inside of you
[49:40] and what you are now is what you'll
[49:42] probably be the rest of your life he
[49:44] says you're on a changing spot
[49:47] he's noticed this now he says do you
[49:49] know do you know what
[49:51] 86 percent of the other conversions to
[49:53] jesus christ has done
[49:55] before 21 years old all right he says it
[49:59] shows it
[49:59] statistics show and 86 percent that come
[50:02] to christ come before their 21.
[50:05] he says you he says after you pass that
[50:08] age you become more
[50:09] molded or set in your ways
[50:13] that's why amen though in those most
[50:15] impressionable
[50:17] years those are the most critical
[50:20] now i say that but also he brings a
[50:22] balance to it
[50:23] god can do anything so he's not saying
[50:27] thus saith the lord this is exactly how
[50:29] this is going
[50:30] you know no because god he went i was
[50:33] past 20. you know
[50:37] when when when i really felt the call of
[50:39] god
[50:40] and i felt compelled to begin to give my
[50:43] life to god
[50:44] i i had gone to the marine corps gotten
[50:46] out of the marine corps and i was
[50:47] past 20. you know what i mean so what
[50:50] he's saying here is not
[50:52] just like 100 across the board but he's
[50:54] just pointing out the
[50:55] the facts that he had come across at
[50:57] that time
[50:59] he's talking about statistics that he
[51:00] had come across right
[51:03] he goes on to say this he says you after
[51:06] you pass that age you become more molded
[51:09] and said in your ways
[51:10] oh it's possible sure he says they come
[51:13] 70 80 years old he says but it's very
[51:15] rare
[51:16] he says you make yourself when you're
[51:18] young
[51:20] i'm talking about the god who was rich
[51:21] in mercy
[51:23] because me according to my lifestyle
[51:25] meaning the environment i grew up in
[51:28] what i was exposed to
[51:29] i should be a much different man than
[51:31] what i am today
[51:34] but what made the difference it's that
[51:37] seed
[51:40] people can't make themselves good we
[51:43] realize that right
[51:45] amen brother branham talked about a
[51:47] social gospel
[51:49] that was being preached among the people
[51:51] it wasn't doing nothing for the people
[51:53] but but it go it goes deeper than that
[51:55] because if if predestination
[51:57] isn't there isn't a part of that
[51:59] person's life meaning being
[52:00] predestinated unto god to
[52:03] into me to manifest a part of god in the
[52:06] time that you're in
[52:07] that's the only thing that matters that
[52:09] seed is not there there ain't even
[52:10] anything in there to quicken
[52:14] unless you have the gene of god you
[52:15] can't even receive you can't
[52:17] truly be baptized by the holy ghost in
[52:19] the soul
[52:22] it's that gene of god that's in the soul
[52:24] already
[52:26] when we come into the world the gene of
[52:28] god is already in us
[52:30] isn't that right and in god's appointed
[52:32] time
[52:33] he creates the atmosphere around us to
[52:36] draw us into his presence
[52:37] and he begins to work on us and what is
[52:39] it doing is creating the
[52:41] atmosphere or the conditions around the
[52:43] seed for a birth to take place
[52:49] so now i'm i'm living with my
[52:51] grandmother now from 13 years old onward
[52:54] because the conditions in the home was
[52:56] too bad
[53:02] you know i'm growing up with my
[53:03] grandmother she did the best she could
[53:06] she was living on a fixed income
[53:09] and so there was a lot of things so when
[53:11] i was speaking this morning on the
[53:12] gauging success
[53:14] i experienced a lot of that
[53:18] you know i didn't have a lot my grandma
[53:20] couldn't provide a lot for me
[53:22] but i was going to school and i felt the
[53:24] pressures
[53:26] both spoken and unspoken
[53:29] i wanted to be accepted i wanted to be
[53:31] like everybody else i wanted to be
[53:33] looked at looked upon as being you know
[53:36] one of the cool dudes
[53:39] in the school you know so in order to do
[53:41] that you got to have certain things you
[53:43] got to have
[53:44] certain clothes and certain name brands
[53:46] and things of that nature you know
[53:48] so what did i do at 15 years old i went
[53:50] out and got me a job
[53:53] and i blew all of my money i had no
[53:57] money saved
[53:58] every check i got went on close why
[54:01] because i wanted to live up to a certain
[54:03] standard
[54:05] that my peers were calling for
[54:08] isn't that something i should have saved
[54:10] my mind
[54:12] amen i already had a good bit of money
[54:14] in the bank
[54:16] versus being broke trying to impress
[54:18] somebody that don't even care nothing
[54:20] about you
[54:20] that don't mean nothing to you
[54:24] so when we hear little things coming
[54:26] from
[54:27] other kids and things of that nature and
[54:29] whatever you you can't put a lot of
[54:30] weight on that don't put no weight on it
[54:34] you know you got to be able you got to
[54:36] come to a place by the grace of god
[54:38] where you dismiss it
[54:41] amen just dismiss it and ask god to give
[54:43] you help and grace
[54:44] to be able to stand and continue to
[54:46] stand for what's right
[54:50] coming through school now started
[54:52] working
[54:53] bought my own clothes bought my own
[54:56] vehicle
[54:59] 12th year in high school
[55:03] middle of the 12th grade year
[55:07] i always tried to find a way to get out
[55:08] of class
[55:11] just for a little bit just to get a
[55:12] break so i tell the teacher can i use
[55:15] the restroom
[55:17] so yeah go ahead so now i'm walking down
[55:20] the corridor
[55:21] the hallways are empty because people
[55:23] are in class
[55:26] and i heard this door closed behind me
[55:29] it was the door to the main office area
[55:33] and when i turned around i saw this
[55:34] young girl
[55:36] 12th grade walking in the other
[55:38] direction i just saw the back side of
[55:40] her
[55:41] and because i was there for a while i
[55:43] kind of knew new people
[55:45] and my first thought was oh it's a new
[55:46] girl that started coming to the school
[55:49] she having a long skirt things of that
[55:51] nature you know
[55:52] so i went on to my class
[55:56] after some time or whatever i got a
[55:58] chance to see her face i was like man
[56:00] she's pretty pretty
[56:04] you know but one thing that caught me
[56:06] was that because of how pretty she was
[56:08] she was getting a lot of attention and
[56:10] and i ain't like attention like that and
[56:13] i said well now
[56:14] i know i'm not going to talk to her
[56:15] because she get too much attention and
[56:17] they might bring me trouble
[56:20] you know because if i talk to her and
[56:21] everybody else want to talk to her then
[56:23] they're going to have some problems
[56:27] so i said i'ma stay away from her all
[56:29] together because that's going to be
[56:30] trouble for me
[56:32] and so i got to a point to where you
[56:34] know i i was able to
[56:36] get what they call pm release that means
[56:39] you come to school and you get out at a
[56:40] certain time
[56:41] earlier than everybody else and i had to
[56:44] choose a class to go to in order to be
[56:46] able to do that so i chose economics
[56:50] and my first day in the class i stepped
[56:52] in the door
[56:54] and i looked to my right in the first
[56:56] chair that was there she was sitting
[56:58] right there
[57:00] so because she was sitting there i
[57:02] walked to the other side of the room and
[57:04] all the way back to the back
[57:05] and i sat in the back chair in the back
[57:08] so i can make sure i didn't talk to her
[57:12] and then one day i came to class and i
[57:14] forgot my book
[57:18] and the teacher i believe his name was
[57:20] mr welch
[57:22] he told me to sit by her and share books
[57:25] with her
[57:28] and when i did that is our first time
[57:31] beginning to talk
[57:34] and i guess that was that because she
[57:37] became my wife
[57:42] you know but then it was through her
[57:45] because her parents
[57:47] back in the early 80s along with brother
[57:49] charles's dad they were all a part of a
[57:51] pentecostal church
[57:52] called progressive brother brooks was
[57:56] there as well
[57:58] they were all going to the same church
[57:59] brother brooks and my father-in-law are
[58:01] best friends they've been friends since
[58:04] like young they had a lot of experiences
[58:06] together
[58:08] if you ask them they've been shot at
[58:09] together and everything
[58:12] they were best friends you know and even
[58:14] to this day they talk about every day
[58:18] but nonetheless though uh her parents
[58:21] came
[58:21] out from the progressive movement
[58:25] around about the early 80s that's when
[58:27] god was beginning to deal with all of
[58:28] them
[58:30] and a lot was done that was the first
[58:32] time any of them had seen the pillar of
[58:34] fire
[58:35] because they were claiming a parcel of
[58:38] ground that the church is now on
[58:40] they were claiming a parcel of ground
[58:42] for their own so that they can actually
[58:43] build a church
[58:44] and the man was reluctant to sell the
[58:46] land in the beginning
[58:48] but then god moved upon them to kind of
[58:50] go and be more bold and direct with the
[58:52] man in a good way
[58:53] and the man had a change of heart so
[58:56] what they did is they didn't have all
[58:57] the funds to build a church and whatever
[59:00] and so they came and they began to march
[59:02] around the land
[59:03] they all got together walked up the
[59:05] street and they marched around the land
[59:06] they were singing songs praising god and
[59:08] that was their way of claiming
[59:10] the land and actually asking god also to
[59:13] bless them to build a church
[59:15] and during that time is when everyone
[59:19] that was there
[59:20] actually saw the pillar of fire appear
[59:22] and hover over the group
[59:24] you know many people that were there saw
[59:26] it
[59:27] and that's a testimony i've heard many
[59:29] times over from the witnesses that was
[59:31] there
[59:32] but that was just god showing himself
[59:35] giving them
[59:36] something to anchor them in what they
[59:38] were doing because they had made a big
[59:40] decision to depart
[59:41] from what they had known for so long
[59:44] so now my wife was brought up as
[59:48] as the young people are in here now that
[59:50] she was actually brought up from that
[59:51] time
[59:52] as the message became introduced and
[59:54] they began to grow in the grace and the
[59:56] knowledge of god
[59:58] uh so now here i am coming in contact
[1:00:00] with her but not knowing what she's a
[1:00:02] part of
[1:00:04] but that was god see he was directing me
[1:00:07] the whole time
[1:00:09] that wasn't a haphazard meeting amen it
[1:00:12] was
[1:00:12] god leading so now
[1:00:15] i'm with her now i'm being introduced to
[1:00:18] her family
[1:00:20] and it wasn't until sometime later that
[1:00:22] i was actually told about the message of
[1:00:25] the hour
[1:00:26] you know and i can remember that the
[1:00:28] time in the day or rather not the time
[1:00:30] of the day but i can remember how it was
[1:00:33] and it was her her brother that was
[1:00:34] about 12 years old
[1:00:36] at that time he asked me he said have
[1:00:39] you ever heard of brother brandon
[1:00:42] i said no who is that they say come come
[1:00:45] on in the rooms i got a video i want you
[1:00:47] to see
[1:00:48] it was a 20th century prophet and he
[1:00:51] took me in a room and he put it was a
[1:00:53] vhs
[1:00:54] right vhs put in the vcr
[1:00:58] and it started playing my first time
[1:01:01] ever hearing his voice seeing him or
[1:01:03] whatever
[1:01:04] but i found myself just sitting there
[1:01:07] and just
[1:01:08] feeling to stay there and watch through
[1:01:10] the whole thing for some reason it
[1:01:12] caught my attention
[1:01:14] what was it it was god's light crossing
[1:01:16] my path
[1:01:19] god's light flashed across my path
[1:01:23] and something happened but i didn't
[1:01:25] realize what was happening
[1:01:27] i just knew that an interest had had had
[1:01:31] appeared in my heart and now i'm sitting
[1:01:34] there looking at this tape
[1:01:37] so from that point on that interest
[1:01:39] never left me
[1:01:41] my father-in-law had a washing machine
[1:01:43] in the basement
[1:01:45] it was full of tapes
[1:01:48] that don't sound right right the washing
[1:01:50] machine was broke
[1:01:52] and it just had tapes in it old sermons
[1:01:55] from the church
[1:01:57] plus a mixture of brother branham
[1:01:59] sermons was in there as well
[1:02:01] and i started coming home from work and
[1:02:03] i had a little tape recorder and i would
[1:02:05] go down into that washing machine
[1:02:07] and go in and just kind of look at the
[1:02:09] titles and whatever and
[1:02:10] kind of grab something that seemed like
[1:02:12] it interests me a little bit or whatever
[1:02:14] and i go and i put it in a tape player
[1:02:16] and i sit down on the floor and i just
[1:02:18] listen most of the tapes i got in the
[1:02:20] beginning seemed to always be the prayer
[1:02:22] lines
[1:02:23] and i had never grown up around anything
[1:02:25] like that so my first thought was is
[1:02:27] this real
[1:02:29] you know but i'm listening it's like i'm
[1:02:31] feel i'm listening to the whole thing
[1:02:34] and i keep coming home and i keep going
[1:02:36] down there getting more tapes and i
[1:02:37] started listening and listening
[1:02:39] then all of a sudden i started finding
[1:02:41] myself understanding some things
[1:02:44] and i got a notebook and i started
[1:02:46] writing little things down
[1:02:51] and then it just kind of began to build
[1:02:53] and build and build and build and grow
[1:02:56] and grow and grow
[1:03:00] so it was through my wife that the lord
[1:03:02] allowed me to come in contact with him
[1:03:05] in his move for this hour
[1:03:09] and i just found myself following i
[1:03:11] couldn't explain it to you
[1:03:12] i didn't know why it was just an
[1:03:15] agreement that was in my heart
[1:03:19] i didn't have i didn't have no questions
[1:03:21] as far as to question
[1:03:22] it is this right who is this man this i
[1:03:25] ain't
[1:03:26] that was none of that there it was just
[1:03:27] i don't know like it was something about
[1:03:30] what he was saying that just set well
[1:03:32] with me
[1:03:36] so like i'm saying here you know he was
[1:03:38] saying that the seed of god was in you
[1:03:39] then and watch how he says this again
[1:03:44] he says here uh he said you were always
[1:03:47] the seed of god the seeds the seed was
[1:03:50] always
[1:03:50] he says the seed was was in you always
[1:03:54] the word
[1:03:54] seeing the word that was in you that was
[1:03:57] before the
[1:03:58] foundation of the word saw the word the
[1:04:00] word that
[1:04:01] that was in you and you come to it so
[1:04:04] that was god
[1:04:05] flashing his light across my path and it
[1:04:08] caught my attention
[1:04:11] and from that point it wasn't all at
[1:04:14] once
[1:04:16] but then a changing of my life just
[1:04:18] began to set in
[1:04:21] now all of a sudden the more i gave
[1:04:22] myself to listening to this word
[1:04:25] certain things just the taste of the
[1:04:27] world
[1:04:28] just begin to leave me
[1:04:32] without without without things being
[1:04:34] just heartbroken and things of that
[1:04:36] nature it was just something that just
[1:04:38] began to happen i just didn't feel no
[1:04:40] more
[1:04:40] to do this or to do that you know it
[1:04:43] just started dropping the desire just
[1:04:45] started
[1:04:46] leaving me it started dropping off of my
[1:04:48] life
[1:04:50] and that just continued like that it
[1:04:52] continued it's continuing like that up
[1:04:54] until the day
[1:04:55] god is still helping me to be delivered
[1:04:57] and to be freed from from many different
[1:04:59] things
[1:05:00] but the man i am today i should not be
[1:05:04] based off of how i started
[1:05:07] but it was the god who was rich in mercy
[1:05:11] paul knew what his beginnings were
[1:05:14] he was he was an enemy of the cross
[1:05:17] working against it amen
[1:05:19] helping to imprison those that were
[1:05:21] apart listen that was a part of his own
[1:05:24] family
[1:05:25] when i say that meaning he was a part of
[1:05:27] that group and he didn't even know it
[1:05:30] stephen was his brother
[1:05:34] not blood brother but blood brother in
[1:05:36] christ he just he was still in ignorance
[1:05:38] he was still
[1:05:39] blinded he didn't know who he was but
[1:05:41] shortly after that what did god do god
[1:05:44] flashed across his path
[1:05:46] and he heard god's voice for the first
[1:05:48] time himself
[1:05:51] and what what what happened at that
[1:05:52] point it brought about a change
[1:05:55] it wasn't an immediate change it was
[1:05:57] just enough
[1:05:59] to stop him where he was and make him
[1:06:01] reconsider his ways
[1:06:04] then he left out god led him out away
[1:06:06] from everybody
[1:06:08] and dealt with his heart and when he
[1:06:12] came back from that visitation with god
[1:06:14] he came back with the same revelation
[1:06:16] that the rest of them had
[1:06:21] so it's not by works you know i mean
[1:06:24] even though we grow up in the church and
[1:06:26] things of that nature amen
[1:06:28] there is something that still has to
[1:06:30] happen with within each individual
[1:06:32] heart there's a real experience that
[1:06:35] must take place
[1:06:38] amen and that's that that's the real
[1:06:40] starting point right there
[1:06:43] now that's not to say that everything
[1:06:45] else was in vain no sir
[1:06:47] because all the preaching of the word
[1:06:49] that the young people are hearing and
[1:06:50] whatever guess what it's doing
[1:06:52] is like the watering of a seed that's
[1:06:54] been sown in the ground
[1:06:56] it creates an atmosphere around that
[1:06:58] seed
[1:06:59] is softening that hard shell that's
[1:07:01] harboring that germ
[1:07:03] amen and it's causing that shell to
[1:07:06] begin to break up
[1:07:08] lose its strength and begin to rot away
[1:07:11] so that that sunlight when it's beaming
[1:07:14] down now
[1:07:15] now it's causing the life that's in that
[1:07:17] germ to come forth
[1:07:21] that's where you see real boring again
[1:07:23] experiences take place
[1:07:26] you never know when it's going to happen
[1:07:28] how it's going to happen and what
[1:07:29] service it'll happen
[1:07:30] in but it's one thing for sure is going
[1:07:32] to happen amen
[1:07:39] god even though paul was persecuting him
[1:07:43] god was looking down on paul while he
[1:07:45] was a part of the pharisee group
[1:07:47] and god was identifying him as his son
[1:07:52] regardless of his condition yeah
[1:07:56] isn't that something god wasn't upset
[1:07:58] with paul because he was being who he
[1:08:00] was at that time
[1:08:02] he saw him as his son and he knew that
[1:08:05] he was going to come to that point
[1:08:07] to where he was going to leave what he
[1:08:08] was a part of
[1:08:10] and began to enter into god's purpose
[1:08:12] for his life more so
[1:08:15] but while he was in the pharisee
[1:08:16] religion guess what he was a son already
[1:08:20] the gene of god was already there
[1:08:24] isn't that something he had no clue
[1:08:27] though
[1:08:31] i'ma leave you with this scripture
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:53] second corinthians chapter four
[1:08:57] verse six it says for god who commanded
[1:09:01] notice how he says this now
[1:09:03] he says for god who commanded the light
[1:09:09] to shine out of darkness
[1:09:14] isn't that something
[1:09:18] so that means that the light was tucked
[1:09:20] away
[1:09:22] inside of that darkness
[1:09:28] and when he called for the light the
[1:09:30] light began to shine
[1:09:32] out of darkness that woman at the well
[1:09:35] she had a seed in her
[1:09:37] but it was covered over isn't that right
[1:09:41] but when she came in contact with the
[1:09:43] message of her hour
[1:09:45] jesus christ manifesting himself
[1:09:48] according to his word right
[1:09:50] what did it do his presence commanded
[1:09:53] the light
[1:09:55] to shine out of darkness the sunlight
[1:09:59] from his rays of life
[1:10:01] it pulled the life out of that woman
[1:10:04] and brought it to the surface and it
[1:10:06] made her express the part of god that
[1:10:09] she was
[1:10:10] isn't that right yes but for those
[1:10:13] who had a show of religion right
[1:10:17] that same life it pulled what was really
[1:10:20] in them out
[1:10:21] and caused them to show their colors to
[1:10:24] show that you know what i'm not really
[1:10:26] on god's side like i thought i was
[1:10:29] right because now i'm finding myself
[1:10:31] hating
[1:10:32] the very manifestation of god that's in
[1:10:34] my day
[1:10:37] brother branham said the shining of the
[1:10:39] light of the life of god
[1:10:41] it blacked them all the way out because
[1:10:44] what little light they did have
[1:10:46] when they rejected and responded to god
[1:10:48] manifesting himself
[1:10:49] in that hour and the way they and they
[1:10:51] responded to him in the way they did
[1:10:53] it shut them all the way out he says
[1:10:57] now what little light they did have in
[1:10:59] the spirit and in the flesh
[1:11:03] they went to straight darkness
[1:11:06] isn't that something yes sir so i'm
[1:11:09] grateful for the god who was rich in
[1:11:11] mercy
[1:11:13] i'm grateful for what he's done in each
[1:11:14] one of our lives to bring us to where we
[1:11:17] are and the work ain't done yet
[1:11:19] but now we're in a place where we can
[1:11:21] actually
[1:11:23] i can relax more because i know who i am
[1:11:26] now
[1:11:29] maybe it's some that's maybe in here who
[1:11:31] don't quite know who you are you're a
[1:11:33] little confused you don't know
[1:11:35] maybe the devil is fighting you and
[1:11:36] telling you well you know maybe you're
[1:11:37] not a christian
[1:11:40] you got to dismiss all of those thoughts
[1:11:42] yes
[1:11:43] amen you believe god you you lord i
[1:11:46] believe i am a christian let that be
[1:11:48] your confession
[1:11:49] when you hear that spirit coming and
[1:11:50] talking and you trying to make you doubt
[1:11:52] that
[1:11:53] you combat it by saying the opposite
[1:11:56] don't settle down don't receive it block
[1:11:58] it out
[1:11:59] amen go turn on a sermon or something
[1:12:03] sing a song with something yes
[1:12:08] when we had a little mission work going
[1:12:10] back at home and whatever brother
[1:12:12] you met you didn't come did you didn't
[1:12:15] come
[1:12:16] and minister at our fellowship did you
[1:12:19] you did you remember mr wade
[1:12:22] him he's a he was an older man
[1:12:27] i'm just going to share this short
[1:12:28] portion of it
[1:12:31] he hadn't worked for many years so his
[1:12:33] his finances had dwindled all the way
[1:12:35] down
[1:12:36] he was he was barely getting by i mean
[1:12:39] like
[1:12:39] he didn't have nothing the lord blessed
[1:12:43] him to get a car
[1:12:44] a job or whatever you know but then
[1:12:47] things just wasn't panning out right
[1:12:49] just in the way that he would like for
[1:12:51] it to be and he had dealt with so much
[1:12:53] hardship and gone through
[1:12:54] through so many things he had just
[1:12:56] became real discouraged
[1:12:58] you never know what's going on with a
[1:13:02] person
[1:13:04] he was in the privacy of his own home
[1:13:07] the devil had gotten such a control over
[1:13:09] his mind
[1:13:11] until he he only he thought the only
[1:13:13] solution was was to take his life
[1:13:17] now i'm seeing him and i'm
[1:13:18] fellowshipping with him but i didn't
[1:13:19] notice that's where his mind had gone to
[1:13:23] and he had planned it out how he was
[1:13:26] gonna die
[1:13:30] he told me this after the fact
[1:13:33] planned it out how he was going to set
[1:13:36] it up how he was going to take his own
[1:13:37] life out
[1:13:39] he said and then something came to him
[1:13:42] and told him
[1:13:44] to go play a message
[1:13:48] and he went and he put on a message this
[1:13:50] is just a random message from brother
[1:13:51] branham
[1:13:53] he said something came to him right when
[1:13:55] he was having those thoughts
[1:13:56] of taking his life that night something
[1:14:00] came to him he said
[1:14:01] and told him to go and play one of the
[1:14:03] sermons i had given him a set
[1:14:08] he came to me later on after all of this
[1:14:11] days maybe weeks after and shared with
[1:14:14] me this testimony
[1:14:15] he said brother i'm telling you when i
[1:14:18] put that sermon on
[1:14:20] and i sat and i listened to it he says
[1:14:23] those thoughts completely left
[1:14:28] the desire to take his life completely
[1:14:30] left
[1:14:33] and it happened on more than one
[1:14:34] occasion he said
[1:14:38] so when the enemy comes and begins the
[1:14:40] war at the mine go put on the sermon
[1:14:43] yes go pray
[1:14:46] allow something to come in that's of the
[1:14:48] right spirit and the right boy it comes
[1:14:50] from god
[1:14:51] and allow it to begin to just to move
[1:14:53] upon you and minister to you and soothe
[1:14:56] you in your thoughts and in your mind
[1:14:57] settle you down because that's a battle
[1:15:02] and it's a spiritual battle and many
[1:15:04] times when we're having those battles we
[1:15:05] don't always distinguish things in the
[1:15:07] way that we should
[1:15:10] we know about the devil but yet when
[1:15:11] he's talking to our minds we don't
[1:15:13] always identify the voice as talking to
[1:15:15] us as the devil
[1:15:18] we find ourselves just in a place
[1:15:21] and the grace of god got to come and
[1:15:23] snap us out of it
[1:15:26] but he's rich in mercy he didn't allow
[1:15:29] him to take his life
[1:15:32] and i'm grateful for that he's grateful
[1:15:36] for that
[1:15:37] he's living to see another day
[1:15:43] as much more i could share things but
[1:15:45] i'm feeling the kind of stop right there
[1:15:47] just to give you a little glimpse into
[1:15:48] my past
[1:15:50] and what i've gone through to come up to
[1:15:52] this point just a portion of it
[1:15:55] um but for the young people you're
[1:15:58] blessed
[1:16:00] you are so blessed to be brought up in
[1:16:03] the homes that you are
[1:16:05] have the parents that you have to be at
[1:16:08] your age exposed to this truth
[1:16:11] even as i'm talking to you i know you
[1:16:13] know
[1:16:14] some of the younger minds or whatever
[1:16:15] they can't quite quite grasp but brother
[1:16:17] brother brother mcbride is saying
[1:16:20] amen but i'm trusting in god
[1:16:23] amen who's here right now and you are
[1:16:26] his children
[1:16:28] he's watching over you and the very
[1:16:31] words that are being spoken
[1:16:33] he'll bring him back to you and he'll
[1:16:35] actually move upon your heart to be able
[1:16:37] to understand it in the right time
[1:16:41] that's one of the works of the holy
[1:16:43] ghost when it comes in
[1:16:45] he said he takes the things you have
[1:16:47] heard and now he begins to make sense of
[1:16:49] it in your heart
[1:16:51] now you receive the inside teacher and
[1:16:54] he begins to expound
[1:16:56] on the things you've already heard
[1:17:00] bringing it back do you remember this is
[1:17:02] what it means this is what it means see
[1:17:04] it right here
[1:17:06] so everything is all right i believe our
[1:17:08] children will be all right
[1:17:10] by the grace of god it's god who is our
[1:17:13] father that's watching over the whole
[1:17:14] work
[1:17:15] it's his work amen so all we got to do
[1:17:18] is just trust in him
[1:17:19] and as he said enter into his rest
[1:17:22] we can really rest in confidence and
[1:17:25] faith
[1:17:26] knowing that we're in good hands
