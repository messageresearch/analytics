TRANSCRIPT
========================================
me the the it's in it's input and I think it's HDMI 1 I'm sorry no I think it's p PC just keep pressing that button I think it's PC in there we go very nice all right thank you let's give her two classs great job hun like I said she needs a raise too just like AAA everybody they all need a raise all the great work they do thank you darling I really appreciate that so we want to look here at this part 23 by God's grace on the book of uh Romans and uh I just thought you know I was just meditating a little bit you know this morning I thought you I just kind of like to update the church you know where we are prophetically you over these last few years I preached a few sermons on the signs of the end times and how close are we to the Rapture and looking at Russia's place in Ezekiel um and then of course the different countries that are named in the Book of Revelation in the tribulation period um but I just thought I would just rehearse this with you here um you know uh I believe brother Ram said the clogs of God's timing turn slowly right we've all seen a watch right and they have those hands in there and they you know they they turn slowly right but but how many know that God's uh moving everything right on time by God's grace Hallelujah so I just thought I'd share this you know where we are prophetically if you haven't thought about this lately you know really Church according to the Bible there's only been 6,000 years of human history and brother Ram said every 2,000 years God does something major right so the first 2,000 years he sent Noah and then he flooded the Earth the second 2,000 years he sent the Messiah and that caused the blood of Jesus Christ to be shed on this Earth thank God God has shed his grace on this Earth amen hallelujah let me set a timer gota see how it goes and then you know uh 2,000 more years God visited Christ visited in the son of man Ministry now of course most people won't recognize this but we recognize it because God sent brother brandham with thus sayeth the Lord and he's turned our hearts back to the Bible we don't look to things outside the Bible for strength we look to the Bible praise God and as I showed you there's hundreds of differences I just showed 110 I found some more this week even I got to add to the list but there's over 110 differences between true Christianity and the majority of denominations or Christian churches right and so but the main the main event though of these uh 2,000 years will course be the Rapture the Bible Paul calls it the Blessed hope amen hallelujah the Blessed hope of the believer Amen to be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye to meet Jesus in the air Hallelujah to be snatched away before God returns to Israel and brings a a a final judgment upon the Nations well maybe maybe that's a little bit pre pre uh pre uh little bit early by God's grace because I guess the final judgment on the Nations will be the Battle of go and Magog if I'm not mistaken but uh before the Millennium the final judgment upon the Nations we'd say so every uh 20000 years God does something great you know we can all feel the tension amongst the Nations right uh but no one no man knows the day or the hour you know we've heard over the last few years uh preachers and all kinds of people every year they predict this is the last year and every year they've been wrong but uh we know at some point it will be the last year but we know for sure Jesus said these are birth pains right we know that for sure that that uh we went through a great birth pain in 2020 with the covid restrictions and everything and these wars now with Russia Ukraine Israel Hamas these are birth pains Jesus said there would be Wars rumors of wars right uh but he tells us this is not the end these are just birth pains the tribulation will be the time of uh the ultimate birth pains when when a new a new world is brought forth for the Millennium praise God A New Earth is birthed after the Great Tribulation period so we know it's all working together uh prophetically along these promises now now of course remember Church don't forget this this is why I want to remind you again uh we have thus sayith the Lord timeline from Daniel of course right um and if you turn this to its side then we we get the idea of a timeline you know Dan Daniel gave us this timeline so the head here would be about 600 BC and of course the feet is right here where we're living so we're living in the feet of this image right we're living in the feet okay so uh if you put this timeline on the the whole human history we're just living here you know at the very end by God's grace this is where we're at we're at the feet of the image right Rome is ruling the world it doesn't seem like it but Rome is right we can see it by God's grace uh the Bible said the Roman Harlot I'm sorry the mother Harlot the Roman Harlot that's cheer too uh commits adultery with every nation under heaven right we can see that it's almost spread to every nation under Heaven there's few more Nations it's got to go to of course uh uh the Bible said all the kingdoms will unite during the tribulation period so maybe that's the time period when Every Nation China and Russia and the Nations will finally Unite with the Roman Catholic church but it's going to happen it's Pro it's prophecy it has to happen Daniel said this image has to stand until the until the stone cut of a mount cut out of a mountain comes and it strikes this at its very feet and that will destroy this image amen that's the battle of Armageddon Church hallelujah amen in other words this image will stand until Armageddon and then when Jesus comes back he com comes back like a stone out of a mountain of course he's robed in white and then the Bible said this image will be destroyed from the feet and it will be dispersed like chaff in the wind amen that's what all these nations and all these nuclear bombs that's what it means go to God it's nothing it's just like chaff there's no power greater than God's power hallelujah amen brother said why should you be afraid all these men uh we saw how I think Zuckerberg remember he built did you see that underground layer he built over there in the island uh cuz he knows doomsday will come eventually right but brother no matter how deep you dig it you'll never get away from Christ Hallelujah he's King he's God hallelujah he's coming back Hallelujah the only thing to do is uh let his blood come upon your heart Hallelujah repent and serve God and and know that you're ready to meet him praise God brother R said the only place to go the only bomb shelter there is is under the shadow of God's Wings Hallelujah that's the bomb shelter we need amen you know you know uh we we say uh uh drawing real close to God that's the greatest bomb shelter we've got is drawing nigh to God resting in the bosom of Christ Hallelujah like John amen John beloved of the Lord Austin beloved to the Lord I'll never forget that Austin loved of the Lord hallelujah thank God but that's you know so that's where we see you know the the we're in the seven Church ages of course but we're at the very feet of this image now I want to just read it again here here here's profess Ally where we're at we're in the feet and whereas thou sawest the feet and Toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron so we're at the feet and the toes of this image part iron part clay the kingdom should be divided and brother says Clay is Protestants and iron is Rome that's what brother BR says but there shall be in it the strength of the iron the Roman Catholic Church for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with myy clay and the toes of the feet were part iron part clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken right so we can see the Roman Catholic Church is strong in some Nations but not others and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with myy Clay then shall they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with Clay so see we'll never really see this this great Unity right uh uh we just won't see they always keep their separation between uh Roman Catholics and Protestants remember uh the Bible says iron is the Roman Spirit of course Rome is in the mother Harlot Revelation 17 and then the Bible said she's got daughters or children in Revelation 2:23 Hallelujah just as Jezebel had an awful daughter just just the same as her so the Roman Catholic church has produced daughters denominations praise God now remember this is what brother Ram tells us look how theyve done look how they've weeded in just the things they've done look where they're at today look at Catholicism swallowing up Maring into it breaking this just exactly what Daniel said they do iron and Clay wouldn't mix but mingling their seeds one with another breaking every Protestant girl marries a Catholic boy has to raise the children Catholic and that's true that's my wife and I have seen that in our family we had a a family member Mary Catholic and so that family member had to become Catholic all like that Maring intermingling like that until it's come to a place to the whole United States is all wormed over so we see this is Satan's plan Satan's plan is to get all the Protestant families to take their guard down and say Well they're just they're Catholics they're the same as us and it's his plan through marriage right and we can see how that's been accomplished right it's it's uh Mo most Protestants don't even protest the Catholic church anymore but we are still the true Protestants amen we protest the the authority of the pope of Rome Hallelujah but we see how scripture has been fulfilled and so this has to happen these these toes and feet have to remain slightly separated but they're course closely together until the United States gets power to lay down the mark where you can't buy or cell without the mark right because the the Beast this Beast will uh I'm sorry that he had power to give life under the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed now brother Ram says the image of the Beast is United church and state right so at some point all these Protestant and Catholic churches have to unite with the United States government that's what brother R tells us and then any anyone will who will not accept this Mark will be killed because he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads so it's or it's either in your works or in your uh acceptance mentally or spiritually with the Beast and that no man might buy or sell say that he had the Mark or the name right Roman Catholicism or United Church or the number of his name and of course the number of 666 vicarious fil day that's the title of the pope of Rome right instead of the son of God so these are the ways that people will take the mark of the beast but thank God we're a million miles out of that hallelujah thank God we're like Abraham totally out of Sodom Hallelujah I've got videos if you want to see them where Sodom they've allowed that to come right into the Vatican they we have videos of the Pope and he's got all these half naked circus dancers and they're playing all together it's total trash it's come and all these trans people have come right into the Vatican right they are united but we're uniting with Christ the word hallelujah praise God Amen I just thought I'd uh rehearse us on this that although although it seems to move slow God's timing is right on time Hallelujah now remember we're in this we're in this fifth part here of we're in God's promises to Israel and I love how as we're talking about Israel Paul's also showing our place as the Gentile Church Hallelujah Al so yeah so we'll be on this for a few chapters here uh I'm probably going to skip through Roman Romans 11 because I I labored on that when I preached on uh the mystery of of Israel's blindness a couple years ago I think it was 2021 or 2022 I preached a whole series on that of course I was preaching the revelations I wrote in my book from Brother bram's Ministry but then we you know look at the last section is Christian Life last two sections are Christian Life and service and then the outflow of Christian love according to CI scoffield praise God now I want to pick up here basically uh Paul says man who are you to reply or contradict God you know we we looked at on on Wednesday night of how God is the Potter and we're the clay Hallelujah and God has to apply pressure on our lives to change us the church said like this morning little pressure I got to do song service and preach it's just some friendly pressure hallelujah hallelujah it's just the the normal part of life right there's pressures God but it makes us to rely on God more and I've just seen this church the more trials you have or the more pressure the more God shows up amen God won't leave you high and dry God said I'll never leave you nor forsake you Hallelujah I found that in my greatest times of pressure or or or difficulty that's when I I feel God the most Hallelujah that's when I can look back and say wow God was merciful god was gracious God kept me from other things and God was there with me the whole time even though I might not have seen it or felt it God proved he was right there with me the whole time Hallelujah so see we should never find fault with God God has never done anything wrong throughout our entire life Hallelujah and we should never resist his will we should just let God have his way in our lives the perfect will of God don't choose the permissive will choose the perfect will of God Amen right right don't resist his will Hallelujah but he said who are who are you oh man no EXC oh man we're just we're just a man we're just human shall the creation say to the Creator why have you made me thus Hallelujah so we want to remember how low we are remember last year I found how David complained against God but it wasn't in arrogance it was in desperation so we saw very plainly in Psalm 142 a prayer when he was in the cave so imagine you're in a cave no electricity no air conditioning well it's pretty cold in there already so no heat I'll say like that he said I Cried unto the Lord with my voice with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication I poured out my complaint before him I show before him my trouble so when when David's complaining he's just letting God know Lord this is the troubles that I'm going through I'm in a very dark place in my life right but he ends he ends the uh song by saying Lord bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name he's being hunted down by his father-in-law his own family wants him dead now which one of you can say that right his own family wants him dead but he said he said Lord bring me out of this because I Want To Praise Your Name now look he's being honest I'm having trouble praising your name so bring me out of this so I can really praise your name it's okay if it's it's hard to sing praises or it's hard to worship just keep calling out to God amen amen see just make sure it's your heart's desire Lord I Want To Praise you but it's just hard to do it right now save me so I can Praise You Hallelujah am the way I want to I'm like Jonah I'm seeing all these symptoms but I know you can bring me out Hallelujah right like brother van pray you know Lord these are all lying vanities Hallelujah help me Lord to see all these all these circumstances are just lying vanities amen he and David says the righteous shall Compass me so see he had hope one day I'll get out of this cave where I'm all alone and one day I'll be surrounded by saints that can encourage me praise God how many got that today got somebody that can encourage you today can brother Jesse or brother Jose or brother sister so and so can you find encouragement from a saint today you're not alone in a cave are you see there there's there's hope for you praise God for Thou shalt deal deal bountifully with me so David knew God dealt bountifully with me before I don't see it right now but he'll deal bountifully with me again so David recognizes seasons of Life some Seasons I see the blessings some seasons are darker I feel lone but I believe he'll bring me to another season hallelujah amen but see we shouldn't contradict God right we shouldn't uh speak against God now we know job did this right we know job did this in Pride and God rebuked him because God came down in a whirlwind and said who is this that confuses my counsel with no knowledge God spoke that to job right so we we see sometimes even uh we'd say the best of us we say some sometimes even the most spiritual of us we reply against God we we question why God would allow things to happen in our lives but what's God going to say if we don't repent God's going to come rebuke us because he loves us hallelujah as many as I love I rebuke and chasen Hallelujah G up thy loins now like a man for demand of thee and answer thou me where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth I love's first question is about the Earth where were you when I gave the Earth its resting place in the universe go ahead and tell me if you understand Hallelujah that's what Paul says oh how how can the creation say to the Creator why have you done this God had a very good purpose why he did it Hallelujah God knew had a very good reason why he allowed everything to happen in our lives to our friends back there brother mercy God had a good reason to bring him up from Texas Hallelujah I might not understand it brother Mercy but God knows Hallelujah God had a good reason to bring you all the way from Nicaragua brother Jose God God knows God knows why would I suffer like this or why would I have this health problem or why I have this spiritual problem why would I have this God knows exactly what he's doing praise God let us not uh confuse God's word God is God's word is not confusing God's word is very plain Hallelujah he allows all these things to happen and then he's with you during your trials Hallelujah he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you amen oh thank God Amen oh preach your brother Jesse because I need it amen me I'm talking about me preach brother Jesse because Jesse needs it amen hallelujah now who are you he says let's remember God's greatness let's remember how many stars are there church our Milky Way galaxy has over 100 billion stars and there's even then hundreds of billions of galaxies so however many stars there are in our galaxy that's how many galaxies there are and then our galaxy is 20 times or 20 b million times more luminous than the sun I tried to look at the sun I was thinking about this I tried to look at the sun while I was driving to church today I had to turn turn my eyes away quickly I couldn't handle it right but our galaxy is 20 times billion more bright than the sun itself and church out of all these trillions upon trillions and trillions of stars he calls everyone by name he's got a name for him now I can't hardly remember the 22 children that are in my class I'll forget their names by July I'll forget their names by July I'll say what was your name um Carrie no Savannah I'll forget 22 in one month but God knows an innumerable number of angels stars planets and he knows all the hairs on your head and he never forgets one of them hallelujah amen so church if he knows all that surely he can heal the broken heart yes amen and bind up our wounds because he tells the number of the Stars he can give you the number and he calth them all by their names am great and no noce the only words David has for God great great is the Lord and of a great power his understanding is infinite so see we cannot reply against God we cannot contradict God's word we can't speak against God this God is infinite hallelujah our god is Without Limits Hallelujah the Lord lifts up the meek so church what do we often need just a good dose of humility right that's what I say for me too he castes the wicked down to the ground so David said sing unto the Lord with Thanksgiving sing praise upon the harp unto our God Amen so again who are who are we I love this when I consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon the stars which thou has ordained I preached on this in the Colossians series a couple years ago what is man that thou are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him church if you actually think about how great the universe is it will make you wonder well well then who am I why how how why would God be mindful of me if this universe is so great Hallelujah now I just want you to see again the Milky Way galaxy we live in it's actually I saw an article from 2018 this morning it's actually bigger than what we thought is that any surprise to anybody that God is actually bigger than what we thought does that surprise anybody no it don't surpris me that the scientists are going to find out God's actually greater than what they thought God's creation is bigger than what they can calculate amen a new study shows it would take 200,000 years for a spaceship spr traveling at the speed of light to go across ourti Tire Galaxy so if you could jump on one of those rays of light and write it right riding the light it would still riding the light it would still take you 200,000 years to get across the entire galaxy so if you jumped on light out here now that's where we are if you jumped on a a ray of light it would take you 200,000 years to travel all the way across this is how great God is and Paul says who are you and I to reply against God hallelujah now I love what my wife and I were talking about you know if it takes light that long just to get across well then when God did creation he had to set all that light in order at the same time so he had to place light where it really couldn't go he had to place some of that light over here where it hadn't even had the time to go yet he just had to create everything right in order right because if God just created one light it would take you know light would still be traveling across this galaxy but God placed all the light already there TR traveling like you've been there forever hallelujah amen I hope that made sense if it didn't well I can't help you so this is what they thought they thought was this size but it's probably actually that size it's probably even greater than what they thought Hallelujah and church and then there's you and I that that our tiny that little light white light that's our galaxy amid th this is what just an artist just one idea of how big the universe is there's a 100 billion stars just in that little Dot and then there's hundreds of billions of galaxies and then God knows every one of their names what am I trying to say God knows every one of your trials God knows your entire life he's the author and finisher of your faith Hallelujah that's what I'm trying to show by God's grace and then we get these saw some pictures like this like even all this is all this is still in God's hands cuz God is still outside of all this that's probably the Milky Way galaxy there but I meant I meant it to be the entire universe right or something like this like God's got all this right in his hand there Hallelujah who is man who's man that's mindful or who who who is man that God is mindful of me so amidst all this amidst all that you know who am I that God would you know you know care to just look down on my situation or David could say you know who am I that that God would see me in this Cave of course he sees you in that cave amen of course he's going to make you Bountiful again of course he's going to make you praise the name of the Lord again hallelujah hallelujah he's the author of all of it he's got all this in control and church m he keeps it all right there in place for you he keeps all this in place and if he's got control of that then surely he's got control of Our Lives amen hallelujah and then think Church you know your heart beats 42 million times a year you probably get U an estimated three billion heartbeats in a lifetime and God made sure each time your heartbeat didn't skip a beat it didn't take a break from giving you oxygen to your brain where you have a seizure now if you that's I'm talking about if you live a healthy life all those heartbeats God already took care of it you don't got to worry about one of those three billion heartbeats Hallelujah that just ought to remind us I came from God and I'm going back to God brother Austin Hallelujah God brought me here God sent me here hallelujah God's got a purpose for me here praise God and there he gives trillions upon trillions of people all these three billion heartbeats gives them all and he knows all their hairs on their heads that's that'd be an interesting number to find out there how many hairs just on the living eight billion people how many hairs on their heads let alone the rest of their bodies Hallelujah this is God's greatness right and so Paul says who are who who are we to question God and I thought about this yeah I thought I use a dog because of Austin loves dogs you know in school I had to learn this you have to learn this Kingdom film class order family genus species I had to memorize that in high school but you know a dog is a type of animal uh then it's got a vertebrae but there's there's there's non vertebraes too right but it's a mammal but there's cold blooded animals too carnivores but there's vegetarian you know uh I don't know that one uh canine so wild dogs and then then you get down to just your domestic dog there's all these classifications and God by his knowledge he knew all these differences God made so many different kinds of dogs and so many different kinds of lions and foxes and all these things God's the author of it all here's a moss rose I don't know what my wife can tell me about moss roses but now that that that this is the plant kingdom I just went through the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom you know you got plants there's over a quarter million of those type of species then you have uh the flowering plants there's over a quarter million and dcot I've heard that before I don't remember what it was roses and their allies 18,000 different kinds the rose family's got 3500 different species and then there's 500 of this genus and then you have the moss rose just one one little Rose our God God Is So infinite no wonder the Bible said his ways are past finding out Hallelujah no wonder it says his thoughts are higher than your thoughts amen his ways are higher than your ways so I was just trying to blow your mind a little bit this morning just with how great God is and yet one of us will look at God and say God you did it wrong excuse me we can't even explain any of we can't even remember we can't remember 10 of these I had trouble remembering Kingdom film class order I I had trouble remembering that this morning let alone naming all these different species Hallelujah reminds me of that song How Great Is Our God Amen and yet Church despite all this he's mindful of you right he's mindful of you um David said that you know of course when when I consider these things the work of your fingers all these Stars plants animals which you've ordained what am I that you're mindful of me what am I that you remember me and you hear my prayers that's why we so rejoice when God answers our prayers because he don't have to but out of his love he chooses to answer our prayers amen he chooses to remember and remember the Book of Job said God has to make sure all those animals those wild goats get fed up there on the mountains right God's got to feed them too yeah the book of Psalm says that even the the water animals they got to rely upon God for all their food everybody's like God feed me God feed me we're like God feed me God feed me and God is faithful hallelujah thank God what is man that you're mindful of him when I consider all these creations of God what is man well one thing man is is in the image of God that's one thing and if we're in His image we're then we're the highest expression of his creation right we're the most like God of any other creature so that's why God is mindful of us because we're in His image we've been predestinated for his glory praise God and we still have that promise of Christ in us the hope of Glory Hallelujah and we can be like Paul brother Mercy who said Christ who worketh in me mightily God wants little old me little old you God wants to work mightily in our lives hallelujah amen who are you for thou has let let's read this I mentioned this on Wednesday for thou has possessed my Reigns thou has cover me in my mother's womb so God was right there before you were born making sure everything turned out just right God was right next to you right you're trying to hug up on your mom right but your God was right there hugging up on you Hallelujah I will praise thee for I'm fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashion when as there there was yet none of them right before anything of anything appeared out here you already had it all taken care of you already knew all about it in your books hallelujah how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how many believe the Bible is precious amen How great is the sum of them all of your thoughts if I should count them they're more in number than the sand when I awake I'm still with thee surely thou will slay the wicked so see all these reminders just let us know God is fighting for us God's not against us God is for us amen hallelujah God was with you in the womb God's with you outside the womb God will guide you safely home to Heaven Hallelujah surely surely if God orchestrated all these events in my life surely I'll get the victory hallelujah amen surely he's with me Hallelujah you'll slay the wicked that means he'll be merciful to the righteous depart from me therefore ye bloody men amen hallelujah God keep me from sinners Keep Me In The Fellowship of the saints of God hallelujah amen amen Who Am I who are you to question God's greatness and he hath made of one blood All Nations for of men to dwell on the face of the Earth and have determined the times before appointed and the bounds of our habitation God didn't choose for us to ride horse and Buggies although I guess we couldn't move to amus Country and do that but he chose us to have these benefits that we live in and why did God do this before before time so you would seek the Lord if happy they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us what a promise a God that makes this great Universe says I'm not far from each one of you and I put you in acine Hallelujah I put you in 2024 so you would seek me hallelujah amen amen and you would find me and you would know me Hallelujah and you would start to know some of my thoughts that I have toward you Hallelujah for in him we live so see Church we're never really living until we're obeying the holy spirit daily I'm talking about a daily basis that's when we really know we're living is when he's in us and we're doing what he's called us to do that's living like brother raham said a doctor he said be the best doctor you can for Jesus when the doctor serving there or the farmer when they're planting the crops or harvesting when they're doing it for God's glory God's living right through them right and thank God The Doctors show up because when you're sick you want a doctor there right thank God the farmer shows up and plants that that cabbage because you really want to get a cabbage when you go to the store Hallelujah some of you more than others amen in Christ you move in Christ you have your being as certain also of your poet said so Paul quotes uh Greek poets he quotes their poets back to them so see their poets agree with the Bible so Paul could quote them right we also are as Offspring and I got some wrong scriptures on there sorry but the the scripture ends with we are his offspring you came out of God so you're God's children that means God's going to watch over you amen hallelujah so remember our Lord is the Potter ha not the Potter power over the clay of the S same lump to make one vessel unto honor and the other unto dishonor remember you are a lump the Bible says but the church is also a lump that's why we got a lot of Leaven churches around right they got a little bit of Leaven and it just corrupts the whole thing right soon as they let that Trinity Doctrine in oh my then what else is going to come through there well look well the Trinity so good it came from the Catholics well I guess we can compromise a little bit with the Catholics I guess we'll just take up their communion same transubstantiation they do we'll just pick that up you see it's just it's a slippery slope now I looked up a few more verses on the Potter but we are all as unclean things and all of our righteousness as filthy rags that's a menstrual Rag and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away so our sins take us away from God and there's none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take a hold of thee now of course Paul quotes that remember Romans three for thou Hast hid thy face from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities now Paul's I'm sorry Isaiah speaking of Israel there right God hid his face from Israel because they wouldn't confess their sins but now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father we are the clay and thou are Potter and we are all the work of thy hand so I love what God can do God can take a people that are disobedient and have been uh transgressing his commands and disobeying him God can take a people that are so disobedient and if they'll just repent and humble themselves then God will make them like his child God God will so easily forgive them and welcome them back in hallelujah amen right they were disobedient there all these iniquities God hid his face from them but as soon as they're ready to seek God God Will O lovingly open his hands up and bring them back to himself and he'll put them on the potter's wheel again now my wife explained to me a little bit about the potter's wheel so let me get to that in just a little bit here go to Jeremiah 18 if you got your Bible there Jeremiah 18 I didn't have time to put all this or actually forgot to put it on there had time Jeremiah 18 I'm going to try to remember my wife's details here in just a little bit so you can help me Huns you know my memory verse one Jeremiah 18:1 the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words now it's funny some Churches call themselves The Potter's House but they let the women wear sexy clothes and wear makeup I'm sorry that's not God the Potter you got a different Potter's House than God's house Hallelujah you went down to the wrong house verse four and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the Potter to make it now if I understand this right the the the the the pot that he had was marred it was it wasn't in the right condition but he's going to take that same lump of clay and use it to make it something better that's that's what I understand from this so in other words you can be in a bad shape but God's still not going to throw you away God's just going to start all over again amen God's just going to mold you again God's going to fix what was broken amen God's going to change what you were and make you into something new Hallelujah am Glory look at verse 5 then the word of the Lord came to me saying oh House of Israel cannot I do with you as this Potter sayith the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in my hand oh House of Israel whose hands are you in today are you in Satan's hands no sir you're in God's hands at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it if that Nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil I'll repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them and at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and plant it if it do evil my sight that it obey not my voice then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them now therefore go to speak to the men of Judah and to the habitant of Jerusalem saying thus sayi the Lord behold I frame evil against you and devise the device against you return ye now everyone from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good now we'll pause right there so God tells him Israel I can form you however I want but yet I'm going to be merciful if you repent I'll make you into something that's worthy I'll make you into a vessel of Honor Hallelujah and so he says in verse four I can take your life if it's been marred if it's been uh uh if it's been destroyed if it seems like it's in an awful I can still make something beautiful out of your life Hallelujah now I'm going to tell try to tell this honey okay so help me out here my wife said in college she would do the uh the throwing right the throwing of the clay so my wife said the first thing you had to do was go over and pick out the clay that you want there's lots of clay right so kind of laying all over there what clay do you want go ahead and choose that's what God did with you God come over and said I'm going to use this it don't look very good I'm going to use this it's mine he could have chose anybody else but he chose you Hallelujah there's a big bunch of lumps of clay over there but he chose you and you and me and you he chose all of us hallelujah you didn't have to amen but then my wife said once you once you get it then you got to slam it down a lot to get all the air bubbles out ever feel like that once God chose you you had to go through all these trials and I don't mean just like I mean slam down I'm starting to remember this now I think I did that one time too by God's grace but we just rolled ours out but I remember we had to slam it down on the table boom one after another this trial Jose and then this trial it's like God when is this going to end when all the Air's out when all the complaining is out Hallelujah slam it again slam it again you're not even on the wheel yet amen hallelujah the pressure hadn't even been applied yet Hallelujah and the church said you're not even you're not even being pressurized you don't even got the Waters of the word on you yet and the church said I should probably stop saying that now okay so he's just throwing throwing now whatever point now what point can you take it off and stop doing that hun ah when you start to get the little smoothness in your life Hallelujah all those rough Parts out right and then I think at that point then it goes on the wheel no what happens then oh that's right you got to wedge it yeah you got to wedge it so instead of slamming your life down now God starts putting his hands in there a little little more details and maybe the the big parts of his hands and working and once it's wedged then it goes on there but it's not even in the center yet once it's on there I'll say like this church see it takes a while for your life to get into the center of God's will is that right church because we have our ideas well I think I'll serve God God that way God said no no that's not the center of my will I still got a lot of molding to do in your life before you're in the perfect will of God hallelujah so you it spins right you start adding water and you just gotta what do you got to do what that process I forgot that part what was that part H the the clay oh the same direction that's right so it's spinning you got to push it down build it up you got to get all the particles moving in the same direction we got to get all of our thoughts going in the direction of God's word a lot of our thoughts at the beginning they weren't thinking about God we had our plans our ideas think about Joseph you think Joseph had any particles going in the direction of being a slave in Egypt or how about being in prison in Egypt you think Joseph had any ideas about that you think his particles like that no he had to get his mind wrapped around that well this must be God's will and pretty soon the particles got in line hallelujah amen they got such in line that when his brothers said we're sorry he said it wasn't even you God put me on the potter's wheel Hallelujah God this did this to save life Hallelujah right see all his particles got in the right direction God allows every trial God allows every test it's all forming to God's will just let me be in the center of God's will Hallelujah and after all that once you got the particles in the right situation then you can start forming all the pressure right and create all these different designs or shapes your life gets shaped and then when it's finally done then it goes to the fire where the fire permanently makes it the vessel that God can use what a type of sanctification right because how many how many would be a vessel God can use I think there's a couple types in here I think the soul is the permanent type but I think our whole lives our human Spirit stays on the potter's wheel okay I got two different visuals there two different ideas right once your soul is sealed it's permanently sealed to the day of your Redemption once you're sealed with the Holy Ghost your your soul is like a vessel that God can use for his glory right but your human mind stays in this continual uh process of sanctification trying to get all your thoughts to line up with God's word trying to get all your habits and your desires to line up with God's word am make sure they're all going in the same direction so I think I did a pretty good job remember what you told me H yeah yeah okay yeah she said amen all right yes all those uh vitamins are working brother Jose all those all those herbs I take in the morning they're working Hallelujah mainly it's just getting sleep hallelujah amen thank God God said if if you want if you'll repent he said I'll bring you back to the wheel and I'll make you in a something that honors me hallelujah how many want to honor God Amen Lord keep your hands on my life amen keep shaping me and molding me let me be a vessel of Honor for the glory of God because God's got power to do it I love what brother said they said brother brandom um can you prove your names in The Book of Life he said no I can't prove it he said God could use me as a vessel Of Dishonor see look how humble he was he said in other words he never he never disrespected God he always said God can ultimately do whatever he wants remember one time brother said God you owe me and God left him for I think it was two weeks God never would even talk to him that's a good spanking anybody anybody ever had two weeks in a corner or two weeks in uh isolation what do they call in prison when you get in the what do they call it you you get solitary confinement hopefully nobody's been in solitary confinement right right they'll just let you wait it out all by yourself so brother R came to the spot I realized God don't owe me nothing God can use me however wants so God I say like this just have mercy on me use Me For Your Glory Hallelujah that's my request now I never finish this verse uh from Wednesday night Paul says what if God he's willing to show his wrath and make us power known endures with much longsuffering the best of Wrath fitted to destruction so what if God is being longsuffering on Judas on the popes on Pharaoh right on our current uh White House Administration what if God is just being longsuffering with them because he's eventually going to show his wrath right he's being longsuffering to the vessels of Wrath that he might make known unto you the riches of his glory because you're a vessel of mercy and he's prepared you before forand for his glory amen hallelujah so one type of vessel he's longsuffering with he just has to put up with them the other one he says I'm showing you all my glory he said I'm showing you because I prepared you for this Hallelujah showing you the glory of God oh hallelujah amen Church we're so blessed we get to see God's glory amen not God's Wrath right people always uh I guess they had all those awards for the Hollywood stars a few weeks ago people always say oh what uh H how how fancy they look dressed and and uh how amazing they look and church every one of them is a drug addict possessed with demons and they just kind of come out like they're so fine and fancy and they're all demon possessed they've all made packs with the devil right but here we are we made a pack with Christ Christ hallelujah amen we get to see God's glory they'll never see God's glory because they're vessels of Dishonor but God shows us The Riches of his Mercy Hallelujah and the Bible said they're new every morning brother amen amen new every morning we get to wake up in our sound Minds who knows where they'll wake up how many times of these people like I showed you that Robin Williams man how many times and these other me members how many times I think shared no brother Ben Rod said that Matthew Perry how many times were they in a rehab facility he said it was countless I can't get over drugs so I'm going to go check myself in ain't that amazing Church look at the glory of God in your life they got to go check themselves in and they never even get fixed we can go check in with God in a prayer meeting and we can come out permanently fixed amen hallelujah praise God and we'll never go back back to it again Hallelujah Glory it's the riches of his glory upon the vessels of Honor amen that's why brother R said you you think I'm crazy he said just leave me alone I'm better off this way hallelujah amen I'd rather be this way than any other way I know hallelujah oh thank God for the Holy Ghost amen thank God we can feel God's glory amen amen a man in his 60s brother Jose a man in his 60s emailed me and said I can't overcome pornography I said brother you got to go find the joy the prince of God because in the presence of God is the joy of the Lord I said if you ever got in the presence of God all those things would die out to you you never desire the porn again because you've been in such a greater presence hallelujah amen I said if you can't find a message church that has the presence of God find the closest thing that's got the presence of God because in the presence of God you'll find Joy you'll find Victory you'll find Deliverance just go get in the presence of God hallelujah amen he said Co made him stop going to church I said there's your first problem he said I'm glad you didn't rebuke me when you emailed me back I said brother I never rebuke you I want to see you saved Hallelujah I got the remedy it ain't me I just know it it's Jesus put yourself on the potter's wheel amen hallelujah and his presence is fullness of joy Hallelujah yes now I I close with this but I never finished it oh God the proud are risen against me and the Assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them so David said these Sinners are after me they don't even recognize you but thou oh Lord art a god full of compassion he's got this full universe but he's also got this big heart full of compassion for me amen and gracious and longsuffering and plenteous in Mercy and Truth amen turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto thy servant and save the son of thine handmade he brings his mom into it don't forget my mom too I came out of my mom and don't forget her hallelujah amen have mercy you're full of compassion Hallelujah and great is your mercy toward me Hallelujah so see not only does God have mercy and longsuffering on the vessels of Dishonor David is a vessel of honor and he says you're full of Mercy you're full of compassion on me as well sounds like this God is merciful upon everyone amen he is he is hallelujah because the rain falls on the just and the unjust I love this you know I mentioned this on Wednesday the second Peter 3:9 said God would that all men be saved God wishes every person would repent even the vessel of Dishonor but of course he had to make him that way by forn knowledge he knew but he still he still invited Cain he said if you just repent you'd rule over your brother but God knew he was a serpent seed right God knew where he came from but yet he still offered him Mercy but God formed him the right God formed him the right way God knew that's kind of best way you wanted to be and I love what Genesis 18 said uh Abraham's praying interceding for lot and he says shall not the judge of the do what's right and church we're the Seed of Abraham we just sing it I Am A Friend Of God he calls me friend how many friends out there we got Hallelujah right and he said you're the judge of the whole earth you'll do what's right amen If Abraham knew God would always judge every situation right well then how much more will he continue to do the same he'll judge our lives right as well amen amen he'll judge right between the Sinner and the saint that's what God is he's a fair judge judge of the whole universe he knows the difference between the wise and foolish virgins one of my preacher friends sent me this nice book it's about uh David and Saul and it's about Saul and Absalon and this man he must have never knew the message because he says he says we don't know the difference between David's and Saul's only God knows I said that's not right God knows the difference between wise and foolish virgins how Hallelujah Samuel knew the difference between David and Saul Hallelujah in other words we can know a real David we can know a wise virgin when we see one because they got the oil Hallelujah they've made the preparations they've got the oil Hallelujah and we can know the difference between a foolish virgin as well we see it often remember all these things God is going to judge all the saved and the lost by their works that's what the Bible said the books will be open and Revelation 20 and he'll judge them he'll separate them sheep as goats and they'll be judged by the things they did in the books right so Church let's look at some of these simple summaries of life you know God's this great God of the universe right but I love there's a few examples of how God just summarizes how our life should be does God want you to S you know sacrifice 10,000 rivers of oil sacrifice your first born so just so your soul can be saved and and God and Micah says the prophet what does the Lord require of you like sometimes we think God requires so much out of our lives and Micah just brings it down humbly what does god require of you just to be just to love mercy and just be humble you're you're on that you're you're just a very tiny Speck of a speck of that entire universe what's god require of you just to love mercy and walk humbly before God just brother Austin we just got to be humble buddy that's all let's just humble ourselves praise God let's just do what's right brother Mercy do what's fair be fair sometimes we comp complicate things like you know some some people uh like like the Rich Young Ruler he had to go sell everything well God never asked Abraham to go sell everything sometimes we comp we complicate things well am I doing everything that I'm supposed to do God will show you exactly what he wants you to do you don't think the god of the whole universe will tell you what to do you think he's going to help you to miss it I think he's going to help you to see it Hallelujah what's he require of you except just to be just merciful and humble another way to summarize it let's let's hear the whole conclusion of the matter one of Austin's favorite books here fear God keep his commands this is the whole duty of man just always honor God and do your best to keep his commands we know nobody's perfect he didn't say be perfect he just said keep them do Jesus said if you love me keep my commands amen for God will bring every work into to judgment and I say God judge my works now so I'm not judged later in other words show me if I'm doing a a wrong work now if I started something the wrong way show me now so it can be fixed real soon because I don't want I don't want any Works to go before me to the Judgment in other words I don't want to be a Bo virgin right I want all my I want all my Works pure now I want to do everything right now on this side amen every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be bad remember we preached on that cleanse me from Secret sins how many would say Amen to that amen that's why I think that sermon from brother Dennis and then following up on that was so special for us it was special for me I've lived higher I told you this I've lived higher since those that that those those Services by God's grace that really helped me by God's grace I love that's how God does it whatever you have need of he'll send a preacher in right there to preach it to you amen and you just got to sit there and say Amen yes I'm going to repent now I'm going to obey that now I know God's talking to me now thank God for coming down my my Pew right coming next to my seat or I should say seat not Pew thank you Lord for coming to speak to me right at my seat in the house of God so these simple summaries be merciful do just just fear God keep his commands how about this one Lord you've given me this and here here's what I've gained beside them here you gave me five talents I've gained five more right Lord you gave me salvation and I gave you all these Decades of my life Hallelujah right that's I can tell God God you saved my soul at this point brother I'm I Lord I gave you 20 years of sermons you gave me brother mercy God you gave me a little fire in my in my in my soul you gave me that little Holy Ghost fire like a button I'll give you last 20 years of sermons all these videos all these things I I give you my whole life here here here here here's here's here's here's the fruit of my life I'll say like that and he'll say Well done good and faithful servant all she did was serve in other words Lord I've just tried to serve you all my life here's Decades of service here's my children I've given back to you Lord God they're saved they've had experiences with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah thank God I give them back to you lord lord I was there's my hour Lord I've been Faithful over these few things you given me all I had was a family and a church and a job that's all I really right I got those three areas I got my my my home I got this church I got my job I was just faithful with these few things Jesus says well done I'll make you rule over many things can are you starting to put yourself in there now you I'm putting myself in there as an example now you put yourself in there that's what we want to tell God lord I've just been faithful with the things you've given me I feared you I've kept your commands I've tried to walk humbly love Mercy Hallelujah I'm trying to be just I'm trying to be [Applause] fair with this uh three score and 10 years you give me 70 years Hallelujah M set my yeah I just cross my hour that's right yeah okay that's right okay yeah amen amen as he also saith in Hosea the OC is Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not my beloved so again I preached this a couple years ago right you are God's beloved in that whole universe there's only one Galaxy where there's life and then that whole galaxy there's only one tiny little planet and God said that's my beloved the people that love me that's my beloved a oh God loves you church amen oh the Bible says you're the apple of his eye amen think about that his eyes is over that whole universe brother Jose but his his eyes is right on you amen hallelujah and this will come to pass now remember before the the Gentile uh before the church ages his eye was mostly on Israel right he was Mo mainly looking at Israel he'd have some prelit right but now that Israel's rejected Christ now he's got his eye on the Gentiles ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God church so we should live live we should leave here leave this service remembering I am God's beloved God is mindful of me and I am his child he covered me in my mother's womb he wants to live in me move in me and have my being he wants to control all three parts of me Body Spirit Soul amen Isaiah also crith concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a remant shall be saved Hallelujah like I told you there is there is as far as I know right now now you could you could ask brother George Smith but there's at least one message Church in Israel there's actually Israelis that have believed the message Jews all the other ones are blinded but not that one message church I think the pastor's name is Solomon if I'm not mistaken because I remember brother George talking about that there is one message Church that's the remnant that's the remnant that's in the Gentile bride we believe if they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but there's also a Remnant the 144,000 Hallelujah which will Jesus will show himself to them they'll weep from house to house and then that Nation will be born in one day 144,000 seal with the Holy Ghost born children of God in one day God's beloved Hallelujah right now you're God's beloved W thank God and that remember that means favorite that's one of the meanings of beloved is your God's favorite that's hard to swallow sometimes I know it's it's true it's true maybe I'll show that to you again kind of blending uh evening service into the morning service here sorry I got to put Romans nine on there beloved to be fond of to love dearly to be well pleased to be tender with for a thing I thought it meant favor up to LIF I could be wrong on that I thought it said favorite there so forgive me either way he loves you dearly might have got my notes mixed up there thought it meant favorite I have to look it up I have to go to my previous sermons where I preached on it maybe I got different concordance hallelujah thank God you were not God's people but now you're God's people you were not his beloved you're not the one he loved now you're the one God loves amen hallelujah makes us joy unspeakable full of Glory for he will finish the work I'm finishing chapter nine I'm going to finish it by God's grace and cut it short in righteousness because a short work work will the Lord make upon the Earth remember that 20 2,000 years remember the 2000 2000 2000 God's going to cut this short it don't seem like it but God's going to cut it short in righteousness and as Isaiah said before except the Lord of Sabbath that means Lord of hosts Angel armies had left us a seed we had been as Sodom and been made like unto gorah Now isn't that true for you and I if it wasn't for God's longsuffering uffing and compassion on you we all would have been Wicked abominable Sinners I was right I was I was literally Wicked and abominal but God left me a seed God left me uh uh some hope Hallelujah God left me an opportunity praise God and I would have been as low as Sodom Gomorrah had it not been for the grace of God Hallelujah of course it's speaking of Israel as well what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of Faith Hallelujah so Church you and I are given the righteousness of Jesus Christ because we have faith and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen another Greek word for it is trust or Assurance you and I we have attained everybody say attained which means possessed you possess God's righteousness because you trust in it right so I'm sure there's all been times where maybe it felt hard to come to church right because you didn't feel good enough well why' you come because you trusted in his righteousness am anybody ever feel like quitting as a Christian don't raise your hands I'll raise my hand for all of you sometimes I feel like I don't know how much longer I can go Lord I know how much many more battles I can go through right it gets hard but see in those situations you the choice comes down am I going to continue or am I G to am I going to leave right am I going to be a Castaway well every time we always choose to go on because it's faith we have faith in his righteousness praise God it's already something you've attained to it's already something you possess it's already something God's given you it's a gift of Grace Hallelujah you have you have attained to his righteousness we're not saved by works we want to do God's work we so desperately want to do works that sometimes that we we we get confused like are we saved or not because we're not living up to our own expectations right is that right but ultimately it comes com down to I'm saved by his grace because I've obtained his righteousness am Hallelujah that's why we keep coming back to church right that's why we keep reading our Bibles and serving Jesus because it's his righteousness that we possess and I hope to show you this here this this was the last thought I'm going to share I'm almost at my well hour and 10 minutes now but Israel which fth after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone in a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so Israel the Pharisees Sadducees and most of the people they stumbled at Jesus why because they they enjoyed their denomination they had their own self-righteousness so they stumbled at Jesus and they wouldn't accept his righteousness his righteousness said everybody anybody can be a child of God blessed are the meek amen hallelujah blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God hallelujah right but they're like you got to be a Pharisee to see God I mean he made it so everybody had God as their father Hallelujah but this the the the Jews stumbled at that it was too simple right they were into doing their own Works they were they were caught up in developing their own righteousness right they like going to the the temple the synagogue and buying their own sacrifice which the Bible said was a sin they should have brought their own sacrifice they enjoyed just pretending church so they stumbled over that but God gave them a seed God had some Peters and James and John in there God had some real believers who would trust in the righteousness of Christ and not their own righteousness hallelujah amen and God was very longsuffering with them they wanted to call fire down from heaven as soon as somebody disagree with them and Jesus said you don't even know what Spirit you're of they want to judge everybody that didn't follow them you can't preach unless you're a part of our church Jesus said if they're not against me they're for me let let them go hallelujah amen he was merciful he was patient he was longsuffering Hallelujah most people stumbled it was just too simple what do you mean just believe and I'm saved that's all I got to do sisters sir is just believe in Christ and I'm saved that that's right yeah that's right but if I believe I'll repent of my sins right and I'll fall in love with Jesus and I'll sayl you save me now Lord what can I do for you Hallelujah and you're saying that while he's going like this boom still got some more air in there Hallelujah that's the beginning of just that's the beginning of sanctification right he justified you that's he's you're his clay now he's got to start cleaning you out get all those particles going the same direction get all the air out of there they stumbled at it because they wanted their own righteousness so I want to I want to close with this we can say we've obtained Christ's righteousness that's true but there's something we haven't attained to yet so let me just say like this we've made progress on the on the way of Holiness can I say it like that but we're not quite finished so I want you I want you to believe that scripture sister beatric you've obtained the righteousness of Christ you've attained it it's yours but keep reaching to attain more by God's grace amen hallelujah understand you have attained you've made it brother Austin you're you're there right in one way brother Mercy we've attained it we're there we got salvation Hallelujah but there's more to attain to by God's grace Israel has not attained to to to righteousness by faith but we have we are we are righteous through the blood of Jesus Christ so I just don't want you forget that you've obtained it you're God's child you're his beloved he loves you dearly you you you have that that's your possession that's your Birthright hallelujah amen you're in the family of God you're his beloved but you haven't attained more there's more things that we will attain by the grace of God and here's where Paul says it and I want to be found how many want to be found in Christ not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death Hallelujah okay now look here you you've attained it so here this what I want to show you you've attained salvation you're a child of God you you have that you have his righteousness but here he says now not as though I already attained talking about the resurrection that's the Rapture if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead so Paul's telling us you're saved you've attained salvation but you want to attain the rapture I've got this but there's more for me to get by God's grace I'm not going to be lost because I've already attained it Hallelujah I'm going to be saved but by any means by any measure I want to make the Rapture Hallelujah that's what I'm trying to attain to the first resurrection Hallelujah that I want to attain to the resurrection of dead I want to be there when Hallelujah we shall rise on that Resurrection morning amen not as though it attain or either were already perfect but I follow after that I may apprehend that for which also I am H apprehended of Christ Jesus amen so something has apprehended me and I want to apprehend that Hallelujah I want to understand I want to I want to possess what's possessing me Hallelujah Glory Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus Hallelujah so see we have obtained the righteousness of Christ but we are striving for this uh attaining of the Rapture Hallelujah but Satan will come around and say see you will never make the Rapture because you don't even you're not even saved nope I've already attained it devil I'm God's beloved I'm the child of God how do I know cuz he picked me out of the world he picked me out of Kenmore Ohio brother Aus that's what he picked you out of and then Lake havu Hallelujah he picks you out of the Kenmore he picks you out of wherever you were puts you down pounds you out and then he places you on his potter's wheel and you see his hands all over your life forming and shaping you
