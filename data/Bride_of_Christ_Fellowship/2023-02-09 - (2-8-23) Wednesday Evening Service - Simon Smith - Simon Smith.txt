[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] good here love to hear the the seeing the worship ing Soldier amen there's a warrior right there that testimony told me years ago still sticks with me and helps me push through almost every everything that looks almost like it's insane or a very dangerous situation or whatever like got me through many battles right there that testimony so I really always push out I'll never forget that brother just how it's not real amen so that one's the some of those some of them testimonies you know you forget here there but some of them you just never forget because they're just and God allows someone to go through something like that so he can testify because sometime in our lives we're going to need to have to hear someone else have already went through it and God can get him through it then he where he's going to get us through as well so amen so we're very grateful for those things I don't know if you know brother Ray there he he was working in uh one of the factories there and like a 900 pound bar fell on his hand or flipped onto his hand smashed it and he kept on working and just kept telling us work co-workers he said this isn't real and God healed it more actually he was smushed blood coming out and everything and God delivered the whole thing still works right there amen there it is he's so everything all things are possible to those that believe amen that's just spoken word absolutely so there you go amen we're go I thought about doing a PowerPoint we're just going to teach a little bit here let's turn to Psalms 104. that's a study I recently taught at home just um you know every every Bible study you know that I have ever taught or every little study I've taught that God had to show it to me and just bring something as Pastor Jesse knows and others who teach or preach or Whoever Whenever God gives you a thought that's for you and when he gives you that thought only you can see it clearest they'll say like that when when he gives you that thought that is for you specifically it's a personal revelation to you and then as as a minister or just like a testimony however when you try and speak and bring it out now it's it's for others to try and catch it and if you can yield yourself to the holy ghost that same Revelation understand that you caught the God will give to others so that's uh that's something that we want to uh maybe try and convey by God's grace this morning or this afternoon this evening so if we could let's turn to uh like I said there Psalms 104 and let me get there myself here I just thank the Lord Jesus Christ has been so good and faithful and working with the Young Apprentice now he's a first year and still learning a lot and but but when it's just me and him you know we get a lot I get a lot of witness and time in so just little things just pinpointing this and pinpoint and then you know as you get older you see and you see the younger generation and they think they know so much and this and this and you say hey well have you ever thought about this and then and all of a sudden the quietness comes and they're like you see all the wheels turning and you want to you want to try and get them to think for themselves really think about it think about the world we live in think about this and think about that and uh and then of course as Christians we want to say hey think about the Bible think about what God has done think about things the science can't even touch or even explain or even grasp they still don't even know I was like this electricians they still don't know electricity is they really don't know what it is some kind of power that you're able to harness I mean what is it they just really don't know so they even teach that in their electrical schools there so anyhow let's get to Psalms 104 we'll start at verse 1. and we're going to read through 1 through 13 there bless the Lord O My Soul o bless my God he says Thou Art very great and thou art clothed with honor and Majesty he says who cover thyself with light as with the Garment who stretches out the heavens like a curtain who lay at the beams of his Chambers and the waters who maketh the clouds his Chariot who walk upon the wings of the Winds who may get this Angel's Spirits his ministers a flaming fire who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed forever who covers it with the deep as with the Garment now notice how that is he made the world and then he just overflowed it with water the water stood above the mountains see so the mountains were already there oh he says anti-rebuke they fled at the voice of thy Thunder they hastened away they go up by the mountains they shall go down by The Valleys unto the place which thou has founded for them thou has set up a bound that they may not pass over that they may not turn again to cover the Earth who sendeth the Springs Into The Valleys which run among the hills they give drink to every beast of the field in the wild the wild asses quench their thirst he says by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branches he watereth the hills from his Chambers the Earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works uh he says he causes the grass to grow for the cattle and the herb for the service of man that he may bring forth fruit out of the earth so let's say a word of Prayer dearly father Lord Jesus we come humbly before you Lord on a Wednesday night Lord we still in this late laodice and hours later we've seen our Lord still have our privileges Lord to come and to a house Lord to a place set aside just for you to a sanctuary Lord to bring our vessels Lord to this place Lord and to offer up praise and

speak what you have to speak Lord you've put this on My Heart Lord a little bit ago Lord and we'll just feel like reiterating oh we love you bless the people named Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats there were um we had prayer back here with brother Jesse and then Amen brother Malachi and sister Lydia and I see brother Malachi and sister Lydia walk in and um it was the last time I was here uh the youth there went to that youth meeting Acacia was one of them as well and they all it was was it five of you six of you guys and they walked in and they just stood in a row I'm sitting on a chair they just stood at a row and I'm looking at how they've grown and how they've aged and they're like talking to me but I'm just not hearing anything I'm just looking at them and I'm like they're growing up they're getting old they're where I was 20 plus years ago and it reminded me all the way back to and I thought you know what I thought about was um generation number one our grandpa Garza God dealt with him from an alcoholic to a heathen and then made him a Christian and then that same uh Christian move was on my our mother and then now it's moved to us and now we're on the fourth generation here the fourth generation I wonder if we'll move right into the old promised land and just take over here and young ones you've got battles ahead but you still got our calebs and our Joshua's here you still got some that are willing to fight with you and keep you uh uh you know we're trying to we're going to leave you alone we're right here with you so uh you've got a lot the unknown coming we have the unknown coming but we're together and we are uh just trying we're just trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ we know he he said he would restore back to the book of Acts there's a move coming there's something coming that's going to what turn this world upside down one more time God is going to he's not going to leave this world without a witness amen so in this little study here I uh I want to teach on and maybe like I think I call it Hills and Valleys and uh to me you know God has been so good and uh and as I read this scripture I thought about how he's this is dealing literally with Genesis 1 and in Genesis 1 we know that God in the Bible said in the beginning God created the heavens and he created the Earth and then now notice he created the earth now notice and like I says right here he said he had the Earth already formed then he calls the waters to go over the mountains and it's almost like that water like almost hid the very plan of God all all the the devil could see maybe at that time was just this thing and then all of a sudden it was covered with with water and now he just saw this planet was just with just covered with with water and that's it and that's all he saw but under hidden underneath that water was he said what was it was the mountains was hidden under that water and The Valleys were hidden underwater and what the prophet of God said he says all the seeds that could ever be born were already they're already planned we're already planted in the Earth right there but remember as as God then come down and the Bible says let there be light and all those sort of things he come down and he hovered and brooded upon the Earth and then he started he started so he said speaking to the to the waters he says you got to move over here you got to move over here he says and the Bible said that he spoke and he said right here this is as far as you water can go the oceans can go only this far this River has to go down this place path right here and then he set up the whole thing right there so in others it's predestined if the if the Earth is a type of you because remember the Earth had to what he had it what the Earth had to what hear the gospel then it had to what get baptized then I had to receive the blood of Jesus on the earth amen for sanctification then what we know the fiery baptism is coming right here at the End Amen so and then the Bible says what the Earth shall become new the heavens and earth shall wax old but they'll be brand new again what a complete perfect type one of the believer right absolutely justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost what and Body Change amen absolutely it's exactly the same but everything was already predestinated right here for what for for what God's plan God's purpose Lord it was it was for his I'll say like this it was for his rich and it was revealing about his written word right there the Bible is right here in the Earth the Bible says you don't understand God God said don't understand things he says look at nature the nature will teach you amen the prophet of God I I just read a quote he says he says he says he goes people say there ain't no God and he says look at that Hill who made that Hill another thing I watched a couple uh little short videos there on their in their showing even greater things than even holin had found on creation and they're finding uh they're going up into these big uh uh they're taking the NASA shots of the earth there and they're showing of these giant mounds and Hills where it looks like what the water had brought in and formed all these just Rolling Hills and just like you go to a pond and you see these little Ripples and these little these little uh waves there and they cause these little ripples in the in the sand they're doing they've been they're sitting right there in the desert they're sitting right there on the edge of the Earth right there exactly the same just rope except they're huge Rolling Hills what great water there's a great flood already amen sure so as we as we get into this here I just want to teach on Hills and Valleys and and I was thinking all these things and I just found a uh maybe brother Jess has already taught on it but to me it was just uh phenomenal and and obviously one of the first things that comes to mind when dealing with Hills and Valleys is the first Samuel 17-1 and the Bible talks about how uh David was a chosen one of God he was anointed with what the Horn of oil and and all those sort of things and whatever and then what he heard that he his father sent him down to the camp there and there's what a great Philistine giant right and I remember I heard stories where brother Jesse would be in in the bedroom with the children and he'd be pretended to be Goliath and he let all the children slay him with the slaying with the the sling there and yes we go down as and they have a plan you guys remember that maybe I remember hearing about that but you know uh as as we see here you know the Bible and it brings forth and then David and the Bible says and now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at Socha he says which be long to Judah and Pitch between Socha and all these uh long names I can't pronounce them he says and the and Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and they pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle away against the Philistines and the Philistines stood on the mountain on one side notice the Philistines were on the Mountaintop on one side he says and on the other side he says to the Israel he says and there was a valley in between them right so notice Goliath and is they were on their top of their Pinnacle of their uh military might and then here Israel was at the top of their military might both there was a showdown that had to take place amen and it was we know the scripture how the giant or the giant would go down Goliath would go out and he would challenge Israel 40 days in a row saying bring me out one man he says he says then we're going to fight he says in a I win he says you will serve us he says but if your man wins we will serve you now that we know the devil's a liar they were that was not going to happen if they were to be we saw it right there did when David got that slinging slim did they turn around say we're going to be they no they didn't they didn't have to have nothing to do with that it was awesome he was alive don't ever believe anything the devil tells you amen sure that's right so notice he says but notice that as as it looks here and and and David had to get now the David was sent here he heard about it then something had to Quicken right we know that something had to take place in the heart to elevate his faith to a place where he said he says he says that man he says how can he defy the Living God right and as as David had thought about these things and rehearsed these things in his mind he thought about anything he finally made his Proclamation he says he says I'll go find him right absolutely and we know the story how uh I'll say like this as we know the story David was trying to uh uh move on and and then he met with the King and as he met with the King he rehearsed to the king what he what had had taken place and the King's like how are you going to fight him you're just glad you're just a young man you're just a boy he would never be in a battle you never had any training but remember the Bible said what that he his testimony before the King was he says he says David said he says I have slain a bear and one that came and took one of my father's sheep he says I went and grabbed it he's and I slew it he says and also a lion he said the lion tried to come down and take one of my father's sheep what he says and I went out and slew it as well amen now he was a type of Christ right now notice the Bible said well he says he says Ah what Jesus say I'll not lose one amen and the Bible says what is the second Peter he says what the Satan would come as a lowering roaring lion what to come and get one of you but what the Holy Ghost is here tonight and has been for the what the last two thousand years and Beyond and forevermore he is going to save his very elected amen and that's just the truth absolutely so notice we see now we see the great battle come forth and David now had the the anointing on him he had the Revelation he understood that all things are possible what that thought came back to him what have I already what has God already done for me and through amen you know what they say about the testimony I heard a man say he says would you rather get take on a lion or a bear and the guy said I'd rather be taking on a lion and they said why is that he says he says the lion will come up and grab your neck he says and they'll choke you out and then eat you while a bear will grab you and just start eating right then [Laughter] yeah that's right so whoa and now now as David thought on these things he says he says who is this man who is this though he was tall though he's big no he's this and this I'll tell you what you sometimes you'll look at a man in the eye and you know you can look at the Man's eyes and know he's already defeated amen but I challenge you to look at a lion look go up to a zoo and look at that Lion's eyes eyes and eyes like this absolutely no fear try and find fear in the Lion's eyes try and find fear what in the Eagle's eyes amen these people don't these things don't show emotion maybe a dog maybe but these things are out in the wild that has what survived the hunt to live amen and to kill Shore absolutely no fear they have to move into a shore amen so now notice as as he went on these things what we know that David then came down to the brook into a to a little stream there and he grabbed five smooth stones and one for what each giant each brother each one everything you know he'd have many many battles before this but what he just needed that one and the Bible said that David hasten too to Goliath and what they had to meet down into the valley what's its type of it's a type of hell right where was where was The Showdown at The Showdown necessarily well here's David and here's Goliath where where who showed who was the King right then who I was like who was the King right there when Jesus descended down into hell oh my God he proved through the king who the Lord Of Glory was amen praise be to God Amen thank you to God yes and what he needed one Revelation I am God Amen I am Jesus the sinless one amen praise be to God that's exactly right yes sir hey Satan's already been defeated his forces are on the run so much so that if you just what speak the name of Jesus Christ amen sure I I wonder if after that defeat after the defeat of the giant I wonder if David at one of the Philistines would if someone just mentioned David that people would go like this in the Philistines say don't you say that name don't you say that name oh my and what we say in the name of Jesus Christ what every Devil's got to Humble every Devil's got to want run and flee even Satan himself if you resist him he shall flee from you amen absolutely praise be to God yes and the Bible says what there was no sword with David it's not by hands it's not by man's initiative what is by the spirit of God Amen absolutely and you've got to have what the sword of the spirit right here right before you what because remember if God created all things through what spoken word and you are a direct seed line of God all you have to do is mention just speak the word of God absolutely and watch what takes place amen it might not happen right away it might not this and this but I'm telling you what it will materialize we believe that amen because the Bible said so now I like what the prophet of God said hears and works is Faith expressed he says now notice he's when it's revealed David become Fearless so in every battle notice he was on the Mountaintop at that time is where you get his Revelation what's the Valentine when you get the Holy Ghost you get a refilling a refreshing of the Lord amen where he's like you realize you're bad all day maybe I'm maybe I'm a judicism or maybe I'm not a son of God or a daughter or God doesn't have it but once you get a refilling or a touch from the Lord you say oh my goodness I am just with I'm one with God Amen absolutely and then let's say a battle or whatever listen and you get that fresh revelation I've got this in my arm I've got this in my leg or something or a physical this or a physical that a disease or an infirmity what if you believe it what's that Revelation that you're healed strikes the battle's over it's over it's over that's exactly right now notice I like what he says in the next one here by God's grace he says in little David's standing here with a little piece of leather or goat skin or sheepskin two pieces of string tied together which was uh yep he says but it was revealed to him Revelation struck him amen see now notice this is this works for anybody Upon This Rock I'll build my church which is what revelation who like you said right here says he says amen he said God took that bear he says uh took me in the paws the bear and took me out of the Paw's line how much more he will he deliver me from that uncircumcised Philistine in my hand he said well what he had to wait for the Revelation and when it struck he said it was Fearless he says his brothers way more able to do it I'm not saying something nothing but just but if it's like at 3am and brother just he's sleeping and you need something from God you don't necessarily have to call him you have to call on the Lord absolutely now notice he says now of course when you get get the testimony you call Pastor Judson say Hey Brother Jess Pastor Jesse guess what and you know through the phone brother Jesse's going to be praising God and just worshiping God and dancing before the Lord amen just like this and like so he says sure he says he says but you see it was revealed to them he says there it is they believed it because now notice he said the Israel believed it could be done they had the testimony all the way from Abraham from Noah from Adam all that that was their leadership that was their testimony that was their Lifeline right there they know God was real they know they were called of God they know they came out of Egypt they had everything under the great prophet Moses right sure he says now they were believed to become we could be done they believed God could do it he says but it was not revealed to them he says but it was revealed to David now there's the difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you he says you're going to get it he says you're going to get just like Brother Ray that thing lay on his hand I am sure the pain was maybe I don't know the pain but right then a revelation struck that's not real it wasn't real to anyone else but him sure he says you're going to get he says I don't care what's wrong with you what's the odds that may be worse than David and Goliath but if it's revealed to you see we always have to be open Lord what is your will in this situation what are you going to do right here and wait on him don't try to to go ahead of God's plan to go don't wait too far behind God's plan but make make sure we're all right walking in the correct steps at the right time with what has been revealed to you amen sure now uh one thing I love is David David's testimonies David's way of worship uh all everything about him he said the Bible said well he was a man after God's Own Heart just look at his songs [Laughter] everything's worship Judah means praise amen it's Psalms in Psalms 139 7 he says where there shall I go from thy Spirit how can I get away from you Lord he says wherever I go I feel amen praise be God when I'm down to the dumps I still feel you swooshed down and you lift me up he said well I'm the highest of heights I just jump higher I just worship the banner I praise God even the louder amen sure he says these are the Willows winner should I flee from thy presence he says if I Ascend into heaven Thou Art hair they're under there right there if I send one into the to the mountain top of the spiritual there we are he's a Divine make my bed and Hell behold Thou Art there as well amen there's your Mountain and Valley amen spiritually sure Realms yes now here's it here's something to think about here what's one of the most famous Psalms is 123. he says the psalm of David he says the Lord is my shepherd He says I shall not want he may giveth me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside he leadeth me besides Still Waters oh why he says he restoreth my soul he says he leads me in the past of righteous for his name's sake sound like it's a great walk with the Lord sounds like he's what Right Back to Eden it sounds like he's waiting Fellowship in the cool of the evening oh my he's just right there just praise God he says oh everything's just glorious but not aware now notice he's leadeth me he leadeth me he leadeth me and though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death he said did I walk into he says I walk through [Laughter] did he wait so he's he's in sunshiny days and the birds are chirping uh the sun is out and then all of a sudden it gets dark out of nowhere walked through the darkness but notice he wasn't alone he says when I'm in heaven he's a Thou Art when I'm in hell they're out there he says he says for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen and the prophet of God said well he says Rod was what the name of Jesus Christ amen you better have it because in that name liar salvation in that name uh healing absolutely what and he's right there in a present type of need amen so he says Thou prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies he says that would have noise my head with oil he says my cup runeth hope or amen even in that Valley even in that shadow absolutely when the prophet of God said well he said that shadow how do you make a Shadow he said there has to be a light be Hind so there's the devil trying to make it this and this but remember beyond that Shadows of the Holy Ghost beyond that little Pillar of Fire amen the face of Christ amen sure absolutely right there he says don't worry he says he's you'll just be here passing before a moment here he said but after that he says it'll be right back it will fall right back in line him absolutely he said but what I'm going to lead you right through this to be tempted remember if Jesus had to go through the Temptation in the wilderness he's going to make you go through temptation as well amen shadow of death shadow of death 40 days in the desert as Christ had to do without fasting 40 days talk about a shadow of death walked right through it and lived and succeeded and went on to conquer the very one that was the shadow of death yeah now think about this shadow of death was the fourth seal who is the shadow who is the death you know and we're in his shadow he says that I had it and when he had opened the force you I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death God is going to anoint the time Satan is going to himself shadow of death who is that horse rider it was revealed what in the first seal it was the Antichrist Spirit running and what is the shadow of death absolutely but notice we take these things on and notice this is right here at the end the fourth seal moves right into the tribulation shows what this last generation is going to move right through this thing see what you prepare for young ones Soldier future soldiers soldiers now we still have food right now we still have electricity still running water what about Ukraine where testimonies our brothers our sisters who believe the same message are eating what bark off the trees well we're the bride thinks of God the shadow of death may be coming the Bible prophesied for seal but remember he's God all ways amen praise be to God now I want to move into this another little Branch off this thought here you know I sometimes I teach a home and the cam gets up there and he'll just like Hammer the same thought like a thousand different angles and I'm just like it didn't even come to me but you know what I'm just I'm who I am I'm just limited to what God can give me amen like today I'll tell you it's on the job site I had all this whole in-ground Heating in in the foam and uh this and this and this and my project manager come up and said you forgot the sensor oh yes you're right absolutely thanks sir thank you thank you and I ran and got my piece of parts and I just put the sensor in real quick anchored to the wall and we're good to go absolutely the Lord Lord allows those things to keep me humble when you think you're a pretty good plumber and then all of a sudden you're like ah man I need he knows how to Humble you right in front of the project manager I'm sure he gets his cars going yeah I'm about to stop in more often often ah in First Kings 20. something phenomenal happens here the Syrian King Ben Haddad goes out and tells King Ahab Ahab he says writes him a letter Ahab all your Silver's mine oh your gold's mine your wives your children it's all mine Ahab reads it like okay yeah sure all right you know whatever and then he writes the more serious one says no for real call the council we've got an issue here and what they have they have forms of uh the king of Syria Ben Haddad forms an army comes up to him God says I'm going to give them to you The Mao and the battle took place on the Mountaintop the Bible says God came down with the armies of Ahab and slew him and set them away and set them around the Bible said there's a great Slaughter the prophet God comes Ahab says hey get a victory he's about this time of next year he says round two he had prepares forces remember in this time of peace took out your Bible is anybody going next door to door and grabbing your Bible say you can't have a Bible in this time of Peace we prepare for the Lord and the prophet God said what he says prepare for scriptural War right and they're coming with another plan another scheme another this and that but remember the testimony of Ben Haddad depends he says he's he gathered his counsel and troops he said he said their God must be the god of the mountains but he is not a god of the battle [Laughter] but if he would have just went back in history and seen how David came down and flew the Philistines in the valley a giant but he must not heard about that one so the servant of the king of Syria says their gods are the gods of the hills he says but he says therefore they are stronger than we are he says but let us fight them in the plane for surely we shall be stronger than they and of course the Holy Ghost knows all things here's all things and a prophet of God who can hear what the King was whispering the king of Syria is Whispering over there and God revealed to him he came to the came to Ahab and said hey they said they they're saying God is not a god of The Valleys but only of the Hills and then the Holy Ghost hits the prophet and says thus saith the Lord he says he says for my sake he's dominant he goes he goes Ahab I he didn't certainly say this but you know what Abraham's heart you know who Ahab was a lukewarm baxton want to be a make-believer right he says Jesus for my name's sake he says I'm going to show them that I'm a God of God and if we came down to it we've seen later in the scripture here that they did go to war and the Bible says well he delivered a thousands times thousands of times thousands what a footman they were all slain the Bible said they ran them so much that 27 000 other foot soldiers went in the hood hid behind some kind of a wall and just like God Knocked Down the Walls of Jericho how many what kind of wall was this what kind of a what size kind of wall could God push over and kill 26 7 000 people it's a big wall I wonder if it was built by Giants Justin we study that let me go amen so God pushed this giant wall over killed 27 000 of them and what God had the victory that day amen right right but where did Ben Haddad get that thought where did his counselors where did his wise men get the thought that oh he's the God Jesus or or Jehovah is the god of the hills but not of The Valleys where did he get that thought at because word gets round if you look at I want to read this here there's a quote from does God ever change his mind about his word and Israel of the Old Testament what we're reading about is a type of the Bride of the New Testament coming up out of the world marching on the road to Canaan he says that we go to the millennium right at all the entire New Old Testament that had to be lived out for our sakes everything they died in faith in is now ours the adoption now is what to the dot to the Jews to the Gentiles all the promises like we said before how many healing testimonies do you hear of the last 2000 years of the June raised from the dead Jews few and far in between if any for the most part them Jews were hunted down for two last two thousand years wherever they went they prospered and then the Judgment hit them it's history but in the Gentiles are people healing signs wonders and miracles so much so that it can't even not deny it all the way through history through even right now we have what testimonies where's brother bang at his your father-in-law your father right there was raised raised up from uh perishing what two three years ago right testimonies testimonies testimonies one after the other what because what everything passed it was the Jews were blinded to what we could receive it the Gentiles that was the great mystery what Christ in you performing his very will but remember the Old Testament was a type of the new so where did they get this idea where did those syrians get this idea that God is not a god of The Valleys only the hills only the mountains it's revealed here in I'll say like this we can start right here in the book of numbers 33 first 50s sister Acacia if you want to bring that up he says in the Lord spake and the Moses and the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho saying Speak unto the children of Israel and saying to them when you are passed over Jordan into the canis land notice they're in they're moving towards that Holy Ghost Field Land right there a type of the Holy Ghost they promised land right he said then they shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you drive them all out he says and destroy all their pictures destroy all their molten images and quite picked down all their high places pluck down he's and ye shall dispossess thee and the habits of the land and dwell therein if he says that's why I've given unto you the land to possess it let's thus say the Lord they have to do that that is their Commission General's orders yes sir right but notice verse 55 but if he will not drive out the inhabits of land before you then it shall come the past that those which you'll let remain of them shall be Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your signs and they shall Vex you in the land where you dwell in he says if you don't do it you're going to reap for this look at judges one Mr you can bring that up judges 1 verse 19. where did the king of Syria get this idea where'd they think about this because rumors go around the world and the Lord was with Judah and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain but he could not drive out he said the inhabitants of Valley because they had Chariots of iron pretty much all of the tribes when the promised land none of them I don't think as far as I know drove out those in the valley judges 1 27. neither did Manassa drive out the enhancements verse 20-28 but what took place and it came to pass when Israel was strong notice they did not drive him out but the Bible said God blessed them just like in the time of Egypt they were greater than Egyptians in the Egyptians had to bring them down right made them slaves but when Israel prospered in the Promised Land they would rather take money from the inhabitants than driving them out they'd rather compromise with the word of God and get a financial blessing pay tribute that's money gold silver shekels however you want to say it and they were content with letting the devil live there as long as they were getting financial gain as long as they were naturally or monetarily blessed sounds like laodicea now notice here verse 29. neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites verse 30 neither did Zebulon drive out the inhabitants but notice they became tributaries once again sold out for money even when they could have drove them out even when they had enough power and military force and might they said we'd rather have the money 31. neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of the land neither no no snow here 32. but the asteroids dwelled among the canines the inhabitants of land but they did for they did not drive them out verse 33. neither did enough tally drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh nor the habits of all these other ones but notice they sold out for money as well once One Tribe started just taking tributaries even though none of them could drive him out once one started collecting the money all the rest we're gonna do the exact they followed suit to organization well the prophet God would call it the golden calf scheme remember this is the type of the New Testament was not our forefathers supposed to keep the inhabitants the Devils the the Nicolaitans out of the church and little by little they let them in and what they brought them neglected what brought financial gain they brought this and that and all these things funding and organization program all those sort of things like I said I think it's one of the church ages says oh actually in the first one he says Thou hatest thou hatest the Deeds of the Nicolaitans right well when it goes down back then to two or three more Church ages uh God said he says I also hate those deeds but then the Bible says they didn't hate him anymore it didn't it didn't bother them anymore they had gotten cold and formal to it so so now let's continue on here verse 34. and now Dan which was the seventh tribe for the the eagle the north Camp the north tribe he's as an amorites Force the children down into the mountain they couldn't even they tried but they got forced in he says well they would not suffer them to come down into the valley this is the type of the church ages right here no one fully took the land just like I said in the prophet God said in the Feast of the the trumpets he says the Holy Ghost has been bound for a thousand or two thousand years one was abound all the way down to what 53 A.D is when now they did not they moved from what moved to organization moved to denomination and what the Holy Spirit his power his glory all that was now bound and they would and they've never seen a full release of those things amen sure now now notice here judges two and one and the angel Lord came from gilgal to bochum he says and said I've made you to go out of Egypt and brought you out you out into the land where I swear on your fathers and I said I I will never break my Covenant with you notice the Covenant of the Holy Ghost is still with us it is still possible to have the joy the victory the uh all that God has promised you know what they're going through the Old Testament he said what their teeth never waxed old their clothes never waxed oldies their shoes never actual he said they were in perfect the amounts of they were in perfect health all the way through that and now in the time of the Holy Ghost we should have perfect health we should have all those things all those promises are ours yes he said now notice he says but you have not obeyed my voice he says why have you done this but now notice therefore I said also I will not drive them out from before you now notice God says if you're not going to fight I'm not going to fight for you there's some things and I'm to be honest there's some things in my life I've been Lord take it from me take me he wants me to take it he wants me to put this thing in order let me tell you something you I'll say this the Bible says uh I'll say it like this through the anointing of the Holy Ghost and by Obedience of his word you have more strength and you know [Laughter] he says but they shall be his thorns in your size anyone got any thorns on their sides anything that what them that one punch the devil's got at you the one punch we just have to pray through or however what God wants us to take that thing away put on he wants us to put the holy spirit before what and put a hedge right there amen absolutely I I need that too as well he got he said and their God shall be a snare unto you amen now that's where they got that I'm sure as soon as though inhabitants of that Promised Land realized they their God would would never give that now they said they had they had all this testimony Moses did this and Moses did this and Jehovah did this and Jehovah this and yet it happens to land hundreds and hundreds years like hey we still got this Valley they become what mockers sure at the old at the end time saying oh where is the god of their fathers where is it knowing there's coming a time here shortly where the anointing of the Holy Ghost is going to strike and we are going free I'm talking free free I mean Super free where the bosses with the Spear of the Lord is there is Liberty absolutely and there's coming a liberty to the bride of Christ I mean I wonder if that's why brother yes we were we grew up in the Liberty Center what they call us the Sons of Liberty yes we found this power the only spot where Liberty is available amen and that is what now through the through the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and it guarantees you gives you the promise of the holy spirit amen absolutely praise me to God everything everything in your life means something amen praise God yeah we can relate yes now notice in Jeremiah 2 and 7 he says and I brought you into the piranha Pinnacle Country to eat the fruit the earth and the goodness there ever he says but when he entered he says you defiled my land and made my inheritance he says my Heritage and Abomination Saints are gone we've got to a lot cleaner we've got to get more Sanctified more sincere more in love with Jesus Christ so it's not not legalism it's not law but it's love ly we wake up and we read the Bible or we'll write at night read the Bible and say Lord I battled this today and I saw this today and I seen myself slip a little bit I took a couple of steps stumbled he said but Lord tomorrow it's going to be on again and I want this I want to I want to say no because I love him more because I love you more Lord Jesus amen that's why I want to that's why I wanna have a victory because I say I just love the Lord I don't want nothing to do with it amen I love his word I know his word contains life it's the only form of eternal life the Bible said well he says he's a search descriptions for in me he says in them he says you'll find eternal life and that's that's where we're going to look amen sure now we're on we're in we're in the anti-type the Old Testament was a type or the answer type we're the real thing now notice what the Bible says in the Old Testament Deuteronomy 11 verse 8 deuterine eleven oh this is not there Deuteronomy 11 say verse 8 says therefore shall you keep all the Commandments which I have commanded you this day that you may be strong and go and possess the land where you may possess that you may possess it he says he said that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them to their seed a land that fills them with milk and with Honeys it's for the land which thou thou goest to possess it is not a land of Egypt this is not we're not supposed to be like the Catholic Church we're not supposed to be like the world anything like the world he says from when she came he says Thou so is thy seed and washed it with thy foot as the garden of herbs he says but the land where you go to possess it is a land of Hills and Valleys and drink at the water of the reign of Heaven now notice what he says about this land in This Promise totally goes for land look what the look what God says about this land and the land which the Lord thy God careth for well I'm all alone and nobody cares about me nobody loves me man I'm just battling this by myself the Bible says in the land which the Lord God God careth for the eyes of the Lord are thy God the Lord thy God yeah absolutely he's Lord and God what of Our Lives he says are always upon it from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year you know what that includes that includes the leap year absolutely [Laughter] everything they got to add to it he says what he says Promised Land he says I'm watching over 24 7 365. he says none of you going to go down the way everything's in my control don't worry he says I love if you were in the Holy Ghost I love you amen he says because that Old Testament land is a type of me Amen in the spirit of God absolutely he is always watching you I'll be like this I was when I first come in the message and I heard this word and I was just like but then when the revelations the Bible says with much knowledge comes much sorrow I'll tell you what when you come in this message and you realize there's Judas and you realize there's faults in this and this I you battle those things in your mind and one day I was at this one job and I was running I was cleaning these steel parts and I was Dripping in this uh these uh metal uh like the polishers of these stones and I said a prayer I said Lord could you show me if I'm bride I hope my eyes just real simple prayer I hope my eyes and I'm watching these pieces tumbling this rock tumbler and one by one these little pyramid-shaped rocks started coming up out and I just rushing the message and I know about pyramids now I know about Capstone Revelations and I took those stones like huh and another one came up you want me came up five five b-r-i-d-e and that last one was a tiny little Capstone that had holes all over I called the holy Stone hey man that's Grace that's Jesus what that's broad amen that's Faith think about number five well brother that was The Coincidence was it well I kept watching for the next full hour when I was in that no other pyramid rocks came up I still got on my desk today but what but what that's a revelation those what what I was in my low spot I was in a low valley and I said a little prayer Lord and my bride and he's he's the master rock tumbler Revelation Tumblr he says here's a revelation for you here's the Revelation for you here's the Revelation all these other rocks he said but these Revelations for you we're right there hey man you got lonely just pray to God Amen he'll show you he'll show you who you are in his eyes amen you will be what the Apple remember the Old Testament were his the Old Testament were friends and service but what he says you are my bride you are the very wife of God you know why that judgment hits Great Tribulation because for 2000 years churches have tried to get the Holy Ghost in a way and right at the end Ace a church individuals will find the Holy Ghost in such a way and when that devil as the prophet God says tries to begin his cowardly plot to take out the very wife the Bride of Jesus Christ God says not this time buddy he comes down sweeps him up in the Rapture and then drops the judgments of God on them don't you ever touch God's his wife is what his anointed hey everybody because remember the same light that was in Jesus will be in you and of Christ was anointed you are anointed today man praise be to God continue on here I don't know Hollywood I like what the prophet says here somebody says I'll tell you what we need today is a is back to the old Bible again we hear the quotes we hear the quotes and those things are fantastic but let's bring these quotes back to the word I'll say it like this just a simple little study Hills and Valleys there's no quotes on Hills and Valleys by the prophet the Old Testament although they couldn't drive out there I couldn't find any Hills and Valleys a little bit I couldn't find it but what we go back to the Bible and we see what's hidden in there we see because remember you read the Old Testament you're reading about where you're at too the Old Testament is just as Rich if not more than the new I'm telling you brother Justice I mean just as a teacher I mean he can preach to teach I mean he got it all he's got the just run them Shadows run them types they're right there and it's beautiful every per every Old Testament Prophet every Old Testament man woman you can see the type right there from the Gentile wives in Christ the lineage all the way well to to the Kings and to the to the judges to the prophets all those things say shadow type the Christ and his bride yeah he says back to the old-fashioned Pentecostal teaching in the Bible he says back to the Holy Ghost back to the power of God back to all my prayer readings he says where they'd hunger and thirsting for God and I'll tell you what I say this humbly reverely but every time I come and teach here Pastor Jesse invites me to come teach you I walk in here this door right there and I walk in that door and I'm walking right here your pastor is praying right here I don't know if there's another Pastor in this message and when a guest Minister there he's at the altar praying through I say that to glorify Jesus Christ it struck me today when I walked in and I said is there another Pastor that does this he's praying through for God to speak to you that's a Watchman that's a shepherd I'm not trying to glorify that's one thing consistency determination determination amen so you know that's just something I noticed and really struck home tonight back to online prayer meetings back to where they're hungry and thirsting for God he was was Pastor just doing hungry and thirsting for God to move here in such a way greater the saints of God we should be going higher and higher and higher in the Holy Ghost there's coming a time or below a man's gonna be skipping before he gets into the church tell us toba's gonna be like this the skirt you know hey [Laughter] because the anointing of God is going to come and it will not leave the closer we get to God the closer we get with you and if you stay if you if if if you abide in me and I and you and you abide in my words ask what you will think about this if you're walking with Christ and the Holy Ghost and divine love because remember whatever God's will is will then become your will and you'll see one of those capitals wild cats run out in the back there and and Lydia's out here walking like this and just praising God and this and that one of them little cats is hurt wounded and the spirit of God sees that wounded creature and she'll wait and finally something say go and pray over you know raise it right up but what we have to weigh on the mind of God but the anointing will be there in such a way now let's continue on here I don't want to keep it all night here 's another Prophet said there would be a day it would not call day or night it would be a kind of a gloomy a dismal day he says we've had that kind of a day he's we've had a day in the last uh for the last 2000 years we've had meetings and accept Jesus as God's son and as our savior and we've seen God do great things among us has not gone done great things well the third time I went to Thailand I went to the biggest church in Thailand they call him the Billy Graham of Thailand he's had nine people of AIDS in fact the very day me and brother Randy were there his wife went over and prayed over blind lady and she received her sight like that not even don't even believe the message but they have the power of God in such a way the day I was there the pastor was like he's all he's an older gentleman he's like he's healed I was like what I said praise be to God brother he says now notice God's been doing great things among us he says and yet it's been a long time since that Pentecostal Light 2 000 years we made organizations built Big schools had systems he says when we find out in the seventh Church age we find out we've missed something there's something wrong we've gotten to a desert all the fruits has dried up that's what the Pentecostal Church did today she organized herself so tight till it's against one another until we found out that all the fruits was dried up we don't have no love peace Joy long suffering Fellowship like we ought to have we had the beginning the fruits have all dried up in the deserts now notice he says he's dealing with the seven days they're traveling from uh from Egypt on he says seven days without uh going without finding the real living God where you run off a little isms God gave Luther justification he run off with it easily gave Wesley sanctification he ran off Pentecostal people speak in tongues they run off with it God wants us to call wants to call us together in unity of power to bring back the fullness of the Holy Ghost into the church again and with all the spiritual gifts and operation in every local body because that is the pattern that was the book of Acts and I said I'll say like this do you realize us we're the we're the last bit that was started from a one Church Revival in the book of Acts that was a one Church local church 120 in that local church and it started the life and we are now offsprings of that but all it takes is one local church to get into that kind of a situation and that kind of a card and it's going to do something absolutely the promise is there he said well Jesus said he says I will restore and every Pastor is striving towards that brother Jesse's right here striving for that service after Services children pray you guys are afraid we're praying what for more of the Holy Ghost amen Lord reveal yourself just like you want to amen and Lord not my will but thine be done amen yes sure now he says you know everybody wants a Hilltop experience and they never want to take the man we love dancing this is absolutely but remember everything that produced everything that joy that satisfaction that freedom that Liberty that comes up and those things take that with you because of that growth that takes place that boldness that takes place here take those fruits of boldness and joy and peace and love and take it out there but a lot of times we get into those things and the fruits grow so fast because we're right there in the presence of God and what his remember those are necessarily our fruits those are fruits of the spirit those are here that's what pretty that's what he produces on us and if we take those out into the world oh my God but a lot of times if you stay up there too long the prophet God he says those fruits will freeze and you'll notice that when you the first hard time that comes along foreign because you're so angry and I'm not bringing I I when I heard brother Jesse's preaching about dancing I said Dad yeah get in the spirit and what take it out absolutely with you into the world absolutely yes absolutely let that what's produced right here let it let what are the fruits what are the fruits known for you know what they eat for you know what they eat and for breakfast in Thailand and for sweets in Thailand fruit because it's sweet people love being around someone who is happy joyful and kind sister I see you drop that no problem thank you forward people like to see someone who who actually is like is moved by just joy of the Holy Ghost and people go like what's wrong with him what's wrong with that sister over there he's really happy I was just on the job site and then watch this business lady you want to see this electrical company and he's got her nope full skirt dependent and the Pentecost about Toledo she's on the job site with her dad I said God bless you Sister she goes who are you I said I have

sisters it's okay to work out in the men's stuff I said well all right Lord women now so now notice he says well you know it's all right to be on the mount timepiece that's good he's but let me tell you your fruits will freeze up there at night he says when the cold spells bring you lose all your fruit he said that's what's happened now we've had too much Mountain Top experience uh dancing shaking no I'm not saying I want you to keep keep brother Jess praise the Lord you can never pray enough and I'll say like this if you pray enough the spirit of God and you'll always be praising God Amen I heard I heard a priest say one time he said Jesus sometimes you'll be out out in the world there and the Holy Ghost comes on you and he wants to embarrass you and he what if he says dance you're like Church of church praise you to God I think I saw Jessica like he he lists his knees or a high like this and Praises God do whatever the Holy Ghost leads you to lead to do be a witness absolutely what are they going to say hey like my old boss should say when someone messed me says like should go sigh there ain't nobody and I was like thanks Chuck and I was confidence in who I was confident what and who I was amen I'm a Christian praise God and we love our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen he's been too good I've been too quiet amen we need to let our voices our life live out amen God have mercy you guys pray for me I want to be more vibrant more in love with the Lord on the job site now when I walk on the job site I'm I'm smiling happy bless you absolutely but I want more more of an interaction and more I was like this more of these signs following that's what the Lord wants is what power and demonstration of the spirit of the Holy Ghost amen amen absolutely he says we've had too much instead of all night prayer I mean he's coming down the valley of decision notice the valley he says where you have to come down with them where you meet God and really pour your life until something takes place well I've already received the bachelor the Holy Ghost when was the last time you revealed Acts 2 38 Holy Ghost comes down oh Peter James John four days later after persecution let's pray and they had to get a refilling in four days of persecution and they said what let's pray for boldness God help me help us all yeah it's coming persecution's coming he says it he says and let that we've grown fruits up there he's about freeze kills it that's right every time it comes a cool spell he's got the you've got nothing to rest on well I've been baptized in this this but why is God allowing this saints of God he is faithful amen blessings don't mean God's with you and neither the hard times or tough times if you got extra money and you praise God if you don't praise God anyhow amen be happy in all things he says when the emotion or dies down he's the shout's all gone the noises ceases where are you at the Temptation comes along and you can't take it oh my God so whatever you get here now this is this is a place consecrated and set aside for and this is where we can we can literally separate ourselves from the world and focus on the Holy Ghost the word of God and we can come down and have a wonderful joyful time and at this time we grow right here and man look what he preached here look how that was wonderful listen this look at that Revelation oh my goodness it's so good praise be to God this brother was healed this sister was healed this this happened and then take it out there and then with something the Devil Comes attacks the very next day God's still good amen lord I can't wait to see what you're going to do to deliver me today because of stand on the word and watch God perform yes sir hey man let's stand here by God's grace I know

valley I am the Rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley [Laughter] when I remember the tough times I could still smell them amen I still see something beautiful amen the Bible says Solomon was not a raid like one of these amen he's still here and if he if he if he's the type of him grows in a valley and the flowers represented he represented the flower that flower represents him says to God if he can prosper if he can flourish there and bring forth a flower of beauty to those bees and give them life and the animals that come and smell to the little children the lady comes to the and picks the flowers and says oh it's so beautiful in this thanks for God any tough times he's right there just as I heard before just give him a chance just just wait on him [Music] what is the rapture chapter in Psalms 27 what what does he say wait I say on the Lord yay wait on the Lord watch him come down and solve the problem don't doubt say God's going to do something brother bam up there my wife just got

was the very next day God revealed to him hear the prophet Malachi 4 the seventh angel and his Bible's not working [Music] God allowed that to show that this day this scripture is fulfilled that had to be very embarrassing for the prophet of God or some you know he would say Lord this is your Bible that it's never failed before oh it's just a misprint no it wasn't God was hiding something spiritual had taken place right there amen less powerheads if you have prayer if you need a prayer thank you for playing if you need prayer for anything if you're going through a Valley today tonight whatever you're going through God knows all things yes he does say Lord you're still going to be a God in the valley you're still going to be a God in the Mountaintop but Lord God once we're through this shadow of the Valley of Death we're going we're going through once we get through this thing Lord God there's nothing but Shady Green Pastures for us after that but we've got to make it out this last little bit we've all got look at the look at the look at the atmosphere of everything we're on we're on the verge of this thing as they say if we're on the cusp past the time of no return here

was between the Israelites and Palestinians in America sided with Palestine right there that was the one thing I could find in 1956 he said America when you did that Grace because you always blessed in Israel you always bless God's people amen so if you need a prayer if you want to rededicate your life if this Joy you get from here Pastor Jesse's thing about dancing delivering praise and glorifying God and give all one and worship and all those sort of things that he is worthy of everything growing higher higher stronger and stronger going in the knowledge of God to the Holy Ghost that voice is going to get so clear going to what that song says we're going to get so close and it'll be no big change when I come he says he says I'll be just like him hey man see how close you're gonna get by the time of the Rapture what you're going to Christ is gonna appear and you're looking you're on yourself like we're the same How's that gonna happen he'll interpret his word when it comes but I'll tell you what it's going to come to pass amen let's just bow our heads god let's bow our heads for a prayer here dearly father Lord Jesus we love you Lord and Lord God we thank you for
