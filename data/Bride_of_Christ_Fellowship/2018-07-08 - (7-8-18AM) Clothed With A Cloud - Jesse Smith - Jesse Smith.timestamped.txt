[18:46] Valley Church it's where brother Donnie
[18:47] Reagan is pastor so let's pray for

[18:54] me know but praise the Lord we can just
[18:56] pray for traveling mercies for those
[18:58] people who don't see also there's a
[19:02] couple that's going through some real
[19:04] hard spiritual battles in Iowa let's
[19:09] just remember them in prayer
[19:10] Satan is really trying to tear their
[19:12] marriage apart well let's pray that God
[19:15] will intervene and restore hearts to the
[19:17] Word of God also brother Simon got home
[19:21] he gave me a left me a voicemail and he
[19:24] said they sold a lot of seed there but
[19:27] he said he's just praying now that to

[34:35] let's say on let's go to Revelation
[34:36] chapter 10 verse 1 I've had all my heart
[34:38] to preach on the cloud so like to preach
[34:41] on clothed with the cloud today by God's
[34:43] grace so let's look at that by the grace
[34:46] of the Lord or the Hosea was looking and
[34:50] I were talking about this for a while he
[34:51] was looking forward to hearing this but
[34:52] enough to hear it on the archive but
[34:55] praise God revelation 10 verse 1 tonight
[35:06] by God's grace at 4 o'clock we'll preach
[35:07] on the outreach service thus saith the
[35:09] Lord for the future dealing with
[35:11] prophecy about the mark of the beast
[35:14] United States Rome and the Vatican and
[35:17] assurance for Christians and advances in
[35:19] science with the driverless cars all
[35:21] that brother Branham prophesied we'll
[35:22] look at that tonight and hopefully some
[35:25] people come if not hopefully they'll
[35:26] listen to it online we have 81 views of
[35:29] last Sunday night's service so that
[35:32] encouraged me that's the most we don't
[35:33] have that many so thank God hopefully
[35:36] somebody's here in the Word of God and
[35:37] they have a choice either accept it or
[35:39] reject it and hopefully someone will
[35:40] accept it and if so hopefully they'll
[35:42] let us know we really like to provide a
[35:45] home Church for people in this area who
[35:47] are hungry for the Word of God amen so
[35:50] Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 we'll just
[35:57] look at this
[35:58] verse you know we know most of other
[36:01] Rams ministry or his ministries emphasis
[36:04] I'm sorry emphasized in Chapter seven we
[36:07] know that but I believe revelation 10
[36:09] verse one was fulfilled in February
[36:12] March of 1963 that's just my opinion
[36:15] by God's grace so I like to explain why
[36:18] today revelation 10 verse 1 if you're
[36:20] there say Amen let's read this together
[36:22] on three one two three and I saw another
[36:25] mighty angel come down from heaven
[36:27] clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was
[36:31] upon his head and his face was as it
[36:34] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[36:37] fire let's just bow our heads in a word
[36:40] of Prayer Heavenly Father I thank you
[36:42] for your mercy and grace we thank you
[36:43] for this gathering we're gathered here
[36:45] in the name of Jesus Christ we know the
[36:48] scripture revelation 10:1 is injustice
[36:49] inspired as John 3:16 hallelujah and
[36:53] Hebrews 13:8 Lord so we thank you for
[36:56] this word that we've read break it to
[36:57] our hearts and father to strengthen us
[36:59] encourage us in thy word today mate
[37:01] today your word be truly spoken Lord and
[37:05] father may hearts hear the message today
[37:07] Lord especially this evening that I've
[37:08] never heard it before that you might be
[37:10] glorified and draw all men unto you in
[37:13] Jesus Christ's name and the church said
[37:15] Amen god bless she's been seated praise
[37:17] the Lord so you can switch over Malachi
[37:21] when you're ready by God's grace as we
[37:26] get into the cloud here sister Connie
[37:30] the friend her friend gave me that
[37:32] magazine from 1963 so if you want to see
[37:34] original copy thank the Lord I got one I
[37:36] tried to buy one one time there's like a
[37:39] hundred some dollars I'm like I just
[37:40] can't I got five kids or six kids I
[37:42] can't buy it but thank the Lord for
[37:44] whoever whoever purchased that for me I
[37:46] really appreciate it was that Bruce or
[37:48] bill further bill okay yep I remember
[37:51] brother bill was sitting right there so
[37:52] may the Lord bless brother bill praise
[37:56] God so let's look at this thought here
[37:59] by the grace of the Lord
[38:02] I'm going to I got you know how many
[38:07] vert I got you know like 75 slides on
[38:09] this okay so it I don't think it'll take
[38:12] too long I'm gonna set a time or two by
[38:14] the grace of the Lord and okay here we
[38:21] go so let's look at this here our text
[38:23] was of course revelation 10 verse 1 I
[38:25] believe this is Scripture that's already
[38:29] fulfilled I preached that numerous times
[38:31] and brother Branham did say revelation
[38:33] 10 1 to 7 is history he did say that in
[38:36] what is the attraction on the mountain
[38:37] in 1965 I don't have that quote for you
[38:41] to see but I could easily find it if
[38:42] you'd like to see that so the reason I'm
[38:45] preaching this is just kind of as an
[38:46] introduction on 2012 you know some of
[38:50] the people left the message prominent
[38:52] people and they started a website well
[38:54] they kept their website going believe
[38:56] the sign but they changed it to going
[38:58] against brother Branham so in 2012 and
[39:02] so one of the one of the main things
[39:04] that got them to leave the message was
[39:06] the the the cloud they didn't believe it
[39:08] was of God anymore so just to give you a
[39:11] background for those you don't know it
[39:12] around sunset on February 28 1963 a
[39:16] mysterious cloud was photographed near
[39:18] Flagstaff Arizona and actually it was
[39:21] photographed over 80 times according to
[39:24] this article in it remains sunlit for 28
[39:28] minutes after sunset so the every the
[39:32] Sun was already down but then there's
[39:33] cloud appeared for 28 minutes the cloud
[39:37] was highlighted in the may 1963 edition
[39:40] of Life magazine that's what I got right
[39:42] here
[39:43] the mae-mae Life magazine also science
[39:47] magazine and weather wise magazine
[39:50] covered it in June of 63 and I think it
[39:53] was December of 63 I don't have copies
[39:55] of those but you can find scanned copies
[39:58] online all three magazines were amazed
[40:02] because the clouds seem to have formed
[40:03] above the normal height at which clouds
[40:07] can form so they're saying how could
[40:09] this happen these scientists didn't know
[40:12] how this can happen how could a cloud
[40:13] form at a hundred I think
[40:15] one hundred and forty four thousand feet
[40:17] how could a cloud form his clouds don't
[40:19] form that high that's why planes fly
[40:21] above that height so brother branham
[40:25] mentioned the life magazine one month
[40:28] after its publication in June of 1963 in
[40:33] the message standing in the gap he
[40:37] connected the cloud to his vision of the
[40:39] seven angel pyramid that he'd already
[40:42] shared with Brenham tabernacle in
[40:44] December of 1962 and so critics say
[40:48] these people that left the message
[40:50] they say the cloud was not from God and
[40:54] can be explained through natural events
[40:57] and so they've come up with all these
[40:59] ideas you know even about the pillar of
[41:01] fire picture from 1950 and and the
[41:03] pictures of where there's a the hood of
[41:05] death over a woman and all the pictures
[41:08] with brother Branham with you know the
[41:09] pillar of fire they've come up with
[41:10] reasons all these are not true and what
[41:14] it comes down to it's their opinion
[41:16] against the Prophet that's what it comes
[41:19] down to it's their opinion against our
[41:21] opinion they cannot prove any of their
[41:24] claims and ultimately all of our proofs
[41:26] go back to the Bible because the Bible
[41:29] will prove who was what is the truth of
[41:31] today what the message of today is and
[41:34] who's today who's today's messenger is
[41:36] the Bible will ultimately prove that so
[41:39] I'm putting my opinion with God's
[41:41] prophets amen because I know he preached
[41:44] thus saith the Lord I know that it's
[41:46] been revealed to me the Heavenly Father
[41:47] has revealed that to me so I thank God
[41:50] for that
[41:50] now followers of brother Branham know
[41:54] that he foretold a vision of and I quote
[41:58] snow white angels in the form of a
[42:02] pyramid in December of 1962 about two
[42:05] months before the February 1963 photo so
[42:11] we know it was prophesied of because a
[42:13] vision is prophetic a vision is from the
[42:16] Lord so we know it's prophetic now
[42:20] here's what I believe just so you know I
[42:23] believe the cloud was a supernatural
[42:27] manifestation of Jesus Christ
[42:29] I believe the cloud was formed by seven
[42:32] angels and I believe the cloud fulfilled
[42:35] Revelation 10:1 which led to the
[42:38] fulfilling of Revelation ten seven
[42:40] within the same month that's what I
[42:43] believe because you're gonna see the
[42:45] cloud had to have appeared at least
[42:46] twice it hadn't appeared in February and
[42:48] then according to brother Graham's own
[42:50] calendar and the dates he preached he
[42:52] would have seen the cloud March 8th or
[42:54] March 7th I believe March 8th so I
[42:57] believe the cloud God showed the cloud
[42:59] twice once publicly and then once
[43:01] privately and so I'll prove that here in
[43:04] the next few moments by God's grace now
[43:06] here's the literal things brother
[43:08] Branham said that are literal quotes so
[43:10] in December of 62 brother BAM said a
[43:12] pyramid like these messengers mighty
[43:15] ones great power powerful angels snow
[43:19] white okay snow white remember he calls
[43:22] it snow white angels in the form of a
[43:24] pyramid this is month two months before
[43:27] it happened he said I saw seven angels
[43:30] in the form of a pyramid yeah this is in
[43:33] 63 I'm sorry yeah of June that was the
[43:35] standing in the gap message and then he
[43:37] said seven angels represent in there so
[43:40] brother BAM says the angels were
[43:42] representing Christ the angels
[43:45] represented Christ so it was angels
[43:47] revealing Christ that's why I said it's
[43:49] a manifestation of Jesus Christ amen
[43:55] brother BAM said there he is two years
[43:57] later in 1965 he said there he is
[44:00] standing there the supreme judge there's
[44:03] a manifestation of Christ two months
[44:06] after that in July of 65 and that
[44:08] turning sideways in this picture there
[44:11] he is
[44:11] he is supreme authority so you got to
[44:14] take the picture and you got to turn it
[44:15] sideways he said right before he died a
[44:19] month before he died he said you see
[44:21] what it is it's Hoffman's head of Christ
[44:22] at 33 and he's wigged with that white
[44:26] angel wig to show that the message of
[44:28] him being God is the truth
[44:31] amen go hurry all right
[44:35] now I just put this one up here from the
[44:36] third axis I like this he said there it
[44:38] is they don't know what it's all about
[44:39] and scientists are trying to
[44:42] anybody got a picture of it called in a
[44:45] cloud 26 miles high in the shape of a
[44:48] pyramid seven angels represent in their
[44:51] brought back and brought you the Word of
[44:54] God under the inspiration so he tells us
[44:57] the whole point of the cloud was to give
[45:00] brother Branham a supernatural
[45:01] Commission to go back east and open up
[45:04] the seven seals amen
[45:06] he said under the inspiration it tells
[45:09] you these hours that you're coming and
[45:11] living in the spiritual mind we'll pick
[45:13] it up right now see and get it it's an
[45:16] exodus we're going to leave one of these
[45:19] days thanks be to God
[45:21] and remember at Israel's first Exodus
[45:25] God came down in the cloud and met with
[45:27] Moses let me know that that was at the
[45:30] first Exodus so here at the third axis
[45:33] we have it again God coming down in a
[45:35] cloud to meet with this prophet before
[45:37] the third Exodus amen
[45:39] I believe that now let's understand the
[45:43] criticism of the cloud so if anybody
[45:47] tries to criticize you know you you have
[45:50] an understanding you can refer to this
[45:52] sermon and I've always loved doing this
[45:55] I've always loved doing apologetics in
[45:57] other words they're proving how the
[45:59] critics are wrong whether it's about
[46:01] Jesus's resurrection Jesus's death on
[46:04] the cross or whether it's doctor and
[46:06] I've always loved these type of things
[46:08] so it doesn't bother me to go listen to
[46:10] people try to come against brother
[46:13] Branham it doesn't bother me it doesn't
[46:15] sway my faith I enjoy it if it bothers
[46:18] you stay a million miles away from it
[46:20] because when there's doubt in your heart
[46:22] then there's not faith right and we've
[46:24] got to serve God with faith amen not
[46:27] everybody's built for that we know that
[46:29] but everybody is built to have an answer
[46:32] for the hope that we have within us and
[46:34] the church said so you should have some
[46:36] type of answer what about the cloud and
[46:38] see you at the end of this you can say
[46:40] an answer that you can say and it will
[46:44] be something like this
[46:45] you can say well the scientists have
[46:47] never approved what it is and the other
[46:49] side can't prove it was a thaw rocket so
[46:52] we believe it's a supernatural
[46:54] vindication of God opening the seven
[46:56] seals
[46:56] or you can just say we believe it's
[46:58] revelation ten one fulfilled because we
[47:01] know revelation ten seven the mystery of
[47:04] God has been finished amen
[47:06] we know that and no one can take that
[47:08] away from us we know all the New
[47:10] Testament mysteries have been finished
[47:12] they've been proved to be right in the
[47:14] Bible and God has revealed them to his
[47:16] people amen
[47:18] so let's understand the criticism so
[47:20] what I do is I go listen you know now
[47:22] they believe the sign group now they
[47:24] don't have a you they stop their YouTube
[47:25] page and now they do a blog and they do
[47:29] monthly recordings now so I just go and
[47:31] listen to what they say and I write down
[47:33] their ideas and and then and then I show
[47:36] how they're wrong or how we disagree
[47:38] with them now don't think this is wasted
[47:40] our time Church it's not what if you
[47:43] were living in the days of Paul and Paul
[47:45] said all of Asia has rejected me what if
[47:49] a whole company rejected the prophet of
[47:51] the hour and you were one of the ones
[47:53] who still believed it wouldn't you want
[47:54] to stand up for Paul wouldn't you want
[47:57] to stand up for brother Branham what you
[47:59] want to stand up for John the Baptist
[48:01] this is not a waste of our time
[48:02] this is us taking our side with God's
[48:05] prophet to this day and it's also
[48:08] contending that the scripture has been
[48:10] fulfilled we're trying to point people
[48:12] that the scriptures and the prophecy of
[48:14] revelation 10 7 and 10 1 through 7 are
[48:17] fulfilled and you and I are to finish
[48:19] the rest of the chapter named ahead
[48:20] that's what it's supposed to be for
[48:22] praise God
[48:23] I like how Lily's clapping they're a
[48:24] team and Lily I believe you believe
[48:26] that's true amen
[48:27] I believe with all my heart amen
[48:32] like the other day I think it was virtue
[48:35] is singing your love defends me really
[48:38] loud and then send a man after we read
[48:40] the text I like that let's get the
[48:42] children saying amen let's get them
[48:43] clapping and singing this is the truth
[48:46] of God amen
[48:47] we are surrounding the unadulterated
[48:50] Bible truth of God and we're happy to do
[48:52] it no matter who falls away we're happy
[48:54] to stand on the word of God
[48:56] so here are four criticisms from that
[49:00] group that's left there called believe
[49:01] the signs seeking the truth whatever you
[49:03] want to call them here's the four
[49:06] criticism first they say there was no
[49:09] prophecy
[49:10] the cloud and the details changed second
[49:14] they criticize and say the timing was
[49:17] wrong the cloud was photographed eight
[49:19] days before brother Branham was in
[49:22] Arizona the third criticism is the on
[49:25] the location they say the cloud was
[49:27] photographed 200 miles from where
[49:29] brother Branham was hunting and also
[49:32] that it was eight days after the
[49:34] photograph was taken and we'll go
[49:37] through each one so you have to write
[49:38] these down unless you want to or I can
[49:41] you know text you the oricon PDP dia or
[49:44] send you the PDF file if you like this
[49:45] powerpoint here and their fourth
[49:47] criticism is on the origin they claim
[49:50] the cloud was caused by a thor rocket
[49:52] and was not sent from God so we'll go
[49:57] through all these criticisms here's the
[49:58] source of the people believe the sign
[50:00] now they call themselves they're off the
[50:02] shelf and they're kind of mocking
[50:04] brother branham mother brother Bram said
[50:05] if you don't understand something put it
[50:06] on the shelf and so they're saying we're
[50:08] taking these thing all these things
[50:09] you'd understand taking them off the
[50:11] shelf and showing how brother Bram is
[50:12] not a prophet but he is a prophet I
[50:15] don't care what they say the word proves
[50:17] he's a prophet and now a lot of my
[50:20] things I'm going to show you is from the
[50:22] sermon that brother Chad lamb preached
[50:24] on August 8th 2014 he did a tremendous
[50:27] job of showing a lot of connections
[50:30] between the cloud and Scripture
[50:32] now if you want to know all the
[50:34] connections from the numbers he did a
[50:37] good study on the numbers and the
[50:39] numerix of the cloud then you need to
[50:42] watch that but it's like a
[50:43] two-and-a-half hour sermon it's a long
[50:45] sermon and I'm not going to preach much
[50:47] on that the numerous or the numeric
[50:49] parts of it I'm not going to preach much
[50:51] on that I'm going to answer those four
[50:53] criticisms and show you how it was from
[50:55] God but if you want a long teaching for
[50:58] example on February 28th the photograph
[51:02] was taken and it was seen for 28 minutes
[51:04] so brother Chad will take that number 28
[51:07] and he'll show it all through the Bible
[51:09] how life you know life came on the 28th
[51:12] in Matthew 28 Jesus was resurrected acts
[51:18] 28
[51:19] yeah Acts chapter 28 is the chapter
[51:22] where Paul he has some life
[51:24] life spreads I forget exact but life
[51:28] spreads through his ministry of opening
[51:30] he rented out a you were in that
[51:31] apartment and he brought people in and
[51:33] it was life to that area God started
[51:35] Church in that area Joel 2:28 was the
[51:38] prophecy of the Holy Ghost falling and
[51:39] the 28th speaks of life so and then the
[51:43] woman has a cycle of twenty eight days
[51:45] in 28 days she brings forth life so if
[51:48] you want to know all the Bible types of
[51:51] the number 28 and the number two and all
[51:54] the numbers you can listen to that but I
[51:56] didn't have time to go through that I
[51:57] just want to answer these four
[51:59] criticisms and show how they're wrong
[52:01] and you know when it comes down to it we
[52:03] just stand with the Word of God you know
[52:05] we're gonna stand with God's messenger
[52:06] who preached us say at the Lord but we
[52:09] do have all the answers to I believe I
[52:11] believe they're misunderstood so let's
[52:14] look at the first criticism the first
[52:16] criticism is there was no prophecy so
[52:19] they say there was no prophecy about the
[52:21] cloud but I say there was prophecy and
[52:26] I'm going to show you in the next few
[52:27] slides here now let me show what is let
[52:30] me say what is true though it is true
[52:32] brother Branham never said cloud before
[52:35] June 1919 1963 so that's what they say
[52:40] well brother Graham didn't call it a
[52:41] cloud in sirs as this the end time but
[52:45] he did say snow why angels and pyramid
[52:48] before February and June he said that in
[52:51] December of 1962 so they say oh brother
[52:54] I've never said cloud that's true he
[52:56] never said cloud but he said a snow
[52:58] white constellation of seven angels so
[53:02] you can't say that he didn't prophesy of
[53:04] something snow white in the in the in
[53:06] the heavens that was a pyramid of angels
[53:09] so see how slick Satan is there to try
[53:11] to get people to doubt now more about
[53:14] this also a vision is by definition
[53:18] prophetic let me know that just as
[53:21] Balaam's vision or trance about a star
[53:25] of Jacob it was a vision and also
[53:27] prophetic and member bheyl him was a man
[53:30] who went to hell yet he had a vision he
[53:32] fell into a trance and he saw a star
[53:33] Jacob and he just said I see a star
[53:36] Jacob he didn't say thus saith the Lord
[53:38] will be
[53:38] the Messiah he didn't say that he just
[53:40] said I see a star rising out of Jacob
[53:42] and then you know a thousand or 1500
[53:45] years later you know the wise men see a
[53:48] star rise out of Jacob and they say
[53:50] that's the Messiah so see the vision is
[53:54] by nature by supernatural nature
[53:56] prophetic and so brother man's vision
[53:59] was prophetic how many understand and
[54:03] here's what I want you to know it was
[54:04] prophetic brother Branham said in the
[54:06] name of the Lord after selling the
[54:09] vision in December he said in the name
[54:11] of the Lord something's going to happen
[54:13] so he finishes telling his vision and
[54:16] then he talks about how this vision is
[54:19] to vindicate that there will be a
[54:20] seventh church age messenger and then he
[54:23] says in the name of the Lord something's
[54:24] gonna happen and then it was fulfilled
[54:26] within two and three months it was
[54:28] fulfilled alright now here's another
[54:31] criticism so was the prophetic yes it
[54:34] was prophetic because it was a vision
[54:37] they say well the details changed of the
[54:41] vision now brother Ram said critics oh
[54:42] no I'm sorry the critics say the first
[54:45] time brother branham's share this vision
[54:47] and reproach for the cause of the word
[54:49] brother Adam said he saw five angels a
[54:52] week later he said five to seven and
[54:55] then six months later he just said seven
[54:57] now that is true that part is true
[54:59] brother Branham the details did change
[55:02] brother Branham said he could not but
[55:04] this is why it's because he could not
[55:06] make out all the details because it
[55:08] happened so fast and remember brother
[55:11] Branham never said thus saith the Lord
[55:12] about the number of angels okay and
[55:15] here's why so the first time he tells it
[55:18] he just says five and then a week later
[55:20] he said maybe five to seven and then
[55:22] after it happened he said seven so
[55:25] people will criticize that but to me
[55:27] that doesn't shake my faith at all
[55:28] because he tells you he said I didn't
[55:31] have time to count
[55:32] he tells us he said it happened so fast
[55:35] those angels with the shaitaan' back
[55:38] wings traveling faster than the sound
[55:41] could travel they come from eternity in
[55:44] a split twinkling of an eye not enough
[55:46] to bat your eye just a twinkle there
[55:48] they were I didn't have time to count
[55:51] I didn't have no more than just look
[55:55] mighty ones great powerful angels snow
[55:57] white a wing set in heads and there they
[56:01] were whoo-whoo and when it did I was
[56:03] caught up in this pyramid eight
[56:04] constellations so brother Adam tells us
[56:07] he did not have time to count so just
[56:09] like like you would like I would we
[56:11] would just guess and say well maybe
[56:12] there was five and week later five to
[56:14] seven this doesn't prove him to be wrong
[56:18] because he never said thus saith the
[56:20] Lord there's five or thus the Lord there
[56:22] was only six or he never said that so it
[56:24] doesn't prove anything wrong it's ever
[56:27] understand now let's go to the number
[56:32] two so the prophecy I believe is is
[56:34] plain they're wrong about prophecy
[56:37] brother Branham had a vision of it he
[56:39] said it was snow white angels and he
[56:41] said it would form in the as a pyramid
[56:44] constellation in the sky and it happened
[56:47] and the church said it happened it was
[56:49] prophetic
[56:50] the second criticism they say is timing
[56:53] they say brother Branham said he was
[56:55] caught up in the cloud when it appeared
[56:57] on February 28th but there's no proof
[56:59] that he was I'm sorry but there is proof
[57:01] that he was in Texas not Arizona on
[57:03] February 28 1963
[57:06] now here's my response but I respond
[57:10] brother branham's was caught up in the
[57:13] cloud but he never said it was in
[57:16] Arizona on February 28th so brother
[57:19] Branham was misunderstood okay so here's
[57:24] the actual timeline if you get you and
[57:25] you can go study there's all kinds of
[57:27] things you can study online the cloud
[57:29] actually appeared twice it first showed
[57:32] up on February 28th near Flagstaff in
[57:36] the evening brother Branham was not in
[57:39] Arizona during this time he was in
[57:41] Jeffersonville on February 28th on March
[57:45] 4th brother Branham preached in Texas
[57:47] because he was there he was pleading for
[57:49] the life of two teenagers that had
[57:52] murdered somebody to try to get them off
[57:54] the death sentence which God honored and
[57:56] they got a life sentence so he was
[57:58] trying to save life and he says in this
[58:02] sermon he says I'm driving back he said
[58:04] to
[58:05] tonight after the service he preached on
[58:07] a Sunday night service he preached the
[58:08] absolute and so he drove that night he
[58:11] probably got there on March 6 into
[58:13] Tucson and then he drove about 200 miles
[58:16] into the desert and then he either got
[58:19] his game on the seventh or eighth of
[58:21] March with gene Norman and Robert Roy
[58:24] Roberson okay so the timing there
[58:29] they're wrong there they're saying that
[58:31] brother Branham said I saw on February
[58:33] 28th brother Ram never said I saw it on
[58:35] February 28th he just connects that
[58:38] cloud and he said I was caught up into
[58:40] that cloud but they're adding that it
[58:42] was February 28th the brother Brad never
[58:44] said it was February 28th so see they're
[58:46] misunderstanding brother branham so
[58:50] there's the timing even where brother
[58:52] branham's daughter in 1992 wrote an
[58:54] article and the only believe only
[58:57] believed magazine that brother branham's
[58:59] hunting trip March 6 to March 8 March 8
[59:02] even she says that so brother Branham
[59:04] was there and he had this experience
[59:06] either March 7th or 8th but that doesn't
[59:11] throw off anything about it it doesn't
[59:13] throw anything off about it cuz brother
[59:14] Brown never said thus saith the Lord I
[59:15] was there on February 28th he never said
[59:17] that he just said they took a picture of
[59:19] it and I was caught up into that and
[59:21] then they add we'll see he's saying he
[59:24] was there on February 8th brother
[59:25] Branham wasn't saying that you've got to
[59:27] be very careful not to add or take
[59:29] anything away even from what people say
[59:31] right okay so here is the next thing
[59:35] they say brother Branham was caught up
[59:37] in the cloud when it appeared on
[59:38] February 28th but there's proof he was
[59:40] in Texas not Arizona brother branham was
[59:43] caught up in the cloud on March 8th
[59:48] according to what his daughter says and
[59:51] Perry green says that when he was alive
[59:54] this does not contradict any part of the
[59:56] vision for the vision did not give a
[59:59] date the critics misunderstand the quote
[1:00:03] so hope you can understand that they're
[1:00:05] misunderstanding quotes and if you can
[1:00:07] show me any quote where brother Graham
[1:00:08] said I was there on February 8th I'll
[1:00:10] say I'm wrong but he never did people
[1:00:13] are just injecting their thoughts into
[1:00:16] this experience
[1:00:18] I want you to know this here after being
[1:00:22] caught up in the cloud on March 8th
[1:00:25] brother branham immediately drove back
[1:00:27] to Jeffersonville to preach the
[1:00:28] revelation of the seven seals as he was
[1:00:31] commissioned to do so by those seven
[1:00:32] angels and then he preached that March
[1:00:34] 17th to 24th so March 8th they had the
[1:00:38] experience he must have come back to
[1:00:40] Tucson March 9th and then from there he
[1:00:42] immediately left came back to
[1:00:43] Jeffersonville for the meetings now
[1:00:48] here's what he said in standing the gap
[1:00:50] where the RAM said it happens to be at
[1:00:51] least one of these men as present this
[1:00:53] morning he was standing there when it
[1:00:55] happened when he was caught up in that
[1:00:56] constellation on March 8th it actually
[1:00:58] shook the rocks off the mountain and we
[1:01:01] find out that during the time I saw
[1:01:02] seven angels in the form of a pyramid
[1:01:04] that swept down and picked me up and I
[1:01:07] was brought each to open the seven seals
[1:01:10] for God now look what he says next if
[1:01:13] you haven't got them if Jesus Terry's
[1:01:15] eye he said my great-grandchildren
[1:01:18] little Paul children that he says if I
[1:01:20] if Jesus Terry's that will still be the
[1:01:22] eternal truth of the Living God and I
[1:01:25] challenge anybody show me something
[1:01:27] wrong with brother branham's
[1:01:28] interpretation of the seven seals you
[1:01:31] will not find a thing wrong with that
[1:01:32] I'm not saying every word in the sermon
[1:01:34] I'm saying the revelation behind that
[1:01:36] sermon because remember brother man I
[1:01:39] made a mistake he called it seven
[1:01:40] hundred that had not bowed the knees and
[1:01:42] he kept saying it over he kept getting
[1:01:44] it wrong so it's not every word but it's
[1:01:46] the revelations of those seven seals
[1:01:48] that was infallible amen
[1:01:51] because he said it with thus saith the
[1:01:52] Lord and it goes back to the Word of God
[1:01:55] and history it ties the whole Bible
[1:01:57] together it's exactly right now now I
[1:02:04] got the same words up here now here's
[1:02:07] where I would say further on the timing
[1:02:09] of this cloud the cloud must have been
[1:02:11] seen multiple times then because brother
[1:02:14] an was not in Arizona on February 28th
[1:02:16] they have proof for that and privately
[1:02:20] it must have been publicly then
[1:02:22] privately to brother Branham on March
[1:02:25] 8th 1963 of course the men that were
[1:02:28] there Roy and the other gentlemen they
[1:02:31] they heard the blast
[1:02:32] her new blasts go off but that would not
[1:02:35] contradict anything brother Bram said
[1:02:37] about the vision alright so there's the
[1:02:41] first two so prophecy and timing as for
[1:02:45] prophecy we know it was prophetic bro
[1:02:46] brother Branham foretold it two months
[1:02:48] in advance and said in the name of the
[1:02:50] Lord something's going to happen and we
[1:02:52] know the timing the timing is something
[1:02:54] we learn later the timing is that the
[1:02:56] the pillar or the cloud appeared twice
[1:02:58] February 28th and March 8th it appeared
[1:03:00] twice now let's go to the third one
[1:03:03] location so here's the what the critics
[1:03:07] say the critics say well brother Graham
[1:03:09] said the vision would take place in
[1:03:10] Tucson but according to the testimony
[1:03:13] took place about 196 miles away at
[1:03:16] rattlesnake Mesa which is also called
[1:03:19] sunset mountain but the actual name of
[1:03:22] it is rattlesnake Mesa according to
[1:03:24] Google Maps okay now here's what I'm
[1:03:29] saying the vision was only giving the
[1:03:32] general location there's no desert in
[1:03:37] the City of Tucson and the vision said
[1:03:40] that he'd be in a desert right so also
[1:03:46] on a global scale rattlesnake Mesa is
[1:03:49] very close to Tucson there's a picture
[1:03:51] for you from Google Maps here's where
[1:03:54] the vision took place
[1:03:56] rattlesnake Mesa or sunset mountain
[1:03:58] Tucson is a hundred forty I'm sorry
[1:04:01] hundred forty five miles away but look
[1:04:03] it's even closer if you go right through
[1:04:04] the desert so it's less maybe 120 130
[1:04:08] miles away so that's what the critics
[1:04:11] get all upset they get upset because
[1:04:12] brother branham in the vision said I was
[1:04:14] in Tucson so let's read it so you can
[1:04:16] see it here am said I was at Tucson
[1:04:20] Arizona in the vision for it made it so
[1:04:23] purpose that he didn't want me to fail
[1:04:25] to see where I was at I was picking a
[1:04:27] sanbir off of me from the desert so see
[1:04:31] you got to take the vision just showed
[1:04:33] him near Tucson and then the vision must
[1:04:35] have changed and showed him in a desert
[1:04:36] because he's in a desert picking a sand
[1:04:38] mer off his clothes and I said no no
[1:04:42] this is the vision I know that and I'm
[1:04:43] at Tucson and I know that they're little
[1:04:45] birds there
[1:04:46] represents something so see Church
[1:04:51] brother branham wasn't saying I had to
[1:04:52] be in the City of Tucson now brother
[1:04:56] Graham had the vision over here in
[1:04:58] Jeffersonville look how close
[1:05:01] rattlesnake fall or a rattlesnake Mesa
[1:05:04] is to Tucson Arizona is that close or
[1:05:07] far on a global scale that's very close
[1:05:11] so see critics will say well brother
[1:05:13] Graham said it had to be in Tucson
[1:05:14] brother Graham never said thus saith the
[1:05:16] Lord I was standing in the city he said
[1:05:18] I was in the desert and it was in near
[1:05:22] near Tucson so see that's a lot that's
[1:05:25] people being critical right so I hope
[1:05:29] you can understand that so the location
[1:05:31] to me when they when they criticize the
[1:05:33] location of brother Rams experience that
[1:05:36] doesn't that doesn't stumble me because
[1:05:38] on a on a global or even a national
[1:05:40] scale there are only about a hundred
[1:05:42] twenty some miles away and we know
[1:05:45] brother Ram from what he said he had to
[1:05:47] go to Tucson to before he could go up
[1:05:50] into the desert and have this experience
[1:05:52] so he was in Tucson then he went up to
[1:05:55] rattlesnake Mesa all right
[1:05:59] does everyone understand say Amen okay
[1:06:02] the fourth and final criticism is the
[1:06:05] origin and this is one of the most
[1:06:07] ridiculous that I've seen but I hope you
[1:06:11] can understand it the critics say the
[1:06:14] cloud originated as a result of a Thor
[1:06:17] rocket being detonated at forty four
[1:06:21] kilometres high or a hundred forty-four
[1:06:24] thousand feet On February 28 1963 it was
[1:06:29] launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base
[1:06:31] in California around 2 p.m. yeah this is
[1:06:36] where Chad lamb did a wonderful job by
[1:06:39] the grace of God to show how this could
[1:06:41] not have happened now first I still
[1:06:45] believe it was a supernatural cloud on
[1:06:46] February 28th then I believe God showed
[1:06:50] the same cloud privately to brother
[1:06:52] Branham on March 8th
[1:06:53] now here's what I respond Chad lamb
[1:06:56] wisely calculated that the cloud could
[1:06:59] not have been
[1:07:00] caused by the debris of a detonated Thor
[1:07:03] rocket all right man look at this now
[1:07:08] let me explain this
[1:07:10] here's Vandenberg Air Force Base and I
[1:07:13] just copied and pasted this from brother
[1:07:14] Chad sermon it's in California so the
[1:07:18] critics say the the Mill Air Force shot
[1:07:21] off of rocky here it exploded and then
[1:07:24] it traveled three hours and 48 minutes
[1:07:26] just because it had to appear here in
[1:07:29] Flagstaff at sunset so they said this
[1:07:31] cloud up above the clouds or this debris
[1:07:35] traveled 510 miles at a hundred
[1:07:38] thirty-five miles per hour and here's
[1:07:41] the proof here's the thing that proves
[1:07:43] it no one saw it for 510 miles no one
[1:07:48] saw this is that possible no that's
[1:07:53] impossible and here's why the cloud
[1:07:58] after it was seen here it was seen to be
[1:08:00] drifting and 80 people took at least 80
[1:08:03] people took a picture of it from here to
[1:08:05] here in only 28 minutes so for five
[1:08:09] hours they say this detonated rocket
[1:08:12] moved all across here and there's Los
[1:08:14] Angeles and here's some other big cities
[1:08:18] San Jose Jose I kept nines not saying
[1:08:20] those eight it's one of big cities in
[1:08:21] California so it traveled 510 miles not
[1:08:24] one person took a picture in five hours
[1:08:26] but yet for 28 minutes right here 80
[1:08:29] people took a picture of it are you
[1:08:30] kidding me
[1:08:31] that's impossible that's impossible
[1:08:35] and you're also telling me that when it
[1:08:37] exploded it never changed its shape for
[1:08:39] the whole time it never never changed
[1:08:42] shape it kept its shape for 510 miles
[1:08:44] and the ridiculous thing is this then
[1:08:47] once it started getting pictures taken
[1:08:49] of it now it suddenly changes direction
[1:08:52] so it goes at 135 miles per hour it goes
[1:08:56] northeast straight for five hours and
[1:08:59] ten minutes then all of a sudden for
[1:09:01] some reason it changes direction and
[1:09:03] goes southeast for only 28 minutes and
[1:09:06] 80 people photograph it so this is it's
[1:09:11] a scientific impossibility
[1:09:13] and to this day they still the
[1:09:15] scientists have never updated those
[1:09:17] writings they still don't know what it
[1:09:19] is
[1:09:20] they never release and said well we know
[1:09:22] what this was this was the Thor rocket
[1:09:23] they've never said that it remains a
[1:09:26] mystery to this day and it proves that
[1:09:29] God had this cloud here and he had it
[1:09:32] shown he was showing it in the heavens
[1:09:34] before he did something on earth amen
[1:09:36] that's right
[1:09:37] and that's exactly what happened and of
[1:09:41] course I'm open to anyone showing me any
[1:09:43] other proof or anything else like that
[1:09:44] but do you understand that no one saw
[1:09:46] for 510 miles and then thousands of
[1:09:49] people see it for 28 minutes 28 minutes
[1:09:52] not even half an hour and they get over
[1:09:55] 80 pictures sent to this doctor who
[1:09:56] studied it and that's how he calculated
[1:09:58] he was a he was he lives there in Tucson
[1:10:00] and he was a doctor his name's was James
[1:10:03] Patterson you can look up his obituary
[1:10:05] online and he was he was one of the he
[1:10:10] was the head of the University of
[1:10:11] studying clouds and everything and he
[1:10:13] got all these pictures and he he
[1:10:15] organized it by all of his trigonometry
[1:10:18] and he found it was fifty miles wide and
[1:10:20] thirty miles high this cloud which
[1:10:24] clouds can't be formed that high it's
[1:10:26] above where clouds can actually be
[1:10:28] formed and before he passed away you
[1:10:31] know he the last things he said about
[1:10:32] ESA's I don't know what it is science
[1:10:34] can't prove what this is amen now I'm
[1:10:38] not gonna play the Chad lamb audio I had
[1:10:40] about six minutes of him speaking but
[1:10:42] just for times sake I'm just gonna keep
[1:10:43] going by God's grace now Church this is
[1:10:47] not the first time God does this God
[1:10:50] lets the public experience supernatural
[1:10:52] things often remember in John 12 Jesus
[1:10:56] is on the earth and he said father
[1:10:58] glorify thy name and then he stops
[1:11:00] talking
[1:11:00] then came there a voice from heaven
[1:11:02] saying I both glorified it and will
[1:11:04] glorify it again the people therefore
[1:11:07] that stood by so there's people standing
[1:11:08] all around Jesus and all of a sudden
[1:11:10] they hear a voice they heard it and they
[1:11:13] said it thundered another said an angel
[1:11:16] spoke to him so the people just heard a
[1:11:19] thunder and then the other people say it
[1:11:22] was a angel it was not an angel it was
[1:11:24] God the Father but
[1:11:27] they didn't get the full experience they
[1:11:30] didn't have the revelation that Jesus
[1:11:31] had of it are you with me so they didn't
[1:11:36] get to experience all the supernatural
[1:11:38] that happened they were aware something
[1:11:39] supernatural is going around just like
[1:11:41] in Arizona in 63 they're aware something
[1:11:44] supernatural happened that's not a
[1:11:45] natural cloud but they didn't get the
[1:11:47] full benefit if they didn't follow God's
[1:11:49] prophet amen it's true in acts 9
[1:11:54] remember Pau is traveling to Damascus
[1:11:56] with all these soldiers to arrest
[1:11:58] Christians and the Bible said the light
[1:12:00] shone and knocked him off his horse and
[1:12:02] the Bible said the men that were with
[1:12:05] him stood speechless hearing a voice but
[1:12:07] seeing no man so they're just standing
[1:12:10] there they didn't get knocked down by
[1:12:12] the light just Paul did so something
[1:12:15] supernatural happens and that and they
[1:12:17] don't experience the whole benefit but
[1:12:20] something supernatural happened there
[1:12:21] and the public had to witness it amen
[1:12:26] they heard a voice but they saw no man
[1:12:29] that means Paul must have seen Jesus hey
[1:12:31] hallelujah he must have seen the pillar
[1:12:34] of fire there but they didn't see any
[1:12:37] man and did it affect them no the Bible
[1:12:41] never says that these people the Bible
[1:12:43] never tells us well they left Judaism
[1:12:45] and came into Christianity the Bible
[1:12:46] never says that so see God does public
[1:12:50] things often some people believe some
[1:12:53] people won't some people enjoy the full
[1:12:55] benefit of that experience other people
[1:12:57] just get a little part of it and you
[1:13:00] know this one after Jesus resurrection
[1:13:03] some of the eleven worship while others
[1:13:05] doubted some of his closest followers
[1:13:08] still doubted is this real or not there
[1:13:12] is that you can point to the nail scars
[1:13:14] in his hands and his problems with his
[1:13:15] glorified body and still some of those
[1:13:17] eleven are doubting and remember the
[1:13:20] Bible said he appeared to 500 people at
[1:13:21] once and some people doubted still
[1:13:25] supernatural
[1:13:26] can happen and some people will believe
[1:13:28] and some people will doubt you see how
[1:13:31] you and I cannot prove to anybody how
[1:13:33] real God is it takes their own
[1:13:35] revelation from God amen they've got to
[1:13:37] be ordained to eternal life amen they've
[1:13:40] got a lunch of love God they've gotta
[1:13:41] want to know God thank God then it was
[1:13:44] in your heart to want to know God in
[1:13:46] this hour amen that you can get all the
[1:13:49] benefit from these supernatural
[1:13:50] experiences not just when I heard a
[1:13:52] thunder one day or I heard a voice one
[1:13:54] day or heard of Angel one day and then
[1:13:55] your life doesn't change we're supposed
[1:13:57] to take these experiences and let Christ
[1:13:59] change our lives to be just like Jesus
[1:14:02] amen hallelujah and that's what's
[1:14:05] happened to me the message has come and
[1:14:06] literally transformed my life and it's
[1:14:09] still doing it today amen because God is
[1:14:11] forming us from glory to glory from
[1:14:13] faith to faith shining more unto a
[1:14:15] perfect day amen hallelujah
[1:14:19] so all these 80 people that took
[1:14:22] pictures of the cloud all these things
[1:14:23] they were just witnesses to what God was
[1:14:25] doing something supernatural did they
[1:14:27] gain the bait the full benefit of it
[1:14:29] probably not but all the elect will amen
[1:14:32] now I got a blank slide there I'm not
[1:14:34] sure why he got that it was just showing
[1:14:36] me my I was just showing me my pause
[1:14:39] there now let's read the where brother
[1:14:42] Graham foretold this vision now he told
[1:14:44] it a week earlier on the reproach for
[1:14:46] the cause but I'm gonna read the one
[1:14:47] from is this the sign of the end time
[1:14:49] sir brother man have said it must have
[1:14:52] been 10 o'clock in the day when my wife
[1:14:54] was trying to get into the room when it
[1:14:55] happened I went to vision that morning
[1:14:58] so this was actually December 22nd so
[1:15:01] this is a eight days earlier now
[1:15:04] remember it was not a dream now in this
[1:15:06] vision as I was speaking I looked and I
[1:15:08] saw a strange thing now it seemed like
[1:15:09] that my little son Joseph was by my side
[1:15:12] I was talking to him now if you'll watch
[1:15:14] the vision real close you'll see why
[1:15:15] Joseph was there and I still don't know
[1:15:16] why Joseph was there so I I gotta keep
[1:15:18] reading and I looked and there was a big
[1:15:21] Bush so brother MCS a big Bush on this
[1:15:23] bush in a constellation of birds little
[1:15:26] bitty birds about a half an inch long
[1:15:27] and half an inch high they were little
[1:15:29] veterans they're little feathers was
[1:15:31] beaten down there was about two or three
[1:15:34] on the top limb six or eight on the next
[1:15:36] limb and 15 or 20 on the next limb
[1:15:39] coming down in the
[1:15:41] of appearance oh he sees birds in the
[1:15:43] shape of a pyramid and those little
[1:15:45] fellas little messengers and they were
[1:15:46] pretty near well worn out and they were
[1:15:48] watching eastward so the birds are all
[1:15:51] looking nice for this pyramid is looking
[1:15:52] eastward and how was that Tucson Arizona
[1:15:55] in the vision already read this one to
[1:15:56] you
[1:15:57] for it made it so purpose that he didn't
[1:16:00] want me to fail to see where I was that
[1:16:01] I was picking up a sambar off me from
[1:16:03] the desert and I said now I know this is
[1:16:05] a vision and I know that I'm at Tucson
[1:16:07] and I know that them little birds there
[1:16:09] represent something and they were
[1:16:10] watching eastward and all of a sudden
[1:16:11] they taken a notion to fly and there
[1:16:13] they went eastward so this pyramid is
[1:16:16] made up of birds the birds fly east so
[1:16:19] notice there's birds in the shape of a
[1:16:20] pyramid which is reminding us or getting
[1:16:23] us to think of the angel consolation in
[1:16:25] the shape of the pyramid right it's
[1:16:27] preparing us to understand that and
[1:16:28] looking eastward brother Rams Commission
[1:16:31] was to return East to open the seven
[1:16:33] seals for God and he was in Tucson
[1:16:36] Arizona so the fulfillment of the vision
[1:16:37] took place in Arizona in March of
[1:16:40] nineteen sixty three so all these things
[1:16:42] are part of the vision and as soon as
[1:16:45] they left a constellation of larger
[1:16:47] birds came they look like doves sharp
[1:16:50] pointed wings kind of a gray color
[1:16:51] little lighter color than what these
[1:16:54] first little messengers was and they
[1:16:55] were coming eastward swiftly and no
[1:16:59] sooner than they got out of my sight so
[1:17:00] he sees three groups which looks like
[1:17:02] the three poles first Bowl second Bowl
[1:17:03] third Pole
[1:17:04] that's what it looks like to me I turned
[1:17:08] again to look less word so he turns
[1:17:09] westward and there had happened there
[1:17:11] was a blast that actually shook the
[1:17:14] holler so he's looking west which would
[1:17:16] be Arizona he's looking to Arizona and
[1:17:18] there's a blast in Arizona which
[1:17:20] happened we know on March 8th 1963 now
[1:17:23] don't miss it and you on tape be sure
[1:17:25] you get this right see how the other
[1:17:28] group didn't get it right they're adding
[1:17:29] things they're they're guessing at
[1:17:31] things they're trying to make it say
[1:17:32] something that it doesn't first a blast
[1:17:36] and then I thought it sounded like a
[1:17:38] sound bearer every what you call it when
[1:17:40] planes crossed the sound and when the
[1:17:42] sound comes back to the earth and just
[1:17:44] shook like roared everything and then it
[1:17:46] could have been a great clap of thunder
[1:17:47] and lightning like I didn't see the
[1:17:49] lightning I just heard that great blast
[1:17:50] that went forth that sounded like it was
[1:17:52] south from me tore
[1:17:54] Mexico but it shook the earth and when
[1:17:57] it did I was still looking westward and
[1:18:00] way off in eternity I saw consolation of
[1:18:02] something coming it looked like that it
[1:18:05] might have been little dots there could
[1:18:08] have been no less than five and not more
[1:18:10] than seven but there in the shape of a
[1:18:12] pyramid like these messengers coming and
[1:18:14] when it did the power of all madding me
[1:18:16] Almighty God lifted me up to meet them
[1:18:20] so Bob Arum says there was a blast first
[1:18:23] then he sees the angels and then he's
[1:18:25] lifted up into the vision or the
[1:18:26] constellation and I can see it it's
[1:18:29] never left me eight days is gone and I
[1:18:31] can't forget it I never had anything to
[1:18:33] bother me like this my family will tell
[1:18:34] you he said I could see those angels
[1:18:37] those shaped black wings this one I read
[1:18:40] earlier and I'll just skip down here
[1:18:43] powerful angels snow white and when it
[1:18:45] did I was caught up into this pyramid a
[1:18:47] constellation now you might think that's
[1:18:50] crazy
[1:18:51] that a prophet could get caught up by
[1:18:53] the Holy Spirit into a vision but if you
[1:18:56] think that's crazy you haven't read The
[1:18:58] Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel 3 moreover he
[1:19:02] said to me son of man all my words and I
[1:19:04] shall speak under knee receive in thy
[1:19:06] heart and herewith on ears and go get
[1:19:08] knee to them of the captivity under the
[1:19:09] children of thy people and speaking of
[1:19:10] them and tell them thus saith the Lord
[1:19:12] God whether they will hear whether they
[1:19:14] will forbear amen so God is going to
[1:19:17] send Ezekiel to his people in captivity
[1:19:20] and give them thus saith the LORD that's
[1:19:22] what God did through brother Branham
[1:19:24] amen God sent him to his people back to
[1:19:27] his people and gave him thus saith the
[1:19:28] LORD these are the revelations of the
[1:19:30] church Ages and the seven seals and God
[1:19:33] did it by vision Amen he foretold in a
[1:19:36] vision then the Spirit took me up
[1:19:39] where'd he go up but RAM said I was
[1:19:43] caught up into the constellation or that
[1:19:46] supernatural vision he said the spirit
[1:19:50] took me up and I heard behind me a voice
[1:19:52] of a great rushing say blessed be the
[1:19:54] glory of the Lord from this place he
[1:19:58] said and I heard the noise of the wings
[1:19:59] of the living creatures that touch one
[1:20:01] another and the noise of the wheels over
[1:20:03] against them and noise the great rushing
[1:20:04] so he's hearing the throne of God Amen
[1:20:07] so is he
[1:20:08] was actually caught up higher than
[1:20:09] brother branham brother brand was caught
[1:20:11] up into the sky with the constellation
[1:20:14] but Ezekiel was caught up to the throne
[1:20:16] of God amen the seventh of the third
[1:20:19] heaven the seventh dimension so is it is
[1:20:23] it too hard of a thing for God to lift
[1:20:24] up a prophet into the sky it's not at
[1:20:26] all I think about it you and I are gonna
[1:20:28] be lifted up in the sky in the rapture
[1:20:30] amen he lifts up just not one prophet
[1:20:33] he's gonna lift up the dead in Christ
[1:20:35] and those who are alive and remain it'll
[1:20:37] lift us up to the sky so easily by the
[1:20:39] power of the Holy Spirit the spirits
[1:20:41] gonna lift us up amen hallelujah they
[1:20:45] said no is anything too hard for God
[1:20:47] nothing so the spirit lifted me up and
[1:20:50] took me away and I was in bitterness in
[1:20:54] the heat of my spirit but the hand Lord
[1:20:56] was strong upon me so I'm feeling bitter
[1:20:59] I'm feeling awful but God's with me he's
[1:21:03] lifted up by vision then I came to them
[1:21:07] on the captivity of Tel Aviv that dwelt
[1:21:10] by the river Chebar and I sat where they
[1:21:12] said and remain there astonished among
[1:21:15] them seven days now if I read this right
[1:21:16] now let me know sister Wendy and sister
[1:21:18] Connie and brother William those and
[1:21:20] sister let me know this is wrong but
[1:21:23] this looks like the same thing that
[1:21:24] happened to Philip with the eunuch it
[1:21:27] looks like God took up Ezekiel's
[1:21:31] physical body from where he was and took
[1:21:33] him to the people of captivity in
[1:21:35] Babylon now people will say amen to that
[1:21:40] but people that doubt the message say O
[1:21:42] God could not lift a man just off the
[1:21:44] earth into the sky God does more than
[1:21:46] that God can easily do that God sent
[1:21:49] Jesus after Jesus died God sent him to
[1:21:51] hell and then he came up to the earth
[1:21:53] then he went up to heaven then he came
[1:21:54] back down to earth a man then 40 days
[1:21:56] later he went back up to the heavenly
[1:21:58] Father amen
[1:21:59] God's Spirit can send a body anywhere he
[1:22:01] wants and people get so critical all I
[1:22:05] would God call somebody up in the
[1:22:06] constellation why would God call it
[1:22:08] zekiel up into the heavens and move his
[1:22:10] physical body from Israel all the way to
[1:22:12] Babylon why would God do that because he
[1:22:14] wanted to give him thus saith the Lord
[1:22:16] amen and God has given us not saith the
[1:22:18] Lord amen
[1:22:20] that's why God and if
[1:22:22] listen the way of a true prophet that
[1:22:23] was a blessing to me BAM said Amos you
[1:22:26] know was there he's all dusty and he's
[1:22:27] all small man rejected he's not a great
[1:22:30] man he said how could a must walk in
[1:22:31] this beautiful Samaria and prophesy
[1:22:34] against it he said it's easy because he
[1:22:36] had thus saith the Lord when you God
[1:22:38] does say the Lord you don't fear any man
[1:22:40] or woman because you know you're
[1:22:41] standing with the word of the Lord very
[1:22:44] men so there God picks him up from
[1:22:50] Israel takes him east to Babylon and he
[1:22:53] sits by the river Chebar seven days and
[1:22:58] then he gets thus saith the Lord
[1:23:00] well come on Ezekiel you say you just
[1:23:02] had a rapture event here come on he's
[1:23:04] just had a translation give me thus
[1:23:06] saith the Lord
[1:23:06] you have to wait you think prophets can
[1:23:10] just come up with us saith the Lord
[1:23:11] whatever they want no you've gotta wait
[1:23:14] on God that ought to be a lesson to
[1:23:16] teach us to always wait upon the Lord
[1:23:19] God said I'm sending you to give him
[1:23:21] thus saith the Lord but it didn't happen
[1:23:22] right away he had to wait seven days
[1:23:24] kind of like Noah had to wait seven days
[1:23:26] to the rain started falling remember
[1:23:28] Abraham told that experience brother and
[1:23:30] said God shut the door the family's like
[1:23:32] okay he's gonna rain dad he's like just
[1:23:34] wait he said the next day the daughter's
[1:23:37] like that is gonna rain
[1:23:39] the next brother said it went on for six
[1:23:41] days and then programs just dramatized
[1:23:43] innocent and he said his wife came up
[1:23:45] and said honey are you sure it's gonna
[1:23:47] rain and brother ma'am dramatizes like
[1:23:49] Noah gets kind of upset he's like honey
[1:23:50] it's going to rain
[1:23:52] it's dust saith the Lord it's gonna rain
[1:23:54] amen and then the next day the clio that
[1:23:57] The Fountains of the deep break open and
[1:23:59] then the layer of water about the earth
[1:24:01] breaks open and it starts raining and
[1:24:03] there Nora can stand there and say I
[1:24:05] told you it was going to rain
[1:24:06] it was the say at the Lord we just need
[1:24:08] more patience and that's what we need
[1:24:10] today patience to wait upon the Lord
[1:24:12] amen that's what we need patience that's
[1:24:17] what they needed at Ezekiel in his day
[1:24:20] that's what needing brother Bram's day
[1:24:21] that's what they needed Noah's day
[1:24:22] that's what we need patience the wait
[1:24:23] upon the Lord now in Chapter eight not
[1:24:28] only does God lift up Ezekiel he carries
[1:24:31] him by his hair and his
[1:24:35] must have not ripped out came to pass in
[1:24:39] the sixth year in the six-month and the
[1:24:40] fifth day of the month as I sat in my
[1:24:41] house and the elders of Judah sat before
[1:24:46] me that the hand of the God fell upon me
[1:24:48] there and behold and lo in likeness as
[1:24:50] the appearance of fire so an angel that
[1:24:53] looks like fire from the appearance of
[1:24:54] his loins even downward fire and from
[1:24:57] his loins even upward his appearance of
[1:24:58] brightness as the color of amber oh my
[1:25:02] and he put forth the form of a hand so
[1:25:06] fire below and then amber light above
[1:25:09] and took me by the lock of mine head and
[1:25:13] the spirit lifted me up between the
[1:25:15] earth and the heaven just like brother
[1:25:16] branham right being lifted up between
[1:25:19] Earth and heaven brother and was lifted
[1:25:21] up into that constellation so I don't
[1:25:24] believe that well then you don't believe
[1:25:25] the Bible God lifts up men all the time
[1:25:28] amen and the spirit lifted me up between
[1:25:32] the earth and heaven and brought me in
[1:25:33] the visions of God to Jerusalem so his
[1:25:38] body stayed there but then the vision he
[1:25:41] went to Jerusalem if you know this
[1:25:42] chapter this is the chapter where God
[1:25:44] shows him the four abominations in the
[1:25:46] temple and the next chapter is where the
[1:25:48] writer with the ink or goes out and
[1:25:50] seals all those in the city who signed
[1:25:52] cry for the abominations
[1:25:53] so Ezekiel never left his house he went
[1:25:57] to the temple in the vision and how do
[1:26:01] we know whether Raider how do we know on
[1:26:02] March 4th
[1:26:03] I'm sorry how do we know on February
[1:26:05] 28th that brother Ram didn't get caught
[1:26:07] up in the vision in jeffersonville how
[1:26:09] do we know we don't know all we know is
[1:26:12] that science can't explain it and God
[1:26:14] sent a prophet to tell us what it was
[1:26:16] and the word vindicates that it was
[1:26:18] genuine experience from God amen we
[1:26:21] don't know because he stayed it's just
[1:26:24] like when brother man went all crossover
[1:26:26] between the curtain of time he saw his
[1:26:28] body stay there but he went to the sixth
[1:26:30] dimension the same things happening here
[1:26:32] his body stays there but he has this
[1:26:35] this celestial body that's glorified or
[1:26:38] this theophany body and the theophany
[1:26:40] body gets carried by the hair all the
[1:26:42] way to the temple here you go
[1:26:45] look how look how look how loving God is
[1:26:48] kind of mind you those lines how the
[1:26:49] carry their their their babies you know
[1:26:51] and with the skin of their neck and they
[1:26:52] never cut them it kind of it never hurts
[1:26:54] and that kind of reminds me of this the
[1:26:56] Holy Spirit lifts them up by his hair
[1:26:57] never hurts him just brings him right
[1:26:59] over lets him see the Bhama Nations
[1:27:01] brings him back a man could God lift up
[1:27:05] William Branham in a vision in a
[1:27:06] consolation without any problem at all
[1:27:09] that's clearly in the Bible
[1:27:12] remember Philip was with the eunuch and
[1:27:14] he was found that as a test which is 34
[1:27:18] miles away all of a sudden he's gone he
[1:27:22] banishes from after baptized in the
[1:27:24] eunuch and all of a sudden when next
[1:27:25] time he hears about him he was in a
[1:27:26] siddhis 34 miles away the Spirit of God
[1:27:30] lifted him up translated him right as a
[1:27:34] foretaste of glory divine
[1:27:37] and that's physically just like just
[1:27:40] like Ezekiel experience he physically
[1:27:43] rapture his body or translated his body
[1:27:45] and everything 34 miles away to do more
[1:27:47] work of the Lord hallelujah now here's
[1:27:51] now I injected those scriptures to show
[1:27:53] you if brother Graham said he was caught
[1:27:55] up in a vision in consolation I believe
[1:27:57] it because it's scriptural because I
[1:27:59] look at the fruits that it came after it
[1:28:01] the revelation of the seven seals
[1:28:03] now look I'm getting back to the same
[1:28:06] quote from services at the end time well
[1:28:08] it's been a terrific time since now you
[1:28:10] see where I stand I don't know what's
[1:28:11] happening I don't know what to say but
[1:28:13] now let me now from now on for the next
[1:28:16] about 15-20 minutes let me try to say
[1:28:18] something here now remember not one time
[1:28:19] has those visions ever failed did they
[1:28:22] fail no people just think they fail
[1:28:25] because they're inserting their own
[1:28:26] ideas the program never said those
[1:28:29] things and now I'm going to take the
[1:28:32] scriptures for a moment if you'll notice
[1:28:33] in Revelation the tenth chapter and now
[1:28:36] let me say this if the vision is
[1:28:37] scriptural it can only be interpreted by
[1:28:39] the scripture now that's just what I did
[1:28:42] for you I showed you how a God can lift
[1:28:44] up men he can he can leave their body
[1:28:46] there just lift up their theophanies or
[1:28:48] God can take their whole body and
[1:28:50] translate them all around the world
[1:28:51] because God is a great God amen
[1:28:53] he's all-powerful so every vision must
[1:28:57] be interpreted by Scripture now he takes
[1:29:00] the next few minutes well here let me uh
[1:29:03] he says now serves is this the sign of
[1:29:06] the end time where we live and what day
[1:29:07] is it as the weary wrestler through the
[1:29:09] night raising and turning on the clock
[1:29:11] to look and see what is turning up the
[1:29:12] light my prayer is God let us turn on
[1:29:15] the light I'm standing in an awful place
[1:29:17] if you knew it I'm sorry if you but knew
[1:29:21] it remember now here it is here's the
[1:29:23] prophecy right here brother damn did
[1:29:24] prophesy he said in the name of the Lord
[1:29:27] I've told you the truth
[1:29:29] something is fixing to happen and it
[1:29:31] happened two months later he tells the
[1:29:35] vision of being caught up and then the
[1:29:36] preach of the seven seals
[1:29:37] he says it's going to happen in the name
[1:29:40] of the Lord I don't know why now you
[1:29:42] want eight get that I don't know I'm
[1:29:44] going to try what came to me yesterday
[1:29:46] is sitting in my den room I don't know
[1:29:47] what I don't know I don't say that this
[1:29:50] is the truth it was only something
[1:29:51] moving in my heart where I've walked the
[1:29:53] floors now this is paragraph 241 so he
[1:29:57] took about twenty paragraphs and he
[1:30:00] teaches how the seventh church age
[1:30:03] messenger is the seventh angel of
[1:30:06] Revelation ten seven and then he shows
[1:30:09] all the mysteries that this messenger is
[1:30:12] to finish a man and I preached that
[1:30:15] sermon to you the 12 New Testament
[1:30:16] mysteries I preached that to you I
[1:30:18] mentioned it over and over again because
[1:30:20] brother Graham takes time after he says
[1:30:21] in the name of the Lord this is going to
[1:30:24] happen
[1:30:25] he takes all that time to show how the
[1:30:27] angel - leyla see in church is the
[1:30:29] seventh angel of revelation 10 7 now
[1:30:33] sounding for this messenger the seventh
[1:30:35] angel here is sounding forth his message
[1:30:37] to the latest in church notice this type
[1:30:39] of message now it wasn't the first angel
[1:30:41] wasn't given that second angel third 456
[1:30:43] but it's the seventh angel that had this
[1:30:45] type of message what is it notice his
[1:30:47] type of message finishing all the
[1:30:50] mysteries of God that are written in the
[1:30:52] book
[1:30:52] amen the seventh angels winding up all
[1:30:55] the mysteries is laying loose and it all
[1:30:57] out through these organizations and
[1:31:00] denominations the seventh angel gathers
[1:31:01] them up and finishes the entire mystery
[1:31:05] that's what the Bible said finishes the
[1:31:07] mystery of the written book and the
[1:31:08] church said so the whole point of this
[1:31:11] vision is to get you to see that God had
[1:31:13] to lift up a prophet
[1:31:14] give him a commission to go back in
[1:31:16] open the seven seals that all the
[1:31:18] mysteries of gods could be finished
[1:31:20] that revelation 10 1 through 7 could be
[1:31:22] finished that the bride can then finish
[1:31:24] the Great Commission after that Amen
[1:31:26] that's right
[1:31:28] and I'll say humbly that's what brother
[1:31:30] Craig is doing in Japan so brother
[1:31:31] Simon's trying to in Thailand they're
[1:31:33] trying to finish the Great Commission by
[1:31:35] going into nations that don't have the
[1:31:37] message because the Bible said every
[1:31:39] people tongue nation and kindred must
[1:31:41] hear the word of God then Jesus said the
[1:31:44] end will come so we are in the middle of
[1:31:47] that right now we're trying to finish
[1:31:49] the Great Commission
[1:31:50] but there's so few laborers amongst us
[1:31:52] so let us pray that God send laborers
[1:31:54] into the field now I want you to remind
[1:31:59] you again brother Branham said the
[1:32:01] opening of the seven seals was thus
[1:32:03] saith the Lord I wouldn't abbreviate
[1:32:04] this that's how I was abbreviated thus
[1:32:05] saith the LORD t T or T STL program says
[1:32:10] in trying to gather service notice what
[1:32:12] is it then what can be done what is to
[1:32:13] be done let's consult the prophet in the
[1:32:15] Bible where we cannot add to it or take
[1:32:17] from it if we do God takes us from the
[1:32:20] book of life he said the Bible said in
[1:32:21] Malachi 4 what would happen today
[1:32:23] revelations 10 how the seven seals would
[1:32:26] be opened so did you catch that
[1:32:29] that means the seven thunders were about
[1:32:32] the opening of the seven seals everyone
[1:32:34] understand that that's what he's saying
[1:32:37] here and the reveal all the mysteries
[1:32:40] that's been hid through these reformers
[1:32:41] he said how we've done it's in the Bible
[1:32:44] thus saith the Lord listen we're not
[1:32:48] just you know that we're not just taking
[1:32:50] or guessing this is thus saith the Lord
[1:32:52] God has completely perfect perfectly
[1:32:55] identified that and vindicated to be the
[1:32:56] truth by the signs wonders in the
[1:32:58] heavens in the skies and everything else
[1:33:00] for these 33 years amen
[1:33:03] now if you don't know that the seven
[1:33:05] thunders when brother Adam preached the
[1:33:08] first seal that was the first Thunder
[1:33:10] brother BAM said the seven thunders
[1:33:12] sounded out seven times right in a row
[1:33:13] the second seal was the second thunder
[1:33:15] third 456 all the way to the seventh God
[1:33:19] and then remember a revelry let's go
[1:33:20] back to Revelation 10 surin let's go to
[1:33:22] read back to revelation 10 I'm trying to
[1:33:25] help you see that revelation 10 one
[1:33:26] through seven has already happened
[1:33:34] verse one and I saw I got more on verse
[1:33:37] one later but let me get to this i saw
[1:33:39] another mighty angel come down from
[1:33:40] heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[1:33:42] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:33:44] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:33:47] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[1:33:51] little book open now what book was that
[1:33:52] that was the book of chapter 5
[1:33:54] Jesus everybody's crying there's nobody
[1:33:57] that can redeem us Jesus comes and takes
[1:33:59] the club's book and now the book is not
[1:34:01] closed anymore now it's open and it's
[1:34:03] brought down to earth
[1:34:05] alright he said and he set his right
[1:34:09] foot upon the sea and the left foot upon
[1:34:11] the earth and cried with a loud voice as
[1:34:13] when a lion roars and when he cried
[1:34:15] seven thunders uttered their voices now
[1:34:17] if you know Revelation I'm sorry if you
[1:34:19] know Amos 3:8 the Bible said that God
[1:34:21] roars through a prophet a lion is a
[1:34:25] prophet let me know that let me read it
[1:34:28] you stay there let me
[1:34:29] Amos 3:7 everything in here is
[1:34:32] scriptural John Amos Daniel Hosea Joel
[1:34:36] Amos bear with me here in a most 3/7
[1:34:48] we've been given a thoroughly vindicated
[1:34:51] message the Bible said surely the Lord
[1:34:53] God will do nothing but he reveals the
[1:34:54] secret under servants the prophets so he
[1:34:57] said God doesn't do anything except he
[1:34:59] tells the Prophet first verse 8 the lion
[1:35:02] hath roared who will not fear the Lord
[1:35:07] has spoken
[1:35:08] who can but prophesy so the Bible
[1:35:11] connects a roaring lion to a prophet
[1:35:14] who's prophesying and that's exactly
[1:35:16] what God has done in this day amen
[1:35:18] a roaring lion is always referring to a
[1:35:21] prophet who is prophesying amen so now
[1:35:26] you can understand verse 3 in Revelation
[1:35:28] 10 and cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:35:31] lion roars that means God was using a
[1:35:33] prophet to utter the secrets of God oh
[1:35:37] and when he had cried seven thunders
[1:35:39] under their voices amen
[1:35:42] and that was in March of 1963 all the
[1:35:46] books open right the seals are been
[1:35:47] loosed and the lion roars and seven
[1:35:50] thunders under their voices seven days
[1:35:52] in a row amen Oh hallelujah
[1:35:55] oh it's rich verse four when the seven
[1:35:59] thunders are their voices I was about to
[1:36:00] write and I heard a voice from heaven
[1:36:01] saying to me see up those things which
[1:36:04] the seven thunders uttered and write
[1:36:05] them not and the angel which I saw stand
[1:36:08] upon the scene upon the earth lifted up
[1:36:10] his hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:36:12] liveth for ever and ever who created
[1:36:13] heaven earth and the things that therein
[1:36:15] are and the earth and the things that
[1:36:16] therein are and the sea and the things
[1:36:18] that therein are that there should be
[1:36:20] time no longer now that word means delay
[1:36:24] the angel looks up and says there's
[1:36:26] going to be no more delay in other words
[1:36:27] these things are going to be done but in
[1:36:31] the day but in the days of the voice of
[1:36:33] the seventh angel when he should begin
[1:36:35] to sound the mystery of God should be
[1:36:37] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:36:39] servants the prophets amen so revelation
[1:36:43] 10 one two seven is fulfilled can
[1:36:45] everybody understand that that's the
[1:36:47] whole point of the cloud was to give
[1:36:49] brother Branham a commission to get the
[1:36:51] people ready for the third Exodus for
[1:36:52] the rapture day amen all right
[1:36:57] not only did brother Adam just talk
[1:37:00] about the Life magazine he talked about
[1:37:03] it but brother Branham first mentioned
[1:37:06] the Life magazine right here on the
[1:37:10] morning of June 23rd 1963 preaching
[1:37:13] standing in the gap at the end of a
[1:37:16] service a man named brother Wei passed
[1:37:18] out his wife a nurse died due to having
[1:37:23] no pulse and you could listen this on
[1:37:24] tape and brother Brandon's prayer after
[1:37:27] brother his prayer he came back to life
[1:37:29] and brother Graham couldn't feel a pulse
[1:37:30] either when he talks about it later that
[1:37:32] night so God raised someone from the
[1:37:37] dead at the end of that service in other
[1:37:39] words God brought life at the end of
[1:37:41] that service so see it seems God honored
[1:37:44] the article from Life magazine by
[1:37:46] showing how he can restore life amen
[1:37:50] program mentions the Life magazine the
[1:37:52] very first time you mentioned the Life
[1:37:54] magazine God shows up and
[1:37:56] back life to the people amen
[1:38:00] here's the here's where it happened beau
[1:38:02] Graham said let us pray now sister cries
[1:38:04] out you can hear it that's his wife
[1:38:05] someone faded just a minute since
[1:38:07] through everybody program leaves the
[1:38:09] pulping goes down the congee Heavenly
[1:38:11] Father let thy mercy and goodness be
[1:38:12] with brother Wei in the name of Jesus
[1:38:14] Christ may come back give him health
[1:38:16] I'll try to give him back Lord and give
[1:38:18] him strength in health so help me as
[1:38:20] heart starts beating again be still
[1:38:22] everybody and just pray there's my our
[1:38:27] Lord Jesus let thy goodness and mercy be
[1:38:30] with brother Wei in the name of Jesus
[1:38:31] Christ but ma'am sets over I stand here
[1:38:34] on this altar where funerals has been
[1:38:36] preached where I stand here were
[1:38:37] hundreds of people have prayed through
[1:38:38] to Christ I reached out his eyes was set
[1:38:41] his pulse was gone and no more than
[1:38:43] called the name of Jesus Christ and his
[1:38:45] paul started coming back again praise
[1:38:47] the Lord praise the Lord as a minister
[1:38:49] of the Cross I say that in the name of
[1:38:51] Jesus Christ amen
[1:38:55] isn't he wonderful a heart attack see
[1:38:58] I'm so thankful it happened just now
[1:39:00] instead of wait till we got away see the
[1:39:02] grace of God the Lord blessed now that
[1:39:05] night brother Aaron tell us a little
[1:39:06] more about it he said this morning I've
[1:39:08] seen our brother away sitting there
[1:39:09] right now but as he was sent right along
[1:39:11] there he was standing we were singing
[1:39:12] glory glory hallelujah shaking one
[1:39:14] another's hands I noticed him as it
[1:39:16] struck him his head went back he brother
[1:39:18] way isn't gonna like I'm sorry is given
[1:39:22] to things like anything like fainting or
[1:39:24] going like that and he I seen him fall
[1:39:26] backwards and I've seen his wife which
[1:39:28] is a registered nurse check his pulse
[1:39:30] and she screamed it was gone her sorry
[1:39:33] he was his pulse was gone so in the nee
[1:39:35] and the honor of Jesus Christ who it's
[1:39:37] the same God this morning I'd preached
[1:39:38] at length way over time
[1:39:40] tired of worn and there could be two
[1:39:42] things somebody have said it could have
[1:39:43] been two things either he got tired and
[1:39:45] passed out or I don't know if the shock
[1:39:48] of me saying that brother way taking it
[1:39:51] like that I might be rebuking him or
[1:39:53] something like that fell in this
[1:39:54] condition but the Lord Jesus brought him
[1:39:56] back so my man said he may have died for
[1:39:59] two reasons he may have just got tired
[1:40:00] his heart and a heart attack and died or
[1:40:02] bro Graham said he may have been shocked
[1:40:03] because brother BAM said brother Wei had
[1:40:05] a complex and maybe that shook him and
[1:40:07] made him made his heart stop
[1:40:09] now he says to think that the same God
[1:40:12] that great Saint Paul represented in his
[1:40:14] days that when he preached at length one
[1:40:17] night and a man fell and his life was
[1:40:19] gone out of him and Paul getting over
[1:40:21] the man by the grace of God said to the
[1:40:23] audience his life with us in him I think
[1:40:25] that proves to us if you've never seen
[1:40:27] him before that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:40:29] yesterday today and forever so brother
[1:40:31] Anderson he was preaching a little long
[1:40:33] and brother Wei died he prayed for him
[1:40:35] and brought him back and that's the same
[1:40:37] thing that Paul did when he preached all
[1:40:38] night and unica's fell out the window
[1:40:40] and Paul went and prayed for him and God
[1:40:43] brought him back to life Jesus Christ is
[1:40:45] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:40:46] amen now just a few things about the
[1:40:49] life our article there's the picture of
[1:40:52] it now if you notice the dot-dot-dot
[1:40:54] this article is actually a continuation
[1:40:56] the previous page now I don't have the
[1:41:00] picture cuz I forgot to get it but I
[1:41:02] could look I could show you here after
[1:41:03] service
[1:41:04] it looks so old though I don't want to
[1:41:06] take out of the bag but I will if I have
[1:41:08] to if you want to see it but you'll see
[1:41:10] what I'm talking about the previous page
[1:41:12] is actually the beginning of the article
[1:41:14] the topic is about rainbows caused by
[1:41:17] boom or beams of light that are
[1:41:20] reflected from the moon not the Sun so
[1:41:24] in other words the the article Mike
[1:41:26] begins by showing how the moon will
[1:41:29] produce a rainbow in other words how the
[1:41:32] moon is shining forth the light of
[1:41:35] Christ the bride is shining forth the
[1:41:37] light of Christ and a rainbow has to
[1:41:39] accompany that light which is the
[1:41:41] Covenant of God amen so this article is
[1:41:45] about how there's a rainbow or our
[1:41:46] covenant from moon light from the light
[1:41:49] of Christ amen you love it doesn't the
[1:41:55] bride have a covenant from Jesus Christ
[1:41:57] it's his promise if I go away I will
[1:41:59] prepare a place for you and I will come
[1:42:02] back again for my bride amen
[1:42:03] there's a covenant that we have that
[1:42:06] he's coming back for his bride now the
[1:42:09] beautiful thing is if if you can if you
[1:42:12] take that picture right here and you put
[1:42:14] it up to the light the picture from the
[1:42:18] previous page shut through because
[1:42:21] they're on top of each other
[1:42:23] you have a rainbow over the head of this
[1:42:26] pyramid and the Bible said that God
[1:42:32] would be clothed with a cloud and a
[1:42:33] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:42:38] was as it were the Sun and remember this
[1:42:40] picture happened at sunset so it's
[1:42:44] really dark here but the thousands of
[1:42:46] people that saw it was like shining like
[1:42:48] the Sun the cloud was shining like the
[1:42:51] Sun at darkness because it was sunset
[1:42:54] and all these attribute fitna peat
[1:42:57] pillar fire I don't know that's brother
[1:42:58] brands pillar fire I don't know what
[1:43:00] that is but we already have proof for
[1:43:02] all four four of these a cloud rainbow
[1:43:06] on the head and Sun we have proof for
[1:43:09] all that it's shine like the Sun how
[1:43:12] many love little hard not to me that
[1:43:15] that's beautiful it's just like when the
[1:43:17] Bible said when John the Baptist would
[1:43:19] come all the high place all the
[1:43:21] mountains would be brought low and all
[1:43:23] the low places we brought I got you we
[1:43:26] have to let God interpret the word we
[1:43:29] would be looking for mountains and
[1:43:31] excavators and bulldozers we will be
[1:43:33] looking for that in John the Baptist but
[1:43:35] that's not how God interpreted his word
[1:43:36] well here you'll do the same thing you
[1:43:39] have to let God interpret his don't work
[1:43:41] for he's the only interpreter of his
[1:43:42] word and how do you know it's God's Word
[1:43:45] because it'll go back to what was the
[1:43:47] what was the voice of the side amen
[1:43:49] the cloud is the sign but what was the
[1:43:51] voice of the side and the voice the sign
[1:43:53] was thus saith the Lord get the bride
[1:43:55] ready for the rapture get her ready for
[1:43:57] her marriage with Jesus Christ that's
[1:43:59] the message behind the sign does
[1:44:02] everybody see that oh I love it now
[1:44:07] let's stand to our feet I'm just gonna
[1:44:09] I'm just gonna briefs this real quick if
[1:44:10] you are if you ever get flustered by the
[1:44:16] believe the sign articles reading like
[1:44:17] that let me know I made I wrote a whole
[1:44:19] article how many pages I got your eighth
[1:44:20] article or eight pages two four six
[1:44:24] eight I've done eight pages already
[1:44:26] disproving most of their videos I
[1:44:28] haven't got all of them I've done eight
[1:44:30] pages if you want to know why they're
[1:44:32] wrong so they have out of nearly 40
[1:44:35] videos on their YouTube page
[1:44:37] only a handful actually deal with
[1:44:39] doctrine why do you think that is why do
[1:44:41] you think they don't attack by the Rams
[1:44:42] doctrine because the doctrine was
[1:44:45] infallible because you can't you can't
[1:44:48] you can't say well they never baptized
[1:44:49] the name of Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:44:51] Bible you can't say that so they're not
[1:44:53] gonna they're not going to make a video
[1:44:54] on brother Rams baptism was wrong how
[1:44:57] come they never make a video about the
[1:44:59] Trinity because there's no scripture
[1:45:00] that says God is three individual gods
[1:45:02] come on Church they stay away from
[1:45:05] doctrine because that's what brother
[1:45:07] Branham was taught was to do to bring
[1:45:09] back the original doctrine of the saints
[1:45:11] amen that's why they don't touch
[1:45:13] doctrine most of their videos and and
[1:45:18] most of their podcasts are about
[1:45:20] testimonies of people who got mistreated
[1:45:22] the message or didn't like what brother
[1:45:23] Graham said about women or it's just
[1:45:26] their opinions and I don't doubt that
[1:45:29] some of them got hurt by message
[1:45:30] believers I don't doubt that at all but
[1:45:32] what I'm saying is that the word was
[1:45:34] never wrong the preachers might have
[1:45:36] been wrong what they said about the word
[1:45:38] but God's Word is infallible God's Word
[1:45:40] was always be true so the thing was they
[1:45:43] didn't pray long enough they didn't wait
[1:45:45] upon the Lord long enough and of there's
[1:45:51] really just three that go against
[1:45:53] doctrine most of them only cast doubt on
[1:45:57] brother Bam's experiences they mostly a
[1:45:59] lot of them attack brother Branham as
[1:46:00] well but the three that I've I preached
[1:46:03] on I preached on him here back in 2013
[1:46:06] their first video their first pio says
[1:46:09] there are women angels in the Bible and
[1:46:11] there is no such a thing in the Bible
[1:46:14] they go to Zechariah chapter 5 and they
[1:46:17] say these must be women with wings
[1:46:19] picking up Israel and carrying her to
[1:46:21] Shinar but if you study the Bible women
[1:46:23] with wings in the Bible represent
[1:46:25] nations and so they and they only use
[1:46:29] one scripture to build a doctrine can
[1:46:31] you go to one scripture jesus said in
[1:46:34] the mouth of two or three witnesses that
[1:46:37] every word be established so the very
[1:46:38] first time they try to take dr. they try
[1:46:40] to prove that women can preach and women
[1:46:42] are angels and there ain't one scripture
[1:46:44] and there isn't one scripture in the
[1:46:45] Bible sorry for my ain't you will not
[1:46:48] you cannot prove in so I have made a
[1:46:50] whole video
[1:46:51] this disproving it I've had people say
[1:46:52] thank you that answered my question and
[1:46:54] all these things like that they can't
[1:46:56] touch the Word of God on doctrine they
[1:46:58] can't touch it
[1:46:58] the second is falling from grace they
[1:47:02] take one quote from brother Branham
[1:47:04] where he said a man a man that wears his
[1:47:06] hair like a woman has fallen from grace
[1:47:07] so he's he's talking about basically
[1:47:09] brother I'm talking about a woman or a
[1:47:11] man who's doing transgender jet dressing
[1:47:13] like a woman and brother Branham said if
[1:47:15] you try to do transgender and change
[1:47:17] your sex Butler BAM said you're you've
[1:47:19] fallen from grace and they say that's
[1:47:20] not right and I and I show when I preach
[1:47:24] us the Bible says you can fall away from
[1:47:27] grace the Bible says you can fail the
[1:47:29] grace of God the Bible said you can
[1:47:30] frustrate the grace of God and on top of
[1:47:34] all that they just took one court about
[1:47:36] brother Adams quotes about Grace and
[1:47:37] there's over 4,000 so they have no
[1:47:41] scripture to back it up and they take
[1:47:43] one quote out of 4,000 to say he was
[1:47:45] wrong they don't look at the other 3999
[1:47:48] that's really unfair and that's not
[1:47:52] balancing the Word of God and they don't
[1:47:53] even have two or three witnesses from
[1:47:55] the scripture in the last which was
[1:47:59] probably the most detrimental was the
[1:48:00] one about marriage and divorce they
[1:48:02] basically say you could marry divorce as
[1:48:04] much as you want and brother mam came
[1:48:06] down and said there's only one cause for
[1:48:07] remarriage after divorce and that's
[1:48:10] fornication that's unconfessed and he
[1:48:12] said thus saith the Lord and this is one
[1:48:14] their most popular videos it's got
[1:48:15] almost over nine thousand views and I've
[1:48:20] got two videos on marriage and divorce
[1:48:21] on our website that it fully explains
[1:48:23] everything like that so what does it
[1:48:25] come down to it comes down to this we've
[1:48:26] got love our enemies they're our enemies
[1:48:29] in one way as far as they attack God's
