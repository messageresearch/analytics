numerology tonight and biblical numerology of course you know I gotta be careful I use that word you know cuz the world uses that word obviously the wrong way we'd like to go to let's go to familiar scripture here let's go to I think Matthew 1 yeah Matthew 1 verse 17 let's start there by God's grace glad to make his sister Wendy before the snow came in now you got to drive through the snow we will pray for you that God will be with you the forecast is only one-inch so hopefully stays that made by God's grace Matthew 1:17 I'll be real honest tonight we're looking at 14 15 16 17 I don't have any clear real revelations on these other than 17 17 seems to be clear so the Lord speaks something to you please share with me in fact it was 17 that brother Aaron shared with me all these 17s I've never heard before so the Bible says you can bring a psalm to church a revelation a doctrine just come bringing something to church so I first said that that was weeks and weeks ago on a Wednesday night after service brother Aaron's like you brother Jesse did you know there's all these 17s I'm like tell me because I wanna know all the biblical numerology I can because you know when you see it you then you'll see that it's Christ because God speaks through numbers praise the Lord so Matthew 1:17 14 seems to connect to generation somehow church I don't quite understand it but 14 seems to be a generational number so let's look at this here tonight here so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations so three four teens I believe that's 42 often a number not mistaken so interesting they're not as blessings the reading was word maybe seated here so this is part 13 remember 13 give me a good number two as we looked at a few weeks ago let's go through this I do have a slides here Lydia so to make sure I'm not forget anything I did buy more seal books sister honey if you they're out there if you need them by God's grace we able to livestream the first service today okay okay good so you heard that all right thank you all right all right that's okay was that like radio or something like that okay no problem no problem you're fine you know in Lima we use to go to Lima right and every almost every week or every every couple of times a month all the sound things would pop and there'd be this laugh and when I went back and preached two years ago it happened again so there's just all these technological problems but you a great job lady don't be discouraged appreciate all you do back there all right so that's a good part 13 I'm just so happy in the Lord you know after this morning's message I'm just so thankful to be in - to be in the right time and season by God's grace I know I'm in the time and season of the rapture we know that I was gonna preach on that tonight but I think I'll save that for Wednesday night I just kind of felt burdened to get through these numbers I'm almost to the end you know once you get to about you know 40 then it kind of kind of skips to 50 and then kind of goes like that and it's kind of there's big skips between the numbers after that so I'm getting closer to the end of this series but it's been a good series I've been really thankful I really consider this series like a initial partially finished series no matter when I get done because I feel like as we go on and serve the Lord God's gonna go show us some more numbers as we go along and then it'll be more complete the revelation will be more complete if the Lord tarries I really believe that is something God's gonna keep adding to as I go along I just got to make sure when the Holy Spirit opens up a number I go write it down because God's trying to tell us something through the numbers he's trying to reveal something to us so let's just go over this again real quickly one is preeminence unity - as division difference testimony unity as well threes perfection and life for is deliverance double confirmation it's also an earthly number five is Grace laboring grace and redemption six has fallen man and beast it's also anointed man and it's a measurement of time or did I skip past seven I must have skipped past seven well seven we know is completion no I don't know rider than f7 on there eight is eternity or the first day again new creation new beginning or abundance 9 is fruit or consummation or closure or judgment 10 is divine order worldliness could be a faithful remnant as well 11 is disorder or the last call what was I looking at oh yeah I forgotten this one there's a I just was reading this one there's 11 times the word overcomers used in revelation 11 why cuz it's the last call there's seven in the church ages and there's four afterwards you know so the first revelation two and three have seven of them he that overcometh he that overcometh you though we're coming so there's 11 last calls for overcomers anybody else would overcome God's saying through the book of Revelation I say right here me last car 12 government rule or worship 13 is rebellion victory slash Revelation I found another 13 - I can't remember what it was now bear with me let me skip ahead I'll go back and find it real quick then I'll come back up I know I want to make sure I lay these in so we got them for the future almost there there it is yeah 13-day so sorry mercy goodness so a stirring the Jews were supposed to be killing on the 13th day of the 12th month so the devil met 13 for a bad number but God turned around and when God delivered him the Bible said on the thirteenth day they made a feasting and gladness so what was meant for rebellion like right it was the evil man wasn't it haman haman's rebellion against the Jews God turned around for good amen I thought you might like that by God's grace amen but what Satan has planned for bad God will turn around - good that's right so I want to make sure I read that one now 14 let's now we're in the 14 15 16 17 now I put question marks because I can't understand these seven of course I'm sorry 14 of course is a double of seven seven is completion now the book the book writer but enger' said you know double completion why don't know how something could be doubly complete if it's already completed at seven I don't know so I just I just put a question mark I'm not sure but it definitely does relate to generations as you'll see here in just a moment as we looked at our text now Jacob had to work a double 7 for his bride right seven years for Leah he says you fulfill he said you've done this he said now fulfill Rachel's week so that was seven more years so double seven now I've preached in the past that those two do type the the Jew and the Gentile bride I'm not familiar with my notes on that because it's been years and years but that is an interesting type they're 14 Joseph's interpreted Pharaoh's dream that covered a 14-year period so this generation or these these two groups of seven would see seven years of plenty and then seven years of famine 14 and Joseph would be ruling at the beginning and end of that so that's interesting to see a double seven there the lamb was killed on the 14th day so that's striking to of Christ being crucified on the 14 day the third month so 14 there there's 14 so it can mean like something like I was trying to look up words like pivot or Junction or something like that there's something with that 14 as we saw in Matthew chapter 1 you know it was from Abraham to David you know there was like a like a change or that was like a completion you know so maybe it is double completion I don't know that's interesting and this morning we saw there's 14 times and seasons that God lists in Ecclesiastes 3 there's not 13 there's not 15 there's 14 times and seasons which is striking not sure why 14 seems to be seems to be like it may be a generation you know would go through these things or maybe you and your life you know 40 years also gonna be a generation which is interesting to kind of mixing up the numbers there but you understand 14 seems to be four times and seasons we saw there's three sets of 14 from Abraham to David 14 than from David to carrying away to Babylon so see that kind of marks like changes right or junctions and then from Babylon to Christ fourteen generations so it's really quite striking to me it's mysterious I'll say it like that and so if you guys if anyone gives you a rabbit or God gives you a revelation anybody let me know I'll be happy to to take that revelation there by the grace of Lord but like I said I've never heard a sermon on numerology biblical numerology so I'm just trying to I'm just I feel like I've kind of like an explorer I'm just kind of exploring deeper than then what I've ever heard on it and just trying to go as deep as I can and whatever I find praise the Lord I'll rejoice in that but I believe as we go on God will show us more of these troops the soldiers that Paul was with in the boat fasted for 14 days I'm sorry 13 rather and then on the 14th they broke the fast so like a change so maybe 14 is like a change yeah they fasted 13 but the Bible said on the 14th they took some meat Paul told them to take for 14 I'm sorry to take meat on the 14th day there was 14 years between Paul's visits to Jerusalem so right after he was saved born again there was 14 years he went to Arabia for three years right and then he went on his missionary trip I believe it was first missionary trip and he came back after 14 years so that seems like a period of time you know two sevens in there again I can't explain it I can't let nail it down like I can nail down a three I can down to seven I can nail down a ten that's that's divine order but this one I just can't quite nail down I can't quite see the pattern here let's go to 15 as you can tell this probably won't be a very long sermon but I want to lay it out there by the grace of God so 15 it could mean again question marks could mean a triple five five is grace but again triple grace I mean that's the number I hadn't won my my band got fixed for free five five five I don't know I don't know I'm just looking for an um you know thankful just thankful for God's grace but does certainly relate to the feasts which is interesting we'll see a couple of those feasts unleavened bread and Tabernacles relates to those two okay but first the ark was born of the flood 15 cubits above the earth remember the Bible said it rain from the tops of the trees up was 15 cubits so there was 15 cubits of layer of water right under the ark to the highest mountain I believe if I'm not mistaken or the highest tree or mountain or something along those lines so 15 15 cubits Hezekiah member he got in the permissive will of God and God asked for more time to set his house order God gave him 15 years interesting what were the ones I thought okay feast that doesn't relate to feasts here's the face the Jews were delivered from death on under Esther on the fifteenth day of the month okay okay that's right because the 13 then she fasted two days had to feast right yeah in the 13th 14th yeah and this is especially significant okay he's already connected that number of 13 so he already I already brought that one out on the 13th day that was supposed to be their execution day so 15th day of the month next feast so the 15th day of the first month was the feast of unleavened bread 15 and of course that's the day that Christ descended down and preached to the spirits that were in prison praise the Lord and he took the keys of death hell in the grave amen on that 15th day also the 15th day started the Feast of Tabernacles which types the Millennium for us so that's interesting too can't quite I don't quite know have the full understanding on that but we see that in the scripture 15 15 feasts connected to feasts let's go to 16 now also I can see in this is like a double 8 and 8 represented the first day all over again it represents eternity so this is interesting too I don't know what else it would mean other than that so did you know there are 16 descriptions of love in first Corinthians 13 there's 16 so let's read them charity suffereth long now if anybody should have the bachelors at Holy Ghost charity it ought to be you and I so this this ought to pertain to us if we don't get any number if we don't care about the numbers then let's get all 16 of these attributes in our lives amen suffer along with people be kind of people Envy not so you're happy for somebody you don't envy them doesn't exalt yourself and pride and is not puffed up number 5 does not behave itself unseemly right of order 7 it seeketh not her own but seeks others is not easily provoked so you have some thick-skinned church got thick skin thinketh no evil so if anything comes evil love just cast it down I'm not gonna think anything about it that's the one one through nine ten doesn't rejoice in iniquity but 11 tells us what it does rejoice in the truth of God's Word 12 it bears all things it can handle all the trials and handle all the hatred or evil or persecution it can bear all things and it can hope for all things praise the Lord we have a Living Hope in Christ the Bible said he's our living hope it can endure all things and charity never fails all sixteen don't you like that by God's grace I don't know I don't know what other 16s are in fact in the book there's not even a section for 16 it just kind of omits it I found this one later there's something from the Holy Spirit just reminded me of when I read this years ago and I thought oh they're 16 and so I just kind of came to me today pause and study so see after 16 it stops describing charity and whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away that's interesting you know what's interesting as I was thinking was because the statute permit man has seven but charity is eight charity's eight but then charity has sixteen descriptions now I'm just throwing numbers out there okay I'm just trying to work with it a little bit okay just get you thinking here get myself thinking because I'm trying to see what God is trying to say here many ways that's what we want we want sixteen attributes of love proceeding from our life if we can do these things will never fail praise God so Jesus would have raised from the dead on the 16th day of that first month right because the Passover lamb was killed on the fourteenth the evening of the 14th so 14 15 16 so again you have eternal life on that one so there's that remember there's three numbers that seem to type the resurrection three the third day the eighth day right Monday or Sunday and then now this the 15th day I'm sorry 16th days sorry sorry so there's the all these numbers that are pointing to the resurrection of Christ interesting just interesting all right we're already on 17 so I was like I said maybe we'll do 15 more minutes this gonna be one of my shortest servers no ha or maybe what I'll do you know if it's really short I'll just go preach the the second part from tonight I'll just combine two sermons into one we'll see let me see how that Halong long this goes here how long have I been preaching lady is it under okay well I put my timer for 15 so if I do half an hour I don't think anybody's gonna get mad at me praise the Lord what I'll do is I'll make sure we read all these scriptures okay so I've been studying the head on the other one and so I just had a little bit of time to work on this one I was studying at on the purpose I have more on that but I just thought you know I really want to get this numerology done tonight so it looks like 17 relates to the bride and this is what brother Aaron had shared a few things in here with me and I had not noticed before now but enger' in the book says this he said 17 stands out as a very prominently as a significant number it's not a multiple of any number therefore it has no factors so you can't divide it that's interesting you can't divide the Bride of Christ either she's United hence it is called one of the prime or indivisible numbers you can't divide us we're all on spirit praise God what is more it is the seventh in the list of prime numbers so out of seven prime numbers it's number seven the 17 is seven that's interesting of course seven is a good rapture number with Enoch seven church ages right seven seals on the seven seals the day in the hour of Christ's coming so that's interesting house 17 is connected to a seven now this means a little bit to me I was born on the 17th day so I mean this means a little bit to me okay not too much I mean I do believe I'm a bride member but I'm not trying to make myself better than anybody understand I just see no well maybe God gave me that to encourage me I don't know now here's where it's really scriptural Church this has to do with the bride there were seventeen nations present on the day of Pentecost and brother Brahim said that was the birth of the Bride of Christ right because they got the Holy Ghost that's the birth of the bride now it was the Jewish portion of the bride right but later went to the Samaritans in Chapter eight and then the Gentiles in Chapter ten but that's the beginning of the bride because that's what Ephesians chapter two and three is all about these two nations Jew Gentile had become one by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that's a great mystery that's one of the 12 great mysteries how that these two groups of people jooge então could be made one and they're one by the Holy Ghost so let's read that just so you guys let's go to acts 2 I got 15 minutes here let's see what he can do what we can do yeah it's eight through eleven that's right now this is significant especially as you get down here I mean this 153 and then God is trying to say something here and I trust he'll reveal it here a little bit tonight acts 2 8 and how hear we every man in our own tongue we're and we were born now this to me like looks like God's going fishing and he's gonna fish for within 17 different nations that's what it looks like to me because it's later connected to fish okay so Parthian x' one means to Elamites three dwellers in Mesopotamia four in Judea five and in Cappadocia six in in Pontus seven and asia eight and fer gia nine and Pamphylia ten in Egypt eleven and the parts of Libya twelve and Cyrene thirteen and The Strangers of Rome was Ione 14 okay so this is 14 Romans 14 okay Jews and proselytes 15 creats 16 and Arabians 17 we do hear them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God amen there you go 17 why 17 well 17 seems to be a multiple of 153 let's go to John 21:11 why there have to be 17 there well to me God was calling out his bride he was birthing his bride the bride was being born and was only going to grow from that moment on he started with a 17 now Church you know this is after Jesus had rose from the dead Peter said I go efficient he said I'm done preaching for a while I'm going fishing and Jesus meets them in verse 5 and said children have you any meat the answered no and then verse 6 he said cast a net another on the right side of the ship and ye shall find on the right side interesting on the right not the wrong the right side and then in verse 11 you know what happened Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes 153 153 and for all there were so many yet the net was not broken amen the net was able to hold a hundred fifty three which is a multiple of seventeen and there were seventeen nations on the day of Pentecost and that interesting Peter on the day of Pentecost was the one who let out the gospel net amen and three thousand souls were saved right three thousand souls were baptized out of 17 nations so this is striking this seems to be a great connection there and notice that they're called fish and this relates to Jesus seventh and final parable in Matthew 13 let's go there Matthew 13 47 1347 all right 13:47 this is the seventh and final parable here in Matthew 13 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast in the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but the bad a barber cast away the bad so shall it be at the end of the world and the net shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth so just interesting God would have kept of course the good fish here but it's connected to a seven and member 17 is the seventh prime number so just interesting how the fish are connected with 17s again and then 153 connected to fish there so I just thought I'd throw that in there to get our spiritual minds working there by God's grace all right okay let's keep going after this so this begins what brother Aaron was sharing with me Aster's the seventeenth Old Testament book right so if you count started Jenna or Genesis count all the way down Esther 17 so she's a woman and she comes out to save the people for such a time as this so it looks like a type of the bride and then this is interesting on the 17th day now I I don't can't see how this types the bride because this would type the foolish virgin but on the seventeenth day of the month the same day The Fountains of the deep broke up and the windows of heaven were open and it started raining on the 17th day of that month in Genesis 7:11 so again all these numbers here so these are Old Testament Scriptures so rains and then the water starts flowing on the 17th day it's interesting the ark actually came to rest on the 17th day as well but a different month the seventh month so it found its rest on day 17 so the waters broke open the water came down the 17th month that all that time later finally found its rest on the 17th these I don't know I'm just sharing them with you just interesting to see the 17s now back to the Holy Ghost and the bride now brother Aaron just pointed these out the 17s here that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love so here's a verse it's a 17th verse of a chapter and it's speaking about Christ in you and that's what the bride has Christ in you the hope of glory the Old Testament couldn't have that that was specifically for the bride and then we actually see the name bride the word bride in another 17 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that here say come and let him that's a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely so these are just interesting connections you know to like the 17th verse you know and each chapter had to deal with the bride oh yeah and I like that - this the Holy Ghost rest in the heart on the on three 17 that was pretty good just like the ark rested there on the seventeenth day right so just so just a small little connection nothing maybe major for doctor and anything like that just interesting to see a little connection in the numbers okay now I want to read these now Romans 8:35 let's go there there are 17 things listed that give our true standing in Christ 17 not not 16 and not 18 17 and this was in the book this is this is a thought from Bullinger here Romans 8:35 so there's a set of seven at the beginning of this scripture and then there's a set of ten at the end so a ten and a seven for a relation ten seven that's a connection there Romans 8:35 okay so here's the first list and who shall separate us from the love of Christ so let's count these tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness peril or swords there's the first seven so these seven will not separate the bride now the Paul speaking to the bride here brother hamster remember he's not preaching to sinner's he's preaching to the bride all right and then he breaks to this real thought here as is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so she we are conquering sheep amen we just got to give ourselves as sheep would write as a sheep would give itself as a sacrifice we just have to learn to give ourselves over to God for a sacrifice and then we're conquering sheep Oh hallelujah amen Brian persuaded now here's the list of 10 so we had a list of seven here's a list of 10 none of these seventeen things will keep us from the love of Christ frien persuade that neither death one life angels principalities powers things present nor things to come there's seven right there nor height nor depth nor any other creature there's ten shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord and the church said seventeen things will not separate the bride from the love of God amen thank you lord praise God that's encouraging church when we get down we should go read that write tribulation won't distress persecution famine nakedness I taught him this a few weeks ago at Bible Club and I had I had 17 kids line up or what I use I used I used it wasn't 17 I use 10 or 7 I actually didn't realize there were 17 here I think I use 10 yeah I think I use 10 and so I had 10 people stand between a in Christ and that that believer just walked down and he pushed over well let me read the Bible I just had him walked down through and I said push over tribulation he just pushed over tribulation then he pushed over distress then he pushed over persecution then he pushed over famine then he pushed over nakedness then he pushed over pail then he pushed over sword and then he hugged Jesus because nothing can separate us from the love of God I thought that was a good illustration none of these things if they're in our way none of them can separate us from the love of Christ right we just speak to that storm it moves we we were pray God raised a standard up against that storm praise God all 17 so this shows are standing in Christ that nothing can separate us from his love so may be standing in the love of Christ let me just add that they're standing in the love of Christ I think I like that then we got that for the future I've see the reason I'm doing this is because Jose's asked me three or four times for copies of this sermon so I don't want to if he wants this copy I don't want him to miss out on any notes okay so I hope that's all right now let's go to Hebrews 12 there's 17 ways Paul lists that the Old Testament is different than the new 17 there's again that number 17 Hebrews 12 eighteenth Hebrews 12 18 okay and I think there are two groups as well let me check I'm gonna flip over to the Internet so he had him here yeah I got these from Bollinger so he has yeah there's a group of seven and there's a group of ten in Hebrews 12 so it's count seven first then we'll see the ten all right twelve eighteen for your not come unto the Mount that might not I'm sorry that might be touched and that burned it with fire nor unto blackness darkness Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice that us are they that heard entreated that the word should be spoken to them anymore so there must have been the seven right there right let me flip over here yeah so there's the seven right there the Mount could not be touched burn with fire there's my 15 minutes of our done half an hour praise the Lord burn with fire blackness darkness Tempest sound of a trumpet and the voice of words aren't you glad that's not the kind of church services you come to blackness and can't touch the mountain can't approach God but we can approach God can't we but ye are come to this shrink a little more and I'm gonna read verse 24 they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was this sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake verse 22 here it is but ye are come unto Mount Zion number we're looking for the Mount Zion showdown where is that right rapture brother ma'am said that's the rapture the Mount Zion showdown and it's the struggle between Christ and denominations all I'm glad we're a million miles from denominations amen Christ the word is who were gathered with tonight hallelujah we've come to Mount Zion we've come to the place of rapture haha yeah and the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to the God and to the SAR end to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the media of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen praise God what a what a difference that we have Church amen think of all these blessings here in these seventeen descriptors think of how our covenant is so much greater praise God by the blood of Jesus Christ Christ better things than that of Abel Abel cried out for vengeance avenge me my brother but what is the blood of Christ cry out for forgiveness amen forgive them they know not what they do God give us grace to forgive amen how do you like that is that okay you like that amen I think that's really inspired there because it's sure now I just got a couple more 17 brother Aaron brought this one to my attention - I forgot about this one in 1933 brother Han says this repeatedly I think he says it like 14 or 20 times the message the pillar of fire appeared above brother Branham on the Ohio River as he was baptizing the 17th person now to me this message that the pillar of fire says is a message to the bride but we have said I was baptizing down on the river my first converts at the Ohio River and the 17 person I was Matt is that first converse when those be the firstfruits of the bride right through his ministry his ministry and the 17 person I was baptizing and as I started to baptize him I said father as I baptized with water you baptize him with the Holy Spirit and I started to put him under the water and just when and just then a will came from the heavens above and Here Come that light shining down hundreds and hundreds of people on the bank right at two o'clock in the afternoon in June and it hung right over where I was a voice spoke from there said as John the Baptist was sent for the forerunner of the first coming of Christ you've got to have a message that will bring forth the forerunner of the second coming of Christ and it like this scare me to death see that as we know that presence doesn't make us happy that presence makes us fearful it's such a holy sacred presence so on the 17th person a message comes down and says you've got a message that's for the bride of Jesus Christ amen 17 hallelujah thank you lord all right and of course in Life magazine they picked it up on the cloud and it was published on the 17th day of May so again you see 17 and Bob Arum said that was Christ looking down at us he said that Christ that that cloud was Christ looking down at his bride so he not look at his bride they published it on the 17th so interesting there and I think that's it yeah that was it all right so how did I do there that's about 45 minutes let me uh let me just go a little bit for let me go back to the the message from this morning on can I go back to times and seasons I just want to do one thing real quick I heard a couple of amens alright so let me go I just want to close to this the rapture has times and seasons you know the words times and seasons are only in the Bible a handful of times I forget how many the actual phrase times and seasons well this connects perfectly cuz this deals with the bride so what a great way to close 17 is the Brides number and let's close with times and seasons for the bride know did you ever notice this it's it's been real to me this week because I've been each morning I get up I try to get up at 4:30 or 5:00 and then I always start with prayer read a chapter in the Bible and then I do the Facebook post today was my hundredth day in a row I've done the Facebook post and then for that I do an hour of writing on the book and after that then I devote some time to study for this the writing on the rapture chapter I'm almost done I got a couple more sections to do I'm gonna do with two sections the next section is on the reasons why the rapture has to be secret and of course that's because Satan could do great damage I'm gonna tie that in with hair and how Herod knew and Jesus was gonna be born or after he was born so he did great damage he killed thousands of Jewish baby boys and course Roman boys too but how much damage would Satan do if he knew about the time of the rapture he'd go to killing right because he wants to kill destroy but also in that chapter I'm going to add the last sign I'm working on there right now the last sign for the rapture cuz brother Graham told us thus say at the Lord the last sign that God gave to Abraham and Sarah before the body change was God in flesh discerning the thoughts and intents of Abraham and Sarah's heart while they were in the tent right that was the last sign and it was LA yesterday I went read I read chapters 20 21 and 22 I read that yesterday that was God's last visit to them before the body change because chapter 19 was the destruction chapter 20 was Abraham's laps in Greer with King Abimelech right and God didn't reveal anything there was no signs from God in that one God didn't come to them and then 21 God visited Sarah and touched her and then that came then came Isaac so the last sign before the visitation to bring forth the promised son was the discernment and that's why brother Ram says over and over he said my ministry is the last sign of the Gentiles before the body change thus saith the Lord so that's quite a statement to make amen so anyways and we're dealing with that this week I noticed that the last time times and seasons are used is in 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 right after the rapture but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with them can you imagine church they didn't have a New Testament so when the when the Christians at Thessalonica died they would be sorrowing and Paul's like I got to encourage them Lord what should I write to encourage them so he writes about the rapture to encourage them amen there they're I mean they're just they don't have a Bible you and I get to read this and we can be so happy but they didn't have that so God leads Paul to write and tell them they're not dead in fact they'll rise first amen don't be discouraged don't be sorrowful there's hope don't be hopeless these Christians that have died you'll see them again fact you'll see them first for this we say to you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain on the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout that's what we've heard the cry with the voice of the Archangel that's the resurrection of the Dead and with a trump of god that's the body change and the of the believer and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord that's interesting the meeting in the air is in verse 17 like is that a 17 in here that's what I mean they they rise first but where do we meet on that seventy first God's just trying to keep his encourage church right wherefore comfort one another with these words this is a great comfort to us the dead in Christ will see the dead in Christ first before we are changed I believe that now remember there was no chapter 5 so the letter ended with this comfort one another with the words now look he goes into the last time this is record in Scripture the last time times and seasons are mentioned are for the bra for us and Paul says you dump have need for me to write unto you about the times and seasons of the rapture now that's striking and the reason he goes on to say is because you are children of the day in other words you'll be so awake you'll see things so clearly that you it's impossible for you to miss the rapture amen he said you don't need for me to tell you about times and seasons because the rapture to you will happen in broad daylight amen glory is that what the Word of God says church look at this but other times it seasons brethren you have no not need brother Jess you need to preach to unrest at times and scenes of the rapture apparently I don't because we'll be so awake in righteousness that it'll be like a regular daytime event right that's what Paul says he says you don't need for me to write to you now these are this is striking these are the same people who are sorrowing and so sad will ever see my really my loved ones again and Paul says you will take comfort in the rapture the shout voice Trump take comfort in that and he says you don't need for me to tell you about the times and seasons because you're so awake it's impossible for you to miss it if somebody tried to walk into your house and steal something while you're awake would you be able to catch them or not yeah you think you could of course you see them there be no let me know no question about it your shouldn't be here it's not your property doesn't belong to you well in this case the thief's not taking something of ours the thief has taken us amen right Jesus said I come as a thief see it's like he's stealing us away from the devil's grips that's right for yourselves know perfectly that the day of Lord so cometh as a thief in the night so for Satan in the sinners it'll be like it's nighttime and Jesus sneaks in and snatches his wife away for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brother are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief so this is why you don't need me to tell you how it's gonna be like this or because you are not children of the night you're children of the day verse 5 you all sugar the light of the church of the day we are not other like North darkness so we have to worry about any thief or we don't worry about any surprise about the rapture hey there's nothing we no surprise about the rapture for you and I will be expecting it we'll be looking for it we'll be loving it amen he said coming to all those that love his appearing Paul said let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober oh thank you lord now church sober means calm so see when you start feeling your your pulse racing oh my god mr. rapture manga mr. rapture that's not scriptural we've got to cast down the fear in Jesus Christ's name I looked it up but what does that doesn't mean well I'm not going to get drunk that that has nothing I mean a Christian would be million miles away from that it's not sober like I'm not drinking alcohol wine or Bud Light or it has nothing to do with that it's a calmness what is it it's a confidence watch for Christ's rapture for us with confidence be calm about it remember those shirts keep calm and keep calm and trust the rapture is gonna happen I got a new shirt for them right they say keep calm and do I don't forget I forget some of the sayings they have on there keep calm and watch for the coming of Christ I got a new shirt now praise the Lord so see sinners don't have any idea about the times and seasons but we already know there's no need to write about it because we're awake we'll see it coming it won't it won't overtake us as a thief now see even this foolish virgin knows Church so people that have heard the shout they've heard brother rams messages she knew so she was seeking the oil too late it was too late there's 45 minutes praise God see it was too late for her didn't use her time wisely like we preached on this morning redeem the time right point your life accurately at the target right walk accurately walk into God's plan for your life do God's purpose for your life live an accurate straight life according the perfect will of God and then you won't be seeking oil at the last minute you already have it praise God you already hit the mark praise the Lord you've already already marked with the Holy Ghost oh thank you lord now let's keep reading a few more for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken or drunk in the night but let us who are the day be sober that means called now I'm gonna close with this thought about the whole armor of God that's why I want to close with so Paul says if we are of the day if we don't need anybody to preach to us about the times and seasons of the rapture he says then watch be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not obtained appointed us under wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him so did you ever catch this paw follows up the rapture and chapter 4 by saying we don't need to know the times and seasons because we're children of the day we're not going to be surprised like a thief at nighttime because we're watching like soldiers who are ready to fight now see that part was never connected to me really till I studied it this week and then you can connect that to Ephesians 6 with the full armor of God he just lists two parts of the six pieces of armor he just lists two here but we know that they all go together Paul lists at all six in Ephesians six there's a six so he all right now here I'm taking an excerpt this is an excerpt from my book the next one like I said the first one it goes on presale on Friday and then it goes on sale on the fifteenth so I finally got the dates I announced yet but that's because I'm a little nervous like I don't know if my publisher is gonna get outside of an announcement I'm a little nervous my first time doing it so anyways this is for the next book the Apostle describes the times and scenes of the rapture with two descriptors first sinners will be unaware of the rapture just as drunk and sleeping robbery victims are caught off guard by a nighttime thief Jesus teaches the same idea when he likens the day of the Lord as the days of Noah in which the lost kept eating drinking and marrying right up until the flood came and took them away so they're both unaware oh we'll just keep going and eating drinking being Mary there's no there's no destruction coming the same idea and then Paul compares the sinners to sleeping drunks second Paul proclaims the world's mantra so they'll be saying peace and safety peace and safety peace and safety at the time of Christ Sutton wraps your event it's striking to imagine how contrary the thoughts and plans of sinners will be compared to those of God so God's thinking so God is planning worldwide war at Armageddon and destruction so God thinking war destruction and the sinners are saying peace and safety total opposite right that shows you how far they are from the mind of God when you see these articles on Facebook about bortion and judgments of God they're exactly right God is thinking destruction war and the world thinking peace and safety that's just all get along let's just think I'll keep it living as long as we want to you know none of these guys are than these North Korea guys and you know Russia they're not going to shoot off that that missile with those atomic bombs yet because they want to keep living here they love the world but the Bible says that we should not love the things of the world nor the world itself amen they really don't want a war now they will eventually when they do when they start hating the but right now they don't want a war they want to keep living lusciously luxuriously all those things they don't want to serve Christ they want to have they want to have their heaven right here on earth but we don't have heaven on earth right we have heaven when heaven comes down to earth that's right no and I say our Christians living in a world that matches these description yet partially no doubt see it each day we're getting closer and closer to these now this is small I'm sorry but the Bible I just list seven other reasons that prove were at the time of the rapture scoffers mocking that's what Peter says people be scoffing huh the lord the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ will return they'll be scoffing at it the the conditions of Noah violence attractive women continually evil thoughts Luke 17 Genesis 6 the sodomite conditions of lot's time will be repeated Luke 17 many churches come in a great falling away 2nd Thessalonians 2 we see that men will love themselves more than God they'll be covetous boasters proud blasphemers this will be in the parents thumb thankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady - having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof I need to count those mercy but can I do it real quick one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen Wow so at the time of the bride when the bride's at seventeen they have a seventeen impersonation in that striking I didn't plan that either just like I was telling you with Benjamin I didn't plan that four year thing that would that was just kind of I just kind of happened my goodness mercy the New Testament gospel will have been preached to all the world so in other words the message will hear about the message starting to go more around the globe and finish all the nations around the globe that that's what Wessel will know about and then Israel be ready to return to God and we may see them the beginning of the building of the temple or we may not I I personally think we'll start to see it that's what I personally think because I think they I think when the bride goes up those two witnesses that anointing has to come down because God works God works by days with Israel days like he counted the day and the year 70 weeks right all those you know 490 years like he counts every day so I believe the day the bride goes up that'll be the same day that anointing comes down for the two witnesses and then they'll start worshipping because they only have three and a half years I mean three and a half years I guess you could build a temple within that but they'd have to work fast depends how build that how big the temple is but I honestly I'm believing see how I'm believing God will do everything he can to get us in rapturing faith mode amen oh we just raised our faith to see that shrine come down on the Temple Mount and then to see those you start building the temple again amen how that would raise our faith and then on top of that to see brother Branham alive or Paul or these dead in Christ by all--they if we did that all things are possible amen ah to have bride members show up in our church services there Saint John the Divine I mean all we'd be screaming shouting and passing out and then for let's say 40 days if it was 40 days like they did for Jesus can you imagine the faith oh my you would have to drag anybody to church then we'd have to beg anybody to pray or you wanted to beg anybody to a preacher hear the word come up for prayer you know what's a bag anything oh my the faith you just be raised that's just my thought I could be wrong on that I just really believe God will do everything he can do that we don't have to worry about the times and seasons oh we have to worry about that it's like daytime to us Jesus coming is like we're just waiting for him to open the door we're just we're already it's daytime we're sitting on the porch waiting for Christ to show up or just swinging the swing and just resting under this we're just resting on this seven seal its resting time glory now here's what I want to close Paul says the Christians only hope for being spiritually awakened soberly watching for Christ returns by putting on the full armor of God and I never really thought about this till now remember brother Ram said in 1962 Peter didn't have the full armor of God on until we went to Pentecost then when he went to Pentecost now he's got the full armor of God on thank you Lord amen so people who are born again by the Holy Ghost it's like their eyes it's it's it's like the difference between night and day how many can say amen to that think about the time you got the Holy Ghost it should have been night and day or should have felt a little bit like night and day before I had the Holy Ghost it was like darkness kind of getting lights ain't vacation you know but once you got the Holy Ghost the light should have been on well I see what Christ is doing now I'm not living in darkness anymore I'm a child of the light amen so Paul describes two pieces of armor in 1st Thessalonians 5 and then there's 6 described in Ephesians 6 so it behooves us to understand each piece of armor that we may be able to withstand the evil day having done all to stand so here's just a brief summary and I'll go through these kind of quick the breastplate of faith and love now what is the physical breastplate do I was looking it up in the Bible commentaries it protects the heart and other vital organs right in this chest cavity right so it protects the heart the lungs the the chest here abdomen so just as a physical breastplate protects the heart and other vital organs down to the waist because that's where the girdle is so does righteous I'm sorry just as a righteous obedient Christian life of integrity protects our heart from Satan's attack on our character so that's what I thought because it's called a breastplate of what righteousness and righteousness is doing what's right it's a very simple Greek word it just means you do what's right so when you do right so much brother bang in Malachi when you do right things all the time it's like you've got this protective shield of righteousness over your heart and no matter what Satan says about your character you know you live a Christian life you might fall short of the glory but your heart is protected behind a breastplate of righteousness amen I know I used to live on righteously but I know I live righteously now st. you try to attack me all he wants for the Amen but I know I live a righteous life i crucify this guy every day and then I got a crucified the next day he comes back to life I got to crucify him again the next day we know our heart our our heart our feelings our character is protected by the righteousness of Jesus Christ he's made me righteous he produced a righteous life he strengthens me to do the right things amen helmet of salvation just as a physical helmet protects the head the command center and the most complex organ in the human body the most complex place so does the hope of salvation which is the assurance that we're saying to forgive my Jesus sacrifice protect us from Saint attempt to make us doubt our salvation right so Jesus's hope protects our most complex wish right that we're saved right we don't want to be lost so the most were protected by that hope God protects us with the hope of salvation he protects us in our mind Satan's eyes say you're not safe you're not safe how could you be safe how could you be saved I'm saved by the protection of the hope that Christ has given me amen that's what protects my most complex questions my most complex part my control center that look protects my control center is the hope of salvation praise God now church are you putting all these on every day yeah maybe not specifically but if you pray and repent you're putting them on right if you get in the under the anointing you're putting these on I'll be honest I don't think I've ever got up one day and put on all six parts but maybe I need to do that tomorrow but see when you were when you and I say Jesus forgive me empower me today fill me with more of your power and love you are putting on the full armor of God next loins gird about with truth a girl means a man could tuck his long flowing robe into his belt and abling him to travel run or work in the same way a Christians mind is gird up win the Bible truth calmly prepared to be victorious in spiritual mind battles and successful in his ministries work because the Bible's Peter said gird up the loins of your mind so this means you're calming your mind and no matter what no matter what law comes after me God will bring me the answer in my mind I'm not worried I'm not scared about my battles that Satan's gonna try to bring me I know I got a meeting with another believer today I'm not scared about what's gonna happen because in my mind my mind is gird up I'm ready I'm calm I'm ready to do God's will my mind is calm see it's gird up it's ready I've studied I prayed I put this in the hand of God I fasted I did all these things I know I know I'm ready by God's grace hallelujah thank you lord feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace that's stand here I'll have you stand here just to make sure we finish soldiers feet so they had they had two things they had sandals that protect their foot here on top and the sides and the bottoms and then they have these Greaves that kind of connect are protected from like their ankle up to their knee you've seen them you know you're the pictures how they have those those metal plates the Bible describes goliaths Greaves so he had those big metal Greaves they're kind of thin of course you know thin metal that covered the legs so just as that they were protected their feet and legs were protected by sandals and Greaves to ensure their progress in traveling and in war like the last thing a soldier needs is to step on some thorns and then he can't fight because he can't walk so he's his walk his traveling and his war has to be protected so in the same way your daily try levels and your decisions because that's what we travel spiritually in our decisions right are made only after prayerful preparation produces God's peace in our hearts because it's the gospel of peace so your daily travels even where physically you know you chose to go to church at eight thank God for that why did you choose that because the peace of God led you into that right the Bible said feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace you had peace you it's been revealed to you I got to go to church I got a feed there I got to show God which side I'm on I got a report to the courthouse and I got to hear God's Word for today see your feet are shod your daily travels and your daily decisions are made with peace in your heart so that's what that's how that represents I believe because I put these scriptures together two more the shield of faith just as a soldier shield protects all the other pieces so the first floor we mentioned those four connected by this are protected by this one by faith so just as a shield protects the other four from the fiery arrows the Bible said so does faith which is a revelation right or assurance so faith in Christ completely protects a Christians armor by extinguishing or stifling every falsehood Satan shoots from the bow of his lying tongue right so your daily travels your daily decisions of a peace your helmet of salvation your breastplate your righteousness your girdle of truth all those mined areas all that peace in mind and salvation it's all protected by faith or revelation of God God's revealed to me the word and that's what easily extinguishes all those fiery attacks of Satan all those lies so church the next time we get a lie we got to say no devil it's thus saith the Lord God is my healer he says he tries to say you're gonna die or you're sick let that shield of faith that says by His stripes I'm healed let that extinguish every fiery dart of the devil amen because it's thus saith the Lord the Word of God hallelujah lastly just as a soldier sword was his main offensive and lethal weapon the Word of God spoken through a Christians mouth will resist wound and even bruise the devil eventually putting to flight his evil forces see if you speak long enough if you and I quote the word long enough pretty soon the devil's gonna go it took Jesus three hacks it Satan to make him go in Matthew chapter 4 3 good attacks and Satan after that he left him for a season and that's what I put right there remember when Christ comes back to the earth at Armageddon a sword of judgment comes out of his mouth to smite the nation's so Church I'll just skip this what's our only hope our hope is to have the full armor of God you have the Lord tonight Malachi Niemann once you come here I thought that'd be good for us to see those things last time times and seasons are mentioned for the bride here he says you don't have need of that when you live when you and I live a righteous life a life of godliness and obedience with the full armor of god on we're not going to be surprised we're gonna be ready for us coming how many want to be ready for the coming of christ with the full armor of god on now think about your armor today let's look let's bow our heads and pray about that if we're not able to withstand lies or temptations it's because we let down the armor right Paul clearly says that us who are of the day must be sober calm we can take a deep breath in the morning when we pray say Lord with calm confidence I'm putting on the full armor of God what a hope that we have Church now with your head bowed has Satan attacked you this week about your character if so let's put on the breastplate of righteousness as you tried to make you feel bad about your character how about your helmet of salvation have you down to your salvation this week if so there's a helmet that we can put on phrase God if you had lots of mind battles and you haven't felt ready to take on these mind battles well then by God's grace let's go to our loins about with truth let's get that skirt tucked in there right let's get ready to do something for the Lord ministry in our minds have we made decisions with peace in our hearts that we made daily travels with the peace of God in our hearts in each of us say we've had peace and the decisions we made this week I'm trusting the Holy Spirit to speak to each person here I hope you are too have you felt that you've got burned by one of Satan's fiery arrows it's burned you and maybe we're holding up the shield of faith like you you needed to it's time to let the Holy Spirit heal that right that fiery wound and hold that shield up with strength and lastly the sword of the Spirit amen I'm holding up the sword right now in the Bible praise God do you just feel like the Satan's been hanging around and hasn't left you and you need to use that sword of the Spirit amen glory and you can go using the sword tonight by God's grace how many raise your hands say brother just pray for me that I need one of those pieces of armor let me put that on God bless those names raise the north let me pray for you here tonight Heavenly Father my hands are up to Lord God or what I felt like I had a really victorious week Lord but I could see a few times I got tired of Lord I felt like I fell from the glory of God little bit Lord so father I pray for those hands that were raised and Lord you see my hands to mourn and I'd like to do that tomorrow Lord if you'd help me remember I like to pray and put on every piece of armor Lord God amen no doubt Lord I felt like I've been doing that for years but I never really took the time to specifically pray for each one dear God so what I pray for your people Lord God I pray for these Saints who have come out to the house of God Lord that you would help them to put on the breastplate of righteousness Lord that they'd be protected from Satan's attacks on their character that they put on the helmet of salvation they've had that hope that they are saved Lord God their minds would be ready and gird about with truth their feet and their steps and decisions would be made in peace dear God and O God that they'd hold up that shield of faith and extinguish Satan's fiery lies Lord they drive back Satan with the sword of the word it is written it is written the Word of God says this may they resist Satan with the sword of the Spirit hallelujah thank you for it Lord God I thank you for bringing it to my attention this week lord I hadn't really place that together how only those with the full armor of God on will be ready for the rapture Oh God let us be ready let's be children of the day Oh God let us be sitting at our post of duty we'd say on our porches Lord just waiting for your coming Lord God looking to the
