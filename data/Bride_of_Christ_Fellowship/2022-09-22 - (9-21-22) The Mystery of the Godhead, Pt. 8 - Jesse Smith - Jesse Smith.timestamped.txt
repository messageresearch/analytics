[0:00] your Bibles here
[0:06] hold my verse here
[0:12] let's go let's start with Ephesians 3
[0:14] verse 9. we'll just start there
[0:16] the grace of God
[0:17] you see the Saints and how's the Lord
[0:19] tonight
[0:21] you know just having a few extra people
[0:23] here on Wednesday night makes it feel
[0:24] like it's pretty bad you know
[0:26] so we're thankful for all the saints
[0:28] coming out to the house of the Lord
[0:29] tonight praise God
[0:31] it's good to seeing those old-time songs
[0:33] ain't no brother William pretty good
[0:34] buddy huh takes me back 20 years too
[0:37] Hallelujah
[0:40] thank you Jesus
[0:43] that sounds kind of funny started out
[0:45] traveling many years ago like I was
[0:47] traveling many years ago
[0:50] 20 years many years
[0:53] so let's look here Ephesians 3 verse
[0:56] Nina you know as as I'm preaching
[0:58] through this chapter here coming down to
[1:00] the end of it and I kind of close this
[1:02] chapter with the rewards for receiving
[1:04] the Revelation and then also the
[1:06] consequences for rejecting the
[1:08] revelation
[1:09] I kind of end every chapter that way
[1:12] and that's true you know the mystery of
[1:15] God is available to all
[1:16] it's available to everyone
[1:18] but those who receive it get a special
[1:20] reward those who turn it down they have
[1:22] to suffer the consequence because all
[1:24] the mysteries of God are finished how
[1:25] many believe that
[1:26] Mr God had to be finished and then it
[1:28] had to be taken around the world
[1:30] right like Revelation chapter 10 says so
[1:32] if it's available then there have to be
[1:34] rewards for those who accept it but
[1:36] there's also has to be consequences to
[1:38] them who reject it
[1:41] and remember like I was telling uh I
[1:43] think I was telling maokai that this
[1:45] week
[1:46] you know we have this confidence all
[1:48] that the father has given me will come
[1:50] to me
[1:51] Jesus Christ promised Satan cannot
[1:53] snatch one out of the father's hand
[1:56] all those that are predestinated for
[1:58] known they will be saved
[2:01] in other words we have confidence
[2:03] we can't make anybody lost praise God
[2:05] and we can't save anybody
[2:07] we can preach in water and we can plant
[2:09] the seed but God gives the increase
[2:11] praise God that's up to him so may God
[2:13] help us to spread these Revelations more
[2:15] and more by God's grace
[2:17] Ephesians 3 verse 9.
[2:20] here is the first reward of knowing the
[2:23] godhead it's fellowship with Christ
[2:26] that's the first reward
[2:28] we looked at it on Wednesday remember it
[2:30] was last Wednesday it was communion
[2:32] well the ram said in John 17 what did
[2:34] Jesus want more than anything else he
[2:36] wanted your fellowship
[2:37] he wanted your prayers
[2:39] he wants you to pour out your heart to
[2:41] him
[2:41] he wanted your Praises he wanted you
[2:43] wanted your thanksgivings
[2:45] he wanted to know the secrets of your
[2:46] heart
[2:48] praise God he wants our fellowship this
[2:51] is a great
[2:52] this is a great mystery the Bible says
[2:53] let's read this again on three one two
[2:55] three and to make all men see what is
[2:59] the Fellowship of the mystery which from
[3:02] the beginning of the world hath been hid
[3:04] in God who created All Things by Jesus
[3:08] Christ now keep your Bible there let's
[3:09] go to Colossians chapter 2 verse 2.
[3:13] Colossians 2 verse 2.
[3:17] Fellowship there means intimacy
[3:19] so those who receive Paul's Revelation
[3:21] had a fellowship had an intimacy of the
[3:25] mystery
[3:26] there's an intimacy of knowing god when
[3:29] you receive a mystery the veil is on the
[3:32] veil is taken off and now you see it
[3:34] plainly
[3:35] praise God that's the whole point of a
[3:37] mystery it's hiding something but then
[3:39] when the veil is removed now what's
[3:41] what's behind the veil is exposed in
[3:44] this case it's our Lord Jesus Christ
[3:46] Hallelujah hiding behind the veil of
[3:48] Flesh
[3:50] thank God it was God hiding behind there
[3:52] the whole time
[3:53] Hallelujah
[3:55] Colossians 2 verse two this scripture of
[3:57] course says this this acknowledges the
[3:59] mystery of the notice the father and of
[4:01] Christ don't say the mystery of the Holy
[4:02] Ghost that's that's Christ in you the
[4:04] hope of glory that's another mystery
[4:05] this is the mystery of the father and
[4:07] the son
[4:08] I'll read this myself that their hearts
[4:10] might be comforted being knit together
[4:11] in love and unto all Riches of the full
[4:13] Assurance of understanding to the
[4:15] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[4:18] of the father and
[4:21] let's have one more word of prayer ask
[4:22] God to anoint us here preach his work
[4:25] to give us understanding how many want
[4:27] to grow in Revelation here tonight grow
[4:28] in understanding grow in Grace and
[4:30] knowledge of the Lord
[4:31] knowledge we know the world even knows
[4:33] knowledge is power
[4:34] knowledge is understanding understanding
[4:37] that we're free understanding that doors
[4:38] can be open to us understanding that
[4:40] there's an intimacy there's a fellowship
[4:42] we can have with Christ
[4:44] Heavenly Father Lord we just lift our
[4:46] hearts to you father God I pray you
[4:47] speak to every heart anoint me God
[4:48] anoint your people we're happy to be in
[4:50] this place here tonight father God we
[4:52] want to know you and we want to make you
[4:53] known dear God so father use us God For
[4:56] Your Glory dear God I pray you
[4:58] strengthen every heart God ministered
[4:59] everyone if someone's not saved me they
[5:01] get saved someone's not Sanctified may
[5:03] they get Sanctified someone's not filled
[5:04] with the Holy Ghost man they get filled
[5:05] with the Holy Ghost if someone's
[5:07] discouraged may they be encouraged
[5:08] Hallelujah if someone's depressed may
[5:10] they be set free from that Lord God may
[5:12] they be joyful again in the Lord we ask
[5:15] for your mercies and Grace in this
[5:16] service in Jesus Christ's name and the
[5:18] saint said amen God bless you with your
[5:20] BNC to praise God
[5:24] Hallelujah
[5:27] so let's look at this uh be part eight
[5:28] of the godhead mystery like I said I'm
[5:30] preaching right through the uh the
[5:31] chapter that the Lord had me uh write
[5:33] you know I was looking at a someone sent
[5:36] me a card a few months ago in the mail a
[5:38] woman uh
[5:39] I'll just say her name first name is
[5:40] Laura and uh
[5:43] she's been so blessed by that uh 12
[5:45] mystery book she said all my life I just
[5:47] wondered how she said how could how
[5:49] could I understand the ministry of
[5:50] brother Branham and she said when I read
[5:52] your book it gave me a framework and a
[5:54] foundation to understand brother
[5:55] branham's Ministry in the Bible
[5:58] so she said now I'm going through it a
[6:00] second time
[6:01] she said now I feel like I can
[6:02] understand all the scriptures that the
[6:04] message point of this team I thought
[6:06] that was beautiful to see that you know
[6:07] uh and that right there is the
[6:09] revelation God gave to me you know that
[6:10] this is how when I come to the message I
[6:13] come by the Bible you know and everybody
[6:14] can come a different way you know but I
[6:16] came I just sat at the at the Bible
[6:19] study I just listened and Jesus Christ
[6:21] became real to me praise God through the
[6:23] scripture and then I asked when I heard
[6:25] these Revelations I asked where did you
[6:27] get that and they said from a prophet
[6:28] named William Brandt praise God and so
[6:31] my framework to know this message was
[6:33] the Bible First
[6:34] other people might have known it uh uh
[6:36] brother random first and that can be
[6:38] okay too
[6:39] which either side you come in you got to
[6:41] have the right balance by God's grace
[6:43] you have to be balanced and we have to
[6:45] find our balance in the scriptures
[6:46] praise God
[6:48] so I'm thankful uh tonight by God's
[6:50] grace so this chapter ends with three
[6:52] rewards we have for receiving the
[6:55] revelation of the godhead we get three
[6:56] rewards that at least I can find a
[6:58] scripture no doubt there's more but as I
[7:01] was studying and looking at all these
[7:02] scriptures on the godhead three came to
[7:04] me most clearly the first is that we
[7:06] know God intimately because God wants to
[7:10] be known
[7:11] the Bible said he's near to every one of
[7:13] us
[7:14] how many believe that
[7:15] he's near he is within distance of
[7:18] touching him how do you believe that
[7:20] spiritually
[7:21] spiritually you can touch you can
[7:23] contact the Holy Spirit today
[7:25] a lot of people don't know that and God
[7:27] is so far away no it's only your sins
[7:29] that have grieved him far away
[7:32] but really he's not that far if you just
[7:34] repent and change your ways the Bible
[7:36] said he'll turn back to you praise God
[7:38] I'm reading through Jeremiah now and he
[7:40] just says that over and over again thus
[7:41] saith the Lord Return To Me O Israel and
[7:43] I'll return to you
[7:44] over and over again thus saith the Lord
[7:46] thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord
[7:47] return to me praise God and I'll return
[7:50] to you Hallelujah it's a great promise
[7:53] that God has you know uh you know even
[7:54] some of us who can serve God for decades
[7:56] right we get through difficult times we
[7:58] feel like God's so far away but actually
[8:00] it's the opposite is true God is very
[8:02] close to us praise God
[8:04] if we're sitting and yes we just got to
[8:06] repent and then the Holy Spirit
[8:07] Fellowship comes back
[8:09] but sometimes you know we're just going
[8:11] through a dark place we're just being
[8:13] tested sometimes
[8:15] and but God wants us to remember that
[8:17] he's with us in the valley just like
[8:19] he's with us on the Mountaintop praise
[8:21] God he wants us to know him he wants us
[8:24] to experience a loss sometimes and
[8:26] discouragement and difficult times so in
[8:29] those times we'll understand Christ
[8:31] better we'll learn to lean upon him
[8:33] we'll learn to talk to him in the hard
[8:34] times just like we can rejoice and
[8:36] praise him in the good times amen
[8:38] coming to know him and and being
[8:40] intimate with him in every season of our
[8:43] life praise God
[8:44] this is the first benefit of knowing
[8:46] there's one person that God had not
[8:48] three persons in the godhead Hallelujah
[8:51] so you church we I'll say like this
[8:53] you're hearing the message when we were
[8:54] really born again we're the only group
[8:56] in the world that has True Fellowship
[8:58] with God
[9:00] I know that's a a difficult statement
[9:02] sometimes for some people to believe but
[9:03] it's the truth
[9:05] in fact the closest group I know
[9:07] uh to our Revelation is the Oneness
[9:09] Pentecostals now years ago my wife
[9:11] remembered this we John Graham and I we
[9:13] fellowship with this man named Paul do
[9:15] you remember that one is preacher Paul
[9:16] and his wife remember his wife's name I
[9:18] can't remember her name either they
[9:19] dress just like us they talk just like
[9:22] us they had Bible studies they sang Just
[9:24] Like Us they come to our service a
[9:25] couple times Paul and Elizabeth there it
[9:27] is
[9:29] but one that had a few things off you
[9:31] know she had high heels on they're kind
[9:33] of high heels you know
[9:35] and they didn't and they didn't they
[9:36] they what was it
[9:38] they trim their hair that's right hung
[9:40] hair but trim the very ends of it
[9:42] what was it oh it was short too yeah
[9:43] some of them had short hair too but they
[9:45] believe in one person one person the
[9:46] godhead but we could you know when we
[9:48] talked John and I you know it was always
[9:50] boiled down to these few points we just
[9:52] couldn't agree on and and uh and when it
[9:54] came to brother round they just said
[9:55] flatly no he's not a prophet
[9:58] but that but they had no TVs they had no
[10:01] TVs they didn't go to movies they were
[10:03] they were just living holy their
[10:04] favorite part of the week was church
[10:06] just like ours
[10:08] uh they love to Shout Scream they dance
[10:10] they spoke in tongues they had all these
[10:12] blessings Miracles like we have praise
[10:14] God
[10:15] but we couldn't agree they couldn't go
[10:17] as far as we could in the word of God
[10:19] they couldn't accept in other words they
[10:21] couldn't accept Revelation 10 7. ah it's
[10:24] the verse the scripture they couldn't
[10:25] accept praise God
[10:27] they couldn't see they couldn't accept
[10:28] Malachi four five and six
[10:31] they couldn't accept Luke 17 30. but you
[10:34] and I can receive it praise God
[10:36] Hallelujah and that brings us a greater
[10:39] knowing these things in brother matters
[10:41] Ministry and and these other Bible
[10:42] teachings it gives us a greater intimacy
[10:45] with God
[10:46] it does
[10:48] it has to because there's effects to not
[10:51] obeying all the word of God
[10:54] Hallelujah
[10:56] and it's just like Jesus when he was uh
[11:00] on Earth here
[11:01] uh he was amongst Hebrews and they were
[11:03] strict monotheists right
[11:07] so much so that he told the woman at the
[11:08] well the Samaritan woman he said we are
[11:10] Jews and we know what we worship
[11:14] in other words the Jews were not
[11:15] guessing is he two persons is he three
[11:17] persons they knew who they were
[11:20] worshiping amen and that's how we are
[11:22] that's what that's what makes us so
[11:24] different than trinitarian churches we
[11:26] know who we're worshiping amen it's one
[11:28] God manifested in three ways praise God
[11:32] and there's only one remaining
[11:33] mysterious part it's the plural pronouns
[11:36] of we and us with Jesus and the father
[11:38] that's the only remaining mystery but
[11:41] that speaks of multiple manifestations
[11:42] and how Jesus body is a different
[11:44] manifestation than life it's a different
[11:46] manifestation than a rock in the
[11:48] wilderness that body is a different
[11:50] manifestation than all the other
[11:51] manifestations praise God so it needs a
[11:54] separate pronoun but it doesn't mean
[11:56] it's two persons it means one person who
[11:58] has a special mask on Amen he's got a
[12:01] special Veil it's the Mighty God
[12:03] unavailable for us now praise God
[12:07] we see the Mighty God behind the body of
[12:09] Jesus Christ praise God
[12:11] we don't see a second person but we see
[12:13] a mighty God unveiled behind the body of
[12:16] Jesus Christ
[12:18] if the body of Jesus Christ is a once in
[12:20] a once in a lifetime or once in a a
[12:22] creation manifestation there's never
[12:25] been a body like his and there'll never
[12:27] be a body like his
[12:28] how do you believe that
[12:30] so that's the last remaining mystery is
[12:33] how there can be plural pronouns
[12:36] so the Jews were not guessing and church
[12:38] we're not guessing
[12:40] God is one person and we know him
[12:43] intimately through his word
[12:46] you know my wife and I were talking and
[12:47] remember brother Adam said he said I may
[12:48] not know the book very well but I know
[12:50] the author real well if you look at the
[12:52] context though he's talking about
[12:54] doctors of divinity
[12:55] but now church let me ask you who knew
[12:57] the Bible more a doctor of divinity or
[12:59] brother random
[13:01] think about that before you say anything
[13:04] brother man was being humble brother I
[13:06] was saying I don't know the Greek or the
[13:08] Hebrew he said but he's got the
[13:10] revelation of the written word
[13:12] hallelujah amen
[13:14] so let me say that is brother Ram knew
[13:16] the author real well because he knew the
[13:18] word real well Hallelujah that's what
[13:20] the Bible says it says Paul says all
[13:22] scripture is given to us for profitable
[13:24] for Doctrine and godliness and Holiness
[13:26] that the man of God and women of God may
[13:29] be thoroughly refurbished unto every
[13:31] good work praise God
[13:33] swerve people that we're not we're not
[13:35] educated by denomination We're Not
[13:37] educated by doctor degrees but we know
[13:39] God his character we know this we know
[13:42] the author real well and by this time 57
[13:44] years after Brothers been off the scene
[13:46] we ought to know the Bible real well
[13:48] amen Hallelujah that's right church we
[13:52] ought to know both really well
[13:53] and I'm contending brother Brown was
[13:55] being humble when he was saying that but
[13:56] he really knew the Bible well then more
[13:58] than they did too
[14:00] he's making the point I don't have a
[14:01] doctorate degree but I know Jesus Christ
[14:05] but I'll take brother random sermons any
[14:06] day over a doctorate degree
[14:08] Hallelujah
[14:11] remember Jesus said the father is
[14:13] seeking true worshipers in other words
[14:15] intimate worshipers
[14:17] not flirters
[14:19] the church said
[14:22] many people that go to church are just
[14:24] flirting with Jesus they're not giving
[14:25] him all their love
[14:27] all their worship all their time all
[14:30] their emotion
[14:31] they just serve God for what the
[14:33] blessings
[14:34] but when it comes down to sin they
[14:36] really love sin more than they love the
[14:38] things of God because they keep doing
[14:40] sin instead of crucifying sin
[14:43] Hallelujah
[14:44] that's right
[14:46] so God is looking for true worshipers
[14:48] and you can see this you know plainly
[14:50] against trinitarians you know they
[14:52] sprinkle instead of fully immersed in
[14:54] water and there's not one verse in the
[14:55] Bible that says sprinkle
[14:56] there's not one
[14:58] not even one
[15:00] they call God upon titles fathers and
[15:02] Holy Ghost rather than his name and they
[15:05] bless themselves with a sign of a cross
[15:07] and holy water I'm talking about Roman
[15:08] Catholic stuff or yeah
[15:10] but as you worship God's one person
[15:13] you're like Abel bringing the correct
[15:15] acceptable sacrifices and the
[15:17] trinitarians or the uh even I'll say the
[15:20] Oneness that have worldly things they're
[15:22] bringing sacrifices on their own
[15:24] choosing like Cain
[15:26] now some of them can be saved I'm not
[15:28] putting them all lost but Jesus said
[15:31] very few there be that find it oh we
[15:33] ought to be thankful that we're one of
[15:35] those few
[15:36] Hallelujah that found the true worship
[15:38] that our true worshipers that do not add
[15:42] to the word of God but just read the
[15:44] word of God accept it believe it and
[15:46] live by it praise God
[15:48] that's the first the first benefit is
[15:51] you get intimacy with God
[15:53] he gives you true communion as we said
[15:55] last week you don't have to set your
[15:56] timer well let me pray 10 minutes to the
[15:58] father now pray 10 minutes to the Sun
[16:00] and then I'll I'll pray 10 minutes of
[16:02] the Holy Spirit
[16:04] you don't got to do that church you have
[16:05] to worry about that because the the
[16:07] Bible makes it plain pull up first John
[16:08] 1 3.
[16:11] pull up first John 1 3.
[16:14] you'd have to wonder who you're
[16:16] fellowshipping with the Bible says truly
[16:18] our fellowship is with the father and
[16:20] with his son Jesus Christ amen
[16:22] hallelujah Jesus said when you see me
[16:25] you've seen the father praise God
[16:28] Hallelujah pull up uh Matthew 11 27.
[16:32] When You Believe on Jesus Christ he
[16:35] reveals the father Jesus is the image of
[16:38] the invisible God hallelujah and of
[16:41] course when you know the father you know
[16:42] the holy spirit because the holy spirit
[16:44] is the father praise God
[16:47] well let Matthew 11 27 all things are
[16:49] delivered unto me and my father and no
[16:51] man knoweth the son but the father
[16:52] neither knoweth any man the father save
[16:55] the son and he to whomsoever the son
[16:58] will reveal him so when we come to know
[17:00] Jesus as the high priest when we pray to
[17:02] Jesus in heaven we're actually
[17:04] contacting the father
[17:06] but we've got to go through the high
[17:07] priest Glory just like in the the holy
[17:10] the holiest of holies you got to go
[17:11] through the high priest had to go
[17:13] through he was the one interceding unto
[17:15] God praise God and that's how Jesus says
[17:18] we go through Jesus to the invisible
[17:20] Immortal spirit of God can everybody see
[17:23] that by God's grace in other words when
[17:25] you pray to Jesus you're really praying
[17:26] to the father praise God but in your
[17:28] prayers you might be speaking to the
[17:31] high priest side of Jesus
[17:32] but then there are times there might be
[17:34] times you're speaking to the god side
[17:36] the invisible side of Jesus
[17:39] in other words the god side doesn't the
[17:42] the spirit side the god side can't feel
[17:44] the infirmities
[17:46] are you with me now
[17:47] the god side the invisible side wasn't
[17:49] crucified you can't crucify a spirit but
[17:53] the man's side the The Human Side the
[17:55] Jesus side the high free side that's the
[17:57] sign that can be touched by the feeling
[17:59] of orange he's praise God you understand
[18:04] you have a human Human Side now it's
[18:06] divinely human now it's is glorified
[18:08] human side but you got the other side
[18:10] that the invisible spirit that side was
[18:13] not crucified that side uh never died it
[18:16] can never die praise God
[18:18] but when we pray the Bible tells us to
[18:20] come to Father through the son
[18:23] that's why we call on Jesus because
[18:25] Jesus knows what it's like to battle
[18:28] you can say like this Jesus knows what
[18:30] it's like to be tempted and the Bible
[18:32] said then he wants to secure you he
[18:34] wants to help you in your hour of
[18:36] Temptation amen
[18:38] because he can feel it he understands
[18:40] that he knows what it's like to be
[18:42] tempted the man's eye Jesus
[18:45] is that right
[18:47] Hallelujah go to Ephesians 2 18. this is
[18:51] a benefit that we have
[18:53] it's not two separate persons but it's
[18:55] crying out to the one person of God and
[18:58] when you cry to that one person you have
[19:00] access both to the human side and the
[19:02] Divine side
[19:04] Glory look at this
[19:06] for through him we have both access by
[19:10] one Spirit unto the father
[19:12] oh Hallelujah
[19:14] we have access
[19:16] we have a channel to the father
[19:19] through Jesus amen
[19:21] Hallelujah that's why we'll pray
[19:23] heavenly father will pray Lord Jesus we
[19:25] can pray right to the Lord Jesus we can
[19:26] say great High priests
[19:29] and the guests guess who's praying on
[19:30] the inside of us the Holy Spirit
[19:33] the Holy Spirit the Bible says by the
[19:34] spirit we're praying the spirit of God
[19:36] is moving us
[19:38] and it's moving us to pray to Jesus and
[19:40] then and then as as we as we break into
[19:43] the revelation of prayer then we start
[19:44] speaking we have access to that eternal
[19:46] spirit praise God in that something you
[19:49] got the eternal spirit in you and then
[19:50] you're praying to the eternal spirit ah
[19:53] it's a great mystery amen
[19:55] that's like Jesus he was in The Garden
[19:57] of Gethsemane the spirit of God was in
[19:59] him but yet he's praying to the spirit
[20:00] of God
[20:01] is that right but it's a great
[20:04] Revelation it's a great mystery
[20:07] and this can only be done through the
[20:09] great high priest so let's go to Hebrews
[20:11] 4 14.
[20:14] this might encourage you here tonight
[20:15] this is the intimacy
[20:20] 4 14. seeing then that we have this
[20:23] great high priest that is passed into
[20:24] the heavens Jesus the son of God let us
[20:27] hold fast our profession verse 15.
[20:30] for we have not in a high priest which
[20:32] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[20:33] our infirmities this is what I was
[20:35] saying earlier the Eternal and miserable
[20:36] Spirit has no infirmities
[20:39] it can't
[20:40] God's spirit cannot feel that
[20:43] but Jesus's body did
[20:45] but Jesus was in all points tempted like
[20:47] we as we are yet without sin next verse
[20:51] 16. let us therefore how should we pray
[20:54] then come boldly in your prayers before
[20:56] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[20:58] mercy and find Grace to help in the time
[21:01] of need
[21:02] that's why church we can pray like Lord
[21:04] Jesus Lord I'm really struggling right
[21:06] now I know you I know you can understand
[21:07] what it's like to struggle and to face
[21:10] Temptation I know you can feel it Lord
[21:12] help me and then you'll then sometimes
[21:14] you'll feel the spirit of God come back
[21:16] upon you and strengthen you and give you
[21:17] Victory what happened you went to God
[21:19] through the high priest
[21:21] and the high priest made an intercession
[21:23] to God for you praise God and the spirit
[21:26] of God comes back and answers your
[21:28] prayer and you get the power of the
[21:30] spirit of God you become stronger
[21:31] because you went through the right
[21:33] channel amen you went through the one
[21:35] who could understand your feelings
[21:37] understand your struggles and then the
[21:39] Bible said then you had access to the
[21:41] father
[21:42] oh my so we go through the son to the
[21:45] father and the church said
[21:48] that's why you must that's why sometimes
[21:50] we can pray Heavenly Father Like Jesus
[21:51] we go right to the father but sometimes
[21:53] uh we pray to the high priest the Lord
[21:55] Jesus
[21:57] Christ what did Stephen pray to when he
[21:58] was getting stoned he said Lord Jesus
[21:59] receive my spirit he went right to the
[22:01] high priest
[22:02] right
[22:03] he could understand right Jesus could
[22:05] understand about being martyred
[22:07] it's even right there he said Lord Jesus
[22:09] receive my spirit lay this not to their
[22:11] charge
[22:12] and it and Jesus could feel that because
[22:15] Jesus said father forgive them they
[22:16] don't know what they're doing praise God
[22:20] so see Church we've got to pray as we're
[22:22] LED and we've got to pray not feeling
[22:24] condemned well I pray to that one or
[22:26] that one
[22:27] the Bible tells us we have access to the
[22:30] father through the Holy Spirit and we
[22:32] must come boldly to the high priest amen
[22:35] oh my it's beautiful this is intimacy
[22:37] that we have
[22:40] thank you Lord now think about that
[22:42] church think about Catholics I went to
[22:43] uh Brother Ray I went to a a Catholic
[22:46] funeral about a month or two ago
[22:47] they did just as much talking to Mary as
[22:49] it did Jesus
[22:51] see because their intimacy is perverted
[22:55] they have intimacy with Mary they've
[22:57] intimacy with uh Saint James and
[22:59] different James saints that they go to
[23:01] look at their loving their intercessing
[23:03] through all these different channels but
[23:05] we got one channel praise God
[23:07] we've got we've only got intimacy with
[23:09] one person that's the Lord Jesus praise
[23:11] God
[23:12] there's one mediator between God and man
[23:15] the man Christ Jesus amen not a woman
[23:18] praise God not another man not another
[23:19] Saint no man was worthy only Christ was
[23:22] worthy praise God
[23:25] that's why we go to Christ through
[23:26] prayer
[23:29] Glory
[23:31] see since we have great access to the
[23:33] father how many glad for that access
[23:36] sometimes church I've seen this I've
[23:38] said such humble
[23:39] I'd say weak prayers and yet God has
[23:41] answered some of them
[23:44] anybody can say Amen to that with me in
[23:45] here I didn't maybe pray as long as I
[23:48] should have I was too tired to praise
[23:50] but yet God still heard my prayer why
[23:53] because Jesus knows what it's like to be
[23:55] tired
[23:56] right and he can be touched by your
[23:58] tired prayer but see the thing he loves
[24:00] is your prayer amen the thing he loves
[24:02] is your fellowship praise God the thing
[24:04] he loved is that at least you're trying
[24:06] at least you're reaching out to him
[24:07] you're not going to the the bottle of
[24:09] alcohol you're not going to the
[24:10] cigarette pack you're going to heaven
[24:12] praise God Amen
[24:14] in your dark hour and your our
[24:16] Temptation where do you go you don't go
[24:18] to the world you go to Christ Jesus you
[24:20] go to the high priest because he ever
[24:22] lives to help you he ever lives to make
[24:24] intercession for you
[24:26] that's why he lives amen and because he
[24:28] lives we can face tomorrow right
[24:31] Hallelujah
[24:32] that first reward is intimacy that the
[24:35] trinitarians and even the Oneness don't
[24:37] know about
[24:39] because when we saw them when we saw
[24:41] them cut their hair what did that that
[24:42] shamed their husbands and then that
[24:44] shames Christ
[24:47] so they cannot have the same intimacy
[24:49] that we have
[24:51] and we're not bragging but we're just
[24:53] looking at what the scripture says
[24:55] because the Bible says if we brag or
[24:56] boasts what uh we know Pride goes before
[24:58] the fall right we start bragging we're
[25:00] the greatest of all time watch that
[25:01] watch people that do that Pride goes
[25:04] before the fall
[25:05] some some fall will come
[25:09] no that's the first reward second reward
[25:13] Is possessing God's power
[25:16] now this ought to be a reality for us
[25:18] praise God and I know it is some of us
[25:20] might be going through difficult times
[25:21] now but think back when the you knew the
[25:24] power of God was moving in your life
[25:27] like right now brother amen just got a
[25:28] fresh touch right sister they were
[25:29] testifying that on Sunday right
[25:32] a fresh move of the Holy Spirit In Our
[25:34] Lives praise God
[25:36] Jesus Promised with the Revelation that
[25:40] he was the Messiah the gates of hell
[25:42] would not Prevail against this
[25:44] revelation
[25:46] praise God
[25:48] and let me ask you was Jesus promised to
[25:50] Peter true or not
[25:53] how did everything it could to bring
[25:56] down Peter
[25:58] it brought swords right abroad Roman
[26:01] soldiers on the night of Jesus arrest
[26:04] right it brought a mob against him it
[26:07] brought Satan brought fear against Peter
[26:11] it brought a little woman and and he had
[26:13] to he had to stand there and deny that
[26:15] evil he said I promise I give an oath I
[26:17] don't even know the man I swear I don't
[26:19] even know him
[26:20] I swear by Jehovah you don't know
[26:22] Jehovah look at that
[26:25] the greatest thing we can swear by is by
[26:26] God right we shouldn't swear the Bible
[26:27] says but he swears he gives the oath I
[26:30] don't know him
[26:31] did hell Prevail against him though no
[26:34] hell didn't Prevail against him
[26:37] he didn't give up he didn't sell out
[26:39] Christ
[26:40] now I love the part of this when he
[26:42] heard that Crow the third time he
[26:44] went away and wept praise God
[26:46] we don't find Judas doing that Judas
[26:49] didn't go away and sleep or I'm sorry
[26:50] we'd rather but Peter was humble right
[26:53] he knew he remembered all the
[26:55] experiences with God and he would not
[26:57] forsake Jesus all the way yes he forsook
[27:00] him in that moment but he wasn't totally
[27:02] defeated praise God Amen Jesus knew in
[27:05] three short days I'm going to encourage
[27:07] you I'm going to lift you up church that
[27:09] we can just wait a few more days amen if
[27:11] we can just learn to wait another week
[27:12] wait another month wait another year
[27:14] keep waiting on God the gates of hell
[27:17] can never Prevail against you amen
[27:20] Hallelujah
[27:21] no matter what Satan brings the councils
[27:24] of hell no matter what he brings you
[27:26] know a band of soldiers in Peter's case
[27:29] the fear of death and arrest whatever
[27:32] Satan could bring against him it could
[27:34] not Prevail against him he might have
[27:36] lost a few battles but he didn't lose
[27:38] the war praise God
[27:41] see
[27:42] that's the power so Judas he had access
[27:45] to this power but he turned it down he
[27:47] forsook this power
[27:49] said his name
[27:51] was on the Lamb's Book of Life
[27:54] but then Brothers said your name can
[27:56] never be removed off the Lamb's Book of
[27:57] Life That's the recent video I made but
[28:02] in other words brother and I said Judas
[28:03] had real faith
[28:05] but then he forsook it by transgression
[28:07] and his name was removed from The Book
[28:09] of Life
[28:11] and if you want quotes on that let me
[28:13] know I'd be happy to share those with
[28:14] you my brother I was growing in his
[28:15] revelation
[28:16] he eventually realized what judas's name
[28:18] couldn't be on the last book of life
[28:19] because the names on the Lamb's Book of
[28:21] Life were written before the foundation
[28:23] of the world and they will not worship
[28:26] the Beast hallelujah amen in other words
[28:28] your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life
[28:30] praise God because God knew you wouldn't
[28:32] worship that Roman Catholic that
[28:34] denominational system that sin loving
[28:36] system that b system and said you would
[28:39] love the the godhead amen you would love
[28:41] Jesus Christ you would love the true
[28:43] kingdom of God hallelujah
[28:45] not the false church not the false
[28:47] Kingdom but the true kingdom of God
[28:49] built by Jesus Christ and Upon This Rock
[28:52] and upon this Revelation that Jesus is
[28:54] Messiah and like brother Adam said the
[28:56] greatest scripture on the godhead
[28:58] brother Adam said is Acts 2 37 the same
[29:02] God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ
[29:05] Amen brother said if you can't see God
[29:08] that Jesus and God in that scripture
[29:10] then you are blinded you can't see
[29:12] anything because Peter says he's both
[29:14] Lord and Messiah he's both God and
[29:17] Messiah he's both he's God and man
[29:19] Hallelujah
[29:22] you can't see Jesus of God in that
[29:24] scripture he says you have no hope
[29:27] because God has made Jesus both Lord of
[29:29] all and Christ
[29:31] Hallelujah
[29:35] see Church hell's councils will not
[29:37] Prevail against you even in your
[29:39] greatest failures
[29:41] because you've got the greatest
[29:43] revelation
[29:45] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[29:48] now don't raise your hands here but how
[29:49] many ever had a failure where you felt
[29:51] ashamed of yourself
[29:53] let's be honest all of our hands would
[29:56] figuratively be up right
[29:59] we've all felt like we failed God
[30:02] but have we failed like Peter
[30:05] have we publicly denied Christ three
[30:07] times no I'm not putting him down I'm
[30:09] not putting us above him I'm just saying
[30:10] think about the the difficulty think
[30:12] about the supposed failure that he had
[30:14] but yet God never gave up on it
[30:17] God's not going to give up on you Church
[30:20] you believe honey baby was the Messiah
[30:22] but who is the Messiah to be was he to
[30:24] be a second person or did Isaiah 9 6 say
[30:27] he was to be the Mighty God Amen
[30:30] the Prince of Peace Hallelujah the
[30:32] Everlasting father the Messiah was to be
[30:34] the Everlasting father one person Jesus
[30:37] Christ was both Lord and Christ amen
[30:41] see
[30:42] see the Gates of Hell will never Prevail
[30:45] against you when you have this
[30:45] revelation
[30:49] in other words
[30:51] idolatry will never take you that's why
[30:52] people that worship brother Branham or
[30:54] worship the tapes they cannot be born
[30:55] again
[30:56] because you're an idolater
[30:58] and idolatry has taken them over
[31:01] they're a slave they're chained to
[31:03] idolatry everywhere on the table is thus
[31:05] say the Lord and there's no mistakes
[31:07] prophets never make mistakes that's what
[31:09] thus saith the Lord that's not what
