Paul here he goes back universe for Jesus who are the Israelites who to whom pertain the adoption and the glory and the causes and the giving in the service of God and the promises why because he realized his people the Jews missed out on everything they were supposed to reach the adoption they were supposed to have all prop by his stripes or Edom what is that you ever been healed to last few thousand years we take it for granted every time we get sick pastor please pray for me lay your hands just speak the word I believe and we get healed yes when is the Jews ever been any tougher Lessing Jesus Christ all of it for 2,000 years they miss the entire thing look look at the first fourth of the scripture how many miracles were done by people yes only through prophets majority yes how many miracles how many Beckles I've had my life got a verse ii staff all day from here till midnight I tell you every single miracle that God has done through my little tiny life yes sir I see how about you how are you the Jews don't have this they have to go back they have to bypass the last 2,000 years and then start working to the last how many people were sealed in the Old Testament how many miracles and signs outside of Moses and Elijah and no it Enoch and all those great men of faith Abraham the body changed all those Ezekiel scenes visions if you were not a prophet you hardly even and the Gentiles have benefited for 2,000 years on the panel Jesus Christ number it was a real revelations one that Jesus Christ was not at the table of shewbread he was found in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks lorries right and Paul she is the revelation that were paul was given and they know the revelation of the mystery of the gentiles he said that what came by revelation I received this then I would be a life sent to the Gentiles but then after you realize that he hasn't open his eyes to look back to his people and said they are not gonna profit in all from this everything that was promised them their entire life [Applause] nothing and Paul is now broken a heart yes yes the service of God they don't even serve God right right they can't even say they're in the will of God right the promises who are the fathers of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came Christ and just bypass them and just go to the Jew Gentiles he went to the Jews yes yes but of course in Galatians 3 this is Paul point okay yes okay yes sir Glacius 3/6 even as a raven and god it's time for righteousness know he therefore that they are returned to face the same of the children traitor hand he says and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying and all he indeed shall all nations be blessed so here's st. Paul he does he's a broken heart my people he said by in the scripture the spirit foresaw all the way from the beginning just like we showed this morning Ephesians 5 that Paul is able to pull the jet it out right all the way back from Genesis every time you see you saturday the Bible in the Old Testament I guarantee a typewriter with the Jets house a man absolutely beautiful you know he says the skirts were foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith yes saw souls 27 all the ends of the world so remember and turn unto the Lord he says and all ginger the nation shall worship before that's good that includes everybody it solves 86-90 all nations who mousemaid shall come and worship before thee O Lord and shall glorify thy name all nations they may that's the Gentiles they met he says put our gray to do its wondrous things our God notice the Gentiles would the true Gentiles would understand God was one person even Hosea 2:23 Jesus I was so rude to get me in the earth and have mercy murder that's 19 mercy and I'll say to them which were not my people now are my people and they shall say that my god this is the Gentiles they prophesied all the way through scripture just some of the scriptures this was not something November when Christ came he came and died he shed his blood he rose up send out a spirit holy go see one Paul I want the disciples you want everybody and they go back and tell the Jews look the Gentiles and they do still could not see the Gentiles in the scriptures right right they were blown away look away Peter started preaching the holy ghost falls and the Jews like what but Paul Peter goes over to the scripture every time right there right there right every every there is right there yes sir yes - all could be I saved 96 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that surround the land of the shadow of death upon them the light shine it they man this is Gentile Gentile country Isaiah 42 verse 6 I the LORD of causing crisis and will hold on hand keep thee and give me a cover of peeple for a light unto the Gentiles event that was Paul was specifically a leg to the Gentiles he may I say the sixties arise shine for thy light has come amen sing to God who was that this is our day God showed up the logos fulfilling fires gonna pull the prophetess and now he's in the churches sure now in Matthew 3 verse 1 look at John the Baptist here John the Baptist he starts his ministry and he's preaching in the wilderness of Judea and look at his message in verse 2 he says repent for the kingdom of heaven that was the first message sent to what the Jews yeah absolutely just two more chapters we got on Jesus Christ in verse 12 now what Jesus heard that time was casting the print he departed into Galilee and look at verse 17 from that time Jesus began to preach you to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen what is the kingdom of heaven a lot John preached it and when he was the prison Jesus Christ picked up the same baton there of the kingdom has started running they may be and they eat more Tempe on Jesus guests now with his twelve disciples in Matthew 10 percent and he said go ye and preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen - room time the Baptist Jesus to this club disciples and the same exact same message he said but the kingdom of heaven is at hand a man this is the time because this is what this is the calling of the Lord amen the kingdom is a hot ready to get set up amen sure Morgan now what is the kingdom Luke 17 20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God sure come he answered says the kingdom of God come on now is our reservation [Applause] [Applause] Kingdom it's a spiritual Kingdom in boxes now what spiritual kings and priests what because Johnson I was in the kingdom as well right yeah now we've touched on this before about three years ago and then I touched on something I'm gonna come to RiRi just a little bit because I wanna get to my point Matthew 1310 president my favorite champion Matthew it contains 7 parables Jesus preached the first pair of perilous soul but now in verse 10 the what he says and the disciples came that why speakest now into parables verse 11 he said the answers of them because it is given up to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven is not given so these are mysteries to what the kingdom of heaven not to Old Testament law not to the Jews but the Holy Ghost right John Lurie now picking up a piece church age chapter 3 and as of as we go into the seventh the seven parallel center the blood pair rule is very specific the Regent Terrace is one that caught my eye right away as soon as I heard it and the profit of the church's book justice done teaching original sin and he just got done teaching on Paris or wheat and now look we said these illustrations depict perfectly the parable of the Lord Jesus Christ when he said that the kingdom of heaven was liken unto man who sowed good seed only to have his enemy common plant tares amongst those good seeds yes he's typing this parable he says it depicts perfect illustration of the original state he's all the way back in Genesis 3 yes he says only to heaven and me come and play tears among the good sees God did not pay the tears Satan planted those stairs right amongst the good scene of God those two key kinds of plants he says people from you different seeds grew up together so he's dealing with original sin but his original sin in the troop changes that's right right now that was my mindset up until two years ago three years ago three years ago when I reread the church's book that was my mindset that it only though that that that parable only meant original sin right now we're not gonna go into a deep but we're just gonna get it but then when I stumbled upon this quote right here at the end and the resume of the church ages he says no please let us be careful here this message to the church was if the evidence is not the message to the local actual local if he's in church huh he says is a message to the aged and then he says something and and that age had it the seed of truth and the seed of error exactly a set forth according to the peril of the wheat and tares and then when I read this next statement I stood my foot he says the church ages is the know 7 parables are what parable mysteries for what the kingdom of God those are specifically about the Gentile those parables are also types in the Old Testament original sin yes the heart all those things are tight pull in betray well Jesse find that powerful quote on the mustard see tree oh my goodness I wonder what that was for years and they were Jess's all brother and it's always found in the church right I went down to a certain place a year and a half ago with my wife for vacation what to sit at the service the brothers preaching he says he went to write Matthew 13 he says oh yeah he says that that that mustard seed he said that's faith he came he was teaching that was fate right even though that wasn't even know that that was actually the false church that's right must be careful in these things yes sir so here now we know these things are what the church changes now how do they understand now Matthew 13 right at the end of the seven Church ages all the parables I'm sorry at the seven parables Matthew 13 Jesus asked them Jesus whom have you understood all these things they said to him Yale or do you really think they understood or did they now here in Matthew 13 it says they said yes we understood how could they say that well it's recorded in mark and with many such parables Spanky the word unto Him as they were able to hear it with what I'll apparently speak out unto and when they were alone he expounded all things to his man they said yeah we understand why he put those recorded here he go back and now explain he made known to them yes Laurie how he said he expounded that means to explain to reveal know we have an expanding to write in our day this is our exponent Laurie brilliant future ooh revelations two and three and recite every scripture and break that down for me without reading this we have no idea without this message without these writings these commentary this exposition you don't even know beautiful what is what yeah yes right and this is books actually prophesied about leave the New Testament church did Josh would 18 they had crossed over now into the Promised Land Joshua 81 and the whole congregation of the children Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up a traveling with migration Aries and the land was subdued before them and they were made among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not receive their inheritance now why in the world would they be seven times y77 represents this retreats right seven represents the seven churches Gentile absolutely he said they're seven they're not receiving an inheritance looking verse three and Josh was in the children how long that don't slack to possess the land which the Lord God your father's has given amen and if we overcome every overcome and to overcome immense overcome overcome Layana she will [Applause] nore now in verse four give out that among you three men from each tribe and I will send them and they shall rise and go through and describe it according to hear them and they shall come again so he says pick three bad he says we go through these last for the land here he says come back isn't writing a description revelations it was given specifically fully by Jesus Christ yes and it was striped by John but the church changing wood was given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost the moving in the spirit by the Prophet the this came to the Prophet Jesus Christ brother william branham veil give me a description we're 60 B therefore describe the land into seven parts so huh amen he says and bring the description here to me and I make a story he says the Lord Jesus Christ probably Graham the teacher d-mail God used three men to bring forth yeah the very description yes he did revelation to the entire group revelation is all symbolic but this is a description yes - and show me exactly what the length is are not written there that's right they are but ahead to come forward at the right time that's right every deed the neglection is recorded right here that's right hot on a year before two years ago your handler yes yes and when the role men rose and went away Josh will charge them to describe the land go through and walk through the land describe it coming to me and I can't stop before you before the Lord China visas and the man went past land and described it by cities layer Asiya Uncas is a tire under Smyrna Pergamum Philadelphia he says my cities into a seven parts and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh mercy hi hallelujah okay brother that's pretty nice but let's follow those seven tribes Joshua tea lemon and the last of the tribe of the children Benjamin used the first tribe wedding God is land Joshua 19 1 and the second knock came forth to see me and they met think where they even got me verse 10 in the third lock here of the children's every lot one by one they're taking their land and possessions seven of them where 17 in the four came out today she taught the truth of Ishtar toward the families verse 24 and the fifth Locke came out a tribe in store master quarter the families thirty-two the sticks lucky mother churn of Naphtali even the children Italian but notice in verse four oh my and the seventh left came out for the tribe of the children of man according to their families yes that's really nice who ever seen who ganas yes dan was of these Dan his side and side with what he eat eagle he was on the north side he was the main tribe of the north of the Eagle anointing amen that's right but notice is no now George Jacobs ready to leave the scene he starts crying for sighing over his children and he gets to Dan and Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel so first he has to there's two parts to he's almost like a Gemini why he's a judge and that were judges our pastor for the Kingston group that worked earlier in the fire if I will the actual meaning of that word judge is that Dan has been judged worthy day man he's been judged the verse 17 but notice there shall be a serpent by the way how can it be the judge or the Bride of Christ and also be Escarpment he says as an adequate path device the horse heals through this ridership wall backward he said but look at verse 18 ties right into the Psalms 27 he says and I have waited for thy salvation O Lord right into the rapture yes boys are joining serpent anointing goes back to church changes what was the mystery all the theologians all the geniuses all the other philosophers of their day when they read the church ages in Revelation 2 and 3 the question was this and the Prophet breaks it down here once again into resume because from our studies we have already learned that much of the revelation is totally misunderstood because we have not formally known that the church spoken up of the spoken to this in this book is not referred to the pure ecclesia or the elect of the crew of Christ the bride but a speech to the entire body of people who are called crazy so in Revelations 2 and 3 every time Jesus annoys or talks or speaks to a city or Church he is dealing with both seat of God and servers see Dan was the seventh did he go noisy but within that anointing there were serpents and there's those who the good seed was sold the bad seed was so and he said wait let it grow up until the time of the end right yes notice these church ages this book off in what way back in the Old Testament yes glory he's just not as all Israel is not Israel so all Christians are not Christians thus we learned that the church is made up of two vines that's true and the false and both are motivated by the yes sir absolutely yes sir now here's what I want to go tonight I'll get this forfeiting mr7 sure changes surely sure that God would not tell the Jews that if you're not good I'm gonna take you I'm gonna take this from but he does yeah I know his Lord God and all his wisdom hides right in the scripture it Leviticus 26 Christ now we don't do the right here the two laws or two law blessing long person but here in the videos 2016 and these shall make no idols there's no graven images neither rear you up a standing image neither setting up any image of stone in your land to bow down before Jesus for I am the Lord your God he says you shall keep my Sabbath's and reverence my sexually is I know this is part of my statutes and keep my Commandments he doesn't your them then I'll give you rain and Dew see him and the land shall yield her increase and the tree of the field show you enter now this is if they obey the Word of God but notice here in verse 14 but if you will not hearken to me and will not do these things these Commandments and if ye shall despise my statutes or if your song or my judgments so that you will not do all my commands he says like that you break my covenant wow he's really laying it out here November if we do good we get to land rain Wow beautiful but if we do bad what's gonna follow hmm he says beautiful 4:16 I also do this on to you i will even appoint over you terror consumption now look what he gets the burning and the Shepherd's to your and the Bible says that the Jews were blinded for safe because sorrow the heart right that was building right here and you just saw you see the man you're going to be showing it look at verses gentlemen child 12 verse 37 he said the Jesus did all these disciples right or a miracle apart and they still do not believe him and now Jesus Christ pulls all the way baptized and the Book of Isaiah he says but when she Lord was beneath her to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed therefore they could not believe because Isaiah said but he has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart brothers side is that it though his gifts planar unless they understand what they're harder than converting that she's human let's continue did you give really warn them of the seven churches 18 and if you will not let for all this hearken unto me and then I will punish you seven times more oh wow in verse 24 then will I also walk contrary punish you yes seven times for your status and if you are not we're all hardening to me the law contracts to me but notice how he ends this and then I will look contrary I'll show you my fury and I even I will look I put Slovak there he puts Louisville chess right is there was the firstborn yes it was see the space Messiah because I'm gonna hurt you some time yes he was father you know forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children who is the first sugar of God is real yes this is my son despise not the chastening of the Lord nor favorite I rebuke them in the future suffer for 2000 years and look now they're still evolving and clinging to speak to them and they're still praying at the wall yes morning 2120 and when they shall see Jerusalem encompassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is not Christ gives the warning but let them recharge Judea flee to the mountains and let them which work it misses the part out of it and let the night be this much is there and are there any - he says for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled now Christ warns them of the coming destruction because what he knew he was rejected now I'm just throwing this in here in verse 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword he led away captive in all nations even to see the fall of what beautiful through slow but look and through some silly try to down the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled but look what the Prophet said here he says the defeated Church April chapter 3 Jesus riding the bottom that makes the church anxious and the phone's of Judge house don't want to say this word is amazing when he came down in the city Laurie yes hey Laurie remember I said I'll chastise you seven times what's the very next verse my goodness and you shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat what did that take place and I will destroy your high places and cutting down your images and cast your carcasses upon the cars are idling bite my soul shall bore you but memories tonight still chest my first he said I'll make your city's waste and bring your sanctuaries up into desolation on the smell of your the savior of your sweet orders he says now bring the lane of the desolation your enemies which dwell therein shall be understand we know as the prophet said here 63 we know that what happened at a time of the great Roman general Titus he was seized Jerusalem and then partly just they just started eating one another's children eating the bark of the tree the grass the ground and the Titus road right here you just pour the walls for the city blood round him down through the streets like that where he murdered them in there see how it's good fitting exactly two teeth yes sir yes none of them if you don't do this you're gonna miss all the blessings everything I for Shannon for the last 2,000 years to you like people you're gonna miss it it's gonna be seven times the seventh Church agent thing puck to the Gentiles but if you miss it they could have went ready with us but because they rejected the Word of God God blinded their eyes heart their heart and the Gentiles but God for knowledge he saw but he told him was gonna happen for heaven amen look at verse 33 and I was scatter you among the heathen and what's wrong how to sort after your land shall be desolate your cities in leviticus 20:6 he tells them within the space of these so many years what's going to happen what's going to take place Josephus says 1.1 million died during that siege of Jerusalem which a majority were Jewish and that 67,000 recaptured enslaved during this time for the side is it possible the history would record this that God said Jews my firstborn if you don't follow the commandments of God I'm gonna take the seven golden candlesticks Ali is it recorded in archaeology it's called the Ark of Titus in Rome this scene is captured this is the capturing of Jerusalem it's then described as sculptured into this wall is called the art of Titus Titus went in there and took derogated and we see the seven golden candlesticks being carried out by Roman sort of oh my goodness Wow they have forfeited the seven churches and God told him in the word he told him spiritually good and he did it naturally my goodness Wow forfeiting the seventh root changes all the signs of the miracles all the blessings and things of God we will make this adoption we will make this body change in a four-foot-long then they did they chose not to be a bride of Jesus Christ yes but notice who has the golden king of things wrong when did the Gentiles start all the way banging them a condenser the Gentiles ruled from then on when they went to captivity and they ruled on and now we pick it up as as the transition from military rose to paddle rose we seen this now getting chased in there even though God who would now be pulling from the candlesticks the seven churches the Gentiles for a bride Rome would it still be rude ain't controlling everything putting to death like wood yes but they forget to see they got the natural Jesus Christ but thanks be to God that Jesus Christ gave that warning he says also attest to the Christian escape record the Bible scholar Adam Clarke the latter wrote it is very remarkable than that one single Christian perish in the destruction of Jerusalem that's right yes no there were many that were in they all escaped when they when they caught the Word of God yes the Holy Ghost first day they called that warning for Christ and when they solve the prophecy fulfilled they took Taylor get on it yes sir because destruction the other it was next the chest fight it upon the people would take place yes seven times yes servings of saints powerfulness my goodness now let's just backtrack backtrack let's just switch a year turn to Revelation seven one seven one this is this is what this is the prophecy coming what the Bible says I will restore Jesus Christ and the Great Tribulation will go back to the Jews Revelation 7:1 and after these things I saw the fluorines are sitting on the four corners the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor any tree right now notice how I'm reading this okay first dude I saw another angel ascending from the east the seal of God notice this angel had the seal of God yes and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was not given to hurt the earth in the sea and he said saying hurt not the earth nor the scene of the trees till we have Siana see one I'm emphasizing you see and I've sealed the service of God in our foreheads and then Christ starts bringing the roll call 1,000 here 1,000 here 12,000 here 12,000 here right now notice for the Prophet the Prophet I'm gonna I'm gonna bring you up in the quarter the Prophet is now getting this look what he says ten virgins for under $40 Jews age 16 he said another three days and I saw four angels standing at four forty earth this is Nestle's blow down to the earth don't seen at a jump he says and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal don't let me God and he goes screw this thing okay and he's dealing with the tunes of the Gentiles in the next paragraph there now remember the servants has always been God's servant institude Abraham has served the Gentiles not a sory it's a bride it's it's a son this is the son that churches the Jews are the servants right now he's dealing with this you just got done talking about revelation 7 now look at the very next paragraph 264 and he's dealing with these angels and at the seal of God and they suppose the four winds and just what a beautiful parable parallels are parallel here we could run if we get back to Ezekiel or but what he had is easy to Yuma yes because he says and find out what he says has anything like this happened before yes yes so what things like the Great Tribulation the bride goes up the fools were to go in and die the most of the Christians or the lost would look more like a new counsel churches you see the Marquise but then at that time the Jews are another Gentile daughter's clothes and I go back to but what before all destruction can hit he has to seal his hundred yes yes yes yes Gloria and the properties is the parallel to this in Ezekiel 9 and then he starts here in the next paragraph here they want the slide help them and if one came dressed in a white with the right writers he quoted humming your brother and decided to kill it for you tonight then had his think where's Mort pull him up the white right great right okay now look at Ezekiel 9 and he cried also my dears with a lot of boys saying cause them that have charged over the city drawn here even every man was his destroyed weapon in his hand right and the old six men came from the way of the higher gate which slides toward the north and every man of slider live in his hand and every man among them was clothed linen would look with the writers inkhorn might his sight and one man among that was closed linen and they went and stood by the brazen altar now verse four and God spoke specifically to this white man dressed in white or whatever just away with the heat warm right go therefore miss the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the abominations the dungeon is and the Prophet is correlating to this scripture back to revelation 7 yes right yes so he's dealing with this scripture and then the mark of the beast I picked up here 61 and he's dealing with the seals but he goes back now into the ink Lord of writers right there he says it before with the city another thing happened there came a man white Laura decide now he's dealing with this now look what he says in the next paragraph if you want copies lists you know I couldn't know anything now when did that take place he's talking about Ezekiel he says whether that take place alone he said that was the early Pentecostal church when the Holy Spirit went through it marked out the church notice how history if you ever taken the writing of Josephus when he wrote the great battle it was actually 70 he says he says that marking took place in a star twin in x2 but the Holy Ghost came down and marked a hundred and twenty they started a power house oh why do judgment come because now they're not laughing you're not laughing sort of man they're laughing the whole coast yes now judgment could really get he says know why he said they made he says they were all they spoke in tongues they shouted the mighty rushing wind built and they went for such zeal to the purpose in from the Holy Ghost and what they do they made fun of them they'll ask them that's right Jesus that you speak against me or the Holy Ghost come one word against it will never forgive and they seal their true destination when they made all right please go to gate or seal the right name in the book of Acts and through the rest of that time with Peter Paul of belsen German and all the rest of disciples by reversing all Russia John Mark they were getting people sealed before the judgment just like in the tribulation God I headed to hold all the rats back let's really get seal they met another chord without but he had to do it one time before doesn't struck here to get good amen Laurie oh praise the Lord but thank God we have this promise in Leviticus 26 24 and yet for all of that when they be in the land of their enemies I will not cast them away neither I abhor them notice all he's equal 26 he says this is a Orlov to destroy them uglies and i won't get rid of all and to break my covenant with them and i am the lord their god i will be for their sakes but i won't brother 6 remember the Covenant of their ancestors member says i will chastise you seven and seven times right and at the end of the seventh program she caught it wasn't I'm coming back for Ginga the chastisement the judgment he missed off sir the greatest engines ever had with my brother for your sakes remember the coming of your essays whom I brought forth I'll land the Egypt in the side of the heathen that I might be their God I am the Lord they meant well God will restore oh thank you God natural is used for fitting the seventh root changes yes but as the spiritual Jews Saints we must make sure we do not forfeit the wedding the honeymoon yes yes rapture everything they had to do back then obey obey obey what did you say to acts 5:4 he says he gives the Holy Ghost to those that obey Him that's right we must be obedient how many fall short oh my goodness I can every day but remember we can also never have caught yourself like you made it unless it's revealed to you yeah but what we must make me must make sure our salvation you must try it out with fear and trembling every day and if you bark those original Saints by sighing and crying for the Bible issues if we say crying tomorrow because what a sighing and crying it's not a word it's what the spirits pray in the spirit they matter let us not miss or forfeit our husband glory we have to make this wretch we have no other louia I did find a loop one okay it's my own personal revelation revelations for one it says come up hither we have to make the club better but if we fail to make the come up hither we found that in first Corinthians 15 there's a body change so if we miss the confident we have to make this funny change okay then we miss the body change we have to make the confident so we have to make one of the other yes come up hither rapture body Canada the translation the quickening make welcome that's right that's right yes absolutely we can do it amen why because the Bible said there would be a bride there is a Holy Ghost he still feels and seals today and that guarantees you the only one thing he's looking for that oil say we're clear you're gonna cobble oh Jesus we just love ignored Oh God peace Lord don't ever let your tender hand off of us though many times we walk into iniquity God where do we sin in the ignorance or God the law of your Bible says Lord that if you're if the seed remaineth got the incorruptible seed remaineth in the soul God the Bible said we're similar you don't please don't keep your eyes on my fresh Lord oh don't keep it on the spirit realm ignore look deep down into the soul gotta see you see the soul that's been sealed by the Holy Ghost not that blood covering God one has the not on the blood covered but the life of the blood right in it gotta know it's like your cell your own blood right there God it proves where your blood got a blood relation glory glory but for one of your cells out of your son Lord that was pierced on there was a seven of the blood but there was a life but didn't have blood Lord and Lord God a few sealed are sold by that blood cover God and you put her life Lord it shows we have the same blood we're the same person or we're flesh your flesh and bone of your bone God or Jesus not your same person but Lord your pride Lord we were taken out of that we just love you so much more we're trusting over believe in your description or whatever albans the best we can we're waiting on the promise no more waiting Nord for you send that letter rain got to quickness to give us more strength off or to take the dryness of the air God take the dryness nor the prick lena snored about first now he's got anything negative that's just well we just love you so much lord thank you north bless each soul may be found in their hearts God that's mean you look especially holdover God all these are our rocks are out God a LeBron was all broken up yes geez seeds of promise more tainted in their God more just water must be go God George through the pastor there more God the Lord maybe so Morsi as well the Lord we're calling on you to give this increase Lord when the rapture comes north the bodies I'm doing in going the spirit north but the vows of the Spirit will quicken it to us you don't quit in the mortal body God would change calling the name Jesus Christ man so sings the open it was alright just a little status that can go deeper it's a Joshua 18 the 19 that goes under Cooper dealing with the frivolous virgin showing the name change of the city there are all these things done it was good for just a little taste here maybe a little refreshing a little meets this highly and they would be spinning so thank God you can understand what was being taught hallelujah there's no unless you have a question thanks God love each one thank you thank the pastor just inviting us out to share the progress then Thailand we're doing our best I'm very new with this missionary work but I'm starting to understand things a little better due to the latest the our and the scriptures Lord you just gotta go on a Goliath that's an eagle with the light annoyed yes open your mouth and scream give that shout like an eagle show I can even cry with with urgency one thing those sisters in that liquor before they said brother Simon you're very serious with your teacher I said sister every word I have answered and if I tell you wrong I'm not only trouble you're in trouble if he's really that's right she goes I'm really like that about I said I can't play games you're not here I when I when I got on that plane and I went to dream boat I'm thinking what am i doing nothing seemed real for two years I'll be honest nothing just something real the end of those were talking about but nothing you felt real I was just my whole mindset was Lord all you Dini do my shot yeah that's my car my side anyone enjoy the food and go sightseeing we're shopping oh yes and by the grace of God you see how many time that you got took you shoot the Word of God out the last four days was just tweeting the Hancock no all the meetings have dried up canceled because of my too extreme but God made sure I got a study in there any no a Lord bless you drive carefully homes oh just out there name saying that's grace just keep digging the word that's Scripture that scripture in Leviticus 26 just opened up to me I'm I taught it for the Daniel Darko was there and I call it and he just blew off the season Ghana he was just blown away by that scripture brother I'm gonna preach other like so he was really blessed and all's well God is God is the hand of God and everything and I found those Scripture just that open up just reviewing accompany all - things just going through and room 7 what the next scripture right there God warned to be more than people are but you didn't make it clean everything was in the hand of God our lives in the hand of God why is my life like this why in my life like this - this was father's in control we must put our full trust in Jesus Christ because number we have not even seen a tough time yet that's right okay we don't even know and it's like but we will and we will we will rise up as mrs. Jesus Christ and we'll back our little mama shoulder a little sleeves here and we'll go do and accomplish everything the whole we're gonna send you with you we will be that mighty arm we will read those over more than overcomers the Bible says will be that overcoming arm yes that group of soldiers but is Joel to me I don't know I don't want to put my spin on it but whatever it is it's gonna be that's right but it looks so good a job David he said it'd be so fun we want to be a part of that instead it won't be an open show this time a secret would this is secret coming with a bride the third pole will be on and we'll have to exercise we discern the very spirit within each one yes yeah your back back your way but Jesse's doubles the church age right you work your way back to the church ages in Ephesus what was the problem the decent acquaintance but if you notice before the deed the Nicolaitans was Ananias and Sapphira they looked like they were doing me good something but it was totally big Antichrist it could not even be detected by the deeds you could not outwardly show that these are the competitors we're seeing under the message but to see these things they're open to the eyes staying from the parents of you but when I come down to and I see Sapphira that they sold some land and they're gonna go give the money to Peter and the disciples to further the kingdom but it was the Antichrist how can you see that you can who detected the Holy Ghost he's he detected the stirrer of the thoughts and says no so I must move a cleaning cooler because once these are gone this message now we have to do now what to have our exercises exercised to discern both good and now we have to detect not just and CAC something naturally we have to be able to be tempted by the Holy Ghost so you know coach is gonna get so close to the teaching on the church I just want to say a few things I hope everybody can see that in Joshua 18 that was beautiful I remember when you taught that black forgot all about it so thank we come back and teach that I wanted to do a video on the church ages from YouTube channel I would control that prophecy punish seven times more has anybody ever seen that Minsk Russia and then the arca Titus carrying out the natural Romans carried out an angio and but God was carrying out the Spirit we see like this church leave tonight when you've heard from head and this is a example of gift of teaching that I believe he's doing all you can do I'm saying is I don't know whether Simon's convinced about his gift but I have I hadn't even been so his gift follow my heart because a teacher goes deeper than all the other ones just do any have you ever heard that before on the church ages different ministries you okay no or by I listen to a lot online and listen you know I got washing dishes I listen to all different preachers you know be cf-19 ranking you know I just want to encourage about rid of me that was remembered by the grammar said the seals plus the church ages plus the history he sentenced us doesn't mean every word but the revelations inside sermons like when he pulls it up Scripture and that shows you the Old Testament where it is that's the state the Lord like oil Eagles whatever it is from the Old Testament every brady's that's the say the Lord from that tonight oh I like how he ended it there that was a beautiful ending the Jews forfeited the church images we must not forfeit number Hebrews three said we cannot neglect this Holy Ghost gospel the military we can't neglect it that's what I was so concerned about with our church in every church you can't let up on praying I made our church to come early and pray if you can't come early right because we can't neglect many but if we neglect it then like the brother said will forfeit it before his reaction it's in the little things program so it's not the big things is the little things now we got a view okay that mean a five is for shooter I'm sorry it's chapter two verse one we ought to get the more earnest heed to things which you've heard less than any time we should let them slip or if that weren't spoken by Angels steadfast and every transgression this will be to receive a just recompense of reward how should we escape if we neglect so great salvation it's just is just neglecting the prayer the Holy Ghost is afraid not it's the power of prayer you understand what I'm saying hey how many only would say lord help me to pray moreover it's not Emerson clutter Graham says pray before you come to church and I know I recovered that over and over but who's doing it who's who's on fire and not make letters who's not neglecting the things that's why and now we have a scriptural basis for that go for it just as the Jews for if I did the blessings of the land the land and get a Sevenfold punishment that's what that's what's up for us now because listen if we forfeit if we neglect the message the Holy Ghost now we forfeit the seven rewards this is the seven overcome you now Lord that's right absolutely absolutely right because every overcomer gets the reward from the previous ages that's what we miss if we neglected that's all it's got to be we must keep ourselves in our first love how she missed it if we neglect so great salvation which at first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by then that burden God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with that verse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will cannot neglect these things praise the Lord I appreciate the faithful Saints tonight but how many are not here to know how many are not here and not there just they're not their minds aren't all the things of God and they left this morning and their lives won't even change they have no more burden for missionary work no more prayer you understand what I'm saying like then it's neglected and we can say we believe the message but if the message doesn't come in here that our life don't look like such an important thing that's why beg people come early in prayer great I I have to do it himself is your LCD black the Holy Ghost see that's the burden of this hour that's the burden of the hour that Hawks tame on fire you understand that's meat I tell you that because I love you I preach on that a lot of the last three or four weeks I'm gonna try that you got to get you got to be more sincere mother Brooke statement for each day a more sincere you reviewed our church for being starchy which we all need it I need it did it who did it if they give you their life because if not you multiply in your life if you're on fire all the time you'd see these things multiply just be honest with ourselves every term an accountant would have himself cursed to see others saved let's close with the word of Prayer here let's pray for our church pray for our church I'm not responsible for you know Iowa Irish we're responsible for Akron I'm right for each other two weeks ago will answer for our congregation I'll answer for our congregation either got to give it with joy or three the Bible said here we cannot neglect the Holy Ghost we cannot neglect this great salvation Father in Heaven we thank you O God we don't want to forfeit the seven rewards for the overcomers that's what many are forfeiting today they're taking it easy spiritually there's no burden they don't see that there's a war going on lord help us to see the war for souls I was to see that there's an awful or going on help us to see that much Jesus Lord you know my love for the people Lord God you know my love for the house of God I believe those are here tonight Lord surely some of them here this morning I believe they do have a burden but Lord we are it must go beyond just the burden but what's going to action more God help us not to neglect the things of God this great salvation it's a great salvation it's not a secondary well it's kind of good being the message it's a great thing to be in the message it's a great thing to know Christ it's a great deliverance message it's a great thing to your God father we certainly need your help to help us to give earnest heed to the things which we have heard not to let them slip out of our anus we don't want to be excited from revival to revival you want to be on the fire day like you probably said about brother no he's not I'm just excited for revival too right when he said every day he's the same person every single day he's on fire for Christ as your prophet said he only grew and will cry I love Christ more that's the only way changed the already those beloved Umar as the days went by help that didn't tested we will not Lord by your grace help us to obey your word that we don't forfeit these seven reward silver covers just as the Israel forfeit of the seven churches all the blessings we don't want to forfeit or the seven rewards that are waiting for us to be given the Morningstar white raiment how our names not la de da de veau to be kept from the our temptation that will come upon all the earth and to sit on the throne with the Lord Jesus the seventh and final reward all of us not to let these things slip the Lord through our fingers we're all getting older y'all aren't we're all busy but Lord we can all push that aside and safer to me to let his Christ to die is my game help us Lord God to be more sincere Lord Jesus thank you for this in searing the saints to come out tonight to the house of God and those in her live streaming there what was that one listening to it but lord I don't know how many will listen to it later how many are hungry to listen to it later help us to have a hunger Lord God wasn't us who were sold out to this word most of us inaccurate who were sold out to try to wait a soul to do something for the kingdom of God hallelujah do something for that how they do you remember when Paul first saw Jesus Lord he looked at you and he said Lord what must I do and your prophet taught that as well more that we must ask you Lord what must we do show us what we must do what a great question ask after hearing this Lord what must we do help us Jesus to put you first lord help us not to neglect the things we've heard and I just ask again Lord be glorified in our life stop us to obey all of us to do with the spirits net lest our brother give him strength for tomorrow back on the job his wife Lord blesses to Beth Gordon at home dear God this pretty anointed Laura strength keep revealing the word tongue Lord and help us to keep hungry for the word of God help us to keep holding on the word of God not to get places and more cheese's must enlarge and love you more Christ never said hey let's just go to [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]
