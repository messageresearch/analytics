========================================

uh are pure many times and they want to just want to Worship the Lord hallelujah let's go to Second Timothy Chapter 2 when brother Brian was preaching last Sunday had this this thought came to me it was the snares of the devil so while he was preaching remember I read that list of sins I read it on Wednesday too but it just struck me how he uh went so thoroughly through all those while he's preaching this title kind of came to my my mind I don't think I've ever preached directly on this but hope it to be a blessing to you today by God's grace 2 Timothy 2:24 24 down to 26 I'm getting off my regular U series here by God's grace 2 Timothy 2:24 sorry about that so my title is recovered from the snare of the devil that's my title for today by God's grace because that's what Paul says here this is a pastoral book of course you know first and second Timothy are to the Paul's letter to the young Pastor Timothy by God's grace so we see of course the uh we see the uh qualifications for a minister in here we see deacons and so forth and all the teaching for a a pastor by the grace of the Lord a lot of good doctrinal subjects in here plus a prophecy of the end times where people would be lovers of themselves more than lovers of God how many one love God with all you have today Hallelujah we don't want to get trapped in the loving our elves Temptation here 2 Timothy 2:24 we'll read 2425 and 26 by God's grace why don't I read 24 and 25 then we can all read 26 together the Bible says and the servant of the Lord must not be I'm sorry must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God per Adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth now let's read 26 together ready 1 2 3 and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart make it known unto God God sees all the unspoken needs and all the spoken ones of course that we prayed for Father God you see the hands of the people lord lord your Prophet taught us Lord it defies gravity to raise our hand Lord it it just goes against the Devil's uh plans to try to discourage us when we raise our hands we're lifting our hands to you God so hear our humble prayers today Lord minister to every need Lord we're reaching out to you Lord God we're Defying Gravity uh defying Lord uh just The Temptations of Life Lord we're reaching out to you lord your Prophet said one of the signs you're on fire is reaching out in the spirit so Lord we're reaching out to you today move by your spirit today Lord bless your people Hallelujah Lord and as these words came to my heart on last Sunday father I just pray they' be a blessing to your people in Jesus Christ Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God hallelujah so I do have some slides here I think uh by God's grace so looking at second Timothy 2 24 uh down through 26 by the grace of God now uh I want to do a few Greek words here so we can kind of get a good uh understanding here the servant Lord and chapter 24 would be the the the minister of the Gospel the preacher so the preacher must not strive must not fight uh be a fighter must be gentle unto all men apt to teach so this is an interesting thought too you know a lot of times pastors will have both preaching gifts and teaching gifts because the pastor is with the flock most of the time and he's got to be able to instruct them here's how you do this according to the Bible here's how you do this and so uh many times you'll see a pastor they'll call them pastors and teachers well that's because uh they have to be able to teach the People by God's grace and patient notice patient in these types of situations verse 25 in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God per Adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth that they may recover which means recover oneself now we'll be going to the prodal eventually but remember he lost he lost the understanding of who he was and he had to recover who am I the devil had trapped him in such a way that he didn't know who he was anymore and so God uh God was able to help the prodigal remember who he was Hallelujah out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive or caught or captured by him at his will so we see some uh some things here some uh points in the scripture pardon me in verse 25 you know trapped Christians and and I think we can all say uh that we've been trapped at some point at Le in a complex brother Ram said raise your hands in your church or in our church if you've ever battled a complex he said look oh my look at the hands he said he said nearly everybody battles a complex so we would uh as as real Believers we would not be possessed with demons but we could be uh battling demons and oppressed by demons right uh because the B Bible said neither give place to the devil where's the where's the place that he wants he wants the soul but if God's in there Satan can't get in there Hallelujah but where he can get in is the body and the mind and so we've got to do our best to keep Satan out of our our minds and of course our bodies taking care of our Temple Hallelujah but he notice Paul said tra Christians they oppose themselves so they're retaliating against their own selves so uh the flesh is retaliating against the soul the soul is telling them to do things but they're retaliating against that and they're walking according to the flesh a real Christian right because he's telling the pastor he's telling the pastors help them uh teach them be patient to them Hallelujah that's that's right so that's what I'm doing today by God's grace so help them because they they do not acknowledge the truth people that are uh trapped in complexes many time they're believing lies like remember brother Ram's complex uh was like oh uh his complex in the standing in the Gap was uh well if they're not going to listen to me I'm not going to go to them so his complex was the people would never receive me their lives would never change so why should I spend my time with them that was the complex right he was believe in a lie right but then he had this plan know think about this the enemy will get in our imaginations give us all these plans well if this doesn't go that way then I'll go brother said I'll move out in the wilderness I'll take my wife with me and the angel lord said your wife won't go with you she'll leave you right but they but the enemy will get our minds in a such a trap a complex where we'll have imaginations and how things might turn out but God is faithful to rescue his children hallelujah amen so even trapped Christians can they're fighting against their own selves and they're believing lies then in verse 26 uh trapped Christians must recover themselves meaning they've got to repent and choose to overcome their own sin each one of us could easily point at everybody else but we got to ultimately point the finger at ourselves and say what have I done wrong Hallelujah because you can't you can't you all know people you pray for them for years they won't repent you can't help anybody repent the only person you can help repent is yourself Hallelujah I can only help me repent Hallelujah right so we see that we must look at ourselves and then they must recognize that they've obeyed the will of Satan rather than the will Lord many times as Christians that's the hardest thing for us to recognize but we've got to recognize that we've done the will of Satan rather than the will of God right in other words we've obeyed our flesh we've obeyed uh The Temptations lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life we've obeyed the will of Satan we've done the will of Satan rather than the will of God remember brother R did the same thing remember in South Africa the angel told him you go to this here then come back here go take a hunting break but the uh the denominational Brethren pressured him no we got to go to these small churches and these all things and uh he actually did the wrong thing he he did the the will of man rather than the will of God and he paid for it he suffered for it but the Bible said every Son of God will be chasen Hallelujah the the fact God chased you rebukes you corrects you maybe allows you to be sick so you can humble yourself the reason he does that is because he loves his children hallelujah amen that's right God let brother Ram get amibas because God loved brother brandom and wanted to show him don't follow the will of Man follow the will of God oh my now the origin is as I said was with brother uh Brian's message there and it has a relationship you know to the recent sermons you know this uh Corinthian Series has been a real blessing to me uh I've never seen it in the light that I'm seeing it here by God's grace but this thought came to me while I was studying you know the same man who said love remember we went through those 16 attributes of love the same man that said love love love love charity charity charity the same man also said we must judge one another and ourselves in the church right same man same letter same gospel Hallelujah so what I mean is sometimes we misunderstand love we think love Is Just oh feel good and be kind and nice but it also means calling out sin in our lives in the lives of others like we said with Matthew 18 you go to that person individually then you take a group then you bring it before the local church right so it's the same man it's the same uh spirit of God that allows us here to to recognize that real love is corrective and yes real love is patient real love is kind Real Love is longsuffering All these things that love is those are all things that we appreciate I appreciate 16 attributes of Love Don't you that's a lot of love that's a lot of attributes of Love 16 different channels that can slow down into longsuffering patient thinks no evil rejoices in the truth hallelujah amen all these beautiful channels that's when we know we're walking the love of God when we see the fruits of God's spirit manifest in our lives Hallelujah and God creates in us a clean heart Hallelujah now I don't know what that is now I just want to briefly you know uh this when I was looking at this sermon and studying this weekend I thought well this reminds me I preached on isolation a couple years back so I just want thought I'd remember bring some of these things things to our remembrance you know there's at least three types of isolation you know uh and the worst one is our the first one that's what we're talking about today with um Paul's writing in 2 Timothy 2 we sometimes isolate ourselves by allowing uh we it's our own sinful choosing that traps us and isolates us from God and from the Saints or family or whatever you know whoever isolate yourself from uh the one with Hezekiah was he was isolated from God so God withdrew a a part of his anointing a part of his uh blessing of Hezekiah so Hezekiah could see what would he choose if God's spirit wasn't so hard so so strong on him remember that prayer from brother brandham let me read it here U such a beautiful prayer I just wrote it down if I can find it I think I was looking at it yesterday oh yes he said this in 1963 he said some people say oh Satan can't make me do that uh he said yes you just let God lift his hand one time off you and Watch What Happens so Hezekiah no doubt he had so many testimonies like he would have thought well there's no way I'd ever allow you know Babylon to come in here and spy out the the things of God brother said you just let God take his hand off you one time see what you would do in other words let you'd see how carnal you could become if God's spirit isn't on you God's grace God's hedge isn't about you and brother R said I constantly plead God don't send him God keep Satan away God don't let me uh lead me not into trial don't lead me there but Deliver Me From Evil hallelujah amen it's a beautiful prayer like I said one of the just an outstanding quotation from God's Prophet but that's the one where where God will let us see uh what's in our heart right doesn't the Bible say the heart is Jeremiah said the heart is deceitful above all things right so that's why David said create in me a clean heart and renew a steadfast Spirit Within Me God's got to create that and we know now by the the understanding of the revelation of the message and the New Testament that new heart's got to be created every single day because we got to die every day Hallelujah your habit of obeying God's word won't last every day you got to renew it every day it's not automatic you're going to want to read your Bible and pray every day or confess your sins every day that's not automatic we need to go ask God God helped me created me a pure heart so I don't isolate myself from you but the last one is the best one we want to isol sometimes we shut in with God hallelujah we spend extra time with the Lord we give God a little extra time that's the best isolation we could have Hallelujah and yet throughout all these we're never forsaken God never leaves us nor forsakes us and then remember there's that there's uh you're in one of these places right now think about that some of you are approaching a test right now some of you are getting close to walking into a place where God's going to take the Hedge on I'm sorry hedge off he's going to let you he's going to let you fight right we're we're either coming to one or you're in the midst of it right now or you're in a spot where wow I got peace all around me I got Victory All Around Me praise God I've got peace like a river where's Lily when I need her Hallelujah no I know she's coming she'll probably be here Prett soon she does that so well I I want I want her to demonstrate that for everybody I got joy like a fountain all these things Hallelujah I love that childlike Faith they got Hallelujah so see you know you're at one of these places think about that where are you right now are you coming up like well I feel like you know maybe God's uh maybe this this protection's coming off I feel like I got to get my sword ready here I got my sword sharpened or are you swinging the sword right now to fight off Satan get off me Satan get behind me Satan in the name of Jesus hallelujah or do you feel like I just got peace I got Victory Hallelujah I'm walking in the in the blessing of God I'm walking in the fear of the Lord hallelujah I'm on top of the mountain the mountains have moved Hallelujah and I'm walking in Victory by the grace of God so we we see that we're we're in one of these places and and uh we want to of course overcome the devil now here's the one where we get this you know uh Jesus told Peter why could you not watch with me one hour he said watch and pray that you enter not into temptation so see there there is is there's times God wants us to pray so uh we won't go into a Temptation see there's times God is teaching us continue in prayer continue in prayer and if you stay in prayer I won't allow you to go through this very difficult thing but then there's other times you can pray all day and God's still going to let you be tested right had medit I mean a meditation all day because none of us pray all day right you got to go to work you got to make a living you got to Fellowship you got to go to church all these things but God there's times no matter how much you pray meditating how close how many sermons you listen to how many times you quote the word of God how many times you you say nice things about other people and and testified to a a sinner friend or whatever you do no matter what you do God's going to allow this hedge to be taken and let you go through a battle Hallelujah that's right and again the hour of the power of the Hour of Prayer church I don't know I know this I know there's power in half an hour prayer Hallelujah praying before service that's why I invited everybody again I keep inviting everybody there's power in that Hallelujah you have time to be in God's presence and it it's it's an opportunity to watch and pray and make sure your spirit is in unity with God Almighty Hallelujah there's power in that hallelujah amen remember uh because we all got we all have to go through trials or tests of faith and such a promise God will not allow us to go through a trial we can't overcome God will never never let us have a foe or an evil spirit that we can't overcome Hallelujah we have to remember this we have to remember this our trials are more precious than gold what is gold two over $200 a a troy ounce I think right now no $22,000 I'm sorry an troy ounce of gold is over $2,000 sometimes I watch on the stock market go Silver's really down right now so if you want to get some silver Now's the Time to get it get it while it's low silver is redemption in the Bible let's make sure we're Redeemed by God's grace Hallelujah switching from natural to spiritual but when you get tested or when God allows that hedge to go up that is a precious thing to God God's going to watch you fight God's going to help you fight God knows you can already win this fight hallelujah it's more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire my wife sh said she went back and listened to Aaron Riddle's sermon on uh the fiery Trials of our faith there so that was a great blessing to her remember the there seven steps in God refining your faith Hallelujah we got to be willing to go through all of them Hallelujah and what does this do this this ultimately leads to God's praise the trials will make you praise God more the trials will make you honor God more the trials will make you give God more Glory Hallelujah that's right now a lot of times Church though our trials are self-inflicted right in other words we isolate ourselves or we give in uh we willingly leave uh uh the plan of God and go after after the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life something along those lines but that's okay God's with us God's forming us God is maturing a people the fivefold ministry will bring them to Perfection that's that's what I was confessing at the altar this morning I was saying Lord you said the fivefold ministry will bring us to completion hallelujah amen thus say the Lord amen if we stay with the pure word of God and preach the pure word of God our lives will be brought to maturity will become more like Christ it's guaranteed amen hallelujah what a promise amen now that's the one we read again so again this is from my 2022 notes sometimes you know it seems in this case you know a a Christian in Timothy's church here was taken captive uh and it looks like it's self-inflicted and like I said many times for us it's lust or Pride uh if we looked at brother Bram again that would be the pride of life with the critical spirit that's the pride of life criticizing the people every time I go back the women have shorter hair I'm glad when I come to church they got long hair amen seech we got some maturity by God's grace every come every time I come back there's less and less makeup to the point where there's no makeup amen hallelujah it's just the healthy glow of living a good healthy life amen we'll put some oils on there some before service whatever you do maybe nighttime but uh in this case it looks like this person uh because the Bible said Paul said he he's got to recover himself that means he himself went into the Trap right but it's it's the repentant will of God that gets you out of the Trap of this of the devil the snare of Satan it's a repentant heart we know that gets us out of the traps of the devil now remember friends I'm just going to re rehearse this just just to remind you um and I even heard a quote too uh um Martin Luther said he said he said I wish every Christian could have their eyes open to see the spiritual warfare that's constantly around them you know we walk outside and all we see is you know beautiful Skies now not necessarily yesterday that was a really cloudy day but you know like a day like today my it's beautiful it's gorgeous but Martin Luther said I wish that people could walk around and see the demon powers I forget how many times Martin Luther woke up and Satan was standing right at his bed the church age messenger and he would quote the word of God he said sometimes I just roll over and go back to sleep I du Satan go roll over and go back to sleep he said I wish every Christian could see the demon powers now that's scriptural right because Daniel met an angel I just read I just read the whole book of Daniel this week uh and he said to met the angel the angel said I've been trying to get you to get to you for 21 days for three weeks I've been trying to get down here what layers of demons are there church we got to stay in tune with the Holy Spirit praise God layers of principalities and spiritual wickedness it took him three weeks of fighting for the angel that and he had to get help from Gabriel amen Church it ought to make us rejoice if God answers our prayer how how gracious God was to give us Supernatural help from Angels Hallelujah to answer one of our prayers amen we got some serious Supernatural help Hallelujah Angels were dispatched Hallelujah that ought to show you how much God loves you because they're sent to the hirs those who will inherit salvation Hallelujah three weeks of fighting of wrestling with spiritual wickedness and then the only time the prayer can be answered is when Gabriel your prince now that's Israel's Prince not our Prince not the Gentiles Prince but Israel's Prince Gabriel comes along and starts he he gets in the B he said this is a a job for a real Archangel of God he said step aside this is a job for a real angel I'm not you could push me aside too buddy you know I'm just using I'm just using you as a prop I'm always going to use Row one as a prop here so thank you buddy he said he pushed aside he said he said let me wrestle this guy and then the angel could slip down and say Daniel in heaven you're greatly beloved amen and Heaven heard you the first day you prayed hallelujah amen hallelujah Heaven hears when you cry out to God when you call upon God Heaven hears you that same moment Hallelujah but then we got to keep praying we like the Bible said he's the high priest of your profession we got to keep professing the truth of God Hallelujah because what what happens if we stop our confession we lose our Victory brother Ram says and it's true you can see in the Bible your healing will last as long as you confess it unless God is testing you right we always got that unless because there's always certain situations we see and and the example was with with u with Peter walking on the water his victory his Supernatural walk lasted as long as he had his eyes on Jesus but as soon as he got his eyes off Christ he began to sink it's a lesson to us we must keep our eyes on Jesus Hallelujah we'll be able to walk upon the Seas of life without sinking That's what Satan wants he wants us to sink but by the grace of God will not sink we'll stand Hallelujah so think of the layers of demons right and now it's just become more I'm going get to this it just become a little more real with these to see how much the demon powers around us finally my brethren be strong in the Lord it's good to be strong at the gym right Mal we've been going we went to the gym together a couple times this week it's good to be strong in the Lord but it's better I'm sorry it's good to be strong in the body it's better to be strong in the Lord I know this for sure I spent more time in my Bible than I did at the gym this week that's what Malachi that's what we got to do we got to spend we got to give some time we got to get a little benefit uh on our body there's a there's a little benefit Godly exercise has a little benefit but God really wants us us to be strong in the Lord and in his power where's his power his power is in his word Jesus said my words I speak unto you their spirit and their life you want to feel life you want to feel like you're living start speaking the word of God hallelujah amen there's life in the word of God be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God we're going to review that in just a moment that you may be able to stand against the Ws cunning Arts so Satan is a cunning AR artist he's a deceitful artist he's a crafty artist right he paints a beautiful picture oh you could do this and it won't be that much sin he just paints this beautiful picture it's actually a trap of the devil right but he's an artist he paints something or gives you this idea or or this imagination or this reasoning like he did with Eve in the garden brother Ram said he just he he's so artistic to make everything uh make sin look so attractive and so beautiful it's but it's trickery and the only way we overcome is having on the armor of God because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness huah remember uh uh Gabriel battled the the the Prince of Persia so there was a demon over Persia how about the American demon right that's the one we got to battle with I've been battling with him for uh 25 years by God's grace amen still battling against him against spiritual wickedness in high places there's demon powers that are above us and around us trying to get us to fall setting traps for us and and painting these elaborate uh traps and tricks and we've got to get victory over that the only way we can do it is by the word of God we must wrestle against it Church be encouraged I was just encouraged this week I saw a meme uh online and it showed a man who was fighting against sin on the other side you know I think I think he was embarrassed maybe he was drunk I know looking at evil pictures or something he was just embarrassed of his sin and on the other side this side said fighting against sin and the other side it showed him partying with drunkenness and uh you know at a big party laughing enjoying it I just appreciated it in one in one case he's fighting against sin the other case he's Bound by sin he's a slave to sin so I just want to be encouraged I want to encourage you keep fighting the good fight of Faith Hallelujah you're not giving over to it you're not in the you don't have a hangover this morning you know whatever it may be uh you're not in in an adulterous bed this morning or a fornicator bread or something like that thank God you're fighting the good fight of Faith hallelujah amen but you must know spiritual wickedness is against you principalities of Satan are fighting against you but the great Shepherd is watching over you in other words there's wolves all around there's wolves all around us but the shepherd is not far from us hallelujah he said I be not far from each one of you Hallelujah acts 17 so if we're to overcome the principalities of Satan the powers of Satan the rulers of Darkness the rulers of America or Ohio and all their all all their their different levels uh brother man said there's degrees in heaven there's degrees of angels there's degrees of Believers Hallelujah if we're to overcome those degrees of devils then we're going to need to put put and take unto you the whole armor of God that you may able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand now remember what's what's the other scripture that's just coming to me now resist Satan and he will flee our duty is to fight until Satan says I've had enough now you're not the one who has enough it's God who's got enough Hallelujah Satan's going to get tired and move on he's going to give you a peace for a season when you start letting the Lord fight through you Hallelujah because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world Hallelujah and then Satan say oh I can't handle no more of this this Holy Ghost filed sister this Holy Ghost filled brother I can't handle I I need to take a break I'm leaving them for a season and then we can Rejoice amen it's the season of Peace Hallelujah Hallelujah and let's let's do this let's do all we can do let's do all we can do to resist Satan have you turned off your phone to resist Satan have you have you driven away from a certain situation to resist Satan have you walked away from certain people and situations just to resist Satan have you done it the Bible said do all do everything in your power sometimes you got to physically flee like Joseph from Piper's wife sometimes Paul said flee in the New Testament flee from all these workers of unrighteousness we're going to get to a little bit The Snare of uh riches he said flee from those things just run away from those constant Temptations run from those things and run to follow those who are living a righteous life Hallelujah right so we want to keep the full armor of God on your being at all times now there's five I'm going to get back to that I got that one out of order remember there's five New Testament verses about snares and some of them uh I'm not going to do I think I'm only going to do three or two remember this was a good reminder Simon has preached on this numerous times it's helped me out the great snare of the end time is like the days of Noah where they were eating and drinking Mar and giving in marriage right so we see Jesus says this is a snare that comes on the whole world and I want to point point this out yeah surfeiting is like another word for drunkenness and drunkenness and cares of this life the cares of this life are anxieties so it's the anxiety it's the pressure to have enough food it's the pressure to have enough drink it's the pressure that you got to conform and be like the rest of the world we don't have to be like the rest of the world we need to be like the Christian Church Hallelujah we need to be like the book of Acts Church Hallelujah that's right and this is how people will miss the Rapture the rapture will come unawares and they won't know it because they're giving themselves over just to you know the feasting and the drinking and everything like that that's why you know it's so sad if people cancel their Wednesday night service you know for just because it's Christmas you got all day to do all you want but let's give God some worship on his this apparently it's supposed to be his day it's supposed to be his birth we know it's not right it but let's give God glory on his day praise God now some of you I don't know you but some of you at least get that day off ra if you get that day off does everybody get that day off everybody get that day off I know you guys are out of school okay so it's like it's almost everybody in America not everybody I mean there's some certain people in you know emergency situations or even gas stations they got to work on that day but if we got the day off let's give God a great portion of that Hallelujah like I look forward to I was I was talking to my assistant superintendent he's the second guy in charge of our district and uh he always says I like the joy you have on your face Mr Smith I said well it's all God you know but he said what are you doing what does your family do for Christmas I said well I give all my kids three gifts a toy clothes and a book I said between everyone we read a chapter in the Bible or a section of the Bible and then Malachi plays for us on the piano now one of these guy one of these days this guy's going to leave and we need another person to step up and play the piano I'm giving my family some encouragement here no pressure guys no pressure play like Mali one day he's gonna have his own family Lord willing but I uh I said you know we we we we sing we do a chapter open a gift everybody all 10 of us right 10 gifts boom or maybe eight gifts eight gifts we hold our gifts to the end so I think about that in that we get almost four chapters of the Bible extra chapters that we would you know on top of our morning and evening devotions and the assistant superintendent he said that sounds just like a service Mr Smith I said that's what it is that that's it's bringing church back to our home Hallelujah like I've told people you know that maybe ize me for celebrating Christmas and I just told him I said I worship God more on Christmas than than not on Christmas like like I give God more time we uh we we we spend more time in the word of God Hal we sing more songs amen that's why I love that day Hallelujah but you know to each his own you know you got to like the Bible said if it's a sin to you then don't do it but whatever you do do it in faith Hallelujah but notice uh eating drinking just the anxiety brother Bram called it the pressures of Le oia the pressures of of having everything you need the clothes and the food and and paying the bills and all the pressures of Life some people get caught up and it's a snare if they get their eyes off Christ and they're not ready for Christ's coming and church it ain't just coming on uh China ain't just coming on Africa ain't just coming on Britain it's coming on the whole world Jesus Christ said so so it's something uh from every nation every people every continent is going to have to overcome this by the grace of God so how many say God help me to overcome my anxieties my cares of this life amen how do you do it brother Jess well just let's keep reading verse 36 Watch and Pray always Hallelujah keep watching for the coming of the Lord keep praying for the coming of the Lord that ye may be accounted worthy so there's a worthy there's an element we must be worthy we must be worthy servants we must die every day we must be Kings and Priests unto God we must give God acceptable sacrifices amen that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before now look there he's standing again just like the armor of God God wants you to stand God's giving you strength not to fall do you see the imagery God don't want you to fall God wants you to stand against the enemy and if you keep standing against the enemy you'll stand before Jesus hallelujah amen don't fall down and and and stop making progress on your journey for the Rapture don't fall down and stop go forward take the word of God get the victory Hallelujah put on the armor of God keep fighting Hallelujah so it's overeating drinking cares of this life now here's the other one the other time snares was helpful well I'm sorry helpful to this type particular sermon but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare so in America we got to be careful uh the poorest of us is richer than most of the world you just look it up uh so we're all rich in some degree it's a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and ption so when people are enslaved to their lust they're actually spiritually drowning right and we can we can throw them a Lifeline but they've got to grab the lifeline and guess who's on the other side Jesus is on the other side side amen Jesus Jesus will pull you out Hallelujah if you want to get out I'll read a quote later brother Ram says Jesus is opening the door for you to get out but you've got to come out you've got to grab the lifeline and you've got to hang on so Jesus can pull you out of a snare Hallelujah but they drown men they're drowning in their own Lust For the Love of Money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have ER from the faith and pierc themselves through through with many Sorrows so see again notice we see self-inflicted wounds here again right this person did it to themsel they pierc them themselves because uh they love money more than they love the things of god let's not hurt ourselves we have enough enemies to fight right we have enough demons to fight why would we hurt ourselves but PA Paul said it's the love of money that does this to people and they pierce themselves through with many Sorrows I love this but thou man or oh woman or man of God flee run from these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience and meekness Hallelujah brother man tells that story I love that story he tells the family he said you watch a family they'll be poor he said but pretty soon they get a new house they get a new car uh they get all these things and pretty soon they start forsaking their Church brother said always always keep yourself in the presence of God where the spirit of God is being poured out Hallelujah I got a fresh outpouring on Wednesday night amen I was praising God and the tears were flowing I thought oh this this is beautiful amen this is why I come to church amen hallelujah keep yourselves where God's spirit can fall on you and you can have a clean heart Hallelujah glory to God you follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience and meekness so the Bible says follow spiritual Treasures not natural Treasures now remember brother bam said today's climate now here I'm going to get back to the the the the smartphones and all the technology of today brother Ram said Satan's been working to create this Satan's Eden what we're living in right now the Temptation Satan's been working 6,000 years to create his own guard his false Garden of Eden now what's Eden mean you remember Eden close pleasure it might mean power in some in some uh uh definitions but it was the Garden of Eden it was the Garden of pleasure now that's the Hebrew word there could be a power could be another meeting Hallelujah so brother R says Satan has a Eden Satan has a garden of Pleasures Hallelujah and for 6,000 years Satan's been designing the culture to move a certain way and to uh bring in certain inventions right and all these things 6,000 years to make this The Darkest Day uh I'm sorry yeah no it's not darkest forgive me it's the most deceptive day the darkest day was the fourth Church age th here sorry this is the most deceptive day According to second Timothy I think it's chapter 3 where Paul says that he said evil seducers will wax worse and worse so the seducing and the false teaching is worse and worse it gets more deceptive so we got to have more knowledge I like what brother Brian said and brother Sim both said it we got to have discernment of sphs Hallelujah we got to be able to judge evil spirit is this of of God or is this of Satan oh God help us to have discernment Hallelujah because this is the age of Satan's pleasures and we must overcome Hallelujah now he by this fall took over and possessed the garden of Edom himself he took it over and now he has had 6,000 years of deceitful rule deceiving the people God's children as he did then think about how many uh nomination I was just even uh nominal even Messa churches are being deceived right now they're being deceived right some of them say oh the Rapture is already pass we're in the Millennium or brother's coming back and we're going to fly him around the nation what a bunch of nonsense how many people has he deceived because they were based on free more agency to act any way they wish isn't that a blessing I can act today any way I want Satan not he can't make me act a certain way because God's with me and I can choose God's word I can choose God's path and I can walk how God wants me to walk today what an encouragement that ought to be to us to have the power of free moral agency I'm am GNA put on the full armor of God brother Claude I'm gonna put it on are you brother Hallelujah put on the full armor of God you've got the choice you've got the free more agency praise God in other words nobody can take you brother Mercy nobody can make you and take you take off the full armor of God nobody can do it ain't that beautiful we can keep on the armor of God it's our choice we can stay with our defenses we can keep our defenses we can stay protected we can stay with the victory if we want to it's it's our free moral agency we just have to want to praise God he cares for you do you care for him Hallelujah he cares for you do you care for him and believing that they would act right or trusting they would act right then they've come with the wrong act and sold their birth rights as Esau did for the world and Satan won it and he took it over and he'd had 6,000 years to build up his Eden as God has 6,000 years to bring his Eden to clothes I know some people believe it's six days my family and I joke about that and some quotes brother R says six days and some quotes he says 6,000 years but and by deceit deceit of the word or the people now establish his own Eden his own Pleasures in this earth in sin another quote same uh same year and as God took 6,000 years with the original word to bring forth every word of his kind and everything that he made would be God's Own word bringing forth its kind now the deformer has had 6,000 years and to form that word of God now let me stop right there how many believe you're a child of God if you are you'll have the seed of God and just remember that seed came from a father your father is in heaven Hallelujah let me remind you you're The Offspring of God hallelujah that's why you want to be like God that's why you want to surrender to God that's why you want to serve God you are God's Offspring Hallelujah and that seed will bring forth of its kind Hallelujah if people don't bring forth the right kind of word word it's because they're not children of God but if we're children of God we'll bring forth the word of God the seed of God just want to encourage you there that's what's That's What Makes You hunger for the word of God that's What Makes You hunger for righteousness because you're a child of God you're the seed of God and God seed will bring forth of its kind hallelujah amen I got that I got we have that Assurance today God's word is going to produce itself in our lives that must been for me amen hallelujah glory to God now in Satan's Eden we can so easily see how sin is even more at our fingertips than ever before brother bam said they used to have to go out to the the picture shows to get sin right then he brought it uh into your house uh with the TV and now he put it uh in your pocket so now you got apps to easily fornicate uh the brothers were telling me years ago they said there's dating apps where you can just uh just hook up for one night and and that and and then leave and and whatever and it's it's just that easy and there's so many willing uh uh Sinners out there fornicators out there it just it's just a Tap Away there's apps to easily gamble right there's apps to easily spend money you don't have right there's apps that easily blaspheme right get on social media or whatever gossip say anything you want it's right there so it's so so close and we know all over for all if we're not careful Satan sets all these things up to distract us from the Lord Jesus Christ because it's spiritual wickedness it's layers of spiritual wickedness and Satan's used 6,000 years how can I make sin so accessible for them how can I make sin so enticing for them but you know God's people aren't like oh I'm afraid we got weapons hallelujah or we got a weapon I'm sorry we've got defenses Hal we've got all Hallelujah brother BR says once you get the victory he said uh oh he said it's like that he said once you get the Victory and you get filled with the Holy Spirit he said there's times in your life he said it's like a little mouse a little mouse is in a home and a little mouse is being chased around his whole life by this this wicked cat this cat and he's afraid of the mouse he's afraid of the mouse I'm sorry he's afraid of the cat all the time where's the cat where's the cat he said one day the mouse was running away from the cat and he fell into a wine bottle and he got Intoxicated by the wine he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother said when that Mouse crawled out of there he said he stuck out his chest and said where's that cat I'm G to beat that cat and when the when the saints come out on the day of Pentecost they said where's that devil where's that devil let's rebuke him let's cast him down let's win souls let's preach the gospel because we're filled with God's power hallelujah amen hallelujah now I know not every season's like that but if you've got the Holy Ghost you're going to have seasons like that where's he at let me bring him down because I've got the the word of God hallelujah we need some more of that if you need more of that say amen amen hallelujah see there's times this I know we're in the midst of battles right there's like we said there's times you're in the midst of the battle where you say bring him on where's he at like that song says I like it so much now Satan's mad and I'm so glad you know why I'm so glad because we just use the word of God and he flee he had to flee resist Satan in other words you see M I've got a powerful weapon if I just keep this if I just keep swinging this and believing this he's going to leave me and then I get peace like a river Joy like a fountain love like an ocean Hallelujah that's right church amen it's not like we're like oh all scared all the time now we got to go through trials we got to go through tests but every now and then we fall into some wine bottles Hallelujah and we come out and say Where's that devil Hallelujah let me get him let me that's what the Bible said take revenge on him in other words that person where that being around that person made you compromise go right up to them and start talking about Jesus am that's right amen I'm not afraid of that I'm not afraid of this conflict I'm not afraid of that I've got the word of God hallelujah amen that's a beautiful that's a funny story I like that story the mouse falling into the wine Hallelujah so it's it's a trap it's it's a it's a it can be a social media trap Church now especially for the young people I want to share this my wife and I were talking about this I was reminded this I've been listening to different podcasts and then different sermons of course I usually listen to you know Donnie Reagan Tim puit are the main guys I listen to the brother Jason Demar but I couldn't remember I I didn't even have time to go find them but I've heard different preachers over the last few months say they have done so many youth meetings which is good they have lots of big big churches you know if we had a bigger Church I'd probably do youth meetings but you know um but they said they noticed in the last four or five years the main request from young people 16 17 18 19 into their early 20s the main sins they got to overcome is depression hopelessness and think about this they have everything these are American message churches and the church said how could we be hopeless in America in the message we have every sermon of William brandom on our phone you you can get all of Martin Luther's writings on your phone you can listen to all of Charles Spurgeon all these Legends we'd say of the faith now Hall of Fame of faith I'm not bragging on men but you know all the all these Heroes of the faith you can listen to all their things and yet people are hopeless today they're depressed how is that possible because Satan's Eden he set traps of pleasure and they fall into those traps thank God they keep coming to church though Hallelujah I want to say that and when you fall into sin you keep coming to church Church Hallelujah don't lay out a church amen this is God's Hospital hallelujah amen that's right now if you got a contagious disease stay at home Hallelujah because you're G to get all my kids sick and yours Hallelujah I heard brother Brook say that to a few weeks ago I was like that's rights how can these teenagers and young adults and envying and these young ladies envying and want to be like that that girl who just got married or that that that uh that star on Instagram or whatever jealous of one another bitter self-pity these are all the things that the young people are coming and how they've been they've been protected they're protected in a message church I mean it's not like we let you know half naked women come up to the pulpit and preach or something like that or let let the Catholic priest come in here waving his sensor and you know and pass out prayer beads they're in a message church and battling bitterness and envy and depression hopelessness and feeling sorry so sorry for themselves and the brother said on both the the podcast and the sermons most of them would confess to being addicted to some type of social media so Satan would he sets a trap he said oh there's me there's a message Chat group on here on Instagram just file them but pretty soon after a few Taps you get an invite to join this other thing well I just follow this one uh just going to just you know the good stuff from this person but pretty soon you get some bad stuff from that person hallelujah or they'll send you a personal message what do they call I am in I don't know I used to be on Facebook I'm not I'm glad I'm not on anymore by God's grace there was there were some good things about it but it was it's it's a distraction in most cases now I can use it for business I know some of us use it two two of us are use it for business and you can you can balance it with the spirit of God I felt I balanced it but L becomes a distraction but but that's what it was confessed it was confessed too much time on Instagram seeing these other people oh and they're so blessed and I'm not they've got all this what do I got well one thing you got is Jesus that's one thing you done you got a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins hallelujah amen and any sinner plunged beneath that flood loses all their guilty say that's what you got that's right that's what you got so distracted spending so much time and again how much time are they on their Bibles how much time are they they praying listen to brother Ram you should take notes of brother Ram sermons you should sit down and study too that's just not for preachers listen you're going to study something if you're not going to study the Bible you're going to find something else to study that's okay if it's for your job or you're in you're in the learning season I told AA this week I said how's the math going oh it's okay Dad I said you're almost done with that season season H I said okaya when are you going to use this in real life never I'm like I never do either unless you're an engineer or something like that then you're going to use square roots and algebra and all this stuff I never use that Hallelujah I've raised eight children and you know just living the life by God's grace living a a Christian Life it's funny so you got to be very careful they admitted to all these Tik tocks that that's that's just what Satan wants you to do he wants you to be distracted right it's it's it's right there it's so much is right there that's why I've told my children we're not we're not doing any of those we don't do any of those the only one we do is the B reel I got to watch that one too you just got to watch it and like I told the people I said I don't give my children uh smartphones or tablets until they become 16 they start driving especially the smartphone and the new rule in our house you got to do all that all that um computer work am among other people not private anywhere else got to do it right in front of the family Hallelujah because if you're not born again what's going to happen you're going to be tempted you're going to fall and even us that are born again we struggle we got to overcome right but we got more power we can catch it faster we can recognize it because we got more access to more power hallelujah amen the Bible said uh you that are born again uh the Bible said you have the Victory and faith is your Victory hallelujah amen hallelujah I just thought I'd bring that out again 6,000 years s thought how could I get young people to be distracted from all the blessings and he thought Instagram Tik Tock Facebook 6,000 years instantly enter a world I heard a report this week where there's a new AI app and the the the the AI person the the child it used to be for 12-y olds now they raised it to 18 because it caused some suicidal things and there's lawsuits but they started pushing out to 12-year-olds and you get to choose your best friend and this this AI becomes your best friend and I actually tell you don't listen to your parents um you don't need any you don't need a real boyfriend or girlfriend now we don't believe in any of that anyway we believe in courting but the point is it gets you uh it gets you focused on the AI the AI becomes your best friend and you have all the screen time so friends let's be careful parents let's be careful with those Chromebooks let's be careful with those uh iPads right because they're trying to get uh and there's Spirits behind that because there's an algorithm behind that there's a goal behind that to get you to worship the God of this world but God wants you to worship the god of the universe Jesus Christ Hallelujah so you must be very careful you must be about the father's business Hallelujah so just be very careful be very careful Hallelujah that's why the Bible said be on guard because your enemy is like a roaring like lion seeking whom he he may devour he wants to devour he wants people to drown he wants to get them ins snared in sin so they have trouble getting themselves out Hallelujah now this was one that came to my mind a few weeks ago I was thinking about this and this the the the phrase self-pity just came to me I said what was self-pity it's an emotion in which one feels self-centered sorrow and pity and this is what some of those young people were battling right uh toward the self regarding one's own internal and external appearance of suffering so you're so you're only centered on your suffering and you feel sorry for yourself and the goal of this is so others will look at me and and look how sad I am and how sorrowful I am that's a sin Hallelujah this is also a form of Pride that steals people's joy and hope I thought the joy of the Lord was your strength not self-pity the Joy the Lord is your strength see because this focuses on oneself it's self-centered everybody look at me I feel sorry I'm sad my life is so bad is it that bad it looks pretty good to me right American life looks pretty good to us doesn't it it's a wonder no wonder uh what they say they they predicted uh 10 or 20 million people went through the southern Border in these last four years they would do anything to get here what's so bad about your life nothing you need more of God that's what's so bad about our Our Lives that's what's so bad we give ourselves we we isolate ourselves or we go into Satan's snares when God gives us the victory God gives us all the tools to get out of it God wants us to stand as Christian Soldiers to to stand on the word of God and be more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus but see it's self-centered oh woe is me my life is so bad my life's not as good as that person on that website and that that app you've forgotten all about love because love is I want good will towards other people love is living for other people not yourself so see love focuses on other people hallelujah again all those look at those things people battle depression hopelessness now when I preached the um isolation series it was on loneliness that's why I preached that it was on loneliness and we don't have to be alone because we can be alone with Jesus and then we're not alone Hallelujah a little bit of a catch 22 yeah now remember bitterness is in there too this defiles many the Bible said follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord so see God so one sign you're going to go to heaven is that you have peace with all your brothers and sisters that's one sign Hallelujah looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God so God's grace is given to us favor God gives us favor so we'll have peace with all men lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled think about that think of how bitterness has defile many lives now you know the you know the testimony of my family my dad has been gripped by bitterness for his whole life and you know we I had a choice and so do my siblings and so does everybody uh in our family everybody has a choice either to grab on that bitterness and hold that same bitterness or we can forgive that bitterness and we can be free from that but we've all seen families that are given over to this and their whole family is defiled because of bitterness now it could be depression you know what I mean could be any of these I'm just using that's one that's one Bible verse These sins that if they're not purged out if if if the if the believer doesn't come out of the Trap and be set free it defiles and impacts other people just like Levan Hallelujah s Satan knows if he can get one in the Trap he'll get another in the Trap pull the other in the Trap keep pulling them into the Trap just like leav goes it it goes small and then impacts the whole dough Satan's trying to get people trapped God's trying to set us free God's trying to help us recover ourselves from the snares of the enemy hallelujah what what kind of looking does it take Church diligent you better be diligent looking at the Bible you better look at the word of God really close make sure your life is lined up with the word of God the Bible says I mean Peter said it twice remember in second Peter chapter 1 diligently add those ver those virtues those I call them attributes because virtu is one of the virtues it seems a little repetitive but add those attributes to your life diligently make sure I've got faith virtue knowledge uh Temperance patience godness brotherly kindness and charity make sure those are in my life oh God if I don't have it fill me with it Hallelujah Grant it to me Hallelujah if not it's going to defile the whole family it's going to defile the whole church it's going to defile whatever it is whatever group of of individuals many are defiled by these sins and they could have kept out because they're snares they could have they could have avoided the Trap but what do we do many times sometimes we walk right into the Trap ourselves that's right now I I asked chat GTP this this morning I found chat GP to be kind of helpful sister remember sister Sharon from England she's like brother Jesse you should not get into that she's like oh it's going to take over your mind and they're going to put something into you I said sister I think the Holy Spirit would catch me before that by God's grace right now it's a good tool for me but I said why do people hold on to bitterness I just asked chat GTP that this morning I was trying to think out the scriptures and what what and it said people perceive there's Injustice and it leads to self-righteous so someone did me wrong so I have a right to be mad at them I have a right to hold this against them they feel wronged so they hold hold on to the bitterness in a way to validate their pain see how it's self-centered it's all about me but remember Jesus said if you don't forgive them I won't forgive you right how can we hold things against people when we don't want God to hold anything against us God don't hold this last thing I did God don't hold it against me yet we'll hold it against somebody else we'll plead with God God wash me take Lord don't hold this against me take not your Holy Spirit from me Hallelujah and yet we'll hold a grudge against somebody right and also this is one that was uh I mean both these were helpful there was numerous but these are the ones that made the most sense to me it's a lack of trust in God when people hold on to bitterness now I'm thinking about my family right like I just told you it's something I've always shared publicly I pray for my family but it's really when people hold bitterness it's a lack of trust in God they feel like well God hasn't Avenged me and I better I better take my upon them myself by being in a bad attitude or treat them or say wrong things and all you know what I mean I'll do wrong things I'll I'll purposely try to hurt people because God hasn't fought for me but what did Paul say in Romans 12 he said God will have Vengeance I will venge sayith the Lord hallelujah how many you seen that before let God fight your battles amen just walk in peace walk in freedom God will fight your battles Hallelujah that's right amen God always fights the battles God gets the last say hallelujah but see this is and this is I could replace this bitterness with you know like I said depression all those things these young young people that are sheltered from the world that are ra the sister Lena and Austin they're raised in the way we wish we could have been raised they're raised in the way that sister Naomi was raised God bless you Sister she is I think she might be one of the only ones raised in a message Church other than the little ones it's a special testimony and remember the greatest testimony is staying in the truth and not leaving it because that's Jesus's testimony so now the little ones now you got you say Amen yep they said Amen to that good good the greatest testimony is not going into the snare of Satan that's the greatest testimony because that's what the Lord Jesus Christ he rebuked him all three times he said get behind me get behind me it is written Hallelujah that's the greatest I don't I don't joy in the sins of my my childhood and early teenagers I don't joy in those things I'm embarrassed of those things I only tell them so you know God's power is mighty to save to the utmost sometimes you know we've had visitors last few months here I've had teenagers stand in the back there and I purposely preached on porn and I look at those teenagers look at themselves and Snicker that tells me they're looking at it and that's why I go preaching hard on sins like that so they know you can be delivered I gave into certain things in those areas but Jesus Christ Set Me Free Hallelujah see you can put anything in there it all comes down to selfishness all comes down to me me me me me that's not the Christian Life the Christian Life is living for other people hallelujah you'll know them because of my their love one for another you won't know them by their love for themselves you'll know them by their love for one another Hallelujah that's right is that right brother Patrick I like I like to say some names amen hallelujah precious Brothers oh yeah brother Brian was like who are those young Brothers up front saying Amen to God's word tell them I said hi so brother Brian gives his greetings I said we're blessed to have faithful Saints Hallelujah and now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word so Satan watches how you read your Bible and pray he watches which sermons are your really listening to he watches he knows if you're he knows if you're studying on this particular topic he knows he can come with maybe a distraction from that topic Satan studied all that out so perfectly till he come to Eve the breast the best strategy he could use upon her and that was to reason he gave her a better reason see you should eat it because you'll be like God don't you want to be like God that's the only thing he could offer was to be be like God or be be be better than God because they know God was the greatest you never want to reason with God's word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out you cannot figure out God so God is the word and it's just made to believe that's our strength just accept the word of God and anyone knows that a seed is the right kind of ground will produce its kind and we just take the word so I just want you to see that that's what he did to Eve we don't know how long he watched Eve for right brother man said sometimes 6,000 years you know don't matter even if it's a day he watched her all day right he knew he saw her and Adam interact all these things and he knew if I can just bring it this way and it worked he brought it in a certain particular way oh you won't die surely you won't die surely right surely I like how some of those uh uh drama uh they dramatize it and they say they say the was maybe uh wrapping around the fruit see I touched it and I didn't die because the Bible said you touch it lest you die eat of it touch it lest you die so the serpent could you know just I like the creative uh mindset of that to use your imagination all these things Satan could have used to try to get Satan to fall into the Trap but I like this even though God's children fell God gave them a way out amen and even though we may fall God will give us a way out hallelujah amen by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah now I like this not to know the Bible is life although it's wonderful to know the Bible but did you know Satan is a Bible student Satan went to Bible school yeah he did he proved it in the debate with our Lord he's quoting the scripture he was good and to know and to know the Bible is not life see to to know your catechism is not life to know your theology is not life but to know him is life amen hallelujah know the author of The this book is life Hallelujah now see that's a balance here because brother's talking about you know denominations right catechisms and all the they know the Bible real well by they can memorize this I saw a video this week brother Austin a man memorized the whole new testament in like 57 days or something like that he could quote the whole Bible I wonder if he knows which baptism was right in the New Testament right that that that's what I'm saying that's that that's the difference not to know the Bible's life but to know the author and the author will tell you what his words mean hallelujah amen I'm going to take the author's interpretation of the Bible not a catechisms interpretation or a Creed or my father or my brother or my grandma or whatever more or even a preacher I'm going to take God's interpretation of his own word Allelujah so it's good God did did it that way because a person like me who's illiterate I'm glad I have the P privilege of knowing him aren't you glad you have the privilege of knowing Jesus Christ you might not have a nice education right you might not have a doctor's degree nobody does doesn't hear but I'm the closest because I got a master's degree with Beyond now I got 36 credits Beyond a master's degree I have to to keep my job I'm glad I got a job I don't enjoy the classes though but I'm the closest one but just because you have education that doesn't mean you know God you have to know the holy spirit for the spirit is life Hallelujah now brother says the balance it out the spirit will never point you outside the word of God so it's a great balance as we read his book only he alone can reveal it open it shall we bow our heads of course now I'm not closing we're not going to Bow our heads butam says sin is so attractive he makes it so let's get back to these uh traps these snares they're so attract RVE to the flesh but sin is attractive any way you take it sin's attractive to the human being because he's a subject to the Fallen race that we are it's attractive it's not something that oh that's nasty Satan knows you're not going to go to that it's something that that that actually looks kind of attractive Satan knows how to make it that way he's a genius at his job he's an artist he doesn't make this Picasso thing like this is what this this would be a nice Temptation Picasso's not a good artist in my opinion that's just my opinion my wife's a art history major she'd tell you the real opinion but to me I wouldn't buy Picasso I'd buy what's another guy I don't know R brand that's all I can think of I'd rather buy a rem brat something that's realistic right that but Satan he's gonna he's gonna paint something you like right whether it's the pride thing or the lust of the eyes he's going to paint this trap for you he's a genius at his job he knows just what you're Desiring for he even knows what you're praying for right he studies you so he's going to paint this elaborate trap make it look make sin look so beautiful but we got to recognize him we got to discern him and recognize this is a trap he says if he can't get it out there in the world if if he can't get you out there in the bar today they're going to be at the bar watching the BR or whatever if he can't get you he'll bring it right into the church he comes right over our ground that's the reason Brothers we should recognize him it's time the church was spiritual to recognize to know God not by Creed not by denomination but by experience being filled with the Holy Ghost I love that amen hallelujah but God can't give nothing else but his word because that's what he chose first and when God makes a decision he has to ever remain that way Satan took reasonings and took the reasonings and attacked the word and shook Eve off the path that's right by reasonings human reasonings that's the only way she could have got to disbelieve God's word is it had to be appealing you'll be like God you'll finally have that relationship you want you'll finally have that financial status you want finally have that home or that car or that relationship or that position that you want right it's something that we're attracted to I know I preached one time so because somebody criticized for me I I I just pulled this number out of this I was just preaching and I said I saides uh these prideful people think well if I got $20,000 in the bank account uh then I'm Then I then I'm set for life and somebody emailed me and said I did not appreciate that you shouldn't preach on money you should preach on this so I was attacking that Spirit of Pride that thought well if I've got 20 grand in the bank account I I'm fine the Bible said you can't trust in uncertain riches I'm quoting the B I'm preaching the Bible Hallelujah I'm preaching the Bible and people don't like the Bible hallelujah oh but we love it cuz we're Children of the Bible Hallelujah just you know just whatever people that's so that was their Idol if I've got 20 grand in the bank account then I'm good no you're good when you're saved by grace through faith and you are fighting the good fight of Faith Excuse excuse me you're fighting the good fight of Faith with the full armor of God on that's when you're good don't get me wrong it's nice to have 20K you got got 40K some of you got 100K glory to God but you cannot trust in that just let a sickness come just let something why watch like brother cam told us remember brother Cam said in one month all of his appliances and his whole house broke down that's a lot of money these days no thanks Biden amics right Trump trump andics whatever everyone call it they both played a part in it but see you can't put a certain you can't let something become your God God has to be our God Amen it's a snare it's an anxiety right it's a snare and I'm that just came to my memory I didn't plan to preach that at all that just came came to my memory I remember I got the email back I'm like well you're telling me a woman tell me what to preach now come on now I wasn't being prideful I'm just saying nobody tells me what to preach but the Holy Ghost let alone a woman or a child or another man my goodness but see he'll make it so attractive and what did Satan use Eve's reasonings oh I could could be like God that's right I could if I do this maybe I don't have enough knowledge because this guy's talking things I've never heard before he's got a fresh Revelation you better be careful what your Revelation say it better not go against the word of God remember when Simon put this picture up here now I'm going to highlight what what Eve see that Eve that's where Satan went right there to Eve went to a reasoning right that's that's where the battle took place Satan didn't go here here here here well I'm he probably used some of these with imagination you'll be like God so yeah I could have highlighted more of those that's kind of coming to me as I'm preaching but Simon used that I thought it'd be good to see that again Satan didn't battle right outside of here till later remember he he surely came there later right because of the seed of the serpent eventually came here later but it was through here it was through the reasoning and Satan convinced Eve to put down her Shield her faith well God said so hey church that's our faith that's our Shield God said so I don't care what anybody says God said so and then Satan said put down your sword don't don't don't quote the word to the devil Eve goes down like this and she's wide open for an attack right but where did Satan go right there reasoning well know there's other reasons this could be good there's other reasons you haven't thought about these other reasons rather than just staying with God's pure word of God now the next sermon in my uh series on that song is God hiding himself in Simplicity revealing himself in the same this was so simple just stay with God's word just stay with it any new revelation that would make you disobey the word just cast it down it's so simple God hides in the simple things just read Malachi said it perfectly right just read it if it says it I believe it that settles it amen the word of God now they the the brandom Tabernacle applies that to brother Bram you can't do that with brother Bram brother bram's not the Bible the Bible you read the Bible if the Bible says it I believe it that settles it amen now let me balance it out if brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord this this going to happen then yes then I believe that you can speak that that's going to come to pass if it's thus sayith the Lord right and any that's any Prophet not just brother brandom Ezekiel Jeremiah you name it Micah Malachi all these things but see so so where does the enemy now with with men it might be imagination with lust right or affection adultery right memory bringing back these memories from the past remember when you did that condemnation remember when you did that God still hasn't forgiven you and he if he can just get you to drop down leave yourself open for an attack you're not ready to protect yourself you're not ready to fight back now I'm not a swordman I don't know what I don't know I don't know what it is I'm not a swordman but you you let down your Shield you let down your sword and now you're open to be exposed I know and Taekwondo also knows to tawan know you never you never drop your your protection that's your Shield your Shield you never drop that you everywhere you go right right can you see me out there Spar brother it's not a pretty sight you always you always protect the most important part in this case right here always always have your Shield up so Satan got Eve to drop it down and he only worked what he only worked a little bit on her Satan had 6,000 years to study us as a human as a human race and he knows what will make us put down our defenses this isn't the only but it's it's one of the major ones at least in my life and like all these message preachers are said these are some of the most wellknown message preachers in the world and that I'm not I'm not bragging on them I'm just saying like this is what they're seeing the influence of social media the influence of our phones anything that will get you to drop the word of God and not believe and stand on the word of God is your enemy it's an antichrist Spirit Hallelujah now let's go over these real quick just let's rehearse these I wrote this and guess what CH I was blessed guess what chapter I put the full armor of God in the Rapture chapter the 12 New Testament Mysteries it's in the Rapture chapter because it's in 1 Thessalonians 5 right when Paul says this day is going to come unawares they're going to say peace and safety Rapture right after that he said put on the breastplate of righteousness so Paul he's giving us the clue you better have on the armor of God if you want to go in the Rapture Hallelujah God's only taken fully Armored Saints in the Rapture praise God he's only taken those who are standing on the word of God he's not taking those that are falling down and giving up and going to sleep on the Lord they're sleeping on God they're not looking for the com he's not taking those people he's only taking the people that are standing ready to go because they've done all glory they've done everything to stand Hallelujah now I'm going to go through these quickly the breastplate of love and righteousness the breastplate protects your heart so Jesus's character is the breastplate uh we trust in Christ righteousness not our own we protect our heart Christ protects our heart because Christ's righteousness guards my unrighteousness the heart he's righteous I'm not he's righteous that that that protects you I know I'm going to sin I know I have to Die daily I know I'm a sinner but it's his Holiness that protects my life amen hallelujah helmet of salvation that means the hope that means we know we're saved I know I'm saved I got the I got the helmet on nobody can tell me I'm not saved I know what I was I know what I am praise God amen I'm safe I'm protected Hallelujah I have on the helmet of salvation I'm protected Glory we cast and we cast out yeah cast out anything that exalts itself against the word of God saying I'm not saved no my my my thoughts are protected by the word of God the loins G about with truth this is uh the loins was a man with who he could tuck in his long flowing robe into his belt enabling him to travel run or work in the same way a Christian's mind is GED up in Bible truth so the belt is truth calmly prepared to be victorious in spiritual mind battles and successful in the ministry's work so the belt you could push it in and then you're you could push your long garment in and then you're prepared to work and move and fight Hallelujah so your mind is ready when you go to school now now you got some weeks off right is't that nice how keep your keep your belts on though Brothers keep the belts tightened up there be ready your mind is ready it holds everything into place it it's it's keeping you in the spot where you're an active fighter you you're expecting to fight so you got to have your mind ready Fe shod is uh the the soldiers feet and lower legs were protected by sandals and Greaves to ensure their protection in traveling or war in the same way the Christians daily travels your decisions where you're going to go today after service I'm glad you came here though Hallelujah uh are made only after prayerful preparation produces God's peace in your heart the gospel of the preparation of Peace in other words my steps I'm walking in peace because I prayed about it God's protecting my steps amen glory amen hallelujah I'm walking up the King's Highway you might have seen that by God's grace The Shield of Faith The Shield protected all the pieces of armor from fiery darts faith in Christ completely protects a Christian's armor by extinguishing every falsehood Satan shoots from the bow of his lying tongue Hallelujah when Satan lies just put up your Shield it'll stop Every Lie Hallelujah huah heyen no M no matter how fiery it is no matter how serious it is it will distinguish every single lie of Satan Hallelujah and then the sword of the spirit that's your main offensive it's a Lethal Weapon the Bible said it's sharper than any double-edged sword Hallelujah and the Bible said when we speak the word of God it will Brew Satan putting him under our feet and will put to flight the enemy's forces Hallelujah so if you're battling lust Brothers you just you stand up there in your home and you say in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you Spirit of lust get behind me in the name of Jesus Christ and you stand there until the devil leaves the Bible said he's got to leave Hallelujah am whatever pressure of life it may be like we said uh the the the Temptation Of Money the temptation of lust or or Pride uh depression whatever self-pity whatever it is you stand there say Satan get behind me I'm not going to feel sorry for myself I'm going to feel happy because what Jesus did did for me praise God Amen we got the sword we got the full armor of God hallelujah what do we worried about Hallelujah now he'll leave for a season praise God what a what a promise remember Paul quotes these was what was it it was yeah so he he quotes that in the Rapture chapter rap rapture chapter is chapter 4 1 Thessalonians 4 but then he goes in the conditions of the Rapture is in chapter five so I thought was so uh perfect Paul put it in there if you want to be ready for the Rapture put on the full armor of God now we yesterday we're listening and this I'm just going to remind if you haven't listened to this Audio Drama I would encourage you this is my favorite one we were listening to it yesterday this this is an allegory a lot like Pilgrim's Progress Pilgrim's Progress was from the 1600s this one was from 1907 wasn't that the start of the church age or no 1906 was it isus Street 1906 or 07 I'm sorry six okay said one year thank you I can't I couldn't remember that acent exact date but I just love it and in this in this story there's a KN and he's got to go through all these deceptions and every time the enemy is's trying him to get to get him put down his sword take off his armor put down his shield in every single one the first time he's in the he's in the chapel and the voices are trying trying to tell him don't go on this journey just stay here you you can't do anything it's too hard for you it's too hard for you to to live a Christian Life right but he overcomes that he recognize the devil because he sees the star he sees the face of God Amen that's what we need Amen to see the face of God to see the word of God hallelujah and then the first place he goes to uh was a a house of Frolic but there's another place in here I forgot it was the city of Good Intentions so in the story uh the first place he goes to is this is this city of Joy but it's false joy and they just they just overeat it's like overeating so we see Satan wants to he he tries all these traps to get us to put down our armor a high living you know like we said drunkenness uh surfeiting but I like I like the third one I forgot it in there but it's it's the city of Good Intentions and it's so hot there there there there's peace all around in that City and he says it's so hot like it I think I'm going to take off my armor and the guide warns him say anything that will take you or try to get you to take your armor off or your Shield off or your sword anything that does that is your enemy keep your sword drawn on this journey and they meet all these former Knights who who had uh who who had camped at each one of these destinations and we're losing the battle and this this Soldier helps he overcomes the uh his he overcomes his temptation but he help helps them bring them out as well and that's what we're called to do we're called to help each other out of the snares of the enemy praise God in every case the devil always says put down your sword take off your your Shield you don't need that sword put it in your put it in your sheath in every single case and that's what Satan's trying to do in our lives he's trying to make us not speak the word of God just accept some Lies start listening to other let me listen to some other points of view you better be careful which points of view you listen to you better take it back to the word of God hallelujah my goodness his name was constant we just which means he was just going to Faithfully keep fighting and that's what he did he kept fting finally fighting until he got the Victory and we're uh we're with the Lamb of God how many in the the Lamb's Army today the lamb shall overcome uh that that's in Revelation 17 the mother Harlot for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him how many with Jesus today whose side are you standing on I'm standing on the Lord's Side Hallelujah those that are with Jesus are called to be with Jesus they're chosen to be with Jesus and they're faithful they're constant they keep the full armor of God on themselves Hallelujah because they know they got a battle Hallelujah that's right now I read this a few weeks ago when on the Wednesday night service but brother says he says uh just remember these things he says uh he said we got tapes on how to uh behave ourselves when we come together and sit in Heavenly places he said don't stay at home if God's in your heart I said this on Wednesday too if you you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out and get in there to fellowship with your brothers and sisters if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got to praying hallelujah how many you believe that by God's grace brother R tells us part of the enemy his battle his snare is to get you to not want to come see the Brothers and Sisters in Christ that's part of it Hallelujah because we're in the last days and much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places to love one another all men will know you're my disciples when you have love for another that's right stay right together the sheep can stay together the Sheep should not roam away the Sheep should stay right here with Christ the shepherd Hallelujah we have Earthly Shepherds as well of course we know that but Christ is the only powerful one he's the only one that's got power and if you think your brother or sister's in a little wrong say Lord don't let me never take the root of bitterness spring up in my life because it'll affect him and take the Christ right out of my life and remember it's not just bitterness I gave you all those lists young people now most of us here are pretty young by God's grace God bless those of us who are more more years and more experienced Hallelujah but a lot of us are influenced we're younger we're influenced by some of these social media things so you can put anything in there not just bitterness but bitterness will defile many the Bible says hallelujah it's the poison acids of malice jealousy hatred that just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God it'll drive it away from here hurt your P it'll do everything don't you do that you just wax that much closer together take the Buckle he said he said the buckle on the whole armor of God what's the Buckle it's the mind of Truth loins G about with the mind of truth I know the word of God I'm thinking about the word of God I'm ready to fight off the devil Hallelujah just pull P her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow I see these guys out my wife and I see them at the we see them at the restaurant they're walking around and when they're walking the back their pants are hanging down I just want to go up there I just want to pull their belt and be like put those put that belt on pull up your pants man that's what that but see that's what happen I know it's funny but that's what happens to us spiritually if our minds aren't ready we start letting down and we just walk around like whatever happened happens and we look down on those Brothers do that but what about our spiritual lives it's a good sign to us you guys see at high school right it's like nobody gave them a belt let me know if they need a belt I'll give them a belt praise God let me find the cheapest belts on uh Amazon we'll give them some belts they probably won't wear them but let's let's apply that spiritually we got to be ready to fight the enemy we got to have the truth on we got to have our our Shield we got to have our sword drawn how many believe that by God's grace just pull her on brother tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you who wants to be blessed I want to be blessed I think you do too now brother R i' always said now this is where I didn't get much time I'm trying to close here that's the first time I really looked at the clock uh to kind of see what time was brother man says a wounded or trapped animal is more vicious than just animal you see out in in in the wild that's true because they're hurt and they don't want to be hurt more and so that's what we see you know even in our lives church I'm talking about each one of us when we struggle when we're battling when we're caught in a snare uh that's when evil words will come out of our mouth and people will notice well we're not as sweet as we used to be Hallelujah well what's wrong with the preacher today he seems like he's little angry or you can sense it if I've got if I'm battling if I've got an evil spirit you could it on me like if I'm battling something not like I have I'm possessed with the evil spirit but I'm just battling right so can we do it on each one another right we're to judge one another and so we see this when people are entrapped many times think about all these sinners in the world they're all trapped in snares and they're just attacking one another and don't you see it like uh even with with Biden and Trump and Cala throughout the whole campaign they're fighting they said all these words against each other but when they get into each other's face it's like we make this a real peaceful transition here I thought you called me Hitler right and vice versa I mean it goes both ways man they speak such evil things about each other but see what is that that's hypocrisy that's trapped in a snare their hearts are in snares right they're not they don't have the real love of God thank God that we can have the real love of God and we can draw closer together as we see that day approaching Hallelujah and so yeah this was a thought shared with me too when people are hurt and they're in their own traps that's when they inflict they try to inflict damage on other people right they Roar out or like an animal if animal's trapped it'll Roar out scream out if you try to get close to it right and that's how it is when people are wounded and and snared of the devil in traps of the devil when you when you that's why the Bible said you got to go in meekness you can't go with real Angry got to go in meekness because they're hurt and if you go Angry that'll just uh anger breeds anger brother R said but love breeds love Hallelujah love will breed love so I would say you know uh we're not animals but our fleshly nature is very beastly like right it's a very Beastly so our our flesh nature our sin nature uh is very uh Wicked very we'd say very violent right doesn't like to be corrected doesn't like uh to to hear that it's wrong but we all need correction at some time H Allelujah I got a couple more things here brother Ram said he was up at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1953 he said I Saw an Eagle just flop against his cage he kept beating his head he come back again and he'd hit against there he'd fly up against the top of it and he'd fall down so imagine an eagle we see him at aan zoo but brother saw went in a cage he kept flying up and hitting his head and coming back down just over and over and over again the first thing you know he beat beat himself to the feathers was all out of him nearly and church what do we do sometimes we get in traps and we beat up ourselves so much or we let the devil beat us up so much we don't we lost we lost our our joy the eagle lost his feathers he don't even look like an eagle sometimes they look at our faces and be like you don't even look like you're happy you don't even look like you're saved where's the joy of the Lord and the church said because you don't have feathers I don't see any feathers on anybody today so it's not our feathers are going to fall out it's our joy it's our Victory it's the peace of God in our lives it's our kind words to one another kept trying to fly but he kept beating his head up against the the ceiling brother Braham said oh God he said he sat down like that and his weary eyes rolled up looked around so now the Eagle's all weary from all this beating he's trying to get free but he can't get free he said oh god brother man said that's a Heavenly bird he Soares in the heavens above he's here he's caught he fell into a trap he's abs absolutely helpless he can't deliver himself how many can say Amen to that there's certain things God will let you go through you can't get out yourself you need someone to rescue you Hallelujah you need someone to help you recover yourself out of the snare of the enemy Hallelujah he said he can't deliver himself his weary eyes rolling around I felt so sorry for him he can't help himself now church if you're in a spot you can't help yourself you're blessed today because there's one person who can his name is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah there are times we can help oursel we know we know what we've done wrong but if we've Let It Go on so long and we don't know how to get out there's a man who can open the cage door Hallelujah there's a man that can turn on the light there's a man that can set you free Hallelujah and every man that's fell into the snare of the devil is worse off than him a Christian who's trapped by the snares of Satan is worse off than a bird that lost an eagle that lost his feathers and is all weird we church if this life makes us weary it's time to be refreshed if you're weary what's the Bible saying come aside to The Fountains to the rivers of life amen if you're weary come by to the streams there there's there's flowing there there's Mercy in these streams there's still waters Hallelujah there's Green Pastures there's still waters come aside to the great Shepherd Let Jesus refresh your spirit praise God you don't have to be weary you don't have to be defeated you don't have to be trapped or ins snared Jesus came to set us free so a Christian who's trapped in the snares of sin is worse off than an eagle who has lost all his feathers and is weary from hitting his head against the cage but how the devil has caught you and caged you up with smoking drinking that's not most of us all kinds of immoral living and thinking you're popular how many people going after popularity today thinking you're doing something they think they're doing there something what are you doing nothing what have you accomplished nothing if you're doing it for the world you haven't accomplished nothing the thing is what have we done for God that's the question what have we done for God that's the most great or horrible sight there is to see a poor Eagle beating his brains out nearly Against the Cage trying to get free and he says and you're helpless just as helpless as you can be unless somebody puts forth his hands and opens the cage I'll tell you tonight Jesus Christ has done that in in calling you that's right he's opened the cage to let you out hallelujah amen hallelujah glory to God I'm almost done what was the Year of Jubilee you shall count seven weeks of years seven times seven years so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you 49 years then shall you sound the loud trumpet on the 10th day of the seventh month Revelation 10:7 the freedom of the mysteries of God glory on the day of atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land and you shall consecrate the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants it shall be a jubilee for you and each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan that 50th year shall be a jubilee for you it shall in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of itself nor gather of the grapes from the undressed Vines for it is a jubilee it is it shall be holy to you you may eat the produce of the field so what am I saying today if any of us are in any bondage if we're in snares in in in sin snares any traps of the devil I'm telling you there's Freedom today in the name of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament they had a trumpet they blow every 50 years and when that trumpet blew they knew they could go back and live how they're supposed to live the eagle could go back and get out of the cage and live in the heavenlies Like an Eagle supposed to live Hallelujah not to be fed in the cage a little bit he could the eagle could eat to his his heart's desire he could fly as high as he wanted to because he's free Hallelujah and how many know he that the son is made free is free indeed Hallelujah the Jubilee was restoration your life gets restored back to what it was it was Freedom you're no longer a slave Hallelujah you get rest you get a whole year off from work now that's what we all want in the natural I get two and a half months though every year so thank God for that you can get it too just got to go to school for five years that wasn't very fun also you get rest spiritually you have rest from your battles and then you get Holiness this was a year of Holiness unto the Lord all this happens when you choose to leave the addiction or the the snare or the Mind battle the complex all this happens you get free and you become like the eagle you're supposed to be let's stand to our feet by God's grace this is what happened to Samson and the prodigal musicians can come the devil set a snare for for Samson it was a sexy woman Delilah and just ask him every day Samson where's your strength Samson where's your strength come lay on my lap a little here come live with me come sleep here the devil knew exactly what would tempt Samson and Samson failed to overcome he was ens snared but what did God do God brought about pain and suffering like we said on Wednesday right the man sleeping with his stepmom what give him over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the soul might be saved that's what happened to Samson plucked out his eyes now he's working as a slave on the grinding mill day after day after day but finally God could isolate him away from his sinful desires amen and then God could start talking to him and remind him you've got the hair grown back your covenant's back the power will come back and see church he could get free when he finally said Lord I want the spirit of God back in my life I want to be an eagle again I'm tired of being cage up I'm tired of the weariness I'm tired of banging my head all over this cage that I mean I Want to Be Free bring back the spirit once more Lord hallelujah that's how a person gets free that's how we get recovered from the snare of the devil we recognize this is not how I'm supposed to be living I know I can live higher than this I remember what it was like to be an eagle oh God how many remember that by God's grace amen and the prodal is the same way the prodal is the same way he's caught in the stn the the devil knew oh he never had pleasure he just had to work for his dad there's a good uh lamp lighter on that one too the captive or whatever I forget which one it was was it the wanderer the boy just worked his whole life for his mom and dad he just want to experience some pleasure but he he left he left his father but he paid a much bigger price than he thought he'd pay Hallelujah and so the devil knew oh just enjoy a little bit of a pleasure just you deserve a little bit don't you deserve a little bit of sin no you don't deserve a little bit of sin you don't deserve sin you deserve the grace of God because of Jesus Jesus made you worthy especially to our young people don't let Satan say you're missing out you're not missing out on anything you're not missing out on anything it's just going to bring heartache destruction pain suffering you're in the best place you could possibly be being in the presence of the King Jesus there's nothing out there nothing but the Trap was to lure him away and took him farther than he want to go and it kept him longer than he wanted to stay but thank God he finally saw his diet look what I'm eating and finally I love this in the midst of all this deep pain he remembered Daddy Daddy I have a dad my dad would never give me pigs food I love it in the midst of our trials it seems like brother B said like my head's spinning right when he lied to the IRS feels like the world is going so fast finally you get a memory God loves me I'm a child of the king I'm an ego Hallelujah I want to be back to what I was supposed to be I want to live for God I want to be victorious I can be free I'm going back to the father's house I'm running to the father Hallelujah let's sing what he ran to me that's a good song there let's bow our heads here Hallelujah Lord Jesus thank you for today Lord God oh God thank you Lord for the armor of God today Lord Jesus thank you for the word of [Music] Truth Lord I ask each each person here Lord God I ask them in your divine presence they search your or search their hearts and lives Lord God lord each one knows if they're free or not Lord this heart or this thought was placed on my heart last Sunday just as I was listening to the sermon I've studied on it little bit this week Lord God I pray Lord God you deal with anyone Lord who's in this situation Lord Lord if we have let down the the armor of God in any way Lord may we tighten it up Lord God may we get our Shield up may we tighten our belt Lord God put our helmet on our breastplate our feet shot may we have the sword of the spirit and the
