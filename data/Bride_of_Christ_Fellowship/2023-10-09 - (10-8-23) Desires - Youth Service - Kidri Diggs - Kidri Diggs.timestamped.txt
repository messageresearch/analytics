[14:46] but God knows all things amen we've
[14:49] couldn't have got together anytime
[14:51] sooner than this amen this is God's we
[14:55] have to believe his perfect will amen
[14:58] and that's our desire is to be in the
[15:00] will of God you know if you have your
[15:02] Bibles let's go to um Luke chapter
[15:07] 15 Luke chapter
[15:17] 15 Luke chapter
[15:21] 15 and let's start reading at um verse
[15:27] 11
[15:32] the Bible says he said a certain
[15:36] man had two sons and the younger of them
[15:40] said to his
[15:42] father father give me the portion of my
[15:46] give me the portion of goods that
[15:48] falleth to me and he divided unto them
[15:53] his
[15:54] living and not many
[15:57] days after
[15:59] the younger son gathered all together
[16:02] and took his journey into a far
[16:05] country and there wasted his substance
[16:08] with riotous
[16:10] living verse 14 and when he had spent
[16:15] all there arose a mighty famine in the
[16:19] land and he began to be in
[16:23] want amen may the Lord a blessing to the
[16:26] reading of his word you can have your
[16:31] seats you know um we're grateful for the
[16:37] grace of God and all that the Lord has
[16:40] done and and is doing you know because
[16:43] he's a a merciful god Even in our wrongs
[16:49] his judgments are righteous you know for
[16:52] God's his plan is always to keep us
[16:55] nearer to the Cross you know and and and
[16:59] and tonight I want to use for a thought
[17:02] hidden
[17:03] desires hidden desires now I'm sure uh
[17:08] uh most of you are familiar with the
[17:10] story of the prodal son but we want to
[17:14] dive into his life you know because I
[17:16] believe it's it's relevant to our
[17:19] children our young people you know our
[17:21] people at the church that we fellowship
[17:24] with even even young and old you know
[17:27] and um you know the Bible says as a man
[17:31] thinketh in his heart so is he you know
[17:34] but this is this this is so uh uh key
[17:38] for this very thought right here because
[17:41] you take a father and a mother who's
[17:43] doing everything they can do to raise
[17:45] their child right but that child has
[17:48] hidden desires and you know that that
[17:50] that father and that mother takes that
[17:52] child of church why for the benefit of
[17:55] their being Hallelujah for the benefit
[17:58] of their their future and even their
[17:59] present but that child has hidden
[18:02] desires and you know that that father
[18:04] you know he'll go out and work and maybe
[18:06] he'll establish a business and and and
[18:09] pull his son along and that son will go
[18:12] out and work with his father and still
[18:14] have hidden desires you know that that
[18:17] mother will you know uh teach her
[18:19] daughter how to cook and and you know
[18:21] how to clean and all the things that'll
[18:24] help her be a good wife or a good mother
[18:27] but she can still still have hidden
[18:30] desires and you know it's going to come
[18:32] an appointed time that either everything
[18:35] you will Tau for the good you're going
[18:37] to live into or everything you're
[18:40] Desiring is going to pull you away from
[18:42] it you know so I'm here to say tonight
[18:46] that let your desires be led by God
[18:50] because the thing see church I want you
[18:52] to understand desires can be desires of
[18:55] good and desires can be desires of evil
[18:59] Hallelujah and you may be thinking you
[19:01] say well brother DS I'm just thinking
[19:03] about it as a man thinketh in his heart
[19:07] so is he Hallelujah and church you may
[19:10] not realize young people you may not
[19:11] realize just turning to look at it
[19:14] Hallelujah will have an effect to draw
[19:17] you now as you read the Bible we go into
[19:20] the Bible we know the story of of of
[19:23] Abraham and lot now lot was in the
[19:26] family of Abraham Hal
[19:29] and just because he knew Abraham God
[19:31] extended him favor but lot had hidden
[19:37] desires oh my lot had hidden desires and
[19:41] the first opportunity he got Hallelujah
[19:45] those desires start to manifest and it
[19:48] was something simple they were on the
[19:50] journey what kind of Journey they were
[19:51] on they were on the Journey of God
[19:54] hallelujah the devil had no place until
[19:58] lot gave him an
[20:00] opportunity as long as he stayed with
[20:03] what God wanted his desires had no
[20:05] effect on
[20:08] him Hallelujah are you with me and
[20:13] church H H uh if if if we look and
[20:16] something arose where you know lot begin
[20:19] to ponder and pretty much find a way to
[20:23] fulfill what he was thinking about the
[20:25] opportunity came where he says okay I I
[20:28] kind of want to separate from Abraham he
[20:30] just a little too
[20:32] churchy he's just a little too messy or
[20:37] believer he's like okay you know I've
[20:39] been in this all my life but I I want to
[20:42] live my desires and the first thing he
[20:46] does he comes to Abraham with an
[20:48] agreement hallelujah how often we do
[20:51] that with the Lord Lord if you bless me
[20:53] with this I will
[20:56] this Hallelujah let me tell you Church
[20:59] firsthand that's not good to make
[21:01] Bargains with
[21:03] God because one thing you fail to
[21:05] realize God is going to keep his side of
[21:08] the
[21:09] bargain and if you don't then God has a
[21:13] right to judge you based upon you not
[21:16] fulfilling your part of the
[21:19] contract Hallelujah that's why when you
[21:21] do business is always important to have
[21:24] a contract because some people's word
[21:27] just like us means
[21:31] nothing sir Hallelujah they say well
[21:34] brother brother brother they say uh
[21:35] brother Jesse I'm going to make it to
[21:37] the meeting gave out their word and the
[21:40] time came for church to start at 3:00
[21:43] there were nowhere to be found or they
[21:45] had some kind of excuse their desire
[21:47] probably was to stay home all
[21:50] alone Hallelujah and church you know our
[21:54] word hallelujah has to mean something
[21:56] when it comes to God
[21:58] you know our word has to be able to rise
[22:01] above how we naturally feel amen and you
[22:05] know you look at lot and lot he says he
[22:08] says to Abraham hey you know there's a
[22:10] lot of green land over here why don't
[22:13] you let me take this and you take that
[22:15] and because Abraham had no hunger for
[22:18] anything else he said you
[22:22] decide Hallelujah Abraham was content
[22:25] living in the Providence of God
[22:28] see his desire was to fulfill whatever
[22:32] God had for him he wasn't looking for a
[22:35] way out Hallelujah two years later after
[22:38] Co some people still haven't gotten
[22:40] their way back
[22:42] on why because of their
[22:45] desires H hidden desires and Co just
[22:49] made an opportunity for them to skip
[22:52] church and never come
[22:54] back some of them are still skipping
[22:56] down the yellow brick road
[23:00] Hallelujah but one thing they F you know
[23:02] the story of of of of of of of Dorothy
[23:05] Hallelujah the wizard of ozs and all
[23:07] these things what was the name of that
[23:09] thing yeah had a wizard of O Okay
[23:12] Hallelujah you know the story of The
[23:14] Wizard of ozs and the yellow brick road
[23:16] and one thing they fail to realize that
[23:18] a witch was also on that
[23:21] road so why there Dorothy skipping down
[23:24] the road and she got her shiny shoes and
[23:26] everything that her desire Hallelujah
[23:29] was going to lead her also to a witch
[23:33] down her path and she didn't realized
[23:36] that that witch was a part of her path
[23:39] which was a part of her
[23:42] desire and church lot he says lot says
[23:45] to Abraham I'mma go this way and you
[23:47] stay you stay over here and then the
[23:50] Bible says hallelujah he pitched his
[23:52] tent toward Sodom he wasn't in Sodom yet
[23:57] he wasn't in in the world yet but as he
[23:59] pitched his tent Hallelujah to look at
[24:02] all these rappers and singers and Taylor
[24:04] Swift and all these other people just to
[24:07] look at them it begin to pull them into
[24:10] something they were always
[24:17] craving he wasn't in
[24:20] Sodom but just looking at it had a pull
[24:23] on it and you think about it every night
[24:25] he would go to sleep and he couldn't but
[24:28] see Sodom because his tient was pitched
[24:31] that
[24:33] way and if your life is H your desires
[24:37] are all about the things on Tik Tock and
[24:40] Facebook and IG and Twitter and all
[24:42] these other things that the world has to
[24:44] offer is going to pull you into ungodly
[24:50] desires come on because you're looking
[24:53] at it Hallelujah you're looking at it
[24:57] and what is going going to do is going
[24:59] to Hallelujah feed that unconverted part
[25:03] of you and all of us have an unconverted
[25:06] part of us it's called your
[25:11] flesh Hallelujah everybody in here with
[25:14] the Holy Ghost has a measure of uncon
[25:17] conversion in them it's called your
[25:19] flesh Hallelujah and as long as we are
[25:22] in flesh we have to protect our desires
[25:27] we have to protect our cravings and our
[25:30] wants and our longings because if you
[25:32] don't those things will lead you away
[25:35] from
[25:36] God now you fast forward years later he
[25:40] went from just looking at Sodom to now
[25:42] being the
[25:46] governor his hidden desires he wanted to
[25:49] be somebody great but he was already
[25:52] great as long as he stay with
[25:56] Abraham
[25:59] Hallelujah you think about all the time
[26:02] Abraham spent Hallelujah sewing into
[26:06] lot's life lot had hidden
[26:09] desires but Abraham had to let him
[26:12] go you know some parents we have to let
[26:14] you go go ahead and be great Hallelujah
[26:17] go ahead and live your best life and
[26:20] that best life will lead you into things
[26:22] Hallelujah that you could only imagine
[26:25] Hallelujah I'm here to say hallelujah
[26:28] your parents they are not the
[26:31] enemy cuz it's like this when you were
[26:33] babies Hallelujah and you was walking
[26:35] cross across the street they held your
[26:37] head and they protected you amen young
[26:40] people how many have ever known that
[26:43] protection of holding the hand of your
[26:45] parent guiding you from all danger and
[26:48] hurt and harm amen we can amen that you
[26:51] know there were stages of our life that
[26:53] our parents were our protectors and we
[26:56] knew it Hallelujah
[26:58] amen young girls run up in your father's
[27:00] arms and give you a hug because you felt
[27:03] safe hallelujah or your mom will pick
[27:05] you up and carry you over this because
[27:07] you felt safe now I want to I want to
[27:10] say to you when did that ever
[27:15] change when did the protection from a
[27:18] mother or father change concerning you
[27:22] it changed when you wanted to stop being
[27:26] protected
[27:29] it changed when you wanted to fulfill
[27:32] your own desires but let me say it
[27:35] Hallelujah mother and father is still
[27:38] have the have the HH the the desire to
[27:40] protect you it's just that there's
[27:42] things that you want they don't
[27:45] want so now it becomes a constant Battle
[27:48] of who's stronger
[27:50] H when all mom and dad is trying to do
[27:53] is still protect
[27:56] you
[27:58] now you would say as a young person Amy

[28:14] Hallelujah saw a child in front of that
[28:18] bus we've never seen it there's
[28:21] something in that parent to
[28:24] protect Hallelujah there something in a
[28:28] father to protect there's something in a
[28:31] mother to protect God put that in you
[28:34] Hallelujah because your child you
[28:36] children cannot protect
[28:43] yourself you need the wisdom of God to
[28:47] intercede Hallelujah and I ain't goingon
[28:49] to be long don't get
[28:50] nervous but I want you to appreciate
[28:53] Hallelujah the care of a loving house

[29:03] single and ready to
[29:05] mingle and Dad may be like son you don't

[29:17] knees Hallelujah have you crying for
[29:25] days hallelujah

[29:36] don't cuz tall dark and handsome may
[29:39] have you Angela Becky Simone and
[29:43] everybody
[29:44] else all at the same time you find
[29:47] yourself in a circus because you had
[29:50] hidden
[29:55] desires but what I want you to see see
[29:57] church is because of Lot's desires he
[30:02] put his own family in
[30:05] danger now he has to raise children in
[30:08] Sodom H now his wife has to be subject
[30:12] to all the other things going on in
[30:14] Sodom how did he get there lot desires
[30:18] of looking at
[30:19] it now everybody either has to conform
[30:23] to Sodom or stand their ground that they
[30:26] will talk with Abraham
[30:28] and here we are Hallelujah here we are
[30:30] as Believers and young people I want you
[30:33] to understand you can stand your ground
[30:35] and still be
[30:37] loved Hallelujah you can stand your
[30:40] ground and still have
[30:43] friends Hallelujah I know a young lady
[30:46] at my church Hallelujah me and her had a
[30:48] conversation one time and she was like
[30:50] you know well I I'm I'm the only one of
[30:52] my age in our church and I really don't
[30:54] have no friends and my thought to her
[30:56] was if you you get saved and really give
[30:58] your life to Christ Christ will give you
[31:01] friends and she took that advice
[31:03] Hallelujah she took that advice she she
[31:06] really got consecrated with God and
[31:09] serving the lord and singing and praying
[31:11] and dressing right and everything and
[31:13] every time you turn around somebody's
[31:15] following her to
[31:18] church Hallelujah adults are following
[31:21] her to church young people are following
[31:23] her to church the managers on her job
[31:26] are following her the church what is it
[31:29] they see somebody who desires to be
[31:31] right in God's
[31:35] eyes and if you desire to be right in
[31:39] God's eyes God will fulfill your
[31:44] desires God will give you real Christian
[31:47] friends that'll produce Christian
[31:54] happiness Hallelujah cuz I have brothers

[43:10] up
[43:12] hallu
[43:14] Church she was supposed to go the first
[43:17] time she dropped dead but God being so
[43:21] merciful Hallelujah he gave her four
[43:23] days to get her life right
[43:29] Hallelujah nobody else knew what was
[43:31] going on but after she passed Hallelujah
[43:34] everybody knew Hallelujah that God gave
[43:37] her a chance to get her life right
[43:39] because her countenance was like the
[43:40] countenance of an Angel sitting in
[43:42] church Hallelujah this was a different
[43:45] death from the first death this death
[43:47] was a death of Lord I'm

[1:07:52] were raised in a Christian house when it
[1:07:54] comes to the world you are target

[1:09:57] not how to do it h so it will take a
[1:10:01] measure of God's grace to fulfill it and

[1:10:12] pass so subliminally I was
[1:10:16] listening but I couldn't tell her

[1:10:54] around sometimes you be out there all by
[1:10:56] yourself nobody but you and your
[1:11:00] thoughts and the manifestation of what's
[1:11:02] about to happen and I walk around the
[1:11:05] pastor the
[1:11:07] door around I pull the door and it came
[1:11:12] open and I was like inside I was doing
[1:11:19] this but I couldn't let nobody know I

[1:11:26] I looked to the entrance of the
[1:11:28] warehouse nobody was looking there was
[1:11:30] nobody else out there with me and I look
[1:11:32] up to the sky and I say thank you
[1:11:36] Jesus I was a secret
[1:11:42] believer but I had a desire to
[1:11:46] believe Hallelujah and that was just one
[1:11:49] time of
[1:11:51] many that Fe like that happened to me to
[1:11:54] walk me down that's why parents is very
[1:11:57] important to keep your
[1:11:58] stand I'm not talking about a stand of
[1:12:01] I'm the head and you tell me no the life
[1:12:04] you
[1:12:05] live it's very important that they see
[1:12:08] you love living the life you live
[1:12:10] Hallelujah and that's what I saw
[1:12:12] Hallelujah and and over time Hallelujah
[1:12:15] that life that I saw begin to be a
[1:12:20] craving and I start to say like Elvis I
[1:12:22] want my mom my
[1:12:25] God y know that that's what Elders he
[1:12:28] really wanted to be
[1:12:31] saved but he was so caught up in his
[1:12:33] worldly desires he couldn't get
[1:12:37] there just like a lot of other people
[1:12:39] hallelujah Whitney Houston don't you
[1:12:41] realize Hallelujah her singing and
[1:12:44] everything started where in the
[1:12:46] church God gave her an anointing for
[1:12:49] what
[1:12:50] worship tell you a story of another
[1:12:52] friend of mine Hallelujah from Germany
[1:12:55] everybody all right friend of mine from
[1:12:57] Germany he got tired of the message he's
[1:12:59] like man I'm sick of it it's a young guy
[1:13:00] he's like I'm sick of this I'm going to
[1:13:02] live my life I'm going to the world
[1:13:04] Whitney Houston was coming to Germany he
[1:13:05] said you know what I'm going to listen
[1:13:07] to the
[1:13:08] American I'm going to sing with
[1:13:11] Whitney and that's what he was thinking
[1:13:14] he said he get to the concert bought his
[1:13:16] ticket he's sitting up in there with all
[1:13:17] these worldly people he gets out he say
[1:13:19] Whitney comes out and he's like man we F
[1:13:21] we going to have a Time he comes out and
[1:13:24] she said y'all know what I was raised in
[1:13:27] church and tonight I'm only going to
[1:13:30] sing gospel
[1:13:38] songs you can run from God but he'll
[1:13:41] always find
[1:13:44] you Hallelujah and look that night
[1:13:48] Whitney Houston led him back to the
[1:13:52] Lord
[1:13:56] oh Lord and she couldn't even get her
[1:13:58] own self
[1:14:01] right but just like God say I'll use
[1:14:04] pharaoh to show my
[1:14:07] glory let me finish this so we can get
[1:14:09] out of here by God's grace listen this
[1:14:13] young man the Bible says that he uh it
[1:14:17] say not many days after the young son
[1:14:19] gathered together all and took his
[1:14:21] journey into a fair country and there he
[1:14:24] wasted his substance with riotous living
[1:14:27] what is riotous living excessive eating
[1:14:30] and
[1:14:32] drinking a life of luxury that's what he
[1:14:35] was doing like they say in the world he
[1:14:38] was balling
[1:14:40] out balling out H nobody couldn't tell
[1:14:43] him he was a big baller he was a triple
[1:14:45] OG big
[1:14:48] baller Hallelujah Bing out buying us
[1:14:51] buying that probably had on a rope
[1:14:54] ho
[1:14:59] A Hallelujah had on expensive spray and
[1:15:02] everything and nice shoes and all that
[1:15:04] he was rightous living he was just
[1:15:06] fulfilling all the things that he wanted
[1:15:08] to
[1:15:09] do even though he grew up in a Christian
[1:15:14] Home see that's why it's very important
[1:15:18] to be converted or to get converted
[1:15:21] because when you get control of over
[1:15:23] your life your desires is going to take
[1:15:28] over I'm going tell on myself before I
[1:15:31] get out of here I didn't finish college
[1:15:33] you know why I had too much
[1:15:39] power brother what do you
[1:15:41] mean I'mma tell you my turning point I
[1:15:45] was in class one day and I needed to go
[1:15:48] do something and I asked the teacher I
[1:15:51] said hey Miss s so can I go do such and
[1:15:53] such you know I get back and get to work
[1:15:55] this and that blah blah blah she says
[1:15:57] you can do whatever you want to do you
[1:15:58] paying for
[1:16:01] her me
[1:16:05] I'm I see you
[1:16:10] tomorrow I see you next
[1:16:12] week I see you next month I ain't never
[1:16:16] coming
[1:16:21] back and that's what
[1:16:30] happen I had too much power for my own
[1:16:34] good Hallelujah so in the times of your
[1:16:38] life come on musicians in the time of
[1:16:39] your life where you can be sheltered by
[1:16:42] the love of God take that
[1:16:45] shelter where you could be sheltered by
[1:16:47] the grace of God and the enemy is he
[1:16:50] can't get to you real real easy
[1:16:53] rejoice in
[1:16:55] that because if you're not converted
[1:16:57] your worldly desires will take over and
[1:17:01] they'll destroy you this young man all
[1:17:04] his righteous living and all that he say
[1:17:06] after all his we know the story after
[1:17:08] all his substance was gone he got so low
[1:17:10] remember he was he was the uh uh the man
[1:17:13] of the party he was the life of the
[1:17:14] party everybody loved him when he was
[1:17:16] issuing out that money he you know they
[1:17:18] probably wrote the song I got the
[1:17:19] Benjamin for
[1:17:21] him and you know he was buying us buying
[1:17:24] drinks and doing everything eating food
[1:17:26] you know they was eating uh shrimp and
[1:17:30] Camari they was eating everything steak
[1:17:32] and lamb they was eating it all and he
[1:17:35] was paying for
[1:17:36] everything probably eating sushi Fresh
[1:17:39] Off The
[1:17:40] Grill I know some of y'all thinking you
