[0:04] second Samuel chapter 6.
[0:16] verse 14 II Samuel 6 verse 14.
[0:20] I'd like to preach part five on praise
[0:23] Jesus's name
[0:25] in the dance second Samuel chapter 6.
[0:29] 6 14.
[0:46] second Samuel 6 verse 14 praise God
[0:58] let's just read verse 14 together
[1:01] and then I'm going to read 15 16 and 17
[1:03] but let's read 14 with one voice let's
[1:06] begin on three one two three and David
[1:08] danced before the Lord with all his
[1:12] might and David was girded with a linen
[1:15] ephod remember the linen ephod was a
[1:18] priest garment it was that outward
[1:20] garment that actually had the urum and
[1:21] thumb on it I showed a picture of it not
[1:24] long ago
[1:25] so here's David as a priest and we know
[1:28] he was already King
[1:30] right and we know he also was a prophet
[1:32] so this is David becoming Prophet priest
[1:35] and King
[1:37] over the Ark of the Covenant and over
[1:39] the Tabernacle of the lord we would say
[1:42] in fact this has been a time where it's
[1:43] been called The Tabernacle of David
[1:46] before it was a tabernacle of Moses and
[1:48] here becomes the Tabernacle of David
[1:50] praise God
[1:53] verse 15. so David and all the house of
[1:55] Israel brought up the Ark of Lord with
[1:57] shouting and with the sound of the
[1:59] trumpet
[2:00] and as the Ark of the Lord came into the
[2:02] city of David McCall Saul's daughter
[2:05] looked through a window and saw David
[2:08] leaping and dancing before the Lord and
[2:11] she despised him
[2:13] in her heart now notice it doesn't call
[2:15] him a call David's wife in this location
[2:16] in this scripture
[2:19] see how it's differentiating her she's
[2:21] not being spiritual this moment she's
[2:23] being carnal so it doesn't say McCall
[2:26] David's wife it says McCall Saul's
[2:28] daughter
[2:32] verse 17 and they brought in the ark of
[2:35] the Lord and set
[2:37] it in his place notice his place so the
[2:40] ark is given a male designation
[2:43] set in his place
[2:48] in the midst of the Tabernacle that
[2:50] David had pitched for it
[2:52] and David offered burnt offerings and
[2:55] peace offerings before the Lord
[2:58] amen may God add His blessings to the
[3:00] Ring of his word you may be seated by
[3:02] God's grace
[3:07] I have a few uh slides to show here by
[3:09] God's grace
[3:15] so I'd like to look at part five I'm
[3:17] using that former picture that I used
[3:18] with
[3:20] uh the the Mount Zion series
[3:23] and we looked at Mount Zion a couple
[3:25] years ago if I'm not mistaken
[3:28] I'd like to continue on this thought of
[3:30] Praise Jesus name and the dance
[3:34] now just so you know our brother this
[3:36] might be new to brother Austin certainly
[3:38] probably sister Nina and brother Chris
[3:39] but
[3:41] um
[3:42] in Jerusalem the very center
[3:44] of Jerusalem or the very focus of God's
[3:47] capital of Jerusalem our two main
[3:49] mountains well three main mountains here
[3:51] you have Mount olives
[3:52] that's where Jesus prayed you know he
[3:55] prayed on the Mount of Olives before he
[3:57] his crucifixion
[3:59] and uh Mount Moriah of course this is
[4:02] where the current Muslim Shrine is
[4:06] but this is where the House of David
[4:09] would have been
[4:11] the House of David would have been here
[4:12] and then the Tabernacle of David would
[4:14] have been here Mount Zion is the the
[4:16] actually the city it's The Old City
[4:19] which is right next to Mount Moriah but
[4:22] in general yeah just my brother in
[4:24] general this whole this whole location
[4:26] here is is called Mount Zion in general
[4:28] yeah brother Chris do you have a
[4:29] question
[4:32] yeah so I preached on that were you here
[4:35] when I preached on that when I uh
[4:37] when I showed it let me see if I can
[4:39] find it real quick so the Tabernacle
[4:41] Moses set up a tabernacle
[4:43] and then uh David brought the Tabernacle
[4:47] here to Jerusalem
[4:50] I know I preached out it recently let me
[4:51] see if I got the picture here
[4:55] I thought you were here when I taught it
[4:57] but it had been a few been a little bit
[4:59] here
[5:00] let me see if I can find it real quick
[5:05] Tabernacle
[5:16] yes this was the tabernacle but let me
[5:18] see if I can
[5:21] so this was the tabernacle uh that Moses
[5:24] set up and of course remember two
[5:25] million people surround all there's two
[5:27] million Israelites and they all came out
[5:28] of Egypt
[5:30] and God actually called them out to
[5:32] start a church because the church means
[5:34] they called out people
[5:36] and so once they got out of Egypt in the
[5:38] wilderness then God had Moses
[5:40] established the Tabernacle this is a
[5:43] place of God's dwelling
[5:45] so yeah is that first time for me okay
[5:47] and so there's three courts remember you
[5:48] had the outer Court here where they
[5:50] sacrificed the animals that represent
[5:51] Jesus's death on the cross then you had
[5:53] the holy place
[5:55] so this is this is justification you're
[5:57] forgiven sanctification you get ready to
[6:00] go into the last place is the prince of
[6:02] gods that's where the presence of God
[6:03] would fall
[6:05] okay so does that sound familiar good
[6:07] brother
[6:09] praise God and so David took uh parts of
[6:12] this that's we're going to get to
[6:13] tonight he didn't take all of this but
[6:15] David took parts of this to Jerusalem so
[6:18] this is out in the wilderness but the
[6:20] Tabernacle was was in in transition it
[6:22] was transitioning from the Wilderness to
[6:25] Jerusalem
[6:27] and uh and then you know of course then
[6:30] you know after David then you had the
[6:31] Temple of Solomon I'd like to preach on
[6:33] that again this year or not again but
[6:35] preach it for the first time this year
[6:37] so uh now here let me yeah since I'm
[6:40] here it's actually probably pretty good
[6:41] it's time to show this okay
[6:44] so when David set it up you know
[6:47] this this would be Mount Moriah of
[6:49] course and then this is the lower parts
[6:50] of that this is coming down that hill
[6:52] this would have been Mount Zion over
[6:55] here
[6:56] and so remember remember this when David
[6:58] took the city you know Joshua never took
[7:00] Jerusalem because it was a stronghold
[7:03] but it was David who finally took Mount
[7:06] Zion and they got there through the
[7:08] secret place the the secret passage
[7:11] praise God and Hallelujah that's a
[7:12] beautiful type of the secret works you
[7:14] know secret prey secret fasting uh
[7:17] Secret almsgiving
[7:20] so you you you you possess this location
[7:22] through the secret place Hallelujah
[7:25] dwelling in the secret place with Christ
[7:26] oh it's a beautiful time I preached a
[7:28] couple years ago not real fresh on it
[7:30] tonight but
[7:31] um anyways now this is Solomon's Temple
[7:34] brother but when David was here they
[7:35] didn't have the this they didn't have
[7:36] like this huge bill or this massive
[7:38] building they had just the tents like I
[7:40] showed you on the other picture
[7:41] okay so this is the times of Solomon
[7:44] where they actually had the temple built
[7:46] so
[7:49] um
[7:49] so I'm not I'll preach on that later but
[7:52] I'll actually I'm going to Lord willing
[7:54] close tonight's service with that
[7:55] thought
[7:56] so
[7:58] that's kind of where we're going bro so
[8:00] does that help by God's grace all right
[8:01] yeah thank you brother no those are
[8:03] great questions and you know I guess I
[8:04] got some other pictures look at it as
[8:06] well
[8:07] yeah here's another shot at it uh for
[8:09] Solomon's day you know this is from the
[8:11] south looking North
[8:12] okay so this is the Mount of Olives this
[8:15] is Mount Moriah and then this is Mount
[8:18] Zion
[8:19] but the whole thing altogether was
[8:20] called Mount Zion just because it's the
[8:22] general term it means the elevated place
[8:24] the high place Hallelujah
[8:27] all right so that's Solomon's Temple and
[8:29] this is called the city of David of
[8:31] course we're the king king would live
[8:32] and uh the people here
[8:35] okay
[8:38] so let me get back to where I was going
[8:40] here all right so yeah we started here
[8:42] uh with praise His name in the dancing
[8:45] I kind of want to build up eventually
[8:46] look a little bit closer at David's uh
[8:50] bringing the ark into the city of David
[8:53] praise God Jerusalem
[8:55] okay so David brought it here so this is
[8:58] where David would have brought the ark
[8:59] he would have brought it here because
[9:01] this would have been where the the
[9:02] Tabernacle of Moses which now would have
[9:04] been the Tabernacle of David would have
[9:06] been established all right praise God
[9:08] okay so we read our text now before
[9:11] getting into that I just want to go over
[9:13] this uh this thought because this is
[9:16] you know David bringing the ark is a
[9:18] type of the church having Revival
[9:21] okay uh there's also there's a numerous
[9:24] typesuit as well I I typed it also to
[9:26] the rapture
[9:28] I don't know if you remember that but
[9:29] we're supposed to have a Mount Zion
[9:31] Showdown
[9:32] how many remember that from spoken words
[9:33] Original Seed brother man preached on
[9:35] that
[9:36] um and so I just want to read this first
[9:38] I I plan to preach this in part two of
[9:41] this series but I never got to it so
[9:45] you know David's ark or David David
[9:47] bringing the ark to uh the position is a
[9:50] type of Revival okay so it's like when
[9:54] we would leave our first love and then
[9:56] God would bring us back to our first
[9:58] love
[9:59] so our first love is when we're first
[10:01] Saved or we're first filled with the
[10:02] Holy Ghost we're total obedience to God
[10:04] In Love With God meditating on God all
[10:07] the time but then we leave that
[10:10] because we go through trials and
[10:11] temptations
[10:13] right and we're not drawn away by uh God
[10:15] we're drawn away by our own lust the
[10:17] Bible says
[10:18] we get enticed and then lust lust gets
[10:21] less conceives and then we sin and then
[10:24] the end of sin is death but before that
[10:26] death stage praise God God brings us
[10:28] repentance hallelujah amen God doesn't
[10:30] let us die amen because we've already
[10:32] passed from Death unto life amen thank
[10:35] God so see out of those four steps a
[10:38] real Christian only gets to the third
[10:39] step they never get to the fourth
[10:40] because God brings them back amen he
[10:43] brings them back to their first love
[10:44] amen hallelujah thank God Amen what a
[10:47] blessing now brother Adam I got a little
[10:49] bit of reading to do so bear with me
[10:50] brother Ram you know is preaching on
[10:52] Revelation 2 verse 4. nevertheless I
[10:54] have somewhat against thee because thou
[10:56] has left thy First Love and church we
[10:58] all do it so this is a sermon for
[10:59] everybody this applies to everybody
[11:00] everybody should be able to say Amen at
[11:02] some point
[11:03] right because we all fall short of God's
[11:05] glory
[11:06] to understand this leaving the first
[11:08] love you must realize that spirit is not
[11:10] speaking to the original Saints of
[11:12] Ephesus alone
[11:13] this message is into the entire age
[11:15] which lasted about 120 years and just a
[11:18] side note this year 2023 is a hundred
[11:22] and uh it's the same length as the
[11:24] Ephesian Church age
[11:26] just so you know there's some people
[11:28] that have said oh the laosian church a
[11:29] is going to be the shortest age well
[11:31] guess what they're wrong
[11:33] they're wrong because now it's the same
[11:35] and there's never there's never a
[11:37] scripture for that to begin with so see
[11:38] it was all human presumption
[11:41] and how to look now they look like fools
[11:44] that's why I'm a real man of God won't
[11:45] go that far
[11:47] now if he does he'll say this is my own
[11:48] opinion he won't make it an absolute
[11:50] thing right
[11:54] now pick him back up its message then is
[11:56] to all the generations in that span Now
[11:59] history keeps repeating itself in the
[12:02] generations of Israel we see Revival one
[12:04] generation only to see the fires fading
[12:07] in the next
[12:09] right now Church really I'm like a third
[12:11] generation from Brother Branham
[12:14] right because brother random uh would be
[12:17] like a hundred and something by now he'd
[12:19] be like
[12:20] let's see 100 uh 122. he'd be I think
[12:23] 122. I'm not mistaken no 100 uh 12.
[12:27] brother Brown would be 112.
[12:29] right now so his son is about 65 or
[12:32] something like that Joseph
[12:34] so that's like the age of my dad my
[12:36] dad's 72. so
[12:39] so just think about that now brother his
[12:42] his generation had a genuine Holy Ghost
[12:43] Revival and the church said
[12:45] remember I showed you at least six six
[12:47] kinds of revivals remember I showed you
[12:48] that I might preach at brother cams that
[12:50] might be a help to them
[12:51] right and so
[12:54] the next generation is responsible to
[12:57] have the same Holy Ghost Revival
[12:59] if they don't
[13:01] then they've failed the grace of God
[13:04] right
[13:05] but see here now you know each
[13:07] generation has to have Revival so I
[13:10] would be in the the we say that maybe
[13:12] the second generation after brother
[13:13] Branham right and then my children guess
[13:16] what you're the third generation
[13:18] right see that
[13:21] so
[13:22] we see uh one generation having Revival
[13:25] but the fires fade in the next
[13:29] in the third generation Embers may be
[13:32] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[13:33] may be no Vestige whatsoever of that
[13:36] original Flame
[13:40] now look
[13:41] I'm the third generation so I don't want
[13:43] to be just a slightly glowing Ember I
[13:46] want to be a fire that everybody can see
[13:49] I want to have a burning fire experience
[13:52] where the fire of God is burning in my
[13:54] life praise God now say like this it
[13:56] burns up sin praise God
[13:58] amen hallelujah
[14:02] and church I believe that I believe I am
[14:04] a burning fire because I can listen to
[14:06] brother random sermons and I can hear
[14:08] how they go
[14:09] and you have different kinds of sermons
[14:10] some are Revival servants some are just
[14:12] teaching sermons right
[14:14] sudden there's loud shouts other there's
[14:16] not
[14:17] and so there's a variety right and
[14:19] that's what we have today we have a
[14:21] variety of some Services people Shout
[14:23] Scream dance praise the Lord other ones
[14:25] are just more hot a quiet more humble
[14:27] repentance type of sermons seeking God
[14:29] type of sermons so I believe I'm not
[14:32] just a small Ember I believe I've got a
[14:34] real fire praise God
[14:36] I believe I've been faithful in my
[14:39] generation to the baptism of the Holy
[14:41] Ghost praise God
[14:43] right I know for sure compared to my mom
[14:45] in the denominational generation my
[14:48] wife's uh family you know their
[14:50] denominational experience we know we can
[14:52] tell our lives are on fire for Jesus
[14:54] praise God
[14:55] amen right we can see the fires burning
[14:57] in our generation
[14:59] but sometime it's going to be Lydia
[15:02] Malachi's generation
[15:04] they've got to have the same fire praise
[15:06] God
[15:07] same devotion remember Jesus said you
[15:09] never decrease your works you increase
[15:11] your works praise God
[15:13] the last works are greater than the
[15:15] first Works amen
[15:17] oh Hallelujah
[15:23] so he goes to the fourth generation
[15:25] isn't that interesting because now we're
[15:26] kind of the fourth generation Malachi
[15:28] and Lydia your generation is the fourth
[15:29] generation
[15:32] then God lights the fire again and the
[15:34] same process is repeated it's simply the
[15:36] manifestation of the truth that God has
[15:38] no grandchildren
[15:40] salvation is not passed on by natural
[15:42] birth any more than is there any truth
[15:45] to Apostolic succession
[15:48] Hallelujah
[15:49] so each person has to have their own
[15:51] experience with God each person has to
[15:54] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:56] has to go in that third court with the
[15:59] temp with the Tabernacle right outer
[16:00] core inner core holiest of holies each
[16:03] person must go in the presence of God
[16:05] and experience the fire of God the voice
[16:07] of God they must have an experience with
[16:09] Christ themselves
[16:12] it isn't in the word you start out with
[16:15] Born Again Believers and when the next
[16:18] Generation comes along they're no longer
[16:20] just plain Christians
[16:22] but now they've taken a denominational
[16:24] name and are now Baptist methodists Etc
[16:26] I'm gonna stop right there a lot of tape
[16:28] churches are are denominations
[16:32] like they were contacting me this week
[16:33] some of the guys and not the pastor but
[16:35] and they were saying they were saying
[16:37] Christ Our Joseph that's what they say
[16:39] Christ Our Joseph the great prophet is
[16:40] here that's what they call them
[16:42] because they believe he's filled with
[16:43] the Holy Ghost and Brother Joseph is a
[16:45] major prophet that's what they say
[16:46] friends that is an absolute denomination
[16:49] because they say there's no mistakes on
[16:51] the tapes and I said I got a video with
[16:52] 70 mistakes on the tapes
[16:55] I said the only way you say there's no
[16:57] mistakes on the tapes is if you're
[16:58] insane and you have the spirit of
[17:00] idolatry and you have the Antichrist
[17:02] Spirit on you
[17:04] and it all goes back to what is the
[17:05] message the message is not a bunch of
[17:07] tapes the message is the scriptures God
[17:10] has fulfilled and is fulfilling right
[17:12] now praise God because Revelation 10 7
[17:15] is already fulfilled but we're not
[17:17] Revelation 10 7. we're Revelation 10 8 9
[17:20] 10 and 11 praise God that's what's God
[17:23] doing right now we're eating the book
[17:25] church at least we ought to be eating
[17:27] the book praise God I'm eating the book
[17:29] I'm eating the Bible praise God I'm
[17:31] feasting on the revelations in the Bible
[17:33] Hallelujah
[17:35] see that's what we're doing so
[17:36] Revelation 10 7 is fulfilled but we're
[17:39] moving on and that's the message the
[17:41] message is the scriptures God is doing
[17:43] right now but the tape church I believe
[17:45] is an absolute denomination
[17:53] and they have a denominational name they
[17:54] call themselves Tate churches that's
[17:56] exactly what they are too they're not
[17:57] Christians now I believe some of them
[17:59] are Christians but I don't know how many
[18:01] only God knows
[18:02] because to say brother Branham is
[18:04] infallible that's idolatry
[18:06] and to not correct that proves you do
[18:08] not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:11] right
[18:13] see church we have to be born out of the
[18:15] will of God not the will of man to be
[18:17] saved but these folks are all coming
[18:19] together now by the will of man
[18:21] I don't say that some of them aren't
[18:23] right with God not for a minute do I say
[18:25] that but the original fire has died down
[18:27] they are not the same anymore now church
[18:30] we can take a lesson from that and we've
[18:32] got to look at our lives and that's why
[18:33] I like listening to sermons from last
[18:34] year or years ago are you are you are
[18:37] you and I the same or not
[18:39] am I the same preacher or not Hallelujah
[18:43] and see we either go we either get
[18:45] closer to God we either grow closer to
[18:47] God or we backslide
[18:49] Hallelujah I believe I'm closer to God
[18:51] now than I was back then praise God
[18:54] but each one of us have to look at that
[18:56] are we on fire now at less or more than
[19:00] last year
[19:02] right I don't mean that just because we
[19:03] pass into the new year I'm not talking
[19:04] like last week I'm talking about just
[19:06] you know last year
[19:07] like last January 2022
[19:11] so you have to make sure we don't leave
[19:12] our first love and we got to say devoted
[19:15] to Christ and keep the fire burning
[19:16] Saints amen
[19:18] Hallelujah
[19:19] kind of hot in here can you go turn down
[19:21] the heat Malachi
[19:22] just turn it down to 62.
[19:25] because with all the bodies in here it
[19:26] warms up around
[19:28] it's a little uncomfortable to me
[19:30] now look here it is there's three things
[19:31] now I usually put this on a list but I
[19:33] didn't have time today
[19:34] the fervent desire to please God here's
[19:36] how you know you're at your first love
[19:37] you have a fervent desire to please God
[19:40] you have a passion to know his word that
[19:42] means read your Bible pray listen to
[19:44] sermons
[19:45] you want to know more about the word
[19:49] and you have the cry for reaching out in
[19:51] the spirit you want the spirit to move
[19:53] amen
[19:54] you want more of the spirit in your life
[19:56] praise God oh God dude pour out great
[19:58] blessings Amen in other words you're
[19:59] pleading with Heaven praise God
[20:02] so those three things will prove that
[20:04] you are still on fire you you've got
[20:06] your first love praise God I'm talking
[20:08] about in your mind now not your soul and
[20:10] your mind right because if you're born
[20:12] again that that seal your soul is sealed
[20:14] to the day of redemption
[20:17] see now church we can't let our fire for
[20:20] God fade and instead of that church
[20:23] being on fire with the fire of God is
[20:24] cooled off and become a bit formal
[20:26] that's why it's good to dance around the
[20:27] church
[20:29] right so it's not so formal like every
[20:32] service is the same we stand up we sing
[20:34] three songs we sit down we listen to a
[20:36] sermon we all stand up and pray we leave
[20:38] it shouldn't be formed not every service
[20:40] is the same
[20:41] like sometimes I call you up to pray I
[20:43] might do that tonight you never know I
[20:44] don't know we'll kind of see how you
[20:46] feel that how we feel led by the Holy
[20:47] Spirit
[20:50] we might dance tonight we might not it's
[20:53] the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise
[20:55] God now there's nothing wrong with
[20:56] setting out a dance service nothing
[20:58] wrong with that there's nothing out with
[20:59] nothing wrong with setting aside a
[21:01] prayer service or a Divine Healing
[21:03] service there's nothing wrong with that
[21:05] but the reality of it is we can't have a
[21:07] formal attitude we got to get past well
[21:09] we're just coming to church it's more
[21:10] than that we're coming in the presence
[21:12] of God Amen
[21:13] we're reaching out in the spirit for God
[21:15] do more tonight praise God
[21:18] see it's like it's a it's a fervent
[21:20] desire it's a seeking of God yeah so
[21:22] it's it's that's what it is this is the
[21:25] first love I'm passionate about God's
[21:27] word amen I really want to please God
[21:30] and I want the spirit to move tonight
[21:32] praise God
[21:33] Hallelujah
[21:35] church I believe a lot of you have done
[21:37] a great job of that praise God I believe
[21:39] a lot of you have done a great job of
[21:40] that because we've had such wonderful
[21:40] meetings here these last few months I
[21:43] mean all year but you know it goes up
[21:45] and down right right we go through
[21:46] battles I go through battles you go
[21:48] through battle we all go through battles
[21:49] but consistently we're you know we
[21:52] always come back praise God
[21:54] amen
[21:57] he said this that is what was happening
[21:59] back there to the Ephesians they were
[22:00] getting a bit formal the abandonment to
[22:03] God was dying out and the people weren't
[22:04] too careful about what God thought of
[22:06] them as they began to be careful about
[22:08] what the world thought of them
[22:11] member Church never really care about
[22:13] what the world thinks about you so much
[22:15] care about what God thinks about you
[22:18] and the way to know is talk to God right
[22:21] spend time with God
[22:22] you should feel you see you should have
[22:24] a passion for the word that's how you
[22:26] know you feel good good toward God God I
[22:28] want more of your word give me more of
[22:30] your Revelation give me more of your
[22:32] understanding I want more of you not
[22:33] like I'm going to hide from you that's
[22:34] like Adam and Eve when they sin right
[22:36] hiding from God
[22:38] I don't want to get in the presence of
[22:39] God I don't want to spend time with God
[22:40] that's when we know we left our first
[22:42] love and instead of running from God we
[22:44] should run to God that's how you get
[22:46] your first love back amen
[22:52] that second generation coming on was
[22:54] just like Israel they demanded a king to
[22:56] be like the other nations see we don't
[22:58] want to be like other message churches
[22:59] we want to be like the book of Acts amen
[23:02] so that's how you know we're on fire
[23:03] we're not looking to other churches to
[23:06] be our pattern we want to be like the
[23:07] book of Acts and we're making steps to
[23:09] be like the book of Acts
[23:12] amen
[23:16] Hallelujah when they did that they
[23:17] rejected God but they did it anyway
[23:19] that's the history of the church when it
[23:21] thinks more of conforming to the world
[23:22] instead of conforming to God it isn't
[23:24] long until you see them stop doing the
[23:26] things they used to do and start doing
[23:28] the things they wouldn't do initially
[23:30] they changed their manner of dress their
[23:32] attitudes and their behavior now we've
[23:35] seen people coming here they didn't
[23:36] change their dress when they fell away
[23:38] they just changed their behavior
[23:40] right they still dress holy
[23:42] they didn't wear tank tops they didn't
[23:45] wear short shorts or short skirts the
[23:46] men didn't wear short shorts
[23:48] they still wear pants but they change
[23:50] their behavior and their attitude toward
[23:52] the word of God
[23:54] see they get lacks they get lazy see
[23:56] they don't want to pray or they don't
[23:58] want to please God fervently they don't
[24:00] have a passion for his word they're lazy
[24:02] towards the word
[24:04] and they don't reach out in the spirit
[24:05] they say well if the spirit moves
[24:07] tonight that's okay if it doesn't that's
[24:08] fine either way
[24:10] our attitude should be we we really want
[24:13] to see the spirit move praise God
[24:15] and I'm gonna do everything in my power
[24:16] to help the spirit moving
[24:18] in other words make myself a sacrifice
[24:21] Hallelujah sacrifice my ideas sacrifice
[24:24] my body and give give God every fiber of
[24:27] my being Hallelujah
[24:31] that's what Ephesians means it means
[24:33] relax and drifting
[24:36] the cycle of Revival and death has never
[24:39] let's say never never see that's why
[24:41] this is going to be a constant part of
[24:43] our Lives if you don't know it already
[24:45] there's going to be season you feel like
[24:47] you're dying so you've got you got to
[24:48] say God sit and send me Revival
[24:50] give me a Revival it's it's just Cycles
[24:53] we're going to go through it I feel like
[24:54] I go through on a weekly weekly basis
[24:57] up and down up and down like I said it
[24:59] gets more challenging because I'm
[25:00] getting a little older you know all you
[25:02] have to do is recall the last move of
[25:03] God in the spirit when men and women
[25:05] dress like Christians went to church
[25:06] prayed all night took the street corners
[25:09] and weren't ashamed of the
[25:10] manifestations of the spirit they left
[25:12] their old dead churches in Worship in
[25:13] the homes or old store buildings they
[25:16] had reality but it wasn't too long a
[25:19] time until they began to get enough
[25:20] money to build find new churches they
[25:23] put in a choir listen instead of singing
[25:25] to God for themselves
[25:27] in other words you sing for me I want to
[25:29] sit back and listen no God wants you to
[25:31] sing
[25:32] all of you are in the choir
[25:36] Hallelujah that's right I'm in the choir
[25:38] we're all part of the bride of Christ
[25:40] Fellowship choir amen
[25:43] they organize the movement and ran it by
[25:44] man they soon began to read books that
[25:46] weren't fit to read now for us it might
[25:48] not be books it might be websites right
[25:51] or apps
[25:53] see they do things they they should not
[25:55] have done they let down the bar so see
[25:58] you had bars set up I'm not going to
[25:59] leave this I'm going to stay in this
[26:01] place with God but then they let down
[26:03] the bars and let things come in
[26:06] and the goats came in and took over the
[26:08] Cry Of Joy was gone
[26:12] Hallelujah see what does Joy relate to
[26:14] Joy relates to dancing right
[26:16] rejoicing dancers are rejoicing thing
[26:20] the freedom of the spirit was gone oh
[26:23] they kept on with a form but the fire
[26:25] died down and the Blackness of Ashes is
[26:28] about all that's left
[26:31] so see we want to fire and church we
[26:33] realize that you know we got to come
[26:34] here and we've actually got to get in
[26:36] the spirit it takes a while to build up
[26:38] a fire
[26:40] right it takes a while you got to build
[26:41] it up especially if the wind's blowing
[26:43] you got to have a lot of dead things you
[26:45] got to have dry things it takes a while
[26:47] and so we come to church and we've got
[26:48] to just stay in the atmosphere we got to
[26:50] keep adding the logs on there and pretty
[26:52] soon if we're just in that atmospheric
[26:53] church we'll have a nice burden fire
[26:55] here praise God that's my brother Adam
[26:57] that's what he would do he would preach
[26:59] until there was a climax and that's when
[27:01] they pray for the sick
[27:02] when the fire is at its hardest amen
[27:05] when the fire's at its hottest that's
[27:06] when you bring the prayer requests up
[27:08] amen
[27:09] Hallelujah
[27:11] that's what I want to do I want to
[27:12] preach until it's like a fire and then
[27:14] let's call the sick up then praise God
[27:16] Hallelujah
[27:19] that's what I need to grow in as well
[27:22] but see that's what we're doing we're
[27:23] gonna we gotta you know press out of our
[27:25] minds you know out of the cares of the
[27:26] world we got to come in the presence of
[27:28] God we got to build up that fire we got
[27:30] to have a passion to know his word amen
[27:32] uh fervent desire to please him
[27:34] Hallelujah and cry out for the Holy
[27:36] Spirit to move amongst us praise God
[27:39] amen
[27:41] Hallelujah
[27:43] and then Brother Band said a few moments
[27:45] ago did I skip one okay no a few moments
[27:47] ago I mentioned that John understood
[27:48] what it was to love God that great
[27:50] Apostle of Love would certainly see it
[27:52] when the church began to lose their
[27:53] their love first John 5 3 says for this
[27:56] is the love of God that we keep his
[27:58] Commandments
[28:00] okay see so the passion to know his word
[28:02] uh that's that's wanting to hear more of
[28:05] the word but the fervent desire to
[28:07] please him that's the obedience he's
[28:09] talking about here that first part of
[28:11] those three aspects of being on fire I'm
[28:13] going to obey the word of God I'm going
[28:15] to do everything in my power to obey the
[28:17] word of God now you're getting on fire
[28:18] praise God now you're getting back to
[28:21] your first love I'm not gonna pull down
[28:23] the bars so I can let this sin in I'm
[28:25] going to fight that sin off I'm going to
[28:27] put the bars up I'm going to ask God to
[28:29] be a wall to protect me from that I'm
[28:30] going to stay behind God's fortification
[28:32] amen
[28:34] see now you know you're on fire praise
[28:36] the Lord hallelujah
[28:40] I think that's the last one yeah one
[28:42] little deviation from that word listen
[28:44] was a step away from Christ
[28:48] see so one little thing like uh just
[28:51] press play
[28:53] one little deviation have brother
[28:55] Branham preach instead of a living
[28:56] preacher one deviation is a step away
[28:59] from Christ
[29:00] right
[29:02] or one deviation there's no dancing in
[29:04] the church
[29:05] or there's there's no speaking in
[29:07] tongues in the church
[29:09] right
[29:10] there's no uh there's no Liberty there's
[29:12] no clapping in the church you know
[29:14] whatever whatever man-made Creed they
[29:17] put forth it stifles the Holy Spirit
[29:20] because the Holy Spirit wants to move
[29:23] God wants to be worshiped amen
[29:26] God
[29:27] came here to worship God Amen
[29:30] we came here to glorify God we came here
[29:32] to stay on fire Hallelujah
[29:34] this is the house of the Lord amen this
[29:37] is the glory of the Lord this is the
[29:39] presence of God God is here amen God's
[29:42] here to bless you God's here to
[29:43] strengthen you God's here to answer
[29:44] prayers amen
[29:47] how many times has God answer a prayer
[29:49] here
[29:49] many times
[29:51] right sometimes right after service
[29:53] brother right out there we go and pray
[29:55] in there somebody's right up here God
[29:57] answers right here amen
[30:01] it's God's spirit see that's why I'm so
[30:03] blessed by our church now can we groan
[30:05] it yes but I'm thankful I know we're on
[30:08] fire praise God hallelujah
[30:11] that's right
[30:12] I'm not a second generation message
[30:14] believer I'm not a third generation now
[30:17] naturally I am but I'm a first
[30:19] generation child of God
[30:21] I'm a first generation Church of the
[30:23] firstborn amen amen not second born I'm
[30:27] Church of the firstborn amen I believe
[30:29] the same gospel of Paul preach amen I've
[30:32] had the same experience Paul had amen I
[30:34] met Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost amen
[30:37] I didn't see a vision like like the
[30:40] pillar of fire I felt like I saw a
[30:41] vision when I got the Holy Ghost though
[30:42] a vision of the Cross what else could
[30:44] have been Hallelujah but I preached the
[30:47] same word we live the same truth we're
[30:49] growing in Grace and knowledge of the
[30:51] Lord we're looking at the glory of God
[30:52] the Bible said and we're being changed
[30:54] in that Glory from glory to glory amen
[30:58] like that sign I have at my house we
[31:00] don't change the message the message
[31:02] changes us praise God
[31:05] right wasn't last month the first
[31:06] Services we've had where we have dance
[31:08] and services
[31:10] are we changing less like the word or
[31:12] more like the word more like the word
[31:15] amen see after what after 16 years
[31:19] of service see we're becoming more free
[31:21] we're becoming more like the word of God
[31:24] more like the book of Acts more like
[31:26] real worshipers see we're growing into
[31:28] it all the time we're not falling away
[31:30] we're actually pressing in the violent
[31:32] take the kingdom of God by force amen
[31:35] Hallelujah
[31:37] oh it's beautiful
[31:39] teachers we can see ourselves grow in
[31:42] the grace and knowledge of the Lord
[31:45] let's see one little deviation steps
[31:46] away from Christ
[31:49] people say they love God they go to
[31:51] church they even shout and I hear they
[31:52] even shout and rejoice and sing and have
[31:54] a great emotional time when it's all
[31:56] over watch and see if they're in that
[31:58] word walking in it living in it
[32:03] see now this is what a lot of
[32:04] Pentecostals have
[32:05] now a few message churches have that
[32:07] right
[32:08] where they actually have free worship
[32:09] but are they living the word when they
[32:11] go home
[32:13] so see we want both how many want great
[32:15] emotional times of shouting and
[32:16] rejoicing I do I don't want to come to
[32:19] church to be a a depression party
[32:22] I don't want to pass my depression on to
[32:24] you I want to pass my joy on to you amen
[32:28] I'm going to pass my strength unto you
[32:30] praise God just like a body I want to
[32:32] pass the oxygen I want to pass the
[32:34] life-giving resource amen I want life to
[32:36] flow from me to you amen or vice versa
[32:40] Hallelujah right where we strengthen
[32:42] each other where life flows through the
[32:44] body we keep each other alive we keep
[32:46] strengthening each other praise God we
[32:48] pray for one another we intercede for
[32:50] one another Hallelujah we provoke one
[32:51] another unto good works amen
[32:55] Gloria
[33:00] I love this he says they say they love
[33:02] God but their lives tell another story
[33:06] May our lives at home tell the same
[33:08] story that we tell the church
[33:10] Hallelujah
[33:12] Glory
[33:13] that's right
[33:14] he said I wonder if John didn't see a
[33:16] lot of that before he died people saying
[33:18] they love God but not obeying his word
[33:22] oh Ephesian Church something is
[33:23] happening to you someone is trying to
[33:25] either add to the word or take from it
[33:28] but they're doing it so subtly that you
[33:31] can't see it
[33:32] they haven't made a move so big you can
[33:34] see it out there in the open it's
[33:36] undercover and they're bringing it by
[33:38] way of reason and human understanding
[33:40] and it will take over unless you refuse
[33:42] it go back to Pentecost before it's too
[33:45] late amen hallelujah
[33:47] let's all say praise the Lord can we
[33:49] praise the Lord amen see Church
[33:52] it's like that diesel nickel Aid and
[33:54] some whatever the sin is it always
[33:55] starts as a saying well this is what we
[33:58] do or this is what we say
[34:00] and if it's a false saying that's what
[34:01] it is it's a decent nicolatum then it
[34:03] becomes uh something the preacher
[34:04] preaches all the time
[34:07] right and then it becomes the unbending
[34:08] way
[34:10] right and the Bible said Jesus hates the
[34:12] Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[34:15] but brother Brown says Jesus hates
[34:16] powerless religion
[34:18] so what do we need we need a religion
[34:20] that's got power in it
[34:22] power to clean our lives amen power to
[34:25] make us Shout
[34:27] power to make us dance amen power to
[34:30] heal the sick Hallelujah
[34:32] power to give us dreams and visions and
[34:35] prophecies amen power to tell the future
[34:38] praise God
[34:39] amen power to discern power to to to
[34:43] give words of knowledge words of wisdom
[34:45] power do Miracles see religion God loves
[34:48] a religion with power in it praise God
[34:51] amen
[34:52] that's what I love writing out
[34:53] testimonies and I go back and see you
[34:55] you know sometimes the enemy fights me
[34:56] in they say he says you do too much
[34:58] teaching that's what I like to make a
[34:59] list of all the times the power of God
[35:01] has moved
[35:02] I'm making a pretty good list right now
[35:03] I started this week at home I'm making a
[35:06] pretty good list of all the testimonies
[35:08] where I know God moved there I know the
[35:10] power of God moved on that person
[35:13] I know God see because uh I just want to
[35:16] remember the Bible says sir up your
[35:17] minds by way of remembrance
[35:20] not not not to dwell on those but just
[35:23] as an encouragement God is with me
[35:26] God is with you amen
[35:29] and so God wants power in our religion
[35:32] Hallelujah
[35:34] thank you Lord like the last time was
[35:36] when I was dancing with the headache and
[35:38] I told you I had a headache my headache
[35:39] was throbbing I think it was part two my
[35:41] head was throbbing with this headache
[35:42] and I said I'll just praise God no
[35:44] matter I'll Just Dance even if I got a
[35:45] headache by then a service the headache
[35:47] was gone
[35:48] now that doesn't rarely happen right
[35:50] usually I got to go to bed with a
[35:51] headache or something like that hey
[35:53] right really I don't get well yeah
[35:54] sometimes I'll have headaches for weeks
[35:56] on end because I'm not sleeping enough
[35:57] that's my thought but there I got a
[35:59] headache during service and I preach the

[36:09] for me so it shows God it has power in
[36:13] this Holy Ghost religion praise God
[36:16] amen
[36:18] Glory so yes I preached many sermons
[36:20] with headaches and God then has answered
[36:23] numerous uh numerous requests even
[36:25] though I have a headache
[36:27] right but see God keeps showing us more
[36:30] and more there's power in this word
[36:32] there's power in this word just stay
[36:34] dedicated God's teaching us lessons
[36:36] Hallelujah everything has a time and
[36:38] season praise God God makes everything
[36:39] beautiful in his time praise God the
[36:42] best things are yet to come praise God
[36:44] amen
[36:46] Hallelujah
[36:47] because the Rapture is yet to come
[36:49] Hallelujah the body changes yet to come
[36:51] thank God
[36:54] now I want to look at history of the Ark
[36:57] now let me put the picture up there of
[36:58] the Ark so brother Chris can see it so
[36:59] have you seen that before brother
[37:03] right so Noah's Ark was a boat that's a
[37:05] good the same word Arc
[37:07] right it's a box right like a box but
[37:09] this is the ark that was in that third
[37:11] room in the holiest of holies
[37:14] and this represents the presence of God
[37:17] okay so we sang we sing that song right
[37:19] before commune with me commune means to
[37:21] talk right so we say that song come in
[37:24] with me between the wings of the
[37:26] cherubim
[37:27] so God told Moses I will talk to you
[37:30] from right in the middle of those angels
[37:33] and God did God talked with Aaron in
[37:36] between those I don't know if he talked
[37:37] to Moses I don't think Moses went in
[37:38] there
[37:39] I have to look that one up
[37:41] but this is in other words this was the
[37:43] prince of God
[37:45] okay
[37:46] so I want to look at that here now I got
[37:48] the let's look at the history of the Ark
[37:50] so page 264.
[37:54] I was studying here uh
[37:56] I'm going to use this as just a quick
[37:58] reference here
[37:59] so the Ark of the Covenant there's 30
[38:01] minutes already where'd that time go now
[38:04] the ark started of course in the days of
[38:06] Moses and when Moses set up the
[38:09] Tabernacle Brother inside of it Moses
[38:12] put three things he put the stone tables
[38:15] of the law
[38:17] that had the Ten Commandments on it
[38:19] he put Manna which was Heavenly Angel
[38:22] bread
[38:23] okay and then he put a budding rod in
[38:26] Almond branch
[38:28] okay and each one represented something
[38:31] for us today
[38:32] okay the law represents God writing the
[38:36] law on our hearts because the Bible said
[38:38] God writes the word on the fleshly
[38:40] tables of our hearts
[38:42] okay
[38:44] so see when we get born again God writes
[38:46] the word on your heart
[38:48] okay
[38:50] second the Manna represents the bread of
[38:52] life because Jesus said I am the bread
[38:53] of life that come down from heaven
[38:55] he said give us this day our daily bread
[38:58] so the Manna represents the fresh word
[39:01] of God that you get every day on your
[39:03] spiritual journey
[39:04] hallelujah praise God so God writes it
[39:07] permanently in your heart but then also
[39:09] God gives you fresh Manna every single
[39:11] day Hallelujah
[39:13] oh my that's so true amen isn't that
[39:16] true I mean it's amazing you can listen
[39:18] to a sermon you've heard so many times
[39:19] but then something will come out it'll
[39:21] pop out like ah I forgot about there ah
[39:24] I need that for today praise God
[39:28] like I was listening to leadership
[39:29] brother Graham's last sermon
[39:30] you know he did a communion taping but
[39:32] it wasn't a sermon in brotherbraham's
[39:34] last sermon he said this may be my final
[39:36] message before I die
[39:38] right and it just stuck out to me like
[39:39] wow and brother Branham is hammering on
[39:41] getting born again the baptism Holy
[39:43] Ghost don't get it on just your your
[39:44] body and your mind get it in the soul
[39:46] praise God
[39:47] it says last message and he said this
[39:49] may be my last message praise God
[39:52] it's beautiful and he was so sincere
[39:54] just bringing down the word to the
[39:55] people it's more than a church
[39:57] experience don't be a church be a bride
[39:59] Hallelujah
[40:01] right A lot of people could get called
[40:02] out but not everybody goes all the way
[40:04] to the promised land let's go all the
[40:06] way to the promised land amen
[40:08] Hallelujah
[40:11] so Moses brother oh yeah I'm sorry the
[40:13] last one was the rod the rod represents
[40:15] a resurrected life because the Almond
[40:18] Branch was dead brother but when they
[40:20] put it in the holies of holies the next
[40:22] day they went in and it brought back to
[40:24] life and it had almonds fresh almonds on
[40:26] it
[40:27] so it's a dead branch that came back to
[40:29] life that represents how we are new
[40:31] creatures in Christ Jesus
[40:33] yes I were born again yes good
[40:35] Hallelujah from Death unto life the
[40:37] Bible says we were dead in our sins
[40:39] remember Ephesians chapter 2 we're dead
[40:41] in our sins and trespasses but God has
[40:43] quick enough or made us alive
[40:45] okay
[40:46] so written upon the heart it's your
[40:48] daily bread also and it's also uh here
[40:51] uh what's the last one oh a resurrected
[40:53] life he's resurrected he's given you you
[40:56] were dead but now you're alive praise
[40:58] God
[40:59] now I just want to briefly Trace through
[41:01] the history
[41:03] Moses had of course when he finished the
[41:06] Tabernacle this was the meeting place
[41:08] between the Lord and Moses
[41:10] and uh
[41:13] I want to skip down here
[41:17] yeah here let me look at some of the
[41:18] names here yeah here I'm just going to
[41:19] do a quick list here's about uh 12 names
[41:22] here of the Ark here it's called the Ark
[41:24] of the testimony because I had the
[41:26] testimony of the word of God in there
[41:27] the law
[41:28] it's called the Ark of the Covenant of
[41:30] the Lord Covenant is the the promise or
[41:32] the oath God made with Israel
[41:34] it's called the Ark of the Lord God it's
[41:37] called the Ark of the Lord God the Lord
[41:38] of all the Earth it's called The Ark of
[41:40] God it's called The Holy Ark it's called
[41:42] The Ark of thy strength amen
[41:45] amen oh think about that isn't there
[41:47] strength in the law of God's word isn't
[41:49] there strength in a resurrected life
[41:51] praise God isn't there strength in your
[41:53] daily bread Hallelujah
[41:55] the Ark of God's strength oh I love it
[42:00] it's called Eight the Ark of the
[42:01] Covenant of God
[42:03] as ninth is called the Ark of the
[42:05] Covenant tenth is called the Ark of the
[42:07] Lord 11th is called the Ark of the god
[42:10] of Israel
[42:11] and last is called the Ark of
[42:13] shittenwood
[42:14] it's right there's 12 names 12. number
[42:17] of it number of uh tribes isn't that
[42:20] interesting there's 12 names there
[42:23] Hallelujah
[42:25] now a church member of the Ark say with
[42:27] Moses until Joshua then the ark took
[42:29] Joshua into the promised land crossing
[42:32] the Jordan
[42:33] the ark opened up the way the prince of
[42:36] God will always open up the way for us
[42:39] you know the prince of God will go
[42:40] before you and it will prepare the way
[42:42] for you
[42:44] that's right next they took the ark and
[42:46] circled Jericho praise God
[42:48] and Jericho fell
[42:50] now the ark only had to lost that one
[42:53] time there at the beginning when they
[42:54] when Aiken had to sit in the camp right
[42:56] but then they got the sin out and they
[42:58] got the victory
[43:01] Hallelujah
[43:02] and then the ark was positioned between
[43:04] Mount evil the Mount of cursing and
[43:07] mount garazim the Mount of blessing we
[43:08] preach on that in Joshua chapter eight
[43:10] it's been a long time but remember
[43:11] remember they were camped on both sides
[43:12] of the mountain and they were they were
[43:14] citing they were reciting the law to
[43:16] both sides blessing if you do this curse
[43:18] if you do that it's been a while since I
[43:19] preached that one so I don't expect you
[43:21] to remember that one that was Joshua
[43:23] chapter eight
[43:24] but then church the ark went to gilgall
[43:27] when the land was divided
[43:30] right with Joshua Joshua 9 6. then the
[43:32] ark went to Shiloh in Joshua 18 then the
[43:35] ark went to Chic gem in Joshua 24. and
[43:38] then the ark went back to Shiloh again
[43:40] even in the days of the judges now in
[43:42] the days of the judges the ark went in
[43:44] captivity to the Philistines it was
[43:47] taken out of Shiloh at the Battle of
[43:49] afek and Ebenezer and then the ark went
[43:52] to the house of Dagon remember the the
[43:54] Dagon God fell before the ark ah
[43:57] Hallelujah
[43:58] God always makes and every enemy fall at
[44:00] his feet praise God
[44:02] then the ark went to gath that was
[44:04] Goliath place right Gas City then the
[44:06] ark went to Akron but there was plagues
[44:08] and death at ekron but the ark was still
[44:10] in the hand of the Gentiles
[44:13] but then the ark was at Beth shamesh
[44:15] returned on a new cart
[44:17] uh with a trespass offering of the
[44:19] Philistines but the men of shabesh were
[44:23] slain looking for for looking into the
[44:25] ark
[44:26] and 50 000 70 people died because they
[44:29] looked into the ark
[44:30] they tried to touch that resurrected
[44:32] life when they weren't they weren't
[44:33] ordained to do that
[44:35] so you got to be ordained to go in the
[44:36] presence of God
[44:37] right and then the ark was at courageath
[44:40] jerion for 20 years and the Ark was
[44:42] possibly at gibea for a short time under
[44:44] Saul's reign
[44:46] now when Once then the art got back to
[44:48] cure Jeff jirim and David fetched for
[44:52] the ark but he brought it on a new cart
[44:56] right and then the oxen stumbled that
[44:58] now look at the Beast can't handle look
[45:00] beasts aren't made to handle the word of
[45:01] God
[45:02] right but that's what we got today a
[45:04] bunch of Beast preachers
[45:06] right we got a bunch of lion preachers
[45:09] false Doctrine preaching teachers right
[45:11] money hungry preachers what are they the
[45:14] bunch of beasts the Bible says the Bible
[45:16] says they are brewed beasts
[45:18] they have eyes full of adultery and they
[45:21] cannot cease from sinning praise God
[45:23] they are addicted to sin
[45:25] and the Bible calls them beasts and see
[45:27] beasts were trying to carry the ark God
[45:29] never required peace God said let men do
[45:31] it amen let men carry the word on their
[45:33] shoulders praise God Amen because it's
[45:36] right above their heart amen right their
[45:37] hearts right under that it's above their
[45:39] heart right
[45:40] see they're holding the word of God the
[45:43] prince of God is near to their hearts
[45:46] okay and so then remember David didn't
[45:48] know what to do so the ark went to the
[45:50] house of Obed Edom for three months and
[45:52] God blessed his house for three months
[45:54] God's presence will always bless your
[45:56] house
[45:58] Hallelujah Church you just bring God's
[46:00] presence in your house and God will
[46:01] bless it praise God
[46:03] bring the word into your house and watch
[46:05] the Holy Spirit bless your house in ways
[46:07] you can't even describe
[46:09] Hallelujah
[46:11] right but then three months later David
[46:13] finally understood how to do it now I
[46:17] want to read the verses to get to this
[46:18] point eventually I'm going to get to
[46:19] this point
[46:20] when David brought the ark he didn't
[46:22] bring the whole Tabernacle with him
[46:25] he just brought the ark and the tent he
[46:27] did not bring that animal sacrifices
[46:29] with him now we know it said he was
[46:30] sacrificed to animals but the Bible said
[46:32] they left the the Brazen Altar and other
[46:35] things they left that at another
[46:36] location gibia
[46:39] okay so this will tie in eventually here
[46:40] if I can ever get to the end of the
[46:41] sermon here now go to First chronicles
[46:44] 16 38 let's go there first chronicles 16
[46:46] 38.
[46:52] and church there's a real spiritual
[46:54] reason
[46:55] why the Tabernacle was divided I'm going
[46:57] to try to get close with that hopefully
[46:58] God's Great
[47:02] something you could probably see it it
[47:03] was I'm sorry first chronicles 16 38.
[47:05] first chronicles 16 38 it's right after
[47:07] second
[47:09] uh first and second Kings and chronicles
[47:11] kings Kings Chronicles
[47:13] first chronicles 16 38 Lydia you gotta
[47:17] can you read that
[47:27] okay all right now go to First
[47:29] Chronicles 21 29 just a few pages
[47:36] yeah there it is
[47:38] look at this church for the Tabernacle
[47:40] of the Lord which Moses made in the
[47:42] wilderness and the altar of the burnt
[47:44] offering were at that season in the high
[47:46] place at gibeon
[47:48] so see now you have a divided Temple
[47:51] right or Tabernacle the Tabernacle is
[47:53] divided
[47:55] so it looks like you have the Brazen
[47:56] altar at gibeon where they sacrifice
[47:58] animals but then the holy place and the
[48:00] voice of holies was at Jerusalem amen
[48:02] now I'm not Zion amen
[48:04] oh it's gonna it's gonna come into play
[48:06] eventually so just bear with me here I
[48:07] think you'll see it by God's grace
[48:09] that's a beautiful thought
[48:11] I wondered about this for at least a
[48:13] couple years since I preached this
[48:15] okay so you can see now that's where we
[48:17] are here now let me give you the rest of
[48:19] the history now of course uh after David
[48:22] died Solomon built a temple I want to
[48:23] preach on that
[48:25] hopefully this year I had a request to
[48:26] preach on that my brother Paul actually
[48:28] asked me to preach on that and I've
[48:29] actually wanted to and so I bought a
[48:31] book on it
[48:33] um
[48:35] so Solomon of course uh brings the Ark
[48:38] in the house of God
[48:41] and of course the ark stay there now the
[48:43] final mention of the Ark was Jeremy in
[48:44] the Old Testament was Jeremiah 3 16 and
[48:48] 17. so let's read that Jeremiah 3 16 and
[48:51] 17.
[49:09] Jeremiah 3 16 and 17.
[49:12] now this is the last mention the church
[49:14] but remember there is going to be
[49:15] another physical Ark and that's going to
[49:17] be in Revelation 11 when Israel rebuilds
[49:20] the temple and according to Daniel
[49:22] chapter 9 they will re-establish animal
[49:25] worship for three and a half years
[49:27] but that one's not mentioned by name
[49:29] it's not mentioned by The Ark in
[49:31] Revelation 11 it just says uh they'll
[49:33] have a temple and then Daniel 9 says the
[49:35] Antichrist will cut cut the Covenant in
[49:38] the midst of the week he'll cause the
[49:40] daily sacrifice to be stopped in the
[49:42] midst of the week
[49:43] so at the halfway point of the Great
[49:45] Tribulation the Antichrist will break
[49:46] the Covenant and he'll take control
[49:48] he'll try to stop the worship in the
[49:50] Tabernacle there
[49:52] okay so Jeremiah 3 16 and 17.
[49:56] it should come to pass when ye be
[49:58] multiplied an increase in the land and
[49:59] those days saith the Lord they shall say
[50:01] no more the Ark of the Covenant of the
[50:02] Lord neither shall it come to mind
[50:04] neither shall they remember it neither
[50:05] shall they visited neither shall that be
[50:08] done anymore
[50:10] Hallelujah verse 17 at that time they
[50:13] shall call Jerusalem that Throne of the
[50:16] Lord and All Nations shall be gathered
[50:17] into it to the name of the Lord to
[50:19] Jerusalem neither shall they walk any
[50:21] more after the imagination of their
[50:22] heart now this looks like the Millennium
[50:24] to me
[50:25] right because we're not going to need an
[50:27] ark anymore why because we're going to
[50:29] see Jesus Christ himself amen amen there
[50:32] won't need to be anymore Ark right
[50:34] because there there's no need for us to
[50:37] look for the presence of God the prince
[50:38] of God is in his son Christ amen
[50:41] hallelujah praise God remember like uh
[50:44] uh Ezekiel 48 says the prince of God is
[50:48] going to flow into that Temple that
[50:50] Temple the the Millennium Temple must be
[50:52] anointed Jesus is already anointed
[50:54] praise God but the anointing comes in
[50:56] the temple when Jesus comes into the
[50:58] temple praise God that's right amen the
[51:00] millennial Temple praise God Christ
[51:03] comes in the temple and we're all there
[51:04] in white robes Hallelujah with glorified
[51:07] bodies amen that can vanish at a moment
[51:09] and reappear and never sleep praise God
[51:12] hallelujah you can eat if we want we
[51:14] don't have to praise God but we're in
[51:16] glorified bodies dressing white with
[51:18] rods of iron that rule the Nations
[51:20] praise God
[51:22] Hallelujah
[51:25] so that's the last time the ark is
[51:26] mentioned in the Old Testament
[51:28] there's got to come a time when they're
[51:30] not even going to think about the ark
[51:31] anymore because Christ is there
[51:35] hallelujah thank God Amen all right
[51:39] now I already read what the ark
[51:40] represents
[51:43] all those things represents the prince
[51:46] of God it represents the glory of God it
[51:48] represents communion with God
[51:51] all right
[51:52] now we looked at the arc there there's
[51:54] the picture again I want to do a little
[51:56] bit more on David's dancing here
[51:58] so bear with me I want to read this here
[51:59] out of off of page 120.
[52:09] so we see there's actually two portions
[52:11] of scripture that record David bring in
[52:12] the ark it's first Chronicles 15 and
[52:15] second Samuel 6 as we just read here
[52:18] Hallelujah
[52:21] now the Bible says this was a March
[52:23] where they would sacrifice every six
[52:26] Paces they would sacrifice literal
[52:28] animals right
[52:29] so there was a lot of sacrifice going on
[52:31] in terms how many know God loves
[52:32] sacrifice
[52:34] you sacrificed to come here tonight some
[52:35] of you worked hard all day
[52:37] right but you made a sacrifice to come
[52:39] here well now you now you got one of the
[52:40] steps praise God
[52:41] right but don't stop there keep bringing
[52:44] more worship praise God that's part of
[52:46] it amen
[52:47] Hallelujah
[52:49] but they also had singing shouting the
[52:52] sound of coronets trumpet symbols
[52:54] sultries and harps and we got some
[52:56] pretty good sultries and harps over here
[52:57] praise God
[52:59] Hallelujah
[53:00] just waiting for somebody to jump on
[53:02] that Cajon pretty soon right God's grace
[53:03] what do you think Victoria Hallelujah
[53:06] somebody
[53:09] the women of Israel dance in and out and
[53:11] between in those great processions it
[53:14] certainly was not a quiet service
[53:16] right
[53:18] but one of great joy gladness and
[53:20] excitement and enthusiasm David played
[53:23] and danced with all of his might before
[53:25] the Lord the singers and musicians sang
[53:27] and play with all their their might the
[53:30] ark was the center of Attraction amen
[53:33] Hallelujah
[53:36] to see the ark the prince of God was
[53:39] coming back into position
[53:42] the prince of God was coming into the
[53:44] city of God
[53:45] amen hallelujah
[53:47] the glory of God was coming back to its
[53:50] rightful position amen
[53:52] the glory of God was predestinated to be
[53:54] their Church the prince of God is
[53:56] predestinated to be here with us amen
[53:59] because we're Believers and wherever two
[54:01] or three are gathered there Christ is
[54:03] the supernatural one in their midst
[54:06] Hallelujah
[54:07] it's predestinated to be here praise God
[54:10] Hallelujah
[54:13] it's ordained this is the position of
[54:15] God's presence Hallelujah
[54:17] thank you Lord
[54:21] but then we see of course the wrong side
[54:23] we see the Macau side
[54:26] right everybody else is dancing enjoying
[54:28] it she should have come down and got
[54:30] into worship
[54:33] but the Bible said the word uh the word
[54:36] the ark the ark discerns the thoughts
[54:39] and intents of the heart oh my goodness
[54:40] there it is amen the presence of God the
[54:43] word of God coming in and it discerned
[54:45] everybody's heart that's what it is
[54:46] tonight the word of God preached it will
[54:48] discern your heart praise God
[54:50] which side are we going to be on the
[54:52] McCall side or the David side let's be
[54:54] on David's side Hallelujah let's be real
[54:57] worshipers amen let's Rejoice that the
[55:00] prince of God is here praise God
[55:03] this is a Revival message amen
[55:06] well you could say maybe it's a baptism
[55:07] of the Holy Ghost message for those that
[55:09] are seeking the Baptist the Holy Ghost
[55:10] which I know numerous are
[55:13] that's the kind of message this is
[55:14] praise God
[55:16] because the presence of God is coming
[55:18] into his rightful position with shouting
[55:20] rejoicing praise wherever God is there's
[55:23] noise amen hallelujah
[55:26] Hallelujah unless let me say this let me
[55:29] let me balance that unless you're
[55:31] isolated with God
[55:32] right because then when Elijah was
[55:34] isolated with God it was what a still
[55:35] small voice
[55:37] right
[55:39] so see sometimes God's presence in the
[55:41] community it's loud it's rejoicing
[55:43] sometimes when you're isolated with God
[55:44] just you and God it's that still a small
[55:46] voice you got to listen for it
[55:48] Lord is this exactly you I want to make
[55:50] sure let me check that by the word to
[55:51] make sure that's a scriptural voice
[55:52] that's why I loved who his testimony we
[55:54] put out today she had twice time she
[55:56] heard the voice of God the first time it
[55:58] said don't or take off those take off
[56:00] those earrings boy that's a scriptural
[56:01] voice sister
[56:04] amen and she's like am I going crazy and
[56:07] then the voice said again take off those
[56:08] earrings
[56:10] and the boy said turn off that Christmas
[56:11] music right
[56:12] beautiful testimony mine isn't that
[56:14] beautiful how the Holy Spirit discerns
[56:16] our hearts that's so beautiful
[56:18] and what a privilege God speaks to you
[56:19] like that sister that's beautiful
[56:22] see that's the voice of God we have the
[56:24] privilege but it was a still small voice
[56:26] right God speaks right in your car too
[56:28] amen I like that amen you can sneak in
[56:31] your house in your car in the service
[56:33] out there in the bathroom right Haven
[56:35] you can he can speak a word of encourage
[56:36] him in the bathroom again
[56:38] Hallelujah if you need an encouraging
[56:40] word God wants to speak God wants to be
[56:42] present God wants us to reach out for
[56:44] the spirit praise God
[56:46] that shows we're on fire
[56:49] thank God Amen
[56:50] Hallelujah
[56:55] she could have been down there
[56:56] worshiping but the word discerned
[56:59] the thoughts and intents of her heart
[57:05] bye now what did she see now look at
[57:08] this all she saw
[57:12] was the flesh
[57:16] and church that's what we got to be
[57:17] careful we got to look past the flesh
[57:20] she looked at the Flesh and said what a
[57:22] fanatic
[57:23] he took off his King's robes he's got
[57:25] priest robes on he's the king
[57:28] he shouting and dancing what are all My
[57:30] Maids going to think about that she was
[57:32] only looking at the flesh she didn't see
[57:33] the spirit
[57:35] oh hallelujah oh and that beautiful
[57:37] church that's why people come here all
[57:39] they see is just fleshly stuff oh he you
[57:42] know he stutters when he preaches he
[57:44] screams too loud he spits all they see
[57:46] is a flesh they don't see the spirit of
[57:48] God moving in the souls moving behind
[57:51] the scene they don't hear the voice of
[57:52] God in the midst of it praise God they
[57:54] just see a bunch of Fanatics and people
[57:56] raiding their hands and shouting and
[57:58] rejoicing they only see flesh but we see
[58:00] more than that we see the Unseen we see
[58:03] angels we see the Holy Spirit we see God
[58:06] Discerning thoughts and intents we see
[58:08] God answering prayer we see the spirit
[58:10] praise God
[58:11] that's all Michael saw was the flesh
[58:14] I just see him a Madman jumping out
[58:16] there well let me be a Madman let me be
[58:19] with the spirit and if you don't like
[58:21] that Nicole watch this and she just
[58:24] Praises God and worships and praise God
[58:26] all they see is the flesh that's all
[58:28] they want to see but if you're a
[58:30] Christian you'll see the spirit behind
[58:31] it praise God
[58:33] you'll see the joy in the word coming
[58:36] where the Bible says and for this
[58:38] purpose the Bible said the David was
[58:40] rejoicing because now he could inquire
[58:43] of God and talk to God amen amen oh
[58:46] church let me say that like this you're
[58:47] not talking to God in denomination
[58:49] you're talking to God here and the
[58:51] message of the hour praise God
[58:54] I know because I was Raising it you were
[58:57] raising the money God was not talking to
[58:59] us there God's talking here with
[59:01] Revelations of thus saith the Lord
[59:04] hallelujah
[59:06] they were talking Jesse you need to be
[59:07] baptized and Firestone Holy Ghost I'm
[59:09] like okay that wasn't God talking
[59:11] right and the church said
[59:13] that wasn't God talking I wasn't going
[59:15] to hear God there oh Jesse it's okay for
[59:17] you to get a tattoo and all these things
[59:18] like that no no that wasn't God talking
[59:21] huh Jesse it's okay for you to buy
[59:24] alcohol on your birthday and let's have
[59:25] a late night and get drunk which we
[59:27] didn't get drunk that night but I did
[59:28] buy alcohol my 21st birthday
[59:30] that's what they said but God was saying
[59:33] no don't drink that have some new wine
[59:34] amen I got some better wine than that of
[59:37] Corona praise God I got wine Corona
[59:39] don't know nothing about praise God I
[59:41] got the joy of the Lord the strength of
[59:44] God hallelujah
[59:45] Hallelujah
[59:50] but see all the McCall all a Judas sees
[59:53] is the flesh they don't see the life
[59:55] behind it
[59:57] they don't see the joy behind it
[59:59] said David lost all his pride so she
[1:00:02] didn't see the humility behind it
[1:00:04] Church it takes a humble person to dance
[1:00:06] in the church
[1:00:09] now I know some people do it pridefully
[1:00:11] but by God's grace we're not doing it
[1:00:13] pridefully we're doing it because we
[1:00:14] want to be free and we want to Worship
[1:00:16] the Lord
[1:00:17] hallelujah
[1:00:19] thank God Hallelujah
[1:00:23] see David had to get humble and then he
[1:00:25] could dance before the Lord
[1:00:27] then he could Worship the Lord
[1:00:30] but all she saw was the flesh she didn't
[1:00:33] look at that oh my goodness
[1:00:36] that whole time Church all she saw was
[1:00:38] the flesh she didn't even see the Ark of
[1:00:40] God coming in
[1:00:41] the prince of God see that's what how it
[1:00:44] is people come here they'll miss the
[1:00:45] actual preaching of the word of God
[1:00:48] the prince of God God heals cancer God
[1:00:50] heals tumors
[1:00:52] God Saves Souls God fills Souls with the
[1:00:54] Holy Ghost they miss all they miss the
[1:00:56] ark they miss the voice of God they miss
[1:00:59] the Revelation to thus say Lord all they
[1:01:01] see is flesh oh it's a small church and
[1:01:03] they're Fanatics and the guy spits and
[1:01:04] everybody's in one Accord everybody's
[1:01:06] dressing humble like that they miss the
[1:01:08] Ark of God they miss the presence of God
[1:01:10] but thank God we enjoy it we invite the
[1:01:13] presence of God hallelujah that's what
[1:01:15] we see when we come to church praise God
[1:01:18] the prince of God she missed the ark she
[1:01:22] missed the word of God
[1:01:25] blessed are your eyes
[1:01:27] for they see the word of God
[1:01:29] blessed are your ears for they hear the
[1:01:32] word of God
[1:01:33] don't look so much of the flesh Church
[1:01:35] the flesh is going to let you down
[1:01:37] look to the holy ghost look to what the
[1:01:40] word of God is saying look to the voice
[1:01:42] of God look to the life behind the flesh
[1:01:46] Hallelujah
[1:01:49] oh it's a beautiful thought
[1:01:51] she did not see the Ark of God
[1:01:54] and she did not return into the Lord's
[1:01:57] presence she kept her distance look at
[1:01:58] that she kept her distance from the Holy
[1:01:59] Ghost she said I don't want any of that
[1:02:01] fanaticism now look everybody else is
[1:02:02] down there they were cheering David on
[1:02:04] and David is saying this saw us
[1:02:07] thousands of David said no no doubt they
[1:02:08] were worshiping God they were praising
[1:02:09] God all these women and men praising God
[1:02:11] but she sat up there and wouldn't even
[1:02:13] praise God
[1:02:14] she wouldn't come down with the Holy
[1:02:15] Rollers well you at least did a good
[1:02:17] thing about coming down here with the
[1:02:18] Holy Rollers
[1:02:19] Hallelujah that's a good step praise God
[1:02:22] but she stayed way up there ignored the
[1:02:24] ark ignored the prince of God stayed
[1:02:26] aside and when it come down to talk to
[1:02:28] those Holy Rollers she didn't have
[1:02:29] anything good to say about him just
[1:02:31] criticism
[1:02:33] so let's say something good about
[1:02:34] somebody I said you want somebody to say
[1:02:36] something good about you say good say
[1:02:37] something good about somebody else
[1:02:39] praise God
[1:02:40] see church we got to say good things
[1:02:42] Hallelujah
[1:02:44] Glory
[1:02:47] oh that's a beautiful thought
[1:02:49] now Church here's a few thoughts I want
[1:02:50] to bring out here I think I might have
[1:02:52] mentioned them earlier
[1:02:57] you know when I dance it's usually under
[1:03:00] control right
[1:03:01] I don't look like I'm out of control
[1:03:05] and so my thought was this if you can
[1:03:07] have a prescribed or a practice song
[1:03:09] special like how many times did awesome
[1:03:11] practice the song before you sing it
[1:03:14] I know I practice my shoulder song at
[1:03:16] home before I kill
[1:03:17] right if I can practice a song that I
[1:03:20] believe the holy spirit's anointing why
[1:03:22] can't I practice a dancing at the Holy
[1:03:24] Holy Ghost to get anointed
[1:03:26] right
[1:03:29] just like brothers says it's okay for
[1:03:30] children to have Holy Ghost plays like a
[1:03:34] Christmas play at their Church which a
[1:03:35] lot of the churches do right
[1:03:37] I know the church uh the grams go to now
[1:03:39] they have a Christmas play they have an
[1:03:41] Easter play they have all these plays
[1:03:42] that's fine
[1:03:44] but if they if they believe that's light
[1:03:45] of the Holy Spirit then why can't maybe
[1:03:48] they do but I'm not using them an
[1:03:49] example if I'm just saying why can't we
[1:03:51] have a a planned out dance service
[1:03:54] because you plan out for the song
[1:03:56] special in the Holy Ghost Falls
[1:03:59] you plan out for a play and sometimes
[1:04:01] people got saved at the place
[1:04:03] right they can remember the Canada
[1:04:06] Church
[1:04:10] so see if you can practice those why
[1:04:12] can't you practice dancing in the spirit
[1:04:15] Paul said if I sing let me sing in the
[1:04:17] spirit oh there it is if I pray let me
[1:04:21] pray in the spirit if I Dance Let Me
[1:04:23] dance in the spirit praise God Not In
[1:04:25] the Flesh not in sin not in Pride but in
[1:04:27] humility and worship to God hallelujah
[1:04:32] look Church
[1:04:34] David was under control of the spirit
[1:04:36] but Abraham said he lost all of his
[1:04:38] pride and he was just happy
[1:04:42] so while they were killing the animals
[1:04:44] every now look every six spaces so here
[1:04:46] he would dance then he'd go one two
[1:04:48] three four five six and then when it
[1:04:51] stopped right here they killed six more
[1:04:52] animals and he would glorify God he did
[1:04:55] all these stops in between he'd come
[1:04:57] over here and dance he's leaping and
[1:04:59] praising God Amen
[1:05:01] but he was under control he was just so
[1:05:03] happy the prince of God is here
[1:05:07] now look Church especially on that
[1:05:09] second time look he knew he was going to
[1:05:11] go dance again
[1:05:12] so you can't say well you can only dance
[1:05:14] when it's unplanned if so then David
[1:05:16] broke the scripture
[1:05:17] but there's no scripture on that
[1:05:19] the Bible says praise His name in the
[1:05:21] dance
[1:05:22] and the church said
[1:05:24] Hallelujah so see you can't say or it's
[1:05:27] only spontaneous dancing no
[1:05:29] David didn't the second time wasn't
[1:05:30] spontaneous the second time in fact he
[1:05:33] repeated it right three months later the
[1:05:35] first time he danced USA died three
[1:05:37] months later he danced again
[1:05:40] and wouldn't that be great if we could
[1:05:41] dance every three months
[1:05:43] I just thought I'd throw that in there
[1:05:45] would that be greater three four times a
[1:05:47] year right 12 divided by three is four
[1:05:49] four times a year you we dance and
[1:05:51] praise the Lord wouldn't that be great
[1:05:52] Hallelujah
[1:05:55] so see Church there's liberty in the
[1:05:57] Holy Spirit
[1:05:58] in fact every time we're Joyful We ought
[1:06:00] to give God a little dance praise God
[1:06:03] ought to Rejoice to say thank you Jesus
[1:06:04] for every blessing Hallelujah all you've
[1:06:07] done for me thank you for the cross
[1:06:09] thank you for the blood thank you for
[1:06:10] our new life thank you for the
[1:06:12] resurrection praise God thank you for
[1:06:13] the law of God on my heart thank you for
[1:06:16] the man of the daily word of my soul and
[1:06:18] thank you that I'm a new creature I'm a
[1:06:20] resurrected life Hallelujah
[1:06:23] thank you for the Ark of my life
[1:06:25] Hallelujah
[1:06:27] thank God Amen
[1:06:30] Glory I'm almost at an hour
[1:06:34] remember what did Mount Zion represent
[1:06:36] what did this mountain represent
[1:06:39] it represents the place where God dwells
[1:06:41] it represents the place of salvation
[1:06:44] this is a whole list remember I preached
[1:06:46] to them there's like 30 of these
[1:06:49] there's 25 of these verses about what
[1:06:51] Zion is
[1:06:52] the place of strength it's the place of
[1:06:55] joy of the whole Earth come on Church
[1:06:57] come on it's a place to join Hallelujah
[1:07:02] oh not my here you know I forgot that
[1:07:05] verse take your Bibles here I forgot
[1:07:06] that verse they just come to me now
[1:07:10] um
[1:07:11] First Chronicles 13 3 yeah
[1:07:17] First Chronicles 13 3.
[1:07:21] brother Malcolm why don't you read that
[1:07:22] when you get there first Chronicles 13
[1:07:23] 3.
[1:07:25] this is what makes the message Church
[1:07:27] different from the domination like I
[1:07:29] said
[1:07:29] I can't go to a dominational church and
[1:07:31] let me inquire like let's say I went to
[1:07:33] the Baptist Church let me inquire should
[1:07:35] my wife wear earrings
[1:07:38] can we do that at the Baptist Church can
[1:07:40] we inquire of the Lord what are they
[1:07:41] going to say of course you can
[1:07:43] see they're not inquiring to the Lord
[1:07:45] see that in that beautiful doctor I
[1:07:47] never really thought about that till
[1:07:47] today
[1:07:49] this is a beautiful type of the baptism
[1:07:51] of the Holy Ghost I love it man now I'm
[1:07:54] going to read that
[1:08:01] see the whole time that denomination
[1:08:03] preacher right so he didn't have the
[1:08:07] word
[1:08:08] so he couldn't inquire of God he started
[1:08:11] off good you know following your lord
[1:08:12] and humility but then when the troubles
[1:08:14] came he didn't have the ark there to
[1:08:16] consult
[1:08:17] he wasn't seeking God's will he wasn't
[1:08:20] seeking God's perfect will church he
[1:08:22] didn't want to know God's will
[1:08:24] he wanted his will he wanted to please
[1:08:26] the people I don't want to please you I
[1:08:28] want to please God hallelujah
[1:08:30] I hope you say this hey I don't want to
[1:08:32] please any man or pastor's opinion I
[1:08:34] want to please God hallelujah
[1:08:36] kind I want to be kind to you but we
[1:08:38] want to please God we're here to please
[1:08:40] the Lord Jesus Christ and church that's
[1:08:42] the difference in our church brother
[1:08:43] Austin you can inquire of God and find a
[1:08:46] Bible answer praise God
[1:08:48] they told me I could smoke cigarettes
[1:08:51] they told me I could I could drink
[1:08:52] alcohol they told me my wife could wear
[1:08:55] sexy clothes they told me my wife could
[1:08:57] wear makeup and shirts because they
[1:08:59] weren't inquiring of God thank god
[1:09:00] brother we can inquire give me high five
[1:09:02] buddy we can inquire God when you read
[1:09:04] this word the Holy Spirit Will point you
[1:09:06] the word of God hallelujah
[1:09:09] and we could know exactly what the word
[1:09:11] says about something
[1:09:13] Hallelujah
[1:09:15] oh it's beautiful church it's beautiful
[1:09:18] what a type it is of the New Testament
[1:09:19] believer
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:22] go to the denomination you inquire the
[1:09:25] Lord on certain things they'll let you
[1:09:26] do almost anything as long as you come
[1:09:27] to church
[1:09:28] right but David was different David who
[1:09:31] said I want the word in my presence
[1:09:33] I want to live in the presence of the
[1:09:35] word I want to go in my prayer closet
[1:09:37] and I want to hear the voice of God Amen
[1:09:39] amen that's what happens many times for
[1:09:41] me I'll be praying and then a scripture
[1:09:42] will come and I'll preach on it
[1:09:44] right then somebody say oh that's what I
[1:09:46] needed well God gave it to me it wasn't
[1:09:47] me it was God
[1:09:49] right right it's just God
[1:09:52] you know that's how we do it we got to
[1:09:54] go and inquire of God we get the prince
[1:09:56] of God and God drops down his
[1:09:58] inspiration the thought of God the mind
[1:10:00] of Christ comes to us praise God
[1:10:03] and that's what the ark is in our lives
[1:10:05] the prince of God the glory of God in
[1:10:07] our lives
[1:10:09] oh there's so much things it is there's
[1:10:11] 25 things it is 25 I've already preached
[1:10:13] an hour so I've ever I need to close the
[1:10:15] close here pretty soon
[1:10:18] but Zion is the place where the lord's
[1:10:21] name is declared and praised
[1:10:25] right
[1:10:27] so here you can bring any question
[1:10:28] brother Chris I hope you do buddy you
[1:10:30] can bring any question in this church
[1:10:31] and by the grace of God we'll inquire
[1:10:33] God we'll look in the word and give you
[1:10:35] the best answer we can
[1:10:37] and I promise you if you went to
[1:10:38] domination they give you the wrong

[1:10:54] one thing I want is God's blessing in My
[1:10:56] Life Church
[1:10:58] Zion is a place of God's rest and his
[1:11:01] habitation forever
[1:11:04] no wonder David rejoiced no wonder this
[1:11:07] is where God's going to dwell of all the
[1:11:09] cities on the earth God is here of all
[1:11:12] the denominations of all the churches

[1:11:30] oh it's beautiful design is the place

[1:11:35] Zion is a place of shouting singing in

[1:11:55] Hallelujah
[1:11:56] I better find a place to go it's already
[1:11:57] been an hour
[1:11:58] so I wanted to close here I want to
[1:12:00] close here
[1:12:01] let me yeah
[1:12:03] he's on the way to church Malachi's
[1:12:04] driving that gives me a little bit more
[1:12:05] time to study
[1:12:07] let me just show you while I was driving
[1:12:09] on the road this all this was fresh it
[1:12:11] just came to me while I was driving
[1:12:13] so I didn't have time to put on the
[1:12:14] slideshow okay I didn't have time to
[1:12:17] type out all the nice
[1:12:19] nice readable legible handwriting didn't
[1:12:21] have time to type it out but this all
[1:12:23] came while I was driving I was I've
[1:12:24] never really seen this before
[1:12:26] now
[1:12:28] here we have the three Old Testament
[1:12:30] Tabernacles right you have Moses's
[1:12:34] then it would come to David's Tabernacle
[1:12:36] and then it come to Solomon's Temple and
[1:12:38] the church said
[1:12:39] let me see did I yeah this is my last
[1:12:41] one so I'm gonna try to close it I'm
[1:12:42] going to try to close here
[1:12:46] now Moses is Tabernacle was temporary
[1:12:53] right it was in transit
[1:12:57] right
[1:12:58] and I'll say like this it was out of
[1:13:00] position
[1:13:02] it was going somewhere
[1:13:05] right
[1:13:08] and so Moses Tabernacle is a type of the
[1:13:11] Old Testament
[1:13:14] praise God
[1:13:16] it wasn't in position
[1:13:18] right
[1:13:20] they were constantly it was temporary
[1:13:22] the Bible said the law vanishes away now
[1:13:24] that scripture right there Hebrews
[1:13:25] chapter 8.
[1:13:26] the law is old and Decay and waxeth and
[1:13:29] vanishes the way
[1:13:31] right
[1:13:32] now here's the one that brother Jose
[1:13:34] said after 32 years God showed him this
[1:13:37] revelation
[1:13:39] when it came to David
[1:13:40] David finally possessed the entire
[1:13:43] Promised Land all that was given to
[1:13:45] Joshua 500 years David finally conquers
[1:13:48] all of it
[1:13:50] and Jose as you heard him testify he
[1:13:52] couldn't understand why was what about
[1:13:54] the what why did he wear or what was how
[1:13:56] was David the priest you know because
[1:13:58] Jesus Christ is prophet
[1:14:00] priest and King
[1:14:02] and Jose said for 32 years I wondered
[1:14:04] how is David a time of Christ I see the
[1:14:09] prophet I see he's king of saints but
[1:14:11] how is he preached amen and then God led
[1:14:14] me to preach on Mount Zion
[1:14:15] where David when the word of God came
[1:14:18] when the prince of God came into a
[1:14:20] position David took off his kingly robe
[1:14:22] he's still King
[1:14:24] he's still anointed king
[1:14:26] he still prophesying with his heart amen
[1:14:28] but now he becomes the priest ah now he
[1:14:33] said sacrifice here sacrifice here
[1:14:35] praise God here praise God here now he
[1:14:37] becomes priests and then He blesses the
[1:14:39] people and sends them away with food now
[1:14:42] he's both Prophet King and he's priests
[1:14:45] Hallelujah a perfect type of Jesus
[1:14:48] Christ Hallelujah
[1:14:51] thank God Amen
[1:14:53] oh it's so beautiful
[1:14:55] now even though here in David's side it
[1:15:00] was still temporary materials
[1:15:02] mostly wood
[1:15:04] right
[1:15:06] but now it's in position
[1:15:10] and remember Church
[1:15:12] the sacrificial part was separated from
[1:15:16] there
[1:15:16] it's almost as if they didn't need
[1:15:18] sacrifices anymore not that they didn't
[1:15:20] but it was a type
[1:15:23] the old animal sacrifice the old way of
[1:15:25] sins was separated from it
[1:15:27] Church said
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:31] right
[1:15:32] because the raising altar I run into the
[1:15:34] scripture was there at gibea so the
[1:15:37] sacrifices of Moses were elsewhere so
[1:15:40] Moses there it is Moses stayed separate
[1:15:42] from David the law stayed separate from
[1:15:45] David
[1:15:46] in Moses day they had no singers they
[1:15:49] had no worshipers but David when the
[1:15:51] word of God when the word of God got to
[1:15:53] its position he said I want this many
[1:15:55] men singing I want that many women
[1:15:57] singing I want musicians there this is
[1:15:59] going to be a house of worship Praise of
[1:16:01] God is going to flow out of this church
[1:16:03] night and day Hallelujah
[1:16:06] ah but the Moses and sacrificial system
[1:16:09] was separate that's a perfect type see
[1:16:11] David typed the New Testament Church and
[1:16:14] give you was the blinded Jews
[1:16:17] the current condition we're in right now
[1:16:20] we're not together we're separated
[1:16:24] here we are we're dancing and praising
[1:16:26] God we're worshiping God the glory of
[1:16:28] God the word of God the prince of God is
[1:16:32] with the Gentiles amen
[1:16:35] but the Jews don't have that all they've
[1:16:37] got is the old formal system of Moses I
[1:16:39] about shot him when I was driving I had
[1:16:41] to contain myself now okay because
[1:16:42] you're driving I don't want to distract
[1:16:43] him and get him in a car accident
[1:16:45] I had to contain myself like there it is
[1:16:47] Glory
[1:16:49] thank God Amen
[1:16:51] a perfect time Jesus Christ is Prophet
[1:16:54] priest and King right now praise God and
[1:16:57] we have worshipers we have singers we
[1:16:59] have musicians and the prince of God is
[1:17:01] here and people are real worshipers here
[1:17:05] and you and I like I said we can inquire
[1:17:08] of the Ark brother Chris

[1:19:59] was a permanent dwelling place for God's
[1:20:01] presence brother
[1:20:03] this type selenium notice it was built
[1:20:06] by a Jew the son of David
[1:20:08] Jesus Christ the son of David
[1:20:11] but he had Gentile helpers
[1:20:14] and the church said
[1:20:16] he had two men named Hiram or Hiram I
[1:20:18] don't know I think it's Hiram
[1:20:20] two kings named hiron brought him all
[1:20:22] the cedar all the wood precious stones
[1:20:25] the Jew the son of David could not build
[1:20:28] it without the Gentiles
[1:20:30] get your Bibles go to Isaiah 65 21.
[1:20:38] this Dwelling Place of God was going to
[1:20:40] have both Jews and Gentiles build it and
[1:20:43] it was going to be a permanent dwelling
[1:20:45] place for the prince of God oh I can't
[1:20:47] wait brother I can't build nothing here
[1:20:48] but I can't wait in that window I'm
[1:20:49] gonna I'm gonna understand how to build
[1:20:50] in there
[1:20:52] I can't hardly put two pieces of wood
[1:20:54] together with a nail but
[1:20:55] over there sister I'm gonna know how to
[1:20:57] do it
[1:20:58] God's Gonna download me with some wisdom
[1:21:01] Hallelujah
[1:21:03] Isaiah 65 21. you got it with amen he
[1:21:06] read 21 and 22.
[1:21:26] let's say praise the Lord can we praise
[1:21:28] the Lord
[1:21:29] here you have Gentiles building
[1:21:32] and you have the son of man building
[1:21:35] ah beautiful Church these were all types
[1:21:39] for us to enjoy but where are we at now
[1:21:41] Saints we're at the Tabernacle of David
[1:21:44] that's where we are a place where we can
[1:21:47] ask God our questions and God will
[1:21:49] answer us
[1:21:51] brother every question in my life almost
[1:21:52] God has answered me I said God why do we
[1:21:54] have a small church and God set Brother
[1:21:57] Ray in here to protect me
[1:21:59] to protect my children
[1:22:02] that's why we're small Church it took
[1:22:04] years
[1:22:05] but I inquired of God and I would lay
[1:22:07] here but I would lay here and cry right
[1:22:08] here at this altar God why is our church
[1:22:10] so small I'm preaching my heart out I
[1:22:12] just want to be a full-time pastor and
[1:22:13] God had to give me a thus saith the Lord
[1:22:15] for through Brother Ray it's to protect
[1:22:17] you and your children
[1:22:19] so then I can say hallelujah he talks
[1:22:21] back
[1:22:22] I inquired of God and God talked back
[1:22:26] amen hallelujah thank God
[1:22:29] and then people come from mega churches
[1:22:31] and come here and say this is such a
[1:22:32] loving place I'd rather have a few with
[1:22:34] the love of Christ than a million with a
[1:22:37] bunch of divisive spirits
[1:22:40] because the Bible said God hates
[1:22:41] division
[1:22:43] God hates when brothers are in conflict
[1:22:45] and sisters are in conflict with one
[1:22:47] another God loves the unity of the Holy
[1:22:50] Spirit
[1:22:50] let's stand to our feet praise God let's
[1:22:52] give God a round of applause
[1:22:53] musicians can come oh thank you Lord
[1:22:57] amen
[1:22:59] thank you Jesus
[1:23:01] I don't have all my answers brother but
[1:23:03] almost all my aunts all my main
[1:23:06] questions God has answered
[1:23:08] here and the friends of Christ where the
[1:23:09] Holy Ghost is here
[1:23:12] we inquire of God and God shows us the
[1:23:15] answers to our questions
[1:23:19] Hallelujah
[1:23:21] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:23:23] let me show brother Christians I think I
[1:23:25] got to open right here
[1:23:28] 's a few pictures brother Chris of the
[1:23:29] Solomon's Temple
[1:23:31] so it was totally covered in gold
[1:23:34] this was the uh holy place
[1:23:36] the second the second the second room
[1:23:39] and this was just not this was natural
[1:23:41] this was built 3000 years ago
[1:23:44] it was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar
[1:23:47] there's another the side view of it
[1:23:50] the outer Court
[1:23:52] place to clean holy place
[1:23:54] there's the two cherubim right they come
[1:23:55] in and talk to they'd hear Jesus they'd
[1:23:57] hear the Holy Ghost speak right there
[1:24:02] there's another view of it just looking
[1:24:03] that one's a little more blurry but yeah
[1:24:05] they got the Brazen altar they'd wash
[1:24:07] here they'd kill the animals here they
[1:24:08] want the priest would wash here
[1:24:12] and then there's all the different uh
[1:24:14] we'll go through this Lord willing we'll
[1:24:15] go through all the the pieces and what
[1:24:16] they represent it's very similar to the
[1:24:19] Tabernacle Moses and there's the Queen
[1:24:21] of Sheba come in there
[1:24:22] you had 12 lines six Lions on each side
[1:24:25] and she just fainted She fainted this
[1:24:27] house is in order what brother Ram say
[1:24:29] all they did was rally around the
[1:24:31] preaching gift that God gave them
[1:24:34] Church all we gotta do is Rally around
[1:24:35] my gift
[1:24:37] rally around brother amen's preaching
[1:24:38] gift and the church said
[1:24:40] all he's got to do is Rally around the
[1:24:42] ministers that come in here just rally
[1:24:43] just support them pray for them pull on
[1:24:45] the gift of God
[1:24:46] and our hearts will faint at what God
[1:24:48] will do
[1:24:49] Hallelujah he's already done great
[1:24:51] things Church
[1:24:52] he like I told you he's done enough in
[1:24:54] my life where if he doesn't do anything
[1:24:55] else he was so incredibly good to me

[1:25:23] word of Prayer
