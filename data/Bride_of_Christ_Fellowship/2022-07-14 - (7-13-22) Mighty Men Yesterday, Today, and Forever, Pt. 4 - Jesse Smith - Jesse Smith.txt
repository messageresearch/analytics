========================================

purpose again is to increase our faith now today's not going to be so much rah-rah amen amen you know that's a that's one kind of mighty the other kind of mighty is getting through sufferings that's kind of mighty i'm going to deal with tonight because you are you need the same mightiness to get because is that even a word uh we need the same mighty power to get through trials just like we need the same mighty trial to take down giants that's right the same holy spirit can be mightiness both ways that's right okay so i want to just increase our faith that we can uh serve god miley if you have your bibles go to second corinthians 11. i'm going to just read through this whole chapter it's not too long i want you to look at how god's power worked through paul mightily and i spelled mightily wrong there i don't mean that why i'm a first grade teacher nature so i'm always great in spelling test ah i miss my own spelling so i get a b minus on this one if you want to grade me give me a b okay i didn't earn it hey this time uh second ordean is 11 please again this week i had a guy from overseas make a video about me bashing me you know because i don't i don't i only believe three out of the seven major visions are fulfilled so he made a whole video an hour-long sermon bashing me the whole time i didn't even listen to it oh my god i don't care let them say what they love i explained it perfectly i explained not perfectly i've explained it the best that i know on there if the first three visions were uh you no one around the world could doubt the first three visions fulfillment if the first reader like that i believe the rest will be like that and there's still no one there's still no driverless car where there's no steering wheel and families driving around that cannot be proved around the world same thing with the fifth the leaf dress the leaf dressed the fig leaf dress and then uh the woman ruling america with absolute power and the nation is bowed to this woman that has not happened yet that's my opinion so just let's share with you you know you stand for something you're gonna be criticized but you know what you're gonna get criticized whether you stand or not right so you should stand on your convictions as they go back to the word and then stand above the criticism with love they'll draw me out of the circle i'll draw them back in the message right they draw me out because i got the love of jesus i don't know what they got but i got the love of jesus christ now um so we see paul says even in the warning of men and even in his teaching it was god's spirit working in him mightily so what are we saying in every detail of your life god wants to work in us mightily there's not a day where he doesn't want to show his power in us now we and we're not to expect you know the debt being raised every day like i said it's a generational thing you know uh but we can still see god's power working in us changing us changing situations changing our thoughts about things right making us more forgiving more loving praise god giving us warnings praise god not to go a certain direction okay but it works in us as we labor for christ and we strive against the flesh it's the holy spirit working in us mightily praise god we've got to keep fighting we've got to keep striving praise god no second corinthians 11. verse one now this is an interesting chapter paul uses sarcasm in the sket in this chapter if you haven't read it for a while i've read it listen to it read it today he's trying to correct the corinthians they have accepted these false apostles and as you read the text they're exalting themselves they're prideful preachers like we've been dealing with right i thought wow this is so similar to what we're dealing with today they were exalting themselves and their credentials but paul says they were false apostles would to god he could uh bear with me a little my folly and indeed bear with me you're going to see his folly as he's going to start boasting about himself because that's what they were doing they were the false and he was trying to prove to the church that he started the false apostles are boasting now i'm going to boast if you want some boasting i'm going to give you a boast right because he's saying it seems like you only want boasting you're so immature you're so carnal you just want people to boast so he said i'm going to boast for i'm jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ so paul says i started the church in holiness but now it's gotten off the mark and i'm jealous over it the church remember a few months ago when i preached those 24 heirs that preacher preached at a church that i love remember that what was that that was godly jealousy i spent hours and hours going over that man's sermon 24 heirs brother william on one sermon there's probably more i wrote to him i called him on the phone i sent the letter he wouldn't budge on one of them that show me had the wrong spirit and then god vindicated months later that i was right and he was wrong god vindicated god always backs up his word so that's an example where i had jealousy over a church amen godly jealousy praise god god used me to move in that church and start that church i'm standing up for that church by god's grace but i fear lest by any means as the serpent begotten he through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in christ so paul said the church got deceived just like eve got deceived with a little lie just a little lie through the whole church off that's why church when they make statements about brother branham and exalt brother brandon or exalt themselves even a little bit that's wrong the holy ghost will not do that not even a little bit he will not share his glory with another amen verse 4 fred he if he that cometh preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or if he received another spirit when we've not received an or another gospel which he have not accepted he might bear with him look he's saying when when people preach false doctrines you bear with them you shouldn't bear with them right for i suppose i was now look at this i was not a whip behind the very cheapest apostles now look he's starting to boast nice not not in the evil way but he's starting to tell them the real things about his ministry i am not at least wit i'm nothing behind the very cheapest apostles which would be peter right james john bartholomew all these mighty men of god he said i'm not even the least behind them now later he says i labored more than all but earlier in the other level he said i labored more than all but these people are so blind to see if he said i've got if you're they're going to accept braggers i've got to tell you exactly what god's had me do in my life i'm going to testify here for a minute now look at verse 6 though i be rude in speech so see he wasn't a simple person in speech the other guys were way more eloquent eloquent there it is i forgot i feel like paul i'm on paul's side how they do so the other guys the false apostles were they talked way better they preached way better but he said i'm not i'm just simple in my life am i preaching i'm just simple yet not in knowledge yeah i know the word of god i preach simple but i know the word of god amen but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things have i committed an offense and abasing myself that ye might be exalted see because i preached to you the gospel of god freely so he asked them is the reason you're against me is because i don't take money from you because they're used to these preachers pulling on them for money look at that verse eight he said i robbed other churches taking ways to them to do you service of course it doesn't mean robbed but what he means is that the other church who gave me the blessings they were already poor to begin with so it was like robbing them they were already poor it was the it was the philippian church because he says it later the macedonian church we preached on that you know years ago a couple years ago and when i was present with you and wanted i was charged with no man paul would not take anything from any man see he wouldn't tell him i'm hungry he wouldn't tell him i'm thirsty he wouldn't tell him i need new clothes he was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brother which came from macedonia supplied so in other words if you really remain humble and trusting god god will provide for you amen you might just suffer you might have to wait but god will provide amen and in all these things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you so i will keep myself see a real christian doesn't want to be a burden on other people a real christian wants to serve other people amen see verse 10 as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of my chao wherefore because i love you not god knoweth no because i love you he said i did all this i love you and show you what a real apostle a real preacher is verse 12 but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them that desire occasion so i'm just going to start listing things so they can say nothing against me right no occasion against me that where in their glory they may be found even as we for such are no look what he calls these scriptures that are receiving false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves and the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light so anyone that would speak against paul he says was a uh was a satanic preacher right was a false apostle and anyone who changes the gospel of paul today is a false preacher that's right unless they're ignorant or they got a complex let me give a let me give some more grace because i'm not perfect i make mistakes so either a false apostle or they they're ignorant they don't know about scriptures or quotes yet uh or they got a complex yep that's the third one verse 15. there therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end should be according to their work so watch their works watch their doctrines verse 16. i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me then i may boast myself a little so you see i'm being sarcastic i'm bragging here just so you under you'll listen to me he's the one that started the church that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting so see the lord didn't tell me do this i'm just trying to boast so you'll listen to me because that's what you always receive you receive boasting and you receive other gospels and i'm jealous over you that you left the simplicity that is in christ verse 18 seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also so these false preachers were preaching fleshly lust so money easy living right prosperity they were preaching fleshly things fleshly blessings all the time verse 19 for ye suffer fools gladly seeing you receive seeing you you yourselves your wives at church that's what i've seen when when when these some of these false preachers they go to churches and i hear people amen like i just get really some holy indignation right the spirit of god stirs up with me how can these people receive it the lies but you know what jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the same spirits that were in paul's day are here today amen people love to have their ears tickled yes now i want to raise your faith too i don't appreciate how to raise your faith at the same time if there's sin in the camp we gotta cut it out praise god it's not to exalt our flesh but they gladly receive false preachers anything that makes them feel good they'll receive it for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage they won't suffer they will allow a man to bring them into bondage to sins if a man devour you if a man take you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face they'll allow preachers to bat the preachers to bash the congregation just disrespect the congregation and they'll gladly receive it it's true it's true i mean you see the the the million dollar million televangelists they do that all the time they bash the people they mock the people like oh you didn't hear me i'm going to say that again maybe they're just praying about it maybe you said something wrong see they exalt themselves and the but the false people they love to have it so they love lies just give me the fleshy desires that i desire just tell me that's okay to have those fleshy desires i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak how be it wherever and he is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also so he's making himself foolish he's boasting on himself to prove a point now look verse 22 here's what they were bragging on are they hebrews so am i they were oh we're jews so now we know so they were claiming oh we're closer to jesus because we're jews they're playing the race card now today be oh i'm better because i'm an american i'm from brother branham's uh home country or i'm in brother and his family or i met brother branham yeah something like that to exalt themselves as greater than you just by something carnal something fleshly see are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i see they were bragging all these things look i'm a jew i'm a seed of abraham mother see you should listen to me not paul are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in labor's more abundant in prisons above measure i'm sorry stripes above measure in prisons more frequently and deaths off i'm going to put a picture up here this was a man during the 1800s for slavery this i've seen this picture in high school over 20 years ago and this picture has never left my mind whenever i think of slavery my mind goes right there this is what the masters would do to them now with this in mind read the scripture verse 24 of the jews five times received by 40 stripes save one that's 195 lashes jesus got 39. in the church said paul though got 195. now i read i was listening to preachers and historians they were saying many people many uh uh many prisoners died on the first whipping because they lost so much blood so paul's skin must have been so hard or whatever that he got with the first time it looked like that or maybe worse because remember again you put your hands up like that and they would whip you from the side so the uh the cat of nine tails would would would dig into your skin and then they would rip it five times most people would die the first time but he would get one he'd heal can you imagine going back what would the scars i mean those are awful scars but i would imagine that's probably something like paul had if not more paul probably had it everywhere shoulders arms he probably had this whole thing i think that's branding i'm not sure five times and paul's trying to he's trying to get them to see i'm a real minister of christ i'm not preaching the desires of the flesh i'm preaching the desires of the holy spirit amen i'm a true apostle a true preacher he went to prison often he said these guys never go to prison right these guys don't suffer these guys are accepted by everybody i'm not see thrice i was beaten with rods three times being with rods once i was stoned now the preacher had a good point jobs isn't a preacher preach on this jews stone people often if you blasphemed as a child you could be stoned if you disrespected your parents you could be stoned remember they came to jesus let's stone this woman call it adultery but they didn't bring the man so he discerned their spirit there's a wicked spirit right they knew how to stone people they stoned paul and lystra if i'm not mistaken they thought he was dead they left he was lying they're dead what seemed to be dead and then all of a sudden he gets up out of the stones can you imagine bashing someone watching someone bash with a stone they lying there still and all of a sudden get up and they're fine god was protecting this man he's trying to let these corinthians know i'm not a false preacher i'm a genuine preacher in other words god's power is working mighty in me amen thrice i was shipwrecked now and then this according to history this wasn't the one in acts 28. so now he's shipwrecked four times and he spent a whole day and night floating on a piece of wood waiting for someone to rescue him that's courage church that's courage a night the day i've been in the deep there it is verse 26 in journeys often in perils and waters in perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by the heathen and perils in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness and watching is often in hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches so not only do i have all these problems but then i worry and i'm always burdened about all the churches and all their needs that they have so i'm suffering physically but i also have this spiritual burden for all the needs that i know are in other churches hungry sick afflicted persecuted that's right just like me in prison whipped there's a real man of god with the mighty power of god he said it works in me mightily yes yes yes see when god's word power is working in you you can fast you can pray praise god you can have burdens on your heart for other people amen amen that's why i had to repent today church and say lord i'm sorry when i saw this and i saw this 195 times i said lord forgive me for complaining about inflation forgive me for complaining i have no hardships compared to this my life is a cakewalk compared to this so i said god forgive me i shouldn't i shouldn't verse 29 who is weak and i am not weak see these brothers are all strong they talk about how strong they are who's the weak one i am who is offended and i burn not see they don't get offended everybody loves them everybody receives them but i'm the one who offends all the time and i get offended if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities so it's a great difference the true preachers have suffering infirmity trials the false preachers did not everybody loved them they easily deceived people they they smote them on the face you know they they gave them fleshly desires it was clear to paul who was the real preacher he said i'll glory in my infirmities verse 31 the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed by mark knoweth that i lie not he didn't lie about 195 whips he didn't live up and that's why glory that's why i can say later i bear in my body the marks of jesus christ he can take the shirt off for the brothers and say i have the marks jesus has branded me on his i'm his i've suffered for his name's sake i'm a chosen vessel glory to go to the gentiles hallelujah and he works in me mightily praise god may god work in us mightily i know it's a different age this is not the light age this is not the ox age this is the eagle age but we should still have the same spirit we should still have a feeling for the body of christ that's right and christians are being killed today in nigeria iraq iran uh some of the other ones china saudi arabia christians are being killed persecuted what's the other one i'm trying to think of you know they could get it pakistan pakistan nigeria oh yeah nigeria is awful it's probably the worst place in the world right now to be a christian bombing killing just mobs killing christians catholic anybody anybody in church we know god sees them we know god sees the martyrs whether wise or foolish virgin god sees them look in verse 32 look how he embarrasses himself in damascus the governor under eretas the king kept the city of damascus damascenes with a garrison desires to apprehend me so they set up a garrison they set up like an outpost in order to capture me they wanted to get me so bad verse 33 and through a window in a basket i was let down a wall like a baby right you put a baby in a basket you put groceries in a basket paul said i'm embarrassing myself i was i didn't go out and fight the garrison i didn't go uh i didn't make the garrison fall down their faces with a miracle i was let down like a little child in the basket i in other words i jumped out the back window this is a proof that i'm a real minister of christ not the guys that everybody accepts and claps for and stands up the guys that get rich and tell you you can live in the flesh you desires he said those are ministers of the devil what about today church yeah we know the ones outside the message we know them they're clearly ministers of the devil preaching the prosperity gospel but doesn't it work in the message ranks as well it sure does sure does i was let down by the wall and escaped his hands remember i read this on sunday we are troubled on every side yet we're not distressed so despite being whipped like that he would not be he would not feel forsaken can you imagine that he said we're perplexed but not in despair i've been with i've been whipped five times but i'm still not in despair i haven't given up my goodness i'm persecuted but i'm not forsaken i wonder if the angel lord would come and minister to paul after his whippings like jesus like the angel came to minister to jesus after his prayers i wonder how could you withstand a fifth time how could you withstand the second time the third time the fourth time the fifth time how could you withstand that except the power of god was with you i was persecuted but not forsaken i was cast down but not destroyed praise god hollywood so church no matter what we go through no matter the troubles that we go through we're not destroyed we're not forsaken he's still with us it's god working in us mightily to produce a character that christ is looking for hallelujah let me go to david here i'm not going to go too long here tonight i don't think so now we looked at these uh remember the mighty man scriptures on sunday you had a couple people listening to the sermons that they really liked among us i was like well praise the lord hallelujah yeah that's what i was embarrassed i was freaked out being a mighty man the next day i'm complaining about inflation a mighty man don't complain about inflation right i laugh but i'm ashamed of myself i'm not gonna complain about it i'm going to face it like a man right you know what a man i'm supposed to do if i get off maokai you remind me okay you hear me complaining remind me mighty men do not complain they stand up and fight remember the scripture you read watchy stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all things be done with charity now i want to apply this to david's life because i want to just go back to david for a few moments here i was thinking about mighty men and what's going through my notes today which direction should i go should i go to the colossians and i just kind of got in this thought i really like this thought i want to just go through this here so david i want i want to show you this thought david was mighty before he even slew goliath church you can be mighty we can be mighty before the giant even comes down way before you can be mighty before this great obstacle your life that you were born to do you're born to overcome this trial born to defeat that uh the addictions or whatever more whatever you were born to do you can be mighty way before that as a teenager as a little child you can write letters to adults that's mighty in the scriptures praise god help them to overcome their addictions and the demons in their life you can do that as a child that's right i can pray to the walls come down until there's healing all around that's something i can do that's something we all can do so how did david become mighty as a teenager or as a boy he had to watch didn't paul say watch watchy now that he means everybody watch ye so everybody needs to watch everybody needs to watch but david would watch and protect the sheep okay so he was being a man he was learning how to be a mighty man a mighty man doesn't get your eyes off the value of the treasure a mighty man watches the treasure that's right right that's why jesus said i am not a hiring preacher i'm not a hiring shepherd i care about the sheep i stay with the sheep i'm not with the sheep just for money i'm with the sheep because i love them praise god that's what david had to learn a real man a mighty man watches over and protects his sheep that's what a real man does right [Music] david had to stand fast he had to be faithful he had to stand there now we know the story brother said some shepherds they actually slept in the gate of the sheepfold they became the gate they became the door and jesus said i am the door praise god they had to stand fast and then lay down you know at the night time to keep it all the sheep and the sheep fold and i've never seen that myself my brother makes it alluding to it he's seen it when he went overseas but you have to stand fast you have to watch and stand now what if you stand and close your eyes and try to fall asleep leaning up against a building you haven't done all right to do all you've got to watch and you've got to stand that's right stan means you're alert ready to go sitting down means you're resting or relaxing when america means you're working at a desk right on a computer but real work is standing and watching amen according to the bible with faithful shepherds like a shepherd work he said be brave he was brave because he would go rescue the sheep right he was strolling because he would not only be brave enough to go after them but he was strong enough to fight and win praise god amen hallelujah strong enough to slay a lion and a bear and the bible said do all things in love so that's when he would love his express his love to god by playing the heart amen hallelujah praise god the mighty man that all that trained all the other mighty man praise god this is how he became mighty all by himself watching the sheep look church he didn't have his dad to help him there right right it's nice to have your dad in church today but i don't have my dad here so we can all we can all be mighty praise god it's an extra blessing for you guys he didn't have his dad there all alone but he did have his dad there from heaven he did have his heavenly father with him praise god so where'd he get all of his might from his heavenly father trusting in god that's how you become a mighty man you watch you stand you're brave you're strong you do everything in love that's how a man becomes mighty he became mighty as a humble shepherd so no matter how humble your life is no matter how humble your job is no matter how humble your home is no matter how humble your car is or humble your bank account is it doesn't matter how humble or we say worthless your life seems god can still make you mighty you can still learn the spiritual lessons you need to learn to be strong in the lord and what he knew he went from glory to glory he went from mighty to being more mighty i wonder which one came first the lion or the bear barbados he was real nervous that first time right the first time he saw a line carry away to bite one of those sheep and carried away to go chase after a running lion but why do it because he did all things in love he loved that little sheep praise god hallelujah he'd do it but then after that victory the anointing was on him you know he was oh and this whole time he's already anointed king praise god part of this time he's anointed king yeah he he could he could he could have complained and said i'm the forgotten king i was anointed but now they forgot about me i thought i was supposed to be king well not when you want to be when god wants you to be i thought god was going to do miracles in the message he is but not when you want to do it when he wants to do it right praise god hey if i could do it like my man said if i could heal him i would if i could do a miracle i would but i'm not the one who does them you're not the one who does them it's jesus christ that doesn't matter we have all these promises but it's in god's good time hallelujah that's right but each day we can still go from glory to glory by doing our regular duties that god has called us to do and be faithful in them that's right faithful though different kind of mighty it's not the ra rat come on james come on you can slay giants oh this is how i get mighty and oh i can be mighty when i suffer yeah that's exactly right that's exactly right be mighty as we suffer mighty in the lord's strength like paul said um like he said i'm misquoting this but he says i die daily no that's a scripture but uh he said i and i always show the dying of the death of the lord in my body that the life of christ might be manifest in me every day where you die to yourself every day where you rest the lord i don't want to give this up but help me to give it up and then when you finally give it up that's god's mighty power praise god hallelujah amen you go from glory to glory from might to mormont just to hum your humble life first we should all be able to raise your hand and say i got a humble life so i know god can make me mighty amen which one of us are great ones which one of us are ceos with 10 billion or million people following us on instagram or twitter right none of us we're just humble people and so we are the candidates amen we're the ones god can use praise god if we'll let him teach us daily how to humble ourselves overcome our trials overcome our battles let him work in us mightily and accomplish all he wants to accomplish in this generation praise god he might call you to a hole in the wall church but you still have people come up and get repent and weep their way to calvary there he might call you to a nice bigger church he might call you to ren out of baptist church he might call you to lots of different things by going back to the home church amen have a church in somebody's house he might call you that it's so humble but yet god is in the midst of that praise god amen god was rejecting glory while dave was out there uh of feeding the sheep god was rejected by all those strong brothers that he had out there in the army they were all fearful but dave was getting faith built into him in his humble life praise god so can we praise god in our humble lives god can raise faith in our lives for to do great days praise god when everybody else is afraid amen glory now we see this idea here eliab the oldest of david's brothers number one he was number eight but his number one heard he spake under the man and eliav's anger was kind of against david said why came us down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness he rebukes him for his humble lifestyle but that was this but he'd already been anointed king see david had to remember i'm already anoint the king i'm already anointed he don't recognize it he was there he must have forgotten it praise god but he was there when i was annoyed today man yeah and then look he's badgering him oh you just got a few sheep little did he know he god was going to make him ruler over millions of people at that moment he just had a few but god said i see a heart in him i see a man after my own heart praise god and i'm going to take those few that he's favored with and i'm gonna make him ruler over millions of people that's right but elia couldn't see he was so so tall and handsome and so strong and taller than all the other men he couldn't see it he was so exalted in pride i know that pride and the naughtiness of that heart so the prideful one is accusing him of being prideful see that turtle that's why i know when these preachers accuse me i know that's actually the spirit on them that's right man right yeah yeah whatever they accuse me of that's exactly what exactly what their guilt is right they accused me of not believing the prophet they're the ones who don't believe the prophet because the prophet said the greatest preachers were the philadelphian preachers that's what the prophet said if you want to say what the tapes say i don't want to get into my my trials okay i know your pride noises are come down to the mighty see the battle oh you just want to be a big shot now i come down here by the anointing of god amen i love what john gill says he's a preacher from the 1800 from the man age the best preachers the raps are the best writers i know that pride hardiness of heart he was too proud to keep the sheep that's what he was being accused of and wanted to advance himself in the army and make a figure there and thereby gratify his vanity which was the reverse of actually david's character so that's what satan will always do he'll always tell you well your real character is like this and it's a total lie right eliat was totally lying he was totally misjudging your character amen thank god thank got that you know your true character praise god man i'm with me all the time austin so i know my true character praise god when nobody else is watching when nobody else is listening nobody's there it's just god and i i know my real character praise god the devil's trying to tell me i don't have a good character but i know my character i was there when i got saved i was there i got the holy ghost and god is with me at all times and god sees how i act when i'm all alone praise god amen same thing with david though somebody accuse you of something well i know how i live i'm i'm not here for my own glory we have to we have to so know god's heart and our character that we can overcome criticism about our character amen like i'll get back to me i know i don't take money on youtube i could monetize my videos and make a few thousand i've never asked for one life you always say give me a like subscribe i've never asked for one subscriber i know my character brother william amen i don't want their money i've only said share it if you feel led of the lord that's right that's all i've said hallelujah i know my character let the devil say whatever he wants yeah i love jesus amen i'm not just for money i'm in this anointing or to annoy other people yeah with the holy spirit praise god that god would anoint them see the devil will tell you that actually the opposite of your real character for such was his humility that though he was anointed look at this he was already anointed king he'd been for he was preferred and saw score saw love when david come to the the castle the palace because he get on the harp he started playing he sing like austin you know he sing like us standing in the fire and the holy and the holy spirit would anoint saul and the evil spirit would leave he was loved by the king rejected by his dad right he was anointed by the prophet that's right but yet when he wasn't needed he would just condescend go back to his humble lifestyle this is how you become mighty church right here whatever people need you you help them and afterwards you go right back to doing your regular routine i don't care how much anointing is on you dave if anybody's anointed more than us friday now i'm not talking about the soul now i'm not about the body the human spirit he had literal oil poured out and praise god to represent the holy ghost that was on him that's right to slay a lion in a bear which of us have done that none of us have done that right so you gotta get more anointing on his flesh than we have yeah that's how you know real character whenever someone wants to use me sure i'll help you out praise god and then when they're done god bless you let me go back to shower come on go back to my humble life let me go back to my prayer time with the lord i love what donnie reagan said one time he said he said i go into my prayer closet he said lord i'm coming to you to pray and he said this is your my time this is our time lord i love that amen father and son time amen there it is david we have our father and sometimes we go to talk about what's our time to talk and on the drive home you know we'll talk about different things you see your prayer life is father and daughter time praise god that's right all right father and son time you just go right back to humble life i don't know if you're nothing special i just mean i just want to see what god wants me to be very good but really church you are something special amen when you're a christian you are the most special people on earth amen don't forget remember he called you beloved he said you're not beloved so don't act like you're special but remember you are just act humble act humble condescend don't answer yourself humble yourself remember that in god's eyes you are beloved get all this anointing it was loved by the king yeah when he wasn't needed where's my sheep where's my where's my little lambs let me just pet them a little bit let me play with him a little bit he was ready to go back and start watching after the sheep start singing and praising the lord he just sit out there and praise all with his rhyme staff you know comforted him hallelujah that's how i become mighty and god want to use him he's right there when god was done using him in that public manner he come right back praise god i'll come back to cooking supper at the house here god bless me at church i got a good miracle i got a good shot i got a good cry at church go back and feed the kids now i'm going to go back and sweep the kitchen amen i did it today my wife says you always preach she says you'll do something at home and then you got something to preach out like i just want to encourage the people you know she's just joking with me we just gotta joke around oh i changed the diaper today i'll make sure i tell the church just because i want you to know i'm human and i try to help out my family that's why i tell it and we just laugh about it it's not preaching material i do it because i love my family like i told brother austin people have given people have donated tens of thousands of dollars to fix my house you'd be shocked if i told you the number how can i not take care of it when god's blessed me somebody tens of thousands of free dollars in labor how can i not give thanks to god for it and try to take care of it a little bit see he had now purpose now that he was not it was it was not any bad principle in his heart to go against goliath but purely for the glory of god how can this man defy the armies of the living god and the honor of the people of israel who were both reproached they were being cursed at every day 40 days straight curse you i curse you he's like who's going to stand up to this demon here who's going to stand up to this wicked man uncircumcised philistine no covenant with abraham doesn't even know the god of abraham yet the god of abraham has brought us to the promised land through moses and joshua praise god he was mighty hallelujah god made almighty the church these are the this is the picture of modern day israel i was watching some videos they went to the place where david probably was around bethlehem a church this is what it looks like a certain time of year anybody see green pastures out there yet he write that song you lead me beside green pastures you leave me besides still ours but was it all green pastures what was it a prosperity gospel dave was thinking about it no looks pretty sparse if you ask me would you want your sheep to eat all that you know all those all those weeds and thorns that's the life of a shepherd there yeah just go be with your few sheep that's fine i'm going to have a worship service out there i'm going to worship the lord with my sheep out there i'm going to humble myself and condescend and just be what god made me to be amen i don't have to be anybody special i'll just be who god may be to be amen i'll just be out there with the dirty sheep church never been outside with dirty animals i don't even like really petting my cat too much because he lives outside i get that hair all over me and then he's got he gets like little stickers in his fur he kind of smells bad he's been outside you know these sheep were outside all the time they were dirty right dirty stinky with all their waste right stepping in it all running around bloody when they have babies this was not a glamorous job if i got a good tan like you and you being outside first they have the long robes on to protect their skin this was not a glamorous job he didn't have facebook where he could go hey how you doing man kind of get his mind off the sheep you know right he didn't he couldn't text his friends you know he could just text god just call god on the scene amen amen that's how god makes you mighty yeah dirty bloody stinky common humble this is how god raises up mighty men and women the daily the daily chores the daily uh assignments that god gives us praise god he's just daily routine things now thank god sometimes you're going to have green pastures back in springtime early summer once fall hits trees start changing colors but he would sing about oh you leave me by still waters you leave me by my green pastures you restore my soul the lord is my shepherd i shall not lack i have everything that i need praise god out there and i look at yours he's got no friends other than animals and yet he says i don't lack any friends and the church said amen hallelujah like the the meetings that i had with the minister he's like hey i heard you he said you do dates with your wife he said can we join you and have a double date he said because we don't have any friends isn't that something i said sure brother you can join us man sometimes i feel like that too you know when i'm out but i'm not a church sometimes i feel like i don't have any friends you know it's okay i got my family but you know sometimes you just want to sit down across the table from somebody and how's your life going you know you just don't want any distractions like you just wish you could have some fellowship now david didn't have that benefit of that i don't know we don't know how long he come in home we don't know how where he slept all the time but most of his time was spent alone with god and this is how he grew mighty beside your mighty saul said you're not able to go against this philistine fighter for thou art but a youth and a man of and he a man of war from his youth and david said saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he rose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him there must be a certain spot you can hit on the line when you got him by the main i don't know brother there must be a certain spot you can hit to knock him out maybe it's poking him in the eye i don't know there must be something you can do because he was able to grab him smite him hit him and then kill him he said i'm not afraid of that i've i've defeated beasts i'm not afraid of this man thy servants through both the lion and the bear this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them singing at the five the army's living god now made a big difference he was a prophet so god showed him he was already gonna smile and praise god that makes a big difference like jesus said uh lord i know you hear me always and jesus and god show jesus that lazarus was coming out praise god amen it makes a big difference when you got that when you got a revelation but yours that's what we need we need to pray to god so we get a revelation amen amen do we know we're going to get the victory or i just feel god's going to answer this prayer that's when we can have confidence that's when faith drops down that's when faith moves mountains praise when it drops down hallelujah and we know god's going to move amen amen on our behalf david said moreover the lord that delivered over the self-existent one right there the self-existent one that delivered me out of the paul of the lion and the other paul the bear he would deliver me out of the hand of the philistine and saul said david go the lord be with thee amen and dave was like the lord's been with me since i got anointed all right he's been with me praise god he's not with me because you blessed me he's with me because god called me praise god he anointed me years ago now remember church after he defeated him saul said who is this ruddy guy he forgot that this was the guy that played the harp and got and cast devils off him he forgot the real preachers right he forgot the real man of god he got so caught up in things so high mighty he forgot god's deliverer that had already been sent to him he was so he was there it is he's so bad he was so bound by fear of goliath he was so bound by fear he's in other words he's in bondage again there it is he got free of bondage and then he went back into bondage and he forgot that god was a deliverer he forgot this guy's already delivered this guy's already oh deliver me from my evil spirit ma go and the lord be with thee now one thing i just thought of this is just my thought but david knew israel's history david would have known shamgar one of the judges took an ox goad and defeated 600 philistines well god was with that guy and god has anointed me to be king and i'm going to be king and this one not 600 one is standing in my life surely god will help me to beat this law and praise god if god [Applause] have already been slain what about yeah i even forgot about samson hallelujah samson got a thousand at one time praise god sixteen hundred if god can defeat sixteen hundred by two surely he can defeat one giant by a little humble shepherd because god loves to receive all the glory and god is the man of war praise god amen amen he just needs people surrendered in the battle that's right surrender to his holy spirit how many feel my more bodies we go on here amen god's grace he remembered joshua's words joshua said i'm going to skip because for a time he said cleave unto the lord these are joshua's second to last words his last words are in joshua 24. he said be courageous do all the word of god don't turn the left or the right i'm just breezing over these we're hitting the highlights do not be among the nations that remain among you don't make mention of their god see goliath was cursing him by his god and the bible said don't even mention their gods right and that's exactly what david did david said i don't come to you with sort of spirit i come in the name of the lord of hosts hallelujah don't bow down to them but cleave unto the lord your god as you've done this day for the lord i've driven out from before you these great nations and strong no man has been able to stand before you this day one man of you shall call will chase a thousand for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he has promised you take good he therefore unto yourselves that you love the lord your god amen remember that or that scripture paul said the last thing he said was do everything in love you strong men and women praise god amen just love god love the word love the message love the truth love the bible and god will fight for you praise god amen he'll try not your enemies praise god just love god amen just keep his commandments and love the lord your god and god will do a mighty work in our ministry [Applause] amen not mighty to the world but mighty to god standards amen praise god [Music] i got more emails this week saying oh your your videos and you've got a gift of god and your videos are changing people all around the world he said you've inspired me these preachers said you inspired me see i just take those things i say well praise the lord now god and i just go right back to my shepherd and praise god all right you hear the year the good things you just go right back to your humble life just keep serving god just stay in the daily dirty you're the daily grind the daily mess just keep serving god love god in the midst of your daily trials amen the bible said cleave to him be glued to his word praise god like that sword glue it to your hand amen don't let nothing take the sword out of your hand praise god one of you should have chased a thousand so david even had this scripture right there there you go one will whip a thousand surely i want one on one what are my odds with one on one if i can whip a thousand yeah i can whip one according to the bible all the odds were on david's side but that's not what man saw man saw what man sees david saw what god sees praise god david saw the promise of god the other soldiers just saw the actual numbers they saw the natural things david was looking at spiritual things praise god may god help us look at spiritual things amen look at the spiritual battles going on that's right what's the spiritual odds for us praise god i think they're pretty good don't you i think we've got good spiritual odds by god's grace we're more than conquerors in christ jesus be zealous therefore and repent and the bible says the church at laodicea if you're zealous and repent you'll be overcomers and then you'll sit with jesus on his throat as jesus sits on his father's throne praise god in other words god is finding character today that can judge right wrong praise god yes amen that's what he's looking for let us see as someone who can repent constantly and then judge the right decision keep their testimony hot and on fire for jesus and if they do that if they reign in this life he'll make them reign in the next life amen amen as he has promised you amen that's god's promise those are red letter words churches that right yeah red letter words i'm going to close this he that's faithful with the few sheep will be faithful with many millions of seconds that's right amen just be faithful with a few sheep amen you know what jesus said he that's faithful in that which is least what could be any lower than a shepherd nothing could be lower than a shepherd other than like a sinful thing like a harlot or a beggar or you know something some type of evil man like a murderer you know some type of evil thing like that but just as the regular jobs nothing could be lower than a show there's no fame in that because your only congregation is sheep your only fans are sheep and they don't give thumbs up on instagram right they don't give likes on youtube they're just sheep but you're if you're faithful in the least of things of life then he'll make you as the bible says he'll make you he will commit to you the true riches the world has it all wrong about what's true riches it's not money right it's not your riches it's not it's far from it because that's what that's what they want they want unread unrighteous mammon which means money if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous money who will commit to you trust the true witches so he's telling us we should be faithful with our money right but if you're faithful with the little god has given you he will trust you with true riches and if you have not been faithful which is another man so if you can't work for a boss and you can't be faithful who shall give you that which is your own how are you going to get any blessings if you can't even handle somebody else's blessings that's what joseph had to do josh had to serve under potiphar right and then pharaoh and then he got exhausted right potiphar then he was faithful to prison to the butler baker he's exalted praise god amen god help us to be faithful in the least and then he'll come he'll accomplish let me say true riches in his time and season amen joseph true riches were saving the entire world from starvation east was sent to egypt to save life praise god that's right amen amen david got true riches not just feet and sheep come on here see there's some good water there's some good uh there's a good good grass and waters over here but now he's actually leading israel into battle and helping them conquer their enemies making them free they're no longer slaves to the philistines amen he's setting people free that's true riches amen freedom in the natural freedom and the spiritual and god said i'm giving you true riches david praise god amen because you are faithful with a few sheep i'm giving you true riches making free the souls of men amen can be fake with a few soulless sheep you'll be ruler over millions of souls that are worth ten thousand worlds apiece right because david's souls were ten thousand of the jew of the israelite souls that one soul was worth that many other ones because he was a man after god's own heart amen how many want to be faithful in church the beautiful thing about this anybody can do it that's the love about the gospel anybody can be faithful with a little and then any everybody they could have true riches in heaven and even true riches on this earth you know the rich young ruler came running to jesus he said i've kept all these commandments then jesus beholding him loved him and said one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven in other words forsake your worldly job and come be a full-time preacher with me come be an apostle with me amen and i don't have a place to lay my head you're not going to have one you're not going to have the same pillow every night it's going to be a different pillow and some nights you won't have pillows he said foxes have holes birds have nests the son of man has no place to lay his head come follow me then you'll have great treasure in heaven i'm not asking you to sell your home i would never do that you got to have a home god bless you with a home yeah but i i am asking you to consider how can i give and how can i live for others to inherit true treasure in heaven that's right yeah that's right how can i do that i love the word of god it makes me happy i'm just happy i'm smiling amen because i i in my humble life i can still become mighty because i don't have to be a great person i can just be a humble person and each day god can teach me to humble myself build up my faith as we said last weekend build up that those tension moves as the tension builds up the power builds up right so i hope the tension has been building up for a few months here so when cam comes here we can have a the power can be released god amen i'm thankful for the time you know i know the holy spirit's been poured out on us numerous times when i've been preaching i love it god answers prayer we feel the presence of god we weep or we shout or something like that cry but i feel like we've been you know this tension's been building up and so it's time to release the power of god to release upon us praise god amen hey that's what i'm asking god for praise god see i'm asking us to look at what is true with riches in this case he was called not everybody's called to do it he was called to sell all his great possessions help the poor and then become a full-time missionary but then the bible said he turned and walked away sad because he had great possessions he wanted mammon more than true riches true riches would have been walking next to the son of god imagine watching the son of god be miracle after miracle watch this on a man teach the people watch the son of man put children on his left and teach the adult this is how you come in the kingdom of god walk on water but my goodness curse fig trees raise the dead praise god money was greater than following the son of god he missed out on true riches let's not miss out on true riches amen we have service after service year thank god thank god month after month year after year we have all this time to really understand what true riches are it's giving up your worldly desires and accepting the life the humble life that god has for you amen god reminded david where he brought him from and that's what god is doing tonight god's remembering god's reminding us where we came from so go to second uh samuel 7 verse 8. remember the story david starts he's king now both of uh judah and northern israel he starts whipping all his enemies nathan goes and says do all that's in your heart david and the prophet made a mistake because few prophets make mistakes yeah not with us say the lord but they make human mistakes which jeffersonville says prophets make no mistakes which they're taking quotes out of context there's a quote that says that but they're taken out of context it means they'll say the lord's statements they only like the quotes they like but i like all the quotes because we can rightly divide it by the holy spirit that's true and they can't they'll just say well i don't know i just leave everything on the team no you don't and i got a quote brother says that he said your actions prove you don't believe me amen he said you believe everything on the tape your actions prove you don't i want my actions to prove that i believe the tapes amen not just my words i just press play i don't know i just press play i believe everything on that's a lie my actions prove i believe because i'm able to labor in the word and take it back to the word of god amen search the scriptures daily whether those things are so that the prophet said that's right that's right that's right most people can't do that because they're lazy or whatever uh what riches of the world they want popularity fame that's fine they can do whatever they want i'm gonna accept god's humble life that he gave me amen second samuel 7 verse 8 remember the story now therefore so shalt thou say to my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheep co i took you from that humble smelly bloody and church you know with animals it's constant trouble constant trouble like we went to that that pennsylvania farm this summer and every day something bad happened with those animals some would get out someone headbutt us right i mean every day something happens so dave was in constant trials oh man we just had peace for five minutes and now the sheep are confusing again you know constant trials he said thus saith the lord remind david i took you from that humble place of being a shepherd from following the sheep you were they're supposed to be following you but you said you found them look at that to be ruler over my people israel and i was with you i love that church god is with you whatever thou went and have called all thy enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like under the name of the great men that are in the earth that church what does david do i just want to close with this if you go down to verse uh i didn't really write that one down i was planning on reading this whole chapter but i didn't get time to do that yeah verse 26 he says now that you kept your word he said and let thy name be magnified forever saying the lord of hosts is the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david be established forever for thou o lord of hosts god of israel has revealed to thy servant saying i will build thee in the house therefore have thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true and now has promised this goodness unto thy sermon let there i'm sorry therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy sermon that they may continue forever before thee for thou o lord god has spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed forever praise god so after god reminds him of his humble beginning this is i mean he'd been out of the sheets the sheepfold for a long time but god reminds him you i brought you from the sheepfold in other words he returns back to god and said praise god your name is magnified amen i remember where i came from i remember my humble be beginnings and i'm bringing praise and mag and magnifying your name i'm bringing praise back to your great name and he said do what you promised bless my house and then with all this anointing goes and whips the philistines the moabites and the syrians and then he says let me find someone someone from jonathan's family let me bless them and he blesses mephibosheth praise god in other words when god reminds you of where he brought you and you see all the blessings and you see how god has made you a believer a real believer you'll go and you'll find the battles greater you'll have more strength when you remember god's grace you'll praise god more when you remember where god brought you from church amen and you want to bless other people who can i bless who can i be a a help to because god has blessed me so much god's taken me from the lowest of the low and he's raised me up on high just as he promised if i humble myself i'll be exalted praise god amen amen let's take our feet praise god hallelujah thank you jesus went a little longer than i thought but praise god i hope it was a blessing tonight and amen how many grateful for the humble life god's called you to amen let's be thankful for god's grace musicians can come and i heard a video it said shepherding is the one occupation from the bible times that hasn't changed a bit in other words shepherds still got the same humble life through the same menial task the hard task dirty tire task but then when you come to the new testament the greatest man of all time jesus christ said i am the good i'm the good king he said i am the good shepherd right i'm the great caesar is that what he said all right he said i am the good shepherd because i give my life for the sheep see who are you giving your life for now our moms and dads they got they got it's built into their life thank god we are to give our lives for our children to make their lives better spiritually praise god we don't have yet children and we should pray for them right and then also live for other people praise god because that is greatness be just be faithful with whatever you have be faithful whoever be faithful rule over that reign over that in your humble ways and god will exalt you in due season amen when you're called upon go rejoice oh thank god for that testimony and go right back to serving god just as faithfully as you ever would i'll go back to my bible time and go back to having that time with the lord go back to worshiping god in my private place i'll go back to that victorious daily life hurry up to victoria's daily life amen where jesus is working in you mightily amen i tell you i've been humble this week i know jesus is working in my life mightily
