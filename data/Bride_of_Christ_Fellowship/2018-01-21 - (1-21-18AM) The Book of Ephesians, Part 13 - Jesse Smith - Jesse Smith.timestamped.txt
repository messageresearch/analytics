[34:12] God is so merciful praise the Lord so
[34:15] grateful for all that God is doing amen
[34:21] visions chapter 4 this morning like to
[34:25] look at taking captivity captive by
[34:30] God's grace I don't know if you've ever
[34:31] read where this comes from I don't know
[34:33] Paul is actually quoting David in the
[34:36] Psalms but I'm not sure if you've ever
[34:39] i've never preached on it so it was
[34:42] fresh to me new to me but i start in
[34:44] ephesians 4 and then this evening i like
[34:46] to preach on continue the series on
[34:48] modesty makeup clothing and all those
[34:50] things i think tonight we'll look at
[34:53] Christian liberties there's certain
[34:55] Christian liberties the Bible gives us
[34:57] I'd like to teach through that by God's
[34:59] grace tonight by God's Spirit god bless
[35:03] you event good to see you sir praise the
[35:05] Lord amen visions 4 verse 1 now I think
[35:18] text here I'll just kind of read one two
[35:22] 13 I know it's a little bit of reading
[35:24] but this kind of reminds us where we
[35:26] were last time I think December 10th
[35:28] Lydia's birthday was the last time I
[35:30] preached on this series so it's been Lua
[35:31] but in the midst of that we finished the
[35:34] church ages so we're thankful it may do
[35:36] the Laodicean Church age well we'll just
[35:37] see how the Holy Spirit leads us seasons
[35:40] 4 verse 1 I therefore the prisoner of
[35:42] the Lord beseech you that you walk
[35:43] worthy of the vocation that's the feast
[35:46] the word vocation means feast walk
[35:50] worthy of the feast wherewith ye are
[35:52] called with all lowliness and meekness
[35:56] with long-suffering forbearing one
[35:57] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[36:00] unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
[36:03] there is one body in one spirit even as
[36:06] ye are all called in one hope of your
[36:09] calling one Lord one faith one baptism
[36:12] one God and Father of all who is above
[36:14] all and through all and in you all but
[36:19] unto every one of us is given the grace
[36:21] according to the measure of the gift of
[36:24] Christ wherefore he saith when he
[36:29] ascended up on high he led captivity
[36:30] captive and gave gifts unto men so when
[36:35] Paul is speaking about the unity of the
[36:36] Holy Spirit he actually quotes Psalm 68
[36:41] this is how it's done it's spoken of in
[36:44] Psalm 68 but verse 9 now he that
[36:48] ascended what is it but that he also
[36:50] descended first into the lower parts of
[36:52] the earth he that descended is the same
[36:55] also that ascended up far above all
[36:58] heavens that he might fill all things
[37:01] and he gave some apostles and some
[37:04] prophets and some evangelists and some
[37:06] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[37:08] of the Saints for the work of the
[37:11] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[37:14] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[37:16] the faith or the knowledge of the Son of
[37:18] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[37:20] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[37:24] amen let's bow our heads in a word of
[37:26] Prayer if anyone has a need on your
[37:27] heart again just make it known unto the
[37:28] Lord let's pray God knows every need
[37:30] father again in heaven we love
[37:32] Lord our hearts ringing with the the
[37:35] truth of the rapture we know there's a
[37:36] meeting in the air and we know you'll be
[37:38] the leading one dear God at that meeting
[37:41] Lord as Isaac did he left his home and
[37:44] came to the field so you will do that
[37:46] you'll leave your home and you'll come
[37:47] down to the airport and you will lead us
[37:50] there your God up to heaven to the
[37:52] marriage supper we're grateful Lord for

[38:04] us strength Lord God today
[38:06] help us to glean these truths from the
[38:08] scripture Lord God for Lord we know that

[38:12] and or this is what Paul preached to the
[38:15] people Lord as the scripture said

[38:20] us bring us to unity of faith grid of us
[38:23] grace with more knowledge and help us to
[38:26] grow in the measure of the stature of
[38:27] the fullness of Christ in Jesus Christ's
[38:30] name and every scent Amen God by shoes
[38:32] being seated praise the Lord
[38:40] God is good let's we have some quotes
[38:44] here we like to show and preach a little
[38:47] bit this morning by the grace of God so
[38:53] we're looking at part thirteen here by
[38:56] the grace of the Lord I hope it's been a
[38:57] blessing you know I know the church ages
[39:00] has been just a tremendous blessing for
[39:01] me and I trust this has been a blessing
[39:04] to you as well I think today it'll be a
[39:06] really it's really wonderful to go back
[39:07] and see where leading captivity captive
[39:10] came from so I think that's where I'm
[39:11] going to try to get to by the end of the
[39:13] sermon by the grace of the Lord let me
[39:15] set a timer here so I don't forget I
[39:16] don't want to wear out myself and wear
[39:18] out to people all right so we did our
[39:20] text this morning Ephesians 4 remember
[39:23] there's three themes in Ephesians we've
[39:25] we've preached through the first two
[39:26] themes which were the believers exalted
[39:28] position in Christ we preach through
[39:30] that and the one body of Christ both Jew
[39:33] and Gentile we preach through that as
[39:34] well and now we're looking at the walk
[39:36] and the wear what I'm sorry warfare of
[39:38] the believer
[39:39] praise God so we're looking today at the
[39:41] walk this is dealing with the walk we
[39:44] must be united in our walk
[39:46] now let's review just real briefly I
[39:48] just have one slide or two slides to
[39:50] review Paul begged the believers when we
[39:53] looked at this
[39:53] Paul was begging them beseech you he
[39:56] said I beg you with all lowliness so a
[39:58] deep sense of your moral littleness
[40:01] Paul's begging them please remember how
[40:03] little you are morally in other words be
[40:06] aware how easy it is for us to make a
[40:08] mistake be aware that we're still living
[40:11] in flesh bodies as much Holy Ghost as we
[40:13] say we might have or believe we have we
[40:16] must keep this body under subjection at
[40:18] all times and remember how low how
[40:22] little we are without God's help we can
[40:24] do nothing so this is what we must have
[40:28] lowliness meekness gentleness amongst
[40:30] each other long-suffering we must endure
[40:33] with each other we must hold one another
[40:35] up in love amen not knock them down
[40:38] brother BAM said you see a man knocked
[40:39] down he said help him up don't kick him
[40:40] while he's down help him up
[40:42] we should help one another out by God's
[40:44] grace endeavoring which is giving
[40:47] diligence to keep the unity the
[40:49] agreement of the Spirit in the bonds or
[40:52] bands or ligaments of peace which is
[40:55] harmony and safety no rage or havoc
[40:58] praise God to see we must have a burden
[41:01] or attention to stay united in obedience
[41:04] to the spirit and the word praise God
[41:06] every time we walk in here we must
[41:08] confess our sins before we come in here
[41:10] and make sure we have a unity of faith
[41:12] praise God and everyone's believing
[41:15] God's Word
[41:15] everyone's asking the Holy Spirit to
[41:18] flow through them praise God and let our
[41:21] hearts be unified we have one goal one
[41:23] objective that's to see Christ form in
[41:25] all of our lives amen now remember he
[41:29] said there's one baptism and I just
[41:30] thought that was the most important of
[41:31] those ones brother Graham said there's
[41:35] one faith one Lord one baptism and that
[41:37] is the baptism is a spiritual baptism
[41:38] the body's being washed it's just an
[41:41] only an illustration to give a sign that
[41:43] something inside has happened but it's
[41:45] that soul that's got to be baptized with
[41:48] the Holy Ghost amen that's eternal
[41:50] coming into that human nature and
[41:53] changing it around to make it a believer
[41:56] I pray they'll receive the Holy Spirit
[41:57] is that one Lord one faith one baptism
[41:59] that is the one baptism of the Holy
[42:02] Ghost where eternity comes down and
[42:05] dwells in your soul
[42:06] uh-huh amen hallelujah I'm just so happy
[42:09] about that amen
[42:11] I know eternity has stepped out into my
[42:13] soul praise the Lord now let's see this
[42:16] thought the next verse there's one God
[42:18] and Father now the scripture says this
[42:20] there's one god and father of all who's
[42:22] above all through all and in you all and
[42:26] of course he's speaking about the Holy
[42:28] Ghost field Saints cuz a person that's
[42:29] not born again doesn't have God living
[42:32] in them they might have potential they
[42:34] might have a seed in their soul but
[42:35] God's not officially living in them
[42:37] until they're quickened and made alive
[42:39] amen now I don't know if you caught this
[42:42] but there are seven ones you see this
[42:44] down here there's seven ones from verse
[42:46] four to five there's one body Jew and
[42:48] Gentile there's one spirit that's the
[42:50] Holy Ghost the eternal spirit there's
[42:52] one hope perhaps this is the hope of
[42:55] your Liberty the hope of the fellowship
[42:57] with the Sun Christ Jesus there's one
[43:00] Lord there's one chief master or
[43:02] possessor there's one faith there's one
[43:05] absolute truth in the Bible and there's
[43:07] one baptism the Holy Ghost baptism and
[43:09] there's one God and Father of us all
[43:12] praise to the Lord I love the seven is
[43:14] the number of completion so God even has
[43:16] seven ones what is the perfect singular
[43:19] number but there's seven ones according
[43:21] to Paul which is striking now so notice
[43:24] God is above through and in us all those
[43:28] of us who are the born-again now of
[43:30] course God's above all of us because
[43:31] Jesus said our Father who art in heaven
[43:33] we know it's throne is above the earth
[43:36] heaven as his throne earth is his
[43:39] footstool now God through us is God
[43:43] working through or amongst the bride
[43:45] members he just flows in our myths from
[43:48] one person to another
[43:49] how many been encouraged by somebody in
[43:51] the church how many been blessed by
[43:53] somebody in the church
[43:54] how many been strengthened by someone in
[43:57] the church that's how the Holy Spirit is
[43:59] supposed to throw flow through us all
[44:01] praise God from one to another and then
[44:05] God is not just through us but he
[44:07] actually dwells in us by the baptism of
[44:09] the Holy Spirit
[44:10] the Prophet picks it up here in this
[44:12] message it is I he said this is the time
[44:15] of Sodom I'm skipping down here when the
[44:17] world's gonna be burned not drowned
[44:18] burned its gonna be burned and this sign
[44:21] was to return not an ark but a God
[44:24] dwelling in the flesh of his people in
[44:26] the church jesus said at that day
[44:29] speaking of our day you'll know that I'm
[44:31] in the father the father me I and you
[44:33] and you and me what a connection we have
[44:36] to Jesus and the father but man said
[44:38] it's God in you all that God was poured
[44:41] into Christ and all Christ was he poured
[44:44] into the church so it's God above us God
[44:46] with us and God in us amen now let's
[44:51] look at this measure of the gift the
[44:55] Bible says but unto every one of us is
[44:57] given grace according to the measure of
[45:00] the gift of Christ so we have this unity
[45:04] we have this oneness we must stay humble
[45:06] we must keep lowness of mind we must
[45:08] stay united in Christ Jesus so Satan
[45:11] can't get into the church and Paul says
[45:14] see but every one of us has grace
[45:16] according to the measure or portion that
[45:19] God has placed in our lives but when
[45:21] says well friends the wrong that's the
[45:23] wrong impression to have your pastors a
[45:25] godly man his prayer will be answered
[45:26] just the same as an evangelist or
[45:31] anybody claiming a gift or anything else
[45:33] he's a man of God you should respect him
[45:35] the way that way and believe in him God
[45:37] will answer your answer is prayer God
[45:40] said confess your faults one to another
[45:41] pray for another that you might be
[45:43] healed not only every person in a
[45:45] measure he said that's got the Holy
[45:47] Spirit has the gift of healing in a
[45:49] measure Superman said every person who's
[45:52] got the Holy Ghost has the gift of
[45:54] healing in a measure hey man that's
[45:58] striking now he says this is 1950 a man
[46:03] says well I don't believe in
[46:04] supernatural he said it wasn't for you
[46:05] it's for believers that's who it's meant
[46:07] for not from believers but to those who
[46:09] believe these signs shall follow them
[46:10] that believe and that's what divine
[46:13] healing is based upon sometimes God does
[46:15] permit special things to happen to faith
[46:17] the believer we all believe in a measure
[46:20] but some may have a little more faith
[46:23] than others
[46:24] amen how many ever seen God do something
[46:28] supernatural in your life through your
[46:30] faith
[46:31] I trust you have where you just believe
[46:33] God's Word you didn't know how it's
[46:35] gonna happen but you just had faith it
[46:37] was going to happen and you saw God
[46:40] honor your faith because it really
[46:42] wasn't your faith it was Christ faith in
[46:44] you so see you can then you can realize
[46:47] ah God has given me a measure God has
[46:49] given me a portion of faith and I must
[46:52] use this faith for his glory now I put
[46:56] this quote on there twice I don't know
[46:58] why I put that under twice and what's
[47:00] gonna replace it but when Jesus was here
[47:01] on earth he did not claim him to be a
[47:03] healer no sir he said I don't do any
[47:05] healing at all it's my father doesn't
[47:07] healing that dwells in me oh if we could
[47:09] only catch that attitude this morning
[47:11] you and I don't have to do the miracle
[47:13] we just have to believe Jesus would be
[47:15] the miracle Jesus was not the miracle
[47:18] worker it was God in him working the
[47:20] miracle it takes the pressure off of us
[47:23] it's not us up to do it but we could ask
[47:26] the father father will you do this if we
[47:29] don't know it's will you do this if we
[47:30] know then God's going to do it then a
[47:34] revelation struck you which we know is
[47:36] rare right we know it doesn't happen all
[47:38] the time
[47:38] most people don't say thus saith the
[47:39] Lord or something like that it's very
[47:41] rare but there are times we don't have
[47:43] to say they'll say at the Lord where
[47:45] faith has anchored in our hearts amen
[47:47] and that is a revelation he said I the
[47:50] son can do nothing what'd he do he was
[47:52] possessed with the power of God without
[47:54] measure we have it in measures he has it
[47:59] without measure just like go out in the
[48:00] ocean get a spoonful of water it's just
[48:02] a spoonful out of the ocean that'd be
[48:04] just a little gift here up inside of him
[48:06] but remember the same chemicals that's
[48:08] in the spoonful of water is in the whole
[48:09] ocean the same thing just smaller way
[48:12] smaller Amen hallelujah so realize the
[48:17] same little measure that's in you is the
[48:20] same quality that was in Christ not as
[48:23] much but it's the same quantity which
[48:25] means it'll do the same things praise
[48:27] God it accomplishes the same purpose now
[48:31] he said God give this gift to me by
[48:32] measure it gives it to you
[48:34] I'm sorry gives it to you by measure he
[48:36] gives it to this man to pray
[48:37] by measure he gives it this man to sing
[48:40] by measure so now we're getting into
[48:43] other gifts in our lives and I just want
[48:46] every person who started to sing I want
[48:48] them to sing by the Holy Ghost in our
[48:50] church
[48:50] don't hold back your measure to Christ I
[48:53] want every preacher to preach God's Word
[48:55] in our assembly don't hold back your
[48:57] measure to Jesus and now divine healing
[49:00] we're to wisdom knowledge prophecy we go
[49:02] through all those don't hold back your
[49:04] gift use that God use the measure I had
[49:07] but see you got to be response with that
[49:10] you got to take care you got to give
[49:12] focus and you got to give attention to
[49:13] your measure praise God the Bible God
[49:16] told preachers don't neglect your gift
[49:18] well brother Jesse I've seen God healed
[49:20] for me before well then you've got to
[49:21] further consecrate that measure in your
[49:24] life so that God can use it and bless it
[49:26] and make it bless more people praise God
[49:29] it's a gift
[49:31] it's it's a talent it's got to be
[49:34] invested in it's gonna be focused on
[49:36] amen and God even told Timothy he said
[49:39] he said forget about everything else
[49:41] just give yourself to preaching to
[49:43] edification to teaching to exhorting
[49:45] forget everything else and focus on that
[49:47] measure in your life amen
[49:49] oh if we could only do that there's no
[49:51] distractions from the world just focus
[49:53] on the gift God has placed in our lives
[49:55] amen
[49:56] Oh hallelujah pretty give it to Jesus
[50:00] without measure all God was in him God
[50:02] was manifest in the flesh now we have
[50:04] the spirit by these gifts by portion so
[50:06] see now he says a measures a portion a
[50:08] portion as a gift but Christ handed
[50:11] without measure we have it by measure -
[50:13] one is given now each other one given
[50:14] wisdom there in the church five offices
[50:17] apostles or missionaries either one both
[50:19] the same thing word means one set
[50:21] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[50:23] pastors God sets them in the church but
[50:25] because one would be an apostle the
[50:27] Prophet can say you're not in it for the
[50:30] pastors and evangelists and so forth oh
[50:32] because you don't preach every week like
[50:33] me evangelist you're not as good as me
[50:37] now every part is extremely important
[50:41] every gift is so important he says but
[50:44] there are little lines of God that's all
[50:47] we need to be this morning is a little
[50:49] channel for God to use crazy
[50:51] you just have to bring your portion you
[50:54] just have to bring your little gift
[50:55] just bring it present it for the Lord
[50:57] and watch god bless that portion amen
[50:59] and in every local body there should be
[51:03] nine spiritual gifts
[51:04] I wonder which gifts we have laying here
[51:06] amen nine spiritual gifts in each body
[51:09] they operate separately but of the self
[51:11] same spirit this is what I've been
[51:15] encouraging everybody to come early to
[51:16] pray that's why I invited you in 2018 to
[51:18] come early and pray well commander said
[51:20] you brethren should be just as
[51:21] interested in getting your measure can I
[51:24] say like that you should be just as
[51:27] interested in getting your measure in
[51:28] the place in the house of God as the
[51:30] pastor isn't getting in his because it's
[51:33] just essential that you do it it's
[51:36] absolutely necessary to have everybody
[51:38] bring their measure to church and have
[51:42] it be ready for God to use praise the
[51:44] Lord hey man it's essential we've got to
[51:47] have that we know brother loris you know
[51:49] when he calmed I'm just used to him and
[51:51] I as an example we know he gives his
[51:52] portion to God he practices at home and
[51:55] makes new songs puts up on CD he said we
[51:58] love it we rejoice amen
[52:00] we love the concerts I hope you enjoy my
[52:03] preaching because I spent a lot of time
[52:04] preparing I just invest and I just stay
[52:08] focus and invest keep investing in it I
[52:10] try to let anything distract me just
[52:13] stay right with the word of God amen
[52:14] and just as I'm interested in brother
[52:17] losses every one of us should be just as
[52:20] interested and what am I supposed to do
[52:22] in the house of God
[52:24] notice my Bible said in the house of God
[52:26] in the house of God does that help by
[52:31] God's grace hope that's a blessing now
[52:34] let's move on to this thought here I
[52:35] want to get to this thought because I
[52:37] got about 46 minutes but that's gonna
[52:38] fly by I'm sure once I'm already in
[52:42] heavenly places by God's grace Wow he
[52:46] led captivity captive and gave gifts to
[52:47] men we probably heard he's some of these
[52:49] things before well that's just kind of
[52:50] zoom in who's ever read Psalms 68 and
[52:54] seen that before how it's where where
[52:56] Paul got this idea from okay it's me
[52:59] it's just the whole chapter it's
[53:00] beautiful you'll love it
[53:03] now the Bibles
[53:04] we're for he said remember Paul's
[53:06] talking about Christian unity everybody
[53:08] be humble everybody be submissive to one
[53:11] spirit everybody have your measure and
[53:13] gift in order and he says wherefore he
[53:17] saith when he ascended up on high he led
[53:20] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[53:22] men so how's this unity going to be
[53:25] accomplished how is the church going to
[53:27] bear with one another and hold each
[53:29] other up in love it's through the gifts
[53:31] of the Holy Spirit now that he ascended
[53:34] but what is it but he also de-scented
[53:37] first and I love this the way up is down
[53:40] amen the way for Christ to be seated at
[53:43] the right hand of the Father the way for
[53:45] him to get up was first the sand amen
[53:47] and church the way for us to get
[53:49] ascended into a position or send it into
[53:51] ministry or ascending into some place or
[53:54] an adoption with God we've got a humble
[53:56] ourselves amen the best way I know to
[53:58] humble yourself is to pray and see how
[54:02] little you can become to see how nuts is
[54:05] to see how much you can realize I
[54:06] actually don't know god help us all help
[54:09] me amen help us all verse 10 he that
[54:12] descended is the same also that ascended
[54:13] up far above all heavens that he might
[54:15] fill all things so once he resurrected
[54:19] him and sat down the Holy Ghost now
[54:20] through the Holy Ghost he can fill all
[54:22] things yea he can fill this church he
[54:26] can fill that church he can fill and he
[54:28] wants to feel this church praise God he
[54:32] wants to fill everything I'll say like
[54:34] this he should fill our hearts he should
[54:36] fill our minds our words our testimonies
[54:39] everything we should do
[54:40] he should fill all of our lives amen
[54:42] because he's ascended now praise God and
[54:46] he gave some apostles and some prophets
[54:48] and some evangelists and some pastors
[54:50] and some teachers well you know pastors
[54:55] aren't us pastors aren't as special as
[54:57] the Prophet you know and the prophets
[54:59] got the say at the Lord you see how that
[55:00] devil slips it don't get me wrong the
[55:03] Prophet has a very special job the
[55:05] pastor can't touch it but in the same
[55:09] way brother Bram said I can never be a
[55:11] faithful pastor because I didn't have
[55:13] that gift
[55:14] I'm not faithful he said a successful he
[55:17] says that I can never
[55:18] because I had a wandering spirit which
[55:20] means he had to go out and evangelize he
[55:22] had to go prophesy here prophesy there
[55:24] prophesied there foretell things and had
[55:26] to get the discernment and show the son
[55:28] of man gift all around the world but see
[55:30] we think well we've got exalted people
[55:33] above people we've got to be all on this
[55:35] level now don't get me wrong apostles
[55:37] higher than and prophet pasta is the
[55:39] highest gift and prophets and teachers
[55:41] it goes on down I'm not sure which is
[55:43] louis pasteur evangelist I'll just say
[55:45] pastors or lowest praise God that just
[55:47] fits me the best will just be the lowest
[55:49] to the pastors but either way a table
[55:52] that doesn't exalt anybody above Christ
[55:55] Christ is high above all things he's
[55:58] ascended above all the prophets Christ
[56:00] is ascended above all the Apostles
[56:02] because Christ is the high priest and
[56:04] apostle of our profession Amen
[56:06] hallelujah now notice the order Jesus
[56:10] first descended and then he ascended and
[56:14] led captivity captive and then he gave
[56:17] preaching gifts unto men to keep the
[56:20] church unified no no when the last time
[56:23] you heard this but let's listen to
[56:24] brother Branham dramatized Jesus's
[56:27] descent and essentially always here in
[56:28] the Easter time but let's look at again
[56:30] this morning did you know there was
[56:33] three levels of descent brother Branham
[56:35] said there's three levels there was lost
[56:38] souls then demons and then Satan that's
[56:43] her brother BAM said there was three
[56:44] levels but man Allah said I can see him
[56:47] now this after he's crucified let's
[56:49] dramatize this I can see him coming down
[56:51] into the first dimension of lost souls

[1:22:34] what is our desires believers our
[1:22:36] desires believers is to let God's gifts

[1:22:44] also he'll forgive strengthen encourage
[1:22:50] direct prophesy grant wisdom through the
[1:22:54] gifts the five preaching gifts of the
[1:22:56] Holy Spirit and by doing that we become
[1:22:59] the Joshua we become the conquerors and
[1:23:01] every place we put our foot is our
[1:23:04] possession we can possess our homes for
[1:23:08] the glory of God we can possess our
[1:23:12] workplaces for the glory of God amen you
[1:23:17] can possess your body here for divine
[1:23:20] healing you can possess that that's an
[1:23:23] area where you can step in and you can
[1:23:25] possess that and Satan will go under
[1:23:28] your feet as you believe the Word of God
[1:23:31] amen
[1:23:34] God who's going to do this the God of
[1:23:36] peace is going to do this as the Word of
[1:23:40] God has preached to you we receive the
[1:23:42] Word of God and that very God who sent
[1:23:44] his word will back his word up amen and
[1:23:47] he has to bruise Satan under your feet
[1:23:50] shortly so that you are more than a
[1:23:53] conqueror praise God how many believe
[1:23:56] that Scripture
[1:23:58] absolutely it's the victory we must get
[1:24:01] victory through the power of God now go
[1:24:05] to our first cookie in 612 this
[1:24:08] scripture just come to my mind if you're
[1:24:14] battling a
[1:24:15] the scripture that helped me get victory
[1:24:16] some brother from South Africa was
[1:24:18] texting me asking about addictions and I
[1:24:23] said brother I said this is the
[1:24:24] scripture that brought me victory all
[1:24:25] things are lawful unto me but all things
[1:24:27] are not expedient or necessary all
[1:24:30] things are lawful for me but I will not
[1:24:32] be brought under the power of any at one
[1:24:37] point in my life I didn't think I could
[1:24:38] give up chewing tobacco or didn't think
[1:24:40] I could give up smoking but when I saw
[1:24:42] the scripture I realized there is no
[1:24:44] power that can take me unless I submit
[1:24:48] myself to it I do not have to be brought
[1:24:52] under the power of any and so it is with
[1:24:55] dishonesty so it is with lust so it is
[1:24:58] with greed so it is with worldly things
[1:25:01] we've got to remember that we do not be
[1:25:04] brought under the power of anything we
[1:25:06] have power over it and when we obey the
[1:25:10] word of God the obedience factor there
[1:25:12] when we obey God that's when we're
[1:25:15] making footsteps of possession that's
[1:25:17] what we're possessing the land is when
[1:25:19] we're obeying the Word of God amen
[1:25:24] hallelujah now let's go to another one I
[1:25:27] got this one on my mind I didn't plan on
[1:25:28] this but I am gonna go there
[1:25:30] let's go to sin gurnius seven now if you
[1:25:37] know the background this Paul rebuked
[1:25:39] the Corinthians in the first book in the
[1:25:41] second book he starts talking about that
[1:25:44] letter he said now I rejoice now this is
[1:25:47] singer than seven nine now rejoice not
[1:25:49] that you're made sorry but that you
[1:25:50] sorrow to repentance see even apologize
[1:25:52] if he hurt their feelings I mean if
[1:25:54] you're sinning I'm not gonna apologize
[1:25:55] for hurting your feelings because it's
[1:25:57] not me hurt your feelings it's Chrysler
[1:25:59] in your feelings so see I'm not
[1:26:03] rejoicing over I made you sorry but I'm
[1:26:05] rejoicing because you sorrowful to
[1:26:07] repentance and this last couple years
[1:26:10] I've seen people weep alligator tears up
[1:26:12] here but never get to repentance and you
[1:26:15] probably know what I'm talking about
[1:26:17] I'm not talking about about individuals
[1:26:18] what I'm saying is that I've seen it God
[1:26:20] has proved to me I can pray with someone
[1:26:22] for an hour and a half and they can cry
[1:26:24] for an hour and a half but if they're
[1:26:26] not ready to die out there
[1:26:27] crying they're just crying
[1:26:32] they're just sorry they did it but there
[1:26:35] was no death to self amen and that's
[1:26:39] what it takes in your life if you and
[1:26:40] you and I want to bruise Satan under our
[1:26:42] feet we've got to die too that that just
[1:26:46] feels sorry for everybody feels sorry
[1:26:48] for it now you have to be feel sorry
[1:26:50] enough to cry you know because the by or
[1:26:52] by Bannister there's no such thing as a
[1:26:53] dried confession if somebody dies and
[1:26:57] you love them and you don't cry
[1:26:58] something's wrong with you not them you
[1:27:01] right
[1:27:02] we must cry we must feel the pains but
[1:27:05] look what the Bible said here for you
[1:27:07] made sorry after a godly manner that you
[1:27:09] might receive damage by us and nothing
[1:27:11] see if I made you sorry from the Word of
[1:27:14] God then I did damage you I'll try to
[1:27:16] help you for godly sorrow worketh to
[1:27:19] herself salvation not to be repented of
[1:27:22] but the saw of the world work of death
[1:27:23] and that's what I've seen over and over
[1:27:25] for hours praying with people and
[1:27:27] they're sorry and crying but they're not
[1:27:29] godly sorrowful their worldly sorrowful
[1:27:32] and Satan will never be bruised under
[1:27:35] they feet until they take their
[1:27:37] spiritual foot and say die get out of my
[1:27:40] life I'm done with this I'm never going
[1:27:43] back I know I'm getting the victory
[1:27:44] Satan's bruised under my foot praise God
[1:27:47] when was the last time you stomped a
[1:27:49] little bug like well it was the last
[1:27:52] time you did that well I was recently

[1:28:17] and I had to bruise that centipede under
[1:28:20] my hand but this I could have I could
[1:28:24] have just let it go but if you if I want
[1:28:27] to see that being dead I've got to
[1:28:29] bruise it under my hand and if we were
[1:28:32] to see something dead some habit ER or
[1:28:34] some thought or some temptation if we
[1:28:37] want to see a dead we've got to reach
[1:28:38] out and crush that thing
[1:28:40] but listen you got to take the strong
[1:28:42] hand of faith and slay that thing and

[1:29:42] if we come in here and say I'm sorry but
[1:29:44] then we're not careful we walk out we
[1:29:46] never repented
[1:29:47] it was worldly sorrow and not godly
[1:29:50] sorrow how many one godly sorrow you've

[1:32:28] remember either you cut it off or God's
[1:32:31] gonna cut you off member that sermon
[1:32:32] from two Sundays ago either you cut it
[1:32:35] off or God's gonna cut you off from the
[1:32:36] anointing and the church said let me
[1:32:39] find a place to close here I got six
[1:32:41] minutes oh my well how's that gonna
[1:32:43] happen
[1:32:44] all right let's if we can let's go to
[1:32:46] Psalm 68 that one closed I don't had a
[1:32:49] few scriptures on here's the origin
[1:32:51] Psalm 68 what a beautiful man this was
[1:32:54] glorious the Bible so inspired
[1:32:58] so I'm 68
[1:33:03] remember David cried out my God my god a
[1:33:06] thousand years before Christ did he cry
[1:33:10] he wrote about my bone stare at me and
[1:33:12] and my flesh and all these things and
[1:33:14] that was 500 years before crucifixion
[1:33:16] was even invented that's how inspired
[1:33:19] that man was he was prophesying in his
[1:33:21] singing hey man I just want to sing but
[1:33:26] what about prophesy prophesying while
[1:33:28] singing oh my Psalm 68 this was written
[1:33:33] probably let me get the year on this
[1:33:34] Scofield has a timeline here I think all
[1:33:40] these groups were written in the same
[1:33:41] year around the same year well they're
[1:33:46] not listed any years here what have I
[1:33:48] done I must have misunderstood that well
[1:33:50] anyways it's about a thousand years
[1:33:52] before Christ cuz that's when Solomon
[1:33:53] reigned a thousand years before Christ
[1:33:55] so David was right before that Psalm 68
[1:33:57] this is - the chief musician a song or
[1:34:00] song of David so this is the origin look
[1:34:07] at verse 1 let God arise let his enemies
[1:34:12] be scattered remember this is the text
[1:34:15] where Paul's gonna look back and say my
[1:34:17] Jesus's resurrection is in here plus the
[1:34:20] preaching gifts of the fivefold ministry
[1:34:22] God is arising in Christ
[1:34:25] just like God arose in the preachers are
[1:34:29] you with me let God arise and his
[1:34:32] enemies be scattered sure sometimes I
[1:34:34] think if we just sometimes take coming
[1:34:36] to church for granted there Satan
[1:34:40] bruising power here this morning Church
[1:34:45] because Jesus set it up and there's just
[1:34:48] as much a measure me as there isn't any
[1:34:51] of you but we've got to believe that and
[1:34:54] we got to repent if we want to see Satan
[1:34:58] bruised under our feet praise God let
[1:35:04] God arise let us enemies be scattered
[1:35:07] let them also that hate him flee before
[1:35:10] him as smoke is driven back so drive
[1:35:13] them away as wax melteth before the fire
[1:35:17] so let the wicked perish at the presence
[1:35:19] of the Lord so this is God coming forth
[1:35:22] and there's no enemy that's gonna stand
[1:35:23] before him verse 3 but let the righteous
[1:35:27] be glad let them rejoice before God yay
[1:35:30] let them exceedingly rejoice hallelujah
[1:35:34] sing unto God sing praises to his name
[1:35:37] extol him that rides upon the heavens by
[1:35:40] his name Jah and rejoice before him now
[1:35:43] look at this who's in God's army is it
[1:35:47] the up and ups and the famous people and
[1:35:49] the popular people look at verse 5 a
[1:35:52] father of the fatherless and a judge of
[1:35:57] the widows is God I'm sorry is God in
[1:36:04] His holy habitation so remember all
[1:36:07] these enemies are melting like wax
[1:36:09] before him as he goes forth in victory
[1:36:11] and behind them are all these fatherless
[1:36:14] widows cast out nobody's good for
[1:36:18] nothing people and there are rejoicing
[1:36:21] enemies are burning but all these
[1:36:24] castaways and nobody wanted them
[1:36:26] good-for-nothing people rejected the
[1:36:29] world they all rejoicing
[1:36:31] there in the army of Christ amen glory
[1:36:35] that's just like David number one David
[1:36:37] first left saw remember he went out into
[1:36:39] the cave and who came with him all the
[1:36:42] reads the Bible said all the rejected
[1:36:44] all those that were in debt all the
[1:36:47] debtors all those who couldn't pay off
[1:36:49] their debts all of us couldn't pay off
[1:36:51] our sin-debt
[1:36:52] either we all were in debt we all had
[1:36:56] sin debts and all we knew as a well Saul
[1:36:59] is a nice guy but he's got a evil spirit
[1:37:01] on him I just want to follow the man
[1:37:02] who's got the Holy Spirit on him as all
[1:37:06] far as my situation is I know a man with
[1:37:08] the Holy Spirit on him I know if I
[1:37:10] follow that man God will bless me how
[1:37:13] then three and it was a smaller army it
[1:37:18] was the rejected army and this is the
[1:37:20] army that David sees with God the widows
[1:37:23] the fatherless the rejected the debtors
[1:37:25] they're all rejoicing because Christ is
[1:37:28] leading them
[1:37:30] oh my verse 6 God said the solitary in
[1:37:33] families oh look I have no family
[1:37:36] I know family God will give you a family
[1:37:38] member gia said I promised you a
[1:37:39] hundredfold
[1:37:40] if you leave your family I'll give you a
[1:37:42] hundredfold in this world and the world
[1:37:44] to come if you need a family God's got
[1:37:47] one for you
[1:37:49] hallelujah he said he bringeth out those
[1:37:53] which are bound with chains he breaks
[1:37:56] every chain amen he breaks every chain
[1:37:58] amen but the rebellious dwell in a dry
[1:38:03] land all those that rebelled against
[1:38:05] Christ message they draw they're not

[1:38:09] refreshed there there aren't any fruits

[1:38:21] enemies Church now that's if you're

[1:40:28] the highest of the hills in that area

[1:40:33] greater than that one Wiley P high hills

[1:40:41] desired to dwell in no sir this is the
[1:40:43] hill which God desire to dwell in yea
[1:40:45] the Lord will dwell in it forever so

[1:41:41] good blessing from the Lord Oh every
[1:41:44] decade I'll get a real blessing from the
[1:41:46] Lord the Bible said everyday God is
[1:41:48] showering benefits upon you just for
[1:41:50] being a believer how many are witness to
[1:41:52] that oh I made it through yesterday

[1:42:12] that is our God is the god of salvation
[1:42:13] unto God the Lord belong the issues from
[1:42:16] death I'm gonna pause right there here's
[1:42:19] what FB Meyer says he said this is one
[1:42:21] of the grandest ODEs in literature
[1:42:23] it was proudly composed when the Ark was
[1:42:25] brought and triumph from the house of
[1:42:26] obed-edom to the newly acquired hill of
[1:42:29] the Lord which was David bringing the
[1:42:30] ark back the second time when he filed
[1:42:32] all the word it is evidently a
[1:42:34] processional him intended to be sung by
[1:42:37] the bands of white robed priests and
[1:42:38] levites in this paragraph the ark was
[1:42:41] lifted to the shoulders of his Bears
[1:42:42] while a measured strain was chanted then
[1:42:46] as the procession moved forward the
[1:42:48] march of the wilderness was recited so
[1:42:51] they raised up the ark and the Bible
[1:42:53] said let God arise and let his enemies
[1:42:56] be scattered
[1:42:57] I wonder of us are spiritually sitting
[1:42:59] today just sitting just trying to be
[1:43:00] live the Christian life I wonder how
[1:43:03] many of us could say I need to arise and
[1:43:04] let God's Word live in my life I need to
[1:43:08] get up I'm sitting on the Lord it has to
[1:43:11] arise it has to come to the forefront of
[1:43:13] my lips it has to come to the forefront
[1:43:16] of my actions it has to come to the
[1:43:19] forefront of my daily life David saying
[1:43:22] let God arise let's move forward okay
[1:43:27] let's move on let's get the word in its
[1:43:31] proper place in our lives amen
[1:43:34] let gather eyes his enemies will be
[1:43:37] scattered your enemies will scatter
[1:43:39] before you
[1:43:40] we just gotta let God arise amen lift
[1:43:44] him to the place where he must be in our
[1:43:45] lives let God arise these opening words
[1:43:49] are borrowed from the former lose bought
[1:43:51] used by Moses you Moses said that when
[1:43:53] they would travel Moses would say let
[1:43:54] God arise they see the pillar of fire
[1:43:57] moving let God arise we're moving
[1:44:00] forward and David's saying let God arise
[1:44:02] here comes Christ he comes to his holy
[1:44:05] hill and he's giving gifts unto men
[1:44:07] never forget the daily benefits of the
[1:44:09] Holy Ghost amen
[1:44:10] it comes to the preaching of the word
[1:44:13] because it's not the preacher it's God's
[1:44:15] Word in the preachers mouth amen let me
[1:44:21] see this one you listen to our feet
[1:44:24] notice he led captivity captive I like
[1:44:28] what this writer said matthew henry he
[1:44:30] said jesus was the death of death and
[1:44:35] that beautiful jesus was the death of
[1:44:37] death and so he was also the captivity
[1:44:40] of captivity he destroyed that through
[1:44:44] death and Jesus brought slavery into
[1:44:48] slavery I say it like that
[1:44:51] those Old Testament Saints were enslaved
[1:44:54] they were slaves under the blood of
[1:44:56] bulls and goats they can never leave so
[1:44:59] Jesus said I'm using I'm enslaving
[1:45:01] slavery I'm taking them other slavery
[1:45:05] and now they're gonna be love slaves to
[1:45:07] me because that's what they wanted in
[1:45:08] life oh yes that's so we would've life
[1:45:12] how many want to be a love slave to
[1:45:14] Christ Paul said I am a prisoner of
[1:45:18] Christ I'm a slave to Christ Jesus
[1:45:22] that's all I want did you say that when
[1:45:24] you prayed your confessional prayer Lord
[1:45:26] I just want to serve you as a prisoner
[1:45:30] all the days of my life I just want to
[1:45:32] be enslaved I just want to be captured I
[1:45:35] just want to be contained in your love
[1:45:37] and Jesus told those four thousand
[1:45:39] because you wanted to be enslaved to me
[1:45:41] now I'm gonna bring your slavery into
[1:45:43] slavery I'm gonna defeat slavery by the
[1:45:47] slavery of taking every demon under my
[1:45:49] control I've got the keys of death in
[1:45:53] hell amen aren't you glad Church aren't
[1:45:58] you glad to be in this army by the grace
[1:45:59] of God we're lures once you come here
[1:46:01] we'll get ready for a little just a to
[1:46:04] call prayer if anyone desires prayer
[1:46:05] here we're daily loaded with his
[1:46:09] benefits daily we must not forget
[1:46:14] his benefits let God arise and his
[1:46:20] enemies be scattered how many love the
[1:46:25] Word of God praise the Lord this do you
[1:46:35] play in the cross be my glory ever Jesus
[1:46:38] keep me near the cross every one of us
[1:46:48] has been given the gift or the measure
[1:46:51] of Christ you're the only one who knows
[1:46:55] am i letting this gift arise by letting
[1:47:01] God arise is this gift being used for
[1:47:07] the glory of God is my life being
[1:47:12] perfected the Bible said it should be
[1:47:14] through the fivefold ministry am i being
[1:47:16] edified the Bible says it should be
[1:47:23] is my faith being United with all the
[1:47:25] believers around the world it should be
[1:47:29] am i growing in the knowledge of the Son
[1:47:32] of God am i seeing myself grow into the
[1:47:34] stature of Christ it should be we should
[1:47:38] see our lives becoming more like Christ
[1:47:41] character if not and there say it needs
[1:47:45] to be bruised if we don't see these
[1:47:49] things there's probably some spiritual
[1:47:52] centipede crawling on the floor you got
[1:47:53] to crush that thing and it can't be just
[1:47:56] like oh I'm sorry about it it's got to
[1:47:58] die and then you got to take revenge
[1:48:01] upon that it's of our heads for a moment
[1:48:06] in a moment I'll just call if anyone
[1:48:08] desires prayer but as we pray think
[1:48:12] about your life is there something that
[1:48:14] you just need to see it under your feet
[1:48:17] [Music]
[1:48:21] does it feel like God's measures not
[1:48:25] rising up it's not leading the way in
[1:48:28] your life maybe you've got other things
[1:48:30] lead your life and God's Word is not
[1:48:32] leading your life the Bible says let God
[1:48:37] arise if we let God arise his enemies
[1:48:41] have to scatter and that's nothing more
[1:48:45] than quoting the word believing the word
[1:48:48] crucify anything passing down anything
[1:48:52] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:48:54] of God the promise of god let's pray
[1:48:58] Heavenly Father Lord we just love you
[1:49:00] today thank you for the word that we've

[1:49:19] down these gifts and you said if I send
[1:49:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I
[1:49:25] start having people fill with that and
[1:49:27] preachers preaching the things of God
[1:49:29] then my people will be united my people
[1:49:32] will come to perfection my people will
[1:49:34] be strengthened and edified my people
[1:49:36] will grow into the measure and stature
[1:49:38] of Christ myself Lord my prayer is that
[1:49:44] each person here will examine their
[1:49:45] lives for a moment and see Lord if
[1:49:48] they're letting Christ rise in their
[1:49:49] lives

[1:49:57] if they're recognizing God's daily
[1:50:01] benefits help your people to be thankful
[1:50:07] help your people to let faith arise in
