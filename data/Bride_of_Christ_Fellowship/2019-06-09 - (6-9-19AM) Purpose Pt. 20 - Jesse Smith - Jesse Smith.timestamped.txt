[36:04] chapter three like to go back to the
[36:08] purpose series this is part 20 Lord
[36:11] willing
[36:12] look at this out here this morning by
[36:14] God's grace please ask these chapter 3
[36:22] verse 1 to 5 no one read Genesis chapter
[36:26] 1
[36:31] just please yeah see chapter 3 can you
[36:36] do me a favor Malachi can you get the
[36:38] mic on there I forgot it I just forgot
[36:40] to put it on today
[36:54] please a see chapter three verses one to
[36:57] five then we'll go to Genesis chapter 1
[37:02] verses 14 through 16 thank you please
[37:15] ask these three verse 1 everything there
[37:18] is a season and a time to every purpose
[37:23] under heaven that means right now
[37:27] there's some season you're in right now
[37:29] and and God has a purpose for it right
[37:32] now here in June of 2019 God has a
[37:37] season that you're in right now and a
[37:39] purpose for this season as well so no
[37:43] one can leave out of here and say well
[37:45] there's no reason for me to go to church
[37:46] today there's no purpose for me to be
[37:48] alive right now that's not true there is
[37:50] a purpose and as with everything else we
[37:54] have to humble ourselves in order to see
[37:56] that purpose right because man is often
[37:59] exalted and full of pride and the way to
[38:01] draw near to God is to abase yourself
[38:03] right humble yourself and then God will
[38:08] draw nigh to you verse 2 a time to be
[38:12] born and a time to die a time to plant
[38:16] and a time to pluck up that which is
[38:18] planted a time to kill and a time to
[38:22] heal a time to break down and a time to
[38:25] build up a time to weep and a time to
[38:29] laugh time to mourn and a time to dance
[38:34] verse 5 a time to cast away stones and a
[38:39] time to gather stones a time to embrace
[38:42] and a time to refrain from embracing
[38:46] let's go to Genesis chapter 1 verse 14
[38:54] Lord willing before we get to these
[38:57] seasons I like to just look at the the
[38:59] moon
[39:01] and the number 28 just for a few minutes
[39:04] before we get to sees that we've been up
[39:09] here Genesis 1:14 and God said let there
[39:20] be lights in the firmament of the heaven
[39:22] to divide the day from the night and let
[39:25] them be for signs and for seasons and
[39:28] for days and years and let them be for
[39:31] lights in the firmament of the heaven to
[39:33] give light upon the earth and it was so
[39:35] that's all read verse 16 together one
[39:38] two three and God made two great lights
[39:41] the greater light to rule the day and
[39:43] the lesser light to rule the night he
[39:46] made the stars also let's have one more
[39:49] word of Prayer if you ever need on your
[39:50] heart just make it known unto God
[39:51] Heavenly Father our hearts are unified
[39:53] just as our voices there were unified
[39:55] together so our hearts unified on you
[39:59] Lord God we have one hope we have one
[40:01] God we have one faith we have one Lord
[40:04] we have one baptism Lord we're unified
[40:06] today under the banner of Christianity
[40:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the one
[40:11] message of the our Lord
[40:13] the restoration message that you've set
[40:15] in this day we're so grateful Lord God
[40:17] and father help us to come under the
[40:19] unity of the Spirit right now how your
[40:21] spirits dealing with this Lord may we
[40:24] see your purpose Lord and every time and
[40:26] season Lord and and know that every
[40:27] season is crucial and important Lord God
[40:30] and father to know that you're in
[40:32] control Lord and you've ordained times
[40:34] seasons for your glory
[40:36] so father help us today Lord to getting
[40:39] the the spirit Lord God Lord to yield to
[40:43] your Holy Spirit help us to humble
[40:44] ourselves Lord God
[40:48] working in our lives and we'll give you
[40:50] all the glory for we know there's a
[40:51] purpose for this service in Jesus
[40:53] Christ's name and the church said Amen
[40:56] god bless use me to see the praise the
[40:57] Lord so we like to look to the scripture
[41:05] here and I do have a few slides here
[41:07] Lydia Lord willing to show and so we
[41:12] want to look to the Word of God this
[41:13] morning and I know to bless you here by
[41:17] the God's grace like I said I want to
[41:20] start with these you know kind of a few
[41:23] thoughts here so I don't want it dropped
[41:26] just a few a few thoughts about the 28
[41:29] here so we're looking at part 20 here
[41:32] and we read our text and you know it was
[41:37] really striking as I've been staying on
[41:39] this thought it's really quite striking
[41:42] to see how inspired this is and even to
[41:45] even this morning it was opening up a
[41:47] little more to me to understanding these
[41:51] seasons why would God anoint Solomon
[41:56] 3,000 years ago to write 14 different
[41:59] seasons that have you know opposite
[42:03] actions and actions making for a total
[42:06] of 28 God anoint a man like that the
[42:10] wisest man of all outside of Christ as
[42:13] far as we know the gift of wisdom for
[42:15] the Old Testament remember there was
[42:17] none born greater than John the Baptist
[42:19] so John was somehow greater than Solomon
[42:23] although Solomon's very wise John the
[42:25] Baptist was greater because he got to
[42:27] handle the Messiah praise God the
[42:31] Solomon never got to that he beheld him
[42:32] twice in visions but he never got to
[42:34] handle him but John got to handle the
[42:36] Word made flesh and so it's been just a
[42:40] bit a little inspired you know to begin
[42:43] reading these things and and to see how
[42:47] church how this relates to us so just
[42:52] take a look at these and you know I'll
[42:54] say like this I believe you and I are in
[42:57] one of these seasons right now and
[42:59] remember there's both Nat
[43:01] and they're spiritual for example you
[43:05] know we'll get to a little later but
[43:06] there's a natural season to be born and
[43:08] to die but there's also spiritual season
[43:11] to die out to everything finish
[43:13] sanctification and be born again in the
[43:15] Holy Ghost there there's a natural
[43:18] season and a spiritual season for all
[43:20] these and Lord willing today we'll get
[43:23] to I think Lord willing we'll get to
[43:25] seven and eight today and then maybe
[43:27] tonight we'll see what the Lord has but
[43:31] it's a it's very striking and inspired
[43:34] but I want to take a few moments to look
[43:36] at the number 28 now when I preach the
[43:38] numerology series I'm not done with that
[43:40] quite yet but I didn't have any numbers
[43:43] for 28 as far as in the scripture so but
[43:48] as I studied these things and studying
[43:51] that number 28 here with 28 seasons this
[43:55] would be our first number 28 but really
[43:58] 28 means month right now 30 can be a
[44:03] month as well you know in Judah and the
[44:04] Jews a prophetic timeline but God has
[44:08] connected 28 to a cycle as well
[44:11] right which two main cycles that we know
[44:14] are in 28 which is the cycle of the
[44:16] moon's phases and then a woman's cycle
[44:18] to bring forth life is in 28 28 days in
[44:22] a cycle and so God has placed this this
[44:26] this particular season or cycle in 28
[44:30] God has done that church and and man
[44:32] can't alter as much as they want to try
[44:34] to alter it man can't alter it these
[44:37] things just keep going over and over and
[44:39] over and as God said what are they for
[44:41] why does the moon just keep going over
[44:43] and over it's four times and four
[44:46] seasons and to speak to us amen
[44:49] all these seasons are to speak something
[44:52] to us in other words one great lesson it
[44:56] speaks to us is that God is sovereign
[44:58] and God has chosen the season God has
[45:01] ordained the season and you could have
[45:03] hope you can have grace and faith you
[45:06] can have confidence that God is in
[45:08] control amen that's one great thing God
[45:11] wants that work in our lives is
[45:13] confidence in his word
[45:14] his trust in his word Amen faith in his
[45:17] word and confidence in him
[45:20] that no matter what happens God is in
[45:22] control praise the Lord so we don't know
[45:27] so we don't fear you know spheres a
[45:30] great paralyzing spirit right and it'll
[45:33] make us so afraid that we'll be afraid
[45:35] to do anything because we don't know is
[45:37] God with me or is God helping me does
[45:39] God know what's going on has God left me
[45:41] and it paralyzes your faith but when the
[45:44] spirit of love comes it frees you from
[45:46] that and they're there and then then you
[45:49] have a sound again amen because it's the
[45:52] power of love and of a sound mind amen
[45:56] but Satan wants to paralyze it and get
[45:58] your mind all fluctuating between belief
[46:02] and unbelief and once they're trying to
[46:05] get you discouraged and and what to try
[46:07] to get you tossed about in the storms of
[46:10] life but God's Spirit of love is here
[46:13] this morning ain't it and it's here to
[46:15] help you it's here to help me it's here
[46:17] to help us to have love power and a
[46:20] sound mind
[46:20] now weakness but power in the Holy
[46:24] Spirit praise God now just another I
[46:29] want to just I just found this inspiring
[46:31] from Matthew Henry's commentary the
[46:34] proof and illustration of it by the
[46:37] induction of particulars 28 in number
[46:41] according to the days of the moon's
[46:43] revolution now he's Matthew Henry is
[46:45] commenting on Solomon in Ecclesiastes
[46:47] chapter 3 which the moon's revolution is
[46:52] always increasing or decreasing amen
[46:56] well they have said you cannot leave the
[46:58] service the same way that you came amen
[47:02] you're either gonna increase or decrease
[47:06] and if we're honest it both of us both
[47:10] of them happen to us some services we
[47:12] take we take more parsley and all my
[47:15] literally get some from God and other
[47:17] services we take a little lightly and we
[47:21] don't actually leave out of there better
[47:22] Christian and I'm gonna prove it too
[47:25] it's prescription
[47:27] I mean it has to be because of what
[47:33] happens in our lives now the Bible said
[47:37] I'm sorry here he says which is always
[47:39] increasing or decreasing between its
[47:41] full and change so it's constantly
[47:45] increasing constantly decreasing the
[47:47] move some of these changes are purely
[47:50] the act of God others depend more upon
[47:53] the will of man but are all determined
[47:55] by the divine counsel praise God
[47:57] see God lets you have your free agency
[47:59] and things and some things you can kind
[48:01] of make happen like we see that with
[48:03] Sarah
[48:03] you know introducing Hagar right she
[48:06] kind of makes this happen she got into
[48:07] brings forth this she does it by her own
[48:10] will right but yet God allowed it in the
[48:13] whole scheme of things in order to
[48:15] magnify the power of the promised Amen
[48:18] God allowed her to have the will of man
[48:22] the will of Sarah the will of Abraham
[48:24] God allowed that but those mistakes only
[48:27] magnify the glory of obedience amen
[48:31] hallelujah and you got to have both
[48:34] seasons you got to have a season of in
[48:37] your life you have to have a season
[48:38] where you tried to work the will of God
[48:40] or you try to do America and it didn't
[48:42] really happen and going through that
[48:44] will allow you to experience the joy of
[48:48] waiting upon the Lord and the Lord
[48:50] vindicating your prayer and God doing a
[48:53] great miracle amen
[48:55] where you had no part of it when one
[48:58] side you had you tried to do it at faith
[49:00] it was miserable a miserable season but
[49:03] then the glory of the other season
[49:06] teaches you to rejoice and it helps you
[49:08] to grow as a Christian a men everything
[49:14] under heaven is thus changeable but in
[49:16] heaven there's an unchangeable state and
[49:18] an unchangeable Council concerning these
[49:20] things now I just want to show you a
[49:22] little visual here I recorded this in
[49:26] slow-mo it starts off it starts off slow
[49:31] but then it speeds up okay so this is
[49:35] constantly in church we see this day
[49:38] after day week after week month after
[49:42] month and year after year and it's just
[49:46] constantly going over again and it's
[49:49] always increasing right always always
[49:51] increasing or decreasing it's we know
[49:53] there's either waxing or waning right
[49:56] and sometimes I say like this but I'm in
[49:59] our churches waxing greater right right
[50:04] sister Karen sometimes the church is
[50:05] just waxing my our strength our face
[50:07] seems to be growing at other times it
[50:10] seems like we're just in a little hard
[50:12] season we're not as strong as we used to
[50:15] be all I remember what last fall mom we
[50:18] were so on fire last whit last summer we
[50:20] are so last winter we were so on fire
[50:22] right and we long for those days we long
[50:26] for those days but church the reality
[50:29] and the glory of it is that we know our
[50:32] God works in seasons and we know I
[50:35] always still are saith the Lord amen
[50:38] although in this light fades and it
[50:41] wanes we know at some point not not on
[50:45] it's gonna return by God's grace amen
[50:48] it has to because God works according to
[50:52] season amen
[50:53] he works that way Jesus are the same
[50:55] thing jesus said the Holy Spirit you
[50:58] don't know when it's coming but it's
[50:59] like a win and it blows it blows and you
[51:02] have to be ready when it comes well
[51:04] anyone that ever studied winds know that
[51:06] there's all these cycles and pass around
[51:08] the world and there's certain circuits
[51:10] of wind and it always goes on these
[51:12] circuits so they they know like at
[51:14] school every may we have the fire
[51:16] department come and they bring one of
[51:18] their RVs and they have what's called a
[51:20] tornado house because that's the season
[51:23] for tornadoes it doesn't really shock
[51:27] anybody you know in May or June when we
[51:29] have a tornado because that's the season
[51:31] for tornadoes right and so it is with us
[51:34] we can sense we should be able to sense
[51:37] in our hearts a season where the winds
[51:40] going to blow Amen are with me we should
[51:44] be able to sense it we should we should
[51:46] look around and see one another
[51:47] burning in prayer I
[51:49] fervently pray worshiping it holding
[51:52] over the Word of God we should be able
[51:54] to sense that something's going to
[51:55] happen because we can feel the winds of
[51:59] the Holy Spirit amen we can feel it pick
[52:02] it up hallelujah
[52:04] just like we can see the light
[52:05] increasing it's being brighter it's
[52:08] getting brighter
[52:09] amen hallelujah now there's two ways to
[52:15] apply this moonface
[52:18] you can apply it to the church age if
[52:20] you apply to the church age the best
[52:22] thing to do is listen to restoration of
[52:24] the bride tree because program tells you
[52:26] there's four stages to the moon because
[52:28] he said there's four stages to restore
[52:30] the light of the church there's four
[52:34] stages the first second third and fourth
[52:36] brother have said the first stage is
[52:38] Luther praise God the second stage is
[52:42] Wesley the third stage is Azusa and this
[52:46] is the last stage amen learn the shining
[52:50] light the brightest age for the moon
[52:53] praise God
[52:54] let me say like this we're not losing
[52:56] light we're gaining I Amen we're talking
[53:00] about the bride around the world is not
[53:02] losing revelation she's growing in
[53:05] Revelation amen hallelujah brother man
[53:09] calls it the fourth light looking up
[53:12] respirations ride the fourth light
[53:14] because there's four phases and that's
[53:17] what we can grow in and that's where we
[53:19] rejoice and we know the longer were here
[53:22] the more revelation of God the more the
[53:25] Lord that is going to be enlightened to
[53:27] us amen the more a brother Aaron is
[53:31] going to shine upon us because it's it's
[53:33] a type it's a season the Alpha must
[53:37] become Omega amen
[53:39] brother Brahim said thus saith the Lord
[53:41] I will restore the fullness of Pentecost
[53:44] we'll be in the bride amen
[53:47] it has to because it's ordained by God
[53:52] it's a side event of the time and season
[53:55] of the rapture amen
[53:57] our us be church now that's the part we
[54:01] love that's the part we can
[54:03] shouting club and rejoice about but the
[54:05] hard part is that our lives just so our
[54:09] lives go through that fourfold face all
[54:11] the time right
[54:14] that's right church that's why Solomon
[54:18] wrote 28 seasons here because every
[54:22] person is going to go through these
[54:24] cycles right and so you know we see that
[54:30] and whether you know like like garnet
[54:32] peak in 1964 he died at 16 years old and
[54:36] yet brother Ram said he served God's
[54:38] purpose for his life yet we know by the
[54:40] end of his life when God takes him who
[54:43] took him off the seat or when God takes
[54:45] you off the scene will be shining in the
[54:48] brightness of his glory are you with me
[54:50] we will end right because the precious
[54:53] and the cyber Lord is the death of his
[54:55] Saints praise God we know whenever when
[54:59] God took brother branham in 1965 at 56
[55:02] years old he was the shining light he
[55:05] left this earth shining in the glory of
[55:08] the manifestation of Christ in his life
[55:11] he was reflecting the fullness of the
[55:13] light of Christ right there at his time
[55:15] as death wasn't Steven the Oh Lord
[55:20] Steven was so bright that the light was
[55:22] shining his face like an angel and he
[55:25] was shining like a moon in the
[55:27] brightness and the bonus of his life
[55:29] hallelujah amen Paul was so shining at
[55:34] the end he said I know there's a crowd
[55:36] waiting for me and I'll receive it at
[55:39] that day I'm ready to be offered I
[55:41] fought the good fight I've learned the
[55:43] course he's run the course of the
[55:46] manifestations of the light in his life
[55:48] amen
[55:49] he fully reflected all of Christ and so
[55:52] when he went to the grave he there's
[55:54] burning as a full moon amen
[55:56] oh thank you Lord he fulfilled the
[56:01] purpose of God for his life so does that
[56:06] help by God's grace
[56:08] we see this over and over I'm sure
[56:10] brother William seen it in his church
[56:12] you know people be on fire for a while
[56:14] they'll cool off then they'll be on fire
[56:17] again amen I'm sure your pastor
[56:23] sometimes is really on fire another
[56:25] disease just pressing all right we say
[56:29] just keep pressing how you doing and you
[56:31] know when someone's going down
[56:32] how you doing we're just pressing the
[56:34] mass other times you don't even have to
[56:38] ask how you doing Jose because the light
[56:40] of God is shining and glowing and you're
[56:43] coming to church and you're so on fire
[56:44] hi ladies the Lord your desk how they're
[56:47] doing you can see the light shading on
[56:49] them other times they're so down in the
[56:53] scourge other times are they coming to
[56:55] church or not yeah I understand that's
[56:59] it's the cycles of the moon amen and
[57:02] just because someone's just because the
[57:04] moon goes in the dark cycle doesn't mean
[57:07] it's not the moon just because you go
[57:10] through outside doesn't mean you're not
[57:12] the broad Amen the moon the form of God
[57:17] will shine upon you again amen because
[57:23] you keep hanging in your position a man
[57:26] ha ha
[57:27] you can hang in there and you get under
[57:29] the influence of the sand the Sun Jesus
[57:32] Christ
[57:37] god help us to stay in our position
[57:41] help us not to lose leave our position
[57:44] we see we've got to stay in our position
[57:47] and in the time and season that light
[57:50] will magnify itself upon us it's not us
[57:54] producing the light it's the light of
[57:56] Christ hallelujah so see this just
[58:01] opened up to me this morning well now I
[58:03] can see it now all these I'm gonna go
[58:06] back now all these are seasons there's
[58:11] 28 days in a lunar cycle and Solomon
[58:14] wrote 28 different seasons is that a
[58:16] coincidence
[58:18] and yet we can look at all all these and
[58:21] we can say yes I've had this in my life
[58:25] now there's a physical meaning and then
[58:27] there's of course a spiritual meaning as
[58:29] well and we've already gone through he
[58:31] preached these six we preached those six
[58:33] and today we look at seven and eight but
[58:37] just as the moon goes through these
[58:39] phases and it's broken down we know in
[58:42] 28 days you know so you and I go through
[58:47] these as well
[58:48] now I'm gonna skip ahead because I
[58:50] already showed that slide now let's go
[58:53] back here to Genesis 1 God said let
[58:57] there be four lights let there be lights
[58:59] in the firmament that heaven to divide
[59:00] the day from the night let them for
[59:02] signs and for seasons and for days and
[59:04] for years and let them be for lights in
[59:06] the firmament of the heaven to give
[59:07] light upon the earth and it was so God
[59:11] made two great lights the greater light
[59:13] to rule the day and the lesser light to
[59:15] rule the night he made the stars also
[59:21] now let's look at a few I got a few
[59:24] quotes in scriptures here I just was
[59:30] looking at some of the scriptures look
[59:32] at look at Psalms 148 3 praise him ye
[59:35] Sun and Moon praise him all ye stars of
[59:39] light is there ever a time when the moon
[59:41] doesn't praise God
[59:43] no it praises God because it stays there
[59:47] and stays in position brother a minute
[59:51] sometimes it's a lot brighter than other
[59:53] times right sister Brenda sometimes the
[59:55] light is but all the time it's praising
[59:58] God by staying in its place amen God
[1:00:01] wants you to stay in your place amen in
[1:00:03] your local church stay right where God
[1:00:06] placed you little sheep amen stay right
[1:00:09] there stay where God place you if God's
[1:00:10] called you to a gift of miracles stay
[1:00:13] right there
[1:00:13] if God's going to gift a wisdom stay
[1:00:15] right there if he's giving you a gift of
[1:00:18] faith stay right there stay right there
[1:00:20] and then God's season his light will
[1:00:22] shine upon you and while you're waiting
[1:00:25] just praise Him amen just come to church
[1:00:29] to say thank you Jesus
[1:00:31] the moon praise God they got them
[1:00:34] somewhere your economy amen praise Him
[1:00:39] it says praise him to come to church
[1:00:41] praise him in the good times for they
[1:00:43] ain't men sings your favorite songs say
[1:00:45] glory if he doesn't sing your favorite
[1:00:47] song say praise the Lord is that right
[1:00:52] praise them the moon is the praise in
[1:00:56] the Bible said and notice your to rule
[1:00:59] the night the moon rules the night now
[1:01:05] we have some quotes on this will show
[1:01:06] here with brother Branham in just a
[1:01:07] moment why don't I see maybe I'll skip
[1:01:12] ahead and then come back yeah let me
[1:01:14] skip ahead then I'll just come back in
[1:01:16] the beginning he says God he said oh how
[1:01:18] we could base this back if God was
[1:01:20] willing and we had time of the Sun went
[1:01:22] down at night God provided a moon to
[1:01:23] give a lesser light now the moon and the
[1:01:25] Sun are perfectly husband and wife
[1:01:29] husband and wife the moon and the Sun
[1:01:34] our husband not the earth the moon and
[1:01:36] the Sun so the moon revolves around the
[1:01:41] earth but that's the earth and the moon
[1:01:43] are now husband and wife
[1:01:44] right and our lives revolve around this
[1:01:47] earth but it's not who were married to
[1:01:52] our job is to shine the light to the
[1:01:56] rest of the world amen
[1:01:58] that's our job but the a man and sister
[1:02:02] who are sometimes as I got their people
[1:02:03] from the earth people from worldly
[1:02:05] churches look out there and say my a
[1:02:06] minute who are so far out there but
[1:02:09] they're shining the light of God amen
[1:02:11] they can't deny the light that you're
[1:02:13] shining out there and it looks like
[1:02:18] you're married to the earth but you're
[1:02:20] not you're only here to shine the light
[1:02:23] to be a city on a hill a moon up in the
[1:02:25] sky that cannot be hidden amen but
[1:02:29] you're really married to the Sun I love
[1:02:38] the Lord don't you and when the sun goes
[1:02:41] down he says it goes way behind the
[1:02:43] world
[1:02:44] and reflects its light over the moon the
[1:02:46] moon gives a lesser light by night but
[1:02:47] just as Jesus when he was here on earth
[1:02:50] he went away went back up into the
[1:02:54] heavens and reflects back the Holy Ghost
[1:02:58] on the church which is the light in his
[1:03:03] place today perfectly so not you get it
[1:03:08] but him said when Jesus was here he was
[1:03:11] shining the light but Jesus has left so
[1:03:14] it's no longer daytime he said now it's
[1:03:16] nighttime and now in the absence of the
[1:03:20] Sun we reflect the light to this earth
[1:03:23] so what time is it spiritually it's
[1:03:28] nighttime there's about to be a new
[1:03:30] daybreak a man but my idea of the
[1:03:33] seventh day amen
[1:03:35] it's about the bread but it's nighttime
[1:03:37] right now and you and I are the only
[1:03:40] days the Bride of Christ around the
[1:03:43] world in Ghana wherever we are in there
[1:03:46] in Akron what were we are we are the
[1:03:48] light to the world amen in the absence
[1:03:52] of Christ now notice this is important
[1:03:54] Church where's that word lesser a lot of
[1:03:58] people say you know Jesus said greater
[1:04:00] miracles will you need a brother man had
[1:04:02] to correct him it's not greater it means
[1:04:03] more I've heard so many preachers even
[1:04:06] in the message another say oh we're do
[1:04:08] greater works and how can you do greater
[1:04:10] than creation creation is the greatest
[1:04:13] thing you could do because when God made
[1:04:15] Satan he made him everything except
[1:04:17] creator right and he can never create
[1:04:21] the only one that can Korea is God
[1:04:23] creative power that's God apart from
[1:04:26] everybody else amen so you cannot do
[1:04:30] greater than Christ that doesn't mean
[1:04:32] we'll do greater miracles it means we do
[1:04:35] more miracles amen
[1:04:36] you'll never do greater than Christ
[1:04:39] because he was the son but moons light
[1:04:41] will never be greater than the sun's
[1:04:43] light because the moon doesn't produce a
[1:04:46] lot it just reflects the it borrows the
[1:04:48] light amen
[1:04:49] but Jesus is the light he is hallelujah
[1:04:54] he's the birding eternal light of God
[1:04:57] hallelujah and we just burn off for a
[1:05:00] while amen
[1:05:02] see so we got to be careful and remember
[1:05:07] we're less than him and now let me go
[1:05:10] back just a few because the Bible says
[1:05:13] plainly a lot of people worship the moon
[1:05:17] right and he has gone and served other
[1:05:19] gods and worship them either the Sun or
[1:05:21] the moon or any of the hosts of it which
[1:05:22] I'm not coming in got it and tell them
[1:05:24] all the way back there don't you worship
[1:05:26] the moon it's so beautiful it has such a
[1:05:29] glory to it it's such a beautiful light
[1:05:31] but don't worship it don't worship it
[1:05:35] and so the Bible says the way that
[1:05:39] happens mostly is the Bible said we make
[1:05:41] our belly our God so we you would think
[1:05:46] why never worship brother Jose I never I
[1:05:48] would never bow down I never bow down to
[1:05:50] worship brother man I would never do
[1:05:51] that with the that might be true but
[1:05:54] what we gotta be careful of is
[1:05:55] worshipping ourselves because all we see
[1:06:00] all these preachers now it's easy to see
[1:06:02] him preachers but it's it's easy to
[1:06:04] seeing other people too but what they do
[1:06:05] is they sell out the gospel for a meal
[1:06:07] ticket right and what are they doing
[1:06:11] like my brother Simon got the witness a
[1:06:13] pastor and shortened the baptism he saw
[1:06:16] the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:18] and not far the Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:06:19] and he said I would believe it and
[1:06:21] preach it except my retirement is in
[1:06:24] this denomination and Simon set right
[1:06:27] there and told him now Church I'm not
[1:06:29] wishing judgment on this man you know we
[1:06:34] cry out for mercy the bride cries out
[1:06:35] for mercy Father forgive them they don't
[1:06:37] know what they do but if that's not
[1:06:39] repented of them then there's
[1:06:41] consequences because that's a form of
[1:06:43] idolatry you're worshiping your food
[1:06:46] more than worshiping your spiritual food
[1:06:48] they vent you worship in your church
[1:06:50] denomination more than you're worshiping
[1:06:52] the God of Mormon amen and so we we've
[1:06:57] got to be careful too that we don't
[1:06:58] worship the moon in other words Paul
[1:07:01] says oh one of you like the Pylos more
[1:07:03] than Peter and some of you thought well
[1:07:06] I'm better
[1:07:06] Paul was a better preacher than other
[1:07:08] ones now with us a lot of times that
[1:07:09] manifests in preacher worship grace God
[1:07:13] well we think oh if this preacher comes
[1:07:15] we're going to have a revival but we
[1:07:17] know there have said no preacher brings
[1:07:18] revival in his briefcase or on his iPad
[1:07:21] the the only way the revival comes is
[1:07:24] when we're praying in our homes that's
[1:07:27] the boat rev says he said you have to
[1:07:29] create the revival in your home Amen but
[1:07:33] see we go into the idea like whoa
[1:07:35] revival can only come when when this
[1:07:37] sister prays for me or that brother
[1:07:38] braid but that's that's a human worship
[1:07:41] and we must remember not to worship an
[1:07:44] individual we must be a little which
[1:07:46] tools God is going to use but we must
[1:07:49] not give them worship because that's a
[1:07:51] great danger today we worship ourselves
[1:07:53] or he worship other of God's people and
[1:07:55] that's moon worship my he said but
[1:08:06] remember the moon don't give any light
[1:08:10] at all for the Jose I have no light to
[1:08:14] give to you of myself this morning
[1:08:18] the moon does it is still there's
[1:08:20] sunlight on the moon amen that's what
[1:08:22] this today it's not the church is the
[1:08:24] Holy Ghost on the church that does it
[1:08:26] not the church amen so what we have
[1:08:30] special meetings or you go to special
[1:08:32] meetings or we have a special meeting
[1:08:33] right here in our church which give me
[1:08:35] every Sunday I like to like to be an
[1:08:38] advocate for that
[1:08:40] that's my ministry but whenever anything
[1:08:44] good happen Church it wasn't because of
[1:08:46] us it was because of the Lord amen
[1:08:49] Christ visit us he shined a bonus in his
[1:08:53] mercy in his love and it was the season
[1:08:55] for an amen
[1:08:57] all we did sister Wendy was just hanging
[1:09:00] around to the right season came and God
[1:09:03] said this is the season where you get a
[1:09:05] little more light it's gonna roll along
[1:09:08] pretty soon just just stay right down
[1:09:10] your seat Church don't run around me is
[1:09:12] going to and for to around the earth is
[1:09:15] you know it's a famine for the Word of
[1:09:17] God and see that's why they all get
[1:09:20] running to and fro if they would just
[1:09:22] stay in their position God would meet
[1:09:24] them in the humility a better position
[1:09:27] amen
[1:09:28] Baudelaire says if one little planet got
[1:09:31] out of order it would throw off the
[1:09:32] whole system and that's true you can ask
[1:09:35] any Christian scientists they're all
[1:09:36] over YouTube if one if one if the earth
[1:09:41] or Moon moves like half a degree it
[1:09:43] would throw everything off God's got
[1:09:46] everything placed and in that in the
[1:09:48] spiritual that's how Christians are we
[1:09:51] have to be right in our position we
[1:09:52] can't move out of place and try to
[1:09:54] venture a presume into something we wait
[1:09:57] until the light shines and then if we
[1:09:59] know it's Christ showing up it's not the
[1:10:01] church it's the Holy Ghost on the church
[1:10:03] amen oh it's not me it's not you it's
[1:10:09] the Holy Ghost on you and I
[1:10:13] that's God's provide away see not to see
[1:10:16] we can have a million more at forty four
[1:10:17] so see program gives us an idea of
[1:10:19] worshiping the moon oh let's get a
[1:10:23] million let's get a million more members
[1:10:25] in 1954 see that that's a man way to
[1:10:29] exalt the church look what we did I look
[1:10:31] in that so sad they're bragging we're
[1:10:33] gonna get a million converts in one year
[1:10:35] look at us we got a million Congress and
[1:10:37] that's so sad but that's the moon kind
[1:10:40] of bragging on it that's the moon
[1:10:41] bragging on itself and that's when the
[1:10:42] light is waning right that's when the
[1:10:45] that's when the light is leaving the
[1:10:47] church that's something you do you
[1:10:49] magnify yourself that's when the light
[1:10:51] goes that is it our slogan if God will
[1:10:54] add daily to the church such as will be
[1:10:56] saved until that's what the church needs
[1:10:58] today that's what we need today that's
[1:11:00] what we need to get back in God's Way in
[1:11:02] other words we wait in our position
[1:11:04] until God adds to the church and if we
[1:11:09] feel led to go bring somebody in
[1:11:11] then that's God's leading to add to the
[1:11:13] church but we don't sign a manmade
[1:11:16] slogan say we're going to save 10 Souls
[1:11:17] this year we're gonna save a million
[1:11:19] souls you don't sign a man-made thing
[1:11:21] now it's different if you got none saith
[1:11:23] the Lord but if you got those say the
[1:11:25] Lord it'll speak it don't say at the
[1:11:27] Lord but if not you wait upon the Lord
[1:11:29] wait - the light shines and pretty soon
[1:11:32] it will Adams
[1:11:32] and there'll be the holy spirit adding
[1:11:35] to the church the wisdom of God the moon
[1:11:42] the Sun is husband with wife this is a
[1:11:44] different sermon 1954 and one of the Sun
[1:11:46] has gone away it throws its light
[1:11:47] against the moon to give us a smaller
[1:11:49] light until the Sun comes so we got a
[1:11:52] smaller light right we got the amounting
[1:11:56] but it's smaller than Jesus because
[1:11:57] Jesus had the fullness of the Godhead
[1:11:58] bodily and when the Sun comes the moon
[1:12:03] fades out I love look at this beautiful
[1:12:06] mister beautiful and crisis the sinners
[1:12:09] gone to glory and shining on the church
[1:12:12] with the same kind of light he shined
[1:12:14] when he was here and the church is the
[1:12:17] light of the world until Jesus comes and
[1:12:20] it all melts together this is a
[1:12:23] beautiful type like the moonlight and
[1:12:26] the sunlight becomes one light when it
[1:12:29] merges together amen
[1:12:31] how do you ever see that in the morning
[1:12:32] you're driving and the sun's coming up
[1:12:34] but yet the moon's shining real bright
[1:12:36] right there
[1:12:36] oh one of these days brother after the
[1:12:40] Armageddon there's going to come a mill
[1:12:42] together of the two lights the sunlight
[1:12:44] and the moonlight and the Bible calls at
[1:12:47] the Millennium amen amen
[1:12:51] and the lights will come together he
[1:12:53] says becomes one light when it emerges
[1:12:57] together when Christ the church comes
[1:12:59] together at that great millennium they
[1:13:02] merge into one light thank the Lord amen
[1:13:08] this little light of mine I'm gonna let
[1:13:11] it shine I'm gonna let it shine till
[1:13:14] Jesus comes this little light of mine
[1:13:17] and when Jesus comes this little light
[1:13:19] of mine is gonna fade into all your
[1:13:20] lights and we're all gonna be one light
[1:13:23] the light of eternal life what a
[1:13:33] beautiful tight brother Brahim gives us
[1:13:34] there my how striking it is he said
[1:13:38] today we are the light of the world in
[1:13:40] his presence in his absence rather he's
[1:13:42] given you the light to shine with while
[1:13:44] he's here
[1:13:46] while he's here now I think I
[1:13:52] cover that yeah let me see all right so
[1:13:56] let's go next one now let's get a few
[1:13:58] moon statistics now this is where it
[1:14:01] starts breaking into the woman's cycle
[1:14:03] which is just interesting I don't really
[1:14:06] have a lot on that as far as I'm aware
[1:14:08] of but it says the moon solar day is
[1:14:10] about not fully 29 days now science has
[1:14:14] just learned that it's not exactly 29
[1:14:17] days but it's 28 and some change but
[1:14:20] when these commentaries wrote it when
[1:14:23] they didn't have all these science
[1:14:24] instruments they just looked up this 28
[1:14:25] days because they did the best they
[1:14:27] could they couldn't measure you know
[1:14:29] with atomic clocks and atomic watches
[1:14:32] and all the instruments that they have
[1:14:33] today
[1:14:33] so for these thousand years they've
[1:14:35] always thought it's 28 days but now
[1:14:38] science can track it down it's almost 29
[1:14:42] the month is based on the lunation that
[1:14:45] period of which the moon completes a
[1:14:46] cycle of its phases the period lasts
[1:14:52] approximately 29 and a half days and is
[1:14:54] easy to recognize and short enough for
[1:14:56] the days to be counted without using
[1:14:57] large numbers in addition it's very
[1:14:59] close to the average menstrual period of
[1:15:01] women and also to the duration of cyclic
[1:15:04] behavior and submarine creatures so not
[1:15:08] only in the earth but under the earth
[1:15:10] the Seas so god uses this twenty-eight
[1:15:13] to govern the sky the land and the sea
[1:15:15] hey man my mercy thus the moon possess
[1:15:20] great significance and was often the
[1:15:22] governing period for religious
[1:15:24] observances of which the dating of
[1:15:27] Easter is a notable example they would
[1:15:31] have a month-long celebration at Easter
[1:15:34] or they'd have month-long celebrations
[1:15:35] here our month-long celebrations there
[1:15:37] they base that upon the seasons the
[1:15:40] length of season of the moon because
[1:15:43] they saw it going from brightness to
[1:15:44] Darkness brightness the darkness and
[1:15:46] that represented hope amen that's what
[1:15:50] the season represents according to this
[1:15:52] there's this article right here it
[1:15:54] represents hope look what it says next
[1:15:56] menstruation has therefore been
[1:15:58] described as the outward evidence now
[1:16:00] this is from the Britannica
[1:16:02] of the abortive clothes of one cycle and
[1:16:06] the hopeful commencement of the next aim
[1:16:09] ahead so 28 cycle so see we're seeing
[1:16:14] cycles of hope right now you can also
[1:16:18] look at cycles of death and brother here
[1:16:21] no cycles of death and revival does he
[1:16:23] not in the church age book so it's at
[1:16:26] that part can also be encouraging to we
[1:16:28] leave that season of death and we know
[1:16:31] new life comes amen it's a cycle of
[1:16:36] death and a cycle of Hope and God is
[1:16:39] implanted in the woman brother amen not
[1:16:41] the man because the church is like into
[1:16:44] a woman a man and the woman is the one
[1:16:47] who brings forth life all right
[1:16:52] God's design is powerful my goodness
[1:16:59] they have a human menstrual cycle he
[1:17:01] says this I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't
[1:17:05] read that I'm sorry here yeah here's the
[1:17:06] quote it cycles of hope there's a
[1:17:10] Britannic online code so represents hope
[1:17:13] new life praise God
[1:17:16] now it says wikipedia says it's the
[1:17:18] average cyclist 28 days no link has been
[1:17:22] established to the night lighting of the
[1:17:24] moon now as far as they know right but
[1:17:28] we know God has 28 seasons that are
[1:17:30] linked to the bride praise God and each
[1:17:35] of the cycles the moon cycle the woman's
[1:17:37] cycle lets everyone know that the bride
[1:17:40] is in cycle with Christ amen Olivia
[1:17:44] that's right now I want to lay a few
[1:17:49] things in here because we all go through
[1:17:54] seasons
[1:17:55] and so God sends a pastor to watch over
[1:17:58] your soul and that watch means to be
[1:18:01] sleepless keep awake watch on isn't that
[1:18:04] perfect the pastors and ministers have
[1:18:06] to stay awake all night because it's
[1:18:08] nighttime
[1:18:09] well everybody sleeps pastor will stay
[1:18:12] up watching now I don't say up all night
[1:18:15] if I did I'd bout die
[1:18:17] spiritually the God that God has to
[1:18:20] annoy a pastor let me say like this he
[1:18:23] can stay up a little longer can I just
[1:18:24] say like that did because he asked me it
[1:18:27] would be sleepless which I'm not I gotta
[1:18:29] have my 7 hours or I'm about done and
[1:18:32] keep awake and watch for your souls
[1:18:36] right he's got to be able to watch it so
[1:18:39] God has to give him space but not only a
[1:18:49] pastor the Bible said that Cain was had
[1:18:53] the evil spirit because he was not his
[1:18:55] brother's keeper okay so not only you
[1:19:00] don't do preachers have to watch and
[1:19:03] watch how everybody's you know in the
[1:19:05] season that they're in the Bible says
[1:19:07] now this is the scripture let us hold
[1:19:09] fast the profession of our faith without
[1:19:10] wavering he's faithful the promise let
[1:19:12] us consider one another to provoke them
[1:19:14] under loading it works
[1:19:15] the next scriptures gather gather more
[1:19:17] she's healing the approaching church
[1:19:18] attendance so in the context of this
[1:19:22] God's people are going to be able to
[1:19:24] watch over each other more as they come
[1:19:27] to church and when we come we come and
[1:19:30] we come thinking about someone else now
[1:19:33] we come to give God glory to shine a
[1:19:35] light and to praise Him but part of
[1:19:38] praising him is being concerned about
[1:19:40] everyone else let us consider one
[1:19:46] another to provoke that means to inspire
[1:19:49] or stir up one another to love and good
[1:19:52] works so in that beautiful sometimes you
[1:19:55] know we know I'll come to church and
[1:19:57] maybe I'm shining the light of God and
[1:19:59] it's encouraging you it's inspiring you
[1:20:01] brother Aaron are walking here and he's
[1:20:03] worshiping God and it'll stir you up and
[1:20:05] inspire you for the Amen was singing and
[1:20:07] crying worship or Malachi will pluck and
[1:20:09] play and he'll seek and it'll inspire
[1:20:11] you that's what the Bible said see we
[1:20:15] come in church and we know we have a
[1:20:17] dual responsibility I threaten the
[1:20:19] threefold responsibility our
[1:20:20] responsibility to come here for God for
[1:20:22] ourselves and to everyone else amen so
[1:20:27] when I come to church believe I'm not
[1:20:28] just coming for me
[1:20:30] I am coming for me but I'm coming to
[1:20:32] praise God and I'm coming to inspire and
[1:20:34] stir others up to encourage them that
[1:20:37] their time in season will return ma it
[1:20:42] will just stay right there just stay
[1:20:45] right in position but light of God we're
[1:20:47] returning but you have to stay in
[1:20:52] position because Cain was a wandering
[1:20:54] star the Bible said wondered from place
[1:20:58] that he's like a shooting star we kickin
[1:21:02] it he can stay in position but you must
[1:21:07] stay in position and shine the light of
[1:21:10] God see that does that help hope that
[1:21:13] helps by God's grace now brother Branham
[1:21:16] notices at the end of his life he saw
[1:21:19] brothers out in the desert drying
[1:21:21] spiritually and it concerned him he said
[1:21:26] I know each one of you you feel like I
[1:21:28] do I'm so hungry to see the spear of God
[1:21:30] movie
[1:21:30] I just can't hardly stand it some
[1:21:32] experiences I just had up in the
[1:21:33] mountain just to feel that once again
[1:21:35] that's something that was when I was
[1:21:37] first saying was so glorious in my heart
[1:21:38] amen church what he's talking what is he
[1:21:40] talking about he's talking about the
[1:21:41] marriage in divorce the last time he was
[1:21:43] up there if you go back was when he got
[1:21:45] the revelation on the marriage of
[1:21:47] divorcing him hey folks about God coming
[1:21:48] down the mountain they stopped school to
[1:21:50] come out and see it they have people on
[1:21:52] the gas station rounds up there a year
[1:21:56] before then he got the king shore
[1:21:58] he's talking about experiences up in the
[1:22:01] mountain everybody so here he is in 63
[1:22:05] and 64 he's 54 and 55 years old and God
[1:22:11] makes him feel like when he was first
[1:22:14] Saved amen God let him go through a
[1:22:17] season where he comes back with a winner
[1:22:20] and he just don't feel like he's got a
[1:22:21] little light he feels like he's full
[1:22:24] bloom he's fully shining he's fully
[1:22:26] declaring the glory of God amen hey
[1:22:31] thank the Lord at 54 and 55 years old if
[1:22:39] he just stays in position never saying
[1:22:41] try to get him out of position say move
[1:22:43] up in those
[1:22:43] and just you steal away from everybody
[1:22:45] they don't hear your preaching just get
[1:22:47] away okay I was about ready to do that
[1:22:50] Saint was about ready to get him out of
[1:22:52] position
[1:22:53] but God's grace intervene while he's
[1:22:55] driving a car oh my god speak to us
[1:22:58] where we're driving our cars today when
[1:23:01] we're in a restaurant today

[1:23:12] dating Peregrine and he's saying oh I

[1:23:16] so he's experienced up in the mountain
[1:23:18] it was so glorious to my heart and we
[1:23:23] come to a place we can sit and see it

[1:24:13] Diggs walk into a hospital appointment
[1:24:15] and they say look it says diabetes and
[1:24:18] says he says no I don't and God heard

[1:26:11] we're drying he'll send a little water
[1:26:12] your way yeah battery switch the
[1:26:22] batteries yeah I can do that that's
[1:26:24] another thing I like to do while
[1:26:25] preaching I can switch the babies now
[1:26:27] look at rotor and Sadie they're drying
[1:26:29] out Church look at that hope you can see
[1:26:33] that he was
[1:26:38] watching the seasons of people's lives
[1:26:40] okay that says I begin to feel all us a
[1:26:44] reclining look at this reclining
[1:26:47] decreasing just like the moon yeah are
[1:26:52] they not bright does he condemn them
[1:26:54] brother Perry's churches say you'll
[1:26:56] never have a revival sister Karen was
[1:26:58] there did you have revival at the church
[1:27:00] let's say praise the Lord so I'm in 65
[1:27:05] they were reclining but when sister
[1:27:08] Karen was there there was years in the
[1:27:10] 80s 90s and the early 2000s where the
[1:27:13] God sent an increase amen amen
[1:27:17] an incline not a decline and in trot see
[1:27:21] God goes through seasons the thing to do
[1:27:23] is don't be critical stay in your
[1:27:25] position and wait for God's light to
[1:27:27] shine back on you amen praise God I
[1:27:32] begin to see reclining getting away from
[1:27:34] the what what Perry greens church
[1:27:38] getting away from the spirit now he
[1:27:41] might not even be talking about the
[1:27:42] church but he's talking about brothers
[1:27:43] out there in Arizona I'm not sure I mean
[1:27:45] it's hard to read into this one but he
[1:27:47] was talking to brothers and he go tried
[1:27:48] to discern them and say are you getting
[1:27:50] closer to God you getting drier are you
[1:27:52] getting more moist and they're striking
[1:27:58] it's become too natural thing to us
[1:28:01] see churches becomes that's just church
[1:28:03] time great I'll just go to church and
[1:28:07] instead something else becomes greater
[1:28:09] like my golf game oh I can't wait I'll
[1:28:11] get up at 6 a.m. to go get my golf game
[1:28:13] on now I don't golf but I'm not
[1:28:15] condemning golf it's just like Taekwondo
[1:28:17] or whatever anything that takes the
[1:28:19] place of God's an idol yep yep oh damn
[1:28:22] said God gave me a sport where I can
[1:28:24] glorify God in it look up those words
[1:28:26] God gave me a sport but man said which
[1:28:28] was hunting so they were getting away we
[1:28:34] must worship in the spirit not only our
[1:28:36] message to be the flame of the ours
[1:28:37] should be the flame in our hearts so the
[1:28:40] problem is with our hearts and that has
[1:28:43] to be our minds not our soul because if
[1:28:46] you've got to seal the Holy Ghost you're
[1:28:47] sealed to the day of your redemption in
[1:28:49] your soul
[1:28:50] your souls not fluctuating your souls a
[1:28:53] concept burning fire galavant hallelujah
[1:28:56] with your human spirit that fluctuates
[1:29:00] decrease increase decrease in ink
[1:29:04] sometimes like thinking about God other
[1:29:06] times I'd rather do other things
[1:29:07] sometimes and I'm back in the back and
[1:29:09] just like the moon but just like they're
[1:29:12] moving back and forth back and forth
[1:29:14] back and forth
[1:29:17] it's got to be in our hearts we can't
[1:29:19] rightly present to the people the Spirit
[1:29:21] has to pack the message yourself and I'm
[1:29:22] trusting and believing and every one of
[1:29:24] you to be a real Christian now I'm just
[1:29:28] gonna give a few brief examples because
[1:29:30] I know I'm let me said timer
[1:29:32] give me 15 more minutes now I just want
[1:29:38] to say a few examples here let me go the
[1:29:40] next slide okay yeah yeah this is
[1:29:43] perfect glory John 16:13 hobby it when
[1:29:46] he the spirit of truth is come he will
[1:29:47] guide you in all truth humming no
[1:29:48] program said this is the evidence of the
[1:29:50] Holy Ghost let me know that this is in
[1:29:52] the church age book guiding you into all
[1:29:55] the truth or the revealed word of your
[1:29:57] day is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:58] now speaking in tongues not shaking a
[1:30:01] hand not anything else not any miracle
[1:30:05] but you receiving more and more of the
[1:30:07] word for he shall not speak of himself
[1:30:10] what's every show here that same shall
[1:30:12] he speak and he'll show you things to
[1:30:13] come he shall glorify me so the Holy
[1:30:17] Ghost would cause you to glorify the
[1:30:18] high priest for each to receive a mind
[1:30:22] and showed unto you so I just thought of
[1:30:26] a few examples you can be a born again
[1:30:30] moon bride member and go through seasons
[1:30:36] where you decrease in your growth with
[1:30:38] God that's true I got I got two examples
[1:30:44] you know the easiest one to see is in
[1:30:45] Galatians 2 we probably well let's just
[1:30:48] go there anyway I'll just give you one
[1:30:49] example with with Peter Peter you know
[1:30:52] bless his heart
[1:30:54] people call him custom preacher he sings
[1:30:56] like that but that's all before the Holy
[1:30:58] Ghost amen
[1:31:00] he's a real soldier and you know I'll
[1:31:03] say this I'm not half
[1:31:04] I'm not a tenth of the man he is or
[1:31:06] maybe in a hundred the man he was but
[1:31:10] let's see glaciers - this guy got so
[1:31:14] into the the season of decrease can I
[1:31:16] say like that he got into such a season
[1:31:20] of decrease that he wouldn't even eat
[1:31:22] with the Gentiles
[1:31:23] can you imagine sister Karen or sister
[1:31:26] Brenda going to church fellowship and
[1:31:28] you won't even sit at the same table
[1:31:29] somebody in here could you imagine that
[1:31:32] like you and even you'd say no I'm not
[1:31:34] sitting with Jose today Jose said hey
[1:31:37] guys come sit at the table no you got
[1:31:39] your own table over there it's the
[1:31:42] glasses table go sit with the guys with
[1:31:44] glasses like brother Jesse yeah whatever
[1:31:47] whatever reason you know they would give
[1:31:49] to discriminate but Peter was decreasing
[1:31:53] in the things of God because he got a
[1:31:57] spirit of discrimination on him I'm not
[1:32:00] sure which one maybe pride might be it's
[1:32:02] probably pride because want to be a lust
[1:32:04] it probably a pride toe Galatians 2 you
[1:32:07] know the scripture let's just jump ahead
[1:32:14] there
[1:32:16] verse 11 places to 11 and when Peter was
[1:32:20] come to a neck I was send to the face
[1:32:22] because he was to be blamed Wow a Holy
[1:32:25] Ghost filled preacher at the same time
[1:32:27] God's guiding in the minutes Ruth now in
[1:32:29] this case how is God guiding him in
[1:32:31] truth he's sending somebody to correct
[1:32:33] him amen praise God
[1:32:37] how does God you got his dad got you and
[1:32:39] me and it's Ruth there's times we have
[1:32:42] to be corrected amen
[1:32:44] it didn't make him not the moon by the
[1:32:46] way he was still the moon he was still
[1:32:48] the spokesman on the day of Pentecost
[1:32:50] glory he's still preaching 3,000 souls
[1:32:53] got baptized on the day of Pentecost
[1:32:56] glory he's still a man that won't throw
[1:32:59] water
[1:33:00] he's still the man that he would just
[1:33:02] pass and his shadow where's my shadow
[1:33:04] must be right under me well there it is
[1:33:08] it's kind of on Wendy there so this
[1:33:09] channel hood crossover Wendy and he be
[1:33:12] and she be healed that's the kind of man
[1:33:14] this was but yet he was a moon
[1:33:18] member to and his life went through
[1:33:21] seasons of difficulty too and he was the
[1:33:26] very man brother amen and went up there
[1:33:28] in the corneas his house corneas
[1:33:29] bouncing oh oh you've come I come to
[1:33:32] wish me he said get up man don't do that
[1:33:34] I'm just a man like you
[1:33:36] God's not a respecter of persons and God
[1:33:38] sent Jesus and I said the Holy Ghost
[1:33:40] and while Peter spake on the house the
[1:33:42] Holy Ghost fell on them their herd to
[1:33:44] learn hey Cornelius a Gentile some were
[1:33:47] rejoicing speaking of dogs barbicide
[1:33:49] glorified they're the same man they saw
[1:33:53] the Holy Ghost fallen Gentiles pretty
[1:33:55] soon said I don't even want to eat with
[1:33:56] you brother amen the same man
[1:33:59] why church because he goes through
[1:34:01] seasons he's constantly increasing or
[1:34:06] he's constantly decreasing may God help
[1:34:09] our seasons of decrease to be shorter I
[1:34:11] know how he does that but he can do that
[1:34:13] he's God verse 12 for before that
[1:34:19] certain came from James he didn't eat
[1:34:22] with the Gentiles that when they were
[1:34:23] come he would ruin separate himself
[1:34:26] fearing them which were of the
[1:34:27] circumcision so be kinda like this it'd
[1:34:29] be like if we had brother Diggs here
[1:34:30] last week and I and I and I knew brother
[1:34:34] Diggs was here and before when both
[1:34:37] Diggs was in here I could eat with Amen
[1:34:38] all the time we'd fellowship you know
[1:34:39] but when beau Diggs came oh well I'm not
[1:34:42] gonna eat with Amen because I told
[1:34:44] brother dig some things about Amen
[1:34:45] everybody a man's like why won't you sit
[1:34:47] with me
[1:34:47] why don't you talk with me well you all
[1:34:49] need to shake my hand and that's what a
[1:34:51] Holy Ghost filled preacher was doing
[1:34:53] Church can you imagine it a Holy Ghost
[1:34:55] filled preacher one week he'd sit there
[1:34:58] and say praise the Lord thank you let's
[1:35:00] feast together
[1:35:01] you're not unclean you're clean we all
[1:35:02] say it but then when a guest preachers
[1:35:04] come I can't eat with you let's come
[1:35:06] over here let's see let's all you over
[1:35:08] here at our table we're not gonna eat
[1:35:10] over there a Holy Ghost fill man say
[1:35:13] brother just do Christians decrease yeah
[1:35:15] we're at right here right here I hear in
[1:35:19] their minds not your soul the Bible
[1:35:21] never says your resealed to the day of
[1:35:23] your dungeon
[1:35:24] there's not two baptisms the Holy Ghost
[1:35:26] there's only one baptism of the Holy
[1:35:27] Ghost
[1:35:28] if you want to refilling of the Holy
[1:35:30] Ghost that's right here in your mind
[1:35:32] because you can't get a refilling in
[1:35:33] your soul because it's sealed until it's
[1:35:37] sealed until it's the downpayment until
[1:35:40] the rest of the payment comes with the
[1:35:42] new body amen when you say I want to
[1:35:45] refill your Holy Ghost what you mean is
[1:35:47] you want your attitudes your desires and
[1:35:50] all your thoughts clean out by the Holy
[1:35:52] Ghost scrub down real hard with one of
[1:35:55] those art brushes and then pour it in
[1:35:57] and fill with the line of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:59] amen
[1:36:00] so you think the right way you act the
[1:36:03] right way you start saying the right
[1:36:05] things because you got a born-again
[1:36:07] experience now in your mind not your
[1:36:10] soul there you will not find the
[1:36:13] scripture to be resealed in the soul
[1:36:15] that's what you're asking for and Jesus
[1:36:18] told the fusion church how to do it he
[1:36:20] said if you want your first love go do
[1:36:22] your first works at Toledo I might have
[1:36:27] told you this I had a young mother I saw
[1:36:29] her with the kids church before the
[1:36:30] service she walked her little family in
[1:36:32] there so you know her husband was there
[1:36:33] she walked a little family there from
[1:36:34] Sunday school taking care of all these
[1:36:35] kids and she comes up crying the officer
[1:36:37] she said brother Jessie I just want to
[1:36:38] be refilled with the Holy Ghost I
[1:36:40] thought my goodness
[1:36:41] and you know I was kind of tempted to
[1:36:44] try and think of something big right
[1:36:45] though that's the Holy Spirit just
[1:36:46] brought that little thought there about
[1:36:47] the first love I said sister I wasn't
[1:36:51] trying you know don't give your children
[1:36:53] attention I said you're gonna give your
[1:36:55] children the same amount of attention
[1:36:56] but now it's all going to be in love and
[1:36:58] your mind is going to be off anything
[1:37:01] outside the word it's just gonna be on
[1:37:02] your husband your home and your children
[1:37:05] and think of and I said think about what
[1:37:07] you did when you first got the Holy
[1:37:08] Ghost she went like this is our thinking
[1:37:09] and then she smiled at me and I said you
[1:37:13] go do those first works and God will
[1:37:15] fill you with a refilling of the Holy
[1:37:16] Ghost amen and she you know she was
[1:37:19] crying worshiping their praise the Lord
[1:37:21] a man she can't neglect her children and
[1:37:25] say she's got a new born again
[1:37:26] experience she can't neglect her husband
[1:37:28] and say well born again I got a refill
[1:37:30] Eagle O'Neal she can't do that she's got
[1:37:32] to keep on all of the previous works she
[1:37:35] has to keep all the responsibilities of
[1:37:36] God but she does it with a new desire
[1:37:39] and more thoughts
[1:37:41] my god she does it with the heart of
[1:37:43] love she's won the battlefield of the
[1:37:46] mind and now her mind she's no longer
[1:37:49] feeling guilty well I just can't do
[1:37:53] nothing I've always got to watch after
[1:37:54] my children I always got to wash the
[1:37:56] clothes you know all those guilty
[1:37:57] thoughts Satan throws in the women's
[1:37:59] minds but that's wrong that's what God
[1:38:01] called them to do praise God and they
[1:38:04] can do it they just need to return what
[1:38:06] was my first worst what was my attitude
[1:38:08] what were my words like when I first got
[1:38:10] married when I had my first child when I
[1:38:12] received my first child my second child
[1:38:14] I was so thankful so happy returned and
[1:38:17] knew those works in abroad and prepared
[1:38:19] and the light of God will increase on
[1:38:22] your life amen amen
[1:38:25] see Peter never stopped being guided in
[1:38:28] the truth he was still in that pattern
[1:38:33] but he had to endure the decreasing of
[1:38:36] light and the increasing of light in
[1:38:42] that striking look at verse 13 and other
[1:38:46] Jews dissembled likewise with him
[1:38:47] so Peter wasn't just it wasn't just
[1:38:49] Peter well everybody else will
[1:38:51] fellowship with amen
[1:38:52] just not Peter no Peter was saying hey
[1:38:54] Wendy Jason Jose everybody just leave
[1:38:56] brother amen just come over here let's
[1:38:58] all work let's all eat with the preacher
[1:38:59] the Jewish preacher over here he was
[1:39:02] influencing people in the local church
[1:39:05] he was basically starting a the
[1:39:08] preliminaries of a church split but
[1:39:11] thank God
[1:39:12] God sent a man full of truth in there
[1:39:14] God said Paul said Peter you're the
[1:39:17] bishop you're to be blamed and we know
[1:39:23] by history he got straightened out right
[1:39:24] because he's a faithful down to the end
[1:39:26] so much so he's been crucified upside
[1:39:28] down nah look at verse 14 but when I saw
[1:39:31] that they walked not uprightly according
[1:39:32] to the truth of the gospel I send my
[1:39:34] Peter before them all the before them
[1:39:35] all now how many of you love God so much
[1:39:39] how many of you trust God and preachers
[1:39:42] so much that you wouldn't mind if a
[1:39:46] preacher came up here and got under the
[1:39:49] anointing and called you out in front of
[1:39:52] everybody
[1:39:54] how many of you love God that you'd say
[1:39:57] well praise the Lord
[1:39:58] if that's the I will let thy will be
[1:40:00] done I want to be open to that right
[1:40:04] because Paul did it in front of
[1:40:07] everybody if thou being a jew live us
[1:40:11] after the manner of the gentiles and do
[1:40:12] not as the jews why compels tell the
[1:40:14] gentiles to live as the jews why are you
[1:40:19] trying to get the jews to live like
[1:40:20] Gentiles and why you we're all one
[1:40:22] Paul says we're all one in Christ Jesus
[1:40:24] we're all one and if people have their
[1:40:27] liberties like their holy days or their
[1:40:29] third their veggies vegetarian diets the
[1:40:32] Bible said in all those things just give
[1:40:33] thanks let them have their difference
[1:40:35] but don't separate fellowship don't
[1:40:37] don't discriminate and don't make two
[1:40:40] different camps we're all one body we're
[1:40:43] all one family let me I got three
[1:40:48] minutes here let me close here praise
[1:40:51] the Lord in that good church and that
[1:40:53] good the other one we don't know we
[1:40:55] don't see a lot of this but let's go to
[1:40:56] Roman's 6 Paul is such an amazing
[1:41:00] character in the Bible and I'm not
[1:41:04] exalting him I'm just thanking the Lord
[1:41:07] for him I'm thinking the Lord that God
[1:41:08] allowed us to see so much of his life
[1:41:13] Romans chapter 6 now I'd like to go
[1:41:25] I'm sorry it's Romans chapter 7 Church
[1:41:27] I'm sorry verse 10 now these are from
[1:41:30] err scriptures but look at it in the
[1:41:32] light now of where we are in this season
[1:41:35] series this is this purpose series look
[1:41:38] at the light and the commandment which
[1:41:41] was ordained to life I found to be unto
[1:41:44] death for sin taking occasion by the
[1:41:47] commandment to see me and by its looming
[1:41:49] wherefore the law is holy and the
[1:41:51] commandment holy and just and good was
[1:41:53] then that which is good made death unto
[1:41:55] me god forbid but sin that it might
[1:41:57] appear sin working death and me by that
[1:41:59] which is good that sin by the
[1:42:01] commandment might become exceeding
[1:42:02] sinful for we know that the law is
[1:42:05] spiritual and I am carnal sold under sin
[1:42:07] for that which I do I allow not for what
[1:42:11] I would that I do not but that I hate
[1:42:15] that I do now we don't know the details
[1:42:19] but I'm sure Peter hated what he was
[1:42:22] doing the whole time he just got under a
[1:42:24] spirit right in his mind but in his soul
[1:42:27] he must have known this whole time I
[1:42:29] hate this why am i separating why am I
[1:42:32] making our group look better than
[1:42:35] somebody else's group now Paul was the
[1:42:37] same way now I don't have it up here
[1:42:38] Paul is the same way but the Amen he
[1:42:40] broke God's commands and he hated that
[1:42:42] he did it he hated sister Wendy that the
[1:42:46] the full moon wasn't shining in the
[1:42:48] light of God he hated that part of it
[1:42:51] was waning wasn't getting brighter it's
[1:42:57] getting darker he hated that he said I
[1:43:01] want to do good but then I do that thing
[1:43:03] which I hate if then I do it that's I'm
[1:43:07] sorry and then I do that which I would
[1:43:09] not I can sentence in law that is good
[1:43:11] but then it's no more either do with it
[1:43:12] but sin that dwells within me hey hey
[1:43:15] man praise God Alleluia so Paul he says
[1:43:19] I have to recognize there's three parts
[1:43:21] of me and the part that sinning is not
[1:43:23] my soul is not the real me it's my mind
[1:43:26] and my flesh for I know that in me that
[1:43:30] is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing
[1:43:34] for the to will is present with me but
[1:43:37] how to perform that which is good
[1:43:38] I find not for the good that would I I
[1:43:42] would I do not but the evil I would not
[1:43:44] that I do now Paul was the man sister
[1:43:46] Wendy who worked harder than anybody
[1:43:48] else in the whole gospel he said he said
[1:43:52] by the grace of God I labored more than
[1:43:54] all the Apostles but not i but the grace
[1:43:57] that was given unto me i think history
[1:44:03] said he had a 32-year ministry so he did
[1:44:06] more than 32 years than all the others
[1:44:09] did in their lifetime and now remember
[1:44:11] john had to sixty years so at least at
[1:44:14] that time paul had more ministry than
[1:44:18] even john the one that loved Jesus that
[1:44:22] laid in his bosom but Paul said it
[1:44:24] wasn't I that labored but it was the
[1:44:27] grace of God that was in me but now just
[1:44:30] with that thought just stay with me just
[1:44:31] few more minutes there was my timer in
[1:44:36] all that he did and all of you to
[1:44:38] accomplish Paul sang here I could have
[1:44:41] done more I could have done more I
[1:44:46] wanted to do something good became it I
[1:44:48] wanted to give up that book I wanted to
[1:44:50] give out that Bible I wanted to talk
[1:44:52] about William random with this person
[1:44:53] but I hate that I did it how many ever
[1:44:57] been through that I do it all the time
[1:44:59] yesterday I wanted I wouldn't take some
[1:45:01] books of somebody I forgot why did I do
[1:45:03] that I hate that I just forget but this
[1:45:08] is speaking of sin when there's a sin
[1:45:10] there and righteousness
[1:45:11] sometimes Paul would choose the sin
[1:45:13] that's not increasing that's decreasing
[1:45:18] but was he still bride yeah Jesus called
[1:45:23] him by name Saul saw I'm gonna change
[1:45:26] you from the power darkness to the power
[1:45:27] of light and you're gonna be a light and
[1:45:29] a witness to me throughout all the world
[1:45:33] verse 19 for
[1:45:38] good that I would I do not but the evil
[1:45:39] that I which I would not that I do now
[1:45:42] if I do that I would not it is no more
[1:45:44] either do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[1:45:45] I find then the law that when I would do
[1:45:49] good evil is present with me for I
[1:45:50] delight in the law of the inward man but
[1:45:52] I see another law in my members warring
[1:45:54] against the law of my mind and bringing
[1:45:55] me in this captivity to the law of sin
[1:45:58] which is in my members look at this
[1:45:59] church Paul says I come into captivity
[1:46:02] can you imagine Paul walking the church
[1:46:04] with change on spiritually now how many
[1:46:08] of us ever coming like that you can't
[1:46:09] raise your hands the right way can't
[1:46:11] sing and can't clap cuz your you're
[1:46:13] chained up and Paul said I want to do
[1:46:16] good I want to go to church I want to do
[1:46:18] these things but I'm chained up because
[1:46:20] of my own lusts because there are
[1:46:22] seasons where I get chained up and I
[1:46:25] know there's two laws I can either be
[1:46:27] free and rejoice or I can be chained up
[1:46:30] and do the things that I hate that my
[1:46:32] flesh hates I'm sorry I'm sorry that my
[1:46:34] soul hates but my flesh loves hey said I
[1:46:37] mean you're doing one or the other I'm
[1:46:39] either increasing or I'm decreasing but
[1:46:43] he's still in the cycle of God he's
[1:46:45] still in the plan of God he's still the
[1:46:48] moon he still the spokesperson to the
[1:46:50] Gentiles amen
[1:46:51] he's still the first church age
[1:46:53] messenger but he has to experience these
[1:46:56] seasons you know why so he can minister
[1:46:58] to somebody else you say brother Jason I
[1:47:02] know what it's like to be tempted in
[1:47:04] that area
[1:47:04] I know what it was like I went through a
[1:47:06] dark time of my life I went through time
[1:47:12] where I got a little cold on God did you
[1:47:16] know the moon on the backside where
[1:47:18] there's no light you know it's negative
[1:47:20] 240 degrees on the backside but brother
[1:47:24] hey men on the other side it's like over
[1:47:25] over 270 degrees Fahrenheit so the moon
[1:47:30] at all times glory it's got utter
[1:47:34] coldness and then extreme heat just like
[1:47:39] you and I right in one side of us brain
[1:47:42] in the spiritual side we've got the
[1:47:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:47:46] and we're really walk in obedience
[1:47:49] there's the light of God is burning it
[1:47:51] on
[1:47:52] right our souls and spirits are filled
[1:47:54] with the things of God
[1:47:55] but in our flesh he said that evil is
[1:47:57] present with me all the time so one side
[1:48:00] he's burning up another side he's so
[1:48:02] cold and so cool he can't he can never
[1:48:05] get that side to warm up oh hi god help
[1:48:10] us Church this into our feet
[1:48:11] let's say into our feet it's a law on
[1:48:16] one side he's got the light of God on
[1:48:18] another side darkness he said oil
[1:48:23] wretched man a wonderful bride member
[1:48:26] that I am no he never exhausts himself
[1:48:27] like that see he always realized I'm
[1:48:30] lesser I must decrease and he must
[1:48:36] increase amen I'm the lesser light I'm a
[1:48:41] little or light but I'm still light I
[1:48:44] can still be a light for Christ cook
[1:48:51] should deliver me from this body of this
[1:48:53] death I thank God Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:48:58] so then with the mind here's a man who
[1:49:01] was born again he healed people on the
[1:49:03] item of Malita healed everyone on that
[1:49:05] island a man felt a little boy fell from
[1:49:09] a three-story building he died he raised
[1:49:11] him up right there
[1:49:12] and yet he's still saying this I live in
[1:49:16] a body of death there's times I hate
[1:49:19] what I do I know it's wrong I know it's
[1:49:20] in I know it's less but I do it anyway
[1:49:23] I hate that but then the same man says
[1:49:27] be renewed day by day
[1:49:29] in the spirit of your mind hey be
[1:49:33] transformed by the perfect will of God
[1:49:35] amen and that transform means to be
[1:49:38] transfigured like on Mount
[1:49:39] Transfiguration let your mind be
[1:49:42] transfigured like Christ was
[1:49:44] transfigured on Mount on Mount
[1:49:46] Transfiguration
[1:49:47] can everybody catch that now see why
[1:49:50] your mind I hope you can see it say but
[1:49:53] any men in Malachi want you come see why
[1:49:55] your mind is so important this is the
[1:50:00] part
[1:50:01] you've got to let the light of God shine
[1:50:02] on that's why that's why I wonder since
[1:50:04] 20 all the time why these the man just
[1:50:05] come on here and all the time they
[1:50:06] preach speak the word speak the word
[1:50:08] speak the word meditate on the word why
[1:50:10] do they why the man just always do that
[1:50:12] because they're they're supposed to
[1:50:14] start fires buttom and so they're
[1:50:16] supposed to go into a city and start a
[1:50:18] fire well if you're not speaking the
[1:50:20] word you don't have any fire in your
[1:50:21] mouth you have any fire in your life and
[1:50:24] then evangelist come in to speak speak
[1:50:26] to everyone says it Joe Adams bender odd
[1:50:29] contradicts all the villagers speak to
[1:50:32] wash make the way have you noticed that
[1:50:36] too
[1:50:37] because we just go the seasons of hot
[1:50:40] and cold hey God always sends him at the
[1:50:43] right time doesn't Oh glory that lie the
[1:50:48] only shines it always gets right when
[1:50:51] that word comes at that right season
[1:50:53] it's always right on time I thank the
[1:50:59] Lord for that don't you Church I think
[1:51:06] I'll stop right Darren will finish pick
[1:51:07] up on that tonight with our heads bowed
[1:51:11] let's just bow our heads for a moment
[1:51:12] here this is fresh church a lot of this
[1:51:14] just came to me this morning I went
[1:51:16] looked I heard a sermon a few years ago
[1:51:17] I went looked up a few notes on that
[1:51:19] about the moon but this thought as I
[1:51:22] watched that video I watched that video
[1:51:23] this morning of the Moon it's going
[1:51:25] through its fate I thought that's me
[1:51:27] sometimes I'm shocked and so put it in
[1:51:29] my mind church and then I can mean it
[1:51:33] seemed like so dark
[1:51:34] other times why and I think why why do
[1:51:39] you love us God and the scripture says
[1:51:41] it's four times and seasons there's a
[1:51:45] purpose Peter had to know what it was
[1:51:48] like to divide the church so that he
[1:51:50] could have mercy on those who would
[1:51:51] divide the church other times he's a
[1:51:53] young pastor so he he he he uh he falls
[1:51:58] he decreases in the spirit of dissension
[1:52:00] division and then later on in history he
[1:52:04] can try to unite people say I know what
[1:52:06] that's like I've been there I got that
[1:52:09] spirit on me one time but by the grace
[1:52:12] of God the light of God to fight in that
[1:52:15] darkness right it sent away the darkness
[1:52:18] because there's no darkness where
[1:52:19] there's light now let's just meditate on
[1:52:23] your life just for a moment churches
[1:52:24] look at your life
[1:52:26] I'm sure the word has touched your heart
[1:52:28] like it's touch money praise God
[1:52:33] thank you Jesus in times like this
[1:52:42] church I don't know if you're in the
[1:52:43] increasing stage or the decreasing now
[1:52:47] my own guess is the pastor we're
[1:52:49] probably decreasing because we had so
[1:52:50] many good healings this fall and winter
[1:52:52] I haven't heard of any healings lately
[1:52:54] you don't usually get healings when
[1:52:56] there's Bibles going on but we could be
[1:53:00] the other one I've gone through quite a
[1:53:03] few battles this week feel like I'm in
[1:53:07] this decreasing stage but the light of
[1:53:11] God has come Church
[1:53:12] boy the line of God is came to restore
[1:53:17] the brightness in your life let me say
[1:53:21] Lord Jesus how many would stray share
[1:53:23] their prayer and say Lord Jesus be with
[1:53:25] me in this season may your life return
[1:53:29] to me soon now Church you and I know
[1:53:34] that light returns as soon as we repent
[1:53:37] aim ahead glory the season will turn as
[1:53:41] soon as you and I say I'm sorry Lord let
[1:53:44] me do the first one to get how many
[1:53:45] would say lord help me to do the first
[1:53:47] works help me Jesus Lord we're honest
[1:53:52] this morning or we all go through
[1:53:53] decreasing and increasing times it
[1:53:55] doesn't mean we're not the bride in fact
[1:53:57] it does show that we are the bride
[1:53:59] because we can shine so bright amen but
[1:54:03] then Lori seems like we're so dark at
[1:54:06] times Lord the one thing we ask help us
[1:54:10] to stay in position that the light of
[1:54:12] God may shine on us again
[1:54:15] and Lord we know that it is the season
[1:54:19] for more right if we can say we're sorry
[1:54:21] and as you told Jeremiah just tell
[1:54:23] Israel to acknowledge their iniquity
[1:54:26] just just say they're wrong Church
[1:54:29] that's a fasting do today if you like
[1:54:31] more god just look up to God and just
[1:54:33] whisper in your heart say Lord I'm sorry
[1:54:34] I'm wrong here I'm wrong there I
[1:54:37] acknowledge where I'm wrong now Church
[1:54:42] if you are this increasing you pray for
[1:54:43] somebody right now everybody consider
[1:54:47] one another consider how you can stir
[1:54:49] somebody up today as we leave this place
[1:54:52] don't go here without thinking about
[1:54:55] hottest there's somebody up amen
[1:54:57] they got bent it twisted hey lord I pray
[1:55:03] for both Lord rather than that
[1:55:05] increasing stage or decreasing stage one
[1:55:08] thing I asked lord help us to be honest
[1:55:11] lord help us to repent and help us to
[1:55:13] return to the light dear God amen no

[1:55:30] things of God may we all be increasing

[1:56:30] crime for us and take it on I believe
[1:56:34] there's a crowd waiting for us if we run
[1:56:36] the race Lord and if we keep the faith
