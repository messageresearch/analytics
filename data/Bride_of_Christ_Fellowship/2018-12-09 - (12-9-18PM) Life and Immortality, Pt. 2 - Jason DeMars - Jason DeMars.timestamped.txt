[35:40] [Music]
[35:56] [Music]
[36:07] father our we just think about that
[36:11] those are the words of that song what a
[36:15] treasure to see their true reality of
[36:20] what that blood did for us that
[36:24] purchased and paid for us to be perfect
[36:27] in your sight to be justified just as if
[36:31] I'd never sinned in the first place
[36:34] totally washed and clean and holy in
[36:37] your sight
[36:39] through that blood that was shed at
[36:41] Calvary let us live true to the cross
[36:46] let us as Jesus did pick up our cross
[36:50] daily and follow you Lord what a what a
[36:55] challenge to us father
[36:58] the the place of death the place of
[37:01] torture the plates place of extreme pain
[37:06] we were told to take that up and follow
[37:10] you
[37:11] forsaking everything else Lord all my
[37:14] lord help us our flesh is weak we want
[37:20] we want to see comfort and find comfort
[37:23] and yet Lord you're calling to us us to
[37:25] something higher something greater Lord
[37:27] less let us die to ourselves that the
[37:31] Spirit of Christ might live through us
[37:34] we ask it in Jesus name Amen god bless
[37:38] you all be seated
[37:40] I think I'm hooked up to the right one
[37:44] there I'm gonna look under here again
[37:49] not sure if it fell down but
[38:11] [Music]
[38:15] okay so as we're bringing that up and
[38:21] I'm gonna before we continue the message
[38:24] from this morning I'm going to give a
[38:26] little emissions update and report about
[38:29] what we've been doing in the Middle East
[38:32] the whole that's right I've been doing
[38:38] missions now for nine years with Iranian
[38:42] refugees that live in live in Turkey for
[38:47] whatever reason they've fled whether it
[38:48] be because of persecution or political
[38:51] reasons sorry they're living now in the
[38:58] country of Turkey and so this opens the
[39:02] opportunity for us to be able to
[39:03] minister to them Iran as you know is a
[39:07] persecuted country closed country very
[39:11] very difficult for Westerners to be able
[39:14] to get into and so Turkey is kind of a
[39:18] staging place for refugees from Iran
[39:22] from Syria and from Iraq to be able to
[39:24] go through there and they end up in some
[39:28] country in the West depending on how the
[39:29] UN would direct them but the people that
[39:33] were working with mainly is Iranians the
[39:37] Lord is moving amongst them we'll talk a
[39:39] little bit about that
[39:42] first Peter 1 verse 1 Peter an apostle
[39:47] of Jesus Christ to the stranger
[39:49] scattered throughout Pontus Galatia
[39:52] Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia so the word
[39:57] strangers there is an alien alongside so
[40:01] there they're not in their country of
[40:04] birth their country of origin they've
[40:05] they've left their country of origin
[40:08] another word we call that as a refugee
[40:10] ok they're seeking refuge in another
[40:13] country for whatever reason they're
[40:15] their own country it is not tolerating
[40:18] them anymore they can't live there
[40:20] openly securely with
[40:23] so they leave that in other word they're
[40:26] scattered means dispersion it simply
[40:28] means someone who was residing in a
[40:30] country that they were not one born in
[40:35] originally so you see here in the first
[40:39] church age in the Alpha Age the bride is
[40:44] ministering to refugees living in this
[40:47] areas here Pontus Galatia Cappadocia
[40:50] Asia and Bithynia so that's the alpha
[40:53] age so anybody know where these regions
[40:57] are so Asia
[41:02] Metheny iglasia Cappadocia Pontus those
[41:06] are all areas in modern-day Turkey and
[41:10] so the seven churches are in south
[41:14] western Turkey all the seven churches
[41:17] from those what we call the seven church
[41:19] ages are there and Galatia is a region
[41:23] there Cappadocia is another region
[41:25] methania
[41:26] Pontus another region what comprises
[41:29] Turkey so now we're in the Omega age the
[41:33] seventh church age and now the bride is
[41:36] ministering to refugees living in this
[41:39] same area so the Alpha and the Omega
[41:43] coming again and we understand that the
[41:47] gospel travels from east to west along
[41:50] with civilization look what brother
[41:53] Branham says here in the endtime sign
[41:55] seat in 1962 all you Bible readers know
[41:58] that what happened civilization travels
[42:00] from east to the west China is the
[42:02] oldest civilization we have civilization
[42:04] begin in the east its went with the Sun
[42:07] traveling west where is it at now the
[42:09] west coast if it goes any farther it's
[42:11] back east again
[42:13] see what I mean so we know the message
[42:16] came and it went to the west coast
[42:19] brother Branham there preaching the
[42:21] gospel on the west coast but where does
[42:22] that message have to go back to
[42:24] ultimately it's got to go back to
[42:26] Jerusalem so we know it's got to make
[42:29] its way back into Japan China Southeast
[42:32] Asia into the Middle East and then back
[42:36] to
[42:37] Jerusalem again and so that's what we
[42:39] see it's doing now people in in Iran are
[42:43] receiving the message people in Turkey
[42:45] are receiving the message and it's got
[42:48] to go to other Middle Eastern countries
[42:50] as well before it gets back to Jerusalem
[42:53] a little bit of information on Turkey
[42:57] where I've been working now for the last
[42:59] six years it's 99 percent Muslim
[43:04] refugees are welcomed and left alone
[43:07] regarding religion as far as the
[43:10] government is concerned the local people
[43:13] in the areas are not very receptive to
[43:17] Christians and especially as if there's
[43:20] refugees living in smaller cities they
[43:22] will be treated much worse because
[43:24] there's a there's a higher level of
[43:26] fanatic Islam in the smaller smaller
[43:30] cities and villages Turks definitely
[43:33] frown on evangelizing their own we've
[43:38] we've put some efforts into bringing the
[43:42] gospel to Turkish people there but in
[43:45] the nine years that we've been in touch
[43:48] with refugees there iranian refugees has
[43:51] just been very very few that have
[43:52] responded to the gospel actually just
[43:55] just the handful just in recent recent
[43:58] years have received the gospel of turks
[44:02] native turks government does not
[44:05] actively persecute Christians Magan the
[44:11] trouble is from the citizens of the
[44:13] country you might have seen recently
[44:15] that there was a pastor from
[44:17] Presbyterian Church that was in prison
[44:20] for three years and that was more not so
[44:23] much related to his Christian faith it
[44:26] was more related to the people that he
[44:28] had been caught in contact with somehow
[44:30] they had connected him to the so called
[44:34] terror network that that performed the
[44:38] coup to try to overthrow the government
[44:41] and that that man is fetch illegal and
[44:47] he lives in Pennsylvania now he had be
[44:49] exiled from the country
[44:51] and so I think it was part of just a
[44:53] plot to arrest a few Americans and see
[44:56] if they could trade the Americans in for
[44:58] this fetch illegal and they claim led
[45:03] the coup tried to overthrow the
[45:05] government but that was it pastor Andrew
[45:08] Brunson if you saw him and he he was
[45:11] released just a few months ago and
[45:15] actually President Trump did a
[45:17] tremendous job of putting pressure on
[45:20] the Turkish government actually went
[45:22] above and beyond what you could ever
[45:24] anticipate an American president or
[45:28] Secretary of State or anybody doing to
[45:30] put pressure on a country to get an
[45:33] American out of prison so really just
[45:38] has someone that's going into Turkey and
[45:39] traveling in the Middle East it makes
[45:40] you feel more safe and secure when you
[45:42] know your your your government is really
[45:47] fighting for you so but the that being
[45:54] said it wasn't really a direct
[45:55] connection to him being a Christian that
[45:57] he was put in prison was more so his
[45:59] connection so-called connection to the
[46:03] factor that Glenn terror network which I
[46:06] doubt was even real in the first place
[46:09] when he got out he said he wasn't
[46:11] tortured or treated bad conditions of
[46:13] the prison were bad but actually he was
[46:16] never even he was never interrogated
[46:18] once they never even asked him a
[46:19] question three years while he was in
[46:21] prison so anyways average citizen of
[46:26] Turkey views Christians as filthy so
[46:29] it's it's just something that you that
[46:32] the Iranians will hear frequently your
[46:35] Christians are filthy there's no logic
[46:38] behind it it's just their viewpoint of
[46:40] of someone different than themselves
[46:44] Turkey itself is a second world country
[46:47] on the verge of being a first world
[46:48] country you go there and there's
[46:50] Starbucks and Burger King and you know
[46:53] any fast food or restaurant that you
[46:55] could could imagine is there you can get
[46:58] Chinese food and waffles and you can't
[47:01] get bacon unfortunately so
[47:04] they try to make some kind of bacon but
[47:08] it's it's beef bacon it's just not the
[47:10] same but it's very easy to travel there
[47:15] once you get there it's very cheap to
[47:17] travel within the country food is pretty
[47:20] cheap accommodations as well a few
[47:26] thoughts on Islam was introduced by
[47:28] Muhammad in the 600's Quran mentions
[47:31] Jesus is actually more than it mentions
[47:33] Muhammad the titles that Jesus is given
[47:37] is the Word of God in the spirit of God
[47:39] which is a tremendous way to bridge the
[47:42] gap between Islam and Christianity and
[47:45] so obviously if they call Jesus the Word
[47:49] of God and the Spirit of God it's not a
[47:51] it's not a leap to identify him as as
[47:54] God so they teach that Jesus and Mary
[47:58] are the only two people in history born
[48:01] without sin so even they have sort of a
[48:03] Catholic view point towards Mary they
[48:09] say Jesus is the virgin born Messiah and
[48:11] a prophet but they they say it's a
[48:14] blasphemy to call him the Son of God
[48:18] they they're waiting for Jesus to return
[48:22] Sunni Muslims are waiting for Jesus to
[48:26] return not Muhammad they don't they're
[48:29] not looking for him they're not waiting
[48:31] for him at all
[48:34] Sunnis believe that Jesus will return
[48:36] and set up a Muslim Caliphate over the
[48:38] whole world and Shia Muslims which
[48:43] Iranians are Shia Muslims they believe
[48:45] that the 12th Imam will return along
[48:50] with Jesus in order to set up that
[48:52] worldwide caliphate women have less
[48:56] worth than men really they're treated
[48:58] like objects you can marry for for women
[49:04] also they have temporary marriage you
[49:06] can be married for a short period of
[49:08] time one hour one week one month
[49:11] whatever you want and divorce remarriage
[49:14] is perfectly acceptable for men and
[49:17] women
[49:18] in Islam takes for women to testify in
[49:23] court to equal the testimony of one man
[49:26] and Islam allows for women to be beaten
[49:34] for husbands to beat their wives but to
[49:37] not beat them too hard because they're
[49:40] also your property just like cattle and
[49:44] so forth you want to take care of your
[49:46] cattle take care of your property take
[49:48] care of your wife as well so if you're
[49:50] gonna if you disobeys you feel free to
[49:52] beat her but just be gentle whatever
[49:56] that means
[49:57] it's crazy that's crazy it's from a
[50:00] different different era a different time
[50:02] different age and totally backwards
[50:08] brother Branham says this in the
[50:10] Philadelphia Church age in the church
[50:12] age book when afternoon as I began to
[50:14] minister one of the thousands of
[50:15] mohammedans came up on the platform as
[50:17] she stood before me a missionary to the
[50:19] Muhammadans began to softly implore the
[50:22] Lord Oh for that precious soul Oh for
[50:24] that precious soul he had been over
[50:26] there for years and years and according
[50:28] to his own testimony he'd seen only one
[50:30] muhammadin come to receive Jesus Christ
[50:33] as Savior they originally the
[50:35] medo-persians whose laws changed not
[50:37] they are so hard to win it seems that
[50:40] once a always a is
[50:43] a law amongst them and of course that
[50:45] absolutely is the case apostasy is a
[50:48] crime punishable by death so leaving
[50:51] Islam and becoming a Christian is
[50:53] something that it's supposed to be
[50:55] punishable diet by death in those
[50:57] countries that are under Sharia law
[51:01] absolutely enforced that Saudi Arabia
[51:03] and so forth Somalia Turkey is not under
[51:07] Sharia law it's a secular country
[51:10] they're not an Islamic Republic like
[51:13] Iran is there a secular republic their
[51:15] current government government is trying
[51:18] to slowly change it from being a secular
[51:22] country to an Islamic country but it's
[51:28] it's not an easy process to reverse that
[51:31] most
[51:31] Turkish people are if you go there it's
[51:34] almost like for us in Minneapolis it's
[51:36] almost similar because you'll see
[51:40] there's a lot of somali people that live
[51:43] in the minneapolis area so you see many
[51:46] Somalis wearing the full hijab in Turkey
[51:50] I feel like we see about similar
[51:52] percentage of women that are worldly
[51:54] women that are somewhat serious they
[51:57] were a scarf and then women that are
[51:59] very serious there were in the full
[52:01] black pea job there so I would say
[52:05] probably fifty percent of women in
[52:08] Turkey are dress just dressed worldly
[52:11] now would change again based on if
[52:13] you're in a big city or a village what
[52:16] you might be in so like Istanbul you
[52:19] would see more like seventy percent of
[52:21] of women are just worldly just like
[52:24] dressed like Americans and I never
[52:27] thought that yoga pants would catch on
[52:29] in Turkey like they did here but you're
[52:32] starting to see them all over the place
[52:34] even in is so-called conservative
[52:38] Islamic country but it's very true
[52:42] winning Muslims historically it's been
[52:47] almost impossible in these countries
[52:50] there's there's missionaries over the
[52:52] years and you can read about them that
[52:55] have gone and dedicated their lives and
[52:57] just win one a few people a small amount
[53:01] of people but God is moving in a
[53:06] different way amongst the Iranians when
[53:08] I first started working a month amongst
[53:10] them the people that were in like
[53:15] underground churches inside of Iran that
[53:17] had converted from Islam to Christianity
[53:19] were they estimated around a hundred
[53:22] thousand and so now nine years later
[53:25] they're saying that there's upwards of
[53:27] two million that have converted and have
[53:30] become Christians a lot of it is through
[53:32] satellite television so they are
[53:35] watching TBN and different Iranian shows
[53:39] that are based out of say California or
[53:42] Texas or England
[53:45] and those are going by satellite into
[53:47] the country the people are not supposed
[53:49] to have satellite dishes but everybody
[53:52] has satellite dishes and they're
[53:55] watching christiane programming
[53:56] yeah and it's so amazing for them and
[53:59] it's just it's changing lives
[54:01] so many many responding to the gospel so
[54:04] Iranian hearts are open very very open
[54:07] to the gospel my experience it's it was
[54:10] so strange the first time I brought the
[54:12] gospel to an Iranian young man I was
[54:15] expecting a little argument and some
[54:17] back-and-forth but I asked him I told my
[54:21] testimony I spoke about the gospel and I
[54:25] said you have any questions and he says
[54:29] how should I get saved okay I was
[54:36] waiting for her a little bit more than
[54:38] that but repent be baptized in the name
[54:42] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[54:44] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[54:45] of the Holy Ghost and so it was just
[54:48] that's the typical response it's very
[54:51] very simple if there's a question it's a
[54:52] simple question about about Jesus or
[54:59] something it's nothing there there so
[55:01] over Islam they know it's not real they
[55:04] know it's you know it's it's nonsense
[55:06] and their hearts are open to the gospel
[55:08] very simply you know another example
[55:10] would be this is something that's
[55:12] happened over and over again you preach
[55:13] on like a deep subject like what is the
[55:16] message or something like that and you
[55:19] never even really mention the gospel per
[55:23] se you know that Jesus came to die of
[55:25] sinners he didn't make an altar call and
[55:27] people are like can we come forward and
[55:29] receive Christ or they'll ask someone
[55:33] next to him and they bring him forward
[55:34] say will you pray with them they want to
[55:36] receive Christ so they're just they get
[55:39] in that atmosphere and that's what they
[55:41] want they want the gospel they want the
[55:44] truth and they're hungry souls and
[55:46] they're open which is only God can
[55:49] create that circumstance in that
[55:51] situation missionaries have gone and
[55:53] pushed and pulled and begged and open
[55:57] hospitals and done everything
[55:59] but when the Holy Spirit moves it's just
[56:01] so easy you know here are some of the
[56:06] believers in in Turkey that we're
[56:08] working with on top is two of the
[56:11] mission ministers we're working in with
[56:13] brother Shahin brother Omid that had the
[56:16] prayer requests for this morning this is
[56:19] one of our services in the city of Deniz
[56:22] Lee this is a typical meeting meet at in
[56:26] the mall or at a coffee shop and ask
[56:30] them questions and let them ask us
[56:32] questions and speak about the Word of
[56:33] God this was at one of our mystery Expos
[56:39] that we put on in the city of Esparta
[56:42] introducing the message to about 150
[56:45] people there so we had our books and and
[56:48] things and pictures of brother Branham
[56:50] back there this is brother Kevin was the
[56:51] pastor in the city of Esparta he did all
[56:54] the footwork to get all the people there
[56:56] and do the outreach really good meetings
[57:00] that we had there 14 people came to be
[57:04] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:06] Christ from the meetings and on our
[57:09] Sunday morning meeting there was a woman
[57:13] I have this picture up because a woman
[57:15] came into the service and she where we
[57:20] had the service was on the second floor
[57:21] the first floor they came in through on
[57:24] the first floor and walked up the stairs
[57:25] a group of stairs to get up to the next
[57:27] floor and she came in she saw our little
[57:31] table and the pictures of brother
[57:34] Branham and she said oh where is he and
[57:39] the brother said well he passed away
[57:42] many years ago he's gone on to his
[57:45] reward he's God's prophet messenger to
[57:49] this age and and she said no I walked in
[57:53] the building earlier and he was the one
[57:56] that he was there to greet me I mean he
[57:58] looked like she said he looked like this
[58:00] but he was younger and so but I I know I
[58:04] saw him he I greeted him there and so it
[58:08] was just amazing when she came up and
[58:10] told us that testimony she was gay
[58:12] during all the books that she could in
[58:14] order to and starting right away to read
[58:16] them like does seeing God the man just
[58:22] seeing God come and show us you know
[58:24] point us that the message is coming to
[58:26] this town amen so just a few of the
[58:30] people being baptized there and pool at
[58:32] one of the hotels and let me see if this
[58:36] will play this is a video
[58:40] [Music]
[59:34] [Music]
[59:45] there's another one of those interesting
[59:47] situations where you led I led people to
[59:50] the Lord I didn't even know it we were
[59:51] visiting their home and brother oh we
[59:54] didn't we didn't get the whole
[59:55] background of their story we visited
[59:57] their home twice and answered their
[59:59] questions about the Bible and we got
[1:00:02] there like we're ready to be baptized
[1:00:05] and we're starting to pray over I'm the
[1:00:08] one but the one the the husband and the
[1:00:11] family says we never prayed to accept
[1:00:13] Christ like I thought you already did I
[1:00:16] did
[1:00:16] no that's why we were asking the
[1:00:19] questions we were asking okay let's pray
[1:00:23] and this is a Iraqi family they had to
[1:00:33] flee because their town was attacked by
[1:00:36] Isis and there's a lot of Iraqis living
[1:00:42] in in Turkey and this is an open door
[1:00:44] for us it's just been difficult because
[1:00:46] we don't have a very good translator
[1:00:48] there brother homey and brother Nehemiah
[1:00:51] visited them each a few different times
[1:00:54] there they're actually Catholic but
[1:00:57] their desire is to learn learn the Bible
[1:01:00] and so we're just praying the Lord would
[1:01:02] raise up a translator for us this is
[1:01:08] from our ministers meeting this last
[1:01:10] year some of the ministers wives came as
[1:01:12] well a part of the meetings for the
[1:01:19] Nehemiah they're translating for me he's
[1:01:23] been our main translator and minister
[1:01:27] that we're working with he actually
[1:01:28] lives in in Canada now and travels back
[1:01:31] and forth several times a year to Turkey
[1:01:34] and does the translation work of the
[1:01:37] message there in Canada brother Petros
[1:01:43] he also was directed as a refugee to the
[1:01:46] country of Germany so he's able to go
[1:01:48] back a little bit more frequently every
[1:01:50] couple months he'll return
[1:01:52] to Turkey he's also planted a church in
[1:01:53] Hamburg Germany of Iranian refugees
[1:01:56] living there and so he's also travelling
[1:01:59] to some of the refugee camps that
[1:02:02] Germany has set up throughout the
[1:02:04] country and is able to get in and
[1:02:06] ministering the message to them in those
[1:02:09] places as well this was our one of our
[1:02:13] services there in the city of Esparta
[1:02:16] back in August I had their brother Omid
[1:02:20] translating for me and brother Kavon is
[1:02:24] just a tremendous evangelist when he
[1:02:27] came to the city there were no no
[1:02:30] message believers at all just beside
[1:02:32] himself and he came and started
[1:02:34] evangelizing people and I think our
[1:02:36] first time we visited him there was
[1:02:37] about 30 30 people there we started he
[1:02:42] had told him some basic things about
[1:02:43] water baptism then we started introduced
[1:02:46] brother branham's ministry to them and
[1:02:47] then started talking about the Godhead
[1:02:50] and most of the church laughs it was
[1:02:52] down to like three or four people and
[1:02:54] then brother cave on just continued
[1:02:56] going on and it wasn't long after that
[1:02:59] that he baptized 45 people and the name
[1:03:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ and each time
[1:03:04] we go back the church continues to grow
[1:03:06] actually I think they have to have
[1:03:07] several services every Sunday just to
[1:03:10] accommodate everyone because they don't
[1:03:11] have the room there in the church this
[1:03:17] is one of the sites you see all over a
[1:03:19] really old mosque I think this is from
[1:03:21] the 16th century was built there this is
[1:03:27] in the city of C vas one thing that we
[1:03:33] we I kind of forget this the city of C
[1:03:36] vos hadn't had a church in it for almost
[1:03:39] five hundred years they did Christianity
[1:03:42] had been chased out and eradicated from
[1:03:44] the city of C vos and back in December
[1:03:49] of 2012 brother Petros and brother
[1:03:53] Nehemiah held a Christmas service there
[1:03:55] and 17 people give their hearts to
[1:03:59] Christ so that was the start of the
[1:04:01] first church in this city in five
[1:04:03] hundred years
[1:04:04] incredible this is the what the region
[1:04:11] that we looked at before
[1:04:13] Cappadocia looks like so it's beautiful
[1:04:16] it's quite a tourist area people will
[1:04:19] come there and they'll take the balloons
[1:04:20] to look up over the top of it and
[1:04:24] they're there these rock formations and
[1:04:28] people actually lived inside the rock
[1:04:31] formations I don't know the whole story
[1:04:34] behind it but there's even a there's
[1:04:36] even a city that's built that's five
[1:04:39] miles under the ground it's many many
[1:04:41] many stories that they lived under the
[1:04:43] ground from what I heard and I don't
[1:04:46] know if it's a hundred percent accurate
[1:04:47] but from what I heard is someone had a
[1:04:53] prophecy that the world was going to be
[1:04:55] destroyed and so the they began building
[1:04:58] a city upon city layer upon layer of
[1:05:01] City underneath the ground well as time
[1:05:04] went on this area was right outside the
[1:05:06] control of the Roman Empire so
[1:05:08] Christians that were living in Rome and
[1:05:11] different areas that were being
[1:05:12] persecuted under under the Emperor's
[1:05:16] back then actually fled to this area and
[1:05:19] built churches into these rock
[1:05:23] formations and lived underground as
[1:05:25] protection from the Roman Empire these
[1:05:32] are the ruins of laodicea Leodis he has
[1:05:37] been was destroyed four different times
[1:05:40] by earthquakes and so they they rebuilt
[1:05:44] it four times but after that fourth time
[1:05:46] it was destroyed they decided to move
[1:05:48] the city further down the river so that
[1:05:53] it wouldn't be destroyed again but
[1:05:56] they're one of our one of our churches
[1:06:00] that we have is in that replacement city
[1:06:03] right next to Laodicea so if you're
[1:06:05] wondering there is a church in laodicea
[1:06:07] nayo Tasya
[1:06:09] [Music]
[1:06:13] this is the supernatural series it's
[1:06:17] actually has all been translated now and
[1:06:20] we're just working on getting it printed
[1:06:21] for the believers there it's just been a
[1:06:24] tremendous help to them to see kind of
[1:06:27] the progression and supernatural life
[1:06:30] that brother Branham had things that we
[1:06:33] don't think of but they just didn't have
[1:06:34] access to it you know there's 50 57
[1:06:36] messages translated so this has been a
[1:06:40] huge huge help to them this is the
[1:06:44] church ages book that's the translation
[1:06:47] was finished this spring and has been
[1:06:49] printed and distributed amongst the
[1:06:51] believers there another thing we're
[1:06:53] we're dreaming about for many years and
[1:06:55] the Lord made a way for us very thankful
[1:07:00] this is a recent mystery Expo that
[1:07:02] brother Petros and brother Omid and
[1:07:04] where the Kavon put on in the city of
[1:07:06] Chi Suri we had had a small group of
[1:07:10] three or four believers that were
[1:07:11] gathering together there in that city
[1:07:13] and so brother Petros went and kind of
[1:07:16] did a bunch of outreach and scheduled a
[1:07:18] meeting and invited the people he
[1:07:20] introduced the message just on a basic
[1:07:22] level
[1:07:23] kayvon introduced the gospel to the
[1:07:26] people and then they baptized I believe
[1:07:28] ten people in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:29] Christ there as a result of these
[1:07:32] meetings and churches about 17 to 20
[1:07:35] people attending it now feeding on the
[1:07:39] message brother ol meat is traveling
[1:07:41] that's what he wants to move because
[1:07:42] he'd been working with a little group in
[1:07:45] Sivas he wants to move to Kaiser receive
[1:07:47] us has like a hundred Iranian refugees
[1:07:49] living in the whole city and Chi Sri has
[1:07:53] many thousands of irani and refugees
[1:07:56] living there
[1:07:57] so with that has a greater opportunity
[1:07:59] to do outreach and and work with the
[1:08:02] people and bring the message to them so
[1:08:07] some of the baptisms and brother ole
[1:08:10] Mead or the Kavon number the Petros
[1:08:12] there
[1:08:17] this last August I also traveled to
[1:08:20] another country which I probably
[1:08:22] shouldn't name here for streaming online
[1:08:25] but it's an arabic-speaking country and
[1:08:28] we had the opportunity to work with a
[1:08:31] couple different churches there and
[1:08:32] introduce the message to them and
[1:08:34] they've gladly received it and are
[1:08:36] continuing to follow along with the
[1:08:39] message Lord willing we'll be going back
[1:08:41] there again in January to continue the
[1:08:44] process of feeding them the truth and so
[1:08:48] keep us in prayer with that different
[1:08:52] totally different country people and
[1:08:57] totally different approach with them but
[1:08:59] the Lord's with us I know and it's going
[1:09:03] well just cover your prayers with that
[1:09:06] after introducing the message seven
[1:09:08] people got baptized there eight chapters
[1:09:14] of the church changes book has also been
[1:09:16] completed in the Arabic language Lord
[1:09:19] raised up a translator so we're excited
[1:09:22] about that
[1:09:23] working with Cloverdale getting that on
[1:09:26] the message hub as well and that's it on
[1:09:31] that one so the Lord is moving in the
[1:09:36] Middle East so I need your prayers
[1:09:39] definitely and just appreciate
[1:09:43] appreciate that very much it's a
[1:09:46] spiritual battle you know that's the
[1:09:48] part that you think that we sometimes
[1:09:51] forget about is that we are in a battle
[1:09:55] against the devil on a constant basis
[1:09:59] and we have to have our armor on so
[1:10:01] let's let's kind of change the order
[1:10:05] here and we'll finish up the message
[1:10:07] from this morning let's pray Heavenly
[1:10:12] Father as we change the order from
[1:10:14] testimonies to the preaching of the word
[1:10:16] we asked for an anointing Lord to do
[1:10:19] that not only upon me but upon your
[1:10:23] people Lord that we would pull from you
[1:10:27] that you would give us
[1:10:29] thing which we have need of give us the
[1:10:32] answers that were that that you have for
[1:10:35] us and Lord may it be clear and
[1:10:39] understandable to the people we ask it
[1:10:42] in Jesus name Amen
[1:10:47] okay so we've been we were talking about
[1:10:50] the different terminologies used in the
[1:10:55] in the New Testament looking at those
[1:10:57] couple different Greek words Ione and IO
[1:11:00] Neos and studying how they're used there
[1:11:04] if you recall those some of you I think
[1:11:06] are weren't here this morning but a
[1:11:10] couple different Greek words that are
[1:11:12] used and they're always said that
[1:11:14] they're translated as eternal meaning no
[1:11:17] beginning and no ending but if you look
[1:11:20] at them they're used in conjunction with
[1:11:23] words like beginning the words like
[1:11:26] began words like present present not
[1:11:30] like gift but like present tense and so
[1:11:34] when you put a word like Ione or IO Neos
[1:11:37] together with a word that speaks of time
[1:11:40] you can't have an eternal beginning you
[1:11:43] can't have eternal present tense doesn't
[1:11:46] make any sense at all you can't you
[1:11:48] can't have eternity ending so we have to
[1:11:52] understand these words even if the even
[1:11:54] if the scholars tell us that they mean
[1:11:56] eternal in the sense of no beginning nor
[1:11:59] ending we have to actually look at how
[1:12:02] the scripture defines these words and so
[1:12:05] we understand that most of the time
[1:12:07] those words mean the in an age or a
[1:12:11] period of time and you know we were
[1:12:16] myself what was your name brother
[1:12:18] brother Jose were speaking after the
[1:12:21] service and he mentioned the word Zoe
[1:12:23] which is life so eternal life when those
[1:12:27] words come together we understand it's
[1:12:30] speaking about something different not
[1:12:32] speaking just about a period of time
[1:12:34] because Zoe if you really look at what
[1:12:38] it mean I mean it's in one sense it just
[1:12:40] means life but when you're attaching
[1:12:43] to the to God or eternity we're speaking
[1:12:47] of God's own life this is divine life
[1:12:51] the word Zoe so if we have eternal Zoe
[1:12:55] it's connected to God and what is God he
[1:12:59] has no beginning no ending
[1:13:01] God isn't in a period of time or an age
[1:13:04] God is eternal he's outside of time okay
[1:13:09] so it again the word used in it in any
[1:13:14] situation it's the it's the
[1:13:17] understanding of it is based on the
[1:13:18] context that it's used in we always look
[1:13:21] at it that way the very definition of
[1:13:27] eternal that brother Branham gaves us
[1:13:31] gave us no B in the English word I
[1:13:33] should say no beginning no ending shows
[1:13:36] that Hell itself cannot be an unceasing
[1:13:39] torment why because it has a beginning
[1:13:43] hell is created for the devil and his
[1:13:46] angels
[1:13:47] and so it's if it's created it's going
[1:13:51] to have an end in other words you could
[1:13:54] say well you're created
[1:13:57] I'm created therefore we have an end but
[1:14:00] the thing is your inner you have to look
[1:14:01] at the big picture because what's the
[1:14:03] life what's the life inside of the son
[1:14:07] of God it's God's own life and therefore
[1:14:10] that has no beginning and no ending but
[1:14:14] other things that are that are created
[1:14:16] that don't come directly from the life
[1:14:19] of God have an ending
[1:14:20] and so yes hell was created but it was
[1:14:25] for the purpose of distraction and we'll
[1:14:27] find that in the scripture it wasn't
[1:14:30] created as an eternal torture chamber
[1:14:34] you know and they just think about it
[1:14:36] for a second we see God as love as just
[1:14:41] as kind and what Christianity
[1:14:47] theologians some theologians not
[1:14:49] everyone have imputed to God is that he
[1:14:52] wants to put people in an eternal
[1:14:55] torture chamber
[1:14:56] and torture them unending can you
[1:15:03] imagine no God says the wages of sin is
[1:15:07] death he just cuts off that life God is
[1:15:12] not in the business of torturing people
[1:15:15] that's what he'll that's what their
[1:15:18] description of Hell is is torture and
[1:15:22] God that's not the nature of God we'll
[1:15:27] look at that more later so yeah we just
[1:15:41] said that the purpose of Hell is to
[1:15:44] bring both physical and spiritual death
[1:15:47] leading to annihilation of being they go
[1:15:51] out of existence that's the purpose of
[1:15:54] Hell well Jesse you brought this verse
[1:16:01] right after the service it's like uh
[1:16:04] yeah that's that's like next scripture
[1:16:06] we cover mark 19 43 and 44 and if thy
[1:16:12] hand offend thee cut it off it is better
[1:16:15] for thee to enter into life maimed than
[1:16:18] having two hands to go into hell so
[1:16:21] first of all think about it this way
[1:16:24] just if we're gonna take this verse
[1:16:27] literally it's very strange okay your
[1:16:30] hand causes you to sin cut off your hand
[1:16:34] so then you're not sinning anymore and
[1:16:37] then you'll enter into life with no hand
[1:16:40] is that how the resurrection works if
[1:16:43] you have no hand when you're resurrected
[1:16:46] you'll have a hand if you have no foot
[1:16:49] in the resurrection you'll have a foot
[1:16:52] so perhaps Jesus is pointing out
[1:16:56] something different but then a literal
[1:16:58] understanding of this verse in other
[1:17:00] words he said we should violently resist
[1:17:03] sin with all the strength within us
[1:17:06] whatever it takes to stop that if your
[1:17:09] phone
[1:17:10] causes you to sin get rid of your phone
[1:17:12] if your internet causes you to soon get
[1:17:14] rid of your internet if your TV causes
[1:17:16] you to sin get rid of your TV and the
[1:17:19] list goes on he's not saying that we
[1:17:22] should cut off our body parts and then
[1:17:25] we'll enter into eternity without those
[1:17:27] body parts
[1:17:27] that's totally contrary to the rest of
[1:17:30] Scripture into the fire that shall never
[1:17:34] be quenched okay that's fine the fire
[1:17:38] won't be quenched
[1:17:40] it didn't say the person will never die
[1:17:42] that the fire won't be quenched where
[1:17:47] the worm dies not and the fire is not
[1:17:50] quenched okay so let's just take this
[1:17:53] literally absolutely a hundred percent
[1:17:58] literally they're going to be in the
[1:18:00] grave and the worm is going to continue
[1:18:03] to eat them until what if the worm
[1:18:09] doesn't die what's gonna happen to the
[1:18:11] body the carcass because worms eat
[1:18:14] carcasses not spirits not souls worms
[1:18:19] eat dead bodies so where is the body
[1:18:22] gonna go at the end it's gonna be
[1:18:25] totally consumed it's not going to exist
[1:18:27] in its state anymore and the fire is not
[1:18:31] quenched again okay fine the fire is not
[1:18:35] quenched but did you know this is
[1:18:38] quoting another verse of scripture that
[1:18:43] Jesus didn't just make this up out of
[1:18:44] thin air he's actually grabbing this
[1:18:46] from another verse Isaiah 66 verse 24
[1:18:55] this is I think it's good to get the
[1:18:58] whole context of this let's turn in our
[1:19:00] Bibles to Isaiah 66
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:26] so first of all in Isaiah 65 it's
[1:19:30] talking about creating a new heavens and
[1:19:32] the new earth speaking about the
[1:19:34] Millennium then it's speaking in verse
[1:19:37] in in chapter 66 it's going into the
[1:19:42] kingdom it's going into the the place of
[1:19:46] God's dwelling it's going into a little
[1:19:53] bit of the restoration of Israel and so
[1:19:57] forth so then we get to this place verse
[1:20:02] 24 and they shall all go forth and look
[1:20:06] upon so this is talking about the
[1:20:09] righteous the people that are gathering
[1:20:11] together to worship the Lord in the
[1:20:15] Millennium so verse 24 and they shall go
[1:20:19] forth and look upon the carcasses of the
[1:20:22] men that have transgressed against me
[1:20:27] for their worm shall not die neither
[1:20:29] shall their fire be quenched and they
[1:20:31] shall be an abhorring unto all flesh
[1:20:35] okay so it's very interesting the
[1:20:39] context here so they're worshiping the
[1:20:40] Lord let's just say at the temple if
[1:20:45] that's what we want to look at they're
[1:20:46] worshiping the Lord at the temple and it
[1:20:48] says they're gonna come and worship
[1:20:50] before the Lord and then they go out of
[1:20:52] the temple and there's dead bodies
[1:20:54] laying everywhere all around and it says
[1:20:59] they're gonna see the people laying
[1:21:02] there the worm will not die neither
[1:21:06] shall their fire be quenched okay it's a
[1:21:10] gruesome it's a gruesome spot it's a
[1:21:14] gruesome sight so literally you think
[1:21:17] literally they're going to come out of
[1:21:19] the temple and all around the temple and
[1:21:22] the Millennium there's gonna be just
[1:21:23] dead bodies sprinkled everywhere and
[1:21:25] you'll just watch oh there's worms
[1:21:27] and there's fire coming out of their
[1:21:29] bodies that's gross
[1:21:33] what is it what does it mean why it is
[1:21:36] why is that said their God is they're
[1:21:40] gonna know that God took vengeance there
[1:21:43] on those people when did he take
[1:21:46] vengeance at them at the end of the
[1:21:48] Great Tribulation Period okay so yes
[1:21:52] Armageddon and so what is it I don't
[1:21:55] believe what piece would we have if we
[1:22:00] walked out of the temple I walked out of
[1:22:02] church and all around us is dead bodies
[1:22:05] but it's not we wouldn't enjoy that it
[1:22:10] wouldn't be wonderful but what it what
[1:22:12] is it simply telling us there will be a
[1:22:14] remembrance you were delivered from the
[1:22:17] wrath of God I think that's all it means
[1:22:20] their worm dies not there neither is the
[1:22:24] fire quenched the worm eats until it the
[1:22:28] body is consumed the fire burns until
[1:22:30] the body is consumed again the picture
[1:22:33] is not out of an eternal torment the
[1:22:36] picture is of a consumption until
[1:22:39] they're done away with
[1:22:41] what does Malachi 4 says the wicked
[1:22:44] shall not be left either root nor branch
[1:22:47] means they're gonna be annihilated amen
[1:22:53] Matthew 10:28 and fear not them which
[1:22:56] kill the body but are not able to kill
[1:22:59] the soul but rather fear him which is
[1:23:01] able to destroy both soul and body in
[1:23:06] hell my so if to kill is to deprive the
[1:23:14] body of life then hell would seem to be
[1:23:17] the deprivation of both physical and
[1:23:20] spiritual life that is an extinction of
[1:23:24] being you go out of existence God is
[1:23:28] going to kill the soul what does it mean
[1:23:30] to kill the soul it's dead it means it
[1:23:35] doesn't exist anymore the but when the
[1:23:37] body is killed you don't exist here
[1:23:40] anymore
[1:23:41] you're dead you go to the grave your
[1:23:43] body is basically useless for this
[1:23:46] dimension now your spiritual life goes
[1:23:51] on but then eventually in hell if a
[1:23:56] person is in hell it will be cut off
[1:23:58] because God can destroy the soul in hell
[1:24:03] question and answers on Hebrews 1957
[1:24:07] brother Branham says he'll die he'll go
[1:24:10] into a lake of fire and brimstone which
[1:24:11] burns we're burning is going on forever
[1:24:13] and forever and maybe for a hundred
[1:24:16] million years his soul may be tormented
[1:24:18] in the lake of fire and brimstone you
[1:24:20] say well it'd just be like regular
[1:24:21] brimstone I believe it would be a
[1:24:23] million times worse than that but I
[1:24:25] believe you couldn't describe it by fire
[1:24:27] by a literal fire the only reason it's
[1:24:30] put by fire that fire is the most
[1:24:32] consuming thing that we had it
[1:24:36] absolutely consumes and destroys
[1:24:38] everything fire does so that's the
[1:24:42] picture that when we have fire we
[1:24:44] shouldn't think what we've been taught
[1:24:46] to think by denominations which is that
[1:24:49] you'll be tormented by fire eternally
[1:24:51] but you should think of fire is the
[1:24:53] thing that consumes and destroys and
[1:24:57] puts out the life completely perishing
[1:25:02] death and destruction so let's look at
[1:25:03] these verses if the soul of sinners is
[1:25:09] immortal let's look at this first
[1:25:13] Corinthians 1:18 for the preaching of
[1:25:15] the Cross is to them that perish
[1:25:16] foolishness but to unto us which are
[1:25:19] saved it is the power of God so those
[1:25:22] that are lost are said to be perishing
[1:25:25] 1st Corinthians 2:15 2nd Corinthians
[1:25:29] 2:15 for we are unto God a sweet savour
[1:25:32] of Christ in them that are saved and in
[1:25:35] them that perish 2nd Thessalonians 2:10
[1:25:40] and with all deceivableness of
[1:25:41] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:25:44] because they received not the love of
[1:25:46] the truth that they might be saved
[1:25:51] this earlier Romans 6:23 for the wages
[1:25:54] of sin is death but the gift of God is
[1:25:57] eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[1:25:59] Lord
[1:26:00] Matthew 7:13 entry in at the strait gate
[1:26:04] for wide is the gate and broad is the
[1:26:07] way that leadeth to destruction and many
[1:26:09] there be which go in thereat so if hell
[1:26:13] is eternal
[1:26:14] then those who perish never perish those
[1:26:17] who are destroyed are never destroyed
[1:26:18] and those that die never die revelation
[1:26:29] 20 verse 14 and death and he'll were
[1:26:33] cast into the lake of fire this is the
[1:26:36] second death
[1:26:41] so the first death is physical death
[1:26:43] second death is a spiritual death go out
[1:26:46] of existence entirely revelation 20
[1:26:53] verse 10 and the devil that deceived
[1:26:55] them was cast into the lake of fire and
[1:26:58] brimstone where the beast and the false
[1:27:01] prophet are and shall be tormented day
[1:27:04] and night from eye on to eye on for ever
[1:27:08] and ever
[1:27:09] from age to age a long period of time
[1:27:14] because it's the second death there's
[1:27:16] got to be a time where they go out of
[1:27:17] existence but there will there will be a
[1:27:20] tormenting of the devil for a long
[1:27:23] period of time as brother Madison maybe
[1:27:25] millions of years
[1:27:30] Malachi 4:1 we reread it we referred to
[1:27:34] it before but we'll read it now for
[1:27:36] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[1:27:37] an oven and all the proud yea and all
[1:27:40] that do wickedly shall be stubble in the
[1:27:43] day that cometh shall burn them up saith
[1:27:45] the Lord of Hosts that it shall leave
[1:27:47] them neither root nor branch so the
[1:27:51] wicked will be totally consumed
[1:27:56] question-and-answers 19:59 brother
[1:27:58] Branham says I don't believe the Bible
[1:28:00] teaches an eternal burning hell it
[1:28:01] doesn't
[1:28:02] because if hell is eternal and people
[1:28:04] that go there will
[1:28:05] be punished eternally the only the way
[1:28:06] they could be eternally punished they'd
[1:28:09] have to have eternal life and there's
[1:28:10] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:28:12] in God see so they have to come to
[1:28:15] annihilation that is their physical part
[1:28:17] becomes annihilated and then their
[1:28:19] spiritual part becomes annihilated
[1:28:21] that's completely consumed there's no
[1:28:23] more to it neither root nor branch the
[1:28:26] Bible calls it their completely done
[1:28:28] away Exodus 21 23 through 25 and if any
[1:28:37] mischief follow then thou shalt give
[1:28:39] life for life eye for eye tooth for
[1:28:42] tooth hand for hand foot for foot
[1:28:45] burning for burning wound for wound
[1:28:47] stripe for stripe so this is a principle
[1:28:49] in God the punishment must be
[1:28:52] commensurate to the crime you know you
[1:28:57] have in in Islam where that someone
[1:28:59] steals something and you should cut
[1:29:00] their hands off it's not commensurate to
[1:29:04] the crime that that's a ridiculous
[1:29:07] punishment or you have a someone who has
[1:29:12] done a simple crime and they execute
[1:29:15] them steal something or something like
[1:29:18] that this is not that's not commensurate
[1:29:22] to itself that that's over-the-top but
[1:29:25] God's principle is justice and so if if
[1:29:29] someone has committed a crime in space
[1:29:35] and time would it be then proper for God
[1:29:38] to punish them for eternity think about
[1:29:42] that first and wouldn't be and so God
[1:29:45] God is always just if someone is a
[1:29:48] monster right Adolf Hitler or something
[1:29:52] Satan they're going to be punished for a
[1:29:56] long period of time just as their
[1:29:59] different rewards in the kingdom
[1:30:01] different levels in the kingdom in hell
[1:30:04] there's different punishments depending
[1:30:07] on the sin that the people have
[1:30:08] committed but at the end the wages of
[1:30:11] sin is death
[1:30:13] spiritual death
[1:30:18] vegans 110 that in the dispensation of
[1:30:22] the fullness of times he might gather
[1:30:23] together in one all things in Christ
[1:30:25] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:30:27] on earth even in him you know there's
[1:30:32] gonna come a time where everything that
[1:30:34] exists is going to be one United in
[1:30:36] Christ but if there's still people and
[1:30:38] spirits burning in hell for all eternity
[1:30:41] how can it really be said that
[1:30:43] everything in heaven and in earth
[1:30:45] is really United in Christ there's got
[1:30:49] to come a time where the wicked souls
[1:30:51] and spirits are done away with
[1:30:58] Ezekiel 18 verse 4 behold all souls are
[1:31:01] mine as the soul of the father so also
[1:31:04] the soul of the son is mine the soul
[1:31:07] that sinneth it shall die you know these
[1:31:10] things are actually really simple once
[1:31:12] you get the glass of I'll call it
[1:31:16] theology off of the scripture you can
[1:31:20] see the simple reality of life and death
[1:31:25] and we go back to what you know I want
[1:31:27] to relate this back to what I was
[1:31:29] talking about before because this is
[1:31:32] important to see it within the realm of
[1:31:34] predestination within the realm of the
[1:31:37] seed lines you see John chapter 8 let's
[1:31:41] look there tie these things together
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:52] when the serpent seed was introduced
[1:31:56] into the human race this was now a
[1:31:59] hybrid life and so in the book of
[1:32:04] Ecclesiastes we're not going to turn
[1:32:07] there I'm just gonna refer to it we find
[1:32:10] it says the life of man like the life of
[1:32:14] the sons of Adam goes up but the life of
[1:32:19] the beast goes down so what does it mean
[1:32:22] it means that that the the seed light of
[1:32:26] Adam was destined for heaven
[1:32:29] predestinated for heaven
[1:32:31] but the life of the Beast it doesn't
[1:32:33] continue on when it dies it's done it
[1:32:37] goes out of existence so you have the
[1:32:39] two life lives there think about what
[1:32:41] the serpent was it was the most subtly
[1:32:45] the most beautiful and the most
[1:32:46] intelligent of all the animals of the
[1:32:49] field so it was an animal so where would
[1:32:52] it light where would its life go it
[1:32:54] wasn't made in the image of God wasn't a
[1:32:56] son of God it was an animal so it's life
[1:32:58] when it dies it's done it's finished now
[1:33:03] that life is injected into the human
[1:33:07] race so we have a hybrid life there and
[1:33:11] then we saw in Genesis chapter 6 or that
[1:33:14] further hybridization comes and all of
[1:33:17] us have that serpentine nature within us
[1:33:20] we have some of the seed of Adam nature
[1:33:24] and some of this the seed of the serpent
[1:33:26] nature there and so everybody has that
[1:33:29] just in our genetics and so we must die
[1:33:33] we have to die but some are
[1:33:36] predestinated to life
[1:33:39] some have another gene in there which is
[1:33:43] the gene of God and so let's look here
[1:33:46] in John 8 and we start at verse 39 they
[1:33:54] answered and said unto Him Abraham his
[1:33:56] father jesus saith unto them if you were
[1:33:59] Abraham's children you would do the
[1:34:02] works of Abraham that word their
[1:34:04] children is teknon teknon means like a
[1:34:07] close intimate relationship you share
[1:34:11] the same nature the same attitude the
[1:34:15] same approach to things and the same
[1:34:18] life right but now verse 40 but now you
[1:34:23] seek to kill me a man that have told has
[1:34:26] told you the truth which I have heard of
[1:34:28] God this did not Abraham Abraham so know
[1:34:33] it so you see that the connection
[1:34:34] Abraham's children have the nature of
[1:34:37] Abraham they don't seek to kill someone
[1:34:40] that says that they've heard from God
[1:34:44] 41 you do the deeds of your father so
[1:34:48] here it's a little confusing who is he
[1:34:50] talking about which father is he talking
[1:34:52] about he doesn't say but the Pharisees
[1:34:54] understand him right away was in verse
[1:34:57] 41 then said they'd to him we be not
[1:34:59] born of fornication we have one father
[1:35:02] even God we saw that before being the
[1:35:07] seed of the devil here they connect to
[1:35:12] being born from fornication so they
[1:35:15] immediately connect you're you're the
[1:35:18] seed of the devil because of the
[1:35:19] fornication between Eve and the serpent
[1:35:23] that produced Cain and the serpent seed
[1:35:27] we have one father even God so that's
[1:35:31] their difference they look at it if
[1:35:33] they're from Adam's line if you're from
[1:35:36] Abraham's line then you're the seed of
[1:35:39] God and God is your father if you're not
[1:35:42] your from the seed of the serpent that's
[1:35:45] their viewpoint and verse 42 Jesus said
[1:35:49] unto them if god were your father
[1:35:51] I want you to notice this closely
[1:35:52] because this goes back to the genes of
[1:35:55] God the seed of God that's in the soul
[1:35:57] the soul if you don't remember this the
[1:36:00] soul is the control tower the soul has
[1:36:03] in it either saying yes or no to the
[1:36:06] Word of God that's it but it's that but
[1:36:10] in that soul is the nature the soul is
[1:36:12] the nature of the Spirit and so with
[1:36:15] within that that that should be the
[1:36:18] control tower not the flesh God through
[1:36:21] the Holy Spirit
[1:36:22] once wants by faith to control all our
[1:36:26] other senses so the spirit is connected
[1:36:29] to your mind so the the five realms of
[1:36:33] the Spirit are I always miss these
[1:36:35] memory reason conscience affection and
[1:36:40] what's the other way and imagination so
[1:36:42] those five senses are not designed to
[1:36:44] rule over us faith is designed which is
[1:36:49] put in the soul by God through
[1:36:51] predestination but when we're not born
[1:36:54] again that's not how it is
[1:36:57] the
[1:36:57] controls the flashes see taste feel
[1:37:00] smell and hear man and so that's not to
[1:37:06] control us but faith should control all
[1:37:08] our senses and so we have eat each of
[1:37:12] those senses within us and Jesus says
[1:37:16] this jesus said unto them and all those
[1:37:18] senses I'll say it again all those
[1:37:20] senses are a result of our mother and
[1:37:24] father's DNA coming together and joining
[1:37:27] together everything that's inside of us
[1:37:30] is a result of that the genetics okay
[1:37:34] and so all of that is coming we're
[1:37:36] coming back all the way back to the very
[1:37:37] beginning and looking at how that's
[1:37:40] coming through the human race right okay
[1:37:43] but then by predestination jesus said
[1:37:46] unto them if God we're your father you
[1:37:49] would love me think about that for a
[1:37:53] second
[1:37:54] they're saying he's telling them you are
[1:37:56] from the devil the reason why you're
[1:38:00] from the devil is because you don't love
[1:38:01] me and you can't hear my word and you're
[1:38:04] seeking to kill me why that's the nature
[1:38:07] of your daddy that's the nature of your
[1:38:10] father the devil did this at the
[1:38:12] beginning how did he do it how did he do
[1:38:14] it at the beginning Cain Cain killed
[1:38:17] Abel Abel had a revelation of how to
[1:38:20] worship God you must kill a lamb and
[1:38:24] that lamb is an innocent one that pushes
[1:38:28] your sins forward to the Lamb of God
[1:38:30] that's coming in the future it covers
[1:38:32] your sin and it pushes you forward Cain
[1:38:35] was angry he hated that and he killed
[1:38:39] Abel because of it it wasn't wrong that
[1:38:42] Cain offered fruits of the field to God
[1:38:44] he should have offered them but not in
[1:38:47] that order and not for that purpose God
[1:38:50] and even a God had mercy said well if
[1:38:53] you do well won't you be accepted
[1:38:56] there's a sin offering in the King James
[1:38:59] it says there's sin lying at the door
[1:39:01] and you have to rule over it but if you
[1:39:03] look at that word sin it literally means
[1:39:05] there's a sin offering kneeling at the
[1:39:09] door there's a
[1:39:11] lamb there that's ready to be offered
[1:39:14] for you pain if you would like to
[1:39:16] receive it it's right there for you and
[1:39:19] it's desires for you and you have to
[1:39:21] rule over it yeah but what did what it
[1:39:24] came do instead of going out and saying
[1:39:26] Abel would you please teach me about
[1:39:29] this I know you have a revelation from
[1:39:31] God what did he do he went out and spoke
[1:39:33] to him and if they started debating and
[1:39:35] fighting about religion and he kills it
[1:39:37] it's the very same picture that's
[1:39:40] happening in John chapter 8 and in the
[1:39:42] gospel but if God we're your father you
[1:39:47] would love me for I proceeded forth and
[1:39:49] came from God neither came I of myself
[1:39:52] but he sent me so if God's your father
[1:39:57] you love Jesus not just the Jesus that's
[1:40:01] preached by so-and-so or so-and-so the
[1:40:05] real genuine vindicated Jesus because
[1:40:08] remember in 2nd Corinthians 11 it says
[1:40:11] I'm concerned about you I'm concerned
[1:40:14] about you because as Satan the serpent
[1:40:18] beguiled Eve
[1:40:20] I'm afraid that someone else will come
[1:40:24] and preach to you another Jesus and we
[1:40:26] have not preached or another gospel and
[1:40:29] that you'll receive another spirit whom
[1:40:31] whom we have not preached and so there
[1:40:35] is another Jesus out there but it's not
[1:40:38] really the true living Jesus Christ it's
[1:40:42] a fake Jesus and it's actually what what
[1:40:46] is it result Paul's fear was that they
[1:40:48] would commit adultery against Christ he
[1:40:51] says he says I've espoused you as a
[1:40:55] chaste virgin to Christ and that's what
[1:40:58] his fear was that they would receive
[1:41:00] another Jesus and commit adultery
[1:41:03] against the true Bible Jesus oh ok so
[1:41:08] the true manifested Jesus Christ if if
[1:41:12] God we're your father you would love the
[1:41:15] true manifested Jesus Christ
[1:41:19] why because there's something placed
[1:41:21] inside of you by God in your soul that
[1:41:26] says yes to the Word of God amen
[1:41:30] why do you not understand my speech even
[1:41:32] because you know you cannot hear my word
[1:41:36] what is it they had nothing inside of
[1:41:39] them that could receive the word nothing
[1:41:41] inside of them that could even hear it
[1:41:45] forty-four you are of your father the
[1:41:47] devil and the lusts of your father you
[1:41:49] will do he was a murderer from the
[1:41:51] beginning and abode not in the truth
[1:41:53] because there's no truth in him when he
[1:41:55] speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he
[1:41:57] is a liar and the father of it and
[1:42:00] because I tell you the truth you believe
[1:42:02] me not o money which of you convinces me
[1:42:05] of sin and if I say the truth why do you
[1:42:07] not believe me he that is of God hears
[1:42:12] God's words either for hear them not
[1:42:16] because you are not of God okay so we we
[1:42:23] see this the faribault the Pharisees in
[1:42:26] Christ are connecting their Parenthood
[1:42:29] to their works right they're connecting
[1:42:36] the fact that they're connect they're
[1:42:37] with Abraham that that was that's what
[1:42:42] the Jews saw is their safety we are
[1:42:45] Abraham's children therefore we are from
[1:42:48] God and Jesus says if you were Abraham's
[1:42:52] teknon his children another place he
[1:42:55] says I know you're Abraham's seed I know
[1:42:58] you're I know you're literally from the
[1:43:01] children of Israel but you're not
[1:43:03] predestinated your Serpent's seed
[1:43:08] because you're rejecting me if you're
[1:43:10] Abraham's teknon his beloved children
[1:43:14] with his same nature you you would do
[1:43:16] the works of Abraham amen and so the
[1:43:23] elect they have the capability to hear
[1:43:28] and receive the word so that the other
[1:43:31] ones
[1:43:32] there's no place for the word in you so
[1:43:35] what's the opposite of that the elect
[1:43:39] have a place for the word in them what
[1:43:42] is that place that's the soul that's
[1:43:46] that's what's predestinated by God and
[1:43:49] so they can they can hear they can love
[1:43:53] the manifested Jesus now there's lots of
[1:43:55] Jesus's you know you go to a charismatic
[1:43:58] church today and they'll tell you Jesus
[1:44:01] is going to give you everything you ever
[1:44:03] dreamed of as long as you give money to
[1:44:07] our church if you sow the seed to our
[1:44:10] church which means give us money then
[1:44:13] Jesus is going to pour out his blessings
[1:44:16] and you can continue to wear your funny
[1:44:19] hair and you can continue to paint your
[1:44:22] face and go and wear your bikinis and so
[1:44:26] forth and Jesus loves you except for
[1:44:29] that's the devil that's not Jesus Christ
[1:44:33] that's a false doctrine and many many
[1:44:36] Christians people who are sincere whom I
[1:44:40] love whom whom I see and say there are
[1:44:43] very nice people they're deceived by it
[1:44:45] why because it will be so close
[1:44:48] it'll deceive the elect if possible and
[1:44:51] so they have miracles they have things
[1:44:54] that are happening in their meetings but
[1:44:57] what is it it's not the Jesus of the
[1:44:59] Bible it's a strong delusion actually is
[1:45:04] what it is and you know it's to me it's
[1:45:09] it's sad when you see that because there
[1:45:13] is a true reality and it's not far off
[1:45:15] it's not hard to find it's right here in
[1:45:19] the scriptures but people want their own
[1:45:21] ways their own ideas verse 19 of chapter
[1:45:25] 8 then said they unto Him where is thy
[1:45:29] father jesus answered you don't know me
[1:45:32] and you don't know my father
[1:45:34] why these are people dedicated to
[1:45:37] serving Almighty God with their whole
[1:45:40] heart he says you don't even know who
[1:45:42] God is
[1:45:46] they've left everything they've
[1:45:48] dedicated all they are to serving God
[1:45:52] and teaching the commandments of God but
[1:45:55] what was it they could God was standing
[1:45:57] in front of them manifested and they
[1:46:00] said that is the devil what do they do
[1:46:03] today what do they do today when Jesus
[1:46:08] was manifested by the pillar of fire
[1:46:11] through a humble prophet what did they
[1:46:14] say that's the devil they couldn't see
[1:46:20] God hidden behind they never can see God
[1:46:24] hidden behind a veil the the rulers of
[1:46:28] the synagogue so to speak the Orthodox
[1:46:31] Church was always wrong
[1:46:34] should only one place in the Bible where
[1:46:37] the Orthodox Church the one that was in
[1:46:40] power and control was the one that was
[1:46:42] right on the word brother Jose is there
[1:46:46] one spot in the Bible where the Orthodox
[1:46:49] Church was correct she had find it
[1:46:52] always they were the ones persecuting
[1:46:55] the truth they were always fighting
[1:47:00] against the truth and Jesus says you
[1:47:03] don't you don't even know God if you
[1:47:07] know if you'd known me you'd have known
[1:47:10] my father also what is it because Jesus
[1:47:13] was manifesting the word for that time
[1:47:16] and because he was manifesting the word
[1:47:19] for that time they couldn't recognize it
[1:47:22] they said it's the devil why because
[1:47:26] their of their father the devil they do
[1:47:29] the works of their father
[1:47:31] I mean look we can continue on then said
[1:47:36] the Jews will kill himself because he's
[1:47:38] say where I go you cannot come said unto
[1:47:41] them you're from beneath oh my goodness
[1:47:45] you're from hell
[1:47:47] I'm from above you're of this world I'm
[1:47:51] not from this world
[1:47:52] I said therefore unto you that you shall
[1:47:54] die in your sins for if you believe not
[1:47:57] that I am he you shall die in your
[1:48:00] [Music]
[1:48:02] again all through history let's not just
[1:48:05] put this to the time of Jesus I was back
[1:48:09] there I for sure I would receive it go
[1:48:12] through all of history and I ask you
[1:48:15] God was veiling himself behind human
[1:48:18] flesh in portion in the prophets in
[1:48:21] fullness in Jesus but in portion all
[1:48:24] through the ages and what did the people
[1:48:26] do was just a man that's what they think
[1:48:29] just a man making himself something
[1:48:31] Makia they threw him in the prison
[1:48:33] Isaiah they sawed him in half Jeremiah
[1:48:36] again and again they persecuted in what
[1:48:39] was it the people and power could didn't
[1:48:42] want to be told they were wrong they
[1:48:44] want it oh yes you're just fine yes I
[1:48:47] want to pet you the right pet him the
[1:48:49] right way and he'll be happy and he'll
[1:48:51] take care of our financial needs but the
[1:48:53] true man of God came and said you're
[1:48:55] wrong
[1:48:56] returned to God well we never left him
[1:48:58] we're the ones that are in authority
[1:49:01] don't miss that because sometimes we
[1:49:05] look and we see around and say oh it's
[1:49:07] oh and so they've got a big church so on
[1:49:09] so they've got so what what did Jesus
[1:49:12] say if you're not fear not megachurch
[1:49:17] fear not little little flock
[1:49:20] you see you have to that's the Bible way
[1:49:23] if you're not little flock and you know
[1:49:27] what is it it's recognizing Jesus Christ
[1:49:30] on display today think about it for a
[1:49:35] second many people recognize Jesus
[1:49:38] Christ on display in nineteen forty
[1:49:40] fifty and 1960 but what about today what
[1:49:45] about his present tense truth today
[1:49:48] we're not just talking about back in
[1:49:50] william branham time we rejoicing over
[1:49:53] his manifestation then but he's today he
[1:49:57] is doing something through a fivefold
[1:49:59] ministry and people are rejecting that
[1:50:03] and what is it what is it doing they
[1:50:05] can't recognize God veiled in human
[1:50:07] flesh today in the bride amen
[1:50:12] they said unto Him verse 25 who are you
[1:50:17] that's a good question
[1:50:19] who are you but they weren't listening
[1:50:21] for an answer they're just saying who
[1:50:23] are you
[1:50:24] that jesus saith unto them even the same
[1:50:27] I said unto you from the beginning been
[1:50:30] telling you all along
[1:50:31] you're not listening that's the problem
[1:50:33] I have many things to say in to judge of
[1:50:39] you but he that sent me is true and I
[1:50:41] speak to the world those things that
[1:50:43] which I have heard of him he understood
[1:50:46] not that he spake to them of the Father
[1:50:47] then said Jesus unto them when you have
[1:50:50] lifted up the Son of Man then shall you
[1:50:53] know that I am he and that I do nothing
[1:50:55] of myself but as my father has taught me
[1:50:58] I speak these things and he that sent me
[1:51:01] with me the father has not left me alone
[1:51:03] for I all would do always those things
[1:51:05] that please him as he spake these words
[1:51:09] many believed on him my and then said
[1:51:13] Jesus to those Jews which believed on
[1:51:15] him if so they they were believers they
[1:51:19] confessed to be believers Jesus says if
[1:51:22] you continue in my word think about that
[1:51:25] for a minute they can't stay stagnant in
[1:51:28] the past what if they said well I
[1:51:30] believe in Jesus but I don't need to go
[1:51:31] to Pentecost and receive the Holy Ghost
[1:51:33] they needed the present tense word for
[1:51:36] that time if you continue in my word
[1:51:40] then are you my disciples and he shall
[1:51:43] know the truth and the truth shall set
[1:51:44] you free
[1:51:47] amen and so these these things we look
[1:51:52] and see what is what is that genuine
[1:51:56] manifestation of the life that was
[1:51:59] birthed into Adam first and then passed
[1:52:02] on to the human race now we know again
[1:52:06] it's their prayer predestination now
[1:52:08] amongst all nations tribes tongues and
[1:52:11] kingdoms it's not a race thing at all
[1:52:15] and so what is it how do we recognize
[1:52:17] that it's people that can hear they can
[1:52:22] hear and respond in obedience
[1:52:25] to the word it's not the one that joins
[1:52:30] a church it's not that one that's safe
[1:52:33] in a big denomination but it's the one
[1:52:36] that can hear and recognize the
[1:52:39] manifestation of Jesus Christ today and
[1:52:42] so Jesus says that if you were Abraham's
[1:52:47] children you'd love me you do the works
[1:52:51] of Abraham if God we're your father you
[1:52:53] would love me you can you have a place
[1:52:56] inside of you from my word what is that
[1:52:59] that's a lot that's where there's life
[1:53:01] the life coming to the life what is it
[1:53:04] we were born in this hybrid condition
[1:53:06] right so our first birth was wrong we
[1:53:09] must be born again that's why we need
[1:53:12] the new birth our first birth was
[1:53:15] corruptible with under the hybrid seed
[1:53:18] therefore we need a new birth from
[1:53:22] heaven but it's what is it doing it's
[1:53:25] actually quickening that predestinated
[1:53:27] seed that's inside of us so that life is
[1:53:30] there like dormant laying dormant and
[1:53:33] then the Holy Ghost comes and quickens
[1:53:36] that to life
[1:53:37] when we recognize the word remember we
[1:53:40] read before we're born again not of
[1:53:42] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[1:53:46] the Word of God which lives and abides
[1:53:48] forever that incorruptible seed coming
[1:53:51] to us brings that which is in our soul
[1:53:54] to life but there's some they hear the
[1:53:57] word and they hate it or they hear the
[1:54:00] word and they have no capabilities of
[1:54:02] responding to it so what is it what is
[1:54:06] the difference that's life and death why
[1:54:10] because those who are predestinated come
[1:54:12] from the life of God they'll never die
[1:54:15] Jesus says he that believes in me shall
[1:54:18] never die
[1:54:20] my what a vision can you say that about
[1:54:23] yourself
[1:54:24] can you speak that over your own life I
[1:54:26] think we should okay you're laying in
[1:54:29] the deathbed and and you die but you
[1:54:31] should still be speaking I believe in
[1:54:34] Jesus Christ I'll never die amen but
[1:54:37] some
[1:54:38] they do die and so that's those two
[1:54:41] different life's those two different
[1:54:42] seed lines one is ordained to go on
[1:54:46] justice God goes on one is ordained to
[1:54:50] go down to die they must they must die
[1:54:53] because their life is not from God and
[1:54:56] so what are they going to do they'll
[1:54:59] eventually go out of existence
[1:55:00] completely God will punish them they'll
[1:55:04] be tormented for a season but then when
[1:55:07] once they've reached whatever that place
[1:55:10] that God has brought them to then they
[1:55:12] go out of existence why because they're
[1:55:15] not from God
[1:55:15] they're of their father the devil and so
[1:55:18] it's so it's it's we can differentiate
[1:55:21] it based on what you recognize right
[1:55:26] recognizing the manifested word in your
[1:55:30] age in your time and even that's what
[1:55:33] brother Branham tells us that's the
[1:55:34] evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:35] seeing the manifested word for your age
[1:55:38] and so that's that's the place where
[1:55:41] it's different because it's a love
[1:55:43] there's a love that's inside of you you
[1:55:46] know when we love our Father you think
[1:55:48] about even on this sinful earth and you
[1:55:51] see children in foster kids situations
[1:55:55] or terrible they still love their
[1:55:57] parents maybe their parents were the
[1:56:00] worst human beings on the planet and
[1:56:02] very terrible to them but yet they still
[1:56:05] love their parents and so there's this
[1:56:07] is Jesus is saying if if God we're your
[1:56:11] father you would love me what is it
[1:56:13] because we recognize that our Father is
[1:56:17] the manifested word for this age amen
[1:56:20] and so we just love it we just rejoice
[1:56:24] in it and God reveals it word on top of
[1:56:28] word and he transforms our life word on
[1:56:32] top of word right so that seed has to
[1:56:38] come to life because what does the
[1:56:40] scripture say he that started the began
[1:56:43] a good work and you will be faithful to
[1:56:44] complete it so that seed that's in you
[1:56:48] will grow to the full fruit that it's
[1:56:50] supposed to grow to
[1:56:51] nothing is going to prevent that why
[1:56:53] because it's God doing the work you know
[1:56:56] we the scripture says that we should
[1:56:59] work out our salvation with fear and
[1:57:01] trembling why because it's God that
[1:57:04] works in you to will and to do of his
[1:57:06] good pleasure in other words if God is
[1:57:08] working in you there's going to be a
[1:57:10] work that's being produced in your life
[1:57:12] to get closer to him to be more like him
[1:57:16] to have a desire for him to have a fire
[1:57:18] for him and so there's nothing that can
[1:57:21] block that actually from happening
[1:57:24] because God has put it in the seed you
[1:57:28] know when an apple when when an apple
[1:57:31] seed goes to the ground it's watered and
[1:57:34] it starts coming to life everything that
[1:57:37] that apple tree becomes actually was in
[1:57:41] the seed in itself and so in those
[1:57:45] conditions and God makes sure we were in
[1:57:47] the right conditions and makes sure that
[1:57:50] we come to life so whatever is in that
[1:57:52] seed that he's predestinated there in
[1:57:54] your soul it's going to produce
[1:57:56] precisely what God wants it to produce
[1:57:58] and there's nothing that's going to
