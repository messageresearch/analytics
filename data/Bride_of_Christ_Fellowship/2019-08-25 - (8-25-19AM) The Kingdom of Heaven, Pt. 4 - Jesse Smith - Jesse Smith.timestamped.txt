[32:15] praise the Lord God bless everybody nice
[32:18] to see Karen and Brenda and Sarah for me
[32:20] it's been an extra week haven't seen ya
[32:23] so Lord bless you I'm have to use the
[32:32] handheld mic this morning so like I like
[32:35] Wednesday night it's Matthew chapter 25
[32:49] let's just read one scripture here just
[32:55] for times sake Matthew 25 let's look at
[33:04] verse 15 let's just read 25 15 and let's
[33:07] read that together if we can Matthew 25
[33:10] 15 is that on Lydia okay thank you
[33:14] Matthew 25 15 let's read that on three
[33:17] and then we'll read one more scripture
[33:18] in Matthew 25 15 on three ready one two
[33:21] three and unto one he gave five talents
[33:25] to another two and to another one to
[33:29] every man according to his several
[33:31] ability and straightway took his journey
[33:34] praise God let's go to Luke 19 so that's
[33:39] the parable of the talents Luke 19 has
[33:43] the parable of the pounds
[33:44] some people think they're exactly
[33:46] identical but they're they're not
[33:48] they're close but they're not exactly
[33:53] identical they're spoken at different
[33:54] times in two different groups of people
[33:56] so we like to look at that this morning
[33:58] the Lord will help us to do that
[34:08] I like to read verse 15 I thought well
[34:11] after your Sita will read a little more
[34:13] this and it came to pass that when he
[34:15] was returned having received the kingdom
[34:17] then he commanded these servants to be
[34:20] called unto him to whom he had given the
[34:22] money that he might know how much every
[34:24] man had gained by trading then came the
[34:27] first saying Lord thy pound ass gained
[34:29] 10 pounds and he sent him well thou good
[34:33] servant because thou has been faithful
[34:35] in a very little have the authority over
[34:39] ten cities and came the second saying
[34:42] via
[34:42] I'm sorry Lord thy pound hath gained
[34:44] five pounds and he said likewise to him
[34:47] be thou also over five cities may God
[34:51] has blessings rimas work you may be
[34:53] seated I don't see brother Aaron this
[35:00] morning so I'll send him a text after
[35:02] service anybody heard from him I may not
[35:04] be here no if you had to work maybe a
[35:06] double shift today and that so praise
[35:12] the Lord it's good to be with the ideas
[35:14] I want to show a few slides I do not
[35:16] have all the quotes ready to go for
[35:20] slides but I do want to show a few by
[35:24] the grace of the Lord just a minute I'd
[35:26] like to pull up my notes here okay so
[35:35] well let's look at here at part four I
[35:38] believe we're on part 4 yeah of the
[35:40] Kingdom of Heaven now just as a kind of
[35:45] a little bit of overview I like to
[35:49] direct your attention that little lamp
[35:51] there there's a lamp like the foolish
[35:52] virgins would have had it's kind of like
[35:54] dated to that time period and so you
[35:58] know we've been looking at some of those
[36:00] thoughts last few Wednesday's ago we
[36:02] looked at the wise virgins and the
[36:04] foolish and so the wise would have had
[36:06] these vessels they would had to trim the
[36:09] wicks you know the wicks would have
[36:11] burnt down so with the foolish of trim
[36:15] them but then the foolish had other
[36:17] vests I'm sorry the wise had other
[36:19] vessels of oil that they could pour into
[36:22] we're the foolish didn't have that and
[36:24] so that was made them wise everybody had
[36:26] everybody had a lamp right everybody had
[36:28] a wick but not everybody had extra oil
[36:31] and I'm glad I got extra oil not maybe
[36:34] on my flat ash sure oil maybe on my mind
[36:39] but I've got extra oil in my soul and
[36:42] that's what I'm packing for the rapture
[36:44] ain't a head praise the Lord because
[36:47] even even though even to make believer
[36:49] like Judas you know where Jesus says
[36:51] you've done many wonders miracles
[36:54] prophesied in my name cast out devils
[36:57] he'll tell them I never knew you so even
[37:01] they can have oil in their minds you
[37:03] know they can get in the Spirit of God
[37:04] long enough to do miracles but then when
[37:07] they leave that anointing off then they
[37:10] go off and work iniquity and the things
[37:12] of the world so we do want the anointing
[37:15] in all parts of us well we want to make
[37:18] sure we have the Holy Ghost in our souls
[37:20] aim ahead and that our life testifies to
[37:24] that that we live the life of a real
[37:26] Christian the greatest miracle of course
[37:29] is the miracle of a change life
[37:31] hallelujah
[37:32] now as even last week with brother
[37:34] Brooks you know he was we were just
[37:36] fellowship inning and he was saying how
[37:38] we were just talking about you know the
[37:40] book that I wrote and he was sharing how
[37:42] he gave it out to many people and he was
[37:45] saying brother Jesse I could never do
[37:46] that and it just kind of struck
[37:48] something in my in my mind you know how
[37:49] how we'll look at today we're looking at
[37:51] the talents again today he said I could
[37:54] never do that but I look at his life and
[37:56] I could never sing like him and even
[38:00] some of the miracles like he's seen
[38:01] great miracles you know you know he's
[38:06] prayed for people with cancer and
[38:08] they've been instantly healed I've never
[38:10] done that myself and I may never do that
[38:13] but then he can recognize those things
[38:15] that God may use me to do that he could
[38:17] never do we all believe in miracles you
[38:21] know we all believe in the power of God
[38:24] but we're you know we're trying to learn
[38:26] here and through the series on the
[38:29] purpose and now on the kingdom of heaven
[38:30] that we can find our purpose in life we
[38:34] can we can see our our gift
[38:35] in life and then be obedient to what God
[38:37] has us to do and so that just really
[38:41] encouraged me you know that brother
[38:43] Brooks would say something like that
[38:44] because it just kind of gave me like one
[38:45] of those moments where you kind of
[38:48] realize that's right I try to do I'm
[38:50] just trying to follow the leading Lord
[38:52] what God would have me to do and I just
[38:54] want to be faithful to that and let's
[38:58] look here I like to you know go I just
[39:02] want to go over a little bit on these
[39:03] you know I was writing I'm writing the
[39:06] next book but I wrote a chapter on the
[39:09] kingdom of the mysteries of the kingdom
[39:10] of heaven because Jesus called it a
[39:12] mystery and I wrote on this there's
[39:15] seven mysteries in in Matthew 13
[39:18] well something struck me a few months
[39:20] ago I think it was in June and I thought
[39:22] matters there may be more mysteries or
[39:26] parables about the kingdom of heaven and
[39:27] so I thought well I better go check the
[39:30] Bible before I print this book out and I
[39:33] found I found nine more there 16
[39:37] parables that Jesus calls parables of
[39:40] the kingdom like he'll say the kingdom
[39:44] of heaven is like unto this the kingdom
[39:45] of heaven is like unto that and so I
[39:48] went and setting them out and I'm almost
[39:50] done with the chapter now I think I'm on
[39:51] the 15th parable I got one more to go
[39:53] and so I just want to show you the
[39:55] themes real briefly I'll be probably
[39:57] preaching on them Lord willing in the
[39:58] next few months we'll see where the Lord
[40:00] will take us but two of them deal with
[40:04] sin these two deal with sin the grain of
[40:07] mustard seed twice in the church age
[40:09] book where the RAM said this parable
[40:10] deals with the false church and then the
[40:15] leaven hid in three measures of course
[40:19] that's where the Roman Catholic Church
[40:20] so two of the mysteries of the kingdom
[40:23] of heaven deal with how sin gets in the
[40:25] false Church and how it tries to pervert
[40:28] the true church but the true church
[40:30] overcomes amen
[40:32] three of the parables deal with the Holy
[40:34] Ghost and the rapture the King son of
[40:38] course is the wedding garment parable
[40:39] and the garment represents the baptism
[40:42] of the Holy Ghost cuz a man without the
[40:44] wedding garment he's thrown out of the
[40:46] the wedding he doesn't get to be a part
[40:48] of the wedding because he's not boy
[40:49] again the ten virgins of course we're
[40:52] off remember that one and then the great
[40:55] supper that one's not coming to me right
[40:58] now the great supper
[41:00] off they look that one up I already
[41:01] wrote about it but I just can't remember
[41:02] it right now two of them deal with the
[41:05] end kind end time conditions Jesus
[41:08] specifically says the wheat and the
[41:10] tares are a parable for the end time
[41:13] because at the end time he says there's
[41:15] a harvest and the net cast into the sea
[41:18] Jesus specifically says this parable
[41:20] deals with the end of the world how the
[41:22] angels gather at the end of the world
[41:25] and then they they separate the good
[41:29] fish to the Lord and the rest sarcastic
[41:31] into the waters one of the parables or
[41:35] the mysteries deals with the wicked
[41:37] husbandmen that's with Jews and Gentiles
[41:39] because the Jews don't want the the
[41:41] kingdom the the rich man takes it from
[41:44] them and gives it to another people and
[41:46] that's us by God's grace aren't you glad
[41:48] to be a part of the kingdom of God I'm
[41:50] more happy about that than anything I
[41:52] know amen
[41:53] that I can have a part in the kingdom of
[41:55] God amen and there's five a deal with
[41:59] salvation the treasure hid in the field
[42:03] so this is salvation to the Gentile and
[42:06] of course they're the Jews at the begin
[42:07] the church age the pearl of great price
[42:09] the laborers in the vineyard the
[42:12] unmerciful servant and the seed cast
[42:14] into the ground and then three of them
[42:18] deal with your stewardship which we're
[42:19] looking at two of them one of them were
[42:21] we're really familiar with the four
[42:23] grounds of course I preached on that
[42:26] numerous times but this the service and
[42:30] stewardship is the parables here we want
[42:33] to look at again today by God's grace so
[42:38] if we could let's go back to Luke 19 why
[42:40] don't we just start right there
[42:50] let's go to verse 11 new Luke 19:11 now
[42:58] if you if you read earlier in the
[43:01] chapter which I'm not going to read all
[43:03] that you know
[43:04] Zacchaeus gets saved Jesus is with a
[43:06] multitude of people memories walking and
[43:09] Zacchaeus climbs up in the tree you know
[43:11] the little guy any-any and he cries out
[43:14] you know and and I'm sorry Jesus stops
[43:16] and points him out because Jesus
[43:17] discerned his life or the mem Talde the
[43:19] story of that what a beautiful story
[43:20] Zacchaeus his wife was praying for more
[43:22] he called her Rebecca remember that
[43:24] Rebecca was praying for his the key is
[43:26] to get saved and it's a great beautiful
[43:28] drama and he gets saved and and Jesus
[43:32] was gonna go to his house you know but
[43:35] then in verse 11 Luke 19:11 sir
[43:38] surrounding Jesus and he's very soon to
[43:40] be crucified
[43:41] it sits within maybe a weaker
[43:43] week-and-a-half here he's very very
[43:47] close to to his his death but he's with
[43:50] ya in fact later in the chapter is the
[43:52] triumphal entry so he's about a week
[43:53] away from his from his crucifixion less
[43:58] than a week and so he has all these
[44:01] people and they're there they're
[44:03] thinking oh my this is gonna be the
[44:05] season where that awful Roman kingdoms
[44:08] gonna be brought down and we're gonna
[44:10] bring back the kingdom of David see they
[44:14] they were thinking natural Kingdom right
[44:17] everything my Jesus has raised the dead
[44:19] he raised Lazarus not long ago he's done
[44:22] all these great things for three years
[44:23] all this famous red a ball or brown
[44:25] about about about him rather and they
[44:27] think my this is the time when we'll
[44:30] know lot longer bout a Caesar we want to
[44:33] pay taxes the Caesar right we wish you'd
[44:37] have to pay our taxes that can all give
[44:39] it to God right but we can we can relate
[44:43] to how they would feel that way and and
[44:47] they're thinking my this is the time and
[44:49] we want to be ruled and we have to be
[44:51] take a census anymore what to pay taxes
[44:54] anymore you know we're gonna rebuild a
[44:58] greater temple and even Herod's temple
[45:00] you know they thought they were really
[45:02] going to
[45:03] right here so Jesus tells us parable to
[45:06] kind of correct their thinking Jesus was
[45:09] the word right always correcting
[45:11] people's thinking aren't you glad amen
[45:13] and I hope that's why you come to church
[45:15] that's why I come so Jesus can correct
[45:17] my thinking because sometimes I don't
[45:20] think the right thoughts neither to use
[45:23] sometimes you know we all fall short of
[45:25] God's glory they thought my this is the
[45:28] kingdom of God is gonna appear
[45:29] physically in other words they thought
[45:32] the millennia was going to be on my the
[45:35] memes coming
[45:36] thousand years of peace and I will build
[45:38] our houses you know and but see they
[45:42] were there about two thousand years off
[45:44] you know but God was merciful to them
[45:48] amen
[45:49] Jesus was merciful so he tells them this
[45:51] story to correct their thinking verse 12
[45:55] and he said therefore a certain nobleman
[45:57] went into the far country to receive for
[46:00] himself a kingdom and to return and he
[46:02] called his ten servants so see there's a
[46:06] similarity with the talents there's ten
[46:08] ten virgins ten sermons and he delivered
[46:11] them ten pounds instead of them occupy
[46:14] till I come now notice the whole group
[46:17] gets ten pounds ten servants ten pounds
[46:20] and earlier we read that each servant
[46:23] got one pound now a pound I did the
[46:27] research a pound is very small it was
[46:29] only like $15,000 now to you to most of
[46:33] us that would be small maybe great to
[46:35] some now you understand what I'm saying
[46:38] but it's much smaller than the talent
[46:40] the talent we saw in Wednesday was about
[46:42] a million dollars so that's why you know
[46:46] Jesus later on says you've been faithful
[46:48] with very little but I'll make you rule
[46:53] over much geez doesn't say that and the
[46:56] parable of the talents he doesn't say
[46:58] that he only says it in this parable
[47:00] because this has spoken to a multitude
[47:03] imagine a whole multitude is listening
[47:05] to him and he says let me tell you this
[47:07] parable I'm in to give all my servants
[47:10] one pound and they thought that's not
[47:12] very much money I mean you could get a
[47:14] good car for that you could get a good
[47:15] chariot for that
[47:16] out of money that's not really like a
[47:18] million dollars you know I wouldn't
[47:20] wouldn't be like a mansion or anything
[47:22] like that and you could even get a
[47:24] mansion for a million dollars today but
[47:29] he just tells the parable then everybody
[47:33] gets one everybody gets a little bit of
[47:35] the kingdom of God amen
[47:37] he says occupy until I come now verse 14
[47:43] now here's where it's a little different
[47:44] as well you don't find this same
[47:45] statement in the talents but his
[47:48] citizens hated him now who's that the
[47:52] Jews Jesus's Jesus came to his own but
[47:57] his own received him not so he tells his
[48:01] servants which were going to be the the
[48:03] believers the Christians whether they
[48:04] are George então occupy till I come I'm
[48:08] giving you my income I'm giving you my
[48:10] power my authority in other words the
[48:12] authority of the gospel when you
[48:14] citizens hate him a set of messages or
[48:17] sent a message after I'm saying we will
[48:18] not have this man to reign over us so so
[48:21] Jesus goes away but then the Jews and
[48:24] the message they send this message to
[48:26] Jesus we don't want him to rule over us
[48:29] a church what about us a lot of people
[48:32] come to message churches but are they
[48:34] letting the word reign over them amen
[48:38] praise God are they really doing what
[48:41] brother Branham said or not I think we
[48:44] see it in their lives right we see in
[48:46] people's lives they have a form of
[48:48] godliness but they deny the power to
[48:50] change their life they don't let the
[48:52] word rule the word doesn't get first
[48:54] place praise God
[48:56] so we see the the application to today
[48:59] and it came to pass that when he was
[49:02] returned having received the kingdom
[49:03] then he commanded these servants to be
[49:05] called unto him to whom he had given the
[49:07] money that he might know how much every
[49:09] man had gained by trading then came the
[49:12] first saying Lord thy pound hath gained
[49:15] 10 pounds so about a hundred fifty
[49:18] thousand dollars he had at the end
[49:20] so from fifteen thousand to a hundred
[49:22] fifty thousand and he said to him well
[49:26] thou good servant because thou has been
[49:28] faithful in a very little
[49:30] so see that's just a little bit amount
[49:32] of money right 15,000 - Jesus that's
[49:34] just a little amount of money you can
[49:36] get a used car for that much money
[49:38] that's that's not too much that's a
[49:40] little you've been faithful in a very
[49:42] little he says have that authority over
[49:47] ten cities but if you and I can be
[49:49] faithful with the very little he's given
[49:51] us he'll Griffi give us great rewards
[49:55] God is faithful God is looking for us
[49:59] just to be faithful and us to be
[50:01] diligent with what he's given to us we
[50:05] don't we must be content remember
[50:06] godliness with contentment is great gain
[50:09] amen these servants had to be content
[50:12] with I just got fifteen thousand I'll
[50:14] just invested he gets back now I'm not a
[50:17] businessman I have no idea if you gave
[50:20] me fifteen thousand and said invest it I
[50:22] wouldn't know what to do I really
[50:23] wouldn't I just take it to the bank and
[50:24] put in the bank but at least you get
[50:26] some interest on that but some of you
[50:28] aren't real savvy with your mind you
[50:30] know with your business you could invest
[50:31] in that make investment there and turn a
[50:33] profit I don't know if I could do that
[50:35] but Jesus says you just gotta invest in
[50:39] that and be faithful with that and he
[50:42] said then I'll make you ruler over much
[50:44] so we can just you know if we can just
[50:47] manage a small ministry if we can just
[50:50] manage a small amount of money then
[50:53] Jesus says I'll make you ruler over much
[50:55] so we must not be overwhelmed right we
[50:59] must not let ourselves get overwhelmed
[51:01] we just have to realize this is a very
[51:03] small amount
[51:04] I've just got to apply the word of God
[51:06] until he returns now he says verse 18
[51:12] and the second came saying Lord thy
[51:13] pound hath gained five pounds and he
[51:17] said likewise him be thou also over five
[51:19] cities so one person had a tenfold
[51:22] increase one person had a five-fold
[51:25] increase alls Jesus won to see was an
[51:29] increase amen
[51:30] on an area because the last man has no
[51:33] increase amen all Jesus wants you to do
[51:36] is just so show some effort and show
[51:40] that you're invested and you're fully
[51:42] devoted to the things of God
[51:44] amen whether it's five times you you
[51:47] know five times the testimonies are or
[51:50] your five times more sensitive to the
[51:52] things of God or ten times or you see
[51:55] ten times as many testimonies as you did
[51:57] you know all Jesus wants you to see is
[51:59] that you just don't bury in the earth
[52:01] put it to use do something for the
[52:03] kingdom of God amen
[52:05] that's all I wants us to see nah not not
[52:07] not - he doesn't want us to be
[52:08] overwhelmed with with with shame or with
[52:11] fear or with doubt he doesn't want us to
[52:13] doubt he just wants us to do something
[52:16] with what we have amen
[52:17] I would say the first thing to do it
[52:20] like I said before I think this is where
[52:22] God's taking us there's first to
[52:24] recognize what we do have we've got to
[52:27] recognize and I got a quote for that
[52:28] later on brother Graham says that
[52:29] something very similar first find out
[52:32] what you've got amen
[52:35] we need to find out what God's given us
[52:38] amen that's gonna come through prayer
[52:40] it's gonna come through seeking God's
[52:42] face amen we got to find out what he's
[52:46] given to us now some of us it's obvious
[52:47] like like we said on Wednesday with Amen
[52:49] in Malachi those who can sing our
[52:52] sisters Naomi I can sing song specials
[52:54] you know that's kind of obvious you know
[52:56] where gods bless them but the thing is
[52:58] they may have more gifts than that right
[53:02] you may have more than that and so the
[53:06] thing to do is find now all that you
[53:07] have find all that the rich man's the
[53:10] nobleman has left you with and then go
[53:13] to investing in what he's left you with
[53:15] glory now look at verse 20 and another
[53:20] came saying Lord behold there's that
[53:21] here's thy pound which I've kept laid up
[53:23] in a napkin
[53:25] that's that interesting napkin seems to
[53:28] represent death doesn't it because when
[53:29] Jesus rose from the dead he the Bible
[53:31] said they went to his is suppl occur and
[53:34] they found the napkin so napkin seems to
[53:37] represent death he just he was dead you
[53:39] know he just he didn't live for Jesus
[53:41] like he ought to have he's really we're
[53:43] not Li we're not actually living until
[53:46] we're doing what God told us to do right
[53:48] because you can be dead yet yet still be
[53:50] alive amen
[53:51] you can be dead spiritually but
[53:53] physically alive right so you went and
[53:57] put it in a
[53:58] in now verse 21 fry fear daeso see this
[54:03] is the kind of fear that the book of
[54:06] Revelation talks about how the fearful
[54:08] will not inherit the kingdom of God
[54:10] praise God he said I feared thee this is
[54:15] the wrong kind of fear
[54:17] this isn't godly fear for I fear thee
[54:20] because thou are an austere man of
[54:22] Sirius Hardman now take us up that thou
[54:25] layest not down and reap is that that
[54:27] did not sow not I said it on Wednesday
[54:29] that's not true this man is lying
[54:31] this man is deceived God only reaps
[54:35] where he sews let me say this
[54:37] the whole world's God's anyway amen
[54:40] every state is God's Amen every seed
[54:43] gets lice from God so any good thing
[54:45] every good and perfect gift is from the
[54:48] Lord amen so this man's wrong he's
[54:51] deceived any good thing comes from God
[54:53] all evil comes from Satan if there's
[54:56] anything good if there's any life if
[54:58] there's any harvest it came by God's
[55:00] doing amen this man is deceived he's a
[55:05] sinner he's fearful he's not the spirit
[55:07] of fear rule his life as an excuse not
[55:10] to be a part of the kingdom of God see
[55:16] but the exact opposite is true brothers
[55:19] and sisters the exact opposite is true
[55:21] in fact jesus told his disciples he said
[55:24] you are entering into the labors of
[55:27] others amen
[55:29] see God everything God harvests he is
[55:32] rightfully his but some of the blessings
[55:35] we received today we're actually
[55:37] entering into the work of others ain't
[55:39] we're the ones hey men that are that are
[55:41] gaining from other people's labors
[55:43] praise God amen we're the ones that
[55:47] benefit praise God from other people's
[55:49] prayers that other people's works right
[55:52] some of you are being blessed by the
[55:55] prayers of your mothers and fathers I
[55:57] think a sister Karen godly parents she
[56:01] had sister Naomi
[56:02] he got godly parents you had my mother
[56:04] although not the message she did pray a
[56:06] lot some of us are entering into the
[56:09] blessings of our parents
[56:11] praise God hey man and God protects us
[56:15] in God God's blessing by generation just
[56:18] like he curses my generation look at the
[56:21] I don't have time to go there but
[56:23] haven't studying I wrote it down but
[56:25] look at the lineage of Elvis Presley his
[56:29] daughter and his wife wife and look at
[56:32] the evil that has happened look at his
[56:34] now grandson and all the evils that
[56:36] follow those people see that's
[56:39] generational curses aren't you glad for
[56:42] the generational blessings caused by the
[56:44] blood of Jesus Christ and your your your
[56:47] your family and your relatives accepting
[56:50] the power in that blood and now the
[56:51] blessings overflow into your life amen
[56:54] how do new you look at you know Lisa
[57:01] Marie Lisa Marie Presley how she got off
[57:03] and married Michael Jackson then get
[57:05] divorced and then they remarry again so
[57:07] what follows their life adultery
[57:10] fornication Bible said whoremongers will
[57:14] burn the lake of fire
[57:17] look what follows that type of lifestyle
[57:20] oh thank God for the ability the grace
[57:25] of God to live a holy life in this hour
[57:28] amen
[57:30] I'll just say like this I don't know if
[57:32] my relatives were listening but my mom
[57:34] drugged all of us children to church but
[57:38] not one of our siblings is divorced and
[57:41] remarried like some of our cousins
[57:43] neither does our family have the drug
[57:46] addictions like some of my cousins do my
[57:48] mom faithfully took all the children
[57:50] Church her siblings did it and now they
[57:52] got drug abuse mixed marriages all kinds
[57:55] of evil things uncleanness the boxer II
[57:59] alcoholism drug abuse see the blessings
[58:02] of God God is a rewarder of those who
[58:05] diligently seek Him amen
[58:07] be not deceived God is not mocked
[58:10] whatsoever a man soweth that will you
[58:12] repay men praise God because it's
[58:18] stewardship it's the responsibility but
[58:21] most people like to shy away from
[58:23] responsibility they
[58:25] want to be held accountable none of us
[58:26] you know in our flesh enjoy that so
[58:29] we've got to have God help us to accept
[58:31] our responsibility and we've got to seek
[58:34] God until we find God and have a
[58:37] commission from God where we won't run
[58:39] from our stewardship anymore but we'll
[58:41] be faithful to it
[58:43] amen now look at verse 23 I'm sorry
[58:52] verse 22 1922 and he said that him out
[58:55] of an old mouth will I judge thee thou
[58:57] wicked servant see the scene things he
[58:59] said were evil it was wrong he's wicked
[59:03] thou knewest that I was an austere man
[59:06] taking up that I did not let I lay not
[59:09] down and reaping that I did not sow see
[59:11] it's a wicked thing to say that that God
[59:13] God would do something unjust God has
[59:17] got his fare got his pure the Bible said
[59:20] remember in Romans 1 the Bible said God
[59:22] reveals himself to two ways to every man
[59:24] through the creation and also through
[59:27] his own body because you have a
[59:29] conscience of right and wrong and that
[59:32] so no man is without excuse on the day
[59:35] of judgment praise God and so see he's a
[59:38] wicked man because he's knew he
[59:40] knew in his conscious in his heart that
[59:42] God was a good God that God was faithful
[59:44] but he let these evil spirits because of
[59:46] his love for the world memory buried
[59:48] God's tale in the world and the other
[59:49] parable in other words he just didn't
[59:51] use God's talent he didn't want to serve
[59:53] God he wanted to serve himself verse 23
[59:59] wherefore then gave us not now my money
[1:00:01] into the bank that at my coming I might
[1:00:04] have required mine own with usury so see
[1:00:06] he didn't even do the very least thing
[1:00:09] he could have did all he had knew
[1:00:10] brother William was to take that check
[1:00:12] for $15,000 you had to do was go deposit
[1:00:15] it in the bank that's all you had to do
[1:00:17] it's like you you and I all's he had to
[1:00:19] do was go to the ATM machine Church and
[1:00:22] deposit the check he didn't have to see
[1:00:24] anybody face to face I'm just
[1:00:26] dramatizing her applying to our day you
[1:00:28] understand he just had to go to the bank
[1:00:30] type in his ATM code slip the cheque in
[1:00:33] there and let it correct collect
[1:00:35] interest and Jesus would have been happy
[1:00:37] with that Dave had
[1:00:38] oh my he would just do something you
[1:00:42] only got to do is the very smallest the
[1:00:44] very little effort get on our knees and
[1:00:47] pray a little more praise God come to
[1:00:49] church be faithful pay our ties sing to
[1:00:52] God worship God testify to our neighbor
[1:00:54] we just got to do a little thing for the
[1:00:56] glory of God and God will see our
[1:00:58] efforts and he'll bless us but this man
[1:01:01] wasn't near that with a man he wouldn't
[1:01:03] even do one little thing he could have
[1:01:05] done that so easily but he refrained
[1:01:08] from doing the one simple thing just
[1:01:11] giving it over to somebody else
[1:01:13] trustworthy a banker he wouldn't even do
[1:01:16] that
[1:01:17] so Jesus said see your words and your
[1:01:19] actions expose you you didn't even do
[1:01:22] the very littlest thing you got your
[1:01:24] your your condemning me but I'm
[1:01:26] righteous he says amen
[1:01:30] verse 24 and he said unto them that
[1:01:33] stood by take from him the pound and
[1:01:35] give it to him that hath 10 pounds and
[1:01:38] they said unto Him Lord he hath 10
[1:01:41] pounds for I say unto you that unto
[1:01:45] everyone which hath shall not be given
[1:01:48] I'm sorry shall be given and from him
[1:01:51] that hath not even that he hath shall be
[1:01:55] taken away from him but those mine
[1:01:57] enemies which would not that I should
[1:02:00] reign over them bring hither and slay
[1:02:01] them before me now that's a picture of
[1:02:05] the of the white throne judgment and
[1:02:07] right after the judgment the Bible says
[1:02:09] they will be cast in lake of fire in the
[1:02:12] presence of the Lamb and the holy angels
[1:02:15] amen so Jesus says all those who hated
[1:02:19] me that wouldn't let the word reign over
[1:02:21] them
[1:02:22] come and slay them right in front of me
[1:02:24] because then every chance I gave them
[1:02:27] all the same amount praise God
[1:02:29] but yet they wouldn't invest in the ways
[1:02:32] of God they wouldn't let the word rule
[1:02:35] over their lives amen
[1:02:38] now let me let me go to this
[1:02:45] quick by God's grace how many recognize
[1:02:47] that picture we saw last year brothers
[1:02:52] this is a painting in a poem in brother
[1:02:57] branham's office and I will think I'll
[1:03:04] read this to you here let me find the
[1:03:08] quote that goes along with it
[1:03:09] it's from the sermon on Easter Sunday
[1:03:12] 1962 restoration of the bride tree let
[1:03:21] me just get to it here
[1:03:22] like I said didn't have enough time to
[1:03:25] put all the quotes I haven't had time
[1:03:27] for a couple weeks to put them all in
[1:03:28] there cuz I'm back to work
[1:03:34] bear with me here I guess I could
[1:03:38] probably read that there okay so I can
[1:03:42] play it too I think I have it on the
[1:03:44] audio this is a poem about brother
[1:03:46] Branham now brother Branham calls I
[1:03:49] think the man's name is Steffi Gerry
[1:03:50] Steffi if I'm not mistaken Gerry
[1:03:53] Stephie's the man that painted this
[1:03:54] picture of brother Branham misty velour
[1:03:57] bless you sir yeah oh you're fine sir
[1:03:59] good to see you or bless ya nice to see
[1:04:02] you so Gerry Steffi painted this picture
[1:04:05] a brother branham his mother wrote the
[1:04:08] poem about brother Branham and brother
[1:04:11] BAM he he's very humbled by this as
[1:04:14] you'll see it's a very humbling it's a
[1:04:18] really nice poem about brother Branham
[1:04:22] but brother Ram he's making a comment
[1:04:25] about the talent he has to paint this is
[1:04:28] a really nice painting obviously I'm
[1:04:31] almost there
[1:04:31] bear with me 1962 yeah superb Ram
[1:04:36] brother Nevel asked brother Bramson
[1:04:38] brother BAM may I have the time to
[1:04:39] interrupt you he said you sure can
[1:04:41] brother he says as a token of our
[1:04:43] appreciation by the work of a young man
[1:04:45] in our midst we present this picture to
[1:04:47] you brother branham with the full
[1:04:48] appreciation of our love I'm sorry full
[1:04:51] expression of our love and appreciation
[1:04:53] thank you brother Nevel and the
[1:04:55] tabernacle the young man is Jerry Steffi
[1:04:57] that paint of that picture
[1:04:59] he said brother Jerry Steffi paint that
[1:05:02] picture god bless that boy that's very
[1:05:04] fine Jerry if you're here this morning
[1:05:05] it's too bad I wish I had the means to
[1:05:08] let that boy go to school for an artist
[1:05:11] so my man said that boy painted this
[1:05:13] picture about man said I wish I had the
[1:05:16] money I'd send that boy to school to be
[1:05:19] an artist
[1:05:20] I thought brother branham was against
[1:05:23] school no only when the wisdom of school
[1:05:26] was exalted above the wisdom of God and
[1:05:28] the church said most of us do pretty
[1:05:31] good with that I don't think anybody's
[1:05:32] off on in our church on that there's
[1:05:34] nothing wrong with education you just
[1:05:36] can't let it pervert you away from the
[1:05:38] real truth of the word of God he says
[1:05:43] now I believe God is in art don't you
[1:05:48] believe it the congregation says Amen
[1:05:50] God is in music God is an art God is in
[1:05:53] this and it's too bad to see a town like
[1:05:55] that wouldn't be developed
[1:05:58] think about the towns now and the pounds
[1:06:01] I think I was actually kind of moving
[1:06:03] now back to the talents a little bit he
[1:06:06] said wouldn't be developed the more he
[1:06:08] does the more developing he'll be I pray
[1:06:11] that God will bless you Jerry and thank
[1:06:15] you brother Neville unto the church for
[1:06:16] this fine picture for the verse that
[1:06:18] goes under it I'll read it a little
[1:06:19] later but the devil says you want me to
[1:06:22] read it he says all right
[1:06:24] so it's titled honor to whom honor let
[1:06:29] me just play it here I think I can just
[1:06:30] play it sorry I did record it earlier
[1:06:45] patience how many does it mean remember
[1:06:54] reading us before listen to this raise
[1:06:57] your hand buddy remember reading it okay
[1:06:58] couple of you praise the Lord
[1:07:00] he's not a man that's what we're looking
[1:07:02] up okay so here it is now try to play it
[1:07:09] you know maybe I can pause it so you can
[1:07:11] if you don't understand it's quite a
[1:07:13] nice complement to brother branham now I
[1:07:16] remember brother bands recognizing the
[1:07:18] talent of the individual to draw it and
[1:07:21] then also the beautiful poems here about
[1:07:24] about him so here well hopefully
[1:07:27] everybody can hear it might be better
[1:07:46] for me to read that soprano lock it says
[1:07:48] he's not a man of stature tall nor lofty
[1:07:51] in his way he sounds himself no trumpet
[1:07:53] as he goes from day to day has no desire
[1:07:56] for wealth nor fame but none could fill
[1:07:58] I'm sorry but none his place could fill
[1:08:00] he's just the way we want him our own
[1:08:02] dear brother bill so it's a poem of
[1:08:04] appreciation about brother branham he
[1:08:07] teaches us with faithfulness the
[1:08:08] undiluted word no fancy ways no love for
[1:08:11] praise just following the Lord his
[1:08:14] speech is gentle I'm sorry his speech is
[1:08:16] soft and gentle he raises not his voice
[1:08:18] except to cry against the wrong and then
[1:08:21] he has no choice
[1:08:22] never got a lot of learning from
[1:08:25] colleges in school but he knows what is
[1:08:27] important he's sure nobody's fool for
[1:08:31] the knowledge he is given is eternal
[1:08:33] from above he has no Creed except our
[1:08:35] Christ no law but sovereign love there
[1:08:38] was no greater announcement to this
[1:08:40] lowly humble birth but to us he is the
[1:08:43] greatest man who lives upon the earth
[1:08:45] that's a nice compliment we counted more
[1:08:48] than privileged to know him as a friend
[1:08:50] we cherish all he stands for and we'll
[1:08:53] right to the end he says he's not a
[1:08:55] preacher he's modest as can be but get
[1:08:58] him in the pulpit and
[1:08:59] hard to see he was a four ordained a
[1:09:02] prophet let men call it what they will
[1:09:06] God granted us great favor when he gave
[1:09:08] us brother bill that's the end of that
[1:09:10] praise God so we saw that when we were
[1:09:12] there last year in Jeffersonville it's
[1:09:14] still hanging in the study there in the
[1:09:16] Bram Tabernacle but I just want to show
[1:09:18] you that as a as a little testimony of
[1:09:21] what brother Adam thought about art and
[1:09:24] so you know I know my wife's are artists
[1:09:27] and she painted that beautiful picture
[1:09:28] of brother Bram and the pillar of fire
[1:09:29] in my office there maybe I should hang
[1:09:31] it out here again I used to I don't know
[1:09:33] if I ever did hang it out in the
[1:09:34] sanctuary but Church you know art speaks
[1:09:37] of God art that is real good art will
[1:09:41] appoint someone to Jesus Christ and you
[1:09:45] know I was I couldn't think of an
[1:09:46] example where art led someone to Christ
[1:09:48] but I can't think of an example where a
[1:09:50] track led somebody to Christ member
[1:09:52] program told the story the man whose
[1:09:54] wife got saved and he was a car salesman
[1:09:56] and he didn't believe in that but
[1:09:58] someone handed him a little tract and he
[1:10:00] looked at it and said where will you
[1:10:01] spend eternity so the words placed on
[1:10:05] that little track brother BAM said led
[1:10:07] him to Billy Graham Oral Roberts and
[1:10:09] then came back to brother Branham and
[1:10:11] then through brothers ministry God
[1:10:13] showed him that he was a child of God
[1:10:15] and he had no more doubts about where he
[1:10:18] stood with God so we can see you know
[1:10:20] even just the design of a tract so if
[1:10:23] God can use a tract that just has words
[1:10:25] on it we know God can use a picture as
[1:10:27] well remember the testimony of the woman
[1:10:30] in the hospital I think it's from 1946
[1:10:32] or 51
[1:10:33] I can't marry which one of the pillar of
[1:10:35] fire picture we know the pillar of fire
[1:10:37] picture in here but brother Hammond the
[1:10:38] pillar of fire picture the woman in the
[1:10:40] hospital had that picture on her standby
[1:10:43] in the hospital room and she kept
[1:10:45] praying and looking at the picture and
[1:10:46] saying God I know you're real and she
[1:10:48] heard testimony she told brother Graham
[1:10:50] was that the pillar of fire came alive
[1:10:52] it started glowing and it came out of
[1:10:54] the picture and hung over her and she
[1:10:56] walked on the hospital healed in the
[1:10:58] name of Jesus so see it was her attitude
[1:11:01] towards the picture but a man said see
[1:11:03] she wasn't looking at me she was looking
[1:11:05] at the pillar of fire so she bowed and
[1:11:08] said any other way you make it an idol
[1:11:11] so even this picture we don't make an
[1:11:13] idol but we recognize like gods and a
[1:11:16] prophet kind of like the so looking at
[1:11:18] this picture is just like you would look
[1:11:20] at the pictures of Moses or the ten
[1:11:22] commandments when you go to the
[1:11:23] courtroom I look at those and I say
[1:11:26] praise the Lord
[1:11:26] you know did you know in the I think
[1:11:28] it's the house representatives did you
[1:11:30] know outside or I'm sorry the back of
[1:11:31] that house representives is a statue of
[1:11:33] Moses and the Ten Commandments oh you
[1:11:35] know that and so all those people that
[1:11:37] come there when they have this the
[1:11:38] president gives the State of the Union
[1:11:39] address a picture of Moses and the ten
[1:11:42] commandments is at the very back of that
[1:11:44] room now so there's some people in there
[1:11:47] that are faithful to that picture but
[1:11:49] there's a lot that aren't faith for that
[1:11:50] picture but see God uses it there as a
[1:11:53] witness God leaves it there because they
[1:11:56] out the answer they'll never be able to
[1:11:57] say well I didn't know Moses was
[1:11:59] connected I didn't know about the law of
[1:12:00] Moses the Bible said not only is there
[1:12:04] witnesses in their body and creation but
[1:12:06] then there's witnesses through art as
[1:12:07] well amen
[1:12:08] all this art will witness against them
[1:12:11] that God was trying to get them to do
[1:12:13] the right a men how many one do the
[1:12:16] right today
[1:12:16] praise God so I want to look at this
[1:12:20] here now go back to Matthew 25 let's go
[1:12:24] there and let's look now draw a little
[1:12:26] comparison here to the talents actually
[1:12:32] if you would Acts 24 because then we can
[1:12:34] see the context
[1:12:35] you saw how the the pounds was spoken to
[1:12:37] multitude that we're expecting Jesus to
[1:12:40] kind of take over the actual physical
[1:12:42] government but in Matthew 24
[1:12:45] I believe it's verse 1 and if you know
[1:12:57] you know the scripture Matthew 24 is
[1:12:59] Jesus he gives one of the greatest
[1:13:01] prophecies of the end time and if you
[1:13:03] know there's the message the six seals
[1:13:05] are Matthew 24 praise God
[1:13:08] but this is a conversation Saints just
[1:13:11] between Jesus and His apostles this
[1:13:16] isn't what Jesus and in the whole
[1:13:17] multitude this is just with Jesus in his
[1:13:19] apostles verse 1 and Jesus went out and
[1:13:22] departed from the temple and his
[1:13:24] disciple
[1:13:25] came to him for to show him the
[1:13:26] buildings of the temple and Jesus said
[1:13:29] mm see ye not all these things verily I
[1:13:31] say to you there shall not be left here
[1:13:33] one stone upon another that shall not be
[1:13:34] thrown down and his disciples I'm sorry
[1:13:36] and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives
[1:13:38] the disciples came unto him privately so
[1:13:40] see this is a private discussion saying
[1:13:43] tell us when shall these things be and
[1:13:45] what should be the sign of thy coming
[1:13:47] and of the end of the world now if you
[1:13:49] look just in your Bible the rest of the
[1:13:51] chapter is read letters and the rest of
[1:13:54] the next chapter is read letters and
[1:13:58] then in chapter 26 it finally switches
[1:14:01] over he starts you know moving towards
[1:14:04] the Passover and the Last Supper so all
[1:14:09] of this is spoken just to Jesus's
[1:14:11] disciples in private so in private when
[1:14:14] Jesus is just with his faithful little
[1:14:16] church his faith a little ministerial
[1:14:18] group when Jesus having a ministers
[1:14:20] meeting he tells them the parable of the
[1:14:22] talents but when he's out with the
[1:14:24] congregation when he's out with all the
[1:14:26] people or the multitude he tells them
[1:14:28] that parable the pounds they're similar
[1:14:31] but not exactly because they have
[1:14:35] different purposes that Jesus wants them
[1:14:37] to understand glory now 25 let's go to
[1:14:45] this again now notice verse 14 for the
[1:14:49] kingdom of heaven is a man travelling
[1:14:50] into far country who called his own
[1:14:51] servants and delivered unto them as
[1:14:53] Goods now see that's similar to the
[1:14:55] pounds but there's nothing said about
[1:14:57] being hated by the citizens and then
[1:15:00] verse 15 shows they're given different
[1:15:03] amounts and unto one he gave five
[1:15:07] talents to another two and to another
[1:15:09] one to every man according to several
[1:15:11] bility and straightway took his journey
[1:15:13] now look that up and I saw how five
[1:15:16] talents is about five million dollars is
[1:15:17] 4.7 million dollars two talents is about
[1:15:22] two million and then one tale is about
[1:15:26] 750,000 or 1 million we'll just rounded
[1:15:29] up to 1 million ok so it makes sense so
[1:15:32] when Jesus is with his preachers he's
[1:15:34] telling them some of you have about 5
[1:15:37] million dollars of
[1:15:38] some of you are so gifted your gifts go
[1:15:41] beyond now who is that probably John and
[1:15:43] Peter because Peter had the keys to the
[1:15:45] kingdom
[1:15:46] praise God and John his ministry lasted
[1:15:50] we saw that 66 years his ministry after
[1:15:52] Christ left he had almost 70 years of
[1:15:55] ministry of Holy Ghost ministry my and
[1:15:59] then he wrote those he wrote the gospel
[1:16:02] and then three epistles and then the
[1:16:04] book of Revelation he wrote five books 5
[1:16:06] Bible books filled with prophecy and
[1:16:09] mother have said the book of Revelation
[1:16:11] was the only book Jesus really wrote all
[1:16:13] by himself amen he wrote it himself
[1:16:15] telling John write this down this is the
[1:16:18] apocalypse this is the signs of the end
[1:16:21] time this is thus saith the Lord he said
[1:16:23] tell the Saints surely I come quickly
[1:16:25] amen he comes quickly to their
[1:16:28] generation amen he came to Ephesus and
[1:16:32] Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Philadelphia a
[1:16:35] Sardis late Asiya he comes quickly to
[1:16:38] everyone and if they don't repent he
[1:16:40] takes away the candlestick that's right
[1:16:45] so here amongst the preachers he's gotta
[1:16:49] let them know he said brother Peter I
[1:16:50] may have given John a little more
[1:16:53] ministry than you because Peter got
[1:16:55] jealous a little later didn't he
[1:16:57] remember after the resurrection he said
[1:16:59] but Jesus what about John Jesus said
[1:17:02] somewhat some are standing here that
[1:17:04] will not taste death do they see the
[1:17:05] kingdom and Peter got a little jealous
[1:17:06] what about John what what's he gonna do
[1:17:09] and Jesus said stop looking at other
[1:17:11] people's talents stop comparing yourself
[1:17:14] to other people follow the word amen
[1:17:18] you follow the ministry I've given to
[1:17:20] you you follow the word it's your eyes
[1:17:23] of other churches amen
[1:17:25] it's your eyes of other preachers other
[1:17:27] ministers hid your eyes off it you
[1:17:30] follow the word that's been revealed to
[1:17:32] you praise God
[1:17:33] does that help you'll see in this
[1:17:37] talents its spoken to preachers now I
[1:17:40] believe this too the money represents
[1:17:43] responsibility preachers get more money
[1:17:48] all that means is responsibility
[1:17:52] praise God because preachers the Bible
[1:17:58] said will be judged more harshly than
[1:18:00] everybody else because they influenced
[1:18:03] the people remember James said be not
[1:18:07] many masters remember James said that
[1:18:08] because they will see that we receive
[1:18:10] the greater condemnation
[1:18:11] help me understand now and programs he
[1:18:16] told those brothers and if you listen to
[1:18:18] 1962 not taking sides of Jesus mmm it's
[1:18:26] not coming to me but man tells the
[1:18:29] preachers he said you've just got one
[1:18:31] you'd have to answer to God for one
[1:18:33] church he said but I've got millions of
[1:18:35] souls I've gotta answer for he said you
[1:18:38] think it's easy since it's harder for me
[1:18:40] to know the will of God because I'm
[1:18:41] getting more knocks he says from the
[1:18:43] devil I'm getting more knocks I'm
[1:18:46] getting more tests I'm getting more
[1:18:47] pressure
[1:18:48] Sika Satan can look at his life and say
[1:18:51] ma he's got five talents
[1:18:52] he's got the wisdom to the discernment
[1:18:55] he's got prophecy he's a prophet he has
[1:18:58] all these he has all this talent so
[1:19:00] Satan's knocking him harder better I've
[1:19:02] said it was harder for him than you and
[1:19:05] I to serve the Lord and stay faithful
[1:19:07] but also church that ought encourage us
[1:19:10] that if brother Branham could do it with
[1:19:11] harder knocks we can do it no matter
[1:19:14] what knocks we go through no matter what
[1:19:16] waves come our way if we stay true to
[1:19:19] Christ we can crest every wave amen we
[1:19:22] can win every battle praise God we can
[1:19:24] get the victory but we got to be
[1:19:26] faithful and we know we got to overcome
[1:19:28] the temptations of Satan hallelujah so
[1:19:34] see this this is perfect by scriptural
[1:19:37] preachers are given more because they
[1:19:39] have more influence and then he said
[1:19:46] everybody else he says to the multitude
[1:19:49] he's not in the multitude no everybody
[1:19:51] has something to do now I don't have
[1:19:55] time I'm not going to go there today but
[1:19:56] there's another thought I want to take
[1:19:57] maybe tonight I'll take it there's
[1:20:00] another thought how preachers have
[1:20:01] different talents but then there's
[1:20:04] there's the idea that ever
[1:20:05] anybody including preachers as has been
[1:20:08] giving something equal in other words we
[1:20:11] all have equal opportunities whether may
[1:20:13] our female preacher or not preacher
[1:20:15] praise God we all have equal
[1:20:18] opportunities and the Holy Spirit help
[1:20:21] me through the scripture just to make a
[1:20:22] big long list of operative of acts of
[1:20:26] love or works all of us can do because
[1:20:29] they're all equal to us so I want to
[1:20:33] maybe maybe Lord willing we'll look at
[1:20:34] that tonight because this is so
[1:20:37] beautiful it's so clear scripturally
[1:20:39] that preachers have more responsibility
[1:20:41] but then everybody in one way everybody
[1:20:44] another way every servant of God whether
[1:20:46] you're male female child or adult old or
[1:20:49] young or middle-aged every servant of
[1:20:51] God has the equal chance to serve the
[1:20:53] Lord has an equal chance to invest in
[1:20:56] the things of God praise God let me go
[1:21:00] to this thought here and then we'll
[1:21:01] close I want to just close to this
[1:21:03] now the reason I'm preaching this is
[1:21:05] because I went through all the quotes of
[1:21:07] brother Branham about talents and at the
[1:21:09] end of his ministry he brings up Elvis
[1:21:12] and the singers a lot so let me go
[1:21:18] through some of these this is the three
[1:21:22] kinds of believers 1963 he said but they
[1:21:25] sell out like Judas that's the make
[1:21:28] believer some of them are highly
[1:21:29] talented people and this make believer
[1:21:31] watch that guy that's the shrewd guy the
[1:21:34] little guy that fills up quick and jumps
[1:21:36] up and runs out at every little phrase
[1:21:37] that he don't like you don't pay no
[1:21:39] attention to him he's just an unbeliever
[1:21:41] to begin with but when you see this guy
[1:21:43] make believer hangs on seat that's the
[1:21:45] Judas that's him like great talents I'm
[1:21:51] going to call names here which I really
[1:21:53] shouldn't do it but I'm gonna call them
[1:21:55] anyhow that you'll know I'm glad he
[1:21:56] called him I'm glad he called him cuz
[1:21:59] you know what they're all gonna be
[1:22:00] called out anyway on the day of judgment
[1:22:02] they're all gonna be Jesus called out
[1:22:04] Herod you little fox he said he's a
[1:22:08] little fox you tell that Fox those
[1:22:11] people went back and said well Jesus
[1:22:12] called you a fox geez didn't care it was
[1:22:15] the truth speak the truth we don't
[1:22:17] gossip but we speak the truth
[1:22:20] now I'm not gonna go call people foxes
[1:22:22] I'm just letting you know
[1:22:23] but Jesus could do it because he knew
[1:22:26] what was he knew what was in the man's
[1:22:28] heart amen
[1:22:32] like Elvis Presley red Foley Ernie Ford
[1:22:36] and Pat Boone or I didn't get the Pat
[1:22:38] Boone I got three of them time anyway he
[1:22:49] said Pat Boone a Church of Christ man
[1:22:52] I'm sorry
[1:22:53] Elvis Presley a Pentecostal I think what
[1:23:00] he could have done for the kingdom of
[1:23:01] God had he stay in the Pentecostal
[1:23:02] church singing the songs of God I have
[1:23:05] friends that don't that don't believe
[1:23:07] the message from my hometown that I've
[1:23:10] talked to them and they still play Elvis
[1:23:12] now they're older they still play Elvis
[1:23:14] Presley albums gospel albums because
[1:23:16] it's so beautiful and I'll admit a few
[1:23:19] times I've heard them and it sounds
[1:23:20] really nice but it doesn't have the
[1:23:22] sincerity praise God it might be right
[1:23:25] by the notes it might be right in a nice
[1:23:27] tune or the harmony I don't know all the
[1:23:29] might be the right measure it might be
[1:23:32] all that but it don't have that ring of
[1:23:34] the godly sincerity it doesn't have the
[1:23:36] truth or the true song of the obedient
[1:23:39] Amen because he could sing it but he
[1:23:43] couldn't live in Amen that right that's
[1:23:47] why I appreciate our brother amen first
[1:23:49] lead-in songs cuz he lives the life
[1:23:51] praise God or any song leader that we
[1:23:55] know in the message that really lives
[1:23:56] the life Pat Boone I'm sorry Elvis
[1:24:00] Presley punic also Pat Boone a Church of
[1:24:02] Christ red Foley a deacon in the church
[1:24:04] of christ now I do have red Foley so
[1:24:05] let's remember this guy was a deacon in
[1:24:08] the Church of Christ
[1:24:11] well let's get the elbows first and all
[1:24:15] these people with those talents smart
[1:24:17] out on television to see if we were
[1:24:21] smarter we'd be on television so that
[1:24:25] means we're not very smart which is okay
[1:24:28] I don't want to be smart I just want the
[1:24:29] mind of Christ oh yeah
[1:24:33] you know that's why brother BAM said he
[1:24:35] said that's why God didn't give me a big
[1:24:36] amount of money cuz if maybe I couldn't
[1:24:38] have handled it but see God had given
[1:24:40] him other gifts that were more important
[1:24:42] like discernment hey hallelujah praise
[1:24:46] God he wasn't given IBM machines he was
[1:24:50] given the mind of Christ eyelid area he
[1:24:58] said those people say well aren't they
[1:25:00] religious they sing songs that don't
[1:25:02] mean one thing yes sir deceiving the
[1:25:04] world what do they get out of it judas
[1:25:07] got thirty pieces of silver elvis a
[1:25:09] fleet of Cadillacs and a hundred or two
[1:25:11] hundred and fifty million dollars or a
[1:25:13] million dollars on records and things
[1:25:14] like that
[1:25:14] pat boone and the rest of them I don't
[1:25:16] care what church they belong to and
[1:25:17] everything it's hypocrisy it's a make
[1:25:20] believe it's a front and their life
[1:25:22] proves it out that it isn't right amen
[1:25:26] their life proves your life proves if
[1:25:30] you invest in the things of God or not
[1:25:34] like I told you this before it's true
[1:25:36] even the Bible said it any sin is a seed
[1:25:40] and it has to produce death so any
[1:25:43] church with a false doctrine eventually
[1:25:46] that sin is going to show up somewhere
[1:25:48] now with the rich young ruler how did
[1:25:51] show up it wasn't adultery it wasn't
[1:25:53] murder it was money but Rev said he got
[1:25:57] in that's why listen to yesterday the
[1:25:59] investments program said he didn't get
[1:26:02] poor
[1:26:03] he got richer and he tore down his homes
[1:26:07] and build up bigger barns so he was a
[1:26:11] slave to greed well Graham said yet he
[1:26:16] would only give now can you imagine
[1:26:18] having big barns of money now for them
[1:26:21] it was food Church can you imagine
[1:26:23] having big barns of food and you only
[1:26:25] give Lazarus a few crumbs
[1:26:27] what kind of wicked evil heart would
[1:26:30] that be he had barns with grains and
[1:26:35] then he cooked the bread and they'd have
[1:26:37] a big old feast of bread and butter and
[1:26:39] everything kill the fatted lamb or
[1:26:42] fatted calf sorry kill the lamb too and
[1:26:45] then they
[1:26:47] the little crumbs that fell from the
[1:26:48] table here you go laughter I'm doing my
[1:26:50] duty
[1:26:50] yeah he said I never broke one command I
[1:26:52] never didn't commit adultery I never
[1:26:53] lied never steal but you loved riches
[1:26:58] but you may deny you're your idol was
[1:27:01] your own Barnes you're I to let you bow
[1:27:05] down to us oh god bless me so I can get
[1:27:07] bigger Barnes my their life proves out
[1:27:15] that isn't right then there are those
[1:27:16] with the talents that is great
[1:27:18] organizers worldly wisdom he says they
[1:27:22] preach the gospel claim to smart man
[1:27:25] intellectuals listen a man that's
[1:27:27] trained in that field he's not a
[1:27:28] preacher he's a lecturer I wonder how
[1:27:30] many lecturers got megachurches out
[1:27:33] there they're not really preaching the
[1:27:35] Word of God does any man that will
[1:27:38] preach the Word of God he'll be rejected
[1:27:40] he'll be cast away right amen
[1:27:46] that's what the trouble is today we have
[1:27:48] lecturers jesus said go and train and do
[1:27:50] this he said no go and preach the gospel
[1:27:52] these signs shall follow the preaching
[1:27:54] amen that's not to learn to make a
[1:27:57] lecture who can just stand in mind just
[1:27:59] put flowery things in it make you feel
[1:28:00] like you're sitting right in the
[1:28:01] presence of an archangel that isn't it
[1:28:03] having forms of godliness you see that's
[1:28:05] a lecture not the Holy Spirit action
[1:28:06] some little fellow that wouldn't know
[1:28:08] his ABCs might come now with the power
[1:28:10] of faith with the word and make the Holy
[1:28:12] Spirit do things that that man knows
[1:28:13] nothing about and deny it
[1:28:15] there you are see they'll deny brother
[1:28:18] branham they'll deny his ministry
[1:28:20] they'll deny the endtime they'll deny
[1:28:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way we
[1:28:23] preach it they'll deny the water baptism
[1:28:25] but man said that's a good sign they're
[1:28:27] lecturers smart educated organized men
[1:28:31] some very smart shrewd but they won't
[1:28:34] obey the Word of God he said great
[1:28:37] people yes sir they are organizers
[1:28:39] they're prosperous successful smart and
[1:28:42] worldly wisdom just exactly like Satan
[1:28:44] did to Eve that little helpless woman he
[1:28:47] came right and tried to to sell her on
[1:28:49] the idea that she would be wiser than
[1:28:50] she was and that's what she was looking
[1:28:52] for let me read another one countdown
[1:28:57] 1964 you see when you see in person
[1:29:01] nation's friend it kind of makes you a
[1:29:03] little upset doesn't it
[1:29:04] people impersonating brother branham's
[1:29:06] gift people impersonating a real
[1:29:09] preacher a real sister in Christ but
[1:29:12] just go on anyhow it'll be alright he
[1:29:14] said now look you've got to be born for
[1:29:17] that you are born and all natural gifts
[1:29:19] come to you gifts and callings are
[1:29:21] without repentance he said like Ernie
[1:29:24] Ford red Foley Elvis Presley those
[1:29:26] fellows with them big talents of singing
[1:29:29] and using it for the world God gave them
[1:29:32] their talents and see what they're doing
[1:29:33] with it who gave them the ability to
[1:29:37] sing and dance now dance of course his
[1:29:39] dance wasn't godly but he could have
[1:29:41] danced for Jesus right in a better way
[1:29:45] I better have said you know it's like
[1:29:47] Judas Iscariot
[1:29:51] here an influence in 1963 says it again
[1:29:55] he said they are taking the town that
[1:29:57] God gave them and influencing with their
[1:30:00] lives speaking louder than what their
[1:30:03] words are so as loud as their lyrics are
[1:30:07] to their words their life speaks louder
[1:30:09] than their words how can people make
[1:30:16] such plays or movies as this man does
[1:30:18] and then stand and sing hymns and things
[1:30:20] like that it's the very height of
[1:30:22] hypocrisy so if you want to see what
[1:30:25] hypocrisy look at gifted singers or
[1:30:27] preachers and how they that they they
[1:30:30] put their gifts of God in the ground and
[1:30:32] they compromise to make money it's the
[1:30:35] very height of hypocrisy that's exactly
[1:30:40] right
[1:30:43] and he
[1:30:45] here's what they say I think God loves
[1:30:47] me so much till he'll let me get by with
[1:30:50] anything see Oh God loves me I can do
[1:30:55] this God loves me he's merciful
[1:30:57] well Ram said I said he'll never do that
[1:30:59] he would never do it even Israel his
[1:31:02] nation even David that's a good example
[1:31:04] a man after his own heart reaped every
[1:31:07] grain that he sowed praise God because
[1:31:12] he planted some wrong seeds it knee and
[1:31:15] he reaped every one he planted program
[1:31:19] says and you'll do it to each one of us
[1:31:21] we'll do it but he got lifted up in his
[1:31:23] heart
[1:31:27] the RAM said and again leadership 1965
[1:31:34] he says Elvis Presley Pat Boone Ernie
[1:31:37] Ford and great singers they take their
[1:31:39] talents their god-given talents and use
[1:31:42] it to inspire the works of the devil how
[1:31:47] many love songs that Elvis sing that
[1:31:49] inspired adultery or fornication and
[1:31:52] that led to will say an abortion see
[1:31:57] we've got to see what do our works what
[1:31:59] gifts do we have and then what are they
[1:32:02] producing in other people's lives
[1:32:03] in other words waters what is our life
[1:32:06] influencing others to do amen glory he
[1:32:12] said this is the height of hypocrisy God
[1:32:15] gives you a tremendous gift to do
[1:32:17] something but you invest it in the
[1:32:19] things of the world rather than things
[1:32:20] of God that's right some great singers
[1:32:24] sound their god-given talents for fame
[1:32:26] in this world to become somebody he said
[1:32:29] how could you become any more of a body
[1:32:30] than you could to be as somebody than to
[1:32:33] be a son of God amen
[1:32:38] praise God
[1:32:40] I was looking for that one quote oh yeah
[1:32:42] here just now Elvis Presley as you can
[1:32:45] see on the screen
[1:32:46] he died at 42 42 he sold uh now this is
[1:32:52] just in his lifetime 146 million albums
[1:32:54] he sold millions since then
[1:32:58] he died with five million dollars in the
[1:33:00] bank which with inflation is 20 million
[1:33:02] today 20 min he spent he wasted so much
[1:33:06] money they said booze and women and
[1:33:08] traveling and clothes and all this kind
[1:33:10] of things how'd he die he dried died as
[1:33:13] a drug addict you've heard me say before
[1:33:15] he went you went you told his bodyguards
[1:33:18] I'm just going to use the restroom and
[1:33:19] he took a book of witchcraft he's gonna
[1:33:21] go read about witchcraft and harvesting
[1:33:23] the mental energy and they went back
[1:33:26] they found him dead on the toilet and he
[1:33:29] was rampant in adultery everybody knows
[1:33:31] that it's all proven they got a video
[1:33:34] where they caught Elvis his bodyguards
[1:33:37] have a video of him where he came in
[1:33:39] after lunch into the car they got a
[1:33:41] video of him and he was bragging about
[1:33:42] how he just had adultery and he called
[1:33:45] it a hot lunch and then he said Elvis
[1:33:47] you're on tape they're giggling laughing
[1:33:49] and it Church it's a you I'll show you
[1:33:51] the video if you want he turns and looks
[1:33:53] out the window all sad these things what
[1:33:55] a friend we have in Jesus because he
[1:33:57] knows he's on video look at that a man
[1:34:00] they got a given let's say a five talent
[1:34:03] gift to sing and maybe be a preacher
[1:34:06] maybe be a leader but he sold it out for
[1:34:09] the things of the world the very height
[1:34:12] of hypocrisy and I put a picture up of
[1:34:15] him up there not a pretty one because
[1:34:17] that's what it all produces right there
[1:34:20] that's what it produces and there's much
[1:34:25] more that could be said about him but he
[1:34:26] started a Pentecostal church brother
[1:34:28] branham knew Elvis's pastor and his
[1:34:31] mother very well I was reading the other
[1:34:35] day that there were psychiatrists United
[1:34:37] States going to each other and we're the
[1:34:38] great singers like and entertainers like
[1:34:40] Arthur Godfrey lot of these other people
[1:34:42] with wisecracks and so forth some of
[1:34:44] them have as many as three psychiatrists
[1:34:46] and New York newspaper reporter took two
[1:34:48] years to search it down that
[1:34:50] rock-and-roll boogie woogie Elvis a
[1:34:51] modern Judas is scared that boy was a
[1:34:53] Christian in a Pentecostal Church with
[1:34:56] the baptismal Agosto he's talking about
[1:34:57] tongues now or maybe the church actually
[1:35:00] taught the real baptism Holy Ghost I'm
[1:35:02] not sure which one it is
[1:35:03] I know his pastor his mother and them
[1:35:05] well Judas is scary got thirty pieces of
[1:35:09] silver out of Christ he got a feat of
[1:35:11] cattle
[1:35:11] and twenty million dollars but he sold
[1:35:17] his birthright read folia deacon in the
[1:35:20] church sold his birthright and taken his
[1:35:22] talents and give it up to the world they
[1:35:24] have to have psychiatrist to keep them
[1:35:26] up
[1:35:27] Presley's had three or four heart
[1:35:29] attacks and yet in his teens yet it's
[1:35:34] the strain see the burden of sin if if a
[1:35:38] person doesn't clean out their lives
[1:35:40] what happens those demons start
[1:35:42] gathering more and more and they start
[1:35:44] tormenting the person more and more it's
[1:35:47] a strain red Foley he's the only one
[1:35:55] that had anything positive I was reading
[1:35:57] on Wikipedia know if it's true he died
[1:36:00] at 58 he sold over 25 million albums in
[1:36:05] fact he was one of the first artists as
[1:36:08] a Christian ever sell million copies of
[1:36:10] a song I think it was peace in the
[1:36:12] valley yeah was peace in the valley
[1:36:13] there'll be peace in the valley for me
[1:36:15] that's at least with the websites and I
[1:36:16] hope I'm right it could be your huh but
[1:36:19] after he did that he got so popular
[1:36:21] Church he started making country album
[1:36:24] and then he influenced he actually
[1:36:26] influenced Elvis Presley with his music
[1:36:28] so again remember Abraham said look at a
[1:36:30] person's influence look how people what
[1:36:34] do people take away from your life what
[1:36:37] do people take away from my life I hope
[1:36:38] it's the righteousness of Christ hope
[1:36:41] people look at your life and say mine I
[1:36:43] want to be more like God I want to pray
[1:36:45] more I want to read my BOB I'm gonna go
[1:36:47] to church more now we know we're getting
[1:36:49] fewer and fewer as the time goes on but
[1:36:51] still let's influence let's let's have
[1:36:53] people say that they knew a real
[1:36:54] Christian and it was you and I and he
[1:36:59] was so into the things of the world that
[1:37:01] his second wife even his first wife died
[1:37:03] after birth of one of their children but
[1:37:05] his second wife committed suicide cuz he
[1:37:07] was back and forth back and forth back
[1:37:09] and forth on the very night this is
[1:37:13] according to his friend here on the very
[1:37:15] night he died he had a concert and his
[1:37:19] friend is the Christian concert a friend
[1:37:22] led him to the Lord apparently he
[1:37:23] repented and wept he went
[1:37:25] and saying that song there's peace in
[1:37:28] the valley for me he came in and died
[1:37:30] but before he died he said that's the
[1:37:32] first time I've ever sung that song
[1:37:34] and actually felt that he said he's the
[1:37:37] only one that had any good about his
[1:37:39] life no one else this other guy didn't
[1:37:41] have anything good about him so church
[1:37:43] at least he has a hope but look he'll
[1:37:45] have no reward he had to get the sing he
[1:37:49] had a gift to unite people he had the
[1:37:51] gift to do all these things for the the
[1:37:54] kingdom of God but he went back and
[1:37:56] forth on both sides suicide struck his
[1:38:00] family and here he at the end of his
[1:38:05] life like a thief on the cross God gives
[1:38:07] him a second chance
[1:38:08] amen thank God for the mercy of God
[1:38:10] hallelujah talk about talents there's
[1:38:15] the last one I believe I have for that
[1:38:16] one yeah Ernie Ford Ernie was one that
[1:38:22] is one of the saddest stories of all
[1:38:23] them he died at 72 so millions of albums
[1:38:27] he was a local disc jockey and and then
[1:38:30] some rich guy was driving through the
[1:38:32] area I heard him on the radio and here's
[1:38:34] a guy that says his whole biography says
[1:38:37] I never asked for anything say and just
[1:38:40] kept opening the doors for him I'll say
[1:38:41] like that hey a guy like a rich guy
[1:38:44] liked his voice and so he opened up and
[1:38:46] he basically picked up Ernie Ford and
[1:38:48] put him in the spotlight he could have
[1:38:51] turned it down but he didn't and he
[1:38:54] would cross over he'd make gospel albums
[1:38:57] sell millions of albums and then go back
[1:38:59] over to the world dance albums all these
[1:39:01] things his entire life he was nothing
[1:39:03] but an alcoholic his family was
[1:39:06] completely dysfunctional until his wife
[1:39:09] finally committed suicide they were
[1:39:11] known he would they would they would go
[1:39:13] to events and they were known his wife
[1:39:15] would be sloshed and drunk and sarcastic
[1:39:18] and he would just be real common and
[1:39:19] trying to hold everything together they
[1:39:21] put on this hit hypocritical front like
[1:39:24] in all the magazine's they're all
[1:39:25] smiling golfing together smiling
[1:39:28] laughing like everything's okay and
[1:39:30] church don't you know church people do
[1:39:31] the same thing today they put on false
[1:39:34] fronts like like everything's okay but
[1:39:37] the reality of your life is in your
[1:39:39] whole
[1:39:39] we've said it before proverbs says the
[1:39:41] treasure of the believer is in their
[1:39:44] home amen your home life tells what you
[1:39:47] are praise God they can act if we can
[1:39:50] act like things are good but how we live
[1:39:52] in our home tells what we really got in
[1:39:54] our hearts praise God now I want to read
[1:40:01] something here to you by God's grace
[1:40:07] yeah I pulled up this quote here let me
[1:40:14] read this to you we're at a endtime it
[1:40:18] kind of gave me courage this morning he
[1:40:21] said Amen brother Fred brother Norman
[1:40:22] the brothers I was sitting this morning
[1:40:23] if that wasn't the very same thing I was
[1:40:25] talking this morning I set out for
[1:40:27] America's harvest when I started years
[1:40:28] ago on the harvest with the the gifts
[1:40:30] and so forth it's went over it's combed
[1:40:32] he said the nation the harvest has
[1:40:35] already reaped in now we're going back
[1:40:37] across the field over stubble just
[1:40:39] picking up a grain here and there
[1:40:41] whenever we can is that right brethren
[1:40:43] that's saying the same thing here the
[1:40:45] Holy Spirit turns right up back around
[1:40:47] and speaks the same thing so if you can
[1:40:50] picture I mean we're going to see it
[1:40:51] pretty soon we have all these farming
[1:40:54] fields by our house pretty soon they're
[1:40:56] gonna harvest those fields and we're
[1:40:59] gonna drive by I think nothing of it oh
[1:41:00] there's the harvest but brother Graham
[1:41:03] said in his day the the got the field of
[1:41:07] America had already been harvested down
[1:41:09] and everything was harvested he said
[1:41:13] they're just a little places where you
[1:41:14] can find the the grains and pick up a
[1:41:17] few grains here and there Oh God if they
[1:41:23] could rejoice when the harvest began
[1:41:25] what ought to we do now when the harvest
[1:41:28] is over hallelujah winnowing time is
[1:41:33] here now separating the chaff you
[1:41:35] remember what winnowing time is where
[1:41:36] you take that pitchfork you throw the
[1:41:38] seeds up in the air and the wind comes
[1:41:40] by and blows away all the chaff amen
[1:41:42] Church the wind of the Holy Spirit is
[1:41:44] blowing here this morning amen and let's
[1:41:47] have it blow out all the chaff all the
[1:41:49] unbelief praise God
[1:41:51] separate us from any of
[1:41:52] any evil thing that said or thought may
[1:41:55] just blow that away and they the seed
[1:41:57] life of the word of God the souls of the
[1:42:00] seeds of the saints of God that will
[1:42:02] remain and Jesus will take that into the
[1:42:05] threshing floor plays God he'll take it
[1:42:07] into his house and he'll use that for
[1:42:09] his glory amen
[1:42:10] I don't know you said it's winnowing
[1:42:12] time now separating the chaff this is
[1:42:14] the time then how can you hold your
[1:42:16] peace without peace without blasting it
[1:42:18] out this is winnowing time yes sir you
[1:42:20] beat the husks off the wheat that's
[1:42:21] exactly this is the time when it's
[1:42:23] coming if anybody here that hasn't got a
[1:42:26] Holy Ghost experience and once the only
[1:42:28] ghost here's the altar right now we'll
[1:42:30] come right here and pray for anybody
[1:42:31] that doesn't have the Holy Spirit
[1:42:32] anybody wants receive Jesus I invite you
[1:42:34] here to the altar I like this if you
[1:42:38] notice in the times pass I'm not too
[1:42:40] much to persuade people
[1:42:41] I know it's good sometimes people go
[1:42:43] back and talk to one another but I've
[1:42:45] seen people led too far away from God if
[1:42:48] the Holy Spirit won't raise them from
[1:42:50] their seat then they're hopeless anyhow
[1:42:53] in other words if someone won't even
[1:42:56] like stand up to say I want to be born
[1:42:58] again how are they going to be saved if
[1:43:01] someone can't bring their body and
[1:43:03] subjection enough just to raise their
[1:43:05] hand or or walk forward and come admit
[1:43:07] that I need the Holy Ghost and I'm not
[1:43:08] born again how can there be any hope for
[1:43:10] that
[1:43:11] let's see they've got to give every part
[1:43:12] of their being body so spirit it's all
[1:43:15] got to be surrendered to Jesus Christ
[1:43:17] your body must be surrendered so you can
[1:43:19] repent and get baptized and then seek
[1:43:22] the Holy Ghost praise God to be born
[1:43:24] again Jesus turned around and said to
[1:43:27] the syrophoenician woman it's not meat
[1:43:28] for me to take the children's bread and
[1:43:30] give it to dogs she said that's the
[1:43:32] truth Lord that's right but the dogs is
[1:43:35] ready to eat the scraps around the
[1:43:36] master's table he said for this saying
[1:43:38] now this is the church I want you to
[1:43:41] notice the thing is the ministry will
[1:43:42] continually get greater I want to I
[1:43:44] wouldn't encourage you with this our
[1:43:46] ministry is going to get greater in
[1:43:48] Revelation probably not number although
[1:43:52] we would appreciate that you not be
[1:43:53] wonderful if God does save more Souls
[1:43:57] but brother says the ministry will
[1:44:00] continually get greater and this is in
[1:44:02] 1960 and it did by the third Pole it got
[1:44:05] greater in Revelation
[1:44:06] you see the gifts the Lord has given me
[1:44:08] is to vindicate that I'm telling you the
[1:44:10] truth it's God a vindication that it's a
[1:44:12] truth that wasn't what was the truth he
[1:44:14] said I was born I'm sorry he said I was
[1:44:17] supposed to pray for people I was born
[1:44:19] for that purpose I said that years ago I
[1:44:21] just put all the ministry right on the
[1:44:23] gifts he and the American people
[1:44:25] especially wanted to be entertained they
[1:44:27] got they did the same thing with our
[1:44:29] Lord but just as soon as I begin to tell
[1:44:32] them what it was tell my truth my
[1:44:34] doctrines of Scripture which I'd ask any
[1:44:36] man to correct me
[1:44:38] that's right nobody's ever done it yet
[1:44:40] and I'm just as humble would be willing
[1:44:42] to accept it any time
[1:44:44] look how humble brother Branham was if
[1:44:46] I'm wrong somebody come correct me but
[1:44:48] nobody ever did that's the same thing
[1:44:49] I've offered on all those videos if I'm
[1:44:51] wrong learning this somebody come
[1:44:53] correct me no one's ever brought a real
[1:44:55] challenge to anything because it's the
[1:44:58] word here's what I'm just gonna stop
[1:45:01] right here but as soon as Jesus began to
[1:45:03] tell them the truth about the gospel
[1:45:05] what happened
[1:45:05] the cemani went away the others went
[1:45:08] away and Jesus popularity continually
[1:45:10] rose fell until finally they crucified
[1:45:15] him but his ministry grow deeper and
[1:45:18] deeper lasted made this bread as I
[1:45:21] talked the other night into the fish
[1:45:22] turn ride around and put sockets a man's
[1:45:24] eyes it doesn't have sockets put
[1:45:25] eyeballs in now there was a crowd foul
[1:45:28] just the fish isn't yeah this is what we
[1:45:29] see today there was a crowd just
[1:45:31] followed for the fishes and loaves see
[1:45:34] people follow the church just for the
[1:45:35] physical blessings they say we'll see
[1:45:38] what he does tomorrow but their hearts
[1:45:39] were far away and at the end time how
[1:45:43] many did he have to go up to receive the
[1:45:45] Pentecostal blessing out of the tens of
[1:45:48] thousands he ministered to 120 out of
[1:45:51] tens of thousands now that spirit in the
[1:45:54] world today performing the same ministry
[1:45:55] against the same opposition it would be
[1:45:57] the same thing but as ministry grows
[1:45:59] deeper and deeper all the time greater
[1:46:01] let's say into our feet I'm gonna pull
[1:46:04] one thing out of their entertainment the
[1:46:07] spirit we're gonna battle America is
[1:46:09] entertainment sit back and entertain me
[1:46:14] now entertain when you're entertained
[1:46:15] you don't do nothing you just sit there
[1:46:16] and enjoy it in other words
[1:46:19] no stewardship musicians can come no
[1:46:24] accountability and see that's what we
[1:46:27] have to make sure Church doesn't become
[1:46:28] Oh preacher just entertain me it can't
[1:46:32] be that it's got to be God I have a part
[1:46:35] in every service I play a part
[1:46:38] my amens my pole my prayer my agreement
[1:46:42] my worship my singing my prayers all of
[1:46:45] its important all of it has an impact on
[1:46:47] the services now the kingdom of God
[1:46:54] church the kingdom of God
[1:46:57] I'm gonna pull just those nine gifts of
[1:47:01] the Spirit back up there real quick Lord
[1:47:07] willing in the next few weeks or months
[1:47:08] I want to start I feel like with the
[1:47:10] purpose series now we can start getting
[1:47:11] down I want to identify each of these
[1:47:13] gifts and then I want to give in the
[1:47:16] future hopefully the next week or a
[1:47:17] couple weeks here maybe not and of
[1:47:19] course not next Sunday but the following
[1:47:20] maybe I want to start looking at one
[1:47:22] give us time to meditate and see what
[1:47:24] has God done in my life
[1:47:27] so I want you to pray about that now and
[1:47:29] then will Lord willing we're gonna
[1:47:30] revisit it in the future
[1:47:31] I think I couldn't get to the quote I
[1:47:34] couldn't find it there I'm sorry I
[1:47:36] didn't have time to locate it but
[1:47:37] brother BAM says first find out what
[1:47:39] you've got now we know everybody's got
[1:47:43] something right in both parables the
[1:47:46] preachers had really valuable gifts
[1:47:48] because there have to influence more
[1:47:50] people but the other parable the pounds
[1:47:52] everybody has something everybody has
[1:47:55] something what I like to do not today
[1:48:03] but in the future weeks I also want you
[1:48:04] to be able to write down and say times
[1:48:06] you've seen the Holy Spirit move in
[1:48:07] other people
[1:48:09] like maybe somebody so humble God uses
[1:48:12] them with the word of wisdom to you but
[1:48:14] you're not even they're not even aware
[1:48:16] of it because they're so hungry and God
[1:48:20] supernaturally used someone in the
[1:48:22] church to answer a prayer request or
[1:48:26] something like that because I would like
[1:48:28] to identify I would like you to know
[1:48:30] what gives certain your life wouldn't
[1:48:32] you like to know if Jesus is gonna ask
[1:48:34] you and say what you do with the talents
[1:48:36] I gave you don't wanna know which
[1:48:37] talents you have to see I feel if we go
[1:48:43] this direction it'll encourage you to
[1:48:46] know why God didn't give me something
[1:48:48] God left me a very valuable not left me
[1:48:57] some great gifts I've got to invest in
[1:48:59] that and I want to be accountable honey
[1:49:01] want to be a faithful steward what Jesus
[1:49:03] left here see what does that do than
[1:49:06] that that magnifies every time we are
[1:49:08] gathered together because here's the
[1:49:12] quote out here's one of them I want to
[1:49:13] read the man said yes their church is
[1:49:27] rich but the powers not there God moves
[1:49:31] by his spirit but not not by the amount
[1:49:34] of money or telling the church
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:38] so it doesn't matter how much money or
[1:49:40] what big huge talents we have or what
[1:49:42] they gifts we have we've just got to see
[1:49:44] what we have and yield to the Holy
[1:49:46] Spirit I'm just going to give you some
[1:49:49] spiritual logic here if fewer and fewer
[1:49:52] souls are going to be saved and less and
[1:49:56] less people are going to come to the
[1:49:57] message in America then where will we
[1:50:00] see the gifts operating the most it'll
[1:50:02] be amongst us praise God
[1:50:06] it may minister to others you know
[1:50:08] foolish virgin out there with your
[1:50:10] friends and family and things like that
[1:50:11] it may operate there but church I
[1:50:14] believe we're gonna see it more amongst
[1:50:15] us because there's fewer food and to be
[1:50:21] saved fewer people God moves by his
[1:50:25] spirit a church before we pray how many
[1:50:43] would raise their hands and say God show
[1:50:46] me my gifts what I'm a steward is a
[1:50:52] wisdom knowledge faith healing miracles
[1:50:55] prophecy discernment
[1:50:57] palms our interpretation your God you
[1:51:02] see the hands of sweet
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:06] or not a sobering thought Lord the very
[1:51:10] height of hypocrisy is to take the gift
[1:51:12] and use it for selfish people the wrong
[1:51:17] way
[1:51:18] he was give us sincerity may we keep the
[1:51:23] feast in sincerity improve his pulses or
[1:51:29] or the great prayer desire my artists to
[1:51:32] see each person find out what they find
[1:51:38] out what you've given them what is in
[1:51:40] that pound that they have what is in the
[1:51:44] talent that you given them when they
[1:51:46] possess or once we find out what we have
[1:51:49] that we can work in that ministry then
[1:51:53] we can yield ourselves and we can come
[1:51:55] to the house of God expecting you to
[1:51:57] move Lord Here I am if you need to use
[1:51:59] somebody you can use me I'm willing we
[1:52:26] want to be faithful in them very little
[1:52:28] or we can see like Elvis and people
[1:52:30] today they're given much greater gifts
[1:52:32] and we are as far as singing Lord God as
[1:52:35] far as organization and smartness Lord
[1:52:37] but they're not using them for the
[1:52:39] things of God we're thankful and happy
[1:52:41] to use our very little small gifts happy
[1:52:47] to do it Lord kome happy to be a child
[1:52:50] of the king
[1:52:51] we want you to rule and reign over this
[1:52:54] church ruin way over every life every
[1:52:57] look life surrender to yours in order
[1:53:02] the weeks and months to come if you're
[1:53:03] willing help us in order to be able to
[1:53:06] help to see the supernatural powers in
[1:53:10] mind and gifts you've given to us that
[1:53:14] we can strike a united body for Christ
