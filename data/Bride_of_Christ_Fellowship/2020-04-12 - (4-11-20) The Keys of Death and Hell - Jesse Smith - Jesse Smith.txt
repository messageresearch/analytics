spiritual keys don't we just like Peter had the spiritual keys to the kingdom not that he was walking around carrying a you know a set of keys like we'd have today but it was the authority and it was god-given Authority so let's pray ask the Lord to minister to each and every heart those physically here those are live streaming yesterday we had like 44 views on the the sermon last night so we're

understanding knowing that you possess the authority of death and hell father we thank you lord we know our lives are in your hands those nail-scarred hands in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise God so last night we looked at the Passion of Jesus Christ I've I've never really preached too detailed on the actual you know medical terminology of what he suffered but we looked at it last night and we're so thankful that he took our place you know Jesus had a cardiac arrest so we didn't have to praise God Jesus suffered the extreme dehydration so we didn't have to he bled the sweat drops of blood so we didn't have to and so we're thankful for that all that he did he became the god sacrifice taking all the Nick WA T of mankind upon him that we might receive his righteousness praise God hope that was a blessing to our hearts last night today I was listening to brother Graham preach the entombment I believe jeffersonville listen to that today or they're gonna listen to it tonight I get all the emails from Jefferson I'm signed up for their their email list cuz I'd like to know what they're doing I'm hoping that I can help correct them by God's grace I've tried it I'm gonna keep trying I'm hoping to one of these days to see a little correction there that they'll start changing their tune a little bit but it's a sermon from 1957 a beautiful message brother Branham preaches I think I'll just mention a few things before we get to the keys of death and Hell tonight it's a beautiful sermon brother Branham you know he talks about the absolute of the word we kinda looked at on Wednesday night the absolute and there's nice I got a preacher text me right afterwards and said I absolutely loved your sermon brother Jesse because it's about the absolute praise God it's about Jesus Christ amen he's our hamster there's only one one person who is the absolute that has unlimited power who's unlimited his judgment that's Christ amen so we know there's one absolute and so Jesus and as we saw last night he went the hardest road any man ever went no man had ever been beaten like him no man had suffered like him because Jesus said it was the power of darkness all the demons and gathered there you know and maybe not all but many demons had gathered there and anointed those Roman soldiers to beat him in a way that no man had ever been beaten he had to take the brunt of all sin the pall of the punishment for all mankind for all 6,000 years of human history and in church it gives us a clearer picture of what God thinks about sin God hates sin it's so it's completely opposite to his perfect nature he's so holy so when we look at Jesus Christ we see how ugly sin is when he died on the cross he had to be beaten as we said blindfolded and he couldn't roll with the punches it was even worse the abuse was worse than it could ever possibly be at least a boxer can kind of see when it's coming but Jesus was blindfolded and mocked and scourged in a way that no man had ever been beaten nor ever will be beaten before but he had to do that to show the ugliness of sin God had to show if I'm gonna judge sin this is what sin is gonna look like remember Moses put up the brass serpent member and that was a judgment a snake judge and that's what Christ Christ had to be the brass serpent raised up he had to be lifted up that would draw all men unto Him praise God oh there's no other story Church that will draw all men to God like the story of Jesus's crucifixion amen because he we find ourselves there we see uh we see ourselves as the Sheep running away all of us left him praise God he was despised of men we esteemed him not praise God just like all the women ran the men ran for that day and separated themselves they all ran eventually they came back we know but they all ran and here we esteemed him not we didn't care enough about him but we see what God thinks of sin and brother have said he died so much that even the son had to acknowledge it praise God amen a son that never breaks its pattern it'll never break its its pattern of day and night his ordinance it's always faithful in its ordinance and my man said he was so holy Jesus was so holy that the very son he created by the word amen because he was the word amen the very Sonny created had to just stop shining for three hours from 12 to 3 even the Sun all creation had to witness that the Creator was dying in the form of a man praise God we know the Creator can't die as a spirit of course so the Creator had to form himself a body he formed a body that he himself could take to the cross and when that word body that that perfect body died all the creation had to turn turn off right brother Adam even said God the Father had to turn away from his own son because he cried Jesus cried out my God my God why hast thou forsaken me the spirit turning away from the flesh all the sin of mankind was laid upon him and so brother Ram said not only nature had to witness he was God son so did all sinful humanity even the Roman soldier praised God Oh even the ones who didn't believe never believed God proved it so much that even sinners ranked sinners that were evil men that their whole job was to murder people on the cross there are an entire livelihood they made their money by killing people and God made them recognize that truly this man was the son of God amen he was so holy in his death he was so holy in his life he was so holy in his resurrection and I feel his holiness and I praise God amen thank the Lord and His Holiness is here for you and I tonight praise God he was so holy Butler and said when he was in the tomb when they laid his body in the tomb member from 3 to 6 o'clock they had three hours to take his body off the cross and to put it in Joseph of Arimathea stoom because he had to die on the Friday member Jewish days go from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m. that's their day so a Jewish day their Saturday is already finished they're already started Sunday where as far as right now they've already started their Sunday so Jesus had to die and to give up the ghost at 3 o'clock I believe was it 3 or 12 I can't remember now I think it was 12 yeah it's 12 and so he I think was it 12 or 3 why can't I remember I study too much it got too much in there a little muddled in my mind but he had from 12 to 3 there was no light it was no Sun so from 3 to 6 that women took him down and spices prepared his body and took him to the tomb and had to hurry off because they could not work on a Sabbath day they could not be out and about doing any business than to be home by 6 o'clock and there and there they would rest they had to have all the unleavened bread ready all the the spices that have all but ready because all they could do on Saturday was resting can you imagine Mary see resting all day Saturday thinking about her son died on the cross and the light of the Sun light turned off for three hours can you imagine all the saints and what has happened here he was supposed to take over and they remember they didn't they didn't catch everything Jesus said remember we saw it last night he kept telling them the Son of Man has to suffer many things and then rise again and they didn't even catch it right because they're just human they were born again right and so can you imagine that Saturday no doubt they're they're sad they're hopeless they they're trying to understand what has happened now God just fulfilled all these scriptures and they don't even know what's going on oh my but God is faithful amen he's faithful to the believers even though they miss what he's doing many times that's what God does he fulfills his word and then tells everybody what he did praise God let me tell you there's gonna be one word that you and I if we're born again we won't miss and that will be the body change amen we won't be late on that one we won't list that one if we're born again the Bible said the Spirit of God will change us in the moment and the twinkling of an eye a man but after the rapture won't be one second late praise God he said everything is working he said perfectly everything is on time everything is working perfectly in God's plan amen hallelujah thank the Lord and I'll say I guess I'm glad he's tearing so that my children can get the Holy Ghost hallelujah so people can complain all they want I'm gonna rejoice praise God anyhow you tarry long enough so I could get the Holy Ghost I'm glad you didn't come in brother Rams Day because I wasn't here yet I would spirits I would have lived for Christ I would have died to myself I would have take up my cross and follow him daily praise God hey man I would have found this bloody footprints I wouldn't know him in the in the goo powers resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings praise God I want to know this Jesus I wouldn't know now in this life and I went on in the future for all eternity praise God I just want to know him because he's the lovely one he's the eternal one he's the absolute praise God I just want to know him my Creator my God my lord and my king praise God but listen Jesus was an idol when his body was in the tomb we think he was just laying there dead but he was down still conquering conquered everywhere he went brother Stephen healin he conquered everywhere amen no matter where he was if there's wine he conquered the water the water change it to behine praise God wherever he was where the dead he raised him up he was constantly conquering and even in his death he was conquering death praise God hey Ben he went down with medicine and took the keys away from Satan he's got the keys of both death and hell tonight he said because I live you can live also amen now this is a beautiful story now you know the story where brother man it's one of the most beautiful dramas I think I've ever heard preach is when rogram dramatizes Jesus going down to hell and then the paradise we'll get to that in just a moment I'm not gonna spend much time on that but I want you to see this here I want to just background and do some teaching through the Word of God to show us why Jesus had to do this why do you have to do this now how many no Hebrews 11:1 what does the Bible describe faith as faith is a what is it is it an invisible thing or is face something you can buy at the store no but it is a substance right faith is it a portion of the Holy Spirit faith is a substance of something spiritual it has to be a substance of the Holy Spirit because there's only two kind of spirits right there's only you spirits or the holy spirit praise God and and Paul says faith is a substance so the old let's look at the Old Testament believers here for a moment the Bible said Abraham is the father of us all and yet Abraham here could not be born again which is why Jesus Christ had to come in the first place the Holy Ghost could not be given until Jesus was glorified praise God that's John 7:37 239 so abraham like all men was born a sinner he had an inherent sin nature just like david row he said behold I was shapen iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me and then Romans 3:23 says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God Abraham was raised in the year of Chaldees which is a southern Babylonian city I believe modern-day Iraq even as a sinner Abraham's soul was thirsting for God because David said it's my soul that thirst for the Living God amen because member brother have said you got a natural thirst and you got a soul thirst praise God so Abraham had this time n we're gonna this is we're building why Jesus had to come the way he came so Abraham was thirsting for God but he had no faith at first his soul was in a state of unbelief because it didn't have the anointing of faith but one wonderful day in Mesopotamia the glory of God appeared to Abraham praise God and this said separate yourselves from your family and your kindred and go to a land that I'd called you to go and Abraham didn't question course we know he was Abram at that point he didn't question he said just said yes Lord I'll follow he didn't need all the details you know women I know my wife likes lots of details but Abraham didn't have many details to give to Sarah I write well where are we going I'm not sure I'm just following the Lord well how long we gonna go I'm not sure we're just gonna follow a little hard there was not many details but there's one thing's for sure he had God's Word he had in assurance he had faith in the promise of God amen he had a substance he didn't have many details but he had a substance that said this Way's right praise God that's what you and I know we come to this message we've come to the Word of God we can't explain everything but we know one thing we've got something inside of us that knows God's Word is true praise God amen and we're going to believe it with all of our hearts because the glory of God appeared to us like it did to Abraham praise God the Bible said every sinner is turned from the error of his way so Abram had to be turned from the he was going the wrong way he had to be turned from the error of his way and follow the Lord which he did the Bible said by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went praise God we can just type in we can say hey phone tell me I need directions here there you have to worry about it we know where we're going he'll tell us right there where we're going Abraham didn't have that luxury praise God all she had was God's positioning system right the GPS God's positioning system that's all you had you had no idea to know he just obeyed God's Word and started walking praise God Amen like brother Branham in down south with that the black woman there right with the washed woman in Tennessee right the Holy Spirit just said start walking and he start walking praise God church that's about like my life the Holy Spirit tells me just start pastoring I don't know how long I don't know where but I'm gonna keep filing God's voice until he tells me something different praise God I don't know other details I don't know what's going to happen in this year that year we don't know what's going to happen but we can hear God's voice and we have a choice either disobey and run from it or obey it god help us to obey His Word amen praise the Lord he said I obeyed by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker was God who never said he was looking all round like this he said all's he had to do was look up because the city was up it was the New Jerusalem Amen that's the real city he was looking for my oops four or five 3000 years in advance he's looking for where is this New Jerusalem where is it and it was in heaven but he was attached to it all my church you and I should be so happy because we've got a magnetic attraction a spiritual magnet that's attracted to the New Jerusalem praise God if Abraham had at most even and I'm a child of Abraham then I've got his same seed I've got the same magnet I'm connected to the future home praise God amen because I'm a child of Abraham on the sea the same seed of Abraham praise God hallelujah so see Abraham gets saved and now when he gets saved the Holy Spirit comes as a little anointing and it's like a seed that's fallen upon his soul yet that seed was not yet quickened we just say like this in other words there's not enough anointing there to quicken his soul we'll say like that but he has some anointing on this soul because the Bible says the Bible literally says Abraham was justified by faith Abraham was declared righteous in all the animal sacrifices he could offer God looked at him and said you're righteous the Bible calls lot righteous as well in second Peter 79 lot was a righteous man and a righteous soul so that means he didn't have a soul of unbelief he had a soul of faith and faith is a substance it's a spiritual anointing praise God but it wasn't the fullness of the anointing that was going to come later amen praise God now that see that they received a great potential amen hallelujah but it could not be quickened all the way here because the spiritual conditions weren't ready for it now let me give you a natural illustration anybody ever plant any seeds this spring my wife's planning numerous little seeds in these little containers right the natural seed lays dormant until three conditions are met right sufficient water sufficient light and fertile soil the spiritual seed of God's Word also needs three conditions met in Abraham's lifetime only two of the three conditions were present see the waters of the Spirit was available to believers his member David said remember David said my cup runneth over praise God amen the Holy Spirit waters were just running over his human spirit right his human mind he said my cup is running all over I'm just overflowing I dance and I sing and I praise God and I play the music and the instruments and I dance when the arts returning right he his cup ran over and he loved the Lord thank you Lord amen see their minds and bodies what could be anointed but the spiritual light and the fertile soil were unavailable so two out of the three conditions were unavailable and I'm gonna prove this by the word I mean maybe never heard this before but I'm taking this is like the revelation that comes to me as I'm writing this book here so David and even David and of course Abraham had the water the anointing would fall on them but they didn't have the two other conditions the spiritual light and the fertile grounds and you'll see what I mean in just a moment because the scripture will answer it to us now spiritual light they start with light first we have light and fertile soul the spiritual light is the knowledge of Jesus Christ and the forgiveness of his sins through the cross that specifically said in 2nd Corinthians 4:6 can you pull out their case you say Corinthians 4:6 Paul says the light of the knowledge of Jesus Christ has shined upon you praise God amen Abraham didn't have that knowledge of the Messiah as far as all the oh that his blood was going to accomplish because God command the light to shine of darkness has shined into our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ amen in other words we're looking in the face of Christ and his light is shining upon us a we're not looking away from Jesus we're not looking away from Jesus we're looking right at him we see him and that light shines upon our souls praise God amen I leave the area and what is soil soil is an honest and good heart in Luke 8:15 can you pull that up there occasion Luke 8:15 this now this may be new to you but I think you'll see it the spiritual fertile soil was unavailable that's because the blood of bulls and goats could not purify the human heart and there's a lot of scripture on that church so see Abraham had the water but he didn't have the light of the knowledge of Christ all that he was going to accomplish and he didn't have the fertile soil but that on the good ground are they with you at the honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience praise God now the reason we say this is because the book of Hebrews 9 says that Abraham's flesh cannot be purified after animal sacrifice could you ball Ebers 9 900 but as human spirit or heart didn't completely feel good let's blow up Hebrews 9 here just for a moment Hebrews 9 9 let me pull it up here on my device here this was just a great blessing to me alright Hebrews 9 9 which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscious now let's apply that church who's this speaking to anyone in the Old Testament anyone under the blood of bulls and goats they can make a sacrifice they could whether as a Turtledove or a heifer whatever was a goat a lamb but they would walk away and their conscience wasn't quite quite clean yet they still had a guilty conscience knowing I know I'm gonna go back and do this again and again and again and again can everybody say Amen see so Abraham see the conditions weren't right brother Stephen I hope everybody could see that the sea could not be totally quickened because the fertile ground wasn't there the blood of the animals couldn't take away their guilty conscience amen ah so Abraham would worship and he would sacrifice he feel forgiven because he know he's forgiven because God said so but in he still had a guilty conscience turn to Hebrews 10 3 so Keysha Hebrews 10 3 see Abraham would remember his sins year after year Hebrews 10 3 but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year right so so Abraham would sacrifice year after year verse 4 said it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin so his his conscience never got pure he never really felt like oh I feel clean before God in my mind and I know I'm gonna be a just different person right it's proof because he lied to the one king a few years later he lies to the other key see those sacrifices could have purified his soul because the life of the sacrifice couldn't come upon him uh-huh but it comes upon you and I thank God hallelujah see animal blood in church this is the Bible animal but blood does purge your flesh but not your human spirit see with the unclean when spear God cannot baptize Abraham's human soul with the Holy Spirit nor even his human spirit did you catch that even Abraham's human spirit couldn't be baptized with the Holy Ghost because the blood of bulls and goats can never take away his guilty conscience and we just sang about that church that hear all my shame is gone at the cross shame and sin cannot exist at the cross of Christ amen it can't because he paid for it's all right there and it's all paid for and it has to be sent away praise God a man like the like to go right like the scapegoat there's two goats one of the goats would live one of the goats would die the one that would die the high priests put his hands on his head and confess all of his sins and all of Israel's sins and they sent him away until he fell over a cliff they forced him to fall over Duke lift till until he until he's totally out of the country and the word came back and said the sins been paid for the sins paid for and it comes all the way back to the temple where the people would receive it and say we're forgiven but in all reality they're conscious never got purged because it's impossible for the blood of a goat to take away your sins but it's possible because the goat was guilty right a goats not perfect but it's possible when a perfect sacrifice dies for an imperfect one that God imputes that righteousness unto the sinner praise God through a substitutionary word praise God amen I don't need it because the the full price of sin has now been paid hallelujah yea now joel has two scriptures that show he never felt just with God pull up job 9 - did you know that church joke never really felt equal God said you're perfect by the animal sacrifice as far as I do forgive you through this temporary way of animal blood but Joel never felt just with God he couldn't he couldn't because the animal blood couldn't purge his mind it couldn't wash away his mind now look what he says I know it is so of a truth but how shall man be just with God God had already called him perfect remember chapter 1 remember chapter 2 God said you're forgiven by the animal blood your perfect but Joey still doesn't feel just you don't feel justified or right with God you and I have such a privilege we can actually feel right with God today we can act like we just read our memory verse right we can think on good things and the Bible says when we think on things that are true the peace of God that passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds through Jesus Christ amen oh sorry Joe couldn't have it David couldn't have it Abraham couldn't have it Adam and Eve couldn't have it but we can have it praise God that's exactly what the Word of God says amen oh thank you lord job said I just don't feel right with God of course he couldn't job said I need a mediator pull up verse 33 job 9:33 he says I need a mediator isn't there something that can stand before me and a holy God job 933 neither is there any days men be Twix us that might lay his hand upon both of us right don't just want somebody to say hey can you be a mediator can you talk to this holy God for me because I can't I need someone to come stand in the way someone that knows when I go through oh holy God does it know right the invisible spirit doesn't know what it's like to be tempted so the invisible spirit had to build himself a body praise God a body that could be tempted and now this high priest this body can stand between us and the holy God and bridge the way and forgive us praise God because he can relate to what we went through and he can give us victory to overcome what we're battling praise God hey man Oh hallelujah thank the Lord David said the same thing David said if thou Lord should mark iniquities O Lord who shall stand see they could they and if anybody sacrifice animals it was David and Solomon and yet David still saying who can stand before God no matter how many animals I sacrifice I can't do it because they could have the blood didn't have the power David said in thy sight shall no man livin be justified Paul even said that the law couldn't justify believers by the deeds of the law there should be no flesh justified in his sight mine so see Church you know all through the Old Testament see how these believers they had anointings on them but when that anointing left they didn't even feel like they were really saved right they did awful things like when David lost anointing adultery murder Abraham lost the anointing lie lie right Sarah lost anointing laugh at God and lied to God's face and God had mercy on it see because they didn't have the opportunity their sacrifices weren't powerful enough the Bible said Abraham and the Old Testament Saints lived a life that was subject to bondage and the fear of death due to the weakness of animal sacrifices they were always scared oh my god oh we're gonna die am i right with god they just lived constantly under fear that's why church they would cry so lo remember I've run it this week they cried a month for Aaron I think it was three months for Moses would he die they were just cry and wail because it was such a sad thing like there was uncertainty they didn't feel forgiven oh my but we can go to funerals we can cry for our loved ones in a second later we can raise our hands that they thank God we know where they're at Jesus paid for their sins and the Bible said to me to die here is to be present with the Lord praise God amen what a blessing praise the Lord the Bible said the law was a schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ it's a strict teacher right this business this is you're wrong you're wrong you sinned again you're sinned again you send again and it was a teacher to show us we need grace amen we need grace the weak animal sacrifices just showed our constant need for for forgiveness and mercy and mercy because we were so guilty guilty guilty all the time Church we know Satan stands like an accuser of the Brethren does he not praise God he stands there accusing us and what a look at his scripture here if you could pull this up Colossians 2:14 yea Colossians 2:14 let's put that up there now here's what Jesus did on the cross he blotted out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us now how do you blot out handwriting you got to erase it right or you got to mark all over it what is the blood of Jesus Christ dude it erases praise God it washes away all sins Amen you saw like we saw last night a fountain has open now in the house of the Gentiles praise God there's a fountain of Mercy flowing out of here you can be forgiven you can feel loved you can feel accepted you can know you're going to heaven it's a fountain flowing today praise God Amen hallelujah but Jesus he took his blood down to hell but a man said he first stopped at those that rejected in Noah's day but ran said that was his first stop he said he knocked on the door he said I told you he sighed he said mode or Noah told you he said enoch told you that I was coming and you failed to repent brother and so they screamed out and cried out but Ram said he shut the door Jesus shut the door in their faces and as he went down to the lower depths of hell but man said he condemned every demon tuberculosis cancer he condemned everyone on the way down until he finally got to Satan's house and then he took it and knocked on that door and brother bam dramatizing said oh I finally got you he's a saint that was he was so proud of himself I finally got I thought I had you when I got Abel he said though I thought I got you when I got Moses I thought for sure I had you when they got John the Baptist he said but now I got you see I've taken your life and brother man who said that Jesus stood there and he said safety and he said I'm here to offer you a notice that the blood my virgin born pure blood is still wet and hot on the cross of Calvary and I'm taking your authority because all to sin debt all the other all the slaver you have all the rights you have what everyone else has been paid for praise God amen and my dad said he just walked over and took the keys and my dad said when he left he gave him a healthy kick and kicked him in there left him in his house and slammed the door he's God amen that's our mighty conquer he blotted out the handwriting I dramatized before maybe Satan had all these lists ha liquid Abraham did I got him haha Jove yep there look at all Joseph's move oh look at Sarah look at Jesse Smith mother look at him go oh my he had all this handwriting against us right because we're all sinners but Jesus must have come in there he took the keys kicked him down and he blotted he took the baby his own blood and he applied his blood and it just took everything clean praise God he blotted out all the head right and then Satan comes we'll where's the record I'm the all this record on the Saints he had no record he has no authority to keep them that's why I team to say come on with me we're going up to Jerusalem praise God amen hallelujah he brought it out in the Bible said it was actually nailed to his cross amen but we'll head back up there he nailed it to his cross so uh that's that's what it was all that all of our judgments was nailed to his cross he paid for the blood was applied to the paper can I say like that hey the blade the paper was signed with Jesus's blood praise God and he bled out any handwriting that was contrary to us and took it out of the way amen hallelujah only time had ever been done only has to be done one time praise God only ass be done first one sacrifice one offering praise God thank the Lord he took it out of the way nailing it to his cross in other words all the evidence of my sins sister Beatrice you can't find it in heaven it's taken out of the way it's not in the way it's out of the way praise God that means I don't mean there's nothing stopping you and I from accessing the father praise God and how do we do it through the soul of a man through Jesus the mediator all of our sin has taken all the way and now we have access by prayer through one spirit to Almighty God through the son a man oh what a blessing what promises that we have praise God thank the Lord taken out of the way the Lord laid him on him the iniquity of us all all of our iniquity was laid upon him but he blotted it out all the handwriting that was against us Jesus became the ransom he paid he was our ransom he paid our sin-debt he paid in full by the substitutionary sacrifice of his holy blood praise God let me try to bring this down here so hope church that's right you can open you could see it now the Old Testament Saints they they didn't have the holy blood that you know that all the ordinance were still against him Satan still had them the whole time they're even up there living oh I got I tricked the trick Isaac that I got in the lie just like his daddy ha ha I got him good there so he had all these things against him so they were they were never really forgiven until the blood of Christ came amen to wash it all the way praise God to pay the price for them an equal price had to be paid and I heard a preacher say this let me just if I can help it just came to me Church you and I must never forget how valuable we are you know if I put my house on the market let's not try to sell for whatever 75 or 100 thousand whatever it's only worth what somebody's going to pay if nobody's gonna pay 75 or 100 then it's not worth that much right it's only worth what you pay for it right like they say like my dad always told me you get what you pay for if it's a high cost that it must be pretty valuable usually right now take that same approach to your love what price did God pay to buy your love how valuable worry how much did you cost amen praise God how much were you worth to God I'd say like this you're more than a goat praise God you were worth more than a goat to God more than a food a few bullets a few hundred thousand bullets you're much more than that you were worth the price of his son praise God his holy sinless obedient son that's your value don't ever forget how valuable you are because God he emptied heaven of his son praise God right his son came down and he emptied him bankrupt heaven sent his son down that he might pay the price for our sins that's how valuable you are praise God thank you Jesus because he was worth it it was worth it the price to pay to get your love praise God and now to fellowship with you forever praise God Amos never ending amen we're just starting it here this is just a foretaste this is just a first root of the Fellowship we're gonna have with Jesus for all eternity praise God Amen this is the very slow a little portion I can't wait to get the phonus of it praise God amen to see the one that I've served these years just to see him and lay at his feet and I program said just lay on his feet for a thousand years it'll be worth it all day and praise God to see his face and to know that he is the true force he is the true love of this world he's the only love in this world praise God the only one worth living for praise God a man because he is truth thy Word is truth all other religions and runes and doctrines and and denominations they have lies in them but ours has the truth praise God amen we believe it's all true to the ability God will let us have it praise God what I mean is we don't know every answer to every question what our doctrines are all true praise God amen I believe that with all my heart think about it serpent seed Godhead church ages seals modesty hair length holiness righteousness look at all her doctrines they are truly the word amen they're truly God's Word as I told that one gentleman on the podcast I said the beautiful thing about the message is you don't have to say the word William Branham to teach it now I'm a pretty soon remember it like it was me they didn't tell me William Branham at first but after I'm like this is too much where'd this come from I know this is gonna come from you where did it come from oh that's oh yeah William Branham that's right now other people like that remember that Mike guy it was the guy from your the pastor from your city Mansfield the pastor there witnessed that Mike girdle he was a homosexual he gave him a card about brother Branham and that caused him to write a letter to Jeffersonville get a book and he got saved so see it doesn't matter how you come in but what matters is you're searching for truth and there's only one truth there's only one absolute that's Christ our Lord doesn't matter how you come in but the beauty of it is is God's Word it defends itself there's no contradictions praise God and it produces a holy man's taste amen hallelujah now Peter listen first Peter 1:18 2:19 you pull out there please sign first Peter 1:18 2:19 praise God you were so valuable you weren't you weren't purchased with something like gold you're way more valuable than gold that ought to make somebody shout you are not even redeemed with diamonds you're way more valuable you and I are way more valuable than golden diamonds amen those just things you find in the earth they're dirty and odd and you got to clean them we're way more valuable in that the Bible says you are not redeemed with corruptible things hallelujah as silver and gold from your vain conversation by tradition from your father's now in the old days you used to buy slaves right they said but by white slave a back black slave yellow slave you combined for a certain amount of money but but that would corrupt but Jesus the Bible says verse 19 that we were bought with corruptible things but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot praise God the only holy bread there ever was praise God that would remain holy forever was the blood of Jesus Christ and God said I'm not buying you with gold that perishes and diamonds that break and I'm buying you as something holy my blood of my own son praise God amen this holy blood hallelujah that's how valuable we are praise God amen geez didn't say here can I give you my Discover card I'll pay for that he said can I give you a slide you a couple hundreds or a couple Benjamins no he paid it with his blood he poured out his blood for you and I and that was sufficient payment praise God Holy Innocents son of God Lamb of God holy innocent man that is a valuable payment the Bible said it's an incorruptible payment for our sins ain't ahead oh thank you lord precious blood precious blood redeem means to release the receipt of ransom so when Christ redeemed us he paid he paid for us and got the receipt that's what ransom means I paid and I got the receipt I didn't hear ya I paid for it I got proof that I paid for it praise God he got proof because the Bible said he had proof because he rose Amen that was his proof he came back amen he invaded hail Saints and then he come back to tell about it praise God he came to back he came so look I got the keys of death and hell death can't hold me down praise God you know why because death was made for sinners and Jesus Christ wasn't a sinner so death couldn't hold him because he died here in a state where he should not have died death can only he that sinneth shall die right the soul that sinneth it shall die well jesus never sinned so death could never hold and praise God hey man that's why I took the power of death himself and now he has control over death and hell hey man thank the Lord that's our Lord hallelujah and that's why Abraham and all of us his godly friends were all kept in that bosom cuz they were they didn't have a valuable they were they weren't redeemed their price was them paid the the handwriting was still against them the blood of bulls and goats couldn't wash it away it couldn't cleanse it Satan had brought all men's souls into bondage when he overcame Adam right in the Garden of Eden at the beginning but the Bible said in acts 20:28 Christ purchased the church with his own blood praise God dying and the since and since the wages of sin was death death was an innocent substitute it was a lawful payment for the redemption of believing Souls the wages of sin is death right the wages of sin is death so Christ's blood was a substitute and a lawful payment to cover our sins and redeem us because he died he died unjustly praise God he died and should not have died hallelujah jesus said the Son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and give his life for a ransom from uh-uh praise God Jesus wasn't telling her but hey come sir me come come make my life easier he wouldn't say that he was ministering to them he was he see so I come to give my life for you praise God that's what our Lord did hallelujah yes scripture declared Hebrews 9:22 without shedding of blood is no remission God had this eternal law his law in heaven there's their sins of Abraham and Jove and David cannot be remitted until blood is shed and so Jesus Christ paid the price now with some corruptible kind of payment that anybody could pay he paid it with special payment an incorruptible blood praise God hallelujah what a blessing let me see where I want to close here how the different scriptures I want to see Jesus Christ blood was so powerful he nailed that list two of our sins of the cross and blotted it all out also put up Ephesians 2:14 also we as Gentiles we all had a big problem our problem was we didn't have any covenants right we've been preaching on the covenants lately right on the Sunday night our problem was were Gentiles we hadn't known the Bible said no hope no covenants no God no nothing but the Bible says when Jesus died look at this verse 14 for he is our peace who have made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us the the law had built up this wall like like the tables of stone that you could imagine that Moses held they were like a law saying stay out stay out but when Jesus died on the cross he said I'm not just dying for Jews I'm dying for Gentiles praise God so the handwriting was blotted out and the wall came falling down I wonder if that's why there was an earthquake praise God because there is a spiritual wall that fell down praise God and then we now we can come in there's no more while I'm ahead if there's a wall like Trump's building the wall it keeps people out but if the wall falls down now we have access now we can come in now we can know what God's Word is all about we can have confidence we can have promises we can have assurance that heaven will accept us praise God amen and not only that but here's the one thing my wife reminded me not only did that wall fall down the veil got torn in two and now God say he used to say stay out but now you say come on in I want my life to dwell in your soul praise God I want to feel every fiber of your be come on in more than just clean your flesh I want to clean your mind more than that I want to clean your soul praise God amen so your nature is God's nature no longer yours but now it's God's amen look at all those things the handwriting up blotted out the wall fell down the veil torn he was tearing up all hell's powers amen he conquered death in the hell mighty Conqueror Jesus Christ amen hallelujah that's that's our Lord praise God I know tomorrow's Easter they're gonna put that thing on Facebook where that that preacher preaches all about Jesus all those names of Jesus he said that's my king that's what it is have you seen that brother Steve it's beautiful guys about ten million views on it this preachers saying he's the highway of wholeness he's the I forget he's all he's everything he's the Prince of Peace he just goes on this rant you know his beautiful glorious divine rant for like five minutes and then he said who is he Jesus Christ that's my king praise God amen that's the way I serve the one that tore the veil the one that knocked on the wall that won the blood of all the sins that's my I kidding praise God I'm into the house of ours that I'm now in the household of faith I'm in his house praise God that's in he if he's in Chapter two I'm up I mean in the house I'm part of the house of God Amen I'm not outside the house I'm in the house praise God just like children they're in my house they don't sleep outside they're in the house they get the food they get the benefits of the food that heat the because they're mine I wanted to have it praise God they get all the benefits in church look at the benefits you get by being in Christ house amen forgiveness Redemption love joy peace mercy power victory gifts and love whatever it need of it's in God's house praise God amen nothing to fear praise God nothing to be worried about especially in this hour we have nothing to to discourage us we should remember that he's alive and well and he has the keys of death and he'll praise God as I close I'm not sure which I wonder which one I want to close with here at church I don't know how God does this but here let me just finish with this thought here I'll go to more thoughts just real quickly program said after Jesus defeated Satan he took the keys of death and hell he blotted out all the handwriting he went over but Ram said he knocked on Abraham's door he said Abraham looked out and said ah that's the one who sat with me under the oak tree that's the one that discerned my wife saw her Sarah look that's him and brother Aaron goes through all the scenes right Daniel saw him as a stone coming out of the mountain right Ezekiel saw him as a meat or wheel in the middle of a wheel I still don't understand that if somebody could explain that to me I'd appreciate that way up in the middle there I don't understand what that's like when he's a wheel as a wheel and everyone that Joel said that's the Redeemer I saw him and I'm gonna stay with him on the earth and mother said he didn't know it but he said I'm gonna be doing it in 15 minutes for his God amen John's like 15 minutes I'll be standing with him on the earth praise God brother said Jesus had to come in and he had announced he said I'm here I'm the virgin born son of God but RAM said it repeats he said my blood is still wet on the cross now look how fast brother look how fast Jesus moves in the theophany Jesus bodies still probably hanging up there but yet his Souls already down there in hell cleaning it up praise God tearing it up amen he said my blood is still wet because he's in theophany 4 because remember they travel a lot faster in a dimension we got to speed up when these days were gonna speed up praise God if we see the rapture in our data will speed up right and they'll slow down that song so Jesus is worries we tell him I've redeemed you and Bob Anderson they all rejoice and they'll say let Jesus let's go come with me Abraham and Sarah say oh Jesus we loved our life so much in that Promised Land can we make a whistle-stop there and Jesus said yes that yep that works perfectly with my plan I wanted to show myself alive for 40 days he said yes Abraham that would work out perfectly look how Jesus you know Abraham had the mind of Christ God they on the same Mountain praise God and on resurrection morning Christ rose first they make and then all the Saints rows and were seen of many praised God and then Jesus forty days later he showed himself the disciples program said the disciples on that mountain they didn't see all the saints ascend they only saw Jesus ascends which is interesting the Bible said Jesus left on a white cloud the Bible said when he has sent it up on high he led captivity captive so pretty soon after he got out of the other sight in the clouds he said Abraham Isaac Jacob job come on boy Sarah come on Rebecca come on we're going home now praise God and Abraham you're going to be closer to that City you're looking for praise God amen he wasn't close threw it down the heart of the earth but now he's closer than he ever has been before and let me say that's Church we're closer to the rapture that we ever been before praise God amen we're so close praise God it may be another five years ten hundred who knows but we're closer than we ever made we should be on fire for Christ hallelujah well the mayor said Jesus Scott joined by all the Saints said come on Bob said Jesus lead or brother I said that you let him pass you know the Milky Way and I don't know how that possible God does it he's so great he goes best all the moon and the stars and all these things he goes in that other dimension and then Psalms 40:24 7 through 10 Psalms 24 7 to 10 brother Branham brings out this scripture and said this is the conversation that Christ had and the Saints and the angel doorkeepers as they came into heaven this is the conversation praise God but ransom the Saints start realizing they're getting close to heaven he said they can see the big pearly white gates and everything up there and so the Saints shout out lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors and the King of glory shall come in a man see they knew he was a king and he's our king tonight praise God the king of all glory praise that's who we're serving today the king of glories in our midst tonight amen next verse the angel shot back who is the king of glory and the Saints shot back the Lord strong and mighty the Lord mighty in battle amen see they saw Jesus come in he breaks down the door he comes in her knocks on the door and he takes him out and Satan and held them there but now he's mighty now he straw look how strong is he said we're not keeping us down here you're coming with me they'd seen him in battle praise God they passed all those demons on the way out praise God they passed all when their feet all the way because there was a stronger one with them there's a conquer with them he's the same one who's with us tonight praise God amen he's strong and mighty in battle praise God they seen him rescue them from their that the heart of the earth and bringing them up past every devil and then be amongst men as well praise God hallelujah it's beautiful see they're shouting he the Kings credentials he's strong he's mighty he's a warrior in battle praise God amen they know Jesus's credentials see yet he was slapped we saw last night yet he was slapped and buffeted and spit on and beaten and scourge and stripped and crucified and stabbed yet he went through all that with the Saints don't see that the Saints see how he's strong and mighty and how that was his victory praise God taking every one of those made him a conqueror praise God it made him victorious and that was the battle the battle was take everything they got and you'll still overcome him praise God hey man that was the battle that Christ did for us the mighty conquer every slap every punch every every kick everything he endured every cut he endured it through the battle and brother Graham said he came into heaven but Stephen you've heard a brother Branham says they came down the streets that he said the Angels pressed a button and he said the door swung open and then Jesus Arslan sainted him arrested all the celebrity angels of heaven are lining the streets cheering them clapping form and Jesus Melissa Jesus stopped and said father father I've shed I've shed the blood here I am victorious and he said jesus said father I want to show you I got proof I overcame in the battle here's the scars that are in my palms amen look at this look at that cut in my side look at my feet the proof that I fought the battle and I'm the victor I'm the mighty Conqueror praise God everywhere so the voice comes out from the throne son come sit on the Majesty
