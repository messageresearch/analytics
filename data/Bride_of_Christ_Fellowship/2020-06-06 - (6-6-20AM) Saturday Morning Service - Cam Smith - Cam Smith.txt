then five o'clock tonight and then tomorrow at eleven we're just looking for a great time in the Lord and I know God's gonna continue to speak great things to us praise now listen you know this little song here is our brother cam comes I want to sing that little medley it's a little medley I sing I believe in a hill called Mount Calvary then we kind of transition over so I'll cherish the old where they put a lot of Jesus Christ yeah it's all we need it's where we started it's where we continue in that's where we'll finish praise God because we overcome Satan of the Lamb [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I celebrate 14 14 years of services here how powerful that and what a blessing to be a partaker in this this morning as well as in the past I know I know I I could never have been molded the way I need to be if God had not brought brother Brooks along in my life and then right in the path it was even supernaturally confirmed I was there and at Bible believers and God told me to go to go to Akron and I said what I said okay I guess Lord that's what you want me to do and so I called I called the the Craig up and he was wanting me to do some bigger hand in the youth over there and I said I'm not calling to tell you that I'm taking that I'm calling to tell you that I'm leave and he said brother cam he said how he said how ironic that is he said I was I was the drinking cup of coffee with my wife this morning just something this come out of my mouth I said brother camis go and help his brother in Akron I said I'll take that from the Lord amen and I received a tremendous amount of growth in the truth from both of these fine men of God even so much as the fact I just left where the Brooks preach off I wouldn't complement praise Lord and appreciate the the ministry and so forth but yet we would you count on a privilege an honor I know times are spent but I sure love everybody in the Lord amen it's great to see all the faces here and I don't know about you I it's time to fully have a revelation where two or three are gathered there am I in the midst he's here right now so that means you don't even have to wait to a man a service to get healing I preached when we first started our service I was preaching and a sister got her foot got healed when a hearing of the word it's time that we realize that that the timing is on the Holy Ghost that the timing is that where you're at with him amen each one of us coming in this room we should come in the expectation God whatever you want to it such as a preacher whatever code you want to come out of my mouth it's your expectation God whatever you have to speak through me let it be an amen let it be a praise of Lord whatever it is let it be why because we're now moving into the corridor where the bride is now being perfectly led of the Holy Ghost amen amen any time to look to the future we're hearing don't think sickness and the rites and all these things are just here to say hey you know you got our 10 years living the Laodicean way no it's time to get right and to serve our God in them so with that being spoke did a lot of wrestling I got a lot a lot of things I could preach on and by God's grace he led me here and I believe this is for someone who believes action just confirmed by that song and by a few other things but let's get into our Bibles if we can Luke 9:23 [Music] always gonna sing a breath good see brother John I'm always a blessing England that's a real soldier for God they're here and I've heard that testimony so I said that brother Johnny sure is of ensures a good Christian brother amen so Lord be with you brother great sia and everybody else here aren't you looking forward to gathering time very soon this will all be over all those heartaches to all those pains everything will must be just be set aside together amen ten thousand years already plus ten thousand think we won't spend the first one that how about you guys I think I think wrong girl we all want Jesus can I get that is that possible there's something I have to do thank you okay I preached this a long time ago but Lord my prayers and it just come preach this so where preach at no trust to be a blessing to you today and I'm very excited amen yes I be Christian today Luke 9:23 says and he said to them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily right and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantaged if he gained the whole world and lose himself or be cast away for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his father's and of the Holy Angels if there ever was a time to apply this it would be right now if ever I loved you Jesus my Jesus is now in of our heads for order prayer author and creator heavens and earth humbly we all just come before you right now Lord realizing Lord that we've now taped the order of the battle Lord now even as your prophet spoke God we've sung the songs of Zion and now the ark the word is going forth of God and nor we just oh god we don't desire to hear what would be of a man's thoughts or of a man's words or anything like that but Lord we come here to meet you on these grounds guys we combo God that you would be magnified Lord that you O God would come and touch every single life Oh God and Lord that you would mature this weed oh god as we're sitting here ready Oh God for a body change we're or seated here Oh God Lord we've heard the word Lord we we love you God we've gave up everything for you Lord father mother whatever it is Oh God we've counted the cost of God and we've counted to be worthy Oh God as a sacrifice unto death so we're asking today Lord you'd be with us as we journey in this word lord I pray that there'd be a strength given to the people are and surely Oh God we just ask oh god whatever the need would be in every individual heart that you'd come and move it oh god I as you know Lord we're or just wanting here to be here to be willing and we're glad to be a part of what you've done Lord we prayed aloud to grow leaps and bounds of God we're getting ready Lord so we know a bride's revival is in our midst Oh God so let it be quickened unto us Lord and we just ask Oh God he'd surely speak that whole heart to us in the name of Jesus Christ the church says together and maybe see it I've got a real simple sermon today mistrusted be blasting now we're gonna work with the idea this morning walking in bloody footprints if you're like Lord already told us where to go tonight so I think we're set but by God's grace walking in bloody footprints Amen it's something as we've seen in our scripture there that you know it was Christ who said it to them all he said if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me so we have heard these things we know these things but surely it's God's desire that we would actually take up this cross and we would follow after him but even noticing in the Old Testament you know by typing shadow you know God always sent the art to go before the battle he then probably the one time that they decided to change the order is actually when they came to spy out the land amen the arcade left them all the way through who told them where to go and it came to the place where it was the men's ideas and say let us take some spies and let's go spy out the land oh my and what did they do when they got ahead of the word then God what he allowed them to bring up an evil report amen and any time that we try to get ahead of the word then God will allow us to up it will allow us to fall and falter amen but isn't it great that there's a mercy that's given to God's people in Ohio we should love God when the scripture rolls in our mind that he delighteth in mercy you may have longed the Lord in your relationship but he said he delights in mercy he delights when you come back to him and say God I need you god I Love You God you're all I need him so we find out that you know Jesus said he said take up the cross and follow me and look at proverbs 20 verse 24 it says here says man's goings are of the Lord how can a man then understand his own way every step that you have taken even up to this point right here you could ever understand your way sometimes you've done wrong things sometimes you realize boy that was a really good decision and then what but when you're really looking dive into the word you actually find out that you know what you didn't even fully understand or grasp that which was around you but it was actually God who had your goings already established for you amen and because our goings are from the Lord proverbs 4 26 says it says ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be establishing it so we should never do anything just just messing around or just say well you know I think I'll do this or I'll do that but we should want we should consider the Lord before us in all our ways amen hallelujah and the scripture says in Jeremiah 10:23 it says O Lord I know that the way of man is not in himself so you think you got it figured out do I gotta figure it out hey we find out more more or that one we ain't found out nothing amen hallelujah hallelujah we let people with these degrees and all these things they tell us everything that's right and wrong and so they move it from global warming to climate change and all these things like that because they don't have a clue in that there's a God who is in my wisdom and they cannot comprehend it because God made this earth for a bride and bride to receive His perfect will and in living his perfect will we find out that we come into the mind of Christ who had known the more that he can instruct him hey men ain't nobody here but the scripture says Paul said believe the mind of Christ amen in any we come again in Jeremiah 10:23 it says O Lord I know that the way of man is not in himself see who's gonna get you in a rapture you think it's anything you're gonna do you think it's your legalisms here thickets away you know I have this habit I have this discipline or I have this or that you might be on the exact other side and say I have no discipline hey man what'd you find out what your life was orchestrated from the foundation of the world by God himself to one to direct your steps amen so he says I'm containing it is not a man that walketh to direct his steps that's why I watch pride cometh before a fall hey anytime you find out [Applause] this is everything in it to be led by Christ amen now let's take another step here psalm 37:23 it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord amen David could look and say hey because he knew that he minded the Lord so he says what and he delighteth in his way so God is pleased I mean hey if you're the Bride of Christ then tell me is God pleased with you you may fall you may falter but that's why God gave the what he gave the counsel of his word to say that a righteous man falls seven times but he rises again amen we got a trusting God hallelujah who's gonna oh no I gotta get a vaccine what are you worried about what should you worry about hey men should not worry about trying to get up put a mask on for a for a virus supposedly that is what that is smaller then they can even see what it looks like the trollish yeah I'm not trying to go against science and I'm not trying to go on a rant but what I'm telling you is God has every single thing in control so look he says though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand oh he's got the whole world in his hands I have been young and now em all yet am I not seeing the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread Amen hallelujah there is a God who has everything to make sure that you take the right steps to get in this lecture amen hallelujah now we're going to see some things here now I want you to see this here you're here for these seven now Jesus when he was here on earth he didn't just go about all haphazardly he had one thing to do that was the will of God who sent him and everywhere he went everything he done had a meaning had a purpose had a plan a foreordained plan of God everything he did oh my we said oh yes that's our Lord and if we be the children of God God who orders our foot Save just love your garden and cry out for the Holy Ghost crowd for revival just like he said blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness sake as they shall be so he says what and the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord Jesus never went places or did things unless it had a meaning many men down through the ages has read this same scripture and it has inspired men at a scripture that says your steps are ordered of God that means every single step that you made today God put it there well I just like going to church know there is a Spirit of God in you that desires our hearing of the word don't realize that every single step you made brought your right to where he wanted you we're getting in a place you can't worry about being them hey if you think you're a foolish virgin get at the altar and get right with God and let's believe the word amen that's the doubt the devil's that see the discrepancy he's trying to so you say brother came you must be perfect ain't perfect at all how do you we'll talk my wife glory to God you ain't got time to it's a long story man but I'll tell you today then that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in it if he is the author of your faith that means he is the finisher of your faith 99 to go get you why would he let you go in holiness so we need for what if we're coming to the image of Christ then it comes to the place that we have to realize that your every step has a purpose your every move has a meaning and God is what he's trying to unfold his perfect will in your life oh my let's go again psalm 119 131 I open my mouth and panted for I long for thy Commandments panting Oh for that Commandments tonight 130 to look now upon me and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do unto those that love my name Olivia so long God is used to giving mercy to them hallelujah who are what who are crying out for God they want God to be in their life they might not be able to pray like they think they should or study like they think they should or talk like they should they should but what they're crying out for mercy o my order my steps in thy word and let not an iniquity have dominion over me iniquity the wrongs that we would allow he said don't he said God don't let iniquity have a hold in my life hallelujah so we see that what God is the order of your steps I'm going somewhere chess alright so I was 8513 it says righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his steps oh the scripture is all over he's walking with you he already told you went off he's got everything all right where it needs to be and it's what first John 2 3 it says and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments home he love his work immigrant they met this is a revealed Word amen [Music] hallelujah oh you could be worshipping a free persons this morning you could be trying to figure out who you should worship amen but God revealed to you that Jesus Christ is the image of the Godhead and he is the image of the person that's before you it ain't three different it's one and so he says he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby we know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked what a commandment what a statement that the person who says they want to abide in God they should walk just like he walked well wonder how he should walk like the word no I want to take this a step further and we'll take a little turn here mark 10 20 it says and he answered now here it is the rich young run this is a guy that couldn't live closer as far as my commandment than most of us if not all of us he could say not one thing I've kept it all for my youth oh oh mom anybody want to go with the rich overall hey brother can take me back that mercy scripture of glory to God now in my spot amen so he said 20 verse says he answered and said unto him master all of these have I observed from my youth then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lettuce he brought him to what only one issue with us whole life one thing yeah yeah we yeah some of us we need to find healing and all in every realm of our life come on mm you ever sit there and comment little haze on you still healer though amen absolutely yeah so what one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me amen and he was sad at that saying and when we agreed for he had great possessions and Jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they they have riches enter into the kingdom of God in and he brought the rich young ruler down to one thing that's all you gotta do but notice how he words it all along he said this is what you lack go sell at all but then he says he says what take up the cross and follow me you ever notice how Christ never says get ahead of me lead me Christ never tells you to lead him because he's the shepherd he's gone the whole worm is we've just we went through very quickly but you found there was God that set everything up so that you would follow him even this this portion of scripture that we see open right up to us is the fact that even now coming to the rapture the argument is the same that what there are the reaches of life that are trying to weigh us down they're trying to take over our life and what there is a still small voice that is still speaking and saying take up your cross and follow me amen now isn't a great foreshadowing by the master this master patek when you could actually watch by prefigure speak of the cross that he was going to take up the cross follow me so notice he wants us to what he told the rich of rock take up the cross he got the cross richard rules by sinners and what is he talking about cuz Christ had not had a cross yet in the natural so we find the next step moon there of course you walked away he just didn't want to take up the cross and follow God in Matthew 27 27 it says then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common Hall and gathered unto Him the whole band of soldiers now this is intimate stuff brother-sister this is the husband amen this is what he did for his church this is what he did for creation no ma and it says and they stripped him and put on him a starlit Road to mock his royalty and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail King of the Jews oho those men who had now made the decision and went on to the afterlife or what's left of it oh how they must wonder why did I do it oh my what they did they made a mockery of Christ's sacrifice Oh may we never make and they spit upon him trip the reed smote him on the head and after they had mocked him they took the robe off of him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him all right so now they're getting ready to what bring the crucifixion hallelujah a Eastern Easter doesn't get old brother sister we die daily look at what he did here he is take all those beatings all those scores all those bruisings a notice isaiah 52:13 he says behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high as many were astonished at thee his message was so marred than any man and his form more than the sons of men so shall he sprinkle many nations the Kings shall shut their mouths ahem for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider Omaha hallelujah oh he was so beaten so raised because he was not just taking just one man sin even though he would have done it he was dying for the whole sin of the world and he was so bruised that you couldn't even tell whether that was man or what was that just nothing but blood he did that for each Matthew 27 32 continuing says and as they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross once again Luke 23 26 and as they led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross notice that he might bear it after Jesus hallelujah so Jesus so marred so beaten so Bream's that as we seen in that picture most likely there it is without the blood but in the cross there on him as he's on the ground he could not bear the weight he decided what he couldn't do it they went as far as he could God had to anoint someone to help bears across with him hallelujah there he was so think about it God in his Eternal Word sets forth and even the picture of his crucifixion he lays down every foundation take up your cross and follow me take up the cross follow me and now we see in the scripture that even as he's going to the cross he can no longer bear the weight of the cross so now he with all his might now spent he falls and now there's a man named Simon of Cyrene and now they compel him now they jump on him and they say carry his cross amen so notice Christ now walking before the cross struggling maybe crawling whatever it is the life that he has left and then Simon the Cyrenian takes the cross and their Christ your savior is crawling maybe trying to get up with a crown of thorns bleeding marred all over the ground and there Simon is compelled he has to pick up the cross and he's just got to sit there and follow with his cross bearing his cross Gill says he says that he might bear it after Jesus either the whole of it following Jesus or one end of it Jesus going before with the other end on his shoulder which seems to be the order in which it was carried between them so now we see that Christ and Simon serene but now carrying this cross which we don't have the full eye I prefer to say there it is anyway you see it Christ was right in front yes now notice leaving I'm able to do this 19:50 so here's the way I was praying I'll never forget the way I pray I said Heavenly Father some 1,900 years ago there was an old rugged cross dragging down through the streets of Jerusalem it was dragging out the bloody footprints of the bear on the road up to Golgotha his little weak frail body fell under the law along things Simon the Cyrene a colored man ethiopian picked up the cross and helped him bear the cross said father I'm sure you understand and here's one of his daughters tonight staggering in darkness won't you help her now if I finish this quote he said sister the Lord healed you go on you're all right and numerous times even your prophet when we've been talking about this situation he would saying there was Simon the Cyrene no no many people will get caught up and they'll say and this all I'm so glad we got a seventh angel amen and they'll say it was a Jew it was of the Jewish sect of sorry but every time your prophet picked up he said it was this colored Ethiopian Hawaiian how he must have went through the dimensions seen the picture a lot man hallelujah but notice if this isn't a Jew then it's a Gentile god-ordained a Gentile to share the load of the cross and numerous times as your prophet he's in prayer lines and so lord he'll talk about this he said he said yes and it was your dad's great granddaddy back there and he said all bones for the helium some weight that it was a Gentile Amen hallelujah because those traitors were inserting someone to share the load he chose a Gentile amen and picked up the cross and they struggled right up bloody footprints of the bear he was dwindled down to nothing but bloody footprints every step had a purpose he was driven how could he not go to Calvary his whole life he had done all of it just for this one God Hebrews 13:12 wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach this reproach as ashamed as a burden if one would follow Christ just like Simon the Cyrene he had a lot he had to take part in the reproach of a crucifixion hallelujah but he didn't realize the whole time that he was carrying that cross he was tearing cross of his sage I love it how Spurgeon Rose we talked about this and he said he said oh how might we envy this Simon the Cyrene with the very honor and privilege to carry the cross of Jesus Christ he said but we need not envy he said because there's a cross for each one of us to perón a new young notice no matter how it went with Christ up that hill Simon he didn't look off and see the other path and say I'm gonna go this way the Prophet the scripture says he followed him straight you say who are you actually following who's actually the leading your footsteps see this Matthew 16:24 let's set Jesus on his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will lose his life or save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world but what shall a man give in exchange for a soul for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his words deny yourself you don't think Simon had those thoughts but he just the anointed path and he was talking he could have revolted because anything he just what he denied his own will and perfectly across the counter first Peter 2:20 says for what glory is it when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently all right are you getting trouble for your faults what is it if you take a piece of me you didn't wrong but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God hmm for even hereunto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps all right same pathway if you have his spirit you will do the same thing it might be unique in its design but it's always coming down to what will you give up to serve the Lord which is why right now in time is so important because we don't have all that's right it's time to go yeah got time to set up the mansion it's time to go see Jesus amen who who did no sin neither was guile deceit hurt rickety trickery found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously what can we take the final Christ we can take whatever the cost is in the son u- scripture says ask for gold tried in the fire in him we've got to walk in his statutes his steps isn't Leodis here his steps there's what there's a perfect precise plan that he has for each one of us half the time we look at our inabilities or say I can't think right I can't talk right I can't do this right you can't do any of that right that's why he wants to be in yo his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness rights ye were he told him in his stripes healed you two thousand years ago he can't do it again it's done it don't matter how crazy or your father says it doesn't matter how bad you feel like when they're done we had a cat with hey God healed two cats in the last six months for whatever reason brother Brooks I don't know but the one cat came off but one time he's kind of a he's kind of a straight time cat now I just got does his thing gonna come over your food every now and then right all right what cause no he's all beaten and he look like a dog I'll hold on mouth there's or something just destroyed his mouth and then he just looked horrible she said what should we do I said well let's let's put him in the mudroom a little trying to nurse him back to health all right so we put him in there and you know anyway we started we start nursing them up well baby's like hey that's all right looks all right and I was out working in the garage they come back in the house I seen that cat laying there just kind of kind of this mangy bad bad looking creature some of that's our normal opinion perhaps but that cat I walk through and I seen that cat laying there and son just moved my heart I said you want I'm gonna pray again for this cat so when I laid my hands on I said Lord Lord I know you have a will for this cat so there's no reason why you brought it back so lord you must have a desire to do something for this cat I said I I mean I said Lord it looks like that but I know you're a healer I prayed on the cat I said that's in the name of Jesus Christ Lord by the blood I pray in [Laughter] it's go God is pray for this thing I say God I pray for the snake so of course like a normal cat would do to further the suffering to the individual it rain to our porch and start bleeding all over a bush so I said God I prayed for that I don't know I don't know what's going on here but Lord it's in your hands so within like 10 minutes of course kids ain't gonna sit there bet it when he left on the porch come out right away it's a great I don't know should I pray for it and so two days went by like well maybe kids will find it out in the yard I don't know what's going on sure enough that cat comes walking back up to the house when I was at work it's completely better said God you were testing me by how will I know if I will be done but his stripes are so I'm so amazing that bloodshed promise of God it might not look like it'll work but stay right there [Applause] cuz just the way it is we pray for something like oh go to God that cats gonna climb up a wall and do backflips of the obedient yeah it ain't gonna happen amen and what God in this season he will break the plan I had to hold on cuz I couldn't damage I had to hold on I prayed for we got to believe that we're anointed remember remember how your prophet talked about Moses he said let there be flash he said that was the actual thought of God lower to God don't put Moses on a pedestal your child of God he'll move through you amen but what that blood was shed and it provided what provided a cross that you could follow after that's right let's get to this present stage of my ministry one of our deacons here I don't know whether he's here tonight or not it's Tony's Abel he's usually around here and he came to me and he said in here not long ago before he got he come over here he said he said I had a dream a funny dream he said I dreamed I was trying to find my way upwards towards heaven he said I seen a man coming with a black robe on and was reading a book and said I got to this man asked him which away to heaven and he said ask the man ahead of me and that was a pastor of a church that he had went to he went a little further he met another man he had up on a black robe and was singing solos going on and that was another pastor both them passes are personal friends of mine and he said and then fine man they said which way do I get up to the top of the Mount here he said look here said see standing way up there on the top that little bitty guy I said yes he said there stood a guy with a pair of overalls on wearing a little cowboy hat this is a drink someone sat down in Kentucky said talking about me down here they said that guy looks anything like but a preacher might look like a farmer or something but you know it looks it ain't looks today brother sister it no matter how you look at a you know sort of matters what you're looking at that is what you're following a bit and said that it was me standing up and he climbed up till he got to me and said I got him by the arm and led him on up till I got top the hill and there's a wilderness to go through and I said Tony I must leave you here and you must walk some of this by yourself he said brother branham what can I do from here all said I said come here Tony look down there you see them barefooted tracks with bloody I said that's what I followed all the way just stay on that that's the only thing I know to point to not to a creed or sensation of some sort but to those bloody footprints that leads to the Bible the blood of Jesus Christ amen comes all the way down to the seven churches now remember these messages are given they're inspired of God with a what a message pointing us to a storehouse for food for us to eat amen and God gives his deacon this dream hallelujah where he's going and trying to find the way to heaven amen he asks this pastor tells him ask that bastard a pointer what to the top of the mount I love it that's all the time when you see these missions a sign in time sir it's always on the top of a mountain a pyramid hallelujah and here watch here are the pictures made known and he says he says brother Branham all right I got you there's a real miss to go through it but I got you you don't love about this cuz even in the dream the Prophet says he says I can't go any farther from this it was not God's will to go any farther with the Prophet you understand what I'm saying understand hey we ain't kicking on best as we're doing like that when I called him up I'll call him a failure call him a false prophet it is a true vindicated message he looked at the point would say oh this prophet was so gifted he was so amazing so mighty but the only thing that that prophet did was take up a cross brothers Abel's bring realize he was walking by the same stance at the prophet prophet follow the bloody footprints of Christ off the bomb deikun takes the same not even realizing it and what follows those same prints up the [Applause] mountain Luna where you seeing the picture oh my don't you love that number how many times no prophet wanted to go off the sea they were husband he couldn't be a father he was a woman you tell your life we would not have made the sacrifice [Applause] do you and what promise said that settled it right there do you sell it for the pie will be done but thine be every steps orchestrated you think about how many times we try to get in the mind of God as far as we get inspired by our own fleshly lust our own fleshly thoughts and what we got to be careful because this is a path it's a very narrow path but I tell you brother sister you are not walking a path that has not been walked before by the scripture by the message of the hour you're only walking the same path that leads to Christ amen hallelujah so notice this so then it was God's will his intention Hey then watch in this dream he says okay let's go up the mountain and brother branham said I can't I'm not going for further than this isn't it amazing all these years at this message and look at what a mess it's in the path is simple follow Christ yes hallelujah it don't matter how much money you have how much money you don't have it doesn't matter how many buddies you've gotten how many buddies you don't got it doesn't matter if you're the preacher or the person sitting there not in those in the seats it does not matter and then hallelujah what matters is you realize that what that Christ is first love in your life and you're willing to do anything he tells you to do because brother's able is no different from each one of us amen hey you can listen you can listen to all these tapes and so forth and that is part of the building by the sister but there must be an area that you have with Christ himself hallelujah Christ is yes the anointing is on the messages amen but there was an anointing that is inside of you hallelujah that annoys they will speak just as loud later why because he has a determined will that he wants you to live out he has testimonies he wants you to live out him so he says how am I gonna make it he says see those bloody footprints I followed those two right here you follow those those will lead you through now notice this cuz then he said it's not a cream or a sensation you can't point to any of that notice I love this because you see Christ he is the water thou shalt not surely not it is thou shall surely die it might be so closer to see the Elector the possible but the bride cannot be to see what's gonna lead you through oh I hope you can look and say yeah I've been following some bloody footprints yeah oh there's a prophet their glory to God I've been following that prophet with that message all the way here my notice the wrestles bloody footprints they were leading to the Bible they were pointing to the revelation it would see you through amen on an intellectual ism yes stay with the simple one [Applause] Gleason's 524 hold on and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust all right so no now notice the whole picture you see in the word this is constant it runs right through it I love it because see there ain't no man that could put this together God put a perfect book for his bride that's why it all ties in so perfect what they've crucified the flesh with the affections in us if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let's come back it's not the natural chemistry of if we live in the spirit let us also walk in this Galatians 5:16 this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of see he never changed the idea that you walk with him you walk in his pack you follow after him sons of God are led by the Spirit of God oh I know hey we've been in it's been a desert condition for a long time brother sister or you keep your eyes open you always expect the supernatural always expect it honey I'll get you into the grace but I'll tell you brother sister go if God is alive he wants to show you he's alive yesterday he would be multiplying constantly [Music] I know there's a live was one year ago I paid this contractor I gave him a down payment to Restatement hold all cam he's right about $2,800 close and they came out and they did a horrible job on the first two days and I'm like I'm Donna I'm absolutely done because I have to strip this whole house it's done this is bad and oh how I wanted to be so angry you know this when you get rid golf yeah they sealed mold all up in my logs I'm sitting here and I told him I told him did they try to get a fast one on me I said yeah I called him I said you guys did exactly opposite of what we're supposed to do so I said I'll just do myself like okay said well he said I'll give you some of your money back so I appreciate that I said I'm how you spot the Lord on me I said I'm not here this is your guys it's not you I'm not here to destroy your name I'm not here destroy your business I trust that you'll look at the situation and that you'll make it right he said well that's my nephew another da I said I said come on out take pictures I got some yeah be good steward that's not my - God's money so you know what he did so he comes out when I'm not home they won't talk to me and then he writes me he said I'm not he said I'm Knight my guys did nothing wrong and he said you might get 200 bucks back so I spent a lot of time and a lot of money fixing that house that couldn't help but I told a couple guys at work I said I just got took coz months two months went by no money nothing I said said Lord officer I wrote him so I wrote homicide forgive you I love you and I'm keeping to my word so first guy and I just mentioned something the guy at work cuz I told him I was getting this done and the one guy used to be part of one of those bad biker gangs they said you just let me know this guy's address I'll take care of it I like he's like and he said no seriously I can make this happen I'm like you know I'm a pastor man it's like well at least tell me and tell me the name said no each on your name I said I told him by the word of my mouth that I'm not gonna ruin him or his reputation no matter what he does to me and he badgered me Oh everybody badgered me they said it's just guys me know ain't talking I ain't talking about it and I was tested to the wringer and who knows things could've been different I would have said something [Laughter] but I was so tested and in my in my frustration while sitting there spending all those hours cleaning my house and doing it right I said God you were doing this I know you did so literally I forgot about it let it go three four months is done said Lord it's your will soon yesterday I get home actually I went out to go get the mail I was reading home thank you rather me only I looking looking at mail like what's this that's a letter from that painting contractor so my oh yeah my wait so I get in the house open that's when I thought my right [Music] so I get in the house and he said I said I've had a lot of yellow letter he said I she said said hi he said I've had a lot of convictions in my prayers lately and this came to my mind he said I'm going to make this right he said I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you and he left me a big check in the mail and I got done with all that I said the first thought came up with me is when brother branham was thinking about those deers and three deers come walking up to him take him boy yeah but he stood by his word and God said well stand by my word and I I didn't care I left it go but I just stood by my word the devil is right there to tempt you on every step coz whether you believe it or not I know sometimes you say boy I don't want to make that commitment but sometimes that's that sweet boy's voice working on him you know [Music] what Prince we'll be walking this morning but God is a miracle worker job he's a great cop [Music] [Applause] there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit after the spirit everything after after what Prince are you walking it I'm walking in bloody footprints you think that's the easiest thing to do you're walking in this reproach and you're showing that what that was his sacrifice but you were making your sacrifice to walk the same way so he says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do it is in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of a sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit [Music] one more great mighty Conqueror man was refused from heaven the highways was closed there's no highways but where there was no highways he come to make one home on the first line was demons of doubt the next was prejudice the next was selfishness the earth was covered over with lines of demon power then sickness diseases but when he began to ascend up to heaven last night we had him coming out of hell with the keys of death and hell on his side this morning we're taking him up hallelujah when he rose he he was triumph and as he went up he broke every devil power that bolts over man he ascended on high gave gifts to man the gift of the holy spirit the mighty Conqueror he stands alone this morning and between him and every believer is the blessed old highway of holiness that the righteous shall walk on there's not a way of escape amen you're a child of God there is no way of escape what you lad in the preview the crowd they started to get out of lining so there's only one line cut down from glory he left the bloody footprints as he walked through the quarters of demon powers whoo and made a highway for us all the way through he sets on high this morning as the mighty Conqueror yeah so oh bloody footprints well you know just another servant don't you realize those bloody footprints cut the power of every demon that hell could ever provide it cut the power of Satan they cut the power of the devil's hand trying to get a victory over your life he is the same today amen hallelujah well brother cam I don't feel like I'm walking walk give your life to the Lord and look today's your day
