[0:32] and uh may lord bless this next year of
[0:33] your life praise god
[0:35] so thankful for each and every person
[0:37] and all the sacrifices made to to
[0:39] worship the lord and continue the
[0:41] kingdom of god on earth praise god we
[0:43] know there's a kingdom coming right
[0:44] there's a an unmovable kingdom coming
[0:46] but the bible says we are actually
[0:48] partakers of the spiritual kingdom now
[0:51] that cannot be moved
[0:53] that's one great lesson i learned from
[0:54] those two sermons i guess i heard i
[0:55] heard a sermon called a higher uh was a
[0:58] higher calling let me just look real
[1:00] quick i took notes on the sermons and
[1:02] everything
[1:03] the first church i heard a sermon called
[1:05] a higher
[1:07] what was it higher calling
[1:10] i'm sorry a higher purpose and then the
[1:12] second one was believers boot camp so
[1:14] like a military theme you know how they
[1:16] go to boot camp soldier goes to boot
[1:18] camp to learn how to obey and march and
[1:20] everything so i heard those two sermons
[1:22] this morning and uh i just i just was
[1:25] reminded of uh the grace of the holy
[1:27] spirit to us praise god and i'll just be
[1:29] honest you know i i really love being
[1:31] there you know i got to fellowship and
[1:32] hear a little bit of word word of the
[1:34] lord but church i can just tell that
[1:35] these people are not into the promised
[1:37] land yet they're still in boot camp
[1:40] right they're still coming out of they
[1:42] come out of egypt many of them but
[1:43] they're still in the wilderness right
[1:45] trying to get through trying to be
[1:46] sanctified trying trying to get through
[1:48] boot camp but church brother man says
[1:50] the message has come and we should be he
[1:52] said uh soldiers we should be uh
[1:55] hazarded soldiers uh experienced
[1:57] soldiers praise god that know how to
[1:59] handle the word of god
[2:00] praise god and that's why when i went
[2:02] there i don't hear any preaching about
[2:03] sin it's all blessings it's all
[2:04] blessings
[2:06] but see the just like joshua the church
[2:07] of living god when sins in there the
[2:09] holy spirit calls it out to remove it
[2:12] that the church can move on victorious
[2:14] in the name of the lord
[2:16] so thank the lord for that praise god
[2:17] we're blessed people today
[2:19] hallelujah so i thank the lord now let's
[2:21] look at this judah's land by lot
[2:24] now in chapter 14 here's the outline
[2:26] i've been i've been using a a software
[2:28] called e-sword some of you may have it
[2:30] and uh it's where you look up
[2:32] commentaries right like matthew henry
[2:33] these are preachers from the 1800s and
[2:36] john gill
[2:37] john wesley he's from the 1600s or 1700s
[2:40] rather you can look them up and so i'm
[2:42] just getting the outline from them so
[2:43] you can have an idea what this chapter
[2:45] is about if you remember chapter 13 i
[2:47] only preached on really the first two
[2:49] verses of it
[2:50] because the rest of it was details about
[2:52] all the land that the two and a half
[2:54] tribes were going to get on the east
[2:55] side of jordan and so to me when i read
[2:57] that i didn't feel any inspiration from
[2:59] the holy spirit on preaching that
[3:01] except maybe now it's coming to me maybe
[3:03] people that choose not to be born again
[3:05] and they choose a place to be a foolish
[3:06] virgin so i'll say like this let them
[3:08] have their choice if that's their choice
[3:10] see we ought to let them have their
[3:12] choice because god lets them have their
[3:13] choice but as for our us and our houses
[3:16] we ought to choose uh land inside the
[3:19] promised land praise god
[3:21] we ought to choose to go into the
[3:22] promised land and fight the real battles
[3:24] praise god
[3:26] yes we ought to fight the real battles
[3:27] by the grace of the lord that's what
[3:28] we've done
[3:29] so uh just kind of striking me now but
[3:32] in chapter 14
[3:35] in verses one to five we see the method
[3:37] of dividing the land by lot
[3:40] how is it done well verses one through
[3:42] five tell us how is the lot divided how
[3:44] do they know manasseh got that or
[3:47] ephraim got that in this case judah how
[3:50] do they know benjamin got that it was
[3:52] all done in a certain method and so we
[3:55] see that verses one to five and then six
[3:57] to twelve we see caleb's demand upon
[4:00] hebron
[4:01] it was through moses's promise
[4:04] right we all we're familiar with that
[4:06] give me my mountain praise god so we'll
[4:07] look at that a little bit here today
[4:09] lord willing and then the chapter ends
[4:11] by joshua granting him his request and
[4:15] lord willing we might even get into some
[4:16] of chapter 15 here we'll see i got some
[4:19] some scriptures prepared for chapter 15
[4:21] as well uh by the grace of god let me
[4:23] set a timer here because i need to
[4:24] conserve my strength i went back to work
[4:26] this week i got 18. beautiful little
[4:28] children running around most of them are
[4:29] really well behaved by the way you most
[4:30] of them most of them will listen to me
[4:32] right away but not all of them so i got
[4:34] to be on top of my mental game here
[4:37] no that was great it's a good start to
[4:38] the year and uh thankful for the grace
[4:41] of the lord
[4:42] so uh chapter 14 now verses one and
[4:48] two
[4:48] we read that for our text right and so
[4:50] we can see here we see method or the
[4:53] protocol for how the holy spirit is
[4:55] going to give out the land to god's
[4:57] priesthood
[4:58] remember this was the bible said it was
[4:59] a nation of priests
[5:01] it was a kingdom of priests unto god and
[5:04] the bible picks it up now of course we
[5:06] know levites were the main group we'll
[5:08] get to that as well levites were the
[5:10] main group of priests but god was
[5:12] actually longing for church he was
[5:14] longing for an entire body of people
[5:16] that would all be spiritual kings and
[5:18] priests unto him
[5:19] but we know most of them after the first
[5:21] generation started turning god down in
[5:24] fact most of them that left egypt wanted
[5:26] to go back to egypt
[5:28] right most of people that try to get
[5:30] saved or get baptized they fall away
[5:32] right we've all seen it right we've all
[5:34] seen
[5:34] just just like that day most of them
[5:36] fall back away but there were some elect
[5:38] believers there were some real believers
[5:41] strong in faith that were able to
[5:43] possess the promises they really loved
[5:45] god they really believed the prophet
[5:47] amen
[5:48] hallelujah oh yeah just so you know i
[5:50] got i bought all the books from 1963 and
[5:52] 1962 they're out there now so i bought i
[5:55] bought about 200 new books so i'm going
[5:56] to put them on the shelf there so you
[5:58] can take them home keep them or you can
[5:59] read them and bring them back like
[6:00] sister hua
[6:02] whatever you want to do i don't care you
[6:03] can keep them or just bring them back
[6:06] the thing to do is fill your mind with
[6:07] the word of god
[6:09] praise the lord
[6:10] and so uh
[6:12] and so we pick it up here and uh they're
[6:15] trying to divide it now and joshua has a
[6:17] certain method by the holy spirit leads
[6:19] him
[6:20] how to give out portions of land what is
[6:23] their inheritance now i'm getting back
[6:25] to my thought now in church in the new
[6:26] testament we are all spiritual kings and
[6:29] priests unto god
[6:31] male or female see sisters god does
[6:34] something special in the new testament
[6:35] he lets you be a priest spiritually
[6:39] praise god amen the prayers of sisters
[6:42] are equally powerful before god
[6:45] now the only reason a man's prayer would
[6:47] be greater because he has a gift to pray
[6:49] for that special need
[6:51] right that's why they would they would
[6:52] really want to go to brother ram he had
[6:54] a gift to pray remember there was a
[6:56] sister that prayed for the woman who had
[6:57] the sick baby god heard her prayer as
[7:00] well she was still an intercessor by
[7:02] prayer
[7:03] so what a blessing it is to be a new
[7:05] testament sister or brother we're all
[7:08] spiritual kings unto god we're all
[7:10] priests unto god amen
[7:12] we're all to make intercession
[7:15] for those in need by the power of god to
[7:18] jesus christ that means we might receive
[7:20] the blessings and the inheritances of
[7:22] our father
[7:24] amen
[7:25] and we'll get to that i think in chapter
[7:27] 15 and 16 we'll start looking at all
[7:29] these all these divisions in the land
[7:32] they're not as i said they're not all
[7:33] cookie cutters
[7:34] and neither are all the gifts cookie
[7:36] cutters
[7:38] right because sisters now
[7:40] sisters now can prophesy
[7:44] sisters can get a vote give a word of
[7:46] wisdom
[7:48] sisters can give a word of knowledge
[7:52] sisters can cast out devils
[7:55] right most of that was kind of looked
[7:56] down upon you know previously maybe to
[7:58] the new testament
[8:00] sisters were just they were lesser value
[8:02] right they could marry numerous wives
[8:04] men can marry your newest wives just
[8:06] lesser value now god still used some of
[8:08] them but here in the new testament jesus
[8:10] christ opens it up and he allows sisters
[8:12] to be spiritual priests as well praise
[8:15] god amen talk about mercy amen talk
[8:18] about grace amen to redeem sinners like
[8:21] us praise god male and female praise god
[8:24] but we're thankful here for the grace of
[8:25] the lord now uh i want you to notice
[8:27] here
[8:28] notice the inheritance or possession it
[8:31] only comes after
[8:33] consistent fighting and victory
[8:37] now historians say it either took them
[8:39] five to seven years to drive out 31
[8:43] kings
[8:45] i'm not asking you to do to be a demon
[8:48] stomper the first year you get here
[8:50] praise god church now you might be
[8:53] i'm not asking to cast out devils even
[8:55] the second or third year or something
[8:56] like that
[8:58] what i'm i'm looking to see what i want
[9:00] to see in my life is spiritual growth
[9:03] praise god
[9:04] i want to see uh people that find the
[9:07] land that god's called them to amen
[9:10] and so they know what they can do by the
[9:13] leading of the holy ghost
[9:15] they know the gifts in their lives and
[9:16] if now this gets a little more advanced
[9:18] you know the gifts but then you also
[9:20] know brother braham said god may use you
[9:22] for a gift that may not be your gift he
[9:24] just may use you for it one time and
[9:26] then never use you again with that gift
[9:28] now that's real maturity
[9:30] because now you realize well god maybe
[9:32] have healed through my life maybe he's
[9:34] given a a a prophecy through my life but
[9:36] god but see you want to be so mature
[9:39] that you can say god speak a tongue
[9:40] through me speak a word of wisdom for me
[9:42] you can do a miracle through me even
[9:44] though you've never done it before i'm
[9:46] not going to limit you because if i'm
[9:48] under your anointing then i'm a soldier
[9:50] i'm a conqueror in jesus name
[9:53] he can call me for a special job
[9:56] praise the lord because i have this a
[9:58] special mission for the soldiers
[10:00] hallelujah
[10:02] five to seven years
[10:05] they finally drop they're just fighting
[10:07] constant fighting all the time five to
[10:09] seven years and then finally give me a
[10:12] place where i can rest
[10:14] lord i want a place just to rest on a
[10:18] place i can call home raise my family
[10:21] now see our natural and spiritual eyes
[10:22] are blended together
[10:24] praise god we don't just get to stop
[10:25] battling now we just get to live you
[10:27] know
[10:27] it's it's combined together praise god
[10:31] but uh as you know there will be seasons
[10:33] of rest in our lives praise god
[10:36] and there's going to be seasons of more
[10:38] harsh battles
[10:39] but we have to understand that god
[10:41] doesn't give them their possession right
[10:44] away they've got to fight for a few
[10:46] years
[10:47] they've got to drive they've got to
[10:48] really get some victories over some
[10:50] giants they got to prove to god that
[10:53] they really believe the word of god
[10:55] because last time we looked at and shown
[10:57] how joshua fulfilled all the plan for
[11:00] his life but other israelis didn't
[11:03] and so that those many of the israelis
[11:05] many of the tribes didn't drive out all
[11:08] the sins they should have driven out so
[11:09] they didn't inherit all the promises but
[11:12] joshua did because joshua was a faithful
[11:15] servant praise god he was a type of
[11:17] jesus amen i said this is a type of the
[11:19] holy ghost praise god hallelujah because
[11:22] he did the bible said he wholly followed
[11:26] the will of god there wasn't one thing
[11:28] that joshua left out yes he made
[11:30] mistakes but when god forgave him he was
[11:32] always ready to come back into
[11:34] fellowship and say yes lord i'm putting
[11:36] this behind me now what's my next
[11:38] mission
[11:40] what's what's my next uh what's my uh my
[11:42] next victory praise god lead me by the
[11:45] holy spirit i want to know what you want
[11:47] me to do and i want to go forward in
[11:50] your name
[11:51] hallelujah
[11:53] thank god
[11:56] see remember chapter 12 lists all those
[11:58] 31 kings and that shows you god
[12:01] god the days of those demons in your
[12:03] lives they're numbered
[12:06] you might have battled depression for
[12:08] years but listen church depression's
[12:10] name that demon his days are numbered
[12:13] amen
[12:14] you just hang around this church for a
[12:16] few years praise god god's going to
[12:17] deliver you praise god he's going to set
[12:20] you free you've just got to keep
[12:21] fighting you just got to keep possessing
[12:23] the land speaking the word believing the
[12:26] promises and god will drive out every
[12:28] one of those spiritual wickedness in
[12:30] high places amen amen he'll drive
[12:33] everyone out but you got to be dedicated
[12:35] you got to be consistent praise god
[12:37] you've got to be obedient to the word of
[12:39] god and after a few years or so god
[12:41] drives them all out praise god
[12:44] amen
[12:46] last time i was
[12:47] i think i'll just share it now
[12:50] remember i told you how to complex last
[12:51] last week so i emailed the brother
[12:55] the preacher
[12:56] and i found out for all these 16 years
[12:59] the preacher wasn't calling me a giant
[13:03] he was calling my pastor the giant now
[13:06] still that still associates me i'm a
[13:09] minister under a giant like a goliath
[13:11] that still like associates me i'm under
[13:13] goliath
[13:15] and he said oh i'm so hurt you thought
[13:17] that well i thought well for i'm sorry
[13:20] so i just apologized
[13:22] but i said but still when you call my
[13:24] pastor
[13:25] a giant that associates me as a giant
[13:29] but i feel so much better now because
[13:30] that holy spirit last week with brother
[13:32] randy's preaching brought that out and i
[13:34] knew i had to make that right and now i
[13:35] feel so much more clear praise god
[13:38] now it's in the balls in his court now
[13:39] to kind of talk about anything future
[13:41] but i said i'm sorry i i'm sorry i
[13:44] thought that i said i had fear
[13:46] but now fear has been cast out praise
[13:48] god
[13:49] amen praise god
[13:51] so see church we're to live free
[13:53] from any hindrance right the bible said
[13:55] all spiritual blessing let's say all
[13:57] ready
[13:59] all spiritual blessings are ours in
[14:01] christ jesus if we have enough faith to
[14:03] obtain it
[14:05] amen
[14:07] just want to give you an update on that
[14:08] certain starting to feel better by god's
[14:10] grace i always felt good but starting to
[14:12] get all the things from the past cleaned
[14:13] out by the grace of the lord
[14:17] now look here uh
[14:19] this scripture just kind of came to my
[14:20] heart when i was studying yesterday paul
[14:22] says my beloved brethren be steadfast
[14:25] unmovable which is firmly persistent
[14:28] always abounding in the work of the lord
[14:30] now that means increasing in the work of
[14:32] the lord
[14:33] he says for as much as you know that
[14:35] your labor is not in vain
[14:38] right so israel needed five to seven
[14:41] years to drive out 31 kings they're laid
[14:44] their fighting wasn't in vain
[14:49] right they could now for those five
[14:50] years they could have said when are we
[14:51] ever going to get our land when am i
[14:53] going to get my house i was promised
[14:54] when am i going to get all this when am
[14:55] i going to get the blessings we're not
[14:56] going to get my answers but god was
[14:58] saying fight first
[15:00] fight first praise god
[15:02] fight first
[15:04] battle first the blessing will come but
[15:06] i want you to learn how to fight amen
[15:09] the rest will come the inheritance will
[15:11] come the possessions will come but i
[15:14] want you to fight first i want you to be
[15:16] steadfast
[15:17] i want you to be unmovable
[15:20] i don't want anyone to be able to shake
[15:22] you i want you to be strong in the word
[15:24] of the lord praise god in the power of
[15:26] his mind hallelujah
[15:28] i want you to be like that and then
[15:30] after fighting and laboring and pressing
[15:33] then after all that you'll possess the
[15:35] promise
[15:37] i'm going to share our good testimony a
[15:38] little bit here by god's grace not my
[15:40] personal testimony but when i heard
[15:41] yesterday from sheffield uh from brother
[15:44] uh richard sanchez you might remember
[15:45] him brother he's a deacon up in
[15:46] sheffield
[15:48] beautiful testimony i'll share that a
[15:49] little bit as it kind of ties in but see
[15:52] the bible paul tells us we've got to
[15:54] battle
[15:55] we cannot stop fighting we've got to
[15:58] keep fighting praise god victory is
[16:00] ahead i say that on wednesday right
[16:02] victory ahead victory ahead through the
[16:04] blood of jesus victories ahead
[16:07] it is praise god we we we're promised
[16:10] that we're guaranteed it amen if we just
[16:12] keep fighting we just keep praying keep
[16:14] confessing sin and keep serving the lord
[16:17] god is going to bring all his promises
[16:19] to pass god cannot fail
[16:23] but he wants to see us fight and labor
[16:26] he wants to see us be devoted dedicated
[16:28] hallelujah
[16:30] on the battlefield praise god
[16:36] it reminded me of this
[16:38] beloved we're persuaded better things of
[16:40] you
[16:40] better things than what in the previous
[16:42] verses one through eight paul is talking
[16:45] about
[16:46] he said there are some that are
[16:47] enlightened by the spirit of god that is
[16:49] tasted the good word of god he said but
[16:51] then they they live contrary to it he
[16:54] said they become thorns and briars
[16:57] they they drink of the holy spirit but
[16:59] then they live ungodly lives it's the
[17:01] workers of iniquity right they get under
[17:03] the anointing they pump up the music
[17:05] they feel the spirit of god miracles
[17:07] happen but then they go out and they
[17:08] live their dirty little lives i can do
[17:10] this i can get away with that i can
[17:12] steal this i can do this i can sleep
[17:13] around i can do whatever i want right i
[17:15] can i can murder i can they can do
[17:17] whatever they want
[17:18] that's what they're talking about but
[17:20] paul says we're persuaded better things
[17:22] of you
[17:24] amen we're not going to let the
[17:26] anointing be in vain
[17:28] we're going to let the anointing empower
[17:30] our lives for a complete life of service
[17:33] to christ
[17:35] praise god i'm not a temporary message
[17:37] believer i am a permanent everyday sold
[17:41] out holy ghost filled saying praise god
[17:43] that ought to be your confession it
[17:45] ought to be my confession i'm in this
[17:47] for the end i'm steadfast i'm unmovable
[17:50] i'm always about it we're always
[17:52] abounding in the work of the lord praise
[17:54] god
[17:55] hallelujah
[17:57] yes i fall short yeah but i get right
[17:59] back to work and praise god
[18:02] i just got to get back to work and
[18:03] praise god eventually i get there by the
[18:05] grace of the lord
[18:08] but see they choose to live a life of
[18:10] iniquity
[18:11] right a life the word is lawlessness a
[18:14] life of lawlessness
[18:16] yet they knew the word of god they knew
[18:18] how to get the anointing but they never
[18:20] let the anointing seep down into their
[18:21] souls
[18:23] to change their nature
[18:25] now
[18:27] so far away so see they fell away those
[18:29] thorns those briars those wheat those
[18:32] weeds those tares right
[18:34] and things that accompany salvation
[18:36] though we thus speak for god church he's
[18:38] un not unrighteous to forget your work
[18:41] and labor of love
[18:43] god did not forget about you
[18:46] hallelujah god has not forgot about you
[18:50] can i say it like this it's impossible
[18:52] for him to forget
[18:54] you and i forget we let things go years
[18:56] and years we'll forget months and months
[18:58] i'll forget days and days we forget all
[18:59] the time but god is not gonna forget all
[19:02] those good things you did to glorify his
[19:04] name amen
[19:06] he won't forget that
[19:08] he knows he's aware of it he sees it but
[19:11] he's trying to mold your character to be
[19:13] more like his
[19:15] if he gave you everything right away
[19:17] you'd be a spoiled brat
[19:20] like some of the students at my school
[19:24] i used to be right as a sinner a spoiled
[19:27] brat i gotta have it now i gotta have it
[19:28] now okay lord i gotta have it now god i
[19:30] don't want you to act like that god
[19:32] wants you to be patient and just trust
[19:33] the promise
[19:35] hallelujah
[19:36] i'm persuaded better things of you
[19:40] see anything you show towards his name
[19:42] any work you do for god's name he's not
[19:45] going to forget it
[19:46] read it we might as well read it let's
[19:48] go to malachi
[19:49] i believe it's chapter 2 if i'm not
[19:50] mistaken i wasn't planning on preaching
[19:51] this but sometimes i feel out of the
[19:53] holy spirit to do things like that
[19:56] i think it's at the end of chapter two
[20:04] if anybody finds it let me know the book
[20:06] of remembrance
[20:10] let me look up my phone here
[20:23] all right i can't find it so let me look
[20:24] up in my
[20:25] bible app here
[20:30] anybody see it yet
[20:38] maokai 316 there it is sorry
[20:40] thanks for your patience
[20:42] malachi 3 16. i couldn't find it
[20:46] oh yeah there it is
[20:47] oh my goodness gracious looking right
[20:49] around it instead of looking right at it
[20:51] verse 16 then they that feared the lord
[20:54] how many fear of the lord today that's
[20:55] why you're in his house
[20:57] if you didn't fear the lord you wouldn't
[20:58] be in his house because judgment begins
[21:00] at the house of god
[21:02] they speak often to
[21:05] one another
[21:06] see church when we talk we make sure we
[21:08] got to talk about the lord too
[21:10] praise god
[21:12] yeah i like talking about the weather
[21:14] i'm talking about jobs that's a way to
[21:16] kind of get it started but then we want
[21:18] to talk about the lord praise god
[21:20] see when we fear the lord that's all we
[21:23] think about is the lord
[21:24] so it's on our minds it's on our tongues
[21:27] as we got to keep talking about the lord
[21:28] right he says and the lord hearkened and
[21:32] heard it and a book of remembrance was
[21:34] written before him so remember jesus
[21:36] said the book of life was written before
[21:39] the foundation of the world that's right
[21:40] that's for salvation right in the lamb's
[21:42] book of life also but here's a book
[21:45] that's written in real time brother amen
[21:48] i didn't hear you praise god it's before
[21:50] the lord and the bible said for them
[21:52] that feared his name and that thought
[21:54] upon his name amen
[21:57] so in other words the angels my brother
[21:58] said the angels are writing down your
[22:00] requests right now praise god
[22:03] oh we ought to be thankful church when
[22:05] you meditate on the lord and you talk
[22:06] about the lord the lord hears that he
[22:08] doesn't forget that he'll remember that
[22:11] and he'll answer a new season amen
[22:14] be encouraged be faithful hallelujah be
[22:16] like god amen
[22:19] hallelujah
[22:22] i look like a maniac compared to those
[22:24] preachers i heard this morning but
[22:25] that's okay
[22:27] i was just kind of laughing to myself
[22:28] like what would they think if i got up
[22:29] there and preached
[22:32] they'd say here's the door preacher they
[22:34] wouldn't encourage me they would compel
[22:35] me by grabbing me to leave the pulpit
[22:38] that's all right though let's see now
[22:40] see that and that you minister to the
[22:42] saints and new ministers so see church
[22:45] when we love god we have to service
[22:48] people
[22:49] if you're not serving in the body then
[22:52] you need to start doing that because you
[22:54] can't love god without loving the people
[22:56] he created
[22:58] hallelujah
[23:00] so let that be a desire that's that
[23:02] might be part of your land can i say it
[23:03] like that that might be what you're
[23:04] going to grow into that's what you're
[23:06] going to fight for praise god
[23:08] amen
[23:10] and you might already be doing it but uh
[23:12] ministering to the body of christ that's
[23:14] our job
[23:16] and we desire every one of you show the
[23:18] same diligence to the full assurance of
[23:20] hope to them see we got to be diligent
[23:21] we got to be faithful we got to be
[23:23] consecrated we got to be on time every
[23:25] time praise god hallelujah we got to be
[23:28] about the father's business all the time
[23:30] praise god
[23:31] diligent
[23:34] because we have a full assurance that
[23:35] you be not slaughtered this is what we
[23:37] got to battle mainly in america right
[23:39] because other countries are persecuted
[23:40] they won't be thoughtful because they're
[23:42] constantly under battles right now
[23:44] physical battles but we have it so easy
[23:46] in america well we don't know for how
[23:48] long but we haven't so easy in america
[23:50] we get lazy but paul says don't be lazy
[23:54] he says always abound in the things of
[23:56] the lord find somebody to minister to
[23:59] praise god
[24:01] minister to someone praise god
[24:05] sibo
[24:06] and then we we follow
[24:09] uh we followers of them who through
[24:10] faith and patience inherit the promise
[24:12] think of somebody who's inherited lots
[24:14] of promises in the bible like brother
[24:16] branham or other people that you might
[24:18] know and respect
[24:19] the bible said follow their faith watch
[24:22] how they live their life
[24:23] if god's answering a lot of their
[24:24] prayers many times it's because they're
[24:27] doing this they're diligent to obey the
[24:29] word of god
[24:31] praise god they're diligent to minister
[24:34] so paul says find people that are
[24:35] diligently uh following the promise of
[24:38] god follow their lives
[24:42] and model yourself after them not the
[24:44] briers from verses one through eight
[24:46] don't follow them
[24:47] let the anointing be a permanent
[24:49] anointing let it be an everyday
[24:51] christian praise god
[24:52] be not slaughterful but
[24:54] followers of them who through faith and
[24:56] patience inherit the promises
[25:00] but remember god's watching you and he's
[25:02] having those angels write down that book
[25:04] of remembrance
[25:05] praise god so when you give or when
[25:07] someone when you do something nobody
[25:08] else saw it you could say well i know
[25:10] jesus saw it
[25:11] and i know he wrote it down amen when i
[25:14] witnessed that person when i prayed for
[25:15] that person and nobody else saw i know
[25:17] he saw it because when i was talking
[25:19] about him when i was thinking about him
[25:21] but the heaven recorded it praise god
[25:27] that's malachi 3 16 if that was under
[25:29] the blood of bulls and goats what's he
[25:31] doing under the blood of christ right
[25:33] remember church the bible said we have
[25:35] better can we say better
[25:37] you said all nice and better we have
[25:39] better promises that if that was a a
[25:42] great promise we've got a better one
[25:44] praise god amen
[25:46] we're got a better covenant with better
[25:49] promises amen
[25:51] hallelujah
[25:52] that's why brother ram the holy spirit
[25:54] told him a huge portion of heaven awaits
[25:56] you
[25:58] i remember he he admitted it one time
[26:01] i think it was december 26 1963 church
[26:04] order sermon
[26:06] they asked brother brown how do we
[26:07] handle poor people that come in brother
[26:09] bam said just you got to ask him and
[26:10] make sure
[26:12] you got to ask and make sure they're not
[26:13] lying to you
[26:14] but he says he said you can go look at
[26:16] the books he kind of lets this slip out
[26:19] he said you can look at the books down
[26:20] there at the church i've given away 20
[26:22] 000 just to anybody that would ask
[26:25] that those are probably his ties right
[26:27] probably his ties
[26:30] twenty thousand
[26:31] and he said he said the minister would
[26:33] tell me his name said he needs a new set
[26:34] of tires i just gave it to him he said
[26:36] but then i go search in the in the
[26:38] directory and i call the church and no
[26:40] there's no preacher by that name there
[26:43] but the holy spirit said there's a huge
[26:45] portion
[26:46] awaiting you in heaven amen praise god
[26:49] amen
[26:50] see the jesus said you got to let
[26:52] yourself be defrauded sometimes
[26:55] right
[26:56] you pray for those who despitefully use
[26:58] you praise god
[27:00] and a huge portion awaits that man
[27:02] because remember church it is not how
[27:04] much you give
[27:07] it is not how big your church is thank
[27:09] god for that
[27:11] it is the widow woman proved it when she
[27:13] gave him two mites two-fifths of a penny
[27:17] jesus said she gave more than all the
[27:19] hundreds or thousands of dollars of the
[27:22] pharisees it's the amount of what you
[27:24] have that's what counts in the sight of
[27:26] god amen
[27:28] it's not how much you give as far as
[27:30] compared to that brother or that sister
[27:32] or that millionaire it's how much
[27:33] percentage did you give of what you had
[27:36] amen
[27:37] oh that's how you get a huge abortion in
[27:39] heaven
[27:40] brother brown was no millionaire
[27:41] hallelujah but he gave a huge portion of
[27:44] what he had in church we can do the same
[27:46] and expect the same blessings hallelujah
[27:49] jesus christ said that himself she gave
[27:52] more than what they did
[27:56] oh to me church
[27:58] that brings down the mountains and that
[28:00] raised up the valley brother amen that
[28:02] puts us on an equal
[28:04] role that puts us on an equal playing
[28:06] field praise god
[28:08] think about that by by love and grace we
[28:10] can out give the millionaire we can out
[28:13] give bill gates gives 2 billion whatever
[28:15] to education
[28:17] that's a small chunk change of what he's
[28:18] got
[28:19] but if we give more of our income which
[28:22] one will be greater sight of god those
[28:24] who gave a larger percentage oh why may
[28:27] god help us to store up treasures in
[28:29] heaven hallelujah
[28:31] glory
[28:32] that was going to be a whole separate
[28:33] sermon but i guess i have to save that
[28:35] one for later
[28:38] i was going to add that onto my sermon i
[28:40] preached with the 100 fold 60 fold 30
[28:42] fold from a few weeks ago
[28:44] i was going to add that on there
[28:47] i was going to add this on there too
[28:48] sisters can get a hundred-fold because
[28:50] they are married to the preacher
[28:54] right if the apostle gets a hundred fold
[28:56] jesus said that to peter
[28:58] that means peter's wife gets the same
[29:01] reward
[29:02] because the bible says in peter p first
[29:04] peter 3 that husbands and wives are
[29:06] joint heirs of the grace of life
[29:10] so i was wrong on that one i excluded
[29:12] all the sisters but see how the holy
[29:13] spirit corrects me
[29:15] i thank the lord for that praise god
[29:18] yeah the the missionaries wives
[29:21] get a hundred fold so i think occasion i
[29:22] think acacia brought that to my
[29:24] attention so god bless you acacia
[29:26] see that's that that's that good
[29:27] discernment of the holy spirit right
[29:28] there
[29:29] thank you hon
[29:31] maybe that was a word of knowledge
[29:34] hallelujah praise hey i'm thankful we
[29:36] got the gifts of the holy spirit here we
[29:37] just got to wait for god's timing and
[29:39] we've got to be conscious but they're
[29:41] here they're in our lives the bible said
[29:43] the gifts are given to every man to
[29:45] profit with all each one of you have a
[29:47] gift now let's be dedicated let's see
[29:49] what god does amen
[29:53] oh hallelujah
[29:56] well i'm off my notes a little bit but
[29:58] praise the lord i'm on god's notes
[30:00] though that's right i left my notes i
[30:01] went to god's notes
[30:06] so notice here from joshua fourth i'm
[30:08] still trying to get through verses one
[30:09] to two this is how it was like with that
[30:10] philippians series yeah
[30:12] the prophet priests and heads of the
[30:14] fathers of the tribes made distribution
[30:16] of the land so there's three groups
[30:17] making distribution right
[30:19] three groups work
[30:20] together prophet priests and elders did
[30:24] you notice that
[30:26] now that three team that three group
[30:28] team
[30:29] was god's way then it's still that way
[30:31] today
[30:33] right
[30:35] and this may help us in the future too
[30:37] as far as with placing us in our
[30:39] spiritual land
[30:40] now don't get me wrong god could come
[30:42] down and tell you you have this gift you
[30:44] have that do that ministry that ministry
[30:45] that's true that could happen
[30:47] but remember paul laid his hands on
[30:49] timothy
[30:50] and said don't forget the prophecy that
[30:52] went before you with the hands of the
[30:54] presbyters
[30:56] right
[30:59] so what i'm saying is that
[31:02] god always uses a prophet
[31:05] priests
[31:06] and elders to give people insight about
[31:10] the land they're supposed to possess
[31:13] glory
[31:14] we saw that with moses and air now moses
[31:17] type of christ right
[31:19] aaron a type of the priesthood
[31:21] aaron and four sons make the fivefold
[31:23] ministry what a beautiful perfect type
[31:25] praise god the fivefold ministry goes
[31:28] into the holy place goes in the holiest
[31:30] of holies right and ministers for the
[31:32] people praise god right but now we know
[31:34] i just said we're all kings and priests
[31:36] amen we can all go behind the veil
[31:38] praise god back the bale's red praise
[31:40] god
[31:41] i need your bills read we can all go
[31:43] into the ark of the covenant the prince
[31:45] of god if we want to amen amen
[31:48] glory of hell's thorn
[31:51] hallelujah
[31:53] so first at moses and aaron prophet
[31:55] priest
[31:56] joshua eleazar prophet priest
[31:59] nathan and zadok in the days of david
[32:03] who anointed solomon nathan and zadok
[32:06] prophet priests
[32:08] they had to have both there plus the
[32:09] elders they had them there i just read
[32:10] it yesterday first kings one
[32:12] they had them there
[32:15] amen
[32:17] and then we have haggai and joshua
[32:20] i didn't study far enough to find the
[32:21] elders on that one but and then jeremiah
[32:23] and zephaniah
[32:26] god always has these now church this is
[32:28] important because for us brother
[32:30] branham's not here but we got his word
[32:32] stored and we can listen to those words
[32:35] amen
[32:36] and we know what he would have said if
[32:38] he was here
[32:40] because he said it while he was here
[32:42] right just just different people
[32:44] same truth same teaching just different
[32:47] people praise god
[32:49] but all but they're all bought by the
[32:51] blood of jesus
[32:53] now notice the prophet provided listen
[32:55] current divine
[32:57] communication that's what the prophet
[32:59] was for to give you something current
[33:02] that god could speak to you right there
[33:04] brother man told us about russia thus
[33:06] saith the lord the purple curtain thus
[33:07] saith the lord
[33:09] right
[33:12] i mean he told us the one i was thinking
[33:14] about was the woman with the high heels
[33:16] on the three works of grace he said you
[33:18] can't walk that
[33:19] wearing those high heels she's like i'll
[33:21] tell you i can do whatever i want to do
[33:23] that shows you've got the dominating
[33:24] spirit on her and she fell off in
[33:26] sanctification
[33:28] and all these message churches with
[33:29] these sisters with these high heels on
[33:31] they think they're born again impossible
[33:34] because that's what the vision said from
[33:36] god's divine communication
[33:39] hallelujah praise god exalting
[33:40] themselves up like that to be seen what
[33:42] are they trying to exalt themselves up
[33:44] for the bible says god
[33:46] god humbles those that exalt themselves
[33:48] amen the bible said humble yourselves in
[33:50] the sight of the lord and he'll exalt
[33:52] you amen
[33:54] somebody asked me a few weeks ago on the
[33:56] email said how high should the heel go i
[33:58] said as low as you can go
[34:01] as long as you can go i mean what do you
[34:03] think
[34:05] what do you want me to say like
[34:06] three
[34:08] three millimeters or what i mean what do
[34:09] you want to say as low as you can go
[34:11] don't exalt yourself
[34:13] right humble yourself
[34:15] even i got even i got rid of my i had
[34:17] some high heel shoes it was
[34:19] i didn't know better i just
[34:21] the shoes they were really narrow shoes
[34:22] my wife showed me don't wear narrow
[34:23] shoes i wonder why my feet were hurting
[34:25] all those years because my
[34:27] my toes were all squeezed in there and
[34:29] then i had a huge thick heel i'm like
[34:30] why did i buy these that's right because
[34:32] they were at target and they're on sale
[34:33] that's why i bought them
[34:35] fool
[34:38] i'm not a fool but i felt like a fool
[34:40] afterwards
[34:41] my feet hurt so bad
[34:43] but uh
[34:44] see i understand no limits and things
[34:46] like that but the wisdom of god should
[34:48] teach you if god sends divine
[34:50] communication and shows a woman in heels
[34:54] falls off a sanctification then i'll do
[34:56] everything i can to convince my family
[34:59] and my daughters and my church don't
[35:01] even wear them praise god
[35:03] you're going to fall off
[35:06] because that's divine communication for
[35:08] our day
[35:09] hallelujah
[35:13] well you can take a chance if you want
[35:15] but it's between you and god but i've
[35:17] got prophet proof to prove that
[35:19] i've got divine communication praise god
[35:22] with thus saith the lord
[35:23] i think that was brother brahman's mom
[35:24] that had that prayer all right i'm sorry
[35:26] they had that dream that's right my
[35:27] man's mom had that dream brother man
[35:29] said look that's just my message exactly
[35:31] three steps justification sanctification
[35:33] baptism of the holy ghost
[35:36] now the priest church provided faithful
[35:38] teaching of god's past and preserved
[35:42] communication
[35:43] so prophet was
[35:44] divine current things
[35:47] and of course the prophet would
[35:48] interpret the word too but the priest
[35:49] had to be under the anointing to keep
[35:52] the preserved word
[35:54] to teach the preserved word that
[35:55] everybody knew the priests had to remind
[35:58] them
[35:59] of the word
[36:02] and then the elders had all the wisdom
[36:04] from experience of living 40 50 60 70
[36:07] years 80 90 100
[36:09] those days 120 150 whatever
[36:12] so you had wisdom of the ancients right
[36:14] of the elders you had divine
[36:16] communication i saw a vision i saw a
[36:18] dream
[36:19] though the holy spirit spoke they'll say
[36:21] the word of me and you had the man who
[36:22] just studied the word all the time to
[36:24] make sure they all agree praise god
[36:27] hallelujah
[36:29] now they are also recognized in
[36:30] jeremiah's day jeremiah 18 18.
[36:34] come let us devise devices against
[36:36] jeremiah this is this is the church in
[36:38] that can you imagine a church in that
[36:40] day against us
[36:41] come let's devise something against
[36:43] bride of christ fellowship that's what
[36:44] the devils do
[36:46] right but jeremiah had the physical
[36:48] people right devising things against him
[36:50] the preachers and prophets
[36:52] for the law shall not perish from the
[36:53] priest nor counsel from the wise nor the
[36:56] word from the prophet
[37:00] come let us smite him with the tongue
[37:01] let us not give heed to any of his words
[37:04] that's what they want to do they want to
[37:06] just all forget about brother branham
[37:08] well you know i'll do the i'll do the
[37:10] water baptism thing but
[37:12] i don't want to hear all that stuff
[37:13] about sanctification
[37:15] i don't want to hear all that other
[37:16] stuff no we need all of it praise god
[37:18] we need the prophet the priesthood and
[37:20] we need the elders amen
[37:22] amen
[37:24] see but sin always would get in after a
[37:26] while right maybe the next second
[37:28] generation third generation
[37:30] in the under the old testament of course
[37:32] also in the church ages
[37:34] and the bible said they've aired through
[37:36] wine and strong drink they're out of the
[37:38] way the priest and the prophet aired
[37:40] through strong drink they're swallowed
[37:41] up a wine they're out of the way through
[37:43] strong drink they air in vision they
[37:45] stumble in judgment
[37:47] see so false prophets they just can't
[37:49] see as clearly they can't hear us
[37:51] clearly and teachers you know they
[37:53] stumble they make you stumble by their
[37:55] teachings
[38:01] and this is how god gives people their
[38:05] inheritance on earth
[38:08] prophet priest elders
[38:11] hallelujah
[38:14] now was in the new testament as well you
[38:16] better believe us new testament
[38:19] and church i thought we're supposed to
[38:20] go back to the faith of the fathers
[38:22] right
[38:23] how do we want to go back to the faith
[38:24] of the fathers we're really close amen
[38:27] we are really really close praise god we
[38:29] need some more power need some more
[38:30] prayer but we're really close praise god
[38:32] amen i believe that's all my heart we're
[38:35] really really close praise god we're
[38:36] growing in it week after week month
[38:38] after month year after year oh can't you
[38:41] see the bright light shine amen it's
[38:43] just getting brighter the more we
[38:45] approach the coming of the lord amen
[38:47] hallelujah
[38:49] absolutely right amen
[38:51] so paul barnabas
[38:53] no small dissension about this
[38:55] circumcision mandate
[38:57] now we've got a vaccine mandate but
[38:58] that's not in the church well it's
[38:59] probably going to come to the churches
[39:02] mercy
[39:04] they determine paul and barnabas and
[39:05] certain of them should go up to
[39:06] jerusalem unto the apostles and elders
[39:09] about this question
[39:12] oh so paul's a prophet barnabas was a
[39:14] prophet the prophets and elders come
[39:16] together
[39:18] hallelujah praise god and they figure
[39:20] out the situation
[39:22] see church you know in our life it might
[39:24] look like this
[39:26] you know as a preacher i'm not a prophet
[39:28] so if there's a problem in the church
[39:30] you bring your problem to me i'll pray
[39:31] about it i'll seek the word then i'll go
[39:33] ask the prophet
[39:35] i ask brother
[39:37] i look to his tapes right i can't talk
[39:38] to a dead person right but i asked the
[39:39] holy spirit lord direct me in the
[39:41] prophet's message that would help
[39:42] somebody
[39:44] right and then i might reach out to a
[39:46] local elder or someone in the church
[39:47] that's the elder
[39:49] or someone in another church that's the
[39:50] elder to try to get wisdom have you ever
[39:52] handled this before
[39:54] the church has happened numerous times
[39:56] numerous times
[39:58] and these three go together to make
[40:02] a very powerful team for jesus
[40:05] we got the prophet the priests and the
[40:08] elders you've got an invincible army
[40:11] hallelujah praise god
[40:14] so much so that peter tried to step
[40:15] right peter got the wrong idea so what
[40:17] god did he sent a prophet in there
[40:19] paul
[40:20] and then they all agree with paul right
[40:22] peter repents get out the segregation
[40:24] get that all out
[40:26] that's what we need today we need we
[40:27] need men and women anointed by the holy
[40:29] ghost today
[40:30] that know what they're called to do
[40:33] that know that they have a spiritual
[40:35] office to fulfill and they're going to
[40:37] be faithful with that office
[40:43] brother ram taught the same unity of the
[40:44] prophet and the bride church
[40:48] revelation 22 17 the spirit and the
[40:49] bride say come let's all say come ready
[40:51] come see it proves you're the bride
[40:53] you're saying come that's what the holy
[40:55] spirit's saying come to the message
[40:57] that's what i'm saying
[40:58] that's what i'm telling my friends in
[40:59] the churches
[41:00] come to the mystery of god it's finished
[41:02] praise god there's no more questions
[41:04] praise god it's finished
[41:06] we know god's plan we know what was
[41:08] written in heaven we know what the
[41:10] symbols represent and now we're flying
[41:12] with eagle anointing praise god and we
[41:14] will fly out of here before that pale
[41:16] horse rider rides across america amen
[41:20] hallelujah praise god we'll fly out of
[41:22] here amen and meet our savior in the air
[41:25] papa eagle amen
[41:27] hallelujah
[41:28] we're saying come
[41:32] and all that the father has given me all
[41:34] my little baby eagles will come to me
[41:37] oh thank god amen
[41:40] whosoever will i don't care what the
[41:42] church is one of these weeks i'm going
[41:43] to a catholic church brother i'm going
[41:44] to sit in that church and i'm going to
[41:45] sit there and pray for those people
[41:48] i don't care presbyterian i'm going lord
[41:50] willing jehovah's witness mormon i'll do
[41:52] whatever i've got to do seven-day menace
[41:54] i'm not afraid of them
[41:56] i fear god more than i fear them
[41:59] amen and they did somebody deserves a
[42:01] chance at least to hear it
[42:02] and church listen i'm going to the
[42:04] pastor so they're the watchman right
[42:06] if the watchmen don't warn the people
[42:08] who's who's who uh who's the punishment
[42:11] on the watchman's hands
[42:13] right that's just what paul did too
[42:17] now just so you know that pastor today
[42:18] he asked me before he preached
[42:21] he come up give me a hug he said man you
[42:22] made me cry i haven't seen you for years
[42:25] i said praise the lord pastor paul he
[42:27] said do you want to speak and say
[42:29] something to the church
[42:31] and i was like for that split second i
[42:32] was like
[42:32] [Music]
[42:34] i better not
[42:36] like
[42:38] i knew i had to leave pretty soon
[42:40] but i'm hoping lord willing in the
[42:42] future
[42:44] i'll be able to find the leader more
[42:46] courage of the holy spirit
[42:49] to preach basically revelation 10 7. but
[42:51] then later he did bring me the mic or
[42:53] his son brought me the mic afterwards
[42:54] and i just said a blessing over the
[42:55] church i just said follow your pastor
[42:58] he'll be if he's got the holy spirit
[43:00] he'll be guided to all truth
[43:02] and that's true for sanctification
[43:04] right that's true
[43:05] if he's really got the spirit for saying
[43:07] vacation
[43:08] they'll he'll lead him into all truth
[43:10] but see i'm pointing them apostolic to
[43:12] their pastor
[43:13] i'm not a prosthetic
[43:16] right
[43:17] what's something that's kind of clever
[43:19] with that i'm not a proselyte i'm a
[43:23] paulite
[43:24] that's the best i could do so forgive me
[43:27] paul went in the synagogues every
[43:29] sabbath and he's the bible said he sat
[43:31] down and right this morning he just sat
[43:32] down and waited for somebody to come up
[43:34] and that's what i did i sat down and
[43:35] they just brought me the mic
[43:37] and i was just going to keep waiting to
[43:38] do that by the grace of god
[43:40] because we have been given this great
[43:43] invitation amen to invite them and say
[43:45] come and drink of the waters of life
[43:48] freely amen
[43:50] don't you want someone to drink of the
[43:51] water you drink of
[43:53] if you drink the right water you do if
[43:55] you drink the wrong water no wonder you
[43:57] don't want people to drink of that ah
[43:59] but i'm drinking fresh water
[44:01] there's no wiggle tails in it it's fresh
[44:04] it's life-giving and sometimes it
[44:06] bubbles over amen it's joy unspeakable
[44:09] full of glory amen
[44:11] i want everybody to drink it brother
[44:13] amen
[44:14] i i want everybody to taste to get a
[44:16] taste of this brother bang it's
[44:18] delicious it's life-giving amen
[44:21] it set me free
[44:24] and set the captive free
[44:26] they deserve a chance to drink it too
[44:31] thank god at this moment the age is not
[44:33] over see people in this message say the
[44:35] age is over
[44:40] they are so deceived
[44:43] he is yet crying and his cry is not only
[44:45] the spiritual ears of men by his spirit
[44:47] but once again a prophet is in the land
[44:50] now that's if that's joseph
[44:52] that was 1963 he was only about seven
[44:54] years old or eight years old
[44:56] that can't be joseph that was brother
[44:57] branham i've had people tell me this is
[44:59] joseph
[45:00] impossible he wasn't prophesying
[45:02] anything
[45:03] he wasn't preaching or praying for
[45:04] anybody this was brother branham how do
[45:06] you believe that
[45:08] right
[45:08] once more god will reveal the truth as
[45:10] he did to paul in the days of the
[45:12] seventh messenger the days of the
[45:13] liturgy and age its messenger will
[45:15] reveal the mysteries of god as revealed
[45:19] to paul
[45:21] see that makes me happy because i wrote
[45:23] a book about it right
[45:24] he will speak out and those who receive
[45:26] that prophet in his own name will
[45:28] receive the benefit effect of that
[45:30] prophet's ministry
[45:33] oh thank god all the healings that came
[45:35] out of brother man's ministry all the
[45:37] power miracles we inherit those
[45:39] blessings today praise god
[45:45] he will speak out and those who receive
[45:46] that problem yes and they he they that

[48:44] jesse and the bride of christ fellowship
[48:46] are still living hey amen hallelujah
[48:48] praise god or as long as the next
[48:50] generation if i go off the scene

[48:53] bride number here the voice is crying
[48:56] come back to the word come over my
[48:58] people come drink of waters of life
[49:03] and that's the bride talking

[49:07] it's the bride talking when we speak and
[49:09] say come to church it's the bride's
[49:11] invitation
[49:13] imagine a woman dressed up in a
[49:15] bridesmail all in that white garment in
[49:17] all the veil and she comes up and say
[49:18] you're invited to the wedding
[49:21] that's the bride talking you got an
[49:23] invitation from the bride herself hey
[49:26] thank you lord amen the bride invited me
[49:29] and i'm in attendance amen
[49:34] and they might not have saw it today but
[49:35] when i walked in those two churches
[49:37] i was walking in there and all white
[49:40] bride member
[49:42] saying hey leave this note for the
[49:43] pastor if he wants to come to the
[49:45] wedding he can come to the wedding make
[49:47] sure he gets this wedding invitation
[49:50] hallelujah praise god make sure he gets
[49:52] it they might not have seen it brother
[49:54] amen but in there i was walking there as
[49:56] a white bride
[49:57] saying come
[49:59] come know that the mysteries of god are
[50:01] finished
[50:06] it's a privileged church
[50:07] it's a privilege to serve the lord jesus
[50:09] christ
[50:10] one thing we do know it won't be long
[50:12] for this is the last stage
[50:16] in every age we have exactly the same
[50:18] pattern
[50:19] this prophet priesthood elders
[50:22] that's why the light comes through some
[50:24] god-given messenger in a certain area
[50:28] god chose jeffersonville indiana or
[50:30] another or i should say like this god
[50:32] chose united states of america
[50:35] the most prosperous nation
[50:37] in the whole world to raise up a profit
[50:40] out of the nation that had the best
[50:41] technology the most freedom to copy
[50:44] books and translate
[50:46] and the
[50:47] greatest nation as far as those
[50:49] blessings god had chose a certain area
[50:52] because he knew he could get the word
[50:54] out faster
[50:55] from america
[50:58] see how wise he is
[51:00] that doesn't make us any special just
[51:01] makes us that's where we were
[51:03] that's god's predestination
[51:05] and from that messenger there spreads
[51:07] the light through the
[51:09] tape playing of others no
[51:11] ministries others who've been faithfully
[51:13] taught
[51:14] i know i'm hammering hard on jefferson i
[51:16] don't know why i'm doing that today i
[51:17] wasn't planning on doing that
[51:19] but of course all those who go out don't
[51:21] always learn how necessary it is to
[51:22] speak only with the messenger spoken
[51:25] when it comes to the word
[51:27] right because we can't say 1977 the
[51:29] world's going to end in 1977 we can't
[51:30] say that
[51:33] what he means you got to have wisdom is
[51:35] understand he means all that's in the
[51:36] word
[51:37] if you read the previous paragraph
[51:39] but see people can't do that when
[51:41] they're deceived of a devil
[51:43] right they can't catch that because
[51:45] they're deceived they just
[51:47] understand what they want to understand
[51:50] paul says it too and these things that
[51:51] thou has heard of me among many
[51:53] witnesses the same commit thou to
[51:54] faithful men
[51:56] oh man
[51:58] who shall be able to teach others also
[52:02] give it to men give it to faithful men
[52:04] share the message with faithful men and
[52:06] then they can teach others
[52:09] that's the pattern i'm giving my
[52:11] revelation to one man one star in a
[52:13] special area and then that man will
[52:16] teach other men and that man will go
[52:18] teach other men and then god is like
[52:19] he's like that little wave in a puddle
[52:21] right a little rock and a puddle the
[52:23] wave goes out and the message spreads
[52:25] out and out and out so ever to the end
[52:27] of the waters praise god hallelujah
[52:29] church where one of those waves amen
[52:31] hallelujah brother brahms pebble dropped
[52:34] there and now we're one of those echoing
[52:36] waves we're taking it farther than he
[52:38] could go praise god that's god's plan
[52:40] amen
[52:42] i'm a part of that plan brother william
[52:46] i'm doing my part my little wave until
[52:48] the next wave
[52:49] and maybe one of these waves will be the
[52:50] wave of the last trump praise god the
[52:53] wave of of of death swallowed up in life
[52:56] amen the wave of the rapture praise god
[52:59] really come another wave over us amen
[53:02] hallelujah
[53:05] oh yeah i believe a one-man message
[53:06] that's what they all say brother the
[53:08] jeffersonville people oh one man message
[53:09] i know
[53:10] but then after the one man it goes to
[53:12] many men
[53:13] a one-man message means that's where it
[53:15] starts not where it finishes they're
[53:17] saying it just finishes did you know
[53:19] jeffersonville put out
[53:21] here i am on this again they put out a
[53:23] website or they put a blog post last
[53:25] week that said brother branham all the
[53:27] fivefold ministries in brother branham
[53:29] there's no need
[53:31] no there's no need to go anywhere else
[53:33] or listen to anybody else they said he's
[53:35] our prophet pastor and they use all
[53:36] these quotes but they forgot to use the
[53:38] quote where brother brahm said i won't
[53:40] always be your pastor
[53:41] and they forgot to use this quote
[53:42] brother they asked him are you the only
[53:44] one that should preach and he said no he
[53:46] said we need more preachers
[53:48] he said i'm just one little pebble on
[53:50] the beach among many big stones i don't
[53:53] know who those big stones are
[53:55] i think brother bam is one of those big
[53:56] stones
[53:57] i think he's being humble that's my
[53:59] opinion i'm one of those little stones
[54:00] where's god right other churches they're
[54:03] little stones
[54:05] but see they like they take the quotes
[54:07] they what and they just ignore the ones
[54:08] they don't but we take them all praise
[54:10] god rightly divide them by the holy
[54:12] spirit that's exactly right
[54:15] see it starts as a one-man message but
[54:17] then it becomes a many-man message
[54:19] because men jesus said you go and you
[54:22] pray to all nations amen
[54:24] you go make disciples of every nation
[54:26] hallelujah
[54:28] it starts with one then it spreads to
[54:30] others and that's thus saith the word
[54:33] so you know it's right how many believe
[54:34] that's right
[54:36] now birth pains by
[54:38] talking about bringing the message back
[54:40] to the people
[54:41] and i'm just going to i'm going to skip
[54:43] a little this he's talking about how
[54:44] there's there's basically two vines
[54:45] there's two systems there's the the
[54:47] system of promise and there's a system
[54:49] of man-made ability right jacob and esau
[54:52] right
[54:55] he talks about how luther was the right
[54:56] with jacob but then all the people that
[54:58] denominated after him were like the esau
[55:00] group right in other words brother man
[55:01] talks about two vines right the good
[55:02] seed and the bad seed
[55:04] and then brother i was trying to explain
[55:06] this and he said these men if they pick
[55:07] this up and go out with it can make more
[55:10] sense to it see them bring it to a place
[55:12] you would i just want to lay the seed
[55:14] and then they hope they make it come to
[55:16] life
[55:18] brother is talking about preachers he's
[55:20] hoping that the seeds he's planted in
[55:22] the message will grow and the preachers
[55:24] will be able to study more preach more
[55:27] faithfully learn those and go take it
[55:29] and go finish the great commission
[55:31] that's what's happening today i'm happy
[55:33] to announce that there's life in the
[55:36] world today and we are living on that
[55:38] life amen
[55:40] hallelujah
[55:42] it's there for anybody who wants it
[55:46] got your bible got your church age book
[55:47] seal book got some of my books got a lot
[55:49] of good books out there they're gonna
[55:51] it's brought more to life praise god
[55:53] like i always told everybody that church
[55:55] age book is the greatest book i've ever
[55:56] read outside the bible
[55:59] i know people that say they don't like
[56:00] it well i think it's their loss it's
[56:02] just their loss
[56:03] that that book has had so many truths
[56:05] it's changed my life
[56:07] it's taught me how to better serve it's
[56:10] taught me the history of the church it's
[56:11] taught me all the qualifications from
[56:13] preachers and because i've kept some of
[56:14] those qualifications from preachers it's
[56:16] kept people out of this pulpit that
[56:18] shouldn't be should not have been here
[56:20] so that's why i thank the lord for that
[56:21] book too
[56:23] it's protected us
[56:24] more wisdom more insight and it also
[56:27] gave us the vision of our church
[56:28] the latter rain
[56:30] right
[56:31] where we will be full of wine full of
[56:34] corn
[56:35] and my people shall never be ashamed
[56:39] my people will rejoice and be glad
[56:42] praise god for all that god has done
[56:44] we'll have the wine the new one the
[56:46] former rain the latter raid will be the
[56:48] real army of god jesus once amen amen

[58:29] where there's no roads
[58:31] oh but god's got a road out there
[58:33] there's no roads for the the cars but

[58:41] brazil praise god
[58:43] those people out in the bush they're
[58:44] getting the holy ghost they're being
[58:46] buried in the name of jesus christ i'm
[58:48] glad to support missionaries like that
[58:50] and teachers like brother simon that can
[58:52] go down deep in the word and bring
[58:53] things out like the breach we've never
[58:54] heard before wasn't that beautiful
[58:57] that was tremendous
[58:58] that was beautiful
[59:01] god
[59:02] lord let them fill our shoes if time
[59:04] goes on
[59:05] now i'm trying to get to here we go now
[59:07] i'm finally done with verses one and two
[59:08] okay
[59:09] see that's that's the hard part about
[59:10] preaching every verse in the bible you
[59:12] know because
[59:13] it's eternal and so all these thoughts
[59:15] start breaking out right in this verse
[59:17] well i want to move on but
[59:19] it's kind of like i feel like i'm like a
[59:20] racehorse and they're like pull me back
[59:22] you know
[59:23] i want to i want to move on through the
[59:25] text but here we are give me a few more
[59:27] minutes by god's grace
[59:28] i'm just happy to be a christian today
[59:30] praise god
[59:31] verse three for moses had given the
[59:33] inheritance of two tribes and a half on
[59:35] the other side of jordan but unto
[59:36] levites he gave none inheritance
[59:40] among them now church this is there's
[59:41] some beautiful type in here maybe i
[59:43] don't have it you know
[59:44] fully but the levitical priesthood was
[59:47] denied physical property but instead
[59:49] inherited god's spiritual properties
[59:53] can you imagine that if you're a levite
[59:55] all those other brothers got to have
[59:56] lands hills mountains valleys ponds
[1:00:00] whatever
[1:00:02] but you just had like a little house
[1:00:05] in a city and you couldn't go for a walk
[1:00:07] on your land i like to have 100 acres
[1:00:10] wish i had 100 acres like brother caleb
[1:00:13] he probably had about 100 acres
[1:00:16] but the levites they were denied that
[1:00:22] the bible said the levites i'm going to
[1:00:24] separate you levites you priesthood i'm
[1:00:25] going to separate you
[1:00:27] away from land i don't want you focused
[1:00:29] on land
[1:00:30] aren't you focused on my house
[1:00:34] deuteronomy 18 says the priest the
[1:00:35] levites in the tribe believe i shall
[1:00:37] have no part nor inheritance with israel
[1:00:41] they shall eat the offerings of the lord
[1:00:43] made by fire
[1:00:44] and his inheritance
[1:00:47] what a special blessing
[1:00:49] therefore shall they have no inheritance
[1:00:51] among their brethren the lord is their
[1:00:54] inheritance as he has said unto them
[1:00:58] so throughout the week you know the
[1:00:59] levites would watch everybody else oh
[1:01:01] they go out for a vacation out on their
[1:01:03] land they cut down trees they build nice
[1:01:05] fences
[1:01:07] they say well i'll just stay in my hut
[1:01:08] and i'll just
[1:01:10] take care of my family here and
[1:01:14] but the but the bible said the lord said
[1:01:16] i'm gonna i'm gonna give you an
[1:01:17] inheritance
[1:01:19] i'm not gonna give you lands i'm not
[1:01:21] gonna give you hills or valleys i'm
[1:01:22] going to give you my food
[1:01:25] i'm going to give you fellowship with me
[1:01:29] which one would you rather have church
[1:01:31] mountains valleys hills or would you
[1:01:33] rather have fellowship
[1:01:35] and eat with the king hallelujah amen
[1:01:40] i'm all for a little bit of land
[1:01:42] but if i have the choice land or jesus
[1:01:45] it ain't even choice i'm taking jesus
[1:01:46] praise god
[1:01:48] that's fine lord i may not have means in
[1:01:50] here i mean i have lots of acres here i
[1:01:53] may not have cars and lands here or
[1:01:55] businesses here but one thing i've got

[1:02:00] the king's table amen

[1:03:41] that it's something i don't have

[1:03:45] is feasting with jesus
[1:03:48] being in his presence
[1:03:50] having his fellowship
[1:03:53] that's enough for me

[1:04:16] there's my hour i'm going to try to
[1:04:17] close here
[1:04:22] brother baby said how the congregation
[1:04:24] used to admire that high priest
[1:04:27] see church after a while
[1:04:29] the land didn't really mean much anymore
[1:04:31] right
[1:04:32] because brother they would set up idols
[1:04:33] on the land
[1:04:35] they'd bow down they'd build they plant
[1:04:38] groves and they sneak into the groves at
[1:04:39] night
[1:04:40] and they you know they sacrifice to the
[1:04:43] devils
[1:04:44] pretty soon they were just a lot of the
[1:04:46] israelites were backslid so what good is
[1:04:48] the land to them anyway
[1:04:50] brother ram said as time went on
[1:04:53] that high priest aaron and he said all
[1:04:55] the congregation admired that man
[1:04:58] he got the bells on everything's all set
[1:05:00] he'd get the incense
[1:05:03] and he leave that out oh i'm sorry he
[1:05:05] leave that he did the outer core right
[1:05:06] you take the blood in there with the in
[1:05:08] the in the charger brother said he
[1:05:10] passed beyond the veil and they all
[1:05:12] admire they all want to peek inside can
[1:05:13] you imagine all the children leaning
[1:05:15] over
[1:05:16] what's behind that veil i want to see
[1:05:18] the candlestick
[1:05:19] oh it's closed
[1:05:22] how the congregation admired that man
[1:05:24] see church when you live in the presence
[1:05:26] of god people admire you
[1:05:29] hallelujah because you're under the
[1:05:31] prince of god all the time
[1:05:34] they wish they could have the character
[1:05:35] that you have they wish they could have
[1:05:37] the peace that you have the victory that
[1:05:39] you have the strength that you have the
[1:05:42] courage that you have the power that you
[1:05:44] have they long they admire that that god
[1:05:47] help us to live under the anointing and
[1:05:49] live in the presence of christ
[1:05:53] they'll admire you church
[1:05:55] when you live in god's presence
[1:06:00] that's fine if i don't have millions i
[1:06:02] just want to be somebody that other
[1:06:04] people can admire and say that man lives
[1:06:06] close to god
[1:06:08] he's got a heart like jesus
[1:06:10] i see a lot of people that go to church
[1:06:12] but there's something about that brother
[1:06:13] he's
[1:06:14] he's different
[1:06:15] i admire how he just he stays under the
[1:06:17] anointing of the holy spirit how many
[1:06:19] want to live that kind of a life
[1:06:28] i love this this is beautiful
[1:06:30] praise god
[1:06:34] see we should rejoice church we get
[1:06:35] personal fellowship with christ
[1:06:37] it's only limited to a certain few few
[1:06:39] there be that find this the baptism the
[1:06:41] holy ghost we're talking about
[1:06:44] land physical things all these things
[1:06:47] don't mean nothing the preacher at the
[1:06:49] chapel this morning was saying
[1:06:50] uh
[1:06:52] he was sitting across the table from his
[1:06:54] friend he was a ceo he had gained
[1:06:55] millions of dollars he said he had all
[1:06:57] the cars he had all the houses
[1:07:00] all the clothes can you imagine that
[1:07:02] brother bang millionaire ceo
[1:07:05] and the the preacher was honest he's
[1:07:06] like wow how do i get there tell me your
[1:07:08] secret how you get there
[1:07:10] because you know he was just battling
[1:07:12] the flesh
[1:07:13] hopefully
[1:07:14] hopefully overcame
[1:07:17] but he said he let this man talk and he
[1:07:19] was ready to ask him how can i do that
[1:07:20] how can i get millions
[1:07:23] and the man said here i am old retired
[1:07:25] now he said what was it all for
[1:07:28] it was just a big waste what was that
[1:07:30] all for anyway
[1:07:32] can you imagine having millions of
[1:07:34] dollars
[1:07:34] getting whatever you want and you still
[1:07:36] and then you look back at the end of
[1:07:37] your life then your life would say what
[1:07:38] was all that about anyway
[1:07:41] can you imagine getting ready to go down
[1:07:42] to the grave and you didn't even know
[1:07:44] what your life was for church we are so
[1:07:46] blessed we can know what our lives are
[1:07:49] for our lives are to minister to people
[1:07:52] praise god
[1:07:54] our lives are to do the will of jesus
[1:07:56] christ not to serve ourselves but to
[1:07:59] serve others amen
[1:08:02] and we can go to the end of our lives
[1:08:04] and know i did exactly what jesus called
[1:08:06] me to do as a father i did this this
[1:08:08] like the bible said as a mother i did
[1:08:10] this this this i did this and this and
[1:08:12] this as a worker i did exactly what the
[1:08:14] bible said to me and i can't wait to see
[1:08:16] jesus he's going to say well done
[1:08:22] i thought that was quite a testimony
[1:08:24] what was it all for
[1:08:31] what are all these trials for
[1:08:33] they're to get a bride ready amen
[1:08:35] you might not seen it bro but amen but
[1:08:37] over the years god has been dressing you
[1:08:40] he's been dressing me brother bang he's
[1:08:42] been dressing us in the garments of a
[1:08:44] bride
[1:08:46] he's given us white garment saints
[1:08:50] he's washing away anything that
[1:08:52] displeases him he's just making our
[1:08:54] garments white because the bible said
[1:08:56] jesus washes us by the washing of the
[1:08:59] water of the word
[1:09:03] laundry day after laundry day brother
[1:09:06] william

[1:09:30] presented without spot without wrinkle
[1:09:33] and without blemish amen
[1:09:35] by the blood of the husband jesus
[1:09:45] these worldly things don't bring any
[1:09:47] happiness
[1:09:51] the happiest i am is like on set last
[1:09:53] saturday night when we have six people
[1:09:54] come up for prayer and i'm weeping and
[1:09:56] crying and saying god help bless them
[1:10:00] i can't think of any happier time in my
[1:10:01] life can you
[1:10:04] you know that's the happiest time i love
[1:10:05] my children i love my family too but i
[1:10:07] don't understand what i'm saying when
[1:10:08] god is moving and helping people
[1:10:10] convicting people strengthening people
[1:10:13] that ought to make us the happiest
[1:10:14] people on the face of the earth
[1:10:17] but if we're living selfishly we'll
[1:10:18] wonder what is all this for
[1:10:20] why did god give me this job so you can
[1:10:21] support a ministry
[1:10:24] right that's why god gave you a job so
[1:10:25] you can feed those children and train
[1:10:26] them up in the things of god
[1:10:28] you can sharpen those arrows i went to a
[1:10:30] group yesterday there's some message
[1:10:31] believers there you'd be surprised by
[1:10:33] how many people made fun of me because
[1:10:34] i'd eight kids message believers make
[1:10:36] fun of me and joke with me because i got
[1:10:37] eight kids and each time i just said
[1:10:39] we're so thankful for all of them i'm
[1:10:41] just sharpening them up and i said i'm
[1:10:42] getting ready to send my first 116. i'm
[1:10:44] getting ready to send her out to meet
[1:10:46] the enemy at the gates
[1:10:48] when she's 18.

[1:10:53] it kind of you know shakes him up
[1:10:55] cause i'm not i'm not ashamed of my
[1:10:57] arrows i'm thankful for my arrows i'm
[1:10:59] glad my quiver's not empty i'm glad it's
[1:11:01] full
[1:11:02] i don't know that way i can do something
[1:11:04] for god
[1:11:06] satan's the one who has a bow but no
[1:11:09] arrows amen
[1:11:11] but we the bride of christ have a bow
[1:11:13] and arrows amen plus we got a sword
[1:11:17] and a shield and the of god thank
[1:11:20] god we're soldiers for jesus amen
[1:11:23] but they can mock me and laugh all they
[1:11:24] want that's fine they did the same to
[1:11:26] jesus

[1:11:30] i know what i got i got some sharp
[1:11:32] arrows

[1:11:49] and then they got their dad chopping
[1:11:51] with that sword three times a week at
[1:11:52] him
[1:11:56] slice it and try three times a week you
[1:11:58] probably get some pretty good kids after
[1:11:59] that
[1:12:00] as long as you live the life at home
[1:12:02] right keep keep all the sin out of your
[1:12:04] house

[1:12:06] spirit so give all the credit to the
[1:12:07] wife my wife who's led by the holy
[1:12:09] spirit
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:16] now brother brother man says when you go
[1:12:17] in the holy spirit of holies
[1:12:18] he says
[1:12:20] you're hid away and your whole motive is
[1:12:22] to serve jesus christ
[1:12:24] i'm here to do what jesus christ wants
[1:12:26] me to do
[1:12:28] i will only be moved by him brother
[1:12:30] william amen
[1:12:32] because he's my general
[1:12:34] right he's the one i report to sir
[1:12:37] in prayer every day
[1:12:39] help me lord
[1:12:42] he's who i report to
[1:12:45] the holy spirit is being born again
[1:12:47] that's the place where god reveals his
[1:12:48] secret things
[1:12:50] that's the place where god does the
[1:12:52] placing
[1:12:54] and the calling
[1:12:55] see church if we're really born again
[1:12:57] we're going to fight some battles as
[1:12:58] chapter as verse 1 showed but after a
[1:13:01] while after a lot of victories then
[1:13:02] you've got to be placed
[1:13:04] you've got to know your position in
[1:13:06] christ
[1:13:07] we need to know that and i'm going to be
[1:13:09] getting into more into that just very
[1:13:10] simple as i preached before but
[1:13:12] hopefully go a little bit deeper by the
[1:13:13] grace of god show the different
[1:13:15] varieties of sisters right the different
[1:13:16] ministry sister can have the different
[1:13:18] ministries brothers can have
[1:13:23] verses six to eight
[1:13:26] is that right okay
[1:13:30] 40 years old
[1:13:32] was i when moses servant of the lord
[1:13:34] sent me from kadesh barney a despis okay
[1:13:36] now we're on caleb spout the land and i
[1:13:39] brought him word again as it was in my
[1:13:40] heart nevertheless my brethren that went
[1:13:42] up with me made the heart of the people
[1:13:44] melt but i wholly followed the lord now
[1:13:46] look church god honors the words of his
[1:13:49] prophet
[1:13:50] here moses had died
[1:13:52] 45 years maybe earlier later
[1:13:55] and
[1:13:56] caleb still remembers thus saith the
[1:13:58] lord from the prophet
[1:14:00] oh i'm gonna that's me
[1:14:02] that's gonna be you praise god
[1:14:04] we're never gonna forget thus saith the
[1:14:07] lord to the bride from the prophet
[1:14:10] and here he's saying
[1:14:12] i'm 85 now
[1:14:14] i remember what moses said
[1:14:16] it was thus saith the lord
[1:14:20] see those who holy father lord they
[1:14:23] speak words of faith
[1:14:25] from their obedient hearts
[1:14:27] see that's why people can't speak the
[1:14:28] word they're not obeying the lord all
[1:14:30] the time we've got to obey the lord all
[1:14:32] the time
[1:14:33] and then we'll speak he said it jesus
[1:14:34] said if you abide in me and i abide in
[1:14:36] you he said then ask what you will
[1:14:40] so caleb was a bidding in the holy
[1:14:41] spirit remember he was justified
[1:14:43] sanctified you know
[1:14:45] never could never get the holy ghost
[1:14:46] because the jesus had not yet been
[1:14:48] crucified
[1:14:49] he's a sanctified believer who wholly
[1:14:51] followed the lord under the blood of
[1:14:53] bulls and goats
[1:14:57] verses 9 and 10 nine is the highlight
[1:14:59] moses and moses swear on that day saying
[1:15:01] surely this land where on thy feet of
[1:15:03] trial and shall be thine inheritance and
[1:15:04] thy children's forever because thou is
[1:15:06] holy father the lord my god
[1:15:08] remember church moses promised caleb he
[1:15:10] could have the land he spied out because
[1:15:13] of his obedience did you catch that
[1:15:16] caleb just wasn't one in any mountain
[1:15:19] caleb had been to that mountain before
[1:15:23] 45 years earlier
[1:15:26] hallelujah
[1:15:29] moses moses said you can have the land
[1:15:31] that you spied out
[1:15:35] little did caleb know he's gonna have to
[1:15:37] wait 45 years to get it
[1:15:39] but he still remembers see caleb's like
[1:15:41] mary he heard that word of moses and he
[1:15:44] kept that word down in his heart he
[1:15:46] pondered it he waited on the lord and he
[1:15:48] didn't get older he got strong
[1:15:50] he stayed just as strong praise god i
[1:15:52] shouldn't say stronger because he got
[1:15:53] the same strength
[1:15:55] he kept his strength all those 45 years
[1:15:58] and he said i want the land that i spied
[1:16:01] out 45 years ago that everybody was
[1:16:04] afraid of in other words i knew 45 years
[1:16:08] ago i could conquer that land but i had
[1:16:10] to wait till the rest of the church
[1:16:12] caught up with me
[1:16:14] and the church said
[1:16:16] is that right nobody else in the church
[1:16:17] except joshua believed it he said i've
[1:16:20] got to wait for the next generation to
[1:16:22] raise up my
[1:16:23] i got to wait till they can catch up
[1:16:25] with my revelation because i know we can
[1:16:28] do all things through christ who
[1:16:30] strengthens us
[1:16:32] the man said joshua and caleb we're
[1:16:34] looking at what god said they were
[1:16:35] looking at grasshoppers and giants but
[1:16:38] caleb and joshua were not looking at the
[1:16:40] giants they were looking at the unseen
[1:16:43] brother said they were looking it
[1:16:45] depends what you're looking at we must
[1:16:47] look at what god said
[1:16:50] look what god says about your problems
[1:16:53] look what god says about the giants in
[1:16:55] your life if we focus on that we'll be
[1:16:57] just like caleb one day we'll overcome
[1:16:59] that it may not be today but if we've
[1:17:02] got faith and we wholly follow the word
[1:17:03] of god we will overcome we will conquer
[1:17:06] and we will possess the land
[1:17:12] god kept him strong in order to fulfill
[1:17:14] moses's word god's going to keep
[1:17:16] somebody strong in order to be raptured
[1:17:18] by the william
[1:17:19] praise god
[1:17:20] god is going to keep somebody strong
[1:17:22] jesus said shall i find faith on the
[1:17:24] earth of course i'll find him the bride
[1:17:27] he's going to keep somebody full of
[1:17:28] faith on the earth until he comes let it
[1:17:31] be you
[1:17:32] let it be me praise god
[1:17:35] let it be me the one that i keep my fire
[1:17:37] and zeal brother amen you make sure
[1:17:38] brother for the van you if anybody would
[1:17:40] know would be brother banging my wife
[1:17:41] make sure i keep my zeal all the years
[1:17:44] as these years cycle in and out brother
[1:17:46] banging we start getting older and our
[1:17:48] teeth starts getting crooked like
[1:17:50] right here we start getting gray hairs
[1:17:52] as these cycles go through let's make
[1:17:54] sure we keep our strength and we keep
[1:17:56] our zeal and we're just as strong now as
[1:17:59] in 2001 or 2002 when we first heard this
[1:18:02] glorious message that god has given to
[1:18:04] us
[1:18:08] be unmovable be steadfast
[1:18:11] always abounding
[1:18:14] in the king slaying demon slang of the
[1:18:16] lord can i say it like that
[1:18:19] hallelujah
[1:18:23] so caleb was asking permission to drive
[1:18:25] out the giants
[1:18:26] the older generations feared
[1:18:29] yeah those giants the other guys were
[1:18:30] scared of i'll take those on
[1:18:33] who wants to take out those giants that
[1:18:34] they were scared of
[1:18:36] that's me i'll do it
[1:18:38] give it to me
[1:18:39] give me this mountain
[1:18:41] right bring on that denominational
[1:18:42] spirit
[1:18:44] hallelujah bring on that government
[1:18:46] squeeze
[1:18:47] who will take down these giants that
[1:18:49] everybody else is scared of somebody in
[1:18:51] here i believe will rise up and say give
[1:18:53] me my mountain amen
[1:18:56] give me the promises of god for me
[1:18:59] other people might have been scared but
[1:19:00] i'm not scared i've got the word of the
[1:19:03] lord i'm not looking at what i see i'm
[1:19:05] looking at the unseen
[1:19:09] remember anakins were giants the bible
[1:19:11] said
[1:19:12] they saw the giants the son of anak
[1:19:15] and caleb says i want the land of the
[1:19:17] anakins
[1:19:19] with the giants
[1:19:23] i'm with the rapture the other brothers
[1:19:25] didn't live to it
[1:19:26] the other brothers didn't live to the
[1:19:28] rapture but i want the rapture amen
[1:19:31] they didn't know how it could happen oh
[1:19:33] my god may god help us praise god
[1:19:37] they started denominations they died
[1:19:39] they they
[1:19:42] uh
[1:19:43] cold they went to seed the older
[1:19:45] generation missed the rapture but we can
[1:19:47] do it our bodies can be changed not by
[1:19:49] not by power not by might but by the
[1:19:51] holy ghost saith the lord
[1:19:54] how many believe that
[1:19:56] i'm trying to get a little farther
[1:19:57] because i wasn't going so slow
[1:19:59] so let me close to this
[1:20:02] yesterday we had some good fellowship
[1:20:04] oh yeah brother richard sanchez
[1:20:09] church caleb waited 45 years to get that
[1:20:11] promise
[1:20:13] how many know 45 is bigger than 25.
[1:20:15] anybody ever
[1:20:16] everybody understand that abraham waited
[1:20:18] 25 years
[1:20:20] to get his promise done
[1:20:22] caleb waited 45 years
[1:20:24] to get his promised land
[1:20:29] well what's the difference 25 what's the
[1:20:30] difference it's still a long time
[1:20:33] right but it don't matter as long as
[1:20:34] you've got the same kind of faith as
[1:20:35] abraham
[1:20:37] if you can wait 25 years church i just
[1:20:39] reckon you could wait 26.
[1:20:41] praise god
[1:20:43] if you can wait 45 years brother bang i
[1:20:44] just assume you can wait 46 years
[1:20:47] or 50 years
[1:20:50] because it's not about the time it's
[1:20:52] about the faith amen
[1:20:54] the time's not what in question
[1:20:56] it's the faith that's in question and
[1:20:58] church we have no faith of our own our
[1:21:00] faith is the faith of christ amen paul
[1:21:03] said i don't live by my faith he said
[1:21:05] but i live by the faith of the son of
[1:21:07] god amen
[1:21:09] i'm not believing with my faith i'm
[1:21:11] believing with jesus faith
[1:21:15] so the brother walked up to me yesterday
[1:21:16] and he said
[1:21:18] i was sharing about praying for people
[1:21:20] to be saved i was hearing about going
[1:21:21] out to churches
[1:21:22] and he said brother jeff i just want to
[1:21:24] encourage you keep praying
[1:21:25] he said my brother bill witnessed to our
[1:21:27] sister so he has a brother in the church
[1:21:30] and the sister who was in the church he
[1:21:31] said 45 years ago when we first heard
[1:21:33] the message he said we went to her we
[1:21:35] argue with her we slammed water baptism
[1:21:37] down her throat and said you better get
[1:21:39] saved the rapture is coming and she
[1:21:40] flatly turned them down
[1:21:42] he admitted they kind of did the wrong
[1:21:44] way
[1:21:46] he said but 45 years later last year
[1:21:48] during covid they came up to visit and
[1:21:50] stayed at their house
[1:21:52] and he said they were just in the
[1:21:53] kitchen
[1:21:54] hanging out now they're in their 60s
[1:21:56] late 60s if not 70s
[1:21:59] and he said he was over there cooking a
[1:22:00] meal for his sister i guess
[1:22:02] i said all of a sudden she starts
[1:22:03] talking about god
[1:22:05] and he said he said he
[1:22:08] shared a few things about just general
[1:22:09] things about god i'm here to pray for
[1:22:11] you he said he saw her crying
[1:22:15] so he said he walked over after 45 years
[1:22:18] he talked to his sister and said you
[1:22:20] know sister
[1:22:22] you need to come to god you need to
[1:22:23] repent and get right with god
[1:22:28] she said you're right i need to i'm
[1:22:29] finally ready to repent
[1:22:32] and he said uh there was there they went
[1:22:34] home they and you know kazukovic
[1:22:36] they come back and he said both he and
[1:22:38] his brother got to take her down into
[1:22:40] the waters of baptism
[1:22:42] and finally after 45 years bury her in
[1:22:45] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:22:47] now she's serving god now after 45
[1:22:51] years
[1:22:53] of waiting on god and i thought that's
[1:22:56] exactly how long caleb waited
[1:22:58] so i knew it was inspired
[1:23:00] because in the mouth of two or three
[1:23:01] witnesses let every word be established
[1:23:06] let's stand to our feet
[1:23:10] i'm sorry 35 years i'm sorry 35 yeah i'm
[1:23:11] sorry not 45 35.
[1:23:14] my fault
[1:23:16] 35 years later
[1:23:21] the faith was still strong
[1:23:25] it just had to wait and that's what the
[1:23:26] brother said it wasn't the season
[1:23:28] 35 years ago it wasn't the season for a
[1:23:30] giver she wasn't broken enough she
[1:23:32] wasn't low enough
[1:23:33] right sometimes the prodigal has to go
[1:23:35] down to the pig pen
[1:23:37] she'd just reach her pig pen in 2020 the
[1:23:39] year of coronavirus the chinese-made
[1:23:42] virus go ahead close it out you turn it
[1:23:44] off i might say some things here
[1:23:46] they're gonna hunt me down maybe anyway
[1:23:48] we'll see
