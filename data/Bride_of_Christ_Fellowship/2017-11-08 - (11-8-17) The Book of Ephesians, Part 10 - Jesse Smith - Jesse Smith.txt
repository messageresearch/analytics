studying the fusions serious kind of felt inspired to go there tonight visions 3 verse actually verse 9 sorry visions 3 9 seasons 3 9 by God's grace [Music] feegans 3 9 we're gonna start there I may finish the chapter tonight we'll see how it goes by God's grace but just working our way slowly through these epistles visions 3 verse 9 the Bible says in verse 9 and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus Lord let's read verse 12 together ready one two three in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him and we'll stop there like I said perhaps we'll get further but we may not if you have a need on your heart just make it unto God as we bow our heads surely God is able to meet every need here tonight so grateful for the needs and on Sunday that he met and as we prayed tonight just trusting God to minister to everyone those needs Heavenly

praise honor and glory in Jesus name in every said Amen god bless you sir [Music] okay so maokai you can switch over or Lydia got I got quite a few quotes I've imagined in scriptures want to go through these by the grace of the Lord so let's start with this thank you part 10 here and we our text wasn't all the way to 21 so I'm sorry I did think we believe we stopped at verse 12 but I was considering reading all the way to 21 but we'll just stop at 12 there I want to remind us why we're going through why I felt led if last year I started going through the book of Galatians and I want to just remind us of why where I feel led to go through these because the Prophet said we must preach what Paul preached and remember the story I read it a few weeks ago about brother I'm going around the curtain of time and he said does every leader out to be judged like this he said yes I said what about Paul he said I'll have to be judged by him with his so well his group goes in so a mine because I preach exactly the same word that's it I said where he baptized in Jesus name I did too I preached you know what other quotes he said the Holy Ghost and and no women preachers and long hair on women short hair all men we know there's different quotes like that and I like this and the millions screamed out all at once it said we're resting on that so church you and I are resting upon what Paul preached and so that's part of the reason why I felt led you know to start that series and I actually started that after been Narada to come and preach because he talked about how churches battle spirits and every Church battle is a different spirit you know and I briefly mentioned it you know when I when I think our church battles over the years you know and so I just you know I just want to bring out some of these I didn't have time to go through the scriptures but I've preached on these like the church at Galatia they battled legalism because they were trying to bring circumcision back into the New Testament so Paul Paul had to rebuke them for bringing legalism and in fact we listened to it on the way here I just played it on the on my phone and Paul said if you began in the Holy Ghost how can you be perfected by going back to the law you can't if you start in the Holy Ghost you got to keep going with the Holy Ghost again you don't go back to the law and remember legalism just means excessive adherence you know so it's too much so like in the case of circumcision that's no longer required that's too much and like today you know if we say oh you're long your sleeves have to be down to your wrist bone or whatever more like that's too much that's that's excessive you know or our men's hair can't be passed there their ear you know that they make it legalism we're you know we know Jesus maybe by history had a hair down his shoulders it's made it's possible but the thing was his hair was cut women have to have uncut hair but men have to have cut hair so we want to understand we want we must not be legal which means adding on to the Word of God the Pharisees were legal they added on to the word they said you gotta wash your hands and do all these extra things that was all excessive but Jesus never disobeyed one word he was fully obedient to the Word of God and so that's what we want to be we want to be fully obedient and we don't want anything excessive on top of the word we just want the Word of God okay now remember they also had the spirit of discrimination or segregation because Peter wouldn't eat with the Gentiles so they had to battle that spirit the spirit of discrimination or segregation like I'm better than you and you're just a little bit dirtier I'm just you know you're you're a pastor you're just too dirty you know you're not as holy as I am so II just can't eat together and fellowship and so that's what Peter had he had a wrong spirit on him and pawed to correct him so you see now can you see how that could happen today for example when the Saints on Sunday just last Sunday one of the Saints and I were talking after service and they said brother Jesse you just don't understand you know churches where I grew up you know they said it's all it's all segregated by money so the rich message believers won't talk to the poor message believers isn't that said that's a form of segregation in that set and all saying they got the Holy Ghost right well they may but they may not Peter had the Holy Ghost we know that but he got corrected by the word and so if we're wrong and if anyone says they got the Holy Ghost they're wrong if the word comes to them and they don't get corrected they probably don't have the Holy Ghost but if we're wrong and we get corrected that shows that might be good sign we have the Holy Ghost you get you understand so see every Church you know every Church struggles with some things you know brother man person if your church isn't being battled you're not a real church so I'm glad we get battled because a real church hallelujah now the church in Corinth battled sensual temptations remember that the man was sleeping with his stepmother remember that and the Bible Paul said you weren't even mourning about that so people the church was like huh that's okay they weren't even sad about it you know why cuz they were battling the two they battled that because spirits hang around churches right spirits are territorial they hang around that remember Paul said such were some of you some of you were whoremongers some of you were effeminate which means a child molester some of you were homosexual he said but you were sanctified and washed by the Spirit of God amen you see those spirits still hung around there and it calls this man here to sleep with his stepmother and so they battled that not only did they battle that they battled fanaticism remember hard to correct him and say you know you all want to speak in tongues he said but you can't do that the most three he said two at the most three see they they all wanted to have a partner they all wanted to get really and there's nothing wrong with speaking in tongues it's just got to be an order right it's good it's good it's good to be emotional I love God's emotions that he brings but they got to be in order by the Holy Spirit so see they have different battles the church at Thessalonica they battle lazyness pod to rebuke some of them and say if you don't work you don't eat remember that in the scripture you had to rebuke them a little lazy spear all the coming of Lord why should I work the company lawyers gonna be anytime run Jessie well then you then just eat on the trashcan then because you should only eat what you work for honey no that's the scripture if you know if a man don't provide for his own children he's worse than an infidel that's a spirit that a church battled right they battle that laziness well she's gonna come why should I even try why should I even get insurance or why should I even get car insurance you know but the Bible says obey the laws of the land respect those in authority so see what do you need you need a real wisdom of God you need a real discernment of spirit that's what we need today but ramps that's one of the greatest gifts today and the end time is to have discernment a spirit to discern the truth from air and then remember persecution in Chapter 1 they bat a lot of persecution I preached on that a few weeks ago in passing Paul said it was an evident token of their love for God so the fact that they had persecution showed was a real sign that they were real believers amen now we'll get to the ones in emphasis we haven't got there really because as we get back there we're kind of and I'm gonna skip ahead just a little bit here we're kind of in this second theme remember there's three themes member Scofield says there's three themes and there's three themes in emphasis they're exalted position the body of Christ both Jew and Gentile and then now warfare when we get to chapter four which may be Sunday or maybe next week or whatever the Lord if the Lord tarries then we're gonna start seeing what the church actually struggled with okay but right now in Ephesus we haven't really seen them Paul's just given us our position he showed how we're one body this mystery of the one body of Jew and Gentile let me go back so I can get on that again I remember this church started with twelve men being filled with the Holy Ghost that's what that's a great way to start a church amen huh but Paul was writing them from prison remember that that's chapter three four and six he was either incest Cerrito or Rome under house arrest or prison arrest and then Takai 'kiss carried the letter this letter of Ephesus Ephesians he carried the letter to the church and possibly the letter to the Colossians for Paul said to tychicus would make known all things about Paul's condition so it's likely that this man carried it and then the church received this letter from Paul who was in prison I'm sorry I must have repeated that yeah but they knew it was the scripture be just like Peter knew whatever Paul wrote with Scripture C they'd heard Paul's testing Jesus knocked him off his horse he went to Rabia for three years and then he didn't even see the apostles till 14 years so for 11 years then after three years in Arabia eleven more years he didn't even go to Jerusalem until no fourteen whole years so they'd all heard about his conversion they'd all knew he was commissioned by Christ to go to the Gentiles so they received his letters as Scripture a dispensation or a season of the gospel had been given to Paul from God all right now I don't know remember this I preached on this on the Ephesian Church age the brother BAM writes this he says repent quickly don't hesitate evidently Ephesus did not hesitate for her lifespan was not very long now this really helps me brother Adam this really helps me our church has lasted 11 years that shows me I've repented right because if we don't repent God will take this God will take the candlestick out of the out of the area so Ephesus wouldn't repent so after a few decades I think it was like 30 or 40 years the church was totally removed history shows that God took the the believers out God pulled him out because the people wouldn't repent see how it is important for everybody in the church to repent everyone in the church must repent or if they don't God said I will take the candlestick out of the land I'll take those are the Holy Ghost out and they can still have a church but be a dead church we don't want a dead church we want a living Church with living prayers and living the signs and wonders and we want Christ in our myths amen all the gifts of God hallelujah so see by a few decades later there wasn't even one Christian left that's why we must constantly repent and constantly be faithful to God now remember there's our three themes let's get in out of the message here let me set a little timer here by God's grace now the fellowship I love this when I just saw this thought it made me cry when I written when I studied this the one time it was such a blessing just you know about the Holy Ghost this is all about the Holy Ghost so you love the Holy Ghost huh it's eternal life if you got it then you got eternal life in you amen but that's what he's saying here the the fellowship or the another word is intimacy of the mystery intimacy that's what the word fellowship means so here's the word fellowship and the Greek it actually means intimacy its intercourse so like a husband and wife it's that type of intimacy the intimacy of the mystery it's a joint participation it's communion that's what communion is right right in two Sundays we have communion Lord willing that's what it is it's like having this communion it's like having this intimacy with Christ right Christ I'm eating your word and I'm drinking in your spirit I'm constantly doing that my life is cleaned out I'm gonna remember your death until you come back amen but I'm gonna take in your life the whole time how do they remember your death but we see more of your life all the time amen so Paul's preaching was to help believers see the intimacy of the hidden mystery of God that's what his preaching was for that's it let me read that here verse 8 and 9 verse say unto me Who am less than the least of All Saints remember less than the least so Paul makes himself the lowest of the Christians but we know he's one of the greatest in his eyes he's one the lowest but in God's eyes he's one of the greatest amen how humble he said is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what's the Fellowship of the mystery is that what you guys isn't that what we as believers desire we want all men to see the Fellowship of the mystery don't you I want all my friends to see the intimacy of the mystery of God which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I want all my friends to see that it's all about being born again hallelujah that's what Paul is saying I'm preaching and I'm trying to make all men see what is the intimacy of this mystery what is the the knowledge of this mystery it's Christ in you amen all right so we're gonna prove that now remember I kind of I just think I repeated this Paul would preach the unsearchable riches of Christ and would seek to make all men and see what the intimacy really was yeah God wants intimacy so deep that it goes to the soul of man the core vis being his very nature now remember let's go to the back to John here John 7:38 let's go back here especially for my children I want them to know this Oh children please pay attention maybe you can read for us here John 7:38 because I've shared this thought with my some of my friends that I do the Bible club with the older the older men that are about my age you know maybe the older I've shared this thought the scripture with them over and over and they're finally starting again after four years by that in four years I've been sharing these water baptism scriptures and now Holy Ghost scriptures and they're finally started to get it after four years which is encouraging to me you know I really I love seeing growth in people's lives so children could you read seven let's start with 37 malachi he read 37 38 okay now Lydia read verse 39 I want you to see this alright so what Jesus preaching about he's preaching about the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said drink of the waters come to me if you're thirsty come drink you'll have rivers of water flow audio what's that rivers of praise River is a worship that's right that's what happened the day of Pentecost they were saying the wonderful works of God all of the Messiah Christ is so wonderful hallelujah glory to God Jesus has risen from the dead they're declaring the wonderful works of God living waters are flowing out of their mouths how did he gets the bonus that goes along with being born again glory now remember this scripture says that people weren't born again yet but what did Luke say Luke said John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb right so how do we know how how do we how do we reconcile those well that just means John the Baptist had the Holy Ghost on his human spear and not on a soul because this picture shows it to us for like I said I'm kind of reviewing this mainly know for sister Connie and my children because I'm not sure what Connie she and I met no really talk about the doctrine you know and I did the same thing when Austin mentioned we're here I tried to just slow down a little bit and teach these so hope this is a blessing the Bible says you have three parts right and Christ wants to sanctify or clean out all of you wholly everything your whole spirit body and soul so there's your body we know that that's the outer court we want the Holy Ghost anointing on the body and then we here's what John the Baptist I think in the mother's room this one I think I believe it we have scripture to prove that he had the anointing in his mind even as a baby he had a human spirit and he jumped he leaped you know when he heard the name Jesus he leaped that's what it'll do to you and I write even today here the name of Jesus and get you off stirred up right all stimulated like ham breeze on Sunday and then the third part is your soul now this is what Jesus is talking about he's how about your soul this is the part that that Jesus was gonna bring rest - okay so let's can we prove that can we we have some readers here brother Adam let's go to Matthew 11:29 I just looked these up Matthew 11:29 I want to prove this to you it was the soul that Jesus was trying to get into Jesus was preaching to them about the Holy Ghost and he's he's trying to get into their soul and I'm turning their bow just give me a moment here at the eleven brother can you read 28 and 29 how about that sir thank you [Music] okay which part of you is gonna find rest your body when no Christians are still gonna be persecuted and tired just like everybody else your mind no your what your soul he's saying come to me and I'm gonna give you rest to your soul he's not talking about the body he's not talking about the human mind he's talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul now go Hebrews 4 this is proves it this proves right here Hebrews 4 and this is the squeeze of the Scriptures by the RAM teaches in the church age book about how we're not Sabbatarians or we're not we don't observe the physical Sabbath anymore it's the spiritual Sabbath that counts the holy ghost in the soul which interestingly while you're turning there to Hebrews for I've got two emails in the last month about that they're just these Sabbatarians are pounding on me to make it Saturday like I need to rest Saturday yeah like I read I rest Sunday Sunday I don't work Sunday now I work for God but I don't work in my job sunday is my day but it's it don't that that's my natural day but that's not even what's important what's important is rest in the soul that you get borned again that's what I'm trying to get brother Saturday's your commercial day we're trying to get them to rest from stop trying to earn salvation but to have the Holy Ghost in them amen to have God in them because then when God's in you then you rest from your works now it's not it's not me anymore it's Christ in me you and I just need to pray and then when we pray God leads us to do his will that's that's all it is it's Christ in you it's you resting from your work so I'm not trusting and what Jesse submitted in the flesh I'm trusting in what God does amen what is God done to me lately hallelujah what I just have to yield to him it's Christ doing the works it's not me it's Christ in me amen Hebrews four and so they're very respectful those Sabbatarians but but they sure didn't agree with me and I sure didn't agree with him but yep that's all right that's all right that's I mean what can you do I just we just stand on the Word of God you know oh and I even took him to Colossians where Paul said you know the holy days and Sabbath days and he said which were a shadow of things to come and they say they still can't even see that Paul's saying Sabbath days were shadows that was a shadow taking a physical day of rest that's a good thing we do that on Sunday right we don't work on Sunday but that's just a shadow and a shadow is not the real person right you don't want to shake my shadows hand you want to shake my hand I want to shake your hand not your shadow that's what you want we don't want to talk about Christ shadow we want Christ amen but see it's just it just takes the Holy Spirit that's why we're so thankful God sent a prophet ain't bad because without that we we would have been some along and maybe with and I have friends that have taken off from Friday night like I told you Friday night to Saturday night they physically they have Sabbath's I'll watch football and things like that see son it just shows its inconsistency its worldliness you know but it's just man works but they're physically attracted to that because this this world is so busy yes the cares of life but see it's because they don't have peace in their soul thank God we can have peace in our souls amen that's what they don't have church they're still trying to work and so see now I'm trying to work on a Friday night it's a Saturday they're trying to work on a Sabbath day but we don't work it's Christ working in us and I can truly say that if I did any ever if there's ever anything good in my life it was not me it was Christ in me amen Christ working through me because jesus said apart from me you can do nothing him head okay now he was for one let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should come short of it okay so Paul's saying here you know we have to labor to enter into the Holy Ghost you got to work and bring your in other words bring your body under subjection in other words you got to die to yourself you have to submit you have to become humble now I'm gonna skip down to verse 4 for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest so you talk about how God took a seven literal physical seventh day of rest now now look at verse six seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached and are not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your coach Joshua means Jesus Jehovah our Savior for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day so see Paul's showing how Joshua when he entered the promised land that wasn't the real rest God wanted God wanted us to enter the promised land of the Holy Ghost right the soul born again of the Holy Ghost Joshua brought them in the land but God want us to go into the land of the Holy Ghost as a type now look at verse 9 this I was trying to prove it to the individual both individuals on the email was verse 9 there remaineth therefore rest of the people of God you see there still arrest even though they enter in the promised land and rested and they honor the 7-day there still remained arrest for the people of God right Joshua gave them the rest they took the day off but there remain another ass they men okay now that's verse 10 for he that is entered into his rest he have also seized from his own works as God did from his time about New Testament rest verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief amen suppose you say we must enter into the promise of God it's the rest Jesus spoke of for your souls amen that's the rest he's talking about rest for your soul where it's no longer me it's Christ in me now verse 12 proves it for the word of God is quick see this is with us of the rest the Word of God is quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit soul and spirit there you go the Word of God dividing the soul and spirit and of the joints in the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the tense of the heart can brace amen amen that's just a real quick brief study on that all right now I'm gonna skip past this quote I usually school with marriage and divorce how we can't we have to go further with the word or else Christ can put us away I'm gonna skip that because I kind of gone over that twice so God want a deep intimacy with his creation how we would do this was a mystery though how how was God gonna get greater intimacy it was a mystery now through the message we now know what God was thinking God was gonna start god above us then he was gonna get closer to them God with us and then he was gonna get in us by God's grace this was God's plan for it see right father son Holy Ghost that's this plan of relationship to man intimacy so Paul said this mystery for God's desire to dwell in us was actually hidden God this was actually hid in his mind that's what Ephesians 3:8 9 said which from the beginning of the world was hidden God so see the that's why the Father Son and Holy Ghost is a mystery people asked me one time and I said it wrong the first time but they asked me later what was Matthew 28:19 where he said father son Holy Ghost was Jesus telling a parable one time I thought it was a parable it's not it's not a parable he's speaking in mystery Jesus is speaking of mystery Jesus is unleashing a mystery you're gonna baptize them in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he's speaking in the mystery because that mystery was hidden God that God is a father he'd become a son and he drown us by the Holy Ghost amen and there's one name to the Father Son Holy Ghost not names plural but one name it's the Lord Jesus Christ you see he was speaking in history in Matthew 20 19 that's what I told the guy teach the Bible club with just a few weeks ago I said he wasn't speaking in parable it was mystery that's why I said that mother bram said that even if Jesus was here today he's still to say the same thing baptized name a name of the father and all the ghosts because he has to give there has to be scripture that people stumble by people that really don't want to serve God the God has to lay out of Scripture there that though they'll turn and and because they don't agree with the truth they got to believe a lie see they gotta have scriptures there because Paul said that false doctrine manifests those who are heretics I mean alas the scripture gonna read that let's go - I believe it's Romans 16 if I'm not mistaken I'm just gonna go off my memory here so see God has to lay scriptures in here that kind of seem contradictory but they're not we know they're not there's no contradiction but he has to leave them in there because false teachers and doctrine will always manifest who is the heretic who has left of faith who's preaching for money or who's preaching for popularity or who's preaching for women the false doctrine always shows who's wrong amen and true doctrine oiz shows who's hallelujah thank God for that okay now give me just a moment as I look for here let me look on my Bible search I don't see it here I forgot my Bible at home I left it right by my table I think it's manifest heresy so just a minute here I'm sorry let me find it here yeah there it is okay it's not it's I'm sorry its first Corinthians 11 19 forgive me Church I thought it was Romans 16 tells us to avoid all those who teach false doctrine but its first Corinthians 11 19 I'm sorry forgive me I got my books mixed up there eleven nineteen yeah sure I'm thankful for concordance amen first Corinthians 11 19 for there must also be what heresies among you know we get all you know we I do I know I do I get little nervous when there's heresies I get the kind of discouraged but Paul's saying this must happen you must have heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you okay can never understand that by God's grace so see Jesus would have still said father so only ghost if he was alive today he's to go baptize them in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost because those that are heretics are those that really don't want the truth they would have found some way to detractor they would have found some way to separate from the Holy Ghost because the Bible said their sensual not having the Holy Ghost and they separate from those who do have the Holy Ghost is right there he meant hallelujah and that's in Judas go to Jude verse chapter 1 it's kind of hot lady can you turn down the key turn off the heater hon are you guys everybody hot I'm kind of warm yeah I'm kind of one can you turn off the heater hon just put it off and just put the fan on okay so Jude one I'm sorry Jude one you see so the person who doesn't have the Holy Ghost has to have some reason to leave and go start their own church er but God always starts with true doctrine right like on the day of Pentecost and then the wolves come in later you understand that Oh like brother man said about Moses Moses brought in the signs of miracles first he said then Janus and Jambres started impersonating him after that God always did it first yeah Paul came into Ephesus started church and he says I've cried for three years wolves are gonna come in and see then Satan comes in afterwards okay so Jude one and it's verse yeah its verse 19 these be they who separate themselves sensual not having the spirit so cease you know false teachers will have some lust like I said money popularity or women some lusts or something like that maybe big buildings which would be money but they need a reason to criticize the true church so they bring a false doctrine and that false doctrine it blast seems the truth but then because of that it manifests that they're not the true believer does that help by God's grace nope that's the scripture and they'll always separate themselves didn't Judas separate himself from the true believers right he separate himself but then the Bible said those that are with the faith will stay with us there's no doubt they'll continue with us those who are faithful Christians will always stay with the real Christians that's right okay so par me let's go move on see that mystery was hidden God it was hidden God I'm a father son Holy Ghost but I'm gonna manifest it at a certain times now Colossians ones are the same thing Paul said I'm a minister of the dispensation of God to fulfill the Word of God even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations but has now made manifest to a Saints whom God would make no one as the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory how many feel you got glory inside of you I know I've got glory inside because I know what it was like before I had this glory its Christ and you the hope of heaven the hope of glory heavens inside of you amen Colossians three to set your affections on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead I'm dead and my life is hid with Christ in God amen so my real life the real person that I am is in God where is it it's in his mind and Here I am living out God's will for me that's already in his mind but my life all I'm gonna be all I'm ever gonna achieve has already hid in the mind of God hallelujah and I'm just livin it out I'm just following the will of God I'm just doing what God asked me to do every day so see God above us Adam was sent away from breaking the garden breaking the fellowship in the Garden of Eden he broke the intimacy because he wasn't born again he broked into the sea he broke the fellowship ya then Enoch walked with God see how he starting to get the fellowship back Abraham called was called the friend of God God's riding to fellowship he's got above us he called Israel of Egypt to be a son and also a priesthood unto himself see once and now he calls a just a group of people before he walked with individuals now I'm gonna walk with a group of people it's God above us because Israel was called God said I loved Israel and I called my son out of Egypt in Exodus 19 he said you shall be a kingdom of priests unto me a holy nation I mean no we're kings and priests to see we're a different kind of King Kingdom a different kind of priesthood we're the spiritual priesthood they were natural physical Israel a holy land priesthood but we're universal heavenly Holy Ghost field priesthood hey man that's exactly right God above us God even caught Israel's wife but she was not faithful in Exodus I'm sorry zekiel 16 God found Israel and blood and mud pulled her out cleaned her up and said I swear I've entered into covenant with you saith the Lord you became mine but a few verses later he said but you didn't you about you trust in your own beauty and played the harlot because of thy renown and then Jeremiah he said backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away I gave her a bill of divorcement see he's got above us and he was trying so hard to to love them even he even dwelt among them with the Ark of the Covenant he was so close to them but their hearts turned away so God said okay I'll bring come in my own body I'll be a manual if you don't want my spirit there well I'll put my spirit in a body and outcome as God with us and the Bible I didn't have many scriptures on this guy they ran out of time so forgive me remember the angel said Gloria he said behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people glory to God in the highest peace on earth peace and goodwill toward men so when God came down to earth now God with us great joy was upon the earth hallelujah great joy good tidings peace toward all men and then Jesus while he was God with us he spoke about being in us in John 14 he said I'll pray the Father give you another comforter I'm sorry comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and listen shall be in you see he was saying I'm with you now but I'm going to be in you hallelujah I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you what I hope we have today we are not orphans we're not we're not people that can't be comforted we can be comforted we can have peace today because the comforters here with us amen that's why I was praying for that Texas church you know I my heart goes out to them I forgot to put them on the prayer list but does it but don't don't we all believe that God can comfort them now of course they're Baptist they don't believe in the full Holy Ghost like we do but they can experience the Holy Ghost - sanctification and that can be a comfort can you say amen to that they can be comforted by the Holy Spirit in that way not to the soul because they reject the word to get there but they can have a real experience with God they can be comforted by the Holy Spirit in the way of sanctification and justification amen which are all great things justification is a mighty work Saint vacation is a mighty work but the Holy Ghost is the sealing work amen it's the seal to the day of redemption and then you amen every word of God hallelujah you live it and ain't that every word of God now Jesus did I tell you the truth it's necessary it's expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I'll send him unto you you know you and I would have been just like the disciples we were been crying on Saturday oh Jesus is gone he's gone you and I would have been the same way wouldn't you like to have a pastor like Jesus who can walk on the water he called the storms he raised the dead he break up every funeral by raising the dead up of course we would I rat it because it's easier to lean on somebody who's there physically right it's easier but Jesus said it's better that I go away because that you won't get the Holy Ghost inside of you if I stay here and then he said when the Spirit of Truth has come he'll guide you into all truth now remember brother man so that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost right here I show the scripture all the time with people this is the evidence of the Holy Ghost I just shared it when I took Benjamin in the hotel last week and the woman said what church are you do you believe in tongues I said no so we we have tongues from time to time and we believe it's a gift but I said it's not the evidence I said John 16:13 I quoted this exact scripture brother Benjamin can tell you he was right there I said the Holy Ghost is being guided into all the truth of God that's Devon so the Holy Ghost that you can live all the word for your age and she said yeah I always believe that too I gave her my card you know but she never called me just try to witness the people you know they're hungry we have plenty of food for them if they're thirsty we have plenty of living water here we do by God's grace he'll not see the Holy Ghost won't speak of himself but whom sober or whatsoever he shall hear that shall I speak he will show you things that come the Holy Ghost will show us thing to come I'm me so the Holy Ghost will always make you worship Jesus for he shall receive a mine and shall show unto you all things that the father has are mine therefore I said that he shall take a mine and show it unto you and that day I love this you shall no not guess not hope for children we don't have to hope for the well do I have the Holy Ghost or not he said that that day you'll know that I'm in my father you and me and I'm in you we could know we've got God inside of us see that that's where the Holy Ghost is for - no I've got Christ in me like today I went to another meeting and this happens all the time all the teachers around Prince Prince around there and other people they're all custon about dirty about kids cuss and saying the bad words and I'm just sitting there staring at my screen like praying for them like God have mercy on these people and some of these people all say they go to church and love God and everything like that laughing about kids cussing and see that's just another reminder I've always got to be a light for Christ and I am just by saying they're not laughing and focusing and praying I am a light for Christ enough to answer right just like you on your job or your home where you are your family if you stand out with the word go off to answer for not living like you that's exactly right I love this how do you know how do you know Christ Christ is in you because he that hath my Commandments keeps them I keep the Word of God he it is that loveth me that's how I know I love Christ I keep the word he's in love with me shall be loved to my father I'll love him and manifest myself to him okay now now watch how Paul describes God in us see this is the this was the mystery God was above us with us but now I wants to be in us look how he describes it because remember Joe was wondering how can a man be justified with God how can he be clean he that's born of a woman see Joe was just getting cleaned by the blood of the sacrifice of blood of bulls and goats like cameras preaching and David in Psalm 51 he desired to have a clean heart again after falling in adultery and murder the man who slayed Goliath couldn't even slay his own lust remember that he slay Goliath but he couldn't even slay his own desire to take a man's wife can you be that the Holy Ghost the oil was poured all over his head but where was that when it came to Bathsheba it dried up it just see how the New Testament is so much greater we have so much greater power are you with me it's so much greater because David got slew by a lust even but you and I can slay that lust demon and there'll be no songs about us you know Adam is slain is ten thousand demons and Jesse's slain a thousand like there'll be no parades for us but I guarantee it's written in heaven hey man I guarantee it's written in heaven because the works of the believer are recorded in heaven hallelujah there's a book about us there's a book about you and you overcome there's a book about me and it's on record there and Christ is recording it amen so see we're not better than David but we've just got more access to more power amen hallelujah see to bring all these to bring this land in this objection right that's what I want to bring that out and remember here's how Paul describes it Paul says we are the temple of God and God said I'm gonna dwell in sister so-and-so I'm gonna walk in brother Jesse what a privilege we have Church God is dwelling in me God is walking it when I went to work today God walked into work today hmm that's how he describes it and I got 15 more minutes bear with me this is how he describes it God is walking inside of you when God is in us this is God's house I am God's house God lives here hallelujah right God lives here God's walking in me this is the description of it not just anointing and then leaves and northing the leaves but God actually lives and abides here amen don't get me wrong we do need that anointing on our human mind and flesh we do need that but when it all comes down to it when it boils down to obeying the Word of God or staying with the word you don't feel like it how do you know he's there because the anchor holds amen it holds you out of sin hallelujah it holds you into righteousness and keeps us in out hallelujah I'll be their God they'll be my people come out from among them be separ say the Lord don't touch the unclean thing and I will receive you and I'll be a father unto you so I'm I I'm the house of my father my father lives inside of me my father walks inside of me oh mercy now where'd you get this scripture do you ever run the run the reference on this this is where the scripture from the context is the two lambs for daily sacrifice like camp preached on Sunday so that when when God's telling Moses about the daily sacrifice he said I was sanctified the tabernacle of the congregation the altar I'll saying if I also both Aaron his sons to minister me in the priests office and I will dwell among the children Israel and will be their God what is he saying that God wants to live in us now he wants us to be a living sacrifice every day make sacrifices so God can walk in us amen so God can talk through us hallelujah it also gets quoted again here in Leviticus 26 the context of this is God's promise to bless Israel once they possess the promised land this is the whole chapters about that all the promises once they get the promise then and I will set my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you and I will walk among you and be your God and you should be my people see God above us was just God God above us it was he was just among us but now it's God in us oh it's so beautiful and I remember Paul said before the Holy Ghost we were without hope we had no covenant we had no God we're Gentiles think of all that we have now through the intimacy of the Holy Ghost the fellowship of this mystery Oh mine that made me cry when I studied that the first time think of all that we have because the Bible said we were without Christ we're aliens from Israel we're strangers we had no hope and we had no God we had nothing but now with Christ we've got God inside of us we've got eternal life inside of us we've got a portion of the king and kings and Lord of lords inside of us the Spirit of Christ now I'll try to close here yeah I got 12 minutes here now in verse 10 let me go back to Ephesians 3 can you imagine this is what all Paul's saying all this I'm just scratching the surface you know this is the letter that the people read in Ephesus they're trying to stay on fire and they're hearing about the Fellowship of the mystery I've tried to preach to you the Fellowship of the mystery I want everybody to see that this mystery is an intimacy with God God wants to be so personal with you that he lives in you he walks in you and talks with you every day that people see Christ in you I'm trying to make everybody see that that God can live inside of you too oh my that's beautiful fusions 310 sorry lost my spot there to the intent or purpose that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God so he's trying to get all men to see the mystery for the purpose that all the powers and wisdom might be known to the church and here's our brother branham set an expectation oh God strike the church this morning Lord with thy power and with thy manifold wisdom hey hey man how I'm getting poorer I'm trying to get everybody to see that that this is an intimate relationship and to understand the manifold wisdom and powers that are at access to the church are available for the church I thought that was beautiful they just praise the prayer and see when we receive the wisdom of God what do we start doing we start speaking the wisdom of God because the Bible said we speak we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery now now the mystery now we start sharing the mystery right but only the elect catch it when sister Beau started sharing the mystery with Adam he caught it because he's a member of the body of Christ right when I share it with people like I said last week at the hotel they didn't catch it it wasn't for them because it's a mystery to them but us we speak the mystery like the Bible said and it's ordained for our glory and what is our glory Christ in us that's the only thing we can boast in right the only thing we can boast in is the cross and how the cross brought us the Holy Spirit we can boast of nothing Paul said boast I have no nothing else to boast of just the cross of Jesus Christ let me glory in that people can glory in their sports and their money their fame but our glory in the cross of Christ and that now Christ is living in me hallelujah that's what we glory in see even the hidden wisdom which God before Dain before the world unto our glory which is the Holy Ghost Christ in us the hope of glory which none of the Prince of the world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory so see say none then have that wisdom there's certain wisdom that only comes its manifold wisdom it's great wisdom on how to conduct and live your life and glorify God it's great wisdom and that was Paul's purpose that we might know the manifold wisdom of God because remember wise virgins walk wisely right if you're wise version your life is filled with wisdom with your everyday decisions that's why you and I won't join certain things we won't do certain things why because we're using God's wisdom right that's exactly right we won't touch certain things we won't go certain places we only want other people can and even in our church or other churches they can go do things but some reason you and I can't why because it's God's wisdom living through us because we walk in wisdom every everything we do is based upon God's wisdom the manifold wisdom of God we walk in wisdom towards them but there are without redeeming the time let your speech be always with grace see so it affects your words if we have the wisdom we have to speak wisdom like last week we had sister Danny here now she never came back and she's actually done at our school sure her her contract ran up and so I don't see her anymore but when I started talking to her what happened I started speaking the wisdom of God to her and there's things she said she never heard before she never heard about the Queen of the South judging Jesus generation she never heard about the men of Nineveh judging jeeze generation she said Maya that's deep what was that that's the wisdom of God because I said I've got to stand there as a witness against my co-workers and this and all these communities that Halloween's of the devil right I mean we love people we appreciate people but if they want to come down to look at the Word of God we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery it just goes over their head but we speak it because we not only walk in it but we speak it we've received manifold wisdom of God on how to conduct our lives and so we speak the Word of God with wisdom it's a mystery it's hidden to most people it's hidden and that you may know how you ought to answer every man so our answers even contain wisdom our speech has wisdom and we walk in wisdom because we're wise virgins that's right now the depth here Paul Paul notes the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God and this is I just wrote here is if it's very wise of God to pass on mercy to the Gentiles after the Jews rejected that's what Paul is saying here God was very wise to do that the Jews and Gentiles were both in unbelief so God could then have mercy on all so see before God called the Jews all the Gentiles were in sin God knew that God knew the Gentiles were sinners so God called out Abraham and then Isaac Jacob and then then the children of Israel Moses and all these God caught out of people but then when they rejected the Holy Ghost God took it back to the Gentiles to have mercy on them right and that shows God's wisdom he gave both groups now we know there's Samaritans to bear with me you understand what I'm saying God has given every nation every every human group God has given everyone a chance and they've all failed that's why God could have mercy on all of them amen that's wisdom I've got to give everybody chance to receive it they'll all turn it down but because they'll all turn it down I can have mercy on all that's God's wisdom that's what Paul says the depths of the wisdom of God now here's another key that you're walking with wisdom I got five more minutes to bear with me here here's another way you know you're walking the wisdom of God because the wisdom that descends not from above so Satan's intellectual wisdom is earthly so it only pertains the things on the earth it doesn't pertain to storing up treasures in heaven its earthly it's sensual it gives you your lusts of your flesh things you want from your flesh things you'd lost your eyes pride of life and devilish which would be persecution you know the spirit of Satan persecutes the true spirit of God so that's how that's another way to know is this decision I'm making is this wise or not is this helping me storm earthly treasures or heavenly treasures is this feeding my flesh or is it helping to me me be more consecrated to Christ right like fasting when I asked the church to fast or if I asked you to come on Sunday night services like I know everybody's tired I'm tired on Sunday night I know it's hard to fast but what am i but if not what do we become we become more sensual right we just we're just naturally that way we've got to be under the leadership of the Holy Spirit with the wisdom of God so that we'll stay close to God because we've all seen people who don't consecrate their lives they're more sensual they're more earthly they're building an earthly Kingdom instead of building heavenly treasures and we don't want to be like that is every understand we don't want to be foolish we want to be wise that's foolish virgin type of material for where and being in strife is see we don't want to envy others we don't have arguments and divisions with people there's confusion in every evil work and thank God God has kept us God has really protected our church I'm very thankful you know God has really blessed our church and we all battle so you know but but God has been very gracious to us but the wisdom that's from above is first not like this pure so see when we're making decisions is this something I can say with a pure heart I'm choosing this to glorify God or is there a little bit impurity there see wisdom from God is pure it's peaceable brings the peace of God it's gentle it's easy to be taught or entreated you can easily be taught the Word of God when you when the wisdom of God is there you can easily be taught the wisdom of God full of mercy and good fruits without partiality see it's not well brother Jesse can get away with this but you can't you know it's impartial its impartial God's Word is true for everybody see and without hypocrisy see so we don't say one thing do another well I'm gonna fast but I'll eat the whole time you know alright faster do you know her so you understand we're not hypocrites what we say we live by the grace of God we're trying to be as sincere as we possibly can that's wisdom of God I'm trying to think if there's anything else I want to say on there so that's what we must do if we're gonna be though we're gonna have all the wisdom of God the manifold not look not a little bit of wisdom manifold major wisdom God is giving us plenty of wisdom we just gotta ask for wisdom and that's James chapter one we must not doubt when we ask for wisdom God you're gonna give me wisdom how to handle this there's a situation Church nobody knew about it I was praying about it on Sunday I had to answer Sunday night I knew when I had to answer it I was praying for God to give me wisdom I just committed in his hands I prayed about it and God totally took care of the situation it's too personal I can't share it but God just blew me away I did not expect this answer I ask God give me wisdom how to handle this I don't know what to do is if I choose this it's gonna hurt this person if I choose that is gonna hurt that person and God so change one person's heart that it totally took care of the whole situation I said oh thank you Jesus how you answered prayer head in other words he diffused a potential difficult situation I just want to thank the Lord for that that we just can't doubt and I was battling on his husband to work out I just had to cast it on the on the Lord I just kept Amen in the word and worship it and the problem took care of itself I could have lingered on that all day trying to pay attention but I got this problem and I don't know is God gonna give me wisdom or not but God took care of it I just tried to cast it upon the Lord and you know it was involved finances and involved families and of all these things and God took care of it and no there's no problem at all with it by the grace of Lord so thank you Jesus thank you lord I just thank the Lord for that God knows my heart I was really concerned about that okay I got 40 seconds so what can i creech in 40 seconds no let me just give me two minutes let me finish for this well close to the thought and this was actually the scripture we ended with when we read our text I was just kind of guessing maybe we'll get that far okay so boldness and access let's stand on our feet here have you stand here visions 3:12 in whom so time-out Christ our eternal purposes in Christ in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him by the faith of him I don't remember when I preached on the book of Revelation chapter 1 but chapter 1 says we have the faith of Jesus Christ that's a deep thought but in other words when we're anointed by the Holy Ghost and we have great faith in God's Word it's not-it's not even our faith its Christ's faith he's given us the faith so if we take that thought and apply to this scripture the only way we can pray the right way is when we pray with his faith in other words when we pray with for God's will that's the only way we can have confidence when we pray it's the only way we can be bold before God it's the only way we could have access before God is when we pray with God's own faith and I know that that's a really deep thought I could preach a whole sermon on that we have to look at all the prayers for the Bible prayers that were answered prayers that were not answered and you could see how they pray with God's God's will or not okay so what is bonus mean church it means freedom and speaking unreserve anise in speech open frankly without concealment so if I had something to tell brother Adam I would tell him everything about that situation I wouldn't conceal it and say well I can't tell Adam this part I did that last week I can't tell her on that that's not boldness you know if I got to repent say I'm sorry brother you know forgive me the only way I can be bold children is if I don't conceal anything I have to come clean with everything and that's how God wants us to pray not to conceal anything so see that's why that song says you know you can talk about me as much as you please I'll talk about you on my knees that's why that's so true because we because when we're in our prayer clauses alone we can tell God everything right this brother did this to me Lord Jesus you know and I really feel like maybe he did this that but Lord you know forgive helped me not to have any hard feelings again soon you know like when we're in our prayer closet with Christ nothing's concealed we can just say whatever and as long as always listening you know through the events you know you understand like we should we should just pray to God you know and we shouldn't pray loud if people are gonna hear us you know if we're gonna talk about people on our knees we should not pray so that people can hear but Aaron is there and I'm saying we have that boldness with Christ Jesus and a freedom I can tell the Lord anything in prayer right we can tell Christ anything in prayer as long as we say let your will be done now my will you were like I pray this all the time Lord I want to be a full-time pastor but I always got to say let your will be done because I want it right now I want to make videos more teaching videos I want to preach more sermons I want to study more things that's all I want to do I want to pray up and down all day back in I'm gonna just go do that all day I'd love to do that I do that all summer but it seems like God's an answer right now so what should i do should I get upset or should I just say Lord let your will be done I just have to say Lord let your will be done it's not my will but I can be so honest with him I I won't conceal that in prayer say lord I don't know why I'm not a full-time pastor yet but I'll wait upon your promise and fear let's see there's there's no there's no fear because perfect love casts out all fear well we're praying in the love of God we have boldness there's no fear I know God's hearing me right I have confidence God hears my prayer I've confessed all my sins I'm cheerful I'm cheerful one time for that I can't preach to us on Sunday I've got courage I've got blessed assurance a boldness when I pray now access means I'm moving too I can move closer to God never feel like that way in prayer you start off prayer you feel like real far away from God pretty soon you keep praying then you feel real close to God you didn't you might not even move to half inch but it's spiritually I no longer have my thoughts my thinking now I want the mind of Christ I want to pray his will not my I've moved now we have access so first we have that boldness and access move closer to God's we'd say God's heart we want God's heart for the situation now there's lot of scriptures on that we're not gonna read them but there they are maybe we'll start next Wednesday with those these are some really beautiful scriptures on boldness and prayer and access and maybe next week we'll go over those Lord willing but yeah I was going to get down to this I was going to review this how we're rooted and grounded in Christ remember that we are rooting the love of God I just I thought that was a nice little picture there on WordPress but that's where I was I had like about about ten more slides there by God's grace so we only got to hear a little bit more by the grace guy was going to review that the four the four depths of God's love there's four depths to God's love really beautiful thought there beautiful thought but army thankful for boldness and access tonight why don't we close with that or as we pray maybe we'll sing a couple of songs here father thank you for this almost 2000 years ago Lord this this letter is just alive today's the day he ruined because it wasn't written with man's ideas it was written by the finger of God and say it was written as Paul was moved by the Holy Ghost and Lord he was trying to tell us the church that there are so many unsearchable riches of Christ and waiting for us and more than we should as verse 10 says her verse 9 said help us to see the intimacy on the mystery and God help us to see that and you can walk in us when we walk home walk into our homes tonight that would treat each other so well and walk into our home I'll treat my children like you would they'll treat me like they treat you we'll have such an intimacy with you or that you'll be walking in us Lorna you could speak something and then we would answer you right away go pray for this one give this person $100 go fill this person's car up with gas go buy this person groceries pray for this person they're sick Oh miss them in the hospital that you could speak and we could quickly answer to your granny Lord Jesus or do you know how that made me feel when I first understood that the Fellowship of the mystery I want all men I won't be more my job I want the brothers our fellowship with at school I will then to see the Fellowship of this mystery I want them to see Christ in me help me to shine the light brighter of me to keep shining the light dear Jesus talking about the mystery how this intimate relationship father God must remember that we must have this great wisdom this manifold wisdom it's available to us lord I ask for right now you help every person here or my hands up I want to receive more help me knock it down thank you for helping me on Sunday that was all you are God that was all your grace and your wisdom the wisdom just to wait and gave me wisdom to wait and you worked out the whole situation thank you give us all wisdom Lord I need more wisdom and I won't doubt I know you'll give it to me because I desire to redeem the tithe your people here tonight desire to love you more to keep your Commandments fullness of us to remember the boldness we have the freedom we have been talking to you without concealment we don't have to hide anything we'll be proud of us they have no fear as we know we don't have any symbol for you here we've invested you put in the sea of forgetfulness the Christian can absolute in their soul so father and give us this access maybe move into your presence as we pray Lord tomorrow morning come on throughout the day when we move into that annoyed I saw this week on Tuesday morning I did you woke up at 5 a.m. way before my alarm went off and move
