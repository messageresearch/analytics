[39:06] and the manna ceased on the morrow after
[39:08] they'd eaten of
[39:10] the old corn of the land neither had the
[39:12] children of israel manna
[39:13] anymore but they did eat of the fruit of
[39:16] the land
[39:16] of canaan that year i think i'm going to
[39:20] read verse 13.
[39:21] i think i may get to hear we'll see
[39:22] today and it came to pass when joshua's
[39:25] by jericho that he lifted up
[39:26] his eyes and looked and behold there
[39:29] stood a man
[39:30] over against him with his sword drawn
[39:33] in his hand brother braham said this is
[39:36] the same man
[39:37] that was melchizedek hundreds of years
[39:40] earlier
[39:42] and joshua went unto him and said unto
[39:44] him art thou
[39:45] for us or for our adversaries
[39:48] praise god let's go to psalms 19 here
[39:50] psalm 19.
[39:59] psalm 19 verse 13.

[40:18] i hope you've been quoting this i've
[40:20] been quoting this you know off and on i
[40:21] think i quoted even yesterday i was
[40:23] praying just saying lord let the words
[40:24] of my mouth
[40:25] and the meditation of my heart be
[40:27] acceptable in your sight
[40:29] i don't want to complain i don't want to
[40:31] speak evil things
[40:33] i want to speak what's acceptable unto
[40:34] god let's read verses 13 and 14 together
[40:38] ready
[40:38] one two three keep back thy servant
[40:42] also from presumptuous sins let them not
[40:45] have dominion
[40:46] over me then shall i be upright
[40:50] and i shall be innocent from the great
[40:52] transgression
[40:54] let the words of my mouth and the
[40:56] meditation of my heart
[40:58] be acceptable in thy sight o lord
[41:01] my strength and my redeemer praise god
[41:04] may god add his blessings to the reading
[41:06] of his word you may be seated praise god
[41:11] i have some slides if you like to put
[41:14] them up there
[41:20] it's great to be in the house of lord
[41:22] together with everyone again we're so
[41:23] thankful for
[41:24] uh making it through another week praise
[41:27] god and uh we're just thankful for all
[41:29] god has done
[41:30] for us appreciate those testimonies
[41:32] brother jose that was really beautiful
[41:33] brother beautiful
[41:34] beautiful testimonies there so let's
[41:38] look to the lord here as we
[41:39] approach this word i just uh really been
[41:41] enjoying the book of joshua here and
[41:43] we'll
[41:44] look in chapter five today by god's
[41:46] grace
[41:49] uh i would like to uh start here with
[41:51] verse 10 and we read verses 10 11 12 and
[41:54] 13.
[41:55] um and this we have the general uh
[41:58] understanding here that
[41:59] israel is going to honor the passover
[42:03] and then the manna ceases from falling
[42:05] so in these individual scriptures
[42:07] we see a lot happening here now this is
[42:10] interesting you know john gill he was a
[42:12] preacher from the
[42:13] early 1900s he said that the camp
[42:16] of gilgal was about one mile away from
[42:18] jericho
[42:19] which is uh important to understand kind
[42:22] of the
[42:23] uh what happens next i'd say some of the
[42:25] context of what happens here
[42:27] uh so this is a quite a a story here as
[42:30] we saw
[42:31] last time last time we looked at a
[42:32] circumcision right it's a permanent
[42:35] cutting away of the flesh right it's a
[42:37] permanent it's a self-inflicted
[42:40] surgery right so the person that the man
[42:43] has to
[42:43] choose that personally individually it
[42:45] has to be his choice at least in this
[42:48] day it was the adult choice
[42:50] right and today it's the same it's the
[42:51] adult choices today praise god amen
[42:54] the adult has to make the decision that
[42:56] yes i'm going to be
[42:57] circumcised i'm going to keep the
[42:58] covenant i'm going to be completely
[43:00] separated
[43:01] uh from the flesh from the things of the
[43:03] world
[43:04] and i'm going to keep the commandments
[43:05] of god and i know that's going to make
[43:08] me
[43:08] have a part in the covenant of god are
[43:10] you glad to have a part in the covenant
[43:12] of god today
[43:13] it's called the new covenant not the old
[43:15] we are in the new covenant
[43:17] god is doing a new thing praise god
[43:19] hallelujah
[43:20] he worked with abraham and the old
[43:21] testament saints but for the last 2000
[43:24] years he's been doing a new thing
[43:26] remember a day is with the lord as a
[43:28] thousand years praise god so
[43:30] god has just had two days with the
[43:31] gentiles it's been a very it's been gone
[43:33] very fast right
[43:35] now for us it seems like a long time a
[43:37] long wait but timings means really
[43:39] nothing to god
[43:40] as far as he just you know he shows
[43:42] signs and wonders by the the things in
[43:44] the heavens you know by
[43:45] he counts time and he gives us
[43:47] encouragement along the way praise god
[43:49] but with god he is outside of time and
[43:52] and he works
[43:52] outside of those things many times and
[43:55] and he can work despite
[43:56] what may seem like limitations because
[43:59] god is the creator of time
[44:01] and so uh we're thankful you know that
[44:03] we can see these types you know we'll
[44:04] get to some of these types in just a
[44:05] moment
[44:06] uh but i just want to look again here
[44:08] now in verse 10
[44:09] i want to look at this just for a moment
[44:12] uh the children of israel encamped in
[44:13] gilgal which means rolling away
[44:16] remember god had rolled away all the
[44:19] connection to egypt
[44:20] right finally after after 40 years
[44:23] god had rolled all the reproach away
[44:26] uh they weren't they weren't keeping the
[44:28] covenant of god they were god's covenant
[44:30] people
[44:30] they've been brought out of egypt but
[44:33] they hadn't even kept the initial
[44:35] uh precepts of the covenant remember so
[44:37] much so that
[44:38] zipporah had to save moses's life
[44:41] because moses had neglected
[44:43] keeping the covenant right uh and and
[44:46] zipporah said you're a bloody husband to
[44:48] me right
[44:50] with their uh interesting relationship
[44:52] there i guess their human relationship
[44:54] we can say
[44:55] because we're all human right uh but he
[44:58] had failed to keep that
[45:00] uh but yet god had mercy on him and his
[45:02] wife saved his life brother branham said
[45:04] and in god and brother said god send us
[45:06] some more zephoras amen
[45:08] send us some zipporahs who will keep the
[45:10] covenant of god amen
[45:11] i think that's a beautiful testimony for
[45:13] zephora
[45:14] but here israel now look they've just
[45:17] crossed over
[45:18] about two million people now have have
[45:21] crossed over the jordan river
[45:23] uh the brothers have been circumcised
[45:25] here
[45:27] and they and then god says you you're
[45:30] going to keep the passover
[45:32] now this is interesting but look at the
[45:34] order here now they keep the passover
[45:36] which you know anything about leviticus
[45:38] 23.
[45:39] you know the passover was like the
[45:42] friday the saturday was
[45:44] the unleavened bread which actually
[45:46] lasted seven days but then the sunday
[45:48] was the
[45:49] uh the feast of first fruits right so
[45:51] when the bible just says passover it
[45:53] includes
[45:54] all three of those events right passover
[45:56] unleavened bread
[45:57] and then first fruits it includes all
[45:59] three so israel as soon as
[46:01] their cross over they get circumcised
[46:04] they keep the feasts
[46:05] praise god and so the order was they
[46:07] crossed jordan now
[46:08] jordan is waters and that's the type
[46:12] of the spirit immersion right
[46:15] the baptism of the holy ghost right
[46:17] because we know there's a water baptism
[46:19] that was the red sea
[46:21] but then there's another baptism so
[46:23] waters always represent
[46:24] immersion or baptism so this was the
[46:27] second
[46:28] baptism they had the water baptism of
[46:30] the red sea
[46:31] but god said you need another baptism
[46:33] praise god amen
[46:34] i don't know you need a baptism when you
[46:36] come out of the world and then you need
[46:38] a baptism when you go into the promises
[46:40] of god
[46:41] how many are living in the promises of
[46:42] god amen see
[46:44] outside of the land they weren't yet
[46:46] enjoying all the promises of god they
[46:48] had many wonderful promises
[46:50] but they were enjoying all the promises
[46:53] of god
[46:53] i don't want to live outside the land i
[46:55] believe i'm living in the land
[46:57] where i'm enjoying the full benefits the
[46:59] full promises of god
[47:00] where every promise is yea and amen
[47:03] praise god
[47:04] i'm not really looking for another day
[47:05] like yeah we're looking for the rapture
[47:07] we're looking for that day
[47:08] we're looking for the day of the lord
[47:10] but as far as a christian life
[47:12] you know we're not looking for another
[47:13] day like oh i hope someday i can
[47:15] i can live a real christian life we
[47:16] should be enjoying the blessings of a
[47:18] christian life
[47:19] right now praise god every earthly
[47:21] blessing every
[47:22] every blessing god has given to us peter
[47:24] calls it all spiritual blessings
[47:26] we should be enjoying those blessings
[47:28] right now amen
[47:30] hallelujah because we are living in our
[47:32] inheritance we
[47:33] we possess what god has given to us as
[47:36] christians were walking in the full plan
[47:38] of god amen
[47:40] now uh so that was the type of the
[47:43] immersion of the soul which we'll get to
[47:44] that just a moment the scripture
[47:47] so they cross the water that's the
[47:50] spirit immersion
[47:51] and then they get circumcised
[47:53] immediately after
[47:54] showing this is one and the same thing
[47:56] praise god god was going to give them
[47:58] many
[47:59] god has given us many different symbols
[48:01] to symbolize
[48:02] what happens when a person's born again
[48:04] right and so
[48:05] their their soul is immersed in the holy
[48:07] ghost and their soul
[48:09] uh the the fleshy nature or the unbelief
[48:13] is cut away from their soul praise god
[48:15] right because the bible says the soul
[48:17] that sinneth the soul that disbelieves
[48:19] it shall die
[48:20] but when you're circumcised and born
[48:22] again that soul the unbelief has been
[48:24] cut away praise god
[48:26] and now the only thing that's there is
[48:27] faith amen
[48:29] right the holy spirit in other words the
[48:31] faith of christ
[48:32] the spirit of christ amen the holy
[48:34] spirit
[48:36] now and then now that circumcision
[48:39] permanently cuts away that fleshly
[48:41] unbelief
[48:43] and then now they instantly or they
[48:45] immediately enter in
[48:47] to feasting feast
[48:50] right but they but they have all these
[48:52] battles but god said stop
[48:54] and remember this is feast time you've
[48:57] just crossed over
[49:00] all that you the reason i brought you
[49:02] out you've actually accomplished it
[49:04] praise god yes there's more
[49:05] there's many more battles to come and
[49:08] history says they overcame 31
[49:10] kings if you count the kings there 31
[49:13] kings they may have come over
[49:14] yes there was a lot of work to do i
[49:17] imagine god was telling joshua
[49:18] you got to slow down and you got to
[49:20] remember these wonderful things i've
[49:22] done
[49:22] and you got to take a few feast days and
[49:24] you got to rest
[49:26] in what i've done for you you've got to
[49:27] rest and remember what the
[49:30] passover lamb has done for you amen
[49:33] hallelujah
[49:34] remember that original passover lamb
[49:37] that was
[49:38] slain 40 years ago that brought you out
[49:41] and now you're brought in so see
[49:44] remember the cross in other words
[49:47] remember the unleavened bread that
[49:49] they're all the leaven was taken away
[49:51] jesus took all the leaven away praise
[49:54] god
[49:55] hallelujah and then the feast of first
[49:57] fruits the resurrection
[49:58] jesus resurrected to do this amen it was
[50:02] through the power of the resurrection
[50:04] right through the resurrection power
[50:06] that now we can cross over
[50:08] and we can be a part of the promised
[50:10] land
[50:11] through the work of jesus christ the
[50:14] cross
[50:14] the carrying away and the resurrection
[50:16] because of that initial work
[50:18] god has brought us into his further
[50:21] promises amen
[50:22] amen oh it's beautiful the man says it's
[50:24] deep and rich amen
[50:26] hallelujah now remember there was eight
[50:28] types there's eight and eight is the
[50:30] number of eternity right
[50:32] because eight is the first day all over
[50:34] again
[50:35] right so there and not now there could
[50:37] be more but this is what i found when i
[50:38] studied it
[50:39] there's eight types in the old testament
[50:41] for the soul's nature change
[50:43] you're filled the soul is filled right
[50:45] or
[50:46] uh then second the seal is i'm sorry the
[50:49] soul is sealed
[50:50] the soul is clothed the soul is
[50:52] circumcised
[50:53] the soul is brought forth or born again
[50:56] the soul is quickened made alive
[50:58] the soul is immersed and the soul is at
[51:01] rest
[51:02] praise god all these are descriptions
[51:05] all throughout the old testament the new
[51:06] testament
[51:07] they're all pointing us to one thing
[51:10] that jesus christ
[51:11] lives in you oh hallelujah
[51:14] they're all pointing to the same thing
[51:16] someone else is living inside of you
[51:18] it's christ amen amen it's the god of
[51:21] heaven
[51:22] is living inside of you all these
[51:23] different illustrations
[51:25] all to get you to see the great work all
[51:27] that jesus accomplished
[51:29] by filling you with the holy ghost all
[51:31] these descriptions have all happened
[51:33] that moment when eternal life came into
[51:35] you and you pass from death
[51:37] unto life amen they crossed over they
[51:40] cross over from death
[51:42] into life into the promised land praise
[51:44] god
[51:45] what a beautiful scripture that is now
[51:47] here this this
[51:48] tells us again first corinthians 10
[51:51] verse 2
[51:52] and we and we're all baptized unto moses
[51:55] in the cloud and in the sea so the red
[51:58] sea represented the water baptism right
[52:01] and so that means the sea of jordan
[52:03] represented the baptism of the holy
[52:05] ghost
[52:06] now here's what joshua joshua has told
[52:08] this in leviticus 23
[52:11] i'm sorry moses was told this but then
[52:12] moses repeated it to joshua
[52:15] let me check the year on that there
[52:17] scofield has a nice uh
[52:19] uh chronological order of scripture so
[52:23] this was in
[52:24] 1490 1490 okay
[52:28] so this was told to moses 1490 uh
[52:31] usher's history says joshua went in in
[52:34] 1451
[52:35] 1451. so 1490 this is about 40 years
[52:39] later
[52:40] 40 years there so 40 years ago joshua
[52:42] could remember moses saying
[52:44] speak unto the children of israel and i
[52:45] say unto them when you come in the land
[52:47] which i give you and you shall reap the
[52:49] harvest thereof
[52:50] then you shall bring a sheaf of the
[52:51] first fruits of your harvest
[52:54] unto the priests and he shall wave the
[52:56] sheep before the lord to be accepted for
[52:58] you
[52:58] on the morrow after the sabbath the
[53:00] priest shall wave it
[53:02] now remember god's saying remember to do
[53:04] this now church the only way we would
[53:06] remember is if god reminds us praise god
[53:09] which one of you are going to remember
[53:10] something 40 years later
[53:12] right you don't have enough paper you
[53:14] probably run out of paper right you lose
[53:15] the paper
[53:16] i mean after 40 years we can hardly
[53:18] remember one thing from last week right
[53:20] but god so see god is going to help us
[53:22] remember if god was faithful
[53:24] to remind them that god is going to be
[53:26] faithful to remind us praise god
[53:29] because god has a time and season for
[53:31] everything what a wonderful thing joshua
[53:33] could say you could say wow 40 years ago
[53:36] god said we were going to do this and we
[53:38] are now doing this praise god
[53:40] we're enjoying the passover oh we ate of
[53:42] the lamb
[53:43] and we're enjoying the unleavened bread
[53:45] our houses
[53:46] our tents rather are clean from all
[53:48] leaven there's no leaven among us
[53:50] amen we're a mighty army praise god
[53:53] there's no leaven among us
[53:55] and now we're waving the first fruits as
[53:57] we'll see and they weren't even theirs
[53:59] praise god
[54:00] god just blessed them with the first
[54:03] fruits
[54:04] of the canaanites right the jericho
[54:06] whites god let them have the fruit
[54:08] of the land from jericho praise god as
[54:11] we'll get to in just a moment
[54:12] this is what joshua here experienced now
[54:14] this reminds us church as soon as the
[54:16] day of pentecost came
[54:18] the holy ghost fell and what happened
[54:20] the people started feasting together
[54:24] i'm glad to say bang and i have been
[54:25] feasting for a long time now right
[54:26] brother
[54:27] we've been feasting together since the
[54:29] beginning my wife and i
[54:31] see when god falls in a place when god
[54:33] moves upon people
[54:34] he makes a new family praise god he
[54:37] unites a family of believers together
[54:40] and just like when joshua crossed over
[54:42] they had a feast
[54:43] so in the natural in the spiritual when
[54:46] the book of acts church crossed over in
[54:47] the baptism of the holy ghost
[54:49] they had feast they had doctrine and
[54:51] fellowship
[54:52] and breaking of bread and prayers and
[54:55] they kept it going in one accord
[54:57] they broke bread from house to house
[55:00] they ate their meat with gladness
[55:02] and singleness of heart they were happy
[55:03] about being christians amen
[55:05] they weren't sad about it they were
[55:07] happy about it amen
[55:08] they'd just been brought over the jordan
[55:11] amen they just crossed jordan
[55:13] into the baptism of the holy ghost they
[55:14] were good amen
[55:16] they're rejoicing in what god done they
[55:19] were praising god
[55:21] right they weren't blaming god they were
[55:24] praising god
[55:26] hallelujah having favor with all the
[55:28] people
[55:29] and the lord added to the church daily
[55:32] such
[55:33] as should be saved that's what we can
[55:35] rest in god will always add the souls at
[55:37] the right time
[55:39] praise god he'll always do it and we
[55:42] just got to be faithful to him and his
[55:43] word
[55:44] and trust him and he will add the lord
[55:47] adds them praise god
[55:48] now remember this thought paul said we
[55:52] now this is speaking of a man who is in
[55:54] sexual sin he said purge out that old
[55:56] leaven that ye may be a new lump
[55:58] so look church a church that has sinners
[56:01] in it
[56:02] is an old dirty lump we'll say like that
[56:05] or old
[56:06] corrupted lump right but as soon as that
[56:09] part is interesting
[56:10] as soon as that one person leaves it's a
[56:13] brand new church amen
[56:14] hallelujah if there's a sinner amongst
[56:17] us
[56:18] and they would be convicted to leave or
[56:20] god would send them away
[56:21] or they would repent that'd be the best
[56:23] case scenario right repenting and
[56:25] getting right with god
[56:26] then automatically that church becomes a
[56:29] brand new church
[56:30] amen oh hallelujah see churches go
[56:33] through seasons of hard times and good
[56:35] times
[56:36] when are the good times the good times
[56:38] are when all the leaven gets put out
[56:40] and it's a brand new church again praise
[56:42] god amen
[56:43] remember jesus said i make all things
[56:45] new praise god
[56:47] and we ended with that scripture on
[56:48] wednesday that said the only thing that
[56:50] avails
[56:51] is a new creature in christ jesus
[56:54] that's what prevails that's what will
[56:56] give you overcoming strength
[56:58] is that you know your life has been made
[57:00] new i'm newly committed amen
[57:03] i'm newly encouraged praise god i'm
[57:05] newly strengthened i've got the joy of
[57:07] the lord
[57:08] i'm a new creature in christ that will
[57:10] prevail in your life amen
[57:12] for the joy of the lord is your strength
[57:14] complaining being discouraged
[57:16] being beat up being being destitute all
[57:19] these things
[57:19] that's not going to help anyone prevail
[57:21] praise god that's the anointing of the
[57:23] devil right
[57:24] but when the real christian army gets
[57:26] together they get rid of all their own
[57:28] leaven
[57:28] and they become a new army and they're
[57:31] keeping the feast
[57:32] the bible said christ is our passover
[57:34] amen
[57:36] even now jesus christ is our passover he
[57:39] was our passover lamb
[57:40] and can i say like this the token of his
[57:43] blood should be upon our souls amen
[57:47] and then we keep the feast now paul this
[57:49] is
[57:50] i believe if i'm not mistaken this was
[57:52] either 11 or 14 years after pentecost
[57:55] and paul's saying we're still keeping
[57:57] the feast of the passover
[58:00] we're still remembering the cross of
[58:02] jesus christ every day we must remember
[58:04] the cro the price that he paid and not
[58:07] only that
[58:08] but all that had purchased amen and
[58:10] purchase
[58:11] all that we have need of every day
[58:13] praise god
[58:15] so we keep the feast today not with old
[58:18] leaven not with sin
[58:20] in our lives right uh we don't we don't
[58:22] keep sin
[58:23] neither with the leaven of malice that's
[58:25] where we get a lot of message believers
[58:27] here
[58:27] malice and wickedness that's where satan
[58:29] can get them right they can say i
[58:30] believe brother braham i believe i
[58:32] believe all these things i believe the
[58:33] mysteries they can say all these things
[58:35] but let's get down into our lives and
[58:36] see if we're holding any malice
[58:38] or wickedness in other words we haven't
[58:40] cleaned 11
[58:42] out of our homes we're out of our minds
[58:46] right it's okay to differ with somebody
[58:48] but we still must
[58:49] forgive even our worst enemies praise
[58:52] god
[58:53] love your enemies jesus said pray for
[58:55] them who despitefully use you
[58:57] so see a person will feel like not a new
[59:00] lump but a
[59:00] lot they'll feel like the gospel is
[59:02] getting old when they
[59:04] harbor malice and wickedness in their
[59:06] hearts and the church said
[59:08] but as long as you keep all that out
[59:11] you're going to feel like a new love all
[59:13] the time
[59:14] hallelujah that's right that's what the
[59:15] word of god says as long as you
[59:18] keep out the old leaven the malice and
[59:20] the wickedness and the evil thoughts
[59:21] you'll feel like a new christian all
[59:24] things will be new to you
[59:25] you'll you'll enjoy all the word of god
[59:27] you'll be nourished you'll be fed
[59:29] you'll be taken care of you're god's
[59:31] child and god has wonderful blessings
[59:33] at his table for you today praise god
[59:37] oh my god so christ is our passover the
[59:41] cross
[59:42] what's our unleavened bread sincerity
[59:45] truth
[59:46] and all sins confessed
[59:49] praise god so jesus we we know for
[59:51] unleavened bread was when
[59:52] jesus carried our sin away he took our
[59:54] sin to hell right
[59:55] that's brother man was a great story
[59:57] about that where he took he took the
[59:58] keys of death in hell from satan that
[1:00:00] beautiful story it's scriptural
[1:00:01] totally scriptural but for us
[1:00:04] it is getting rid of our malice and
[1:00:07] wickedness and being totally sincere
[1:00:10] with one another and with god walking in
[1:00:13] sincerity
[1:00:14] walking in truth friends if we're saying
[1:00:16] that today if we're saying i'm totally
[1:00:18] sincere today
[1:00:20] i i'm totally right before god i've
[1:00:22] walked into all the truth i can walk
[1:00:24] then church we are having an
[1:00:25] unleavened bread feast this morning amen
[1:00:28] hallelujah
[1:00:29] and we are actually enjoying the
[1:00:31] passover feast right now
[1:00:33] we're eating on the lamb praise god
[1:00:35] we're eating of the bitter herb bread
[1:00:38] we're partaking of his sufferings but
[1:00:40] also we're partaking of unleavened bread
[1:00:42] we're sincere we're walking in truth and
[1:00:45] it's a feast day
[1:00:46] it's a special day right it's a feasting
[1:00:49] time it's a time of joy
[1:00:50] because god has done great things for us
[1:00:52] he's brought us over jordan oh my
[1:00:57] fourteen years after pentecost they're
[1:00:59] still keeping the same passover feasts
[1:01:02] hallelujah that's uh in church whose
[1:01:05] responsibility is
[1:01:06] it's mine but it's also yours too you
[1:01:09] can't put it all in the preacher right
[1:01:11] brother ram said i can come be anointed
[1:01:12] as much as possible but if the people
[1:01:14] don't have the same anointing it ain't
[1:01:15] going to do any good
[1:01:17] so we've all got to keep the feasts
[1:01:19] praise god we've all got to remember the
[1:01:21] passover lamb
[1:01:22] we all got to be sincere and living in
[1:01:25] truth praise god

[1:04:02] honey can say amen to that that's true
[1:04:06] it's true we just got to confess our
[1:04:07] sins and we'll walk in the newness
[1:04:10] now notice matthew henry getting back to
[1:04:12] joshua he said we may well imagine that
[1:04:15] the people of canaan
[1:04:16] were astonished and that when they
[1:04:18] observed the motions of the enemy they
[1:04:20] could not think but them very strange
[1:04:23] think about it think about this church
[1:04:24] when the soldiers take the field they're
[1:04:26] apt to think themselves
[1:04:28] excused from religious exercises
[1:04:31] they have not time nor thought to attend
[1:04:33] to them yet joshua opens a campaign
[1:04:35] with one act of worship after another
[1:04:40] now church check check what happens
[1:04:43] israel crosses over jordan all the
[1:04:46] inhabitants now remember
[1:04:47] there was canaanites living outside of
[1:04:49] jericho right they had all their farms
[1:04:51] out there
[1:04:52] as soon as they heard it they crossed
[1:04:53] over all these farmers left all their
[1:04:56] farms
[1:04:56] and they ran into jericho to be safe
[1:05:00] but god you know you would think like a
[1:05:03] a military man would say okay we're
[1:05:04] crossover
[1:05:05] let's go take jericho right now but
[1:05:07] joshua's like no
[1:05:08] let's stop we need to have a
[1:05:10] circumcision
[1:05:12] we got to prepare our hearts for this
[1:05:14] battle amen
[1:05:16] our hearts must be prepared to fight
[1:05:18] praise god amen
[1:05:20] our hearts must be totally purged from
[1:05:22] any selfishness or any
[1:05:24] any fleshly desires if we're going to
[1:05:26] overcome we need circumcised hearts amen
[1:05:29] amen but joshua don't say okay where
[1:05:31] crossover let's go he said nope
[1:05:33] circumcise all the men
[1:05:34] that took numerous days to heal and then
[1:05:37] i said now
[1:05:38] and i'm sure all the men were ready to
[1:05:39] go i'm healed now let's go fight he said
[1:05:42] no
[1:05:42] it's time to keep the passover it's time
[1:05:45] to remember
[1:05:46] what got us here in the first place i
[1:05:48] think we can never forget
[1:05:50] what god is here the blood of the lamb
[1:05:52] god is here amen
[1:05:54] they take at least seven or eight or
[1:05:55] nine or ten days there maybe 14 days
[1:05:58] in other words they're taking breaks in
[1:06:00] the war malachi knows a lot about world
[1:06:02] war ii
[1:06:04] those soldiers on the allies have a lot
[1:06:06] of vacations maokai
[1:06:09] once they landed on iwo jima did they
[1:06:11] take a vacation
[1:06:13] no they just kept come and come and come
[1:06:14] and how long was that battle was that a
[1:06:16] month
[1:06:17] three weeks to take the island of iwo
[1:06:19] jima
[1:06:21] longer than that so the american army
[1:06:24] didn't take any breaks when they were
[1:06:26] taking over iwo jima right
[1:06:28] to get that island but joshua takes a
[1:06:31] break
[1:06:33] because he said we got to get our heart
[1:06:34] circumcised and we have to recognize we
[1:06:37] have to show special devotion to god
[1:06:40] we need to we need to fulfill what god
[1:06:43] told us to fulfill
[1:06:44] in other words it's the season oh glory
[1:06:47] it was the season of harvest amen
[1:06:49] and this is the season to remember what
[1:06:52] god has done for us
[1:06:53] it's the season we must act according to
[1:06:55] the season praise god
[1:06:57] and this is the season of the rapture
[1:06:59] amen it's the season of the finishing of
[1:07:01] the mysteries of god
[1:07:03] it's the finishing of the harvest and we
[1:07:05] lay in the presence of the son
[1:07:07] we humble ourselves and we become more
[1:07:09] like christ all the time
[1:07:10] amen that's not boring that's not old
[1:07:13] eleven
[1:07:14] that's new leaven that's life amen
[1:07:16] that's maturity praise god
[1:07:18] amen that's maturity becoming the wheat
[1:07:21] you were supposed to become praise god
[1:07:24] if it's old because you let malice and
[1:07:26] wickedness in
[1:07:27] if the message becomes old it's because
[1:07:29] they've let sin
[1:07:31] and complexes in their life
[1:07:34] our sister haverick's been a lot around
[1:07:36] a long time i'm sure you could say men
[1:07:37] to that you've seen
[1:07:38] a lot of people i've only been around 20
[1:07:40] years and i've seen that a lot
[1:07:42] people that start strong but then the
[1:07:44] word becomes old
[1:07:45] it becomes boring it don't become as
[1:07:47] exciting as it used to be
[1:07:49] if brother brahm told us we got to keep
[1:07:51] our enthusiasm there must be a way to do
[1:07:53] it
[1:07:54] and i know the way it's the word
[1:07:58] it's to purge out the old leaven purge
[1:08:00] out the mouths
[1:08:01] purge out the wickedness keep your heart
[1:08:03] tender hearted amen
[1:08:05] keep your soul all loved for jesus and
[1:08:07] if you love jesus you can't help but
[1:08:09] love
[1:08:10] all those that he created amen
[1:08:12] hallelujah
[1:08:15] so all the canaanites are like what is
[1:08:17] going on how come now look at that
[1:08:18] church
[1:08:19] god has brought the mighty army over and
[1:08:22] all the farmers they run into jericho
[1:08:23] and
[1:08:24] they're just shaking i'm just i'll shake
[1:08:25] my knees like that they're just shaking
[1:08:27] for all these days like when are they
[1:08:28] coming
[1:08:29] they're going to kill us when are they
[1:08:30] coming remember this is god's judgment
[1:08:34] right this judgment on canaan is over
[1:08:36] 440 years
[1:08:38] old because god told abraham i'm going
[1:08:40] to bring my people out and judge the
[1:08:42] amorites
[1:08:43] he said the cup of the amorites isn't
[1:08:44] yet full
[1:08:46] so this is the judgment of all these
[1:08:48] canaanite nations
[1:08:50] and so see god's in no hurry i'll tell
[1:08:52] you god is a god of grace
[1:08:55] god let them have a little wildlife
[1:08:57] because he says god let rahab
[1:08:59] have a few more extra days amen to try
[1:09:02] to get some souls
[1:09:03] under that token amen hallelujah
[1:09:07] any naturals general would have just
[1:09:08] said okay we're over we're going to
[1:09:10] jericho tomorrow it's only a mile away
[1:09:12] how long does it take to walk them out
[1:09:13] church don't take very long
[1:09:16] 15 20 minutes but god said no we got to
[1:09:18] do the circumcision we got to get the
[1:09:19] covenant established
[1:09:20] and we got a feast this is not like any
[1:09:24] general praise god
[1:09:26] this is unlike any general why because
[1:09:28] he was led by the holy spirit praise god
[1:09:34] so instead of opening their campaign
[1:09:36] with fight after fight
[1:09:39] they open it with worship and more
[1:09:41] worship
[1:09:43] and remembering all that god has done
[1:09:46] see god wants us to rest look god is
[1:09:48] teaching them rest in me
[1:09:49] amen when you're when you're walking in
[1:09:52] obedience
[1:09:52] you're always right on time amen if
[1:09:55] you're in the perfect will of god
[1:09:57] you're not late you're not early your
[1:09:59] life is completely in line with god's
[1:10:00] word amen you'll never be late
[1:10:03] you'll never be early you'll always be
[1:10:05] right on time
[1:10:07] because you're keeping all of god's
[1:10:08] commands one day at a time
[1:10:11] hallelujah
[1:10:14] look what brother adam said he said you
[1:10:16] see he was joshua was getting his
[1:10:18] position then
[1:10:19] he he was to be the greatest military
[1:10:23] man
[1:10:24] that's ever been on the face of the
[1:10:26] earth
[1:10:27] there's never been a general like joshua
[1:10:30] no time
[1:10:31] no age nowhere has ever been compared
[1:10:35] with joshuas i know malachi likes world
[1:10:37] war ii so take note of that malcolm
[1:10:39] that's some that would help you out he's
[1:10:41] doing a presentation on
[1:10:42] world war ii this week i think so maybe
[1:10:44] you can slip that in there somehow
[1:10:47] these generals were great for the allies
[1:10:48] but here the greatest general is joshua
[1:10:52] there's never been anyone like joshua no
[1:10:55] one can even be compared to joshua
[1:10:58] because it means his name means jesus or
[1:11:01] savior deliverer now look if the
[1:11:04] greatest general
[1:11:06] could take time out of his busy schedule
[1:11:08] to make sure everybody had the holy
[1:11:10] ghost right
[1:11:11] to make sure all the men were in the
[1:11:13] covenant right to make sure
[1:11:15] we keep all the festivals of god we keep
[1:11:18] our sins we keep our hearts sincere
[1:11:20] right we live sincere lives before
[1:11:23] moving on to fight these great giants
[1:11:25] somebody got giants in your life right
[1:11:27] so did joshua right they had many giants
[1:11:29] there's many giants there to take
[1:11:31] care of but before they approach any of

[1:17:13] the old corn of the land on the morrow
[1:17:17] after the passover unleavened cakes and
[1:17:21] parched corn
[1:17:22] in the self same day where'd they get
[1:17:24] that corn
[1:17:26] the bible said in verse 12 the man has
[1:17:28] ceased on the morrow after they'd eaten
[1:17:30] of the old corn
[1:17:31] of the land neither had the children of
[1:17:35] israel manna anymore
[1:17:36] but they did eat of the fruit of the
[1:17:38] land of canaan
[1:17:40] that year thank goodness gracious
[1:17:45] well or josh was like it's time to have
[1:17:46] a feast
[1:17:49] we need all this food and everything
[1:17:50] like that they're just sojourners right
[1:17:52] they just cross over
[1:17:54] but god by his power had driven out all
[1:17:56] the farmers
[1:17:57] and they have all these barns and all
[1:17:59] these garages or
[1:18:01] houses and church all they got to do is

[1:18:05] or else you gotta do is walk out to the
[1:18:06] field and start picking corn well here
[1:18:08] we got all the corn
[1:18:09] they walk into all these things they
[1:18:11] didn't even do
[1:18:13] right they benefit from the labors of
[1:18:15] others that's what jesus told his
[1:18:17] disciples
[1:18:18] he said you are walking in the labors of
[1:18:20] other men
[1:18:22] and you don't even realize it brother
[1:18:24] brahm said he said it's because
[1:18:26] of all those men from 1906 azusa street
[1:18:29] that prayed and fastened he said and
[1:18:31] beat tamarines on the corners without
[1:18:33] church buildings
[1:18:34] that we can have church buildings today
[1:18:36] with air conditioning
[1:18:38] we ought to be thankful church amen
[1:18:41] we're just living
[1:18:42] off other people's works right we're
[1:18:44] enjoying the efforts of other people
[1:18:46] praise god amen
[1:18:49] hallelujah we're
[1:18:52] we're enjoying all these blessings and
[1:18:54] many times we forget
[1:18:56] to be thankful that we are enjoying the
[1:18:59] benefits
[1:19:00] of other people's labors i'm so glad
[1:19:02] somebody labored to type out all of
[1:19:04] brother branham's
[1:19:06] words that's a lot of work
[1:19:09] that's a lot of typing that's a lot of
[1:19:12] time at the computer
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:16] i'm so glad i enter into other people's
[1:19:18] labors i just gotta type in two words
[1:19:20] joshua captain lords and i can pull up
[1:19:22] all these clothes i guess
[1:19:24] oh yeah that's right here's what he said
[1:19:26] i just i'm
[1:19:27] entering into other people's labors
[1:19:30] praise god and that's what israel did as
[1:19:32] soon as they cross over
[1:19:34] god said you know celebrate this get all
[1:19:36] the leaven out but get the corn
[1:19:38] and they just gotta walk and get the
[1:19:40] corn it's just freely given
[1:19:42] church all these blessings are just
[1:19:44] freely given to us
[1:19:46] hallelujah healing salvation
[1:19:49] right encouragement joy and peace and
[1:19:52] patience
[1:19:53] all these blessings they're just freely
[1:19:55] given to us
[1:19:56] amen what did you do for it not much you
[1:19:59] just surrendered you just followed the
[1:20:01] pillar of fire
[1:20:01] you just followed joshua over jordan
[1:20:04] amen
[1:20:05] you just follow the arcade man the ark
[1:20:07] brought you over
[1:20:08] the word brought you over and all these
[1:20:11] blessings are freely given praise god
[1:20:13] amen god provides just what they need to
[1:20:18] keep the feast if god ever requires you
[1:20:20] to do anything
[1:20:21] he's going to give you what you what is
[1:20:23] required of you
[1:20:25] praise god whatever he requires
[1:20:28] he'll give you what you need to meet
[1:20:30] that requirement
[1:20:34] so matthew henry said the country people
[1:20:36] retired for safety into jericho
[1:20:38] they left their barns fields all that
[1:20:40] was in them which served for the
[1:20:42] substance of this great army
[1:20:44] and the supply came very seasonally for
[1:20:47] after
[1:20:48] the passover they were able to keep the
[1:20:49] feast of unleavened bread
[1:20:51] which they could not do according to the
[1:20:52] appointment when they had nothing but
[1:20:54] manna to live upon
[1:20:57] right they just had manna they didn't
[1:20:59] have
[1:21:00] the bread from the corn right and
[1:21:03] perhaps this was one reason why it was
[1:21:05] intermittent in the wilderness but now
[1:21:08] they find old corn enough in the barns
[1:21:10] of the canaanites
[1:21:11] to supply them plentiful for that
[1:21:14] occasion
[1:21:15] see they didn't have corn to keep
[1:21:17] unleavened bread see god wasn't
[1:21:19] requiring them to do those
[1:21:21] the unleavened bread in the in the
[1:21:22] wilderness because they didn't have the
[1:21:24] corn
[1:21:25] right but see now god has provided the
[1:21:29] corn
[1:21:29] and now they can keep the word amen
[1:21:32] hallelujah god's not asking you to do
[1:21:34] something that he's that he hasn't
[1:21:36] provided for you to do
[1:21:38] if god wants you to do something he'll
[1:21:40] provide the ability
[1:21:41] the funds the resources the attitude
[1:21:45] and the time and the energy amen
[1:21:49] he never asked them to do something that
[1:21:51] they couldn't do
[1:21:53] they just had to do it right they just
[1:21:55] had to go out and get the corn right
[1:21:58] god has a way to do it praise god by
[1:22:01] fear he drives out all the
[1:22:03] canaanites and the farmers run into the
[1:22:05] city of jericho
[1:22:06] and all the food just said how much food
[1:22:08] would they need saints
[1:22:09] how much food would they need for about
[1:22:11] two million israelites
[1:22:14] can imagine just imagine all the fields
[1:22:16] and all the
[1:22:17] all the granaries maybe i'll say like
[1:22:18] that to feed all these kids
[1:22:22] all these all these men and women these
[1:22:24] old men
[1:22:25] you know young men young women how much
[1:22:27] food would they need
[1:22:28] but god must have had great fields of
[1:22:30] corn all scattered right
[1:22:32] right over jordan right right by gilgal
[1:22:35] so they could just
[1:22:35] walk in enjoy one at a time that's how
[1:22:38] it is all you gotta do church is open up
[1:22:39] our bible we're gonna pour out some
[1:22:41] great blessings
[1:22:42] it's so close to us it's right by our
[1:22:44] desk amen
[1:22:45] it's right by our bed table right right
[1:22:47] right by your bedside table there
[1:22:49] you just gotta reach in and pull out the
[1:22:51] blessings they're waiting for you
[1:22:53] god wants to encourage you he wants to
[1:22:55] feed you praise god
[1:22:57] amen just laying right there
[1:23:01] now i read this quote to you last time i
[1:23:02] preached you a couple of sundays ago
[1:23:06] he's talking to spiritual canaanites the
[1:23:08] spiritual israel who's possessed the
[1:23:10] land
[1:23:10] aren't you glad you've come out of
[1:23:12] egypt's garlic
[1:23:14] aren't you glad you're out of the
[1:23:15] wilderness and remember they had to eat
[1:23:17] manna angels food out of heaven
[1:23:19] until they crossed over into the land
[1:23:21] and when they were crossed over in the
[1:23:23] land the manna ceased to fall
[1:23:25] they were fully matured then and they
[1:23:27] eat the old corn of the land
[1:23:31] now now that you're not babies anymore
[1:23:34] now that you're not desiring the sincere
[1:23:36] sincere milk of the gospel
[1:23:37] that you don't have to be babied and
[1:23:39] patted and persuaded to come to church
[1:23:41] now that you're real fully matured
[1:23:44] christians
[1:23:44] you're ready to eat strong meats now
[1:23:48] you're ready to come into something amen
[1:23:52] they were coming into their inheritance
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:55] they were coming into their future homes
[1:23:57] on the earth praise god
[1:23:59] right that's what they were coming into
[1:24:00] where am i going to live am i going to
[1:24:02] live near the water so am i going to
[1:24:03] live near the mountains
[1:24:04] caleb had a mountain amen where am i
[1:24:07] going to live your lord show me where
[1:24:09] i'm going
[1:24:10] i'm ready to come into something i want
[1:24:12] a permanent possession
[1:24:13] i want to dwell on the land i want to do
[1:24:15] something for god
[1:24:17] amen he said there now here's for us
[1:24:20] you're ready to understand something
[1:24:22] that's deep
[1:24:24] and rich the church many times we just
[1:24:26] forget to
[1:24:27] remember all the great revelations god
[1:24:29] has given us
[1:24:31] right like when brother dennis was here
[1:24:33] last week the holy spirit brought to my
[1:24:34] rem memory that
[1:24:36] uh that that sermon that he preached
[1:24:37] about the the workers of iniquity
[1:24:40] a false sense of security remember that
[1:24:43] i never seen that revelation before
[1:24:46] where on the day of judgment the workers
[1:24:48] of iniquity go up to jesus and said have
[1:24:50] we not cast out devils
[1:24:51] have we not done all these wonderful
[1:24:52] works and jesus said i never knew you
[1:24:54] depart for me that work iniquity
[1:24:56] but they went into the primes of jesus
[1:24:59] with a false sense of security
[1:25:01] well because i had a couple miracles i
[1:25:03] must be accepted
[1:25:04] that's a false sense of security right
[1:25:07] their lives were living in iniquity
[1:25:09] their daily life would have told them if
[1:25:11] they looked at their daily life
[1:25:13] it would have told them what jesus would
[1:25:14] have said not just one thing
[1:25:17] not just a couple of miracles here and
[1:25:18] there but their daily living
[1:25:20] our daily lives tells us what jesus is
[1:25:23] going to say to us
[1:25:24] praise god right our daily life whatever
[1:25:27] kind of works we're doing
[1:25:28] we should be doing works of holiness
[1:25:30] amen we should be doing works of prayers
[1:25:33] works of fasting works of all giving we
[1:25:35] should be doing the works of the holy
[1:25:37] spirit
[1:25:38] and then jesus will say you're a worker
[1:25:40] of righteousness amen
[1:25:42] amen nobody get that they had a false
[1:25:45] sense of security
[1:25:46] because they had a few miracles here a
[1:25:47] few miracles there a few supernatural
[1:25:49] things well i know the holy spirit came
[1:25:51] upon me here but it didn't come upon
[1:25:52] them when they were committing
[1:25:53] iniquities
[1:25:55] every day right
[1:25:59] so see that's coming into something deep
[1:26:01] with understanding now
[1:26:04] right we're coming into something that's
[1:26:07] more uh
[1:26:08] more understanding more knowledge
[1:26:11] and this should separate us from just a
[1:26:13] justified or sanctified saint which we
[1:26:15] thank god for those two works
[1:26:17] but it should make us desire to move
[1:26:19] into the baptism the holy ghost
[1:26:21] to find our position and be effective at
[1:26:24] what god has called us to do
[1:26:26] we'll get to that eventually where they
[1:26:28] they were you know first all those
[1:26:30] brothers had to drive out all these
[1:26:31] kings
[1:26:32] and then they started placing all the
[1:26:33] families you know i think all the
[1:26:35] sisters waited on the other side of the
[1:26:36] river i think if i'm not mistaken
[1:26:38] i think they had to wait on the other
[1:26:39] side of the river some i know some of
[1:26:41] the tribes did two and a half of the
[1:26:42] tribes did
[1:26:44] but others were waiting there too until
[1:26:45] uh they drove out more uh
[1:26:47] the inhabitants and then they could
[1:26:48] start replacing now you can have peace
[1:26:50] there
[1:26:51] now you can be a like brother i said now
[1:26:52] you can be a cattle raiser
[1:26:54] now you can be a shepherd there now you
[1:26:56] can be a corn raiser now i can grow your
[1:26:58] wheat
[1:26:59] see god has something for us to do how
[1:27:01] many want to know what god's called him
[1:27:02] to do
[1:27:03] oh god we'll show you praise god just
[1:27:05] get in that land amen
[1:27:07] just be in that land be faithful in that
[1:27:09] land and god will lead you and guide you
[1:27:11] into your inheritance and your
[1:27:13] possession amen
[1:27:14] hallelujah see a real christian mature
[1:27:18] you're ready to understand something
[1:27:20] deep and rich
[1:27:21] he says been hidden since the foundation
[1:27:23] of the world
[1:27:25] now of course that when he was preaching
[1:27:26] this in 1960 that was how your names
[1:27:28] were on the lamb's book of life before
[1:27:30] the foundation work in other words god
[1:27:31] chose you
[1:27:32] god had four knowledge that you'd want
[1:27:34] to be saved and filled with the holy
[1:27:35] ghost so he put your name on the lamb's
[1:27:37] book of life
[1:27:38] before the foundation of the world and
[1:27:39] the church said amen that's the deep and
[1:27:41] rich thing he was getting into amen
[1:27:43] in other words god knew i was coming he
[1:27:45] knew when i was coming
[1:27:47] and he made a way to save me once i was
[1:27:48] here and he made a way for me to reach
[1:27:51] my future home
[1:27:52] to live with christ eternally
[1:27:56] oh thank you lord
[1:27:59] so they eat the old corn brother adam
[1:28:02] uses this to show the maturity of the
[1:28:04] born-again believer
[1:28:07] and what is maturity for us maturity is
[1:28:10] judging right and wrong and obeying
[1:28:14] the word we saw it on wednesday remember
[1:28:17] wednesday we looked at two scriptures
[1:28:19] both of them showed how god finishes and
[1:28:21] reveals mysteries
[1:28:23] but the whole purpose of them is so you
[1:28:25] obey the word of god
[1:28:27] think about think about this week any
[1:28:29] scripture you're having trouble obeying
[1:28:30] this week
[1:28:32] that's where you gotta that's where
[1:28:33] today you should seek help for that
[1:28:34] today
[1:28:36] right because the reason the mysteries
[1:28:37] were open so that we could have
[1:28:39] access to knowledge right and jesus said
[1:28:42] knowledge is a key
[1:28:44] knowledge is a light he said knowledge
[1:28:46] is a fragrance paul said that
[1:28:48] so whatever we have need of that mystery
[1:28:51] opens up the door then we can walk in
[1:28:53] and possess
[1:28:54] whatever we have need of
[1:28:57] oh you didn't have any struggles this
[1:28:58] week what how come you don't have a body
[1:29:00] change then
[1:29:01] how come you're here you should actually
[1:29:03] be in heaven right now you should be at
[1:29:05] the meeting in the air right
[1:29:06] am i right church yeah then you're
[1:29:09] perfect
[1:29:12] right so so see we all have
[1:29:15] something right we all have something we
[1:29:17] can see god and say lord i really need
[1:29:19] your help i really need to surrender
[1:29:20] here
[1:29:22] this is the area of my life i need to
[1:29:24] surrender and i need to
[1:29:25] get more victory over this praise god
[1:29:30] because we're constantly judging right
[1:29:33] and wrong
[1:29:34] see once we pass the test satan waits
[1:29:35] for a little bit he leaves for a season
[1:29:37] right he studies us
[1:29:39] waits a couple days a couple weeks oh i
[1:29:41] see they're getting a little weak there
[1:29:43] maybe it's in their diet maybe it's in
[1:29:46] their
[1:29:46] relationships maybe it's in uh what
[1:29:49] they're putting before their eyes maybe
[1:29:50] it's in their conversations their
[1:29:52] friendships and then he'll
[1:29:53] create this snare right the bible said a
[1:29:55] snare he said snares and traps
[1:29:57] to see if he can get us to sin
[1:30:00] right so yeah there's times we're
[1:30:01] rejoicing oh we don't feel satan's great
[1:30:04] attacks
[1:30:04] but be be careful be ready he's setting
[1:30:07] up a trap
[1:30:09] and he wants to try to get us to disobey
[1:30:11] the word of the lord
[1:30:13] right so he can make the church an old
[1:30:15] lump
[1:30:16] he can make it feel dead and cold but
[1:30:19] paul said purge it out
[1:30:20] so you can be a new lump
[1:30:23] well that makes me happy amen that makes
[1:30:25] me happy then all
[1:30:27] it takes is people just confessing their
[1:30:29] sins every week
[1:30:30] and we can feel like a brand new church
[1:30:32] amen
[1:30:36] oh hallelujah
[1:30:39] okay so brother brahm says okay when
[1:30:41] you're eating the old corn
[1:30:42] you don't need baby to come to church
[1:30:44] well that means you don't need baby to
[1:30:45] read your bible
[1:30:47] don't need baby to pray
[1:30:50] right we can add more on to that right
[1:30:53] fasting
[1:30:55] right cause i know people that are in
[1:30:57] the message and they've never fasted
[1:30:59] before
[1:31:00] well if that's true then i know people
[1:31:01] in the message that have never given
[1:31:03] alms before
[1:31:05] or never really prayed before well
[1:31:07] that's the whole point of christianity
[1:31:09] right to
[1:31:09] fast pray give alms to be a real
[1:31:11] christian
[1:31:13] and people are in the message but
[1:31:14] haven't done what the message tells them
[1:31:16] to do
[1:31:18] so see they haven't judged these initial
[1:31:21] things right
[1:31:22] and what that shows they're not mature
[1:31:24] christians
[1:31:26] right because a mature christian judges
[1:31:27] all these things
[1:31:29] and then he obeys the word of the lord
[1:31:32] amen praise god
[1:31:36] i think i'm getting somewhere i hope i'm
[1:31:37] getting somewhere by god's grace
[1:31:40] hope you're seeing this now this is the
[1:31:42] most
[1:31:43] to me the most important scripture about
[1:31:45] strong meat
[1:31:47] so what's our diet is our diet just mana
[1:31:50] just honey cakes from heaven or you can
[1:31:54] just you can just walk out you could
[1:31:55] have walked outside in the morning
[1:31:56] right outside of your tent i imagine
[1:31:58] some of us would have been so lazy
[1:32:00] we just want to open up the tent reached
[1:32:01] out and grab it
[1:32:03] close the door oh that's great
[1:32:08] right some of us would have been so lazy
[1:32:11] i wasn't planning on doing that but
[1:32:14] that's how simple it was to get a meal
[1:32:16] under sanctification
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:20] you just had to come to church brother
[1:32:21] amen and your eyes are everything the
[1:32:23] preacher said
[1:32:25] you're just you're blown away by
[1:32:27] everything
[1:32:28] under sanctification right
[1:32:32] and when you first get the holy ghost my
[1:32:34] these ripe these ripe fruits are right
[1:32:36] there but there comes a season when
[1:32:38] you're born again
[1:32:40] all that runs out
[1:32:43] oh okay now you have to do some work
[1:32:48] you can't just reach out your door
[1:32:51] okay i'm i'm so satisfied
[1:32:55] no you got to put some hard work into it
[1:33:00] and that's where people start falling
[1:33:01] away right they don't want to give any
[1:33:04] diligence
[1:33:04] they don't want to give any human effort
[1:33:07] oh you're preaching legalism and you're
[1:33:09] no jesus said or paul said give all
[1:33:11] diligence
[1:33:12] and jesus christ said love the lord your
[1:33:14] god with all your strength
[1:33:17] amen see people get born again and they
[1:33:21] enjoy these mature fruits my
[1:33:24] but if they're not careful if they don't
[1:33:25] keep investing in their walk with the
[1:33:27] lord
[1:33:28] they're going to feel starving and like
[1:33:29] what
[1:33:31] man i'm starving i thought i was born
[1:33:33] again you are
[1:33:34] you just got to invest and you got to
[1:33:36] plant some seeds
[1:33:38] praise god you got to go back and eat
[1:33:41] some of that
[1:33:41] stored up uh winter food can i say like
[1:33:44] that
[1:33:45] what do they call that the canned foods
[1:33:46] you got you got to eat your canned foods
[1:33:48] that you stored up
[1:33:49] you got to eat some of that stored up
[1:33:51] you got to press play
[1:33:53] praise god even now they do it all the
[1:33:55] time which is not right
[1:33:58] as far as like they take the place of
[1:34:00] real preachers that's wrong that breaks
[1:34:01] the word of god
[1:34:03] but see people think oh my i thought i
[1:34:05] was eating a mature word you are
[1:34:08] but you've got to invest that's part of
[1:34:10] your labor
[1:34:11] that's part of your victory amen
[1:34:14] where you don't have to have everything
[1:34:16] handed to you god don't have to hand
[1:34:18] everything so easy for you he'll let you
[1:34:20] struggle there'll be a couple of times
[1:34:21] where it looks like everything's going
[1:34:23] to fall apart
[1:34:24] there's no rain how my crops going to
[1:34:26] make it and god wants to see that you're
[1:34:28] mature
[1:34:28] if god called me out of egypt and
[1:34:30] brought me this land he's going to send
[1:34:32] rain to this land amen
[1:34:34] i'm going to trust god he brought me
[1:34:36] that far i'm a mature christian
[1:34:38] i'm not a baby god will provide for me
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:45] i'm going to come expecting to the house
[1:34:47] of god i'm going to be fed today
[1:34:49] the bible says strong meat is
[1:34:50] nourishment
[1:34:53] right nourishment christians need
[1:34:56] nourishment they need all the vitamins
[1:34:58] right they need all the minerals
[1:35:01] paul said there's some christians all
[1:35:02] they drink is milk and they're not
[1:35:04] getting nourishment to grow the strong
[1:35:06] muscles
[1:35:08] and to really grow into what a christian
[1:35:11] should grow into
[1:35:13] not a baby right not a complainer
[1:35:17] not a backbiter right not an incontinent
[1:35:20] person who has no self-control
[1:35:22] that's not a real christian that might
[1:35:24] be a baby christian right but see a real
[1:35:28] christian is able to have confidence in
[1:35:30] the things of god
[1:35:31] and feast on the strong meat of the word
[1:35:35] so paul says there's a time when you
[1:35:38] should be a teacher of the word
[1:35:40] now especially this is good for the
[1:35:41] parents right there comes a time when
[1:35:43] the parents
[1:35:44] have to start teaching the word of god
[1:35:46] you can't wait to every sunday to the
[1:35:48] pastor to do it or the ministers your
[1:35:51] children are going to ask you questions
[1:35:52] in the home
[1:35:53] and the parents said amen there's a
[1:35:55] couple events
[1:35:57] see you've got to teach again the first
[1:36:01] principles of the oracles of god now
[1:36:02] remember he goes through the first
[1:36:03] principles in just a few scriptures
[1:36:07] and i've become such as that need of
[1:36:08] milk and not a strong me so
[1:36:10] the time had passed where these adults
[1:36:12] should have been able to handle the
[1:36:13] deeper things of god
[1:36:15] like the anointed ones of the end time
[1:36:18] like soul body spirit
[1:36:20] like the mystery of christ in you the
[1:36:21] hope of glory like the rapture mystery
[1:36:23] right all these great
[1:36:25] mysteries right like mystery babylon all
[1:36:28] these mysteries
[1:36:29] but they can't even handle the initial
[1:36:30] things of getting like salvation and
[1:36:32] divine healing they can't even handle
[1:36:34] these things
[1:36:36] paul says because they haven't kept the
[1:36:38] nourishment they're not
[1:36:39] feeding on the word of god that they
[1:36:41] should
[1:36:44] for everyone that uses milk everyone
[1:36:46] that just stays on justification
[1:36:48] justification
[1:36:49] get saved get saved get healed get
[1:36:51] healed anyone that just stays on that
[1:36:53] is unskillful in the word of god brother
[1:36:56] brahms i just heard him say yesterday he
[1:36:58] said
[1:36:58] you cannot major on a minor
[1:37:03] now we thank god for divine healing but
[1:37:04] we can i see i hear a lot of churches
[1:37:06] majoring on divine healing
[1:37:08] just saying like the presence of god is
[1:37:09] here that's true
[1:37:11] but at some point the bible says you got
[1:37:13] to move past that right
[1:37:15] you can you focus on it when you need it
[1:37:18] but at some point you got to move
[1:37:20] on into the deeper things of god
[1:37:23] that's hard for some people to swallow
[1:37:24] but it's true
[1:37:27] see and an unskillful person is
[1:37:29] inexperienced
[1:37:30] so a preacher or someone that should be
[1:37:32] a teacher if they
[1:37:34] can't take you to these things of god
[1:37:35] then they haven't experienced the deep
[1:37:37] things of god
[1:37:38] but once you're in the deep things of
[1:37:40] god you've had that experience
[1:37:42] and you can take other people there
[1:37:43] praise god
[1:37:45] when simon came to our church years and
[1:37:47] years ago he said i was dying
[1:37:48] spiritually
[1:37:49] he said brother jesse he said your
[1:37:50] ministry nursed me back to health
[1:37:53] he said and cam when cam was here he
[1:37:55] said he said brother god was anointing
[1:37:57] you so much he said
[1:37:58] he said god wouldn't even i wouldn't
[1:38:00] even cam said i even felt the anointing
[1:38:02] when you preached on money like usually
[1:38:04] that's not like a topic you would feel
[1:38:05] like
[1:38:06] there's a great anointing my brother cam
[1:38:07] would laugh and joke and say even when
[1:38:09] you preach on money and ties and
[1:38:10] offerings and
[1:38:11] managing your money he said i felt the
[1:38:13] anointing there
[1:38:16] and how many people have we had come in
[1:38:17] the church and just they would leave us
[1:38:19] i remember brother peter remember
[1:38:21] different brothers we've had through and
[1:38:22] they said
[1:38:23] this was such an oasis for us our church
[1:38:27] was such an oasis
[1:38:28] because they were able to come in get
[1:38:29] fed the word of god get strengthened
[1:38:31] or get healed and then god was able to
[1:38:33] send them on to their destiny
[1:38:36] and i just wanted to be a faithful
[1:38:38] shepherd while i was here while they
[1:38:39] were here
[1:38:40] i just wanted to faithfully feed them
[1:38:41] the meat of the word
[1:38:44] praise god we had even had a brother
[1:38:45] here that was a seven thunders brother
[1:38:48] and he's and he was like wow brothers
[1:38:51] he said i've never heard preaching like
[1:38:53] that he said i love to preach in the
[1:38:55] ministry
[1:38:56] and they kind of worship you know joseph
[1:38:58] coleman but even coming to archers he
[1:39:00] was up clapping and singing song
[1:39:01] specials and just
[1:39:02] enjoying the prince of the lord because
[1:39:05] you have to exp
[1:39:06] when you experience the promised land
[1:39:07] you can tell others about it amen
[1:39:11] because you're experiencing it praise
[1:39:13] god and the word has made you live a
[1:39:15] righteous life
[1:39:18] but unskillful brothers and preachers
[1:39:20] haven't lived that they haven't
[1:39:22] experienced that so their preaching
[1:39:24] doesn't produce
[1:39:25] the righteous life they're babes behind
[1:39:27] the pulpit can you imagine a baby coming
[1:39:29] up
[1:39:30] zion coming up to preach to us today
[1:39:34] he'd probably do this first he get his
[1:39:35] tongue out and thing
[1:39:37] because that's what he does when he's
[1:39:38] real happy and we'd be waiting there for
[1:39:41] the word okay come on preach it preacher
[1:39:42] come on amen
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:48] that's what the bible calls a babe
[1:39:51] when they just center on these
[1:39:53] elementary teachings
[1:39:56] now what are they
[1:40:00] strong meat belongs to them who are full
[1:40:02] age even those
[1:40:04] who by reason of use have their senses
[1:40:06] exercised
[1:40:07] to discern both good and evil so a
[1:40:10] mature christian just has this sense
[1:40:12] you know we used to watch uh comic books
[1:40:15] we used to read comic books and watch
[1:40:16] movies when i was on the world
[1:40:17] do you remember spider-man had that
[1:40:19] spider sense do you remember
[1:40:20] that i don't know if you guys are
[1:40:21] watching i'm about shame to say it but
[1:40:23] anytime there's like one of those bad
[1:40:25] guys coming he'd have this like this
[1:40:26] spider sense
[1:40:28] and like right the last moment right
[1:40:29] before he got hit he'd able to turn and
[1:40:31] block it or you know
[1:40:32] shoot the web out or something like that
[1:40:34] he had that sense where he could just
[1:40:36] sense evil coming and that's what the
[1:40:38] christian has amen
[1:40:40] they actually got that from jesus
[1:40:41] because jesus just he discerned all
[1:40:43] their
[1:40:44] all their tricks right they try to trick
[1:40:45] him with the question what do you say
[1:40:46] about caesar
[1:40:47] what do you say about healing on the
[1:40:49] sabbath and jesus would sense it he'd
[1:40:51] sense that and said i see you reason in
[1:40:53] your heart
[1:40:54] you're a hypocrite amen and you give
[1:40:56] them the right answer and then they'd
[1:40:57] have no more questions
[1:40:59] so just like jesus had that sense that's
[1:41:02] what we have
[1:41:03] it's the holy ghost the holy ghost is
[1:41:05] able to discern is this good
[1:41:07] or is this evil that's a real christian
[1:41:09] amen that's a real mature christian
[1:41:11] is when you can just get the sense i'm
[1:41:14] sensing this as evil
[1:41:15] i'm sensing something's not right or i'm
[1:41:17] sensing this as god
[1:41:19] i feel the blessing of god amen sensing
[1:41:22] good
[1:41:23] sensing evil
[1:41:28] i've learned that all these superheroes
[1:41:29] all they do is impersonate jesus that's
[1:41:31] all
[1:41:32] if you roll up all those superheroes
[1:41:33] even wonder woman if you
[1:41:35] you take all them roam up into one
[1:41:37] that's jesus
[1:41:39] right jesus can do everything he can fly
[1:41:42] he can you know he could
[1:41:44] he goes up to heaven and they just copy
[1:41:46] jesus
[1:41:47] he's the great mighty god right
[1:41:50] so here's what the babes do behind the
[1:41:53] pulpit
[1:41:55] therefore leaving the principles of
[1:41:56] doctrine of christ let us go on to
[1:41:58] perfection
[1:41:59] not laying again the foundation of
[1:42:01] repentance from dead works
[1:42:02] and faith toward god so a milk
[1:42:06] preacher will just focus on just getting
[1:42:08] saved and repenting
[1:42:10] and having peace with god right just
[1:42:12] believe god just trust god now most
[1:42:14] churches do that and
[1:42:15] that are not in the message right
[1:42:18] they just want to get saved i've seen
[1:42:19] i've seen the remember went through
[1:42:20] those false prophets that minute that
[1:42:22] little series there a lot of those
[1:42:24] pastors said
[1:42:25] that if you want a deeper experience
[1:42:27] with god he they said leave our church
[1:42:28] our church is the safe sinners
[1:42:31] i've i've seen them i've seen them say
[1:42:33] that on youtube
[1:42:35] that proves without a shadow of a doubt
[1:42:37] they're baby preachers
[1:42:40] at the best at the best
[1:42:43] if they're not deceivers of men
[1:42:46] right at the very best they're feeding
[1:42:49] the people milk
[1:42:50] right but probably injecting some false
[1:42:52] things in there
[1:42:54] right so if you just stay on just repent
[1:42:58] get saved just believe god just believe
[1:43:00] god if you just stay on that long enough
[1:43:02] you'll be a baby next
[1:43:05] what else is next i believe there were
[1:43:07] six doctrines right one
[1:43:08] two three four five okay
[1:43:11] five let me go back
[1:43:15] repentance from dead works oh there is
[1:43:17] six repentance faith toward god
[1:43:20] baptisms laying on of hands resurrection
[1:43:22] of the dead
[1:43:23] eternal judgment six six six number of
[1:43:26] man
[1:43:28] you gotta leave the number of man and go
[1:43:29] up into the the heavenlies
[1:43:31] heavenly places right next
[1:43:34] baptism this is what we said with moses
[1:43:36] and joshua there are two baptisms amen
[1:43:41] right there's the baptism of water and
[1:43:44] there's the baptism of the spirit
[1:43:46] that needs to be taught now look how
[1:43:47] many churches are falling short on this
[1:43:49] i'm talking about outside the message
[1:43:50] think about that
[1:43:51] almost every church almost every church
[1:43:54] outside the message
[1:43:56] fails right there at the best they're
[1:43:58] giving them milk when they walk in
[1:44:01] what if you sisters would have woke up
[1:44:02] this morning and just put
[1:44:04] cups of milk at the table for your hubby
[1:44:06] for your children
[1:44:08] what would they have told you maokai
[1:44:10] lydia what have you told me if i would
[1:44:11] just place milk before this morning
[1:44:12] what would you have said i'm hungry
[1:44:17] you don't think these people going to
[1:44:18] churches are like i'm hungry so what
[1:44:20] does satan do satan gives them like
[1:44:21] riches right
[1:44:22] he gives them he tickles their ears oh
[1:44:24] you can do this
[1:44:26] oh you can be married again see in order
[1:44:28] to distract them away that they're just
[1:44:30] drinking milk he gives them the lust of
[1:44:32] their flesh that's what the bible said
[1:44:34] it will tickle their itching ears
[1:44:37] but give them unrighteousness now don't
[1:44:40] get me wrong i'm thankful for the milk
[1:44:41] when i'm thirsty
[1:44:42] i really like some water i like some
[1:44:44] liquid right when you
[1:44:46] but but there comes a time where lydia's
[1:44:48] now 16 and she said
[1:44:49] daddy i'm hungry don't give me milk
[1:44:52] give me something to eat praise god
[1:44:54] right and that's what that is so most
[1:44:56] churches don't even have
[1:44:59] anything more than milk now here it is
[1:45:02] laying on of hands
[1:45:04] we should lay hands on the sick thank
[1:45:06] god and thank god they recover praise
[1:45:08] god
[1:45:10] we should teach that the dead will be
[1:45:12] resurrected and have to give judgment at
[1:45:14] the white throne
[1:45:15] we should teach that praise god we
[1:45:17] should the bible said warn all men
[1:45:19] amen of the judgment to come praise god
[1:45:22] and save some
[1:45:23] pulling them out of the fire the bible
[1:45:25] said we should teach of eternal judgment
[1:45:28] not eternal punishment but eternal
[1:45:30] judgment those souls will be judged
[1:45:32] eternally
[1:45:34] but they won't suffer eternally they'll
[1:45:37] be annihilated praise god
[1:45:38] we should teach that but once we've
[1:45:40] taught it
[1:45:41] then he said we should move on we should
[1:45:44] leave those principles and go
[1:45:46] on to deeper things of god
[1:45:49] i like this this we will do if god
[1:45:51] permit that means if god instructs
[1:45:54] in other words god is the only one who
[1:45:56] can raise our instruction for the people
[1:45:58] in other words god knows what you have
[1:46:00] need of and when you have need of it god
[1:46:02] will raise the standard
[1:46:03] he'll start preaching deeper to us
[1:46:06] hallelujah that takes the pressure off
[1:46:08] me
[1:46:08] amen i mean i want to live higher myself
[1:46:11] but we can only go higher
[1:46:12] all of us can only go higher if god
[1:46:15] allows it
[1:46:16] which means we understand these we're
[1:46:18] enjoying the blessings of them we're
[1:46:20] living off them
[1:46:21] and but we want more we're hungry
[1:46:24] if i can quote lydia i'm a hungry
[1:46:26] preacher
[1:46:27] right that's what i should feel when i
[1:46:29] come up here i should feel hungry souls
[1:46:31] i just want me to preach god's word and
[1:46:33] give them something meaning to chew on
[1:46:35] amen
[1:46:36] they're so hungry uh i'm hungry i got to
[1:46:39] have
[1:46:40] more i want more of a relationship with
[1:46:42] christ i want to grow deeper in my
[1:46:44] understanding of jesus
[1:46:45] amen glory i
[1:46:48] should feel your hunger and you should
[1:46:50] feel my hunger too praise god
[1:46:52] that's that right remember in the next
[1:46:55] verse hebrews 6 4 i'm just going to
[1:46:56] briefly just read it
[1:46:58] what are the deep things here's one of
[1:47:01] them
[1:47:01] the anointed ones at the end time
[1:47:03] hebrews 6 4. i don't have it on my slide
[1:47:06] i forgot to put up there
[1:47:13] for it is impossible for those who were
[1:47:15] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:47:17] heavenly gift
[1:47:17] and were made partakers of the holy
[1:47:19] ghost and have tasted the good word
[1:47:24] sorry i was just checking the time there
[1:47:26] tasted the good word of god
[1:47:28] and the powers of the world to come
[1:47:31] if they shall fall away to renew them
[1:47:34] again
[1:47:35] unto repentance seeing they crucified to
[1:47:36] themselves the son of god afresh
[1:47:39] and put him to an open shame
[1:47:44] so what are these deep things brother
[1:47:46] jesse
[1:47:48] they're the revelations of god that god
[1:47:49] brought us through brother branham
[1:47:51] these mysteries right the mystery of the
[1:47:55] anointed ones the end time comes out of
[1:47:57] the mystery of the kingdom of heaven
[1:47:59] because that's where jesus tells it in
[1:48:00] matthew 13.
[1:48:03] he said the rain fell on the tears and
[1:48:05] the rain fell on the wheat
[1:48:08] but both eventually manifest which one
[1:48:10] it was
[1:48:12] and then harvest time came and he said
[1:48:14] separate those tares
[1:48:16] bind those tares in their world
[1:48:17] ecumenical system
[1:48:19] but gather my wheat to the meeting in
[1:48:21] the air
[1:48:22] amen it's a mystery
[1:48:25] praise god that's what jesus says there
[1:48:27] as i'm sorry that's what paul says there
[1:48:29] now go down here let's not forget this
[1:48:30] this is beautiful
[1:48:33] verse 9 but beloved we're persuaded
[1:48:35] better things of you and things that
[1:48:37] accompany salvation
[1:48:38] through though thus we speak for god is
[1:48:40] not unrighteous to forget your work
[1:48:43] and labor of your love which you have
[1:48:45] showed toward his name
[1:48:46] in that yet minister to the saints and
[1:48:48] do minister
[1:48:50] see now that's the trouble too a lot of
[1:48:51] people don't minister to other people
[1:48:55] we have to minister to other people we
[1:48:57] have to minister to the saints we have
[1:49:00] to help one another out
[1:49:03] see that see sometimes we get so busy
[1:49:05] doing
[1:49:06] our own thing we forget about
[1:49:07] ministering to the saints that
[1:49:09] might mean like jose sending prayer
[1:49:11] cloths to other countries that might
[1:49:13] mean that
[1:49:15] right or getting groceries for your mom
[1:49:17] or dad or something like that or
[1:49:19] caring for your father like sister
[1:49:21] havardic's been doing right caring for
[1:49:22] you
[1:49:22] is your dad are you still taking care of
[1:49:24] your dad sister bless your heart bless
[1:49:25] your
[1:49:27] that's what jesus would want you to do
[1:49:29] praise god brother man told us that
[1:49:31] if your parents took care of you when
[1:49:32] you were young take care of your parents
[1:49:34] when they're old
[1:49:36] that's ministering to someone that's
[1:49:38] serving someone else's needs praise god
[1:49:42] so see paul tells him god's not going to
[1:49:45] forget
[1:49:46] how you minister to other people
[1:49:49] verse 11 and we desire that every one of
[1:49:51] you do show the same diligence there it
[1:49:53] is
[1:49:54] diligence you're not a baby
[1:49:57] god's not going to just drop off honey
[1:49:59] bread from heaven all the time
[1:50:02] you've got to take the word believe that
[1:50:05] promised seed
[1:50:06] go plant that seed and water that seed
[1:50:09] and let it stay there
[1:50:11] until it produces fruit praise god
[1:50:14] amen god wants you to receive that
[1:50:18] promise
[1:50:18] believe that promise quote that promise
[1:50:21] and one day
[1:50:22] you'll receive a harvest a plenty for
[1:50:24] harvest one day
[1:50:26] you'll see the fruits of that word
[1:50:27] praise god
[1:50:29] amen you're not a baby gotta have a
[1:50:32] supernatural experience every day
[1:50:35] that's what they had every day every day
[1:50:38] i wonder if some of them would peak
[1:50:39] outside to see
[1:50:40] when they fell every day they had to
[1:50:43] have that under sanctification
[1:50:46] but when they come in the promised land
[1:50:48] you got to be mature now
[1:50:50] you got to work the land you got to be
[1:50:52] diligent
[1:50:53] you have to trust that the god who
[1:50:55] brought you through all those
[1:50:56] steps he's going to be with you in this
[1:50:58] step
[1:51:00] he's going to help you fulfill your your
[1:51:04] destiny 9
[1:51:07] show diligence verse 11 to the full
[1:51:09] assurance of
[1:51:10] hope unto the end that ye be not
[1:51:14] slothful don't get lazy in the promised
[1:51:16] land
[1:51:17] but followers of them who through faith
[1:51:19] and patience
[1:51:20] inherit the promises faith
[1:51:24] and patience makes you inherit the
[1:51:26] promises of god
[1:51:28] let me close here i've almost gone about
[1:51:29] an hour and a half right
[1:51:33] so give me a set of timer here give me
[1:51:34] ten minutes let me finish up
[1:51:40] now here's where brother ram says this
[1:51:41] now he he brings it down and basically
[1:51:43] says
[1:51:44] this is what denominations do
[1:51:47] they will rally about around one of
[1:51:49] these first principles like repentance
[1:51:51] like that's a good baptist one or the
[1:51:54] baptisms
[1:51:56] that's a good pentecostal one because
[1:51:58] they make it tongues
[1:51:59] they just rally around there's two
[1:52:00] baptisms water and speaking in tongues
[1:52:03] they rally around that see paul says now
[1:52:07] lay all that aside see
[1:52:10] baptism laying on hands thinks but that
[1:52:12] isn't perfection that's only the carnal
[1:52:14] reform
[1:52:17] and that's where the churches leave off
[1:52:18] today is that old carnal reform
[1:52:21] one of them said oh well the water the
[1:52:23] water baptism means this and it means
[1:52:24] that
[1:52:26] so look what brother and is showing us
[1:52:28] churches will die
[1:52:30] and denominate when they just take one
[1:52:32] of these six principles
[1:52:33] and just rally around that and they fail
[1:52:36] to move on
[1:52:38] into the meat of the word
[1:52:43] praise god let me say like this are you
[1:52:46] hungering in your
[1:52:47] personal time with the lord are you
[1:52:49] hungering for a deeper walk with the
[1:52:50] lord
[1:52:51] or have you put it on autopilot
[1:52:55] preacher do my work for me
[1:52:58] oh my neighbor will plant and and weed
[1:53:01] and harvest for me really
[1:53:03] i'm going to move by you so my my
[1:53:05] neighbor will do that for me
[1:53:07] no you got to get out there in the field
[1:53:09] yourself how many sisters got a garden
[1:53:11] you got a garden
[1:53:12] that's right yeah you guys do i know uh
[1:53:14] your mom does a gardener sister have a
[1:53:16] garden too
[1:53:17] you got to get out there yourself or you
[1:53:19] got to pay somebody to get out there
[1:53:21] we send the little ones out there
[1:53:22] sometimes my wife does a great job out
[1:53:24] there
[1:53:25] if you want to if you want to harvest
[1:53:27] you got to get out there and work
[1:53:30] praise god but see churches don't want
[1:53:32] to
[1:53:33] labor and pray anymore oh
[1:53:36] church members don't want to pray like
[1:53:38] they used to pray
[1:53:40] i don't do that too often anymore right
[1:53:43] we don't pray like we used to we don't
[1:53:45] hunger like we used to
[1:53:48] we must show the same diligence if we
[1:53:50] want the same fruits as the old days
[1:53:52] we got to show the same diligence today
[1:53:54] praise god
[1:53:55] amen you're not a baby anymore we're
[1:53:59] just gonna fall out every day
[1:54:01] every day i'm gonna have the bible speak
[1:54:03] to me and i'm gonna just rejoice
[1:54:04] every day i'm gonna see a dream every
[1:54:06] day brother is going to do something
[1:54:08] that i supernatural to me it's not going
[1:54:10] to be every day
[1:54:11] but you've got to work like it is going
[1:54:13] to happen every day
[1:54:15] hallelujah it don't have to happen i'm
[1:54:17] still a child of god i'm still in the
[1:54:19] promised land
[1:54:19] i'm still mature i know it's going to
[1:54:22] happen i know there's going to be a
[1:54:23] harvest someday
[1:54:26] church how many years did god let paul
[1:54:29] sit in that prison how many years and
[1:54:33] paul had already been broken out of
[1:54:34] prison before
[1:54:36] he knew god could break him out of the
[1:54:38] prison if he wanted to
[1:54:39] if he really wanted to he could come
[1:54:42] shake the prison again and bring me out
[1:54:46] but he sat there and he learned this is
[1:54:48] producing something in my life
[1:54:50] this is bringing me to maturity amen
[1:54:54] where i can say for me to live is christ
[1:54:59] to die is christ hallelujah
[1:55:03] so no matter what situation i'm in it's
[1:55:06] always christ amen
[1:55:07] and to die is my gain amen
[1:55:13] church we can't rally around one thing
[1:55:15] most of mostly it's joseph's a prophet
[1:55:17] or brother ram's a prophet of god which
[1:55:18] is true but people rally around that i
[1:55:20] don't believe joseph is a prophet though
[1:55:23] but people will rally around those one
[1:55:25] things and they'll rally there and
[1:55:27] they'll die there
[1:55:28] and when they when they focus on that
[1:55:30] they they just drink the milk
[1:55:32] of that and they never go on into deeper
[1:55:34] things of god
[1:55:35] they can't leave that they stop right
[1:55:38] there
[1:55:38] and they no longer go into the things of
[1:55:40] god how are we going to go deeper in the
[1:55:42] lord
[1:55:43] amen i hope this is helping you by god's
[1:55:45] grace
[1:55:47] but said they set up organizations one
[1:55:50] sprinkles one poor see they're still on
[1:55:52] that
[1:55:53] baptism's doctrine they're still they
[1:55:55] can't even get past that
[1:55:57] thank god we're past that yeah
[1:56:00] that's why i love this church amen
[1:56:02] because i was raised in a church
[1:56:03] they just stayed at the repentance and
[1:56:05] laying on their hands and
[1:56:06] the tongue i was raised in the
[1:56:08] assemblies of god but that church had
[1:56:10] died the denominations died
[1:56:12] but god brought me over he brought me
[1:56:14] over jordan into the promised land
[1:56:16] hallelujah and i'm learning and i'm
[1:56:20] understanding things i never understood
[1:56:22] now that i'm in the word of god
[1:56:24] i'm in the deep and rich things now
[1:56:28] and now we're enjoying the full corn of
[1:56:31] healings and salvations and people being
[1:56:33] filled with the holy ghost
[1:56:34] now we're really enjoying some great
[1:56:36] blessings of god
[1:56:40] hallelujah we're discerning good
[1:56:43] and evil we're able to discern
[1:56:46] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:56:48] this we watch the spirit of god
[1:56:49] raise up a standard against glaucoma
[1:56:52] amen
[1:56:54] against heart disease the spirit of god
[1:56:56] raises up a standard against that
[1:56:58] against idolatry worshiping brother
[1:57:00] branham the spirit of god
[1:57:02] raises up a standard we sense the evil
[1:57:05] and we recognize the good
[1:57:07] and we stay with the good
[1:57:11] see one sprinkles one's forward one's
[1:57:13] backward all those things
[1:57:15] some lay hands on the six some make
[1:57:16] apostles by laying on of hands
[1:57:20] some make prophets and so forth that's
[1:57:21] what they do at the hillsong and the
[1:57:23] bethel churches right
[1:57:24] and pentecostals they i impart to you
[1:57:26] this gift and what if god never gave
[1:57:27] that gift
[1:57:29] then their whole life their life they
[1:57:31] believe a lie and they can never go into
[1:57:33] the meat they can't even keep sin out of
[1:57:34] their lives
[1:57:35] because they're they're just they're
[1:57:36] dead on that on that milk
[1:57:39] that's all they got is milk they're
[1:57:40] hungry but they satan gives them
[1:57:42] something to try to distract them from
[1:57:43] their
[1:57:44] their holy thirst right
[1:57:49] he said making some profits laying on
[1:57:51] our hands preaching the resurrection
[1:57:52] from the dead which is all right
[1:57:53] but the supreme need of christ that's
[1:57:55] all right but all these are formal
[1:57:57] reformations we're just been reforming
[1:57:59] now let's go on to perfection
[1:58:02] you get the picture everybody get the
[1:58:04] picture message churches can do the same
[1:58:07] thing and the church said
[1:58:09] they can rally around one thing and die
[1:58:12] and not go in to spiritual perfection
[1:58:16] i tell you church whoa we will be
[1:58:18] privileged if the lord
[1:58:20] helps us move on all of us now move on
[1:58:23] from elementary things
[1:58:25] help us all move into the deeper things
[1:58:26] of god
[1:58:28] where church not just one or two or
[1:58:30] three or four of us are born again
[1:58:31] but all of us are born again we're all
[1:58:34] ministering to someone
[1:58:36] like i'll say it again sister haverick's
[1:58:37] been taking care of her dad that's her
[1:58:39] ministry there
[1:58:40] he's yeah how how old is he sister
[1:58:43] 83. his health is struggling
[1:58:46] so someone's got a minister someone's
[1:58:49] got to take care of
[1:58:50] him and so god has anointed our sister
[1:58:52] there to minister there
[1:58:54] and be a blessing right so
[1:58:57] our prayer today should be lord who am i
[1:58:59] supposed to minister to
[1:59:00] now our mothers but god made it really
[1:59:03] easy for our mothers amen
[1:59:05] because god gave them precious souls to
[1:59:07] minister to
[1:59:08] to feed them natural feed them spiritual
[1:59:11] remember mom
[1:59:12] brother said you're a preacher i just
[1:59:14] read that quote this morning brother
[1:59:16] i said mother's the first preacher
[1:59:19] she's the first preacher telling the
[1:59:20] word of god right
[1:59:23] so we know our sisters and our fathers
[1:59:25] doing a great job instructing the
[1:59:27] children right
[1:59:28] that's their ministry but if we don't
[1:59:30] have one of those
[1:59:31] we got to have some ministry where god
[1:59:34] is helping us minister like
[1:59:35] like we said prayer clause maybe it's a
[1:59:38] ministry of prayer
[1:59:39] maybe it's a ministry of fasting maybe
[1:59:41] it's a ministry of giving food to the
[1:59:43] poor
[1:59:44] all these are ministries that's what the
[1:59:46] saints do when you're in the promised
[1:59:47] land you're mature
[1:59:48] you know what god's called you to do
[1:59:53] you're not a baby someone's got a baby

[2:00:43] filled with the holy ghost
[2:00:44] and to somehow see uh our church to see
[2:00:47] everybody filled with the holy ghost and
[2:00:49] then to outreach and

[2:00:54] those three things my family our church
[2:00:56] and then i want to i want to
[2:00:57] i just want to do missionary work i and

[2:01:18] i appreciate your patience with me and
[2:01:21] let's go to verse
[2:01:22] 13.
[2:01:25] i want to close with the captain
[2:01:29] of the lord's host
[2:01:32] this is beautiful hallelujah
[2:01:37] at church think about all that joshua's
[2:01:38] been through
[2:01:42] he brought he sent the spies over they
[2:01:44] come back talked about rahab
[2:01:47] he sent the ark before him the waters
[2:01:50] parted
[2:01:50] they come across he circumcised the male
[2:01:53] they keep the feast
[2:01:55] they've had all these glorious times
[2:01:58] and brother baram said one day while
[2:02:02] strolling along in the wilderness
[2:02:05] rocky hilly desert walking around long
[2:02:08] there
[2:02:09] he's seen a man imagine he's just all
[2:02:12] walking all by himself
[2:02:13] all of a sudden he sees a man
[2:02:16] and the man stood and drew his sword
[2:02:18] just like a man
[2:02:20] looked like a man and joshua perhaps
[2:02:23] being a chief warrior
[2:02:25] drew his sword too because that man's
[2:02:27] got a sword drawn that means he's ready
[2:02:29] to attack
[2:02:31] and he walked to meet him and said who
[2:02:32] are you are you for
[2:02:34] us are you for our adversary
[2:02:38] i'm going to read out of verse 13. came
[2:02:40] to pass when joshua's by jericho
[2:02:42] he lifted up his eyes he got closer to
[2:02:44] that big walled city
[2:02:46] oh i like this the closer you get to
[2:02:48] those great
[2:02:49] uh obstacles the closer jesus comes
[2:02:53] amen praise god now look he don't even
[2:02:56] know who this is
[2:02:58] and yet this is the man who's been
[2:03:00] guiding him the whole time amen
[2:03:02] the presence of god was unrecognized
[2:03:05] amen until this moment
[2:03:07] he couldn't even recognize the friends
[2:03:08] of god but as soon as he approaches this
[2:03:10] major battle of his life
[2:03:12] who appears the one who's been guiding
[2:03:14] him the whole life
[2:03:15] the captain of the lord's host comes to
[2:03:18] him physically
[2:03:19] for a personal encounter to remind him
[2:03:22] who's among him amen
[2:03:23] to remind him that he's with him praise
[2:03:25] god
[2:03:27] church as you come to mighty battles
[2:03:28] before your enemies
[2:03:30] god is going to show up in your life how
[2:03:32] many can say amen to that
[2:03:35] when you come before great uh obstacles
[2:03:38] and great giants in your life
[2:03:40] as you approach them and as you've kept
[2:03:42] the feasts
[2:03:43] glory as you've kept the sin out of your
[2:03:45] life amen
[2:03:46] as you've kept the passover as you've
[2:03:49] eaten the unleavened bread of the word
[2:03:51] jesus is going to appear to you and he's
[2:03:53] going to manifest himself to you
[2:03:55] in a new way you might not recognize it
[2:03:58] at first
[2:03:58] but god is going to show himself alive
[2:04:00] and let him know that he's with you
[2:04:02] even in you
[2:04:06] joshua don't even recognize him who is
[2:04:07] this guy who are you
[2:04:12] are you for us are you for our
[2:04:15] adversaries and he said nay
[2:04:17] but as the captain of the host of the
[2:04:19] lord am i now come
[2:04:22] and joshua fell on his face and said
[2:04:24] unto him
[2:04:25] what saith my lord unto his servant
[2:04:29] now this cannot be an angel because
[2:04:31] angels don't take worship
[2:04:35] john fell down to worship the angel he
[2:04:37] said get up get him
[2:04:38] good peter no uh cornelius fell down
[2:04:41] before peter get up cornelius
[2:04:43] right whenever they fall they try to
[2:04:45] worship an angel and he says get up
[2:04:47] worship god
[2:04:50] but joshua falls before this captain and
[2:04:53] says
[2:04:53] lord i like what brother man says
[2:04:57] the man he said look he said the man i
[2:04:59] could see his
[2:05:00] sword high saying no i'm the captain of
[2:05:04] the host of the lord
[2:05:05] the god of israel see he's approaching
[2:05:08] jericho
[2:05:09] and he sees this man with a sword up in
[2:05:11] other words
[2:05:12] now we're ready to fight now's the time
[2:05:16] to draw the sword
[2:05:17] now the word is going to lead you've
[2:05:19] kept all these formalities amen
[2:05:21] you've kept all these feasts you've done
[2:05:23] all these right things
[2:05:24] but now it's the time for the sword to
[2:05:27] go forth
[2:05:27] now's the time for battle and i'm
[2:05:29] leading you into this battle praise god
[2:05:32] amen
[2:05:36] he falls on his face and said lord what
[2:05:39] would you have me to do that's a great
[2:05:40] question we should ask today
[2:05:42] lord it's may 2021 what would you have
[2:05:46] me to do praise god
[2:05:48] who should i minister to your children
[2:05:51] and your wife first if you're a brother
[2:05:53] if your sister your children and your
[2:05:54] husband first
[2:05:58] what would you have me to do
[2:06:03] verse 15 the captain of the lords of

[2:06:07] off thy foot
[2:06:09] for the place where on thou stand this

[2:06:15] says
[2:06:16] when he seen this man what was it it was
[2:06:18] the captain in other words the leader
[2:06:20] of the host of israel and that leader
[2:06:23] was none other
[2:06:25] than christ himself and what was he
[2:06:27] first seen in a pillar of fire
[2:06:30] and now the pillar of fire had become a
[2:06:32] man

[2:06:37] a man god changing his form church

[2:06:44] all by himself

[2:08:25] how do you think joshua felt after
[2:08:26] seeing this guy

[2:08:31] lord
[2:08:32] right he might have been thinking well i
[2:08:34] thought i was the captain moses

[2:11:46] help today the captain of the host of
[2:11:49] the lord
[2:11:49] is here praise god moreover whom he did
[2:11:53] predestinate them he also called

[2:12:08] is on our side today
[2:12:10] who can be against us church let's stand
[2:12:12] to our feet
[2:12:15] church think about the times when you've
[2:12:16] seen the captain of the host of the lord
[2:12:18] we just seen him with vang and who is
[2:12:20] dad right with jose's glaucoma
[2:12:22] we just seen the captain with his sword
[2:12:24] drawn brother johnny you not come up we
[2:12:26] remember we prayed for brother
[2:12:27] jose god heal him of that glaucoma what
[2:12:30] did we see
[2:12:31] we saw the captain of the host with his
[2:12:33] sword pole ready for battle
[2:12:36] archer glad church when you need him
[2:12:39] when you know it when it's when god
[2:12:40] leads you to this battle remember it
[2:12:42] always wasn't battles
[2:12:43] sometimes it was feasts sometimes there
[2:12:46] was days of rest
[2:12:47] rejuvenation healing can i say like that
[2:12:50] healing circumcision
[2:12:51] sometimes there were seasons of healing
[2:12:53] for you sometimes there were seasons of
[2:12:55] rest to remember all the things god had
[2:12:57] done
[2:12:58] but when god brought you to this great
[2:12:59] obstacle then the angel lord himself
[2:13:02] comes
[2:13:03] he pulls a sword and said now it's time
[2:13:04] for battle
[2:13:06] and i'm here to win the battle for you
[2:13:09] if
[2:13:09] we'll let him fight for us how many will
[2:13:11] let the lord fight for you
[2:13:13] musicians you can come play only believe
[2:13:15] only believe all things are possible
[2:13:17] only believe
[2:13:22] i remember that when we prayed for
[2:13:23] brother jose brother john and i i asked
[2:13:25] johnny to come up and pray for him
[2:13:26] i remember praying that that glaucoma
[2:13:28] would leave he goes a month later back
[2:13:30] to the doctor
[2:13:30] and the doctor says we don't know what
[2:13:32] happened but you don't have glaucoma
[2:13:34] anymore
[2:13:35] who took care of that not us it was the
[2:13:37] captain of the lord's host
[2:13:41] who's ministered to all those people by
[2:13:42] prayer cloth
[2:13:44] it's the captain of the host of the lord
[2:13:46] i remember when brother brian hawkins
[2:13:47] was sick of those couple years ago
[2:13:49] remember he came and preached about it
[2:13:50] he needed a hip transplant
[2:13:52] it must have been i don't know i didn't
[2:13:54] see him brother bang but it must have
[2:13:55] been the captain of the host of the lord
[2:13:57] pulled his sword i said brother you're
[2:13:58] 45 there's no way you need hip
[2:14:01] replacement let's pray for this and
[2:14:04] three days later the doctor calls and
[2:14:05] says
[2:14:06] your hips heal don't need hip
[2:14:08] replacement who stood up for that
[2:14:10] it was the captain of the host lord
[2:14:13] he stood up for us amen brian was facing
[2:14:16] a great jericho was he not
[2:14:18] a great obstacle glaucoma was a great
