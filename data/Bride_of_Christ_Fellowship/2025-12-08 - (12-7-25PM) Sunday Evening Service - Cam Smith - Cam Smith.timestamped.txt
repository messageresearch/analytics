[0:03] back.
[0:06] You're just hearing things and you're
[0:08] you're seeing things and you're like,
[0:09] man, Lord, amen. So, keep on putting
[0:13] your passion behind worshiping and
[0:14] loving the Lord, loving the word, and uh
[0:16] God will finish the rest. Uh we I know
[0:20] this seems like to be a Smith tendency
[0:22] as far as Brother Jesse and I, maybe,
[0:24] Brother Simon. We don't we we've never
[0:26] really tried to be anything. We just
[0:28] want to be Christians and along the way
[0:30] we we make mistakes. Everybody makes
[0:32] mistakes. We we do some things right,
[0:33] too. [laughter]
[0:35] Uh but uh don't don't ever let the don't
[0:39] ever let the devil tell you that uh God
[0:42] is not in control. He's in control. And
[0:44] uh I believe we're we're very close to
[0:46] something uh tremendously powerful. And
[0:49] uh with the help of the Lord, it will
[0:51] live. It will live very soon.
[0:54] And uh I know this uh we had brother
[0:58] Jesse months ago there and we'd sure
[1:00] like to keep him and uh even if he came
[1:03] without his beautiful children
[1:07] but uh uh I know everyone was so blessed
[1:09] when he come and uh everyone uh has
[1:13] really enjoyed brother Jesse's gift over
[1:15] the years and it's done mighty things in
[1:16] our church. Uh I remember a lot of you
[1:18] came over and were dancing and having a
[1:20] good time. You youngans, don't lose
[1:21] that. and hold right on to it. And uh
[1:24] remember that dancing is a victory. So
[1:26] that's not necessarily uh you know your
[1:28] victory don't come by sight.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Your victory comes because of
[1:34] revelation,
[1:35] &gt;&gt; right? You get it. You know it. You
[1:37] believe it. [laughter]
[1:40] So uh we'll just try to do the best we
[1:43] can tonight. Uh we'll just bring a
[1:45] little thought forward here. And uh it
[1:47] looks like I am on there. Let's see if
[1:48] we can get that up. Uh I'm just
[1:50] preaching a few sermons that I've
[1:51] preached at home recently that have just
[1:53] uh been uh just really uh life-changing
[1:56] to me. Uh the whole series I feel like
[1:58] this series I've been on, I preached uh
[1:59] preached 28 sermons uh on the body of
[2:02] Jesus Christ. Uh trying to get the
[2:04] church all settled out and uh and uh you
[2:06] know to some aspect I'm uh it's beyond
[2:09] me what the Lord is doing. Uh just in
[2:11] the last several months I've had I Lord
[2:13] just gave me a vision and gave me some
[2:14] things like that. So I'm moving in some
[2:16] areas I'd like to be in. Uh but that's
[2:18] your area too. We're all part of that
[2:20] move of God because you're the body of
[2:22] Jesus Christ. Uh so whatever you can do,
[2:24] just keep on uh working and pushing
[2:26] towards the same goal. Amen. I I would
[2:28] love it. I would love it to see uh uh
[2:30] speakers in tongues, interpreters of
[2:32] tongues, that prophetic gift moving
[2:35] forward. Amen. And uh and that's part of
[2:38] this, isn't it? Amen. Uh so that's
[2:41] actually a big part of it. Uh uh but yet
[2:44] uh God is that in this season, but uh
[2:46] the first season is we just got to love
[2:47] God with everything we got. Amen.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; So uh just love the word as much as you
[2:51] love worship. And I'll tell you what,
[2:53] everything's going to be all right
[2:54] around here. Uh because you saints sure
[2:56] know how to worship. And I I really love
[2:57] that. Uh we're going to go to Joshua
[2:59] 1:10 and Romans 4:1.
[3:03] Uh greetings from the saints back at uh
[3:07] Napoleon there. Uh, I know you guys get
[3:09] to see Brother Simon a lot a lot more
[3:11] than you see Pastor Cam here. But, uh,
[3:14] I'm glad that I could be here. And, uh,
[3:16] we we did it years ago. We had a little
[3:17] a little, uh, uh, community church
[3:20] service together. So, uh, you guys come
[3:22] our way or however we can do. And we've
[3:24] actually talked about over the years,
[3:25] maybe finding a middle point somewhere
[3:26] and just, uh, just having a having a
[3:28] little group church. I like that. Don't
[3:31] you?
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe we can work something
[3:34] around.
[3:36] not not much for memory, [laughter]
[3:39] not much for scheduling,
[3:42] but uh I know this I've spoken these
[3:44] words out to people who are perhaps more
[3:47] gifted much gifted and more gifted in
[3:49] that area than I am currently at the age
[3:51] of 46. [laughter]
[3:53] So let Lord let it be upon your hearts.
[3:55] Uh don't be afraid to talk to your
[3:56] pastor about those things if you desire
[3:58] it. And uh I know this we really need a
[3:59] revival and uh God's bringing that. He's
[4:02] absolutely going to bring that. Just
[4:04] hold on. Keep on holding on because it's
[4:06] going to happen. I I am convinced. Uh
[4:08] I'm seeing God answer my prayers.
[4:10] [laughter] And I don't know why or how.
[4:12] Uh because honestly, I don't see myself
[4:15] any different today than what I did 20
[4:17] years ago.
[4:19] And that's what we're going to work with
[4:21] tonight. Joshua 11:0.
[4:24] And this morning I started working with
[4:25] your smile. I'm gonna keep working with
[4:28] that smile. Got girls got beautiful
[4:30] smiles. Somebody's got some beautiful
[4:32] smiles up in here. All right. Yeah, I
[4:35] got a big gap in my teeth. So, you got
[4:36] to be better than me. Anyway, some one
[4:39] time somebody's just looking for a way
[4:40] to rip on me and they couldn't even
[4:41] think of it. And they said, "Well, at
[4:43] least I don't got a big gap between my
[4:44] two teeth." And I'm like, "Amen. That's
[4:47] all you got? Hallelujah. Let it be."
[4:50] [laughter]
[4:53] But Joshua 1:10,
[4:56] it says here, it says, "Then Joshua
[4:58] commanded the officers of the people,
[4:59] saying, "Pass through the host and
[5:01] command the people, saying, prepare you
[5:03] vituals uh for within three days you
[5:05] shall pass over this Jordan to go in to
[5:07] possess the land uh which the Lord your
[5:09] God giveth you to possess it." Amen. Uh
[5:12] we're going to talk tonight about
[5:13] crossing through this Jordan. And I hope
[5:15] I can bring this at a different angle uh
[5:17] than perhaps that you've thought of or
[5:19] heard of. And I believe that this will
[5:21] be a blessing to you. Um I may give a
[5:24] testimony because there's a brother who
[5:26] has been uh participating our sermons
[5:27] and as far as he's far away, but he's
[5:29] been participating in that. But but
[5:31] there's been a revolutionary change in
[5:33] his life.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm seeing this individual like
[5:36] I've never seen before. And I'm
[5:37] strengthened by it. You can actually
[5:39] pull strength off other people by what
[5:40] God does for them.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, but but I'll
[5:43] tell you what, I'm seeing the change in
[5:44] me now. Amen.
[5:48] [laughter]
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Romans 4:1. I'm gonna talk about you
[5:52] message believers tonight.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; What is a message believer? What are we
[5:56] talking about?
[5:58] It's going to be a little bit way that a
[5:59] little different way that we might work
[6:00] with this, but I hope this is all right.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; Romans 4:1 says, "What shall we say then
[6:05] that Abraham our f our father as
[6:07] pertaining to the flesh hath found?"
[6:09] What are you going to find pertaining to
[6:11] your flesh?
[6:14] What are you looking for? For if Abraham
[6:16] were justified by works, he hath whereof
[6:20] to glory, but not before God. That glory
[6:23] would only be for himself. This thing is
[6:25] election,
[6:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[6:28] &gt;&gt; For what saith the scripture, Abraham
[6:31] believed God, and it was counted unto
[6:34] him for righteousness. Did you get that?
[6:37] &gt;&gt; So if God sees you righteous right right
[6:39] now, how?
[6:41] Because you believe what?
[6:44] Are we in the right type of church here?
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Because we believe.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Uh oh. Maybe I should change subjects
[6:55] real quick. Not to him that workketh is
[6:58] the reward
[7:00] not reckoned of grace, but of debt. So
[7:03] when it becomes something you're
[7:05] working, is it going to be reckoned of
[7:07] grace or debt? Debt.
[7:09] Oh, looks like you need a release.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; I'll have to preach that. Oh, I already
[7:16] did.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; But to him that workketh not workketh
[7:21] not.
[7:23] Oh, this is getting difficult. But
[7:25] believeth on him that justifith the
[7:27] ungodly,
[7:29] his faith is counted for righteousness.
[7:33] This evening we're going to work with
[7:34] crossing Jordan to Ephesians u with a
[7:38] topic of law to grace. Uh let's bow our
[7:40] heads for a word of prayer and I I I
[7:42] just want to just believe this with all
[7:44] my heart because I'm watching it change
[7:45] me. I want it to change you and perhaps
[7:48] you're already there. Let's pray. Lord
[7:50] Jesus, we just love you. We're asking,
[7:52] oh God, that you just uh bless the
[7:53] reading of your word tonight. Lord,
[7:55] bring forth your spirit again just like
[7:57] it was here this morning. Lord, I I'
[7:59] I've come to a place, oh God, where I I
[8:01] just expect it. And I know, God, there's
[8:04] nothing I've done to earn any of it.
[8:06] It's election, Lord.
[8:10] We have received you because of
[8:12] election.
[8:14] You first loved us. And we're asking
[8:16] this evening, oh God, that you just
[8:18] allow this revelation to be great upon
[8:20] the people that they'd be able to move
[8:22] forward
[8:24] in a way, oh God, that perhaps
[8:27] an experience they've never really lived
[8:30] under. But we want to live under this,
[8:31] Lord. And we believe that we're ordained
[8:32] for it. So we're asking, oh God, that
[8:34] you just turn our hearts and our minds
[8:36] to the true revelation of Jesus Christ.
[8:38] Uh for the glory in your name, we just
[8:40] ask that you'd be in the midst as we
[8:42] say, "Amen." May be seated.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Got to get a little stuffy on that one.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; So, just a little while ago, a brother
[8:54] really got stirred up and he he was he
[8:56] was kind of working with that and he and
[8:57] he caught this revelation that changed
[8:59] him. And that that revelation was
[9:02] actually uh it was something God-given.
[9:05] Uh but I'll just rehearse just a little
[9:08] bit with you. uh
[9:11] he had always uh of course looked at the
[9:14] gospel through a message lens so to say
[9:16] as far as what is perceived, what is
[9:18] taught, what is received and uh one day
[9:21] the the Lord just kind of started
[9:23] working with him at Genesis 3 and he and
[9:25] he found that uh there was something
[9:28] there uh because what he seen was that
[9:31] the serpent would eat dust. the serpent
[9:34] when he went on his belly, he was going
[9:36] to eat dust. And he he also seen that
[9:38] Adam was formed from the dust. But the
[9:42] powerful little thought that that rolled
[9:44] of it uh which is so awesome is that
[9:49] when God
[9:51] brought the curse when man fell, did God
[9:54] place that on Adam, the curse? He
[9:57] didn't. He actually cursed the ground.
[10:04] He didn't curse Adam. Why? He couldn't
[10:08] curse Adam.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; Adam was a product of God.
[10:15] And this revelation so struck the
[10:18] brother because what it did was he
[10:21] constantly and you and I constantly
[10:25] look at this thing
[10:27] feeling like we can get this under
[10:29] control.
[10:31] feeling like we can tame it,
[10:35] &gt;&gt; you know, we can say it right, we can
[10:39] live it right. We are a bunch of message
[10:43] robots.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; We're all the same. We walk perfect,
[10:50] undefiled,
[10:53] no manner of folly in our midst ever.
[10:59] Because we are the chosen,
[11:02] we are the elect.
[11:04] We are the thoroughbreds.
[11:12] But what the revelation that this
[11:14] brother got,
[11:16] he got the revelation that God actually
[11:19] cursed the flesh.
[11:22] Meaning what?
[11:25] You can't tame it. You ever try to tame
[11:28] a wild animal? You can't.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; You can try, but that thing's going to
[11:33] kick in at some point in time. I've
[11:35] heard people have issues with them. They
[11:36] say, they said, "We told them they could
[11:38] never tame that thing because one day
[11:39] that animal just goes back to being
[11:40] wild." Look at people that get tigers
[11:42] and and lions, all these things like
[11:44] that and bears. Bears, it never works
[11:47] out very good for the most part, right?
[11:50] &gt;&gt; Because they're trying to tame something
[11:52] wild.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD BROUGHT THIS REVELATION to
[11:56] him,
[11:58] he said,
[12:00] it just opened up that God isn't even
[12:03] looking at his flesh because he is NOT
[12:06] HIS FLESH.
[12:08] GOD IS ACTUALLY looking at who he really
[12:12] is.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; You know that which desires God.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; That seed that God placed inside that
[12:21] saw how it come from God
[12:25] &gt;&gt; and it will go back to God and it set
[12:27] him free in such a way that I haven't
[12:29] seen him the same since.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh I want to begin to
[12:35] work with this idea uh because uh I
[12:38] literally went to a brother's house
[12:39] after that and I I just mentioned that
[12:41] part and the Holy Spirit just fell on
[12:43] me. I felt the Holy Ghost just come on
[12:44] me and all of a sudden my mouth goes
[12:47] for like an hour and a half just rolling
[12:50] and it just kept on opening because
[12:52] brother, sister, let's hit this like we
[12:55] did this morning.
[12:58] Shouldn't we be really happy people?
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shouldn't we be super
[13:03] excited to hear the word?
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Well, if we're living by it, it ought to
[13:08] bring more smiles than Chipotle. I know.
[13:10] I know. I know. I know. Disclaimer.
[13:16] But this word that we eat,
[13:19] what should it do to us?
[13:22] &gt;&gt; RIGHT, BROTHER?
[13:24] &gt;&gt; SO, WHY AREN'T we happy as far as like
[13:27] we OUGHT TO BE? WHY AREN'T WE SATISFIED
[13:32] LIKE we ought to be?
[13:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? AS OUR BROTHER I HEARD
[13:38] HE'S PREACHING on first Corinthians
[13:40] FINISHING THAT UP. WHY ARE WE NOT SEEING
[13:42] the moving of the spirit like we ought
[13:44] to?
[13:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; And this is where we begin.
[13:50] Because even Israel
[13:53] dwelling in the wilderness, they had to
[13:56] come to an Ephesians. And tonight we
[14:00] want to work with crossing Jordan to
[14:02] Ephesians. And remember, Jordan is a
[14:06] death to self. But how do we inter
[14:08] interpret this?
[14:11] We've come to the place that we believe
[14:14] or we try to so constrain ourselves to
[14:18] being perfect.
[14:22] We want TO JUST BE DEAD ON EVERY TIME
[14:24] BECAUSE WE LOVE GOD. SO WE BEGIN THIS
[14:27] war and it literally becomes such a
[14:29] strain on us
[14:33] &gt;&gt; as we're trying to live for God and fail
[14:36] at the same time
[14:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS THING IS ALWAYS GETTING AN
[14:40] EDGE ON US
[14:43] &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE PAUL WHEN HE SAID HE HE SAID
[14:46] OH OH THE THIS FLESH THE THINGS THAT I
[14:48] WANT TO DO I CAN'T DO RIGHT AND THE
[14:51] THINGS THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO THESE
[14:53] THINGS I DO SO EVEN THE FIRST church age
[14:56] messenger could not tame this thing
[14:59] &gt;&gt; AND AND GOD SO ANOINTED HIM IN A letter
[15:02] to the Romans that he would admit these
[15:05] things.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; I CAN'T TAME IT. YOU SEE, WE WE get
[15:08] this. What's your picture of Mo of the
[15:10] Apostle Paul?
[15:13] He's upright man, perfect in every every
[15:17] social statement, in every action that
[15:20] he does. But yet we see that the
[15:22] Corinthian church or brother Jesse went
[15:24] through that what they were actually
[15:26] blasting Paul because his presence was
[15:28] weak, timid.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; He wasn't this great asserting leader.
[15:38] Follow me. Open not thy mouth.
[15:42] HE WAS NOT THAT TYPE OF AN INDIVIDUAL.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Instead he come in actually.
[15:49] Hi everybody. God bless you. Lord bless
[15:51] you, sister boy. Nice to see you.
[15:57] AND WE'RE THERE EXPECTING HIM AT EVERY
[15:59] TURN. DOMINATE. Dominate this con this
[16:02] conversation. Show me the word.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Be the great leader we want. And they
[16:07] looked at him and they said, "What we
[16:09] this? Who is this clown?"
[16:16] &gt;&gt; So what is death to self?
[16:19] Here's Jordan River.
[16:21] Hey, there's some baptisms. That's nice.
[16:25] Now, watch this. We're going to begin to
[16:26] go through some things here. Now, watch
[16:28] this. In the breach, he works with it.
[16:30] He says, he says, "Another thing a seal
[16:32] signifies is ownership." The seal has a
[16:35] mark on it shows ownership. When you are
[16:38] bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and
[16:41] sealed by the Holy Ghost, you no longer
[16:43] belong to the world or anything
[16:46] pertaining to the world.
[16:49] Now, now, now let's catch this. When you
[16:51] are bought,
[16:53] he has to receive your sacrifice.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; And notice what that produces.
[17:00] It takes you from belonging to the
[17:03] world,
[17:05] &gt;&gt; sir. [laughter]
[17:07] &gt;&gt; Let's jump down. So, and the Holy Spirit
[17:10] seal cannot be broken. You have all
[17:11] heard me say that. People said, "The
[17:13] devil made me do this."
[17:16] I've heard people SAY THAT. THE DEVIL
[17:18] MADE ME DO IT. MY FLESH MADE ME DO IT.
[17:21] NOW WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. NO, NO, THE
[17:23] DEVIL DIDN'T do it.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; You just wasn't sealed in.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [laughter]
[17:32] &gt;&gt; So then you see cuz when you're sealed
[17:34] in, he's sealed out.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; This is going TO BRING SOME SMILES TO
[17:38] YOUR FACE.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU WENT OUT TO HIM. HE COULDN'T GET
[17:44] INTO YOU because the only way he get
[17:46] into you is COME THROUGH THE SAME
[17:48] PROCESS that you'd have.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; You get into that promised land.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; He can't get to you. [laughter]
[17:57] &gt;&gt; BUT WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
[18:01] &gt;&gt; You see how it's actually a revelation?
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Have you become unattached
[18:08] to this?
[18:11] This will live out. Brother, sister,
[18:12] God, help me. God help me to say it
[18:13] right. He'd have to be saved,
[18:16] sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost,
[18:18] then he'd be your brother. Anybody want
[18:21] Satan as your brother? No. I think he's
[18:22] done. I think he's done. All your sins,
[18:26] everything, every sin you have, Brother
[18:27] Bram said, that's going to go back to
[18:28] the devil judgment day.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that exciting?
[18:32] &gt;&gt; He ain't your brother. [laughter]
[18:35] You just went, now watch how he says
[18:36] this. You just went to the borderline
[18:39] and came back lusting for the things of
[18:41] the world.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[18:44] &gt;&gt; He never went all the way over into
[18:47] Canaan. YOU SEE, ACROSS JORDAN, the
[18:51] death to self,
[18:55] &gt;&gt; you're never going to be able to do what
[18:57] you want to do.
[19:01] We would like to think from a religious
[19:04] uh uh uh avenue that we would be able to
[19:06] control this thing how we'd like to.
[19:09] Brother sister, I [screaming] HAVE SPENT
[19:11] 20 ODD SOME YEARS now on this message
[19:13] trying to make be perfect.
[19:16] I want to be perfect. Now think about
[19:18] this. THE BIBLE SAYS I HAVE TO BE
[19:20] PERFECT. A a A BISHOP OR MUST be
[19:23] blameless.
[19:26] Just me and you, buddy.
[19:29] But we all want to do that because Jesus
[19:31] said in uh uh John 5:48, he said what?
[19:33] Be perfect AS YOUR FATHER IN HEAVEN ALSO
[19:36] IS PERFECT.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? BECAUSE WHAT
[19:40] WE'VE MADE THAT TO MEAN IS I'VE GOT TO
[19:42] DO EVERYTHING RIGHT. I'VE GOT TO BE
[19:44] PERFECT. I'VE GOT TO DO THIS.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; But isn't it something? The harder you
[19:52] try,
[19:54] the more
[19:59] I'm happy.
[20:01] You believe that, right? See, it went
[20:05] back to normal.
[20:07] See, I'm happy. And what? We try to mask
[20:11] something in an act
[20:14] when we're really not happy. Why aren't
[20:17] we happy?
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it all comes to this
[20:26] Jordan is really what's going on. Let's
[20:28] let's spend a little time with this now.
[20:30] Watch. This is actually incredibly deep
[20:32] message. And I and I I obviously just
[20:34] going to touch it. But he says as I was
[20:37] speaking last night on the Ephesians how
[20:39] that the book of Joshua is the Ephesians
[20:40] of the Old Testament and how it was a
[20:42] book of redemption. And redemption has
[20:44] two parts. Come out of and entering
[20:46] into. All right. First you have to come
[20:50] out. Some people wants now see how he
[20:52] does this. Some people wants to bring
[20:53] the world in with them. But you got to
[20:56] come out of the world to enter into
[20:58] Christ.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; We see message believers like that. They
[21:01] want they want everything world, right?
[21:04] &gt;&gt; That's okay. There's going to be people
[21:05] LIKE THAT. GOD OPENED THEIR EYES, RIGHT?
[21:08] &gt;&gt; But you know, sincere Christians, we
[21:10] don't want the world.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; I don't want the world.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; I SPENT 20OME YEARS JUST TRYING TO BE
[21:15] PERFECT. BUT I FOUND OUT THAT YOU KNOW
[21:17] WHAT? IT DOESN'T MAKE PEOPLE like you.
[21:19] It doesn't make people accept you. It
[21:20] doesn't make you give you any great
[21:22] favor with God for him to give you
[21:23] gifts, visions, or whatever like that.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Then what is death to
[21:30] self?
[21:32] I'm gonna have fun with this. I hope
[21:33] you're having fun already. Oh, I'm
[21:35] smiling. Oh, I'm sm I didn't have to
[21:37] prop this one up. It just come.
[21:40] He says
[21:43] you have to come out of unbelief to
[21:46] enter into
[21:48] faith. faith.
[21:51] There cannot be one thing in your way.
[21:53] To really have genuine faith, you must
[21:56] absolutely leave everything that's
[21:58] contrary to the word of God behind to
[22:01] enter into faith.
[22:03] You have to come back to the word. Now,
[22:06] I don't know about you, we can interpret
[22:09] this that we have to have our flesh 100%
[22:13] perfect
[22:15] because we have to come out of uh
[22:17] everything that's contrary to the word.
[22:19] Well, what's we
[22:21] didn't he just say
[22:25] faith?
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say I mean, shouldn't it say
[22:29] flesh?
[22:32] [laughter]
[22:35] &gt;&gt; This is powerful. Watch this. And that
[22:37] was the book of of the Ephesians of the
[22:39] Old Testament. Joshua where Moses
[22:42] represented the law could not save no
[22:45] one but grace could. And here Joshua is
[22:50] the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior.
[22:55] All right. Now I'm going to show this in
[22:57] just a minute. And now then we find out
[22:59] that we have come to another Ephesians
[23:03] when
[23:05] 65
[23:06] the preaching of the ministry. Now
[23:08] notice uh did that HAPPEN IN 63 55 52
[23:12] WHERE AT IN 65 he believed that they
[23:15] were coming to another Ephesians another
[23:17] Ephesians now
[23:20] where that in our intellectual
[23:23] denominations and so forth and all of
[23:26] our educational programs has come to its
[23:30] Jordan.
[23:33] THEN WE MUST HAVE AN EPHESIANS. AGAIN,
[23:35] WATCH THIS. WE MUST HAVE AN Exodus to
[23:38] come out and to go into for the rapture.
[23:43] So, where we're at,
[23:45] we're looking for an Ephesus.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; We want to come out of just just some
[23:51] sort of message system that we're part
[23:53] of.
[23:56] But notice TO COME BACK TO THE FULL
[23:58] WORD, YOU'VE GOT TO LEAVE your
[24:00] intellectual denominations, your
[24:02] educational programs. THEY THAT'S YOUR
[24:05] JORDAN. YOU HAVE TO die
[24:10] to the things that are contrary to the
[24:12] word.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Meaning what? YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR FAITH
[24:17] in that.
[24:19] It's what gets ME IN A LOT OF trouble
[24:22] because I've moved away from a lot of
[24:24] those things. I found out camp meetings
[24:27] are from the Presbyterian church. It's
[24:29] not in the Bible. VBS, it's it came from
[24:32] the Baptist or SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ALL
[24:34] OF THOSE ACTUALLY HAD A DENOMINATIONAL
[24:37] starting point.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; And sure, IT WORKS TO WHAT? TO DRAW
[24:43] PEOPLE.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. because people love those type
[24:48] of gatherings.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; BUT WHY IS IT NOT PRODUCING ACTS TWO?
[24:56] &gt;&gt; WHY DO THE PEOPLE I'VE HAD SEVERAL
[24:58] PEOPLE, MANY PEOPLE FROM MY from the
[25:00] church THAT I PASTOR GO TO ALL THOSE
[25:02] THINGS? THEY'LL GO AND TELL ME HOW GREAT
[25:03] OF A TIME IS AND THEY COME BACK and just
[25:05] like this.
[25:09] I
[25:09] &gt;&gt; I had a I had a young man come go to one
[25:11] of those things. He came back on fire
[25:13] for God. is the last time you ever come
[25:14] to church.
[25:19] He told me he told me he re he he was so
[25:21] uh had the anointing so much on him that
[25:23] he got the Holy Ghost and then left
[25:24] church has never went back to church
[25:26] since.
[25:30] Well, brother Cam, that's just one
[25:32] example. But honestly,
[25:34] what that is is it's a denominational
[25:37] program.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; What's coming back to the word do?
[25:42] said, "I'm not I'm not demonizing those
[25:43] things, but but you you hear a lot of
[25:45] people, oh, that's the me that's the
[25:46] marriage camp or that's this or that."
[25:48] See, everything has this positional
[25:50] placement where we in our system can can
[25:52] uh cohabitate with one another and make
[25:55] things work. But brother, sister,
[25:57] there's only one thing I want to see
[25:58] work.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine every young person here
[26:02] was filled with the Holy Ghost?
[26:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. THAT'S WHAT WE
[26:06] BELIEVE. AMEN. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
[26:08] AMEN. AND BROTHER, SISTER, YOU SEE, many
[26:11] times we think we have to do something
[26:14] to get something.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. I I' I'VE HEARD PEOPLE
[26:19] SAY, "WELL, I GO HERE BECAUSE THEY NEED
[26:21] FELLOWSHIP,
[26:23] RIGHT? MY CHILDREN NEED FELLOWSHIP."
[26:27] OR, "WELL, WELL, you know what? THERE'S
[26:29] NO ONE THERE THAT THAT I CAN MARRY.
[26:32] WHY DON'T WE MARRY JESUS CHRIST OR FIND
[26:34] CHRIST AND THEN LET CHRIST ADD ALL THOSE
[26:37] THINGS?
[26:39] OH, that's not the systematic approach,
[26:41] is it?
[26:44] &gt;&gt; And then we find out what it produces.
[26:47] And now it makes sense. But did you see
[26:50] that the true Jordan River? Moses
[26:54] represented law couldn't save, but grace
[26:56] could. And Joshua is the same word like
[26:59] Jesus, Jehovah Savior. Who took them
[27:01] over into the promised land? Joshua.
[27:03] Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost. And
[27:05] what? Wait, wait, wait. Joshua parallels
[27:09] Ephesians.
[27:12] So the Ephesians is actually the Holy
[27:14] Ghost taking us over. I want you to see
[27:17] this today. This has nothing to do with
[27:19] you.
[27:25] This is election.
[27:28] If anything, you better see election.
[27:30] [laughter]
[27:31] Hallelujah. Uh, children, there's a
[27:33] reason why God had you born in that
[27:35] family, [laughter]
[27:36] children, there's a reason that GOD GAVE
[27:38] YOU THE PARENTS HE GAVE YOU. AMEN.
[27:41] [laughter]
[27:42] HALLELUJAH. IT'S A WHAT? IT'S TO PRODUCE
[27:44] THE ELECTION. AMEN.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 7:18. Now, watch this. Uh, let's
[27:49] just jump down here. Uh, no, let's start
[27:51] here. For there's a verily a disanoling
[27:54] of the commandment going before for the
[27:55] weakness and unprofit unprofitableness
[27:58] thereof. You're telling me that the
[28:00] commandment
[28:01] was what?
[28:04] The weakness and the profitess, right?
[28:07] What what did the law do? The Bible says
[28:09] the law made you know that you were a
[28:11] sinner.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; It completely took your freedom away.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; I'm hitting an approach tonight. I want
[28:19] you to see this
[28:21] because if you're looking for Christ,
[28:23] we've looked at it most of the time the
[28:26] wrong way. For the law made nothing
[28:29] perfect, but the bringing in of a better
[28:31] hope did. By the which we draw nigh unto
[28:35] God.
[28:36] This law, you follow this law, it can't,
[28:39] it ain't going to do anything. Can it
[28:40] make you perfect? No. That's why James
[28:43] came in and said, why? You offend in one
[28:44] point, you're guilty of the whole.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Just one. It's all you need is one.
[28:49] Yeah, Lord did that today.
[28:55] But when we look at what the Lord does,
[28:57] he comes down here. This is a powerful
[28:59] spot in Ephesians and I got to hurry. It
[29:01] says, "And when we are dead in in sins,
[29:04] hath quickened us together with Christ.
[29:06] By grace are ye are saved." He said,
[29:09] "And hath raised us up together and made
[29:11] us sit together in heavenly places in
[29:13] Christ Jesus."
[29:15] So that grace, that salvation grace
[29:18] should make us sit in heavenly places.
[29:20] Anybody ever read the adoption message?
[29:23] What's the heavenly places? That's all
[29:25] nine spiritual gifts and the power of
[29:26] God moving.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; That's heavenly places.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; True grace produces that.
[29:34] Hallelujah. That in the ages to come, he
[29:36] might show the exceeding riches of his
[29:38] grace and his kindness towards us
[29:39] through Jesus Christ Jesus. For by grace
[29:42] are ye saved through faith.
[29:46] God has to put something in you called
[29:49] faith.
[29:53] Hallelujah.
[29:54] AND THAT NOT OF YOURSELVES.
[29:57] It is the gift of God. YOU'RE ONLY SAVED
[30:00] BY FAITH. AND THAT EVEN IN ITSELF IS A
[30:04] GIFT.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; WELL, WHY DO I [screaming] BELIEVE? HE
[30:08] GAVE IT TO YOU to believe. HE CALLED YOU
[30:12] OUT. THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU HEAR THIS
[30:13] MESSAGE, you what? BROTHER BRAM SAID,
[30:16] AND YOU SEE THAT IT'S EAGLE'S FOOD. He
[30:19] said, "You've heard from your
[30:20] theophony." [laughter]
[30:22] The true revelation of the word reveals
[30:26] to you that YES, YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; WHICH SHOULD BE WHAT? FAITH.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something how how many times
[30:37] especially when we when we think and da
[30:39] da and and what the devil brings? Oh,
[30:41] you're a serpent or yeah, you're a
[30:42] failure. You're never going to be more
[30:43] than that. Oh, you're a loser. Oh, oh,
[30:44] you've got all these problems you'll
[30:46] never overcome. And he wants to keep you
[30:47] in this spot where you're looking at
[30:50] this.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Because if he can keep you there, then
[30:54] what can faith do?
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Think about it. If our faith would have
[31:00] lined up with love for God this morning,
[31:01] what would have happened?
[31:06] Hallelujah. It's coming. It's coming.
[31:08] The word is opening it. It's going to
[31:10] work.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he continues. He says,
[31:13] but then uh uh let's go to the 11th
[31:15] verse. He said, "But that no man is
[31:17] justified by the law in the sight of
[31:19] God." It is evident. FOR THE JUST SHALL
[31:23] LIVE by faith.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; WE LIVE BY FAITH. I believe it.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; I believe that the Lord has healed our
[31:32] brother's a mother. I believe that. I
[31:35] BELIEVE GOD'S GOING TO SAVE THESE
[31:36] NEIGHBORS. AMEN. We believe that God is
[31:39] going to fulfill these things. Amen.
[31:43] But then uh uh it says uh but and the
[31:45] law is not of faith. See how contrary
[31:49] they are.
[31:50] The law is not of faith, but the man
[31:54] that doeth them shall live in them.
[31:58] Okay. Okay. I finally got my Armenianism
[32:01] in there. Hallelujah. Something I can
[32:03] do. But what does that actually mean?
[32:07] The man that doeth them shall live in
[32:09] them.
[32:11] Well, that's the first challenge that we
[32:13] must see is that what is that? Okay,
[32:17] one more faith one, then we'll get to
[32:19] it. Notice we have the Bible telling us
[32:24] how our father Abraham was accepted. He
[32:27] says, "For he is not a Jew, Romans 2:28,
[32:29] which is one outwardly, neither is that
[32:31] circumcision which is out which is
[32:33] outward in the flesh, but he is a Jew
[32:37] which is one inwardly. And circumcision
[32:39] is that of the heart in the spirit, and
[32:42] not in the letter, whose praise is not
[32:44] of men, but of God."
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; So notice circumcision availth nothing.
[32:51] that natural portion. [laughter]
[32:55] IT'S NOT WHAT OUTWARD IN THE FLESH. The
[32:58] real circumcision is that of the heart
[33:01] &gt;&gt; which works by
[33:03] faith. Thank you, pastor.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Very good. Amen.
[33:08] Notice, blessed is a man whom the Lord
[33:11] will NOT IMPUTE SIN.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; HE WON'T EVEN IMPUTE SIN ON YOU. I CAN'T
[33:16] MAKE THIS PERFECT. IT DOESN'T EVEN
[33:18] MATTER. HE'S NOT EVEN IMPUTING IT. AMEN.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING WE WANT TO BE WICKED
[33:24] PEOPLE. DON'T GET ME WRONG. AMEN. I'M
[33:26] NOT TRYING TO SAY WE CAN JUST DO
[33:27] WHATEVER WE WANT. Uh uh let grace abound
[33:30] or let sin abound that grace may uh that
[33:33] grace could cover. Right? We're not
[33:34] looking for that.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; But let's try to get this lined up.
[33:38] Watch this. And he received, Abraham
[33:41] received the sign of circumcision, a
[33:43] seal of the righteousness of the faith
[33:46] which he had, yet being uncircumcised,
[33:51] that he might be the father of all them
[33:53] that believe, though they be not
[33:55] circumcision circumcised, that
[33:57] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[34:01] also.
[34:02] Isn't that something? Did you see that?
[34:05] SO HE actually was called RIGHTEOUS
[34:09] BEFORE HE GOT the seal.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; His righteousness
[34:14] WAS SEEN BY GOD. HOW? BY THE FLESH.
[34:20] [laughter]
[34:22] HALLELUJAH. His His what? HIS FAITH WAS
[34:26] VIEWED BY GOD AS HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THE WORD.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SAY. LORD SIR,
[34:34] &gt;&gt; REVEAL YOUR WORD TO [screaming] ME. I
[34:35] BELIEVE IT.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT'S SHOWING. HALLELUJAH. UH,
[34:40] BAPTISM in the NAME OF THE LORD JESUS
[34:42] CHRIST. I BELIEVE IT.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; He will fill ME WITH THE HOLY GHOST CUZ
[34:46] I DID IT. I BELIEVE IT. HE'LL DO IT.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; But just like Abraham, it doesn't mean
[34:52] he'll do it when you want.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes God lets that to see
[34:58] if you really believe.
[35:02] Just like that promised son that had to
[35:04] come forward.
[35:06] So when we look at actually the crossing
[35:08] over on Jordan, let me tell you this.
[35:11] HOW DID THEY actually cross Jordan?
[35:14] They're all really good swimmers.
[35:15] Sister, are you good swimmer? Maybe we
[35:17] can swim across this. I don't know.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Was it was it BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE SO
[35:24] TALENTED?
[35:26] They're these great Christians. No,
[35:30] we actually find that when the
[35:32] transition went to Mo to to Joshua who
[35:34] was grace,
[35:36] Joshua actually brought them through.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; But notice what bridged them into the
[35:42] promised land. OUR PROPHET SAID IT WAS
[35:45] THE WILDERNESS WAS LAW,
[35:48] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[35:50] GRACE WAS THE PROMISED LAND.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this? And notice, JORDAN
[35:56] WAS A DEATH TO SELF,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT BRIDGED THEM THROUGH?
[36:04] What bridged them through from law to
[36:07] grace?
[36:09] The word. Because watch, God sent the
[36:13] ark in the middle of the JORDAN AND
[36:17] SPREAD IT. And notice this experience
[36:21] WAS LITERALLY AS I WAS WITH MOSES, SO
[36:24] I'LL BE WITH YOU JOSHUA.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; GOD COULD SPLIT THE RED SEA WITH MOSES
[36:29] AND GOD SPLIT THE JORDAN River for the
[36:31] children of God.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; BUT WATCH THIS. THAT ARK WAS THE LIVING
[36:36] WORD.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; WHO'S GOING TO BRING YOU INTO THE
[36:38] EPHESIANS?
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Who's going to bring THIS LION ANOINTING
[36:43] UH MOVING ON YOU? FORMER AND LATTER
[36:45] RAIN, ALL OF IT PRODUCING SIR. IT IS GOD
[36:48] HIMSELF [screaming]
[36:50] THAT BROUGHT THEM TO DEATH TO SELF TO
[36:53] grace the promised land.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; So what's the issue then brother Cam?
[37:00] It's what we perceive this to be death
[37:03] to self
[37:06] because we like to forget about this.
[37:10] We like law, grace.
[37:17] Did you get that? Did you see what I
[37:19] covered?
[37:21] I don't know if you know this. This is
[37:23] not you.
[37:25] This is God.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; What did they actually have to do?
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you. Did they have to
[37:36] listen to the word and believe it?
[37:37] Absolutely they did. [laughter]
[37:40] JOSHUA SAID, "THREE DAYS SET UP BECAUSE
[37:42] WE'RE CROSSING JORDAN."
[37:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THEY DID. THEY BELIEVED
[37:46] IT.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And and and biblically, uh
[37:51] uh uh Joshua told THEM, "STAY STAY 2,000
[37:54] CUBITS BEHIND THE ARK BECAUSE YOU YOU'VE
[37:56] never been this way and you NEED TO SEE
[37:58] WHICH WAY IT GOES."
[38:01] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD to let the word set the
[38:04] standard that they could walk through
[38:06] there. Amen.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Think about this. Who is going to get
[38:09] YOU TO THE POSITIONAL PLACEMENT? WHO'S
[38:13] GOING TO get you TO TAKE THE WALLS OF
[38:14] JERICHO DOWN? WHO'S GOING TO GET YOU TO
[38:17] FIGHT AN INVINCIBLE BATTLE AGAINST THE
[38:19] DEVIL?
[38:21] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE ARK. THE LIVING WORD WILL SEE
[38:25] YOU THROUGH.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; SO, what we do is we say, "Oh, I've got
[38:32] the Holy Ghost." and or oh God is God is
[38:35] getting me somewhere or God is doing
[38:37] this and we're judging everything by
[38:38] what we see on here.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; But isn't it funny? It's not funny.
[38:43] Isn't it odd that when we look into Acts
[38:46] two when the Holy Spirit fell on them in
[38:48] Acts five it says that what? It says
[38:51] that great grace was given to them. Said
[38:53] no man dur join themselves to them but
[38:56] great grace was given to them. Why did
[38:59] they need a great grace?
[39:02] because this thing still didn't look
[39:04] right.
[39:07] [laughter]
[39:09] &gt;&gt; What are we looking at? What do we
[39:11] perceive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:13] is? Oh, well, I know so and so's got the
[39:15] Holy Ghost because they talk about the
[39:16] word and they do this and they're this,
[39:18] this, that, and the other.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[39:25] Oh, you mean like the one that just left
[39:26] the message several years ago here
[39:29] who was more versed in the message than
[39:31] all of us probably combined almost.
[39:35] Had the biggest church.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; The other brother did the same thing.
[39:41] Had this great anointing, super gifted,
[39:44] and we found out they never had the Holy
[39:46] Ghost to begin with.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; I remember hearing of the second one. I
[39:51] remember hearing things where he was
[39:52] trying to show how perfect he was
[39:54] towards his flesh to to show the others
[39:57] what they ought to be and then within a
[40:00] year or two he leaves the word. I
[40:03] thought he had the Holy Ghost.
[40:06] Oh, he could live a perfect life to some
[40:09] extent,
[40:11] &gt;&gt; but he never crossed Jordan.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; And these are the people that are
[40:18] pastoring. And the people have no idea
[40:22] that the person they're following
[40:23] doesn't even have the Holy Ghost.
[40:27] Well, how would I judge that? Because
[40:28] they're perfect. Nope. No, no. I just
[40:31] hammered that one.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; We lost our smile. Why is there Who is
[40:34] our smile at?
[40:39] Now, I'm going to get into this.
[40:44] When you watch this type of where we're
[40:45] at, Joshua, parallels, Ephesians,
[40:49] we have Moses, brother Brandham, they
[40:52] brought us the word of the law,
[40:55] but then there had to be a Joshua come
[40:57] to this, which was grace, the Holy
[40:59] Spirit. We have the same thing. We have
[41:01] a Holy Ghost that wants to take us in.
[41:04] But how? What?
[41:07] Grace.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:12] So it's all right that your parents want
[41:13] you to follow the word and live the
[41:14] word, but you better get the word.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; You look for the person. You said, "God,
[41:20] you come and live in me."
[41:22] &gt;&gt; That's the difference. Because if he
[41:24] That's what really living the word is is
[41:26] when you let him take you over.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That Jordan was a natural
[41:33] Jordan here, but here it's actually a
[41:35] spiritual death.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; And who takes you through it? God does.
[41:41] Now, these messages are so powerful
[41:43] because they actually place you when you
[41:46] see how the prophet brought it out.
[41:48] Continuing the paradox message, uh um
[41:51] well, notice this. For he that has
[41:52] entered into his rest, Hebrews 4:10,
[41:54] hath he also has ceased from his own
[41:56] works as God did from his. Let us labor
[41:59] therefore to enter into that rest.
[42:04] He that has entered into his rest ceased
[42:07] from his own works.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a
[42:12] minute.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; So for me to enter into rest, I have to
[42:16] cease
[42:17] from works.
[42:20] What does that mean? That's why the
[42:22] Bible says that you mortify the deeds
[42:24] through the spirit.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; That's something that being indwelled
[42:30] with the Holy Ghost is supposed to
[42:32] produce.
[42:33] And then you notice if you're not
[42:35] feeding the Holy Ghost, right, if you're
[42:36] not loving God right, what happens? You
[42:39] start getting worldly
[42:41] &gt;&gt; very quick.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; But it's not a law.
[42:46] Watch this. As God did for miss, let us
[42:48] labor therefore to enter into that rest.
[42:49] Oh, there we go. Okay, I do need to work
[42:51] for this. See how confusing God let this
[42:54] be. No wonder he could say to his elect,
[42:57] his disciples, blessed are your eyes,
[42:59] for they see. Right?
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Lest any man f fall after the same
[43:05] example of unbelief. Wait, wait. We read
[43:08] that this morning. And what did they do?
[43:10] They didn't mix faith with the word.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what this is really about.
[43:15] Now, watch, watch how brother Brandon
[43:17] brings this out. So is it with the
[43:18] individual. As long as there is any
[43:20] human injections,
[43:23] human ideas, then God's germ of life,
[43:26] the Holy Spirit, cannot work. My next my
[43:29] next slide's a big one, but hold on.
[43:31] Watch this.
[43:33] Human injections. Well, well, they'll
[43:35] get right or I'll get right when we do
[43:39] this or I see this.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. Well, well, I'll I'll have
[43:46] gifts when when when I yield. Well, what
[43:49] does that really mean? Is that something
[43:50] that, you know, Well, man, I've been
[43:53] trying to yield all day long.
[43:56] How do I do this? Nope. Still didn't do
[43:59] it.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? Don't you
[44:01] realize that even yielding is a gift
[44:03] from God that you have to you have to
[44:05] give over to
[44:08] any preacher will know that because
[44:10] that's what we see more gift more on the
[44:12] gift line than any others because things
[44:14] have not been positioned correctly
[44:16] because the gift that we do, we yield to
[44:20] it. I I was just telling sister
[44:22] Beatatric over there, I've had it happen
[44:23] a couple times this year and and God's
[44:25] doing things with me. I he needs to do
[44:27] stuff with you. Expect the same things
[44:30] that I'm seeing.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; I've had time I'll tell you what, even
[44:33] right now I I just I just kind of let go
[44:35] and let God. I'm not a speaker. I'm not
[44:36] I'm not gifted like that. I have I'm not
[44:38] intelligent. And and literally when I
[44:41] start ministering, something kind of
[44:43] starts moving me. But I've had it almost
[44:46] uh two times this year
[44:48] where I'll be preaching
[44:51] and all of a sudden
[44:53] I feel myself
[44:56] my mind is detached from my mouth.
[45:01] Some of you might have experienced this.
[45:04] But I'm literally I'm still preaching,
[45:07] but I'm so disconnected to what's
[45:11] speaking out of me that I become in awe
[45:14] and I say something is preaching from me
[45:17] and it's not me.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz usually with a gift, you're yielding
[45:26] to it and it's just right with you. It's
[45:28] you're just like in tune. But there are
[45:30] times that I've experienced THIS YEAR
[45:32] WHERE GOD LITERALLY takes my mouth and
[45:35] starts speaking and then he allowed me
[45:37] to pull OFF OF IT WHERE I'M LITERALLY
[45:39] hearing him speak and I'm like and it's
[45:40] AND IT'S A SCARY MOMENT. IT LITERALLY
[45:42] WAS A SCARY MOMENT CUZ I'M SITTING HERE.
[45:44] HE IS CONTROLLING me and and what WHAT'S
[45:48] GETTING SAID? WHAT'S WHAT AND I'M JUST
[45:50] TRYING TO STAY IN THE PICTURE BECAUSE I
[45:51] HAD YIELDED so much to God because of
[45:54] his grace. Amen. That he literally was
[45:57] speaking from my mouth.
[46:00] with no connection to my intellect.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Does that sound crazy to you?
[46:10] Well, that's all people do and they
[46:12] yield to a demon.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; That's why many times after they do the
[46:17] things that they do, they say, "I have
[46:18] no recollection of any of that."
[46:24] But now watch this. Because if there's
[46:26] human injections, human ideas, then the
[46:28] Holy Spirit can't work.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; So whatever we judge this word to be or
[46:33] we we've got to die to all of it.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Understand what I'm saying?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; You cannot be healed as long as there's
[46:42] just a fraction somewhere. Why ain't
[46:44] divine healing working right?
[46:47] It's not God. It's our human intellect.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the things that we think
[46:54] because what? We're making it a law or
[46:56] making a cookie cutter. I've watched
[46:58] preachers say, "Oh, I got to do it this
[46:59] way every time because it worked back
[47:00] here." Oh, that don't mean that God can
[47:02] do it any way he wants, whenever he
[47:05] wants.
[47:08] He says, "If there's something it's not
[47:11] rotten yet, it's got all the human
[47:12] elements, all the scientific ideas, all
[47:14] the days of miracles has passed
[47:16] so-called, all that has to all not only
[47:18] die, but rot. and then from there grows
[47:22] the germ of life into a new life. That's
[47:24] the only way it can grow. That's the
[47:27] reason we don't get what we ask for. We
[47:30] try to take with us so much of our own
[47:33] ideas.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; We're not letting the Lord take our
[47:38] mind, but we're trying to make it
[47:39] something,
[47:42] &gt;&gt; right? Anybody ever thought that, well,
[47:44] I'll get healed or this will happen when
[47:45] I do this. Well, if I pray more, I'll
[47:47] get this. If I fast more, I'll get this.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Well, it's worked for a lot of people.
[47:54] Sure, it works for Benny Hen. Works for
[47:57] a lot of these people.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; But what is that really
[48:01] in the mind of God? Is it something when
[48:04] you look at Brother Brammy most of the
[48:05] time he fasted twice a week for half a
[48:07] day?
[48:12] Oh, I don't know if I'll get there.
[48:15] But you see what it is?
[48:18] We try to make it a law. We try to make
[48:21] it something we can that that we can
[48:23] place in our own mind that this is it.
[48:25] Watch this.
[48:28] I'm going to go to John Wesley. You
[48:30] know, John Wesley was the sanctification
[48:31] guy.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; But John Wesley said something
[48:34] incredibly powerful. I'll get out of the
[48:37] way of it right now.
[48:39] John Wesley said, "And by this token may
[48:42] you surely know whether you seek it by
[48:46] faith or by works."
[48:49] If by works you want something to be
[48:52] done first
[48:55] before you are sanctified, you think I
[48:58] must first BE OR DO THUS or thus, then
[49:02] you are seeking it by works unto this
[49:05] day. Think about it. SHOULDN'T THE HOLY
[49:08] GHOST BE FALLING ALL THE TIME?
[49:11] &gt;&gt; SO, what have we taken as a perception
[49:14] of what this message is?
[49:18] &gt;&gt; I just told you two months ago, God just
[49:20] gave me my first vision that I know of.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And what he told me was was absolutely
[49:26] phenomenal.
[49:28] [crying] But look at this. John Wesley
[49:31] could even recognize this. If you're
[49:33] seeking it by faith or works. Wait,
[49:36] where's your righteousness? Works or
[49:37] faith? Faith. Faith.
[49:42] You think I must be or do thus or thus.
[49:47] What's going to get you the gifts of the
[49:49] spirit? What's going to get the Holy
[49:51] Ghost falling here?
[49:54] Well, if I listen to the message more, I
[49:56] get more revelation. I do this. I'd be
[49:59] this. Well, if I can only be cleaner,
[50:04] then it'll happen. Oh, that's exactly
[50:08] why it's not happening.
[50:12] We're getting quiet. Good.
[50:15] Let's blast it. If you seek it by faith,
[50:20] you may expect it as you are.
[50:25] And if as you are, then expect it now.
[50:30] Faith will actually build an
[50:31] expectation.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; If you're hearing THIS WORD RIGHT NOW,
[50:35] LET FAITH BE ON IT.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; You have that. REMEMBER OUR PROPHET
[50:39] SAID, HE SAID, "RAPTURING FAITH IS
[50:41] ALREADY IN YOU.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALREADY THERE. IT'S JUST DORMANT
[50:46] AND it needs to be waken up." WELL,
[50:48] THAT'S WHEN THE DEVIL COMES ALONG and he
[50:50] says, "Well, in order for God to do
[50:51] anything for you, you got to do this or
[50:52] be thus."
[50:56] &gt;&gt; THEN WHERE'S YOUR SMILE AT?
[50:59] WHERE'S YOUR HAPPINESS YET?
[51:01] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR WHAT? Satan has tricked
[51:03] your mind that revival is only because
[51:06] you can be this or do this. Brother,
[51:09] sister, years ago, I probably told you
[51:10] this before, but years ago, I I I got
[51:13] really big into Isuza Street. And
[51:15] William Seymour was was praying
[51:17] literally for five to seven hours a day
[51:19] for years.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; And look at the revival they got. Well,
[51:26] you know what old Cam Smith tries to do?
[51:29] What' I try to do, Caris sister?
[51:33] I tried to do it, didn't I?
[51:37] I'm just going to say this. I got so
[51:40] into it, I put a peach basket on my
[51:42] head.
[51:43] It wasn't a peach basket. It was a box,
[51:45] but close enough. Well, that's why it
[51:47] didn't happen, Brother Cam, because it
[51:48] wasn't a peach basket.
[51:51] because I'm looking at what God did for
[51:53] other people based on what they did.
[51:56] And I thought that maybe God would give
[51:59] me what they had if I do what they do.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; But that WAS A DIFFERENT DAY WITH A
[52:06] DIFFERENT revelation with a different
[52:08] understanding and with something that
[52:10] God uh identified especially for those
[52:14] individuals in that time.
[52:19] Yes, sir. So, what do I got to do?
[52:22] What do I have to do? Brother, sister, I
[52:24] prayed for five hours for like a week
[52:26] and a half or something. And I got so
[52:29] depressed after five after a week and a
[52:30] half because I'm like, why ain't God
[52:32] doing anything? And then the devil's
[52:34] right over there. You got to go years,
[52:36] brother Cam.
[52:41] And I never tried it again after that
[52:43] because I was trying to attain it
[52:46] based on a work that I thought would get
[52:49] it to me
[52:51] &gt;&gt; instead of believing.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Loving God.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Because notice
[53:00] faith has what?
[53:03] Expectation.
[53:06] Faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the
[53:10] word.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; So, you see what real faith is that
[53:15] God's trying to bring out of you right
[53:16] now?
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Well, hold on, brother Cam. I I got to
[53:20] be more awake or I got to be this or No,
[53:22] you you see how the DEVIL HAS SO CAUGHT
[53:25] US INTO THIS. THAT'S WHY IN THAT
[53:27] DRAWING, BROTHER, SISTER, you have you
[53:30] have Ephesians and you have the
[53:31] wilderness.
[53:34] THAT'S WHAT OUR PROPHET SAID. THE LAST
[53:36] BIG MOVE was
[53:39] &gt;&gt; from law to grace.
[53:42] I'm just going to say this. That's what
[53:44] our message fathers have done. They've
[53:47] turned it into something we must be or
[53:49] do
[53:51] &gt;&gt; or we can't have it. And then notice we
[53:53] don't see it.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; I might see a miracle here or there.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; But we're talking into going into this
[54:02] revival.
[54:04] We're talking about a maturity
[54:06] that has given to us by this prophet.
[54:09] And look at the forefathers got some
[54:10] stuff too, don't they? Huh? Yes, sir.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; So, if you want the Holy Ghost,
[54:18] believe
[54:23] &gt;&gt; expect.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Expect it now.
[54:28] [laughter]
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, brother Cam, let's
[54:32] wait till the next service because this
[54:33] is the second service and I'm pretty
[54:34] tired. Why? WHY AIN'T I TIRED?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; WHY AIN'T I TIRED? CUZ YOU'RE YELLING,
[54:40] BROTHER CAM. You're doing this or YOU'RE
[54:41] DOING THAT. OH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
[54:44] MEANS? That means you got to yell and
[54:45] you got to move around, too.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Because that's the only way it's going
[54:52] to work, right?
[54:55] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOT FAITH. YOU SEE WHAT I'M
[54:58] SAYING? YOU'RE SAYING, "WELL, YOU'RE NOT
[54:59] TIRED CUZ THIS." NO, BUT BROTHERS AND
[55:01] SISTER, IF YOU BELIEVE, GOD CAN RUN THAT
[55:03] DEVIL AWAY FROM YOU. IF YOU BELIEVE AND
[55:06] SAY, "I EXPECT THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS
[55:08] HERE. I'M NOT HERE FOR A SERVICE. I'M
[55:10] HERE TO MEET THE LIVING GOD." AMEN.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; THEN YOU'RE MOVING WITH SOME FAITH AND
[55:16] SAYING, "WHAT? HE'S NOT EVEN LOOKING AT
[55:18] MY UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. CUZ MY
[55:20] RIGHTEOUSNESS, HE SEES IT AND IT IS MY
[55:22] FAITH."
[55:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:33] Watch what a prophet says. He says, now
[55:36] he's working with Matthew 7. And he
[55:39] says, "Sheep on one side, one of them
[55:41] will say, well Lord, I did this and
[55:43] Lord, I did that." That's what he said.
[55:46] He said, "They'll come to him. Have we
[55:48] not done many mighty miracles? Have we
[55:50] not prophesied in your name?" And he
[55:51] said, "Ye workers of iniquity, I knew
[55:53] you not."
[55:55] Watch what he says. He said, "Depart
[55:57] from me, you workers of iniquity. I
[55:58] never even knew you. If the church can
[56:00] ever come to those fundamental facts
[56:04] that it's not something you try to do,
[56:08] you work yourself up to do. It's
[56:11] something that's born in you.
[56:15] [laughter]
[56:16] THINK ABOUT THIS. I WON'T GET THERE FAR
[56:18] TODAY BECAUSE I ALREADY TELL you because
[56:19] of the time, but but what I'M GOING TO
[56:21] TELL YOU IS this was the same thing with
[56:23] the Pharisees and Sadducees.
[56:27] Now, isn't it something? Well, THEY
[56:31] PROPHESIED. THEY CAST OUT DEVILS and did
[56:33] miracles.
[56:38] And that's all it was.
[56:44] Hallelujah.
[56:46] Hallelujah. Forgive me, my Pentecostal
[56:48] friends. I'm Pentecostal, but my
[56:49] Pentecostal friends has got to a spot to
[56:51] where they there has to be a lot of fast
[56:53] music, beating up of some b bands or
[56:55] clapping hands or tambourines to bring
[56:57] up a shout. That's only emotions. They
[57:00] play the bands before they go to battle
[57:02] to get people in the emotion of the
[57:04] battle. I believe in music. I believe in
[57:06] clapping hands, but I believe in these
[57:07] things. That's exactly true. BUT WE
[57:09] OUGHT TO HAVE THAT.
[57:13] Can you imagine
[57:15] you you saying sing singing like you do?
[57:18] Did you realize you could take that
[57:19] right into the word?
[57:22] Why don't you?
[57:26] Oh no, brother Cam. Come on.
[57:29] Come on. It's second service. Come on.
[57:33] He said, "But you have left the great
[57:35] things undone." Is that self-sacrificed
[57:38] life that God lives in you
[57:42] automatic?
[57:46] Anybody that's INTO SPORTS, THEY'LL SAY,
[57:47] "OH, THAT GUY IS AUTOMATIC.
[57:52] He just gets it done. HE'S AUTOMATIC.
[57:55] AUTOMATIC HOME RUNS, WHATEVER."
[57:58] But wait a minute, that's just a
[58:00] perversion of what?
[58:02] The Holy Spirit. He's automatic.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; You get into his life and he lives it.
[58:13] Automatically doing that which is right
[58:16] because it's right. JUST GOING ON. Don't
[58:19] even think nothing about it. Just living
[58:21] it.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; You're not even thinking anything about
[58:24] it.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; You're just living it.
[58:28] I'm just a Christian because I'm born
[58:31] into it.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Then watch. You see
[58:40] what's going on. You just you don't
[58:42] you're on the highway." That's what
[58:43] Calvary meant to you. On the highway
[58:45] open up that DAY FOR YOU.
[58:48] WHAT DID CALVARY DO?
[58:54] This Holy Ghost that wants accept you by
[58:57] your works, your faith.
[59:02] You mean you believe and he'll fill you?
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Cam, the Bible says that
[59:10] that that gave the Holy Ghost like
[59:13] Abraham who obeyed.
[59:16] Okay.
[59:19] Well, then we just have to work it then,
[59:21] don't we? Or what is true obedience?
[59:30] Who gets you the Holy Ghost anyway? He
[59:32] does.
[59:34] He makes the way over in the Jordan. The
[59:38] living word does. But what? He wants
[59:41] your faith to line up. Because isn't
[59:43] this something? Have you ever looked
[59:46] and and we know this, right? But have
[59:49] you ever said, "I'm righteous."
[59:52] and said, "Because I believe."
[59:57] This is a game changer. I'm telling you,
[59:59] that brother was on to something. And
[1:00:00] this has opened up to me like never
[1:00:02] before. You know why? Because I've lived
[1:00:04] 20 odd some years right now in this
[1:00:06] message trying to be the most perfect
[1:00:08] human being that I could possibly be.
[1:00:11] And honestly,
[1:00:14] when I look at the way I was in the
[1:00:15] world, I was wild. But I was happy.
[1:00:21] I loved it. I love being worldly.
[1:00:25] My flesh,
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; I know I'm the only one here that's been
[1:00:29] worldly, but I took pleasure in
[1:00:32] unrighteousness
[1:00:33] and I was happy doing it.
[1:00:37] I GOT INTO DENOMINATION. THEY DIDN'T
[1:00:39] TEACH ME ANY OF THE WORD AND I ACTED THE
[1:00:41] SAME WAY. I WAS I WAS A H I was happy IN
[1:00:43] THE CHURCH. AMEN. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
[1:00:44] ABOUT ANYTHING. I WAS HUGGING GUYS,
[1:00:45] HUGGING GIRLS, HUGGING ANYBODY.
[1:00:46] HALLELUJAH. YEAH, I'M A CHRISTIAN.
[1:00:51] I was happy.
[1:00:53] And then I come to the message.
[1:00:59] Now I know the word. Now I know the
[1:01:02] word. And it's something when I didn't
[1:01:04] know the word,
[1:01:07] I feel like I was expressing a greater
[1:01:09] deal of happiness than what I did when I
[1:01:12] come to the because I began to try to
[1:01:16] constrain myself
[1:01:18] to seek my approval from God.
[1:01:24] I've got to be this and I've got to do
[1:01:26] this
[1:01:28] and I'm going to try really hard. Right
[1:01:32] now, don't get me wrong. I had message
[1:01:33] people coming to me at the time I was
[1:01:35] shaving my head and they said, "You
[1:01:36] know, that's a sign of a Nazi."
[1:01:38] I said, "Oh, I better grow my hair out."
[1:01:40] And I did. I wore a suit one time with
[1:01:43] with sandals and the deacon came over.
[1:01:45] He said, "What are you doing?"
[1:01:48] And I said, "What?" Because I was a
[1:01:51] happy message believer at the beginning.
[1:01:55] And he said, "Let me show you, brother
[1:01:56] Cam." So he picked me, he grabbed me,
[1:01:58] and he took me over to this sister. And
[1:02:00] she says, and he says, "Sister, do you
[1:02:02] see anything odd about Brother Cam?"
[1:02:06] And she's looking at me. She's like,
[1:02:07] "Oh, Brother Cam looks good." AND SHE'S
[1:02:08] LIKE, [laughter]
[1:02:10] AND SHE LOOK AT MY sho my sandals. And
[1:02:12] she says, "See what I mean, brother?"
[1:02:15] And so I never wore sandals with a suit
[1:02:17] again.
[1:02:23] And why do I still remember that?
[1:02:27] Why do I still remember that?
[1:02:31] What if I would have said, "Oh, well,
[1:02:33] I'm glad you guys feel that way, but I
[1:02:34] don't care."
[1:02:39] But what I did, I allowed it
[1:02:43] to become a work that I have to do in
[1:02:47] order to be right.
[1:02:49] Don't miss this. Don't miss this. And
[1:02:52] maybe many of us have went these paths,
[1:02:54] especially with things off of the word.
[1:02:56] Where's it at camp? Where's it? I had I
[1:02:58] had a fellow come to me. I was working
[1:03:00] with him and he said, "Brother Cam," he
[1:03:01] said, or he said, "Cam," he said, "Tell
[1:03:03] me where your Bible tells me that I have
[1:03:05] to wear a suit to church.
[1:04:03] I'm just trying to show you what's in
[1:04:05] the word and what's in human injection.
[1:04:14] Everybody's going to show up for church
[1:04:16] next time and they're all going to be
[1:04:17] wearing raggedy clothes. It's all your
[1:04:20] fault, brother Cam, but just let me
[1:04:22] know.
[1:04:24] I get it. I I want to dress nice because
[1:04:26] I love my God.
[1:04:29] I I want to I want to show something to
[1:04:30] him
[1:04:33] and I have to do that.
[1:04:39] But I only do it because I love
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; I don't do it because I have to.
[1:04:46] Come on. You see what I'm saying?
[1:04:51] You see what holds back the moving of
[1:04:54] the Holy Ghost?
[1:04:57] This is an in this is a powerful
[1:05:00] powerful quote. Notice same message. And
[1:05:04] Joshua could not at all become into his
[1:05:06] ministry until after Moses was gone. So
[1:05:08] you see the very first verse here,
[1:05:09] Moses, my servant is dead. Now arise,
[1:05:11] take this people into the promised land.
[1:05:12] Moses representing the law had served
[1:05:14] its time. It's the law had served its
[1:05:17] time. They started out really with grace
[1:05:20] to begin with before they had law. They
[1:05:21] had grace. While they were in Egypt
[1:05:23] without law, no one down there was just
[1:05:26] the priest and so forth. They didn't
[1:05:27] have any law. Uh the law had not yet
[1:05:30] been given. Grace provided them a
[1:05:32] prophet. Grace provided an atonement,
[1:05:34] the sacrificial lamb. We're getting into
[1:05:35] it this week on the sacrificed blood
[1:05:37] because there lays your healing. So the
[1:05:40] atonement had been provided before there
[1:05:42] was any law. Grace was before law,
[1:05:44] during law, after law.
[1:05:49] So there was Joshua representing grace
[1:05:52] was right along with law,
[1:05:54] but could not be enforced as long as law
[1:05:58] was in its proper place.
[1:06:03] And so as a church world in this last
[1:06:05] day, it's come along. It's played its
[1:06:07] part. But there is coming a time where
[1:06:09] it must cease. Did you get that?
[1:06:14] There has got to be in Ephesians also
[1:06:16] this journey just as there was of these
[1:06:18] other journeys. There has to come to
[1:06:19] Ephesians of this journey. He ties it
[1:06:21] along and says again,
[1:06:26] oh my.
[1:06:32] So, just like you have the Jordan River,
[1:06:35] you have what?
[1:06:37] Didn't Jesus take the church from law to
[1:06:40] grace?
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Now, notice they were both in law, the
[1:06:46] disciples,
[1:06:47] the Pharisees and scribes,
[1:06:50] and he wanted to bring them to grace.
[1:06:51] This is where we're going to get pretty
[1:06:54] pretty powerful. I hope I hope we can
[1:06:55] see this. Now, I wonder what they both
[1:06:59] look like.
[1:07:03] First thing is let's find out what what
[1:07:05] brother Brandham said the Ephesians was.
[1:07:08] He says he's talking about Jesus said uh
[1:07:13] talking about Jesus he said but there's
[1:07:14] no prophet and then when he come on the
[1:07:16] scene to prove that he was that
[1:07:18] Ephesians made manifest. John announced
[1:07:22] it but Jesus was that he was the word
[1:07:24] manifested himself. So the Ephesians is
[1:07:26] actually the word made manifest.
[1:07:30] Hallelujah. 1 Timothy 3:16. Let's give
[1:07:33] it. But he was the mystery of godliness,
[1:07:35] wasn't he?
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; All right. Here's where I want to get.
[1:07:40] He said, so notice in a seed's birth,
[1:07:43] the old seed must die before the new one
[1:07:45] can be born. So therefore, death is hard
[1:07:48] any time. So it's painful. It's
[1:07:51] distressful. Think about that.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Birth is the same because you're
[1:07:56] bringing life into the world. It's
[1:07:58] painful.
[1:08:00] So wait, the new birth is not something
[1:08:02] easy.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; We're talking about law and grace.
[1:08:09] So think about this. It's not easy to
[1:08:12] die to self, to grace.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; I just told you several things. A lot of
[1:08:19] you are probably thinking different of
[1:08:20] me now. [laughter]
[1:08:22] Humble enough to do it. Thank God. Help
[1:08:25] me. Watch this. And that's the reason it
[1:08:27] was so hard for those Pharisees to
[1:08:29] understand our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:33] because they were under the law.
[1:08:36] Think about it. They couldn't understand
[1:08:38] who Jesus was because they were trying
[1:08:41] to live the law.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And the law was the word of God in seed
[1:08:46] form. But when the word was made flesh
[1:08:49] and become not law but grace, now grace
[1:08:51] and law cannot exist at the same time.
[1:08:54] Oh my
[1:08:56] Because grace is so far above law. Law
[1:08:59] is not even in the picture. When I
[1:09:01] preach this at the church,
[1:09:04] I wrote grace right here. And I said,
[1:09:07] can anybody show me what else is written
[1:09:08] here? It's not even the same picture.
[1:09:13] Law's not even in the picture.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, BUT IT MUST GO. The two laws
[1:09:17] cannot exist at the same time. There
[1:09:19] cannot be a law that says that you can
[1:09:21] run this semi for and the other one says
[1:09:23] you can't. You can run it. Uh, one says
[1:09:25] you can, one says you can't. There it
[1:09:27] has to be one law at a time. Maybe one
[1:09:29] time you have went through it. Caution,
[1:09:32] go through it.
[1:09:34] He said, but this time it's read. Stop.
[1:09:37] See, and so there cannot be two laws
[1:09:39] exist at the same time. Now here we go.
[1:09:41] Now we notice that it always, my thought
[1:09:43] now to you, it takes pain and distress,
[1:09:46] discomfort. Look how them Pharisees died
[1:09:49] to that law.
[1:09:51] Uhoh.
[1:09:54] through pain, distress, discomfort, but
[1:09:58] it must be. Did you just get this? This
[1:10:01] is insoly
[1:10:09] ghost,
[1:10:11] Satan will bring a contrary move of the
[1:10:14] seed form word.
[1:10:17] And that's why the Pharisees couldn't
[1:10:20] understand Jesus
[1:10:22] because they were trying to die to the
[1:10:25] perfection of flesh that they could
[1:10:28] manage that they could do.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; But think about it. That was the very
[1:10:34] experience that crucified Christ.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; They died to law. Law killed Christ.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you see this. He died.
[1:10:52] The Pharisees had to die to law through
[1:10:55] pain, distress, and discomfort.
[1:10:59] Are we happy?
[1:11:03] Are are we just the happiest Christians
[1:11:05] you can think of?
[1:11:07] Or are we going through pain, distress,
[1:11:10] and discomfort
[1:11:12] because this message has revealed the
[1:11:14] full word to us? What what we should do,
[1:11:17] what we shouldn't do,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; and we're trying to find acceptance by
[1:11:21] dying to that law.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Very quickly, watch this.
[1:11:31] God wants us all to do alms.
[1:11:34] But notice what he says. Take he do not
[1:11:36] alms before men to be seen of them
[1:11:39] otherwise you have no reward of your
[1:11:40] father. He's talking about the Pharisees
[1:11:42] and Sadducees. Notice they're both to do
[1:11:45] these things but one is doing it as a
[1:11:48] law.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; So he's saying don't do it like that for
[1:11:51] a law.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Says it again when thou prayest.
[1:11:57] Don't be like those dying to the law.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; They want to be seen. They they they
[1:12:04] want to uh they want people to see how
[1:12:07] great they are.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; When you fast,
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; be not as THE HYPOCRITES OF A SAD
[1:12:18] COUNTENANCE.
[1:12:20] OH, just fasting,
[1:12:25] right?
[1:12:27] That's what we do. just sitting at
[1:12:29] second service.
[1:12:34] Second service is a ch they're
[1:12:35] challenging. Hallelujah.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Good job. We still got smilers. We still
[1:12:41] got mean, man. You still got it going
[1:12:43] on. Glory.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; And isn't it something? He brings it a
[1:12:48] little bit farther.
[1:12:50] He says,
[1:12:52] he said, "Beware the leavenven of the
[1:12:55] Pharisees and Sadducees." It was the
[1:12:57] word that they were producing.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm I'm trying to close
[1:13:06] because there's a lot here.
[1:13:09] This is where I want to hit.
[1:13:13] When we had our picture up there, I had
[1:13:16] the disciples right here and I had the
[1:13:18] Pharisees and Sadducees right here. Both
[1:13:21] of them were dying to something.
[1:13:24] But only one set of those people
[1:13:26] actually went into the baptism of the
[1:13:27] Holy Ghost.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Those that died to a law, something they
[1:13:32] could be or do or try to prove that by
[1:13:35] flesh
[1:13:37] they were good enough.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Think about it. They thought they had
[1:13:41] the spirit of God on them
[1:13:46] and they were the ones that killed the
[1:13:48] word. But watch this. Look at the ones
[1:13:51] that live by grace.
[1:13:54] The disciples
[1:13:56] they didn't understand his full plan
[1:13:59] in such a way Peter said he he said Lord
[1:14:01] you don't have to be crucified
[1:14:04] and Jesus looked at him and said Satan
[1:14:06] get behind thee [laughter]
[1:14:09] thou savest not the things of God you
[1:14:11] imagine THAT WAS THE ONE THAT THAT was
[1:14:13] moving into grace.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; He was yielding to Satan to try to get
[1:14:19] Jesus to go against his plan.
[1:14:24] That was the one that was living
[1:14:28] to move into grace.
[1:14:30] They were fighting for position.
[1:14:33] THEY WERE ARGUING WITH JESUS RIGHT IN
[1:14:34] FRONT OF THEM. WHO'S GOING TO BE THE
[1:14:36] GREATEST? I'm going to be the greatest.
[1:14:38] Obviously,
[1:14:43] what I'm trying to do is to show you,
[1:14:46] did the Pharisees, were they really good
[1:14:48] at fasting and praying and doing alms?
[1:14:52] Were they really good at looking like
[1:14:54] good religious people all the time? They
[1:14:56] were able to die to that law in such a
[1:14:58] way they brought in the perfect
[1:14:59] counterfeit instead of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; But these guys, oh boy, those guys
[1:15:08] didn't have the perfect lives, did they?
[1:15:10] These aren't much to brag about. But
[1:15:12] notice what they did do. They walked
[1:15:14] daily with him,
[1:15:18] right? They walked with Jesus. They
[1:15:21] forsook all, right? They knew his
[1:15:24] personality. Brother Simon had a
[1:15:25] powerful sermon about knowing the
[1:15:26] personality of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:29] They knew what he was like. While the
[1:15:31] PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES WANTED NOTHING
[1:15:32] TO do with him.
[1:15:36] They knew he was a Christ.
[1:15:39] They sold out, left their lives.
[1:15:42] They left their normal lives just to
[1:15:44] solely follow him. Yes, sir.
[1:15:48] Even with all these problems, they did
[1:15:49] this. They daily were listening to his
[1:15:51] word. They were daily in communion
[1:15:54] talking to him. Well, Jesus, what do you
[1:15:57] think about this? Jesus, what do you
[1:15:59] think about that? But mainly, they were
[1:16:02] predestinated and called by him.
[1:16:06] [laughter]
[1:16:07] God singlehandedly said, "Come follow
[1:16:10] me, Peter."
[1:16:13] [laughter]
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:16:18] Simon Barjonas.
[1:16:22] That's a different one. But anyway,
[1:16:24] we're gonna stop right there. Just a
[1:16:27] little teaching.
[1:16:29] And I know took a little time,
[1:16:32] but I want us not to miss this
[1:16:37] where we're going with this. We're going
[1:16:39] into an Ephesians
[1:16:41] and we're leaving what is considered by
[1:16:45] God as our prophet sw to us 60 years ago
[1:16:51] that this has got to go from law
[1:16:56] to grace. The grace is the full
[1:16:58] Ephesians move.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Very simply
[1:17:06] and very concisely,
[1:17:08] we are watching, brother, sister, that
[1:17:11] God is trying to get us to stop trying
[1:17:15] to be perfect.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; What we ought to be doing is saying,
[1:17:20] "God, I believe you.
[1:17:22] I'm righteous because your word says so
[1:17:24] and I believe it. You took my place. I
[1:17:27] believe it. You'll fill me with the Holy
[1:17:29] Ghost because you promised it. I'll see
[1:17:31] not I just won't say I've got the Holy
[1:17:33] Ghost. I'll see all of the vindication
[1:17:34] of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; because you're actually speaking THE
[1:17:38] WORD. YOU'RE SAYING WHAT you are because
[1:17:41] faith shows
[1:17:46] by what's coming forth from here.
[1:17:49] That's why brother Brandon he said never
[1:17:51] be negative. He said it weakens faith
[1:17:54] all the time.
[1:17:56] But why are we being negative?
[1:17:59] Why are we being negative?
[1:18:02] Because we're not entering into faith.
[1:18:05] That's why it weakens faith. Because
[1:18:07] it's contrary.
[1:18:10] Oh, brother, sister. So what? So next
[1:18:12] time you hear the word, when you go
[1:18:13] home, you listen to whatever you're
[1:18:15] doing. Like I said, this is no excuse
[1:18:19] to not love God in his word and to want
[1:18:22] to be a Christian, but it changes the
[1:18:24] direction of how you were trying to do
[1:18:26] it
[1:18:28] and say, "Lord, I believe."
[1:18:32] It's so simple. It's so simple. Brother,
[1:18:35] sister,
[1:18:37] this is literally the transition where
[1:18:39] you're starting to watch God move
[1:18:41] through you.
[1:18:44] Isn't that what he said? You're not even
[1:18:46] trying. It's something automatic.
[1:18:48] I said, "If you're already there,
[1:18:50] hallelujah.
[1:18:52] Pray for me.
[1:18:54] because I want the full Ephesians. I
[1:18:56] want all of it. And the book of Joshua
[1:18:59] tells me what it is.
[1:19:02] The book of Ephesians tells me what it
[1:19:04] is. The adoption series tells me what it
[1:19:07] is. Yes, sir.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; And that is who we are.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Don't look at what you are. Look at what
[1:19:14] he says you are.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Because what he sees is the word.
[1:19:20] Remember,
[1:19:23] ain't that what what he said? That's
[1:19:24] what he said in the adoption series. He
[1:19:26] says that God can't look at you any
[1:19:28] differently than what he did when he put
[1:19:31] your name on the book for the foundation
[1:19:34] of the world.
[1:19:36] So, you see how Satan wants us to look
[1:19:39] at this, our thought process, our
[1:19:42] issues. Well, maybe most of our issues
[1:19:44] would fall out if we could just believe
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; because they're contrary.
[1:19:50] law has to cease.
[1:19:53] Don't worry. The word brings you through
[1:19:54] that. The the living word brings you
[1:19:56] through. That's why when you're hearing
[1:19:58] the word, you're like, "Yep, I get it.
[1:19:59] Amen. Hallelujah. I'm free." Why am I
[1:20:02] free? Because he said I'm free. I
[1:20:04] believed it.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; I'M FREE BECAUSE I live perfect THIS
[1:20:08] MORNING. NO, I'M FREE BECAUSE HE SAID
[1:20:12] I'M FREE. [laughter]
[1:20:13] HALLELUJAH. I'M FREE BECAUSE HE DIED ON
[1:20:16] A CROSS TO TAKE MY PLACE. I CAN LIVE
[1:20:19] THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE HE SAID HE'D COME
[1:20:21] IN ME AND LIVE THIS MESSAGE. AMEN. IT'S
[1:20:24] AUTOMATICALLY LIVED. LET'S STAND.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; That's a long grace one for you, brother
[1:20:32] sister. But wow,
[1:20:34] it's so phenomenal.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your patience.
[1:20:43] So, how many want to get away from the
[1:20:45] I've got to be this or do this?
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And just expect a living God by faith to
[1:20:54] come in and do it for you.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; You see what it is? It's really just
[1:20:58] believing that if he comes inside of me,
[1:21:01] it's exactly what Brother Bram said the
[1:21:02] whole time. If I had the spirit of
[1:21:03] Mosart, I'd be doing music. If I had the
[1:21:06] spirit of Michelangelo, I'd be making
[1:21:08] sculptures and stuff.
[1:21:10] But if I have the spirit of Christ,
[1:21:12] what's going to happen? It's going to
[1:21:14] live the word.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; But it's the spirit of Christ.
[1:21:18] We're yielding to it. We're happy. We're
[1:21:20] believing. We're feeding.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; We're doing what Christians do. Love
[1:21:26] God.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Believe him. Amen. Very, very simple. A
[1:21:31] lot there. I hope we see it. And I I
[1:21:34] believe that God will continue to add to
[1:21:35] it. Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When when that brother told
[1:21:40] me that, I'm sitting here, I'm like,
[1:21:41] man, why am I looking at this thing?
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; But isn't it something that even while
[1:21:48] law was in existence, grace was always
[1:21:50] with it the whole time.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Think about it. When when Moses was in
[1:21:54] the wilderness,
[1:21:56] the first battle, who fought the battle?
[1:21:58] Joshua. Who fought every battle? Joshua.
[1:22:02] Who was fighting the prophet's battles?
[1:22:03] Joshua. Grace was there the whole time.
[1:22:10] Hallelujah.
[1:22:12] How many want grace to rule your life?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Okay, I didn't define it. Grace is
[1:22:17] unmmerited favor.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; So what' you do? Nothing. It's
[1:22:24] unmmerited.
[1:22:26] He loves you because you're brother
[1:22:27] Jesse. Loves you because you're brother
[1:22:28] Jose. He loves you because you're
[1:22:30] brother Chris. [laughter] He loves you
[1:22:32] because he brought you forth.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And he will complete that which lackth
[1:22:37] in you. He will. I believe that.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Think about all your failures. All all
[1:22:43] the things that you that you know is not
[1:22:45] like God. What are you going to do with
[1:22:47] it right now?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; I believe God's going to conquer.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that the nature of
[1:22:56] Christ is going to so fill me that it's
[1:22:58] just automatic.
[1:23:04] Oh, there's dying to self right there.
[1:23:09] How many love the Lord?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we make a prayer, why is
[1:23:15] God going to accept your prayer?
[1:23:19] Something you got to do, something you
[1:23:20] got to be?
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Because he loves you. He first loved
[1:23:24] you.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; You're here because he first loved you.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; So what does he want you to do? Believe.
[1:23:32] How many have a need? Let's believe.
[1:23:37] Hallelujah. Let's pray right now.
[1:23:40] Lord Jesus, we approach you, oh God,
[1:23:41] knowing I maybe went a little long
[1:23:43] again, Lord, but we're just asking this,
[1:23:44] Lord, that Lord, when we come to these
[1:23:47] ideas about where you're taking the
[1:23:50] church, what has to happen to get the
[1:23:52] word to be functional like it's supposed
[1:23:55] to be.
[1:23:57] We're finding, Lord, that just like
[1:23:59] every system,
[1:24:01] they started to make the gospel
[1:24:03] something it wasn't.
[1:24:06] It was supposed to be a good news. It
[1:24:08] was supposed to be a move by faith, a
[1:24:11] move by grace
[1:24:13] because that's even how we had
[1:24:15] salvation, Lord.
[1:24:18] But Lord, we look that what man does is
[1:24:23] it injects.
[1:24:25] But Lord, we don't want injection,
[1:24:27] man's injection. We want to live by
[1:24:31] faith in THIS WORD. THE JUST SHALL LIVE
[1:24:35] BY FAITH, GOD. And I'm PRAYING RIGHT
[1:24:37] NOW, LORD. We're agreeing in that prayer
[1:24:40] that Lord, you'll move on each
[1:24:41] individual, Lord. Oh God, may it be that
[1:24:44] you can pull us all away from our own
[1:24:48] doing, OUR OWN INJECTION OF THOUGHT THAT
[1:24:51] OF WHAT WE HAVE TO BE before you can
[1:24:53] make us what you want us to be.
[1:24:56] This is all about you. And we know that
[1:24:59] right now you're looking at our faith.
[1:25:02] Do we believe this? Are we the
[1:25:04] righteousness of God?
[1:25:06] We believe Lord.
[1:25:08] So we're asking with that Lord you'll
[1:25:11] come on the scene Lord and bring great
[1:25:13] change in our daily walk. BRING A
[1:25:15] HAPPINESS BECAUSE it's nothing WE EVER
[1:25:18] HAD TO WORK for Lord as far as to try to
[1:25:20] to to do some religious valor. OH GOD,
[1:25:23] IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT you by election
[1:25:26] drawing us to believe it
[1:25:29] and we're living by that.
[1:25:32] bridge the way over Jordan into this
[1:25:34] Ephesians so the fullness of the word
[1:25:39] can manifest in our midst.
[1:25:42] We're praying, oh God, that you be
[1:25:44] gracious unto us. And Lord, what you've
[1:25:47] started, Lord, we know you're going to
[1:25:48] fi finish, oh God, because it's your
[1:25:51] work. You are the wise master builder.
[1:25:54] You will accomplish what your word has
[1:25:56] set forth. It will not come back to you
[1:25:58] void. So I'm praying in the name of
[1:26:00] Jesus Christ, you give everyone what
[1:26:01] they have need of.
[1:26:03] And Lord, raise our faith up in thee for
[1:26:06] the glory. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:26:08] pray. Amen. Amen. Uh can we love
