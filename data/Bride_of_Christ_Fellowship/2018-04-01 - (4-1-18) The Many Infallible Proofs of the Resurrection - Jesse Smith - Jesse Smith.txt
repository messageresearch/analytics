message this morning I'll take a break from the series we've been working on the wisdom series we'll take a little break from that and I just like to preach a Easter message this morning I like to preach on the infallible proofs of the resurrection of Jesus Christ I'd like to preach on that this morning by the grace of the Lord trust be a blessing to you Acts chapter one verse one this week I've been listening to the sermons the proof of his resurrection for brother Branham there's one in 1955 and one in 1957 and enjoying those this this week by the grace of Lord so that's kind of where I'm getting my thoughts from by God's grace Acts chapter 1 verse 1 now we know st. Luke wrote both acts and the Book of Luke so this is Luke speaking to us by the grace of the Lord and the former treatise is the Book of Luke that's what he's referring to as we begin this chapter here if you're there say Amen I'll read verses 1 and 2 and then we'll all read verse 3 the former treatise have I made aa Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen let's read verse three one two three for whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and I'll read verse four and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence don't you love those red letter words there I like when people look at me a little strange like what do you mean the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I can say Jesus Christ said that himself they think oh I know I know what it's like to be saved but Jesus Christ himself said there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost aren't you glad amen let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer forever you know in your heart just make it unto God as we pray this morning Heavenly Father Lord we give you glory we know you live we're standing in your presence Lord we're standing in respect to the Heavenly Father that's the service Lord bless the reading of the word Lord it's your word Lord no man can no man can give the interpretation so we just ask that the Great Holy Spirit will come and speak through mortal lips and speak to hungry hearts Lord this morning we know Lord you're alive and we ask that you move upon every heart in this congregation just walk amongst our Mitz Lord this morning dear God and bless your people with your divine presence we're so grateful for the infallible proofs you've given to us in our lives and also in the lives of the saints we give you glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless your being seated praise God what we're grateful to be here on Easter Sunday Resurrection Day whatever you want to call it by God's grace and we know it's April Fool's Day so we know the world is fooled right Satan has blinded the minds of them who do not believe and it's so sad but there's so much hope we're sad for them this morning we were signing crying out here at the altar for the abominations done in this city it's so sappy at the same time when we've received the love of Christ we're so grateful for the love of Christ amen we just find ourselves in that condition all the time we feel weary but at the same time we're rejoicing in our hearts it's that great mystery of our three parts of our being praise God so let's look at this mauka have some slides here you can switch over buddy when you're ready I would like to look at the infallible proofs of the resurrection of Jesus Christ this morning by God's grace last year we preached on the Daystar arising in our hearts you may maybe some of you remember that by God's grace but I'm just gonna use the the text that we use this morning with the baptism of the Holy Ghost now I want to just take a few moments here let's look at these infallible proofs that Luke is talking about now infallible means it cannot be it cannot be disputed no one can dispute it it's infallible it's totally true there's no there's no doubt about it that it's it's totally unquestionable and the scripture says again in verse 3 that he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs so after he died he rose and he gave many undoubted proofs that he had rose from the grave in the forty days after his resurrection how many grateful for the resurrection amen oh my that's what our whole our whole faith is founded upon that and first Corinthians 15 Paul says if there's no resurrection you are yet in your sins without hope aren't you glad that Christ is raised and you're not in your sins anymore Amen I'm so thankful for that I'm so happy about that this morning now Matthew Henry said the proofs were infallible plain indicators both that he was alive and walked and talked with them he ate and ate and drank with them and that it was he himself and not another for he showed himself them again and again the marks of the wounds in his hands and his feet and aside which was the utmost proof the thing was capable of or required there were many and often repeated he was seen by them 40 days not constantly reciting with them but frequently appearing to them and bringing them by degrees to be fully satisfied concerning it so that all their sorrow for his departure was done away by it can you imagine those must have been some of the most exciting love you now we know Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we know Christ doesn't have to physically appear we know his body actually won't touch the earth until it's been burned by fire let me know that but we know that he appears to people in dreams we know that he appears to people in visions how many can say amen to that fact my mom just told us a story where she saw Jesus in a dream recently and was actually trying to get her to repent of her divorce ahum you know Jesus is still alive today jesus loves my mom so much she's trying to he's trying to correct her through dreams because brother Ram said if God can't get somebody believe for the preaching he'll go to another means he'll go through gifts of the Holy Spirit amen I just made me cry and rejoice this week that God is still working on my mom aren't you glad he's still working on you and me too as well oh I'm so glad he'll go to any lengths to bring his children to correction amen oh what a faithful father we serve today oh my hallelujah Christ staying upon earth so long after he had entered upon his state of exaltation and glory to confirm the faith of his disciples and comfort their hearts was such an incense of condescension and compassion to believers as may fully assure us that we have a high priest that is touched with the feeling of our infirmities amen hallelujah if Jesus spent 40 days proving to them over and over again that he's alive how much more can we believe that he's alive today to minister to all of our needs amen he ever liveth to make intercession for you and I he's alive today to help us this morning how many one has helped this morning amen I want to help everyday all the time all my thoughts all my actions I want the help of the Holy Spirit every day now there's 40 days of many infallible proofs according to the scripture and so I just was reading in my Bible and something drew me to my Scofield Bible and Scofield laid out the order or all the instances of scripture in which Jesus was seen after the resurrection I thought that would be a good thought to kind of review with the Saints so Scofield gave us this order of our Lord's appearance after his resurrection so if you have a Scofield Bible it's in Matthew 28 verse 6 I believe is where the note at the bottom gives you these events now I had to change the order at the end a little bit for some reason the order was a little off and I'll explain that in just a moment but the very first person he appeared to was Mary Magdalene a woman I mean oh jesus loves women amen geez doesn't degrade women Jesus lifts up the woman praise God that's exactly right Mary Magdalene the woman in which seven demons were cast out of Jesus showed himself to this former prostitute she was the first one to see the resurrected Christ amen infallible proof they men next the women returning from the tomb with the angelic message after they saw the angel they got to see the Lord Jesus as well so the first groups well were women and member they ran after that they ran back to where the disciples were staying and the disciples didn't believe him I mean oh Jesus later on come and rebuked them for not believing the sisters right they wouldn't believe the testimony of the sisters and so Jesus has to come by and rebuke them and say you should have believed and I think you know I mentioned it again I mentioned it before but people get on Thomas and call them doubting Thomas well all all the Apostles doubted they all doubted and so we shouldn't get on Thomas because you would have done the same thing without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you would acted the same way but the RAM said you would act in the same way Adam and Eve did in the guard of Eden right because we're human we're fallible we need a redeemer we need Christ help all the time amen and then sometime that afternoon Jesus revealed himself personally to Peter Oh God is rich in mercy Church so just makes my heart rejoice that God searched out and found Peter remember Peter and John ran down and John believed when he left but Peter didn't Peter didn't believe and so Jesus had to come to him sometime in the afternoon and show himself alive that's the third group the fourth group was on the road to emmaus with the disciples Cleophus and his friend yeah he showed himself alive and he reviewed himself through the breaking of the bread and that's how you and I come to know Jesus today it's the same Jesus that when when when someone's preaching to us the same Jesus that touches our hearts that feeds our soul that's how we know it's the same Jesus no matter which church rat no matter what night it is Wednesday night or Sunday morning or Sunday night where it is the same Jesus opens the bread the same way praise God he breaks the bed he reveals himself through the Word of God and they know him and we know him through the way he breaks his word to our hearts amen and then that night later that night on Resurrection night he revealed himself to his disciples except for Thomas 10 of them were there not Thomas so he revealed himself to the ten now the next scripture we have is 8 days later he reveals himself with Thomas present to the disciples so now there's already 6 times he's revealed himself he's shown himself that he's alive amen the 7th of courses to the 7 by the lake Tiberias when Peter said I go efficient and they all followed Peter ought to go fishing back to his regular occupation and then the Bible said this is striking in Galilee somewhere near there on a mountain to the apostles he revealed himself to five hundred brethren at once this is why the Bible said that there's many infallible proofs let's go to first Corinthians 15 let's let's read a verse 6 that's I want you to see that first Corinthians 15 verse 6 now this is estimated to be written around 59 ad so almost 27 years after the resurrection look what he says in 1st Corinthians 15:6 and after that now Paul's talking about the order which they saw Christ after that he was seen above five hundred brethren at once so more than five hundred of whom the greater part remain unto this present but fall asleep so Paul saying like you can go talk to most of these 500 people some of them had died but Paul saying you Corinthians you guys know you know he's risen from the dead so you can go talk to these people these people are alive and the thing that I love is no matter who you talk to her the 500 they'd all have the same story they'd all see the nail scars in his hands they'd all see the glorified body they'd all see the risen Christ because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he would have appeared the same way to all of them and they would have known that Christ was risen from the dead amen many infallible proofs Jesus didn't let them guess is he alive he proved to them he's alive and Church of you're a child of God if you want to know God God will prove himself to be alive to you amen I'm so glad he did hallelujah proved himself alive to me now the ninth is the nighttime I'm going to talk more on this later was at Jerusalem and Bethany he showed himself to James the brother of our Lord now we're going to preach more on that little later but this this was not this was not james the son of zebedee and james and john it wasn't that one nor was it james son of alphaeus it was a different this was the actual brother of Christ we know Jesus had at least four brothers and sisters we know there was at least seven in Jesus's family so he then he showed himself to his brother James his earthly pleasure or not fleshy but earthly brother they weren't really brothers because of course Jesus's blood was the blood of God huh me know that amen and then and then he ascended so 10 times at least Christ showed himself physically in the in the Corporal glorified body we'd say he showed himself to his disciples he when he ascended all eleven were there at his ascension as he gave the Great Commission and said go into world and preach the gospel to every creature but he said first go up to Jerusalem and get Phil wait for the promise of my father be born again amen that was the main thing go get born again and then go preach the gospel aren't you born again hey man I'm so thankful for it ha ha I could never preach until I was born again amen that's right church now after the resurrection the same year after Christ resurrected Stephen was getting stoned and Stephen was taken outside of Jerusalem to be stoned and Jesus in a division appeared to him in a vision and remember the Bible said he stood he stood to receive Steven and Steven said Lord receive my spirit lay this not to their charge and he fell asleep his face was like an angel amen the 12th time he appeared was near Damascus this is an eighty thirty five so two years later after the resurrection two years after Saul held the coats of the men that killed Stephen two years later Jesus had a meeting with him as well amen hallelujah she's had to make sure I got a he's a chosen vessel to me so God gave him two more years to persecute the church and then God got a hold of Saul's life and changed him to Paul praise the Lord and then years and years they let's read this one you're probably not remember this one this one kind of surprised me let's go to acts 22 I'd forgotten about this one Jesus literally appeared to saw or Paul in the temple in acts 22 17 I want you to see this tui this shows how merciful God is acts 22 17 is that right yeah I'm in the wrong chapter that's why I couldn't have trouble reading it to her he says and it came to pass that when I was coming into Jerusalem even while I prayed in the temple I was in a trance so now he's a prophet now he's in a vision and I saw him sang unto me so picture of the risen Christ make hay and get the quickly out of Jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me so how many know Jesus sometimes Jesus wants you to run from persecution how many know that if people are led in the persecution praise the Lord may God God will strengthen them you're nothing to fear if you know God is leading into persecution but here Jesus tells Paul your ministry is not done yet you need to get out of Jerusalem and it's interesting how Jesus does it because if you read the next to the chapter the next of the rest of the chapter Paul gets caught by a mob but he says well I'm a Roman they're gonna kill him because he's preaching Christ but he says I'm a wrong when you Jews can't kill me you got a you got a persecute me core to the roman laws and so then the government comes and saves paul and then he's locked up and those men swore a vow they're gonna kill Paul and we're what happened Paul's nephew saved him Paul's nephew a little young man save the prophet of God that's who Jesus used Jesus use a little young nephew of Paul to tell the Roman guards that these Jews are out there gonna kill him so they let him out a basket down the side of the prison that's our God God could have opened the doors like Peter but he didn't choose that he chose to use a nephew of Paul and I imagine his reward will be great on that day don't you think Church because Paul's gotten Christ told Paul look at verse chapter 23 11 let's go to twenty-three-eleven because God had told Paul Christ had told Paul your ministry is not done yet you must go to Rome and bear witness to me in Rome so God's Way this time was not opened up the doors like when Peter walked out of the prison but God's Way was taking him out of a basket down the side of the prison to preserve his prophet God his faithful church whether it looks like America or not it's still that hand of God amen it's still God saving you praise the Lord verse 11 and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified to me in Jerusalem so thou must bear also bear witness of me at Rome in the next chapter you know in verse on the same chapter verse 16 is where Paul's sister's son Paul's nephew alerts the guards and let them know that this profit is going to be killed unless they save him so they saved him amen so that would be the 13th time that Christ appeared by scripture infallible proofs that he had appeared his believers and the last one we know by Scripture was to John on the Isle of Patmos around 1896 all these infallible proofs now what was the proof for the believers the proof of the believers was their personal revelation of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah could they could they could Paul prove it to anybody no it was his personal revelation the 500 they couldn't prove it to anybody but they could all say I have seen the risen Christ so what does Jesus want today Jesus wants us today to have a personal revelation of him that we can tell others you might not believe but I know he's alive because he's revealed himself to me today amen hallelujah look at Morris we've got more on James the brother of our Lord this is such a beautiful story oh my now remember he was the ninth one at least in the scripture the ninth one to see the Lord now there's three James in the New Testament how many knew that there's more than one James there's three James the New Testament we'd say the first would be the brother of John James and John the sons of thunder they're the sons of Zebedee one of the he was one of the Twelve Apostles he was the first of the Twelve Apostles to be cured say eleven because Judas was in there that should be eleven sorry about that but I forgot about that he's first of the eleven apostles to be killed by King Herod Agrippa in at44 he was the first one to be killed of the apostles now of course Stephen was killed before that in a t-33 now the second James was James the less the son of Alphaeus one of the Twelve Apostles so there was two James that were apostles James this James is called James the greater the brother of John and he's called James the less oh my the Heligan verse three here's the James we would look at what a beautiful church this is a beautiful story of redemption let's take courage this morning how many love to serve the Lord take courage that this story and this doesn't encourage you nothing will but you'll be encouraged let me say that you'll be encouraged James the brother of our Lord was also the author of the book of James and he was a leader in the Jerusalem church now I got this reference from this website if you want it I can email that to you later I just put on there for reference I don't lose it you know sometimes you say well I saw it on a website or I heard it there and you we lose where it is that's why I try to I'm trying to save the references now look at this James was probably the oldest of Jesus earthly brothers so Jesus would have been the oldest he was Mary's firstborn James would have been next because they came and they they were astonished at Jesus wisdom and said is not this the carpenter's son isn't isn't his brother James Joseph Simon and Judas and that's Jude that's Jude who wrote Saint Jude those are his actual brothers because the Bible said the brother of our Lord and his sister so Jesus had at least seven he was at least one of seven siblings so I'm having my seventh child so I feel pretty good God will take care of my children by the grace of the heart if he'd take care of Jesus Christ one of seven he'll take care of mine as well because there's actually his sphere that formed them in my wife's womb amen and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things so this is the oldest second oldest of Mary and Joseph children here now James the brother of our Lord he lived with Jesus his entire life in church at first he did not even believe Jesus was the Messiah he even challenged the fact that Jesus was the Messiah can you imagine imagine living with a perfect sibling now Jesus never did anything wrong right he never made a mistake so see their hearts were not yet converted right his family members and so even though Jesus was perfect Satan had got a little foothold in all Jesus's brother and sisters hearts they had something against Jesus well he just mama's boy he's just dad's favorite you know he's just he's just the goody two-shoes we'd say they didn't believe the Bible said for neither did his brethren believe in him there's a couple of times in Scripture his mother and brothers and sisters all come to talk to Jesus and Jesus is busy preaching and they said Jesus your mother and brethren want to talk to you and he said who is my mother who is my brother look how he acted to his unsaved family members praise the Lord when he's in the midst of his preaching ministry who did he put first did he put his church first or he put his unsaved family members first he put his church first he said those who hear the word of God and follow me that my mother they're my brethren that's my true family amen who's your true family this morning those who love Jesus Christ our Lord amen that's your true family now of course we know Mary believed I'm not saying Mary wasn't a believer but she had to take care of the children she was a believer cuz the angel told her I didn't mean to say like that but I think you understand what I'm saying his brethren didn't believe that the siblings did not believe that Jesus said who he was even the Bible said Jesus's friends walked up to him and said you're mad you know the Bible said that the Bible said you're beside yourself they walked up to Jesus he's preaching they'd heard about miracles they'd heard about all these water to wine and different things and his friends walk up and say Jesus you're outside of your mind come on you didn't earn that water to wine come on oh you didn't heal that sick person you didn't do that now let this ought to encourage us here because those that that are close to us think about your brothers and sisters think about your parents that don't believe the message or your family or your children that don't believe the message they might not believe for 20 or 30 years it's actually factual that James did not believe in Christ as the Messiah for all those years he didn't believe he didn't believe until after Jesus resurrected amen imagine your own brother dying and then resurrecting how could you deny it any longer James couldn't because Jesus hand-picked out his brother James and said I'm gonna reveal myself to James so James knows that I'm alive amen now look look at the Bible said and after seeing the resurrected Lord Jesus according to first Corinthians 15 7 James was in the upper room to receive the Holy Ghost amen all of Jesus family after he proved himself real they all went up to the upper room to be born again amen does God care about your unsaved family members you better believe it amen your job is to live as close to Christ as you possibly can and trust that God will bring them in amen now we can't prove we can't guarantee they're going to be saved but one thing we can do is ask that they can be saved amen and we can sanctify our lives that they might be saved how many know Jesus did that Jesus sanctified himself for our sakes haha amen the Bible said they all continued with one Accord in prayer and supplication with women and the Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren so the same brothers that would cross their arms and say you're mad you're beside yourself you're a carpenter what are you doing what are you trying to do are you a false prophet you think you're some fantastic new rabbi the same brothers that doubted are now praying and say God send us the Holy Ghost that was on our brother Jesus amen almost have had that desire this morning o Lord send your power amen glory and if God can change the hearts of unsaved loved ones then he can do it today hallelujah that's what that's what that's my brother cams testimony so powerful for a whole year he fought Simon and I he was like a scriptural battle he didn't like the message he didn't like William Branham he didn't like the Word of God he didn't like all of our doctrines but it took one year and he finally got hungry after fighting for a year he finally got hungry he went to Craig's house in Florida her brother Brooks preached and on the way home God opened his heart and said the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ can I be baptized tonight so brother Brooks turned around from Lima drove an hour back and baptized him that very night and now cams been pastor and what I've been passed from 12 years he's been pastor nine years I believe by the grace of Lord God is the only word who can change the sinner's heart and God if he changed our hearts let's believe for the hearts of our family members don't give up Jesus didn't give up you and I can't give up let's serve the Lord as a sanctified as we possibly can in the head this is James testimony he went from he's my brother I've seen him he gets tired he gets sick he gets weak how could he be the Messiah to believing and being filled with the same power that was on Christ oh my god we find him in 80 46 this is 13 years after the Holy Ghost found him we find him as a leader at the Council of Jerusalem after the Gentiles got the Holy Ghost they all said we gotta have a counsel about this how is God going to the Gentiles I thought this was for the Jews and they all came to Jerusalem and had that had that great counsel and said well Gentiles just now keep these four things Gentiles you know don't eat blood don't fornicate and always forget the other two I can't remember no idols and I can't always remember Kemp for I always forget that last one but James was there and after they had told the testimony James spoke and he said Simeon hath declared how God at first admitted the Gentiles to take out a people for his namesake so he's the first Jew to speak up at the Council of Jerusalem after the other Jews have testified corneas got the Holy Ghost the Gentiles got the Holy Ghost the first Jew to speak up was James the oldest of second oldest brother of Christ there he went from being a doubter of the message to a leader in the message hallelujah all by the power of Jesus Christ amen I love it years later when Paul visits Jerusalem the church pause James is known as a pillar in the church he was a doubter he went from doubter to pillar praise the Lord because when Peter got out of prison he said I'm sorry got into prison he was brought into prison and he said go show these things unto James and to their brethren so the first person Peter thinks of who should I tell that I'm in prison it was James the brother of our Lord the one who used to doubt that Jesus was the Messiah but now he's lived in the Bible of the history said he lived such a godly life then he was martyred right outside the temple we'll get to that in just a little bit so he doubted for all those years but then he got converted and then he was the one who one of the ones that lived the closest to Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit was James and he became a pillar in the church in other words you say who's the strongest people in the church James would come up to your lips well James he's a real pillar of the church he's one of the faithful Saints he's a believer if there is a believer it's all James the brother of our Lord ha ha ha what a testimony hey man I want that to be my testimony don't want to be here testimony I want to be a pillar in the Church of the Living God because when Paul comes back to Jerusalem the Bible said and I saw James Cephas Peter and John who seemed to be pillars they perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go into the heathen and they unto the circumcision praise the Lord he was known as the leader he was known as a pillar when he doubted and said I don't believe that he God so changes heart the reality of the revelation of Jesus Christ as Messiah was so powerful he became a leader in the church a man just makes me happy I feel like happened to me praise God amen now he said this is where he says it in Galatians 1 this is around a t56 so remember 80-43 he was already a leader after corneas got the Holy Ghost by Peters preaching and then 13 years later here in a t56 Paul goes to Jerusalem the first time and said neither when I have to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and a boat within 15 days but none of the other apostles saw none say James the Lord's brother now Jude says Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James in Christian circles there was really only one man named James that was James the brother of the Lord because James the brother of John he died so early in the apostolic ministry so after that though you remember the the books of the Bible weren't written right away till sometimes 20 or 30 years after Jesus raised from the dead so these books of Saint st. James and st. Jude these are written 20-some years after Christ raised and so the only man really known as James at that time was James the brother of our Lord so Jude was the brother of James praise the Lord now here's how James died what a gallant man he died in AD 62 according to tradition James was thrown down from the temple by the scribes and Pharisees then he was stoned in his brains - out with the Fuller's Club and that awful but that's what they did because he was such a godly man he wrote the book of James which which you know if you know anything about the book of James it's one of the most practical applications of the gospel to a Christians life it was the first letter that was even written to Christians was the book of James and I've heard it called recently I read online where James is called the Proverbs of the new testament because it's so practical you can learn so much like if you see somebody cold and you don't give them a coat you don't really have faith if you see somebody hungry you don't give them food don't really have faith faith without works is that how many want living faith this morning amen remember that with blood that just kind of came here I saw remember they dashed his head his head in they talked about Stephen but actually also happened not only Stephen but also James the brother of our Lord my and think about today think about how the Gospels so watered down by millions of people they say Oh God has a great plan for your life in other words they're trying to think oh God wants you to be a millionaire or God wants you to be a CEO how many have heard and prosperity preachers preach that or you just yeah they paint this picture that you know God is just he has a great plan for your life well we'll look at the plan for James's life how many want that plan for God God's plan for your life if it's God's will for me than I like it whatever God had planned has for my life the perfect will of God I want to be obedient to the perfect will of God but God's plan was so spiritually beautiful for James's life he had almost 30 years to preach the gospel because he got the Holy Ghost in a t-33 and he got to preach 29 years that Jesus Christ is alive amen oh what a blessing amen I just been preaching 14 years I sure like to have 30 years hey if God had granted to me before my time to go or whatever if the rapture happens but look what a testimony he doubted it he fought against it you're mad I don't believe it you're just my brother to being fully supportive of it and preaching for 30 years and giving his life as a testimony that Jesus Christ is alive he's raised from the dead he is the Messiah day amen hallelujah praise the Lord that's the testimony of James the brother of our Lord how he appreciate that testimony amen now I want to show you some more proofs that I read a book and I never finished it but somebody handed me a book when I first got saved when I was 19 at the chapel and I wanted to go through just some of these proofs just briefly here before we bring it down to close there's proofs from this book called more than a carpenter by Josh McDowell that's actually the copy of the one that was given to me it's it's the very same cover rather how many ever read that book any when I read that book no okay so somebody handed me this book I want you to see the actual proofs Jesus you know the Bible said there was infallible proofs and we know that and those infallible proofs were actually eyewitnesses that saw Jesus Christ alive that's what the infallible proofs are but Church no one today is alive that did that right they've all gone to the grave but they all gone to the paradise waiting for the rapture amen the sixth dimension are those believers but we can still prove through our testimony that Jesus Christ is alive today how many can say amen to that you can be a you can have the infallible proof in your life as well amen I know I do I know you did to the first in his book he said the thing that proved Jesus was God was that he's the only one that claimed to be God and backed it up Buddha Confucius Muhammad none of them actually claimed to be God Muhammad just claimed to be as the last prophet remember and at Jesus trial he was really not tried for what he did he was tried for who he said he was that's why they killed him because you're a man making yourself God you blaspheme now of course he did good works and you know but they all said oh he's got all good things that we we there's nothing wrong he's an innocent man we find no guilt in Christ he wasn't put on trial for what he did necessarily but for who he said he was the Bible said that he told this to Philip he said have I been eaten Phillips has showed me the father remember that he said show me the Father and Jesus said have I been so long with you he said that yet thou has not known me Philip he that hath seen me has seen the father Oh Dory amen now we can't say that because we are not the image of the invisible God we are not the fullness of the Godhead bodily but you can say when you see me you've seen a manifestation of the father we can say that praise the Lord because where where did the seat in your soul come from did it come visit a serpent seed or is it a seed of God if it's from God then you're a part of God hey man the soul the soul is a part of God it's quicken it's a quicken seed from God himself amen that's right in Jesus no one else ever said this but Jesus said before Abraham was I already am how did you know Moses or how did you know Abraham you're not even 50 years old he said before Abraham was I am he said because I am Abraham's God manifests in the flesh that's exactly right and that's what separates Christ from all others he claimed to be God and he backed it up with his life no man can accuse Christ of any sin the second thing Jesus claimed to be the only way to salvation and forgiveness of sins no one else says that he said if you believe not that I'm he you shall die in your sins oh we should believe with all of our hearts amen jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man comes in the Father but by me so forgiveness only comes through Christ salvation only comes through Christ he claimed to do this and we know it's true praise the Lord that's another proof that he's alive today he claimed this and backed this up a third thing the historical method can prove Jesus's existence he actually existed on the earth and his testimony now the scientific method cannot prove Jesus existence because scientific method you have to be able to prove it repeatedly over and over again just like George Washington the scientific method cannot prove George Washington was here but the historical method can prove George Washington lived if you take all the history documents remember I read this last year there's a doctorate a preacher named Bodhi Baucom he said that scholars have over 6,000 copies of the New Testament text that all greed that all agree 6000 the earliest copy was written before 120 ad so around 30 40 years after the last text was written because remember the originals eventually went went they just went to ashes you know they just integrated and plus they have thousands of other copies of numerous church fathers and their commentaries which all agree on the authenticity of Scripture so you have 6,000 texts of New Testament Plus you have thousands of Church Fathers that all wrote about the text and they all agree now compare that to Aristotle the philosopher the earliest copy was written around 14 years after the original so we have copies that were just 30 or 40 years after the original but they don't know but these unbelievers their earliest copy is 1400 years after the original and remember Homer's Iliad only has 10 less than 10 manuscripts Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars that they take you know the history of Julius Caesar from the Roman Empire they only have ten manuscripts the New Testament has over 6,000 manuscripts God wanted everybody to know that my son was here and these testimonies are true praise God hallelujah I love this Josh McDowell said this there exists no document from the ancient world witnessed by so excellent a set of textual and historical testimonies no other history about any other person has even a close as good of a set as historical proof as the gospel of Jesus Christ in offering social suburban array of historical data on which an intelligent decision may be made an honest person cannot dismiss a source of this kind skepticism regarding the historical credentials of Christian is based upon an irrational bias in other words you just don't want to believe because you just don't want to believe Christianity has more proof more historical documents than any other non-christian source God the Bible said God will never leave himself without a witness amen hallelujah now this is all on top of how we are supposed to have personal revelations of Christ the personal revelation of Christ is the infallible proof but on top of that God gave you more evidence that God gave you more proof he gives you his storico proof as well amen here's another proof he goes through Jesus's followers willingly died for the truth now Jesus followers and apostles would not willingly die for a lie especially if they knew it was a lie cuz no one willingly dies like that if they knew it was a lie now you say what about Muslims that die for their sins well I was thinking on this some skeptics say that Muslims die for their faith but they die different deaths than Christian martyrs how we know that it's not the same type of death Muslims die as guilty murderers and the church said when they go blow themselves up or whatever they do or you know in a plane or the you know like the 9/11 whatever they do they die as guilty murders in suicide but Christian martyrs die innocently as lambs they die alone and they die in faith obedience to the Word of God amen hallelujah they're two totally different kinds of death amen see that the Muslim may think it's true but he's deceived because he's dying in sin but a Christian has been revealed to him that Christ is alive and he dies innocent he dies with no blood on his hands amen glory hallelujah what a difference the followers willingly died for the truth of Christ they're not dying for a lie like those people that'll burn themselves and oh we need more rights and all these things they're dying for a lie they're dying that for politics but a Christian is dying for the resurrected Christ remember the beater said we've not followed cunningly devised fables these are not stories that are made up when we made known unto you the power of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by but were eyewitnesses of his majesty that's what we're believing we are believing eyewitnesses and look what John said many other signs truly did Jesus and the friends of his disciples which are not written this book but these are written that you might believe amen I mean how do you know when you read the Bible your faith Rises you're reading eyewitness testimonies amen hallelujah when you read the book of Genesis you're yeah the book of Genesis and Exodus you're reading a testimony of an eyewitness Moses saw the Death Angel pass amen Moses all the plagues fall Moses sold the Red Sea part he was the eye witness of the power of God amen so all the apostles so his brother branham so are we we're eyewitnesses of the power of God when you've seen Jesus do America when you've seen God in those dream or you've seen God speak to you God reveal your heart you have seen the resurrected Christ you've seen him manifest himself today the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah and we read our Bible it ought to become more real to us the Holy Spirit meditate upon these things the Holy Spirit makes us believe even more how many are witness of that hallelujah this is the one I love I love this one the changes in Jesus apostles and followers including st. Paul prove the resurrection was a reality as well as the changes in your own life this is a proof that the resurrection actually happened the hope of Jesus apostles were shattered after his crucifixion remember they were hiding away they were hiding away on Sunday morning because member they thought Jesus was going to conquer Rome like a physical Conqueror but jesus said My Kingdom is not of this world it's a spiritual Kingdom and after the resurrection the entire outlook and direction changed from hiding out they got the Holy Ghost and they started spreading out hey men glory even as we learned about st. James st. James no longer delight deny this about his brother he was one of the leading creatures in it even st. Paul's conversion from a vet vehement anti-christian to a faithful sufferer of the cross of Christ for 25 years proves he had seen the resurrected Christ this proves it history documents prove that saw I got converted into Paul all history all these documents they prove it this was a real man and he spent 25 years not in luxury like Christians many Christians do today but he spent it suffering to give God glory amen 25 years of suffering I like the preacher say today why if I don't have my own jet I get tired out can you imagine the Apostle Paul saying that he'd get on boats and he'd travel I'm sorry something went out he would travel and he would he'd get beat and memory got shipwrecked close at five times he got shipwrecked remember that church remember all that the resume that he had five times he was shipwrecked I believe he didn't have no speedboat or anything like that he now had the finest clothes he was a prophet of God he suffered but he's willing to suffer because he knows Jesus is alive that's right now Church don't forget this you and I have experienced the resurrection to some degree not the physical body yet but you should have been resurrected in your soul let me know that so see that's why we can get excited today even if I've never seen a dead person raised I physically I know I've been raised spiritually the Bible says that the Bible says we don't have time to read all this but the Bible said you were dead in your sins but now you've been quickened or made alive together with Christ by grace you're saved and has raised us up together amen Oh Church used to live way down here but now Christ has raised you up in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen he's lifted your life your life was dead it was useless it was hopeless dead but you should have felt him lift you up into heavenly places that's the power of the Resurrection today that's why I can rejoice and know I know Christ raised because I've been raised because he raised me amen that's exactly right and see that's an infallible proof to me that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead it ought to be to YouTube look at Colossians 2:12 he says the same thing you're buried with him by baptism so if you really died out to your will when you got baptized where and you're also risen with him if you really died at your baptism than you really raised at your baptism hallelujah through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all your trespasses amen not just some of your sins Church all your sins that's what he did when he raised you from your dead life of sin your life of lusts your life of greed your life of anger and hatred and pride when he raised you from that he raised you up and forgave you all your trespasses oh thank you Jesus amen hallelujah so now they were raised what this is where we battle Church now if you're raised what are we seeking our lives the Bible said we must seek those things which are above that's why we get discouraged as Christians we if we're all if we're sincere we can all see our life has changed but then we get discouraged with things in life we can discourage why does this happen why didn't that why does it more of this happen or why didn't why did this have to happen but we must constantly seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and everything else will be added unto us that's right if you're is it how many risen with Christ this morning glory if you're risen we need to seek for things above we need to spend our time seeking the will of God seeking treasures in heaven if we've been raised and we're no longer dead we should live for what we've been raised up into heavenly places Oh hallelujah set your feelings set your affections on things above not on things of the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God this was an infallible proof that Christ raised the change in people's lives to see them go from dead not doing the will of God to the will of God that's an infallible proof Jesus Christ raised from the dead hey men Romans six we don't have time to read all but one to eighteen but therefore we are buried with him by baptism unto death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in the newness of life how many walk in a new life I know you can say you can say I know I don't walk like I used to I walk in the ways of God I walk in the Word of God our walk should feel brand new to us amen likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord let not sin therefore reign or rule in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof amen so we should walk in a new newness of life and we should rule over all the temptations of sin and this is what we read last year where we preached on last year for Easter Peter said we also have a more sure word of prophecy where until ye do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine ahthe in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts how many can say that your heart was once a very dark place your mind used to be a very dark place filled with hatred filled with greed and lust and it used to be a very dark place er where where you knew it was dark because the words that came out of your mouth were dark right because jesus said through from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh all but one day the day star arose in your hearts and the darkness was scattered by the light of Christ love how do you praise the Lord Amen my heart is not dark anymore my heart has light shining in it the light of Christ's glory number six is the empty tomb the only scenario of the empty tomb and missing body of Christ that any historical support is that Jesus literally raised from the dead some people say oh no he faked it you know he had some ate some weeds or something like that and slept and then he married Mary Magdalene and went off to India there's all these guests out there but there's no historical proof for that why because we know there's six thousand documents plus thousands others that all say the same thing that Jesus Christ literally raised from the dead now look what he says he said MacDonald has a reasonable answer for each scenario so they in the book he goes through all the different scenarios well you know he was drugged or he moved to India he faked his death they go through all the scenarios and though he does not a test absolute certainty he clearly states that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is either one of the most wicked vicious heartless hoaxes ever foisted upon people or it is the most important fact in history you and I believe it was the most important fact in all of history amen so there's no middle ground all the evidence says this it's either the biggest hoax or it is the most important day in all history you can't sit on any middle ground and we're standing on the ground with Christ amen he did raise he is alive today he's the same today amen lastly I think this is the last one yeah so the book goes through these the prophecies Jesus fulfilled some scholars say there's 300 prophecies of Christ from the Old Testament that were fulfilled in the new some were spoken as much as four thousand years before Christ four thousand years chairman from Pasadena College estimated that the probability of one man fulfilling just eight of those prophecies would be one in 10 to the 17th power that's one in that's one in 100 quadrillion that's the possibilities of one man just fulfilling eight of those not all 300 just eight of them and Jesus fulfilled all 300 church amen that's right church that's exactly the word he for he remember he said not one jot or tittle will pass from this word to every word be fulfilled amen remember David wrote about the crucifixion before crucifixion was even invented a thousand years before Christ and Jesus comes on the scene and fulfills all of them in a matter of a short thirty three-year period most of them were fulfilled we know in the last hours of his life the references to the cross and the crucifixion now that's just my notes I must get past that let's close with this here there's one more infallible proof that can be stated this wasn't in the book but this is what we know this were brother Bram labored on the Jesus's power in the Apostles amen infallible proof jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go to my father these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall we praise the Lord I've seen numerous of those happen in my life jesus said this is what will follow a true believer they'll do the works that Christ did hallelujah look at acts 4 said if we this day be examined the good deed done to the impotent man the miracle of the impotent man walking at the gate beautiful by what means he's made whole be it known unto you are unto the all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God hath raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand before you hope this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there's none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness so they saw the power of Christ then they saw the boldness of Christ when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they'd been with Jesus how are people gonna know that you and I been with Jesus they see the power of God in our lives there's that right and they see our bonus for Christ amen that's how they're gonna know oh they've met Jesus they've been with Jesus they've felt the Holy Spirit they've been baptized by the Holy Ghost they're gonna know because of the power and boldness in our lives that's exactly right later on the chapter the Bible said when they believed they were of one heart in one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common and with great power gave the Apostles witness of the resurrection the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them can you say men this is another infallible proof how do you know because Jesus did miracles through the disciples he promised he would and he did the miracles amen now let's close with a few quotes brother Graham I went through some of the quotes on brother branham's thoughts on the infallible proofs programs saying this in commemoration of our Lord Jesus who has raised him from the dead and standing here now in our myths of showing signs and wonders of his resurrection infallible proofs that he's risen from the dead and is not dead but he's living in his church aren't you glad he's living in his church we thank thee for this and bless this girl and grant her request in Jesus Christ's name he said bless you young sister and his mercies be upon you sir burhan tells us where Christ is living today he's living in you and I praise the Lord he said wow this is a different sermon what a wonderful fellowship together I believe with all my heart that today this little old Tabernacle will see the direct evidence that Jesus Christ raised from the dead visible before their eyes God healing the sick doing great signs and wonders that the Great Commission included so in 1955 brother Graham said I believe we're gonna call the sick up and they're going to be healed and you're gonna see people healed with your very own eyes and he said that's direct every that Jesus Christ is alive hey how many ever seen somebody healed in a service they come back and testified of it later I know I've been healed twice in service I literally walked in sick or what got sick and serviced and walked out well by the grace of the Lord see this is a sign and brother I'm saying you are gonna see evidence an infallible proof that Christ is alive when the sick come up and they get healed right in the service amen he's that great atonement that was made at the Calvary included these things and to me at the infallible proofs of his resurrection hallelujah after he raised from the dead he said you must go into all the world and preach this gospel to every creature the sign shall accompany them that believe huni believers we have a couple more and you can have all the Cathedral all the rubbings dumb out Catholics how they rub down the the toes of the statues and all the everything else you want but give me the resurrected power that I can see the Lord Jesus today has the lily of the valley in the morning star that seals it to me that I can say with Jove of old I know my redeemer lives amen now this is a sermon when I was listening to this week he said but I believe with all my heart God is going to let us have the service this morning as we have asked him to do it now I believe that he will do it therefore if he will by his great presence and his omnipotence that means then that he is in our presence how would it be the presence of Christ is here he said wherever two or three gathered how many believe he's here by God's grace and what a wonderful time on Easter morning to find the resurrected Lord Jesus walking among men walking here as an infallible indelible proof that he did raise from the dead o most privileged people we would be if Christ walks among us this morning the living resurrected Christ how privileged are we church that the Holy Spirit walks among us this morning amen the same one that raised 2,000 years ago is walking amongst us today and willing to help us if we just ask him believe LeGrande said that's my contentions is what I've been contending for that Jesus is not dead he's not he's alive very much alive and will be forevermore and if God will just let us by his grace I believe this morning that we can prove to you beyond any shadow of doubt by the help of the Holy Ghost that Jesus did actually raised from the dead and is living right here today living right here in the building amen key Majan I wonder where Jesus would be this morning if he's here I wonder where he's at well I know many times he stands to the rock like brother have said the angel Lord was standing right here and that be the Ange of the Lord right where would it be if Christ is in our midst where would he be he beat all those who have a hungry heart for the gospel he be seeking number broham said with the visions and in the prayer lines he would see the pillar of fire go from one person to the next whoever would be believing the holy spirit tried to get each person to believe and I've read the quotes before I don't have mirror but Lorenzo he's trying to get to get the unities or when I was going over here and he's going over here Christ is in our midst he r trying to help us he's walking here with us he is here amen amen he's living right here in the building this morning Jesus Christ because he's alive and well he said I see someone coming I see seen a vision I see some coming from far away it's coming in a place it's the man he comes from a country where there's lots of trees it's Virginia suffering with arthritis you believe God heals you and makes you well you accept it you do you come from Virginia here to be here two bars rise is that right all the way do yes sir you're healed now you can go back with your heart he said and your heart trouble has left you turn out of the line and go back here well God makes you well thy faith has saved thee so there's one thing we need this morning Church for God to minister to us we just need faith in his word let's turn our feet he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you believe he's raised from the dead he said the congregation says amen the infallible proofs of his resurrection he said have faith how many of Jesus Christ is here this morning I believe with all my heart he comes to that he comes to the rejected Church you know I was look at my friends Facebook this morning I'll just put some pictures of Facebook of our family on there and some of our friends that claim to know Jesus we're in concerts last night rock and roll concerts do you think Jesus can visit their church this morning probably not when they go there and smoke and drink it and dance the worldly things and those are spirits of demons on those singers and dancing like that where could Jesus find a church that loves the righteousness of His Holiness this morning could he find that here this morning could he walk in our midst and help us out this morning I believe he's more than able to do that by God's grace but one thing we need is faith in God's Word brother if you come and play that that's pressing have faith in God if anyone has a need this morning let's just have a word of Prayer and then we'll invite you up if anyone has any needs I'm gonna go back to that quote Jesus Christ walking among men today the same Christ not in a corporal body but in his we say glorified her the Holy Ghost of theophany Christ he's here but in a different body the resurrected Christ oh I'm so happy about that this morning I'm so happy that he's raised me up I know what the resurrections like because he's raised my life up oh that's why each there's always so glorious because I know what I can understand part of that you were dead in sins and now you're raised up in heavenly places now we can come and we can spend time with Christ and we can worship and we
