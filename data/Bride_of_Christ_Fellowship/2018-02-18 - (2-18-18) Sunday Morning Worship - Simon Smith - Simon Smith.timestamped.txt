[43:18] lovely Lord Jesus will praise your Holy
[43:20] Name thank you though chief you know
[43:25] Saints if you wanna stand for the
[43:26] reading of word just real show where the
[43:29] Lord's been really dealing with me since
[43:30] Wednesday actually the last couple of
[43:32] months he's been really trying to get me
[43:34] to break and I had a real good
[43:35] breakthrough last Wednesday at service
[43:38] God came down on me I know that and I
[43:42] love him more than I ever have before
[43:44] and when that presence comes down it's
[43:49] just you and him all these people if he
[43:52] would choose to come down right now and
[43:54] touch each one of you none of the rest
[43:57] would even matter to any of you it would
[43:59] just be you and the King and when you
[44:02] get into that presence nothing matters
[44:05] it doesn't matter how you act how you
[44:06] think how you it's all worship it's all
[44:10] divine love to the king our Lord and
[44:13] Savior Jesus Christ he's real and he
[44:19] right now as Jesus spoke and I believe
[44:22] was John for right now he's still
[44:24] looking for true worshipers that can
[44:28] worship in spirit and in truth not just
[44:32] truth but in spirit as well we could
[44:37] turn to Leviticus 23 15
[44:44] I don't know if I've taught this here or
[44:48] not before I can't remember but I feel
[44:51] led to teach it today hopefully you guys
[44:56] can get the screen here by God's grace
[45:06] [Music]

[45:42] Sabbath shall ye number fifty days what

[45:47] what the seven church ages went to
[45:48] Pentecost or to the day of the atonement
[45:52] and ye shall offer a new meat offering
[45:55] unto the Lord and verse 17 says and ye
[46:01] shall bring out of your habitations two

[47:22] the scripture many things that the Bride
[47:26] of Christ is looking forward to the
[47:30] seven seals have been broken they've
[47:32] been revealed but I still believe
[47:37] there's more of this word to open up by
[47:39] God's grace and we won't go far but I
[47:44] just feel led to teach on this by God's
[47:46] grace just want to hit it if we're going
[47:48] back to this here in Leviticus and it

[48:41] there I don't know brother Jesse's ever
[48:42] taught on this before amen and you shall
[48:46] bring out of your habitations to wave
[48:47] lows of 210 Steel's is there anything
[48:51] missing here in John 6 verse 48 he says
[48:59] I am the bread of life which come down
[49:03] from heaven that any man hath thereof
[49:05] and not and shall he says and not die
[49:08] right what was he saying here he's
[49:12] I am that Bread of Life how did Jesus
[49:16] Christ become the bread he said I am the
[49:22] bread that come down from heaven Jesus
[49:24] Christ and the old testament was the
[49:26] type of the meal which what the grain
[49:29] would come in and they'd used this
[49:30] special buran dinner to slice every
[49:33] chunk of that of grain exactly the same
[49:36] and that meal typed Christ absolutely
[49:39] and then the Holy Ghost anointed come
[49:43] down looking for Mary one day and said
[49:46] Mary you're gonna have a son named him
[49:48] Jesus and God sent that meal down and
[49:52] placed it within Mary he was not bread
[49:55] then that was not the bread that was the
[49:59] meal it was a type of Christ and as
[50:02] their bread that meal I'm sorry starts
[50:04] to grow and become a man at age thirty
[50:08] now that meal is about ready to become
[50:11] bread but what must the bread how do you
[50:13] make bread you have to have that meal
[50:15] first and the male must be pure it was
[50:20] sinless it was perfect he said that corn
[50:23] of wheat he was that wheat he was that
[50:25] meal yes and John the Prophet goes and
[50:31] says there's the Lamb of God and the
[50:35] Lamb of God the word came to the prophet
[50:37] and the Prophet took this meal and he
[50:41] began to place into the water
[50:44] and then the oil came down and now we
[50:46] have some bread hallelujah yes now we
[50:51] have the word so what would he call that
[50:55] not it's a dough it became dough right
[50:59] and he was not bread then even yet he
[51:03] takes the meal add some water and some
[51:06] oil and you have now the dough how do
[51:08] you make the bread directly after the
[51:12] baptism a water and if the Holy Ghost
[51:15] with that meal of Jesus Christ the Bible
[51:18] said he was led up of the spirit to go
[51:21] what into the desert and he was
[51:25] in fire temptations for 40 days and 40
[51:28] nights oh yes
[51:31] and that's when he became the bread and
[51:34] he said right here he's not on that
[51:37] bread which came down from heaven a man
[51:40] praise be to God the bread that came
[51:45] down from heaven praise be to God he
[51:52] says your father's did eat manna in the
[51:54] wilderness he says in our dad he says
[51:55] this is the bread which cometh down a
[51:58] man praise God he says I am that Living
[52:00] bread and I remember what fell it was
[52:03] the the manna fell first but then they
[52:05] had to grind it and mix it up and then
[52:07] they made cakes out of that see it was
[52:09] that meal he says I am The Living bread
[52:12] which came down from heaven If any man
[52:14] eat of this bread and shall live forever
[52:16] and the bread which I give is my flesh
[52:18] which I give for the life of the world
[52:20] a man praise God the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:27] is perfect his award is perfect amen
[52:32] yes I love him love him so much
[52:36] in the Old Testament we had your
[52:39] Tabernacle right here he everything in
[52:42] here was symbolic what of the New
[52:44] Testament church Christians life correct
[52:48] notice we taught earlier on before on
[52:51] the east gate this is the lion gate
[52:53] right here absolutely he says we had to
[52:56] go through that east gate and right here
[52:58] at the entrance of this is the East
[53:00] opening and East opening as well right
[53:03] here in the holiest of Holies that was
[53:04] in the eastern opening one it had to be
[53:06] a lion lion lion anointing absolutely to
[53:09] go all the way through there absolutely
[53:11] and as you go through here you have the
[53:13] altar right here where they did the
[53:14] sacrifices then you head to the the
[53:17] brass slab or where they washed it
[53:18] absolutely we must repent and be
[53:21] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ why
[53:24] because he was our sacrifice and then as
[53:28] we go beyond now beyond that abreast
[53:31] labra we go into now the holy place
[53:33] correct and then there was three I
[53:37] believe things
[53:38] specifically there's the the
[53:40] candlesticks the seven golden
[53:41] candlesticks
[53:42] there's the altar of incense and then
[53:44] there was a table of shewbread right
[53:47] absolutely he says and thou shalt set
[53:52] the table without the veil and the
[53:54] candlestick over against the table on
[53:57] the side of to hammer towards the south
[53:59] so that was the seven golden
[54:02] candlesticks was on the south part right
[54:05] and remember revelations one that Christ
[54:08] was in the midst of the seven golden
[54:09] candlesticks and he he held those things
[54:12] right he was in the midst right but
[54:14] notice he says and thou shalt put the
[54:16] table on the north side absolutely the
[54:19] north side is not the east is not the
[54:22] South is not the west but it represents
[54:24] what the north side or the ego side
[54:26] absolutely that food was set on the
[54:29] north because that's where eagles are
[54:31] right there and they must eat this bread
[54:34] absolutely so praise God
[54:39] here's another little picture here
[54:40] showing the what the north side the
[54:42] south side and then right here on the
[54:44] east entering right before you go into
[54:47] the Shekinah glory is that altar of
[54:49] incense which the Prophet broke he said
[54:51] that is the prayers of the saints
[54:52] absolutely we must get down on our knees
[54:54] and really see God and pray not a dry
[54:57] eye confession or dry this it must be
[55:00] with what sighing and crying for the
[55:02] abominations done what in the world know
[55:04] is the abomination is done within the
[55:07] holy city within Israel itself the
[55:11] corruption that was done in that Old
[55:14] Testament God warns them says we have to
[55:18] cry out for our own people jesus said I
[55:22] did not pray for the world he says but I
[55:24] pray for those that was sent for him I
[55:26] praise God we must sign cry for what the
[55:29] last members of this bride a man and
[55:31] also for the foolish words of Jesus and
[55:34] I'll not lose one ha ha yes praise be to
[55:38] God
[55:45] behind the old temple in the veil he
[55:48] says what was behind there what was
[55:50] Jehovah he says he was hiding back there
[55:52] he says what was the the veil hiding oh
[55:55] hi Louise as well as the veil idea was
[55:57] hitting it was hiding the word he says
[56:00] the veil the old badger skins was hidden
[56:02] hiding the word to their eyes natural
[56:05] behind there also was the shewbread
[56:07] if you think about that temple again
[56:09] remember if that if that temp that
[56:12] Tabernacle the inner courtyard the Holy
[56:15] Place the holiest of Holies if that was
[56:16] all hidden to natural Israel see that
[56:19] was a shadow type they would never be
[56:22] able to understand because all of Israel
[56:24] only the priesthood and that priesthood
[56:27] the Levites represented the bride of
[56:30] Jesus Christ absolutely so all of
[56:33] natural Israel would not be able to
[56:35] understand her to go in there and see
[56:37] exactly how it's set up
[56:39] and what it's all about but only the
[56:41] priests would be able to type the bride
[56:45] everything that's why they had doors to
[56:48] everything so the natural Jews would
[56:49] never be able to see behind there also
[56:56] with the shewbread see behind there was
[56:59] a Shekinah glory but was all hid from
[57:01] them it was all hid all the glory of God
[57:03] was right behind that old Badger skin
[57:06] that's right to hide all hid to the
[57:10] natural eye that's right a man he says
[57:17] notice the old temple had in the
[57:19] Shekinah glory in the light of the
[57:21] Shekinah over the word and the word is
[57:24] the seed see it's the green it is the
[57:27] very grain or the meal he says it
[57:30] brought forth the shewbread to believers
[57:33] only so that that table of shewbread
[57:37] that that 12 loaves was only to the what
[57:41] he says to the believers the true
[57:44] believers of the word of God absolutely
[57:46] in his word on the north side the ego
[57:48] side he says the blood also will upon
[57:51] the Covenant the blood is on the water
[57:53] and the water then life life is the
[57:55] grain and the
[57:56] wheat and the seed which is the word
[57:59] absolutely he says and it brought forth
[58:03] the Shekinah glory shined upon the word
[58:06] which brought forth the shewbread and
[58:08] the shewbread was just for a chosen
[58:10] people huh huh that right it was on the
[58:16] north side that table set on the north
[58:20] side by God's grace he says it was and
[58:24] now look what he likens it to what the
[58:26] word of this day he says and it ripe was
[58:28] the shewbread that we feast on and drive
[58:31] across the country for see what was it
[58:34] it was stored up meal stored up food for
[58:36] in due season actually for this time
[58:39] every time you listen within the tapes
[58:41] he said that was the Shubert they were
[58:43] the what the twelve rows represented
[58:46] what the twelve mysteries absolutely
[58:49] absolutely and they were driving across
[58:51] the country for hundreds of miles see
[58:54] it's believers food and just to run the
[58:56] other here as far as I can see but she
[58:58] drives three hours when she gets here

[59:06] the shoe grin was for the believer only
[59:08] see Schubert seed notice what it does do
[59:11] he said that she kind of glory over the
[59:13] Schubert kept it from spoiling see so as
[59:17] long as your pastor stays in the
[59:20] presence of the Holy Ghost and stays
[59:23] what in prayer and fasting and
[59:25] supplications and consecrates himself
[59:28] from the Word of God that Holy Ghost
[59:29] cannot dwell and he can now keep this
[59:32] Word of God you'll keep with you and be
[59:34] able to give you unspoiled bread

[1:01:57] to work and so my couch and that all is
[1:02:01] that is that I mean that's compared to
[1:02:03] run that back to the scriptures as they
[1:02:06] were addicted to the Ministry of Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ and they search daily what are
[1:02:11] these things we saw a man go back to the
[1:02:13] book of Acts and see how those original
[1:02:15] Saints acted a man praise God a man a
[1:02:18] sister darkus nor there was the most
[1:02:21] knitting things and making clothes for
[1:02:22] those people and all these
[1:02:23] and once she passed it was become a
[1:02:25] remembrance of God read through what is
[1:02:29] the mystery of his will
[1:02:30] why is this so important why is this
[1:02:33] last one so important we've heard this
[1:02:39] some thousand times ten thousand times
[1:02:42] he says now remember this Christ is in
[1:02:45] the true church is the continuation of
[1:02:47] the Book of Revelations the book of John
[1:02:50] the the lion book the book of Matthew no
[1:02:54] he said that the book of Acts he says
[1:02:58] but the book of Revelation shows how
[1:03:00] that the Antichrist spirit would come
[1:03:02] into the church to file it making it
[1:03:04] Luke Ward for empower us it exposes
[1:03:06] sainted revealing his works attempted
[1:03:09] destruction of God's people and the
[1:03:11] describing of God's Word right down to
[1:03:13] the tiniest cast like a fire
[1:03:14] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:03:17] knows that a people get the true
[1:03:19] revelation of the true church the
[1:03:23] revelation of the true church what is
[1:03:26] the true church we get dressed up come
[1:03:29] to church on Sunday pull in the parking
[1:03:32] lot walk in sit down brother gets up
[1:03:36] there laid songs praise be to God we
[1:03:37] just love you so much Lord you're so
[1:03:39] worthy we sing we sing the pastor the
[1:03:41] preacher gets up there he starts
[1:03:42] preaching the Word of God we pull on the
[1:03:44] Word of God and we do these things right
[1:03:46] and then the song later gets back up
[1:03:48] there he sees lead songs we say praise
[1:03:50] the Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord
[1:03:51] Jesus we love you and then we go home is
[1:03:55] that the true revelation of the true
[1:03:57] church I thought we were supposed to
[1:04:03] have power and demonstration y'ever
[1:04:08] never everything about the two
[1:04:10] ministries the book of Acts what were
[1:04:12] the two ministries the book of Acts st.
[1:04:17] Paul who wrote the majority who God
[1:04:19] anointed he said I come in the power and
[1:04:24] demonstration of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:04:29] Prophet broke it down he said there was
[1:04:30] another one running who was a Paulus but
[1:04:33] nothing was not one sermon or letter of
[1:04:35] apology
[1:04:36] he was a mighty in the Word of God he
[1:04:39] could preach the Word of God like no
[1:04:41] other tie scripture dovetail I'm sure
[1:04:43] like a champion listen ed but he was not
[1:04:45] what we called the book of Acts standard
[1:04:49] he would preach masterpiece after
[1:04:51] masterpiece after masterpiece he was
[1:04:53] such a good minister with the Word of
[1:04:54] God that the people started exhausting
[1:04:57] next to Paul and Paul says I come with
[1:04:58] power and demonstration interesting he
[1:05:09] knows of the people get the true
[1:05:11] revelation of the true church and what
[1:05:13] she is what she stands for that that she
[1:05:16] can do the greater works and she will be
[1:05:18] an invincible army this is the will of
[1:05:22] God for your life how do we do it I
[1:05:28] don't know but we have to get in our
[1:05:33] prayer closet what brother will say when
[1:05:35] I sing that song he says you must pray
[1:05:37] for revelation more than anything we
[1:05:43] must to get in the closet
[1:05:45] and come until he comes down and you
[1:05:48] start crying out for the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:50] then he starts to spend what we start
[1:05:52] getting in communion and as we speak to
[1:05:56] him in our prayer closets Lord Lord Lord
[1:05:58] Lord we must then take a break be quiet
[1:06:04] and see if he'll answer back and the
[1:06:09] Bible says he will the Bible says he
[1:06:11] says those that seek me early he says
[1:06:14] those the ones I love let's get into
[1:06:19] that prayer closet what was that tent
[1:06:22] vision it was the prayer closet the
[1:06:25] Bible says the bride cometh out of the
[1:06:27] closet why should she come out because
[1:06:30] she was in there she was gonna die and
[1:06:34] absolutely was wrong with her husband he
[1:06:36] was revealing the various things and
[1:06:38] then when he called she come notice how
[1:06:45] the world has perverted cause of
[1:06:47] homosexuality perverted it
[1:06:50] and they take the most precious thing
[1:06:53] opportunity promise given to a believers
[1:06:56] to enter into the prayer closet find God
[1:06:58] and the world perverts it to the most
[1:07:00] despicable abomination
[1:07:03] there was the Ark of Titus we taught on
[1:07:11] this on the the the forfeiting the seven
[1:07:13] church ages
[1:07:15] Titus comes down surrounds Jerusalem and
[1:07:19] notice what they carry out the Jews
[1:07:22] forfeited the seven golden candlesticks
[1:07:25] church age but is that all they
[1:07:29] forfeited according to this picture we
[1:07:33] see the seventh - two silver trumpets
[1:07:36] right there
[1:07:38] those represent Redemption salvation for
[1:07:42] the Jews the two the two prophets coming
[1:07:44] to Israel is that it absolutely not
[1:07:52] there is your table of shewbread right
[1:07:56] there the table notice Rome now has
[1:08:01] control or rules what was the vision
[1:08:03] what was the image that David dare or
[1:08:06] I'm sorry that Daniel saw it was that
[1:08:08] image with the golden head the the
[1:08:10] silver this the brass and then what has
[1:08:13] it end up are we still a image still
[1:08:15] standing
[1:08:16] absolutely it's iron now iron mixed with
[1:08:20] clay which is what Romanism who took
[1:08:23] this this is the Ark of Titus in Rome
[1:08:27] she's been ruling in the church ages
[1:08:29] she's trying to stop this she's taking
[1:08:32] what the table of shewbread which which
[1:08:34] on it contains what the 12 pieces of
[1:08:38] shewbread the 12 mysteries of the Word
[1:08:40] of God they've been in control of that
[1:08:44] until this day but the Bible said I will
[1:08:50] restore say it's a little amen that's
[1:08:53] right Jesus Christ has already come back
[1:08:56] and restored it the high priest himself
[1:08:59] had to come back and make up that bread
[1:09:02] what's more
[1:09:03] let me tell you bro I got this don't
[1:09:05] worry about this boom boom boom boom
[1:09:07] boom boom boom well right there and for
[1:09:10] the last 50 years people have traveled
[1:09:12] hundreds and hundreds of miles every
[1:09:14] service what to catch this shewbread
[1:09:16] once again amen we proved that
[1:09:20] absolutely absolutely
[1:09:23] revelation 17 when upon her forehead was
[1:09:26] a name written Mystery Babylon the Great
[1:09:27] the mother of harlots abomination of the
[1:09:29] earth and I saw a woman drunken with the
[1:09:31] blood of the Saints and with the blood
[1:09:32] of martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I
[1:09:34] wondered with great admiration and the
[1:09:36] angel said to me where pieces wherefore
[1:09:39] did thou marvel why are you so surprised
[1:09:42] why is this such a mind blow to you he
[1:09:44] says I will tell thee the mystery woman
[1:09:46] the Beast that carry the rod which he
[1:09:47] hath seven heads and ten horns how did
[1:09:51] this woman get like this how did she
[1:09:54] become like this what was true remember
[1:09:58] the brother Graham talked about he's is
[1:09:59] from that time and how he met that bum
[1:10:02] on the street and he said he look up
[1:10:03] there that he had that building he's
[1:10:05] nice to be president of that Bank right
[1:10:06] there it all started with one little
[1:10:08] white lie and then this and they
[1:10:10] compiled a compound and tweak became a
[1:10:12] bomb a president of the bank became how
[1:10:16] did it start and John says how did she
[1:10:18] get to this position drunken with the
[1:10:20] blood of the saints what was her
[1:10:24] original sin and another parable he says
[1:10:30] spake unto them the kingdom of heaven is
[1:10:32] like unto leaven which a woman took
[1:10:35] leaven is what sin right
[1:10:38] it's unbelief it's leprosy which a woman
[1:10:43] took and hid in three measures of meal
[1:10:45] till the whole was leavened right we've
[1:10:49] heard this before he says well this is
[1:10:52] that woman right there this is the
[1:10:54] Catholic Church right there so now
[1:10:58] notice it says and she hid that word
[1:11:03] HIDs me to conceal or to incorporate
[1:11:06] rate with to hide in to conceal to hide
[1:11:09] to keep secret notice what did that
[1:11:13] woman go for she went for the meal she
[1:11:16] did
[1:11:17] not go for bread she had the meal the
[1:11:23] meal that was not mixed with water the
[1:11:27] meal that was not mixed with oil
[1:11:30] she went for just the meal she did not
[1:11:40] go for bread she went for the meal yes
[1:11:45] brahim has that dream that man beating
[1:11:48] down that woman beating her down beating
[1:11:51] her down right the three right I woke up
[1:11:55] and me to have to dream and I thought
[1:11:56] how strange that I was I wondered why I
[1:11:58] dreamed about the woman when suddenly
[1:12:00] there came and the presence of God
[1:12:01] became known to me in the perturbation
[1:12:04] of the dream came from him now to you
[1:12:06] now you people know that not only I
[1:12:08] interpreted dreams exactly he says but I
[1:12:10] have many many times told you what you
[1:12:12] dreamed so that you could never tell me
[1:12:13] the woman represents the Church of the
[1:12:15] world today it says she represents the
[1:12:19] Church of the world today doesn't even
[1:12:21] say really the Catholic Church it just
[1:12:23] says the church in general as a whole I
[1:12:26] was born right into this mess the mess
[1:12:29] that she is in she was supposed to be a
[1:12:32] kind of mother she's the mother of
[1:12:33] harlots oh my maybe this she says her
[1:12:35] husband is the denomination's that rule
[1:12:37] her the three-quarter block is the false
[1:12:40] trying to baptism unto a trinity see saw
[1:12:44] her first mistake her first sin was what
[1:12:47] she switched the true baptism and she
[1:12:50] put what false doctrine into the Godhead
[1:12:54] absolutely Satan had to what break the
[1:12:57] Ten Commandments he says I've got to get
[1:12:59] him to worship somebody else and Satan
[1:13:02] the mastermind says let me go back to
[1:13:04] Matthew in 19 he said look father son
[1:13:06] Holy Ghost and he incorporated what a
[1:13:09] person a person a person and they're not
[1:13:13] equal and now what she has contaminated
[1:13:15] everything and she deals not the bread
[1:13:18] just that meal doctrine just the meal
[1:13:23] remember why will this meal people
[1:13:29] are believing Trinity dr. baptism now
[1:13:34] think on this naturally how do you make
[1:13:36] bread like we said before meal water oil
[1:13:39] mix it and now we have dough then you
[1:13:42] bake it right the Bible says in
[1:13:47] Revelation 6 6 touch not the oil and
[1:13:52] wine satan head cannot touch the oil in
[1:13:56] wine but it never said he could not
[1:13:58] touch the meal so she was allowed to
[1:14:05] take the Word of God and pervert it now
[1:14:09] why sister we believe in three gods
[1:14:14] three persons Trinity and if you accept
[1:14:18] that into your heart and you start
[1:14:21] getting into the presence of God and you
[1:14:23] get baptized I give you false meal you
[1:14:27] mix that false meal in your heart in
[1:14:28] your mind with water and then the whole
[1:14:32] use you actually are serious about this
[1:14:34] and you try and get into the presence of
[1:14:36] God and the Holy Ghost comes down and
[1:14:39] you have dough but when the temptation
[1:14:44] comes it'll produce eleven bread every
[1:14:49] time that leavened bread is not the same
[1:14:54] as the original and Paul said he says
[1:14:59] they'll turn the people make them
[1:15:00] twofold the sons of hell yes that's why
[1:15:05] we must be a word bride if we keep our
[1:15:13] ears pure and be able to discern good
[1:15:17] and evil from the pulpit fault keep any
[1:15:21] false doctrine yes if you're able to
[1:15:27] discern false true and false doctrine
[1:15:30] and you get baptized the right way and
[1:15:34] you get the bathroo the Holy Ghost God
[1:15:37] will produce the exact same bread he was
[1:15:40] with you
[1:15:43] profit continuous said he says she will
[1:15:46] be a word
[1:15:48] not a bread bride a word because the
[1:15:52] most important thing she can do is keep
[1:15:54] that word that that meal that stuff pure
[1:15:57] because what he'll do the rest no just
[1:16:05] give me a baptize in your precious name
[1:16:07] the name of Jesus Christ another feeling
[1:16:09] with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:10] normal Oh make sure give me the strength
[1:16:13] to keep that meal clean hey man
[1:16:19] simple but that's how we have to
[1:16:22] understand it you have to understand
[1:16:24] what kind of battle we're in right there
[1:16:29] it is this is not bread but just meal it
[1:16:33] is not mixed with oil it was not even
[1:16:36] baked the meal contains the leaven not
[1:16:40] the oil not the water but notice it says
[1:16:47] look at the price of this and I heard a
[1:16:50] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[1:16:51] say a measure of wheat for a penny and
[1:16:53] three measures of barley for a penny
[1:16:54] hurt that will not the oil and wine look
[1:16:57] at the look at that price it's
[1:16:58] overpriced in order to capture the
[1:17:01] wealth of the world a measure of wheat
[1:17:04] for a penny and three barrels three
[1:17:06] measures of barley for a penny in Roman
[1:17:08] times our day's wage would buy eight
[1:17:10] quarts of wheat or twenty four quarts of
[1:17:13] barley
[1:17:14] look how overpriced this was four days
[1:17:17] wage for contaminated meal its GMO if

[1:17:27] these days this does contain generally
[1:17:31] modified material here we are the same
[1:17:36] thing they've been doing all the way and
[1:17:38] now it's already manifested in the
[1:17:40] natural absolutely I know it's simple he
[1:17:45] says imagine bread costing sixteen to
[1:17:47] twenty dollars for a loaf that's exactly
[1:17:49] what they're charging
[1:17:50] let's say you have seven children
[1:17:52] brother Jesse
[1:17:54] whoo overtime summer school I'm signing
[1:18:00] up oh no the Lord will provide yes yes

[1:18:32] the a hab the Lord God of Israel liveth
[1:18:35] whom I stand and shall not be nor do no
[1:18:37] rain these years of Co but according to
[1:18:39] my word correct there's a drought coming
[1:18:45] a dry time and then he says what he says
[1:18:49] that came to pass while at the brook
[1:18:50] dried up because there was been no rain
[1:18:52] in the land correct now look what he
[1:18:55] says he says in the word Lord Kingdom
[1:18:56] saying arise get me to Zarabeth which
[1:18:59] belongs to Zions while there behold I
[1:19:01] have commanded a widow woman to sustain
[1:19:03] thee notice the Catholic Church was one
[1:19:06] woman but God now sends his main prophet
[1:19:10] man with power to open heavens and shut
[1:19:14] heavens and send her to one woman a
[1:19:17] widow woman he says I've commanded a
[1:19:22] widow woman to sustain you sustain you
[1:19:25] sustain thee right and then look at
[1:19:28] Malachi 4:5 and behold I send you Elijah

[1:19:35] identify absolutely but notice the woman

[1:19:46] prophet to would his woman place what a
[1:19:47] place but she must have been a real
[1:19:50] virtuous woman for God to send his
[1:19:55] property what does that say about you

[1:25:26] first come in the message I studied this
[1:25:29] Bible I heard the Bible I read this
[1:25:31] Bible and I just got into my married to
[1:25:34] my wife we got married

[1:26:13] keep going this I was taking every side
[1:26:15] job possible Lord what am I gonna do and
[1:26:20] we sat down on the couch and my wife had
[1:26:22] fallen asleep and I sit there by myself
[1:26:25] I took my Bible and I was in such a
[1:26:30] desperation and I don't recommend this I
[1:26:33] do not recommend this I do not ever
[1:26:38] don't do this unless you
[1:26:39] or in their stock I took my Bible I said
[1:26:45] no I need something and I've never done
[1:26:49] this sense before after I doing that
[1:26:51] that's crazy
[1:26:52] but that day I was in that spot I closed
[1:26:56] that Bible I see my wife laying there
[1:26:59] knowing the bills are coming I'm just
[1:27:02] one tiny five foot three one hundred and
[1:27:04] thirty five hundred forty five pounds

[1:27:18] was gonna hit but when I opened my eyes
[1:27:21] Saints for thus saith the Lord God of
[1:27:25] Israel the barrel of meal shall not
[1:27:28] waste neither shall the cruse of oil
[1:27:31] fail until the day that the Lord sent us
[1:27:34] the rain upon the earth the Bible says
[1:27:41] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:27:43] ordered don't do this so I'm just giving
[1:27:47] you this is a testimony I had nothing to
[1:27:50] do with this God guided all 10 of my
[1:27:53] little fingers and any guy he closed my
[1:27:54] eyes and he used my saints of God we
[1:27:58] have nothing to worry about

[1:28:17] the temptation shall come as follows
[1:28:21] we're gonna be bread alright we're gonna
[1:28:24] be bread baked down hope I'm not you're
[1:28:28] taking too long just a little bit longer
[1:28:29] by the grace of God Genesis 18 1 and the
[1:28:32] Lord appeared to him the plains of Mamre
[1:28:34] and he sat in the tent in the door of
[1:28:36] the heat of the day and he lifted his
[1:28:37] eyes and looked three men stood by him
[1:28:39] and he when he saw them he ran to meet
[1:28:42] them from the tent door and bowed
[1:28:43] himself toward the ground right he says
[1:28:46] and said my lord mouth off on favor my
[1:28:48] sight pass not away I pray thee for my
[1:28:50] servant he says let a little water I
[1:28:52] pray

[1:28:55] yourselves God came to Abraham amen
[1:28:58] praise God and I just got a little but
[1:29:00] you angel they met and these were let
[1:29:02] the messengers
[1:29:03] he said the prophet said this is our day
[1:29:07] as it was the day of Noah as it was in
[1:29:11] the day of lot but the main man was
[1:29:13] Abraham when he says Evans days a lot he
[1:29:17] was pointing to the world remember
[1:29:20] Abraham was outside of that he was
[1:29:23] outside that with dwelling with God look
[1:29:27] now he says and I will fetch thee a
[1:29:30] morsel bread and cover ye your hearts
[1:29:32] after that you shall pass on he says for
[1:29:35] therefore you shall come here sermon
[1:29:37] said so-and-so do and thou has said
[1:29:39] right he's gonna do what you do he said
[1:29:40] and Abram hastened into the tent on the
[1:29:42] Sarah and now look what the man says to
[1:29:45] his wife make ready quickly three
[1:29:48] measures of fine meal and needed and
[1:29:52] make me cakes on the hearth Abraham did
[1:29:58] we have a br aham
[1:30:00] pranam and he had a taking care of a
[1:30:06] wife of a man as well he said Sarah
[1:30:11] princess princess he says make me three
[1:30:19] cakes with fine flour right that meal
[1:30:25] all that woman had to do was keep that
[1:30:31] meal pure make sure she got baptized
[1:30:35] right and she got the Holy Ghost down
[1:30:37] but was that it that just produced the
[1:30:40] dough again but God is not coming back
[1:30:45] for dough he's coming back for bread
[1:30:48] amen she held the head of far as well
[1:30:52] amen a Pentecostal time right there the
[1:30:55] licks of fire come now produced the book
[1:30:56] of Acts one more time amen
[1:30:59] we must be baked a man he must break
[1:31:03] everything out of us all the lemon
[1:31:06] remember when he baked the earth when
[1:31:09] guy comes out in birds the earth what
[1:31:11] he's burning all the sin out of it which
[1:31:14] is a type of the Holy Ghost we need
[1:31:18] three fillings of the Holy Ghost to burn
[1:31:22] it out and stay right there until it's
[1:31:23] all gone a man need it and make cakes
[1:31:29] upon your see she had to bake it and
[1:31:31] then what then the Sun I can pull took
[1:31:35] place see if we keep the Word of God he
[1:31:40] says what great things will happen
[1:31:42] supernatural starts striking the church
[1:31:44] but we must keep the word and get into
[1:31:48] where he wants us to be back into
[1:31:50] communion with Jesus Christ all right so
[1:31:54] look longer
[1:31:55] 1st Peter 1:7 the trial of your faith
[1:31:58] being much more precious than that of
[1:32:00] gold that perishes don't be tried with
[1:32:02] fire might be found in the praise and
[1:32:04] honor and the glory at the at the
[1:32:06] appearing of Jesus Christ amen he says I
[1:32:09] counseling to buy of me gold tried in
[1:32:11] the fire was not man's be rich and white
[1:32:13] raiment did not manage me closed into
[1:32:15] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[1:32:16] and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that
[1:32:19] thou mayst see all right
[1:32:23] why all these trials everything about
[1:32:26] that why are all these trials we break
[1:32:28] this down real quick how many trials you
[1:32:30] got your life sister a lot mine battles
[1:32:32] constantly constant mine battles it my
[1:32:35] brother my fourth first mine Judas and
[1:32:37] my Judas am I gonna turn on you am I am
[1:32:43] I gonna sell you out am I gonna betray
[1:32:45] someone why all these trials what is the
[1:32:52] manifestation sons of God the
[1:32:54] manifestation of the sons of God is when
[1:32:57] all power and authority in heaven is now
[1:33:04] placed on a people and they have to wait
[1:33:09] for his orders to display this power do
[1:33:17] we understand what
[1:33:18] is at that time it'll be back to the
[1:33:22] spoken word of God you don't have to do
[1:33:26] a thing all you'll have to do is wait
[1:33:28] for the leading of Lord speak it'll take
[1:33:31] place all that power
[1:33:34] he's restoring us back to Eden right now
[1:33:39] why are the trials because trials are
[1:33:42] for learning train up your children in
[1:33:45] the Lord right why did Jesus Christ
[1:33:52] about us that Jesus Christ had to suffer
[1:33:55] so we could learn obedience are you
[1:34:01] telling me God the Father made his son a
[1:34:08] perfect man sinless suffer and he didn't
[1:34:14] make the first Adam why why the first
[1:34:24] Adam never went through one trial never
[1:34:28] got sick one time never had this issue
[1:34:33] never had a mind battle and he was given
[1:34:37] all the power all the earth to control
[1:34:40] nature to do whatever he wanted to do
[1:34:45] but he didn't know what he had and he
[1:34:49] fell he did not know what he had he was
[1:34:55] never tried as a son that's why he chose
[1:34:59] to fall power without character is
[1:35:06] satanic bring the towel okay that's kind
[1:35:18] I like over your Bible you know what I
[1:35:21] mean that's why you're go through
[1:35:22] everything because when you are bait and
[1:35:26] you've been tried that power will be
[1:35:31] given
[1:35:32] but you must be tested first to see what
[1:35:36] kind of person you're gonna be will you
[1:35:39] keep that meal pure job six 21.9 return
[1:35:46] I pray you let it not be iniquity a
[1:35:48] return again my righteousness is their
[1:35:49] iniquity in my tongue he says cannot my
[1:35:52] taste discern between perverse things
[1:35:54] when a preacher gets back here he says
[1:35:56] preaching are they preaching so fast and
[1:35:59] you're getting into the anointing of it
[1:36:02] and trying to get his service that you
[1:36:03] don't even know what they're really
[1:36:04] saying could that be a trick of the
[1:36:08] devil I've been in services like that
[1:36:10] they'll preach and a preaching so fast
[1:36:13] so fast you can't keep up but then
[1:36:14] something will say wow that was off and
[1:36:16] then I pulled then I pulled back from
[1:36:18] the service while the people are
[1:36:20] chomping is telling this and this and
[1:36:21] I'm thinking how do I teach this soft
[1:36:25] the word and we put our faith in our
[1:36:28] pastor we believe he's a man of God
[1:36:30] after we let it let those things down
[1:36:33] for a little bit and pull on the word
[1:36:35] get into the spirit because the Bible
[1:36:38] says we should be he says doth not my
[1:36:41] ears try Ward seizes and my mouth taste
[1:36:44] his meat the bread is this leavened
[1:36:46] bread or is this unleavened bread we
[1:36:49] should be able to taste the difference
[1:36:50] by now hey man we call it the taste test
[1:36:55] absolutely he says for the ear try out
[1:36:58] the words as the mouth taste us meet a
[1:37:01] man let me speed up here by the grace of
[1:37:03] God let's hit that one right right there
[1:37:05] he said but he that a spiritual judgeth
[1:37:07] all things yet he himself is judged of
[1:37:09] no man of all no man right let's speed
[1:37:12] up here by the grace of God I'm hold you
[1:37:16] and held you long kind of want to get to
[1:37:18] where I'm going okay
[1:37:24] Elijah's ministry I just had to throw a
[1:37:27] meal into the pot to make it work but it
[1:37:29] was pure meal now we're back to this
[1:37:32] scripture here and Luke Leviticus 20 23
[1:37:34] 15 dealing with the seventh Sabbath's
[1:37:38] and then you have your two wave flows
[1:37:40] right notice there was two correct
[1:37:45] he said now here the Prophet says he
[1:37:48] says now notice here quickly revelations
[1:37:50] 9 under 7 the seventh trumpet their King
[1:37:52] is from the bonds but then in Leviticus
[1:37:54] now how perfect interpretation with the
[1:37:56] word because see immediately following
[1:37:58] the Pentecostal Jubilee followed by the
[1:38:01] day of an atonement that the order of
[1:38:03] the feast time between the Pentecostal
[1:38:05] feast to the torment the sounds of
[1:38:07] trumpets for the atonement it was to be
[1:38:09] in the Pentecostal feast the long period
[1:38:11] of time here there's a long period of
[1:38:13] time between the Pentecostal feast and
[1:38:14] that trumpet right so he's going with
[1:38:16] the he's tying these things together the
[1:38:18] Pentecostal feast the seven Sabbath's
[1:38:19] that's what the church ages now let's
[1:38:22] continue on here cuz I don't want to
[1:38:23] confuse he says and the seven Sabbath's
[1:38:25] is the church ages cherish eight years
[1:38:27] he says the seven church years the
[1:38:29] church ages get it see now the Jews have
[1:38:32] been blinding all this time while the
[1:38:34] Pentecostal firstfruits have been poured
[1:38:36] out upon the church right so he's now as
[1:38:39] he said those seven Sabbath's are the
[1:38:40] church age is correct now I don't see
[1:38:44] how I'm gonna go here
[1:38:45] he said now at the end of these seven
[1:38:47] Sabbath's which have been there was to
[1:38:49] be the day of atonement the day of
[1:38:54] atonement at the end these seven
[1:38:56] Sabbath's seven church ages there's an
[1:38:59] extra day there 49 days but number 50 is
[1:39:02] Jubilee
[1:39:04] there's that extra day he says and there
[1:39:08] was the day of atonement which was the
[1:39:10] seven trumpets and the some charms was
[1:39:12] called the day of mourning back to the
[1:39:13] sacrifice of atonement and we find out
[1:39:15] there Israel the seven trumpets pertain
[1:39:16] only to Israel correct okay let's go
[1:39:19] here now look what now look what the
[1:39:24] Prophet says thank God for prophet but
[1:39:27] perfection has come to the place that
[1:39:30] the middle person now if there happens
[1:39:32] to be a Jews here Jew here or somebody
[1:39:34] that understands the Old Testament prove
[1:39:36] it
[1:39:37] let me show you I haven't got the Old
[1:39:38] Testament with me right now this is the
[1:39:40] New Testament in the offering of the
[1:39:42] shewbread that was laying on the kosher
[1:39:45] plate in the Jewish sacrifice at the
[1:39:47] cleansing of the tabernacle he says ask
[1:39:50] any Jew he says all those three pieces
[1:39:57] bread but we read in the scripture said
[1:40:00] there was only two but the Prophet says
[1:40:04] there was three the middle piece was
[1:40:09] broken he says that was Christ the
[1:40:12] middle piece was broken Christ and in
[1:40:14] between showed that there was a there
[1:40:17] had to be a breaking somewhere for
[1:40:18] redemption and that piece was considered
[1:40:21] Redemption on the kosher plate but the
[1:40:24] scripture only says there was - I want
[1:40:28] to ask you something especially Jews on
[1:40:30] the kosher bread at Yom Kippur
[1:40:31] but then they have atonement he says the
[1:40:34] scripture only gives to record gives
[1:40:36] record of two pieces of bread but you
[1:40:38] know it has it has three and the middle
[1:40:42] piece is the broken piece the Messiah
[1:40:44] why did they not recognize the Messiah
[1:40:49] because it was only for the priests to
[1:40:51] understand it was a mystery he says what
[1:40:54] was it told that Jesus he says it was
[1:40:56] the Messiah what was it that told y'all
[1:40:59] where to be buried he says not a
[1:41:03] scripture wrote about it he's dealing
[1:41:07] now with the unwritten Word of God
[1:41:11] Leviticus 23 it says - but the prophet
[1:41:14] says he says by the gift he said there
[1:41:16] was actually three and the middle one he
[1:41:20] says was broken hiding what the
[1:41:22] sacrifice of Christ if this was no they
[1:41:25] would have never crucified Christ
[1:41:29] if Satan would have understand it but in
[1:41:32] the Unruh - why did why did the Old
[1:41:34] Testament Saints get buried in the
[1:41:36] promised land what scripture proves it
[1:41:38] one scripture told able to slay a lamb
[1:41:42] instead of fruits
[1:41:43] it was the unwritten word God it was
[1:41:51] unwritten catch it
[1:41:56] oma but wasn't the told Abraham to buy a
[1:42:00] piece of ground where job job when the
[1:42:02] spirit came home I know my redeemer
[1:42:03] liveth that last easy to come upon the
[1:42:05] earth though my skin worms destroy this
[1:42:06] body and my flesh he was the first this
[1:42:09] was a court according
[1:42:10] history this was the first book written
[1:42:12] down with Jobe he did not help Moses law
[1:42:16] did not under he did not have Genesis he
[1:42:18] was not reading from Genesis and
[1:42:19] Deuteronomy let me get to the dolly
[1:42:21] saying it just came by a fresh
[1:42:24] revelation the prophet said it would
[1:42:28] this end time would be a spiritual
[1:42:32] revelation not to he said he said not to
[1:42:37] gross
[1:42:37] to individuals it's the unwritten Word
[1:42:47] now let me let me break this down real
[1:42:48] quick let me showing you how this is
[1:42:49] gonna work right back right back to
[1:42:53] where that woman was that planted this
[1:42:55] Lebanon right go ye therefore and teach
[1:42:59] all nations baptizing them in the name
[1:43:01] of the Father Son and Holy Ghost so I
[1:43:06] guess that's good enough
[1:43:09] let's get rebaptised know where is the
[1:43:16] name of Jesus in this it was the
[1:43:20] unwritten word he said it was the
[1:43:25] unwritten word when they Jesus got
[1:43:28] baptized it was unto him he just washed
[1:43:30] him right when John the Baptist was
[1:43:32] baptizing is it was unto the one that
[1:43:34] was coming for repentance right but
[1:43:37] there was no name given there was no
[1:43:40] name given for that baptism and as now
[1:43:44] Jesus comes in becomes a big bread and
[1:43:45] he starts his ministry he says he gives
[1:43:49] his disciples go two-by-two he sent me
[1:43:51] says in my name cast out devils so he
[1:43:53] was training them that that name had
[1:43:55] power but he never said anything about
[1:44:00] that name bringing it with the baptism
[1:44:01] the power of that name with the baptism
[1:44:05] he left it out but when then now he
[1:44:07] gives the the the the recipe for baptism
[1:44:11] he leaves it a mystery an unwritten
[1:44:14] name but if you understand it was
[1:44:18] already there
[1:44:21] they already knew it they just didn't
[1:44:23] understand until the Holy Ghost came and
[1:44:29] gave their interpretation
[1:44:32] he said Sawa has been missing
[1:44:34] misinterpreted today and say in the name
[1:44:35] of the father and the name of the son
[1:44:37] named the Holy Ghost he says it's not
[1:44:39] even a written in the scripture and to
[1:44:41] the book of Acts it's in the name of the
[1:44:44] singular fathers I stumbled upon stat
[1:44:47] I'm like oh my goodness
[1:44:48] it was unwritten until Pentecost on what
[1:44:53] that name was but notice now look what
[1:44:58] goodness we're getting here look at the
[1:45:00] days of Abraham he was first Abram and
[1:45:02] never could have a baby until his name
[1:45:04] was changed Abraham and Sarah or Sarah
[1:45:07] Sarah could not have nothing but a dead
[1:45:09] woman - her name was changed to Sarah
[1:45:11] Jacob meets the planner deceiver and
[1:45:13] that's why he did he put the sheepskin
[1:45:14] on himself and deceived his prophet
[1:45:16] father take a bride's birthright he put
[1:45:18] poplar sticks and while her speculums
[1:45:20] say scared the cattle when they were
[1:45:22] pregnant with their young and speckled
[1:45:24] sheep nothing but a deceiver
[1:45:26] he says until one day he says he became
[1:45:27] Israel meaning a prince with power a
[1:45:30] prince with power before God is that
[1:45:32] right every overcomer Simon was a
[1:45:34] fisherman when his faith caught and note
[1:45:36] he was Jesus he said and told me his
[1:45:38] Messiah told him that who his name was
[1:45:40] he says he changed his name from Simon
[1:45:42] to Peter notice all these name changes
[1:45:44] right name changes the revealing of the
[1:45:46] name whoa what what in the Peter's name
[1:45:49] was unwritten it was sorry
[1:45:51] Simon's Peter something written is
[1:45:52] actually what Peter right Saul had a
[1:45:55] good name Saul was a king in one time
[1:45:57] Israel but Saul didn't fit the Apostle
[1:45:59] he says it might I'll be all right for a
[1:46:01] king but now for an apostle so JA so
[1:46:03] Jesus changed his name from what from
[1:46:05] Saul to Paul and then he changes Peter
[1:46:08] James and John's name to the sons of
[1:46:12] thunder three name changes at one time
[1:46:14] Simon you'll be called Peter and you two
[1:46:18] boys brothers sons of thunder name
[1:46:22] changes right revelations 2:17 he
[1:46:31] and ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:46:33] saith churches to him that overcometh
[1:46:35] will I give to eat of the hidden manna
[1:46:41] remember them twelve law was shoe bread
[1:46:43] that was in the holy place but if we
[1:46:47] continue and get into the presence of
[1:46:49] God behind that curtain
[1:46:51] now we're curtains ripped though but if
[1:46:53] we get into the presence of God in that
[1:46:55] Ark of the Covenant is hidden manna not
[1:46:59] not all the message here is these twelve
[1:47:02] mysteries ringing it's preached every
[1:47:04] Sunday every Wednesday mysteries
[1:47:06] mysteries mysteries but there is hidden
[1:47:09] manna for the bride and will give him a
[1:47:15] white stone and in the white stone a new
[1:47:17] name written which no man knoweth saving
[1:47:20] he that receiveth it him that overcometh
[1:47:24] will i make a pillar in the temple of my
[1:47:25] god he shall go no more out you know
[1:47:28] write upon him the name of my god in the
[1:47:31] name of the city of my god which is New
[1:47:33] Jerusalem which cometh down from heaven
[1:47:34] my god and I will write upon him my new
[1:47:36] name why did I go through this entire
[1:47:39] study I was trying to show in Leviticus
[1:47:46] they had the two wave loaves but as we
[1:47:49] see through scripture there was always
[1:47:50] three three cakes three cakes three
[1:47:54] cakes baked saints of God there's
[1:48:00] something coming Jesus his name on earth
[1:48:03] was Redeemer Jesus when he was on earth
[1:48:05] he was Redeemer that's true but when he
[1:48:07] conquered death in the hell and overcame
[1:48:10] them and ascended on high he received a
[1:48:13] new name the seven seals have been
[1:48:19] opened there was one Thunder seven seals
[1:48:25] open over off one thunder right
[1:48:27] and as that mighty angel he's taking now
[1:48:30] this open book that the seven seals one
[1:48:33] Thunder had opened Christ himself the
[1:48:35] bloody lamb and he's taking this open
[1:48:39] book and he comes down to earth and land
[1:48:42] and sea raises his hand
[1:48:45] and seven more thunders uttered their
[1:48:49] voices not the same thunder back there
[1:48:52] seven more thunders and john heard it he
[1:48:59] heard it and he took it to the grave why
[1:49:03] because he was the seed form and if he
[1:49:07] was the if a seed form was able to catch
[1:49:10] these seven thunders and it was planted
[1:49:13] and buried there had to be more come up
[1:49:15] at the end of these ages that would be
[1:49:18] able to catch these thunders and God
[1:49:20] told John he says seal him up don't
[1:49:25] reveal him has it been opened it's open
[1:49:28] but has it been revealed but when he had
[1:49:33] conquered death and held overcome and
[1:49:35] sending the high he received a new name
[1:49:37] how come we're not seeing the true
[1:49:39] church in action yet
[1:49:40] I thought the seven seals or the seven
[1:49:43] thunders would wake up the bride is she
[1:49:44] awake is this bride awake is the is the
[1:49:48] divine love of the Holy Ghost alive
[1:49:51] around this message I'm talking real
[1:49:56] love where all these everybody is on the
[1:50:00] same plane all treated the same and you
[1:50:04] can feel the presence of God all the
[1:50:06] time sign was their miracles the Angel
[1:50:09] visitations but when he conquered death
[1:50:11] hell and how overcame and sent on high
[1:50:13] he received a new name that's the reason
[1:50:15] they'll holler and do what they want he
[1:50:17] says he says but it'll be revealed in
[1:50:19] the thunders see had the new name of God
[1:50:22] been revealed yet both side that's an
[1:50:25] isolated quote I know absolutely but God
[1:50:32] said I'll give you a new name there's a
[1:50:35] lot of scriptures with this out of
[1:50:37] quotes my pastor is going right over the
[1:50:38] seven seals and the seven thunders right
[1:50:39] now and this thing's opening up to to us
[1:50:43] by the grace of God but it's to him or
[1:50:47] her that overcometh Jesus Christ
[1:50:51] overcame in that desert well Stan the
[1:50:57] only way we'll catch
[1:50:58] this unwritten word Saints a man went
[1:51:03] and talked to the Prophet said and the
[1:51:04] problems talking about the seven
[1:51:05] thunders he says all he stole a brother
[1:51:07] branham he says he says I'm sure you're
[1:51:09] gonna catch this and you're gonna bring
[1:51:10] it to the people in this net he's it'll
[1:51:12] probably be probably probably bring
[1:51:14] another book of the Bible or something
[1:51:15] he says no he said it'll be right in the
[1:51:18] Word of God baptized in the name of the
[1:51:24] Father Son Holy Ghost it was already
[1:51:27] written in the Word of God everything is
[1:51:32] perfect
[1:51:33] bring me the two loaves for the
[1:51:36] atonement already showed three through
[1:51:39] Abraham and Sarah already showed three
[1:51:41] through Elijah and the woman with a
[1:51:45] woman it's already written it's already
[1:51:48] written in the scriptures already
[1:51:49] revealed it just needs opened up I'm
[1:51:52] sorry it's opened up it just needs
[1:51:54] revealed it'll be revealed in the seven
[1:51:55] thunders let's bow our heads to your
[1:52:00] heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord we just
[1:52:01] love you Lord so much Lord Lord God Lord
[1:52:05] quicken it into our hearts God Lord to
[1:52:07] seek you harder Lord God than we've ever
[1:52:10] seek you before God Lord more sincere
[1:52:12] God Lord the Bible says you're a you're
[1:52:15] a water of those that diligently seek
[1:52:16] you God Lord we want to pray like we've
[1:52:21] never prayed before Lord we're at the
[1:52:22] coming of the Lord Jesus Lord we just
[1:52:27] loved you we thank you Lord for your
[1:52:29] grace and mercy Lord protect each so we
[1:52:30] pray it wasn't too long door boring Lord
[1:52:33] but Lord we're just trying to express a
[1:52:34] thought Lord nor there's unders word God
[1:52:37] there's word Lord that that is unwritten
[1:52:40] that needs to be revealed God but as
[1:52:42] Lord will be found right in your
[1:52:44] scripture at the right time at the
[1:52:46] coming of the Lord and Jesus we desire
[1:52:50] those things or please be with us we
[1:52:52] just love you Lord blessed each saw
[1:52:55] every heart God may we keep this meal

[1:53:14] in the name of Jesus Christ a man
[1:53:17] saints of God I hope this was all right
[1:53:19] just a little teaching service by God's
[1:53:23] grace the Bible talks about the bread of
[1:53:26] sincerity so doubt all the way to Jesus
[1:53:33] Christ are we need to are where are we
[1:53:37] where we need to be when I got a touched
[1:53:42] last Wednesday when I was at work he I
[1:53:45] could feel his presence for three days
[1:53:47] still on me during the job walking and I
[1:53:53] all I had to do is just think a little
[1:53:56] bit about him and I just start crying
[1:54:00] his his presence among us when we think
[1:54:05] on him does our hearts swell up forget
[1:54:10] about the mysteries him just dying on
[1:54:12] the cross his sacrifice should be enough
[1:54:16] remember we have to go back to that
[1:54:18] atonement that day of atonement is
[1:54:20] coming here it what it was for the Jews
[1:54:21] but right before that it's gonna be
[1:54:23] really close
