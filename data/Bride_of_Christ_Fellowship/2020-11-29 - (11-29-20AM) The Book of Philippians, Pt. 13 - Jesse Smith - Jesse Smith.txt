bu Stephen good to see you sir Lord bless you buddy good to see you and then Sunday twice we only get to see him like every seven years I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to change that though I'm G try to change that but since we haven't seen him in seven years I was looking it was 2013 was the last time he was here and that's way too long now the reason I didn't invite was because he was pastor but now he's not Pastor anymore he's back to just evangelism so um since we haven't seen him in seven years I'm gonna have three services this weekend so you could call it like a Revival weekend by God's grace it's going to be wonderful if you haven't heard him you're really going to be blessed he's a real man of God brother McBride Saturday at 6 and Sunday 11 and 4 next Sunday by God's grace also brother amen is on third shift and so he's not here this morning he'll be here this evening and it's only for a month so this will only affect I think Naomi and beatric and then my family for Wednesday nights we're going to try to do Wednesday night at 6:30 half hour earlier because amen has to leave by 8 o'clock or else he's going to be late for work uh normally I'll preach till like you know 8:45 or something like that so I gotta really watch myself uh hopefully am man can give me like a wave you know on Wednesday night like gotta go brother and if we're just all enjoying it we'll say love you buddy you know we're just going to keep worshiping or maybe we can finish by the 8:00 so we're going to try 6:30 and if not then we'll have to go to Six the following week um I I'll tell amen we can just do like three songs you know on Wednesday night just to kind of make sure we redeem the time uh and uh so we were so happy to have him I think we had van here on Wednesday night as well right I think he's going to be with us for a few Wednesday nights as well so that's really special uh very special so just two announcements there brother McBride next week and then uh Wednesday early we'll try 6:30 by God's grace okay so some prayer requests Jose sick um so let's remember him he said he's very sick I prayed for him yesterday but he text this morning let's remember him in prayer as well he's still sick also that little two-year-old David deweer please keep praying for him he got better Wednesday after you know I think we prayed everybody was praying but then he the infection set back in on Thursday and so I think he's still in intensive care let's remember him and remember he was the one spared from abortion the doctors told his mother and father he's going to be a vegetable don't even have him they named him David because he was goingon to defeat Goliath uh and he he's a healthy boy can't talk can't walk yet um he's delayed but uh Satan's really fighting him so let's remember Little David deweer in prayer also Lydia had unspoken need I appreciate that darling and uh and there's a brother overse amilio he's translating all my YouTube videos into Spanish but his granddaughter is sick with fever and sore throat today and he asked for our prayers I said surely we'll pray for her name is Sharon Rose what a pretty name there very close closely associated with the message so let's remember uh him in prayer and his granddaughter are there any other needs this morning does anybody have any needs on their heart they like to be remembered okay let's remember uh Naomi's family in prayer as they leave on December December 7th Let's uh come against covid in Jesus name and pray for accurate test results let's pray for that that the will of God would be done you know Church how many times do people say keep this in prayer and yet we we pray for it one time maybe two it's hard to keep something in prayer unless it's directly affecting you that's why I wrote this down when Naomi said can you keep that in prayer and bang said can you pray for me I just I want to keep this in prayer I want to keep it every day just keep praying for these things uh I want to keep these in prayer so uh it's a lot easier said than done and the church said it's easy to say oh yeah I'll keep it in prayer but it's harder to keep it in prayer yes is TW oh yes yes yes okay yes yes Jackie let's remember Jackie in prayer for his job situation needs a a job by next month oh next week right December okay certainly we'll definitely pray for Jackie Hallelujah yeah I think we prayed for I don't know if you when you you were here but we prayed for Jose's family for jobs they lost their jobs because of covid and we prayed and then we prayed for them and then Jose said no God answered they just got a job so God gave them jobs I think just a couple weeks ago so just an encouragement you know as we pray God is merciful and faithful why don't we stand here and uh because we'll have a couple more songs of course as we normally do but let's remember these needs in prayer here let's bow our heads today Heavenly Father we just come again we give you thanks

Sharon Rose as well we rebuke Satan get behind those three souls in Jesus name May their bodies recover let Divine Healing operate Lord let their faith rise to receive it Lord and send your grace send your faith to them Lord God for it is a gift oh God every Miracle is a gift Lord every healing is a gift send the gift of your faith Lord God that it might Lord raise their faith they'll receive it

amen amen praise God let's go to our Bibles here let's go to Philippians chapter 4 I'd like to continue on this series I think the last time we preached on it was when brother John and Lisa and sister Lisa were here visiting back in October so Philippians 4 verse1 I believe this is part 13 uh of the series Philippians 4:1 read 1 to [Music] three Philippians 4 1:3 why don't I read uh uh I read 1 to four I think we'll get to verse four by God's grace I'll read verses 1 2 and three and then we can all read verse four together very uh well-known scripture but I'll read verse one 23 therefore my brethren dearly beloved and long for my joy and Crown so Stand Fast in the Lord my dearly beloved I beseech Yodas and beseech ctii that they be of the same mind in the Lord I entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the Book of Life let's read verse four together one two 3 rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise God so let's take a little bit and we'll preach here on these thoughts by God's grace um just to follow up on a few things um I've been trying to get in touch with the brother Stanley oops sorry um brother Stanley he watched our YouTube video on baptism and he got baptized at Cam's Church a couple weeks ago um I've been trying to reach out to him but he hasn't returned my calls he's just texted me and said he's real busy I invited him to our church but he said he's for a church that's closer uh down in nework it's about an hour and 45 minutes south of here it's almost directly south of aan so anyways just want to give you an up update on that we're happy he was baptized Cam and Simon really enjoyed fellowshipping with him uh but hopefully he finds a good home church that's our prayer so let's just remember him in prayer uh if you do uh and also uh yesterday I recorded the next video I'm I'm making a video about Joseph Brandon is he a prophet so I'm going to share it with him Billy Paul first before it goes public I just want to give those Brothers another chance uh to uh to receive correction from uh their dad's message by God's grace so uh we working on that we'll hopefully get that up this week uh by the grace of the Lord uh so I think that's about it uh I just want to update you on that okay so I have some quotes here and some slides so let's move over there by God's grace so we're looking at uh verses 1 to three we'll start with this and the theme of the first nine verses though is the God of Peace uh remember this is the book uh Philippians is known by theologians as the book of Joy because Paul keeps saying Rejoice Rejoice rejoice and uh it's known as the book of joy and yet it's such a paradox because you know from chapter one if you remember Paul was in prison but even while in prison he found reason to give God praise that all those that are around me got to hear the message praise God and that that's that's what I hope our lives are as well wouldn't you say Amen to that that no matter what situation I'm in no matter where I'm at people are going to hear the message which is basically Jesus Christ right Hebrews 138 Jesus is still alive he's in the saving business he's in the sanctifying business he's in the filling business praise God Amen and so Paul was able to Rejoice uh that at least people were hearing the message of the hour and that's what we do as well we rejoice in that when uh people can hear the word of God so uh these first these first nine verses are on peace now remember chapter one he was he Paul was rejoicing and let me just go over Scofield's division scoffield divides this book really by its four chapters so he has four divisions and uh scoffield says the first division is Christ is the believer's pattern rejoicing in uh suffering all right so Paul's in prison he's suffering remember he was rejoicing even uh he was rejoicing even when people were preaching Christ the wrong way Paul was still rejoicing in it so I'll say like this I'll Rejoice uh if the believe the sign uh hope they're watching I'll Rejoice even if they stay against us I'll still Rejoice because at least they're mentioning Christ right I'll Rejoice uh no matter as long as Jesus is being preached I'll rejoice in that because there's a possibility somebody sitting there like Jose remember Jose his testimony remember he was he sat in the message church that was a return Ministry for years and years and he always believed brother Bram was going to raise from the dead and come back until he came to this church and the Holy Spirit corrected him in this church praise God so see he sat around he knew something true about it right he the vision of the cloud before he even knew about the cloud brother Jose God blessed him today with healing by God's grace but he sat around here long enough until he came to our church and God gave the rightly divided word to him and it set him free from the false Doctrine praise God Amen so we rejoice as long as Jesus is being preached There's an opportunity for Christ to pull and send his true seed to those hungry hearts and to be able to pull them out because he said come out of her my people praise God Amen remember Jesus is still being named in the Catholic church this morning is he not they're saying father son Holy Ghost they're they they preach on Jesus Jesus right they preach on Jesus and so uh at least he's being named there uh but he's not the highest name now Mary's the highest name now the Trinity three person is the highest name but Jesus should be the highest name amen and if somebody really loves God there they're going to cling to that name of Jesus and Jesus is going to call them out amen just like he called you out of your denomination or Creed praise God so we rejoice in that that the God of Peace uh is able to re we're able to to give us peace and help us rejoice even when we suffer or even when people fall away from the message you know I got criticized yesterday uh oh what about all the people that left your church brother Jesse that must mean that that you're wrong that don't bother me 70 preachers left Jesus that don't bother me I'll say like this 70 Miracle working preachers left Jesus now people that left me I haven't seen many miracles in their lives right and just because somebody leaves you doesn't mean you're wrong if that's true then Jesus was wrong but he wasn't wrong he was right what it is is God like getting separated and just so you know brother Stephen I was calling out for your brother's name this morning in prayer right this morning and sister who I was calling out your sister's names and your brother's names in prayer this morning on my face praise God because I believe in praying for them to come back and I'll keep I don't care how many years go by I'm going to keep calling out their names amen because I believe in that I believe God is a god of restoration praise God Amen in fact I was talking to a brother a pastor from Connecticut last night and he said he was raised message but left it when he was 17 and he was out of the message for 16 years isn't it left it for 16 years and finally the Lord brought him back through just reading the Bible he had so much brother BR brother BR he just fell away because the the emphasis wasn't on Jesus but the holy spirit said read your Bible you read the the Bible for six months he said after that the holy spirit said now listen to the tapes and he said he he and his testimony was this he's been pastoring now 30 years so he must be in his 50s he said he always had a limp and his brother made fun of him he had a limp he couldn't walk and he said while listening to brother B's tape he was listening to a prayer line and brother and brother said oh the anointing is like a cloud in here he said the faith is so strong and the brother said he was praying and said Lord he said I wish I was there I would love to be in that kind of faith and the brother's testimony is that brother Ram said young man as you're sitting there he said receive your healing of your walking problem in the name of Jesus Christ and the brother said I talked to him last night he said the Holy Spirit knocked him off his chair and when he got up from the chair he was walking and he's completely whole amen and the brother said he shared that testimony with a brother who left the message and he said a pastor left a message from Lima and the brother said how can I leave the message when that's happen happened to me and the Pastor said you shouldn't because it's so real praise God so see that means those people that have left haven't had a real experience because they haven't sought god with the right kind of Faith praise God amen hallelujah amen see I listen to brother as you know and I went and preach what he said and God has done what brother Bram said but I heard brother ra say I've cast out Devils I prayed for the sick they've been healed I've seen miracles why because I took God's prophet and I took it back to the word and Jesus proved it was right how can I ever leave I can't because this is God's message amen and I don't want to praise God I want to stay right here praise God where we got the liberty of the Holy Spirit praise God and we got thus sayith the Lord I'm happy to do it so I'm send that brother my copy my book tomorrow he's also wrote some good articles on the cloud and I can't wait to get them so I'm looking forward to that but see despite suffering we must have joy the second theme is in Chapter 2 is the Bel Christ is our pattern and he rejoiced in lowly service Jesus had to condescend remember he had to take the form of a servant in able in order to do the will of God Church you and I will only do God's will when we humble ourselves and find our service that we can do for God not a can I say like this not a leoty and selfservice but a service to other people I was battl and discouraged recently you know I put about 50 hours in one of my last YouTube videos and only you know I'll say like this maybe only 200 people watched and I was getting a little discouraged I mean I put hours and hours into these things but I've got to remember that that uh the Bible says we must give honor to those who labor in Doctrine praise God and I've got to encourage myself by you know God if if the word that of truth that in there God is going to direct it to the hearts of those who really want to hear it praise God Amen and that brother Stanley's a good example that I made that video seven years ago the water baptism he heard it in 2020 s years later and was baptized in Jesus Christ name amen praise God Amen I don't know I it's just a time and season right we must wait upon God's time and season but the thing to do is serve people now praise God and be not weary in well-doing amen because God is Not forgetful of your labor of love praise God Amen in other words keep sharing those videos keep sharing those testimonies keep passing out books keep passing out Church age books keep passing out my book just keep doing something and God sees your efforts and God will reward us in new season but that was Jesus in Philippians 2 he had to condescend and take he left his glory and his theophany we'd say and he came down and the Word was made flesh and he became a man and humbled himself so we must ask God today Lord help me remember help me to humble myself so I can serve your people that's going to come in handy I shouldn't say handy that's going to come in uh uh needful as we look at chapter four in a moment now the third theme is in the third chapter Christ is our object uh rejoicing despite imperfections and remember the imperfections were the false doctrines we preached on in Chapter 3 The judaizers you know Paul called them dogs and uh the the legalism remember we preach on we went through all the message legalisms right we went through that short sleeves and uh no beards for preachers and wearing Peak behind the pulpit which uh none of these you find in the Bible no I don't wear pink behind the pulpit but some people might we all got our convictions praise God but making the making the gospel legalism rather than Freedom praise God freedom to obey the word of God and then uh now chapter four The theme Here is Christ is our strength as we Rejoice over anxiety stress does everybody know about stress anybody felt any stress lately that that's what chapter 4 is all about how do I overcome anxiety and I can say like this like a mental breakdown I've never had one but I've known numerous preachers that have because the stress gets them usually it's stress in the church like politics that that's what I've seen with my closest friends because of politics in the church they're afraid if I make this decision the the tithe payers and the the rich people they're going to get me here they're gonna come against me that's what I've seen in message churches that's when people have breakdowns oh you're going against established elders and they can vote me out I mean you'd have a breakdown too right if if your income was tied to uh a church and if you make a decision against a church they're going to cut off your income where's my family going to go that's a lot of pressure but the other side is Jesus is going to take care of me if I stand on his word and that and we all we all need help with that right I I'm not criticizing anybody who's had a mental breakdown uh as I found as I was talking to the brother yesterday it seems like Satan attacks men especially preachers as they get a little older like David Fell in his 50s to bash Sheba look at our precious brother Tim Humes uh look at the ones who've had different mind battles uh Ed bcll Perry green Donnie Reagan uh he had a real battle a couple years ago with the interracial marriage thing I mean think about like so it seems like mine's coming up I'm 40 now right almost 50 but what what I'm saying is what I'm saying is that uh these great battles are to come and we got to be fortified we got to be strengthened now praise God we can't let down the shield of Revelation now you got to get fresh Revelation and hold up the shield of Faith against every fiery Dart because if you get older you get tired right and you kind of get in your ways and you let we can't let down uh we can't let down the shield the revelation we got to keep praying and God give me fresh Revelation to overcome the recent darts right because we're going to get darts shot at us right how many know Satan leaves for a season right that means maybe the darts aren't as big right but when Satan comes back brother sister you know those darts are going to be ferocious and look at what these brothers have been through Tim and uh you know Ed and and Donnie uh Tim pu you know look at all the darts that the the huge darts that's been fired against him in church you're you're not exempt either that's right I'm just talking about preachers right now you're Dart fired at you right fiery big fiery Dart and you got to have the revelation of God to raise up at that time and extinguish it praise God amen so it doesn't burn you you can't get burned by Satan's Temptation you got to put out the fire praise God Amen you can't let yourself get burned up with can I say it like this burned up with greed or burned up with competition against that brother or burned up with lust right or burned up with insincerity or anger or bitterness we can't get burned up by that we got to be burn I sure will i' like to talk to him about that what major darts has Satan fired him as you get older because remember Solomon failed he should have just had that one sweet wife right the shulamite but instead he married woman after woman after woman and the Bible said they turned his heart in his old age see so as we get older we got to make sure we keep up our guard keep seeking God so we don't get hit by a dart that Mars Our Testimony now do I believe those brothers were saved absolutely many of them probably have the Holy Ghost I'm not the judge of that but the fact is church a dart's coming amen and we've got to overcome how I get on this we got to overcome anxiety and stress praise God because it's coming praise the Lord there's going to be stress that'll come right to you and you got to either take a stand on the word and hold up your Shield or you're gonna fight back with your human mind and your human understanding and your own emotions and feelings rather than thus say the Lord that's where we've seen some ministers fall I'm not saying which ones but when they try to use human reasoning and they're emotional uh and they try to figure it out themselves you can't lean on your own understanding church we must lean upon the word of God boy and get to my first slide Church everybody's pulling this morning well God bless you for that now verse one I just want this is I didn't cover this really heavily Paul said Stand Fast in the Lord so Paul entreats his beloved now I'm still going to maintain this when I preach it God has favorites I'm still going to maintain that because that word dearly beloved means his favorites Church you are God's favorite not by your not by your choice but by for knowledge amen I'm sorry let me say like not by your works but by God's foreign knowledge that you would love his word amen and you would love it more than the foolish virgin you'd love it more uh than the workers of iniquity you love it more than sinner you would love it with all your heart soul mind and strength that's why you're God's favorite because you're his bride it's relational I love my wife more than anybody else here sorry sisters she's my favorite because of relationship praise God Amen nothing against you sisters she's my favorite that that's all Paul is saying you are God's favorite you're God's choice to be right because the others were disqualified because they didn't love God but because you love God you're his favorite praise God because you love all the word because you love the word of the hour the restoration that Joel spoke of Hallelujah the finished mystery that John spoke of you love it that makes God that makes you God's favorite I still maintain that that it's yours favorite by his for knowledge so Paul says to his favorites now listen see people are that you should Joy most in people that's why I'm sad when I don't see Saints or they're discouraged because the Saints are my joy right you are my joy the ones I'm preaching the ones I'm feeding you're my joy and the ones that God's used me to save they're my crown right brother R said he said be a crown he said in the jewel of Jesus Christ right and then Paul says Paul tells the Thessalonians you are my crown so see every soul you win is a jewel in your crown it's a testimony so I have a crown but then I'm a jewel in Simon's Crown praise God because I learned from him right he save he saved me through the message there I'm I'm a jewel in his crown and so we all have our crowns we all got Jewels but one day Church we're going to throw those crowns at the feet of Jesus Amen because he's the worthy one of all of our crowns we wouldn't have a crown unless he was crowned with thorns amen and now he's crowned with with power and glory and strength and dominion and might forever and ever as king of kings and Lord of lords so Paul says Stand Fast in other words don't retreat and I'm glad I haven't retreated from believe the sign although I love them I know they're watching they're watching every every sermon now I I'm not going to Retreat I know this word's right Brothers he said Stand Fast like a Roman soldier remember if they left their Duty they die if a if a prisoner got released under their watch they died and history says they never retreated uh even though they knew their commanders could have them killed at any time remember Rome Rome was a dog eat dog Society it was it was the men all the men had the power women and children were just dirt bags really and a father could have his wife killed children he could sell them off into slavery they had all the power so did the soldiers the Roman soldiers they even the commanders could have any one of their soldiers killed but Paul said Stand Fast he said don't don't care so much don't don't be fearful be strong stand at your post of like solder like a fully armed Soldier stand there don't retreat don't be afraid I'm with you the Lord says how many are glad the Lord's with you how many have seen that he's with praise God he said just stand there like a soldier now he gets into this I'm just going to briefly Paul begs here now the word beseech means beg look at beg Paul's requesting entreating begging Paul Paul begs two of the women in the church to get God's mind about a particular situation which he doesn't tell us in other words these two women had their own thinking on a topic and Paul said can you drop your thoughts on this topic and can you get the Lord's thoughts on this and I said there could you imagine you're called out by name by God's prophet and the purpose is you're selfish minded now no offense because we're all no offense to these sisters but we're all selfish at times right I appreciate some of the amens on that one we're all selfish at times see Paul tried to mediate between them and the word uh means interests they had different interests so one sister was interested in doing her thing and the other sister wanted to do her thing a different way and Paul said you got to do God's thing what is God interested in doing this situation and he says I'm begging you sisters so see church if I ever beg if I ever beg or plead with people brother Jesse why don't you rebuke them well sometimes they need a rebuke sometimes they need to beg right you get somebody rebuking somebody all the time they're not going to want to be around you very much right all they do is rebuke Paul has to beg them sisters can you please think the same way can you be interested in the gospel instead of your own interest see they were in their carnal minds and brother M says oh and brother uh Nathaniel preached it really good didn't he he said uh contention only comes by Pride Satan I will I will I will I'll do this right so these sisters are saying I will I will instead of the Lord wants me to Pride and so he calls out these two sisters by name udias and cyi sisters can you drop your pride and can we all think on the same thing a man in prison pleading with three sisters can you please stop these fussing please he's in prison right and he why why didn't he write what you need to pray for more miracles and to shake down the prison again and have another Revival because remember that's what happened in Philippi he wasn't he wasn't praying for that he was praying for the unity of the church right and that's what we want here we want to be unified in the same mind the same interest in the Lord praise God we don't want to fight against one another we want to be United with one another and have the same interests see I'm interested in getting the message out I am not I've seen too many I know sister Wendy has to and beatric and different ones that have been around to different churches I'm not interested in just taking care of just making sure I mean I want to I want to take care of you but I'm not interested in just like focusing on us and not trying to send out missionary workers praise God or doing a part to try to in other words I want to give somebody else a chance to hear the message because this has done tremendous things for me this has transformed my life and I want other people's lives to be transformed the words I don't want to denominate and forget about everybody else I want to give them a chance to receive what I've received I want them to take a drink of this living water praise God because if you drink from it you'll never thirst again praise God your life will be changed but I know a lot of mess churches that that's what the brother was saying last night the 30 uh 30-year Pastor brother he's saying that's what he he said he started seven churches out near Connecticut because his church got too big now can you imagine this your church get so big instead of doing a building project you say brother you're a preacher you go start a church a couple cities down instead of saying you stay with me brother sister seven churches have come out of this one brother that's powerful to me that is so unselfish that's not his interest that's the mind of the spirit his interest is help me to get all the ties I can get and build a big church and try to just be the biggest message preacher I can be I told him I said brother that's really Apostolic I said that's the book of Acts amen praise God seven churches and brother Craig Pastor one of them now brother Craig does he took over one of those churches I like that what we need is the mind of the Lord praise God what we need is to be interested in what Jesus wants and not what we want remember brother Simon said last week he said brother he said remember he told the church people come into Cam's church and they criticize me because how small Church our church is remember brother Simon shared that last week he said all these preachers come and they say well Jesse's got such a small church he must be off the word so I told Simon the testimony about Ray Hernandez he came and told me thus sayith the Lord God gave me a word of the Lord for you why you're such a small church I said okay what is it right remember that I wonder too I would wonder right wouldn't you wonder things should grow right things more people it should attract more people but the word of the Lord is I'm trying to protect you from getting hurt praise God and I'm trying to protect you amen I'm going to put a hedge around you so you don't get hurt by the devil that you can serve me in your protective state in your garden praise God Amen and I told to Simon he's like wow brother I never heard of that and because of that I got 70 seven videos about the message I put out a book uh I think over 300 400 copies have been uh made because of that uh sent around around the world and because of that because we're in our protection we instead of fighting can I say this instead of fighting Saul like David and Saul instead of fighting one another we can fight off the enemy praise God and we can try to get the word out to as many people as want to hear uh so we don't care how many are here as long as Jesus is here praise God amen as long as the spirit of Truth is here that's what matters praise God so Simon's like yeah he said could have been a number of things he said but when you got thus sayi the Lord when you got a word from the Lord you can rejoice in that yes I can too praise God thank the lord well I needed that one well I tell you brother Ray and look now because of Co he can't come so just God allowed that for a he said every time I drive by your church he said I thank the Lord for a lighthouse in akan Ohio verse three I entreat thee also true yoke fellow so see there are true workers and there are false workers around the message right now what's a Yol fellow a yoke fellow is someone who's married to you so Paul says see we're all married together right we're all the bride we're engaged to Christ right all all of you yoke to me all of you Yol we have a relationship we have an office we have a labor we have a study we have a business we're yoke fellow we're Partners all of my partners are yolked in marriage to Christ but there are some of us that are false not some of us but there's some people around the message that are false yoke Yol fellow right they try to come and put their shoulders to the wheel but then they H because of this and offenses come and all these things I can't I can't labor in that anymore I'm not a partner with that anymore but Paul says thank God for the true ones and let me say that thank you for being a true yoke fellow can I just say that this morning because we don't have any Impostors here this morning praise God amen hallelujah thank you true Yol fellow who are partnered with us to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to change this our lives our families this city to whatever extent God will have us this world this nation we're trying to promote the Gospel of Jesus Christ with our yoke fellow see your tithes and offerings I couldn't do it without your tithes and offerings listen without your tithes and offerings we are yolked we're Partners in the gospel of Christ I can't do it alone those Ox didn't do it by themselves they needed someone Yol to them praise God or Yol together and so Paul tells them at Philippi help those women that labored with me those true Yol fellow those true partners in the gospel help those sisters huh isn't that strange the weak women weren't getting enough attention paid to them does that sound familiar a lot of message churches they don't care about the sisters just about said can you please help those women they're just as in helping us as everybody else praise God they're they're Yol they Yol to Christ just as much as anybody else praise God see how important your prayers are Church see how important your attendance is your tithes and offerings your singing your specials I I missed your special didn't I I'm sorry I just realized that forgive me okay second service okay thank you well it happens every week I fail somehow you know so I always always forget one thing forgive me sister I'm sorry so Paul tells them help those sisters that have labored with me now not preaching but the he says later in other scriptures that have secured me or ministered to my needs in other words fed me made me clothes fixed my clothes or giving me offerings or help me out you know now this is interesting too he says he names Clement Clement was a a companion of Paul a member of the Church of Philippi he was identical with a uh CL Clement who was Bishop of Rome towards the close of the first century okay so Paul says uh let me let me read that there in verse three I entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the Book of Life praise God so Paul says help those sisters that labor with me and also the other preachers there's the five-fold ministry and and the Saints said see anyone who's helping the fivefold Ministry is a true yoke fellow praise God whether it's the prophet whether it's Pastor Clement amen whoever's helping them Paul says they're yoke F and their names are in the Book of Life praise God that's how you know your name is there you see the message you support it and you uh you're interested in getting the message out that shows you're a yoke fellow a true one praise God now I got a lot of history on met and Rome so let me go through this quickly I didn't want to put it on there and not preach it after first receiving the gospel around 36 ad so that was about three years after the Holy Ghost fell Rome got the Rome got the gospel from the apostles andronicus and Junia did you know that Paul names the brothers that left Jerusalem that went to Rome to bring the Holy Ghost there andr andronicus and Junia look how Jesus said them two by two the first church in Rome fell during a 13-year period so the Holy Ghost flourished from 30 so what's that four five years the Holy Ghost flourished in Rome until uh there was a the Jewish Christian apostles were banned from the city so the leaders in Rome banned all the Holy Ghost filled Saints and guess what all the Holy Ghost filled saints went those that weren't born again stayed because they were kind of half halfway but all the Holy Ghost filled Saints left Rome for 13 years this is legit history so they're banned for 13 years finally they get to come back but with the faithful yeah with the faithful expelled worship of Bale and asra flourish in the midst of the lukewarm church members they still came to church but they didn't have the Holy Ghost filled Saints there anymore so now little worship of baale came in ashth I idolatry slipped in the church Church without the Holy Ghost filled Saints when they came back 13 years later the Pagan infused Church repulsed them every the saints were like what is going on this don't even look like a holy ghost filled church and then the Bible said Jesus removed his Candlestick from the first church in Rome as he warned and Christ raised up a second Church of Rome the First Church of Rome is still there it's the Vatican and the Saints said there was the second Church of Rome Third Church of Rome there was all these churches because people let down the bars so God had to send a new thing praise God Satan's first tactic was to persecute the Holy Ghost filled Saints get them out of the church for 13 years now beginning in 4180 the First Church of Rome slowly and consistently added Pagan Deeds to their worship until they rejected traditional holy Passover observance so where did they fall short in their holiday Services history says the first thing they compromised on was their holiday worship the Passover the resurrection history said they started embracing the Pagan Easter feast of Ishtar when polycarp arrived around 150 he said the faithful Bishop also detested their wicked Deeds of idolatry with statues in the Eucharist so they started compromising when they got a day off they started acting like the world in their holiday celebrations raing rather than acting like a real Christian so we got to be very careful now I still have the same stance about Christmas Easter Thanksgiving you name it I still got the same stance there's Liberties you have but if you see your life starting to fall away because of traditions you must cut off those traditions because a a because a liberty is something you do it doesn't help you spiritually it doesn't help you any spiritual way so be careful what you allow in your Liberty because uh if if if you're not careful a false spirit will get in there to make you act like the world that's why I like uh the youth meetings in Louisiana over Easter because they lock them in there and they preach to them and you need the holy ghost man that's so different than the Easter of this world Amen God bless that brother Tim br he said he's had so much criticism for that over the years and look at how God has blessed him for that I like that praise God so see they start with just compromising on oh we just celebrate this way we just do Christmas and we just do Easter we just do Thanksgiving this way watch a few football games yeah you're on the road out brother you're gonna have a game all right you're gonna have a sell your soul to the devil kind of thing that's the kind of game you're going to get into and by the time polycarp gets there in 50 ad they have lit 150 ad they have literal statues and they're already doing transubstantiation 90 years later just because that 13-year absence now look I I love it what it says uh okay this is all about polycarp okay he learned from John polycarp couldn't bear false teachers and tried them he would not even talk with Mar marcion and Valentini who were the Great Roman of false doctrines at the time at 90 years old he traveled 1,500 miles to plead with anus the bishop of the First Church of Rome remember Clement was a bishop at Rome but 90 years later another Bishop rose up in the first church of course Clement was a good brother this is a bad brother and he pleaded with him to repent of his participation the Pagan Easter celebrations in every city he visited while approaching Rome he preached Christ and saw mirac and healings at 90 years old church be encouraged no matter how old you are if you're a yielded vessel Christ can do great things he'll heal the sick and through your life praise God he'll cast out Devils through your life he'll hear your prayers just remain devoted now if he can travel 1,500 miles to correct a bishop why can't I make a video to correct a prophet's son Hallelujah oh and the prophet Sunny he's called me a make believer now not me personally but he's called anyone that doesn't believe in playing tapes make Believers he's also called us deuses for not playing tapes so anybody that'll say that about me well I got a right in Christian love to bring correction to that but that's the part people don't like to do oh you can't touch that person why why not if I'm wrong if I'm a Child of God God's going to spank me if he's a child of God God's got to correct him so poly carp said why don't God use me and so God Vindicated it amen God Vindicated his trip praise God to correct the Church of Rome but they turned him down once in Rome he visited the first church he witnessed their worship of images Peter and the Eucharist and and seus and I'm sorry anicetus refused correction picart visited the second and third churches of Rome and saw God pour out Rome's last recorded Revival around 150 ad the last Revival the sick were healed demons cast out dead were raised Al life before leaving poar also brought back the straying Val valencians and the marcionites out of false Doctrine into truth their first love and look what happened when he got home you think he'd be a hero right when he got back no when he returned to samna eventually turned himself into the pagans demanding his life in order to spare the other Christians lives when he got back he wasn't a a he wasn't a hero he was a he was a scumbag and they said you better turn yourself in or we're going to burn down found all these Christians houses and murder him and kill him so he turned himself in what a man of God he he gave his own life in order to spare the lives of other men he was burned to death as a testimony of how Christlike he was my the pagans would not allow his disciples to have his corpse look look how much he was like Christ because they said that his disciples would claim he revived and raised from the dead like Christ so they flayed his flesh and they ground his bones and cast his ashes over a running stream they wouldn't give his body back because they thought he'd rise from the dead that's how much he was like Christ God help us church God help us to be like Christ what a saint and what it start with again Easter the bunny rabbit you know egg collecting you want to collect something collect some change and let's go send to a missionary praise God I saw a dime back there this morning somebody collect that let's go dime hunting around here let's send it to a missionary help those women which labored with me listen their works and who they work with revealed Heaven's acceptance of their names who you're Associated reveals if your name's in heaven or not I'm glad to be associated with brother Brandon praise God hallelujah although many people don't think I am I am I don't care what they say you know because what I preach praise God but see who you yoke with who you partner with shows where your name's at he said usually people that have gifts are the people who don't want gifts see Paul tried to run from the things so did Moses great leaders like to try to run from the job they know what lays before them so if you take guy that says oh Lord fill me with power I'll go out there cast out devils so never do it God knows better than to trust anybody like that see it's the guy that don't want nothing to do with it you see that's the guy that God can take him and teach him something sometime you see so what has God taught you and I lately see we want we need to be taught things church we need to be taught how to labor for the kingdom of God we need to be taught as we said with our gifts we need to be taught how to use our gifts and to focus on them that God can use us to bless other people see so let let's not add let's not ask God God I got to do a miracle or God i' I've got to cast out a devil let's say God teach me something so I can help somebody teach me how to live my life so I can be a blessing to somebody else here this is just about the book of life so brother saying he's talking about Judas right they all Rejoice but Jesus said you you need to Rejoice that your name's on The Book of Life not because you do Miracles because your name's on the book in heaven name has been recognized still doesn't mean you're Sav see you're not life that's not the blam's book of life and that records the living who are confessing salvation yet not sealed by the Holy Ghost right the Bible said on that day there's Books open there's the book of life and then the Bible says books so there's many books that will be open one of those books is the Lamb's Book of Life and one of those books is The Book of Life praise God and so we know your name can never be removed off the Lamb's Book of Life because that's what the Bible says amen the Bible says that Revelation 13 those that don't worship the Beast their names were recorded on the book of the lamb before the foundation of the world praise God so it can never be removed amen that means god knew you'd be a true worshipper you wouldn't love denominational things right you would love holy things you'd love righteous things youd love the power of God Amen so God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and Paul said the women that work with me oh I know where their names are at they're on the Lamb's Book of Life amen and we'll see why here in a little bit we'll see why why were they how did Paul know their names were on the Lamb's Book of Life now I'm going to get skip past that right here how did Paul know these sisters names were on the Lamb's Book of Life because for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only I give thanks but all the churches of the Gentiles in other words they put their lives can I say like this for us it's your reputation you sisters put your reputation on the line when you dress like a modest woman is that right God's not asking you to be a martyr right now to lay your but you put your reputation on the line you some of you could put your jobs on the line i' i' been sisters have emailed me this week a sister emailed me just last night and said I'm wearing skirts now only I just quit my job I lost my job because of it I said God bless you for that now let me go back see Paul knew they were names were in heaven because they sacrificed everything to support the message of God let me go back I commend unto you Phoebe our sister here's some more fellow labors who's a servant of the church which is at uh Sentria that you receive her in the Lord has become a Saints you assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you for she ha been a secure of many and of myself also that means a provider or an assistant or someone who ministers to your needs and Paul tells the brothers make sure you help these sisters help other people so let me say like this sisters if you have a Ministry of helping feed the poor and you need my help let me know I'll help you I just gave brother Jose a offering to help that woman down there who didn't uh in uh Columbia she didn't have any food he was supposed to mail this week or at least I'm sorry Western Union this week we are supposed to help those who are helping others praise God that's why I've always said if you know someone your neighbor somebody who doesn't have food let me know so we can help them you think this is you think we need to take this out of the Bible like this doesn't need to be preached I think it needs to be preached more right because we're in Le sea everybody's rich and we get our eyes off of those people that are hurting sometimes we forget to help the poor right we forget forget to keep our eyes open and our ears open for people that are needy I think it needs preach just as much today greet Priscilla and Aquilla they had a house church for Paul they had a church in their house not like this likewise greet the church that is in their house salute my wellbeloved EpiPen who is the first fruits of a AI unto Christ greet Mary who bestowed much labor on us how did Paul know these women and men why would Paul salute them in his letter because they put their lives on the line for the message they put their reputation on the line for the message I thank God all of you put your incomes on the line for this message don't you this is why Paul sends special greetings greet that one greet that one greet that one they've laid their lives on the line for this message and they're my partners in the gospel oh church we when we get there we ain't going to just see men on the front lines we're going to see women on the front lines praise God some of them labor more than the brothers right we all know pastors be and I were talking about it in Naomi one we all know pastors they get treated like kings and they hardly they all they do is preach they don't do anything else and that's fine for them but what about all the people laboring doing more labor and suffering more and working harder than even the preachers who's going to get the greater reward those who invested in their gifts more those who took that Talent invested in it and doubled it that's who's going to get the greater reward not those who got life on easy street now it's different if they're praying and fasting in all that free time they got that's different and they're going to got a great reward for that I'm talking about people that don't want to serve they just want to be served that's heathenism Jesus said the Gentiles just want a lord over people I'm not here a lord over you I'm here to let the Lord rule you I'm here to speak the Lord's word to help you be a servant to us all praise God to make sure we're all yolked together we're all true yoke fell we're true Partners in the gospel this man epenetus his name means praiseworthy a Christian at Rome greeted by St Paul designated his his beloved I'm sorry he's designated as Paul's beloved because he was the first saint saved see Church each person has a special testimony in the local church under Christ Paul says I remember when that brother that s first sister got saved there in Rome oh I remember when that Lydia got received the first message out there in Philippi and look God's got a testimony for you I remember when God met or God saved this sister at the airport I remember when this sister got the holy ghost at the altar praise God I remember when God saved that guy you see each person has a special testimony God's writing a testimony of your life and it's going to be a witness with the Overcomers but it's going to be a witness against those who turned down Christ it's a beautiful story I've had Brothers tell me you're going to be a witness to those who had smaller families and had full-time pastorship this is what they told me and did less for the kingdom of God well my prayer is to do more for the kingdom of God help me to be a faithful labor in the things of God because I want a special testimony unto Christ I'll say like this I was the first one in aaran to I think I'm the first fruits of aine I was the first one I Simon's witnessing me right down there on bookto Street in aan I was the first I'm the first frots of akaran by God's grace wow that's fresh to me now let me finish here let me give me five minutes here so I'll keep going verse four I tell you these remember last time I preached I didn't get through one verse last time I preached it's so deep you can you can tie you can tie the whole new testament together right with these letters and oh okay this is where that person came oh that impacted the church in Rome and you can tie all this together it's one great story the story of Christ spreading his message verse four so he says he begs these sisters to have the same interest he says help the women and then he says rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice clean out these problems in the church get get these people to stop fighting help out these sisters that need your help and let's rejoice in the lord always clean out all the problems get all the problems fixed and let's be a church that rejoices always in what Christ has done for us I love it I love how Paul this whole book he goes back and forth to rejoice and then let me warn you and rejoice and let me rebuke you and let me warn you he said rejoice and then let me warn you he does it right here so remember remember chapter three finally my brethren Rejoice he says beware of dogs he said everybody Rejoice now beware of those dogs that are going to come in and try to eat you up everybody Rejoice but help out those sisters everybody Rejoice stop arguing and just getting the same just get in one Accord for the sake of the church a't that beautiful and Paul said Paul told Timothy this he said preach the word not your opinions preach the word we need to hear that get any any interest uh any personal interest out let's get it out let's all be interested let's partner together for the message and let's Rejoice amen hallelujah what a book of Acts church this is amen beware of these dogs rejoice in God rejoice in what Christ has done in your life back and forth Rejoice rebuke Rejoice correction Rejoice watch out for these dogs that are going to come in God help us see Sinners and Saints should observe your moderation as the Lord soon to come that's what verse five says he says Rejoice again I say rejoice let your moderation this also means gentleness we know means temper as well also means gentleness let your gentleness be known unto all men the Lord is at hand so why are you careful about what you how you live because you know the Lord is soon to come right why am I watching what I eat why do I watch what I why why am I careful what I watch why am I careful what I spend my time on because I know the Lord is soon to come right and all men so see it's not just the Saints I just got to behave on Sunday no it's every day praise God he said let let it be known to all men so everybody should see like I'm in a condition where I'm going to I'm planning to leave this place right I I'm I'm living in a way that I I know Jesus is coming back praise God that's how I live my life I'm not really tied too much to the things of the world here I'm not penny pinching and all these things like that you know as far as like oh I'm gonna be here forever I'm not going to be here forever I'm going to go up to the mayor supper the lamb praise God now it's okay to Penny pinch we got different kinds you know of people I'm saying our plan is not to be here for forever is to go in the Rapture if it doesn't well then brother said we're more blessed we get to be raised first we all we all say we want to live to the Rapture and not die but brother said you're more blessed if you die because you're raised first so oh you think about that one later today because I don't want to die really but if I die I'm more blessed because I get to have a new body first now brother just says what if God would have told John the Revelator now it's going to be 2,000 years before my coming John would have come back and told the church well guess you might as well eat drink be married because there's going to be many generations oh Jesus ain't coming for 2,000 years see so see church he said the church would be loose there would have been no on the mark Or No Focus or not I'm hitting the target so many times Our Lives don't hit the target right our lives got to hit a Target I need to accomplish this and brother man says if if you're not if if you're not living like the Rapture soon your life is not it's not going to hit the target It's Gonna Miss it's gonna go over like brother said it's gonna go over top of your head right we're gonna miss the target so in other words you have to have a focus you have to have a yoke fellow you have to have a yoke you have to have a Ministry and you got to stay centered on that and hit the mark of that Ministry and you will if you think Jesus is soon to come you know that's why I tell you all all of you the numbers of videos I do it's not to brag but it's for me to know that when Jesus comes I'm going to tell him Lord I've labored for you it's so I know that I've I've not quit right I'm aiming my aim is to do more and I'm letting you know that just to keep me encouraged too so I don't get discouraged when my videos flop and nobody seems to like them but said keep me encouraged praise praise God that I'm pressing on toward the mark to spread this gospel to preach the gospel to every nation and we're doing it through the internet until this Corona virus lets up and we can send them out again praise God like we did help Craig and help Simon and we sent some to bend the rod over the years see there have been no waiting so we got to keep our focus on Jesus return brother they said brother should evangelist continue on the field of course what do they mean certainly by all means don't change the thing if Jesus come in the morning Preach Today like it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be at this hour these are familiar I just want to review them to you and let me close it this church may God help us to live free from Stress and Anxiety what a lesson sister Wendy a man in prison telling me not to get stressed out he's in prison probably been beaten diseases infections stale bread can you imagine dirty water they had to get out of the well you think they gave him the best water in in prison do you think he got the best food in prison a man who's getting treated like trash and he tells them you don't have to live with all that stress let go of your anxiety he said don't be careful for anything don't get stress out and don't get anxiety for any single cause amen who's telling me that a man who's locked up in jail who has no Freedom who is at the mercy and he could be killed any moment sister beatric but he's like I'm not worried about it I've got the peace of God in my heart well no doubt that's from the Holy Ghost seal though right that only Springs forth out of a soul that's sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost who's telling you to not worry about anything a man who could have worried about all of his problems oh the preachers are bad mouthing me that was chapter one The Women aren't getting along in the church what happened to my is my Ministry very effective no it was very effective wherever you have this flesh you're going to have problems but may may they be minor problems do not be stressed out for anything church but in every trial use prayer and supplication is intercession with Thanksgiving and make your request known unto God well brother Jesse this person died or my my family hates me or I lost my job or this and this in everything give thanks don't let anything stress out your mind so you get your ey eyes off of Christ you're going to miss the mark right you're going to miss the Mark if if you start worrying about something else you're going to miss the service the job you're supposed to do your arrow is going to go way off the mark but he said don't let anything cause you Stress and Anxiety so you stop the the Yoke and the work and the service that you're doing together as a local church remember this is to a local church is to a little church like bride of Christ Fellowship praise God don't let anything stress you out don't worry about it but you can't just say don't worry about it you got to say go pray about it and don't worry about it yes so our question is have you prayed about whatever you're battling that will be the answer Church to every anxiety and stress that you have what does careful mean anxious troubled with cares to care for to look at to seek to promote one L it is your interest that's why we get so anxious because we want something to happen instead of wanting what God wants to happen caring or providing for oh I've got to do this I've got to care I God's going to take care of it that's right now God will give you a partnership in doing that but Paul says don't be careful for anything don't have anxiety and stress over anything see church will only be thankful and this Thanksgiving right we'll only be thankful it only comes how can I be thankful how can I make sure I I worship the right way you have to pray and make your request to God to move on your behalf even though you're content if he doesn't this is the only way to overcome the anxieties in our lives is to get alone with God In Prayer or maybe here at the church and just say God I want this to happen this but nevertheless let your will be done and I'm going to stand up and I'm going to thank you and I'm going to sing the songs and give thanks and praise God and the anxiety will leave you praise God it can't stay in the presence of Christ in the presence of thankfulness that anxiety devil can't stay he's got to flee praise God resist anxiety and it will flee from you resist stress and it will flee from you through thankful prayer and the confidence that I ask God and whatever God decides to do that's fine with me but I asked him praise God and that will keep my heart in a state of peace that even a man in a prison could experience let's stand to our feet here it's okay to ask your request church but just give God a chance to do something outside of it and then this formula has to work for its thus sayeth the Lord as long as you pray you make intercession you make your requests and you give thanks the bible promises the peace of God will come into your heart musicians if you'll come it's through prayer the peace of God overcomes all anxiety and trouble this was Sister Naomi's memory verse earlier this year right the peace of God which passes all understanding let me look up that word pass here I knew I had my computer up here for one reason the peace of God which passes all understanding it means to go higher to stand out to rise above am Eagles right Rising above the peace of God will rise up it'll be superior it'll be greater in power it'll surpass all of your understanding well all I can understand is I've got rats and mice around me and I'm getting dirty water and food and I'm in Chains that's all I can understand but Paul said I'm not going to look at that I'm GNA pray for deliverance and even if God doesn't praise the Lord and so he rose above that situation he rose Up On Eagle's Wings and if he can rise over his anxiety how many believe you can rise over it as well praise God let's play that song The Wings of Faith as we have a word of prayer here if anyone desires Prayer church you're more than welcome to come I could anoint you with oil if you feel led to do that we can pray for you let's not have any anxiety or stress this is a stressful time you probably heard the the statistics in America all the suicides and uh all the the the drug overdoses because of being locked down that's just Devils right that's just Devils but the Bible gave the way out if you're locked down you're not locked out of heaven can I say like that you might be locked out of your job you might be locked out of your family fellowship but you're not you have the Open Door to Heaven praise God Amen praise God [Music] Amen you have direct access to the throne of God and you are promised peace don't say brother Jesse I tried it no no you must not try it the right way because Paul said it will surpass everything you understand it will keep your heart in mind that means guard it'll guard you how father we thank you for this word today how relevant your word is today my goodness Lord I just love how you lead me I don't even know where I'm going I'm just like a she trying to follow you just trying to that still small voice Lord help us to be focused today Lord God to hit the mark so everyone knows that we're living for the Lord's coming help us Lord to help other people to serve you and lastly Lord if we are stressed out and if we have anxiety may we follow the Bible remedy for that problem prayer telling God what we want to happen asking him but then yielding to him and giving thanks and you promis we would rise above all the cares anxieties of the world
