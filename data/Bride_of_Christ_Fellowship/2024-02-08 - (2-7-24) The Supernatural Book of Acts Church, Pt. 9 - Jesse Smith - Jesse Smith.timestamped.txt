[0:00] Holy Spirit I was sitting there saying
[0:02] amen I was enjoying it and I just
[0:04] appreciate a faithful brother like that
[0:05] he's always got a special place in my
[0:07] heart brother Brian he's just intrical
[0:10] part of our church and my
[0:12] testimony we're glad to be brothers in
[0:14] Christ Hallelujah and I just want to
[0:16] tell I don't maybe sister ha can rely or
[0:18] relay this on to brother amen um he and
[0:22] I were talking we talked for about 45
[0:23] minutes on his drive home
[0:26] and he said when he walked out the
[0:28] second service he said he felt the the
[0:30] Holy Ghost was already there in a very
[0:31] powerful way he said he hadn't felt that
[0:34] in a while and he just he said just I
[0:36] just want to encourage you brother Jesse
[0:37] he said it it really encouraged me he
[0:40] said because uh sometimes in our church
[0:42] we'll sing 10 songs before the sermon 10
[0:44] ssongs what how would you like it if I
[0:46] did
[0:47] that no it's all good but every church
[0:50] is different they're Sovereign of itself
[0:52] he said we normally do 10 songs at our
[0:53] church he said U but he was he said he
[0:56] was preaching in Indiana and they did
[0:57] about eight songs and he came out to
[0:58] this presence of God
[1:00] and he said after three songs on Sunday
[1:02] night he stepped out and he said he felt
[1:04] the presence of God the same he did with
[1:05] eight or 10 songs and so he wanted to
[1:08] remind me he said brother Jesse said
[1:09] don't ever feel discouraged he said God
[1:11] is in the quality not so much the
[1:14] quantity so just another good reminder
[1:17] and I told Brother Brian too I was we
[1:19] were watching the live stream when he
[1:21] when he prayed for Zion and it was
[1:23] either right before that prayer or
[1:24] during that prayer that Zion perked up
[1:27] and he started feeling better and he has
[1:29] not any of those sicknesses since then
[1:31] I'm just trying to say it real nice
[1:33] let's thank the Lord for that praise God
[1:35] brother Brian was really
[1:37] encouraged now we're starting to get
[1:39] worried you know it's been it's been
[1:41] about you know 14 or not 14 been about
[1:43] 10 or 12 hours since he'd been able to
[1:45] eat anything and I was starting to get
[1:47] worried but when he was praying there
[1:49] you know coming through the live stre Z
[1:50] just kind of perked up and started being
[1:53] his regular self there by God's gra
[1:55] reminded us of Jesus right the Roman
[1:57] ceran said just speak the word and when
[1:58] they got back he said when did did my
[2:00] servant get well he said right about the
[2:01] time right about the time so we're
[2:04] thankful for the word of God you know I
[2:06] want to give all the all the glory and
[2:07] all the credit to our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09] because he's rich in Mercy acts 8:26
[2:12] here thank you for standing I know it's
[2:13] been a long time to stand but we'll just
[2:14] read verse 26 let's read that together
[2:17] then we'll have you be seated one two
[2:19] three and the angel of the Lord spake
[2:22] unto Phillip saying arise and go toward
[2:26] the South unto the way that goeth down
[2:29] from Jerusalem
[2:30] unto Gaza which is Desert may God add
[2:33] His blessings to the reading of his word
[2:35] you may be seated praise
[2:37] God yeah I appreciate everybody standing
[2:39] so long there I didn't really mean to
[2:40] have you stand so long um so we'll pick
[2:43] up here on part nine we did part eight
[2:45] back in January so I kind of took a
[2:47] little break from that one was looking
[2:48] at the book of Romans series I'm still
[2:49] enjoying that one and we'll keep going
[2:51] on that one soon by the grace of the
[2:52] Lord but just A Brief Review you know we
[2:55] looked last time at the beginning of
[2:57] this chapter verses 1 to 25 on uh the
[3:01] Revival in Samaria and we we were
[3:03] looking at Simon the Sorcerer And what a
[3:06] what a character uh we see here you know
[3:08] we see how he went from Joy where he
[3:11] actually got baptized he went from Joy
[3:14] here and then after the Holy Ghost fell
[3:15] then he got bitter because Peter said
[3:17] you you got you're full of bitterness
[3:19] right your heart is full of bitterness
[3:21] so it's amazing how how people can have
[3:23] such a response to the gospel but if
[3:24] they're not careful the enemy can can
[3:27] fly in there Jesus said it's like a bird
[3:29] flies in there and snatches away the
[3:31] seed word of God so may God help us to
[3:34] have good ground that the word of God
[3:35] can fall on Hallelujah I know you do
[3:37] because you've been here a long time
[3:39] Hallelujah but remember even Judas the
[3:41] scarat had the ground for three and a
[3:42] half years until really showed up what
[3:44] kind of ground it was right here Simon
[3:46] the sorcer this might have been a few
[3:47] days we don't know maybe a few weeks he
[3:50] was baptized and then watching the
[3:52] ministry of Phillip uh but then it
[3:54] wasn't long he he sees the Holy Ghost
[3:56] fall and then he says I want to buy that
[3:58] with money now think about about that
[4:00] before he had all the power over the
[4:02] city with demonic powers and then he
[4:04] thinks I can spend money and now I can
[4:06] have control over the power of God and
[4:09] Peter says you don't even know what's in
[4:11] your heart in other words no man can
[4:13] control the move of God Amen God is
[4:16] Sovereign Hallelujah now we want the
[4:17] mind of Christ but no man is perfect
[4:20] right no man always has the mind of
[4:21] Christ no man outside of Jesus nobody's
[4:24] perfect only Jesus is perfect Hallelujah
[4:27] but it just it's just it's amazing how
[4:29] he went from such joy to such bitterness
[4:32] that fast and God help us now let's
[4:34] let's be honest sometimes we go from
[4:35] such joy to services and right after we
[4:38] can be so
[4:39] disappointed right or we can go through
[4:40] a Temptation go from such overwhelming
[4:43] joy we sing about to getting home and
[4:46] and there's such a disappointment maybe
[4:47] the pipe's broken you know or maybe we
[4:49] forgot to pick up groceries the day
[4:51] before Oh I don't have any food for
[4:52] supper tonight or you know you get a
[4:54] call someone died in the family and it's
[4:56] grief you know you experience such
[4:58] roller coasters but we must remember God
[5:00] is the author of all of this praise God
[5:03] the footsteps of the righteous are order
[5:05] of the Lord all things work together for
[5:07] good to them that love the Lord
[5:08] hallelujah so we're thankful for God's
[5:10] mercy and love and uh it was a wonderful
[5:12] time to look at the scriptures there
[5:13] last time now here we're going to look
[5:15] at uh uh we're going to start here again
[5:17] with uh verse 26 by the grace of God
[5:20] actually you know I'm going to just back
[5:21] up a little bit I'm going to share a few
[5:23] more things you know here you know in
[5:25] this chapter so far we've seen such a a
[5:27] contrast between Simon the sorcerer and
[5:30] Philip the Evangelist right we see such
[5:32] a contrast of course Simon was working
[5:35] under demonic power he was a sorcerer
[5:37] but philli was an evangelist right and
[5:40] we know an evangelist is to turn the
[5:42] hearts of the people right to get them
[5:44] to repent to get them uh to believe God
[5:47] to show the miraculous power of God
[5:50] Church we've seen that in brother Brian
[5:51] Hawkins life remember he was evangelist
[5:53] just came in here we've seen the
[5:54] supernatural I've seen God do Miracles
[5:56] through that man Hallelujah and I was
[5:58] privileged to be in the presence of one
[6:00] of them praise God the doctors had said
[6:02] brother Rod the doctors said uh he's a
[6:05] veteran the in the Air
[6:08] Force Air Force and he had degenerative
[6:11] hips and he said you're 45 and you got
[6:13] to have a double hip replacement and he
[6:15] told me that and I felt the Holy Ghost
[6:16] follow me I said brother you're too
[6:18] young to have that I said is all your
[6:20] sins confessed he saides I said let's
[6:22] pray we're going to speak to those hips
[6:24] we're going to speak life into those
[6:26] hips and so we just said a simple prayer
[6:28] few days later he goes back to the
[6:30] doctor the doctor said we don't know
[6:31] what happened Hips Don't regenerate but
[6:33] yours did hallelujah amen hallelujah I
[6:37] was there when it happened I was there
[6:39] when Jesus did it praise God and he's
[6:42] told that testimony and the doctor said
[6:43] we don't know what happened this
[6:45] happened before but we know Jesus Christ
[6:47] does it Hallelujah then the one time he
[6:50] prayed for the sister who she'd fallen
[6:51] and she had a um uh what's that sciatic
[6:54] nerve problem or the the backbone or uh
[6:57] and just had pain all weak and could
[7:00] hardly walk I remember she walked in
[7:01] here brother Brian prayed for her and
[7:02] she walked out here completely well pain
[7:05] all week and in the presence of God and
[7:07] she was sitting right there that third
[7:08] chair I always remember that third chair
[7:10] and she walked out of here perfectly
[7:11] well by the grace of God hallelujah so
[7:13] we're thankful you know God does that
[7:15] God sends us men that have gifts right
[7:18] since Jesus left the Bible said he
[7:20] ascended on high but he gave gifts unto
[7:22] men and if we can get into the will of
[7:24] God if we can get under the anointing of
[7:26] God God's gifts will operate for us
[7:28] praise God but we have to have pure
[7:30] hearts as well the preacher the gifted
[7:32] one or the gifted sister sisters can
[7:34] have all nine gifts but they've got to
[7:36] have pure hearts we've got to have pure
[7:38] hearts and then the gifts of God can
[7:40] operate praise God the word Charisma the
[7:42] gift of God hallelujah the power of God
[7:44] Amen God wants them use them Hallelujah
[7:47] so we must be ready so God can use us
[7:49] hallelujah so uh Simon was an enchanter
[7:53] he tormented people right he he brought
[7:55] vexations upon the whole city he would
[7:57] bring fear upon the whole city but
[7:59] Phillip always told the good news of
[8:01] Christ what a difference amen hallelujah
[8:04] what a difference you know that's what
[8:05] we should have tonight the good news of
[8:07] Jesus Hallelujah Jesus Lives Hallelujah
[8:09] he's here he's here to minister to us
[8:12] hallelujah he's here to forgive us
[8:13] hallelujah if we're in sin if we're
[8:15] discouraged or depressed he's here to
[8:16] lift us out of that
[8:18] Hallelujah he's here to give us hope
[8:21] Hallelujah but see Simon worked under
[8:23] fear and enchanting people and he made
[8:27] himself that he was great one right he
[8:28] made himself a great one but God made
[8:30] Phillip a great one is that right church
[8:34] right real real preachers real men and
[8:35] women of God Don't Make themselves great
[8:37] Paul said I was the least of the
[8:39] Apostles and then he said I was the
[8:40] least of the Saints that's a real man of
[8:43] God right there and yet we believe he
[8:44] was the greatest the greatest New
[8:45] Testament I believe he was the greatest
[8:47] New Testament believer because of all
[8:49] his sacrifices all his sufferings for
[8:52] Christ Hallelujah his whole resume of
[8:54] suffering we've been through that many
[8:55] times but look at this uh example of
[8:58] Philip he's used by God so Simon
[9:01] Bewitched the people but Phillip
[9:04] liberated the people that's what I love
[9:06] about Jesus you can come in here in any
[9:08] condition whatever the awful condition
[9:09] but you can leave out of here free
[9:11] Hallelujah I've I've come in here sick
[9:13] I've left out well amen I've come in
[9:16] here tired I left out uh rejoicing and
[9:18] full of the joy of the Lord amen you
[9:21] name it Hallelujah you name it any
[9:22] negative emotion you bring in you can be
[9:25] free of it and you can walk out of here
[9:26] feeling like you're brand new Hallelujah
[9:29] I tell you since brother Dennis came and
[9:31] preach on secret sins I've been living
[9:33] in so much Victory I want to tell you
[9:35] that I have just been noticing wow the
[9:38] God has God has raised me up a step by
[9:41] God's grace I've noticed it in my life
[9:43] Hallelujah and church is that what God
[9:45] does he sends his word to heal the
[9:47] people amen the Bible said God sent his
[9:49] word and it healed them
[9:52] Hallelujah I I love how Jesus does it
[9:54] praise God it's always the right place
[9:56] at the right time hallelujah amen
[9:59] Simon was under the power of Satan of
[10:01] course uh philli was under the power of
[10:04] Christ Simon was the power and kingdom
[10:07] of darkness and Philip was the Kingdom
[10:09] of Light Hallelujah Simon was full of
[10:12] evil spirits but philli was full of the
[10:14] Holy Ghost amen how many appreciate that
[10:17] by God's grace amen oh what a blessing
[10:20] amen now like verse 25 I'm going to read
[10:23] that again and they when they had
[10:25] testified and preached the word of the
[10:27] Lord returned to Jerusalem and preach
[10:29] the gospel in many villages of the
[10:33] Samaritans and I just thought that was a
[10:35] good did you notice that phrase
[10:37] testified and
[10:40] preached you know this is what I found
[10:42] as a minister I've been preaching for 20
[10:44] years right I found my when when God
[10:47] uses my sermons the most it's when I
[10:49] preach the word which means declare I
[10:52] publish the good news but then I give
[10:54] testimonies about what I've seen God
[10:56] do right because what good is it just a
[10:59] to talk about well God can God can God
[11:01] wants somebody who can also say I'm a
[11:03] testimony I've seen it myself hallelujah
[11:07] hallelujah see that the apostles just
[11:10] didn't say well let's preach preach
[11:11] preach preach preach they also gave
[11:13] testimony that's why it's so important
[11:15] for you and I to give
[11:16] testimonies tell somebody what God has
[11:19] done for you lately don't be ashamed of
[11:21] it we right just bring up his name
[11:23] you'll find when you bring up his name
[11:25] the atmosphere will change Hallelujah
[11:27] testify about what he's done hallelujah
[11:30] declare it yes and as as ministers we
[11:33] preach we declare the word of God we
[11:34] teach the word of God but each one of us
[11:37] can give testimony and that's how the
[11:39] Holy Ghost moves people just don't want
[11:41] to know about God you know the
[11:42] historical God they want to see the
[11:44] living Christ hallelujah amen glory to
[11:48] God Amen I'm saying Amen to the word of
[11:50] God hallelujah we always got to have
[11:52] both praise God testimonies and
[11:55] preaching
[11:57] Hallelujah and also I was studying and I
[11:59] found this thought too this a really
[12:00] good thought in this chapter Peter and
[12:03] John call down the fire of the Holy
[12:06] Ghost on Samaritans these are half Jew
[12:09] half
[12:10] Gentile so you know we we know there was
[12:13] there was this this discrimination right
[12:15] like the woman at the well in John
[12:17] chapter 4 there was always this
[12:18] discrimination Jews were more holier
[12:20] than than Samaritans because Samaritans
[12:22] were half Jew and half Gentile right
[12:25] there was always this uh the segregation
[12:28] and well you're not as holy as us you're
[12:30] not as holy as us you know remember
[12:31] Peter battled that later in Galatians
[12:33] Chapter 2 he battled that segregation
[12:35] sphere right that we're better the
[12:37] prideful thing or the for him it might
[12:38] have been fear of the Jewish teachers
[12:40] the fear thing but you know it's really
[12:42] interesting here that that that Peter
[12:44] and John now that they got the Holy
[12:46] Ghost they're sent there to a people
[12:49] that normally they wouldn't associate
[12:51] with but Hallelujah but there's Peter
[12:53] with the keys to the kingdom hallelujah
[12:55] amen Peter had already unlocked the
[12:57] kingdom to the Jews on the day of
[12:58] Pentecost we here he comes opening the
[13:01] the the kingdom of God with the door of
[13:04] knowledge I'm sorry the key of knowledge
[13:05] the Bible said Christ is the door
[13:07] Hallelujah but Jesus said it's a key of
[13:09] knowledge now Peter comes and opens it
[13:11] up to another another people the the
[13:14] Samaritans Hallelujah and now he's
[13:16] calling down the Holy Ghost upon the
[13:18] people oh what a what a desire church we
[13:21] should have that desire let your Holy
[13:23] Spirit fall Lord fall in this place
[13:26] Hallelujah fall in my home fall on the
[13:28] job follow my children follow my parents
[13:31] let the Holy Ghost fall Hallelujah now
[13:33] the reason that's so awesome is because
[13:36] earlier before they got the Holy Ghost
[13:37] in Luke chapter nine James and John were
[13:40] trying to call fire down from heaven to
[13:42] destroy people and the church said look
[13:45] at the difference between someone who's
[13:47] born again and someone who's not born
[13:49] again my goodness hallelujah what a
[13:50] difference someone who's not born again
[13:52] will want to call Fire And judgment and
[13:54] these people need destroyed these people
[13:56] need wiped out the Earth but now that
[13:57] they' got the Holy Ghost those they're
[13:59] called say God send us a different fire
[14:01] send us a holy fire send us a fire that
[14:04] brings joy unspeakable and full of
[14:07] glory amen look at that a different kind
[14:10] of fire they want to fall that's what we
[14:13] want to fall Amen Let the Holy Ghost
[14:16] fall hallelujah amen hallelujah oh I
[14:19] love it praise
[14:20] God now they're calling down for the
[14:22] fire of the Holy Ghost of fall that's
[14:24] what every Christian should desire
[14:26] that's why we should live our lives in
[14:28] such a way that the Holy Ghost can fall
[14:30] praise God that's the kind of life we
[14:32] want to live where the Holy Ghost can
[14:35] fall think about that when was the last
[14:37] time you felt like it
[14:39] fell now I can't think of it like recent
[14:41] times I'm sure it has but I know for
[14:43] sure in in Napoleon it fell right you
[14:45] just felt a change when we had the
[14:47] service about almost a year ago back in
[14:49] April I just felt something fall it just
[14:51] it just broke forth It's Like A rushian
[14:54] Mighty Wind came into that church right
[14:57] hallelujah it's like like a it's like
[14:59] living it's like a artisian well sprung
[15:02] up and all the joy and the worship and
[15:05] then the sighing and the crying and the
[15:06] repenting and the crying out to God
[15:08] hallelujah it just that's how the Holy
[15:10] Ghost operates praise God and no man
[15:12] like Simon can take control of that God
[15:14] moves the wind blows when God wants it
[15:16] to blow Hallelujah but we should live in
[15:19] a condition where the Holy Ghost can
[15:21] fall praise God it only takes two or
[15:24] three because Jesus said wherever two or
[15:25] three are there I am in the midst praise
[15:27] God Oh Glory Hallelujah now acts 826 we
[15:32] read
[15:33] 26 this is just a wonderful thought here
[15:37] a Phillip here is called to leave we'd
[15:40] say the Revival a Citywide Revival the
[15:44] Holy Ghost says I want you to leave this
[15:46] revival and go go south to the desert
[15:50] now think about this he's in a city the
[15:52] Samaritan cities he's got all the water
[15:54] he needs he can probably go down the
[15:56] market and he can buy whatever he wants
[15:57] right here and the Holy Ghost says I
[15:59] want you to leave here and he's he's
[16:01] seeing people saved and baptized and
[16:03] filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[16:05] Ghost saysi want you to leave this city
[16:06] now he could have said no how many know
[16:09] prophets sometimes disobey the word of
[16:10] God now Philip wasn't a prophet he was
[16:12] an evangelist right but how many know
[16:15] sometimes prophets disobey God's word
[16:17] right Jonah disobeyed thus sayith the
[16:19] Lord Abraham disobeyed thus sayith the
[16:21] Lord he said don't take any Kindred he
[16:23] took lot with
[16:24] him sometimes we disobey thus sayith the
[16:27] Lord right sometimes we dis disobey the
[16:28] word of God but look how humble Philip
[16:31] is I'll leave the Revival Lord and I'll
[16:34] I'll go down into the desert I love this
[16:36] he was so humble Lord if you want me to
[16:38] leave uh if you want me to leave this
[16:40] revival I'm not interested in numbers I
[16:42] just want to do the will of God I I'll
[16:45] go to a place where I don't have
[16:46] anything where I'm just out in the
[16:48] desert I'll go wherever you want me to
[16:49] go Lord I'll leave wherever you want me
[16:51] to go just let me know I've got thus
[16:53] sayith the Lord amen what a humble
[16:56] servant now for us it might be like
[16:58] leaving a big church they go to a small
[17:00] church right it might be something like
[17:03] that where you know looks like
[17:05] everything's going good the Revival's
[17:06] going good and the Holy Ghost would call
[17:08] you away now remember according to
[17:09] scripture we don't know if we ever came
[17:10] back to
[17:12] Samaria right because after this he goes
[17:14] up to cesaria if I'm not mistaken after
[17:16] he goes down to uh down south
[17:19] there uh and then to the desert and then
[17:21] he goes to cesaria after that we don't
[17:23] know exactly if he ever went back to the
[17:24] Revival but church we got to be willing
[17:26] to follow the leadership of the the Holy
[17:28] Spirit would you follow Christ into a
[17:30] desert guess where the Holy Ghost LED
[17:32] Jesus after after he got the Holy Ghost
[17:35] into the
[17:37] desert right you would think oh he's
[17:39] filled with the Holy Ghost when he got
[17:40] baptized that's what the Bible said the
[17:42] Holy Ghost is sent and remain but then
[17:43] the Holy Ghost didn't lead him out other
[17:45] places you know to he actually sent him
[17:47] into a time of
[17:49] testing right so we see that the Holy
[17:51] Ghost can fall and then it can lead you
[17:54] to a test kind of unexpected but we got
[17:58] to be be willing to follow the voice of
[18:00] the
[18:01] Lord how do you know it's the voice of
[18:03] the lord well you better pray and seek
[18:04] God's face you better make sure and the
[18:07] church said you better make sure we've
[18:09] seen a lot of people I've seen a lot of
[18:11] people as Pastor told me the Lord told
[18:13] him to do things and turned out the Lord
[18:15] didn't tell him to do that because it
[18:16] breaks the word of God God will not tell
[18:18] you to break the word of God like stop
[18:21] going to church stop paying ties marry a
[18:24] sinner the Bible don't say to do those
[18:26] things right but they can tell me
[18:28] whatever they want all you can do is
[18:30] tell them the truth and and ask that God
[18:32] would reveal to them that they need to
[18:34] follow the voice of God from the
[18:36] scripture but also if any voice is
[18:38] scriptural let's follow that voice it's
[18:40] God's voice amen but it's this testing
[18:43] time Hallelujah and so Philip gets
[18:45] called he's called to leave the great
[18:48] crowds and the great blessings now you
[18:51] would think wow Philip would be saying
[18:54] man look at all the fruits of all my
[18:55] ministry right wow finally I I've I've
[18:59] served the Lord I've Loved God all my
[19:01] life I'm seen all these fruits and then
[19:03] God asked me to leave the place where
[19:04] I'm so fruitful but God God was gon to
[19:07] do something greater church God was G to
[19:09] do something greater than just one city
[19:11] God was going to a whole nation
[19:13] Hallelujah everybody know the end of the
[19:15] story praise God Hallelujah the
[19:18] Ethiopian unic anybody know that story
[19:21] glory amen God was doing something but
[19:24] he still had to be obedient to the voice
[19:27] of the Lord
[19:30] Hallelujah he's called to the desert and
[19:33] he's called not to a Revival he's called
[19:36] to One
[19:39] Soul so this tells us Christ is
[19:42] concerned with the
[19:45] individuals Hallelujah yes he wants to
[19:47] see big revivals and big crowds and lots
[19:49] of healing and lots of Deliverance he
[19:51] wants to see that but he's not done
[19:53] hallelujah praise God he's got more
[19:55] souls there must let me say it Church
[19:57] there must be a fullness of the Gentiles
[20:00] before God can go back to the Jews we
[20:02] need more Gentiles to be filled with the
[20:04] Holy Ghost amen we're not going anywhere
[20:07] to the fullness every seat of God in
[20:10] heaven at the marage supper lamb has a
[20:12] soul that's ready for it praise God
[20:14] we're not going anywhere praise God and
[20:17] so Philip was was able to tap into that
[20:20] and be led by the holy spirit away from
[20:22] all this fruit we'd say and all this all
[20:24] this excitement and joy so he can
[20:26] minister to One Soul
[20:30] hallelujah it's a blessing my God is
[20:32] concerned with both the crowds and the
[20:36] individuals didn't the Bible say he
[20:37] never leave us nor forsake us the church
[20:40] said didn't the Bible say there's a
[20:42] friend that sticks closer than your
[20:44] closest friend right can I just
[20:46] paraphrase that than a brother you have
[20:49] a friend that's closer than your closest
[20:51] friend and that's Christ and think about
[20:54] this Christ thought so much about that
[20:56] unic that he hold the preacher away from
[20:59] his
[21:00] Revival he'd put all the seeds brother
[21:02] he'd sewed all those seeds and he wasn't
[21:05] going to see the end of that wow brother
[21:07] just I put so much in this and God's
[21:09] asking me to leave it sometimes he
[21:12] does sometimes he does this really shows
[21:15] how he wasn't a selfish person he was a
[21:18] humble person you know some some
[21:20] preachers especially we see with
[21:21] preachers they'll grasp on oh this is my
[21:23] Ministry and this is my work and I've
[21:25] done this and they would never be able
[21:27] to let go and say well somebody God has
[21:29] somebody else for this right
[21:32] church or it could be a song leader you
[21:34] know I'm not make I'm not preach on on
[21:36] Amen but I'm just saying you know
[21:38] because it's me too I could I could hang
[21:39] on this no one will ever preach here
[21:40] again but
[21:42] me or Malai on the piano you know people
[21:45] can get so attached to what they feel
[21:48] like they've invested in that they
[21:50] wouldn't even let it go and say well
[21:51] maybe go I feel God calling me to do
[21:53] something
[21:55] else and not realizing if God calls you
[21:58] away from it he's going to take you to
[21:59] something greater right either home to
[22:02] Glory if you go to the Grave or in this
[22:04] case going to take him to more souls he
[22:06] can have a broader impact amen
[22:08] hallelujah Glory that's what Jesus said
[22:10] if I give you five tals you make it 10
[22:13] Hallelujah that's what here that's what
[22:14] Phillip does Amen he's able to follow
[22:17] that and now he can have more impact
[22:18] than just one city he can impact the
[22:20] entire nation of Ethiopia oh my
[22:26] Hallelujah so this is what it takes it
[22:28] takes a spiritual maturity to be able to
[22:30] accept the word of
[22:32] God and God's current perfect will for
[22:35] your life how going to live in the
[22:36] perfect will of God I do not want to be
[22:39] in the permissive will of God I don't
[22:41] want to be a Jonah running and getting
[22:43] spanked all over creation or all over
[22:45] the all over the ocean or whatever it
[22:47] may be all over Aran I don't want to do
[22:50] that I want to do what God has told me
[22:53] to do how do you know it the Bible said
[22:56] he'll put it in your heart amen I was
[22:58] just reading down to that numerous times
[22:59] in the Old Testament this week the Bible
[23:01] said God put it in the heart of Moses
[23:04] God put it in the heart of Ezra amen God
[23:06] put it in the heart of zerubabel God put
[23:09] that in their hearts in other words
[23:11] God's going to put something in your
[23:12] heart and only you can do it praise God
[23:15] but you got to take that to the word of
[23:17] God and make sure it is the calling of
[23:19] God hallelujah but we got that great
[23:21] confidence the elect will not be
[23:23] deceived like Jesus said it could be so
[23:26] close if it were possible the elect
[23:28] could be deceived but it's not possible
[23:29] to deceive the very elect you ever see
[23:32] Paul deceived no
[23:34] sir Hallelujah you ever see Peter
[23:36] deceived after he got the Holy Ghost
[23:38] well he actually he did fall one time so
[23:41] I better better be careful on that one
[23:43] it won't last for a long time I'll say I
[23:45] say they won't be permanently deceived
[23:47] that's how I should say that Hallelujah
[23:50] yeah we'll go through little tests and
[23:51] trials
[23:52] amen but they'll always know Christ is
[23:55] the the way Christ is the truth Christ
[23:57] is the life hallelujah amen so Christ is
[24:00] concerned in all these things and he
[24:02] goes down to verse 27 he rose and went
[24:04] and behold a man of Ethiopia and unic so
[24:06] he was a single man a celibate man of
[24:09] great Authority this was not just a
[24:11] common
[24:13] person he had great Authority Under
[24:16] Candice the queen of Ethiopia having
[24:19] charge of all her treasure this is a guy
[24:22] that knew how to handle
[24:23] money right that Queen wouldn't put
[24:25] somebody there that's a little fishy on
[24:27] money
[24:28] don't make the right deals don't you
[24:30] know don't put money in the right places
[24:32] Queen ain't going to choose somebody
[24:33] like that that's her
[24:35] treasury right he's a man that could be
[24:38] trusted with money May God help us all
[24:39] to be like that Hallelujah God can trust
[24:42] us with his
[24:43] resources saying a man who's just got
[24:45] he's got a small little influence this
[24:48] man has control over the whole Kingdom's
[24:50] Finance remind you of anybody
[24:53] Joseph Joseph Daniel the three Hebrew
[24:57] children children these men of great
[24:59] political
[25:01] influence right somebody asked me that
[25:03] this week could should a Christian be in
[25:04] politics I said only if God calls you
[25:07] right because it corrupts most people
[25:09] because they don't have the spirit that
[25:11] Daniel has amen hallelujah if you got
[25:13] the spirit of Daniel you'll be able to
[25:14] separate from all the things of Babylon
[25:17] Hallelujah and you'll get persecuted but
[25:19] you'll overcome because you know you're
[25:21] God
[25:24] hallelujah not something you just jump
[25:26] into you got to be LED if you go into
[25:28] politics but very few people I imagine
[25:31] God has to have somebody in there right
[25:32] but very few people probably will say
[25:34] true that's why God doesn't call a lot
[25:36] of people into that but here this
[25:39] Ethiopian has great Authority charge of
[25:42] all the
[25:43] treasury man and he come to Jerusalem
[25:46] for to worship anybody know how many
[25:48] miles he traveled to get
[25:50] there
[25:53] 1,598 about almost 1600 miles
[25:58] and I looked it up if you and I got in
[26:00] the car today well my wife and I should
[26:02] say and if we drove to Juno Alaska by
[26:06] car that'd be about that that one trip
[26:09] would be about the uh the round trip for
[26:12] the Ethiopian unic to get up to
[26:14] Jerusalem and back to Ethiopia imagine
[26:16] driving up to Alaska who wants to go on
[26:18] a road trip sleep in the
[26:21] car that's a huge distance and they
[26:24] didn't have air conditioning Cadillacs
[26:26] like we got today
[26:29] this this man look at this man this was
[26:32] a a Godly
[26:34] Man and church just goes to show this if
[26:37] you make a sacrifice God is going to
[26:39] honor you now the prosperity preachers
[26:41] always got well I hear the Lord telling
[26:43] me give me a thousand tonight
[26:47] nonsense and yet then they're doing
[26:49] drugs behind the scenes and all kinds of
[26:50] nonsense
[26:52] nonsense right I'm talking about look at
[26:54] this look at the sacrifice of a travel
[26:56] reminds us of the queen Queen of the
[26:58] South and she can't like what brother
[27:00] says she came ready to support it if
[27:03] God's in it I'm going to go find out I
[27:04] don't know but if God's in it I'm GNA be
[27:06] ready to support it hallelujah amen I'm
[27:10] going to support the gift of God if
[27:11] there's a gift of God I'm going to go
[27:13] check it out if there's a real gift of
[27:14] God and God answers my questions and God
[27:17] serves my soul then I'm going to support
[27:19] it with all I got Hallelujah that's how
[27:21] my wife and I came the
[27:23] message we came with our stack of
[27:25] printouts and what's these are all the
[27:27] attack against brother Bram show me
[27:29] where it's wrong and he just had to go
[27:30] to the first few page I'm like yes
[27:31] they're misquoting brother BR yes
[27:33] brother Braham grew in understanding and
[27:35] they're all just slanderous attacks
[27:37] brother wasn't perfect but he was a true
[27:39] Christian praise God he was Washed by
[27:42] the blood of Christ Hallelujah Church
[27:44] listen to him preach you don't hear any
[27:46] hardly anybody preach like that today
[27:48] such a man so in love with Jesus Christ
[27:50] and such living such a sacrificial life
[27:52] but that's what we need this this desire
[27:55] like the the unic like the queen of the
[27:57] South Lord I don't know if it's you but
[27:59] Lord if it's you I'm ready to support it
[28:01] with everything that I've got amen and
[28:05] God will honor somebody that makes a
[28:06] sacrifice like that
[28:11] Hallelujah such an amazing sacrifice
[28:14] this was not a guy who played
[28:18] church I'm willing to drive 1600 Miles
[28:21] by horse
[28:23] carriage boy it's been a couple years
[28:25] since we rode in a horse carriage that
[28:26] wasn't very comfortable even on the
[28:27] roads we had right over there in
[28:30] Pennsylvania a couple yeah a couple
[28:31] summers ago we all rode our that I
[28:33] wasn't enjoying that very
[28:35] much but you read later he was while he
[28:38] was writing he was reading the
[28:40] scriptures out loud and the church said
[28:43] oh come on jch in other words he was
[28:45] just all about the word I'll go to any
[28:48] distance I'm Gonna Fill my life with the
[28:50] word of God I'm gonna let the word of
[28:52] God be nigh even in my mouth hallelujah
[28:55] amen take a hard trip let's read the
[28:58] word of God you're sick let's sing to
[29:01] God hallelujah put on some worship music
[29:03] amen going through a hard time let's
[29:05] give God praise Hallelujah let's worship
[29:08] god let's got the Bible somebody just
[29:09] read the Bible somebody just call Jesus
[29:11] on the scene Hallelujah Glory that's
[29:15] what this guy did no doubt they didn't
[29:17] have paved roads right or anything that
[29:19] would we' resemble today's roads we know
[29:21] all roads lead to Rome you know but they
[29:24] surely weren't as nice as they are today
[29:26] and yet when Philip comes on him he
[29:28] hears him reading the
[29:31] scripture that's a good sign a man is
[29:33] hungry for the word of God he's reading
[29:35] the scripture everybody read your Bibles
[29:37] this morning you don't have to say Amen
[29:38] you can say ouch if you
[29:40] didn't
[29:42] hallelujah we're not all perfect but we
[29:44] want to make this uh a a constant
[29:47] seeking he come almost 1600 miles this
[29:51] shows he had a real heart for
[29:53] God he wanted the true God hallelujah
[29:57] like brother Ram said with the queen of
[29:59] the South he wanted something that could
[30:00] speak back to him amen all those Idols
[30:03] of the Ethiopia all the idols of the
[30:05] queen of South they couldn't speak back
[30:07] she seen there's nothing to it she
[30:09] wanted a God that could speak back and
[30:11] how do you know God was speaking to her
[30:12] she knew because my thoughts and intents
[30:14] and my hearts were being discerned my
[30:17] secrets were being exposed I knew God
[30:19] was there because nobody knows my heart
[30:21] except the one who made my heart and
[30:24] that's Jesus hallelujah amen hallelujah
[30:27] that's how I know when I come to this
[30:29] message the brother brandom and this
[30:30] bible-based message all my questions
[30:32] were answered Hallelujah all the fog and
[30:35] all the mystery of uh I was raised in
[30:37] Assembly of God brother uh all the
[30:39] Assembly of God questions I had and then
[30:41] I went to the Baptist church and then
[30:42] all my Baptist questions were answered
[30:44] amen just within a matter of a few
[30:47] sermons from brother brandham and where
[30:49] were the answers in the Bible they were
[30:52] already laying there in the Bible about
[30:54] our tongues the evidence well of course
[30:56] Paul said do all speak with tongues of
[30:58] course not you know the question of how
[31:02] can how can somebody uh do gifts of God
[31:05] and then Jesus in Matthew 7 says I never
[31:07] knew you depart from me the work
[31:08] iniquity and then brother R takes us
[31:10] back to balum the same thing you can
[31:12] temporarily have the anointing but later
[31:14] reject the anointing and be
[31:17] lost Jesus said I'll blot your name out
[31:20] Revelation 3 verse five I don't know why
[31:22] that verse has been on my heart these
[31:23] last few weeks but he said if you don't
[31:24] overcome I'll blot your name out
[31:28] you think Jesus is lying or telling some
[31:30] uh some great Fable story of course not
[31:33] Peter says God doesn't give us fables
[31:35] amen he gave us a more sure word of
[31:37] Prophecy hallelujah amen it's a more
[31:41] sure word
[31:44] hallelujah what a man what what a Godly
[31:47] Man here my church you know see this you
[31:51] know if he goes back and now he's been
[31:54] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:56] Christ who's going to notice that
[32:00] Queen Hallelujah she's GNA come and say
[32:03] uh Mr Unix sir uh can you give us the
[32:05] daily update on the finances he's say
[32:08] glory to

[32:12] morning praying can I give can I just
[32:14] give you a testimony right after the the
[32:16] financial update tell you about all your
[32:18] interest and everything after that can I
[32:20] give you little testimony I met a
[32:21] preacher Hallelujah his name was maybe
[32:24] maybe he didn't get his name it was such
[32:26] a such a a short meeting
[32:28] there
[32:29] amen and then who's that Queen going to
[32:32] influence the queen or king of an entire
[32:35] land I think they're gonna have a pretty
[32:36] big influence don't
[32:38] you oh man I gotta go research more on
[32:40] the history of that but look God takes
[32:42] philli away from one city and then takes
[32:44] him to this man of authority over an
[32:46] entire nation God knows what he's doing
[32:50] because Jesus said you go and preach to
[32:52] every
[32:53] nation and we still haven't done it yet
[32:55] right internet that's helping out by
[32:57] God's grace but we need people to go
[33:00] there and demonstrate the power of God
[33:03] to show them that Jesus Christ is the
[33:05] same yesterday today and forever not
[33:07] just preach but testify
[33:10] hallelujah amen like I told you that one
[33:13] time I was preaching those young people
[33:15] there in Guyana South South
[33:18] America I I didn't know I was going to
[33:20] preach a youth meeting but I just felt
[33:22] the power of the Holy Ghost that morning
[33:24] and I said if God doesn't vindicate this
[33:25] message then I'm a false preacher or not
[33:27] when it was the last time you heard a
[33:28] preacher say that I didn't plan to say
[33:30] it that day it just came out I was 90
[33:33] degrees I'm sweating you know I'm loving
[33:34] it you know I just love preaching you
[33:36] know I said if God don't vindicate this
[33:39] I'm I'm a false preacher and then I I
[33:41] ended with the altar call said now who
[33:43] wants to be baptized I'll run down there
[33:45] I'll be the first one down there and we
[33:48] had 20 baptisms that morning and God God
[33:51] even had the pastor son he's getting
[33:53] married this year the pastor's son was
[33:54] the first one to be baptized amen
[33:57] Hallelujah he ran from God rebelled
[33:59] against God and there God softens his
[34:01] heart praise God
[34:02] Amen
[34:06] Hallelujah this man was a worshipper now
[34:09] this is awesome I read this in uh have
[34:10] you ever heard of Kevin Connor he he
[34:12] died he's from okay he was from
[34:14] Australia he's a good Pentecostal
[34:15] teacher boy he is a quite a
[34:18] teacher I have a book of him on the
[34:20] Feast of Israel if you want a copy let
[34:21] me know
[34:23] brother it's so in depth but anyways he
[34:26] said said what had the unic found he was
[34:30] coming back home to Ethiopia from
[34:32] Jerusalem did you I I never really
[34:34] caught that from the text he was leaving
[34:36] Jerusalem after worshiping
[34:38] there but what what did he leave he left
[34:41] the
[34:42] Pharisees
[34:44] ritualism form
[34:47] ceremony traditions of men and Jesus
[34:50] said they're in
[34:53] vain unbelief spiritual deadness

[35:54] how many years you ran from him God God
[35:57] knew eventually you'd you'd repent you
[35:59] start following him and that's why God
[36:01] never took his Blessing off your life

[36:08] home maybe he's on his uh 2,000th
[36:14] Mile and he's just reading Isaiah
[36:17] 535 he was wounded for our
[36:20] transgressions he was bruised for our
[36:23] iniquities all of a sudden Philip's like
[36:25] somebody's talking about me my
[36:27] Jesus
[36:29] Hallelujah and God's like I'm not going
[36:31] to let this unic I'm not going to let
[36:33] him travel all those miles I'm not g to
[36:35] let him get all that sacrifice and not
[36:37] reward my
[36:39] son you would think he might have been
[36:42] disappointed right the devil for have
[36:43] fought him you made all this trip and
[36:45] it's just a bunch of dead religion Tre
[36:48] Creeds and traditions of
[36:50] men but look he didn't give up God knew
[36:53] he was a faithful Saint God knew there
[36:56] was nothing that was going to turn this
[36:57] guy away if you want to know God there's
[37:00] nothing that's going to stop you
[37:01] Hallelujah from finding him amen you'll
[37:03] wait like Abraham you might have wait 25
[37:06] years amen you waited 25 years for Isaac
[37:09] if you really believe you'll wait your
[37:10] whole life
[37:12] Hallelujah and then God will show
[37:14] himself alive to you that's what
[37:16] happened to this man this great
[37:18] sacrifice he doesn't give up he knows I
[37:21] know there's something real about God
[37:24] these men aren't manifesting it and so
[37:26] he goes looking he he goes there he sees
[37:28] this big crowd and look what he look you
[37:30] know he thinks he's going to find God in
[37:31] this big crowd but where does he find
[37:33] God in one little
[37:35] evangelist and said this one little
[37:38] halfwit preacher and said that because
[37:40] he wasn't accepted by the main the main
[37:42] group maybe he spit and slobbered like I
[37:45] do I don't
[37:46] know but he sure wasn't the popular
[37:48] preacher they had those they had the
[37:50] veres they had them and one man God used
[37:54] one man I love this this man the Unix
[37:57] reading the word and this man has just
[37:59] been the Living Word he's been preaching
[38:01] the Living
[38:02] Word I love this God is working on both
[38:05] ends this guy's meditating on the word
[38:08] this guy's got the Living Word he's got
[38:10] the word of the hour he's got the
[38:12] message of the hour and the church said
[38:15] he's got the revelation of the hour and
[38:19] God brings one who's hungry for it but
[38:20] hasn't found it to one who's found it
[38:24] and God brings it to him
[38:27] remember there's two parables in one of
[38:29] The Parables the man is looking for
[38:31] pearls and he finds the greatest Pearl
[38:34] that's if you're like looking for the
[38:36] truth right but the other one the man he
[38:38] he finds the treasure in a field maybe
[38:40] tripped over the the treasure trunk in
[38:42] the field he said I'm gonna go by this
[38:43] field I found it by accident right so
[38:47] however your testimony is God's the
[38:49] author of it Hallelujah whether you you
[38:52] were surprised in finding it or whether
[38:54] you were looking for it and you find
[38:55] like Simon Simon was fasted what two
[38:57] months before God showed him this
[38:58] message of brother Randa the bible
[39:01] message Hallelujah right other people
[39:04] they just kind of they just kind of
[39:06] stumble on it you know kind like me it
[39:08] just kind of I wasn't really looking for
[39:09] it I was you know I knew there was
[39:11] something more but I wasn't praying in
[39:13] my closet fasting for more of God like
[39:16] that and I just kind of stumbled upon it
[39:19] thanks to brother Simon praise God
[39:21] hallelujah is that that's beautiful
[39:23] Church your story is going to have a
[39:25] special testimony to
[39:27] it
[39:29] Hallelujah and God is drawing you to
[39:32] himself praise God so you just have to
[39:36] keep seeking after God right we have to
[39:37] keep seeking after
[39:39] God and as he reads the scripture he
[39:41] doesn't understand he's reading Isaiah
[39:44] the prophet verse 29 then the spirit
[39:46] said unto Philip go near and join
[39:48] thyself to The Chariot we just read last
[39:50] week they that are sons of God are led
[39:53] by the spirit of
[39:55] God see right we got to be led to do
[39:58] things I feel God leading me to go to
[40:01] this
[40:01] person right I feel God leading me to
[40:04] pray for that person we must be led by
[40:07] the spirit of
[40:09] God see that and he says Phillip ran
[40:12] thither look he was in a big hurry he's
[40:15] running and he heard him read the
[40:17] prophet Isaiah so he's reading out loud
[40:19] in his Chariot kind of be like you and I
[40:21] somebody driving down the road they got
[40:22] Jesus music on you know or listen to
[40:25] their Bible app and hey praise the Lord
[40:27] like Austin had that Christian chain on
[40:29] right and he got to talk to a friend
[40:31] today Austin invited somebody to church
[40:33] today and he had that the chain of the
[40:35] cross on and that's what opened up the
[40:36] conversation kind of like my Jesus hat
[40:38] that brother forget that brother's name
[40:40] now MJ yeah MJ MJ saw that Jesus hey do
[40:44] you you serve Jesus oh yeah I serve
[40:47] Jesus hallelujah amen I love Jesus but
[40:50] he's reading it
[40:51] aloud and then Philip runs and says
[40:54] understandest Thou what thou readest and
[40:56] he said how can I accept some man should
[40:59] guide me now Look at look how humble
[41:00] this guy is he's not like you know I'm a
[41:03] great Authority I don't need somebody to
[41:04] teach me that's a lot of message people
[41:06] today I don't need a preacher I don't
[41:09] need I can just understand it myself
[41:12] look how humble he was he's willing to
[41:14] go 1600 miles one way he's reads the
[41:17] Bible out loud meditating on the word of
[41:19] God and then he says I need God to send
[41:22] me a man to teach me the word of
[41:25] God is that how you feel too you want
[41:28] somebody to tell you the scriptures
[41:29] praise God that's the that's the Bible
[41:31] Way didn't Paul didn't Peter say this is
[41:34] that which Joel spoke of right telling
[41:37] you what the word of God says
[41:40] hallelujah oh my it's
[41:43] beautiful see and I love this thought
[41:45] too this brother Connor brings this up
[41:47] he was still reading the scripture
[41:49] though he understood not the word he
[41:52] still read it if you don't understand
[41:55] God's word keep reading
[41:57] it don't say I'll never understand this
[42:00] or I'll never get it just keep reading
[42:02] praise God one of these days that
[42:04] Bible's going to open up hallelujah amen
[42:07] like it did for many of us I'm talking
[42:09] about for further Revelation just keep
[42:11] reading it will open up God's book is
[42:13] always unfolding praise
[42:16] God
[42:18] Amen it shows a heart that's really
[42:20] hungry for God and church that proves
[42:22] you have a pure heart when you seek God
[42:24] even when you don't feel nothing you
[42:26] seek God even when you're disappointed
[42:28] that proves you really love God no doubt
[42:31] he was disappointed who wouldn't be go
[42:33] up and see a a bunch of den of Thieves
[42:36] he went all the way to make a sacrifice
[42:38] to serve God and he finds a den of
[42:40] Thieves there but he's still reading his
[42:42] Bible on the way
[42:43] home let me just say like this if you
[42:45] ever come to church and you're
[42:47] disappointed go home reading listen to
[42:49] the Bible okay go home and praise God is
[42:53] that right church now hopefully nobody
[42:55] feels that here
[42:58] if you if you ever get disappointed
[43:00] don't give up on God it wasn't God's
[43:03] fault Hallelujah many times what I've
[43:06] seen over these years it's people's
[43:07] fault they don't read the Bible and
[43:08] study themselves enough so they can't
[43:10] grasp what the preacher saying that's
[43:13] what I found right or the Bible says
[43:16] they'll Heap to themselves teachers
[43:19] having itching ears and that heat means
[43:21] to pile up they'll pile up all these
[43:23] false teachings and that's what they
[43:25] want to hear they only compile all the
[43:27] things that tell them what they want to
[43:28] hear these teachers promising them
[43:31] things they never ever get
[43:33] to right they promise themselves Liberty
[43:36] but then they get entangled again in the
[43:38] bondage that they already came out of in
[43:40] other words they get to go back and live
[43:41] their sinful life and still feel like
[43:43] I'm learning from the word of God
[43:44] they're not they're learning how to sin
[43:47] but Jesus wants to wash you in the
[43:49] waters of his word hallelujah amen we
[43:54] don't have itching ears I don't I didn't
[43:55] come here for somebody to itch my ears I
[43:57] came here so my ears could hear what the
[43:59] spirit says to the church tonight amen
[44:03] how many came that way tonight you came
[44:05] and I want the holy you said I want the
[44:07] Holy Spirit to speak to my ears
[44:09] tonight Hallelujah that's how we come to
[44:13] hear the word of God
[44:16] Amen so God's working on both ends he
[44:19] brought the Evangelist and the unic
[44:22] together for an eternal meeting
[44:24] hallelujah amen
[44:27] the spirit went before the word of God
[44:29] so he's got the word he's got the word
[44:30] but God had a somebody somebody who had
[44:32] the spirit to him and this is the point
[44:35] brother Brandon makes brother Brandon
[44:36] says notice God didn't send an angel to
[44:39] the
[44:39] unic God sent a body member of the body
[44:43] of Jesus Christ someone who had the Holy
[44:46] Ghost amen someone who knew the love of
[44:49] God the power of God someone who
[44:51] believed in the Supernatural That's who
[44:53] God said and church that's what the
[44:55] Bible says uh Paul says that God gives
[44:58] preachers to every man that's in the
[45:00] book of Timothy I believe he says the
[45:03] preachers whom God has given to every
[45:05] man so think about that there's
[45:06] preachers all over that that God has
[45:09] sent to them now the question is will
[45:10] you hear the preacher that God send you
[45:13] that's the question we know Jezebel
[45:16] didn't accept her pastor Pastor
[45:19] Elijah right it's a joke he's a prophet
[45:21] he wasn't a pastor but brother BR makes
[45:23] that joke right that ah 's Pastor was
[45:26] actually
[45:28] Elijah and he accused Elijah you're the
[45:30] one that troubles Israel Elijah said
[45:32] nope you're actually the one troubling
[45:33] Israel the devil always accuses you of
[45:35] what he's he's guilty of
[45:37] right right you're the one that's
[45:40] troubling Israel and who was right it
[45:43] was Elijah of course but they wouldn't
[45:45] accept the man that God sent to them God
[45:48] help us to receive the the The Men Who
[45:50] preach the word of God to us amen that's
[45:53] right that's the word of God
[45:56] and I love this Philip here and I'm
[45:59] almost done here y it's almost it's
[46:00] almost 8
[46:01] o'clock clock's a busy
[46:04] body and he says how can I understand it
[46:06] except a man guide me see that's what
[46:08] God sends preachers for to guide you in
[46:10] the word of God but you got to have a
[46:12] learner Spirit remember Jesus said he
[46:14] said come and learn of me I'm meek and
[46:16] lowly in heart learn of me well how how
[46:20] can we learn from Jesus today through
[46:21] the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4:11
[46:24] Apostle pastor Prophet teacher
[46:27] evangelist that's how we learn we got to
[46:29] come to church humbling ourselves right
[46:31] I'm talking just in general we got to
[46:33] come humble and ready to receive some
[46:35] instruction from the word of
[46:39] God
[46:43] hallelujah and notice he even invited
[46:46] him in I like that when God opens the
[46:47] door this man is so ready for the word
[46:49] of God he's like come on jump in my
[46:51] chair he's like he wasn't saying hey
[46:53] teach me some new uh uh Financial
[46:55] formulas so I can make some more money
[46:56] on the stock
[46:58] market he say no come tell me about
[47:00] Jesus I've got money I need Jesus money
[47:05] don't fill my soul money don't Satisfy
[47:07] My Soul only Jesus can fill my soul
[47:10] whatever I'm reading about here in
[47:11] Isaiah 53 whoever this Messiah is that's
[47:14] who I need to fill my soul praise God I
[47:16] know the queen I know big people I know
[47:18] big politicians what I need to know is
[47:20] the king of Heaven hallelujah
[47:24] amen
[47:26] my
[47:27] goodness verse 33 or 32 the place of the
[47:30] scripture which he read was this he was
[47:32] led to the Sheep as to the slaughter and
[47:35] like a lamb dumb before a Shear so
[47:38] opened he not his mouth in humiliation
[47:40] his judgment was taken away and who
[47:42] shall declare his generation for his
[47:44] life is taken from the earth and the
[47:46] unic
[47:47] answered uh philli and said I pray thee
[47:49] of whom speaketh the Prophet this of
[47:52] himself or some other man see God given
[47:55] him these good questions see those
[47:58] questions you got church those are good
[48:00] Bible
[48:01] questions God has a man who's got the
[48:03] answer but you got to do what the unic
[48:05] did if you want answers like the unic
[48:07] you got to do what the unic did you got
[48:09] to make a
[48:10] sacrifice Hallelujah you got to show
[48:13] devotion even when others are corrupt
[48:16] Jesus said they were blind leaders of
[48:19] the
[48:20] Blind and they'll both fall in the ditch
[48:22] but even though he saw it he said that's
[48:24] fine they they got to do what they got I
[48:25] do but I'm going to keep searching the
[48:28] scriptures oh we can learn so much how
[48:29] many how many glad you can learn from
[48:31] this gentleman right here I learned a
[48:33] lot from this guy the last few moments
[48:34] here or last few hours I've been
[48:35] studying this it's pretty good by God's
[48:37] grace I'm like my what a
[48:41] man and he
[48:43] says verse 31 then philli opened his
[48:46] mouth I like that look he was listen
[48:48] this this guy was a good listener too
[48:50] let me hear what you have to say he
[48:53] didn't take the floor and just you know
[48:54] just let me talk for first okay share
[48:57] share what's on your heart and maybe the
[48:59] Holy Ghost will give me a word to
[49:01] say amen I traveled all this way but I'm
[49:04] still so patient I'll wait for you to
[49:06] ask me a
[49:12] question the Bible said he opened his
[49:14] mouth and began at the same scripture
[49:16] and preached unto him
[49:18] Paul
[49:20] Peter Peter was a prophet but look what
[49:23] he did he preached to him Jesus
[49:26] that's what we need today people to
[49:27] preach Jesus hallelujah praise God he
[49:31] didn't preach about himself he preached
[49:33] about Jesus now no doubt he probably
[49:35] shared testimonies about what God did in
[49:36] Samaria there right because before they
[49:39] thought well it's only for the Jews
[49:41] remember Jesus told them only go to the
[49:43] house of Israel right Jesus told them
[49:46] but now they're starting to see wow God
[49:47] did this in Samaria he's got half Jew
[49:49] half Gentile and now clearly
[49:52] Gentile right but a Jew of Faith But a G
[49:55] Gentile by
[49:57] birth and now he preaches Jesus to him
[50:00] oh my
[50:03] glory then he says this as they went on
[50:05] their
[50:06] way they came a certain water and the
[50:09] unic said see here's water what doth
[50:11] hinder me to be baptized now what a
[50:13] sermon that
[50:14] was Philip preached all of Isaiah 53
[50:18] Jesus is the Lamb of God he died for
[50:21] your sins and then he goes into I you
[50:23] know I just baptized all these Sam in
[50:26] water and then Peter and James come and
[50:28] the Holy Ghost fell and I was he was
[50:31] casting out all these devils and of
[50:33] course here's a holy man he don't have
[50:34] any devils in him so he's not saying hey
[50:36] cast The Devils out of me he knew where
[50:39] he stood he realized the one thing I
[50:40] need I need to be buried in the name of
[50:43] my savior praise God like Paul said I
[50:45] need to be buried in the name of the
[50:47] crucified
[50:48] one this this Mighty servant this this
[50:51] wonderful servant who gave his life I
[50:53] how do I become identified with him I've
[50:55] listened to your story now why can't I
[50:57] be
[50:58] baptized I just had somebody email me
[51:00] from
[51:01] Africa I don't remember the country but
[51:05] said they said the preacher was so busy
[51:06] he didn't have time to baptize the
[51:08] people because they have so many
[51:09] meetings and setting up all these things
[51:11] so they left that church and went to a
[51:12] place where the preacher said yeah I'll
[51:13] baptize you today and this is the
[51:15] scripture I share with them as soon as
[51:18] that heart is ready now the difference
[51:20] here is that they believe with all their
[51:23] hearts that's the thing this man was
[51:26] already a servant of God look his
[51:28] actions already declared he believed
[51:30] amen all his actions declared I already
[51:33] believe I'm willing to travel 1600 miles
[51:36] one way I'm really will willing to read
[51:38] my Bible in my car of course we wouldn't
[51:41] read while we're driving but he could
[51:44] I'm willing to listen to my Bible in my
[51:45] car I'm hungry for God and his actions
[51:49] everything backed up his actions and
[51:50] Phillip knew here's a man that loves
[51:53] Jesus with all of his heart praise God
[51:55] here's a man that's ready for the
[51:56] message of the hour
[52:01] Hallelujah and as he went on their way
[52:03] yeah he said verse 37 and Philip said if
[52:06] thou believest with all thine heart thou
[52:08] mayest and answered said I believe that
[52:12] Jesus Christ is the Son of God it took
[52:15] one sermon from this guy with the
[52:17] message of the hour to show this man the
[52:20] desire of his heart the Bible said Jesus
[52:22] is the desire of all Nations hey Jesus
[52:25] is Jesus is the desire of Ethiopia you
[52:28] know what America really desires
[52:30] Jesus you know what Africa desires and
[52:33] Australia they desire Jesus he's all of
[52:36] our desire Hallelujah now we know if few
[52:38] will find it right because they love
[52:40] Darkness more than light Jesus says but
[52:42] this is the desire this desire was in
[52:44] his heart and so God he had a deep call
[52:47] to the Deep so God had a deep to
[52:51] respond so church if you ever feel like
[52:54] you're alone don't be discouraged God
[52:55] can send you a
[52:57] Phillip here's a man he's all alone his
[52:59] Chariot he wants the truth for his day
[53:03] God will send it to you just have an
[53:05] open heart be ready to to understand the
[53:09] word of God when it's preached to you
[53:12] amen glory amen I was ready Hallelujah
[53:15] all those years ago in 2001 I was ready
[53:17] for this message Hallelujah I was ready
[53:19] for more of God hallelujah amen I know
[53:21] you felt the same praise God I'm trying
[53:23] to find a place to close
[53:27] all right now notice the Bible
[53:30] says verse 38 and he commanded the
[53:32] charch to stand still and they went both
[53:34] down to the water see this wasn't a
[53:36] sprinkling my Presbyterian friends
[53:38] listening on the lary or my Catholic or
[53:41] Lutheran
[53:42] friends they went into the water and the
[53:45] word baptized means
[53:47] immersion baptismo I think is the Greek
[53:50] word I'm not a Greek scholar I have
[53:52] enough trouble with the
[53:53] English right but he says they went down
[53:55] the water both unich and and Phillip and
[53:57] he baptized him and then what is this
[54:00] man going to do with the Gospel of Jesus
[54:04] Christ see it just needs the gospel just
[54:06] needs put in the right person's
[54:08] hands Hallelujah briyan just told me
[54:11] said brother Jesse he said me and these
[54:12] brothers we talking we don't know how
[54:14] you do all you do write the Books make
[54:15] the videos and preach I said brother
[54:18] it's because my job starts at 8:45
[54:20] that's why I got all morning to get
[54:21] things done I said don't don't beat
[54:24] yourself up don't feel bad brother but I
[54:26] like when people can give you a
[54:27] testimony like that we preached last
[54:28] week the spirit Bears witness with your
[54:31] spirit that you are the son or daughter
[54:33] of
[54:34] God
[54:36] Amen so who would have thought like I
[54:37] was thinking on the way here who would
[54:38] have thought I used to spend all my
[54:39] Sundays watching the cev Browns and then
[54:42] uh you know I was a sinner i' watch the
[54:45] morning game the mid game and then the
[54:47] late night game I'd watch him all now I
[54:50] might take a break and go out and you
[54:52] know play the football in the yard or
[54:53] something like that but I used to
[54:54] religiously do do that and who would
[54:55] have thought if you would have watched
[54:56] me all the years who would have thought
[54:57] that I would trade all that
[55:00] Sunday for trade it for worshiping Jesus
[55:03] and preaching and shouting and praising
[55:05] God and dancing around the church and
[55:06] praying for the sick who would have
[55:08] thought I would have traded that only
[55:09] Jesus knew that praise
[55:11] God hallelujah who who would ever known
[55:14] that I would have woke up one day and
[55:15] said this doesn't satisfy I don't want
[55:17] to fill my days with this I want to fill
[55:19] my days with a man called Jesus
[55:22] hallelujah
[55:24] amen because the gospel is so real
[55:27] Hallelujah you've got a testimony you
[55:30] know about it praise

[55:46] about God I've heard about the Old
[55:48] Testament but now I see
[55:50] God God sent me a evangelist now I'm
[55:54] getting better baptized and then he gets
[55:56] to see a preacher disappear right in
[55:58] front of
[55:59] him amen he gets to see a prefigure of a
[56:02] Rapture hallelujah what a type amen
[56:05] hallelujah see search the Scriptures
[56:08] Daily like the unic love God make
[56:10] sacrifices and you'll see a translation
[56:13] hallelujah amen
[56:16] hallelujah there's that this is the
[56:18] earnest of the
[56:20] Rapture the Bible said he translated 30
[56:23] miles away it's like going up to
[56:26] Cleveland imagine that one day I'll be
[56:28] preaching here I vanish from the pulpit
[56:29] I go to Cleveland now I don't know if
[56:30] that happen but wouldn't that be awesome
[56:33] there's one still up there in Cleveland
[56:34] who needs to hear the
[56:35] gospel 30 miles he comes up by the water
[56:39] he's praising God where's the preacher
[56:41] God took him sound familiar like Enoch
[56:44] God took him amen you know Church Elijah
[56:48] had done this
[56:49] before Elijah had translated you
[56:52] remember the scripture this was new to
[56:53] me or fresh to me first put up First
[56:55] Kings 18:12 my good friend and we're
[56:57] almost done it's already
[57:00] 87 I didn't realize this but Elijah had
[57:03] been translated before he was
[57:06] raptured and it should come to pass as
[57:08] soon as I gone from thee that the spirit
[57:10] of the Lord shall carry thee wither I
[57:11] know not and so when I come to tell Ahab
[57:14] he cannot find thee he shall slay me but
[57:16] I thy servant fear the lord from my
[57:19] youth so see he had had this transport
[57:22] in other words Elisha knew that God
[57:24] could trans transport him
[57:27] Hallelujah they knew and remember Elijah
[57:30] had such power from God he could outrun
[57:33] ahab's Chariot even in a
[57:36] famine they knew this guy's a little
[57:39] different he can outrun chariots in the
[57:41] midst of a famine what kind of diet is
[57:44] he on hallelujah amen and he' been known
[57:48] Elijah said this guy could disappear he
[57:50] could vanish oh hallelujah amen that's
[57:54] that's a supernatural element to the
[57:57] Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and
[58:01] this gives us courage there's no human
[58:03] curtain there's no Iron Curtain there's
[58:06] no bamboo curtain there's no Roman
[58:09] curtain that can keep the people of God
[58:12] trapped God can make them disappear
[58:15] Hallelujah and he's going to do that one
[58:17] day in a moment and the twinkle an eye
[58:20] with the shout the voice and the Trump
[58:22] they that are alive shall be gathered
[58:24] and changed in moment death will be
[58:26] swallowed up in Victory and will meet
[58:28] our loved ones will meet the dead in
[58:29] Christ in the air with Jesus
[58:32] Hallelujah this is what this shows us
[58:35] God has power to translate us any time
[58:37] any place Hallelujah let's stand to our
[58:39] feet by God's grace you've been a
[58:41] wonderful
[58:44] audience who called him away the spirit
[58:47] of the Lord CAU him
[58:50] away I'll say like this may God just
[58:52] catch us away out of our daily lives and
[58:54] may God just catch up may he just catch
[58:56] us and raise us up into Heavenly places
[58:58] in Christ Jesus I mean the meditation of
[59:01] our heart Paul says we're already in
[59:03] Heavenly places and we understand that
[59:05] we've got a theophany already in heaven
[59:06] waiting for us we understand that but I
[59:09] mean let's get our minds off the things
[59:11] of the world and let's let's let's set
[59:13] our affections on things above by God's
[59:15] grace let's bow our heads
