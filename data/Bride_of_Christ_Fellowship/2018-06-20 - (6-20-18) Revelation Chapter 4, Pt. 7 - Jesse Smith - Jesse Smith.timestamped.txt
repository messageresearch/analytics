[36:58] message to anyone that will come if no
[37:00] one comes we'll just sing and pray and
[37:02] perhaps I'll preach out because I'm
[37:04] going to by people do live stream as
[37:06] well brother Adam had a good idea to
[37:08] bite people on Facebook I thought that'd
[37:09] be a good idea I got like 800 friends on
[37:11] Facebook I don't know if they're all my
[37:13] friends but but I do want to invite them
[37:15] and perhaps if just one or two or
[37:17] whatever if anybody hears the Word of
[37:18] God will be happy about that and we're
[37:21] so thankful for any opportunity I was
[37:23] reading today member and Colossians and
[37:25] and the the Apostle Paul st. Paul said
[37:28] pray for me that God will open doors so
[37:31] I can speak the Word of God with
[37:33] boldness how many want open doors I do I
[37:36] just want open door so I can share my
[37:38] faith in Christ Jesus and the message
[37:40] and so that's that should be we're

[37:44] of our lips here in our prayer God open

[37:53] Jim shoemaker beer July 29th Heath
[37:57] Randolph August 18th and 19th and then
[38:00] brother Diggs on September 30th okay all
[38:05] right how we do it okay thank you maokai
[38:07] okay so we're on chapter four part 7
[38:12] okay so we read our text here basically
[38:16] that is I'm just probably get to one
[38:18] thought tonight the four beasts I'm
[38:19] gonna have a look at the four beasts a
[38:21] little bit tonight and all these
[38:23] revelations is just it's just like it's
[38:27] like a how did I say it's like a
[38:28] contract that brother Bram sermons are
[38:30] like concentrated when he's doing this
[38:31] teaching like that there's so much
[38:33] scripture there's so many revelations he
[38:35] just lays them out and he keeps asking
[38:38] the people can I go a little further and
[38:40] then they say yes and he's always the
[38:42] men shouting yeah but man was just like
[38:44] let the beans burn he said this is we're
[38:46] gonna feast on this word you know this
[38:49] is this is more important than your
[38:50] regular beans you keep saying beans so I
[38:53] don't know if you have beans planned for
[38:54] tonight but I don't think I'll keep you
[38:55] that long by God's grace but we do want
[38:58] a feasts on the Word of God we got
[38:59] plenty time here and let me set my timer
[39:00] so I don't wear myself out let's look at
[39:04] this here now the first thought brother
[39:06] branham brings out is he shows the
[39:09] difference between the four beasts and
[39:10] all the other beasts in the book of
[39:13] Revelation so this is the first thought
[39:15] he brings out Oh nature's back let's
[39:18] give nature of applause amen god bless
[39:20] you nature glory everybody missed you
[39:24] nature my daughters missed you so i'm
[39:26] sided even see her there but bless her
[39:29] heart good to see her eight and we're
[39:33] just at home you know it's just they
[39:34] were home we're home folks here you know
[39:36] but praise the Lord Amen just so happy
[39:39] to see the little little nature by God's
[39:41] grace so I just did a few pictures like
[39:44] I said so brother BAM he shows the
[39:46] difference between the four beasts and
[39:48] their before the throne and then the
[39:50] other beast that is in the book of
[39:52] Revelation so there's a great difference
[39:55] there brother Branham brings out their
[39:56] heat I'm sorry they're Greek definitions
[39:58] so he brings out the fact that the suit
[40:02] though the four beasts are actually soon
[40:04] in the Greek
[40:05] the word beast means oongh' and it's a
[40:07] different meaning just means a creature
[40:11] okay but when you read about the beast
[40:14] how the woman rides the beasts and all
[40:16] those who worship the Beast and take his
[40:18] image that beast is the same English
[40:21] word beast but it's a different Greek
[40:22] word and that's the word a theory on
[40:25] which has a striking definition it means
[40:29] wild untamed savage oh my god is so true
[40:35] Eve God is God's Word is so powerful
[40:37] it's just so powerful you know and I had
[40:41] one thought yeah well there's one
[40:42] thought give me just a moment here
[40:45] there's a there's a scripture I read I
[40:47] ran across when I was reading proverbs
[40:48] and I forgot to put on this sermon I'm
[40:50] sorry but in Proverbs you know the Bible
[40:52] says that men without wisdom are beasts
[40:54] so let me look up beasts just you know
[40:57] it kind of goes along with our proverbs
[40:58] series and I think I'll pull that up in
[41:01] just a few seconds I mean just bear with
[41:02] me yeah I'm sorry it's Ecclesiastes okay
[41:11] so why don't you go to Ecclesiastes 3:18
[41:13] if you got your Bibles let's go there
[41:15] Malachi can you read that when you got
[41:16] that buddy please ask these 318 not
[41:18] proverbs Ecclesiastes 3:18 so this is a
[41:34] prayer of Solomon Solomon's praying Lord
[41:37] would you manifest to all these men and
[41:39] women that they're nothing but beasts
[41:42] remember this is before the baptism of
[41:44] the Holy Ghost right so the motor a lot
[41:47] of times Solomon would see people living
[41:49] below the holiness standard that we
[41:51] enjoy today right we should when we're
[41:53] around each other we should say my this
[41:55] brother this sister this sister this
[41:57] brother no they live such a godly life
[41:59] and we should be able to maintain it
[42:01] because the seal of God the anointing of
[42:03] God should never leave our souls if
[42:05] we're born again it'll leave our minds
[42:07] you know we got to go praying in our
[42:09] minds right and the Bible said stir up
[42:11] your minds my way remembers and
[42:12] transform your mind you know by the
[42:14] renewing of your mind through prayer but
[42:16] we should live such a godly holy life
[42:18] that we could
[42:19] should be able to honestly say we are
[42:21] Saints raise God like if you watched my
[42:25] live you should say mine
[42:26] this man has separated unto God because
[42:29] that's what Saint means Saint means
[42:31] you're separated from the world you're
[42:33] not a part of the world but you're a
[42:34] part of the kingdom of God amen
[42:37] well Salman didn't see that Simon was
[42:39] saying Lord you know show these men that
[42:42] they're beasts oh my and so brother man
[42:47] brings us out and the the beasts were
[42:50] kind of dealing with here is these wild
[42:52] untamed savages this is the sinful Beast
[42:54] and program says this he said Zune means
[42:57] a creature for living Zune creatures not
[43:00] the beasts of wild theory on but Zune
[43:03] living creatures and thier iana's wild
[43:05] untamed savages in other words if you
[43:09] watch the 11th chapter the Beast of Rome
[43:11] the 13th chapter United States the 17th
[43:13] chapter both the United States and Rome
[43:16] how many know that in Revelation 13 the
[43:18] United States is in Revelation 13 it is
[43:21] the Beast spirit in United States and
[43:24] that's where we're living right now the
[43:27] Beast is operating through the United
[43:29] States government can the church say
[43:30] Amen that is actually scriptural program
[43:33] says that's thus saith the Lord that the
[43:35] be started out in the beginning you know
[43:37] the beginning of Revelation 13 it
[43:39] started as Rome but then it came to a
[43:42] land right and those beasts came up out
[43:44] of the land instead of the waters the
[43:46] waters as many people ancient Rome but
[43:48] the land is America North America and
[43:51] the beasts came up out of the land which
[43:53] is North America and that's where we are
[43:55] today and so program says see it's the
[43:58] beasts of the denominational churches
[44:02] consolidated with Catholicism makes them
[44:05] an unconverted untamed to the gospel hey
[44:08] then glory so when the Antichrist spirit
[44:12] is anointing Roman Catholics or
[44:14] denominational or even message churches
[44:17] that don't have the Holy Ghost and
[44:18] they're they're living under Crees and
[44:20] they're not born again they are untamed
[44:23] to the gospel the gospel cannot tame
[44:26] them the gospel cannot control them but
[44:28] you and I should be controlled
[44:30] constantly by the gospel of Jesus Christ
[44:33] so we should be we should be controlled
[44:35] by the holy spirit power not the power
[44:38] of the enemy amen
[44:40] and so that's what we're seeing here
[44:42] there's two anointings either stairs two
[44:44] beasts here there's anointing of the
[44:46] soon creatures the four beasts but then
[44:49] there's the anointing of Satan the beast
[44:51] or the Antichrist spirit amen
[44:54] now bohtan says these four beasts are
[44:56] throne guards they're not angels and
[45:00] they're not elders so let's read it so
[45:03] you got it now they were not angels
[45:04] neither were they elders they were
[45:06] living creatures at the throne oh don't
[45:09] you love this living creatures they're
[45:10] not angels because this proves it right
[45:12] here and he reads the scripture I beheld
[45:15] and heard the voice of many angels round
[45:16] about the throne and the beasts and the
[45:19] outer so that scripture points out three
[45:21] groups
[45:22] there's living creatures angels and then
[45:24] there's elders now there's three
[45:26] different categories here I hope you got
[45:28] this system down here now I want to show
[45:32] you there's three different categories
[45:33] of it three different species around the
[45:36] throne species there's three different
[45:39] species around the throne did you catch
[45:42] that so I just put it out here so you
[45:44] can see it there's three categories you
[45:45] have the throne and around the throne
[45:47] there's the four beasts there's 24
[45:50] elders then there's angels like
[45:51] seraphim's and the regulars ark angels
[45:54] and there's other different kinds of
[45:55] angels as well so you have program says
[45:58] there's three categories around the
[46:00] throne does that sound like God that God
[46:02] would do God would be perfected in three
[46:04] that sounds like it to me Father Son
[46:06] Holy Ghost three works of grace
[46:08] justification sanctification baptism
[46:10] Holy Ghost love faith and charity right
[46:12] you know that's just hope faith and
[46:14] charity rather goes together this is
[46:16] just like God God is always perfected in
[46:19] threes amen
[46:20] now he said let's leave that for a
[46:23] minute let's just hold it they're living
[46:24] creatures brother Benson what are they
[46:27] if they're not angels they're not
[46:29] redeemed men what are they would you
[46:31] like to know here's my interpretation he
[46:34] said I hope it's right I believe it is
[46:36] they are god's guards of his throne now
[46:40] we're going to erase this a little bit
[46:41] he said they're not angels doorman
[46:43] they're not wild beasts they're
[46:45] creatures
[46:46] living creatures alright somebody got it
[46:49] these creatures are living creatures
[46:52] they're throw their guards to God's
[46:54] throne now brother Brad embracing the
[46:56] thought of how the four beasts of
[46:59] Revelation are slightly different from
[47:02] the four beasts of Ezekiel however in
[47:05] the Book of Ezekiel as your head spin
[47:07] after you read Ezekiel mine usually does
[47:09] it's quite it's quite interesting
[47:11] there's such deep deep visions that
[47:13] Ezekiel goes through but they're they're
[47:16] the same they're the same beasts but
[47:18] changes happen to them after the New
[47:21] Testament how many know that the beasts
[47:23] of Ezekiel are different slightly than
[47:26] the beasts of Revelation because they've
[47:29] changed this positions amen
[47:31] the beast under the Old Testament were
[47:33] slightly different but when the blood of
[47:34] Jesus Christ was shed and Jesus Christ
[47:37] went to sit on the throne in heaven then
[47:39] there's some change that happened to the
[47:41] beasts amen and you'll see brother
[47:43] Branham bring it out here now when
[47:46] Ezekiel saw the glory of God he saw the
[47:47] same thing that John saw you remember
[47:50] last Sunday how we got the glory of God
[47:51] and got the picture where he had it
[47:53] taken with us that was the picture of
[47:54] brother branham's picture with the
[47:55] pillar fire
[47:56] you remember that the glory God the same
[47:58] thing as he Kia saw same thing John saw
[48:01] here it is today makes Jesus Christ the
[48:03] same in Ezekiel side same thing was here
[48:06] on earth the same God that's here with
[48:07] us today same yesterday today and
[48:10] forever he that was which is and shall
[48:13] come the entrance to the soul body
[48:15] spirit the brazen see the word the SEC
[48:18] sanctify our soul and the filler with
[48:20] the Holy Ghost the same thing see just
[48:23] the same all right now here's the
[48:25] difference so if this if you listen to
[48:28] the sermon you'll hear brother BAM say
[48:29] this here's the difference these same
[48:31] beasts were in Ezekiel before the blood
[48:34] of Jesus Christ and now we see the four
[48:37] beasts it which is actually after the
[48:39] rapture if you understand what I'm
[48:40] saying because John was raptured and
[48:43] caught up to heaven right and that's why
[48:45] the the glassy sea was crystal clear
[48:47] there was not firing it because it
[48:49] wasn't the tribulation time yet but the
[48:51] church had been pure a purge by the RAM
[48:54] says so whether man shows in Ezekiel the
[48:58] Bible said in Ezekiel that the
[49:00] four beasts didn't turn he said they
[49:03] couldn't go backwards
[49:04] he said they rolled on wheels and that's
[49:08] what the Bible says well brother have
[49:10] said now that John's been raptured he
[49:12] said they're stationary they don't roll
[49:15] on wheels anymore all right I mean we
[49:18] know what I'm talking about honey listen
[49:19] this lately is anybody listening to it
[49:20] lately
[49:21] okay look if you know if you haven't go
[49:23] back and listen to it you'll really
[49:24] enjoy it he said what's the symbol here
[49:26] brother branham what is it it means that
[49:29] these guards was God's ark they were in
[49:31] journey rolling on wheels when Ezekiel
[49:34] saw them but when John saw them they'd
[49:38] already come into their right position
[49:40] in heaven amen the Ark of God was on
[49:44] earth rolling on wheels as they took it
[49:46] from place to place a man had glory met
[49:49] it was in travel they took it all the
[49:51] way up through the wilderness and all
[49:53] the way into the temple and so forth so
[49:55] how many know in the day in the Old
[49:57] Testament that the ark was placed on the
[49:58] shoulders of the Levites and there was
[50:01] times the other instruments were placed
[50:03] on carts right and they were rolled and
[50:06] so during the Old Testament these four
[50:09] beasts were on wheels to symbolize that
[50:11] the Ark of God was constantly moving but
[50:16] brother they've said now that were after
[50:18] after the rapture he said now that Ark
[50:21] has received up because the church age
[50:23] is over and it's received up into glory
[50:26] see it's stationary now in heaven with
[50:30] all the angels and things around it amen
[50:33] only a prophet can pick that up church
[50:36] you and I reading that we would not have
[50:37] picked that up but the Old Testament
[50:40] beasts had wheels on them because the
[50:42] ark was moving on the earth but now that
[50:44] the church the blood of Jesus Christ has
[50:46] been shed the body of Jesus have been
[50:48] brought to heaven and the church has
[50:49] been raptured now those beasts are
[50:51] stationary they're not moving anymore
[50:53] they're in one place they're not going
[50:56] anywhere amen that's the throne of God
[50:58] that's the the presence of God and it's
[51:00] not going anywhere amen Church and you
[51:03] and I have access to it by prayer hey
[51:06] okay we had access to this throne the
[51:09] stationary beasts are there the angels
[51:11] the cherubims are saying
[51:13] though there and we can access the
[51:15] throne of God by prayer amen
[51:17] through the blood of Jesus what a
[51:19] privilege that we have amen
[51:22] now so hopefully that makes sense does
[51:24] that makes sense everybody so they were
[51:26] on wheels before because on earth the
[51:28] ark was constantly moving from place to
[51:30] place but now they're stationary because
[51:33] the throne of God has been established
[51:35] as that location in heaven amen
[51:38] all right now the next thought brother
[51:40] branham gives is that number four is the
[51:44] number of deliverance amen and just know
[51:48] that all numbers most numbers have good
[51:50] meanings too okay sometimes people say
[51:53] like I've heard people say well six is a
[51:55] bad number well not necessarily yeah it
[51:57] can it can mean a bad number right but
[52:00] it's a good number it was first a good
[52:02] number because I'm the sixth day God
[52:03] made a perfect man and who knows how
[52:07] many pieces of honey pieces of armor
[52:10] does the Christian have six look it up
[52:13] read it in Ephesians chapter six it's in
[52:15] Ephesians six see there are six pieces
[52:18] of armor so six is not always the bad
[52:20] number now it's bad when it's six six
[52:22] six that's when it's bad but six can be
[52:26] a good number God made everything on the
[52:28] sixth day he said that's good six was
[52:31] good and so for as good as well enough
[52:34] or can be bad we know that before can be
[52:37] a good number as well so let's look at
[52:39] this program says how four is a good
[52:40] number in this sermon and four is the
[52:44] number of the earth because remember the
[52:46] earth has four corners right the four
[52:48] corners the four winds of the earth did
[52:51] you know that huh me knows now before we
[52:54] have to go into it
[52:55] four is an earthly number sure like the
[52:59] four it's the number of Earth
[53:01] deliverance deliverance now keep that in
[53:04] your mind deliverance because I'm gonna
[53:05] strike it just a minute real hard I'm
[53:09] gonna strike it real hard see
[53:10] deliverance now there was three Hebrew
[53:12] children in the fiery furnace but the
[53:15] fourth one come it was deliverance
[53:18] praise the Lord
[53:20] Lazarus was in the grave three days but
[53:23] when the fourth one come he was deliver
[53:26] amen for is God's number of deliverance
[53:30] amen
[53:32] so it showed that these beings must have
[53:34] been something about the earth so
[53:37] there's four beings these four zoon
[53:39] creatures these four living creatures
[53:41] these four beasts and therefore
[53:43] represent deliverance on the earth amen
[53:46] hallelujah thank you Jesus amen if you
[53:50] know that you know I'm excited if you
[53:51] know the message amen cuz look because
[53:55] member one defeat read Revelation 4/7
[53:58] say and the first beast was like a lion
[54:00] and the second beast like a calf third
[54:03] like a face of man and the fourth beast
[54:05] was like a flying eagle so so see my
[54:09] note there
[54:10] the flying eagle as as an anointing it's
[54:13] a power
[54:14] it's our delivering power today so that
[54:18] flying eagle represents the delivering
[54:22] power that we have today to be delivered
[54:24] amen
[54:25] we have the power God has given us power
[54:28] to be set free from all bondage amen we
[54:32] don't have to say that I'm going to be
[54:34] bound my whole life by this we don't
[54:36] have to say that now it may be God's
[54:38] will but you know test us there try us
[54:40] or chasing us or something like that but
[54:42] we don't have to always feel like that
[54:44] because the anointing today is to
[54:46] deliver us amen
[54:48] like brother man remember what is the
[54:50] stomach problem when he gives that
[54:51] testimony the wings of us so I dove
[54:53] every seven years it came back so every
[54:55] seven years he had deliverance but
[54:57] finally at the end of the life he got
[54:59] full deliverance amen hallelujah so we
[55:02] got to keep believing that we got to
[55:04] keep trusting at some point God is going
[55:06] to fully deliver me because that's the
[55:08] hour we're living it is the hour of
[55:10] deliverance amen so we must pray for the
[55:14] anointing to fly above sin which is our
[55:18] deliverance on this earth praise God and
[55:22] members not a stable or sitting eagle or
[55:25] a sleeping eagle it's a flying eagle
[55:27] right it's a flying eagle well look at
[55:30] that just a moment now brother have said
[55:32] every time a religious power now this is
[55:35] an Easter seal so he's going back five
[55:37] years or I'm sorry going forward five
[55:39] years to show
[55:40] what he preaches about this eagle
[55:41] anointing every time a religious power
[55:44] went forth to meet the challenge of the
[55:46] political power of the world when the
[55:48] lion raised up the religious power it
[55:50] went to meet the Roman power and when
[55:53] and when and then when the come the
[55:55] sacrifice our the ox went because he's
[55:57] the sacrificed beast of the Lord then
[56:01] come the reformers down through the
[56:02] church ages come the face of a man and
[56:05] the Reformers had been since Luther
[56:07] Wesley Oh Calvin and on down Pentecostal
[56:11] age so for each hour they had a power
[56:14] brother man said the lion power was the
[56:16] the Apostles they were so fierce the
[56:19] Bible said the righteous are bold as a
[56:21] lion so no no age will be as bold as
[56:25] that lion age as far as I understand I
[56:27] can be wrong but they look at Paul
[56:29] settings he says Oh death where is your
[56:31] sting
[56:32] he said I've ran the course I'm ready to
[56:34] be offered I'm ready to be a martyr how
[56:36] many people would say that today that
[56:37] probably not many people but that's the
[56:40] anointing that he had there Steven he's
[56:42] being stoned and he's not even afraid
[56:44] he's just got like a face like a angel
[56:46] he's got a face of a messenger he's
[56:48] saying stole me if you want God will put
[56:50] me to sleep
[56:51] he's bold as a lion right and then of
[56:54] course we know the Roman Catholic Church
[56:56] slaughtered millions and millions of
[56:58] Christians but they willingly went to
[57:00] the stake because they were anointed as
[57:03] an ox
[57:03] as a calf the Bible said they were like
[57:06] a young calf not really aware what's
[57:08] going on and just kind of go with the
[57:10] float and given themselves as sacrifice
[57:12] to Jesus Christ oh my and then the
[57:16] Reformers Martin Luther John Wester we
[57:18] just got through the church ages their
[57:20] anointing was wisdom to know their
[57:22] wisdom man to know that these false
[57:24] doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church
[57:26] are nothing but tommyrot and God gave
[57:29] them the wisdom to point out in the
[57:30] scripture that the just shall live by
[57:32] faith
[57:33] that believers must live a sanctified
[57:35] life they meant God gave him wisdom to
[57:38] point out in the word amen and now we're
[57:41] innocent but in the last in the last
[57:44] message he went forth there come a
[57:45] flying eagle programs and it's eagle
[57:49] time I mean no it's Eagle time got any
[57:52] Eagles out there tonight
[57:53] it's eagle time which is reveal time the
[57:58] Word of God made manifest that means
[58:01] manifest means appeared so eagle time is
[58:04] when the word appears to you it's
[58:06] revealed and now appears to us glory and
[58:10] he says the Word of God proved old
[58:14] children walk into this baptism of the
[58:16] Holy Spirit come in and believe it with
[58:19] all your heart God will fill you amen so
[58:23] see this is why I made my note your
[58:25] revelation from the Father is invincible
[58:28] that's the invincible army brother I was
[58:30] talking about in the church age book
[58:31] that you have to have the anointing of
[58:33] the flying eagle then you're invincible
[58:35] you fly way above the Beast the Beast is
[58:39] way down here the woman's riding the
[58:40] Beast
[58:41] but if you're an eagle you can catch a
[58:43] thermal and you can just fly and just
[58:45] with ease go up way up high and that
[58:48] beast can't touch you because you're
[58:50] flying on the wind and the Holy Spirit
[58:52] amen
[58:53] it's exactly right and what causes what
[58:57] does that witness the revelation of the
[58:59] Holy Spirit where God is he reveals his
[59:02] word to us and it lifts us up way from
[59:05] the earth and the Bible said the gates
[59:07] are the counsels of Hell cannot prevail
[59:10] against revelation Amen huh glory the
[59:14] there's no that that demon power the
[59:16] pale horse rider today cannot prevail
[59:19] against the flying eagle anointing
[59:21] because he can't even no he can't even
[59:23] throw is he can't even throw his death
[59:25] that high whatever he's got here
[59:27] whatever weapon he's got he can't throw
[59:29] it that high because the Eagle is so
[59:31] high up in heavenly places amen that's
[59:34] exactly right
[59:35] look at this this is what an Solomon
[59:38] I'm sorry King Eggar caught this
[59:41] revelation did you know that he caught
[59:43] this revelation he caught he caught a
[59:46] little glimpse of a flying eagle and
[59:48] remember there are sixty kinds of eagles
[59:49] on the earth so I don't think the bald
[59:51] eagles actually in Jerusalem I don't
[59:53] know for sure but I don't think it's in
[59:54] I don't think that's the one in
[59:55] Jerusalem but King agar somewhere saw
[59:57] one of the sixty kinds of eagles and
[59:59] maybe there was more even during that
[1:00:00] day but he says there be three things
[1:00:03] which are too wonderful for me yeah
[1:00:07] for which I I don't know the way of an
[1:00:13] eagle in the air is the first one he
[1:00:15] lists I like that
[1:00:18] so see and of course you see the other
[1:00:20] ones are serpent on a rock the ship in
[1:00:22] the midst of the sea and then the way
[1:00:23] with the mate alright I was looking I
[1:00:32] was looking for the four beasts because
[1:00:33] I saw a man and then I saw an ego I was
[1:00:35] looking for the ox and the line but I
[1:00:37] didn't see you don't understand brother
[1:00:39] William you see that oh man did I miss
[1:00:42] something there but no yeah you always
[1:00:47] looking for revelation from the Holy
[1:00:49] Spirit you know but look he you know
[1:00:52] King Eggar was anointed by the Holy
[1:00:54] Spirit in mind when I watching the Eagle
[1:00:57] fly
[1:00:57] it is way too wonderful I don't even
[1:00:59] understand how he flies well science has
[1:01:02] studied them a little bit and I was
[1:01:05] reading today on a on a an organization
[1:01:08] website learner org
[1:01:10] has had two scientists found that Eagles
[1:01:13] only spend about two minutes out of each
[1:01:16] hour flapping their wings because
[1:01:19] flapping takes all the energy you ever
[1:01:22] feel like you hardly have any spiritual
[1:01:23] energy you know Eagles they're just
[1:01:26] supposed to flat for about two minutes
[1:01:27] and then for like 58 minutes they just
[1:01:31] get their relax now church humming I
[1:01:34] mean I mean I've gone through a week and
[1:01:36] you feel like all you're doing is
[1:01:37] flapping I'm just trying to make it
[1:01:40] through the week brother yes huh I could
[1:01:42] get the church and I'm so tired
[1:01:43] I have weeks like that - I feel like all
[1:01:46] I'm doing is flapping alright with me we
[1:01:50] feel like that but the real eagle
[1:01:52] anointing when we get under the
[1:01:54] anointing of the Holy Ghost we're not
[1:01:56] supposed to feel like all we're doing is
[1:01:58] flapping we're supposed to feel like
[1:02:00] we're resting upon the Word of God amen
[1:02:03] we're supposed to do it just a little
[1:02:05] bit of work
[1:02:06] amen and that's how we know and we're
[1:02:08] under the anointing the church the
[1:02:10] Christian life doesn't feel like work it
[1:02:13] feels like rest hallelujah amen
[1:02:17] so these scientists studied for all
[1:02:18] these months and they found out that
[1:02:20] egos
[1:02:20] really only flat for two minutes out of
[1:02:22] 60 what's that 99 98 percent what is
[1:02:26] that in 95 percent most of their life
[1:02:28] most of their time in the air and what's
[1:02:30] our anointing is not the Eagle in the
[1:02:32] nest anointing we've been pushed out of
[1:02:34] the nest we've got the flying eagle
[1:02:36] anointing amen that's what we've got and
[1:02:39] he says the energy needed to maintain a
[1:02:42] bird in flat soaring or gliding as much
[1:02:45] as perhaps a twentieth or less the power
[1:02:48] needed for flapping therefore Eagles
[1:02:52] will always choose to soar or glide when
[1:02:54] possible I think that's what you would
[1:02:57] choose too wouldn't you would you choose
[1:03:00] a week where I was doing I'm just trying
[1:03:02] to be a believer I'm just this devils
[1:03:04] wearing me out or would you rather have
[1:03:07] a week where I'm just sailing the
[1:03:09] heavenlies oil as well oh praise the
[1:03:12] Lord God is so good I'm just riding the
[1:03:15] power of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:16] oh man that's the coronoid thing and we
[1:03:20] need more of that amen
[1:03:21] because wind tides Holy Ghost right
[1:03:24] jesus said the Holy Ghost is like a win
[1:03:26] you don't know when it's coming when
[1:03:28] it's good but Eagles find the wind
[1:03:30] hallelujah that's called a thermal as
[1:03:33] why I mentioned earlier a thermal is
[1:03:36] when there's a huge gust of wind and
[1:03:38] that thermal lifts the Eagle up amen
[1:03:41] now this goes on to say that is why when
[1:03:45] Eagles are flying long distances
[1:03:47] especially on migration they often saw
[1:03:50] on thermals until they reach a great
[1:03:53] altitude and then use the gliding and
[1:03:56] soaring method of flying to cover the
[1:03:59] longest distance when the Swift the
[1:04:02] smallest amount of energy so church I
[1:04:06] hope I can do this the right way
[1:04:07] an eagle has to do a little work at the
[1:04:11] beginning can I say like this you got do
[1:04:13] a little bit of prayer right you do a
[1:04:15] little bit of prayer you're working up
[1:04:17] and praying you praise the Lord but
[1:04:18] pretty soon if you're working and
[1:04:21] praying pretty soon you should hit the
[1:04:23] anointing you should hit the sweetness
[1:04:26] of the Holy Spirit how many like they
[1:04:27] hit the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:28] well now the Spirit has taken over and
[1:04:32] now I'm just resting now I'm
[1:04:34] enjoying the sweetness of God amen and
[1:04:38] then that spirit will take us higher
[1:04:40] right and higher where we can love
[1:04:42] people at church we can love people in
[1:04:44] our hope we're expressing the love of
[1:04:46] Christ on the job and the Christian life
[1:04:48] just seems like such a rest from
[1:04:51] Anderson why are people so tossed about
[1:04:53] today he says because they come out of
[1:04:56] the holiest of holies in other words
[1:04:58] they leave the presence they leave the
[1:05:00] wind they leave the power of God but see
[1:05:04] we've got a flap so the hard part is
[1:05:06] just getting started right and we got to
[1:05:08] flap the old test we got to quote the
[1:05:10] Old Testament we got to quote the New
[1:05:11] Testament and we got to keep quoting
[1:05:13] them and quoting them right and working
[1:05:15] with that inquiry than the just shall
[1:05:17] live by faith the judge shall live by
[1:05:18] faith
[1:05:19] there's power in the brother by His
[1:05:21] stripes I'm healed we got to keep
[1:05:22] flapping and flapping until God anoints
[1:05:25] us and then we've got to ride the
[1:05:26] anointing are you with me that's the
[1:05:30] anointing for this hour is the flying
[1:05:32] eagle anointing remember it's not our
[1:05:35] power we do a little bit of power but
[1:05:37] then the Holy Spirit lifts us up into
[1:05:39] heavenly places hey man don't you love
[1:05:42] that I don't know we're just such a easy
[1:05:45] it's an easy illustration to show how we
[1:05:48] get under this anointing and how this
[1:05:51] anointing is so powerful this anointing
[1:05:53] should take us a long distance right
[1:05:55] this anointing should take us far away
[1:05:58] from our troubles Oh glory
[1:06:01] yeah it should take a so far away
[1:06:03] because the Spirit is leading us and
[1:06:06] guiding us away from the trouble oh
[1:06:08] right away from the drama or the fear or
[1:06:12] the temptation it leads us way far away
[1:06:15] from that and we find a better position
[1:06:18] we find the position God wants us to be
[1:06:20] in oh that's beautiful praise the Lord
[1:06:23] now there's other various ego scriptures
[1:06:27] I had prepared but I wanted you to see
[1:06:30] that again the flying ego noin thing
[1:06:32] look how easy look how simple it is for
[1:06:35] the ego to get under that anointing he's
[1:06:37] just got to do a little bit of work and
[1:06:39] then the spear will lift him up amen how
[1:06:43] many want God to lift you up tonight
[1:06:46] I'm sailor lift me higher take me higher
[1:06:48] help me just to press my wings out there
[1:06:51] and catch your anointing praise the Lord
[1:06:53] no glory
[1:06:55] and you all could understand it right
[1:06:57] like with water baptism all the chickens
[1:06:59] are down there saying Father Son Holy
[1:07:00] Ghost
[1:07:01] well you just had to take the Old
[1:07:02] Testament and the New Testament and just
[1:07:04] believe that be baptized and God lift
[1:07:06] you way up above that right well you you
[1:07:09] whatever temptation whatever chicken
[1:07:11] denominational attitudes are down you're
[1:07:14] on the ground we just got to catch both
[1:07:15] the Old Testament New Testament and let
[1:07:17] God take us up and rest in the thus
[1:07:20] saith the Lord out of the Bible amen
[1:07:22] and that will lift us up in the heavenly
[1:07:24] places haha yes I believe it now let's
[1:07:29] look at a few scriptures here when God
[1:07:34] I'll just say like this when God is
[1:07:35] stirring you up he's leading you when
[1:07:38] God is pudding when God is putting a
[1:07:40] passion in your heart I just got to do
[1:07:42] something I really feel like I let me do
[1:07:44] this I just got to move and I got to get
[1:07:46] out of this place I've got to do
[1:07:47] something different for the Lord when
[1:07:49] God is stirring you up God's leading you
[1:07:52] you look at the Bible 732 God found him
[1:07:56] Israel in a desert wind and the waste
[1:08:00] howling wilderness he led him about and
[1:08:02] instructed him and kept him as the apple
[1:08:04] of his eye as an eagle stirreth up her
[1:08:08] nest flutter a--the over her young
[1:08:11] spreadeth abroad her wings to see she's
[1:08:15] got to stir up her nest she's got a flap
[1:08:17] her wings on the Eagles right kind of
[1:08:19] shake him up get some wind blowing on
[1:08:21] him get some anointing in their face
[1:08:23] amen
[1:08:24] if the Holy Ghost moving in their lives
[1:08:26] spread about her rings Wow look how
[1:08:28] God's Word is Old Testament New
[1:08:30] Testament look at those great big wings
[1:08:32] of the word of God taketh them and bear
[1:08:36] them on her wings I've never seen that
[1:08:39] in the video but the Bible said that the
[1:08:41] mother Eagle Bears the little ones on
[1:08:43] her wings so God gives us a little ride
[1:08:47] we just ride his power amen this must be
[1:08:51] at the beginning I cuz I've never seen
[1:08:52] it there's other things about Eagles
[1:08:54] I've heard but I haven't seen any but
[1:08:55] that's okay because though if the Word
[1:08:57] of God says it then it has to happen
[1:08:59] I know somewhere there Samet eagle these
[1:09:01] 60 kind of eagles that one of the babies
[1:09:04] are little ones they ride the wings of
[1:09:06] mother right and look at the Bible said
[1:09:09] so the Lord alone did lead them so all
[1:09:13] this interaction right here is
[1:09:15] leadership of the Holy Spirit and there
[1:09:18] was no strange God with him so see
[1:09:21] Church God leads us by stirring us up
[1:09:24] and carrying us on his power oh you know
[1:09:28] God I just feel like God is gonna do
[1:09:30] something in my life pretty soon things
[1:09:32] are stirring up there's a little bit of
[1:09:33] trouble or there's a little bit of
[1:09:35] shaking going on it's God leading you if
[1:09:37] you'll say if you'll hang to the word
[1:09:39] you'll stay in the perfect will of God
[1:09:42] but see sometimes when troubles happen
[1:09:44] people choose the easy way out and that
[1:09:46] might not be the Word of God they might
[1:09:49] just jump out of the nest instead of
[1:09:50] jumping on mom's wings amen
[1:09:52] I said we got new his jump on mom's
[1:09:54] wings jump on the Word of God amen and
[1:09:57] that's God leading us oh why is life so
[1:10:00] hard why is my life all stirred up why
[1:10:03] is things blowin wire why is all this a
[1:10:05] movement happened it's God leading his
[1:10:07] Eagles it's God leading you by the Holy
[1:10:11] Spirit that's right
[1:10:13] now here's another one I just want to
[1:10:15] put in here briefly Fresno Fresno
[1:10:20] Lightning cometh out of the east and
[1:10:22] shines even under the west so shall also
[1:10:24] the coming of the Son of Man be for
[1:10:27] wheresoever the carcase is there will
[1:10:30] the eagle's be gathered now if you know
[1:10:35] the context of these scriptures this is
[1:10:37] talking about the 144,000 if you know
[1:10:39] the context look at the next verse
[1:10:40] immediately after the tribulation of
[1:10:42] those days shall the Sun be darkened
[1:10:43] doesn't that remind anybody of the sixth
[1:10:46] seal and the church said I can prove it
[1:10:49] if you want to go to your Bible I'll go
[1:10:50] to you say yeah we'll say your original
[1:10:52] revelation 6
[1:10:53] the Sun gets darkened now under the
[1:10:55] sixth seal so this is Jesus talking
[1:10:57] actually about the Eagles of the 144,000
[1:11:01] but why the Eagles because they get the
[1:11:03] seal of the Holy Ghost why are you an
[1:11:05] eagle because you get burned again amen
[1:11:08] hallelujah that's what makes us Eagles
[1:11:11] as
[1:11:11] got the baptism with all the girls like
[1:11:13] brother and said eagle time reveal time
[1:11:15] story so I'm gonna read it revelation
[1:11:18] six you have to turn there but I'm gonna
[1:11:20] just read to you so you know you got it
[1:11:24] it's revelation 6 verse 12 and I beheld
[1:11:28] when he had opened the sixth seal and lo
[1:11:30] there was a great earthquake and the Sun
[1:11:32] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[1:11:35] the moon became as blood and the stars
[1:11:38] of heaven fell into the earth even as a
[1:11:39] fig tree kathas her untimely figs when
[1:11:42] she is shaken of a mighty wind and the
[1:11:45] heaven departed as a scroll when it is
[1:11:47] rolled together and every mountain and
[1:11:49] Island were moved out of their places
[1:11:50] all right so can anybody see that in
[1:11:52] verse 29 a meeting after the tribulation
[1:11:54] of those days shall the Sun be darkened
[1:11:55] that's what we just read in verse 12 the
[1:11:58] Sun is darkened the moon shall not give
[1:12:00] her light and the stars shall fall from
[1:12:02] heaven and the powers of the heavens
[1:12:04] shall be shaken and then shall appear
[1:12:06] the sign of the Son of man in heaven and
[1:12:08] then shall all the tribes of the earth
[1:12:11] see all the tribes of the earth that's
[1:12:13] not the rapture that's that's Armageddon
[1:12:15] and then all shall all the tribes of the
[1:12:17] earth mourn and they shall see the Son
[1:12:20] of man coming in the clouds of heaven
[1:12:21] with power and great glory and the
[1:12:24] Church said that's that's that's the
[1:12:26] Battle of Armageddon when they see him
[1:12:28] coming back just as he came
[1:12:30] that's Armageddon but the point I want
[1:12:33] to make is that Eagles will always be
[1:12:36] around the fresh word of God and that's
[1:12:39] the Word of God that you and I have
[1:12:40] received do you love the Word of God
[1:12:42] still you still enjoy water baptism in
[1:12:44] Jesus Christ's name you still enjoy all
[1:12:47] the seven seals praise the Lord of
[1:12:49] course
[1:12:50] now some people preach them wrong and
[1:12:52] and it's not anointed but when you teach
[1:12:55] any word of god that's anointed it's
[1:12:57] life to the people amen holly like I
[1:13:01] said when brother him preaches seven
[1:13:03] seals
[1:13:03] he said these were the greatest services
[1:13:05] he ever preached because the the Holy
[1:13:08] Ghost came every day and revealed the
[1:13:11] Word of God to him in a vision he said
[1:13:13] this is greater than any healing so we
[1:13:15] know revelation of the word of God is
[1:13:17] the greatest thing we can have happen
[1:13:20] that we know thus saith the Lord so
[1:13:23] whether you're teaching or pre
[1:13:25] you're casting out Devils whatever
[1:13:26] you're doing it's the same Holy Ghost
[1:13:28] doing it all and the Holy Ghost gives
[1:13:30] life amen hallelujah that's what I tell
[1:13:35] the devil you know it's the devil
[1:13:37] whispers in my hair well you're just a
[1:13:38] teacher and and the people can't be
[1:13:40] anointed for faith and I say nonsense
[1:13:41] brother Branham had so much faith
[1:13:43] leukemia was healed when he was teaching
[1:13:45] the seven scales and it don't matter
[1:13:47] it's this the Holy Spirit it's the faith
[1:13:49] of the people it's what God is leading
[1:13:51] you to believe you and I can't speak
[1:13:55] squirrels unless God tells us to do it
[1:13:56] nor can brother Adam Branson God let me
[1:13:59] do that so we must find the leadership
[1:14:02] of today what is God leading us to do if
[1:14:04] maybe just leading us to keep up the
[1:14:06] fight and keep Oranje maybe he's leading
[1:14:08] us to get off the ground and so in the
[1:14:11] heavenlies amen
[1:14:12] stop beating your wings and using all of
[1:14:14] our human energy right and just get up
[1:14:17] and fly get an anointing and catch the
[1:14:20] anointing of the Holy Spirit to fly far
[1:14:22] away from this temptation to fly far
[1:14:24] away from this sin that's what he wants
[1:14:27] us to do is be flying Eagles amen
[1:14:30] that's right church but see the eagle is
[1:14:34] always around the fresh Word of God now
[1:14:38] I don't know I saw an article today
[1:14:39] about Eagles from popular science so I
[1:14:41] don't know but they that they said they
[1:14:43] were saying how American Eagles American
[1:14:47] Eagle American message believers they
[1:14:50] were just saying American Eagles though
[1:14:52] are getting trained because of how the
[1:14:53] world has changed they're getting
[1:14:55] trained to basically watch to another
[1:14:58] animal gets food and then bully that
[1:15:00] animal away and then take their food so
[1:15:02] this article this scientific article it
[1:15:04] said that American Eagles are kind of
[1:15:06] little they're kind of bullies they're
[1:15:07] not really working real hard I don't
[1:15:09] want to be like that I don't want to
[1:15:11] take somebody else's victory
[1:15:12] I want my victory praise God I want to
[1:15:15] be a soldier
[1:15:15] I want to be an overcomer a my don't
[1:15:17] want to be a lazy Christian I'm gonna be
[1:15:19] someone that's on the battlefront praise
[1:15:20] God like the Bible said let every man
[1:15:23] prove his ministry amen and the church
[1:15:26] said you need to have a ministry you
[1:15:29] have a ministry I have a ministry and we
[1:15:31] need to prove that the devil that this
[1:15:33] is our ministry and we're going to be
[1:15:34] victorious in our ministry
[1:15:36] amen that the
[1:15:38] let no man take your crown you got a
[1:15:41] crown to win you got something to do
[1:15:43] you've got a minister you've got to
[1:15:44] fulfill so go win it brother and sister
[1:15:47] amen
[1:15:48] don't let anybody take your reward don't
[1:15:50] anybody take your crown find what God's
[1:15:52] called you that's what we looked at on
[1:15:53] Sunday the perfect win of God a man
[1:15:56] after God's own heart that's what a real
[1:15:58] Christian is that's what a real Holy
[1:16:00] Ghost filled flying eagle is somebody
[1:16:02] that is after the heart of God and when
[1:16:04] they get the heart of God they get the
[1:16:06] will of God and then they know what God
[1:16:08] wants them to do and they do with all
[1:16:10] their heart they don't let anything be
[1:16:12] distracting they stay in the perfect
[1:16:14] will of God and they get a reward ha ha
[1:16:16] amen
[1:16:19] now didn't get this next one I think it
[1:16:21] did study some of us get past that one a
[1:16:23] little bit all right let me close up
[1:16:24] here let me finish up I got 20 minutes
[1:16:26] glory amen that's good they're full of
[1:16:31] eyes revelation 4:6 brother Ram brings
[1:16:35] this thought out they're full of eyes
[1:16:40] now I'll be honest I never once thought
[1:16:42] I could preach seven sermons on just
[1:16:43] chapter four there's so much revelation
[1:16:46] in here
[1:16:47] revelation 4:6 and before the throne
[1:16:49] there was a sea of glass remember the
[1:16:51] sea of glass represent what the washing
[1:16:53] of the water of the word that's what the
[1:16:56] sea of glass represents the washing of
[1:16:59] water by the word the bride John was
[1:17:01] washed they were washed it was like unto
[1:17:04] crystal there wasn't firing it wasn't
[1:17:05] the tribulation it was pure it was a
[1:17:08] complete blood washed Church amen
[1:17:11] and the midst of thrown around about the
[1:17:14] throne were four beasts full of eyes
[1:17:16] before and behind so they have eyes
[1:17:20] before them eyes behind them and this is
[1:17:23] a pretty simple revelation brother mem
[1:17:25] don't spend a whole lot of time on it
[1:17:26] but he says the throne right up next to
[1:17:28] God living creatures next thing to God
[1:17:31] standing there their intelligence of
[1:17:33] eyes represent intelligence Branham says
[1:17:37] they know what was which is and what
[1:17:41] shall come they had eyes without showing
[1:17:44] what they could see what was to come
[1:17:47] they had eyes within knows everything
[1:17:50] now and eyes in the back
[1:17:53] which no what was sober man says which
[1:17:56] was which is which shall come reflecting
[1:17:59] through the church ages that he was he
[1:18:02] that was which is and shall come it's
[1:18:05] reflecting that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:18:07] yesterday today and forever
[1:18:08] hey though she loved the simplicity of
[1:18:10] God's Word see the that those beasts
[1:18:13] represent the anointings so it
[1:18:15] represents how the Holy Spirit knows
[1:18:17] which was which is and which is to come
[1:18:19] God sees everything
[1:18:21] God saw you before you were born he sees
[1:18:24] you now that you are the age you up and
[1:18:26] he sees you in the future and I'll tell
[1:18:28] you the future we're going to be in
[1:18:30] eternity with Christ Jesus that for my
[1:18:33] future is I hope that's where yours is
[1:18:34] is to be with Christ for all eternity
[1:18:36] amen that's one thing I know about my
[1:18:39] future I'm not sure if God will keep me
[1:18:41] in Akron forever I don't know where God
[1:18:42] will take me I don't know what job will
[1:18:43] give me but one thing I know about my
[1:18:44] future it's with Jesus Christ hey man
[1:18:48] that's what is to come for me well
[1:18:50] Jessie what's your life gonna be like in
[1:18:51] 10 years I know but I know an eternity
[1:18:53] I'll be with Christ amen which is to
[1:18:57] come that is to come because the Bible
[1:18:59] said when I die I'll receive a body and
[1:19:01] I my body will be just like unto his
[1:19:03] glorious body hey man how do I know you
[1:19:06] that's exactly right now now this is
[1:19:09] interesting now I don't have all the
[1:19:10] answers to this because memmer bromance
[1:19:12] of the living creatures were not angels
[1:19:14] but now by Bram calls him living
[1:19:16] creatures cherubims I thought a cherub
[1:19:19] was a angel so I don't know I'm just
[1:19:21] saying you know what bro Graham said
[1:19:23] okay I don't have this one figured out
[1:19:26] but I'm saying you know he takes a lot
[1:19:28] of time and goes into this he said
[1:19:30] that's exactly what John saw in heaven
[1:19:31] these four cherubim so now the living
[1:19:33] creatures or beasts these zoon creatures
[1:19:36] are now called cherubims on the fore
[1:19:40] side the arc of the throne in heaven
[1:19:42] they were the guards of the ark
[1:19:45] cherubims guards at the mercy seat don't
[1:19:51] you love the word now there's actually a
[1:19:54] lot of scripture to prove this if you go
[1:19:55] if you got you don't have to turn ever I
[1:19:57] got up here at zekiel 10 proves this
[1:19:58] this is beautiful I never saw this till
[1:20:00] today
[1:20:01] and everyone had four faces the first
[1:20:04] face was the face of a cherub
[1:20:06] now this I don't know why this is
[1:20:08] not a calf but anyways you'll see you'll
[1:20:10] see the four okay ii was the face of a
[1:20:12] man the third the face of lion and the
[1:20:14] fourth of the eagle so see the only one
[1:20:16] that's missing is a calf i don't know if
[1:20:17] a cherub looks like a calf or not i
[1:20:19] don't know i would imagine it did that's
[1:20:21] the fourth one unless there was some
[1:20:23] change right like after the blood of
[1:20:24] christ maybe there was some change i
[1:20:26] don't know because we saw a change with
[1:20:28] the wheels and the cherubims were lifted
[1:20:31] up this is the living creature that i
[1:20:34] saw by the river of Chebar to memory
[1:20:38] talks about their faces this is this is
[1:20:40] a chair boom now and then he says in
[1:20:43] verse 20 this is the living creature
[1:20:44] that I saw under the God of Israel by
[1:20:48] the river of Chebar and I knew that they
[1:20:50] were the cherubims how many how many how
[1:20:54] many happy when the Word of God proves
[1:20:55] itself the Bible tells us the creatures
[1:20:59] were cherubims and prevent tells us
[1:21:01] their cherubims I'd like to be right
[1:21:03] with the word don't you
[1:21:04] Amen so he takes a little bit of time on
[1:21:09] that spends over time here and he goes
[1:21:12] through and reads these so we got on by
[1:21:14] the scripture but I finish it up there
[1:21:16] so just so you know again let me go back
[1:21:17] there just so you know the living
[1:21:18] creatures are cherubims
[1:21:20] that's what bro Ram said and that's what
[1:21:21] the Bible tells us here in Ezekiel 10
[1:21:25] now brother Branham shows us where the
[1:21:29] cherubims are first mentioned the Bible
[1:21:31] is in Genesis chapter 3 verse 24
[1:21:35] so these cherubims these four beasts
[1:21:37] were actually cherubims program shows us
[1:21:39] their throne guards they guard the
[1:21:41] throne because there's three groups by
[1:21:43] the throne and then he said their first
[1:21:45] mention in Genesis he said let's go back
[1:21:48] just a minute to be sure that we got
[1:21:50] these fellows right the first time that
[1:21:53] these guards was mentioned is in Genesis
[1:21:55] now remember everything that we preach
[1:21:57] has got to come from Genesis through
[1:21:58] revelation that hallelujah I love that
[1:22:02] any time that you want to be questioning
[1:22:04] come ask me see it must be the whole
[1:22:06] Bible not just part of it because God
[1:22:08] don't change what he was in Genesis he
[1:22:12] is today he was in the middle age he's
[1:22:14] always the same see now in Genesis when
[1:22:17] these cherubims that's how I come to
[1:22:19] find them had to go back to 5
[1:22:20] doubt what they was at the beginning all
[1:22:23] right so here's the scripture you know
[1:22:24] it and so he drove out the man and he
[1:22:27] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden
[1:22:30] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[1:22:34] turned every way to keep the way of the
[1:22:38] Tree of Life
[1:22:39] now the word keep in Hebrew means to
[1:22:42] guard so it's perfect program calls him
[1:22:44] throne guards it's perfect
[1:22:45] their throne keepers beautiful I love
[1:22:49] how the Word of God is so pure and so
[1:22:52] Chairman's are called throne guards my
[1:22:53] brother branham he said in these chairs
[1:22:54] first mentioned was placed at the east
[1:22:57] gate of the garden going four ways
[1:23:00] there's the Garden of Eden and this is
[1:23:02] the gate right here opens up swings out
[1:23:05] and at this gate there was the cherubims
[1:23:07] cherubims and remember doesn't say are
[1:23:09] cherubim it said cherubims cherubs was
[1:23:12] placed there to guard what the Tree of
[1:23:14] Life that's what they was to guard the
[1:23:17] way of the Tree of Life the way and who
[1:23:20] is the way Jesus where is it reflected
[1:23:24] from here is the holy place here are the
[1:23:28] cherubim so the throne of God where's
[1:23:30] the way reflected at at the throne of
[1:23:32] God now here I just put this picture so
[1:23:34] you can see it here so here's the
[1:23:36] cherubims now I don't know if this
[1:23:38] pictures right it was the most modest
[1:23:39] picture I could find so that's why I use
[1:23:41] this one all the other ones you know
[1:23:42] they got them half-naked and the Bible
[1:23:44] said they wore coats of skin and if you
[1:23:46] look up coats it actually means a cloak
[1:23:47] it means a whole entire cloak like a
[1:23:50] whole tyre piece of clothes not just you
[1:23:52] know I'm half naked like the worldly
[1:23:54] people you know that's how they think so
[1:23:56] behind the chair behind the throne
[1:23:59] guards you had the holiest of Holies so
[1:24:02] these are on the east side and you'd
[1:24:04] have to go you're going west but the
[1:24:06] first thing you meet going west in the
[1:24:08] Holies of Holies will be the throne
[1:24:10] guards they're placed at the eastern
[1:24:13] gate right north east south west here so
[1:24:16] they're at the east and then you go
[1:24:18] further west and you go into the holiest
[1:24:21] of Holies here buddy say Amen Brinson so
[1:24:24] this is the same thing we have in the
[1:24:26] days of Moses so you the there's
[1:24:31] protection here on the east side before
[1:24:32] you come into the
[1:24:34] Holies of Holies here's the holiest of
[1:24:35] holies and it's the same idea in the
[1:24:38] Garden of Eden they're the the presence
[1:24:40] of God here they had cherubims here at
[1:24:42] the east to protect as you went in okay
[1:24:46] and brother Branham says the protection
[1:24:49] of Israel look like this I love this
[1:24:51] picture this is one of the most
[1:24:52] beautiful pictures I think I've ever
[1:24:53] seen in my life outside of you know this
[1:24:55] and the pillar of fire everything like
[1:24:57] that don't you love this this is how
[1:24:59] here's the Friends of God here's the
[1:25:01] hallways of always and here's East and
[1:25:03] West North is this way Dan he had the
[1:25:06] flying eagle anointing over here he had
[1:25:08] the Eagle standard but Miriam said
[1:25:11] Israel over here was protected this was
[1:25:14] the guard to the mercy seat God always
[1:25:17] has protection to the mercy seat that's
[1:25:20] what the brother man taught there so you
[1:25:22] had to go west if you're going west here
[1:25:23] you have to go through the guard here to
[1:25:26] get to the holiest of Holies and this is
[1:25:29] what Balaam saw when he looked down he
[1:25:31] said I see he said I see Israel as a
[1:25:33] unicorn in her power he said he said how
[1:25:38] can I curse whom God is blessed and we
[1:25:40] looked down he saw the cross of Jesus
[1:25:42] Christ hey men who can curse the cross
[1:25:44] of Christ nobody can't because it was
[1:25:47] the cross that took our curses amen
[1:25:50] he took the curses upon him that take
[1:25:53] our curses that we might be blessed amen
[1:25:55] that's exactly right
[1:25:58] so brother Aaron says so the Ark of the
[1:26:01] Covenant the Friends of God always had a
[1:26:04] guard around it I love that hmm
[1:26:07] hallelujah I just thought this makes you
[1:26:08] want to shout glory glory amen glory God
[1:26:12] always protecting is no matter where you
[1:26:14] come there's always protection look
[1:26:16] there's four groups right four camps
[1:26:18] there's four beasts right always
[1:26:20] protecting the throne of God amen throne
[1:26:23] guards hallelujah now Berta said why
[1:26:27] brother I said now watch put all this
[1:26:28] down here's the holiest of Holies Holies
[1:26:32] voice this is the holy place here's the
[1:26:34] sea and here is the light candles he
[1:26:38] said the seven that's reflect the light
[1:26:40] from here in here now brother I was
[1:26:41] going to the earthly through I'm sorry
[1:26:43] the heavenly throne which is this
[1:26:45] picture but I'll come back to it sober
[1:26:46] man's coming to this pick
[1:26:48] sure how you got to come last here from
[1:26:49] the they have protection on the east now
[1:26:51] remember they're stable now they're not
[1:26:53] moving anymore they're not rolling
[1:26:55] around they're stable and so to get to
[1:26:57] God's presence you had to go west
[1:26:58] but God has protection throne guards in
[1:27:01] the east there Barry see that all right
[1:27:05] now that was the best picture I could
[1:27:07] find there for the the four beasts let's
[1:27:11] finish this quote nah didn't finish this
[1:27:12] quote he said here he said here here
[1:27:15] here where where it were I'm sorry why
[1:27:17] are they reflect they are guarding and
[1:27:19] reflecting with the fire of God the way
[1:27:22] to the Tree of Life amen see it can't
[1:27:26] come from over here Presbyterian
[1:27:28] seminary Pentecost Caesarea
[1:27:29] it's got to come from here reflecting
[1:27:32] the light alright so see the light has
[1:27:36] to be reflected from the throne of God
[1:27:37] not from a seminary but from the throne
[1:27:40] of God amen glory and so the protection
[1:27:43] again is on the east going west
[1:27:46] the protection is on the east now it's
[1:27:49] stationary now okay so now you notice
[1:27:52] these cherubs that John saw here must
[1:27:54] have been interested in keeping the way
[1:27:57] of the Tree of Life so they must be
[1:28:01] interested in human beings amen
[1:28:03] I'm glad the holy ghost is interested in

[1:28:27] different time periods kind of

[1:28:34] darkness and placing us into the kingdom

[1:29:39] an altar now this must have been an
[1:29:43] altar at the Garden of Eden I'll tell
[1:29:47] you I do you remember both Cain and Abel
[1:29:49] come up here to worship so that shows
[1:29:51] God's altar was moved and set here at
[1:29:54] the Garden of Eden and the only way back
[1:29:57] to Eden is by the altar here you are
[1:30:00] again see back to Eden through the altar
[1:30:03] and they were to keep that way their
[1:30:06] guard it and they couldn't get back
[1:30:08] there until the altar was covered with
[1:30:10] blood oh my he said Oh God can't people
[1:30:14] see it see nothing but the blood a man
[1:30:19] had nothing but the blood there has to
[1:30:22] be an atonement a mercy seat there this
[1:30:25] altar of judgment must become a mercy
[1:30:27] seat and when this altar if the blood is
[1:30:30] lifted there will stand on that date
[1:30:32] Judgment Day the fire of God's wrath to
[1:30:34] guard that tree again only one thing
[1:30:38] will enter into this gate to eat again
[1:30:39] will be through the blood of Jesus
[1:30:42] Christ do you see it glory
[1:30:45] now notice let's say our feet I'll stop
[1:30:47] right here he said now notice yeah
[1:30:50] here's Cain here's Abel all right now
[1:30:53] both boys come up to this gate to
[1:30:55] worship is that right so it must have
[1:30:57] been God's altar is that right and
[1:30:59] before this altar they built stationery
[1:31:01] another altar but he said here's the
[1:31:05] true altar of God is in the heart of man
[1:31:07] this is the altar he wants to live in
[1:31:10] now we went through this a few weeks ago
[1:31:11] that altar in heaven stationary that's
[1:31:13] the true altar but
[1:31:15] God wants a true tabernacle he can live
[1:31:17] in today and that's the heart of man
[1:31:20] glory then there's another altar down
[1:31:24] here which was representing the holiest
[1:31:28] of Holies in the holy place to see all
[1:31:31] these other altars were just
[1:31:32] representing the real altar of God
[1:31:35] remember man tells the true altar now is
[1:31:38] in the heart of man that's the altar for
[1:31:40] the New Testament is in the heart of man
[1:31:42] let's go one more thought here I got one
[1:31:44] more thought here let me bring it I just
[1:31:46] I will preach on these later by just I
[1:31:48] love all these pictures I just I don't
[1:31:50] lie to you but I'm a visual learner when
[1:31:51] I see this I just get excited you see
[1:31:53] the cross again you know with the
[1:31:54] tabernacle the holiest of all ways I
[1:31:56] just love that that's not let's end with
[1:31:59] this stuff this last thought program
[1:32:01] said that that these cherubims are
[1:32:03] tireless and all they do is they cry
[1:32:05] holy holy holy unto the Lord Ram said
[1:32:10] they were tireless they never grew tired
[1:32:13] they couldn't be anything connected with
[1:32:15] man he grows tired
[1:32:18] anybody tired today been flapping your
[1:32:22] wings awfully hard battled the devil
[1:32:23] yeah you have days like that you have
[1:32:26] days where the wind doesn't seem to blow
[1:32:27] like it like it does some days yeah I
[1:32:30] get tired to church he said they
[1:32:34] couldn't
[1:32:34] anything connected with man he grows
[1:32:35] tired but they were tireless and they
[1:32:37] sang holy holy holy holy holy holy holy
[1:32:41] holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy
[1:32:45] holy all day and all night through every
[1:32:49] age holy by he managed that since
[1:32:54] brother BAM died what 50 some years ago
[1:32:56] they're still crying holy every night
[1:32:57] all day holy holy holy since Saint Paul
[1:33:02] was here 2,000 years ago they still been
[1:33:05] crying holy holy holy is the Lord God
[1:33:08] Almighty God the loves to hear how he's
[1:33:10] holy you know Church I know about you
[1:33:12] but when I pray and I started talking
[1:33:13] about how whole praising God for His
[1:33:15] Holiness I started to feel really
[1:33:16] release I started feeling really sincere
[1:33:19] I start feeling the sweetness of the
[1:33:21] Holy Spirit as anyone ever felt that
[1:33:22] before because you recognize how unholy
[1:33:26] your flesh is and it places God in the
[1:33:30] right position it humbles you to realize
[1:33:32] well I thought bad thoughts I said bad
[1:33:34] things I did some evil things I should
[1:33:36] have done this you start it starts
[1:33:38] humbling you placing you in your spot
[1:33:40] and it actually starts helping you to
[1:33:42] worship God and reminding you how holy
[1:33:45] he is that's exactly right that's how
[1:33:47] I've noticed that my prayer life over
[1:33:49] the last you know 18 years or 16 years
[1:33:51] or so when I start praising God for his
[1:33:53] holiness and say I'm nothing I'm dirty
[1:33:56] forgive me you know wash me all these
[1:33:58] things it just brings me the presence of
[1:34:00] God because God loves to hear holy holy
[1:34:03] holy is his name he said let's go
[1:34:08] let's go back I got a scripture Isaiah 6
[1:34:10] watch he said Isaiah saw the same thing
[1:34:12] exactly you memorize this and the year
[1:34:14] that King Uzziah died
[1:34:16] I also the Lord I also saw the Lord
[1:34:18] sitting on a throne high lifted up and
[1:34:20] his train for the temple above it said
[1:34:23] the seraphim's
[1:34:24] now remember seraphim's were the burners
[1:34:27] they're the ones that took the coals off
[1:34:29] the altar now it's what's amazing to me
[1:34:32] is that Isaiah seeing a vision here and
[1:34:35] in the vision he gets a supernatural
[1:34:37] touch of the Holy Ghost he gets a coal
[1:34:38] on his is that it's theophany what is
[1:34:42] that what what is that because it wasn't
[1:34:46] a natural call it was a spiritual call
[1:34:48] or some some type of eternal call are
[1:34:51] you with me
[1:34:51] how does that happen all's I know is
[1:34:54] Lord let that coal touch me amen I
[1:34:56] believe it already has but I'm saying if
[1:34:58] I need a fresh touch then Lord send
[1:35:00] another coal from the altar amen and let
[1:35:03] me feel the presence of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:04] amen
[1:35:05] but now seraphim's each was six weeks so
[1:35:09] now you have cherubims of six wings and
[1:35:11] now you got seraphim's have six wings
[1:35:13] and with twain he covered his face and
[1:35:16] twain he covered his feet we remember
[1:35:18] that from influence and with 20/20 did
[1:35:20] fly and one cried unto another and said
[1:35:23] holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the
[1:35:27] whole earth is full of his glory so now
[1:35:30] we both have cherubims crying holy holy
[1:35:32] holy and we have seraphim's crying holy
[1:35:35] holy holy so God has even more angelic
[1:35:39] angels just praising him for his
[1:35:41] holiness how much should we praise him
[1:35:43] for his holiness so see seraphim's and
[1:35:47] chairman's both cry holy because the
[1:35:49] Bible said these four beasts and my man
[1:35:51] said their cherubims corn Ezekiel 10
[1:35:54] both chairs cherubims and seraphim's
[1:35:56] crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[1:36:00] amen let's close with that about the
[1:36:02] grace of God how many want to say how
