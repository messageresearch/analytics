[0:00] for uh I'll tell you what uh we sure
[0:06] really just put the house of Hell at Bay
[0:08] didn't
[0:10] we we told the house of Hell to
[0:14] giveway and uh by God's grace uh we we
[0:17] see how God's love uh just how it just
[0:21] moves mightily on his children I trust
[0:23] you can say this morning I ain't tired
[0:25] yet I'm not tired yet that's right amen
[0:28] it's good to see brother Austin sister
[0:29] Lena
[0:30] married now praise the Lord amen
[0:35] yeah we rejoice and uh uh we're
[0:38] rejoicing of what the Lord's doing here
[0:40] uh you know you come and visit and you
[0:42] just uh uh hear the wonderful worship
[0:45] the wonderful love for God the wonderful
[0:46] love for the hearing of the word hey
[0:48] look at that praise the Living God I'm
[0:51] very excited now amen all
[0:54] right
[0:56] uh you do a lot of work making a
[0:58] PowerPoint it's good to get it to the
[1:01] people and uh that our work was not in
[1:05] vain and uh this morning uh we just like
[1:08] to say once again we just uh we love
[1:10] every single one of you uh you're very
[1:12] precious people I I really believe with
[1:14] all of my heart uh that we're we're not
[1:18] called to be in the general Resurrection
[1:20] we're called to be in the first
[1:21] resurrection together and I believe that
[1:24] that's what the Lord is doing here he's
[1:26] uh raising his children up in Revelation
[1:28] and understanding I must have preached
[1:31] long last night because they're working
[1:32] on that clock right
[1:33] [Laughter]
[1:38] now so we'll try to be mindful of your
[1:41] time today and uh but yet I I want to uh
[1:45] uh the Lord just kind of impressed
[1:47] another thought on my heart uh today for
[1:49] you and you know how I am I uh that's
[1:52] hearing me preach I I love to tie
[1:54] everything in with the word of God Amen
[1:56] and I what I love about it is that uh
[1:59] you know brother the brandom hit
[2:00] highlights and he and he brought things
[2:02] into a spot where uh he basically showed
[2:05] us what God wanted to do um and
[2:08] ultimately the plan of it but when you
[2:10] actually dive into the scripture you
[2:11] actually see it's Fuller and richer uh
[2:14] than the Highlight he brought it's
[2:15] actually he hit exactly what it was but
[2:17] when we get in the Bible we find that
[2:18] this is actually more than what I
[2:20] thought it was before and uh today we're
[2:22] going to work with that type of idea and
[2:25] uh via a very simple sermon I'm going to
[2:27] approach this in two ideas as far as um
[2:30] one to the church uh to the bride and
[2:32] then I'm going to go to the individual
[2:35] uh and then uh by the Lord's help uh uh
[2:38] this is just something uh that the Lord
[2:39] really blessed me with and uh I know
[2:42] he's blessed our church at home with
[2:44] this idea last night was a something uh
[2:46] he gave me on the way over here I hadn't
[2:48] preached at anywhere but uh uh today uh
[2:51] we're going to just kind of put some
[2:52] things together for you and we trust uh
[2:55] uh if you ain't tired yet just uh just
[2:57] rejoice in the holy spirit being here uh
[2:59] re rejoice in his word to you and uh
[3:02] I'll tell you what if if we can start
[3:04] building that atmosphere of Faith uh
[3:06] then God can really really do a mighty
[3:08] work today I don't know about you I'm
[3:10] not satisfied with with yesterday or
[3:12] last week's experience amen uh brother
[3:15] brandom said he said we should never be
[3:17] comfortable with W with an experience in
[3:19] the past that's he said we can't be
[3:22] satisfied you that you receed the Holy
[3:23] Ghost 10 years ago and just move on from
[3:25] there we need God to constantly just
[3:28] pour His Spirit out on us
[3:30] and we're coming to that just like we
[3:31] showed last night it's getting smaller
[3:33] but the power is growing amen hallelujah
[3:36] so if you have your Bibles uh exus
[3:40] 20:2 might be a little bit of a strange
[3:43] uh uh on my computer I have everything
[3:46] in highlights and underlines but when I
[3:48] put it on here it doesn't have any of
[3:49] that uh so I'll just try to emphasize it
[3:52] myself uh here it is what looks like the
[3:54] Ten Commandments now don't
[3:56] it uh I want you to see this uh uh I'm
[4:00] going to focus right here in Exodus 2015
[4:03] Thou shalt not
[4:04] steal okay and uh we'll follow this idea
[4:08] today um Exodus 20:12 says honor thy
[4:12] father and thy mother uh that thy days
[4:14] may be long upon the land which the Lord
[4:17] thy God giveth
[4:18] thee Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not
[4:22] commit adultery and uh we'll focus right
[4:25] here on the 15th verse it says Thou
[4:27] shalt not steal all right I ain't
[4:32] calling anybody thieves here
[4:34] today but I know there is a great Thief
[4:38] it's the
[4:39] devil Hallelujah now watch this is God's
[4:42] righteousness coming out Thou shalt not
[4:45] steal well I
[4:47] wonder if there is a
[4:49] thief then what will God do to
[4:54] recompense that which was
[4:56] stolen we're going to follow this idea
[4:58] today
[5:00] I trust that you'll be blessed uh Joel 1
[5:05] verse4 we hear a lot about restoration
[5:10] and uh today I'm going to bring this in
[5:11] a little bit of a different way for you
[5:13] because uh what I find out is you know
[5:15] brother brandom hit restoration but this
[5:17] actually goes all over the place and uh
[5:19] I want to build your expectation for
[5:21] something
[5:24] okay we'll get to this after a little
[5:26] bit here but like I said I'm going to
[5:28] start with the seven Church AG
[5:30] uh move that in on into the even uh your
[5:32] church uh and and this is one of the
[5:34] things God was working with me I'm like
[5:36] cuz you can actually see the condition
[5:38] of your
[5:39] church by tying it in with
[5:43] restoration and when I say that that's
[5:45] that's the message the restoration of
[5:46] the Bride tree so you'll be able to tell
[5:49] you'll see exactly where you're at as a
[5:51] body amen is that possible yes sir do we
[5:55] do we just aimlessly walk around in any
[5:58] certain direction or or did God give us
[6:00] enough understanding to be able to
[6:02] identify where we're at okay so you can
[6:05] see already I'm taking a little bit
[6:06] different route but you know I'm going
[6:07] to get
[6:10] excited I can't help
[6:14] myself quicker you get the you you you
[6:16] pull on the word and and get that
[6:17] anointing Brewing the worships already
[6:19] done it now you just keep on with that
[6:22] worship towards God right Joel 1 verse4
[6:25] says that which the palor hath left hath
[6:27] the Locust eaten and that which the
[6:28] Locust
[6:30] left hath the can cankerworm eaten and
[6:32] that which the cankerworm hath left hath
[6:35] the caterpillar eaten all right uh you
[6:39] know there's two places that this is
[6:41] brought in it's brought in here in Joel
[6:44] one and then it's also expressed in Joel
[6:46] 2:25 but brother brand actually made it
[6:49] all when he preached restoration of the
[6:50] brid tree he actually worked with it in
[6:52] this order they're in different orders
[6:54] okay so let's bow our heads for a word
[6:56] of prayer and we'll get right to where
[6:58] the Lord has led us this
[7:01] morning Lord Jesus we we humbly come
[7:03] before you right now Lord and uh it's a
[7:07] great hour to live and to know Lord that
[7:11] that and as I'm looking at this what I
[7:14] am seeing Oh God is I am seeing oh God
[7:16] the pattern that that the followers that
[7:20] followed the message and what they have
[7:23] done they've actually allowed things to
[7:25] be scattered instead of just following
[7:28] the message in the messenger they've
[7:30] placed their own human ideas into things
[7:33] and Lord we
[7:34] realize that Lord we're in an hour where
[7:38] your word just as brother Brandon
[7:40] ministered it is just as applicable
[7:43] today as it was when he was here that
[7:46] means we can expect you to do the same
[7:49] things Lord uh the same things that you
[7:52] did in that Ministry you can do here
[7:54] Lord uh and yet Lord even within all
[7:57] those highlights sewn God it was your
[8:00] desire to show us the way back lord uh
[8:03] to what the acts church had Lord because
[8:06] that was a body in full demonstration of
[8:10] your power and might to a generation
[8:12] that was UNT the scripture says so Lord
[8:15] we're just asking this morning that you
[8:17] uh just anoint the words to be spoken
[8:19] Lord and and Lord I I always say it like
[8:21] this I I believe and I and I feel like
[8:23] you're leading me this way oh God but
[8:25] Lord uh I want to be free to be able to
[8:27] go wherever you want me Lord Lord so I'm
[8:29] asking today oh God that you'd move me
[8:32] however thou willst Lord I am I am just
[8:35] clay You Are The Potter Lord just like
[8:38] these people here Lord these great
[8:39] saints of God lord they are just clay
[8:42] and You Are The Potter Lord so form us
[8:45] into the image of Thy word oh God make
[8:48] us so we could be vessels constantly
[8:50] filled with your spirit filled up oh God
[8:52] so that we can be put in service for you
[8:55] in the name of Jesus Christ the church
[8:56] says together amen you may be seated
[9:04] I like this guy's
[9:07] face
[9:09] Amen in a way it kind of almost looks
[9:11] like Malachi without
[9:15] glasses but today we're going to uh work
[9:19] with this idea um the law of restoration
[9:25] okay and uh we want to focus today on
[9:28] the restored and uh we're going to bring
[9:31] this in a direction uh that I want to
[9:33] build your
[9:35] expectation uh in what you perceive that
[9:38] God wants to do for you all right uh a
[9:40] lot of times we we place ourselves at uh
[9:44] that we say oh God I just would really
[9:46] just like for you know something to be
[9:49] restored I'd like to have that back um
[9:52] but the scripture actually paints a very
[9:55] powerful uh image before us uh so what
[9:58] we're going to do is we're going to tie
[9:59] in all these things and uh working with
[10:02] the law of restoration uh this Mo this
[10:06] afternoon we want to start just by
[10:08] defining it um to restore is to return
[10:11] to a person uh as a specific thing uh
[10:15] which he has lost all right so in order
[10:18] to receive
[10:19] restoration you have to realize that
[10:22] something has been taken away
[10:25] amen I don't know about what you expect
[10:29] your church to be like amen but uh if
[10:33] you can see what the words said about
[10:36] the acts church that is actually what
[10:39] God made you to be amen he made you to
[10:43] be filled with power amen filled with
[10:47] demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen
[10:50] hallelujah in such a way that the gifts
[10:53] of the Spirit would be working through
[10:55] here just like they were in brother
[10:58] Brandon Ministry amen hallelujah I'd
[11:02] love to preach it but uh you realize
[11:04] there is a thus sayith the Lord that is
[11:07] to move through this Ley amen when
[11:10] brother brandham talked about the the
[11:12] the the the local body coming under the
[11:15] gifts of the Spirit he said they would
[11:17] work exactly like his gift that's right
[11:21] that tongues would come forth Amen on
[11:24] somebody and then another person would
[11:27] what interpret it and they' Sally Jones
[11:30] there's going to be a hurricane that's
[11:32] going to come through you stay away from
[11:34] it and go a different
[11:36] direction it would be the discernment of
[11:40] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[11:43] and it would make you bypass things amen
[11:46] it would make you avoid unnecessary
[11:49] Temptations and
[11:52] trials that was the Holy Ghost working
[11:56] in the original Church
[12:00] and I tell you if you don't see it today
[12:03] what do you need you need to be
[12:07] restored do you see what's
[12:11] yours God made it your right by his Holy
[12:16] Ghost and you're yielding to it that you
[12:18] would see this gospel in full effect as
[12:21] it's ever
[12:23] [Music]
[12:24] been so now you see what you are
[12:27] supposed to manifest what you're
[12:29] supposed to make known you're supposed
[12:30] to make it known to one another you're
[12:32] supposed to make it known to anybody
[12:34] that ever comes in here or whether
[12:36] you're out and about you are called to
[12:38] make known Jesus Christ the same Jesus
[12:42] Christ to the world
[12:44] Amen now watch this let's
[12:47] begin in Joel
[12:50] 2:25 this is a very powerful thing which
[12:53] we in the message have a true
[12:55] understanding of which is so beautiful
[12:56] it says and I will restore to you you
[12:59] the years that the Locust hath eaten the
[13:02] cankerworm the caterpillar and the
[13:04] palmerworm my great Army which I sent
[13:07] among you God claims it as what his
[13:13] army and what he sent it to them don't
[13:17] you hey brother sister don't get it
[13:19] wrong
[13:20] amen God in the Book of Job he let Satan
[13:25] have
[13:27] job because because he wanted to
[13:31] show just as he did Death burial and
[13:35] Resurrection it's always God's move to
[13:39] take away so that he can
[13:42] restore amen at the end we're going to
[13:44] get to how
[13:45] much Hallelujah but I want you to see
[13:49] this because he said he would restore
[13:53] what he allowed to happen amen amen
[13:57] yes now watch your this paints a very
[13:59] beautiful picture in the church age book
[14:01] it says now it says God is going to
[14:04] restore the Lutheran age did not restore
[14:07] the church it started a Reformation the
[14:10] Wesleyan age did not restore the
[14:12] Pentecostal age did not restore but God
[14:15] has to restore for he cannot deny his
[14:19] word amen amen hallelujah so if you have
[14:22] not seen the original acts Church in
[14:25] expression that tells you right there
[14:28] that the restoration hasn't fully come
[14:30] yet yes and if you identify yourself in
[14:33] the bride then it has to happen to you
[14:36] [Laughter]
[14:39] amen so he says this is not the
[14:43] resurrection of the church it is the
[14:46] restoration now God will take the church
[14:49] right back to Pentecost of the beginning
[14:52] all right so you have to be that you
[14:54] will be that you might as well say I am
[14:57] that amen Hallelujah just like they
[14:59] asked that police officer with a billy
[15:01] club they said they said can you point
[15:03] us to the Revival he said I am the
[15:07] Revival Hallelujah I am the Welsh
[15:10] Revival
[15:13] amen you are the bride's Revival for
[15:17] this age
[15:20] amen you've received that so you have to
[15:23] what get in conditioned to the
[15:25] identification of the word which you are
[15:28] am amen am Hallelujah now watch he says
[15:33] verse 25 it tells us why we need
[15:35] restoration why do we need restoration
[15:37] the Locust cankerworm caterpillar Palm
[15:39] worm have eaten all but the root and a
[15:42] small bit of the stem now we are told
[15:45] now watch this it's underlined here said
[15:47] now now where we at now we are told that
[15:50] the that all these insects are all one
[15:54] and the same in different stages right
[15:58] not he's going to identify what this is
[16:01] okay now I I'm going to bring you route
[16:03] CU I remember I the things I open up
[16:04] with I got to tell you all right so he
[16:07] says that is right so what are these
[16:10] insects right watch what what he says he
[16:13] says they are the Antichrist spirit
[16:16] manifested in organization denomination
[16:19] and false Doctrine Through the
[16:21] Ages so he says those four bucks are
[16:25] nothing separate than the actual what
[16:29] then the the four movings of the
[16:32] Antichrist spirit in the church
[16:35] ages so we can look at one and then we
[16:39] can put the other there and they are all
[16:42] the
[16:44] same now this will paint a powerful
[16:47] picture for you and I'm going to try to
[16:48] be uh quick about it it says and that
[16:51] that poor little root and stalk is going
[16:54] to be restored God isn't going to plant
[16:56] a new church but is going to bring his
[16:58] or original planting back to Original
[17:00] Seed aren't you glad about that he is
[17:02] doing it as stated in verse 23 by the
[17:05] teaching or former Reign so we have to
[17:08] before we can get a latter Reign we have
[17:11] to what receive a teaching Reign amen
[17:14] that's what brother bram's Ministry was
[17:17] was to teach us the truth of the word
[17:21] amen and when that truth becomes a
[17:24] revelation then the church will stand to
[17:27] her feet amen
[17:29] remember Satan cannot fight Revelation
[17:32] that's right once you have Revelation he
[17:35] can't defeat you there
[17:38] anymore God because you have what joined
[17:40] with the word of who you
[17:42] are hallelujah how can I go back to the
[17:47] world I'm the
[17:49] bride how can I how can I move that
[17:53] direction My Flesh wants to but I've
[17:56] received something on the inside side
[17:59] that will not let me go back amen
[18:02] instead it tells me I can be excited for
[18:05] this word that I can be victorious in
[18:08] this word and that the very Authority
[18:12] that God said in his word I can have I
[18:14] have it
[18:16] amen hallelujah the demons shall be cast
[18:20] out Hallelujah the demons should be set
[18:23] Ablaze amen by the power of the
[18:27] resurrection of Jesus Christ who has
[18:29] Quicken you
[18:33] amen
[18:34] hallelujah now watch next will come the
[18:39] Harvest rain of rapturing Faith amen it
[18:42] can't come until the the word that has
[18:46] been SW to us is
[18:48] received in
[18:50] Revelation that's why brother sister
[18:52] I've preached this at home church
[18:53] already but I got very interested in
[18:56] this because
[18:59] I watched when brother brandham died I
[19:02] watched the message split off in 5 10
[19:05] routes now I'm not saying that anybody
[19:07] is not saved or or anybody's not there
[19:09] or anybody's not Bri I'm not saying that
[19:12] but you know what I did I watched Junior
[19:14] Jackson is study this up I watched
[19:15] Junior Jackson go this way I watched Lee
[19:17] Vale go this
[19:19] way I watched Perry green go this way
[19:22] and everybody claims they have the right
[19:25] Doctrine come on I watch Joseph call and
[19:28] go this
[19:29] way right come
[19:31] on Hallelujah you know when when I when
[19:35] the first time I was told that I was
[19:38] going to be a a
[19:39] preacher I was in the message uh down in
[19:43] down in
[19:44] Lima and there was a
[19:47] brother a brother came up to me after
[19:49] service one night and uh he came up to
[19:53] me and he said God bless you my name is
[19:56] so and so I'm not I'm not going to say
[19:57] anything there he said my name is so and
[19:59] so I said God bless you brother pleasure
[20:01] to meet you he said he Saidi just going
[20:03] to cut the chase did you know that God
[20:05] has ordained you to be a
[20:07] preacher I said no sir he said I'm
[20:11] telling you right now he said the Lord
[20:13] told me to tell you that you were
[20:15] ordained to be a preacher
[20:19] right and I was like
[20:23] oh little old
[20:27] me
[20:29] now I got to turn to this that's why I'm
[20:31] telling
[20:32] this so we talked a little bit
[20:35] fellowship and then he walked off and
[20:37] then I had a brother come up to me from
[20:41] the church sweetest brother ever and he
[20:44] came up to me and he said brother cam do
[20:46] you know who that
[20:47] is I said no but he just prophesied that
[20:50] I was going to be a
[20:52] preacher and he said brother you stay
[20:55] away from that brother I said why is
[20:57] that
[20:58] he said he's a seven Thunder believer I
[21:01] said what's that he says it's just some
[21:03] crazy Doctrine it's just a crazy
[21:06] Doctrine for the king and so you know
[21:09] what I did I said yes
[21:13] sir and I stayed away from
[21:16] it and I stayed away from that brother
[21:18] because he told me
[21:22] to oh wow are we
[21:25] quiet but what is that that's
[21:30] denominationalism over the last 15 years
[21:33] I've asked probably 8 10 people I even
[21:35] asked people that were in the seventh
[21:37] ther movement what they believe no one
[21:39] knows what they
[21:41] believe this says well I think it's this
[21:43] you went to a a seventh Thunder church
[21:45] for 10 years and that's all you
[21:47] understand about
[21:48] it what do you know about coming
[21:51] here how could the people be in a spot
[21:55] that they have no clue what they
[21:57] believe
[22:02] Hallelujah even before I came here I I
[22:04] started watching Junior Jackson I'm like
[22:07] okay what what's this brother all about
[22:09] and I watched him and and right after
[22:11] that I I I got in contact I had a
[22:13] brother coming up from from
[22:14] Jeffersonville area and he's preached
[22:16] for me and I said I said uh what about
[22:17] Junior jocks he said oh brother they're
[22:19] way off in right field but I listened to
[22:21] three of his sermons I didn't hear
[22:23] anything
[22:24] wrong and I'm like what is all
[22:26] this
[22:30] what I'm trying to tell you is
[22:32] denominationalism has swept the
[22:34] message stay away stay away from Brother
[22:37] cam stay away from that brother Jesse
[22:42] guy
[22:44] right I'm telling you brother sister
[22:48] brother brandom did not come to tell us
[22:50] to
[22:51] separate he came to show us the fullness
[22:54] of the word and even if we different
[22:58] we're different in our thoughts it
[23:00] should never stop love from coming forth
[23:03] from our life and I'm waking up to this
[23:06] purpose because actually what I was
[23:09] dealing with un unknowned is I was
[23:12] dealing with Locust can rooms
[23:13] caterpillars and Palmer
[23:15] worms and I didn't even know it now let
[23:19] me take this a little bit and and I
[23:21] don't want to only preach on this I got
[23:22] a lot to say but I I want you to I
[23:24] preach a whole series on this and and I
[23:26] want to sew in just a little bit okay
[23:28] cuz I want you to see you can tell where
[23:30] people in the message are and you can
[23:32] tell where your own church
[23:34] is brother brandham said that the Palmer
[23:38] worm was the same as the Antichrist
[23:40] Spirit he said the Locust was the same
[23:44] as the Antichrist Spirit he said the TM
[23:47] was the same as the Antichrist Spirit
[23:49] the ciller was the same as the
[23:51] Antichrist Spirit now watch this cuz
[23:54] what I'm going to show you is it is
[23:56] organization that took God away from the
[24:01] church then they would have a form of
[24:04] godliness and deny the power thereof now
[24:07] if we know our Bible the Bible says from
[24:09] such turn away
[24:12] amen you have a right to the what the
[24:15] truth of the word amen you have a right
[24:17] to the power of God that's why
[24:20] restoration is so important
[24:24] amen hallelujah now what I found was so
[24:28] amazing about all this and like I said I
[24:29] got sermons for each one one to two but
[24:32] uh brother Braham started out in the
[24:33] restoration briad Tre preaching on the
[24:35] palor he said what did that word that
[24:37] worm do he said he took away the
[24:40] fruit when you get into the Deeds of the
[24:42] nickan it's the first step into
[24:47] death where the power begins to not
[24:50] manifest like it's supposed to in the
[24:52] church why because they start to what
[24:56] separate the leader from the Ley right
[25:01] he's smarter than y
[25:03] all he knows more look at how he can
[25:08] preach there's no
[25:11] separation between the L and the
[25:17] preacher if you want to go back in
[25:19] brother Jesse's office and read the
[25:21] quote on the wall brother Bram said he
[25:23] said he is actually a servant and he was
[25:25] actually lesser than them all cuz he was
[25:27] a public
[25:30] servant
[25:32] hallelujah amen but I want you to see
[25:35] this what it took away was the Fruit of
[25:37] the Spirit and the power of God right
[25:39] read the message go into the message
[25:41] find it out next was the Locust and
[25:43] brother Bram said what the Locust eat
[25:45] the
[25:46] leaves what were the leaves now you can
[25:48] tell so here's what I'm saying if you
[25:51] don't have the full fruits of the spirit
[25:52] in this church the gifts of the
[25:54] Spirit we still haven't come out of that
[25:58] brother cam I don't I don't brother
[26:01] sister it's a spirit that
[26:03] moves it tells the Ley that they don't
[26:06] have to do
[26:08] anything right it's a spirit that moves
[26:11] oh brother Jesse he's supposed to do all
[26:15] that you are the
[26:18] body each one of you are called every
[26:21] joint
[26:22] supplieth you can't get away from it
[26:24] brother sister that is what God called
[26:27] you you to be in action amen he called
[26:31] you to carry the work of God Amen
[26:33] Hallelujah you realize you're Pastor
[26:35] he's not even called to come out here
[26:38] and what anoint you you are called Amen
[26:40] to have an anointing before he even gets
[26:43] here
[26:44] amen hallelujah you're called amen that
[26:48] the Holy Ghost can bring healing during
[26:50] your worship Services amen with when
[26:53] your preachers back out there amen he's
[26:55] the same yesterday today forever
[27:00] amen so you can identify where you're at
[27:03] my church we're still trying to get out
[27:05] of these
[27:08] Deeds
[27:10] Hallelujah notice secondly it's what
[27:13] ties right with the doct Nick leans now
[27:15] it just becomes the way of doing things
[27:16] right yep there's a separation between
[27:18] the preacher and all them right but yet
[27:20] those leaves were fellowship and cooling
[27:23] so it begins to separate the
[27:25] people the leaves of
[27:28] Fellowship Hallelujah so when you find a
[27:32] church you got no
[27:34] Fellowship what's going
[27:37] on it's beginning to separate more and
[27:39] more now watch this because when you are
[27:42] right here with the fruit of God you are
[27:44] in
[27:45] unity yes you're working together you
[27:48] realize you got something to do
[27:50] Hallelujah you might have the pray an
[27:51] hour you might have to pray too but you
[27:53] follow the leading of the Lord because
[27:55] that is what that is needed to make the
[27:58] body what it needs to be there might be
[28:00] a fasting Warrior out in this church
[28:02] here amen and what that might be your
[28:04] call of all it to be fasting for the
[28:07] preachers amen remember brother brandom
[28:09] in one meeting he said he said for the
[28:11] powerful things that God has done these
[28:14] Services he said I'd like to give credit
[28:16] to these two sisters over here that were
[28:19] fasting and praying for these
[28:22] Services Hallelujah when that gift got
[28:25] into the spiritual Realm
[28:28] it found two sisters that broke through
[28:30] to God Amen and all those healings
[28:33] everything that was working it was
[28:35] working because the Ley had position
[28:40] amen hallelujah now I'm going to try to
[28:44] hurry up then third we have the canor
[28:48] which took away the bark right and
[28:50] brother Bram said uh that that was what
[28:53] that bark was the religion the covering
[28:55] the doctrine right and that's what do BM
[28:57] does very very simple balum taught the
[29:00] people to what commit spiritual
[29:02] fornication that's fornication but
[29:04] spiritual right amen so what you start
[29:07] getting down and all of a sudden we'll
[29:08] just do
[29:09] anything we will take the precepts of
[29:11] organization and Foster the message
[29:13] through
[29:14] it be careful now amen then lastly you
[29:19] have caterpillar I like said I'm going
[29:20] to hurry up and what the caterpillar
[29:22] actually got into the tree and began to
[29:24] eat all the life or the pulp out of the
[29:26] tree and what it ties right in with
[29:28] Jezebel which is spiritual death she
[29:31] began to die that was that fourth Church
[29:35] age amen they begin to die right now
[29:39] remember your rights are way up
[29:42] here you're called to have all of it but
[29:46] what did you need now notice somebody
[29:49] stole something away from
[29:52] you something made your church not what
[29:56] it was supposed to be
[29:58] amen but you still have the right and
[30:01] freedom to get back to what he called
[30:03] you to
[30:06] be Hallelujah Now watch how simple this
[30:10] is hallelujah when God started a
[30:12] restoration he brought justification
[30:15] amen now remember uh let me just say
[30:17] this real quickly because when God
[30:20] anointed brother brandom to show Who The
[30:22] Messengers were they had to have the
[30:24] same characteristics and they all were
[30:27] against
[30:30] organization they were all against what
[30:34] about placing man's will into the church
[30:38] but as soon as they passed on the church
[30:40] ran right with it they did it in the
[30:42] message too brother
[30:44] sister Hallelujah so first step
[30:48] back what justification now you get your
[30:51] church age books and you follow the
[30:52] quote there's a quote pattern it goes
[30:53] right through there and it what it
[30:55] brings it right back so jusic
[30:58] ation that bring your pull back
[31:01] spiritual death is
[31:03] gone you're not
[31:06] dead you feel de today you need to be
[31:09] restored
[31:12] amen hallelujah sanctification the bark
[31:15] was
[31:17] restored
[31:19] Hallelujah which is what so notice it
[31:21] comes up back reverse order all the way
[31:23] back out right okay so the bark was
[31:26] restored or what the Doctrine is
[31:28] beginning to be restored right then what
[31:31] then you have spiritual gifts come in
[31:33] and the the leaves of Fellowship
[31:37] right how come people in the message
[31:39] ain't got gifts like they ought
[31:41] to I'm telling you it went so quickly
[31:44] because right right when brother brandom
[31:45] passed off those things were just being
[31:47] settled in brandham Tabernacle Jesse
[31:50] know some of you Saints you study this
[31:51] out you find it right out he talked
[31:53] about all those people with the gifts
[31:54] and so forth how it's supposed to
[31:55] operate he laid it all out because they
[31:57] they were beginning to work in a certain
[31:59] way right
[32:02] Hallelujah so then it comes back to
[32:04] spiritual gifts the leaves restor
[32:06] because what it takes Unity brother
[32:08] sister brother Bram said he said we
[32:10] should have so many gifts in the church
[32:11] he said that that those that are gifted
[32:13] should meet a half hour to an hour
[32:15] before service and pray and seek God and
[32:17] let the gifts be used there amen and
[32:22] then he said then it should go to those
[32:24] with wisdom and the ability to what
[32:26] judge amen and they should judge them
[32:29] and then they should be read to the
[32:32] church and if all those gifts are
[32:34] working right then it will what prophesy
[32:37] to the
[32:38] people hallelujah it'll put things right
[32:41] down to the thoughts and intents of the
[32:43] heart to the church anybody want a
[32:46] church like
[32:49] that
[32:51] Hallelujah brother brandom said he said
[32:53] what he said it would call out somebody
[32:55] coming to the church and and tell what
[32:58] why they weren't getting their healing
[32:59] and what it was that they would get if
[33:01] they did it
[33:03] right it's a lot of sermons there
[33:05] brother and sister but but just just to
[33:07] just to hit highlights like the prophet
[33:08] hit highlights right and then lastly you
[33:11] have the word of God had to be
[33:13] restored Hallelujah and what that
[33:15] brought the fruit the fruit back so if
[33:18] we've received the truth of the word
[33:21] then why is it not
[33:23] producing or have we been what brought
[33:27] up in a message full of Creeds and
[33:30] dogmas
[33:34] ha uh I've come to understand and learn
[33:38] that that because of how things have
[33:41] went there have been many Creeds and
[33:44] dogmas brought right into the message of
[33:46] yahwah and all of them are based off
[33:50] quotes so what do you have to do study
[33:53] it
[33:54] out search it out find it out brother
[33:58] sister this is very important because it
[34:00] shows what God is trying to do with you
[34:04] Hallelujah don't ever expect anybody
[34:05] else to do your work God has an
[34:07] individual work he has for you all
[34:11] right
[34:13] Hallelujah get moving brother cam all
[34:15] right I sure will I want to sew that in
[34:18] there for about 15 minutes 20 and let
[34:22] you know what has happened in the
[34:24] message but where we're at right now is
[34:27] the words begin to unfold like never
[34:31] before Hallelujah God is what he's
[34:34] bringing to us come out of
[34:37] her come out of everything that
[34:39] Catholicism sewed in there with her
[34:42] daughters stay out of it amen and follow
[34:46] the perfect word now watch this Isaiah
[34:50] 42:18 now I'm going to turn now all
[34:51] right I'm going to go right back into
[34:54] into what God has for you uh as far as
[34:57] uh uh the heart of where I want to go
[34:58] with this all right uh Isaiah 42:18 says
[35:01] hear ye deaf and look ye blind that you
[35:04] may
[35:05] see I preached this here probably 10
[35:07] years ago as when you guys were in the
[35:09] other the other place I'm not g to focus
[35:12] on this but I want to hit the Highlight
[35:13] because but because look they're deaf
[35:15] and they're blind who is blind but my
[35:18] servant or deaf as my messenger that I
[35:21] sent who is blind as as he that is
[35:24] perfect and blind as the Lord's servant
[35:27] they can't hear and they can't
[35:29] see my seeing many things but thou
[35:34] observe us not sounds like Leo
[35:39] deia they're blind miserable wretched
[35:43] and they don't know
[35:45] it they don't know what the word has
[35:48] entitled them to they don't know what
[35:51] they don't care about
[35:54] it they're just what they just want to
[35:56] follow some sort of little message
[35:58] path we're called to receive the full
[36:03] unadulterated word
[36:07] amen hallelujah don't think that God
[36:10] can't bring it through your pastor amen
[36:13] don't think that God can ordain a
[36:14] five-fold Ministry to bring it in amen
[36:17] God is more than able to bring the
[36:20] fullness of the truth to you
[36:22] amen
[36:24] right
[36:25] Hallelujah I had a fellow preach a while
[36:28] back and I knew he was so full of dogmas
[36:31] and while he was preaching I just felt
[36:32] led to have him come and while he's
[36:34] preaching it just came on my heart like
[36:36] this this overwhelming feel feeling came
[36:38] to came to my heart and this feeling
[36:40] said he's going to preach some false
[36:42] doctrines you know what I
[36:45] did I closed my eyes and I said Lord
[36:50] hold that brother's mouth that he can
[36:52] only speak the
[36:55] truth
[37:02] and after I did that I watched that
[37:04] brother and and and he almost started
[37:06] fumbling with you could see he started
[37:07] fumbling with his thoughts a little bit
[37:10] and I watched when every time he brought
[37:12] his thought out he said something
[37:16] true and we got to the end of the
[37:19] service I said
[37:21] Hallelujah because that's my
[37:25] right amen that's my right as a
[37:29] preacher there was a lot of truth that
[37:31] came out and even brothers and message
[37:34] hey we have a commonality of the word
[37:37] that we can join
[37:40] together you don't think the power of
[37:42] our God who said all things are possible
[37:45] if you believe when he brings a thought
[37:47] to you you can't bind the mouth of the
[37:50] preacher to only say
[37:53] truth I'll tell you that's how power for
[37:57] the God we serve
[38:00] is
[38:02] hallelujah I had a brother in the church
[38:05] that knew that that brother preach all
[38:06] sorts of crazy stuff and he came up to
[38:09] me afterwards and he said he said
[38:11] brother I was so expecting for him to
[38:13] say something crazy and far out because
[38:16] he does it
[38:19] everywhere I looked at him and said yep
[38:21] yep Prayer Changes
[38:23] Things and I left it right there you're
[38:26] the first people I told about
[38:29] it Hallelujah but our God is able
[38:33] Amen to hold us to the word
[38:38] amen now watch these people seeing many
[38:41] things without servest not opening the
[38:43] ears but he heareth not the Lord is well
[38:46] pleased for his righteousness sake he
[38:48] will magnify the law and make it
[38:53] honorable he might have people that are
[38:56] blind and they can't hear a thing in
[38:58] this word amen but he's more than able
[39:00] to bring forth those that
[39:03] can they can see it and they can hear it
[39:06] amen now watch
[39:09] this but this is a people robbed and
[39:14] spoiled so when the people lose the
[39:16] ability to see the word to see the
[39:19] manifestation of the spirit to hear it
[39:21] to see it remember brother Jesse was the
[39:23] one that that he when he preached that
[39:25] so many years ago he he said he said uh
[39:27] uh and brought it out I never ever seen
[39:29] it like that and it still holds to me I
[39:31] still preach it I still preach exactly
[39:33] what my pastor of the of the years ago
[39:34] said but he said he said that Holy Ghost
[39:36] is now something you can see and hear
[39:39] right
[39:42] right Hallelujah from your life amen the
[39:46] Holy Ghost is something you can see and
[39:49] hear
[39:51] amen
[39:53] amen so if you can't see it on somebody
[39:56] you can't hear
[39:58] it there's something wrong with the Holy
[40:01] Ghost experience in that
[40:05] individual but I'll tell you you don't
[40:07] have to live that way you don't have to
[40:09] accept that way there's one thing you've
[40:12] got to do amen watch this the people
[40:15] were robbed and spoiled they are all of
[40:18] them snared in holes and they are HD in
[40:20] prison
[40:22] houses you are not called to be snared
[40:25] right trapped you are not called to what
[40:29] to feel like you're in a prison
[40:34] house there's one thing I should have
[40:36] said I should have said leica's B I like
[40:38] who's got it house the hell what else
[40:41] can we lose it's on my heart to say
[40:46] loneliness that's right amen
[40:49] hallelujah like you're caught up in some
[40:52] prison house and nobody understands you
[40:55] right brother God God understands you a
[40:58] lot of your brothers and sisters
[40:59] understand
[41:00] youall Hallelujah I feel like I'm the
[41:03] only one that's got to deal with that
[41:06] brother brandom said it's a complex amen
[41:09] but I'll tell you that Jesus Christ can
[41:11] set you free
[41:14] amen now I want you to watch the
[41:17] difference here oh my Hallelujah it says
[41:19] they are for a pray and none
[41:23] delivereth for a spoil and none
[41:28] saith
[41:31] restore they were
[41:34] completely
[41:35] satisfied in their snares and prison
[41:39] houses sitting right in the church right
[41:44] they were just fine not watching the
[41:46] communion of the Holy Ghost give them a
[41:48] smile that they couldn't get rid
[41:52] of why do I got to help that you
[41:56] shouldn't have to help
[41:59] that Jesus Christ's power gets in you in
[42:02] such a way remember in John 7 he said he
[42:04] shall it shall it shall flow from your
[42:07] belly as rivers of Living
[42:10] Water it's something that flows out of
[42:13] you this Holy
[42:15] Ghost I can't help but be happy I cannot
[42:19] help but praise the Lord
[42:22] amen hallelujah we never even
[42:25] experienced what Paul and Silas there
[42:28] they were in stocks and bonds amen but
[42:31] there they were praising the Lord
[42:34] singing his grace His Glory How Great
[42:37] Thou Art and what happened amen when
[42:41] they CED out the what the stocks and
[42:44] Vines broke by earthquake
[42:49] amen because they still had joy in
[42:55] Tribulation
[42:59] the
[43:01] issue is people get So
[43:04] Satisfied in that
[43:06] depleted condition where they've been
[43:08] robbed of the
[43:09] devil that they don't even say God
[43:11] restore it
[43:12] please God I believe you can restore it
[43:16] they don't even think of
[43:20] it so Satan is in the business of
[43:24] stealing everything you
[43:29] have
[43:31] Hallelujah but notice he didn't say none
[43:36] doeth
[43:37] restore once again we're right back to a
[43:39] Roman ceran just speak
[43:44] only where's a person saying I have lost
[43:49] something see what I'm
[43:51] saying especially as human beings we are

[44:53] are but he's got to get rid of the
[44:56] things that we've accepted in our own

[45:52] see the deeper alignment with it when
[45:55] Jesus Christ became the sacrifice at
[45:57] Calvary and resurrected what did he
[45:59] actually do he went up to the mercy seat
[46:01] that was already established in heaven

[49:45] today it was God and God Alone that
[49:50] brought your restoration

[49:59] said Jesus unto them again verily verily
[50:02] I say unto you I am the door of the
[50:03] sheep all that ever came before me are
[50:06] thieves and
[50:09] robbers but the Sheep did not hear
[50:11] them
[50:13] Hallelujah now watch he's talking about
[50:16] his day and what was before him if you
[50:19] actually establish it what made the
[50:20] Pharisees what made the
[50:22] Sadducees thieves and robbers right well
[50:26] how do you know because what those
[50:28] individuals produce such organization
[50:31] that what that the people come under
[50:32] that organizational mindset and when
[50:34] Christ the true word come they could not
[50:36] accept
[50:37] it that's what organizational Spirit
[50:40] does it makes you so you can't receive
[50:42] the what the perfect word Jesus
[50:47] Christ
[50:49] Hallelujah so what do you think we've
[50:51] had for 2,000 years thieves and robbers
[50:56] preaching a different
[50:58] message
[51:00] hallelujah what adding and taking away
[51:03] from the
[51:06] word but God gave us a seventh angel
[51:10] that we can see what the true word
[51:16] is
[51:18] hallelujah thieves and robbers but
[51:21] notice but the Sheep did not hear them
[51:24] I've watched old over and over and over
[51:26] again my life even how God brought me
[51:28] into this message but God he would use
[51:32] it just like he did in the
[51:34] Scripture it was like a wheat plant
[51:36] coming forth it started growing and then
[51:39] you have a
[51:41] stalk then what then you got a
[51:45] tassel then you got a
[51:47] Shook and out of the shook remember the
[51:50] Shu was so close it just fit it fit the
[51:53] seed but there came a time it looked
[51:55] exactly like the seed but there came a
[51:57] time where the seed had to come
[51:59] out that's
[52:02] right I'm excited I can't help it

[52:52] else they'll be on all right but but
[52:56] notice his sheep they wouldn't get
[52:58] caught by the thieves and the
[53:00] robbers Hallelujah they wouldn't get
[53:03] caught by all the false doctrines they
[53:05] wouldn't be caught by all the
[53:07] lies they would what they constantly set
[53:10] their faces towards the
[53:12] word remember this is Anointed ones at
[53:14] the end time I ain't got time to preach
[53:16] those messages it's going to be so close
[53:19] it would deceive the elected if possible
[53:20] it means it has to come right out of the
[53:22] message I'm not saying that if someone
[53:25] sitting in a specific church that they
[53:26] ain't going to make it because you don't
[53:28] know who's got the Holy Ghost and where
[53:29] they got the Holy
[53:30] Ghost I don't know what God did I know
[53:33] how God did with me I was sitting in an
[53:35] Assembly of God Church wan to be a

[53:49] swing
[53:51] Hallelujah that's God's
[53:54] grace

[54:02] legs but one day God opened my eyes up

[54:15] cometh not but for the steal and kill

[54:36] fullness of life if you have been caught
[54:40] under the what the stealing the killing
[54:43] and the destroying of Satan amen God can

[55:45] restoration he's the fullness of the
[55:47] restoration you get him you have
[55:50] restoration I want you to see it that's
[55:53] the evil of leoda because it wants you
[55:55] to hybrid something with the word it
[55:58] wants you to hybrid your thoughts your
[56:01] hobbies what you like it wants to hybrid
[56:03] everything with the word right brother
[56:06] it wants you it wants a message Pastor
[56:08] it wants it wants us to to look and say
[56:11] well we should do it because they're
[56:12] doing it message churches are getting
[56:14] big because that I ought to do it
[56:17] too that's not how this
[56:19] works there is a a specific will of God
[56:23] for his people
[56:25] and it comes only by the
[56:28] word I said something
[56:31] there I know you're Pastor He he'll help
[56:35] out in whatever way you can after I walk
[56:37] out these doors
[56:39] Amen brother Cam's a little bit
[56:41] fanatical you just leave me the way I am
[56:43] because I see something right now and I
[56:45] it's is not shaking on me
[56:49] Hallelujah don't think I ain't seen the
[56:51] Vindication of the spirit I'm rolling
[56:52] with this brother and sister I'm seeing
[56:53] it amen
[56:57] Hallelujah watch this so what is the
[57:00] true mind of God on
[57:02] restoration look at I got that
[57:05] more so if you had someone
[57:08] steal spiritually kill
[57:12] you destroy your
[57:15] life what could Christ
[57:18] do I want you to watch this this is very
[57:21] powerful Leviticus 6 it says and the
[57:23] Lord spake unto Moses is saying if a
[57:26] soul sin and commit a trespass against
[57:28] the Lord and lie unto his neighbor in
[57:31] that which was delivered him to keep or
[57:33] in fellowship or in a thing taken away
[57:36] by violence or hath deceived his
[57:38] neighbor or have found that which was
[57:41] lost and lith concerning it and sweareth
[57:44] falsely in any of these that a man doeth
[57:47] sinning
[57:48] therein Hallelujah so if anybody would
[57:52] do anything like that to somebody else
[57:57] they would take what they have they'd
[57:59] lie about
[58:02] it they would deceitfully take
[58:05] it watch this
[58:08] now then it shall
[58:11] be because he has sinned and is guilty
[58:14] that he
[58:15] [Music]
[58:17] shall
[58:20] restore that which he took violently
[58:23] away or the thing which he had
[58:26] deceitfully gotten or that which was
[58:28] delivered him to keep or the Lost thing
[58:31] which he
[58:33] found he has to restore
[58:37] it God made a
[58:39] law amongst the natural Church of
[58:44] Israel that if someone took something
[58:48] away they'd have to give it
[58:53] back
[58:55] [Applause]
[58:57] am
[58:59] Hallelujah now watch
[59:03] [Applause]
[59:05] this so he
[59:07] says where am I at right down
[59:11] here would I
[59:14] move the thing which he deceive God or
[59:16] that which was delivered to him the Lost
[59:17] thing which you found or all that was
[59:19] about which he sworn falsely he shall
[59:21] even restore it in the pron
[59:25] principle you know what that means that
[59:27] means if something was unrightfully
[59:30] taken from that individual he has to
[59:32] give them exactly what they took right
[59:35] back he has to restore it but watch this
[59:39] there's an icing on the
[59:41] cake all
[59:43] right and so wait a
[59:46] minute God in his law not only says he
[59:50] has to give back what he
[59:53] took and shall add the fifth part more
[1:00:00] thereto and give it unto him whom it
[1:00:03] appertaineth in the day of his trespass
[1:00:08] offering
[1:00:10] Hallelujah so if the devil took
[1:00:12] something away from you by the law of
[1:00:17] God he has to give it back
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:26] Hallelujah but watch this he don't only
[1:00:29] have to give it back he has to give you
[1:00:33] more than what he took
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:40] hallelujah
[1:00:42] amen this is the law of
[1:00:45] God not only do you get it
[1:00:49] back but you get
[1:00:53] bonus
[1:00:57] Hallelujah watch what he says in
[1:00:59] restoration of the Bride tree like if
[1:01:00] somebody stole some property and they're
[1:01:02] holding the property captive then you
[1:01:05] can take the
[1:01:08] law you see how how under privilege we
[1:01:10] lived how we live you have the right by
[1:01:14] the word of God you have the right by
[1:01:17] the word of God
[1:01:20] Amen
[1:01:23] hallu then you can take the law and go
[1:01:27] to this person and the law forces
[1:01:31] enforces this person to restore this
[1:01:34] property back to its natural owner and
[1:01:36] it's to the first estate enforcement oh
[1:01:40] what a text how I'd like to have two
[1:01:42] days on that in
[1:01:46] force now notice this you don't have the
[1:01:50] right as an
[1:01:53] individual with your own power your own
[1:01:57] will to get it
[1:02:01] back you have a
[1:02:03] law and an enforcer of that
[1:02:09] law remember we don't have the quote and
[1:02:12] PR down the road but it says what the
[1:02:14] Holy Ghost is that
[1:02:19] enforcer
[1:02:21] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will enforce
[1:02:24] the law of God that you get back what
[1:02:28] the devil took
[1:02:32] away Hallelujah therefore you have a
[1:02:35] right of restoration by the law of God
[1:02:39] to get everything that has ever been
[1:02:41] taken
[1:02:43] away and if you can see what that is you
[1:02:47] can say my nine spiritual gifts amen
[1:02:50] hallelujah the freedom of worship amen
[1:02:53] the ability to bring the Shina glory in
[1:02:55] this place hallelujah it's my right by
[1:02:59] the word of
[1:03:01] God it's my right to have a church in
[1:03:04] one Accord amen it's my right to what be
[1:03:07] free and happy to serve
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:12] Jesus it's the law of
[1:03:16] restoration
[1:03:19] watch Exodus
[1:03:22] 221 if a man steal an ax or a sheep and
[1:03:28] kill it or sell it watch this if you
[1:03:32] just steal one Ox if he kills it he
[1:03:35] shall restore five
[1:03:38] oxen the law of
[1:03:42] restoration why not just
[1:03:44] one I want you to see
[1:03:49] this God he wants to so spoil the
[1:03:55] enemy the transgressor of his
[1:03:58] law that he will force that transgressor
[1:04:02] to give you back more than what he
[1:04:06] took
[1:04:08] fivefold so if he takes one Ox he shall
[1:04:12] restore five oxen for an ox and four
[1:04:15] sheep for a
[1:04:21] sheepen
[1:04:22] Hallelujah if the the son be risen upon
[1:04:25] him there shall be blood shed for him
[1:04:28] for he should make full
[1:04:30] restitution if he have nothing then he
[1:04:33] shall be sold for his
[1:04:37] theft Hallelujah this also tells us how
[1:04:40] to treat one another doesn't it don't
[1:04:42] treat your brother wrong don't steal his
[1:04:44] Joy from
[1:04:45] him right that's why brother Bram said
[1:04:48] he said he said you talk nasty about
[1:04:49] your pastor he said you've already
[1:04:51] killed the
[1:04:52] man so who who's
[1:04:55] responsible you killed his
[1:04:59] reputation let alone what you might say

[1:05:07] called for
[1:05:09] this speak what speak only blessings

[1:05:45] back you don't know how far the
[1:05:48] blessings of restoration will go down
[1:05:50] the

[1:06:12] lie that all you get back is your
[1:06:17] health what's the word
[1:06:20] say he's going to give you that which he
[1:06:22] took and then
[1:06:25] he's going to take
[1:06:26] that which he took which was an ax and
[1:06:28] give you
[1:06:31] five

[1:06:59] something on him it's that easy yes

[1:07:07] of the
[1:07:08] law Hallelujah you've got to believe

[1:07:13] job
[1:07:16] amen if a man shall cause a field or
[1:07:18] Vineyard to be eaten and shall put his
[1:07:20] in his beast and shall feed another
[1:07:22] man's field look how simple this goes

[1:07:51] it look what Solomon says
[1:07:54] Proverbs
[1:07:55] 6:30 men do not despise a thief if he
[1:07:59] steal to satisfy his soul when he's
[1:08:02] hungry but if he be found he shall
[1:08:07] restore
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:12] Sevenfold he shall give all the
[1:08:15] substance of his
[1:08:18] house sounds like something Jesus said
[1:08:22] he said when a when a strong man's got
[1:08:24] his house he thinks he's got his Goods
[1:08:26] he said when one
[1:08:27] stronger comes he taketh away all that
[1:08:30] he has and spoil his own
[1:08:33] Goods you don't think Satan took away or
[1:08:36] uh or what Satan took away Jesus will
[1:08:38] not take
[1:08:40] back that's his purpose the Bible says
[1:08:44] he he destroyed the works of the
[1:08:48] devil and
[1:08:50] what the Bible says you can redeem
[1:08:53] redeem the
[1:08:56] time I need a restoration of the time

[1:19:18] Devils by the spirit of God then the
[1:19:20] kingdom of God Has Come unto you or else
[1:19:23] how can one enter into a strong man's
[1:19:24] house and spoils good except that he
[1:19:26] first bind the strong man that's what
[1:19:28] Calvary did when he shed that blood he
[1:19:31] bound the
[1:19:32] devil he bound
[1:19:35] him we only give it to the devil that's
[1:19:38] all we're doing we're just give stuff to
[1:19:39] him you don't have to give him
[1:19:41] nothing you don't have to you have a
[1:19:44] right by the word of God yes to speak
[1:19:47] the word at
[1:19:49] him you resist that Devil by the word he
[1:19:53] shall
[1:19:55] flee he that is not with me is against
[1:19:58] me and he that gathereth not with me
[1:20:00] scattereth abroad right Jesus did that
[1:20:03] for you now watch I'm going to go just a
[1:20:05] little bit farther I see the time and I
[1:20:08] I got to close once again but Job 1 16
[1:20:11] now watch this now there was a day when
[1:20:14] the sons of God came to present
[1:20:15] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[1:20:17] come also among them and the Lord said
[1:20:19] unto Satan whence comest thou uh then
[1:20:22] Satan answered the Lord and said from
[1:20:24] going to and fromo in the Earth from
[1:20:25] walking up and down it and the Lord said
[1:20:27] unto Satan hast thou considered my
[1:20:29] servant jel that there's none like him
[1:20:31] in the earth a perfect and upright right
[1:20:34] man one that fearth God and esth
[1:20:38] Evil then Satan answered the Lord and
[1:20:40] said doth job fear God for
[1:20:44] not hast thou not made a hedge about him
[1:20:47] and about his house and about all that
[1:20:49] he hath on every side thou has blessed
[1:20:52] the work of his hands and his substance
[1:20:54] is increased in the
[1:20:56] land god protected that
[1:21:00] man because he was God's
[1:21:05] child now we know what
[1:21:10] happens so what happened God allowed
[1:21:13] Satan to take his children turned his
[1:21:16] wife against
[1:21:17] them took all that he
[1:21:20] had now for time sakes
[1:21:23] but what did job
[1:21:24] do job stayed right
[1:21:28] there believing God not understanding
[1:21:33] but
[1:21:35] believing amen now remember part of the
[1:21:38] moral the story brother Bram said he
[1:21:40] said the thing that he feared most came
[1:21:42] that's right yes he feared
[1:21:44] that remember he preached uh when he
[1:21:48] preached uh uh perfect faith in ' 63 he
[1:21:50] said that he said he said the thing that
[1:21:52] that he feared came to him if he
[1:21:54] wouldn't have feared it it wouldn't have
[1:21:56] come now God placed those things there
[1:21:59] so it doesn't matter what has offended
[1:22:02] you as far as what fear you might
[1:22:04] had but I'll tell you what get out of it
[1:22:08] don't hold on it you don't get rid of it
[1:22:11] it's going to
[1:22:12] come trust in the Lord your God for he
[1:22:17] is your
[1:22:21] confidence he is going to keep
[1:22:24] you you think the government's going to
[1:22:27] get you or you think this guy's going to
[1:22:28] get you the guy hiding in the bushes
[1:22:30] they're going to get you but if you
[1:22:32] trust that God is going to keep
[1:22:35] you amen he is going to do more than
[1:22:40] just that amen he is going to raise you
[1:22:43] up in the power of God and his
[1:22:45] righteousness
[1:22:48] amen so watch job lost everything
[1:22:53] and even his body was was swn with
[1:22:56] disease now watch of course we realize
[1:22:59] the end I'm showing you the law of
[1:23:01] restoration brother
[1:23:02] sister and the Lord turned the Captivity
[1:23:05] of job when he prayed for his friends he
[1:23:08] first he had to pray for his his
[1:23:10] miserable
[1:23:12] comforters he had to pray first and
[1:23:14] losing everything he had to pray for the
[1:23:15] people that were trying to really break
[1:23:16] him and make him want to
[1:23:20] die Hallelujah good
[1:23:23] says when he prayed for his friends also
[1:23:25] the lord gave job twice as much as he
[1:23:29] had before you see the law of
[1:23:32] restoration he doesn't just want to give
[1:23:35] you back what you've lost he wants to
[1:23:37] give you back a lot
[1:23:44] more I ain't talking about Mercedes
[1:23:47] benzes and
[1:23:51] Lamborghinis he's going to give you the
[1:23:53] things that are Eternal
[1:23:55] am I'm not saying he won't physically
[1:23:57] bless you cuz he has Hallelujah but what
[1:24:01] I am saying is he wants to bring forth
[1:24:04] an eternal treasure to you amen I don't
[1:24:07] know about you give me my family Lord
[1:24:10] every single one of them give me my
[1:24:12] cousins Lord let there be a Revival
[1:24:15] strike the people amen that watch that
[1:24:18] hope has went forth from My Life by
[1:24:21] faith to say they're mine
[1:24:26] amen the lord gave job twice as much as
[1:24:28] he had before then came there unto him
[1:24:30] all his Brethren and all sisters and all
[1:24:33] they that had been of his acquaintance
[1:24:34] before did eat bread with him in his
[1:24:36] house and they bemoaned him and
[1:24:38] comforted him and all the evil the Lord
[1:24:39] had brought upon him every man also gave
[1:24:41] him a piece of money and everyone an
[1:24:43] earring of gold so he still has more
[1:24:45] people what giving him
[1:24:50] more so the Lord blessed the latter end
[1:24:53] of job more than his beginning for he
[1:24:55] had 14,000 sheep that's twice as many
[1:24:58] 6,000 camels and a th000 of Yol of oxen
[1:25:01] and a thousand she asses he all had also
[1:25:05] seven sons and three
[1:25:08] daughters which is
[1:25:10] what that's what he didn't get a double
[1:25:12] portion
[1:25:14] of because he had seven before
[1:25:18] right
[1:25:19] Hallelujah and aren't you glad for a
[1:25:21] revelation that come through this

[1:26:02] restoration Hallelujah let me see I'm I
[1:26:06] got to close he said we're closing in
[1:26:07] this quote so I got to
[1:26:11] close yes this is beautiful I want you
[1:26:14] to see this unfailing realities of God
[1:26:15] in 60 said I've often thought this we're
[1:26:17] closing Church listen to these remarks
[1:26:19] I've often thought what what why how
[1:26:22] we've deprived oursel and how we've
[1:26:25] robbed God of his
[1:26:28] plan by not surrendering Our Lives
[1:26:31] completely to
[1:26:33] him everything that we have to him how
[1:26:36] that we've have disallowed his
[1:26:40] program oh Lord Jesus does God deserve
[1:26:44] anything less than the representation of
[1:26:47] what this
[1:26:48] says he doesn't who did he call to do it
[1:26:52] you you and
[1:26:54] I look at how brother brings us we've
[1:26:56] disallowed this program why because of
[1:26:58] our selfish
[1:27:01] ways we're not surrendering to God like
[1:27:03] we ought
[1:27:04] to well this is how we do it no this is
[1:27:07] how we do
[1:27:09] it get
[1:27:12] quiet how do we know what God's will is
[1:27:14] for us we've got to go to him don't you
[1:27:18] see that's that's the very tenant of
[1:27:19] nickan
[1:27:21] ism
[1:27:22] is when we begin to put our own human
[1:27:25] ideas and we don't let the word of God
[1:27:27] lead us you know probably the greatest
[1:27:30] Miracle of the book of Acts is how
[1:27:32] perfectly God was able to lead those
[1:27:35] people it isn't the supernatural
[1:27:37] Miracles those are all great hallelujah
[1:27:39] thank God for them but to me it was the
[1:27:41] communion with God and the ability for
[1:27:44] God to lead them in such a perfect
[1:27:49] way
[1:27:51] Hallelujah
[1:27:54] am amen he said he's trying to find how
[1:27:59] we've lingered and made him to wait and
[1:28:01] wait and wait trying to find somebody he
[1:28:02] could work through trying to find a man
[1:28:04] somewhere that he could put confidence
[1:28:05] in some man that would surrender
[1:28:07] everything come inan sensible way to God
[1:28:09] and say Father Here I Am I don't care
[1:28:12] I'm I'm going to follow the scripture
[1:28:15] the blueprint I don't care what anybody
[1:28:17] else says I'll stay with it and really
[1:28:19] mean it I don't care what it cost me
[1:28:21] Lord I'm nothing to begin with but I
[1:28:23] want you to lead me and let the holy
[1:28:25] spirit that wrote this Bible and made
[1:28:28] these promises confirm it back through
[1:28:29] my life I feel that you're leading me
[1:28:32] that way
[1:28:34] amen see it's Allowing God to have the
[1:28:38] full influence on your decisions your
[1:28:44] choices
[1:28:46] Hallelujah you know how it is if we get
[1:28:49] in the way how much trouble it causes
[1:28:54] thank God for that because remember
[1:28:57] there's a people that are blessed and
[1:28:59] they think blessing is a reality of the
[1:29:05] right they get bigger bigger more money
[1:29:07] more everything oh look at us the r
[1:29:09] talked about so many times but what it's
[1:29:12] a
[1:29:15] lie Hallelujah that means I've been long
[1:29:18] I know as we close so what came down
[1:29:22] zigg lak I'll just go through it just
[1:29:23] real
[1:29:25] quickly when David's men came to Zig
[1:29:28] everything that they had the their their
[1:29:30] little tent city was burnt down their
[1:29:32] wives and their children everything they
[1:29:34] had was
[1:29:36] taken very familiar with the
[1:29:38] story
[1:29:43] right they even wanted to Stone David
[1:29:45] his soldiers
[1:29:48] did but David had one thing that he did
[1:29:53] is he actually
[1:29:55] consulted the
[1:29:58] epid he said shall I pursue
[1:30:04] them when it looked bad he said shall I
[1:30:08] pursue
[1:30:10] them and the the spirit of the Lord came
[1:30:14] back with a message he said pursue for
[1:30:18] Thou shalt surely recover all
[1:30:24] [Laughter]
[1:30:27] you see how Bible this
[1:30:30] is think about that an army burns your
[1:30:33] house down they take your
[1:30:36] family first thing you think is what my
[1:30:38] family's
[1:30:40] dead they've been harmed in in in
[1:30:42] inconceivable ways look at what you're
[1:30:44] seeing on the
[1:30:46] news the atrocities we're watching right
[1:30:48] now thank God that the Bible tells tells
[1:30:51] us in Proverbs 3 that said Don't Fear
[1:30:54] what comes to the sons of men don't fear
[1:30:56] what happens to
[1:30:58] them why do you say don't fear it
[1:31:01] because he's going to keep you above it
[1:31:03] but sister we're bringing the revelation
[1:31:04] of invincibility in this hour that's
[1:31:06] what we're doing you've got to believe
[1:31:08] who you are you've got to believe what
[1:31:11] the power you have
[1:31:14] is David was so anointed of God that
[1:31:18] even his enemies in burning his things
[1:31:20] and taking his family their animals
[1:31:24] away they could only take them away they
[1:31:28] couldn't tame it in any
[1:31:36] way well I only want half my healing
[1:31:39] back I only want uhuh I Want It
[1:31:44] All Hallelujah there's a law of
[1:31:48] restoration here amen I don't just get
[1:31:52] it back I get back more
[1:31:55] [Laughter]
[1:31:57] amen so they pursued them and remember I
[1:32:01] believe it was the brook of Bo bazor
[1:32:03] that what men were fainting they
[1:32:04] couldn't even go on but and what David
[1:32:06] said leave them here let's go get it
[1:32:08] back
[1:32:11] amen
[1:32:13] hallelujah almost done he said and force
[1:32:16] he said have the privilege to enforce
[1:32:18] upon Satan the claims that God give us
[1:32:21] for God has a law and his word is a law
[1:32:23] and God came in this word made certain
[1:32:26] claims to the church he gave you the
[1:32:29] word as your
[1:32:32] claim don't throw away the Old
[1:32:35] Testament don't throw away it it's just
[1:32:38] as applicable as the New Testament with
[1:32:41] the right
[1:32:44] Revelation therefore we have a right to
[1:32:47] force these claims upon Satan say give
[1:32:50] it back and has to do it because we can
[1:32:53] take God's agent the Holy Spirit go
[1:32:57] right down on our
[1:33:00] knees and say it's thus saith the Lord
[1:33:05] amen he has got to give it up that's all
[1:33:09] cuz the holy spirit is there to make him
[1:33:11] do it the law of the land is to enforce
[1:33:14] it's by the land for the
[1:33:18] land every right and promise this Bible
[1:33:22] gave you is
[1:33:26] yours praise the Living
[1:33:30] God it just keeps on going I thought I
[1:33:32] was done he said what is it en forcing
[1:33:34] giving it back that's right that's what
[1:33:36] I'm talking about restore bring it back
[1:33:37] to the right over if Satan has robbed
[1:33:39] you of a privilege of being a son or
[1:33:40] daughter of God you don't feel like
[1:33:42] you're a son or daughter of God what do
[1:33:43] you do notice you don't feel it I don't
[1:33:46] feel like much of a Christian I don't
[1:33:48] feel like I'm a child of God I feel like
[1:33:51] I I feel like my flesh and you know I'm
[1:33:52] just I'm just a serpent just sitting in
[1:33:54] a Son of God Church no you
[1:33:56] aren't what it is he's brought thoughts
[1:33:59] your way and what cause you to think his
[1:34:07] lie he said the privilege of being a son
[1:34:10] or daughter of God we have a right this
[1:34:12] morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce
[1:34:14] the claim of God bring them back if he's
[1:34:18] Afflicted you made you sick we have a
[1:34:20] right before God to enforce the laws of
[1:34:23] God by his stripes we're healed amen
[1:34:26] bring him back turn him loose you're
[1:34:29] taking him out here under death and we
[1:34:32] claim him back bring him back
[1:34:36] now that's the
[1:34:39] enforcement restore it back to its
[1:34:41] natural condition again a man is sick
[1:34:43] baby is sick woman is sick they're out
[1:34:45] of their natural condition then we have
[1:34:46] a right to enforce our claim not our
[1:34:48] claim it's our claim because God gave it
[1:34:50] to us God give it to us by his stripes
[1:34:52] we're healed he was wounded for
[1:34:53] transgression by his stripes we're
[1:34:54] healed he said we have a right to
[1:34:56] enforce a law and the lawgiver Holy
[1:34:58] Spirit himself is here the agent of God
[1:35:00] to see that it's done that way he said
[1:35:03] now the only way he can work is when you
[1:35:05] let him
[1:35:06] work there it is oh Fighters you've got
[1:35:10] to believe it there's a law oh if I ever
[1:35:12] get to my text there's a law there's a
[1:35:14] law given amongst everything you've got
[1:35:15] to
[1:35:16] believe Hallelujah you see you see how
[1:35:19] how we're taking it even farther with
[1:35:20] the rest of this world word that says he
[1:35:21] doesn't give you just back what's yours
[1:35:23] he gives you back more
[1:35:25] yes so what happens
[1:35:28] here there it is he says David inquired
[1:35:31] of the Lord saying shall I pursue after
[1:35:32] the troop and shall I overtake and he
[1:35:34] answered him pursue for Thou shalt
[1:35:35] surely overtake them without fail
[1:35:36] recover all moving all the way down
[1:35:39] David recovered all that the amalekites
[1:35:42] had carried away and David rescued his
[1:35:45] two wives and there was nothing lacking
[1:35:47] to them neither small nor great neither
[1:35:50] Sons nor daughters neither spoil nor
[1:35:52] anything that they had taken to them
[1:35:54] David recovered all and David took all
[1:35:57] the flocks and the herds which they Dr
[1:35:58] before the cattle and said this is
[1:36:00] David's spoil but if you read continue
[1:36:02] reading he not only had that he took
[1:36:05] everything they
[1:36:08] had he had so
[1:36:10] much that he was able to send it to the
[1:36:14] tribes of Israel and they made him
[1:36:20] King h Hallelujah now think about it
[1:36:23] these are the ones that had rejected him
[1:36:24] as king and he sent them gifts of the
[1:36:27] spoil God gave him see so the extra
[1:36:29] blessings that God gave him he didn't
[1:36:32] keep them for himself to make him more
[1:36:33] rich and better he sent it out to what
[1:36:37] to bring everyone into a spot that they
[1:36:40] could be in the right position for the
[1:36:42] message of their
[1:36:45] age Hallelujah and that was David is the
[1:36:50] king Christ is the king
[1:36:54] amen let's stand I'm
[1:36:57] done hallelujah am what's your
[1:37:04] expectation now I don't want to confuse
[1:37:06] this idea because you know exactly just
[1:37:09] like we said last night this right here
[1:37:12] it's like oh God where's this at H H how
[1:37:16] can I do I mean how could I possibly and
[1:37:18] you see we've come under such
[1:37:21] such a condition because we're not right
[1:37:24] with our
[1:37:25] savior according to his
[1:37:29] word but this is what God is going to
[1:37:33] produce this is what God wants to do he
[1:37:36] wants to get you into such a spot you're
[1:37:39] enforcing all of the word all of the
[1:37:43] time
[1:37:45] amen I know I kept an hour and a half
[1:37:47] probably a little bit over I can't even
[1:37:49] read the time back I didn't look at it
[1:37:50] God help me man you put all that work in
[1:37:53] to set that bad that nice thing back
[1:37:55] there and I didn't even follow it
[1:37:57] Hallelujah but I'll tell you what if you
[1:37:59] can catch who you are in the
[1:38:03] world it changes everything it's like as
[1:38:07] I'm looking at little she ain't little
[1:38:10] but growing growing Caris
[1:38:12] there within her is all the power to
[1:38:16] enforce the claim of this
[1:38:18] word you've got to believe that God made
[1:38:21] you that way well I'm just a I'm just a
[1:38:23] little girl I'm just no you are a child
[1:38:26] of God with all the rights of redemption
[1:38:29] in your hand therefore you love the Lord
[1:38:32] your
[1:38:33] God and say God give me your mind fill
[1:38:37] me with your Holy Ghost amen so Lord
[1:38:41] that as I'm coming to you in the life
[1:38:44] you gave me I'm able to follow the path
[1:38:47] that you called for me and to do what
[1:38:50] you called me to do in this hour to
[1:38:52] overcome the devil in all his tricks all
[1:38:56] his lies and to get back everything that
[1:38:59] the devil has taken from the
[1:39:01] bride amen
[1:39:04] hallelujah you're called for it how many
[1:39:08] say that's what I
[1:39:09] am praise be to God real simple message
[1:39:12] today was a little long but that's what
[1:39:16] that's what I
[1:39:17] do Che want itj you want it
[1:39:21] glory and get yourself in the condition
[1:39:24] don't go back out and and and be
[1:39:26] defeated don't back out don't go back
[1:39:29] out and do that just like last night if
[1:39:31] you already feel like I went right back
[1:39:32] to what I am well my kids made me do
[1:39:35] that or or or or SE and so they didn't
[1:39:37] treat me right it happened right after
[1:39:39] church don't worry about any of
[1:39:41] that that's what the devil is trying to
[1:39:44] do to destroy you from
[1:39:47] being a great enemy and adversary to him
[1:39:52] if he can just get you back in a
[1:39:54] rut to not see the rights and privileges
[1:39:57] that Jesus Christ died for you to give
[1:40:01] you hallelujah how many say I left that
[1:40:05] behind Hallelujah all those things are
[1:40:07] covered by the blood but yet here we are
[1:40:09] at the end of the service what will you
[1:40:11] do let's do the only thing that
[1:40:14] rightfully
[1:40:16] comes has the devil taken anything from
[1:40:19] you
[1:40:21] well first we got to be like zakus have
[1:40:23] I taken anything from somebody I got to
[1:40:26] get right if you're all right there
[1:40:28] praise the Lord you can move step
[1:40:31] twoo I see I see eyes going like this
[1:40:33] thinking that's good that's
[1:40:36] good Hallelujah because you might have
[1:40:39] some restoration to do
[1:40:41] yourself Hallelujah but now what would
[1:40:44] you do if you're free from
[1:40:47] that just as soon as you make the even
[1:40:49] if there's something there you say God
[1:40:50] I'm make that right you're already ready
[1:40:52] for step
[1:40:53] two CU When you have made by Revelation
[1:40:56] the statement I'm going to make it
[1:40:58] right you'll go do it don't leave the
[1:41:01] moment of the word because if he's taken
[1:41:04] anything back he's taken anything away
[1:41:06] from you you have right now by the by
[1:41:08] the power of the Holy Ghost the ability
[1:41:10] to bring it
[1:41:14] back that's power
[1:41:18] heads it's been probably been for
[1:41:22] services much energy has been spent but
[1:41:25] now as we're kind of bringing it back
[1:41:27] down to living in the in the true
[1:41:31] Prosperity that the Holy Ghost has
[1:41:33] called for us brother brandom he made he
[1:41:37] made this known from his own life how
[1:41:40] this would work not just for him but for
[1:41:42] others which is what it's not just bring
[1:41:44] the blessing to him in restoration but
[1:41:47] what it's doing a work for
[1:41:49] others how would say with their hearts
[1:41:52] today oh God Satan's taken some things
[1:41:56] from
[1:41:56] me maybe say he took that
[1:42:00] specifically I know he took it away and
[1:42:04] I'm here to get right with my savior
[1:42:06] right
[1:42:06] now and being right with my savior I can
[1:42:10] take the
[1:42:11] enforcer and enforce a claim on Satan
[1:42:14] right now by the name of Jesus
[1:42:17] Christ if there's something on your
[1:42:19] heart right now
[1:42:21] we're going to pray into him right now
[1:42:23] yes Lord you are in just as much
[1:42:27] Authority as I
[1:42:30] am so if you have that enforcer because
[1:42:36] he is in
[1:42:37] you you have the right of Revelation
[1:42:41] from him in you and through you to bring
[1:42:46] back that which was taken
[1:42:49] away
[1:42:51] so as I pray you can pray as well and
[1:42:55] let's just reach out we're living in a
[1:42:58] day where God wants to do great
[1:43:00] things do we have the spiritual courage
[1:43:05] enough to put the
[1:43:07] battle in Array let's pray Lord
[1:43:13] Jesus thou knowest oh God as we look
[1:43:17] back at our lives we see imperfection
[1:43:21] we see oh God
[1:43:24] failures and Lord perhaps this being
[1:43:27] taken that being
[1:43:30] taken but yet Lord you gave us a
[1:43:35] word that
[1:43:37] lord it's our rights by the Holy Spirit
[1:43:42] to get back what has been taken away it
[1:43:46] takes Faith oh God in your power it
[1:43:50] takes faith in your love that you have
[1:43:54] for us to know you love us and to know
[1:43:58] that you want to work for us and that we
[1:44:01] are the called and elected of God that
[1:44:04] you want to bring this word forth
[1:44:07] today Lord as we reach to you now Lord
[1:44:11] thou knowest oh God our condition if the
[1:44:14] devil's stolen
[1:44:16] joy we enforce the claim of the Holy
[1:44:19] Ghost against them now
[1:44:21] Sor eliar we take our joy back right now
[1:44:25] by the Holy
[1:44:27] Spirit whatever it is to each individual
[1:44:32] we pray oh God move them by your Holy
[1:44:35] Ghost oh God oh God put that desire
[1:44:38] allow it to build Faith there Lord and
[1:44:41] take that back what the enemy yes has
[1:44:45] taken from them in restoration we're
[1:44:48] believing oh God how great this is you
[1:44:51] don't just give it back but you br give
[1:44:53] back more Lord so with all of our heart
[1:44:57] we see that word we see it's possible
[1:45:00] Lord and we're asking oh God that we
[1:45:03] would live in the Bountiful Abundant
[1:45:07] Life that you've called us to in this
[1:45:11] hour if there's one thing we could
[1:45:13] repent of
[1:45:14] God is that we've robbed
[1:45:17] You by not living your program out by
[1:45:21] not allowing your Holy Ghost to find a
[1:45:24] surrendered vessel in us and we lay that
[1:45:26] down oh God and may you be able oh God
[1:45:31] to restore your church back to what she
[1:45:34] should be oh God take every ounce of
[1:45:37] humanism take every ounce of
[1:45:39] organization take every ounce of
[1:45:42] everything and let it be nothing but the
[1:45:44] pure word in our
[1:45:46] lives we believe you'll do it now Lord
[1:45:48] for thy glory and Lord as all this word
[1:45:51] has been sown over the last four days we
[1:45:53] pray oh God that it would anchor so deep
[1:45:56] in the hearts oh God that they would
[1:45:58] move just like that quote said in a
[1:46:00] greater power all the time as it becomes
[1:46:04] more in the minority we're believing
[1:46:06] you'll do it now we speak the blessing
[1:46:08] of the name of Jesus Christ over these
[1:46:10] people and we bless your wonderful name
[1:46:12] for how great you are in your
[1:46:14] word we love it it's the very food to
