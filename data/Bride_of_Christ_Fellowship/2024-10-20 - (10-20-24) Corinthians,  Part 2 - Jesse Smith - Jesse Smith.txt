blessing to have that communion Hallelujah 1 Corinthians chapter 1 I think by God's grace why don't we just read uh I'll read verses one and two and then we can all read three together it's a little little little reading there by God's grace I'll read one too thank you buddy appreciate that thank you sir yeah I'll read one and two and then why don't we we'll read three and four because three and

3 Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ amen may God add his Blessing to reading of his word you can be seated Hallelujah so we're thankful again to be in the house of the Lord today hallelujah look forward to Lena's testimony that' be a great blessing there by the grace of God so I have a few uh slides here Casa by God's grace you can switch over when you're ready look at part two here I've been um enjoying this little study here I've read through the entire book of First Corinthians and I'm almost through 2 Corinthians it's been a great review and of course listening to God's Prophet preach about uh Corinthians book of Correction uh from 1957 a wonderful message there by the grace of God hallelujah if you weren't here Wednesday you know we end the sermon with showing how um brother brandham said the whole idea around the Corinthian Church he said they were always looking for a sensation always looking for a dream or a prophecy or a tongue and he said they they they went too far on the sensations and he said they were missing the anchor of Love Hallelujah brother Ram said it six times he said our anchor is the love of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so uh we got a get a great lesson here there's lots of different kinds of churches you know we went through uh Wednesday night how uh leevan impacts every church but every Church Must Purge it out praise God and uh the the thing that will do that is love love purges out a church Hallelujah the love of God the love of God keeps the church clean Hallelujah so uh we kind of want to build off of that by God's grace and start reading into chapter one uh you'll see why I kind of go a certain direction here in a little bit uh by the grace of God let me start my timer here it's been a while since I remembered to set my timer just been preaching long and hard here praise God so so I want to look at again uh Scofield's outline of the epistle uh today we're going to get into Parts one and two Lord willing here uh by the grace of God uh the believer standing in Grace is the first nine verses and then uh he begins the first kind of uh rebuke or the first problem in the church the carnal state of the Corinthians here he begins it in verse 10 we're going to look at that here briefly and then he has to deal with sexual immorality and how to handle one's body the sanctity of the human body and of course marriage and then he looks at Christian Liberty for three chapters there 8 n and 10 and then headship uh with uh Christ you know under the headship of the father and woman under man and the Lord's Supper of course we call that hair hair chapter there hair is the outward sign of the ex of the expression of uh headship in the lives of Christians always has been Hallelujah and then the Lord's Supper which we took last week Hallelujah and then spiritual gifts in charity that's kind of the the point brother Brandon made when he preached on this the anchor is God 's love Hallelujah and then he looks at resurrections there was questions about resurrections in the Corinthian Church and then he gives closing instructions and greetings but I'd like to begin with the origin of the church so if you have your Bible go to Acts chapter 18 verse1 we're going to uh start there and just look at the origin of the church in Corinth Hallelujah so Acts chapter 18 verse one now these things are to encourage us you know uh you know you come to church to have God minister to your needs right we come here to worship God to give him glory Hallelujah and so uh you know we the best thing we can do is try to apply these scriptures to our lives how does this apply to us well in this case we can see how God started the Corinthian Church and then we can see how God started the akan church praise God or whatever Church you first came in the message uh how did God start the Ghan Church you know you can you can look at that and you see the same God doing the same things Hallelujah and so we want to look at that and just appreciate that today uh we get a good understanding of uh the church and what they struggled through uh and how God strengthened them and how God helped them Hallelujah so Acts chapter 18 verse1 this is called Paul at Corinth according to scoffield after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth and found a certain Jew named Aquilla born in pontis lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome so look at the political pressure they lived under they were were kicked out of their land right by the leading politician of their day but see God was behind that you know we might feel sorry for ourselves why do I have to move or why do I have to have this moving cost or why does this have to happen to me but God was doing something if it didn't happen they never would have met the prophet of God hallelujah if 911 never happened Simon would not have went to that Bible study for the message The Message Bible study that's what drove Simon to go to The Message Bible study was 911 he thought the end of the world was here wow right but we know we're in the last age Hallelujah no man knows the day or the hour so see all these things political all you know no matter what Satan tries to design God is in control God makes all things work to His Glory Hallelujah so you can be kicked out of a city because you're a chrisan you could be kicked out of anywhere but God is with you and God will use it to bring you to the truth if you desire the truth hallelujah and no doubt uh Aquilla and Priscilla desire the truth they've been kicked out of Rome Just because their Rel religious beliefs now Church there may come a time you've heard uh whispers about Civil War in America there may come a time we might have to flee Ohio I'm just saying and you never know right you never know think of the saints that lived through the Civil War back in the 1800s who would have thought they would ever have to suffer through through these things we don't know what's coming we don't know what tomorrow holds but what do we know God Holds Tomorrow hallelujah amen just remember these Bible days repeat brother R tells us that the Bible tells us that compound prophecies right scripture repeats itself Hallelujah so we just got to be ready for anything and know that whatever God allows God is right by our side he's the God who sees Hallelujah anybody still remember El Rio by God's grace Hallelujah the God who sees you Hallelujah he knows the hairs on your head Hallelujah he sees your uh your down uh sitting and your Uprising Hallelujah he does not Slumber or sleep Hallelujah God doesn't take a break on your life God loves you Hallelujah he's watching over you Hallelujah but he's got to mold our character at the same time and he says the best way to get character is through suffering hallelujah amen it's not through uh all the blessings Hallelujah through suffering uh Jesus learned obedience verse three and because he was of the same craft he Abode with them and wrought and worked for by their occupation they were tent makers so again through his personal job he met another believer how many Christians have a been able to witness to by God's grace you know you just get to witness of them because you're job leads you to them right I've had three or four friends come to our church just because uh we met them in cople you know so God uses your occupation he uses the political climate of the day he uses all these things to forward his message amen thank God the message came to us hallelujah that's what I can say today Hallelujah verse four now here we get to the founding of the church and he reasoned their synagogue every Sabbath that would be pretty wonderful Church setting wouldn't it like in in other words the Jewish synagogue they encouraged to debate every Saturday that would be like at our church if in the second service I said okay it's time for a bait I'll stand here who wants to debate me and heathens would walk in Muslims would walk in you know isn't that something the Jews were open to that he debated every synagogue Hallelujah now we tried a couple years ago didn't we brother William we tried to go and just try to be a light and every time I leave an envelope with this is for the pastor with my contact information I got to give out a few books there by God's grace so I just I I want to reach out to them when I can by God's grace Hallelujah but he would reason every Sabbath so every Saturday was debate day for Paul that's why we talk about those Street Preachers that's why we admire their courage don't we to get out there in front of the whole world and persuaded the Jews and Greeks and when Silas and timotheus had were come from Macedonia Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ have you ever had that God presses something on you where you just can't get away from it God is pressing this on you that's what I normally see with my sermons you know God will press that thought of the God who sees or he'll press a certain thought on about partial fear of the Lord or whatever it is the fear of the Lord God and I feel like it's oppressed right on my soul hallelujah or God might lead you to do something that's maybe outside the ordinary it's God moving each individual as they feel led right right each man brother man said has each man and woman has to find the mystery of God for their life the mystery of his will Hallelujah and so that's how God worked with Paul God pressed things on his spirit so this these things would be on his mind right sister Anna you know these these dreams would be on his mind and all these situations would be on his mind and then God would open something up you know I was just thinking about that and then this happened right God gives you two or three Witnesses right but God didn't stop there as we'll see later God gives him Visions God gives him dreams Hallelujah see church we have to recognize that sometimes God is going to press something on our spirit we just have to check it with the word make sure it's the word hallelujah make sure it's not a lying Spirit or something like that right or a lustful Spirit or a prideful arrogant Spirit or something like that by God's grace Hallelujah now he says verse six and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his reignment and said to them your blood be upon your own heads I am clean from henceforth I will go into the Gentiles so Paul had enough it was pressed on him to minister to the Jews and after they started blaspheming he said that's enough I'm done with the Jews see God will give you a witness when it's time to be done with something right God gave him a witness he tried it was pressed on the spirit he preached there every Saturday he would debate every Saturday but then God helped him realize okay this is time to be done with this we're moving on to something else Hallelujah remember he'd also had this calling from God he was a teacher of the Gentiles the Bible says Jesus said I'm going to send you to those who are in darkness that God might give you a great light hallelujah amen what a light the gospel is amen the light of Jesus Christ what a light Hallelujah verse seven and he departed then and entered into a certain man's house named justice and we met a Justice at taekwondo didn't we so I was I was saying Lord give me another witness if this is something I'm supposed to do here I was think about that this morning one that worshiped God whose house joined hard to the synagogue so I like that even though he was rejected there was some somebody right next door somebody was getting convinced while the majority rejected him God had a little group there hallelujah hallelujah verse eight and Christmas the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all of his house so while most Jews blashe what Paul said he got a very prominent person to join the message Hallelujah glory to God so this would cause a great stir right a major leader in the Jewish Church came out of the Jewish church and joined the Christian church and it caused a stir Hallelujah now I did just a bit of studying on this on the history um the Roman Emperor rebuilt Corinth it was destroyed in BC time uh the Roman Emperor rebuilt it and it became so great with trade uh and commerce as we said on Wednesday that uh there it's estimated they had over 800,000 people in this city this is a pretty massive City and remember remember uh it said that when anybody would talk about the Corinthians uh they would use the name Corinthian like a slander like hippie or Heathen or something like that right or a woke person so and uh I heard another preacher say even in all the plays and you know because Greeks had amphitheaters and plays in all the plays whenever they had a Corinthian character he was a drunk or she was a drunk because it was a city of debauchery right that's why Paul had to say adulterers fornicators drunkards uh homos uals will not inherit the kingdom of God that's why I to say that because the city's surrounded by it oh but in the midst of the darkness God brought forth a great light Hallelujah and he said such were some of you but ye are washed Hallelujah you're Justified you're Sanctified by the spirit of our God Hallelujah by the Holy Ghost amen so God loves to go into darkness and Shine the great light of the Gospel thank God Amen Hallelujah but see he saves these prominent ones uh by God's grace Christus was the chief chief ruler finishing verse eight so 8 B and many of the Corinthians hearing him believed and were baptized so all the Jews reject him but when this one Jew who's a very prominent Jew gets saved it moves other Gentiles to receive him to receive Christ and they got baptized right there in the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah then spake the Lord to Paul in the Night by Vision what are his first three words Be not Afraid can I say it to you be Not Afraid Hallelujah if God's called you to akan if God's called you to do your ministry God will back you up hallelujah or he'll give you some type of warning that it's time to suffer it's time to be persecuted but he tells Paul don't worry about your physical state don't worry about the persecution don't you oh how loving is Jesus hallelujah how kind is Jesus even God sent Moses and Elijah to talk to Jesus before his cruci fiction Hallelujah so before persecution would set in oh and how many times did Paul get warned he got warned by agabus and all these different prophets you're going to Rome to give your life but Paul said it doesn't move me anymore I'm willing to my the time of my departure is at hand I'm willing to be a sacrifice an offering for Jesus hallelujah what encouragement to us Church be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace remember he'd already uh been rejected by the Jews they blasphemed and so he was a little afraid about should where should I preach how much should I preach but Jesus sayso not be afraid preach the word verse 10 for I am with thee who better could be with you and I than Christ Hallelujah sometimes church we need a reminders that the the one with us is the greatest one there could be Nobody Greater with you than the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah for I'm with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee what a promise for I have much people in this city so Jesus says don't fear I'm with you preach the word I'm going to give you many souls in this city Hallelujah and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them Hallelujah so here we see a supernatural testimony God gives a dream right and God backs up the dream do you remember Steve Alexander he said for 10 years he had prayed God would raise up a church in akan 10 years Hallelujah so what did God do did God hear his prayer 10 years before I got here amen he was already praying God raise up a church in a raise up and his relatives some of them have even come to the church I remember one time I preached specifically on Martin Luther and John Wesley and we talked his his uh relative's name was Daniel after service and I tried all I could do to convince him and talk to him and emailed him over and over again and the ball was left in his Court to get back to me to prove if what I said was true or not so it must have been true because he never got back with me but for 10 years he prayed God raised up a church and here we stand we're raised up by the grace of God hallelujah Still Standing on the Promises of God hallelujah the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against this Revelation Hallelujah that's right church amen fight though he may Satan cannot Prevail against the Church of the Living God hallelujah cuz why Jesus is with us Hallelujah and he has people in this city I don't know if we got much in this city but we got some and some's better than none Hallelujah glory to God all right now read through that so now we can see the spiritual uh start of the church now I'm going to skip down to the first correction so back to 1 Corinthians 1 if you would because I'm going to end with uh the beginning of the the chapter little little backwards but I'm that's how I'm going to do it today I felt led to do that my God Grace so let's look at the first correction here verse 10 now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so now I like it he gives nine verses of encouragement but then in verse 10 kind of like when our girls have those pen pals you know all starts with all the nice things at the front that's what Paul starts his letters all the nice things at the front Hallelujah now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and the same judgment and let's apply that to ourselves what do each person here what do we want to happen today we should want the same thing today Hallelujah we should have the same thing in mind that Christ might be glorified if you paid attention uh uh remember these prayer requests we should pray for these we should have that mind God minister to the sick and the hurting be with The Travelers uh whatever the the need of is the church at The Hour That should be our mind the same mind Hallelujah the same judgment Hallelujah but see Satan brings divisions right and so we're we're we're mindful of that and Paul gives us that that's the first issue that he addresses is division people have different things on their mind well I got that on my mind I got that and just 180 degrees different people are thinking about different things we should all be thinking about the same thing Hallelujah and where did Paul hear about it look at this verse 11 for it have been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the House of Khloe that there are contentions among you so this was some this was a problem that uh kept going on there was divisions and contentions between groups in the church now this I say that every one of you saith I'm a Paul so now we get down to the depths of what it was you had all these Believers one says I'm a Paul Paul I got saved in Paul's Ministry one said I got saved in Apollo's Ministry another one said I'm a Peter he's got he's the rock he had the Keys of the Kingdom right so but it was division so they were all thinking oh they were thinking oh this church should have been run like Apollo's Church why isn't this church run like Peter's church because it ain't Peter's church it's Christ's Church right and then there was the Su here's the super spiritual group I'm just of Jesus I love Jesus that's the real spiritual group right there oh I I don't I don't need any man to teach me I I it's just I'm of Christ that's the real spiritual group right there you can't tell them nothing because I just follow Jesus sound similar to today well I'm of that brother's Church of that brother new brother Brandon and that one and this one and all these connections right people were taking pride in men rather than rejoicing ing in God he gets to at the end of the chapter he says he the glory needs the glory in Christ Hallelujah now you should respect the preachers you should respect all the preachers the Bible said give double honor to those who labor in the word of God in Doctrine but honor is not the same as praise hallelujah praise just means going over and above basically worship you want to honor and say thank God I appreciate a faithful Pastor I appreciate a faithful evangelist I appreciate a faithful prophet of God but we never go into praising them or or or just uh thinking that our main connection's with them our main connection is with Christ but this was this was the first problem he addresses there's divisions some people are minded like this well it should be like Paul said should be like Apollos should be like sephus well should just should be like Jesus said it and everybody was divided based upon their favorite message preacher I'll say like that Hallelujah so Paul asked him a good question is Christ of Ed Hallelujah was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul no Christ is not divided Paul was not crucified for you you were not baptized in name of Paul right I thank God that I baptized none of you but chrispus and gas so this tells us quite a good testimony about these two brothers Paul said I'm glad I just baptized them because they're real solid and they don't worship other men right that's what he says so Paul says a lot of the church here was prone to worshiping a preacher they were prone to favor certain preachers Hallelujah he says but I'm thankful I know those two brothers are solid they won't get into this uh divisions about who's the greatest preacher lest any should say that I'd baptize in my own name so these people were so zealous for their favorite preacher some of them would go overboard and say well I was B baptized in the name of Apollos I was baptized taken away from Christ they were so into man worship it's like they worshiped every word he said on the tape or something like that because that's what some people do they baptize in the name of William brandham Brother Ram knew about it and he left the field in other words he left traveling for a little while until the problem was solved and it was in uh June of 1961 you can listen to it I preached it before but you can go back and listen to it I want you to see what brother mam said about Paul I like this speak a moment on faith cometh by hearing I love this word and the word of faith how many love the Bible now we think of Faith what it is Paul first speaking to the Romans which had been heathens and idolators had just come over into Christianity and here Paul is the greatest missionary the world has ever had since Christ here's what we got to remember we can't call ourselves ever the greatest but we can uh but we can let Jesus call us whatever he wants to call us that's right so other words Paul never said I'm the greatest he said I was the least of the Saints that's right Hallelujah but if other people want to say it fine as long as you're not worshiping and praising them could we say Paul was the greatest by honoring him certainly you know why church because he's got the resume that's right Hallelujah he's got a resume of suffering longer than I don't know longer than your grocery list right I'm talking about when you're low on groceries yep his list of suffering is so low that brother Ram could stand there and say he's the greatest missionary I like those last two words since Christ Hallelujah brother Braham would not worship a man Hallelujah this is why I can't believe some people say we're going to do Greater Works than Jesus if there's no greater missionary than Jesus how can you do a greater Miracle than Jesus I've yet to see any preacher today walk on water right I yet to see any preacher they raise a dead man after three days I have never seen it now they might have a testimony of somebody raised after 35 minutes of death or 10 minutes or maybe an hour I've never heard three days have you brother William been around the message over 40 years he's never heard it see so people they they go too far on certain ideas and and they forget that there could be nobody greater than Jesus amen but the Corinthians had had so majored on a man they were majoring on men rather than majoring on Christ they wanted to be divided they were trying purposely not not to be unified God help us to get into the unity of the holy spirit amen hallelujah they purposely would be divided well I'm of Apollos no no no no I'm a Paul the real saint of God who had the Damascus Road experience they were purposely trying to be divided God help us to be purposely United Hallelujah to lay aside our thoughts and our differences and our opinions that's what God honors God honors Unity hallelujah how many want to see uh the day of Pentecost take place again well what did the Bible say they were all in one place and all in one Accord if we want to see Power if we want to see God move if we want to see the spirit of God let's all start S thinking the same thing Hallelujah right not be divided but be United in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I like I said on Wednesday you know uh God will use me in different places we'll see Miracles and everything like that and it's all because people got in one Accord that's all it is we just got to get in one Accord Hallelujah I found a quote two weeks ago I haven't preached it yet but brother ad said where's the power in the church and he says where's the power to help women not to cut their hair he said where's the power for a woman to wipe the makeup off her face I said we got that power amen where's the power to make a man stop lusting after other women Hallelujah we've got the power Hallelujah in the name of Jesus most churches don't even have that power Hallelujah glory to God the greatest missionary now go to keep your place there but go to Luke 10 real quick Luke 10 vers1 how did the greatest missionary operate his missionary work the Lord Jesus Christ Luke 10 vers1 after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place wither he himself would come so here's how the greatest missionary operated he he'd pray you know the Lord would pray he said maybe uh James and John you go to uh Damascus or Syria wherever wherever he send them right uh basa you know Tyrie whatever it is and he would pray and send two by two they would go there they' preach the gospel signs wonders and miracles would be done and they say but but but be encouraged a greater than uh John and uh and greater than Peter James and John is coming Jesus is coming Hallelujah so they were like the foraste God would send two at a time they were like the initial blast of the Holy Spirit and then they say but be encouraged Jesus is on the way that's that's how every one of us should operate we should do all that we can do but say whatever I lack Jesus will come behind and he'll bless it hallelujah amen this is how the greatest missionary worked he would send them two by two you go first and then I'll follow you up remember he said if they won't receive you he said Shake the Dust off your shoes it'll be more tolerable on a bunch of sodomites than for that City to turn on the gospel the New Testament gospel and all the signs Miracles and wonders devil casting out the prophecies it'd be more tolerable so in other words the sodomites are going to have a a more tolerable judgment in Hell than these cities that rejected Jesus and his Apostles what about today what about today when they reject the message for church entity right or worship worship tainment they reject Jesus in the message for worship tment to stay in their Creeds and their dogmas right and their sin loving societies that's really what they are but R said they're not saved they're just lodges they're sin loving lodges is what they are now there's a few saved in there thank God I'm trusting some of mine are saved in there Hallelujah my family I'm talking about Hallelujah but the majority right few there be that find it think of it that little Jewish brother so apparently Paul wasn't a big guy he couldn't set them still yet there was thousands in Jerusalem I'm sorry he just couldn't sit still there was thousands in Jerusalem hadn't been converted but he had to go somewhere else and somewhere else the whole world must hear the gospel as far as Paul could take it and how he did his best to bring it and his messages and his writing still lives on Immortal today because he spoke of Christ Jesus so whatever gift or whatever position God has given you you should have that same desire I just can't sit still like if you're a parent I can't sit sit still I've got to show love to my children I've got to show them more of the grace of God I got to keep teaching my children and grandchildren the word of God Amen I can't set still if I sing song specials I can't sit still I got to sing another special amen right I gotta glor of course it's got to be in a season right like as a preacher I can't sit still I got to get a sermon ready for Sunday morning I got to get one ready for Wednesday Wednesday night I can't sit still Hallelujah you're burdened to do it God's called you to do it and if God's called you God will equip you hallelujah amen amen and I'm doing my best who wants to do their best for the Lord hallelujah you do your best to feel the pressings of the Holy Spirit on your heart and your mind and receive dreams and visions and follow them you do your best and because you're trying to please the master Hallelujah and his message is lives on Immortal today because he spoke of Christ Jesus all right verse 16 and I baptized also the house of stefanus SO gas Christmas stefanus besides I know not whether I baptize any other so Paul was just thanking God thank God I didn't baptize a bunch of those pites church I've said it before I'm not a bromite I'm I'm a Jesus follower H I'm a Christian amen right I have no shame saying that just like brother Mar said I'm not a scoffield it he said he used a scoffield Bible but he's not a scoffield I like a worshipper of scoffield we're not worshippers of brother brandham but we know he's a prophet of God he point us to the word of God he foretold things in the name of the Lord that come to pass he's a Vindicated prophet of God hallelujah but we don't get into this thing where we worship the man like this church was worshiping men now church and think think about this uh in the midst of all this man worship they had all these gifts operating all the time so it proves gifts operate when people have them and when they're yielded to God and yet sin can be laying out in the church and leaven all over the place gifts can still operate because they're there and people are dedicated and invest in their gifts hallelujah amen every said I mean all this tongues all the prophecy uh interpretation Pro everything I'm going to show you another verse Paul's Paul said you have every gift Paul told him you have all the gifts it's not like they were lacking gifts God didn't shut down their gifts right did God shut down balam's gift no do we ever learn of God shutting down judas's gift no the gift doesn't get shut down but see in the midst of all that God was asking them you know they're operating that see they're partaking of two different right they're partaking of the spirit and then they're partaking of the flesh right sometimes uh bam would would go seek uh uh uh witchcraft right uh I forget the exact word the Bible said he would seek enchantments there it is he would seek enchantments other times he would seek Jehovah so these Corinthians would come together have all kinds of gifts every gift operate but then they'd be real carnal outside of church especially on communion Sunday they would set up all their meals and their tables and they wouldn't let the poor people come to the CH to come to the table and they'd be some of them would be getting drunk at the Lord's table a message Church Hallelujah for Christ sent me not to baptize isn't that something you would think every preacher was sent to baptize now Paul's just dealing with how they uh they were so worshiping men that uh their baptism was so important to their social status or their popularity as a Believer well I was baptized by Paul all I was baptized by Apollos I've been to Jeffersonville four times I think I've been four times I've been Jeffersonville 10 times you know they were trying to glory in themselves Paul said Christ did not send me necessarily to baptize in water but to preach the good news Hallelujah not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect he's talking about not Christ wisdom he's talking about worldly wisdom the worldly wisdom makes the cross uneffective see church I hope the cross could affect somebody today where the cross would give you power today if you're lacking power it's because you need to go to the Cross because that's what the Bible says the power of the Gospel is in the cross of Jesus Hallelujah like I told you when I've cast out Devils those six or seven times I always plead the blood I say the blood of Jesus Christ is against you and that's when they scream and that's when they fall the blood they they don't they don't like the blood because the blood has paid the price for our sins the blood pays the price which sets us free Hallelujah that's right right we're not under brother R said Satan has a legal right to stay there as long as the sin is unconfessed as long as there's leav in in the Life sin can stay there but as soon as that's confessed and trusting in the blood to forgive it that devil has to go Hallelujah right it has to go it's a legal issue Hallelujah that's right see those that need power you need the cross today that's what I need that's what you need Hallelujah that's what this chapter is about the power of the Cross hallelujah amen so it's man's Wisdom that makes the cross of none effect Jesus talked about it also in Matthew 15 I'm not going to go there but he said you teach Traditions the doctrines of men therefore the word of God has no effect so when people uh when preachers preach their own false Doctrine like their own idea or something it takes away from the power of the Cross if they just preach it plain and simple there's power God backs up the simple truth of the word of God hallelujah God backs it up amen I keep bringing that up I'm going to keep bringing it up you know just to see the Simplicity the summer of preaching against uh sexual immorality in pornography to see the power of God move in a place like that it again again shows us the power of the cross of Jesus Christ grown men crying grown men uh laying on their faces crying it's not all over their faces you saw it the power of the Cross Jesus can set you free you might be in Chains but Jesus Paid the price to break the chains Hallelujah that's the power of the Cross amen hallelujah it's that simple and if we could all get the same mind today if we could all think the same thing today that power is here hallelujah amen that's what Paul's talking about but see the false wisdom of manw makes the cross uneffective the cross doesn't mean anything for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolish why does Paul keep preaching on the cross why can't he move on to something more outstanding I'm sorry there's nothing more outstanding than that there's no more nothing more outstanding than Jesus saying father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and it is finished hallelujah what could be more powerful than that Hallelujah that the sin question is settled hallelujah what could be more powerful than that butto us which are saved how many saved we got in here today it is the power of God the preaching of the Cross is power Hallelujah that's right Church it was to me Hallelujah it was to me the preaching of the Cross was power to me power to change your life for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise doesn't he do it all these big philosophers that rise up don't they all go down to the Grave eventually he destroys all their ideas and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent right where's all their deep understandings today they're not here where's the wise where's the describe where's the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world aren't they so foolish they're so foolish they got on these robes brother Austin they call themselves Supreme Court and they ask him uh what is a woman I don't know I'm not a biologist foolishness you're all dress in your robes and got your gavels and all this all this foolish wisdom of the world I don't know what a woman is how about you go look at your X and Y Chrome why don't you do that anybody knows that see God makes them look foolish because they despise the Simplicity of God's word the wisdom of God hallelujah like it's turned into now what what's it been turned into now it's U it's called mental health now instead of demons instead of addiction it's called mental health you a bunch of demons that's what they are I've got mental health problems no you let sin into your life devils are living in your mind Paul said neither give place to the devil hallelujah amen I'm not talking about if it's like a genetic thing or you're born you know because of maybe the vaccines or something that would change somebody's whole Spirit I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a uh these adults right that that were we'd say uh normal but afterwards now they got all these mental problems well they probably got so many mental problems because they're so idle in the old days you just work the work your tail off all the time right and they kind of spank you into submission in the old days that was right before my days hallelujah right that's my parents would tell me about that they got spanked a lot more than I did and I got spanked very little and now my children get spank very little but we have to do what we have to do by God's grace amen but look at the foolishness of the world verse 21 for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God see their worldly wisdom takes them away from God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe so God is pleased when we preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and people come up here and get saved Hallelujah I remember that night you know nature and virtue come up here and got saved and uh Benny's girlfriend's daughter what was her name chette I don't know why that that Wednesday night I think I was preaching on Martin Luther or something brother Austin I don't know what it was I was I thought in my mind I thought well this is this is kind of like a review on the cross you know I didn't know how it was going to turn out I just you know the spirit got on me I just kept preaching the blood preaching the blood and I just threw the net out you know CU we had visitors who wants to be saved and the first one up here is a visiting girl crying her eyes out want to be saved it didn't look very astounding it wasn't I'd say the uh the wisest sermon I ever preached with a maybe the the most depths of Revelation I simply preach the cross hallelujah hallelujah and three people come up and weep in their way uh to Christ and get baptized Hallelujah and like brother R said about hady writes boys look at how they uh he said look at the Hatty R's boys they got saved look how they do communion and feet washing look how our sisters do feet feet washing and communion they're the ones delivering the tubs so we can wash our Dirty Feet hopefully they're kind of clean but look at that look at the effects of the Gospel just preaching the simple gospel and we didn't know I didn't know all the talks they were having at home you know our young sisters here by God's grace I didn't know all that all I know is this I got to preach what God presses on my heart thank God that he presses things on our hearts thank God for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit praise God amen amen what if that night I would have preach on the uh the depths of the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders with the third pole would have had the same result probably not that have been good to learn right that it's all good to learn that but there's nothing as more powerful as the cross Hallelujah that's what the Bible says because the greatest Miracle of all is a soul that saved passes from Death unto life Hallelujah pleases God by the foolishness of up preaching to save them that would believe I believe Hallelujah I believe in the cross of Jesus Christ for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek wisdom so what what are you more likely to do are you more spiritually Jewish and you got to have a sign a miracle for everything or you have to have a preacher that's so perfect and every word he said takes in such deep uh thoughts and Revelation Paul's he's given a contrast here I'm trying to apply to our lives we're neither we're not Jews right but some people on both sides right like that's the what I call them the goat movement but I do believe they're saved and many of them I believe some of them are filled with the Holy Ghost they're just majoring on Miracles right now got to have a miracle got to have a sign every sermon and now church I'm not criticizing this but every sermon sounds like what's your Miracle at the end and God's going to bring home your wayward loved ones that's like almost every sermon ends with that well that's okay that's what they're seeking they're they're older you know some of them are older parents grandparents they want their loved ones their wayward children to come home now what am I end with a lot uh getting right with God living a Pure Life sanctification you know CU that's where we are our children thank God haven't gone Wayward and the church said amen hallelujah thank God that's a blessing we're a blessed Church Hallelujah God's protected us no one's in the hospital no one's got cancer no one's uh running our children aren't running around in the world thank God for the hedge of the Holy Spirit praise God it's good to remember what God has done for us hallelujah how he has protected us us give us three baptisms this year by God's grace Hallelujah young people in the prime of their life where they could if they ever wanted to be sinful this would be the time to do it brother said if you would have given me a choice of break up 100 years into quarters he said which one would you want to live he said if you want to be a muscle man or a beautiful woman you better choose that first quarter 0 to 25 you want to be a beautiful actress you better choose that one he said' if they would ask me he said I would taken that last one he said because I'd know more about it I'd know how to preach the gospel amen I'd have more wisdom amen i' have more understanding I wouldn't rely on the flesh I rely on the spirit Hallelujah that's what we need to rely on is the holy spirit so see Jews require got to have a sign got to have a sign the Greeks seek after wisdom needs to be more wise that was that was chopped up spitting all over the place confused said the wrong words they got to have wisdom but what do we preach we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews this stumbles them because it's not the sign they wanted Jesus said I'm going to give you a sign it's a sign of Jonas amen hallelujah but they didn't want that sign and to the Greeks oh it's foolish was wasting your time you know talking about a man who died 2,000 years ago now that that's what today people say people say you I've seen it online some of these uh Debaters over over the the years they say look how silly Christianity is you're trusting in a man that lived 2,000 years ago and you think that maybe he raised from the dead that that that because maybe he raised you expect to raise some someday when we've had 2,000 years is nobody raised from the dead he they said don't you see how foolish this is but yet that's the power that's the truth of God Amen Hallelujah Jesus did live a s a sinless life Hallelujah he was the Lamb of God he did raise from the dead Hallelujah and all those if that same spirit that was in Jesus is in you it shall Quicken your mortal body hallelujah it's the promise of God it cannot fail Hallelujah see see to look in 2,000 years like no one's even raised up and no one's been resurrected for 2,000 years and yet you believe that yes I believe that amen with all my soul H with all my heart amen because every seed of God must fall on the ground rot and then be Resurrected hallelujah praise God that's what Jesus said about himself amen I've got to be put into the ground and rot and then I'll bring forth much fruit and that's what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 right there's two kinds of bodies one is sown in in I'm sorry one is swn in corruption it's raised and incorruption amen hallelujah Glory now verse 24 but unto them which are called both the Jews and the Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God so Jesus is both of ours Jesus is the power power Jesus has signs and Jesus has wisdom hallelujah it's just packaged different than what the world gives Hallelujah that's right Christ gives us the power of God the signs of God and Christ gives us the wisdom of God but remember the Bible said the ungodly they will go from more ungodliness to more ungodliness their sins are going to keep getting worse and worse Our Lives should get more holy and more holy in other words we're progressing on that Ark like I preached last Sunday we're pro progressing on that Ark into greater maturity and also greater Revelation and also a holy life that's the progression Hallelujah see that's why you know brother William and sister be over the years they see the preachers let down on the bars that's the that's the downward Arc we've got to keep the bar right we got to keep the bar raising Hallelujah we got to keep the goats out how' these goats get in here you put up the bars right we've got to keep the goats out we got to keep preaching the truth of God all God's elect will come to the truth hallelujah amen Jesus said all them that heard heard me will hear you praise God Amen that's the confidence I know brother Nia Hallelujah all them that heard Jesus will hear me because I'm preaching the same thing Jesus said that's right all the elect will come glory to God why church because the foolishness of God is wiser than men in other words the preaching of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called now remember Justice and Christmas were two of those Mighty noble people right they were they were leaders in the synagogue these were mighty men under a lot of power Financial power spiritual influence and God didn't save all of them God just saved a couple of them sometimes God does save uh we'd say the the rich and and the famous or something like that you know this year we've seen numerous people uh come out and say they're Christians right or I know you they say they believe in God now now by their fruits they're known right but see they they you know it's a surprise to some you know some big names come out and really follow God to the best that they know how but we got to ask are they wise or foolish well all their Instagram posts Will Tell Us in about five minutes if they're wise or foolish what was that one guy's name Russell BR was that his name he would used to be so filthy but now he got baptized well he's he gets on his knees and prays to uh Mary and does all kinds of things I've seen him there with with Andrew Peterson and believes he can still drink and all these things now you know people uh you know you can tell right away is that wise or is that foolish because now there's two kinds of these saved now I I Hope they've experienced the power of the Cross but the power of the Cross was to separate you from from your sin to make you love righteousness to seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness Hallelujah that's what the gospel came to do so there's not many mighty after the flesh there's not many noble that are called not many wise men Paul was one of them Paul was a mighty man right he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees I'll say like this he was the Catholic of the Catholic for our day right there was no Catholic like like like him right he was the most religious he was the most devoted to his Traditions so caught up in the in the denomination but yet God saved the Pharisee the Pharisee God had a purpose for it God has a purpose for you praise God Amen it also encourages keep praying for those people that are in high positions right maybe people that are great wise men or great uh powerful rich men keep praying for them because God Will Call some of them Hallelujah amen but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are Mighty Hallelujah I'll probably preach on that some more next time by God's grace now I want to get down to this here I'm coming up on 50 minutes here let's look at Paul's loving Spirit of Correction I was reading in 2 Corinthians yesterday look what Paul said you know so I want you to understand this as we go on in the book of First Corinthians Paul said for out of much Affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears now Paul didn't say that in the letter if you read 1 Corinthians 11 1 Corinthians the book he never says I'm crying while I'm writing this but he was he was crying about man you're arguing about the the greatest message preacher why you arguing about that right then he's going to say why you why you why you letting these people commit sexual immorality why you letting them get drunk this is the Lord's table this is Christ we don't see it in chap in this first letter but he was crying brother sister not that you should be grieved so he wasn't crying hoping they'd be grieved but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you so he wrote the correction so that they would know Paul loved them Hallelujah and that uh that then in the second letter he would know he wrote it while he was crying Hallelujah let's read uh chapter 2 2 Corinthians 2 1-6 this was a blessing to me yesterday I didn't even realize that Paul was writing all these things with tears oh yeah and isn't that right remember uh in Ephesus he said he warned them day and night for three years in tears that's right amen hallelujah crying over their sins and crying crying over the fact he knows there's going to come people come in and divide the church he said they're wolves uh not sparing the flock and they're taking members after themselves for their own following and Paul would warn them for three years in tears wolves are coming in wolves are coming in but what he do it with he did it with the love of God hallelujah verse one but I determined this with myself that I would not come unto you in heaviness for if I make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made Sorry by me and I wrote this same unto you lest when I came I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to Rejoice so Paul should have been happy but he was sad because they weren't living the right way having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all now here's the one we read for out of much Affliction of Anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you but if any have caused grief he hath not grieve me but in part that I may not overcharge you all Hallelujah so it wasn't everybody of course in the church that was off the word but numerous people were off the word of God right and he had to address it he said the love of God constrained him to do that verse seven so that con I'm sorry verse six sufficient to such a man is the punishment which was inflicted of many and I also want to read seven too so that contrarywise he ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with over much sorrow so there are some people when they repent they'll let the enemy put too much condemnation on them and then they're so sad see you know that's why it's important to have the joy of the Lord amen hallelujah see the reason sometimes people are so sad in church is because of this they make a mistake and they let Satan beat them up about it amen and they can't they can't remember that Jesus forgave it all and he takes you out of darkness and he helps you to walk in the light as Christ is in the light Hallelujah see we can't we can't dwell in our past because the devil's going to try to put that uh condemnation on us he calls it over much sorrow make you so sad about your past remember the Bible said Jesus comes to give us a hope for the future he even said that in the Old Testament he said I know I know what plans I have for you hope for a future Hallelujah plans of good not evil amen hallelujah but Satan loves to do this uh when he writes you know Paul wrote the letter of Correction uh the people got corrected they said they were sorry but Satan put too much uh punishment and condemnation on them and they let Satan do it right we all that Satan beat us up sometimes but we don't have to stay there because there's power in the cross amen hallelujah Remember The Old Rugged Cross amen hallelujah remember what it did praise God it forgave all your trespasses all your iniquities Hallelujah separate your sins as far as the East is from the West I don't remember your sins anymore Hallelujah so why do you remember your sins Hallelujah he said I'll remember them no more and yet the devil gets this guy here to over much sorrow about his sins he just can't forget all of his mistakes and sins thank God there's joy in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah even when God has to correct us we can still be joyful because he loves us he corrects all his children that he loves as many as I love I rebuke and Chas and Jesus says that's right Church Hallelujah now let's move on here now I'm going to chapter 7 just look here again he he wrote this letter because we're going to get into all these think of all these I I kind of rehearsed them on Wednesday think of all the sins that the Corinthians were guilty of yet they had the gifts everywhere they any any aisle you turn to there's a gift oh there's a gift of healing right there oh there's a gift of Prophecy right there there's a gift of Miracles there's a gift of faith right there every aisle had gifts up and down the aisles but they also had leaven in the aisles right nobody could deny those gifts are operating but there was 11 that need to be taken care of the love of God brought it to light and the love of God tried to purge it out then Satan come along and make the people feel really bad rather than just saying you're sorry moving on and getting Victory verse eight for though I made you sorry with the letter I do not repent so though I did repent for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season so see you just you're you're repenting for a little season and then you got the victory again now Rejoice not that you were made sorry but that you sorrowed to repentance so Paul rejoiced they actually were sad to repent their sadness caused them to change their life for you were made sorry after a Godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing so see when someone brings the love of God in correction it doesn't damage them it just helps them correction is not damage it's helpful if it's received with the right Spirit right that's what Paul says for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of Hallelujah but the sorrow of the world worketh death right with Judas he was sorry that he got caught we went we know that last week or was the week before they're just sorry they got caught like those Samaritans we looked at you the partial fear of the Lord on communion night they're just sorry they got caught they really they really want to keep going their sin may God may God give us Godly sorrow that we really want to repent that we really want we really want to change and it it it I think it it bears repeating there's three parts to repentance right you got to hate your sin change your thinking and make amends for it if you haven't done those three things to your sin it's going to stay with you right it's going to stay as leaven but you got to hate it you got to change your mind about it right not choose to worship it like that man who would who tried to kill brother Bram he worshiped that Spirit there therefore he couldn't get delivered from it right and then uh the last one I can't remember the last one make amends thank you yep I just coming to me make amen thank you Dy Hallelujah for behold this selfs same thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly sort what carefulness have WR in you so see church when we really repent we're careful how we're living after we leave church so often church we forget what we heard in church right or we forget what we listen to in our car I'm talking about we forget what we read in our Bible the day the morning of that same day God help us to remember praise God but see this is what real repentance does it makes you careful not to go into that sin again oh I've seen that trick before I've seen that trap before I'm not going that direction makes you careful it rought in you yay what clearing of yourself so see you cleared yourself from that I'm no longer associated with that I have moved on from my anger brother man always uses temper I moved on from my temper he must have a lot of tempers there in Jeffersonville Indiana he always talks about temper he said Temper Temper to fight a buzz saww that's a pretty good temper not good in a good way but good in a bad way pretty powerful he said you cleared yourself what ignation What Fear yay what vem desire what Zeal what Revenge that's why I preach that when Emma was here you know I preached that message on you can have revenge on Satan take revenge on him in other words when he comes around knock him out by God's grace put him under your feet praise God that's what we just Sayang that and the Bible says that in the Book of Romans he said I know shortly you'll put Satan under your feet Hallelujah so you take that Serpent and you put him under your feet no offense to Malachi who likes his snakes put that serpent under your foot take revenge right be careful how you live that's real repentance in all things you have to prove yourselves to be clear in this matter wherefore though I wrote unto you I did I did it not for this cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but for our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you so why did Paul write this letter to show them God's care God doesn't want them to continue being divided God doesn't want the people to continue to commit sexual sin right God doesn't God didn't want the people to be continually sorrowful for their sin and never get the victory over it right God didn't want them to get drunk at the Lord's table God didn't want them to despise the poor God wanted them in one mind in one Accord Hallelujah so see when God brings correction it's God's care for us God cares about us because he doesn't want us to have a leav amongst the body of Christ now here Paul had a lot to correct now these are just the first six I could find church talk about church order and problems first you got people divide over who the best preacher is I'm from that message Camp I'm from that message camp they're a better preacher than everybody he's the best preacher no he's the best preacher now today it's like she's the best preacher bunch of nonsense right now that's not the message then you had not only you had division amongst the people of of uh their favorite preachers or preacher worship you got preacher worship now you got sexual immorality in the church too got to clean that up remember Paul's writing this with tears how can these people sleep around how can they be so carnal he calls them babes we're going to get to that he calls them a bunch of baby Christians he's crying how this is what babies argue about this is what babies fuss about this ain't what a real mature Christian fuss is about right they were suing each other oh brother Austin brother William I'm gonna take you to Corn I'm gonna get my handshake back I don't know what else I give you imagine coming to church and look over somebody I'm going to take I'll see you in court on Mond Monday I'll see you tomorrow yeah God bless you I'll see you tomorrow in the courtroom this is what Paul had to write about what a church and we saw we all saw how it started a vision started this right we say oh the gifts were moving here and look what see we got to have a balance with gifts you got to have the character of Christ along with your gifts hallelujah what good is a gift if I'm going to sue you tomorrow what good good is a gift if the woman's going to chase another uh woman's husband or vice versa a man chase another man's wife what good is the gift at that point what did all those gifts do for you and Paul's crying how can this happen God have mercy where is the unity he says later there's only one Spirit there's one Lord One Faith one baptism there's different diversity there operations but it's one Spirit there were people G getting drunk at the Lord's Supper drunk and there was Pride about financial superiority well I'm richer than you no you you can't join us at this table in the fellowship H you can't join us because this is the the the the group that makes over 40K or this is the table that makes 60k 70k you keep going up the ks this is what what they found in the church that had all the gifts operating all the gifts also their order with spiritual gifts too many gifts operating too many gifts Paul has to set a limit on it because it was bringing confusion right he said we need some order to this the gifts have to come with order so we're we're we're we're men in understanding we want to understand what's going on so imagine they would have they'd have people speaking in tongues all over the church there was just chaos they have they had interpretations maybe while the preacher preaching like kind like brother went through right he would tell them okay sit down it's not time for your your tongue interpretation we don't have that one on tape but that would have been something special to have on tape God's got on tape but see that's too too much it was causing confusion and so Paul said you got to set this in order and then they even lack generosity they're in the one of the biggest cities it it was the Roman capital of Roman Greece it was said so Greece you know that big country Greece the capital of the Roman Empire in there was Corinth now of course the capital of Rome I'm sorry of Italy was Rome right I think they moved it to constan ople later on but in other words on that on that part of the the land that was the main influence of Rome was in Corinth and Paul said they lack generosity look no wonder he wrote you can move mountains but you don't have charity you're nothing you can move a mountain with your faith you can speak this into that speak that into existence but if you don't have love it didn't profit you anything Hallelujah Glory now here's the scripture they lacked no gift but they did lack love this is in chapter 1 verse 7 so that ye come together behind in no gift they weren't lacking in the operations of gifts they were lacking in love and a pure heart a pure life before Jesus amen can everybody see that by God's grace brother Ram said he couldn't or Paul couldn't teach them the Deep things of God he said he had to deal with all these light issues like this right all these sin issues like I said on Wednesday I'm going to bring this in um Wednesday I went through you know the the things we've struggled with as a church division that's probably if if if that could be the critical spirit or Pride I think that would be the one that we would battle the most over our 18 years as a church not so much no one's ever sued me thank god um I've never seen anybody drunk I've never seen Financial superiority too many gifts never seen that we want more gifts right we we believe uh lacking generosity I don't think I've seen that I was going through some of my emails just this morning you know from six seven eight years ago and the critical spirit was criticizing how I was preaching it was uh the critical spirit was calling me Prejudice and the critical spirit was telling me uh wanting to know how much tithe I received and then was trying to tell me what to preach a woman was trying to tell me what to preach I'm sorry a man tells me what to preach his name is Jesus hallelujah praise God that's right Hallelujah now just looking at you know some of the nature of these was criticized for canceling a service in the snow criticize for that criticized for uh every little thing that I could possibly do uh yeah they said I was criticized uh for preaching against the rich I was criticized I said the it said I was Prejudice for for the poor I had too much compassion on the poor well I'll take that if that's the only cons that's the only critical thing you can come against with me I'll take that by God's grace hallelujah it's you know it's interesting you know like like I said we want to come to church and we want to see where does our church fit in the Bible where does my life where do I find myself in the word of God isn't it interesting church and like I said I told you I'm so thankful no one was drunk here at the Lord's table lesson I am so thankful if we're going to battle one of these I'm thankful than F it's that Hallelujah that's why I like to keep receipts I like to keep texts and emails and all kinds of things notes on meetings to remember right so I can remember what are we fighting but what what uh uh how can we overcome by the grace of God hallelujah like brother man says it doesn't matter what you're fighting it just matters that you have the word of God to overcome that Hallelujah so we got to see ourselves I want to see myself in the word of God I want to see where do we fit of course we have room to grow I've told you that before brother manam said I think love is the greatest Force there is in the world if someone said uh come to you today and said after service what you know God led me to tell you you speak the greatest Force what force do you want in the church I'd say you might say prophecy you might say all nine gifts operating right you know rapturing Faith what would you say what's the greatest course we could have brother they'd say oh rapturing Faith the spoken word brother understand all the Mysteries we already do I got we do if it's a Bible defined mystery brother M taught us but brother said the greatest force in all the universe is love there's nothing more powerful than love and what did Paul write that correction with love correction comes by love if I had the choice tonight and I was a sinner and was standing here before God and he have said now boy now boy I'm going to give you all the nine spiritual gifts I'm going to let you prophesy and give you the spirit of Prophecy right oh tell me who's going to win the election or or what what year is the rapture prophesy for me give me the I want to know the prophecies I'm going to make you a mighty preacher give you the word of wisdom and understanding I'm going to give you the gift to speak in tongues interpret I'm going to give you a gift of healing that you'll have the great faith for the sick and I'm going to do all these things for you I'll give you all that or I won't let you have any of those but let you have the Real Love in Your Heart I'd say God give me love that's right pretty good sermon title right there is it for where there what does he quote Paul for where there's tongues they shall cease where there's prophecy it will fail where there's knowledge it it'll vanish but where there's love it will endure forever that's what drove the heart of God to send Christ to the Earth the love of God for 4,000 years God endured the wickedness of man and but then the Bible said for God so loved the world Hallelujah that he gave his only begotten son butam said take all of everything else but give me love if I had every gift in the Bible could exchange it for love I'd never wink an eye uh uh do I want to prophesy do I want tongues I want Miracle do I or that or love he wouldn't even blink an eye oh love for sure I take it right now let me feel the blessings of the Lord Jesus and his Divine love into my heart that's shed abroad by the Holy Ghost and I'll exchange it any gift in the Bible for that yes sir I'd exchange a domain if I was a king and sitting on a throne and the world was my domain I'd give every penny of it and forfeit a million years of this life in this world here as to have the love of Jesus Christ that's shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost there's nothing to compare with it that's a quote amen I probably put that on on YouTube tomorrow Glory now as I mentioned on uh I'm gonna close here pretty soon I'm already over an hour yeah I've lost my track of my time I stopped my time if our if our uh battles with critical Spirits or division well then Paul addressed that it's a warning against carnality he said neither be idolators as we some of them as is written the people sat down to eat and Rose up eat and drink and Rose up the play that was when they built the idols right they were dancing all kinds of worldly dances let us not I'm sorry let us I'm sorry neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed by the serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the dest Destroyer okay so what is murmuring what does this critical spirit lead to God destroys them right now all these things happen unto them for amples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come so all these are for us let's not be idolators let's keep our bodies pure from sexual sin let's not tempt Christ let's not complain and murmur right now all these things for for our benefit amen the love of God caused Paul to write this to us hallelujah amen wherefore let him that thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall in other words we should take warnings when we hear the word of God we should take warnings from the word of God because if we're not careful we're going to fall Hallelujah there no temptation taken you but such as common to man but God is faithful amen who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape it that ye may be able to Bear it doesn't love bear all things he's going to get to that a little bit right in two chapters see you can bear it because love can bear it God's love in you will bear it it's not your faith it's jesus' Faith it's not your love it's the love of Christ amen we have no ability of ourselves to do it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry I'm trying to close Okay so I told you I'm going to go back to the beginning of the chapter Paul could write this you know why because he knew there was bride members in that group group not all were bride not all maybe were saved not all were foolish virgin but he knew there was some bride members in there because Jesus said you've got some in there Hallelujah GE if Jesus said it surely there are some Believers in there what do he even tell him in the second letter I espoused you to one husband I engaged you to Christ that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ now nobody engaged me to my wife I engaged myself under her right but that's not the spiritual way in the spiritual way a prophet or a man of God engages you to Christ that's what the Bible says when the when a preacher preaches the gospel to you and you accept Jesus Christ that preacher engaged you uh Jesse will you be engaged to the Lord Jesus yes I will right that's what Paul says and Paul said I engage you so I can present you as a pure virgin to Christ so see Paul knew some of them in their that church with all those six problems and all these all this sin going around all the Le going around there's some real seed in there by God's grace Hallelujah and the true seed of God will accept correction because it's a love of God bring it to them because they want to be a chased versin to Christ Hallelujah that's right church now each of now since each of these messages directed to the angel the human messenger a very great responsibility as well as wonderful privilege is his lot to these men God makes a special I'm sorry makes special promises as in the case of the the 12 apostles sitting on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel then remember Paul was given a special promise that of presenting the people of the Bride in his day to Jesus so the church age messenger gets a special blessing a special privilege they get to introduce the bride to Jesus Lord Jesus you sent me to preach in Corinth you gave me a dream and vision you protected me I didn't fear I wasn't afraid because you gave me the dream and vision now Lord here's your bride here's your chased virgin to you here's your chased virgin here's your wife and everybody will stand all the other ages will stand and clap hallelujah praise God the church at Corinth made it through praise God they overcame their drunkenness and their sexual immorality they overcame their pride and their divisions they overcame their uh their class Warfare they overcame all that by the blood of the Lamb hallelujah amen and the word of their testimony praise God Paul knew there was some in there who really believed it so it will be with every messenger who has been faithful to the word of his hour and his age it will be so in the last day it will be the same special reward that was given to Paul and then brother R tells a story of going beyond the curtain of time church if we pass on before the Rapture if brother braham's dream is right we're going to be running to brother Braham saying my precious brother my precious brother you engage me to Christ right brother said when he left after the vision everything at when he was leaving people were still running to say brother Brandon brother Brandon brother Brandon Hallelujah why because he preached the gospel hallelujah amen he was engaging them to Christ in other words they didn't know Christ the way they knew it uh except through the ministry that God gave to the prophet of God the church age messenger Hallelujah because he was in the hand of Christ that was Christ's star that was Christ's light given to us and I know brother William can say amen I know beatric and my wife those of us who are in denomination we can say Amen when we were in the church the denomination it was dark but when we saw this message we saw The Marvelous Light hallelujah amen hallelujah and this next Generation can have it too Hallelujah you don't have to go out in the world you can have it uh when you seek God you can have it when whenever you're ready to meet God hallelujah draw nigh to God God will draw nigh to you Hallelujah see there's a special truth in here that although there's sin around although there's uh all this division all these things all sexual sin although that's there there's some real seed in there God knows who's who are his amen this this Foundation stands sure God knoweth them that are his Hallelujah and let him that nameth the name of Christ depart from all iniquity yeah there it is amen thank you Lord amen I'm closing with this I am going to close going back to the beginning Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ to the of go now I look at it like this I'm called to be the pastor I was called by Jesus Christ I didn't go looking for this place I didn't I didn't jockey for position I didn't debate with people to get it God called me to do it through the will of God under the Church of God which is in Corinth and them that are Sanctified look there so see there was a lot of sin but thank God brother Patrick there were some sanctify people in the church he's writing to them that are Sanctified they're set apart from the world all those drunken Corinthians right all that sexual immorality history says there were so many prostitutes there that male and female anyone could have a prostitute any night they wanted because that was the Hub of the Roman Empire there in Corinth right it was so awful but Paul says that you have been saved by Christ and you are Sanctified away from the world you're called to be Saints can everybody say this can everybody say I am already a saint ready I am already a saint it's not the Catholic Church you don't have to die and have people get testimonies off you to be a saint you already are a saint amen you already are called to be a saint Hallelujah when I gather my children for Bible time I say come on Saints let's have Bible time and some of them like Zion he's not he's not baptized yet but he's a saint Hallelujah he's going to be by God's grace if we trust the Lord amen we are already Saints we're already sanctified with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours Hallelujah see that's the thing to do church we got to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ call him like call the name call the name Jehovah call upon him right both them the cor Corinthians and us we got to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Grace be unto you I always like uh how every time Paul say says grace before peace why because you can't have peace unless you got Grace I can't have any peace in my heart until I know God gives me favor that I don't deserve and now because I've received Grace now I can have peace he never says peace then Grace he always says Grace and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ so that means you get it from the invisible Spirit father you also get it from the high priest who can be seen who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity I thank my God always on your behalf now look he he knows what he's going to write right he's going to write rebuke all their sins but he still thanks God that there's a church in Corinth ah despite all their mistakes despite all their sins and troubles brother manam said they were always brother manam said in that sermon Corinth was always in trouble that's what he said always in trouble with somebody always problems always divisions or schisms and sin always in trouble he said but those Ephesians they were a mature Church Hallelujah in other words they weren't always in trouble they were led by the spirit of God they were taught by the spirit of God they had Revelation and Revelation overcame the gates of hell that were in their lives Hallelujah I know I'm going along for forgive me here I'm ah go so fast he says uh I thank my God on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ thank God for the grace on the Corinthian Church that in everything you're enriched by Him in all utterance see everything they utter in all knowledge see God's God's life uh or God's spirit enriches your life what are the best times of your life brother Austin told me before when he gets a witness right what the best times of your life when you get to praise God love the Lord testify about Jesus right see somebody saved or whatever witness to somebody those are the best times why because it's enriching you God's spirit is anointing you and you're giving knowledge you're uttering something for the Lord even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that ye come behind and no gift they didn't lack any gifts at this church they had all the gifts waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so Paul was thankful remember he starts this is how he starts the letter he starts it with the Positive he starts with it like God has called you there's some Believers in there there are some Sanctified Saints in there and God has blessed you who shall also confirm you until the end so God's going to confirm you God's going to strengthen you God's going to establish you all the way to the end just got to get through the hard times when they're sin in the church right that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord now Church were they were they in any condition close to blameless were they close yet no but Paul knew whatever God started God's going to finish and all those I say like this all those that want to be blameless can be blameless Hallelujah because the power of the Cross Hallelujah I'm almost done I said that three times I'm almost I am done let's stand ref the power of the Cross musicians get go Hallelujah let's sing a song
