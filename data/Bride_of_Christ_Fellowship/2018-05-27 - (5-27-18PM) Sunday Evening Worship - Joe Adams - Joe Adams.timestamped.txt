[37:01] father beyond the shadow of a doubt that
[37:03] you've sent us a spirit or the great
[37:05] comforter Lord your spirit is here you
[37:08] said you would not leave us comfortless
[37:10] Oh God but you would provide another

[37:14] Holy Spirit has been released in this
[37:15] hour in this age Lord to minister and to
[37:18] meet the needs of the people father and
[37:21] I'm asking Lord you to North East lips
[37:22] of my mere mortal flesh and clay but you
[37:25] would anoint him father to be as an
[37:27] instrument of righteousness Lord an
[37:29] oracle of God this evening you as speak
[37:32] with power more you would speak with
[37:34] authority this people boy and you would
[37:37] anoint the ears of the listener to hear
[37:38] what the spirit would say in the way
[37:41] that it would be say father we just want

[37:46] Lord that you've allowed us to come back
[37:48] together once again we pray Lord you had

[37:55] every heart or at each and every
[37:57] situation that we wouldn't do or may you
[37:58] had the preeminence father may we not
[38:00] lean to our own understanding Lord may
[38:03] we lean upon thee O God O Father we
[38:06] thank you now we just commit to
[38:07] time to you commit this service down to
[38:09] your care for we ask it in Jesus name
[38:12] Amen if you have your Bibles as I said
[38:16] this morning we spoke on faith to speak
[38:19] in this evening I want to speak on your
[38:21] time to speak so hopefully this morning
[38:26] we elevated your face something was said
[38:28] that would elevate your faith to speak
[38:31] the words of God to have the authority
[38:33] and the confidence that which you ask
[38:35] God is able to do it so I want to give
[38:38] you more ammunition for the devil for
[38:39] when he comes to tell you that you're
[38:40] just a little nobody you're never going
[38:42] to amount to anything but God's giving
[38:44] you the jurisdiction in this hour to
[38:46] speak on his behalf and I just want to
[38:49] say it was a wonderful time at a
[38:50] wonderful time this morning in the
[38:51] service I felt the Liberty to speak I
[38:54] didn't feel any restraints or anything
[38:55] and you know when you travel to
[38:57] different churches and you preach
[38:58] sometimes there's that ice breaking
[39:00] service where you kind of have to crack
[39:02] the people open or they crack you open
[39:04] or somebody's getting crack nevertheless
[39:06] you know and ice is broken and we can
[39:08] just enter it into a warm fellowship you
[39:10] know I want to say as a testimony to
[39:12] brother Jesse into the church here that
[39:14] it's an easy place to come in after many
[39:16] years I'm not being here many new faces
[39:17] and just stepping up and being able to
[39:19] preach and have that Liberty and just
[39:22] feeling that just that easiness to be
[39:24] able to just lay the things out and not
[39:26] only that but have there were people to
[39:27] receive and pull from the gift of God if
[39:29] you just think you don't get that in a
[39:31] lot of places I also want to thank
[39:33] brother Bob Zimmerman for coming back
[39:35] bringing this family back and we welcome
[39:37] you here and trusted you can find a
[39:39] solace in a time of refuge a place that
[39:42] you can you and your family can attend
[39:44] service I know you're going through a
[39:45] situation we're praying with you on
[39:47] behalf of that we got something good for
[39:49] us lined up with the Lord always has
[39:51] something good for us if you come
[39:52] expecting I believe God has something
[39:54] special in John 14 we're gonna read a
[39:56] bunch of scriptures then I'll have you
[39:59] be seated but John 14 and verse 12
[40:01] verily verily I say unto you he that
[40:03] believeth on me were going back to the
[40:05] principles we spoke about this morning
[40:07] and the works that I do shall he do also
[40:10] and the greater works than these shall
[40:12] he do because I go into my father and
[40:14] whatsoever ye sow asking my name that I
[40:18] will do that the father may be glorified
[40:20] in
[40:21] son if you ask anything in my name I
[40:24] will do it first John 3 and verse 22 and
[40:28] whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[40:31] because we keep his Commandments and do
[40:35] the things that are pleasing in his
[40:37] sight John 15 and verse 16 you have not
[40:43] chosen me but I have chosen you and
[40:45] ordained you that you should go forth
[40:48] and bring forth fruit and that your
[40:50] fruit should remain that whatsoever you
[40:53] shall ask of the Father in my name he
[40:56] will give it to you John 16 and verse 23
[41:01] and in that day you shall ask me nothing
[41:03] but verily verily I say unto you
[41:05] whatsoever you shall ask the Father in
[41:07] my name he will give it to you hitherto
[41:10] have you asked nothing in my name ask
[41:12] and you shall receive that your joy may
[41:16] be full john 16 and verse 26 and that
[41:20] day you shall ask in my name and i say
[41:23] not unto you that I will pray unto the
[41:25] father John first John 5 and verse 14
[41:28] and this is a confidence that we have in
[41:31] him that if we ask anything according to
[41:34] his will he heareth us so anything that
[41:38] you ask I want you to know this even
[41:42] that he heareth us you can be seated
[41:46] this evening you may ask yourself oh
[41:53] brother Joe these are a lot of good
[41:54] scriptures a lot of good things that you
[41:56] mentioned here but you know Who am I to
[42:00] ask God who come out to come before God
[42:02] and ask God you know these things John
[42:05] 15 and verse 7 tells us that if you
[42:08] abide in me and my words abide in you
[42:12] then you shall ask what you will and it
[42:14] should be done unto you so if you abide
[42:17] I mean that the abiding there is not
[42:18] getting up every morning in a certain
[42:20] time and you got to read your Bible for
[42:22] several hours are you praying so much
[42:24] this way and you're abiding in Christ
[42:26] you're listening to the tapes but this
[42:28] word abiding there means it means for us
[42:30] to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[42:32] so you're abiding and may your body
[42:34] my spirit and my spirit is abiding in
[42:36] you so we find out when Jesus was here
[42:39] that Jesus did many many things because
[42:41] he had faith in his position he knew who
[42:44] he was and brother manna makes a
[42:46] statement and I said he knew who he was
[42:47] therefore he had faith faith could
[42:50] produce when it knowed who he was and if
[42:52] we abide it goes in if you abide in me
[42:54] and my word in you then you know who you
[42:57] are ask what you will and it will be
[42:59] given so we find that faith will produce
[43:01] again in this day if we can only
[43:04] recognize who we are if that makes a me
[43:08] says now wouldn't that be wonderful
[43:09] tonight if everybody come in a prayer
[43:12] line and say I'm a Christian wouldn't

[1:04:55] panel of fun tonight Church so ask
[1:04:57] whatever you will and my God will finish
[1:05:00] the fight
[1:05:05] you don't have to figure out how God's
[1:05:07] gonna do it it ain't up to you to figure
[1:05:09] that out you don't have to figure out
[1:05:10] when he's gonna do it
[1:05:12] only thing that you need to know is that
[1:05:14] God has never lost a battle and he can't
[1:05:19] loosen up I said he's never lost about
[1:05:26] he's not gonna lose tonight in verse 11
[1:05:29] and it came to pass as they fled from
[1:05:31] here before Israel and they were going
[1:05:34] down to Beth Horn that the Lord casts
[1:05:37] down great stones from heaven upon them
[1:05:40] in Ezekiel and they died and they were
[1:05:42] and there were more which died with
[1:05:44] hailstones
[1:05:45] than the who that chosen Israel slew
[1:05:47] with the sword see the devil he may
[1:05:49] think he can outrun your sword let me
[1:05:52] tell you he may be able outrun your
[1:05:53] sword but he can't outrun your God no
[1:05:56] gods here tonight

[1:06:00] they get out of your control get out of
[1:06:02] your reach we serve a living God and
[1:06:07] there be more slew and also then David
[1:06:10] died by the soul this God that we serve
[1:06:17] as a man of war the Bible says in Exodus
[1:06:20] 15 and verse 3 the Lord is a man of war
[1:06:22] the Lord is his name oh well we don't
[1:06:28] like to talk about fine I told my young
[1:06:29] people in my church I said I you know
[1:06:31] what I was a lover and a fighter I love
[1:06:34] to fight
[1:06:36] but now by for the right thing now he'll
[1:06:39] fight for the gospel now fight for soul
[1:06:41] now fight for the real thing
[1:06:43] God's given me a purpose to fight boy
[1:06:45] let me tell you can just recognize huh
[1:06:47] God is he controlling your situation
[1:06:49] God's got an old thing that you may not
[1:06:52] be able to see in the end but God's
[1:06:53] already seen it and he's already seen
[1:06:55] you victorious he's already seen you as
[1:06:58] an overcomer he's already seen you on
[1:06:59] the other side
[1:07:00] oh go Fred Church don't worry about the
[1:07:02] situation vomits here he's the man of
[1:07:05] war I said he's a man of war tonight
[1:07:12] then Joshua verse 12 then spake Joshua
[1:07:17] to the Lord this all right tonight this
[1:07:23] make Joshua to the Lord in the day when
[1:07:25] the Lord delivered up to him a rights
[1:07:26] before the children of Israel and he
[1:07:29] said in the sight of Israel some knows
[1:07:31] he didn't do this in a closet
[1:07:34] no sir he did this for all our visual to
[1:07:38] see but there in fact is a God in heaven
[1:07:40] let me tell you the message that we
[1:07:43] received was not a message put him in
[1:07:45] the back part of a corner but Noah still
[1:07:47] went around the world seven times until
[1:07:49] his two regions of foreign lost lands of
[1:07:51] Japan where there never was a message
[1:07:53] Church but yet God is beginning to do it
[1:07:54] work overseas I'm saying God is not a
[1:07:57] God to sit by and be idle be and I put
[1:07:59] it out there for everybody he died had
[1:08:01] to worry about ever fallen he don't ever
[1:08:02] have to worry about losing he knows he's
[1:08:04] going to be big hard and so he doesn't
[1:08:06] for a public display and I've got
[1:08:08] almighty in the anointed Joshua and
[1:08:13] Joshua speak to the Lord and they will
[1:08:14] the Lord delivereth dam arise for the
[1:08:16] children of Israel and he said in the
[1:08:18] sight of Israel Sun stand still upon
[1:08:21] Gibeon and thou moon in the valley of a
[1:08:23] July and the Sun Stood Still
[1:08:26] and the moon sailing to the people had a
[1:08:28] beast himself upon their enemies no
[1:08:30] church if the son can obey the voice of
[1:08:33] a man what about your condition
[1:08:35] what about your situation if the Sun the
[1:08:38] moon can stop what about that depression
[1:08:40] excellent Tina not obey the voice of a
[1:08:42] man
[1:08:43] Oh hallelujah I tell you what I feel
[1:08:45] that anointing right now oh I believe
[1:08:48] right now wherever you ask God God is
[1:08:50] able tonight so the sun's just still in
[1:08:55] the midst of heaven and haisa not to go
[1:08:57] down about a whole day and there was no
[1:09:00] day like the day before it her after
[1:09:01] that the Lord hearkened to the voice of
[1:09:03] a man for the Lord fault for Israel if
[1:09:08] he felt for the natural bride only fight
[1:09:10] for this spiritual bride ah brother bana
[1:09:15] makes a statement here and I've heard
[1:09:16] but now I see Joshua was in an hour of
[1:09:18] crisis when the armies was routed the
[1:09:21] Sun was going down Joshua was a prophet
[1:09:23] and he knew that if those armies ever
[1:09:25] got a chance to reunite again and come
[1:09:28] against him that he will lose more man
[1:09:30] so in the hour of crisis when something
[1:09:32] had been done he says there was only one
[1:09:34] thing if he could keep them running he
[1:09:37] had robbed him and every one of them
[1:09:38] down he said but there was enough light
[1:09:40] to do it Joshua stood there raised his
[1:09:42] hands up and he said son stand still and
[1:09:45] mood hang on til I get through with the
[1:09:48] battle and the Sun Stood Still they
[1:09:51] heard Joshua speak and then they seeing
[1:09:53] God they seen God in action let me say a
[1:09:56] church if you raise your hands tonight
[1:09:57] it could put us on everything that's
[1:10:00] against you and know that God is on your
[1:10:01] side and you speak for your need when
[1:10:04] you raise your hands and speak much and
[1:10:06] it puts God in action hey dad look like
[1:10:08] the thing drew
[1:10:11] see the spoken word of God he'll turn
[1:10:14] his back so that they can win the battle
[1:10:16] in the spoken word of God today will
[1:10:18] hold your enemies back hey did you win
[1:10:20] the battle it's time that we speak well
[1:10:25] I need to preach them do they know you
[1:10:26] know you need to recognize your position
[1:10:30] and when you do it puts God in action
[1:10:36] perhaps Joshua perhaps he never had
[1:10:40] tried to figure it out that's our
[1:10:42] problem we live in a day of reason
[1:10:44] social media internet we Google
[1:10:47] everything or Snopes it or whatever you
[1:10:49] want to call it we want to find out if
[1:10:51] it's real or not found people going out
[1:10:53] to find out if God's real or not you
[1:10:54] never go on Google God and get a real
[1:10:56] answer
[1:10:56] you never go smoke God out and get a
[1:10:59] real answer you got to know this guy by
[1:11:01] personal vindication he got nothing by
[1:11:03] personal experience see Josh I never
[1:11:07] tried to figure it out here was going to
[1:11:08] do it know how God was going to do it
[1:11:10] the only thing he said well son stand
[1:11:12] still he said it perhaps not knowing
[1:11:14] what he was saying because he was God
[1:11:16] they give it to him and it worked
[1:11:18] did you hear what I said and it worked
[1:11:20] and if they can work for Joshua in the
[1:11:23] day that he had a need and you got a
[1:11:24] need tonight and you're a son of God
[1:11:26] you've been adopted position replaced in
[1:11:27] the body
[1:11:28] let me tell you Church don't be afraid
[1:11:29] to speak to her let me tell you God's
[1:11:31] here to back it up and he works we've
[1:11:34] seen sister Lana we see system arrived
[1:11:36] for it we've seen the hands of God we've
[1:11:39] seen the testimonies and it works
[1:11:40] tonight
[1:11:46] well Bev says that when you live right
[1:11:48] and do right and act right and have
[1:11:49] faith in God Satan will tremble when you
[1:11:51] speak because he knows something is
[1:11:56] about to happen I said he knows that
[1:12:01] something is about to happen his hole
[1:12:03] that he's had on you can't hold you any
[1:12:05] longer
[1:12:06] no he trembles when you begin to speak
[1:12:09] because you're not speaking of your own
[1:12:11] evidence you're speaking by faith in a
[1:12:14] Living God manifested for you in this
[1:12:16] hour to minister to your needs and when
[1:12:19] you begin to speak that all he'll begin
[1:12:21] to tremble because they know that
[1:12:23] there's nothing that they can do to
[1:12:24] stand between or before then or the
[1:12:27] daughter or son of God before them and
[1:12:28] they're gone and get their petition man
[1:12:30] because God's gonna respond but probably
[1:12:32] God said he'll bankrupt heaven to keep
[1:12:34] his word - you see you gotta believe now
[1:12:42] with all your heart he said just your
[1:12:47] faith in Him your faith that says to the
[1:12:50] mountain that's before you be thou
[1:12:51] moving casts out of my way cancer you
[1:12:54] leave blindness you leave crippling
[1:12:56] yulie be cast into the sea for I am
[1:12:59] moving on with the Lord Jesus he goes in
[1:13:02] when you speak that word something will
[1:13:04] happen well brother I don't have
[1:13:08] crippled us I don't have blindness
[1:13:10] have cancer but that doesn't matter what
[1:13:11] about your situation it's the same
[1:13:13] principle you speak two words something
[1:13:16] will happen because God's obligated to
[1:13:19] keep his word and when you stand out
[1:13:21] there by faith putting your faith in
[1:13:23] God's Word it's speaking God's Word then
[1:13:25] God's obligated to make sure something
[1:13:27] happens Rob em says now I don't care
[1:13:34] what it is if you say to the mountain be
[1:13:36] moved and maybe if you got to go over
[1:13:38] the mountain for a purpose he goes maybe
[1:13:41] you got to go over that mountain for a
[1:13:42] purpose now he says somebody said well
[1:13:43] I'm a great man of faith I'll move to
[1:13:45] that mountain he said it'll never move
[1:13:48] hope of it is there's something over
[1:13:50] that mountain edge you just got to get
[1:13:52] to over there do the will of God and you
[1:13:55] can't get over you can't get on it you
[1:13:57] can't get around it yet something in
[1:13:58] your heart is telling you to go you just
[1:14:00] speak the word to this mountain last two
[1:14:05] before our sister lana was a great big
[1:14:06] mountain nobody's ever been delivered or
[1:14:08] been healed of this stage 4 cancer that
[1:14:11] she had completely consumed her old lobe
[1:14:13] in her lung but yeah we still spoke to
[1:14:16] word of god we cursed that thing in the
[1:14:18] name of the Lord Jesus and when a god
[1:14:19] dude God came up and backed up his word
[1:14:22] and that demon that had her bowed had to
[1:14:24] leave and now she's gained 15 pounds she
[1:14:27] was down to like 86 pounds and now as
[1:14:29] she's finally getting her weight back
[1:14:30] let me say God is still a god that's
[1:14:32] here today
[1:14:33] he's still the same today he still moves
[1:14:35] today he still responds to the needs of
[1:14:38] the people today God responds to your
[1:14:40] faith if you just let your faith loose
[1:14:42] one time all it takes is one time to let
[1:14:46] that faith look and you'll see God move
[1:14:48] and your see God respond and you want to
[1:14:50] speak again and you want to speak again
[1:14:52] and there'll be no hindrance to your
[1:14:53] faith see Joshua was anointed to take
[1:14:59] the land because God already told him as
[1:15:01] I was with Moses so shall I be with you
[1:15:04] now going in there Joshua and drive out
[1:15:06] the Malachi's drive out the Philistines
[1:15:08] are about to the hivite drive out the
[1:15:11] Paradise drive them all out I'll given
[1:15:13] you the land and that's exactly what God
[1:15:16] is telling you as the believer today
[1:15:17] I've already given you every promise in
[1:15:19] this book but you got to drive every
[1:15:21] devil offer
[1:15:23] telling you they for you he said telling
[1:15:25] you you're not good enough
[1:15:26] he's telling you I'm gonna call you I'm
[1:15:28] gonna destroy you but God already no
[1:15:30] need you to try about every hindrance
[1:15:31] every demonic depression everything that
[1:15:34] would come against you guys already
[1:15:35] giving you that power I was at a church
[1:15:41] one town I was speaking on Joshua here
[1:15:43] driving out the the enemies out of the
[1:15:45] land and you know as I was preaching
[1:15:47] that said parasites
[1:15:49] versus parasites I said parasites and we
[1:15:53] had a sister unbeknownst to me there's a
[1:15:54] sister in a church she had a parasite in
[1:15:56] her and she couldn't she was lactose
[1:15:57] intolerant and it just completely Kizuna
[1:16:00] he just crippled her when she drank milk
[1:16:02] and she loved milk she loved ice cream
[1:16:04] but when I spoke that she reached up and
[1:16:06] grabbed hold to it she said that's my
[1:16:07] promise I seem like I misspoke and
[1:16:10] mispronounced the word God said it
[1:16:12] exactly how she needed here and she left
[1:16:14] that service went right to the
[1:16:16] baskin-robbins or somewhere and got her
[1:16:18] an ice cream and she's not having one
[1:16:20] problem with lactose intolerance in
[1:16:22] because he's still a living God his
[1:16:25] words spoken are mortal this guitar
[1:16:27] signal can't die about diseases parasite
[1:16:30] and hereby and Felicity know whatever in
[1:16:33] this end oh my god is able tonight who's
[1:16:37] the voice not the spoken word see the

[1:19:17] don't blame I wouldn't either
[1:19:19] that's are their children and so this is
[1:19:23] in 1st Samuel 17 and verse 2 we're going
[1:19:27] to see how another son of God who knew
[1:19:29] his position how he handled the
[1:19:32] situation I believe that we can take a
[1:19:34] lot from this tonight install in the men
[1:19:37] of Israel were gathered together and
[1:19:39] they pitched by the Valley of Elah and
[1:19:41] they set the battle in array against the
[1:19:43] Philistines and the Philistines stood on
[1:19:45] a mountain on one side and Israel stood
[1:19:47] on the mountain on the other side and
[1:19:48] there was a valley between them
[1:19:50] and they went out of champion out of the
[1:19:53] camp of the Philistines named Goliath of
[1:19:54] Gath whose height was six cubits of span
[1:19:57] and they had a helmet of brass upon his
[1:20:00] head notice his attire had a helmet of
[1:20:02] brass upon his head and he was armed
[1:20:04] with the coat of mail in the weight of
[1:20:06] the coat was five thousand shekels of
[1:20:07] brass
[1:20:08] he had Greaves upon the breath Greaves
[1:20:10] of brass upon his legs and a target of
[1:20:12] brass between his shoulders and the
[1:20:13] staff of the spear was like a Weaver's
[1:20:15] beam and the spears head weight 600
[1:20:18] shekels of iron and one bang a shield
[1:20:21] went before him and he stood a knee
[1:20:23] crowded to the armies of Israel and they
[1:20:25] said unto them why are you come out to
[1:20:27] set the battle on the right am I not a
[1:20:28] Philistine and you servants of thought
[1:20:30] saw choose you a man for you and let him
[1:20:33] come down to me and if he be able to
[1:20:35] fight with me in to kill me then we will
[1:20:37] be your service but if I prevail against
[1:20:39] him and kill him then you should be our
[1:20:41] service and serve us and the Philistines
[1:20:44] said I defied the armies of Israel this
[1:20:46] day give me a man that will that may
[1:20:49] fight together and shawl and ears will
[1:20:51] heard those words of the Philistine and
[1:20:53] they were dismayed and greatly afraid
[1:20:57] now there should have been if there was
[1:21:00] anybody that should have had the courage
[1:21:02] to go out to fight it should have been
[1:21:04] saw but mama says he was head and
[1:21:06] shoulders above the rest of Israel he
[1:21:09] should have been the ward he was already
[1:21:10] handpicked by God but because he refused
[1:21:13] to obey the complete Word of God God
[1:21:16] removed his blessing and placed it on
[1:21:18] another let me tell you here he was they
[1:21:20] refined the foolish season of Felicis
[1:21:22] were meaner war they were trained in a
[1:21:24] young age and Goliath came out for forty
[1:21:27] days making a boat the same way your
[1:21:29] Goliath comes to you every day every
[1:21:32] morning when you put your foot off that
[1:21:34] man he's in a strike fear into your
[1:21:36] heart but I want you to know tonight
[1:21:37] there's got to be somebody to rise up oh
[1:21:41] here he was galosh come running down the
[1:21:44] mouth and they said brother Tim and
[1:21:46] brother Timothy there they just went to
[1:21:47] Israel about two weeks ago and they were
[1:21:50] in this very same spot the battle or the
[1:21:52] Valley of Elah and they said that
[1:21:54] Goliath here he was he would run down
[1:21:56] the mountain 40 times a day and run back
[1:22:00] up to mountain with all his gear this
[1:22:02] moment all this
[1:22:04] may alone and these trees and everything
[1:22:06] with this shield he would run 40 times a
[1:22:09] day just to show the people of Israel
[1:22:11] all his shear strength and his sheer
[1:22:14] power and that's exactly what the devil
[1:22:16] does he he comes and he torments you
[1:22:18] with this and he hits you with that and
[1:22:20] he comes and he does it over and over
[1:22:22] and over but somebody's got out and
[1:22:25] tired of hearing the boat I'm sick and
[1:22:27] tired of falling down I'm sick and tired
[1:22:30] of this lukewarm condition if anybody
[1:22:32] should us July they should have
[1:22:34] been solved but souls in a backslidden
[1:22:36] condition and the reason why we don't
[1:22:38] get victory over our glass is because
[1:22:40] we're in a backslidden condition well
[1:22:45] bro Joe what happened to you building
[1:22:47] our faith I'm not done yet
[1:22:49] oh no what we find here see the army of
[1:22:55] Israel they had the very same body that
[1:22:58] David had they served the same God that
[1:23:01] David had they were under the same
[1:23:03] Abraham covenant that David was under
[1:23:05] the only difference is David took God in
[1:23:08] His Word and they didn't you know
[1:23:10] probably God said if you want to attract
[1:23:12] the attention of God take God at His
[1:23:14] Word if you want to believe God you
[1:23:17] won't got to combine your way and
[1:23:19] minister to your knees
[1:23:20] didn't you take God in his word that God
[1:23:22] will do what His Word says he would do
[1:23:24] and if you hang your soul on that word
[1:23:26] God will bankrupt heaven to make sure he
[1:23:29] does exactly what his word declares that
[1:23:31] he will do and he'll do it for you and
[1:23:33] your do it through you and your due time
[1:23:35] and time again because why cuz you're
[1:23:37] not relying on your own effort you're
[1:23:39] not relying on efforts of a man but
[1:23:41] you're relying on dust saith the Lord
[1:23:43] and you can't fall when you're entitled
[1:23:45] thus saith the Lord we find here in 1st
[1:23:49] Samuel 17 in verse 32 and David said to
[1:23:52] Saul let no man's heart fear or let no
[1:23:55] man's heart fail because of him thy
[1:23:57] servant will go and fight the Philistine
[1:23:59] now we all know that David was a young
[1:24:02] man at this time 1314 maybe years old
[1:24:06] today he was just a young man here he
[1:24:08] says you know I'll go fight him don't
[1:24:10] worry that only money's heart nobody's
[1:24:12] heart Spillman you know Saul came to
[1:24:13] David he says you know you just to use
[1:24:16] he's a man of war
[1:24:18] but the book of Timothy Paul tells
[1:24:21] Timothy let no man despise IU's God can
[1:24:25] use the youth so of us close minded
[1:24:28] parent to get out of the way come on
[1:24:32] help my pastor who started pastoring
[1:24:34] when he was like 15 years old there's a
[1:24:38] young man on the field today brother
[1:24:40] Andrew Glover is 21 years old he
[1:24:41] preaches like he's been preaching for 40
[1:24:43] years a man is amazing and he's a young
[1:24:45] man started preaching when he was 13
[1:24:47] years old let no man despise thy youth
[1:24:50] if God has done something in your heart
[1:24:52] and there's no fear to face any devil
[1:24:54] out there and I say come on and come in
[1:24:57] cuz you're more like whipped in some of
[1:24:58] the old people that sit there and they
[1:25:00] watch this and they would then I got
[1:25:01] lukewarm and dilatory and they don't
[1:25:03] want to fight any longer I'll tell you
[1:25:05] we need some young people rise up then I
[1:25:07] take this message to the coming of the
[1:25:09] Lord
[1:25:09] tell me blow fire for God and they see
[1:25:12] God Lou
[1:25:13] he no longer got a history but he's a
[1:25:15] now God he's a very present help he's
[1:25:18] the God that responds to the needs of
[1:25:20] the people so I said what you're just
[1:25:23] using he's a man of war from his youth
[1:25:26] David said unto Saul you know what can't
[1:25:30] say quite like that they didn't use the
[1:25:31] word you know what back in that day I'm
[1:25:34] putting that in Louisiana terminology
[1:25:35] y'all like that don't a little bit of
[1:25:37] southern this to it you know what I'm
[1:25:43] sorry brother Jesse yeah baby another
[1:25:47] eight years will you get back here buddy
[1:25:48] oh I feel I feel free tonight just a
[1:25:54] print
[1:25:56] David sending us all thy servant kept
[1:25:58] his father's sheep and there came alive
[1:26:00] and a bear and he took a lamb out of the
[1:26:04] flock and I went after him notice he
[1:26:07] wasn't fear and trembling shaking and
[1:26:09] was afraid to do anything no he goes I
[1:26:11] went after him and I smote him and I
[1:26:13] delivered it out of his mouth
[1:26:14] and when he rose up against me I called
[1:26:16] him by the beard and I smote him and
[1:26:19] slew a little fourteen-year-old kid
[1:26:23] maybe he wasn't afraid though because
[1:26:26] God's already showed him that he was
[1:26:27] real he was in aa servant that servants
[1:26:30] slew the
[1:26:31] the line and the bear and this
[1:26:33] uncircumcised Felisa notice what he was
[1:26:36] speaking now what was going to happen to
[1:26:38] this uncircumcised philistine he says
[1:26:41] now this uncircumcised Philistine he
[1:26:43] shall be as one of them seeing that he
[1:26:45] has defied the armies of the Living God
[1:26:47] and David said moreover the Lord that
[1:26:50] delivered me out of the pole of the line
[1:26:52] and out of the polar bear he will
[1:26:53] deliver me out of the hand of the prison
[1:26:56] only happened he was having a positive
[1:26:58] testimony he was speaking though he
[1:27:01] couldn't see it though he didn't know
[1:27:03] what was gonna happen he trusted in on
[1:27:05] seeing God and God thought he delivered
[1:27:07] him from a bear and God delivered him
[1:27:09] from a life and if God could do that
[1:27:11] surely Dokken delivery from July it is
[1:27:14] God's enemy from spoken hate Rican hate
[1:27:17] cussin and woman eyes and a life will
[1:27:19] cease surely he can heal your six body
[1:27:21] surely you come on your situation
[1:27:23] surely God can move tonight surely he's
[1:27:26] the same today as he was yesterday
[1:27:29] see David begins to recite his testimony
[1:27:33] you know God put David through the
[1:27:35] little bear trial then he had my little
[1:27:39] Jenny had him on line trial because I
[1:27:41] was the king of the jungle
[1:27:42] you know so he faced the bear hindi war
[1:27:46] and he faced the line anyone in the same
[1:27:49] God he allows you to go through the
[1:27:51] different trials and every time the
[1:27:53] trial gets a little bit bigger because
[1:27:55] God knows one day you're gonna face
[1:27:57] you're gonna lie but he don't want you
[1:27:59] to have fear he don't want you to be
[1:28:00] trembling he wants you to know the same
[1:28:02] God delivered you from the door is the
[1:28:04] same guy the living you from the love
[1:28:06] and he's the same God tonight that to
[1:28:08] the deliver you from this garage
[1:28:09] situation actually God's is an
[1:28:12] uncircumcised philistine he died the
[1:28:14] coming of the rock that means you've got
[1:28:15] the power you've got the authority
[1:28:17] you've got the jurisdiction over here
[1:28:22] but the thing is that you need to never
[1:28:24] forget never forget your testimony no
[1:28:29] matter how small the victory was never
[1:28:33] forget the many victories that God has
[1:28:35] wrought in your life because there's
[1:28:38] going to be times you're gonna have to
[1:28:39] pull from those testimonies say God you
[1:28:42] deliver me here
[1:28:43] you brought me through this can
[1:28:45] you know recall the way I came to the
[1:28:47] Lord and I don't mind this is not in my
[1:28:49] notes but I'm just going to share this
[1:28:50] to that bill it lay Liberty to say it

[1:30:03] point tonight that I wanted to commit
[1:30:05] suicide and ain't I Hank I contemplated
[1:30:07] pulling my car off into a ditch at 120
[1:30:10] miles per hour and the Lord something

[1:38:46] Philistine said to David hey my dog
[1:38:48] without comes to me with staves and the
[1:38:51] Philistine cursed David by his gods and
[1:38:54] if listening said to David come come to
[1:38:57] me and I will give your flesh into the
[1:38:58] fowls of the air and to the beasts of
[1:39:00] the field that's what he tells you I'm
[1:39:03] gonna destroy here there's no way for
[1:39:06] you to get victory look verse 45 and
[1:39:09] this is how you talk to the devil then
[1:39:13] David said to their dens David
[1:39:15] yeah then said David to the felicity's
[1:39:16] thou comes to me with a sword and with a
[1:39:19] spear and with the shield but I come to
[1:39:22] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[1:39:23] the god of the armies of Israel whom
[1:39:25] thou the finest notice David didn't have
[1:39:28] a sword he didn't have a spear till I
[1:39:30] told him my sword is greater than your
[1:39:32] spear my sword is greater than this he's
[1:39:34] got superior weapons but David wasn't
[1:39:36] looking at his weapons David was looking
[1:39:38] at one thing I got a testimony
[1:39:39] I've already seen God move I seen the
[1:39:42] supernatural there's no way for a man to
[1:39:44] defeat a bear or a lion but my God's
[1:39:46] done it and it may seem that the enemy's
[1:39:48] weapons are more superior to your little
[1:39:50] semen imitator if you release that sling
[1:39:52] in the name of the Lord God of hosts
[1:39:54] ain't a devil he'll just stand before
[1:39:55] you and we find we find that he knocked
[1:40:03] Goliath down otherwise God called hold
[1:40:07] of that stone and not Goliath but David
[1:40:11] already said what was going to happen so
[1:40:15] he had already spoke I'll go take your
[1:40:17] head off
[1:40:18] so the words spoken had to be coming in
[1:40:21] action David couldn't just lay him there
[1:40:24] let him stay there
[1:40:25] no he had already spoke the word what
[1:40:26] was gonna be and so he had to be
[1:40:28] anointed in which he was to finish he
[1:40:31] didn't have a spear for the Jews he
[1:40:32] didn't have a sword one day the Bible
[1:40:34] says he went over and he stood on the
[1:40:36] full listing I said he stood on top of
[1:40:40] living teacher it's time to to stand on
[1:40:42] top of your felicity I'd ever come to

[1:40:52] now when he was giving that's also where
[1:40:54] you take that sword by faith and begin
[1:40:57] to act on that devil and finally he
[1:41:06] reached down in internet hell up all of
[1:41:09] Israel shows the head of July what
[1:41:12] happened Roseau got courage if David
[1:41:15] could do that we can - hallelujah

[1:41:20] make they've been overcome depression we
[1:41:22] can turn holy it just sparked a fire and
[1:41:32] all the visual come running off that
[1:41:34] mountain they pursued after their enemy

[1:43:05] Romans 10 and verse 6 will bring us on
[1:43:09] down to a cloth but the righteousness
[1:43:13] which is of faith speaketh on this wise
[1:43:19] say not in a heart who shall ascend into
[1:43:21] heaven that is to bring Christ down from
[1:43:24] above or who shall descend into the deep
[1:43:26] that is to bring Christ up again from
[1:43:28] the dead but what saith it the word is
[1:43:31] what come on church stay with me just a
[1:43:35] few moment as the word is what the word
[1:43:38] is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in
[1:43:42] the heart that is the Word of Faith
[1:43:45] which we preach but that makes a
[1:43:52] statement here and here you him he said
[1:43:54] there be a power put in the church and
[1:43:56] now it's coming now it's coming in that
[1:43:59] the Holy Spirit was so anointed people -
[1:44:02] they'll speak to
[1:44:03] and they will create itself right there
[1:44:06] we haven't seen powers like that just
[1:44:09] coming into the church now I know it for
[1:44:11] a fact
[1:44:12] say it to this mountain be moved and not
[1:44:13] doubt in your heart but believe that
[1:44:14] what you said shall come to pass then
[1:44:16] you shall have whatsoever you said the
[1:44:18] placing of the church in position where
[1:44:21] the fullness of the power of the Holy
[1:44:23] Ghost comes into the church then the
[1:44:25] critics mouth will be shut that was 1960
[1:44:30] were sixty-eight years passed if there
[1:44:34] was a power coming into the church in
[1:44:35] 1960 what power is in this church today
[1:44:39] that was abroad in infant form we're no
[1:44:41] longer in an infancy church were a bride
[1:44:43] Church we're mature we're a church that
[1:44:46] knows how to respond knows how to speak
[1:44:48] know the Bible says she knows what he
[1:44:51] wants done with his word or she stays
[1:44:53] still so each of you right now that's
[1:44:57] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:58] and you've been adopted into the family
[1:44:59] of God and each of you right now lays
[1:45:02] the power and the authority to speak to
[1:45:04] your mouth and and your Mountain must
[1:45:06] obey your voice you just need to
[1:45:10] recognize your position as a son and as
[1:45:13] a daughter of God in the messages
[1:45:16] patmans vision boom and says now man is
[1:45:18] omnipotent you don't believe that but he
[1:45:20] is a man fully surrendered to God is
[1:45:22] omnipotent did not he say in mark 11
[1:45:25] verse 22 whatsoever things you say and
[1:45:27] not doubt in your heart it'll come to
[1:45:28] pass he goes you'll have what you have
[1:45:30] said he goes what happens when to
[1:45:33] omnipotence meet when God and man comes
[1:45:35] together to Unlimited's something's got
[1:45:38] to shake o church I hope you can shake a
[1:45:42] mountain tonight to recognize I'm a son
[1:45:46] of God I'm a daughter of God I've been

[1:45:50] of Jesus Christ
[1:45:51] I mean I've received the token the badge
[1:45:53] of my Holy Ghost and went to omnipotence
[1:45:55] come in contact with one another
[1:45:57] something's gonna shake all hell's gonna
[1:45:59] shake because it ain't gonna have it
[1:46:00] told on me any longer because I'm
[1:46:02] recognizing myself as a son of God he
[1:46:04] says whatsoever you say with the
[1:46:06] creative power of omnipotence of God
[1:46:08] knowing that he promised it that he said
[1:46:10] it in his word it creates a power that
[1:46:12] goes out yonder and brings things the
[1:46:14] past things that is
[1:46:15] and makes it as though they are because
[1:46:17] to omnipotence have met he says now then
[1:46:22] if we have Zoe God's life in us we
[1:46:25] become sons of God amateur creators he
[1:46:28] said now what so ever you say believe
[1:46:30] with all your heart and you shall have
[1:46:32] whatever you ask for

[1:46:39] I'll say it anyhow he says and they come
[1:46:41] to find out it happened just the way it
[1:46:43] was said I say things I didn't hardly
[1:46:46] didn't mean for it to happen that way
[1:46:47] but it didn't help because why cuz I
[1:46:49] said it he goes in when you believe it
[1:46:55] and you speak it then the creative word
[1:46:57] goes out it's a part of God see it's
[1:47:00] create it and we'll end with this quote

[1:47:05] the Pergamus church so in a spirit born
[1:47:09] spirit filled man in faith takes the
[1:47:12] Word of God in his heart and place it

[1:47:41] almighty speaking because all hell's
[1:47:44] going to be backing up because all

[1:47:59] anointing the supreme being the Holy
[1:48:01] Ghost speaking through you and every
[1:48:03] temple has to bow before that voice and
[1:48:08] now we're sons of God part of God deity
[1:48:12] itself lives in every believer every man
[1:48:14] that's born of the Spirit of God is a
[1:48:16] part of God so I encourage you speak to

[1:52:36] of us to recognize who we are the power

[1:52:46] many times in his story he didn't have a
[1:52:49] power to stop a 300 horsepower engine
[1:52:51] but he had the authority because air the
[1:52:55] whole state or the whole city backed up
[1:52:57] to what he says in Lord we don't have
[1:53:00] the power in our human ability but we
[1:53:02] got the authority to name of Jesus
[1:53:04] Christ like and we know that all heaven
[1:53:06] backs up what we say tonight because
[1:53:08] we're not saying it on our own accord
[1:53:10] but we're saying it on the inspiration
[1:53:12] tonight as a son of God Satan in the
[1:53:15] name of Jesus tonight you take your
