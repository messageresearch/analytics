[33:45] God
[33:46] [Applause]
[33:48] hallelujah hallelujah God bless you
[33:50] let's take our Bibles here today by
[33:51] God's grace I kind of feel like singing
[33:53] more but uh I kind of know that want to
[33:56] make some progress here on this topic
[33:58] here today I'd like to preach on uh
[34:00] questions and answers on the seven
[34:01] Thunders we had some uh questions after
[34:04] the service there Wednesday so I'd like
[34:06] to try to answer those by God's
[34:10] grace so let's go to Revelation chapter
[34:12] 10 verses 3 and four by God's grace
[34:16] Revelation 10 3 and
[34:23] 4 and of course remember this is a great
[34:26] topic because it's all about the Rapture
[34:28] praise God hallelujah this is all about
[34:30] the Rapture and we all want to be ready
[34:33] Hallelujah I believe we will be you know
[34:35] we're given numerous Clues you know from
[34:36] brother brandham and of course the
[34:38] scripture uh you know there's many clues
[34:41] that we can see brother Bram talked
[34:43] about perhaps the dead in Christ will
[34:46] rise and will see them for a month or so
[34:49] like they were seen when Jesus rose the
[34:52] Old Testament saints were seen for
[34:53] numerous days before the resurrection
[34:56] I'm sorry before the Rapture of that day
[34:57] Hallelujah and so we we have that
[34:59] confidence by God's grace Hallelujah
[35:02] there's numerous other things we can see
[35:04] in the scripture we see the the the
[35:06] father coming down in the marriage of
[35:07] the son Parable Matthew 25 he comes down
[35:10] there one more time to greet all the
[35:11] guests before the ceremony starts so I
[35:15] believe that's like a latter rain that's
[35:16] another anointing that's another
[35:17] visitation from God to make sure all
[35:20] those who are going the Rapture already
[35:22] ready Hallelujah with the wedding
[35:24] garment on right and then the parable
[35:26] the The Virgins they all heard heard the
[35:28] shout they all heard the the voice at
[35:29] midnight right and they all got to get
[35:31] up and trim their lamps but one group
[35:33] had prepared oil that's what we're doing
[35:35] today we're preparing make sure there's
[35:37] oil in these vessels hallelujah amen
[35:40] Revelation 10 uh verses 3 and
[35:44] 4 Hallelujah Revelation 10 3 and
[35:48] 4 make sure my Bible is in the right
[35:50] spot
[35:53] okay appreciate those songs brother Aman
[35:56] really enjoyed those appreciate the
[35:57] special there brother Jose
[36:01] Hallelujah let's read that verse 3 and
[36:03] four ready 1 2 3 and cried with a loud
[36:07] voice as when a lion Roth and when he
[36:11] had cried seven Thunders uttered their
[36:14] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[36:17] uttered their voices I was about to
[36:19] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[36:22] saying unto me seal up those things
[36:25] which the seven thunders of
[36:28] and write them not amen let's have one
[36:30] more word of prayer Heavenly Father we
[36:31] thank you again for today Lord God we've
[36:33] sang the songs of Zion we've Worship You
[36:36] Lord God your name is Holy your name is
[36:38] life your name is power it's healing
[36:40] it's victory hallelujah it's a strong
[36:42] tower and Lord we run into it today we
[36:44] know we're safe in the name of Jesus
[36:46] Christ today so we ask Lord God you
[36:48] anoint me to speak Lord as the Bible
[36:51] tells us the five-fold ministry will
[36:53] bring us to maturity Hallelujah will
[36:55] bring us to a Unity of the faith so I
[36:57] pray that the great Holy Spirit would
[36:58] speak now Lord God and direct Lord God
[37:01] all the answers to the hearts Lord by
[37:03] the grace of God by the word of God and
[37:05] Lord we thank you for each and every
[37:06] soul that's here Lord bless your people
[37:08] Lord let your anointing be upon them
[37:09] make your faces shine upon them we pray
[37:11] Lord God hallelujah we want to be ready
[37:13] for thy coming dear God and Lord God
[37:16] we're looking Lord again for you to
[37:18] minister to these seven major needs Lord
[37:20] as as we have all these friends and
[37:22] contacts around the around the world
[37:24] Lord we'd say and we ask that you would
[37:26] move Lord for your glory Lord hear our
[37:28] humble prayers today Lord hear our
[37:30] humble cries Lord God hallelujah while
[37:32] on others Thou Art calling around the
[37:34] world do not pass Us by this morning
[37:35] Lord God we would like a visitation from
[37:38] the Holy Spirit we pray today in Jesus
[37:40] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[37:42] amen God bless you as you're being
[37:43] seated there praise
[37:48] God so you want to follow up you know uh
[37:50] from Wednesday service I did not make
[37:52] that one public uh because there were
[37:54] some personal things I wanted to share
[37:55] but if you need to listen to it let me
[37:57] know if you haven't yet I can give you
[37:58] the link to that but I'd like to just do
[38:00] questions and answers on the seven
[38:02] Thunders we had eight questions after
[38:04] service so I appreciate uh those
[38:07] questions and we'll try to answer those
[38:09] and then I just want to review when we
[38:10] review I'll just go over I'll hit the
[38:12] highlights you know of the quotes about
[38:14] the seven Thunders uh I found there's
[38:16] about 70 quotes now there could be some
[38:18] more there's about 70 by God's grace
[38:21] that I've looked at prayed about and uh
[38:24] studied on and uh so after I do the
[38:28] questions and answers then we'll just
[38:30] kind kind of review those Wednesday
[38:32] night I left off at the end of the
[38:34] seventh seal okay so I looked at most of
[38:37] the quotes from 56 all the way up to
[38:39] March of 63 and then Lord willing today
[38:42] we can look at April of mar April 63 all
[38:45] the way to the church age book uh by
[38:47] God's
[38:48] grace I want to say this as I said you
[38:50] know on Wednesday you know um I'm trying
[38:52] to be in a neutral spot you know some
[38:54] people believe the Thunders are going to
[38:55] be revealed right before the rapture
[38:58] some people believe the Thunders have
[38:59] already uttered I'm on the side I I
[39:01] believe the Thunders have already
[39:02] uttered right but if I'm wrong I want to
[39:05] stay in the middle and I want God to be
[39:07] able to move me uh into the channel of
[39:10] Revelation uh to receive if there is a
[39:13] seven Thunder Revelation but as we saw
[39:15] on Wednesday brother Bram said the seven
[39:17] Thunders have to be spoken by a
[39:19] prophet so that would mean either
[39:21] brother Ram's going to come back which I
[39:23] don't believe he's coming back except
[39:24] for the Rapture right just like all the
[39:26] dead in Christ
[39:28] but that means you know for people
[39:29] looking for that they're looking for a
[39:31] prophet to rise up so just keep that in
[39:34] mind you know if they think the Thunders
[39:36] are going to utter well they're looking
[39:37] for a prophet who's going to rise up and
[39:38] be the prophet and then they got to be
[39:40] so conclusively a prophet they've
[39:42] already had statements that have come to
[39:44] pass and prophesied in the name of the
[39:47] Lord that have come to
[39:48] pass right that that everybody can agree
[39:51] the whole bride of Jesus Christ will
[39:53] have to be able to say that person's a
[39:56] prophet so that means their prophecies
[39:58] that have already come to pass are going
[39:59] have to be spread around the internet
[40:01] all around the world right it's going to
[40:03] have to be spread so that's why I
[40:04] believe my conviction is they've already
[40:06] uttered through brother bram's Ministry
[40:10] okay but I want to remain in the m in
[40:11] the ne neutral in the middle because
[40:13] either side we don't have thus sayith
[40:14] the Lord and if we don't have thus
[40:15] sayith the Lord then we need the Lord to
[40:17] give us God's grace right we need him to
[40:19] give us a revelation Hallelujah so I
[40:21] just thought I'd share that uh by God's
[40:23] grace and we do it with all the love in
[40:24] my heart here uh by the grace of the
[40:26] Lord
[40:28] I just wrote down a 1 two 3 four five
[40:29] six just brief statements I want to look
[40:32] at okay uh well uh some of you might
[40:35] know too it's St Patrick's Day so I
[40:36] thought I'd read a little bit about St
[40:37] Patrick Hallelujah uh we don't celebrate
[40:40] it like the world of course his real
[40:43] name was s sakat and he's uh a saint
[40:46] from the pergami and church age and so
[40:49] he held on to Jesus's name and kept his
[40:51] faith he was robbed of his childhood I
[40:54] have this in my book here from
[40:55] 2021 uh he and his two sisters were
[40:58] kidnapped and sold as slaves Patrick was
[41:00] taken to Northern Ireland to herd swine
[41:03] and it was there God spoke to him he
[41:05] repented he got converted by the Holy
[41:08] Spirit through dreams and visions and
[41:10] hearing God's
[41:12] voice um Upon returning home to his
[41:15] mother in France of course remember he
[41:17] was taken from France to Ireland and
[41:18] then he came back he enrolled in his
[41:20] Uncle Martin's Bible school and Martin
[41:22] was the church age messenger talk about
[41:25] a wonderful family member to have amen
[41:27] the church age Messengers in my family
[41:30] Patrick could say that Hallelujah and
[41:32] that's the same Martin of Tours who was
[41:34] the star messenger for the church age so
[41:37] Patrick in the school he grew in Grace
[41:38] and Faith he shut in with God he studied
[41:41] the word of God had experiences
[41:42] Revelations with Christ and then he
[41:46] heard the voice uh say again go back to
[41:49] the ship and I got a I got a ship to you
[41:51] to go back to Ireland and so he followed
[41:53] the leadership of the Holy Spirit um he
[41:56] took the gospel to Ireland where he once
[41:57] worked as a slave and he and other
[42:00] ministers did just that and witnessed
[42:01] the Holy Ghost to do many miraculous
[42:03] acts one barbarian Chief witnessed so
[42:06] many miracles through Patrick's life
[42:07] that he and his entire household
[42:09] repented and received Christ and just as
[42:12] Jesus promis in Mark 16:18 there was a
[42:14] lot of serpents on in Ireland uh Patrick
[42:17] would take up the serpents he would get
[42:19] bit by the serpents and he would be
[42:20] healed just like Paul when Paul got bit
[42:23] by the Viper he laid his hands on the
[42:26] sick and they recovered by Jesus's Faith
[42:28] just as his uncle Martin did um he was
[42:32] once approached by an embassy from Rome
[42:34] so Babylon came to him to to visit Rome
[42:38] but he refused because he knew their
[42:40] wickedness and it was through the pure
[42:43] Gospel of Jesus Christ that St Patrick
[42:45] preached that nearly the entire Island
[42:47] received the
[42:49] gospel but then of course um you know uh
[42:52] many years later the Roman Catholic
[42:54] Church came back Jesuits came back in
[42:56] 1640
[42:57] and slaughtered lots of the Christians
[42:59] there uh but their genuine faith in
[43:03] jesus' name undoubtedly undoubtedly
[43:05] provided them a place in glory because
[43:07] of their martyrdoms that was all because
[43:09] God used St Patrick for that in that uh
[43:12] Pam paman Church age by God's grace so
[43:15] happy St Patrick's Day Hallelujah we
[43:18] don't pinch each other actually we
[43:19] should pinch ourselves and wake
[43:20] ourselves up amen the Rapture is coming
[43:23] Hallelujah the r God is whether In Our
[43:25] Lifetime or the next one of these
[43:26] Generations the rapt coming like brother
[43:28] man said Shake
[43:30] Yourself the world does a bunch of
[43:32] nonsense but uh we're Holy Ghost filled
[43:34] Saints Hallelujah so question one are
[43:37] the Thunders and seals the same thing
[43:38] yes or no so no not exactly they're not
[43:41] the same thing uh the seals uh were were
[43:45] were placed upon the scroll right and
[43:47] the seals had to be broken and when each
[43:49] seal was broken we got symbols right the
[43:52] Thunder is what the voice said about the
[43:56] symbols okay Thunder is a voice of God
[44:00] so a seal was something was a mystery a
[44:02] seal was a mystery upon the scroll the
[44:04] lamb broke the Seven Seals and each time
[44:08] he broke it a a a symbol went forth and
[44:11] the voice of God said what that symble
[44:13] meant so not exactly the same thing but
[44:15] very closely connected okay does
[44:18] everybody understand by God's grace it's
[44:19] a great question all right number two
[44:22] and maybe this won't go very long
[44:23] hopefully why is fear and uncertainty
[44:25] connected to the seven Thunders I said
[44:27] that uh oh because brother ran when he
[44:28] talked about it he said I'm I'm afraid
[44:30] of what's going to happen he had the
[44:32] vision of the Seven Angels visiting him
[44:35] uh in December 62 and he said I'm afraid
[44:37] I'm scared I don't know does this mean
[44:40] it's time of for the Rapture does this
[44:41] mean the pyramid's going to be capped
[44:42] off remember went over that on Wednesday
[44:44] night in other words he thought he
[44:45] thought it could be his death he thought
[44:47] that vision of seven angels visiting him
[44:49] might be his death so he was afraid but
[44:52] then he told the people uh he told the
[44:54] people don't be afraid cuz Jesus will
[44:55] work it out so the same servant he said
[44:57] said I'm afraid but then he said don't
[44:58] be
[44:59] afraid um and I guess there's fear and
[45:01] uncertainty because no man knows the day
[45:03] or the hour and nobody wants to miss the
[45:06] Rapture right and that's connected to
[45:08] one of the the later questions I'll just
[45:10] answer now it's normal for us to feel
[45:13] nervous right about the Rapture because
[45:15] there's part of us that doesn't want to
[45:16] miss it right there there's there's
[45:18] always a human element there's always
[45:20] questions there's always wondering like
[45:22] brother Ram said I can't prove to you my
[45:24] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life he
[45:25] said but by faith I believe it and
[45:28] that's why the Bible said make your
[45:29] calling an election sure that's why Paul
[45:32] said I beat under my body I bring it
[45:34] into subjection so I'm not a Castaway
[45:37] I'm the one that's preached it but I I
[45:38] don't want to be a cast away so I got to
[45:40] be extremely dedicated and disciplined
[45:42] to the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen okay
[45:45] so that's another great question there
[45:48] um and there's also uncertainty because
[45:49] you know some of some some of our
[45:52] faithful Saints you know some of our
[45:53] precious friends you know our our our
[45:56] Holy Ghost filled Saints
[45:57] they they're looking for seven Thunders
[45:59] to utter and we're not so that makes it
[46:02] just a little strange you know just a
[46:03] little there just differences amongst
[46:05] the bride members so there that's why
[46:08] there's always uncertainty right now as
[46:11] I said we're looking for the latter rain
[46:13] right which the Bible describes in Joel
[46:15] 223 through 26 will overflow with wine
[46:19] oil and wheat another words we'll have
[46:21] every spiritual blessing Revelation the
[46:23] Holy Ghost the word of God we'll have
[46:25] all that praise God now we enjoy what we
[46:27] have now but God said there's more and
[46:30] we all know we want more Hallelujah we
[46:32] want less of this world and we want more
[46:33] of God hallelujah this world never
[46:35] satisfies and never uh gives us any
[46:38] peace like that song says the only real
[46:40] peace I have in this world is you Jesus
[46:42] Hallelujah all the uncertainty so that's
[46:45] why there's an element of fear because
[46:47] we don't want to miss it and then
[46:49] there's also uncertainty well are we
[46:51] going to have to have a prophet rise up
[46:53] and uh give us a revelation on the
[46:55] Thunders
[46:58] uh or or not so there's uncertainty
[47:00] because we don't have thus say the Lord
[47:01] on either side all right great question
[47:05] number three what's the difference
[47:06] between Thunders and rapturing Faith
[47:09] well brother brandom said Thunders was
[47:11] the voice of God about the
[47:14] seals and brother baham said then that
[47:16] would cause rapturing Faith so the
[47:19] revelation of the seals would give us
[47:21] rapturing Faith so that's the difference
[47:25] okay the Thunders were God's voice
[47:27] telling us what the seals meant and then
[47:30] that Revelation turned our hearts back
[47:32] Hallelujah and as our hearts dra keep
[47:35] drawing closer to God I believe we'll
[47:37] receive rapturing Faith now there's
[47:39] another element as well the Bible says
[47:40] once you've got the Holy Ghost you're
[47:42] already glorified and brother Bram said
[47:43] that means the Rapture is already in you
[47:45] praise God hallelujah it's like all the
[47:48] saints who died Paul James Peter Brother
[47:50] brandham Martin Luther you know uh
[47:53] Patrick they've they they had the
[47:55] Rapture inside of them already
[47:56] Hallelujah they had a portion of that
[47:59] rapturing uh Faith already in them
[48:01] praise God but we're talking about the
[48:03] rapturing faith the latter of rain will
[48:04] be the rapturing faith for the living
[48:06] bride who does not have to taste
[48:08] death that's what that's what we're
[48:11] we're believing and every believer
[48:13] always did believe it brother Ram said I
[48:15] I've always believed I wouldn't be too
[48:17] old enough until the Rapture would hear
[48:19] and we'd see Jesus in other words he
[48:21] always believed he wouldn't goow to the
[48:22] grave but he went to the Grave so we see
[48:24] that every believer lives like they're
[48:26] going to see the rapure praise God but
[48:28] we don't want to get overtaken by fear
[48:30] and we don't want to get distracted
[48:32] right we don't want to get uh tempted by
[48:34] the cares of the world we also don't
[48:35] want to look for things that would just
[48:38] maybe seem religious but not exactly
[48:39] right we just want to be walking in
[48:41] spirit and in truth praise God because
[48:44] remember any false Doctrine will then uh
[48:48] multiply itself amongst the uh will will
[48:50] be leaven amongst the dough and if it's
[48:53] not repented of will produce some sin
[48:55] now we're going to see it amongst us
[48:56] others or ourselves or whatever we're
[48:58] going to see it in the lust of the eyes
[48:59] lust of the flesh pride of life right in
[49:02] message churches like ours now the one
[49:04] that's probably going to impact most of
[49:05] us if we're born again is pride of life
[49:08] right because the comforter will keep us
[49:10] from uh adulteries and and evil sins
[49:12] like that lust of the eyes now we I've
[49:16] heard preachers say the lust of the
[49:17] flesh battles them that's why they're
[49:19] overweight we've heard two preachers say
[49:21] that from this Pulpit okay so that
[49:24] that's another obvious one like pride of
[49:26] life and then lust of the flesh also the
[49:29] flesh might lust after all nice new
[49:30] clothes all the times so they overspend
[49:32] on fancy clothes or fancy jewelry or
[49:35] fancy glasses I don't know you know it's
[49:38] a lust of the
[49:40] Flesh and so that's how it will manifest
[49:42] now if we're really Holy Ghost filled
[49:44] Saints we should not have any major sins
[49:46] among us just
[49:47] minor and I was surprised I got lot I
[49:50] put those videos out last week and I had
[49:51] a lot of good support but I had a few uh
[49:54] people disagree with me on that I'm like
[49:55] well brother Bram said it and
[49:57] Bible says it and there's got to be some
[49:59] difference between the wise and foolish
[50:00] virgin there's got to be there's got to
[50:02] be a benefit to being born again
[50:03] Hallelujah there's got to be hallelujah
[50:06] or else why did why did Jesus s the hly
[50:08] why did Jesus say go wait for the Holy
[50:09] Ghost if there's no greater power to
[50:11] overcome sin Hallelujah that's right I'm
[50:14] just I'm just passionate so I'm not
[50:15] upset I'm just passionate so great
[50:18] question that's the difference between
[50:19] the Thunders and rapturing Faith
[50:21] Thunders tell us what the seals are and
[50:24] this revelation of that gives us
[50:26] rapturing Faith
[50:29] Hallelujah uh question number four do
[50:31] the books from brother brandham have
[50:34] some Revelation from the Bible yes or no
[50:36] yes they have a lot of Revelation I've
[50:37] said it before like maybe I don't know
[50:39] I'm just making a number in the 90s 99
[50:43] 98 95 I don't know you'd have to do some
[50:46] scientific
[50:48] studies because brother R has a human
[50:50] element right we we understand he has a
[50:52] human element my list is now at 90
[50:55] things I found where brother clearly
[50:57] either made a mistake or it was his own
[50:59] opinion and later it was wrong okay so
[51:02] like I I found one where brother Braham
[51:03] said uh uh Jesus saved my soul from
[51:06] burning eternally in Hell brother Ram
[51:08] said that okay brother Ram said women
[51:12] I'm just going to get into real Basics
[51:13] or real real plain brother Bram said
[51:15] women have sperm brother Bram said that
[51:17] 1965 or 64 the year before he
[51:20] passed and so these are just things he
[51:22] says right and and so we can see well
[51:24] not every word is thus say the Lord
[51:27] but then he'll give us thus sayeth the
[51:30] Lord and so we have a unique experience
[51:34] um never in the history of the world has
[51:36] a prophet's all of his personal thoughts
[51:38] and opinions been recorded on tape so we
[51:41] can enjoy it right the closest thing was
[51:44] the Jews when they uh did the uh what's
[51:47] it called I can't think of it now they
[51:50] had they had the uh Jesus talked about
[51:53] it in the the gospels they have their
[51:55] extra books
[51:57] and it's tradition what was it mishna
[51:58] there it is bless your heart there it is
[52:00] I'm not
[52:01] surprised not surprised I forgot either
[52:04] the mishna in other words in the days of
[52:06] Jesus the Pharisees had all their extra
[52:08] books outside of the Bible and this is
[52:10] what they thought Moses meant but they
[52:13] should have just did what Moses said see
[52:15] they had their own man-made ideas about
[52:18] the prophet's life and that's exactly
[52:20] what people do today they they make the
[52:22] mistake of making every word on tape of
[52:24] thus sayith the Lord okay get yourself
[52:27] into some really deep Waters uh of sin
[52:30] if you do that okay so great question uh
[52:33] very uh a very high percentage of the
[52:36] books and tapes from Brother brandom are
[52:38] from the Bible very high percentage we
[52:41] don't know the percentage but it's very
[52:42] much and that's why I said when I first
[52:44] listen to brother BR I cried like a baby
[52:45] I was a sinner or a
[52:47] denominational I wasn't a sinner I was a
[52:48] denominational person but I never heard
[52:50] a man preach the Bible like that and
[52:52] still of this day I've never heard a man
[52:53] preach like
[52:54] that God's prophet question number five
[52:57] were the seven Thunders uttered on Earth
[52:59] or in heaven since Heaven is quiet about
[53:02] it well according to the Bible um well
[53:04] we know there's thunderings going on
[53:06] from the Throne of God if you read the
[53:08] book of Revelation it says that many
[53:09] times and then there was a thunder in
[53:11] heaven when uh the one thunder on the
[53:13] first seal when Jesus broke the first
[53:15] seal in heaven so there's thunderings
[53:18] and one Thunder there in
[53:20] heaven but then when that revelation of
[53:22] the seals gets brought down to earth
[53:24] then it thundered on Earth
[53:27] so you have thunders both places you
[53:30] have thunders both places okay does that
[53:34] answer that yeah there there's
[53:36] thunderings often at the Throne of God
[53:39] there's the Thunder for the first seal
[53:40] in heaven in Revelation 61 and but then
[53:43] those seven Thunders regarding the Seven
[53:44] Seals happen on the earth Revelation 10
[53:49] 3 and 4 that was our
[53:50] text great
[53:53] questions uh question six so John knows
[53:57] the second fold of brother brandham but
[54:00] was forbidden to write it John that's a
[54:02] good
[54:03] question John that's a really good
[54:05] question I never thought about that um
[54:08] John heard what the seven Thunders
[54:10] uttered and he said write it not
[54:13] so um I think folds is the second fold I
[54:17] think what she's trying to or what the
[54:19] question is asking is about brother
[54:20] random had a vision of just the seventh
[54:22] seal and he said there's three folds to
[54:25] it John wasn't connected to that one so
[54:28] John wasn't connected to the seventh
[54:29] seal Vision John was only connected to
[54:31] the seven Thunders
[54:34] Vision okay so that's a great question
[54:37] that's a fantastic question U so John
[54:41] knows the second fold I don't I don't
[54:42] know if John knows the second fold of
[54:44] brother Brandon's Vision I don't know
[54:46] brother BR said one was in unknown
[54:48] language the other one he said went by
[54:49] so fast he couldn't make it out so I I
[54:52] don't think John knows brother brandom's
[54:53] seventh seal Vision but John did hear
[54:56] the seven Thunders
[54:58] utter okay John knew that but he said
[55:01] don't write it so think about that the
[55:03] revelation of the seven Thunders could
[55:04] be written down amen and brother BR
[55:07] preached it for us and then it was
[55:08] written down I believe that's my
[55:10] conviction I believe it was written down
[55:11] in that seven seal book out there if you
[55:12] want a free copy they're yours to take
[55:15] Hallelujah great excellent questions
[55:17] there wow six seven are the apostolic
[55:20] fathers the fathers of Faith yes that's
[55:24] my answer yes does that include God uh
[55:28] no it doesn't necessarily include God it
[55:31] in it includes the fathers of the faith
[55:33] in other words the writers of the
[55:35] Bible now for us it's the apostles it's
[55:38] the Apostles of Christ Jesus so now
[55:40] let's prove that of course uh okay
[55:42] that's Malachi 45 and 6 let's go Malachi
[55:44] 45
[55:46] and6 and then we'll go to Luke 11:7 uh
[55:49] case you want to pull that up Malachi 45
[55:51] and
[55:54] 6 and this is one of the main scriptures
[55:56] people that leave the message attack uh
[55:59] but they're actually denying Luke 1:17
[56:01] they're actually denying what the Bible
[56:03] says behold I'll send you Elijah the
[56:05] prophet before the coming of the great
[56:06] and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall
[56:08] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[56:09] children now just stop right there this
[56:11] right here is John the
[56:12] Baptist now look it says he's going to
[56:15] send John the Baptist before the great
[56:16] and terrible day of the
[56:18] Lord that's been over 2,000 years in
[56:20] advance right so God was saying there's
[56:23] going to be the spirit of Elijah come
[56:26] and it's got a two-part Ministry before
[56:29] I pour out uh before I just send fire
[56:33] after Armageddon right the great and
[56:35] Dreadful day of the Lord the day of the
[56:36] Lord is Armageddon so 2,000 years in
[56:39] advance God said I'm sending you John
[56:40] the Baptist before because he's dealing
[56:43] with Daniel 70 weeks weeks right he's
[56:45] dealing with those 483 years that Israel
[56:47] has left and then God's going to cleanse
[56:49] it all Jesus going to cleanse it all and
[56:51] he's going to be the anointed one in the
[56:52] temple of Jerusalem hallelujah amen but
[56:55] remember he's going to after after that
[56:57] after those 69 weeks he's going to take
[56:58] a break and he's going to reveal himself
[57:00] to the Gentile church amen he's going to
[57:01] get himself a bride he's going to graft
[57:03] that wild Branch into it amen aren't you
[57:05] glad you a bunch of wild branches have
[57:07] been grafted into the holy Vine
[57:09] Hallelujah and now I'm not wild anymore
[57:11] amen now the Holy Ghost can control me
[57:13] hallelujah
[57:16] amen so see he does Elijah does two
[57:19] things he turns the heart of the fathers
[57:21] to the children
[57:22] now that's what John the Baptist did
[57:25] John Baptist turns the heart of the
[57:27] fathers to the children and so the only
[57:30] way that makes sense is John the Baptist
[57:32] was one of the uh one of the uh
[57:35] Apostolic leaders of that time of course
[57:36] in the New Testament because God started
[57:39] the New Testament there with John he
[57:40] finished it with John right and he
[57:42] pointed all the people to Christ he said
[57:45] I'm just a voice of the Wilderness he
[57:46] said follow Christ amen so John pointed
[57:49] everybody the fathers uh to Christ and
[57:52] then all their desires all of the
[57:55] desires of Paul Peter and James and John
[57:57] and Matthew Bartholomew all the apostles
[58:00] all their desire was to the coming of
[58:02] the Lord the people that would live at
[58:05] the coming of the Lord that's the only
[58:07] way this makes sense how could John turn
[58:09] the hearts of the fathers to the
[58:11] children because John pointed everybody
[58:12] to Christ right there's the Christ and
[58:15] then their heart was then to see the
[58:17] coming of the Lord and that's why Paul
[58:19] and Peter always right about the coming
[58:20] of the lord they're always like the
[58:22] coming of the Lord is at hand and John
[58:23] says the same thing the coming of the
[58:24] Lord is at hand be ready there's already
[58:26] many Antichrist but you'll know the
[58:28] Antichrist he said uh by The Works of
[58:30] the Antichrist but you'll know Christ
[58:31] because we've got the anointing of
[58:33] Christ all right now uh now brother BR
[58:36] fulfilled this and the Heart of the
[58:37] children to their fathers so John the
[58:40] Baptist pointed all the apostles there
[58:43] his his Spirit of Elijah appointed them
[58:45] to Christ so all the all Paul all the
[58:48] apostles had a heart for the children
[58:50] but now at the end time Elijah has to
[58:52] come but he came through brother Ram's
[58:54] Ministry and he's got to point point all
[58:55] the children the people that are here at
[58:56] the coming of Christ back to the
[58:59] fathers now most denominational churches
[59:02] maybe amen's heard this maybe bang most
[59:05] most denominational churches I've had
[59:07] friends I've had friends use this verse
[59:09] in a Bible study I've sat in because I
[59:11] teach Bible club and they use this to
[59:13] say it's just with natural Fathers and
[59:16] Sons like like Malachi and I like and
[59:19] and and they're actually preaching you
[59:20] know the spirit of Elijah is on me so
[59:22] I'll have a heart for Malachi and
[59:24] Malachi will have a heart for me
[59:27] right I've literally sat in Bible
[59:29] studies and they can't see that this
[59:31] they don't even mention John the Baptist
[59:33] if they can't see half of it how they
[59:34] going to see brother random
[59:36] amen but the Bible interprets this for
[59:39] us uh Luke
[59:41] 1:17 this is excellent question great
[59:43] about the apostolic fathers and this is
[59:46] in my book as well I WR wrote a whole
[59:48] thing about this in the
[59:50] book and he shall go before him in the
[59:53] spirit and power lies to turn the hearts
[59:54] of the fathers to the children so John
[59:58] pointed he was the first one to point
[59:59] everybody to Christ and then all those
[1:00:01] that received him they had a heart for
[1:00:02] the children the heart for the the
[1:00:04] people that would be alive at the coming
[1:00:06] of the Lord the second coming of
[1:00:08] Christ right and the disobedient to the
[1:00:11] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[1:00:13] people prepared for the Lord now God
[1:00:15] used brother Simon was it last week to
[1:00:17] do a wonderful job of showing us how
[1:00:19] there's numerous Witnesses in the
[1:00:21] gospels that say uh John the Baptist Was
[1:00:24] Elijah but he wasn't that Elijah
[1:00:27] he fulfilled the first part of Malachi
[1:00:30] 45 and 6 but not the second part there
[1:00:33] had to be another Elijah come to turn
[1:00:35] the hearts of us the children back to
[1:00:37] the apostolic fathers so that's a great
[1:00:40] question let me make sure I got does
[1:00:41] that include God no God is not one of
[1:00:44] those fathers or children but God is the
[1:00:46] father of all those fathers and children
[1:00:49] Hallelujah so that's a great question
[1:00:51] does that help hopefully helps by God's
[1:00:53] grace and last question then we'll get
[1:00:55] just to we'll review some quotes here is
[1:00:58] it okay to be a little nervous for the
[1:01:00] Rapture
[1:01:01] yes and then remember uh yes we have to
[1:01:04] we have to remember to keep love in our
[1:01:05] hearts because as I said he'll appear to
[1:01:08] all those that love is
[1:01:10] appearing so we got to have love right
[1:01:12] we got to have the love we got to love
[1:01:14] that he's coming right uh now it will
[1:01:18] cause some seriousness night right we'll
[1:01:20] shake ourselves and say I want to be
[1:01:21] ready oh God help me to stop playing
[1:01:23] games and help me to get my first love
[1:01:24] back and anything like if you're you're
[1:01:26] in that position it's going to help you
[1:01:27] do that by God's grace but yes and then
[1:01:30] remember brother R says there always has
[1:01:32] to be tension in our lives there's
[1:01:34] always got to be problems or issues if
[1:01:35] not you said you'd be a jellyfish with
[1:01:37] no backbone you just drifted along in
[1:01:40] life and this is okay and this is okay
[1:01:42] and that's okay but what if it's your
[1:01:44] sin that's not okay the Holy Ghost will
[1:01:46] never lead you to sin right it'll try to
[1:01:49] keep you from it right but when you
[1:01:51] grieve the Holy Ghost the Bible said
[1:01:52] confess your sin and then he'll cleanse
[1:01:54] you of all unrighteousness amen amen all
[1:01:57] right uh great questions those are
[1:01:59] wonderful wonderful questions there by
[1:02:01] God's
[1:02:02] grace okay now
[1:02:05] um now I want to go through um nine I
[1:02:09] think it's nine reasons I got the I I
[1:02:12] believe the Thunders were already
[1:02:13] uttered
[1:02:15] here so let me uh you can uh switch over
[1:02:18] now hun and I recorded a video on it
[1:02:20] yesterday I'll probably put it out
[1:02:22] tomorrow um I might have to add a few
[1:02:24] things here
[1:02:26] and I know this is small I'm very sorry
[1:02:27] this is small so I'm very sorry I forgot
[1:02:30] to make this
[1:02:32] bigger um but right now I have nine nine
[1:02:34] or 10 reasons one of them I might take
[1:02:36] off the video because I'm thinking about
[1:02:37] it meditating on it this morning but
[1:02:39] anyways the first reason I believe the
[1:02:41] Thunders were already uttered is brother
[1:02:43] brandham said uh seven times they were
[1:02:46] already fulfilled or revealed or already
[1:02:49] history seven
[1:02:51] times now I know there's more than 10
[1:02:54] times brother brandom said they're going
[1:02:55] to going to be revealed to give us
[1:02:56] rapturing faith I know that so there's
[1:02:59] actually more quotes saying they're
[1:03:01] going to be revealed in the future we'll
[1:03:02] have rapturing faith but the point of
[1:03:04] those seven is that thereafter he
[1:03:06] preached the Seven Seals or the seven
[1:03:10] seal okay so it's it's almost as if he
[1:03:12] grew in his Revelation and that's my
[1:03:15] that's that's my understanding during
[1:03:17] the church I'm sorry when brother man
[1:03:18] was preaching the Seven Seals he still
[1:03:20] thought the Thunders were going to be
[1:03:21] future but after he preached them I
[1:03:23] believe it was revealed to him that he
[1:03:26] realized oh the Thunder already uttered
[1:03:28] because they were the revelations
[1:03:29] contained in the Seven Seals and so he
[1:03:31] never afterwards he never ever talked
[1:03:33] about us having to uh get the revelation
[1:03:36] of rapturing Faith with the seven
[1:03:39] Thunders okay all right so that's the
[1:03:41] first reason uh there's seven quotes
[1:03:44] where brother Ram says after he preached
[1:03:45] the seventh seal there's seven quotes
[1:03:47] saying they were Thunders were already
[1:03:49] revealed their history they're fulfilled
[1:03:51] they're opened he said that open is
[1:03:53] another word I could have put that one
[1:03:54] on there number two brother R never
[1:03:56] mentioned the seventh seal Vision with
[1:03:58] the threefolds after preaching the
[1:04:01] seventh seal sermon and again makes me
[1:04:04] think uh it was already fulfilled his
[1:04:06] vision was already fulfilled and he knew
[1:04:08] the Thunders were the revelations of the
[1:04:10] Seven Seals now that's just my my humble
[1:04:14] opinion in other words if this Vision
[1:04:16] about the seven seal was so important
[1:04:18] why wouldn't brother R and and we had to
[1:04:20] get the Revelation for the Rapture why
[1:04:22] in almost two years did Brother Ram
[1:04:24] never ever even mention that Vision one
[1:04:26] more time it's not mentioned one more
[1:04:28] time but then afterwards seven times he
[1:04:31] said that they're open they're fulfilled
[1:04:32] they're history it just doesn't it
[1:04:35] doesn't make any sense that this Vision
[1:04:37] was so important and then he's not even
[1:04:40] here now he's gone off the scene he's
[1:04:41] not even here to get the interpretation
[1:04:44] of that Vision if the vision is not
[1:04:47] fulfilled
[1:04:48] right and then who is that who's going
[1:04:51] to be that Prophet that we all know amen
[1:04:53] and sister Naomi Jose bang well all know
[1:04:56] that man's a prophet and he'll give us
[1:04:57] thus sayth the Lord on the seven
[1:04:58] Thunders and that will give us rapturing
[1:05:00] Faith who is that man I like to meet him
[1:05:02] I'd like to get to know him pretty good
[1:05:03] that gu's good because if he's anything
[1:05:05] like brother brandom he might lie to the
[1:05:08] IRS he might disobey uh the angel the
[1:05:11] Lord like down in South Africa and and
[1:05:14] take the denominational agenda itinerary
[1:05:16] rather than God's itinerary and he might
[1:05:18] get amibas for six months and almost die
[1:05:21] in other words he's going to be
[1:05:23] human right he's going to be human and
[1:05:25] we're going to have to look past his
[1:05:26] faults and see his prophetic gift just
[1:05:29] like every Prophet Moses Abraham they
[1:05:31] all had faults none of them were perfect
[1:05:33] oh but there was one perfect that was
[1:05:34] Christ
[1:05:36] Hallelujah manam said he's the unveiling
[1:05:38] of God hallelujah he said all the
[1:05:40] prophets were apart he said but when we
[1:05:42] saw Jesus that was God unveiled
[1:05:45] Hallelujah number three the third reason
[1:05:48] when they asked brother Ram directly
[1:05:50] about the seven Thunders he said they
[1:05:52] were already
[1:05:54] fulfilled his home Church asked him over
[1:05:57] 300 it might have been almost 400
[1:05:58] questions in the questions and answers
[1:06:00] series uh from August 1964 and of all
[1:06:04] those questions he got asked one time
[1:06:05] about the Thunders I wish I could talk
[1:06:07] to those people why didn't more of you
[1:06:09] ask about the seven Thunders maybe they
[1:06:11] did they just only gave them that one
[1:06:13] question I don't know I just say that as
[1:06:16] a
[1:06:17] joke but he said they were already
[1:06:20] revealed and then he quotes Revelation
[1:06:21] 10:7 the mysteries of God are finished
[1:06:23] which we'll show in just a moment so if
[1:06:26] somebody asked you directly about it
[1:06:28] wouldn't you saywell I'm waiting on the
[1:06:29] the two other folds of the vision to be
[1:06:31] fulfilled wouldn't you say that if
[1:06:33] you're a prophet and you've got a vision
[1:06:34] that's not fulfilled wouldn't you
[1:06:36] remember wouldn't the Holy Ghost Quicken
[1:06:37] that to you I would think so so that
[1:06:40] makes me think even more he realized
[1:06:42] they were already spoken in the Seven
[1:06:44] Seals okay that's my humble thought
[1:06:47] number four brother random put in print
[1:06:49] he put it in print in December of 1965
[1:06:52] that the Thunders were the revelations
[1:06:54] contained in the seven seals he read it
[1:06:56] over a couple times and his daughter
[1:06:59] Rebecca confirmed she said she read it
[1:07:00] five times brother Brandon while they
[1:07:01] would drive around so brother brandom
[1:07:03] knew it seems he knew very well what was
[1:07:05] in the church age book and he allowed it
[1:07:07] to go into print that the Thunders were
[1:07:10] the revelations contain the Seven Seals
[1:07:13] and that would literally turn your
[1:07:14] hearts back to those Apostolic fathers
[1:07:18] amen so number five if the Thunders
[1:07:20] aren't revealed then our hearts are not
[1:07:23] turned back to the apostolic fathers
[1:07:26] right if your heart isn't turned to the
[1:07:28] fathers Peter Paul James John and so
[1:07:30] forth then who is your heart turned
[1:07:33] to my heart's turned to the word of God
[1:07:36] in all my questions I search brother
[1:07:37] Ram's quotes and I ultimately go back to
[1:07:39] the Bible the Bible is my last word the
[1:07:41] Bible's my
[1:07:42] absolute okay and it seems like from the
[1:07:44] Bible you can only have two conditions
[1:07:45] either you have a Heart of Stone or a
[1:07:47] new heart a heart of Flesh so if I've
[1:07:50] got a heart of Flesh if I Repent of my
[1:07:51] sins have been baptized then I got a
[1:07:53] heart of Flesh and my heart is turned to
[1:07:55] the apostolic fathers because that's the
[1:07:57] age we're living in I don't know about
[1:07:59] foolish virgins but uh I don't know who
[1:08:02] their heart could be turned to they got
[1:08:03] a they got a new heart but is it it's
[1:08:05] not turned to the apostolic fathers is
[1:08:07] it right they're not really trying to
[1:08:10] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:11] Christ are they like the apostles
[1:08:13] they'll still sprinkle they'll still
[1:08:14] sprinkle babies and sprinkle adults
[1:08:17] Presbyterian churches even you know
[1:08:19] their hearts aren't really turned back
[1:08:21] to the apostolic fathers but they got
[1:08:22] new Hearts if they're saved all right
[1:08:25] number I'm going to try to speed up
[1:08:27] here now this is the one I might remove
[1:08:29] um because I don't know it's just as I
[1:08:31] think about it it's just maybe hard for
[1:08:33] me to understand in Revelation 61 it
[1:08:35] says a thunder sounded at the first seal
[1:08:37] when the lamb broke the seal a thunder
[1:08:40] sounded now to me that proves each seal
[1:08:43] had a thunder or else there are eight
[1:08:45] Thunders so this is what I'm I believe
[1:08:47] might be a mistake of the movement
[1:08:49] that's looking for the seven
[1:08:52] Thunders okay because they they're
[1:08:54] looking for seven but the Bible said
[1:08:56] there was a eight there was an eight
[1:08:57] thunder in in in the first
[1:09:00] seal right so are you looking for seven
[1:09:02] or
[1:09:03] eight right because there's seven but if
[1:09:06] if if the seals aren't open if the
[1:09:09] Thunders haven't uttered their voices if
[1:09:10] we don't know the Thunders well there
[1:09:11] was a thunder in the first seal so what
[1:09:13] it say you don't know
[1:09:15] it because it's a voice of God it's
[1:09:17] still mystery I might leave it up there
[1:09:19] now okay I I said it a little better
[1:09:20] there by God's grace thank you Lord amen
[1:09:23] so but I we got to do a new a new
[1:09:24] recording I hope this is recording
[1:09:26] because I'm not recording on my phone
[1:09:28] help us Lord help YouTube to have their
[1:09:29] servers not break down okay number
[1:09:32] seven again there's still no thus sayith
[1:09:35] the Lords on a future opening or
[1:09:38] revelation of the seven seven Thunders
[1:09:40] um but there is a vision right there is
[1:09:42] a vision about it but again he never
[1:09:45] mentioned that Vision after the seals
[1:09:47] and I'm open to correction if he did ly
[1:09:49] someone let me know this morning I
[1:09:51] searched fold uh Seven Seals seven seven
[1:09:53] Thunders I never found it after the
[1:09:55] seventh seal and I went and looked
[1:09:57] directly in the Rapture sermon December
[1:10:00] 4th
[1:10:01] 1965 3 weeks before he went off the
[1:10:04] scene he only said the word Thunder one
[1:10:06] time and it wasn't even revealed to the
[1:10:07] seven Thunders but in that sermon he
[1:10:09] said at least five times the Seven Seals
[1:10:11] are revealed God's finished he said all
[1:10:13] the mysteries of God are finished amen
[1:10:15] am you would think in any sermon where
[1:10:17] he's going to bring out this this Vision
[1:10:20] where we got to get this revelation of
[1:10:21] the Thunders for the Rapture so we can
[1:10:23] have rapturing faith you would think
[1:10:25] that he would put this Vision in that
[1:10:27] sermon but he never did now I know he
[1:10:29] was under pressure remember the uh the
[1:10:31] host of that in the hotel they were
[1:10:32] trying to get him to close the service
[1:10:34] but he just kept preaching anyway as
[1:10:36] long as he could until he probably
[1:10:37] didn't hurt their
[1:10:38] feelings but again there's there's no
[1:10:40] mention of
[1:10:41] that um that that vision and there's no
[1:10:45] thus sayith the Lord on it we don't have
[1:10:46] a thus sayith the Lord now thus sayth
[1:10:49] the Lords are important because it's God
[1:10:51] brother Braham said he said I have my
[1:10:52] opinions but he said you'll know it's
[1:10:54] God when he says thus sayith the Lord
[1:10:56] Lord okay so we have no thus sayith the
[1:10:58] Lord like how are those seven Thunders
[1:11:00] going to be revealed who which continent
[1:11:02] are they going to be revealed on first
[1:11:04] who's the first church to get the
[1:11:05] revelation of the seven Thunders we we
[1:11:08] have we have nothing to go on it right
[1:11:11] it's just what we have on that one
[1:11:13] sermon uh the seven seal sermon March
[1:11:16] 1963 okay number eight if the seven
[1:11:19] Thunders are still
[1:11:20] Mysteries then the mysteries of
[1:11:22] Revelation 10:7 are not fulfilled
[1:11:27] okay which and then there's lots of
[1:11:28] quotes that are wrong then that say all
[1:11:30] the mysteries of God are finished and
[1:11:32] then Revelation 107 isn't history like
[1:11:34] brother Bram said and what is the
[1:11:35] attraction on the
[1:11:36] mountain and that opens us up to all
[1:11:39] these strange things do we still need a
[1:11:41] seventh angel messenger then brother
[1:11:44] can't or is he going to come back and
[1:11:45] he's going to be the seventh angel
[1:11:47] messenger
[1:11:48] again see so it just opens up this whole
[1:11:51] what do they call a Pandora's Box what
[1:11:53] they call it I mean all these questions
[1:11:55] oh my goodness who's going to be this
[1:11:56] Prophet who's going to be the seventh
[1:11:57] age brother Ram wasn't the prophet to
[1:11:59] the age now did you know there's a quote
[1:12:00] brother Ram said brother Ram said
[1:12:03] somebody in his church hung this up and
[1:12:04] he said uh I forget the name of the
[1:12:06] brother he said the brother put my name
[1:12:08] by that Elijah he said he said I don't
[1:12:10] believe I have anything to do with that
[1:12:11] man did you know there's a quote that
[1:12:13] says that in the church ages brother
[1:12:15] said I don't believe I have anything to
[1:12:17] do with that now how can that be thus
[1:12:18] sayith the Lord dear precious friends
[1:12:21] that worship the tapes how he said I
[1:12:24] don't think I have one thing to do with
[1:12:25] that man that seventh Church age
[1:12:29] messenger that's called
[1:12:32] humility that's called a humble servant
[1:12:34] of
[1:12:35] God and that's and that's what all the
[1:12:37] all the people around brother Ram that's
[1:12:39] what they say brother Ram said I just
[1:12:40] didn't want to come out and put myself
[1:12:42] in there I wanted God to reveal to the
[1:12:44] people that I was a prophet that's what
[1:12:46] Perry green
[1:12:47] says he said I wanted God to show them
[1:12:51] that my Ministry in the scriptures he
[1:12:53] said all I can do is point to the
[1:12:54] scriptures I never wanted to magnify
[1:12:55] myself now that's the one thing that's
[1:12:57] different when the angel Lord was there
[1:12:59] he said Do you believe me to be God's
[1:13:01] Prophet right and then the angel or
[1:13:03] leave and he's like I never called
[1:13:04] myself a
[1:13:07] prophet is that true I mean I I've he
[1:13:10] said I never call myself a prophet and
[1:13:13] yet he says do you believe me to be
[1:13:15] God's
[1:13:16] Prophet because it's different when
[1:13:18] God's
[1:13:19] there it's different you're not your
[1:13:21] regular self and your own human thoughts
[1:13:23] now there's a holy anointing there
[1:13:25] things are different right now right he
[1:13:28] wasn't lying he wasn't telling the truth
[1:13:30] I'm sorry he wasn't lying he wasn't uh
[1:13:32] misrepresenting the truth he was telling
[1:13:33] the truth but it just shows the presence
[1:13:36] of the angel of God is different than
[1:13:38] just being without the presence of the
[1:13:40] angel of God right we all know
[1:13:44] that now uh my ninth reason is the order
[1:13:48] of Revelation 10 seems to fit what has
[1:13:50] actually happened in reality since
[1:13:53] 1965 so the order seems to be Christ
[1:13:55] comes down in that cloud in Arizona in
[1:13:59] February 28th we just passed it Jose
[1:14:01] sent me the anniversary Hallelujah happy
[1:14:03] anniversary to the Lord coming down
[1:14:06] Hallelujah and then the Thunders utter
[1:14:09] their voices other words in other words
[1:14:11] God gave the Revelation to brother
[1:14:12] brandom about the the Seven Seals
[1:14:15] brother Bram preached the Seven Seals
[1:14:16] marriage and divorce anointed on at the
[1:14:17] end times all these Revelations the
[1:14:19] mystery of God is finished brother R
[1:14:21] goes off the scene and now John the
[1:14:22] bride's got to eat the book and take it
[1:14:24] to Every Nation
[1:14:26] right and there's still there's still
[1:14:27] Apostles doing it right now Simon is he
[1:14:29] said I believe we still have one we we
[1:14:31] have one message believer right now in
[1:14:33] Thailand
[1:14:34] one
[1:14:36] one uh brother uh Jason dears is trying
[1:14:39] to do work there in Egypt right trying
[1:14:41] to get more believers they got a real
[1:14:42] small group they just meet in a hotel
[1:14:43] room they're trying to find Believers
[1:14:46] they're still doing missionary work
[1:14:47] brother Maxwell Lee last time I talked
[1:14:48] to me he went down he uh boated on this
[1:14:51] tiny little boat he went down the uh the
[1:14:53] N River down there in South South Africa
[1:14:55] down into Brazil to try to win souls for
[1:14:57] Jesus Christ I'm sorry not Nile Amazon
[1:14:59] sorry there I go I was thinking of Egypt
[1:15:01] you
[1:15:02] know South America what did I
[1:15:05] say South Africa I'm
[1:15:09] sorry forgive me I'm glad I got some
[1:15:12] help out there by God's grace that's I
[1:15:14] need God's help so brother Maxwell Lee
[1:15:16] is going down the Amazon river in South
[1:15:19] America there we go South
[1:15:22] America I appreciate my wife helping me
[1:15:24] on that thank you h I don't want to say
[1:15:25] the wrong
[1:15:26] thing Hallelujah so we you know we are
[1:15:29] in you know I I believe history has
[1:15:32] proven Revelation 10 the order is
[1:15:36] chronological because the now think
[1:15:39] think of the other side think of the
[1:15:40] other side if if the Thunders H are not
[1:15:43] revealed yet this prophet's got to Rise
[1:15:45] Up from Among
[1:15:47] Us give thus sayth the Lord and then we
[1:15:50] got to quickly spread it to the
[1:15:52] Nations Every Nation Jesus said this
[1:15:56] gospel must be preached to Every Nation
[1:15:57] then the end comes that means we got a
[1:15:59] lot longer here which it might be it
[1:16:02] might be I'm trying to be neutral but I
[1:16:04] I just have this conviction I feel like
[1:16:05] this has already been happening these
[1:16:07] last 59 years since brother R went off
[1:16:09] the scene as far as John eating the book
[1:16:12] uh uh missionaries today apostles today
[1:16:14] taking this message to Every
[1:16:16] Nation all
[1:16:19] right all right okay now let me uh get
[1:16:22] out of that
[1:16:23] one oh yeah so then my 10th one would
[1:16:25] just be uh if I had a 10th one I don't
[1:16:27] know if I kind of mentioned this earlier
[1:16:30] um in the in the Rapture sermon from
[1:16:32] December 4th 65 brother Ram never
[1:16:34] mentioned the seven Thunders that might
[1:16:36] be a 10th one like if you're ever going
[1:16:38] to share something there you know that
[1:16:41] would have been a great time to share it
[1:16:43] right because for the Rapture apparently
[1:16:45] you know he once believed we got to have
[1:16:47] this re revelation of the seven Thunders
[1:16:49] that will give us rapturing faith and
[1:16:50] then the Rapture can
[1:16:52] happen Okay but you know I believe the
[1:16:54] truth is very close to that we got to
[1:16:56] get the latter rain because that's what
[1:16:57] Joel 2 says that's what James 5 says
[1:17:01] James 5 says God is very patient for the
[1:17:03] former and latter rain to pour out we
[1:17:06] get
[1:17:07] impatient but God is very patient
[1:17:09] Hallelujah he sees the beginning from
[1:17:11] the end all right so if I had 10 that's
[1:17:13] what I would have 10
[1:17:15] reasons okay uh now let me go through
[1:17:18] these quickly here oh yeah let's start
[1:17:20] with after the seals
[1:17:23] okay
[1:17:25] you know I felt pretty good until I made
[1:17:26] that goof up on South Africa and South
[1:17:28] America
[1:17:29] man I felt pretty good what's
[1:17:32] that yeah you're right brother South
[1:17:38] [Laughter]
[1:17:42] a I like that brother thank you now I
[1:17:45] put red stars by the seven quotes where
[1:17:49] brother Ram says the Thunder already
[1:17:51] fulfilled revealed opened or
[1:17:53] history
[1:17:55] I love you brother Jose thanks for
[1:17:57] having compassion on me buddy all of you
[1:18:00] too all of you have compassion on me now
[1:18:02] 19 days after he said the Thunders got
[1:18:05] to be spoken and then we'll get the
[1:18:07] Revelation 19 days after he said the
[1:18:09] seven Thunders happened the other
[1:18:12] day something happened the other day you
[1:18:14] read or heard on tape the seven Thunders
[1:18:16] what time is it sir see it happened the
[1:18:18] other day so the seven Thunders
[1:18:23] happened all right
[1:18:25] uh now this was earlier in the morning
[1:18:26] yeah this was a this was the evening
[1:18:28] service God hiding himself the morning
[1:18:29] service was world falling apart so in
[1:18:32] the morning and I got these out of order
[1:18:34] sorry the Seven Seals were opened at the
[1:18:37] Tabernacle the other day so I'm
[1:18:40] including that because he says they're
[1:18:42] open right and if the Seven Seals are
[1:18:45] open then that's the rapturing faith of
[1:18:47] the seven Thunders the
[1:18:50] revelations are what the voices
[1:18:53] said Hallelujah hope that's not too
[1:18:56] confusing right because the the the
[1:18:59] voices of God's voice God's seven voices
[1:19:02] or seven Thunders are the revelations of
[1:19:04] those Seven Seals and brother Ram said
[1:19:05] the Seven Seals are open and then the
[1:19:07] next day I'm sorry then that
[1:19:09] night he says it happened the seals are
[1:19:13] revealed and it the seven Thunders
[1:19:14] happened already that's pretty clear to
[1:19:18] me now here's one um here here again now
[1:19:21] here he's he's making it sound like
[1:19:23] Revelation 10:7 is in the future so see
[1:19:25] this is I'm just being neutral this is a
[1:19:27] quote on the other
[1:19:29] side now to me it's brother man being
[1:19:31] humble because he's in his home
[1:19:33] Church okay so brother man says and at
[1:19:35] the sounding of the seventh Angel's
[1:19:36] message all the mysteries of a God would
[1:19:38] be made known then come the seven
[1:19:41] mysterious Thunders okay so this one is
[1:19:44] more on the other side right but again
[1:19:47] remember I got seven that say thunder
[1:19:49] already fulfilled
[1:19:50] revealed
[1:19:52] okay so this was what three months after
[1:19:54] after he preached the Seven Seals okay
[1:19:56] so that one and then he doesn't say
[1:19:58] anything else the rest of the sermon he
[1:19:59] doesn't say anything else about this
[1:20:01] remember this was the sermon where he
[1:20:02] had to realize um I got a complex
[1:20:05] against the people he said I want to
[1:20:07] move up in Colorado get away from
[1:20:08] everybody and I just want to stomp down
[1:20:10] like an Old Testament prophet and say
[1:20:12] thus say the Lord and then leave him
[1:20:13] because they kept getting more paint
[1:20:15] more makeup uh more dirty jokes more men
[1:20:17] smoking cigarettes and he lost the
[1:20:20] feeling for the people but the angel
[1:20:21] said if you do that your wife will leave
[1:20:23] you he said I thought I was a prophet
[1:20:25] and the angel said you're an Apostolic
[1:20:26] Prophet many
[1:20:28] gifts right and that goes against these
[1:20:30] preachers today that or these internet
[1:20:32] prophets say that say I'm a prophet I
[1:20:34] don't have to go to church how do I know
[1:20:35] because I just emailed one and then he
[1:20:37] rebuked me on the on the video I said
[1:20:39] well you don't match the word of God
[1:20:41] every prophet in the New Testament
[1:20:42] stayed with the churches went to
[1:20:44] church why because there's
[1:20:46] accountability in church there's no
[1:20:48] accountability sitting at home you don't
[1:20:51] answer to anybody but I got to answer to
[1:20:52] you you got to answer to me and the
[1:20:54] Bible said they went out from us because
[1:20:56] they were not of us hallelujah so
[1:20:59] somebody's got to be gathered with the
[1:21:00] Holy Ghost Saints Hallelujah I'm glad
[1:21:02] I'm one of them amen and time will prove
[1:21:05] what kind of character you are
[1:21:07] Hallelujah amongst the people of God
[1:21:09] remember Church we're all like iron
[1:21:11] we're all sharpening one
[1:21:13] another right so all your good stuff is
[1:21:16] sharpening me all my good stuff is
[1:21:18] sharpening you now don't look at my bad
[1:21:19] stuff I I won't look at your bad stuff
[1:21:22] right we got to let all of our good
[1:21:23] attributes sharpen one another when we
[1:21:25] come
[1:21:26] together look past our faults Bible said
[1:21:28] if you see somebody overtaken go to them
[1:21:30] with the spirit of humility unless you
[1:21:32] get or else you'll get tempted by what
[1:21:33] they're
[1:21:34] battling
[1:21:35] okay so see that one is I'm just trying
[1:21:38] to I'm trying to give you all of them so
[1:21:39] you can see what a preacher has has to
[1:21:41] kind of pray about right rightly divide
[1:21:43] the word of God Christ The Mystery of
[1:21:45] God revealed now here's what I mentioned
[1:21:46] earlier some people think these are the
[1:21:48] other two folds of that seven seal
[1:21:52] Vision right the first fold was the
[1:21:55] seven
[1:21:56] Thunders and we don't know the last two
[1:21:59] okay but here remember I told you on
[1:22:00] Wednesday some people believe the
[1:22:02] threefolds were Thunders how and when
[1:22:05] Jesus will come now this is not very
[1:22:07] popular I'm just I just want to show it
[1:22:08] to you because it's another seven
[1:22:10] Thunders quote okay and that's the
[1:22:12] reason there was silence in heaven for a
[1:22:14] space of a half hour the seven Thunders
[1:22:15] utter their voices and John was even
[1:22:17] forbidden to write it see the coming of
[1:22:20] the Lord that's one thing he hasn't
[1:22:21] revealed yet of how he will come and
[1:22:24] when he will come it's a good thing that
[1:22:27] he
[1:22:29] doesn't okay yeah so I just want to show
[1:22:31] that to you as a followup remember I I I
[1:22:33] shared with you uh there's there's at
[1:22:36] least three different ideas on the shout
[1:22:37] I'm sorry on the the three folds of
[1:22:39] brother Ram's seventh seal Vision the
[1:22:42] one the one thought is shout voice Trump
[1:22:44] the other one is seven Thunders how and
[1:22:47] when and the other one is seven Thunders
[1:22:49] and two
[1:22:50] unknowns okay like that's what brother
[1:22:52] Ram says in the sermon there's seven
[1:22:54] Thunders and there's two
[1:22:55] unknowns but then I believe that brother
[1:22:59] R realized it was already revealed after
[1:23:01] he preached it because the revelations
[1:23:03] of each seal was the voice of God
[1:23:04] telling us what the seals
[1:23:06] meant all right so that's what I
[1:23:09] believe that's what it seems to be like
[1:23:11] brother BR is telling
[1:23:12] us okay next one Christ same sermon now
[1:23:15] here's another one he says now the
[1:23:16] coming of the Lord is in a mystery we
[1:23:18] don't know when he's coming or how he's
[1:23:20] coming but we know he's
[1:23:22] coming so see those people will say we
[1:23:24] know he's coming the seven Thunders and
[1:23:26] there's the when and the how there's the
[1:23:27] three folds so some someone shared this
[1:23:29] with me years ago precious brother and
[1:23:31] he said there's the three folds and I
[1:23:32] said I like that's fine you know that's
[1:23:34] okay it might be but one thing I know if
[1:23:37] I got the oil I'm going praise God I
[1:23:40] don't know anything about the vision I
[1:23:41] didn't see it but I know the Bible if I
[1:23:43] got oil if I got the wedding garment on
[1:23:44] I'm going to be a part of that wedding
[1:23:45] supper Hallelujah if I got the
[1:23:47] righteousness of Christ and not my own
[1:23:49] righteousness I'll be there Hallelujah
[1:23:52] when the r Called Up Yonder I'll be
[1:23:53] there Hallelujah
[1:23:55] huah thank you
[1:23:58] Jesus so some people use this to say
[1:24:00] here's the threefolds we know he's
[1:24:02] coming which the seven Thunders would
[1:24:03] utter and tell us the revelations to
[1:24:05] know he's coming when he's coming right
[1:24:08] we we won't know the day or hour but
[1:24:09] brother said we might know the week
[1:24:11] month or year it's possible I mean it's
[1:24:14] possible right I mean think about the
[1:24:16] saints that were alive when the dead in
[1:24:18] Christ raised at Jesus resurrection they
[1:24:20] had to know something's happening here I
[1:24:22] imagine they were really sincere don't
[1:24:24] you
[1:24:25] imagine I saw Abraham today I mean we
[1:24:28] wouldn't joke about memes like right
[1:24:31] like we wouldn't say oh I don't like
[1:24:33] that song like we do you know we'd be
[1:24:35] like the rapture's coming son I know
[1:24:38] Dad let's go pray you know what I mean
[1:24:41] like we would be we'd be we'd be
[1:24:44] different right we would be uh just as
[1:24:48] sincere as
[1:24:49] possible and that's why I love God is a
[1:24:51] god of
[1:24:52] Grace and he even gave them 10 days to
[1:24:55] get the Holy Ghost 10 days that's how
[1:24:57] gracious God was now somebody had to
[1:25:00] cook some food in that time the Bible
[1:25:01] didn't say they were fasting so the
[1:25:03] sisters had to go out get some uh food
[1:25:06] some fish you know some
[1:25:07] bread so they God is gracious God got
[1:25:10] them ready for the Holy Ghost and so God
[1:25:13] will get us ready for the Rapture yes he
[1:25:15] might give us a month 40 days I don't
[1:25:17] know but if God was gracious to them
[1:25:20] he'll be gracious to us praise
[1:25:23] God
[1:25:26] that's the kind of God I serve God of
[1:25:27] Grace he's rich in
[1:25:29] Mercy okay in the same sermon now later
[1:25:31] in the sermon but in the last days the
[1:25:33] reason that was such a tremendous thing
[1:25:35] that he spoke of it here and showed
[1:25:37] those seven Thunders showed he showed
[1:25:42] them he said and then he goes to Life
[1:25:44] Magazine I left the magazine in there
[1:25:45] but I was going to bring it up and he he
[1:25:48] talks about the vision where the seven
[1:25:49] angels met him and said go back to the
[1:25:51] Jeffersonville and open the Seven Seals
[1:25:53] for Christ because Christ was going to
[1:25:54] show them the revelations of
[1:25:56] it
[1:25:57] okay uh yeah showed was past
[1:26:01] tense he showed them seven Thunders I
[1:26:04] thought they're mystery no they're
[1:26:05] showed and you're going to hear him say
[1:26:07] they're already
[1:26:09] revealed they're already
[1:26:13] fulfilled now I haven't been keeping
[1:26:14] track of the Stars I don't want I mean
[1:26:16] you don't have to keep track of them I'm
[1:26:17] just let you know there's seven of them
[1:26:18] okay 1964 now think about that that was
[1:26:21] what that was June no that was July
[1:26:25] five more months he never even mentions
[1:26:26] the seven
[1:26:28] Thunders five more months doesn't
[1:26:30] mention it so I you know for me I would
[1:26:33] think if this Prophet had this major
[1:26:34] Vision about all of us we got to get the
[1:26:36] seven Thunders before the Rapture I
[1:26:38] would think he would preach it more
[1:26:39] often don't
[1:26:40] you but if he thought that's what the
[1:26:43] Revelation was in those sermons he could
[1:26:45] relax oh they just got to drawn out to
[1:26:48] God and that's why he would say in 64
[1:26:50] he's like if you ever get a tape he said
[1:26:52] I'm not a tape salesman but if you ever
[1:26:54] want a tape of anything I believe that
[1:26:55] was inspired he said if I ever preach
[1:26:57] anything inspired it was those Seven
[1:26:59] Seals amen glory that just struck me I
[1:27:02] didn't even that wasn't in my notes
[1:27:04] amen if I ever preach anything go listen
[1:27:07] to those Seven Seals
[1:27:10] Hallelujah that was probably well that's
[1:27:13] probably the most well I don't the
[1:27:14] church age book and the Seven seal book
[1:27:16] were probably the two most important
[1:27:17] books I've ever read in my entire life
[1:27:19] outside of the Bible if you want a close
[1:27:21] walk with God if you want to know the
[1:27:22] word of God read the church age book and
[1:27:24] the Seven seal book I know you've heard
[1:27:25] me say that before I just want to share
[1:27:27] for the live streamers anybody else
[1:27:28] that's young here you uh little
[1:27:31] pre-teens and teens get into that church
[1:27:33] age book by God's good right AAA amen
[1:27:36] all right sisters thank you sister
[1:27:38] Hallelujah the unveiling of God now this
[1:27:40] is almost a year later almost a year
[1:27:42] later he finally mentions it again back
[1:27:44] in
[1:27:46] Jeffersonville everyone has come to me
[1:27:48] and said brother Braham them seven
[1:27:49] Thunders The Voice uttered he said write
[1:27:51] it not but close it up that'll be seven
[1:27:52] Thunders that'll be revealed to us in
[1:27:54] the last day see seven Thunders that'll
[1:27:56] tell us now don't that sound real good
[1:27:59] see but watch what you're talking about
[1:28:00] when you say that so I I don't know if I
[1:28:02] have the quotes but a person was saying
[1:28:04] brother Bram you can write your own new
[1:28:05] Bible that's basically a tactic of Satan
[1:28:08] just like the Mormon Church wrote their
[1:28:10] new
[1:28:10] Bibles so brother R tells us the devil's
[1:28:13] trying to tempt him to write a new Bible
[1:28:15] like an addition to the
[1:28:18] Bible he said well see see that you
[1:28:20] write it not see the seven Thunders
[1:28:22] utter their voices don't write that see
[1:28:23] it's to be be sealed up in the book
[1:28:25] until the last days and someone has been
[1:28:27] many has been saying to me brother
[1:28:28] brandom if the Lord God with your
[1:28:30] experience that the Lord's given you
[1:28:31] with for his people humbly saying this
[1:28:34] you would be eligible to write a Bible
[1:28:36] yourself your word if God manifested I
[1:28:38] said that might be true he see but he
[1:28:39] was trying to catch me and I said but
[1:28:42] you see I couldn't do that why couldn't
[1:28:44] you you have all the
[1:28:46] qualifications I said but look one word
[1:28:48] cannot be added or taken away see I'm
[1:28:50] sorry that covered up the word away but
[1:28:52] you you know and he said well then them
[1:28:54] seven Thunders you see wouldn't them
[1:28:56] seven Thunders blasting out won't that
[1:28:58] be a revelation give to some man in
[1:29:01] order words in other words to write a
[1:29:02] new Bible right I said no sir it would
[1:29:06] be adding something to the Bible or
[1:29:08] taking something from the
[1:29:11] Bible now look it's all revealed in
[1:29:17] there and the Seven Seals
[1:29:20] opened already opened up the revelation
[1:29:24] of what that seven Thunders was come on
[1:29:27] church I just to say that I'm just I'm
[1:29:28] just excited sorry come on brother Jesse
[1:29:31] amen it's already opened up the Seven
[1:29:33] Seals already reveal what those seven
[1:29:35] Thunders uttered
[1:29:37] hallelujah oh write a new Bible brother
[1:29:39] B you got all these qualifications no
[1:29:41] it's already in there it's already it's
[1:29:42] already been
[1:29:45] preached that's what it was see it's
[1:29:48] still in the word you see you can't get
[1:29:50] out of that word I love that it won't
[1:29:51] leave the word and God's spirit will
[1:29:53] never everybody say never God's spirit
[1:29:55] will never leave that word
[1:29:58] hallelujah it will never lead you away
[1:30:00] from the word of God it'll lead you to
[1:30:01] the word of God I'm just getting some
[1:30:03] boldness here by God's grace I just that
[1:30:04] blessed my heart it'll stay right with
[1:30:06] the word blinding some and Open the Eyes
[1:30:08] of other it's always doing that so in
[1:30:11] this one quote he says the seals are
[1:30:13] revealed the seals are open and it
[1:30:17] was all three are past tense it already
[1:30:20] was already was already
[1:30:22] was
[1:30:27] Feast of trumpets is this the same
[1:30:28] sermon no I'm sorry that was unveiling
[1:30:30] God this is Feast of
[1:30:33] trumpets okay now notice Revelation 10 1
[1:30:36] to 7 remember the seal the Thunders are
[1:30:38] in there it's verses three and four all
[1:30:40] the Mysteries are to be revealed to the
[1:30:41] bride by the messenger of the leosan
[1:30:44] church well if someone's expecting
[1:30:47] another Prophet to rise up are they the
[1:30:48] messenger and brother BR wasn't the
[1:30:52] messenger see he has any anybody got a
[1:30:54] revised Bible version if you have you'll
[1:30:56] notice where the angel it says the eagle
[1:30:58] uhhuh the messenger to lean Church
[1:31:00] Revelation 1017 and he said this in that
[1:31:02] day that he seen him come down and eat
[1:31:04] up the little book he put one foot on
[1:31:06] the land and one foot on the sea and
[1:31:07] swore by him that lives forever and ever
[1:31:09] time shall be no more and when he did
[1:31:10] seven under Thunders uttered their
[1:31:12] voices when the seven Thunders uttered
[1:31:14] their voices John said he was about to
[1:31:15] write he said don't write it uhhuh see
[1:31:17] and he sealed it so in the same in the
[1:31:19] same quote this doesn't maybe add a
[1:31:21] whole lot but in the same quote he's
[1:31:22] talking about the Thunders he says all
[1:31:24] the Mysteries are revealed by Brother
[1:31:26] brandom by my Ministry not by someone
[1:31:30] else rising up but brother
[1:31:32] Brandon okay Feast of trumpets U next
[1:31:36] quote Oh yeah this
[1:31:42] was oh yeah they ask him brother Bram
[1:31:45] those Seven Seals brother Bram that will
[1:31:46] be revealed in the last day some great
[1:31:48] mystery how do we get closer to God no
[1:31:50] sir it cannot be so in other words
[1:31:52] they're talking about well if the SE a
[1:31:54] revelation you got to write a new Bible
[1:31:55] but he said whosoever shall take one
[1:31:57] word from this Bible add one to it his
[1:31:59] part will be taken from The Book of Life
[1:32:01] what it is is a revelation of of what's
[1:32:03] been missed back there to bring it so
[1:32:06] past Generations missed the revelation
[1:32:08] of the Seven Seals because it wasn't
[1:32:09] God's time to reveal it Hallelujah see
[1:32:13] it's already in there it's wrote in
[1:32:14] there it's in here it's to reveal what
[1:32:15] already has been written because you
[1:32:17] can't add one thing or take one word
[1:32:18] away from it and then three paragraphs
[1:32:20] later he says this is the complete
[1:32:22] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:32:25] I like that that's a new sound we don't
[1:32:27] hear too much
[1:32:28] right this is a complete revelation of
[1:32:31] Jesus Christ and the seals had the
[1:32:33] Mysteries hid of what it all
[1:32:36] was and it's supposed to be open the
[1:32:38] last day at the leene age at the end
[1:32:40] time thanks be to God that finishes the
[1:32:42] message to the church that finishes it
[1:32:46] finish not something extra but it
[1:32:50] finishes it brother man's Ministry
[1:32:51] finishes
[1:32:52] it
[1:32:55] and then again now here this a few
[1:32:56] months later I already read this or
[1:32:57] mentioned it one month later have the
[1:33:00] seven Thunders which equals seven
[1:33:02] Mysteries already been revealed were
[1:33:04] they revealed in the Seven Seals but not
[1:33:06] yet known to us in the Thunders yet no
[1:33:09] they were revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:33:12] that's what the Thunders was
[1:33:14] about so a thunder is a voice of God so
[1:33:17] the voice of God seven times told us
[1:33:20] what the seals
[1:33:22] meant
[1:33:24] they was to reveal right the seven
[1:33:26] Thunders that had uttered their voices
[1:33:28] and no one could make it out what it was
[1:33:29] John knew what it was but he was
[1:33:31] forbidden to write he said but the
[1:33:32] seventh angel in the days of his
[1:33:34] sounding the seven Mysteries of the
[1:33:35] seven Thunders would be revealed so what
[1:33:37] does he connect this to Revelation
[1:33:40] 10:7 now look we got a quote and we got
[1:33:42] the
[1:33:44] scripture and the seventh angel is a
[1:33:46] messenger of the seven Church age see
[1:33:49] like I said on Wednesday see can
[1:33:50] everybody
[1:33:51] see I see by God's grace now here's a
[1:33:56] few things that you know some people ask
[1:33:57] about in the quotes in 1965 brother
[1:34:00] raham in each time he talks about
[1:34:01] wanting to preach the seven Thunders
[1:34:04] along with the vows and the
[1:34:06] trumpets okay now to me that that
[1:34:10] doesn't mean like the Thunders weren't
[1:34:12] revealed yet it just means he was going
[1:34:13] to tie them all together that's the word
[1:34:15] he uses tie he's going to tie everything
[1:34:17] together
[1:34:19] okay and really church if you think
[1:34:21] about it if everybody's really spiritual
[1:34:22] here or try to be
[1:34:24] if he would have preached the vials and
[1:34:25] the trumpets he would have been
[1:34:26] preaching the Sixth Seal again because
[1:34:28] all those things happen under the Sixth
[1:34:30] Seal because the Sixth Seal is the
[1:34:31] Tribulation
[1:34:33] seal right and that might have been
[1:34:34] helpful right it might have been helpful
[1:34:35] to understand the six seal but did God
[1:34:37] allow him to do it no God didn't allow
[1:34:39] God wanted us to have to pray about
[1:34:41] something right God wanted us to search
[1:34:44] the
[1:34:45] scriptures God wanted us to man manifest
[1:34:48] love Hallelujah so you'll see three
[1:34:51] three or four quotes in here where
[1:34:52] brother says I want to preach the seven
[1:34:54] Thunders but don't forget what he's
[1:34:56] already said and don't forget what he's
[1:34:58] going to let be printed in the in the
[1:34:59] church age book all right everybody
[1:35:02] everybody Hanging On by God's grace all
[1:35:04] right how many got a tighter grip now
[1:35:05] that you're hanging
[1:35:07] on that's that's how I
[1:35:09] feel okay I can't I can't forget this
[1:35:12] one so before he even says he wants to
[1:35:14] preach on it he again says it's history
[1:35:17] the seven Thunders are history God
[1:35:20] already fulfilled his
[1:35:22] word now to me that makes sense why he
[1:35:25] would never mention the vision again
[1:35:26] because it's already fulfilled the
[1:35:28] vision of the seven seal I'm talking
[1:35:29] about with the three
[1:35:31] folds I know we're getting into some
[1:35:32] deep
[1:35:33] Waters what happened on Mount Sunset now
[1:35:36] Sunset was where brother B got the
[1:35:37] king's sword remember it would have been
[1:35:39] uh February of
[1:35:41] 62 no 63 February of 63 it was
[1:35:44] prophesied in December of 62 but he went
[1:35:47] out there to Arizona in January but he
[1:35:49] had the experience in February if I'm
[1:35:51] not
[1:35:52] mistaken okay now this sermon is
[1:35:55] beautiful brother R says he shows how
[1:35:56] God fulfilled all these scriptures on
[1:35:58] mountains
[1:35:59] amen like God told Moses you'll come
[1:36:02] back and you'll know I'm with you
[1:36:03] because I'll meet with you again on this
[1:36:05] mountain Hallelujah and then Jesus he
[1:36:08] got to meet Moses and Elijah on the
[1:36:10] Mount of transfiguration Hallelujah and
[1:36:13] then when Jesus comes down on the donkey
[1:36:14] right Palm Sunday we're coming up on
[1:36:16] that next Sunday by God's grace it was
[1:36:19] fulfilled on a mountain Jesus was coming
[1:36:20] down the mountain hallelujah amen and so
[1:36:23] brother ends the sermon by saying God
[1:36:26] has fulfilled his word on a mountain
[1:36:27] with me
[1:36:28] Hallelujah
[1:36:30] glory is that something brother Austin
[1:36:33] my goodness that something sister Lena
[1:36:35] God would fulfill more scripture about a
[1:36:37] mountain in our day I just look at you
[1:36:40] because you're kind of new to this and
[1:36:41] it took me all these years to understand
[1:36:43] this so I feel good for
[1:36:45] you I had to wrestle with this a few
[1:36:47] more years you know maybe than others
[1:36:48] have to but people might still it's okay
[1:36:50] if you wrestle with it like I said it
[1:36:52] was so good for me to so it's a good
[1:36:53] question it's so good for me to go back
[1:36:55] and read every single quote about it it
[1:36:57] was very good because then I get the
[1:36:58] full picture on
[1:37:00] it now he again then he goes through his
[1:37:03] oh I'm sorry I didn't even finish
[1:37:04] reading it he says that's what all this
[1:37:06] noise is about it's God fulfilling his
[1:37:08] promised word again Revelation 10 1 to7
[1:37:11] so three and four are the Thunders and
[1:37:14] in the days of the sounding of the
[1:37:15] seventh angel message that's verse seven
[1:37:17] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:37:18] the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1:7
[1:37:21] the last message to the last Church age
[1:37:23] fulfills exactly in this age Luke St
[1:37:25] Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man
[1:37:27] shall be revealed he talks more about
[1:37:29] his ministry and then right before they
[1:37:31] pray he says these notable words and the
[1:37:34] god of Heaven promised that evening time
[1:37:35] would have evening lights three years
[1:37:37] ago this mystery was a prophecy what
[1:37:40] time is it sir now let me pause right
[1:37:42] there when brother am preached what time
[1:37:44] was it sir he told the vision of meeting
[1:37:46] the seven angels and then he didn't know
[1:37:48] is this is this the end of my life he
[1:37:50] said is this something awful is God
[1:37:52] calling me off the scene or is it a
[1:37:54] furtherment of my Ministry Hallelujah
[1:37:56] and then when he preached the seven seal
[1:37:57] he said now I know what it was the thing
[1:37:59] I wanted my whole life now I know what
[1:38:01] it was it a furthering of the ministry I
[1:38:03] was to go out west to get Commission on
[1:38:05] a mountain to go back and open the Seven
[1:38:07] Seals for God
[1:38:09] hallelujah hallelujah and brother said
[1:38:12] Moses was driven to the Wilderness to
[1:38:13] get the Revelation Paul was driven to
[1:38:15] the Wilderness to get the Revelation so
[1:38:17] brother Ram had to be driven to the
[1:38:18] Wilderness to get the Revelation
[1:38:21] Hallelujah Glory
[1:38:28] but now it's
[1:38:30] history he says it's passed the prophecy
[1:38:33] is fulfilled what time is it sir what's
[1:38:35] the attraction God fulfilling his word
[1:38:38] now remember I showed you the quote
[1:38:39] brother Ram said another name for the
[1:38:42] sermon title of cers the end time is
[1:38:44] seven Thunders it's another name for
[1:38:46] it's a
[1:38:47] synonym right so brother Ram says in
[1:38:50] other words we could say seven Thunders
[1:38:52] what's the attraction it's God
[1:38:54] fulfilling his
[1:38:56] word that's why I love that after the
[1:38:58] second seal brother Ram got done crowd's
[1:39:01] kind of quiet you can hear him closing
[1:39:02] his Bible he stands back there's a
[1:39:04] little pause he says that's thus sayith
[1:39:07] the Lord hallelujah when did a man ever
[1:39:10] say that Hallelujah we've never heard
[1:39:12] that and then the Crowd Goes they just
[1:39:14] go wild worshiping God and he say if all
[1:39:17] these other Revelations it if all these
[1:39:19] other dreams is hit so will this also
[1:39:21] that's thus sayith the Lord amen oh wish
[1:39:23] I could have been there amen
[1:39:28] hallelujah so if this is history then
[1:39:31] the seven Thunders are history that's
[1:39:33] what he says here it's history so
[1:39:34] they're open revealed fulfilled showed
[1:39:40] history now here's here's some that you
[1:39:42] know we wonder about this is why I try
[1:39:44] to be in in the middle now I don't sound
[1:39:45] like I'm in the middle because I'm all
[1:39:48] excited but if you ask me I would say
[1:39:50] I'm trying to be neutral but this is my
[1:39:52] conviction
[1:39:54] right and was not allowed to have the
[1:39:56] auditorium so brother BR was trying to
[1:39:58] set up meetings right he said we could
[1:40:01] have one service but they would not let
[1:40:03] us pray for any sick well that's my
[1:40:05] Ministry to pray for the sick so I
[1:40:06] refused it and I said in doing this I've
[1:40:09] come here for the purpose of teaching
[1:40:10] the last vials so he came back to
[1:40:11] Jeffersonville teach the vials which is
[1:40:13] the Sixth Seal and the seventh vials
[1:40:15] part of The Sixth Seal and the Seven
[1:40:17] trumpets six seal and the last seven
[1:40:20] Thunders which were not in the
[1:40:22] tribulation period
[1:40:23] they got to be in the Gentile Church
[1:40:25] ages to file the opening of The Seven
[1:40:28] Seals and seven Church ages so see the
[1:40:31] other side will say look uh brother
[1:40:34] ramam says the seals and church ages are
[1:40:36] open but not the seven Thunders well
[1:40:38] don't
[1:40:39] forget in the previous year brother Ram
[1:40:41] said they're already
[1:40:43] revealed okay so it's just something to
[1:40:47] keep in mind that's why we want to be
[1:40:49] humble
[1:40:51] um yeah tying okay there there's yeah so
[1:40:54] tying so see that's the word to use I
[1:40:55] don't know why at school I do that all
[1:40:57] the time so because I got the projector
[1:40:58] so here I just I'm in the I'm just got
[1:41:01] these habits time so see he wanted he
[1:41:04] wanted to tie everything together the
[1:41:06] seals the church ages that's what we get
[1:41:08] to do amen hallelujah the trumpets the
[1:41:11] vials the Thunders let's tie it all
[1:41:13] together but did God let him do that no
[1:41:16] God had to have something for the bride
[1:41:17] to do praise
[1:41:19] God uh next week is that the next week
[1:41:22] yeah two weeks two weeks and he said
[1:41:24] there be hideous sights upon the Earth
[1:41:26] Locust like hairs a woman this is uh the
[1:41:28] fifth trumpet in Revelation N9 Locust
[1:41:31] with hairlike women long hair to haunt
[1:41:32] the women that cut their hair think
[1:41:33] about that they'll be haunted because
[1:41:35] they cut their hair God will haunt them
[1:41:38] and how about color their hair like pink
[1:41:39] and purple and all kinds of fuchsia
[1:41:41] whatever they got to haunt them this is
[1:41:44] what God wanted your hair to look like
[1:41:46] it's going to haunt you for however long
[1:41:48] they they're haunted I think it's five
[1:41:50] months teeth like lions Stingers in
[1:41:52] their tails like like scorpions they
[1:41:54] would torment men months just wait till
[1:41:56] we get into opening them plagues and
[1:41:58] seals and them seven Thunders now look I
[1:42:01] already showed you quotes where brother
[1:42:02] said the seals were open right and I've
[1:42:04] already showed you quotes where brother
[1:42:06] said the seven Thunders were already
[1:42:09] revealed so which one are they well you
[1:42:12] just got to make a choice right and just
[1:42:13] be keep a Christian Spirit whatever you
[1:42:15] decide right and keep seeking God
[1:42:17] whichever part you go on right that's
[1:42:19] why I was praying up here God give us
[1:42:21] Revelation no wonder brother R said we
[1:42:23] should pray for Revelation more than
[1:42:24] anything else God make your will known
[1:42:26] to us unveil something so I can see it
[1:42:29] plainly with eyes that have isav on it
[1:42:31] holy ghost I isow by God's
[1:42:34] grace oh brother better get to Goan now
[1:42:37] goam was when the plagues were falling
[1:42:40] that represents the tribulation
[1:42:42] period
[1:42:44] right see while you while there's time
[1:42:46] to get to gotion don't pay any attention
[1:42:48] to this
[1:42:49] outside so again he just he just
[1:42:51] mentions it in passing the rest of the
[1:42:52] sermon he never never mentioned
[1:42:55] it so again it seems like he wanted to
[1:42:57] tie the Thunders together with the seals
[1:42:59] tribulation events vials trumpets of
[1:43:02] course God did not allow it because God
[1:43:04] is all knowing god is all wise God has a
[1:43:06] purpose for
[1:43:07] everything uh the next week Christ
[1:43:09] revealed his own word the last T week's
[1:43:12] tapes I think will reveal to you the
[1:43:13] great hideous things we're going to
[1:43:14] speak on one of these days when we get a
[1:43:16] place sufficient of the opening of those
[1:43:18] last plagues to be poured out upon the
[1:43:20] Earth those vials rather pouring out the
[1:43:23] the seven vows and the Seven Thunders
[1:43:24] and those hideous sights that's come
[1:43:28] upon the
[1:43:29] Earth okay man now and people today are
[1:43:32] in such a neurotic condition the whole
[1:43:34] world okay so now this is just uh
[1:43:37] interesting to me the Thunders are
[1:43:38] spoken in the context of the Great
[1:43:40] Tribulation what about the rapturing
[1:43:42] faith context that they were preached on
[1:43:44] so I I don't understand that but again
[1:43:46] it's a quote I want to acknowledge it
[1:43:49] but we can't forget all the quotes
[1:43:50] you've already heard right
[1:43:54] okay that's the last time he mentioned
[1:43:55] it so think about that he lived for four
[1:43:58] more months he never mentioned the seven
[1:44:00] Thunders one more time now you you can I
[1:44:03] think you can prove this I I think I
[1:44:05] tried it one time people around brother
[1:44:07] brandham felt like he knew he was going
[1:44:09] to die soon in 1965 and there's quotes
[1:44:12] where they kind of tie it together he
[1:44:14] said is this my going home time and all
[1:44:15] these things I know he said I'll ride
[1:44:17] this Trail again I got to make a video
[1:44:18] on that one sometime at some point
[1:44:21] um but I would just think again I would
[1:44:23] think if he knew he was going off the
[1:44:25] scene and he knew these Thunders had to
[1:44:27] sound to get rapturing Faith and he
[1:44:29] thought the Rapture was so soon I would
[1:44:31] think he would have mentioned it in one
[1:44:32] of those four months you know before he
[1:44:35] passed away but he never does so again
[1:44:37] to me that's another sign it's probably
[1:44:40] already fulfilled it's already history
[1:44:42] it's probably already opened it's
[1:44:43] probably already
[1:44:45] showed so the church age book chapter
[1:44:49] nine brother BR is going through uh the
[1:44:51] his ministry the messenger to the age he
[1:44:54] quotes the the seven Thunder scriptures
[1:44:57] what was in those Thunders no one knows
[1:44:59] right because John didn't write it but
[1:45:01] we need to know we need to know and it
[1:45:04] will take a prophet to get the
[1:45:06] Revelation because God has no other way
[1:45:07] of bringing out his scriptural
[1:45:09] Revelations except by a prophet the word
[1:45:12] always came by a prophet and always
[1:45:15] will I don't know about you brother van
[1:45:17] and brother Jose but when I hear someone
[1:45:18] around the message say I'm a prophet my
[1:45:20] ears go like
[1:45:21] this what
[1:45:24] I'm going to watch you for every red
[1:45:25] flag I
[1:45:28] can and we should do that brother BR
[1:45:30] said a Shepherd should watch over the
[1:45:32] Sheep right usually they're
[1:45:33] self-exalting themselves most of them
[1:45:36] have been false prophets that I've
[1:45:38] seen but again if you're on this side
[1:45:41] where you're looking for the
[1:45:42] Thunders what are you going to say about
[1:45:44] this you know you it has to be revealed
[1:45:47] by a prophet someone's got to be a
[1:45:49] prophet and then every bride member is
[1:45:50] going to be able to say well yes that
[1:45:52] person's a that man's a Prophet he's got
[1:45:53] thus sayi the Lord yes this and this is
[1:45:55] producing rapturing
[1:45:59] Faith so either brother Braham has to
[1:46:01] come back and reveal the Thunders which
[1:46:03] but I believe he already did reveal the
[1:46:05] Thunders or a future minor Prophet he's
[1:46:07] got to be a minor
[1:46:10] Prophet right because we already had
[1:46:12] brother Ram come as a major prophet to
[1:46:13] give us thus say the Lord on the entire
[1:46:15] Bible revelations all the Mysteries
[1:46:17] they're called Mysteries have been
[1:46:19] finished
[1:46:21] uh and this and then then to me if
[1:46:23] another man's got to rise up and be a
[1:46:25] prophet and then reveal seven Mysteries
[1:46:28] wouldn't this be a sign of the Rapture
[1:46:31] right it would have to be that's I never
[1:46:32] even thought about that till right now
[1:46:34] that's another reason that's 11 reasons
[1:46:35] right
[1:46:37] there if a man has to rise up and say
[1:46:39] thus sayi the Lord here's the revelation
[1:46:41] of the seven Thunders and that brings
[1:46:42] rapturing Faith wouldn't that be a sign
[1:46:44] for the Rapture but what does brother R
[1:46:47] say brother R says thus say the Lord my
[1:46:49] Ministry is the last sign to the
[1:46:51] Gentiles amen Hallelujah there it is
[1:46:53] brother Jose Glory I love that while
[1:46:56] you're preaching the word of God God
[1:46:57] gives you Revelation now I had it on
[1:46:59] there but I didn't really understand the
[1:47:01] significance of that glory amen because
[1:47:05] you got to know these Mysteries to go in
[1:47:07] the Rapture that's a sign the Rapture is
[1:47:10] here but God already gave it to us
[1:47:14] hallelujah I think the spirit of
[1:47:16] Revelation is here brother Hallelujah
[1:47:18] the Holy
[1:47:20] Spirit I hope this is recorded
[1:47:23] I'm going to forget all
[1:47:26] this yeah because brother man said there
[1:47:28] is not another sign to the Gentile that
[1:47:31] goes higher or greater than this I would
[1:47:33] think if you bring rapturing Faith
[1:47:34] that's greater because that's going to
[1:47:36] change our
[1:47:38] bodies but said it may grow back limbs
[1:47:41] that are missing
[1:47:42] like make them
[1:47:44] appear put eyes that have been poked out
[1:47:47] put eyes back in there I mean it can do
[1:47:49] anything God's spirit can do anything
[1:47:51] with a rapturing faith
[1:47:55] faith and the last quote uh okay there's
[1:47:58] one more yeah now this messenger Malachi
[1:48:00] 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:48:02] things one according to Malachi 4 he'll
[1:48:04] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:48:05] fathers and remember if the Thunders
[1:48:07] aren't open then your hearts our hearts
[1:48:09] are not turned
[1:48:11] yet but my heart's on the word of God
[1:48:14] number two he will reveal the mysteries
[1:48:16] of the seven thunders in Revelation 10
[1:48:18] which are the revelations contained in
[1:48:21] the Seven Seals so that goes back to
[1:48:22] that first question are the Seals and
[1:48:24] the Thunders the same not
[1:48:25] exactly the seals are the symbols of
[1:48:28] what happened during the church ages and
[1:48:29] then of course after with the Jews and
[1:48:31] then the tribulation and then the
[1:48:34] Rapture he says it will be these
[1:48:36] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:48:39] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:48:40] children to the Pentecostal
[1:48:43] fathers exactly
[1:48:45] so he let this be written and and
[1:48:49] printed before he went off the scene so
[1:48:52] the Thunders are not revealed our hearts
[1:48:54] are not turned back that would be awful
[1:48:56] for me to think of my heart still isn't
[1:48:57] on the apostolic
[1:48:59] fathers yet I baptize in the same way
[1:49:01] they did I've seen these signs file them
[1:49:04] that believe in Mark 16 I've seen those
[1:49:05] same signs I preach through all those
[1:49:07] books of Paul's gospel you know
[1:49:10] Galatians Ephesians Philippians
[1:49:11] Colossians now I'm on Romans I'm
[1:49:13] preaching Paul's gospel yet my heart's
[1:49:15] not turned back to Paul's gospel what is
[1:49:17] my heart on my heart's got to be on the
[1:49:19] apostolic fathers
[1:49:21] Hallelujah or else I wouldn't care what
[1:49:23] the apostles said our whole lives prove
[1:49:27] we care what the apostles
[1:49:31] said remember now here's I brought up to
[1:49:33] this false prophet on the internet uh he
[1:49:36] actually lives in Ohio
[1:49:38] too um but brother brandham said thus
[1:49:40] sayith the Lord in 1965 in anointed ones
[1:49:43] at the end time he said thus sayith the
[1:49:45] Lord Malachi 45 and six was already on
[1:49:48] the earth and the newspapers were
[1:49:51] already writing about it now that just
[1:49:52] struck me too if someone has to rise up
[1:49:56] that means they got to fulfill Malachi
[1:49:57] 45 and 6 because our hearts are not
[1:49:58] turned back wow that's another one
[1:50:01] that's that's 12 reasons I think I'm at
[1:50:03] 12 now 12 is a good number government of
[1:50:05] the church 12 New Testament Mysteries 12
[1:50:09] tribes of Israel
[1:50:12] Hallelujah 12 uh Stones Elijah had to
[1:50:14] put the altar back up there look at that
[1:50:17] that it just struck me
[1:50:19] now he's here amen I believe that by
[1:50:22] God's grace amen you don't hear me say
[1:50:24] that too often but those those are those
[1:50:27] are in very very powerful thus say the
[1:50:29] Lord's statements and that's why I told
[1:50:31] this guy on the internet he said I've
[1:50:33] got a double anointing of brother
[1:50:35] brandham I got a double portion of
[1:50:36] brother brandham and I'm turning the
[1:50:38] hearts
[1:50:39] back I'm like you're crazy dude you're
[1:50:43] crazy if I I said you can't turn the
[1:50:47] hearts back because brother Bram already
[1:50:48] said thus sayith the Lord he was turning
[1:50:50] them
[1:50:51] back right and that then and then his
[1:50:54] ministry with a double portion would be
[1:50:55] a greater sign than brother Bram now you
[1:50:56] break that thus sayith the
[1:50:59] Lord you got a double and I said the
[1:51:01] Bible interprets itself double portion
[1:51:03] produce double Miracles so I said you
[1:51:05] better get started on your prayer lines
[1:51:08] like brother BR said Joseph would do
[1:51:09] double times double everything brother
[1:51:10] BR did that's four
[1:51:12] times he's got to speak 28 squirrels
[1:51:15] into
[1:51:17] existence that's a lot of prayer lines
[1:51:19] that they got to catch up on they don't
[1:51:20] have much time to do
[1:51:21] it Joseph got to do four times and then
[1:51:24] this supposed brother has got a double
[1:51:25] anointing the Bible interprets itself
[1:51:27] he's got to do Twice The
[1:51:28] Miracles see that's it's just nonsense
[1:51:31] these people talking about these false
[1:51:33] prophets nonsense they're
[1:51:36] deceived but you know what somebody's
[1:51:38] got to stand against them praise God
[1:51:40] didn't Jeremiah have to stand there and
[1:51:42] say fine let believe zedekiah believe
[1:51:45] haniah whatever you want but God will
[1:51:47] back up his word hallelujah
[1:51:50] amen sometimes I wonder why I'm in this
[1:51:52] Arena all these people blaspheming me
[1:51:54] call me why am I why I got to stand here
[1:51:56] well every other man of God had to
[1:51:58] Hallelujah everybody else had to be
[1:52:00] mocked and made fun of they made fun of
[1:52:01] Jeremiah and he suffered way more than
[1:52:03] I've suffered being thrown in pits and
[1:52:05] chained up and thinking he's going to
[1:52:07] die these men suffered greater things
[1:52:10] than we've
[1:52:13] suffered but the Bible said he promised
[1:52:15] in the last days he sent the spirit of
[1:52:17] Elijah and will call the people the
[1:52:18] children of God back to the original
[1:52:20] Faith like it was at the beginning of
[1:52:21] the word that word was confirmed the son
[1:52:23] of man the last days is the same as it
[1:52:24] was at Sodom yesterday today and forever
[1:52:27] he promised to do it it's God's promise
[1:52:28] it's thus sayeth the
[1:52:30] Lord notice they did the same thing just
[1:52:32] as Moses did till God got enough from it
[1:52:35] remember so he says it again remember
[1:52:37] it's thus sayith the Lord it'll come to
[1:52:38] pass in this day now search the word
[1:52:41] over take every C take every Clan well
[1:52:43] we got a lot of them today don't we a
[1:52:44] lot of cson Clans out there they call
[1:52:47] themselves message Believers take every
[1:52:49] man take every church I charge you in
[1:52:51] Christ's name to do this you preachers I
[1:52:54] charge you to read the newspapers or
[1:52:55] take consideration anywhere you want to
[1:52:57] and see if it isn't on the Earth right
[1:53:00] now see thus sayeth the
[1:53:03] Lord twice he tells
[1:53:06] him and this guy says he's
[1:53:08] Elijah or he says he's the Elisha of the
[1:53:11] Elijah I'm sorry there ain't no Elisha
[1:53:13] after Elijah Malachi 4
[1:53:17] sorry see so Malachi 45 and6 is already
[1:53:20] fulfilled nobody else is going to turn
[1:53:22] our hearts back because if if they got
[1:53:24] the revelation of the Thunders that
[1:53:25] would reveal the seals to us that means
[1:53:27] the seals aren't even revealed yet my
[1:53:32] goodness I I don't know I just feel I
[1:53:35] feel something here today the holy
[1:53:36] spirit's here today praise God like I
[1:53:38] didn't even realize that that look at
[1:53:40] all
[1:53:41] the if if people miss the truth look
[1:53:44] what it
[1:53:45] does it makes the word of God not
[1:53:48] fulfilled and it makes us looking for
[1:53:50] somebody else who's and then it makes
[1:53:52] all these thus say the Lord's
[1:53:54] wrong but I believe God has proven them
[1:53:57] right no one's Ro risen up with a uh a
[1:54:00] Ministry half as brother random maybe a
[1:54:03] fourth I don't know maybe less I'm not
[1:54:06] saying I know what I'm saying is nobody
[1:54:07] spoke like brother random Hallelujah
[1:54:09] with the thus sayi the Lord in the
[1:54:12] Bible so Malachi 45 and 6 has already
[1:54:15] come to pass if the second part of the
[1:54:16] church age book is the second part of
[1:54:18] that church age Book quote about the
[1:54:21] Thunders
[1:54:24] uh if the first part is fulfilled as
[1:54:26] well I'm sorry if the second part of of
[1:54:28] that church a statement is fulfilled the
[1:54:30] Thunders then the first part is
[1:54:32] fulfilled as well because you need the
[1:54:34] revelation of the Thunders in order to
[1:54:35] have your heart turned back because
[1:54:37] remember he's got to do two
[1:54:39] things so he can't turn your heart back
[1:54:41] until he gets the seals opened everybody
[1:54:44] see
[1:54:45] that so if the Thunders haven't sounded
[1:54:49] yet then we don't have the heart nor do
[1:54:51] we have
[1:54:53] we don't have the heart nor do we have
[1:54:54] the the
[1:54:55] seals right because the Thunders tell us
[1:54:58] the seals and the seals turn our hearts
[1:55:00] back I need to make a graph of this
[1:55:01] brother amen and put it on the the
[1:55:03] internet according to this you got to
[1:55:05] have the Thunders first then you know
[1:55:07] the seals now you can have rapturing
[1:55:08] faith and your hearts turned back amen
[1:55:11] if and if you say the Thunders have not
[1:55:13] been uttered yet then you don't have any
[1:55:15] of that you're still way back here oh
[1:55:17] but let's be right up here where we got
[1:55:18] rapturing Grace Hallelujah I got the
[1:55:21] Holy Ghost I'm already glorified
[1:55:22] Hallelujah I'm looking for the latter
[1:55:24] rain
[1:55:25] Hallelujah I got a portion of rap if you
[1:55:28] have the Holy Ghost you have a portion
[1:55:29] of rapturing Faith but we're going to
[1:55:31] need an extra anointing for these change
[1:55:33] these vile vile bodies and these vile
[1:55:35] Minds
[1:55:37] amen all
[1:55:40] right well I'm glad I Was Here by God's
[1:55:43] grace
[1:55:48] um I've already do in about an hour and
[1:55:50] a half okay um
[1:55:53] I want
[1:55:55] to got something else on my heart here
[1:55:57] let me see
[1:55:58] here help me Jesus Lord let me look up I
[1:56:02] want to look up a quote real
[1:56:04] quick this might help
[1:56:12] you ah okay so I was looking for a quote
[1:56:17] um this is and then came Jesus in
[1:56:21] 1964
[1:56:23] B's talking about the
[1:56:27] Rapture yeah he's said maybe there's a
[1:56:29] little boy in here tonight or little
[1:56:30] girl was born in Seattle Washington now
[1:56:33] that book holds her name he's talking
[1:56:34] about the Lamb's Book of
[1:56:36] Life he come to redeem th whose name was
[1:56:39] on that book redeeming bring back from
[1:56:41] where it fell from and in the human race
[1:56:43] she was fallen or a child and she can't
[1:56:46] accept it right now she's too young so
[1:56:49] brother brother R was basically talking
[1:56:50] about getting the last person 's name on
[1:56:52] The Book of Life to be born again and
[1:56:55] then the Rapture can go right but
[1:56:57] remember it's a whole world thing every
[1:56:59] nation it's got to hear the gospel and
[1:57:01] have a chance to be born again now here
[1:57:04] here's what he said you've heard you
[1:57:05] maybe heard me say this before it's been
[1:57:06] years brother so the so the church WIll
[1:57:09] slug right along you ever seen a slug
[1:57:11] lately we're going to see one in
[1:57:13] springtime so the church WIll slug right
[1:57:16] around yet there's other quotes where
[1:57:17] the church has the power and the
[1:57:19] authority but to us both work right
[1:57:22] because we got we have the power we have
[1:57:23] the authority but it seems like
[1:57:25] scripture being fulfilled it seems like
[1:57:27] everything's going real slow we just
[1:57:28] keep going service after service month
[1:57:31] after month year after year we keep
[1:57:32] slugging
[1:57:34] along until the gospel gets to every
[1:57:37] single person whose name is on the
[1:57:39] Lamb's Book of
[1:57:40] Life so the church WIll slug right along
[1:57:43] just play
[1:57:44] along I think play means dance in the
[1:57:46] Hebrew so that's the way I'm going to
[1:57:48] interpret that I'm going to dance and
[1:57:49] praise the Lord hallelujah will you have
[1:57:51] meeting and so forth till that last
[1:57:53] person is brought in then that book is
[1:57:56] closed there's no more added then it's
[1:57:58] all over until that time will be none of
[1:58:01] us know but let just keep doing all we
[1:58:03] can to his glory until the time is over
[1:58:07] we don't know who that person is it who
[1:58:08] that person is it may already be in
[1:58:10] we're just waiting for his coming we
[1:58:13] don't
[1:58:13] know it'll never be revealed to man the
[1:58:16] time of his coming because not even the
[1:58:18] angels of heaven know when it's going to
[1:58:21] be but we're just looking for Anytime
[1:58:23] and waiting watching for his coming and
[1:58:25] the church
[1:58:26] said let's stand our feet I better stop
[1:58:28] right
[1:58:30] there musicians can
[1:58:38] come okay so further further things have
[1:58:40] seemed to open here uh maybe I won't put
[1:58:43] out that video I was going to put it out
[1:58:44] maybe this evening
[1:58:47] uh more implications but I hope
[1:58:50] everybody can see you know why I
[1:58:52] I have my convictions where I have my
[1:58:54] convictions by God's grace and I'm going
[1:58:55] to share this sermon and if I get the
[1:58:57] video out I'll share the video with
[1:58:58] others as well so everybody can kind
[1:59:01] of critique me if I'm wrong I just want
[1:59:03] somebody to show me right is that how
