the same Jess yeah it's USBC all right better so I learned that I have a little another Port here in the old computer that will work I don't know this will help see if this works here by God's grace have everybody feeling good this morning you know my life is maybe much like your own run yourself ragged all week and push and push and up late tired doing things staying up too late not for you know batteries and just doing Pride burn the candle both ends and just uh you know so we were asked my wife I was so tired so we're gonna we're gonna press on here by God's grace so okay here we go all right that's good all right praise the Lord so let's turn to John 15 by God's grace and we'll uh this just been on my heart here I saw just a couple things you know I'm just trying to think of you know waiting for some inspiration to strike on what the Lord would have me to teach and uh this is a been burning on my heart again here recently and I just wanted to kind of reiterate on these things foreign 15 5 through 7 we'll say these that will read these scriptures if we stand here just reading the word of God and it's um kind of comes as a conviction here as well you know putting more emphasis on the word of God and those sort of things because these words are not just words These Are Spiritual words so let's see here in John 15 5 he says I am the vine he says ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing amen isn't that the truth if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather at them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if he abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you so let's say a word of Prayer dearly father Lord Jesus Lord we love you so much Lord bless the Lord the hearers Lord of this little study God lord and Lord God we pray Lord to resonates Lord through our souls Lord through our minds and our hearts God lord and Lord Jesus Lord we certainly love and appreciate you Lord for calling us Lord to this message Lord to this revealed word in this hour Lord Lord if we think back to uh what we could have been or where we could be right now without your Amazing Grace and salvation Lord makes me tremble Lord God and just a terrifying thought God but Lord God you have preserved us Lord into Thy word Lord and brought us to a full salvation God and we're so thankful for those things Lord and we're just blessed to hear the word God help me to get beside myself Lord just uh speak whatever he had placed in my mind here Lord God we love you so much in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats I noticed there's a like a row missing here a little bit you guys were closer last time now that's why you take seats out of churches so you can dance and it kind of gathers you together even more a little bit you just gets the everything a little more happier in the family and uh sister who sorry uh for your loss there and brother Jesse's mention that in the back and that's just a tremendous loss and May Lord bless brother Amen brother Vang um and you may God give you strength in this hour if there's anything you would need let us know and we can do what we can there we're Living Waters Tabernacle to help this assembly as well whatever it would take we will try by God's grace um so this morning it's a little bit different seeing that sister Ally sister Emmy sitting here in this north of this section of Ohio strange feeling but it's okay [Laughter] that pushed through so yeah this morning I'd like to I'd like to speak on this here by God's grace he says I am the vine and you're the branches he that abideth and me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit and without me you can do nothing saints of God and that's why we need uh to be walking with the Lord you know and uh it makes you wonder you know how the Lord in Genesis um and I believe is Genesis 3 there and how God sealed up he sealed up the garden he sealed up the tree of life he sealed it with the cherubims and and you know he said he said if you could just get back to this tree you would uh live forever you know Adam and Eve I'm sure longed in their hearts to see to get to a time where they could maybe God would ReStore in their age in their day in their lifetime hoping that the Lord would do something because they came from Perfection and they went to corruption now and those sort of things and they're leaving and although I'm sure dreaming that maybe that they would still be have a chance at not dying and yet we find within seven generations there Rises up a man he did not die but the promise was that if you get back to the tree of life you live forever and here was a man that somehow something must have taken place and the beautiful thing is about the word of God and and those sort of things is that you know the the word of God was in the mind of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ from the foundations of the world and the Word was all there and not only that but the lamb now let me give you the lamb was slain from the foundations of the world so Enoch nonetheless prophesied being a prophet was able to tap into some kind of Revelation there and he knew that it was already finished even before it started and saints of God whereas we are as the prophet God would say he says we're waiting for that rapturing faith that we that rapsing Revelation as we see these things coming so and this might be a simple topic but I I really believe this is coming um rapidly as I was on a certain job site and uh we want to want to teach on and just kind of speak on this for a moment the the absolute and uh that's a very important topic and and it kind of got something got brought right to me I was in a in a Job trailer there a parts trailer there maybe we call like a tool crib or whatever and getting some material for my the thing that uh your dad told me to do I was working for your dad for a moment there and uh we were trying to uh find some locate some material and then here was another man there and he started striking up a conversation on cane seed line and yeah he looked at me and he's a fine gentleman a very kind and sweet and um he loves the Lord to the best he knows how and he mentioned something to me he says he's because I've I think we've spoken to him before on these things and he said Simon he says can a cane seed line make it to Heaven if they repent and I said well I said according to scripture you know God bless you according to scripture uh the only way someone can get to heaven is if they repent correct and I said well brother I said I've got a video for you you need to watch and we at home we just start making trying to help the help brother Justice work here in Akron making a uh and we did a servant Seed video and I sent that to him and this brother here he's a very Catholic very heavy Catholic uh they're waiting for the third revelation of the Fatima which is supposedly their secret the Catholic secret revelation of God blessed sisters of what is coming here and what is to be released to the Catholic church and to bring forth and Usher in something tremendous for them so uh they're waiting on those sort of things um so I had sent that video to them and I I it was a couple years or maybe a year or so plus I recorded that and I'd forgotten at the end that I had actually to I had brought forth the Catholic church and sort of those things at the end there and he comes up to me the next day and he said Simon and he was kind of right there and he said Simon you know you hammered the Catholic Church pretty heavy there and I said well brother I said did you look at St Peter's Basilica is that not built in the form of a serpent or a snake is it not crowned and then of course having my phone on me real quick I pulled up the audience Hall and I said what does this look like and he says that looks like the mouth of a of a snake I said exactly and that's directly right next to Saint Peter's Basilica as well so here we say we have two architectural buildings that were designed to look according to those sort of things I said brother no you've got to explain those things first and I think obviously the service seed study will clear up anything to do with eternal life and that seed line and as I mentioned John the Baptist said who has warned you to flee from the wrath of God and he said he said what did John the Baptist tell them I said he said bring forth fruits for repentance right amen so but as we're talking in there he mentioned something very interesting and he said he said Simon he says we've got to come together and I said what do you mean and he said and he brought forth this scripture right here now I remember where Tony Palmer had mentioned this and it was prophesied when in 1965 dealing with this thing he says remember this great thing would come he said the invitation will come to this great church and all these things and the whole world is going to be given this opportunity to come in and now notice what and the prophet of God broke this down saints of God this is not something that's mysterious this is right here this was not spoken in private this is not many times what when we first come in the message we use the church age book as just witnessing as a track we just gave it to people their dollar a piece and we just bought 100 or 200 at a time and just passed them out to wherever we met and what no that thing was what laying in here and he said he said what did God say he says I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon the world to try them which in other words there's a Temptation coming to give in right and as he said and the prophet of God broke it down by Revelation this is exactly how this is going to work he says the Temptation exactly like the Temptation Of Eden it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word but now notice what are they going to pull from they're going to pull from this right this was exactly what the prophet of God said he said he says now notice Christ said he says neither pray I for these alone but then for all true which also or which Shall Believe on me through their word he said that they may be one as thou father are to me and I and thee that they may also be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me right he says in the glory which thou gaveth me uh I have given them that they may be one even as we are one he said Simon he says we've got to come together and be one and as I stood there all these things are running through my mind the running now what was he using he was using the scripture he was using what the absolute and he brought forth this scripture and it's this obviously obviously these things are familiar in our minds why because these are very important indications these are pinpointed ways that the the prophet of God was by the spirit of God what was able to pinpoint this way that the way and the scripture and the way this thing was going to come about right and he you and it just blew my mind this man here would use the exact same scripture and I called him out I said brother now that is true in one sense but there's also another sense in which it's untrue even though it be the word of God but what I was like this what is the absolute right now notice what he says here he says and I told him and I and I almost buy the best my memory could handle is I tried to reiterate what this was being Spoken Here I said it'll be so enlightening so very right and life-giving as to fool the world and what are they going to use to fool the world he says uh only the very light will not be fooled the Temptation will come as follows the economical move I said saint I said brother I said this thing's going to come down to this and I asked him one question I said what is salvation what is Salvation And he says well it's in Jesus I said that's exactly right I said someone who is saved must be saved by who the Lord Jesus Christ and Christ Alone Now notice what are they going to say they're going to use this scripture he says that we might become one he says and it's going to look like what this is going to bring Salvation to the entire world but I said it I said now remember when this uh when this opportunity this this this decision time comes upon the face of the Earth that people will have to look at this we'll have to hear this and they're going to have to make a decision and they're going to think they're going to think in their minds that by joining up or entering into this Council or this economical move he says that that will be salvation to them but I told them I said it'll be Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ alone and that is it you cannot add or what take away right absolutely so though they're going to use the same scripture or pulled from what the very absolute of God uh um they're going to have the wrong interpretation right right now these things are done now of course uh in these in this instance here I was kind of uh kind of Blown Away by by this moment here and it made me think about going back to the absolute because now remember uh now let's just roll some scriptures here and let's look at what the word of God says he says now Heaven and Earth will pass away he says but my words shall not pass away right so what's the as we sat there in Lima one time and brother Brooks through this trick question you know and he said the scripture and he says where is the safest place in heaven on Earth or on God's word you know in me being a young Christian I was thinking wow man Heaven's Heaven's pretty safe if Jesus is up there but then it was revealed obviously he says but my word shall never pass away because because why heavens and earth shall be remade new amen sure uh they're going to change actually things are going to take a a renovation amen sure but the word of God stands silent now notice in Revelation 7 or John 17 16 he says he says they are not of this world even as I am not of this world sanctify them through thy truth he said what he says Thy word is true saints of God this is the absolute right the Bible is absolutely the true standard of this day and things of God if you go to any any house like this any sporting event uh I'll say like this if we had to pick in this if we had to pick in this assembly right here what would be the absolute of piano playing would it be young Malachi's it would be young uh lydias or Emmys or however you want to say it who well who who can play this better and who can play that better and this and this and we would maybe have a discussion and whatever and somebody vote for a brother of Malachi some might vote for Lydia or Emma or however you want to say it but something people say well there has to be an absolute the saints of God the I'll say like this who plays with us like this the anointing of the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost and is playing through that individual no matter what kind of talent or this and that if as long as the Holy Ghost playing I'll say that's an absolute amen because what we can do nothing without him Amen in everything we do whether in word or deed must be done in the name name of Jesus Christ amen and we want to pack and keep that anointing with us amen sure absolutely now notice this knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation just as they took this right here what does this mean what exactly is the interpretation is the interpretation of this is that at the end everything's going to be in Chaos on the earth and what then one man's going to rise up and try and solve all and we'll solve all the problems and he says we need a one-world church and a one world government and we need this and this and this and then hey let's join up is that the interpretation of what Christ is saying absolutely not that is not the interpretation see he says all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is profitable For What doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness what does the doctrine instruction and teaching reproof is to provide proof or conviction absolutely he says Corrections straightening up again or our reformations see all these things that's why we read the Bible that's why we believe the word because what these things keep us in the straight and narrow path amen sure he said not only and also for what instruction which is training and chastisement amen absolutely anybody ever get spanked by the Lord absolutely many many times here I have absolutely I'm very familiar with his the Lord's uh leather belt there maybe by God's grace yeah and he he swings hard and he loves it he loves you but it hurts then second Timothy uh 3 and 17 he says that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works that's why all this is for so what you may be perfect ready to do the very work or will of God absolutely sure amen now um so notice here now notice uh in second Peter 1 and 20 knowing this first and no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation there we have it he says for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but by holy men of God's fake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost now here's one thing I'll say this where the Catholic church has continued on they believe their early church fathers were also led to the Holy Ghost to what add their opinions and their scriptures and those sort of things and they count that as scripture actually their scripture is above what the holy Canon of God the holy red and that's that's exactly what but now if you study you at chinikui Charles shinikui he says they kept saying he's like well which which Scholars do we read which one's this he says they said what is is uh uh authorities his teachers his professors said read them all so what did Chinook we do China we read them all and he says and he come back to the professor he says none of them agree on anything so what is right and he said he says I was like no he says when I went into the library one time technically was given special privileges to watch the library over a break one time and he went into the section of what forbidden books and he's going to these secret forbidden books and lo and behold he finds one of these and his spiritual appetite was so hungry he says I must eat of this forbidden book and he started he went to them I'm sure it was a corner a dark looted and he fund made me a dark room a little bit little candle and got the whack the wick all trimmed and he lit it and turned the oil on got it going and he started reading the word of God and he said he says in those moments I felt such joy and peace and Harmony but he felt also conviction because he disobeyed his uh his leaders right so after that weekend or that break he went and confessed to the to the hierarchy there and they said what are you doing reading the Bible he said he says I don't know but after reading it I felt so clean and so pure he says and he asked him he says why is this in the Forbidden the books he said we don't need it when they say we don't need it he says well we have the holy church fathers to read and he said which one is right you know and they of course he could tell by what their response they have read them themselves they never read them and even though they didn't know how to answer him and he had put them on uh he had I was like this he had stopped their mouths for many times trying to find what was the truth now and dealing with this now what what we all know the Bible is the absolute that's absolutely correct I mean there's there's no doubt in our minds but I want to look exactly what the prophet of God said here as well he says now not trying I'm not trying to usurp Authority or something like that he says you see a man or anything with two heads in it but it doesn't uh know how to go God never give two heads to his church he never oh sorry about that uh he never uh um uh did it it's one head he always doubt in every generation and we studied through the scriptures there's always been one individual that he deals with because you get two of them he says you get two opinions and it has to come from one final absolute he says in my absolute is the word he says the Bible amen see so we see that the Lord the prophet God said his absolute was the Bible his standard was the scripture his standard was what the the revelation of this absolutely sure now he says it means just what it says the Bible says it's of no private interpretation if it says it it says it's black it's black and white is white that's just what it is it's the ultimate he says it's the absolute and every man that's born of the spirit of God is tied to that see now I love these quotes now whenever the prophet of God he ties the Holy Ghost of baptism or being born again or those sort of things to something we had better keep our eyes and Minds onto that amen praise me to God because what when he says that I believe the inspiration will strike because these are something that the spirit will feed on this is something he's pointing he says look at what the Holy Ghost loves look at what the spirit of God loves amen any what is the Holy Spirit what points to the Bible why because the Holy Spirit wrote this this is the Holy Ghost words right here this is his interpretation I was like this is his Revelation given to us absolutely I love that he says and no matter nothing will separate him from it he's tied to the word because it's Christ and Christ is the word and Christ cannot lie about his word for he is that word amen absolutely sure he said now notice here in the absolute he says and there's one star that never changed there's one thing that can never change that's God God cannot change so if God cannot change his word cannot change he says his Bible cannot change and if a man is born of the spirit of God with Christ in him see I love these quotes right here these are very important absolutely because what he's pointing what to the very spirit that wrote this the very spirit that was in Jesus Christ when Christ spoke what he only spoke what with the father gave him to speak absolutely and that is the Father's words amen that's the Holy Ghost words right there sure that is the creator the same one that spoke the tree and the land and the grass he said he also spoke this Bible into existence absolutely sure he says it punctuates every promise with an amen that is right certainly yeah I really I really love those quotes he says no now notice here now here's the danger because it's coming down to one final thing this is all coming down to one culmination of one choice and what do we do if you look uh and I I kind of hammered this a lot back home and uh sister Emma Nelly I'm sure heard this uh about almost in every service billerbrand blast organization he blasted every every sermon listen and see what he says about uh adding your own spin to something or your own interpretation to something or this or that and man's leadership outside the Holy Ghost just just listen to what he preached he says now he says Now Eve God bless you now when Eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word to denominations she rejects and commits fornications with the world of uh man's Wisdom rejecting the authority of the word of God see that's why we've got to walk tight to this amen if it's not in the scripture run from it if it's in the scripture then hold tight to it absolutely now if you don't now even if it's in the scripture we've got to want rightly divide these things amen and then then by the rightly dividing asking the holy spirit for leadership for guidance on how to what is he trying to convey here in this scripture what he's trying to say here in this passage right here in this chapter in this paragraph absolutely what Lord Jesus what are you trying to expressed to me today absolutely he said that sound clear and they said amen he said the Bible said committing spiritual fornications any word in the Bible That's rejected or if any uh self-interpretation is put to it it's absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the against the god that is your husband my I see so look at the careful walk we must walk we must what tread very Softly As we walk in this life in this land that we're living absolutely as we live by what the scripture absolutely sure now now why I kind of want to show you right here now notice how the prophet of God kept saying and there's many many quotes he's dealing with the Bibles the absolutely say the Holy Ghost is the absolute the Holy Ghost is the North Star the Bible is the North Star those are the typos and those sort of things he's always point to the word of God right but as we if we as we've seen uh many are leaning heavy on the words of the prophet and that and that's nice and those are very good like I like these quotes here and like we said here of the spirit of God and those sort of things but we've got to be careful when we listen to everything right absolutely when you listen to a study by me you better make sure I'm teaching from the scripture and bringing forth the correct Revelation right sure now why is this so important let's just give me a quick example is that okay and questions and answers will all born again Believers go in the rapture now don't don't read it don't read it let me ask you will born-again Believers go in the rapture yes I've got news for you obviously you guys don't have the revelation of the hour now this was in I believe in 64. we're all born again Believers go in the rapture no just the remnant now what if some young newbie hears the Revelation for the Malachi or when the sisters go out witnessing and uh uh brother Austin goes witnessing however and they said hey come hear the word come here the message I already come here and they're like wow this is amazing and they they get the they get the message app whatever they say man but who's going to make the Rapture and they type it in and this quote comes up and he's like hmm so what's the difference and that's where he needed to call Pastor Jesse or really get into prayer fasting now no knows what the prophet God he says no just the remnant just the remnant not all born again Believers what he says and the Bible said and the rest of the Dead live not a thousand years and they that was raised and separated the sheeps and it goes not all not all he says it three times but every every word be established by twos and Friends he says not all born again will go into according to scripture well is that is that true we know the prophet was probably thinking about a million different things and we we know exactly what he did he did he didn't say it correctly right absolutely now remember he struggled early in the 60s about being born again and uh being the new birth and although he thought they were separate things but if you search at the last thing he gave us was what the church age book in that church age book it's revealed that the being born again and being converted and those sort of things being baptized with the Holy Ghost for one and the same absolutely but Jesus said you must be born again to enter in the kingdom of God now look at this now listen let me tell you how crazy this looks you read that completely not true the very next the very next question what is the evidence that a person is really filled with the Holy Ghost what is the evidence of the person filled with the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost has come he will show you things that come see he'll be perfect man-mades won't do it he is the word and when he and the Holy Ghost is come he will identify himself with you in the scripture and that is the true sign of the holy spirit because it is the word and yet before he was unable to identify the scripture the true interpretation of the scripture so the brother Graham have the Holy Ghost makes you well to the to the to the new ones they would be a I wonder okay that was wrong and then now he's saying he doesn't have it so what's the absolute the word of God absolutely see it man can go off the seventh angel messenger could go off just for a break now he could get right back the next question and hit it perfect absolutely absolutely and I didn't I didn't get the chance to search this I don't know if the Holy Ghost corrected him later or not or whatever sometimes the holy he said no he said something feels wrong and no no the Holy Ghost is correcting me what did I say something wrong is he he doesn't say that later on so even the spirit of God did not correct that now notice here what is the main thing here at the same time came the disciples under Jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and Jesus called a little child on them to set him in the midst and said verily saying to you except you be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven is that not what the scripture says what is being converted what what means what being born again receiving getting filled with the Holy Ghost getting baptized with fire all those sort of things and now notice what Jesus also said Jesus in John 3 says Jesus answers into verse saying to you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now what's the interpretation of this he cannot see the kingdom of God forever I was saying to you except the man be born of water in the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh and that was born of the spirit is Spirit see see the difference here there's a night and day difference right here looky here first faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God and then the believer hears it recognizing acts on it the carnal man would hear it and sat like this here well here the sound of it but never here means to understand it look at it accepting uh looking at something but but to but to see it is to understand it except the man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God now this is where so except the man be born again he cannot understand or see or understand the kingdom of God now this is very important here being born again guarantees you number one the rapture but it also guarantees you the understanding of what the spirit would have to say in the scripture dealing with what not only your day but all the days before that have come and gone sure and especially in this day and when so much Revelation was given to us absolutely sure now let's continue on here I want to I want to show you this um and this is where I think a lot of things I hear so many things going off and it makes me so uh nervous now notice here this is the laosian church age and notice what the what the Bible Jesus said there in Matthew or sorry in Revelations 3 he says and anointing eyes with eyes sad that thou mayest see the same thing that wasn't being born again he says and he does not say that you have to buy this as I say have no sir there is no price tag to the Holy Spirit he says he says receiving the Spirit by The Works law by hearing of Faith Galatians 3 2. he says without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never have your eyes open to the true spiritual revelation of the absolute now this is the absolute but it takes the Revelation to understand the absolute amen thousands and thousands of millions of people have read this Bible but but because they've never been born again they've never been able to enter into the true revelation of what this was and that comes by what being led being taught by the Holy Ghost amen absolutely he says a man without the spirit is blind to God and his true how many of you got family members friends who go to church and yet they can still not see the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the only difference between us and Them is that what God has taken we have what entered and received the baptism the Holy Ghost and what God has opened these things up the very importance of it absolutely now let's continue on here in Revelations 2 3 here they had the ear now this is just uh I just found this uh this year actually this this thought and it just cleared so much up for me it really helped me I've stated this before I believe it was here and at home in in Revelations two and three seven carnal men were sent and Holy Ghost filled men at the same time the Holy Ghost filled new creatures but still had that carnal nature they're still men they were still sinned and battle those things just like us we're what the uh the similar nature still battling these things right here the effects of the world battling demons but battling Satan himself those sort of things but when it came down to the last part of every Church age it says what he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit of saith in the churches there's not one Church age where this verse is not mentioned so this is when Jesus said verily verily or he'd say John John or Peter Peter he was what trying to draw some attention with what repetition amen but now here God in the Holy Ghost God himself Jesus Christ is saying what he that hath and here he says that seven times ma he says this seven times he the hath an ear he sent one one Angel out and at the end of the Angel's message you say he that has an ear hear what the spirit said understand what the spirit saith unto the churches this is just this has been new to me this this thought right here has been new I've been chewing on this for about a year now every single age has the same same admonition to the people of every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith but it is an absolute but it's absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit goes for the prophet so through the Angels what the angel says or what the spirit says he says what the spirit says to the different ages and directly after this the prophet of God brings out four scriptures he ties us to four scriptures what is the interpretation what is the Revelation between what of he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches what does that mean what does it mean hear what the spirit saith unto the churches what does that mean and then when I read this scripture here's the four scriptures he uses right here First Corinthians 2 6-16 Matthew 13 13 through 16 John 8 42 John 8's obviously a heavy hitter uh 42-44 and John and Matthew 16. 17. this is the difference everything is coming down to this who goes in the Rapture all that are born again if you are born again you're going up amen absolutely if you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost you're going up if you become what a new creature in Christ you're going up if you've been converted what you are going up absolutely if you received a new birth if you have Christ and you living and while you are sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are going to make this rapture I just listed you five things you can do to make the Rapture now notice but I love what this says he the hath and ear let him hear what the spirit say it how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the prince of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery so the the wisdom of God is a mystery you can't figure it out it takes one the Holy Ghost to open these things up to be a revelation a revelation is something like uh it'll just strike and it's just like whoa I've never seen that and it draws you it actually becomes I was like this they used to feed the the children potatoes and and steak and meat and all that what because they say it what sticks to your bones but you get a revelation that thing actually sticks to you you'll be working and all of a sudden it'll come right back up when you start thinking about it and thinking about it thinking about you're like my Lord that is so powerful thank you Jesus amen he says not not yet yet not the wisdom of the world nor the prince of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery even the hidden wisdom which was for which was uh which God ordained before the world to unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew but hey if or had they had known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory and he goes on he says but God is revealed to us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things now what was revealed by who revealed it the spirit of God revealed it now here we go this is beautiful for what man knoweth the things of man saved the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God to catch the correct revelation of the word of God and the placement of where we are in this day in this hour it will take a direct revelation of God right now where are we are we 18 20 years away from the Rapture are we 100 years from Rapture are we right on the cusp of this thing I believe the Holy Ghost will what show us these things and is showing us these things now we have now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given unto us of God the only way you can receive free things or free Revelations or these the Salvation uh this leadership is what is if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is only it you can go sit under the greatest teacher or preacher in this message right now and not catch a thing you'll hear it and it'll go it won't even matter because it all depends on the spirit right there the spirit of the Holy Ghost he says which things we also speak not in the words of man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teaches there we go who's the teacher here it is the Holy Spirit comparing spiritual things with spiritual but notice what he says in verse 14 he says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God this is what makes me wonder so much about as uh I'm sure you know the uh I do have you I push heavy on those uh the Deeds of Nicolaitans the doctrine Nicolaitans balamism and then Jezebel those are very very important things to catch the revelation of he says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judge us all things yet he himself is Judge of no man for hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have but he says but what we have the mind of Christ amen and say to God if you have the mind of Christ and what the spirit of God has Abode Abode with you and you've abided with him what he's going to show you and lead and guide you into all true absolutely now in a hole in the hole putting these verses together we see that there is only one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age but when I've heard this message saints of God how many message Believers have fallen away well when you hear this message you've heard from geophany how many have fallen away that doesn't make any sense it's always been what a there was a Revival in the 40s 50s and 60s and there's always been twins and there's always been a church called out of a church it's going coming down to what individuals amen who are what want to be sold out fully moving what is his brother Jesse said moving into the book of Acts and Performing those things amen sure he says uh and that'll be a very special group people are able to hear what the spirit says in each age it is one special it is one special group that receives the Revelation for each age he says that group is of God because the group cannot hear he says because the group that cannot hear of God that group that can find and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the Revelation thereof is that group described in First Corinthians 2 16-18 see very very powerful and this is what worries me people are saying the message is the absolute there's not one quote yes I'm here found a quote where it said Bill Graham said the message is the absolute so they're not saying what the prophet said they're not saying what Malachi 4 said they're not saying that the problem show me the quote I just typed in last night I couldn't find anything you know what he continually said he said the Bible is the absolute he said the Holy Ghost was the absolute this is dangerous danger Russ get your Bibles out here let's go to John 6. remember this this is coming into play here's the Revelation I don't have this I'm just kind of pulling this right here I don't have this on my notes in John 6. now these were believers whenever they come looking for Jesus Jesus crossed over the sea and they crossed notice they went through Great Lengths to find him disciples crossed Jesus crossed they're on the other side of this this body of water and they're like where's Jesus the Bible said they've gotten ships and went and found him that that costs that was a sacrifice now notice verse 25 John 6 25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi whence came as thou hither Jesus now notice he calls him out exactly calls him out Jesus answered them very very saying to you ye seek me not because ye saw the Miracles but but because you were fit you'd eat the Loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which pairs us for uh but for that meat which endures unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed then said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answers unto him this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefore unto him what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what does thy Work did not Jesus just feed them in a miracle fed thousands and multitudes and yet they still did not believe this was God or of God and yet then they great made huge sacrifice they pushed and crossed and paid a fee and had to who knows what that was could have been dangerous back then traveling over that sea and however whatever now notice what did they say next in 31. our fathers did eat Manna in the desert as it is written notice they quote scripture he gave them bread from Heaven to eat now what did now that was scripture right they pulled from the absolute but what was the Revelation behind it oh they had the word of God they knew the word of God but what was their interpretation of that scripture when it says when it says what he who's he Jesus called them out what did Jesus say Jesus said to him very I said to you Moses gave you not that bread even though they used the scripture when they said he gave us bread from Heaven they were talking about Moses the prophet of God the prophet did this and the prophet did this let me tell you something Jesus Christ has done everything if that was not true why would the prophet at the end of his age says man I haven't done one thing for the Lord Brother Brandon you better get busy and he went back on the field absolutely why because who like I'll never forget brother Jessica's preaching and said who gave you that breath in your in your lungs and your in the air in your mouth to breathe God gave that to you you're sitting here breathing through your nostrils in your mouth who gives you the ability to breathe right now and keep your keep yourself alive can you do it no it's the Holy Ghost God himself forgives life and he takes life Jesus called them out he says he says Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you that true bread from Heaven amen praise be to God look at that he discerned now notice it took what a discernment of the father to call it out Jesus said oh that's a good scripture and he didn't move on no he called it out well I'll just some people say well I just got to cover their sins and this yeah and sometimes when it seems to God there's a time when you got to call it out amen you got to call Sin Sin that's the wrong interpretation of that scripture amen [Applause] I'm sure I'm sure Jesus's disciples could say wow they he they use the scripture that's that's he gave them bread from Heaven absolutely they knew they know their litters they know who they know who deals but but Jesus knew their thoughts and intents and what they meant amen they were leaning that entire feeding of the word what on the prophet of God or that that man it was on to the prophet Moses ah absolutely he says they are the ones who have the spirit of God they're the ones that are born of God they are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit they are baptized with the Holy Ghost amen absolutely now let's see here let's continue on here he says now notice here in the Smyrna Church age he says to further bring out what we've just said is also the scriptures that should be born in mind as we talk about who it is that baptized that is baptized with the Holy Ghost we see what Jesus says in John 6 it is written in the prophets that they shall all be taught of God the only way you can have the Lord Jesus Christ teach you is if you want you have been born again of the Holy Spirit that is when the teacher himself then begins revealing and showing you what the spiritual aspects of many many things he says he says now but turn to Isaiah 54 13 went forth this is taken and it reads and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and and the the all of God are the children of God he says thus it is that evidence of being a true child of God he whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one is taught by the word by taught the word by the Holy Ghost the revelation I'll say it like this and my pastor cam had said something back home and it was teaching on a certain subject and Yoni said he said and that subject to that subject matter was in The Book of Revelations he goes what's the name of that book again [Laughter] the revelation of Jesus Christ so before Jesus ascended he did not have the revelation of anything in the Book of Revelation but what does it say in Revelations 1 1 . uh let's just read that real quick I want to read that Revelations 1 1. where did Jesus have to get the Revelation from this was completely hid what in the father the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him are we reading that correct so even the perfect one the sinless one the Spotless lamb had to wait from Revelation had to wait what was the Revelation everything contained in this in this book right here revelation this is a so if this is a book of Revelation therefore the only way to understand that book would be by what revelation why listen to the I listened to seals one and one through seven and I read the church age book but do you have the revelation of what was being said there you can read it I'll tell you what I read it was not until the third time I read that church age book did I catch the revelation of the Deeds of Nicolaitans it laid there and I called my pastor and guess what he was hot on the same Trail reading that tree and I said brother did you read this he just yes I said what about this he's yes I said me too I said this is crazy he says yes absolutely I said why did we see this before I said I don't know what's going on here I don't know I'm not sure let's continue reading okay because now we're seeing for the first time for me five years ago I started seeing what the Antichrist Spirit would do in little form in the original Church what was what was the spirit that made the church cold formal and Powerless it was the Antichrist Spirit through those deeds and just that little bit of getting away from the true Revelation the true revelation of the church just that little bit of getting away from what the pastors what the Bishops were supposed to really be doing what they were what their job was getting away from that caused the entire fall from the book of Acts that's clear as day absolutely clear as day this is a serious matter I don't even I will never forget when those things jumped out in my my eyes and I believe was like a form of I said just that's the problem because when I was in denomination you know really just actually left it uh don't tell me God before I did what was it what was what was the reason about Jess tongues tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost why why did you leave brother because it's not the Everest of the Holy Ghost he said he said so I came he said I can't agree with this I was like okay you know and me I was just kind of I was just fighting for Jesus I wasn't even caring about doctor at the time and just as a student doctor and he's like oh I gotta go I was like I was like okay but the Lord brought us all back together amen just grew up you know just always grew a little faster than me if you notice by now all right so and a little bit longer too absolutely sure natural perfectly now now he was the revelation it wasn't until a year or maybe a little less later that I catch Revelation that man that that is not correct correct and you know what the feeling I got for the just left and I started seeing things wrong I said there's something wrong here I started praying in the closet and when the Lord started you know what I in the uh the middle 2000 teens right there the same feeling came about me and said something's wrong in this message what is it and I jumped back in the church age book and there it was laying right there and I believe was the same Holy Ghost leading us further out of the desert further out of what denomination and figure out the organization I'll say it like that organizational Spirits absolutely sure same feeling and what did God do he just opened it up and cracked it open and said there it is I see the quotes we took the quotes Dove back into the absolute found here found here diatropius trifests or whatever they're this and this and this and this and how how uh diotrophes would not even allow John to come and preach because he wanted more of the preeminence oh wait John the disciple Jesus loves John the one that penned four what five books or four books in the Bible then just to subscribe to the last one I say like that or scribe to Five I'll silly thank you Lord that man the one to walked with him the one that laid in the bosom of Jesus at the Last Supper and they didn't want him to come preach oh my something was wrong my what kind of a mentality what kind of attitude was that man under delusion I was like a strong delusion he said now you can begin to see why tongues is not there you go evidence of the being baptized with the Holy Ghost it does not say in any age that he that hath a tongue let him say what the spirit is saying notice notice what he said he that has a tongue let him say what the spirit saith or does it say he that hath the uh the the angel say what the Angels saith don't say that he that hath an ear hear with the angel doesn't say hear what it doesn't hear what the Angels said to say that he says hear what the spirit says that puts tongues interpretation thereof and prophecy Etc aside as the evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking yes to the spirit is teaching amen amen see you've got to always take everything back to the scripture and then ask the Holy Ghost to for a full revelation of it sure now I'm at literally almost right before one hour here so give me a little bit longer here by God's grace he says in this Revelation he tells us what the now notice what why why is the Book of Revelation so important I was like this why are the four bugs important why are the four horse riders important why are the deeds and the claytons the the doctrines this doctors that why are those so important why do I blast those all the time look at this have you ever noticed how Satan hates two book of two books of the Bible more than all the others what's he what is what is evolution is a direct opposition to the book to Genesis 1 1. they're standing there teaching children the one of the greatest lies ever taught and they get them pumped up with all this space stuff and this and that and there's life out here there's life their Bible says there's only all living came from Eve that's a simple scripture have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than others through liberal theologians there it is and pseudoscientists there it is he is always attacking the Book of Genesis and Revelation why we know why he attacked Genesis but why would he take revelation the last book in both these books we find Satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction well we know in Genesis is is origin is this where what is the origin in the Book of Revelation because remember there's Shadow and type the first bride fell the second bride fell by what Deeds of the Nickelodeon that is the revelation and then on and on and on one defilement of the wife brought forth what twins and then what came forth next a disagreement a fight in the field or the world and then what a Slaughter and then then comes what the mark of the beast it shows the origins Old Testament New Testament Origins and they're one and the same and God and Satan hates it so much that his what his actions and deeds are exposed and they're brought forth right and here in this they are age you know no other age knows what those things are no other age go on YouTube and just type in the deeds and the claytons hey the the Apostle or the the Nicholas or this and this or there was another group or this tribe or that tribe it goes it's insane we have the true revelation that is why he attacks them he hates to be what exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is Jesus said about Satan he has no part of me and I have no pardon him he says the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the world he destroys what confidence in the word but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation believes the spiritual revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her now why does he hate a revelation why isn't he so against Revelation it is because the entire Canon of God's word and God's church is soundly built upon revelation once we understand by spiritual Revelation what this is and what this is and what can this do we know in the scripture how to rightly divide it and we can find it here we can find it there we can find it here and this and what now it rings true that Revelation oh well brother uh brother brahm's absolute was uh or the rebel the absolute is the message well I'll say like this how do we know the prophet's Revelation was correct because he proved it and he ran it from Genesis to how many times I take this thing from genes to Revelation Revelation Genesis Genesis Revelation he brought all the way through he preached a thinking man's filter you can't bring a lie all the way through the scripture or the absolute see this thing's written this is a mystery book all right let me let me just jump we're going into 105 here let's let's jump I want to jump to something here and I want to show you something here you know this is very important here I have to dedicate more of my life to this more of my energy spiritual rewards storing up spiritual a treasure right here okay you read and take feed the Holy Ghost right now let me show you something here look at this now if there is an absolute if there is absolutely if there was a standard so important to God and there was something so precious to God and this was the only way to him and to eternal life would not he protect it he would put fire around about it he would put everything that if you go past this you're dead you're in big trouble people will miss eternity because of these things right here adding notice if any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book now this is November what was it the book of the Bible the revelation of it the revelation of the Bible well brother the Bible says this yeah but what does it mean what is the correct Revelation add anything to the revelation of Jesus Christ which covers the entire scripture the whole Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ it is it is it is he says and if any man shall take away take away from the words of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things which are written this book how important is this very very important this proves right here the Bible is the absolute because this is also recorded what I believe in Psalms or in Proverbs and also in Deuteronomy 4 the exact same thing is spoken now notice have you ever seen some of these brothers here that have dealt with Bible translations the living Bible by Kenneth Taylor the popular press May note of author Kenneth Taylor's loss of ability to talk Time Magazine 1972 mysteriously halfway through the fair paraphrase they must have been speaking with them interviewing Taylor lost his voice and still speaks in a horse whisper this is the guy that rewrote the Bible a psychiatric psychiatrist who examined him suggested that the veil The Voice failure was Taylor's psychological self-punishment for tampering with what he believed to be the word of God hmm a new version oh let's read new versions of the Bible God took away his ability to speak New American Standard Version also silence was Philip shaft collaborator of the new Greek committee and the director of American Standard Version which formed the foundation for The New American Standard Version he says and the living Bible paralleling Taylor's pathology shaft's son found the same frog in Philip Sharp's throat even as early as 1854 as a warn warning was given his voice was so affected that he could not speak in public as so to be heard finally by 19 or 1892 the power of articulation speech was gone adding and taking away from the scripture how many billions of people have read this version and missed it how many billions have read that Bible the living Bible and missed it 19 or 1893 still as his buddy would say he was derived from the power of speech up in Pride to his death could not speak new Greek Testament new Greek texts shaft himself writes uh uh SP whatever that is often the new Greek text which proceeded and strongly influenced the Westcott and revision of tregolis uh Chef writes he was certainly scarce able to speak audibly so once again here another record saying this man lost his ability to speak Russ got horse westcott's biography cites that in 1854 he was quite inaudible and by 1970s voice reached few and understood by even still fewer God is not playing around with these these men are in grave danger the Bible Jesus would say danger of Hellfire how many books how many words in the Book of Revelation in the Revelation Jesus Christ that they change and then when they change a word changed its meaning or revelation that's how careful we are to be carrying the word of God this is history this isn't even this ain't the message this is just history right here all history right there recorded B.J Phillips tells in his own biography the New Testament in Modern English he's the author of The whatever that new version of Bible I was still doing a fair measure of speaking in schools intrusions until the late summer of 1961 then sudden then quite suddenly my speaking writing and communication powers stopped notice many many men who've tampered with the word of God in revelation God took their ability to speak if you mess with God's words he's going to mess with your I was not in panic but I was certainly alarmed and then a few weeks rest brought no improvement I canceled all speaking engagements for the rest of the year age 55 the success of the price of success the title of autobiography the price of success was that Godly success was that the kingdom of God's success or was it the success what of a worldly man amen an unconverted natural man trying to handle something that's what's spiritual was he did he hear the spirit say what the spirit said to the churches not even close he didn't have to hear all he had to do was read the end of Revelation and he would have had the warning but he read past it he did not take heed he did not take it now notice most of these things take place what after the fact they did not realize what they were doing in fact he continued what teaching in schools and in churches he thought he was doing the will of God and then when judgment Struck it was too late the speech was uh Sphinx syndrome can be happening can happen even to a Believer and I notice they try and bring it back to the scripture but remember Zacharias will smoke what a dumb because what he disbelieved the word of God oh my there it is man now hmm interesting huh let's stand here by God's grace Malachi 2 10. having another one father hath not God created us all that's what they're saying we're all one we all believe the same God why do you deal treacherously with every man against his brother by profaning the Covenant of our fathers Judah hath dealt freshly and an Abominations committed in Israel and in Jerusalem for Judah professed or sorry profane the Holiness of the Lord which he loved and has married the daughter of estranged God sounds like denomination sounds like Trinity sounds like who knows what you want to say it the Lord will cut off the man that doeth this the master and The Scholar you start profaning or doing things contrary to the word of God he'll even cut the master and the scholar off it does not matter do you have the revelation of Jesus Christ amen as we all have a it's kind of got just a little little short little study there just on the absolute I hope you're able to see the importance of the sincerity uh the Holiness and reverence we must approach with reading the word of God and making a judgment call on the word you know even Christ himself had an absolute what was Christ's absolute he was he was led like a lamb God used him for three years and then they come down to one final final moment he knew his Destiny was to die for a sacrifice for all Humanity right you know the prophet of God said Jesus Christ looked at one scripture and had faith in it and this became his absolute the prophet God said he says and Jesus come to that moment he said and he had one absolute he spoke with one scripture what that God was faithful what he says for he will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer my Holy One to see corruption and Christ held on to that and about the fourth day Christ when the Holy Ghost came down the spirit of God came down and resurrected the sun resurrected that body what and what he right now he becomes what the Lord of lords and King of Kings amen what God now changes permanent residence in his body God in flesh Lord amen and when a woman goes out and lives with another man or a man with another woman when they're married to them they are defiling their own flesh and when a person says that he is a Christian and will absolutely deny the scripture being right you say the message the scripture the revelation of the scripture he's committing adultery against the body that he claims to be in see it's it's it's a mark of the Antichrist so much that we're deceive the elect if possible so let's say a word of Prayer let's just raise our hands and think on these things Tommy would say we just want to follow the lord better and better lore though earthquakes may happen fire may run Ablaze this may happen
