TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Right? That was the logos. And then brother Ram said the first thing God made after he created a body for his son uh the light would have been angels. &gt;&gt; So the very first throne would have been the throne in heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right? And then you would have had Lucifer and Michael right there. Right? You would have had uh throne guards as we'd say or archangels. All the angels of God would have worshiped him. Then God would have created the universe and then he created the earth. Right? And the Bible said all the angels sang, the sons of God sang and clapped and shouted for joy. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the earth uh had its foundation, hallelujah. But then uh you know God created man on the earth and the Bible said there was two trees in the garden. Now you and I know they weren't literal trees like that. &gt;&gt; I'm just putting that up there because that's what most people think. And brother Chris and I did a Bible study about two weeks ago and and he caught on to it. you know, he caught on to the fact that uh the serpent was offering Eve another way to eternal life, right? Because she already had access to the tree of life. There's only one kind of life, that's eternal life. &gt;&gt; So, uh the serpent was offering her another way to have eternal life, but there's only one way to eternal life. It's not by eating apples or oranges. It's by faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is by faith, right? In God. Hallelujah. By we're saved by grace through faith. Hallelujah. So this is the first throne we'd say on the earth. Praise God. And you know, church, God then has always had a spiritual throne in the heavens. Hallelujah. He's always had one. And he's always going to have one until the very end, &gt;&gt; till the future home, the new Jerusalem. Okay. Now, uh what I want to say too is that the Bible says God is omnipotent, which means all powerful. So if God has all power, that means God's spirit can be wherever it wants to be. God's spirit can be in as many places as at at a time as possible. He knows all things. He He knows what's going to happen in the future, right? He He's the beginning and the end. Praise God. He's the first and the last. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He already knows what's going to happen because he's eternal. Praise God. And so it it doesn't stumble us to know that God's spirit can be on his throne in heaven and he can also have his spirit enthroned on earth. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So that won't stumble us. Now to a new Christian that might stumble them. They might in other words they they might think when Jesus was on earth, you know, heaven was bankrupt. Impossible. &gt;&gt; Jesus could have the fullness of the Godhead in him which meant all power and all authority. And yet God's spirit could be on the throne in heaven. That doesn't stop God. Hallelujah. You can't stop God with location. God created locations. That means he's outside of locations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. Doing pretty good for a start. Everybody with me? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, if I get to a spot where you don't understand, I'm going to hold this up because Jen, this is the one Genevieve made. So, if you don't understand something, I'll give you a reminder here. Okay, Jen. Whoops. Did I accidentally click it? Okay. All right. Now, now you just got a little outline here. I'm going to start with Old Testament thrones, New Testament thrones, heavenly throne, and then I'll close with brother Ram's two great revelations on the throne of God. Okay? So, I'm going to go kind of quick because I got a YouTube video on this. If you want uh if you want a full teaching on it, you can go through there or just go slow. Take notes here tonight and go, you know, read them when you get home. Does everybody understand? By God's grace, I'm just going to go kind of quick just for time sake. And I got some visuals here uh by the grace of the Lord. Okay. So the first throne on earth was the garden of Eden, the tree of life. Hallelujah. Uh and then you know uh after sin, right? We know what happened. God walked in the cool of the evening, right? God walked down in the garden to try to find Adam and Eve from hiding. Okay? Uh and then we know there that then the uh that throne just became a little different, right? In other words, uh the throne was now guarded by cherubam. So Adam and Eve couldn't get back into the throne. &gt;&gt; Before they sinned, they had access to the tree of life, the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But after sin, now notice what God do. God put a guard for the throne of God. And now you're going to see this all throughout the rest of the history. God always has guards around his throne. &gt;&gt; When you see those rich people, what do they got? Bodyguards. &gt;&gt; What What does the president got? Bodyguards, &gt;&gt; right? What do you got? Bodyguard. Amen. The angel of the Lord and camps around those that fear God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I send Malachi off in the morning, I say, "Lord Jesus, let your angels be around him." Right? Protect him. That's hard for me. It's my son leaving. You know, he's leaving off in a full-time job. And so I said, "Lord, let your guards be on him." Hallelujah. Just like my mom did for me. She sent me off to Aker and dropped me off and let the angels of God protect him. They have. Hallelujah. Thank God. The angel of the Lord. But after sin, you know, God still would meet with individuals. He met with Cain in Genesis 4. He met with Noah in Genesis 6. Uh God came down in Melzdc and met with Abraham in Genesis 14. God met with Abraham in a vision. in Genesis 15 in a flesh body. In uh Genesis 18, he appeared to Isaac. In Genesis 26, he appeared to Jacob in a latter dream. In Genesis 28, and then God wrestled with uh Jacob in a theophony form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry. It would have been a Theophony covered with flesh. Sorry. Yeah. Would have been a Theophony covered with flesh. Kind of like uh kind of kind of like Melzdc. Uh and God let Jacob prevail. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's Genesis 32. And then God appeared to Jacob again in Genesis 35 when he came back to the promised land. Hallelujah. And then church, uh, the one you're familiar with, and I wish some of our younger believers were here tonight, but that's okay. They can, uh, hopefully catch us later. And then we, as our text read in Exodus 32, uh, 25, God desires to dwell with his people. And God said, I'm going to dwell in one place. I'm going to dwell right upon this lid here called the mercy seat. Now, that word the the English word for the Hebrew word is propitiation. That's the same word. That's where we get the word propituation from. The Hebrew word mercy seat. Right? So, what's the propitiation? That's where the blood was poured out, right? That it means taking the wrath away. &gt;&gt; So, Jesus was our propituation. Jesus suffered the wrath so we could be forgiven and saved. Hallelujah. Amen. The good news of the gospel. Hallelujah. And God said, "I'll meet with you there, Moses. I met I met I'll meet with Aaron there as well." When Aaron would go in once a year, hallelujah. And so, this is now God's throne on earth. Hallelujah. Makes sense. Uh here's another uh illustration. I like the other one better, you know, but it's a good Well, at least we get the blood here. We get the picture of the blood, right? He would dip the blood and sprinkle the blood. Remember, seven times before the door and then he take he would put blood on all the horns of of the brazen altar and then altar of incense and all the wind. He take it all the way. The blood had to be in all three courts. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the Holy Ghost has got to be on all three phases of your life. &gt;&gt; Body, spirit, soul. Hallelujah. The life of God. But now look, these cherubams here are throne guards. So God is again showing what he does. He always guards his presence. &gt;&gt; Right? So here the throne guards guarding the presence of God. Now God doesn't need guards, &gt;&gt; but he still has them because it represents power and authority, but we need guards. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy. Hallelujah. To guard us. Now, if you trace the ark down through the Bible, and if you got your Bibles, go to Jeremiah 3:16. Malachi, can you get it? You got your Bible there? Maybe you can read it, Malachi. Um, if you trace the Ark of the Covenant through the kings, right, you know, it was with Moses before the kings, right? Uh, and then it was with Joshua. Joshua carried it into battle. Praise God. He carried it. He used it to cross the Jordan River, which had been overthrown. And then in the days of Judges, they had the ark of the covenant, right? It was at Shiloh in Judges 20:27. And then the days of Eli the priest and Samuel the prophet. It was in Shiloh. Then it went to Phil Filistia, right? Philistia, sorry. And then it went after after it tortured them, right? &gt;&gt; The spirit of God will always torture sinners. I shouldn't say torture, but chasing them, right? Rebuke them. Then it went to uh Kirjath Jereim and it blessed that man. Hallelujah. And then David brought it up. Hallelujah. To the house. I'm sorry. David brought it up uh not to it was to uh Mariah. I'm sorry. I got my I forgot my Zion and Mariah. David brought it up to Mariah and he danced before the ark. Praise God. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. And then Solomon placed it in the temple that he built, this magnificent, beautiful temple in First Kings chapter 8. And then it was with all the kings. The last king it's recorded with is Josiah in 2 Chronicles 35:E5. It's the sec. It's the last mention of the ark with the king. Now, there's all kind children, just so, you know, there's all kinds of people say they found the ark. Well, let's prove it. Nobody's been able to prove it yet. Okay? And church, don't worry. And children, don't worry about finding the physical ark. Just make sure you're the spiritual ark of God. &gt;&gt; Just make sure this is your heart. Okay? &gt;&gt; What's the next one I got? Okay. Yeah. So, again, we can see the the the setup here of Moses's. Of course, this turned into Solomon's temple and so forth. Then Zerubbabel's temple. Hallelujah. Uh but the last mention is with Josiah, one of the final uh few kings of Judah before all Israel was dispersed. It's the last mention. Okay. Now, Malachi is going to read. I want you to listen to Jeremiah 3:16. It's a beautiful verse here. Go ahead, Malachi. Amen. So Jeremiah prophesies that there's going to come a time when they don't even think about the ark. When is that? When is Israel not going to think about the ark, church? After they receive Christ. After the 144,000 are sealed, right? And after the millennium starts. They're not going to need an ark because they got the presence of God already. They have the body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. All right. Now, what I got next? Okay. Now, this was just for the the newcomers like brother Chris and so forth. Uh we'll just get into that in a little bit, I guess, with the How many How many How many remember that picture? Remember that picture? &gt;&gt; So, the the tribes were placed in groups of three on four sides. It makes a cross. Hallelujah. So, when God looked down from heaven, he saw a cross. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The only way my people my people should live in a cross we should stay connected to the cross of Jesus Christ, right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then each of those uh four groups had a banner, right? And uh the banners were uh these four there was lion, ox, flying eagle, and a man. Okay, they each had their uh each had their representative, right? Okay. Now, let's see where we at next. Okay, now we get in the New Testament. Okay. So, uh, before I get to that, now let's transition to the New Testament. I didn't get a time, but I I could have put a picture of the body of Jesus up here because Jesus was the next throne of God, right? The Bible said in Colossians 2:9 that in Jesus dwelt the fullness of the Godhead body. Let's all say fullness, can we? Fullness. &gt;&gt; So, all of God's power, all of God's authority dwelt in the body of Jesus. It dwelt there. Remember the Bible said in John chapter 1, what did the Bible say? The spirit descended and then what? Remain. That's a let's all say remain. Ready? Remain. So the spirit just didn't come down and leave. What did it do? It dwelled. So what what's what's the word dwelling again? Dwelling means seat. Dwelling means throne. &gt;&gt; So the spirit of God was enthroned in the body of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, after Jesus died, resurrected, and ascended, what did he send down on the day of Pentecost? What'd he send down? The Holy Ghost, the spirit of God. And the spirit, did it leave the people or did it stay in them? &gt;&gt; It stayed. So now they have a permanent anointing. They didn't have it before, but now they got a permanent anointing in the New Testament in the soul. Hallelujah. And that's why the Bible says that now we are the temple of the Holy Ghost. So, if we're a temple, we got to have a throne. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, you're familiar with that. I'm just going to read them. 1 Corinthians 3:16 and 1 Corinthians 6:19 both say, "Don't you know your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost?" That's why we sang the song tonight because I was praying and thinking about, well, what songs would fit right here. I thought holy, holy, holy would fit because that's what the four beasts say, right? That's what they say. Got the lion, ox, man, eagle. They say holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty. But now remember church uh the Holy Ghost is in your soul according to John 7 38-39 Colossians 1:26 and 28 speaks of Christ in you the hope of glory. Now that verse is very important uh because it says Christ is the glory right Christ in you the hope of glory and the Bible said that the Messiah's rest would be glorious. Okay let's read that. It's Isaiah 11 verse 10. Isaiah 11 verse 10. How am I doing on time? Okay, got about 25 minutes. Okay, really good. All right, doing good on time. Now, if you got it, let's read it out loud here. Uh, let's read Isaiah 11:10. Ready? 1 2 3. And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an end sign of the people. to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be &gt;&gt; glorious. The Gentiles are going to seek after the rest of the Messiah and it's going to be glorious. Christ in you the hope of &gt;&gt; glory and that's the mystery that the Gentiles needed. So do you see that? Gentiles and glory. You see that? Now go to Colossians 1. That's what Colossians 1 says. Gentiles and glory. Oh, it's beautiful. Uh, so the Bible uses these terminologies over and over again so we don't miss it, church. God doesn't want us to miss it. Colossians 1:26. Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians. Okay, I thought I got it mixed up there. Okay, now let's look for Gentiles and let's look for glory. It's verse 27. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory. There's glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory other so glory everybody see that Gentiles glory the Messiah was going to give a rest that was glorious. Amen. And church if you all know if if you've been born again your life now is so much more glorious than your sinful life that was a slave to sin. So you were you were enslaved in sin. And now if you're born again, now you've broken those chains and now you're free. And you should be able to say, "My life is a glorious life. &gt;&gt; My life is so much better." Right, sister Beatatrice? Amen. &gt;&gt; Your life should be so much more glorious. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. It is, church. It is. I was looking at old pictures. They were clean out a little bit in the garage and I saw pictures of my wife in high school and pictures of me. I thought, "Oh, I did such foolish things. I've got a glorious life now by the grace of God." I ain't chasing after those things. I'm chasing after the heart of God. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Matthew 11:28-29, Jesus said, "I've come to you that I might give you rest to your souls." And then Hebrews 4 1-12 speaks of we must labor and be careful not to come short of entering into his rest. Hallelujah. His rest will be glorious. It'll be Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so clear. My a child could see it. Hallelujah. Okay. So, we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, I want to go over two words now that show how your soul is the throne of God. Okay. The first word is the word dwell. Let's say dwell. Ready? Dwell. So, God's dwelling place is the throne. Let me go back here. God's dwelling place was the ark, right? He would dwell. He said, 'I'll dwell with you there. First Kings 8:30 says, "And hearken thou to the supplication of their thy servant and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place," speaking of the temple of God, "and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place. And when thou hearest, forgive." So heaven is called God's dwelling place, right? The ark of the covenant is called his dwelling place or the meeting place. But now the Bible says your soul is the dwelling place of God. Ephesians 3:17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. See that the word dwell, the word dwell is used for God's throne in heaven. It's used for the ark of the covenant. And it's used also for you and your soul. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I actually forgot to get a a verse where it says the ark would be the dwelling place of God. Maybe I read that earlier. I can't remember. But you can clearly see how heaven's dwelling place. There has to be a throne there because it's God's dwelling place. He dwells in his throne. And then Christ dwells in us now. So now you're the temple of God. Your soul is the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Okay? Now, here's why people say, uh, I invited Jesus into my heart. Okay? Now, that's not that's not used a lot in the Bible. Okay? In fact, the word invite isn't even in the King James Bible as far as inviting Jesus into your heart. Where they get that is Revelation 3 where Jesus said, "I'm I'm going to knock and if any man hear my voice and let me in," right? Doesn't use the word invite. But what do we do? We we welcome the spirit of God into our life. And so people put a few verses together and they say, "Do you want to invite Jesus in your heart?" But they forget the part about repenting. He's not I mean he's not going to come in and really have any impact unless you repent of your sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So see how see how the ecumenical move and the evangelical churches, see how they throw out water baptism and they just make a oh just let Jesus come into your heart. Well, he's not going to come into a dirty heart. &gt;&gt; Praise God. All right. So, I'll read Galatians 4:6. Now, listen here. And because ye are sons, brother said, this is the triumphal capstone of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You get the Holy Ghost because you're predestinated to get the Holy Ghost. Well, I said something there. Praise God. Amen. God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts. Let's say hearts. Ready? Hearts. crying aba father. So see if we put these two verses together he dwells in your heart by faith and he sent his spirit into your heart. So that's why brother Ram says uh the throne of God now is your heart. But isn't his throne still up in heaven? Yes. Of course he's got more than one throne. And the church said okay and the church said &gt;&gt; he's got more than one throne. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I I don't know. I don't want I don't want to do that too much. I just thought it was nice of Jen. Jen made this last time Brother Digs was here in May. So May, June, it took three months for us to get it here. So that that's because we had a baby. Okay. Okay. So see, God dwells in heaven. He also now dwells in you. What a privilege that God dwells in us. The next one is rule. Now let's all read Psalm 103:19. If you got your Bible, go there. Psalm 103:19. Let's read it together. There I want I want to hear your voices if you can. Psalm 103:19. This verse is beautiful. Now I want to look at the word rule. So we looked at the word dwell. God dwells in heaven. Now look, God rules from heaven. And then we're look at New Testament rule. Proving that God rules in you as well. That means you're God's throne. Now, okay. Now, is that is that too difficult? Is that too deep for anybody? Okay, Caris, she's got she's 11, right? Virtue, are you Nature? Are you 11? 10. If a 10-year-old can get it, uh, can you get it, Victoria? All right. You're the God sits on the throne of your soul now. Virtue, you got it. Eden, you got it. Everybody tap right here and say, "This is God's throne." Ready? This is God's. See, this is God's throne now. God dwells here. And he also rules in here, too. That means he sends out commands, right? He tells you to read your Bible, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; He tells you to pray every day. &gt;&gt; Okay, very good. Let's read it. Psalm 103 verse 19. 1 2 3. The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all. Okay. So the throne is where the kingdom is and the throne from the throne comes all the rules. Hallelujah. All right. Now, Colossians 3:15. And let the peace of God what? Rule in your what? Heart. So, see, the kingdom of God, uh, I'm sorry, the spirit of God is going to rule in your heart. So, not only do you have a throne, a place where God can sit, but from that place in your soul, God sends out his peace if you'll let it come out. &gt;&gt; Right? Got to let the peace of God have rulership over your life. Okay? And then Jesus says in Luke 17, now I didn't get the verse on that one, so let me go look that up. Luke 17, I think it's uh 13. It's right around there where he says something else is inside of you. Oh, no. It's uh 21. Sorry, I was way off. Luke 17:21. Neither shall they say low here or low there. For behold, the kingdom of God is where? Within you. Everybody said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Isn't that awesome? God's throne is in you. God's kingdom is in each one of us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He rules there. I'm so happy. Sometimes I wonder why I laugh so much. I'm just so happy. Praise God. That God would rule in a sinner like me. But now I'm a sinner turned into a saint. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm a sinner saved by grace. Hallelujah. And now I live separated from the world, my past life. So I'm a saint. I'm a sinner saint. I'm a sinner saved by grace. That's another way to say it. So, see, God dwells in your heart, right? And he rules in your heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a blessing. I'll just read this one now. Um, if you got 2 Corinthians 6. Now, this is a good marriage text uh Paul's using in verse 14. Don't be unequally yolked with unbelievers. Now, Corinthians had a big problem with that, right? We saw it. They would go to the uh remember they would go eat inside the the I don't know what to call them today, like we'd say the bars, uh the houses of idolatry. They would eat in there. And Paul's got to say, "No, you got to come out of there, actually." Okay. Now, go down to verse 16. 2 Corinthians 6:16. I want you to see this. This is very beautiful. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God. As God has said, I will what? What's that word? Dwell in them and walk in them. See, church, did you understand God walked with you into church today? &gt;&gt; If he's in your spirit, if he's in your mind, if he's in your soul, God came to church today. That's man say that God, you brought God to church today, right? But it's really God leading you to church tonight, &gt;&gt; right? But God's walking in you. Praise God. God's walking in me. God's walk in each one of us because God dwells in us, &gt;&gt; right? And I will be their God and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord. Touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you. Right? Stop going to those uh restaurants or those houses of idolatry, eating their uh their meat that sacrificed to idols and there's prostitution there. and for us to be the uh all the basketball football games and the uh all the rock and roll music going on in those restaurants, right? Stay out of there. Be separate, sayeth the Lord. And verse 18, I love this. And what will God be for you? God will be your father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, sayaeth the Lord Almighty. See church, when we separate ourselves, when we say we don't want we don't want to live for the world anymore, we don't want to hang around with Satan's children. When we physically separate from them, that's when we really become the children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's now walking in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, let me uh talk to nature here and these girls at the public school. Now, when you go back to school here next month, when you walk, let's say there's a group of people teasing, right? when you walk up and try to stand up for somebody, that's God walking in in you. &gt;&gt; Or if some of the kids are look and showing dirty videos in between the im in between the classes and you walk away, that's God walking away in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Girls, you got that? And same thing for our girls in our home school, right? If two if two of your sisters or your brothers are arguing and you start arguing with them, that was the wrong choice. You need to be a peacemaker, girls. Right? &gt;&gt; And where's my son Zion? Where's he at? He's sleeping. Okay. He's getting a good rest back there. His rest will be glorious. Would you understand that, girls? Somebody asks you to help out, you say, "Oh, sure. I'll sweep and help out, too." Right, girls? Not like that's your job. Well, what if somebody needs help? &gt;&gt; I'm talking to my girls, but it works for everybody. That's God. When you help out the family children, listen, that's God in you. God's walking in you, right? When you separate yourself, I'm not going to watch those things. I'm not going to partake of those jokes. I'm not going to be hang out with those people. Especially nature's getting in middle school. When when you physically walk away from the nature, that's God in you walking away. And shame on me because I couldn't do it when I was in middle school, but you can. &gt;&gt; See you, sister Nature. I'm I'm just talking to you now. You can live higher than brother Jesse when I was in middle school. Hallelujah. That'd be a great That'd be a great victory in the love divine. All right. Virtue is going to be there pretty soon. And then Eden, you know, see how that goes. Well, maybe they'll be homeschooled soon. We're praying. Now, I want you to see that. Now, the other one here. Uh, yes. And And now, let me go this. Go to Revelation 22:17. Revelation 22:17. I'm down to about 12 minutes. Okay. How's this gonna happen? All right. We'll see. I got to do it. I prom I didn't promise, but I said I'm going to do it. I got to keep my own rules. Now, now I want you to see this girls and even our adults. Now, here too. Revelation 22:17. Let's read together. Ready? One, two, three. and the spirit and the bride say come. And let him that heareth say come. And let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will let him take the water of life freely. Now listen children, everybody. Everybody point to your soul. Point to your soul. Point to your heart. God lives in there if you're born again. And even if you're not born again, he lives up here as well, right? Because as soon as you repent, his anointing comes back here. But now listen, anytime not Eden virtue and the nature and then my girls, anytime you invite somebody to church like Charlie or anytime you invite anytime you encourage somebody, hey come to church or hey come let's read our Bible together at lunchtime. Anytime you invite somebody to have some time with God, God is speaking through you because God sits on the throne of your heart. &gt;&gt; You hear me? It's God. Because what the spirit and the bride say come &gt;&gt; when you invite people to church or hey let's read our Bible. Hey let's start a Bible club. Maybe you could do that nature. I don't know why I'm talking to you so much tonight. But I started a Bible club. And what when I when I invite kids to Bible club it's God speaking from his throne. &gt;&gt; God speaking from his throne tonight to you as well through me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what I got to that's my life. That's what preachers are to do. They're just to let God speak. And that proves it. If God's dwells in you by faith, if God sent a spirit to dwell in your hearts, and then if you speak God's word, now God speaking off of his throne to somebody else, and he's using your lips to do it. That ought encourage us adults to try to invite somebody to church like Beatatric did. Let's give her two claps. Brother Gary, you should come to church. Brother Gary, that's God in Beatatrice. Everybody, everybody catch that. God spoke through her. God spoke off the throne of her soul and said, "Why don't you come?" Everybody understand that? That That's the right word. I'm just trying to make it simple tonight, right? It's it's a beautiful thought. This brother from Minnesota said, "Could you make a video? I think people might help people." Is it helping somebody tonight? Here. Now, the heavenly throne. Now, here I want to show show some more visuals. I think I already passed him. Yeah. Here we go. Can I zoom in? Oh, it won't let me zoom in. Come on. Okay. Okay. So, this is where brother Brandham got this thought. He got it from Clarence Lin. Okay. The tabernacle of man. You have three parts, right? body, spirit, soul. God dwells in the soul. Moses's earthly tabernacle had three parts. Let's say outer court. Ready? Outer court. &gt;&gt; Let's say holy place. Holy place. Let's say the most holy place. Ready? Most holy place. And now heaven is just like Moses's because Moses saw a vision of heaven and then he made uh he made the earthly tabernacle based upon the heavenly tabernacle. Okay? So there's an outer court in heaven. There's a holy place in heaven. There's a most holy place in heaven. Now everybody listen. Everybody watch this one now. Watch this one. This is the heavenly one. Sometimes you girls ask me where are the foolish virgin? Right? They're right here by the sacrificial altar. And the Jews are right here, right? They're right there. The Jews are the souls under the altar crying, "How long, Lord? Holy and true? Dust thou not judge and avenge our blood upon the earth?" That's what the Bible says. They're under the altar. Okay? Then you got the sea of glass. Now, there it just it's a beautiful uh it's a beautiful just waters, right? And then the Bible said there's a veil. So there's some type of a veil before the holy place. In the holy place, you have the golden altar of incense where the prayers of the saints are. You have seven lamps burning with fire before the throne of God. And you have the uh four and 20 elders. You have 24 thrones. Now, they're not in the picture here. Okay? This is the heavenly throne. And then you break past the second veil. The Bible said there's two veils. Veil before the holy place, a veil before the holiest of all. Then when you get in here, now you have four throne guards and you have God's throne. You have a rainbow round about the throne and you have lightnings and thunderings and smoke coming out of the throne of God and Jesus's body sits on the throne. All right, everybody got that? Okay. And church, the Bible says, remember the Bible says that in Hebrews 6:19, which hope we have as an anchor for the soul, both sure and steady. Everybody look up here. Your prayers don't go here. They don't go here. Although that's the place for heavenly prayers where they're stored. But your prayers, the Bible said your hope goes here into the very throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your hope enters the veil where Jesus is. Hallelujah. Don't think don't think God doesn't hear your prayers. God hears your prayers. Your hope goes into the veil. &gt;&gt; And then church, remember Jesus is there not for his sake. He's there for your sake. Hebrews 9:24, "For Christ is not entered in the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the truth, but into heaven itself now to appear in the prince of God for us." Let's all say us. Ready? Us. He's there. Victoria, he's there for you. Beatatric, he's there for you tonight. Kesha, he's there for you. He's there in the presence of God for your prayer requests. Hallelujah. All right. Now, the temple stays there. Now, here, let me uh click off here. I'm almost done. I better be done soon. So, here's another picture. You got the 4 and 20 elders. You got all these angels. The Bible said multitudes of angels. You have the four beasts, rainbow round about the throne, white throne. Oh, yeah. There's the seven lamps of fire, seven spirits of God. Okay? And now notice these cherubam are what? The throne guards. God always guards his throne. Okay? Now, during the millennium, now here's what I didn't get to. During the millennium, there will be a throne in the millennial temple that Jesus Christ will sit on, and he'll judge all nations with a rod of iron. So in the millennium, there'll be a throne on earth for Jesus in Jerusalem. And there'll still be a throne in heaven. But when the future home, when the new Jerusalem comes down, now the heavenly throne of God comes down to earth. So now there won't be a heavenly throne. Now the heavenly throne marries and unites with the earth. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Revelation 21:22 says, "And I saw no temple." Let's say no temple. Ready? no temple therein. For the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's gonna there's not going to be any new building where we got to go to in the future home because the Bible said, "The Lamb and the Lord God are the temple thereof." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read Revelation 22 verse one. And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. It's at the very top of that pyramid city is a throne. Hallelujah. And a river of life flows out of it by God's grace. Now, I didn't have time to put those pictures on. In the past, I did. Hallelujah. So, the final temple, church, is the body of Jesus Christ. There's not going to be a building we walk into in the future home. It's just going to be the body of Jesus. That's the temple. But that body is going to have a throne as well. Hallelujah. And so church, what does it become? It's got you got one throne and all these other believers are thrown. So God has one throne and then he's got millions of other thrones. &gt;&gt; God ruling every believer. &gt;&gt; So it's God in control, God dwelling, God reigning in every single believer. Oh, isn't it so wonderful to know that God will dwell in you for all eternity? Praise God. If you're born again, you've already got God dwelling. You have a a down payment, an earnest payment that God will always dwell permanently for all eternity. Your soul will be the throne of God forever, for now and forever more. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got two minutes. If I'm going to keep my word, I'm gonna I'm gonna keep my word. &gt;&gt; So, I'm closing with two. There's two revelations from the throne of God. Okay, there's two revelations from this. The first revelation is that these four beasts are also four anointings throughout the church ages. Brother Ram said that's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; God sent the lion. That's the boldness of the early apostles. Then God sent the spirit of the ox for all those million 68 million martyrs. That was just what was recorded during the times of the early church down to the dark ages. And then God sent the wisdom of man in the 1500s with uh uh Martin Luther and John Wesley. And then God sends an eagle. God sends a prophetic anointing at the end time so we can understand thus sayeth the Lord. We can understand the Bible and especially the book of Revelation in Daniel. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And Ezekiel. Thus sayeth the Lord. Now who remembers that last that last revelation the second anointing? Brother said those four beasts and the throne of God represent the four gospels protecting the book of acts. How many remember that? &gt;&gt; Brother gives us an example. So this represents the throne of God and these four gospels represent the four throne guards. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God, brother Ram said God always protects his his presence and God's presence is salvation and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. But the rabb said God protects that revelation with his four throne guards. Hallelujah. Praise God. Because in Matthew, the name of the son is Jesus. And he said, "Baptize in one name to the father, son, and holy ghost." And then in Mark, he said, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." &gt;&gt; And then in Luke, he said, "Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name." One name. Praise God. And then the Bible said, "John went down into the water because there was much water there." So it shows we don't sprinkle. We're going to baptize Genevieve, not sprinkle her. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So see our revelation, the prince of God that accompanies people that get saved and baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ, it's protected by throne guards. God always protects his throne. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm already at 7:46, so this is my last minute. I'm going to go two minutes over. Brother Ram gives us a second example. Then he closes that sermon. It's from uh January 1961. Brother Bram said, "All of God's revelations are protected. Everything in the book of Acts is protected by the Gospels." In other words, there's no contradictions. There's no changes. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today. &gt;&gt; So divine healing is taught. Jesus sends out his the apostles with power to heal the sick, raise the dead, cast out demons. In Mark, the last thing Jesus says before he goes, he said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. They shall cast out devils. Uh if they take up a serpent, it shall not harm them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall &gt;&gt; Luke Luke is a repeat here where Jesus sends out his uh 12 apostles." And then in the good old book of St. John, Jesus said, "Greater works than these shall you do because I go to my father." Nobody can do a greater miracle than Jesus. It means we'll do more miracles because now the Holy Ghost is in millions or maybe even billions of Christians for the last 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "If my words abide in you and and they you abide in me, then you'll ask what you will and it shall be done." &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Let's give God a round of applause. Amen. Hallelujah. Musicians can come. I was two minutes over at 7:45. How many appreciate the word of God tonight? &gt;&gt; Well, I can't believe I fit it in there. Praise God. But hallelujah. All glory to God tonight. Are you happy, Hund? Is that Was that okay? Was that pretty good? All right. Amen. Hallelujah. God is good. You know, this is a special time of our lives, you know, is was different, you know, with Malachi. So, I appreciate everybody having mercy. And we had to do the same thing with Austin. Remember when Austin first came back in 2021, we had to shorten our Wednesday night services so he could get some rest by God's grace. But how many love the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. With our heads bowed, let's just pray that we'll let the Lord rule from the throne of our hearts. Especially our children and our young people. You have to learn from a young age. Let God rule every decision, especially at home. Everybody acts good at church, right? I mean, I could look at all the young people. Praise God. Everybody acts nice and happy. But really, where you want God to rule is when you're at home. Praise God. If someone's being mean to you, show kindness to them. That's God speaking through you. That shows God's ruling on the throne of your heart. [Music] I can really see a change in Caris's life. Every time I ask Caris to do something, he's like, "Yes, Daddy. Uh, can you hold Tulsi?" "Yes, Daddy. Can you get that uh peanut butter for me?" "Yes, daddy." I can see a real change in her life. I can see she's letting God rule her life. I've seen Genevieve do that now. She never came up for prayer before, but when she got saved, when she cried, we I prayed with her, wept, cried. Now, she'd been coming up, and I don't even got to ask her to come up and pray. God's ruling on the throne of her heart. Hallelujah. That's what I want, church. I want God to dwell in my in my soul, right? And I want him to rule in my soul as well. How many want that tonight? Let's let's let's pray. Father God, this is such a beautiful thought. The brother, his name is Brother Russ shared with me. He said, "Why don't you do a teaching on that?" Lord, I could have went a lot lot longer, but Lord, I think we got the main point. Our soul is your throne, God. How privileged we are that you said, "I will walk in them. I will speak through them because they'll say what the spirit says when they invite people to church. When they invite people about baptism, come. You need to be born again. You should pray about being born again. You should hear this sermon by brother Brandham. You should hear this sermon by brother Diggs. Whenever church, oh God, whenever we invite people, Lord, to listen or have some interaction with God, Lord, it's God speaking through us. How simple it is. Thank you for sister Beatatrice letting Lord you speak through her. [Music] Bless her I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Father I pray for especially the young people and even myself, all the adults here, Lord God. Lord, may we have a fresh devotion to let this peace of God rule our hearts tonight. May the kingdom of God that's within us, may it have full control that will say the right thing. We won't be snippy or impatient or angry, but we'll be humble and sweet. We'll be patient. We'll be obedient, Lord God. Grant it, Lord Jesus. Oh God, that will prove to others that you sit on the throne of our hearts, oh God, and that you're actually ruling our hearts. Lord, if we're honest, sometimes I feel like we push you off our throne and we try to take over. God, forgive us. That's especially in our minds. God, forgive us. Bible said we offend, grieve not, offend not the Holy Ghost, whereby we're sealed to the day of our redemption. Father, if we've done that today, forgive us, God, for kicking you off the throne of our our minds. We invite you back in. Forgive us for our evil thoughts. Let your spirit come back in our mind, Lord God, we pray. May everybody see that Christ dwells within me. Christ dwells within each and every person here tonight. Dwell in us. walk in us. Speak to us. May we be your sons and daughters. I pray, oh God, let my soul, God, be your throne that people will know he's a real son of God. Lord, we're never claiming perfection, God. But we want to be so yielded to you that the peace of God rules our hearts. The love of God rules our hearts. The joy of God rules our hearts. And people can see that your spirit has full control of our lives. Grant it, Lord Jesus. Bless your people tonight in Christ's name.
