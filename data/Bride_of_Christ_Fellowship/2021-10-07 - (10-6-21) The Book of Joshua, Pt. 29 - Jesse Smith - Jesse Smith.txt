john 3 16. all right let's read that on three together one two three for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen and go let's go to deuteronomy 33 tonight so lord willing i'll start with some foundational scriptures kind of just present the gospel here and then we'd like to finish with our thought deuteronomy 33 verse 24. read verses 24 and 25 by god's grace we're willing we'll try to get to the tribe of asher tonight lord willing we'll see how the holy spirit moves here and we're just thankful and just privileged to be in the house of the lord praise god amen and we're thankful for all god's grace deuteronomy 33 verse 24 and 25 looking at the tribe of asher lord willing we'll try to get there tonight let's read verse 24 and 25 together one two three and of asher he said let asher be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil verse 25 thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy strength be amen let's bow our heads for one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto god you can raise your hands you can just pray to him in your own heart while i pray this is of course the main part of the service where the word of god is preached and we know there's life and death in the power of the tongue and we're trusting the life of jesus christ will speak through my lips tonight and speak through yours as well as you say amen and agree with the word of god and we all seek to obey the word of god let us pray heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity to be in your house lord we thank you for lord the worship that we can feel your presence god and you said you inhabit the praises of your people so father as we praise you tonight we feel your holiness we feel your love we feel your power lord god and we're grateful to be in this house tonight lord god we pray you'll meet every need lord thank you for our visitors and brother mj back lord and brother benjamin back lord what a great blessing lord god to be in the house of god tonight we pray your holy ghost will just speak to the hearts of the people give them what they have need of lord god and we just ask god that you be glorified in everything said and done lord may you have preeminence tonight god may you do what you've been longing to do in our lives hallelujah as we obey your word and as we love you god more and more we pray you'll make us ready for your soon coming in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated there praise god so let me just take here a few moments and we'll just look at a a few thoughts here about the gospel we'll just try to lay it out briefly by the grace of god the gospel is a beautiful story how many can say amen to that there's the word gospel means good news jesus christ came preaching the gospel you know what his first word was repent so if you want to hear the good news you first got to repent of all the bad things you've done praise god and that's how when we become christians that's how it happened for all of us here who have become christians we heard the good news but to make it good news we had to know the bad news the bad news is that we're we've all fallen short of the glory of god right we all sinned and come short of god's glory we're on the path to hell unless we repent of our sins repent means to turn around and go the opposite direction praise god and so the gospel comes to say turn around and choose life that you might live the gospel comes to say reject satan and reject death and reject hell and accept eternal life praise god that's a beautiful message amen and we are the ones of church we're the carers of that message amen that we have the good news of the glorious gospel of jesus christ so let's go back to john 3 16. we'll try to get some scriptures up here and uh just look at this briefly i just maybe i'll take about 15 minutes we'll see how the lord directs but i just want to clearly present this here uh because i don't know everyone's background and it's just it's always fresh to hear it again by god's grace amen the gospel never gets old if it does and the bible says then we haven't been adding anointing to our lives right that's what the statue of reverend man is all about if we do all those things then the bible says we will not be forgetful right of the gospel we'll be fruitful we'll abound and an entrance will be made into us for eternal life if we keep adding the anointing of the holy spirit that's what the gospel is more anointing of the holy spirit amen john 3 16 we read that for god so loved the world so god loved the world gave his only son jesus christ that whosoever believeth him should not perish but have everlasting life how many believe in christ tonight amen now look at verse 17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved so god doesn't want anyone to be lost right so that's why he sent his son he sent his son to save praise god jesus's first coming was for salvation now church his second coming is for judgment hallelujah so he came first when jesus walked the earth he came to save amen i didn't know you did not come to condemn but here at the end time we're so close to his second coming here he's coming to rescue his bride for all those who are believers but all those who reject the good news they will be judged the bible says now look here the next let me look at the next verse here verse 18 he that believeth him is not on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god now that includes billions and millions of people right because uh billions of people do not believe on jesus christ as the messiah the muslims the hindus and uh all the uh religions of china and japan all these billions of people do not believe on the name of jesus christ so at this point they're headed for hell but you and i by god's grace can be used by god to win the souls that want to accept jesus christ we can we can be gospel spreaders praise god to those people who are longing for eternal life amen hallelujah verse now look at verse 19 now here's for you and i this is the condemnation of the easter jesus's red letter words why are people going to be condemned and go to hell jesus answers it because light is coming to the world but men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil so church it comes down to this a person will be saved because they love jesus christ more than they love sin and people will be condemned because they love sin more than they love jesus christ so this is what john 3 16 is all about god love god loved people so he sent his son so people would grab the light and walk in the light rather than lay a hold of darkness that's the word of god amen now look at verse 20 for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved now look jesus says there's going to be people that hate my light that hate the word of god and the light is truth there's people today that just hate the truth right they they can't stand the truth but jesus said those are the people that will be lost but those who love the truth those are the people that will be saved amen and we are amongst that group that believe the light we believe the word of god and we are destined to be saved because of god's mercy praise god now look at verse 21 how are we saved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light see so you must do truth and you must come to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrong in god so when a person is living in sin they're in darkness they don't know jesus christ and they're disobedient to jesus christ but when the light shines on them they have a choice am i going to remain in darkness and walk away from the light or am i going to walk into the light and be saved amen church that's the good news the good news is you don't have to live in darkness you can live in the light amen hallelujah and the way to get there is to repent and say you're sorry and that's what jesus said that your deeds may be made manifest so a real christian experience is when you come to the altar or you you're praying with a friend a christian and you say jesus forgive me of all my sins i'm sorry for my lies maybe my uh maybe my stealing right uh of my curses i'm sorry of my fornication having sex before marriage i'm sorry my adultery having sex with someone outside of marriage i'm sorry for my blasphemy using your name as a cuss word right i'm sorry of of all the wickedness of this world right homosexuality bestiality transgenderism all these things i'm sorry for all these abominations but i'm coming to the light because i want to obey the light i believe jesus christ is the son of god and i'm coming for salvation today amen that's the gospel truth if i ever heard it amen because jesus said when you come to him you must come to the light and you must love the light more than you love darkness amen i know we are amongst the most unpopular churches and unpopular churches uh and preachers but that's okay jesus said few there be that find this narrow road god wants all to be saved but he knows only few will find it amen now let's go to acts 2 38 by god's grace there's one way to come that's to repent and then after you've repented of your sins you are fully buried under water you're baptized under water you're not sprinkled you're baptized under the water and that water represents death you go under death your old your old life is dead and gone and you raise up a new life praise god a new christian hallelujah so acts 2 38 peter said them repent let's turn from all your sins and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission that's the sending away of your sins how many glad god sent your sins away i don't live in my sins anymore they've been sent away when you're a sinner those sins that they they're a burden to you you're walking with the burden of oh i've done this and i i got all these problems and because you haven't confessed your sins but when you come to jesus christ and you confess your sins he takes all those burdens away and then you can run to the people that you've hurt and say forgive me i'm sorry why because the burden of sin is gone you're forgiven and you're guaranteed to go to heaven amen glory it's repentance and then being baptized in water calling on the name of jesus christ for that is the name that every knee shall bow to every tongue will confess that jesus christ is lord for the glory of god the father amen and then sometime after that you receive the feeling of the holy ghost you get so full you might scream glory you get so full you might shout amen you get so full you might speak in tongues but one thing you'll do is you'll give god glory for the wonderful works he's done amen that's what they did on the day of pentecost they said how do we hear all the wonderful works of god in our language if you're really born again you'll worship god with all your heart praise god and then after that you will strive daily to live a holy life like that song says let my life be a symphony let my life be a song of holy holy holy unto the lord hallelujah how do you know you love jesus you come to the light let's go to another one john 14. how do you know you love jesus you keep his commands that's what coming to the light means four times jesus said this he said if you love me you'll keep my commands verse 15 john 14 verse 15. everybody says i love jesus but not everybody obeys jesus that's the real proof how you know if you love jesus you do what he says hallelujah you come to the light you don't stay in darkness and love sin and love darkness and cussing and swear and dirty sexual shows and all things like that you don't love that you leave the darkness and you come to the light praise god hallelujah john 14 verse 15. let's read it together one two three if ye love me keep my commandments praise god verse go to verse 21 let's read that one two three he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and also we'll stop right there go to verse 23 let's read that one two three jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and the church said how many times does jesus have to repeat it till we get it church here he repeats it three times and i think there's a couple more in that chapter if you love me obey me if you love me do what i said amen if you're glad i died for your sins then obey what i said because i'm trying to make you like me praise god amen i'm trying to put my jesus i'm trying to put my spirit in you so that you can glorify the father amen so you can finally glorify the one who created you and you can be what father god made you to amen hallelujah that's the gospel hallelujah if you love jesus you'll keep his commands amen we've got people that have kept his commands for 40 50 years here praise god has it been a joy brother has there been trials but have you received grace for every trial let's say praise the lord praise the lord 40 50 years serving god not wavering but constant steadfast every trial that comes you knock it down every devil that comes you cast him off amen you just keep marching glorifying god proving that you love jesus amen proving that you're walking the light that you love the light and you despise darkness and you want to be with jesus for eternity oh that's the good news if i ever heard it praise god how did it heal your church now if i could just briefly say a few more things the way to be saved is to hear a preacher the bible said how can you hear except a preacher be sent romans 10 14 can you board up there honey this is the way if you come to church tonight that's the best thing you can do if you want to be saved because jesus said i'm sending the preachers look what he said how should they call on him in whom they've not believed how can you call on jesus if you don't believe in him and how should they believe in jesus of whom they've not heard how they're going to believe in somebody unless you hear about him and how should they hear about him without a preacher so jesus chooses just simple humble nitwit preachers like me hallelujah and he said he sends them or he'll send you to the preacher and you hear the good news that's how you hear about jesus you believe what that preacher said because you feel the holy spirit here you see the word of god written by the holy spirit and you say that's the light that i want to walk in amen and you believe this is how jesus set it up come hear a preacher the preacher that loves me will preach my truth and if he preaches it and you receive it you'll be saved hallelujah that's the word of god hallelujah now there's so many things i could say but i hope i'm laying that in there now once you get saved though you're going to want to stay with the church because jesus says once you're saved you become a sheep and a sheep cannot leave its shepherd that's right right there's one time a sheep did lose it what did jesus do he went to go find him amen and where did he leave him out there with the sinners and the wolves no he brought him back to the church amen he brought him back to the other sheep so if you're saved you will not wander out there if you do jesus will bring you back amen hallelujah bring you back where there's other sheep and where there's protection from a shepherd hallelujah that's the gospel way there's no other way to do it church this is god's way hear a preacher believe it and then you assemble with the saints until jesus comes back or you die and go to meet him early praise god hallelujah now if you would go to first john 2 19. if you got it it's in the back of the bible a case you'll put up here if it's difficult to find first john 2 19. look what john john wrote this and john lived with jesus for three and a half years and then jesus left jesus sent his holy spirit and filled john and then john wrote this they these are the lost the lost people went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us so john said when people left our church it proved they were not believers like us because no doubt if they were believers they would have stayed with us a sheep is going to be indefensible a sheep has no defenses except the shepherd praise god and you and i cannot be strong believers we cannot it's going to be very difficult to be saved unless we stay with the sheep the fact that you stay here proves you're a sheep amen if people leave and they never come back that proves they were not sheep to begin with is that right that's what john says this is the holy ghost saying that those who have uh the are saved they will obey the word of god and they will stay with the saints hallelujah that's exactly right now maybe i'll just do one more here by the grace of god uh there's so much uh first corinthians 1 18. yes let's go with that one then we'll just move on to this uh this message i hope i'm preaching the gospel to you tonight in the the most simplistic form praise god if you love jesus you'll keep his commands hallelujah and he's peter said repent and then be baptized if you have not repented i encourage you to be repent tonight if you have not been baptized i don't know if we can baptize you tonight but we'll baptize you as soon as the sun comes up tomorrow we'll have to go to portland's lakes whenever they open up and we'll baptize you we don't have a baptismal pool in here but if you want to really be baptized and be a holy ghost feel satan and christian we'll baptize you in the morning praise god hallelujah now first corinthians 1 18. let's look at that got that hon could you put that up there first corinthians 1 18 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness in other words people going to hell don't want to hear about the cross but if you are going to heaven you love the cross amen because the cross is where jesus took all your whippings the cross is where jesus paid for all your sins he took your pain that you might be healed he took your punishment that you might be forgiven praise god it was a substitutionary sacrifice that's what a sacrifice is something takes your place amen jesus christ took our place he was beaten so he didn't look like a man he was bloodied so we didn't have to be praise god and the believers love hearing about that hallelujah that jesus christ loved us so much he bore the cross for us and then he defeated death which is a proof that we if we die in christ we'll raise with him amen praise god hallelujah but unto us which are saved it is the power of god preaching is power power means authority preaching is authority over the devil hallelujah when the word comes forth if you say amen you believe that and you plan on acting on that that gives you authority over satan the word of god the simple preaching of god's word tonight anyone who receives the word can have instant authority over satan amen that's the way god set it up praise god hear the word believe it accept it now you've got power amen all you gotta do is confess your sins and say lord i'm sorry i did this i'm sorry i did that i don't ever want to do that again now you've got authority now you've got kingdom power praise god now you're going to overcome that's exactly right praise god now look at verse 19. for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent so preaching is so foolish god hides eternal life in foolish preaching it looks foolish to the world right they think a big beyonce concert right or or some rock and roll concert they think that's a great thing that's foolishness to god right or that the maybe the uh whatever the super bowl whatever it is they think that's something great that's foolishness that's nonsense the real the real thing is right here tonight it's the gospel of jesus christ oh but it's so humble amen but that's where jesus that's the only place he feels welcome that's the only place that keeps his word amen jesus is not welcome at the super bowl he's not welcome at the nba game because they don't want him there they worship devils there but we worship jesus christ the risen savior of the world amen because he's welcome here tonight praise god amen so we're foolish to them but they're foolish to us so it depends whose fool you want to be i want to be a fool for jesus i'll always believe in jesus i'll be a fool for you they can make fun of me they can mock me they can do whatever they want but i believe jesus i'm choosing the light i'm turning down the darkness amen next verse 20. where's the wise where's the scribe where's the dispute of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world between one for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe so you go to the white house tonight you're not going to hear the gospel they think they're saying all nice things about coven and trying to keep everybody living in fear and shoot them up with things we don't even know what's in there they think that's that's great that's foolishness that's not eternal life eternal life is here tonight because jesus is here to forgive jesus is here to heal jesus is here to save amen this is the real eternal life this is what gives you hope this is what gives you strength this is what gives you joy this is what gives you a future amen it's only in jesus christ praise god you'll find it nowhere else yes we're supposed to respect the president yes we respect all these guys and we pray for them that they'll repent praise god but there's one place where life comes and that's in the gospel of jesus amen praise god now i think i laid that pretty clear there let me do one more second john 1 9 okay second john 1 9 keep holding up there honey second john 1 9. now let me before i read this doctrine the word what is doctrine doctrine doctrine means an instruction so i already gave you some doctrine tonight if you want to get saved repent be baptized the name of jesus christ that's instruction i'm giving you steps what to do but once you once you go through that and become a christian well now there's other things i can give you steps for right how to overcome mind battles how to overcome complexes we looked at that on sunday night right hallelujah how to be healed amen there's there's many instructions we can give how to be a good husband how to be a good wife and the sister said brothers brother said amen amen how to be an obedient child there's steps i can give you an instruction that's called doctrine and look what the bible says whoever transgressed that means purposely disobeys and does not abide or live in the doctrine of christ the instructions of christ does not have god if you don't obey the instructions of the gospel you don't have god amen but thank god there's more to this verse amen i'm glad the holy spirit didn't stop there he kept writing amen he said he that abides who lives who continues in the instruction of christ he has both the father and the son hallelujah that's how you know you're in the gospel that's how you know that jesus christ is truly your savior you abide in the word you live in the word you love the word you obey the word you die for the word ah let's say praise the lord i don't think i preached his heart on wednesday night a long time but you're all pulling like that so we feel the pull praise god amen now i'm going to stop right there now let's go to as far as with that introduction that was only my timer stopped so i'm sorry so give me a few minutes now i'm going to preach here to the uh the main church of course everybody can receive some of it but let's take a few minutes on this we've been uh preaching on the book of joshua and if you don't know joshua he was the prophet that followed moses moses brought israel out of egypt after over 440 years of bondage they were slaves they were brick makers right but moses brought them out by the power of god moses brought him through a red sea the red sea stood up and there's evidence that that's there's evidence of that right we got the video there's evidence today scientists have found that the red sea parted hallelujah just like they got evidence for southern gamora they got evidence for everything amen evidence i saw yesterday for king hezekiah they got all this evidence oh it's just a humble if you want to find it god will show it to you amen he says it's these doubters it's these haters it's these sin lovers that despise the things of god but god's word is true it's forever set on heaven god's word will never fail us amen hallelujah every day they find more and more proof that god's word is right hallelujah that means there's more and more proof that we're going to heaven hallelujah thank god praise god hallelujah so moses brought him out but then moses made a mistake he was out in the wilderness and and god said speak to the rock and give these people water and moses said you bunch of rebels and he smoked a rock and god said because you glorified yourself you'll not take them in so god said go up there moses get ready to die now god was going to be gracious he was going to resurrect him in a few days because satan's going to say where is that body where's that body but but moses died and then joshua now had the anointing and god said as i was with you joshua i'll be i'm sorry as i was with moses so i'll be with you and so god did the same thing they crossed the jordan river much smaller of course but god pulled back the water and two million people walked over strong into the promised land praise god and that's where we pick up today after five or seven years of battles now joshua is giving these tribes of israel their inheritance all right now tonight lord willing i just want to show this tonight i want to look at asher now let me expand the page here just a little bit it might help you a little bit so this would have been about uh 2500 years ago but we can learn lessons today the bible says all these old stories were written for our understanding in other words you and i were when we were sinners we were in egypt right we were slaves to sin and the church said amen don't forget where you come from don't forget where you come from church don't forget you were once lost but thank god you're found amen you were in egypt like they were spiritual egypt but god brought you out and brought you through the water there's that water baptism praise god right and then he brought you the wilderness to test you to see if you would obey all the word of god hallelujah then if you obey all the word of god then he brings you into the promised land or not or here across jordan this is the jordan river god had to bring the people into jordan which represents the baptism of the holy ghost or being filled with the spirit of god so there's three steps to being filled with god's spirit there's getting saved out of egypt being baptized there's the testing of sanctification and then there's the baptism of the holy ghost and once you get in here you fight great battles but then eventually church don't you want to settle down after after fighting devils and after fighting battles don't you want to find a place that's your own don't you want to find a place where you can just settle down and rest and just enjoy the blessings of god that's what god has for us we leave the world and we have to then we develop in through the second step we develop good habits and then when when god's ready he brings us in the promised land and we fight off great battles but then we get a time of rest where we can enjoy the blessings of god the peace of god the joy of god the mercy of god oh the faith of god hallelujah the peace that passes all your standing amen we can find where god wants us to be and we can be assured that we are doing what god's called us to do that's what that's their story and now it's our story so this was the story of israel 2500 years ago but now it's our spiritual story all right so um let's review this real quick so we've looked at the tribe of reuben based upon the prophecy of the holy ghost he was later his tribe was disgraced and demoted and replaced by judah so there's a sad story of someone who who was the oldest and should have had the birthright but because of his sexual sin he lost all of his blessings that's the story of reuben very sad story but he's still saved because he repented at the end right now simeon and levi they had an awful start they were murderers but god forgave them now simeon his his his descendants fell into insignificance but levi repented that and all his descendants were brought into the priesthood they were the ones who ministered in the ark of the covenant they're the ones that brought the blood of the sacrifice into the holiest of holies oh my church god can do great things with someone who's fallen god wants to redeem your life god has great things for your life if you'll repent of your past sins and be dedicated to god god will do great things for you he took them from murderers to the ones ministering the holy things of god and he brought him out of darkness into the light and not just the sunlight the shekinah light amen hallelujah the holy spirit light praise god he takes levi out of the darkness of murder and into the light of the holy spirit what a what a testimony now judah was just all around a faithful boy and because reuben fell in sin god exalted judah up and that's where we get jesus christ is the lion of the tribe of judah because judah was such an obedient son in his offspring they got exalted to the head of israel and that's why david was of the tribe of judah praise god that's why all the good kings came out of judah because the holy spirit said your seed will hold the scepter of god your seed will be the lawgivers amen and they will be the holders of the scepter until shiloh comes until jesus comes church jesus has the scepter tonight praise god jesus has the authority tonight jesus is our king tonight that's why we come here to give our king praise and honor amen that's right now dan was a small tribe he was honored in samson's life i never heard of samson he had that long hair he couldn't cut it for all those years of his life i don't think he cut it for about uh would have been about 40 years of his life because he judged israel 20 years after the holy ghost first came upon him so he's probably a teenager or maybe late late teens early 20s and he he ruled for 20 years and then he got then he disobeyed with delilah right got his eyes popped out cut his hair but then the hair grew back and god's grace came back to him yeah church if you've lost your power jesus wants to give it back amen and the way to do that is wait upon the lord and he'll renew your strength like the eagle amen there's the eagle and dan's anoint dan's uh remember dan's uh flag dan standard was the eagle praise god huh there it is samson he's brought he got his strength back like the ego praise god that was the banner their tribe was under the eagle flag but later after samson died the whole tribe went into idolatry they set up a calf can you imagine a cow they set up a cow and bowed down and worshipped that they were so deceived see they left the light for the darkness what a mistake church we should not bow down to anything we should only bow down to jesus christ bow down to no government right or no family member praise god don't bow down to any sin only bow down to jesus christ and say jesus i worship you give me your power give me your authority to overcome all these false spirits all these i idols give me grace to overcome these idols and you know what he will amen that's what the word of god says church now naphtali was a great tribe they helped barrick and deborah get the victory uh years after joshua had passed away but then the beautiful thing about naphtali if i'll just skip ahead to that it's hard to see here i don't think i can zoom in yeah the beautiful thing about naphtali does this look familiar we looked at this last wednesday night does capernaum sound familiar jesus christ made his home base capernaum and all of his almost all of his apostles he called out of this area so naphtali has prophecy that says he's going to be he's going to have goodly words and he's going to be swift like a deer and that was prophetic of jesus praise god jesus was the deer that the shulamite in song of psalms come quickly come quickly simon come to me quickly like a deer i want to be with you set me as a seal upon your heart praise god hallelujah and then the bible said the holy spirit of jesus is the seal in our hearts praise god so this prophecy was speaking of jesus christ and his apostles had the the uh the agility and the beauty of a deer the swiftness of a deer they had a swift quick ministry it was only three and a half years they had a short ministry but they were speaking good words they were speaking life they were speaking resurrection they were speaking eternal life they were speaking victory they were speaking healing they were speaking deliverance and god backed it up just like god backs us up amen if you want to be free you can be free tonight if you want to be delivered tonight you can be delivered tonight it's all done by the goodly words of jesus christ amen praise god now and then we looked at gad last last sunday dad was a tribe that had warriors that lost they were really great wars but for some reason they kept losing but the holy spirit said you just keep believing and by the end you'll get the victory and that's what happened in the days of david in david's time they overcame all their neighboring enemies the moabites and all the other enemies uh the the the gorgeous side gurgicites i believe they overcame all them because god promised them just keep fighting and you'll get the victory out of god also came elijah the tishbite because that's part of gilead praise god and he brought forth justice as god's mouthpiece he came out of gad amen and that's what god said he said dad you will judge israel and that's exactly what he did praise god through the prophet elijah brought down the judgments of god he called fire down from heaven he called all these judgments upon ahab and jezebel the dogs will lick your blood right that was the judgment upon them they had space to repent but they repented not church we ought to rejoice god's giving us a few hours here we can repent amen god's giving us space to repent of our sins and so we must take advantage of that praise god amen now i'm going to skip past this let's try to look at asher for a few minutes i think you're going to be encouraged by asher there's just a lot of there's just a lot of uh simple uh life related blessings we can see in the life of asher now from what i study church he's the youngest of all of them as far as i could study of the fir of the the the wife leah out of leah okay because remember out of rachel know he came the youngest was benjamin but out of the first wife leah here's the youngest so we would say you know in those days the youngest wasn't look look it wasn't looked on too good remember in bible days remember uh jesse he went to samuel's i'm sorry samuel went to jesse's house and he said i'm gonna make one of your boys kings did they even get the youngest one do they even say hey david come on in the prophet's here we might be king did they even call for him they thought no way could the youngest be a real man of god he's just the youngest got any youngest in here god has a plan for all of us moses was the youngest ah hallelujah god can use you if you're united to the holy spirit praise god so asher's this insignificant youngest from leah not even from the really loved wife rachel but because god saw what was going to be in this young boy's heart now look he had a lot of people to learn from didn't he brother william he could learn from the oldest reuben he could get lessons from naphtali he could get all these lessons from issachar zebulun judah right judah oh man i can learn from all my brothers in church that's what we all do to these saints like brother william we all learn lessons from his life if you're struggling you can ask me but consider asking a saint like brother william or his wife beatrice praise god that had been through the battles before the bible said the gray head is wisdom amen you're not the only one who's gone through these battles he's going through it all these saints have gone through it and if we need help we ought to reach out to get some help praise god because god's got help here god's got some veteran soldiers here amen the bible said god doesn't give a new temptation everything you've gone through somebody else has already overcome amen and god will give you encouragement he'll give you the word that you need he'll give you the authority to overcome satan at every one of his tricks amen and let no man despise your youth either right the bible said if you're young be an example to all the other believers that's right hallelujah don't make an excuse well i'm young i can enjoy sin no crucify the lust of the flesh be an example for all of us to see because we all know the older ones are going to be an example thank god for them they proved that you you and i can make it if if if they go on as the lord tarries they've already proved we can make it too amen because there's no temptation what's going to be given the future except what they've already overcome praise god so don't lose hope church don't be discouraged god is with us god is not going to give us something we can't handle praise god no matter how young how old how insignificant you may feel don't feel insignificant that's the devil you have a significant place in this world you are going to make an impact on somebody and the impact is get them saved the impact is you spreading the word to them so they live eternally brother ram said in eternity after the new jerusalem i was hurt listening today he said we're going to walk around brother where he said we're going to take a short trip he said for 500 years that's right we made a little trip to jeffersonville a few years ago right a one-day trip but in that place church amen that new jerusalem will say okay i'm checking out for a little bit i'm gonna go on a little journey when you're gonna be back 500 years and brother man i said you'll be walking around the mountains and all these places he said pretty soon you run that sister the church i forget a name sister gertie or something he said oh they're sister gertie now she's not old like she was on earth she's young she's like 20 years old brother mj how are you now 20. so he look at his baby's skin look at that no wrinkles do you have any white hair brother no of course not so he's at this perfect age that's what we're going to look like when we have eternal life praise god amen i'm twice your age i'm 40. this is what you look like when you get 40. unfortunately but he said will we walk around brother the mountains for a couple hundred years we'll run into a sister from the church and say oh sister gertie how you doing and brother said she'll be there petting a tiger just petting it and you'll walk up and say oh little tiger you'll pet the tiger and it'll purr like a kitten they'll say how you doing they'll lick your hand if you want to get a ride on it go ahead right what good thing is god going to withhold to them that love him and brother brahm said before you start thinking about what you want to do next before you have a need he talks about grapes he said before you call for the grapes god will already answer it amen you'll be hungry for some grapes and before you ask god you'll turn around oh there's the graves oh let's sit down and let's have some fellowship he said well just feast on the grapes amen and he said after about 500 years you'll go back he said and then you'll present yourself before the lord and they'll say how long have you been gone he said ten days he said i've been gone two thousand years it'll just go so fast church because as as awful as it is here the opposite is true there things get harder here we get worn out here but there things only get better praise god they only be able to get better and more young and more happy we just get better all the time amen it's the opposite of here and god gives us all these promised blessings the nations will be healed there'll be no more no more war between the nations right russia ukraine there'll be no more wars china taiwan right north korea south korea there'll be no more wars because the bible said jesus is going to give fruits for the healing of the nations oh there's going to be no more battles like that there's going to be no more blood stains no more bloodshed it's all going to be peace it's all going to be joy it's all going to be happiness and you can have that if you come to the light amen what promises we have as christians i just thought i'd lay that in i thought that was so beautiful he said i'm going to go for a journey i'll be back in 500 years and when you get back it was actually 2 000. i took a little extended vacation brother william an extra 1 500 years i was out there enjoying the mountains and enjoying god's nature and worshiping god and brother man said every night he said before the sun would go down or something he would say we'd all present ourselves before god and say papa god how are you tonight and the holy spirit will come down and talk with us we'll feel the sweet cool winds of the holy spirit i'll say thank you lord for another day in this eternal place thank you for saving a wretch like me i remember when i was lost but now i'm found we would have communion just like god came down with adam and eve amen in the cool of the evening jesus will come down and be with us every day because he loves us he died for us and the bible said for god so loved the world god so loved us he wants to spend eternity with us oh that's a reality that ain't no fantasy that's a reality he said behold i make all things new all things are going to be made new praise god if you don't get them here haven and karis are going to get your horses over there there's going to be whole mountains full of them and you can take as much time as you want and go chase one down and say hey sweetheart come here ah yeah go feed it you already have some fruit ready to feed it can we go on a little ride and maybe they'll be able to talk i don't know but you'll be able to get on there you'll have all the desires of your heart and just be praising jesus say oh this is so wonderful praise god i'm so full of the love of god eyes not seen ears not heard the things that god has in store for them that love him oh my praise god i just thought of you that really blessed me i was listening that on the way to church tonight so asher uh let's let's uh let's uh here i don't know if i can do that let's go i'll go to genesis 30 verse 12 and 13. let's look at asher he was uh one of the twelve sons of jacob genesis 30 12 and 13. and zilpah least made bearer jacob a second son and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name asher so what does asher mean it just means happy leah was so happy that her mate had a baby and she said lord i'm happy i'm gonna name him asher because that means i'm happy she was happy to have children now today they don't want children right that's why they abort them right that's why they uh they'll take birth control pills they don't want them but in the bible days that was a huge blessing now if we made mistakes god gives us forgiveness praise god right there's forgiveness but there's also grace to know the truth and believe the truth and live the truth hallelujah children were a blessing then god said children are still blessing today praise god hallelujah now the prophecy of jacob was genesis 49 verse 20. first book of the bible chapter 49 verse 20. out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal dainties okay so we've never really heard that fat bread right we never really heard about that but it just means that the bread will be the best bread you're going to ever want to find praise god this tribe this man was going to produce such bread and bread was a daily substance right that was a daily necessity you had to have bread at the table every day but this bread was just not going to be a regular bread it was going to be the best bread in other words they were going to pay such attention to detail the very simple things of life were going to be the very best things of life they weren't going to cut corners they were to make everything in life just a beautiful blessing they were the very best they could with whatever they had how many want to live like that we want to live the best we can with what god has given to us amen this was ashes and uh the next one and he shall yield royal dainties so there seems to be some connection with royalty now remember no kings came out of asher but they must have been a bunch of chefs praise god and they would make the finest foods for royalty right remember king saul said if i become king i'm taking your daughters to cook for me where do they get where to get all these good uh menus where they got these good recipes from asher's tribe history says their children were the most beautiful children their children knew the most about food see we've heard about all these warriors right that can catch arrows and all these strong tribes but here's one that they focused on the food they were gifted in the area of service food service and by the holy spirit god looked at them and said they're going to make the bread fat and they're going to do royal dainties they're going to be such wonderful servants unto the kings in queens see because god needs everybody needs a place right we all got to have a place we all can't be kings right we all can't be president we all can't be mayor we all can't be pastor right we all can't be the the top person but god has a special place and god was really going to honor asher because what they were called to do they did it well church how many want to do well what god's called you to do does anybody want to do an average job for god well i just i just did what i had to do to get by or do you want to specialize in it i don't want to preach average sermons i want to preach sermons that change people's lives amen that's why i study that's why i pray that's why i preach as much as i do because i want to see it beautiful i want to see it beyond just what you'd hear at a regular church i want to see the holy spirit give people this fat bread amen hallelujah this wonderful sermon where they can eat here they can feast on the word of god it's royal food it's royal food for the priesthood of god amen hallelujah praise god it's not just a common i've heard that sermon before but you're going to hear something new it's going to be so rich amen it's going to be so good you're going to enjoy it you're going to know this is a special word of god that's how i want to live as a preacher now how about you as a father as a grandfather as a worker on your job what kind of servant are you going to be for christ are you an average worker how about our students we got a lot of young kids what kind of student you want to be you want to be a c student now that's all your ability wonderful that that's all god's given you because not everybody has academic skill like that some people more have more music skill right or artistic skill or singing or all these other talents that they have but in other words how do we want to serve god do you want to have a just common everyday kind of christian thing or do you want to be someone who really does well what god's called them to do how do you want to do well see here's what we see he would be linked to food his ministry was in food ministry now notice church where does he live by he lives right by the sea right by the sea so that that gives him what fish all kinds of uh seafood dishes so he's got bread he's got royal dainties things that these other guys that you know they don't live by the big ocean or the big sea they don't get any of that they have such dainties they have special foods that the other ones don't give and god called them to that right remember we saw that some of these warriors remember uh some of these other warriors remember god was going to have all these wars well look do they live by the ocean no they weren't called to do that church god has called you to do something that only many times only you know what it is and whatever you do the bible says do it with all your heart that's how it's under the mj if you called if you're called to be a doctor brother do the very best you can you'd be a christian doctor because there's a bunch of heathen doctors out there i'm a schoolteacher i want to be a christian school teacher i don't want to be a heathen school teacher praise god you be the very best you can be do something special praise god let everybody see that there's something different about you god's god's spirit is in your life he's called you to do something different and you're making an impact and you're doing something different than others because you've got god behind you amen hallelujah let's go to deuteronomy 33 24. this was our text right i'm trying to close i'm trying to bring this down to close give me about maybe 10 more minutes thank the lord yeah i'm sorry deuteronomy 33 verse 24 and 25. sorry about that brother it was the same one we read tonight but we're finally getting back to that and of asher so this is moses years after the previous one uh genesis 49 was uh uh asher's dad jacob well here now we're at moses after asher died and now his his his descendants here are getting prophecy uh verse 24. and if ashley said let asher be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his brethren let him dip his foot in oil thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy strength be church i don't know about you but did anybody hear anything negative in that prophecy by the way and there's some people hallelujah god's going to have prophecy about their lives and it's all blessings and that's not because god likes them more it's because god knows they're going to be faithful with what he gives them and when they're faithful with the little god will bless them with more praise god nothing evil said about asher he's the youngest of leah you know kind of despised not the favorite you know wife different side of the family but god has all these blessings on asher he's going to do fat bread amen he's going to do royal dainties he's going to be blessed with children while other tribes maybe have lots of miscarriages asher's going to have a bunch of children and the bible said children are arrows of the lord that defeat the enemies praise god your children are your weapons praise god hallelujah they're weapons that take down the kingdom of satan and raise up the kingdom of god amen that's why you sharpen your arrows praise god that's why you make sure they're ready to go praise god so when you shoot them out when they're 16 or 17 or 18 they really hit the target and they can do some damage in the kingdom of the kingdom of satan like my mom my mom drugged my mom dragged six all six of her kids to church every sunday and now when she shot them out now three of them are preachers and they're tearing down satan's kingdom praise god amen the arrows have been shot out and they're hitting the target amen where people are being saved forgiven filled with the holy ghost baptized in jesus christ's day because one mother sharpened the arrows amen she saw her arrows as a blessing and not a curse not only that he's going to be acceptable his brethren are going to just he they're just going to love him i'm so glad you're my brother you're just a blessing to me my when i when i was down you were right where right there right when i needed you you were a brother you helped me out of debt right you picked me up when i needed to be picked up you were just right there thanks for being a brother that's what he's going to be he's going to be acceptable to his brethren so everybody in the family is going to love this guy he's got all the blessings he's got the food he's skilled in his food he prepares it he takes special time he's really focused on his ministry amen hallelujah praise god and he's really good to his siblings and he's blessed with a large family oh hallelujah thank god amen and then he dips his foot in oil now this is a natural but i see a spiritual i don't know in other words that olive trees right that's how you get olive oil olive trees you got to pick the olives go step on them and out of the bat comes olive oil so he would have his foot in oil remember when jesus was here on earth and he came into simon the pharisee's house and they didn't they didn't wash his feet with oil they didn't anoint his head with oil but not asher's house asher's house was gonna have his foot dipped in oil in other words he was gonna be clean amen hallelujah he had oil he would all the sweat was gonna be gone all the dirt was gonna be gone he was presenting himself like he was royalty praise god amen he wasn't but he was presenting himself like he was he was cleaned up you can tell the blessing of god was upon his life amen hallelujah now what does this mean for us it means for us yes we want to have clean clothes yes we want to take a shower and brush our stinky teeth in the morning yes we want to do that but this means our foot is in oil this means we're blessed and our lives are are dipped into the holy spirit praise god we have the holy spirit flowing here and what is it doing it's healing it's saving it's forgiving it's leading it's guiding it's placing praise god it's giving you a place in the body of christ you've got your foot in it you're standing in it praise god church we're standing in the blessing of god tonight hallelujah we're standing in his blessings he had his foot dipped in oil praise god in other words we're gonna wash jesus's feet we're gonna anoint jesus feet with her head with oil praise god we're gonna have the holy spirit amongst us praise god hallelujah his shoes will be iron and brass so in other words this this land right by the sea it would have oil olive trees he'd have bread he'd have fish he'd have royal dainties he had all these blessings of life plus when he started digging the ground he'd come across precious metals and then he'd take those and he could sell him whoever he wants no doubt the guys that were doing swords right because these guys weren't the big warriors right but they had they found all these medals under there and they say praise god now we got these and we're just they're under our feet praise god the blessings ah the blessings are above us the blessings are around us and the blessings are under us in other words we're surrounded by the blessings of god amen everywhere i will look there's blessings in my life i look at my family i look at my job i look at my bank account now that's not for everybody all the time we go through trials but everywhere asher looked there was blessings amen hallelujah because he loved the lord he kept the word the bible said if you obey the word you're blessed the bible says if you break the word your curse let us obey the word and be blessed hallelujah i'm not talking about being millionaires and not nonsense like that remember solomon the wisest man ever he said lord don't make me poor that i steal but don't make me rich that i forget about you so if you've got just that in between you ought to shout hallelujah tonight hallelujah praise god amen i don't have too much that i think well now i can figure it out now i'm good at uh investments now i'm good at at bitcoin right or now i'm good at the stock market no no no well i ain't good at nothing it's all jesus amen i want what god has for me i don't want to be rich i don't want to be poor i want to be blessed i want to do what god's called me to do like before i wrote this book and sister uh you're welcome to have one for free if you want if you're a reader if not the audiobook's free online but before i wrote this i said lord i have a burden to share that the mystery of god is finished i didn't know how much it was going to cost but then a few years later people started sending me money just for the book to make it i got 6 800 in the mail and i didn't ask for one penny see because when god wants to do something he's going to send you the blessing you're going to find some under you you're going to find some above you you're going to find it there you're going to find it here and there why because you're walking in the obedience of god and you're unit to god and god is going to use you because you're an example you're walking in the light praise god you're not in darkness you're walking the light praise god so this church didn't pay one ascent for that six thousand eight hundred dollars that it costs to make that book because when god wants to do something oh the blessings are coming the bible says they chase you down they're going to they're just going to come and chase you down all the blessings are going to come looking for you when you honor jesus christ and you obey his word and when you really love him he said you'll keep my commands amen hallelujah and then the blessings of god will shower down upon you or like when we have a sick man like jose had glaucoma he's not here tonight he's a spanish brother from nicaragua he had glaucoma and he come up crying here back in january or was it february he said brother they said i got glaucoma i'm gonna lose my eyesight he don't have insurance sounds like a pretty bad deal doesn't it amen but i was just preaching on blessings and curses at the end of 2020. and i called brother johnny up i think i called brother amen up and i said let's pray let's rebuke this glaucoma in jesus christ's name so we prayed the prayer of faith we anointed with oil we're crying we're praising god saying god please heal him god have your will he went to the doctor a month later and they said we don't know what happened in the machines we don't know what happened on all the records but you don't have glaucoma praise god that's a blessing for being in the commands of god for obeying god we love jesus so we keep his commands amen that's one of the blessings of being a lover of jesus christ and loving the light and hating the darkness remember when johnny you guys remember when johnny walked in here his ankle church there's my ankle his ankle was about three times that size and he said he'd been taking all these things and it wasn't working but i preached some little message i think it was on joshua and he come up after service he said brother i know if you curse this i'm going to be healed curse that infection and i know i'm going to be healed now at that point i was a little nervous you know because he had more faith than i did but i didn't look at my faith church i looked at the word of god because it's not about my faith it's about his faith all we have to do is obey the word of god so i prayed i touched that ankle and i said i rebuked that infection in jesus christ's name and may our brother be healed he said he walked back to his seat right back here it was either one of these right here and he said while he was standing praying he could feel the healing taking place and the next day he said it was 95 healed on a monday morning praise god by the end of the week it was back to normal what is that that's the power of christ amen that's the blessing of jesus christ why because we walk in the light we keep his commands and all these blessings will be around us and lastly let's send to our faith lastly he said i'll give you strength according to thy days in other words church you and i have a certain number of days god is the only one who knows that number but because asher was going to be so faithful his children were going to be blessed he's going to make the most delicious bread he's going to have royal dainties seafoods that only fit for the king he's going to have children all around him his brothers and sisters are going to love him he's going to be a family man ah hallelujah don't you see yourself in some of these churches your brothers sisters might not even be believers but somehow they love you amen hallelujah because you've got the blessing of god on your life praise god god and church is not that you necessarily you did it it's god called you to it praise god god wanted you to do that and god gave you strength to do it and the bible says this last thing he says you'll have strength according to thy days in other words god says i know the exact numbers of days jesse has and because i know this number i'm going to give him strength to glorify me in every single day all the years of his life sound familiar caleb said i'm 85 and i'm just as strong when i was 45. he said come give me that mountain come on giants come over here i'm ready to whip you now amen i'm just as strong as i was at 85. john wesley was 88 years old and he said i'm just as strong as i was when i was 40 praise god all because he loved jesus christ all because he kept the commands of god i don't plan on getting weaker i might get more gray hair sister but i ain't going to get weaker i'm only going to get stronger praise god that's that's my confession i've got to take care of myself i got to do my part if i sin i'm going to get cursed it's going to be a temporary curse not an eternal curse but there's temporary uh there's temporary consequences to decisions that doesn't mean i'm lost but there are consequences but if i obey the word and i daily stay in the light i'm gonna stay in your life jesus i'm gonna find the i'm gonna stay in your life forgive me god empower me today let me let my foot be an oil let my brother love me let me love my children let there be brass and iron under my feet just give me everything i need as long as i'm walking the light as he's in the light then the bible says the blood of jesus christ will cleanse me from all unrighteousness and he can give me strength for each day about 15 no about 10 years ago we had a guy visit our other church when naomi first came on a wednesday night a truck driver and he looked at me preaching like this i was spitting all over the place i was screaming he said let me tell you you're wrong he said if you keep preaching like that you're gonna burn out in one year and i said sir i've already been preaching like this for seven years and here i stand eight years later fifteen years of preaching i haven't lost one bit of strength have i hallelujah because god said if you obey the word i'm giving you strength according to your years hallelujah every year you live i've given you straight to overcome to fulfill my plan for your life amen who's giving it to us god is giving it to us how many love god tonight musicians can come let's get ready to pray and see if anyone needs any special prayer tonight hallelujah i'll stop right there by god's grace i just went over a little bit i tried to preach off the inspiration of the holy spirit tonight and church i hope you can see i hope you can see by god's grace what god has called you to do now i'm sorry switch over let me show one more thing here before i i quit this is the this is the revelation that god gave me a spiritual revelation hallelujah that's right now this is brazil and i'm i'm not really using brazil this is a brazil map but i'm saying spiritually you and i need to possess all of our land the land you need to possess is to love jesus christ in your relationships just like asher glory his brethren loved him he had all kinds of children that must be meant he was faithful to his wife that must have meant he betrayed his brothers pretty well wasn't a backstabber right he was honest with his brothers and sisters he possessed that spiritual land that's what god wants us to do ministries if you're called to be a preacher if you're not if you're called to be a prayer warrior and the church said if you're called to have words of wisdom or words of knowledge or speak in tongues or prophesy or if you're called to do miracles and the church said that's your ministry you got to possess that you have to learn more about that and you have to possess that land i got to glorify god in my relationships i have to learn how to glorify god in the ministries he's given to me next vocation i gotta learn to glorify god on my job i'm a schoolteacher i have to glorify jesus christ at the school so pick your job you gotta possess that land you can't let the devil tear you down at your job you gotta rise up above him you got to pray until that boss leaves that that satan worshiping boss can i say like that you got to pray until that tempter leaves praise god you got to pray until you get the promotion or you got to pray to have grace to stay in your position because a promotion might exalt you into pride praise god the bible said you give a preacher a pastor too soon he's gonna fall away because he's a novice he's gonna get prideful lifted up if you get power too soon church many times we get pride for we get lifted up like look what i did you didn't do nothing all you did was just love jesus that's all you did but god is the one orchestrating all the events in your life he's letting you run into this person on the job he's protecting you from that right he's saving you from that he's guiding you there he's giving you the wisdom to do that praise god he's the one guided because he has the plan he has the master plan he's giving strength to your days hallelujah and then the gifts of the holy spirit yeah i mentioned that and then location god is going to place you in akron ohio maybe for your life or maybe for a time or season i've been here now for what i got here in 1999 the fall of 1999. so i've been here about 21 22 years i possessed i didn't leave i didn't run away from the pastor job when the things were hard but there wasn't really many people coming to church right we didn't really seem to have revival going on i didn't quit and give up i i kept the land i kept standing i kept preaching i kept praying i kept fighting off the enemy at every one of the steps now church you place yourself there that's what god wants for you tonight god wants you to possess all his will for your life amen let's bow our heads here just play at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light just play that softly so i'm using church this aster to say if god could bless a man like that in the old testament what about today under the blood of jesus christ they had lambs and bullocks and doves they killed animals but we have jesus christ the lamb of god and we are under that bloody sacrifice the son of god jesus christ but just sing this real softly with your head [Music] it was there by faith i received [Music] i preach hard tonight on wednesday
