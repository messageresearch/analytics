[0:00] and so there was a Gentleman on YouTube
[0:01] he asked me to make a video on it last
[0:03] week and I was like well I kind of felt
[0:05] led to go that way he said uh can can
[0:09] God save a
[0:10] backslider he said I want to know
[0:12] something about this topic so I thought
[0:14] well I'd like to know something about
[0:15] that too praise God so I trust to be a
[0:18] blessing here by God's grace Hosea 14
[0:21] ver4
[0:38] there's a beautiful verse here let's
[0:39] read this if we can on three ready one
[0:42] two three I will heal their backsliding
[0:45] I will love them freely for mine anger
[0:49] is turned away from him amen how many
[0:51] have a need today Hallelujah let's bow
[0:53] our hearts let's pray one more time here
[0:55] by God's grace father God we thank you
[0:56] Lord God that we're living in the
[0:57] Overflow Lord and as we can see Lord do
[1:00] how it applies here Lord God you give us
[1:01] Grace Grace there shoutings unto The
[1:04] Headstone as you return saying Grace
[1:06] Grace unto it The Headstone so we shout
[1:09] thank you Lord for your grace thank you
[1:11] for Amazing Grace Lord as we saw a few
[1:14] weeks ago Lord in James where it says he
[1:16] giveth more grace Lord God am so we
[1:18] thank you Lord God that we see it in the
[1:20] scripture Lord God and Father I just
[1:22] felt inspired Lord God as I pray you
[1:24] take this Lord God and Lord it would
[1:26] help our church Lord God I feel like
[1:27] it's helped me already Lord God to
[1:30] understand Lord these scriptures and
[1:32] these quotes Lord God so take Lord this
[1:34] word take my humble little efforts Lord
[1:36] God I pray you bless it to your people
[1:38] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[1:39] said amen God bless you as you're being
[1:41] seated praise
[1:44] God I'm just going to check and see if
[1:46] there's any other prayer requests okay
[1:47] that was
[1:53] it
[1:54] hallelujah praise God so this thought
[1:58] like I said I've mentioned you know
[1:59] backsliding over the years you know I've
[2:01] of course I've always known about it it
[2:02] was in the Bible but I've never studied
[2:04] it uh as I studied it I went and saw
[2:06] that there was 16 verses in the Old
[2:09] Testament that Ed the word backsliding
[2:12] and so I'd never gone through it before
[2:14] as far as like all 16 in a row so I was
[2:16] encouraged to do that and uh I thought
[2:18] it would be applied I thought it would
[2:19] apply very well you know I feel like by
[2:21] God's grace we've got to the deeper
[2:22] things you know we're getting the deeper
[2:24] things of God even a few weeks ago we
[2:25] looked at uh the secret believer that's
[2:27] a deeper thought I've never had that
[2:29] thought before I felt like it was from
[2:31] the Lord you know in time and season of
[2:33] course I've heard brother Ram say that I
[2:34] think that's how it is with all of us
[2:35] right we hear things but there's a
[2:37] moment where it becomes quickened to us
[2:39] right and then we understand that from
[2:41] that point on so I feel like God is
[2:42] taking us deeper he promised to do that
[2:45] he said he'd guide us into all truth and
[2:47] we know that means all things that
[2:48] pertain to life and godliness so
[2:51] remember Martin Luther he was guided
[2:52] into all truth of what God wanted to
[2:54] show him in that day right so here we
[2:57] are today what day is it it's the
[2:58] finishing of the mystery of God hallah
[3:00] it's Rapture time amen hopefully in our
[3:02] generation if not we'll keep pressing on
[3:04] we'll get the Next Generation ready
[3:05] right get Malachi and Casa Lydia all
[3:07] these I always name the oldest ones but
[3:09] we're getting them ready Hallelujah for
[3:11] the Next Generation Hallelujah that's
[3:12] what we're called to do that's what
[3:13] brother bam said remember brother Bram
[3:14] said brother Jose he said if Orman
[3:17] Neville and I leave off the scene we've
[3:18] left footprints in the sands of time
[3:20] amen for the Next Generation those
[3:22] Footprints never said just press Play
[3:24] Hallelujah Hallelujah so I just thought
[3:27] throw a little joke in there you know um
[3:30] but yeah this was a great thought I've
[3:31] never uh looked at it before I thought
[3:32] it would tie in really good you know
[3:34] with the the grace series the message of
[3:36] Grace so uh so I would preach that now I
[3:39] got a lot more quotes than I put on the
[3:40] video just I think it was a I maybe a 20
[3:43] minute video I don't know a short video
[3:44] I put out yesterday I got that study
[3:46] done so I hope you got your Bibles ready
[3:48] we'll probably be turning lots of
[3:49] scriptures here and it just gives us a
[3:51] way I'll say like this it gives us a way
[3:53] to define things that we all go through
[3:56] especially the quote where brother Ram
[3:57] says in 1954 he said I backslide every
[4:01] day what does that mean you know if you
[4:03] look at the Bible what exactly does that
[4:05] mean and I think as I go through this I
[4:07] think we'll understand it quite plainly
[4:09] It lines up with everything that we've
[4:10] ever believed by God's grace
[4:12] so because because what I'm saying is it
[4:14] doesn't mean well you could go out and
[4:16] murder somebody well that's that's my
[4:17] backsliding today well I'm back today
[4:19] you know that's not what it means right
[4:22] it means it goes back to that topic
[4:23] remember of major sins and minor sins
[4:25] remember that made a video about that
[4:27] earlier this year as well and that's
[4:29] true because the Bible Jesus said the
[4:31] Pharisees get a greater damnation right
[4:34] because they knew more of the word they
[4:35] were the leaders of that day right right
[4:38] and so there's degrees right there's
[4:39] degrees so it ties in very good by God's
[4:42] grace so Hallelujah now I want to uh if
[4:44] I could let's just start with the uh the
[4:47] Hebrew word for backslide means to turn
[4:49] away or apostate so it means to turn
[4:52] away all right so if we're walking
[4:55] towards God uh to backslide means to
[4:57] turn away I'm not going to follow God
[4:59] anymore more I'm going to do what I want
[5:01] to do praise God so that's what that's
[5:03] what it means and church before I get
[5:04] too far don't forget Jonah was a
[5:07] backslider Hallelujah Abraham was a
[5:10] backslider and yet he's in the Hall of
[5:12] Fame of
[5:13] Faith now what do I mean I mean backslid
[5:16] in in minor
[5:18] sins right did they have major sins yes
[5:20] they had major sins especially Moses
[5:22] murdering a man right and got should
[5:24] have killed him because he didn't
[5:25] circumcise his son I mean they had major
[5:27] sins but God forgave him those but in
[5:29] the moments when they backslid they were
[5:32] minor sins I guess except for David so
[5:34] I'm going to stud that I just thought of
[5:35] David real quick here my favorite Bible
[5:38] character is David you know that was a
[5:39] major major sin that was definitely a
[5:41] backsliding so but of course that's
[5:43] under the Old Testament right that's not
[5:44] under the blood of Jesus Christ so
[5:46] that's how I look at that one here as
[5:47] I'm just thinking about that I never
[5:48] thought about David here coming in here
[5:51] so uh we see Hebrew means to turn away
[5:54] or apostate so I would like to uh just
[5:57] go down through some scriptures here so
[5:59] let's start in
[6:00] uh Proverbs Proverbs
[6:03] 14:14 and we'll see all the verses on
[6:12] backsliding there's a quote I'm not
[6:14] going to put it I'm not going to read it
[6:15] but brother bam said if I ever get to
[6:17] the spot where I do not preach the
[6:19] supernatural power of the Holy Ghost he
[6:21] said tell me I'm
[6:23] backslid amen so if brother Ram said if
[6:25] I ever get to the spot where I say these
[6:27] signs don't follow them that believe
[6:29] brother Bram said you come tell me I'm
[6:31] backslid Hallelujah so I like I like I
[6:34] like to look how did Brother Ram apply
[6:35] this to himself right so we'll get to
[6:38] that here by God's grace but Proverbs
[6:39] 14:14 said the backslider in heart shall
[6:43] be filled with his own ways all right
[6:46] and a good man shall be satisfied from
[6:50] himself so we got two I love what
[6:52] Proverbs does Proverbs always contrasts
[6:54] good and evil right the wise and the
[6:56] foolish remember we preached on that oh
[6:57] it's been years ago I think maybe the
[6:59] first year William ever came and saw us
[7:00] you know preached a whole series on the
[7:02] Book of Proverbs and uh but the
[7:04] backslider is filled with his own ways
[7:06] so it's it's the opposite of being
[7:08] filled with God's ways right so when
[7:10] when a person will backslide I'll say
[7:12] like this it's most of you know it's
[7:14] it's many people we know that we're in
[7:15] the church and now they don't go to
[7:17] church anymore that's what I'm talking
[7:18] about but but don't forget the Pharisees
[7:20] they could be in the church and fully
[7:23] backsliding right you understand you
[7:24] know they were so far backsliding the
[7:26] Bible called it perpetual backsliding
[7:29] and we'll get to that as well by God's
[7:30] grace so it's important to know these
[7:32] things it's important to know our our
[7:34] terminology it's extremely important to
[7:36] know terminology praise God why would
[7:38] God give us words that they're not
[7:39] important and then God would say if you
[7:40] take one away if you add one he said
[7:42] you'll lose all these things or you'll
[7:43] be added plagues right so every word of
[7:46] God is crucial praise God God gives us
[7:49] understanding so a a backslider is one
[7:52] who will always do his ways now we see
[7:55] it you know around us we see it we'd say
[7:56] backsliders we going to church but then
[7:58] they leave and they go out and sexual
[7:59] sin or something like that that's a
[8:01] really common example right we've seen
[8:03] it you know people will take a
[8:05] relationship it's ungodly relationship
[8:07] but they'll take that relationship
[8:09] they'll leave the ways of God and that
[8:10] faulty that sinful relationship will
[8:12] cause them to backslide on God they
[8:13] don't they're not filled with God's ways
[8:15] anymore right they're filled with their
[8:17] own ways that's a very obvious one to
[8:20] see it's like the example we'll get to
[8:21] in 1 Corinthians 5 the man sleeping with
[8:24] his uh mother-in-law right was that
[8:26] right no stepmother sorry yeah got that
[8:29] mixed up there but you see that you see
[8:32] that uh he's filled with his own ways
[8:34] and yet that man still came to church
[8:36] what did Paul say you were puffed up in
[8:38] your sin you weren't mourning over your
[8:40] sin see sin should always make us mourn
[8:42] Hallelujah and if not then that's some
[8:44] our hearts got to be changed praise God
[8:46] we got to be washed in the blood amen
[8:48] right I'm talking about me I'm talking
[8:49] about all of us amen amen our attitudes
[8:52] towards sin Hallelujah so that's the
[8:55] first verse there I think that's the
[8:56] first time the Bible quotes backsliding
[8:59] all right now let's go to a few here
[9:00] let's go to uh Jeremiah
[9:02] 2:19 yeah I'm going to put this in a
[9:05] little different order than my video did
[9:06] anybody watch the video yesterday
[9:07] anybody watch it Jose did all right okay
[9:10] well good only one person watch it well
[9:11] I feel better amen I don't want to give
[9:13] you the double if you already watch it
[9:15] but like I said I add more quotes by
[9:16] God's
[9:18] grace Jeremiah
[9:21] 21:19 says thine own wickedness shall
[9:24] correct thee because remember God said
[9:26] God shall not be mocked a man uh reaps
[9:29] what he
[9:30] SWS right so God lets all these people
[9:32] know here's where you went wrong right
[9:34] there
[9:35] right and thy back siding shall reprove
[9:39] thee so there God God puts a what he's
[9:41] he calls it a conscience in every mind
[9:43] right brother M calls it a stoplight and
[9:45] God you know when we backslide we see
[9:47] the stoplight saying stop stop don't go
[9:49] this way stop don't go this way and yet
[9:51] if the person goes through it there's a
[9:53] witness God gave them a witness to stop
[9:54] but they went right through it so our
[9:57] backslidings you know that's why God
[9:58] gives us human Spirit right to correct
[10:00] to meditate on things so we can be
[10:02] corrected then he says know therefore
[10:05] and see that it is an evil thing and
[10:06] bitter that thou has forsaken the Lord
[10:09] thy God and that my fear is not in thee
[10:13] sayith the Lord of hosts I thought this
[10:14] was a great scripture because it brings
[10:17] in how does a person get backslide they
[10:19] lose the fear of the
[10:21] Lord right so then they think you know a
[10:23] backslider thinks well uh even if I do
[10:26] this I know it's against the word of God
[10:27] even if I do this there's going to be no
[10:29] rep repercussions toward everything's
[10:30] going to keep going good and the Bible
[10:32] said that's impossible right Bible says
[10:35] that's impossible Hallelujah the fear of
[10:37] the Lord he he says the fear of the Lord
[10:39] is not in thee sayeth the Lord of hosts
[10:42] okay so this is a person doing evil
[10:44] things like we said sexual sins all
[10:45] kinds of things forsaking the Lord thy
[10:47] God see uh the Pharisees forsook God
[10:50] right G God's right there Jesus is right
[10:52] there amen and they forsake Him right
[10:54] they uh they won't worship him they only
[10:56] come to criticize him they only come to
[10:58] try to trap him and all these things you
[11:00] know so we can see it plainly here
[11:02] backsliding is losing the fear of the
[11:05] Lord hallelujah I preach a couple
[11:07] sermons on that a few years ago really
[11:09] memorable s you know and what's amazing
[11:10] church I'm just going to share this here
[11:12] what's amazing I got that sermon I was
[11:15] inspired from that sermon by uh just an
[11:17] internet preacher who's not in the
[11:18] message and that preacher this week just
[11:22] got kicked out of his Pastor position
[11:23] because of sexual immorality and he was
[11:26] texting me and I thought he wanted to
[11:27] get on my YouTube channel to build his
[11:29] platform but I never let him I never
[11:31] invited him on there and then he was
[11:33] making all these false prophecies and
[11:34] everything like that I don't know if you
[11:35] saw in the news um well it would have to
[11:38] be religious news you know but it was it
[11:40] was just you know just amazing you know
[11:43] uh how someone can be under the spirit
[11:45] of God uh so under the spirit of God and
[11:48] then like this man sell it out for uh a
[11:51] little mo few moments a month of sexual
[11:54] immorality but yet what he preached was
[11:56] right the fear of the Lord and then he
[11:59] lost the fear of the Lord that shows his
[12:01] soul is not born again we need Born
[12:03] Again Souls hallelujah amen we need an
[12:05] anchor like brother B said I need an
[12:06] anchor so uh when the Temptation comes
[12:09] that anchor will hold me that anchor
[12:11] will keep me from the sin amen that's
[12:14] why we got in Jesus amen amen Jesus is
[12:17] our anchor hallelujah amen that's what
[12:19] we got we got to Anchor hallelujah amen
[12:22] in the storms of life Christ is my
[12:25] anchor that's right amen that's all it
[12:28] could be amen it's
[12:29] Jesus right and I like this scripture
[12:32] brother I'm brother Willi I just heard a
[12:34] brother say it uh the Bible said when we
[12:36] were without strength Christ died the
[12:39] righteous for the righteous so that
[12:41] proves right there I like the brother
[12:43] emphasized it he said without strength
[12:45] we have no strength to be healed we have
[12:47] no strength to be saved we have no
[12:48] strength to do anything if anything good
[12:50] comes out of our life it was God giving
[12:52] us strength hallelujah amen praise
[12:55] God the strength of the Lord and the joy
[12:58] of the Lord is your strength
[13:00] amen that's why we lose strength because
[13:02] we lose the joy of the Lord Look What
[13:04] the Lord Has Done
[13:06] amen Look What the Lord Has Done
[13:09] Hallelujah but in this case again uh Old
[13:12] Testament Jeremiah's time that's kind of
[13:13] what that uh Daniel Daniel's connected
[13:15] in there you
[13:17] know uh Daniel was prophesying course to
[13:19] the people in Babylon uh Jeremiah was
[13:22] right there in Jerusalem until they he
[13:24] was taken out Ezekiel he was over there
[13:26] in I think in Assyria uh ministering to
[13:28] the the there so there's three different
[13:30] prophets on the earth at one time right
[13:32] we talked about that a little a few
[13:33] weeks ago by God's grace so we see there
[13:36] backsliders get full of their own ways
[13:38] they don't do the ways of the Lord uh
[13:40] they lose the fear of the Lord
[13:43] hallelujah now let's look at I'm just
[13:45] going right through if I can go right in
[13:46] order Jeremiah 3:6 H pull that
[13:53] up okay yeah I see where we're Jeremiah
[13:56] 36 the Lord also said unto me in the
[13:59] days of Josiah the king hast thou seen
[14:01] that which backsliding Israel has done
[14:03] she's gone up upon every high mountain
[14:05] and under every Green Tree and there
[14:08] hath played the Harlot so remember in
[14:10] those days you know Israel in order to
[14:12] do uh idolatry they just wouldn't do it
[14:14] out in the open till the days of Solomon
[14:16] right remember Solomon Solomon built the
[14:19] the idols right there right next to the
[14:21] house of God that's how open and
[14:23] unashamedly he was
[14:25] backsliding but they would uh they would
[14:28] they would hide their sin they would go
[14:30] up in the forest and like people still
[14:32] do today you know they hide away in
[14:34] their uh their clubs you know their
[14:37] their evil spaces you know and they have
[14:38] all these Wicked seances and Witchcraft
[14:41] and so forth like that but it's the same
[14:42] idea they got to hide away they won't do
[14:44] it they're out in the public but we're
[14:45] here to Worship in public amen
[14:47] hallelujah Glory this church floods One
[14:50] More Time Well Services right out there
[14:52] in public again
[14:53] amen I tell you they need to get a new
[14:55] plumber I think is what happens that's
[14:57] just my opinion but notice it's every
[14:59] Green Tree you know so they were people
[15:01] were just sin everywhere you know they
[15:03] they were uh worshiping Idols everywhere
[15:05] and I said after she had done all these
[15:07] things in verse 7 turn thou unto me and
[15:09] she returned not and her treacherous
[15:11] Judah her sister Judah saw and I saw
[15:14] when all the causes whereby backsliding
[15:16] Israel committed adultery I had put her
[15:19] away and given her a bill of divorce yet
[15:21] her treacherous sister Judah feared not
[15:23] but went and played the hearta also so
[15:26] here we get we have two backsliders
[15:28] right we have uh Israel and
[15:31] Judah right so and notice God says when
[15:34] a when a when a a people won't repent he
[15:37] divorces them right now he did that to
[15:41] Israel and I'll say like this he did
[15:43] that to the
[15:44] denominations because this is the leoan
[15:46] church age and he said I'm spewing you
[15:49] out of my mouth in other words you're
[15:51] not the bride you refuse the word of the
[15:54] Bride but I going to get me a bride
[15:56] Hallelujah I'm going to send down my
[15:57] book to Earth I'm going to have my
[15:59] seventh angel preaching I'm going to
[16:00] have people eat the book hallelujah amen
[16:04] and then they're going to prophesy again
[16:05] to every Kindred Nation people in tongue
[16:08] and then before the Rapture the spirit
[16:09] and the bride will say come hallelujah
[16:12] amen so the voice is in the bride amen
[16:16] that's right can see it there so see
[16:19] major backsliding that's what I'm going
[16:20] to be emphasizing today there's major
[16:22] and minor major backsliding caused God
[16:25] to divorce Israel and divorce of course
[16:27] the denominational churches
[16:29] today Hallelujah now verse 12 Jeremiah
[16:32] 3:12 go and Proclaim these words toward
[16:34] the North and say return now look God is
[16:36] still gracious God is still saying
[16:38] return like this wasn't you know one
[16:40] time they went up to a tree and they
[16:42] bowed down and worshiped uh we'll say
[16:44] the the god of Asher or asure that was
[16:47] the uh the Assyrian God of War so Israel
[16:50] would they they would stop trusting in
[16:52] Jehovah and they go up and they go up in
[16:54] in a tree uh they bow down to the tree
[16:56] and and put their Idol out there and say
[16:57] I worship you usua our wor protect us
[16:59] from our
[17:00] enemies and it just wasn't one time it
[17:03] was under every tree and God still says
[17:07] come back to me praise God God still
[17:10] says return to me amen that's a god of
[17:13] love amen
[17:14] hallelujah amenah I'm going to correct
[17:17] this now because I keep quoting the
[17:19] wrong scripture amen I uh Isaiah 571
[17:22] pulled up there and if a Son of God or
[17:25] daughter of God gets out of course and
[17:27] won't repent God in his Mercy will take
[17:29] them off the scene Hallelujah in order
[17:31] to show them Mercy to keep them from the
[17:33] evil that's to come hallelujah amen
[17:36] right there it is I keep I kept saying
[17:38] Ezekiel I'm not going to say Ezekiel
[17:39] anymore I'm going to write down and
[17:40] memorize it it's Isaiah 571 the
[17:42] righteous perisheth and no man layth it
[17:44] to heart and merciful men are taken away
[17:47] see see there's people see church let me
[17:49] just say like God might we preached on
[17:52] gifts on Wednesday night you know God's
[17:53] given us all gifts one of your gifts
[17:55] might be to show Mercy now it's you know
[17:58] it's it's one of the gifts you know
[17:59] whether a Word of Faith or knowledge or
[18:01] wisdom or healing Faith you know people
[18:05] so there's God takes people that are
[18:07] known for being merciful god will take
[18:09] them off the scene before it's their
[18:10] time think about all these people in the
[18:12] message I even showed some of them to
[18:13] you that died at a young age of 40 from
[18:15] cancer the different things they're
[18:16] known to be merciful people they're
[18:18] known to be good
[18:19] people but but the Bible says nobody
[18:22] considers that that God takes them away
[18:25] from some other evil that might come in
[18:27] their life CU God knows whether the
[18:28] devil wants to
[18:30] do right so we must to remember that as
[18:34] well I didn't want to that just came to
[18:36] me that's not my notes but I just want
[18:37] to I want to remember Isaiah 571 because
[18:39] you know why because people have rough
[18:40] times yes the next person uh you know
[18:43] next person we know of all our friends
[18:45] like just happened there with the the
[18:46] lake the next person we know we want to
[18:48] remember this God knows what he's doing

[19:07] life but I'm just talking about it's a
[19:08] reminder about the Frailty of life and
[19:11] that when something happened I'm sure
[19:13] William and beatric have seen people
[19:14] over the years passed away unexpectedly
[19:16] we have this confidence God knew all
[19:18] about it praise God God gives God takes

[19:53] the picture there got the Mount of
[19:54] Olives and they got the Temple Mount
[19:55] every tree there had an idol under and

[21:33] city on a hill there were supposed to be
[21:34] a light to the to the lost and they're
[21:36] actually causing the heathens to to to

[21:41] idolatry

[22:54] want to start with the my notes they're
[22:56] down here I want to start with those and
[22:58] I didn't get a chance to put him up
[22:59] above my other ones verse 20 surely as a
[23:02] wife this same chapter same chapter
[23:04] surely as a wife treacherously departed
[23:06] from her husband let's stop right there
[23:08] Israel was like a wife to God and so the
[23:12] symbolism is this wife went to every
[23:15] single tree every single man other than
[23:17] her husband that's the symbolism this is
[23:20] how awfully Wicked This is this is how
[23:22] dirty filthy this is yet God still says
[23:25] return unto me
[23:29] that's
[23:30] Grace God you know he tries to give us
[23:33] an understanding of his love amen it's
[23:35] hard for us it's hard for our minds you
[23:36] know an infinite God it's hard to
[23:38] understand how an infinite God could
[23:40] express his love but this is one way he
[23:42] shows us it's like a wife that went to
[23:44] every other house other than her own
[23:46] house she loved every other man other
[23:48] than her own husband and yet God said
[23:51] still come back to me just acknowledge
[23:53] that you went to all those just
[23:55] acknowledge that return and I'll receive
[23:57] you I won't be mad B with
[23:59] you that's amazing grace amen how is
[24:03] that possible amen it's the love of
[24:08] God and no you know he calls it out here
[24:11] departing from her husband uh so have ye
[24:13] dealt treacherously with me oh House of
[24:15] Israel sayeth the
[24:17] Lord a voice was heard upon the high
[24:20] places weeping and supplication of the
[24:22] children of Israel for they have
[24:24] perverted their way they have forgotten
[24:26] the Lord their God return oh ye
[24:28] backsliding children and I will
[24:32] heal God can heal uh in numerous numbers
[24:36] of idolatrous uh uh sins God can heal
[24:41] it he didn't say I might or I'll think
[24:43] about it he said I
[24:45] will amen hallelujah he's got the power
[24:48] to do it he's got the love to do it he's
[24:50] got the spirit to do it hallelujah amen
[24:53] I will heal hallelujah amen like brother
[24:56] B said don't ever think people are too
[24:57] far gone until they cross on and even
[24:59] then you don't know what they said in
[25:00] their last moments they could have
[25:02] prayed in their heart they could have
[25:03] done something some a some some real
[25:05] repentance but look God said I will
[25:07] still heal your backslidings behold we
[25:10] come unto thee for thou art the Lord Our
[25:12] God truly in vain is salvation hoped for
[25:16] from the hills see they go up to the
[25:17] hills praying to assure and all these
[25:19] other gods that's just the one I know
[25:20] from the scripture and from the
[25:22] multitude of mountains truly in the Lord
[25:24] our God is the Salvation of Israel he's
[25:27] saying just trust to me you've said a
[25:29] thousand prayers to other gods just
[25:31] repent of that come to me I'll hear
[25:34] you verse 24 for shame ha devoured the
[25:37] labor of our fathers from our youth
[25:39] their flocks and their herds their sons
[25:41] and their daughters so see they saw the
[25:42] effects of their backsliding they saw on
[25:44] their family right so we should look at
[25:47] our families we should look at our lives
[25:48] is there any evil effects upon my life
[25:50] help my life to be pure Hallelujah verse
[25:53] 25 we lie down in our shame and our
[25:56] confusion
[25:58] for we have sinned against the Lord Our
[25:59] God we and our fathers from our youth
[26:01] even un this day and have not obeyed the
[26:04] voice of the Lord Our God now I was
[26:06] listening to a sermon uh it was a man
[26:08] reading a sermon of Charles Spurgeon now
[26:10] Charles Spurgeon is one of our favorites
[26:11] at our house he's a a preacher from the
[26:14] 1800s the man age they call him the
[26:17] prince of preachers that's quite a
[26:19] statement brother now we don't want to
[26:20] exalt preachers but when they're dead I
[26:21] don't mind saying if they're dead you
[26:22] know because then they ain't going to
[26:24] get puffed up you know you tell them now
[26:26] they're the prince of preachers probably
[26:28] not a good idea yeah I know we want to
[26:29] give flowers I appreciate flowers you
[26:31] know I appreciate you understand I think
[26:33] everybody understands but I was
[26:35] listening to him and he told this story
[26:37] he said the only way this is the only
[26:38] way I can understand the love of God and
[26:40] he's talking about Israel here talking
[26:41] about
[26:42] backsliding he said he read an article
[26:45] in a
[26:46] newspaper and the newspaper said uh the
[26:49] certain certain men it was actually
[26:51] obituary but then uh there's obituary
[26:53] but then uh he said he there was an
[26:55] article like an opinion written about
[26:57] this obituary of this old man who
[27:00] died let's let's just say he died at 60
[27:02] okay I'll just use that okay just use
[27:03] that because it just be easier to
[27:05] understand and Charles Spurgeon said
[27:08] this man got married at
[27:09] 20 to this wife he left the wife to go
[27:12] to the big city whatever city in England
[27:15] it was to make a
[27:18] fortune and he said he only sent his
[27:21] wife one
[27:23] letter and said honey uh you know I'm
[27:26] gonna work here until I get enough money
[27:29] then 40 years pass he never sent her
[27:32] another letter this is a story a true
[27:34] story Charles Spurgeon
[27:36] told he said for 40 years the man worked
[27:40] he got rich he got really rich but uh he
[27:43] started spending all his money uh into
[27:46] the sins of the world you know carousing
[27:48] and drugs and all kinds of things like
[27:50] that well you know cigarettes whatever
[27:52] they had in those days he said he got to
[27:55] the point just like the prodigal where
[27:57] he had no money left
[28:00] he had nothing left and the the last
[28:02] except for a little bit of money he was
[28:04] that last money at 60 years old to go
[28:06] back to his wife and the article said
[28:09] his wife was there waiting at the door
[28:11] to welcome him
[28:15] home he said then the article says he
[28:18] only lived a couple weeks or days after
[28:20] that and she just nursed him and told
[28:23] told you I love you I missed you
[28:28] and Charles Spurgeon said that is the
[28:30] closest description of God's
[28:33] love he said that I've ever
[28:37] seen because that's what we do we can
[28:39] leave God we can forsake God and when we
[28:41] come back to God we know we fail we know
[28:43] we we made mistakes but yet God is still
[28:45] there with open arms he's freely going
[28:47] to love us even when we don't deserve it
[28:50] Hallelujah he's going to welcome Us
[28:52] in isn't that what God Said here in the
[28:54] word of
[28:56] God I'll still take you back
[28:58] back so she was pure all those 40 years
[29:01] well maybe someday he'll come back maybe
[29:03] something happened I'm just going to
[29:05] believe and of course he confessed his
[29:08] sins on his death bed and she watched
[29:10] him die die a saved man apparently and
[29:14] Charles Spurgeon said this is the love
[29:16] of God this is The God Who heals
[29:20] backsliders and then sometimes God will
[29:22] express it through Saints like that
[29:24] precious Saints notice it wasn't a man
[29:26] it was a woman nothing against am men
[29:28] brothers trying to encourage our sisters
[29:30] you know like we got some good
[29:32] encouragement last Sunday from brother
[29:34] Ben
[29:35] Hallelujah this is a glimpse into the
[29:38] love of God how God freely forgives our
[29:41] backslidings now let's none of us would
[29:44] ever do that right 40 years leave the
[29:46] message you know but let's be let let's
[29:48] be aware that someone could come back
[29:51] that's what I'm talking about am be
[29:53] ready to receive them if they're gone
[29:55] five years 10 years wherever they're
[29:56] gone praise God hallelujah
[29:59] be ready with the love of God If Only
[30:01] They acknowledge their iniquity God will
[30:03] receive
[30:04] them right God will receive anyone who
[30:07] acknowledges their iniquity and says
[30:08] forgive me Lord I haven't obeyed your
[30:10] voice forgive me Lord just receive me
[30:12] and God will wash all that idolatry away
[30:14] Hallelujah in a moment's time
[30:16] Hallelujah just like the gibon nightes
[30:18] amen just like the different ones we
[30:19] looked at a few weeks ago Hosea 141 now
[30:22] here's uh this this this this is my text
[30:27] and it also gives you know a little more
[30:29] on just the the the steps of repentance
[30:31] and
[30:35] forgiveness
[30:36] Hallelujah Hosea 14:1 oh Israel return
[30:40] unto the Lord thy God for thou Hast
[30:41] Fallen by thine iniquity just like that
[30:43] man he knew what he was doing he should
[30:45] have he should have wrote to his wife
[30:47] and brought his wife right to the
[30:50] city Israel knew their iniquity they
[30:53] knew what they're doing was wrong but
[30:56] verse two here's the god of Grace but
[30:57] take take with you words and turn to the
[31:01] Lord hallelujah and say unto him take
[31:04] away all iniquity and receive us
[31:09] graciously see grace is
[31:11] undeserved it's
[31:13] unmar you didn't do anything for it God
[31:16] just gives
[31:17] it Hallelujah so we will render the
[31:21] calves or the sacrifices of our lips so
[31:23] see that's the only sacrifice we need as
[31:26] if we backslide or if we make a mistake
[31:28] or we sin against God or man or whoever
[31:30] our employer whoever we sin against all
[31:32] we need is the calves of our lips a
[31:35] sacrifice to say forgive me I'm
[31:38] sorry
[31:40] right Hallelujah God calls that the
[31:42] sacrifice of our lips the the repentance
[31:46] the words where Israel should have said
[31:49] I'm sorry forgive me I gave myself I
[31:52] lost all the fear of the Lord I I I
[31:54] burnt uh uh offerings on every uh tree
[31:58] and and high mountain and under ever
[31:59] green tree uh I I played the Harlot with
[32:01] every God forgive me bring those words
[32:04] and God will forgive you Hallelujah
[32:07] that's right verse three as sure shall
[32:10] not save us see they had to learn hose
[32:13] is telling them that that God that
[32:15] little God there or how big the God is
[32:17] that won't save you we will not ride
[32:19] upon horses neither will we say anymore
[32:21] to the work of our hands ye are our gods
[32:23] for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy
[32:26] so God is so great he's not limited to a
[32:28] statue God's so great if a if a Earthly
[32:32] uh son or daughter doesn't have a dad
[32:34] God will come and show them that he's
[32:35] their
[32:37] father that's right Hallelujah so here
[32:40] what are we seeing here return so you
[32:42] got to come back if we sin or backside
[32:45] we got to come back to Heavenly places
[32:47] that's where we left amen that's our
[32:49] location that's where we live we're
[32:50] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[32:52] Jesus amen
[32:55] hallelujah turn and say so we got to
[32:58] return and then return and
[33:00] say uh we must say our sin and then uh
[33:03] pull up
[33:05] uhh Romans 10 Romans 10 yeah let me I
[33:09] wrote the wrong verse down here I wrote
[33:11] 1 Corinthians 10 Romans 10 Romans 10 if
[33:13] you confess with your mouth I think it's
[33:14] Romans 10:10 or Romans
[33:17] 10:4 we so I'm showing this we need this
[33:20] in the Old Testament they need in the
[33:21] Old Testament we need it in the new it's
[33:23] verse n sorry 109 sorry I mean that
[33:26] that's good too but for the point I'm
[33:28] making for that if Thou shalt confess
[33:30] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt
[33:32] believe in thine heart that God ha
[33:33] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[33:36] saved so see we see it return to God and
[33:39] then say to him confess your sin say
[33:42] take all away all my
[33:44] iniquity not some of it not half of it
[33:47] all of my
[33:48] iniquity Hallelujah and receive me
[33:51] where's receive and I'll receive
[33:55] you Hallelujah where's that word
[33:58] oh yeah verse two take away all iniquity
[34:00] and receive us now remember to be
[34:03] received God said you got to come out

[34:33] to hear your prayer you can't touch it

[34:39] that this is death and you got to be
[34:41] fully convinced that God's word is life
[34:43] amen amen hallelujah and not touch it
[34:46] see it's beautiful so see it's the same
[34:49] in Hosea and and Romans and and then
[34:51] second cor it's the same
[34:53] thing right don't touch the sin and then
[34:57] God receive you verse 17 want pull is

[35:09] thank God our Father for giving us
[35:10] Christ's son and then God is a father
[35:12] unto us and you should be Sons and
[35:15] Daughters sayeth the Lord God
[35:17] Almighty now le that up there this is
[35:21] the one I I don't have to get to it now
[35:22] I'll just preach it now but the prodigal
[35:24] son in Luke in the Book of Luke right
[35:28] he had to leave his backsliding
[35:30] condition I was telling my wife this is
[35:33] a story more about us I I feel like this
[35:35] story more relates to how Christians can
[35:39] backslide now most people use it just
[35:41] getting
[35:42] saved right and now it can be used for
[35:44] that but to me it makes more sense he's
[35:46] probably a grown man right the The
[35:48] Prodigal and he knows the blessing of
[35:50] God he's seen the he's seen the blessing
[35:52] of his father and he backslides and
[35:54] leaves it on purpose he turns away
[35:57] that's that's what the word backside
[35:58] means to turn away he turned from his
[36:01] father and left to the the the pleasures
[36:03] of life everybody see
[36:06] that but how did he get back how was his
[36:09] father a father to him he had to turn
[36:11] back amen he had to turn back and he had
[36:15] to give the sacrifice the calves of his
[36:17] lips and say father I've sinned against
[36:19] you I've sinned against Heaven receive
[36:21] me and what did he do once he left that
[36:23] place once he separated himself he could
[36:25] be received by the father amen
[36:28] ah it's Amazing Grace how sweet that
[36:30] sound that saved a wret like me amen I
[36:34] once was lost but now I found I was
[36:36] blind but now I see
[36:39] Hallelujah is that right amen look how
[36:42] look how it ties together I mean this is
[36:43] the gospel amen this is good news it was
[36:47] good news for Israel good news for us

[39:48] promise even a backslider if he makes a
[39:51] prayer towards the temple God will hear
[39:53] his
[39:56] prayer and brother B said of course the
[39:59] Bible says God heard Jonah's prayer and
[40:02] brother bam said if God would do that
[40:03] for a man who looked at an Earthly
[40:06] temple built by an Earthly man Church
[40:09] what are you looking at you're not
[40:11] looking at this church you're not

[40:15] Heavenly Temple that was built by
[40:17] Heavenly Powers Eternal Powers you're
[40:20] looking at a Heavenly high priest who
[40:22] doesn't die doesn't need a sacrifice for
[40:25] his sins he was a sacrifice for your and
[40:28] my sins
[40:29] amen glory and if brother said if God
[40:33] heard that man's
[40:35] prayer if God would honor that man
[40:39] because he believed in the prayer of
[40:41] Solomon whom how much more will he honor
[40:44] your prayer tonight
[40:47] Hallelujah and brother said brother said
[40:50] it was a backsliding man praying a
[40:53] prayer of a backsliding man Solomon
[40:56] backs on God what does it show we all
[40:59] backslide we all make mistakes we all
[41:01] fall short of God's glory so God offers

[41:28] where J Jesus sets in the presence of
[41:30] God with his own
[41:32] blood as an intercession for your sins
[41:35] as he enters sin think about that some
[41:37] people will say Jesus can you forgive me
[41:40] Jesus can you actually forgive me how
[41:42] could God forgive me of my own sin God
[41:45] how can you restore my faith my virtue
[41:47] my knowledge all the how can you do it
[41:49] well it all depends on what blood you
[41:51] have amen hallelujah right how could God
[41:55] do it God can do it because he has the
[41:57] perfect blood the perfect
[42:01] sacrifice Hebrews I believe 9 or Hebrews
[42:03] 10 says by one sacrifice he had he has
[42:07] perfected forever them who are
[42:09] Sanctified ah what Sanctified to
[42:12] separate see as long as you leave your
[42:14] sin and separated from it God can now
[42:16] perfect you God can now forgive you he
[42:19] can bring you back into Fellowship it's
[42:21] Separation by the blood it's healing by
[42:23] the blood it's faith in the blood it's
[42:25] life in the blood amen
[42:29] Glory
[42:33] Hallelujah if God will honor the prayer
[42:36] of a baon and man to a baxon and man's
[42:39] prayer how much more will he hear your
[42:42] prayer brother that's what brother says
[42:44] because we have a we we don't have an
[42:45] Earthly one we have a Heavenly
[42:47] Temple a Heavenly high
[42:50] priest
[42:52] Hallelujah brother raham said Jonah got
[42:55] down on his knees and said Lord I'm
[42:56] sorry backslide I'll take the right road
[42:59] if you just let me out of here now look
[43:01] he's making a vow isn't he he's on his
[43:03] knees saying Lord you forgive me Lord
[43:05] God if you just save me out of the belly
[43:07] of this whale I'll walk the right
[43:10] road I will correct my
[43:12] backsliding and then God heard that and
[43:14] then he actually delivered him right to
[43:16] Nineveh God was gracious now he don't
[43:19] have to travel to Nineveh God already
[43:20] provided the
[43:22] travel God will provide your travel
[43:24] too Hallelujah God will take take you
[43:27] places uh faster than you think you can
[43:29] get there God will do things you don't
[43:31] expect him to do praise God in other
[43:33] words God will make it easier on you
[43:35] because God is the god of Mercy
[43:36] hallelujah amen if you want to do right
[43:38] God will help you do right Hallelujah if
[43:40] you have a heart of Integrity God will
[43:42] keep you from sinning hallelujah amen
[43:45] and he'll forgive you if you
[43:46] do because he's the god of
[43:51] Mercy a man running from the presence of
[43:53] the
[43:54] Lord oh my goodness Hallelujah
[43:58] now I just want to do some general
[43:59] quotes brother R said in brass serpent
[44:01] 53 and here is the word of God tonight
[44:04] Hallelujah written here before us and we
[44:06] thank thee for he's praying to the to
[44:08] father and now may it just find its
[44:11] place of Anchorage tonight in every
[44:14] heart so the unsaved first of all would
[44:17] get
[44:19] saved the backsliders would come back to
[44:21] Jesus Christ the loving heavenly father
[44:24] and be reconciled by the sacrifice of of
[44:27] his cross who died in their
[44:30] stead here's what happens chur when
[44:32] people backslide they forget they were
[44:35] forgiven pull up second Peter 1 this
[44:37] always just tied in really beautifully
[44:39] here today second Peter 1 I believe it's
[44:42] verse 10 again this one just came to me
[44:44] I didn't have this in my notes it just
[44:46] came to me here second Peter
[44:49] 1 yes verse n but he that lackthe things
[44:53] Faith virtue knowledge uh Temperance
[44:55] patience godliness brotherly kindness he
[44:56] that lacks these things as blind and
[44:59] cannot see a far off and have forgotten
[45:01] that he was purged from his old
[45:04] sins so Peter no doubt we've seen people
[45:07] like this right Peter had seen people
[45:11] that would get anointing they build up
[45:13] but then they lose the anointing and
[45:15] then he dealt with them he he he he uh
[45:17] uh he talked with them and they felt
[45:19] like they forgot they were
[45:21] forgiven the devil will hang that the
[45:23] failures over us we can't let the devil
[45:26] hang our failures over our
[45:28] heads I'm going to preach this now now
[45:30] go to Second Peter 2 uh second Peter 2
[45:33] yes second I'm sorry 2 Corinthians 2
[45:36] this just struck me second Corinthians 2
[45:39] it's on the video I didn't uh spend a
[45:41] lot of time on
[45:45] it so this is what Peter would have had
[45:48] to do he would have had to talk with
[45:49] these brothers or sisters and and say
[45:51] brother sister what happened well I I
[45:53] did this I back said I and and how can
[45:56] Jesus forgive me I'm lost I'm a hopeless
[45:59] case and Peter said no you just forgot
[46:02] you were
[46:04] forgiven what what the Bible say a
[46:06] backslider he fills his his his life
[46:08] with his own ways right he he forgot the
[46:11] ways of God so much he even forgot that
[46:13] he was forgiven but like Jose shared
[46:15] that quote with me yes remember Jose he
[46:17] said brother man said backsliders are
[46:19] still saved unless they're the
[46:21] Perpetual talking about the elected
[46:24] elected person can backslide and still
[46:26] be be saved all right so I got second
[46:29] Corinthians
[46:31] 2
[46:33] now Paul cried many tears because of
[46:35] some of the sins in this now this might
[46:37] have been the brother sleeping with his
[46:39] stepmother it might have been but we we
[46:40] don't know we don't even have he doesn't
[46:42] give any details of this brother or this
[46:45] uh sin here he just said he shed many
[46:47] tears in verse
[46:50] four okay uh verse six sufficient to
[46:52] such a man is this punishment which was
[46:54] inflicted of many so this this person
[46:57] hurt many people verse 7 so that
[46:59] contrarywise you ought rather to forgive
[47:01] him so even though this person the
[47:03] Corinthian Church hurt many people Paul
[47:05] said you ought to forgive him and
[47:07] comfort him lest perhaps should a one be
[47:10] swalled up with over much
[47:14] sorrow
[47:16] okay wherefore I beseech you that ye
[47:18] would confirm your love toward
[47:21] him right and I've seen this there's a
[47:23] brother you know we uh Malachi were out
[47:25] there in Iowa there's a brother that
[47:27] brother that come back remember I don't
[47:29] know I don't remember his name but this
[47:31] is what happened to him and this other
[47:32] brother we were talking about they fell
[47:34] out of church and they got under such
[47:36] condemnation they wouldn't come back to
[47:38] church well here's what happened I'll go
[47:40] back to verse
[47:42] seven here's what happened they they
[47:44] they they hurt many people in the church
[47:47] and they let the devil uh o give them
[47:49] over much
[47:52] sorrow
[47:53] right now thank God the brother came
[47:55] back I think it was 15 15 years later he
[47:57] come back boy he's on fire now he's
[48:00] like he's on fire like he started a
[48:02] group text with 20 people what can I
[48:04] pray for you what can I pray for what
[48:05] can I pray for
[48:07] you he's like can we have more prayer
[48:08] meetings can we have all these prayer
[48:09] meetings and all these things like that
[48:10] can we have Bible study so brother Brook
[48:11] started a Bible study for
[48:14] him
[48:16] so it it was good it really good but see
[48:19] this is one of the dangers here now
[48:21] remember this might have been the
[48:22] brother who was in sexual
[48:24] sin and he let the he we have to feel
[48:27] bad for our sin but we also can't be
[48:29] overs sorrowed by our sin we have to
[48:31] know that there is a
[48:33] redeemer there is an all sufficient
[48:37] sacrifice that wipes it away amen and
[48:40] separates as far as the east as from the
[48:43] West amen throws it in the sea of
[48:45] forgetfulness there's no more record
[48:48] it's gone it's forgiven I forgive you I
[48:50] received you praise
[48:53] God see so the devil didn't want this
[48:56] man to to get that kind of
[48:58] Victory so the devil put over much
[49:00] sorrow on him so this is worldly
[49:02] sorrow right letting the worldly sorrow
[49:06] overtake
[49:07] him right but then Paul says make sure
[49:09] you confirm your love tell this person
[49:11] you love them
[49:13] hallelujah look at verse 10 to whom ye
[49:15] forgive anything I forgive him also for
[49:18] if I forgave anything to whom I forgave
[49:19] it for your sakes forgave I it in the
[49:21] person of Jesus Christ in other words
[49:23] Paul is saying I want to forgive this
[49:25] brother or sister whoever it is I want
[49:27] to forgive them like Christ would
[49:28] forgive them Hallelujah that's a real
[49:31] forgiveness right there Hallelujah
[49:32] that's a
[49:34] real H H do do you think Jesus holds
[49:37] grudges against you after you repent no
[49:39] he loves
[49:41] you the Bible said I'll Love You freely
[49:43] and that was under the blood of bulls
[49:44] and goats Hosea said if you repent I'll
[49:47] heal you I'll Love You freely not I'll
[49:50] love you because of your good
[49:52] works I'll Love You freely amen
[49:56] hallelujah
[49:57] that's the kind of God that we serve a
[49:59] god of love a god of Grace
[50:01] amen hallelujah right now here now I
[50:05] always wonder this verse such a but now
[50:07] I get it lest Satan should get an
[50:09] advantage of us for we we are not
[50:12] ignorant of his devices now leave that
[50:13] up there we've always used this to say
[50:15] you know I've heard preacher use this
[50:16] the devices of uh you know worldly music
[50:20] right people use this oh Satan's using
[50:21] this rock and roll that's true that's
[50:23] true but what is the context of this
[50:25] that's what struck me I was like I
[50:27] didn't and yeah I recognize Satan has
[50:29] all kinds of devices you know the phone
[50:31] and and music and all these things that
[50:33] that's true and we got to we got to
[50:34] stand guard don't let your guard down
[50:37] Hallelujah don't let it
[50:40] down but the point of this is Satan's
[50:43] device is to get someone so overs
[50:46] sorrowed so focused on themselves oh my
[50:48] they're so it just struck me now they're
[50:50] focus on their sin and their mistake so
[50:52] much they are not focusing on the blood
[50:53] of Jesus Christ amen cuz we could all
[50:56] say look at my sins I've done awful
[50:58] things we could all say that praise God
[51:00] but at some point we have to turn from
[51:02] our sins stop looking at our sins and
[51:04] realize they're actually in the sea of
[51:05] forgetfulness and look at the blood of
[51:07] Jesus Christ
[51:09] amen because I forgave it in the person
[51:12] of Christ amen amen
[51:16] amen so yes you feel sorry yes you have
[51:19] Godly sorrow yes you're sorrowful that
[51:21] means I'm going to get revenge on Satan
[51:24] next time I'm obeying the word of God I
[51:26] said next time I'm ready for
[51:29] him right so you brothers that b battle
[51:32] mind battles with immorally dressed
[51:34] women you go out there you go ready out
[51:36] there in public I'm ready to look
[51:38] away I'm not going to fall to the
[51:40] devil right people that lie they got to
[51:43] say I'm ready I'm going to tell the
[51:45] truth every
[51:46] time right you're ready to tell the
[51:48] truth like you're looking for Satan to
[51:50] try you're looking for some type of trap
[51:52] and then when the Trap comes ah I see
[51:53] you now devil I'm doing what's right
[51:57] I've got Godly repentance
[51:59] amen I've got a Zeal to obey this time I
[52:02] will not fall I will not live in
[52:05] iniquity I will stand on God's word
[52:07] hallelujah now you're on fire now you
[52:09] got your first love church Hallelujah
[52:12] got your first love back that's
[52:15] right brother Ram says this uh 1955
[52:20] don't be satisfied with your fire built
[52:23] here from last night let's build a
[52:25] little further up the road tonight never
[52:29] build it in the same place you'll stand
[52:32] still you're either backsliding or going
[52:36] forward okay so just a good reminder
[52:38] there right uh brother man says we could
[52:41] backslide every service if we don't draw
[52:42] closer to
[52:43] God
[52:45] right so see we must continue to hunger
[52:48] and seek after God I want to say this on
[52:50] Wednesday night I was very inspired to
[52:52] preach on gifts and my wife even shared
[52:55] this with me uh I was very I was very
[52:58] inspired once people say they have the
[53:00] Holy Ghost that's the moment they got to
[53:02] keep seeking God because if not they
[53:05] might backslide on God like we're
[53:07] talking about they might backslide on
[53:08] God if they don't keep that same
[53:10] devotion and love for God they're going
[53:11] to wonder did I even get the Holy Ghost
[53:14] I'm GNA forget I'm saved right like just
[53:16] like Peter said I'm gonna forget I have
[53:18] charity I'm gonna forget I had that and
[53:21] so that's why we really got to
[53:22] understand the quotes of brother brandom
[53:23] when he says don't seek gifts he's
[53:25] saying don't seek us specific gift don't
[53:28] say God make me a big known person don't
[53:31] say that but seek God the Bible said

[54:19] tonight might maybe drunkards think
[54:21] about that maybe people that's done
[54:23] stepped over the line and went into

[55:08] will you save them tonight Lord will you
[55:11] bring that poor wandering backslider no
[55:13] matter if he's sitting out lied and
[55:14] condemned feels maybe he's crossed the
[55:16] separating line no he hasn't your spirit
[55:20] still calling as long as it calls you're
[55:24] wanting your wandering children to come
[55:26] home home won't you grant it tonight
[55:27] father that the Holy Spirit bring
[55:29] conviction in the audience and bring
[55:30] many wandering children to thee for we
[55:32] ask it in his
[55:34] name he's sitting in a church brother
[55:36] William with a backsliders drunkards
[55:40] immorals and he said God still loves
[55:44] you God still loved David God still
[55:47] loved
[55:48] Moses how about one of our favorite guys
[55:50] God so loved
[55:52] Abraham brother said look at Abraham
[55:54] sitting down there in guer
[55:57] sorry I'm getting dry thr backslid
[55:59] telling a
[56:01] lie now he was naturally backslid and
[56:05] spiritually right because naturally he
[56:07] left the promised land right he's
[56:09] physically backsliding right but
[56:12] spiritually because he lied and said
[56:14] she's not my
[56:15] wife and give his wife over to another
[56:18] man to save his own skin what a man he
[56:21] says sitting out there and
[56:23] backslid God told him and said don't you
[56:25] leave up there there stay up there he's
[56:27] talking about in Israel right in the
[56:29] Holy Land the famine had run him out he
[56:32] wondered down to where it was easier
[56:34] going sometimes Church the easier way is
[56:36] not always the right way I know that's a
[56:38] whole another sermon but the easier way
[56:40] is not always the right way what what I
[56:43] mean is the right way is always
[56:46] obedience right it's always
[56:49] obedience like I've had different people
[56:51] over the years uh councel uh they they
[56:54] left now or they're gone and they they
[56:56] would say brother Jess you know uh like
[56:58] a sister would say do I go back to work
[57:00] and I was like well who's going to watch
[57:01] your
[57:02] children they don't have anybody watch
[57:03] your children I said that's probably not
[57:05] the will of God God put you here gave
[57:07] you those children for your children
[57:10] that that's God's Will and they have a
[57:12] choice do I take the easier way make
[57:14] more money or I take God's
[57:16] way simple or one of those brothers
[57:19] would say uh you know God's call giving
[57:21] me a job over here but there's no church
[57:23] to go to well that's a pretty easy
[57:25] choice if you ask me about it
[57:26] I'll tell you my my ideas about it
[57:30] Hallelujah there's no church are you
[57:32] going to start a church what do you what
[57:33] are you plan on
[57:35] doing so you know th those type of
[57:38] things you don't go to where it's easier
[57:40] more money don't always make life
[57:42] easier sometimes it makes it
[57:44] harder the more you get the more you got
[57:46] to take care of brother says you know
[57:48] what happens to a fellow when he takes
[57:50] the easy Road Jonah right Abraham
[57:57] now here's what brother Jose had shared
[57:58] with us uh 1957 Hebrews now well you no
[58:02] I'm sorry now you say well can't we back
[58:04] backside absolutely and when you
[58:06] backside you're going to get it don't
[58:08] you
[58:11] worry Abraham got
[58:14] it and the rest of them got it and
[58:17] you'll get
[58:19] it right you'll get a little
[58:21] spanking right don't you think it gives
[58:24] you a right to sin it doesn't
[58:27] you'll pay for everything that you
[58:30] do didn't David look remember we looked
[58:32] at that didn't David pay for everything
[58:34] he
[58:36] did he paid for everything you'll reap
[58:39] what you sow you do one little sin and
[58:41] you'll reap a whole Wash Tub full
[58:43] brother says I have not seen a wash tub
[58:45] recently but somebody finds one let me
[58:47] know how big is a wash
[58:48] tub that's right but brother that don't
[58:51] mean to say that you're lost that's
[58:53] exactly right you're saved Abraham
[58:55] reaped EX exactly what he s that's right
[58:57] but he was still saved
[59:01] Hallelujah right that's God's
[59:05] love one more quote and I'm going to go
[59:07] to the New Testament I'm still to the
[59:08] New Testament all these Old Testament
[59:11] scriptures like like I said there're 16
[59:12] I didn't I didn't even preach all of
[59:13] them because some of them you know I
[59:15] felt had less uh scriptures so or less
[59:18] uh uh points and I want to get the ones
[59:20] that had the points about speaking it
[59:22] and calves of our lips and how to how to
[59:24] come back to God uh 19 61 oh the message
[59:26] of Grace I preached this one a few weeks
[59:28] ago but said and Abraham said it's my
[59:30] sister Abraham lied about it but yet the
[59:32] grace of God held him because he
[59:34] repented he was willing to repent now
[59:36] the Bible doesn't tell us he repented
[59:38] but brother said he tells us tells us he
[59:40] did repent well of course he did right
[59:41] because God would not protected Sarah he
[59:44] would have lied perhaps you know but he
[59:47] would have repented at some point the
[59:49] father of what the father of Faith the
[59:52] father of assurance that's what the word
[59:53] means in the Greek the father of I'm
[59:55] assured God is is true I'm assured
[59:57] there's a God in heaven the father of
[59:58] that lied about his
[1:00:00] wife because he's in he's in a constant
[1:00:03] battle right flesh the spirit flesh
[1:00:07] Spirit these are emnity they hatred one
[1:00:08] against
[1:00:11] another and anybody that's willing to
[1:00:13] repent the grace of God still goes for
[1:00:16] you the grace of God is searching for
[1:00:20] you Hallelujah so that goes for you
[1:00:23] backsliders this morning the grace of
[1:00:25] God is looking for you if you'll just
[1:00:27] repent God's grace is
[1:00:29] sufficient how he took good old Abraham
[1:00:32] brought him back and remember Abraham
[1:00:35] was not saved by his Works he was saved
[1:00:37] by
[1:00:38] grace Abraham was saved by faith which
[1:00:41] is Grace and God saved Abraham because
[1:00:43] of his grace not because of his
[1:00:45] behavior but but he saved him because of
[1:00:48] his grace oh how good we are saved by
[1:00:51] grace all right now I'm I'm G to try to
[1:00:53] uh uh bring this down here now
[1:00:56] now I've been through all these Old
[1:00:58] Testament scriptures now in the New
[1:01:00] Testament the words for backslide is
[1:01:02] fall
[1:01:04] away okay uh pull up second Peter
[1:01:07] 3:17 and now you and I backslide in one
[1:01:10] of two ways it's either you backslide in
[1:01:12] a major sin or a minor I guess the same
[1:01:14] was true in the Old Testament right
[1:01:16] except the only difference is now in the
[1:01:17] New Testament we have more power we have
[1:01:20] holy ghost power in the soul amen we
[1:01:22] have a holy ghost baptism in our soul to
[1:01:25] keep us from the madej your sins amen
[1:01:27] amen that has to be the case because of
[1:01:29] what Jesus said you know the Pharisees
[1:01:31] got a greater damnation there's levels
[1:01:32] of damnation right there's levels of
[1:01:34] rewards there's
[1:01:36] levels ye therefore beloved seeing you
[1:01:39] know these things Brethren beware lest
[1:01:41] ye also being led away with the air of
[1:01:42] the wicked fall there's fall that means
[1:01:46] turn away it's the same definition as
[1:01:48] backslide beware unless you backslide
[1:01:50] from your own steadfastness now this
[1:01:52] word steadfastness means a firm mind a
[1:01:56] firm condition of your mind so this is
[1:01:59] speaking of the mind it's a
[1:02:00] steadfastness of your mind your
[1:02:02] thoughts so see the Bible said Peter
[1:02:05] says be careful you can be led away from
[1:02:08] a mind that's steadfast on the word it's
[1:02:11] firm on the word of God and the church
[1:02:13] said
[1:02:16] Hallelujah now that's for minor now this
[1:02:18] is for minor right for us I'm talking
[1:02:20] about for us now I made a I preached it
[1:02:23] when uh William was here in 2022 the 13
[1:02:26] metaphors for backsliding I don't I
[1:02:28] don't remember that I had 13 metaphors
[1:02:30] for the Jud person right what here
[1:02:34] here's what the Bible says they're
[1:02:36] Shipwrecked they war against God they
[1:02:38] fall away so there's the major
[1:02:40] backsliding oh I never read the
[1:02:42] Perpetual backsliding did I okay so hold
[1:02:45] on look up Perpetual if you if you can I
[1:02:47] don't know if you can but I can find it
[1:02:50] you have a Bible search back there oh
[1:02:52] Glory we're doing good uh pull up a
[1:02:55] perpetual backslide sliding okay sorry I
[1:02:57] don't know how I missed that verse how I
[1:02:59] miss the fourth one you get offended or
[1:03:02] stumbled or Judas was offended at the
[1:03:04] word right this is all speaking about
[1:03:05] make Believers fifth you get cut off or
[1:03:08] cast forth sixth is you're a Castaway
[1:03:10] Paul said I don't want to be a cast away
[1:03:11] so I got to keep my body under
[1:03:12] subjection my mind as well seventh they
[1:03:16] return back to Sodom it's very similar
[1:03:17] to falling away or back study number
[1:03:19] eight itching ears number nine a hard
[1:03:22] heart number 10 they crucify Jesus AR
[1:03:24] fresh we looked at that a few weeks ago
[1:03:25] on a Wednesday night 11 they trample
[1:03:28] underfoot the Son of God aresh publicly
[1:03:31] 12 they get entangled they get entangled
[1:03:33] or caught in like a web or a trap and 13
[1:03:36] they get uprooted or plucked up uh
[1:03:39] they're supposed to be planted by the
[1:03:40] rivers of Living Water amen thank God
[1:03:42] we're planting the word of God amen amen
[1:03:45] but Judas got plucked up because he
[1:03:47] wanted to for money all right now there
[1:03:50] it is why did I not get to Jeremiah 8
[1:03:53] okay why then is this people of
[1:03:54] Jerusalem slid him back by a Perpetual
[1:03:57] backsliding they hold fast to seat they
[1:04:00] refuse to
[1:04:02] return so see this is what I'm talking
[1:04:04] about so a Perpetual backsliding is when
[1:04:07] someone refuses that's like a Judas
[1:04:10] scariot that's like a balum right that's
[1:04:13] like all these that we're not right we
[1:04:16] are not any of those by God's grace
[1:04:19] that's a person that will sell out the
[1:04:20] message that when if that's a certain
[1:04:22] amount of money they'll leave they
[1:04:23] they'll blashe brother Braham they'll
[1:04:24] blaspheme the word of God they'll
[1:04:25] blaspheme us you know that's not
[1:04:28] us but see that's the point so when
[1:04:30] Israel would perpetually backslide and
[1:04:33] not come back God said I divorce you I'm
[1:04:36] putting you
[1:04:38] away and that's this Judas as scariot
[1:04:40] group so see there's very serious so
[1:04:42] what I'm saying is there's major sins of
[1:04:44] major backsliding and there's minor like
[1:04:46] brother man says sometimes we do it
[1:04:47] every day now I am open because there's
[1:04:50] also Coes I am open brother says
[1:04:52] sometimes you can go days without
[1:04:54] sinning sometimes I felt like I've done
[1:04:56] that but I'm not saying I'm I'm not
[1:04:58] saying I'm right I'm just saying I felt
[1:05:00] like I didn't sin all
[1:05:02] day you know because you just love God
[1:05:04] and everything's feels like it's going
[1:05:06] good you know glory and victory and I'm
[1:05:09] protected I feel like there's a heads
[1:05:11] around me you
[1:05:12] know yeah yeah I'm sure hope hopefully
[1:05:15] you've had some of those but you know
[1:05:17] the the point brother R is making as
[1:05:19] we'll get to it is Paul said I had to
[1:05:20] die every day so at some point
[1:05:22] throughout a day you got to crucify the
[1:05:24] desires of your flesh and the desires of
[1:05:27] your mind right because you have those
[1:05:29] you have three desires you have desire
[1:05:30] of the soul my soul thirst for God
[1:05:32] desires of the Mind Ephesians says and
[1:05:34] you have desires of the flesh so three
[1:05:37] day every day brother wh I got to feed
[1:05:38] three people or three parts three things
[1:05:41] I got three people calling on three not
[1:05:43] three people I have three uh channels
[1:05:45] calling on me all day when are you going
[1:05:47] to feed me soul saying when are you
[1:05:48] going to feed me brother Jus when you
[1:05:49] going to feed me when are you going to
[1:05:51] feed me the word of God when are you
[1:05:52] going to feed me something good to think
[1:05:53] about my mind wants to you know figure
[1:05:55] something out or meditate then my bu's
[1:05:57] like when are you going to give me some
[1:05:58] perfect
[1:06:02] bars maybe cheddar
[1:06:05] Puffs no
[1:06:08] should it's a per so this is a Perpetual
[1:06:11] thing Israel now this is the Judas of
[1:06:13] Scar now I'm trying to close here uh
[1:06:15] give me 12 minutes there I feel like
[1:06:17] when it hits 12 then I feel like I can
[1:06:18] stop right there
[1:06:20] go so I I just went I went through some
[1:06:23] of these examples The Prodigal turn
[1:06:25] turned away from the pig pen and his
[1:06:28] father received him he was restored he
[1:06:31] was healed because remember God said I
[1:06:33] will
[1:06:35] heal amen and I'll tell you if God ever
[1:06:37] does a healing you're going to be healed
[1:06:39] amen if God ever forgives you you're
[1:06:42] going to be forgiven
[1:06:43] Hallelujah God cannot change his mind
[1:06:46] about his word
[1:06:49] hallelujah he can't he can't change his
[1:06:52] mind about his word he can't go back and
[1:06:54] say you know that was wrong probably
[1:06:55] should have done a little different on
[1:06:56] that one well I'm going to forgive them
[1:06:59] 75 but not 100 no God forgives
[1:07:02] all all prodigal was forgiven all he
[1:07:06] wasn't just relegated to just you're a
[1:07:08] servant no you're a
[1:07:10] son now your war is going to be less
[1:07:13] than that other faithful guy oh yeah
[1:07:15] that's when I use that I use that uh
[1:07:17] when remember uh was it brother Johnny
[1:07:18] or Sister Sarah said you know the enemy
[1:07:20] always battled on them because they
[1:07:22] never went out into the world remember
[1:07:23] that you guys remember that okay Sarah
[1:07:26] and it kind of struck me that's right it
[1:07:28] is a greater testimony to stay faithful
[1:07:30] to God your whole life because that's
[1:07:31] what Jesus
[1:07:33] did right and so see to me now that
[1:07:38] now a something's moving in here by
[1:07:40] God's
[1:07:42] grace GL I feel happy amen glory
[1:07:45] hallelujah amen I don't know why I'm
[1:07:47] feel like
[1:07:49] this but I can see it now that Parable
[1:07:52] now how you know both of them were
[1:07:55] children of God in the benefits of the
[1:07:58] father one left and backs it out the
[1:08:00] other one stayed true to the
[1:08:03] father now look he's going to battle a
[1:08:06] bitter Spirit
[1:08:08] right he he battled a he battled some
[1:08:11] bitterness but he still had the
[1:08:15] reward people always make that older son
[1:08:17] look so bad don't they that's what I'm
[1:08:19] saying like to me it doesn't look so bad
[1:08:21] anymore he's just having a mind battle I
[1:08:23] just I I I don't understand why all this
[1:08:26] is being made when he falls short but he
[1:08:28] just had to understand that this is
[1:08:30] God's grace amen this is the Father's
[1:08:33] Grace amen and you still have a greater
[1:08:36] reward because you stayed faithful all
[1:08:38] those years amen hallelujah but don't
[1:08:41] forget I'm giving grace to the
[1:08:42] backslider as well because I'm the
[1:08:44] father who loves all my children amen
[1:08:48] praise the Lord hallelujah amen
[1:08:51] glory the greater
[1:08:54] reward goes to the more faithful
[1:08:57] one don't you think we all battle mind
[1:09:00] battles how many preachers are come in
[1:09:02] here and preach on our
[1:09:03] complexes right church over the
[1:09:07] years I remember I preached on complexes
[1:09:09] at cams one time well that was probably
[1:09:10] 2013 or something like that we had the
[1:09:13] whole altar done filled
[1:09:15] up Hallelujah just like you know just
[1:09:18] Trials of life right the enemy tries to
[1:09:21] put that over sorrow and all these
[1:09:24] things and yet God is a God say return
[1:09:27] I'll forgive
[1:09:29] all I don't care if you iniquity on
[1:09:31] every Hill I don't care if all day you
[1:09:33] went through all day you said all did
[1:09:35] all this all this all this if you return
[1:09:36] a knowledge I will forgive you amen
[1:09:39] because I'm The God Who heals
[1:09:40] backsliders
[1:09:44] amen wow that's really something that
[1:09:47] that scripture that Elder son I always
[1:09:50] thought that's strange okay now I got it
[1:09:52] my guys feel like I got it
[1:09:56] Hallelujah now he went through the uh
[1:09:58] the man in 1 Corinthians 5 the
[1:09:59] fornicating with his stepmother that was
[1:10:01] a
[1:10:02] backsliding but that guy stayed in
[1:10:04] church defy and imagine that he's puffed
[1:10:06] up at the at the pastor in Corinth you
[1:10:08] know or the preachers or whatever it was
[1:10:10] you know he's like I can sleep with my
[1:10:12] stepmother I'm not going to repent of
[1:10:14] that I'm not going to mourn can you m
[1:10:15] that's the book of Acts church so that's
[1:10:18] why I was telling you I'm encouraged
[1:10:19] after hearing those sermons you know
[1:10:20] from the Brethren brother Ben preached
[1:10:23] on the Corinthian Church that's why I've
[1:10:24] always Tred to tell you where a mature
[1:10:25] church now don't let it go to your head

[1:11:24] back to the Cross right John came back
[1:11:26] to the Cross see John and Judas there's
[1:11:28] only 10 left right so 10 of them
[1:11:32] backslid physically and spiritually on

[1:14:08] have that that's gonna solve all my
[1:14:10] problems Jesus says money is the most
[1:14:12] popular God right because you can't
[1:14:13] serve God in manmon either love God and
[1:14:16] hate money or you hate money and love
[1:14:18] God let's love God
[1:14:23] today brother BR saids I trust that God
[1:14:25] has forgiven me as far as literally
[1:14:28] stealing anything as I know I never did
[1:14:30] it in my life but I so misused his time
[1:14:33] that I stole that way and done many
[1:14:36] things I shouldn't do but I'm grateful
[1:14:38] to God this morning that he's forgiven
[1:14:40] my
[1:14:42] sins said you can steal time from God
[1:14:45] and so that's what that's what you know
[1:14:46] we just we just need reminders of that
[1:14:48] we don't want to we don't want to lose
[1:14:49] time and steal God uh scrolling on our
[1:14:51] phone on Mindless stuff now if you if
[1:14:54] use it like I try to I use it for
[1:14:55] scriptures you know use it for message
[1:14:58] sermons you know use it for that's why I
[1:15:00] try to use it for the most part you know
[1:15:02] that that's use your time on the things
[1:15:05] of God hallelujah invest and meditate in
[1:15:08] the things of God hallelujah but look
[1:15:10] brother man was so humble he said I
[1:15:12] stole time from God remember he said
[1:15:16] before he was saved he said in 1926
[1:15:18] remember he started the church in 1933
[1:15:20] so seven years before he started that
[1:15:21] church he said he had made his model te
[1:15:25] Ford an
[1:15:26] idol he said I had my first little Model
[1:15:30] T Ford I was a sinner I would just shine
[1:15:33] that little thing all day Sunday to make
[1:15:35] it shine stay home didn't go to church
[1:15:38] and shined it what if today I tried to
[1:15:41] find one piece of that car it's gone you
[1:15:43] couldn't do it it's
[1:15:45] finished just simple things like this
[1:15:49] can become
[1:15:51] Idols right and that's what I'm talking
[1:15:54] about Major backsliding versus minor
[1:16:00] backsliding um last quote is this the
[1:16:03] last quote from
[1:16:05] brother oh I got
[1:16:09] two this is the 1954 now brother R's
[1:16:11] answering a question this is questions
[1:16:13] and ansers 54 and the brother's I think
[1:16:15] it's a brother he's asking can I be
[1:16:17] re-baptized and brother Ram says because
[1:16:21] he said he backslid he said on
[1:16:22] backsliding I wish somebody would ask me
[1:16:24] that so he was waiting for that question
[1:16:25] I like that brother I was waiting for
[1:16:27] this question somebody asked me this
[1:16:28] question in other words I I want the
[1:16:29] church to know exactly where I stand on
[1:16:31] this so he's probably asked it many
[1:16:33] times but he said I wish somebody would
[1:16:35] ask me that but on backsliding remember
[1:16:37] you backslide every day there's no way
[1:16:39] at all for you to keep out of it but
[1:16:41] remember there's quotes on the other
[1:16:42] side brother says you don't have to
[1:16:44] sin so if you have quotes on the both
[1:16:46] sides I just say I don't know let's go
[1:16:48] back to the word of God the word of God
[1:16:50] says you have to Die daily so at some
[1:16:52] point you might I'll would say like this
[1:16:54] you might not have sinned yet but when
[1:16:56] you feel the Temptation you kill that
[1:16:57] Temptation you die to that and then you
[1:17:00] have Victory the rest of the day now
[1:17:02] this is a minor thing but I'm just
[1:17:04] laying in there because we have quotes
[1:17:05] on both sides right and I know last time
[1:17:07] brother cam was here he preached that
[1:17:09] with the restoration remember that
[1:17:11] because you said you really like that
[1:17:11] sermon that's right I remember that and
[1:17:14] uh he said uh he said
[1:17:17] uh yeah about uh what was it oh yeah he
[1:17:20] said you can live so close to God that
[1:17:22] the devil don't know what to do with you
[1:17:24] like Moses
[1:17:25] right yeah Moses the devil got rid of
[1:17:28] Moses because he didn't know what to do
[1:17:30] with him he just obeys the word all the
[1:17:32] time amen so that there's a quote on
[1:17:34] that but you also have this quote which
[1:17:36] said you can't help it you're going to
[1:17:37] backslide every day at some point so I
[1:17:40] take it like this if it's possible I'm
[1:17:42] going to try to live a day without
[1:17:43] sinning but y'all say like this most
[1:17:45] days I'm going to backslide in my mind
[1:17:48] and I'm going to start thinking about
[1:17:49] things I shouldn't think
[1:17:51] about and I'm going to start uh
[1:17:54] meditating on things I shouldn't
[1:17:55] meditate about and so I've got to say
[1:17:57] God I backslid in my thoughts I've done
[1:17:59] a minor sin because I know the thinking
[1:18:02] of it is just the same as doing it
[1:18:04] because it will lead to
[1:18:06] it right it's not it's not exactly the
[1:18:09] same as doing that but I know if I don't
[1:18:11] stop it it could lead to that that's
[1:18:13] right and I've got to root out my heart
[1:18:15] I got to root that sin out of my heart I
[1:18:17] want you to wash out my heart and I'm
[1:18:20] returning in my thoughts to God
[1:18:22] Amen I didn't backslide physically I
[1:18:25] didn't backslide and actually commit the
[1:18:27] sin the actual literal sin because
[1:18:29] remember sin has four
[1:18:31] stages lust uh enticed lust conceived
[1:18:35] sin death so first you get enticed but
[1:18:38] you haven't sinned yet then lust
[1:18:40] conceives that's that's what I'm talking
[1:18:42] about that's the backsliding right there
[1:18:44] you start conceiving it think about in
[1:18:46] your mind you received something start
[1:18:48] planning it out but if you stop it there
[1:18:50] praise God stop it right there amen
[1:18:53] everybody see the visual there is that
[1:18:54] right there it's a four-step process
[1:18:56] stop it right there amen say Lord I back
[1:18:59] in my thoughts I'm coming back to God
[1:19:01] give me a transform mind Hallelujah I
[1:19:04] return to you in my thoughts I'm
[1:19:06] returning in my mind receive me I know
[1:19:08] you will and be a father unto me
[1:19:10] hallelujah
[1:19:11] amen oh this is deep and Rich here today
[1:19:14] praise God Amen and I was wondering do I
[1:19:17] preach this what do I preach
[1:19:19] here it was just
[1:19:21] so so uh unusual
[1:19:27] but on back siding remember you backside
[1:19:29] every day there's no way at all for you
[1:19:30] to keep out of it well one place you
[1:19:32] said there's no way other place he said
[1:19:33] there is a way he says all right but you
[1:19:36] backslide to the people in the church
[1:19:38] but not before God that's a good point
[1:19:41] right God's already forgiven all your
[1:19:43] sins just like job
[1:19:44] remember God bragging on job he's a
[1:19:47] perfect man he's a perfect man God comes
[1:19:49] down I don't even know who you who this
[1:19:51] who is this
[1:19:52] man I even know him of course he didn't
[1:19:54] that but he knew him but he's humbling
[1:19:56] him he's humbling him right so brother
[1:19:59] ad even differentiates that you're
[1:20:01] forgiven in heaven but the TR the sin on
[1:20:05] Earth you still got to deal
[1:20:06] with you've sinned on Earth but already
[1:20:09] in heaven you're already
[1:20:10] forgiven everybody see that brother and
[1:20:14] so brother tries to say this that's what
[1:20:16] he tries to say he said you backside on
[1:20:19] Christ but you don't on God now I don't
[1:20:21] know about that quotee I don't
[1:20:22] understand that
[1:20:25] so Christ would be the high priest so
[1:20:26] brother man I don't know if he's trying
[1:20:27] to say like you know you have to confess
[1:20:30] your sin to the high priest which you do
[1:20:32] right if we confess our faults what do
[1:20:33] he's faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:20:35] all sins right so that's interesting you
[1:20:37] have to go uh to Christ and say Christ
[1:20:40] forgive me but God in God's eyes you're
[1:20:42] already a forgiven son or God or son or
[1:20:44] daughter of God with a theophany body
[1:20:45] praise God so that that's what I feel
[1:20:47] like brother Ram's saying but he doesn't
[1:20:50] give any Scripture other than
[1:20:52] Paul he said you backside on Christ but
[1:20:55] you don't on God cuz if when you sin
[1:20:58] you'd be
[1:20:58] gone so that's why he says God has
[1:21:01] already forgiven you but you have to
[1:21:02] repent to the high priest that's what it
[1:21:03] looks like to me and we have scripture
[1:21:05] for that he said but you're constantly
[1:21:08] falling everybody say constantly ready
[1:21:10] constantly you're constantly falling
[1:21:13] Paul had to die every day is that right
[1:21:15] he had to die every day repent every day
[1:21:17] and just constantly repenting all the
[1:21:19] time so here I this is what I feel I
[1:21:22] feel like brother Ram he got this
[1:21:23] question at a time time when he was
[1:21:25] going through tough
[1:21:26] battles right because how many know how
[1:21:28] many have ever been on the mountain top
[1:21:30] you feel like boy I'm just really
[1:21:31] overcoming I'm really in a say I'm
[1:21:32] really in a season of Victory but other
[1:21:34] times you're like I keep fighting
[1:21:36] battles every day I got to confess all
[1:21:38] day every day other times when you're
[1:21:40] got in the victory Hallelujah I'm just
[1:21:41] praising God I'm just serving God loving
[1:21:43] God other times be like am I even saved
[1:21:45] what's wrong with me or do I even have
[1:21:46] the Holy Ghost what's wrong with me and
[1:21:48] the church
[1:21:49] said so you get quotes from Brother
[1:21:51] brand so that's why I believe that's how
[1:21:53] it is with brother brandom there was
[1:21:54] time times he was so close to God right
[1:21:57] there's times he had to go through
[1:21:58] trials just like you and I
[1:22:00] do brother said don't you think you
[1:22:02] don't get he said don't think that I
[1:22:04] don't get spells I get spells just like
[1:22:06] you he said the devil come and say you
[1:22:08] don't have any
[1:22:09] friends and then he said I'll stick this
[1:22:11] in the devil's Faith look look at those
[1:22:13] look at those licensed place out there
[1:22:14] they're from Alabama uh they're from
[1:22:16] Georgia they're from Kentucky they're
[1:22:17] from Ohio see devil I've got friends so
[1:22:20] tell the devil where he's wrong I know I
[1:22:23] preached that before
[1:22:25] just a good
[1:22:27] reminder he says repent every day and
[1:22:29] just constantly repenting all the time
[1:22:31] if Paul had to do that now look how look
[1:22:33] how he honors Paul if Paul had to do
[1:22:36] that repent every day then I'm going to
[1:22:39] have to do it too aren't
[1:22:42] you so he says
[1:22:44] Paul Paul me
[1:22:47] you we are all
[1:22:49] humans we all need Grace that's right we
[1:22:53] all backslide in our minds almost every
[1:22:55] day because I'm not trying to make a
[1:22:57] Doctrine I'm just trying to say that if
[1:23:00] we backside and turn away in our minds
[1:23:02] God has Mercy for
[1:23:04] us and don't get over sorrowed like the
[1:23:07] Bible says there remember that God is a
[1:23:09] gracious Redeemer oh I'm already past 12
[1:23:12] let's stand our feet and I'll just read
[1:23:13] this last quote as we're standing
[1:23:15] here musicians can come there by God's
[1:23:18] grace this is from the Third Exodus I
[1:23:20] love this uh brother talking about the
[1:23:22] Third Exodus remember the first Exodus
[1:23:24] was is is out of Egypt the second was
[1:23:26] The Exodus of the spiritual Exodus from
[1:23:28] the Old Testament to the New Testament
[1:23:30] in Acts chapter 2 so Israel out of Egypt
[1:23:33] Acts 2 was the second Exodus he says the
[1:23:35] third is the New Testament Church
[1:23:37] raptured to Glory so the Third Exodus is
[1:23:40] what we're looking for right oh yeah
[1:23:43] first Exodus natural to Natural Glory
[1:23:46] second one is uh spirit I'm sorry Old
[1:23:48] Testament to New Testament spiritual
[1:23:50] Exodus from old Covenant to New Covenant

[1:24:18] done I never thought this would turn out
[1:24:20] like this uh Third Exodus and remember
[1:24:23] brother said this election which I think
[1:24:25] he's speaking of this uh Exodus but this
[1:24:29] Exodus is coming now is not just going
[1:24:31] to another Nation it's going into
[1:24:34] Glory where their names are wrote on the
[1:24:37] Lamb's Book of Life not under the
[1:24:39] natural little animal lamb that Israel
[1:24:42] brought out because they could backslide
[1:24:45] from there and go
[1:24:47] back brother saying in the Old Testament
[1:24:49] Israel would constantly
[1:24:52] backslide he says but this Exodus can't
[1:24:57] backslide glory amen this Exodus into
[1:25:00] heaven cannot backslide why because
[1:25:03] death is swallowed up in life Hallelujah
[1:25:06] there it is amen there's no backsliding

[1:25:35] Lamb of God that was slain before the
[1:25:37] foundation of the world and their names
[1:25:38] were put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:25:40] before the foundation of the world and
[1:25:42] they're in there they're elected and
[1:25:45] when the light flashes over them like
[1:25:47] that them denominational walls drop away
[1:25:50] and here they come come out from among
[1:25:52] them the holy spirit in these last he
