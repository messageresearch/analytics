[20:35] remembering how god has used brother
[20:36] brian in such wonderful ways here
[20:39] um helping us and two wonderful
[20:41] testimonies was
[20:43] when he prayed for sister mary ellen now
[20:45] she left the message now but
[20:46] before she left she could hardly walk
[20:49] she came in one service she fell in her
[20:50] tailbone
[20:51] and she came up for prayer brother brian
[20:53] prayed for her and she said as soon as
[20:55] she sat down she was instantly healed so
[20:58] that was a great move of god
[21:00] through our brother brian and then uh
[21:03] there's been numerous but the one time
[21:05] uh there was a brother there's one of
[21:07] our deacons a while ago
[21:09] was kind of against me and brother brian
[21:12] said that he come he was while he was
[21:13] preaching he just stopped and told that
[21:15] deacon he said
[21:16] do what you've got to do and then
[21:19] the next wednesday he resigned and left
[21:21] the church
[21:22] and i've had so much peace since then
[21:25] and i thank the lord for that it was
[21:26] such a
[21:27] it was such a move of the holy spirit
[21:30] it was it reminded me of jesus not not
[21:32] an evil way and i pray for this
[21:34] this man i love this man they reminded
[21:37] me of jesus when he told judas you got
[21:38] to do what you got to do
[21:41] so um it just was so led of the holy
[21:44] spirit and i thank the lord for
[21:45] a spirit-led man praise god
[21:48] how many appreciate that a man who's led
[21:51] by the holy spirit i remember
[21:51] brother remember when brother bryan went
[21:52] around praying for everybody around the
[21:53] whole church
[21:55] and uh you said that was such a
[21:57] strengthening
[21:58] uh for you brother just have somebody
[22:00] come and lay hands on you you know and
[22:02] i just remember that that was such a
[22:03] wonderful time in the lord so i
[22:05] appreciate brother brian
[22:07] uh being led of the holy spirit i've
[22:08] always loved this brother
[22:10] so we thank the lord because it's all
[22:12] god's grace amen
[22:13] they that are led by the spirit of god
[22:15] are the sons of god
[22:17] amen so let's remember these prayer
[22:19] requests brother brian said please pray

[29:41] [Music]
[29:46] to the lord here
[29:54] [Music]
[30:04] [Music]
[30:07] i wanted to give just a short testimony
[30:10] before
[30:12] i know 2020 was a hard year for a lot of
[30:14] people um
[30:16] it was really really hard for me and i
[30:18] know jesse's talked about how it was
[30:19] such a blessing for him
[30:21] it was for me but not in the same ways i
[30:25] never felt so weak in myself as i did
[30:28] last year
[30:29] the usual 20 20 things that were just
[30:31] hard for everybody but
[30:32] it was the hardest pregnancy i've had
[30:34] out of the eight
[30:35] just physically and mentally i just felt
[30:38] like i couldn't mother my children the
[30:40] way i used to and just
[30:42] i felt so weak and then just dealing
[30:43] with a lot of fear and anxiety like i
[30:46] never had before i don't tend to be a
[30:47] fearful or anxious person but it just
[30:50] hit me so hard
[30:52] but i just want to thank the lord
[30:54] because though that year was really hard
[30:55] he gave me
[30:56] a lot of help and deliverance through
[30:58] just the sermons preached here like
[31:00] um the job series that brother jesse was
[31:03] preaching like
[31:04] it meant a lot to me and um when brother
[31:07] cam was here last and he preached about
[31:09] being in goshen i got so much
[31:12] deliverance from all that fear and
[31:14] anxiety that i've been having and any
[31:16] time it starts to creep back on i just
[31:18] say no i'm in goshen
[31:19] i can see what's going on in egypt but
[31:21] i'm in goshen
[31:23] and and now with the joshua areas just
[31:25] seeing that um and how that's applied to
[31:27] me
[31:28] in this last year and now coming into a
[31:29] new year and just feeling a new sense of
[31:32] of peace and i just want to thank the
[31:34] lord um because he used the
[31:36] those trials of last year just to show
[31:38] me how weak i am
[31:40] on my own and how ignorant of it i had
[31:43] become
[31:44] like joe was um jesse had preached that
[31:47] knit i was like oh that's what this last
[31:49] year was i just had become ignorant
[31:52] of the extent of my own weakness and god
[31:55] showed it to me
[31:57] and i just can say that i am nothing on
[32:00] my own
[32:01] there is nothing good in me that means
[32:02] so much more to me now than it did
[32:04] before
[32:05] this trial um and it's just given me
[32:08] a renewed love for the lord and so i
[32:10] wanted to share that because
[32:11] it's been on my heart for a long time
[32:13] and so this song really means a lot to
[32:15] me
[32:15] i'll try to get through it without
[32:17] crying
[32:22] [Music]
[32:27] what gift of grace is
[32:30] jesus my redeemer
[32:35] there is no more for
[32:38] heaven now to give
[32:43] he is my joy my
[32:47] righteousness and freedom
[32:50] my steadfast love my deep and boundless
[32:56] peace
[32:58] to this i hope my hope is
[33:10] [Music]
[33:14] oh how strange and divine
[33:18] i can't see mommy is mine yet
[33:24] but through christ in me
[33:27] [Music]
[33:33] the night
[33:37] i is not forsaken
[33:41] for by my side the savior he will stay
[33:49] i labor on
[33:55] [Music]
[34:04] foreign
[34:07] [Music]
[34:12] through the deepest valley
[34:16] he will lead
[34:22] [Music]
[34:30] but through christ in
[34:35] [Music]
[34:46] the future the price
[34:50] it has
[35:05] [Music]
[35:13] has been defeated
[35:16] [Music]
[35:22] [Music]
[35:25] all the chains are released
[35:29] [Music]
[35:34] [Music]
[35:37] in me
[35:44] with every breath i
[35:47] long to follow jesus
[35:59] and day by day i know he
[36:04] will renew
[36:07] until i stand with joy

[50:19] here to minister to you all
[50:21] so if you would let's just get right
[50:23] into the word
[50:25] i'll turn to first samuel chapter eight
[50:28] and verse four and as usual i'm nervous
[50:32] as all get out but the uh
[50:34] it's not as bad as i'm kind of concerned
[50:36] because it's not as bad as usual so i
[50:38] don't know
[50:40] either i'm in the will of the lord or i
[50:42] don't know the nervousness just
[50:44] isn't as bad as it usually is maybe i'm
[50:46] just comfortable here
[50:52] so first samuel chapter eight and verse
[50:54] four
[50:58] it says uh then all the elders of israel
[51:02] gathered to gather themselves together
[51:05] and came to samuel unto rhema
[51:09] and said unto him behold thou art old
[51:11] and thy sons walk not in thy ways
[51:14] now make us a king to judge us like all
[51:16] the nations
[51:19] but the thing displeased samuel
[51:22] he kind of took it a little personal but
[51:25] the
[51:26] and and very much so because he's he's
[51:28] seeing a change
[51:29] uh take place that he's that he's not
[51:31] happy with
[51:32] uh but the thing displeased samuel when
[51:35] they said give us a king
[51:37] to judge us and samuel prayed unto the
[51:40] lord
[51:41] and the lord said unto samuel hearken
[51:43] unto the voice of the people
[51:45] in all that they say unto thee for they
[51:47] have not rejected thee
[51:49] but they have rejected me that i should
[51:52] not
[51:52] reign over them and i if i
[51:56] have a title i'd like to title or just
[51:58] speak on the rejected king this morning
[51:59] amen is it okay to preach on jesus i
[52:02] know it's okay to preach on jesus here
[52:04] so
[52:05] let's look to the lord in prayer most
[52:08] gracious heavenly father we just thank
[52:10] you for
[52:10] all that you do for us we thank you for
[52:12] another day that you've given us may we
[52:14] rejoice and be glad in it father no
[52:18] the lord we just thank you for your word
[52:19] we thank you for the time
[52:21] the privilege to be able to come behind
[52:24] the sacred desk and minister your word
[52:26] one more time
[52:27] but father i just pray that you would
[52:30] help me to get out of the way to let
[52:31] your word come forth oh god for there's
[52:33] nothing good in me
[52:34] but lord you're all good there's nothing
[52:37] uh
[52:39] there's nothing about you that isn't
[52:40] good and and you're the one that we want
[52:42] to lean on today and
[52:44] every day every hour and uh just
[52:47] again i thank you for the patience that
[52:49] you have for us we
[52:51] we thank you for the long suffering for
[52:52] we make many mistakes where we have that
[52:54] human element that gets in our way all
[52:56] the time
[52:57] and uh lord we just pray that you would
[52:59] forgive us of every sin every iniquity o
[53:01] god that would
[53:02] be displeasing unto you and uh that we
[53:04] can come forth and have a confidence to
[53:06] receive
[53:06] what we have need of from you today
[53:09] those that would be sick and afflicted
[53:10] we pray that you would touch them in
[53:11] their bodies as you as you have touched
[53:13] me in my body so many times on god i
[53:15] know that thou art healer
[53:16] and i know that you were more than able
[53:18] to to touch those situations oh god
[53:21] and lord i'm about to turn into a baby i
[53:23] just thank you so much for
[53:25] for your healing hand that you've placed
[53:27] upon me and my family
[53:28] and the different ones that's that's
[53:30] close to me and i just
[53:32] thank you for that lord i know that
[53:34] you're more than able to meet the needs
[53:37] so father help me guide me guard my lips
[53:39] i wouldn't speak anything contrary but
[53:41] lord made
[53:42] may be a blessing to your people that
[53:44] for that's always been my desire
[53:45] that's that's a that's a whole thing
[53:47] that that i want to do is just
[53:49] just to be a blessing to the people and
[53:52] uh lord we just
[53:54] uh ask all things in the name of jesus
[53:56] christ amen
[53:58] maybe see thank you very much
[54:02] i'm just going to go ahead and get
[54:03] comfortable in the saddle here
[54:08] kind of hard to fight with a jacket on
[54:11] i say that because brother jim says that
[54:13] often
[54:16] but uh we see here with samuel that he's
[54:19] he's uh he was sulking a little bit uh
[54:22] and and as i said rightly so uh
[54:26] because he knew what they were asking
[54:28] and
[54:29] he didn't think that they really knew
[54:30] what they were asking so he was
[54:32] he was kind of sulking that heaven i've
[54:34] been here i've been here
[54:37] with you all these years uh have i
[54:39] deceived you out of
[54:41] uh have i deceived you out of money have
[54:43] i deceived you
[54:44] out of any cattle or anything like that
[54:46] have i not
[54:47] prophesied have i not spoken everything
[54:49] unto the lord of what he said unto me to
[54:51] do
[54:52] that i have prophesied and it's come to
[54:53] pass so why
[54:55] do you want a king you have god to rule
[54:58] over you
[54:58] so he's seeing that they're changing
[55:00] from the spiritual
[55:02] over to the natural they're giving up on
[55:04] the supernatural they're giving up on
[55:05] the spiritual and they're wanting to
[55:07] take on the natural things
[55:08] so you want a worldly ruler you're going
[55:10] to live by his rules
[55:12] you're under his authority now jesus
[55:14] taught us that render unto caesar what a
[55:16] caesar
[55:16] and render unto god what is god so be
[55:18] careful what you asked for
[55:20] and he's trying to tell the people the
[55:21] the jews that be careful what you're
[55:23] asking for
[55:24] i don't think you understand what you're
[55:25] asking for because once you get this
[55:27] king do you not know what he's going to
[55:29] do to you
[55:30] he's going to take all your people
[55:31] because they have to of course it's
[55:33] going to create a lot of jobs but
[55:34] you know we could kind of see that in
[55:36] something like that in this day hey we
[55:38] need jobs we need people to get paid for
[55:40] but they're going to take the people
[55:41] the king is going to take the people
[55:43] because they need um
[55:44] people to make the armor and the swords
[55:46] and all that for the for the warriors
[55:48] they they need
[55:49] uh food for the army so the
[55:51] confectionaries are going to need cooks
[55:52] they're going to need maids they're
[55:53] going to need
[55:54] all these things and they're going to
[55:55] put them in as servants and they're
[55:57] going to take the people from your
[55:59] families
[56:01] and so he's trying to try to have them
[56:04] reconsider their thought
[56:06] but the lord said don't worry about that
[56:08] they're not rejecting you samuel
[56:10] it's me that they're rejecting
[56:13] if they if that's what they want i'm
[56:14] going to give them what they want
[56:16] they're going to pay for it later
[56:17] amen so
[56:22] so out of their stubbornness of their
[56:24] heart they rejected him once again
[56:27] you know we see all through from the
[56:29] time of moses and
[56:30] and even from the beginning of time that
[56:32] he was rejected over and over
[56:33] all the way to to revelation it's just
[56:36] rejection after rejection after
[56:37] rejection
[56:38] but he has a mind of mercy to con to
[56:41] take them back eventually when they
[56:43] repent for it amen
[56:44] but they they still have that rejection
[56:48] and sometimes we do that because brother
[56:50] branham taught us that
[56:52] you know in order to believe the devil's
[56:53] lie you've got to step over god's word
[56:56] to believe the devil's lie is that right
[56:58] so we have a rejection when we do the
[57:00] things that we want to do
[57:02] and and you have that little voice
[57:03] incentive don't do that you shouldn't be
[57:05] doing that
[57:06] you know you you need to go over here
[57:08] just stay away from that
[57:10] you know that that's that conscious that
[57:11] we got to thank god for that we have
[57:13] that amen
[57:15] but see i'm i'm sure that uh kind of
[57:19] if you go back and read a little bit i
[57:21] think it might be the first and second
[57:22] verse it's talking about
[57:24] the how the suns were were taken
[57:27] taking advantage of the people uh they
[57:30] were deceiving so the people were
[57:31] probably tired of of seeing that is this
[57:33] the legacy of samuel that we're going to
[57:35] have to rule over us when samuel dies
[57:37] you know we want something else so i can
[57:39] kind of see where
[57:40] where where they're thinking about the
[57:42] the future but their mind
[57:43] mind was on something carnal a what man
[57:47] was going to rule over us not realizing
[57:49] that it was the spirit of god
[57:50] in samuel that was rolling over them it
[57:52] wasn't samuel that was doing the ruling
[57:55] but it was the spirit
[57:56] within sin how easily we overlook those
[58:00] things
[58:01] because we look through it through a
[58:02] carnal mind and not a spiritual mind
[58:04] see sometimes as ministers we we might
[58:07] feel that
[58:08] well the people just aren't listening to
[58:09] me i just wasted my time with these
[58:12] people
[58:12] you know we ought not to think like that
[58:14] i hope we don't think like that
[58:16] i don't think like that but uh usually
[58:18] it's the other way
[58:22] but you know some people get to why do i
[58:25] even bother to preach nobody's listening
[58:27] to me
[58:27] they're turning away but if i can only
[58:30] preach like so and so
[58:31] if i could get the people excited see
[58:33] people we just want the entertainment
[58:35] value sometimes
[58:36] and that's what we look forward to and
[58:38] and some of the ministers
[58:39] you know brother daryl ward i i think
[58:41] highly of the brother he's got a lot of
[58:43] stuff in him he's just a wonderful
[58:44] minister and he blesses my heart
[58:46] but he's charismatic he gets people
[58:48] excited you get jumping and shouting but
[58:50] i've been in a couple where there
[58:52] weren't
[58:53] there wasn't so much jumping and
[58:54] shouting were we still blessed
[58:56] absolutely we were still blessed
[58:57] so it doesn't have to come that way
[58:59] every single service amen
[59:01] it's what you get from the lord it's
[59:03] what you put into the service
[59:04] is what you're going to get out of the
[59:06] service amen it's not the man it's
[59:08] it's you pulling on the gift of the man
[59:10] it's not the man coming forth amen
[59:13] but it's what you pull from it so you
[59:15] can convince you
[59:16] you just can't convince a man when he's
[59:18] got his mind made up you cannot convince
[59:20] a man
[59:20] otherwise so when they had their mind
[59:22] made up samuel
[59:24] god just said you know what they've got
[59:25] their mind made up give it to him samuel
[59:28] give it to him but you know only if i
[59:30] could preach like so and so
[59:32] you know but sometimes i
[59:36] i don't even i don't even think i'm that
[59:38] good enough to preach you know i'm not
[59:40] that great
[59:41] great of a minister but and i struggled
[59:43] with that so many some
[59:45] for so many years i struggled with that
[59:47] oh if i can only preach like so-and-so
[59:49] and just get the people excited because
[59:50] i wanted the people to get so blessed
[59:52] but i had to finally had to come to
[59:54] terms with that i think i said it here
[59:56] and i think it was when brother darrell
[59:58] ward was preaching and right
[1:00:00] in the middle of his sermon it had
[1:00:01] nothing to do with what he was preaching
[1:00:04] on he just came out and said you can't
[1:00:05] preach like so and so
[1:00:07] you have to do it according to your gift
[1:00:08] and wow that just hit me like a ton of
[1:00:10] bricks
[1:00:11] and i think it was shortly after that
[1:00:13] and brother andy's saying a song about
[1:00:15] uh
[1:00:18] how all the people how god's people want
[1:00:20] to be around the table
[1:00:21] but nobody wants to go out and work in
[1:00:23] the field and and that it was
[1:00:25] all around that time i think and that's
[1:00:27] when i i was ordained as a minister i
[1:00:29] just said forget it you know what
[1:00:31] i'm just going to go with it and uh if
[1:00:33] the lord's going to keep blessing it
[1:00:34] then the lord's going to bless it so
[1:00:37] kind of a side note but
[1:00:39] getting back to the ministers and the
[1:00:40] charismatic you know we look for that
[1:00:42] as an entertainment value because it
[1:00:44] might help us keep us awake i don't know
[1:00:46] uh because of somebody's monotone
[1:00:49] they're just speaking reading reading
[1:00:51] your stories and it just kind of allows
[1:00:53] you to sleep
[1:00:54] uh heat for me it just puts if if it's
[1:00:56] real warm
[1:00:57] it just about puts me to sleep you know
[1:01:00] uh
[1:01:00] it's it's nothing of the nothing of the
[1:01:03] preacher because i'm enjoying what the
[1:01:04] preacher saying so
[1:01:06] if you fall asleep i understand you know
[1:01:08] some people were just tired if you work
[1:01:09] all week
[1:01:10] you know i understand but i've heard
[1:01:14] some great speakers
[1:01:15] that you know so preach some marvelous
[1:01:17] messages that don't even serve the lord
[1:01:19] anymore
[1:01:20] so it's not in the it's not in the
[1:01:22] charisma
[1:01:23] of the man so we cannot look at man
[1:01:27] so we have to look at the spirit and the
[1:01:28] motive of what's being preached amen
[1:01:31] see i'm i'm just putting myself as a
[1:01:33] target
[1:01:34] now you're going to critique the whole
[1:01:35] thing
[1:01:37] you should you should be paying
[1:01:39] attention to what i'm saying yeah
[1:01:41] no
[1:01:44] but when people don't want to hear the
[1:01:46] word they're not rejecting us
[1:01:48] they're they're rejecting the lord just
[1:01:49] as samuel said or just as god told
[1:01:51] samuel
[1:01:52] they're not rejecting you they're
[1:01:53] rejecting me
[1:01:58] and some people just can't they just
[1:02:00] don't want to hear the word
[1:02:02] but some people some people in the
[1:02:04] message they want to give a
[1:02:05] denominational
[1:02:06] uh person at the time of day oh oh you
[1:02:09] go to you go to the
[1:02:10] denominational church i'm kind of done
[1:02:14] with this conversation because i
[1:02:15] i know where that's got to lead you and
[1:02:17] i don't agree with you and they just cut
[1:02:18] them out you know
[1:02:20] and they just they just consider it well
[1:02:22] it's us for
[1:02:23] no more you know you know but i'd rather
[1:02:26] be in a house meeting with
[1:02:28] with the lord blessing and the gifts
[1:02:29] working then
[1:02:31] then you know with with the uh the gifts
[1:02:34] of god in operation
[1:02:36] and then in the finest building you know
[1:02:39] and packed full with dead people and a
[1:02:41] dead servant say man
[1:02:43] but you know there are some people that
[1:02:46] they just wouldn't recognize the word if
[1:02:47] you loaded it in a double barrel shotgun
[1:02:49] and gave them a good old pentecostal
[1:02:50] holy ghost
[1:02:51] blast with the shotgun they still won't
[1:02:53] see it you know uh it's it's just
[1:02:55] it's just the way it is uh some people
[1:02:57] can see it some people cannot some
[1:02:59] people who are ordained to
[1:03:00] to eternal life and some people are
[1:03:02] ordained to uh
[1:03:04] eternal death eternal separation but you
[1:03:07] know
[1:03:07] but we want to be where the spirit is
[1:03:09] for where the spirit is there is liberty
[1:03:11] right
[1:03:11] so that's my desire but we want to be
[1:03:15] like other people
[1:03:16] something you know and it's okay to have
[1:03:18] an influence of other people and try to
[1:03:19] be
[1:03:20] uh like somebody else you know brother
[1:03:22] brandon talked about
[1:03:23] uh
[1:03:26] you have a neighbor that paints her
[1:03:28] house well all of a sudden you just go
[1:03:29] through
[1:03:30] the neighborhood they're going to paint
[1:03:31] their their their porch steps the same
[1:03:33] color as the neighbors porch steps and
[1:03:34] you know trying to be like the joneses
[1:03:36] and he he thought about
[1:03:38] if or he talked about if there was a a
[1:03:41] woman that
[1:03:43] wore a certain hat the church uh that
[1:03:46] you just watch about a week later if
[1:03:48] it's available if they can find another
[1:03:50] hat that's
[1:03:50] exactly like like it or uh closely
[1:03:54] resembles it
[1:03:55] they're gonna be wearing the same type
[1:03:56] of hat he said you just watch
[1:03:58] and because people just want to be like
[1:04:00] other people uh in some cases so they
[1:04:02] i mean like i said it's okay to pattern
[1:04:04] ourselves after people it's okay to have
[1:04:06] an influence of somebody else as long as
[1:04:08] it's a righteous person
[1:04:09] somebody that loves the word somebody
[1:04:11] that's dedicated and loyal to the word
[1:04:13] of god right man
[1:04:15] that's who we should pattern ourselves
[1:04:16] after is uh to be like jesus
[1:04:19] is is the one that we ought to be like
[1:04:22] you know we have these fads in this day
[1:04:24] uh and
[1:04:25] it's always been that way uh like
[1:04:27] brother brandon was talking about the
[1:04:28] hat
[1:04:29] uh i remember back when i was younger
[1:04:33] do you remember the exercise clothes you
[1:04:34] know the polyester
[1:04:36] uh exercise clothes you know everybody
[1:04:38] with sport those
[1:04:39] you know the exercise pants uh you know
[1:04:42] it was just nice to wear i used to like
[1:04:43] them i got into that too
[1:04:46] but now they have these goofy things
[1:04:47] called skinny jeans i don't even know
[1:04:49] what that is
[1:04:49] i mean they got to hold them up
[1:04:51] somebody's got to hold them up for them
[1:04:52] so they could jump into things i don't
[1:04:54] even know how they get them on
[1:04:58] those are some goofy looking clothes i
[1:05:00] don't know
[1:05:03] and they've got these daisy dukes daisy
[1:05:04] dukes have been around for a long time
[1:05:06] if you don't know what daisy dukes is
[1:05:07] it's a
[1:05:08] term after dukes of hazard uh the
[1:05:10] woman's name is daisy
[1:05:12] and she wore some real short shorts and
[1:05:14] you know that that's still popular in
[1:05:15] this day you see these girls wearing
[1:05:16] these short shorts
[1:05:18] and they hardly cover anything that a
[1:05:20] pair of underwear would cover more than
[1:05:21] what they
[1:05:22] got on you know those those real short
[1:05:24] shorts you know it's
[1:05:25] it it's just a it's just the way that it
[1:05:27] is do you ever notice
[1:05:28] that if you watch weather or the news or
[1:05:30] something like that
[1:05:31] they got men dressed to the hilt you
[1:05:33] know suit suit jacket
[1:05:35] you know tie and everything and here
[1:05:37] they got a woman in a skimpy dress
[1:05:39] now tell me that this isn't a sex age
[1:05:42] everything's directed toward the woman
[1:05:44] the woman the woman see they're
[1:05:45] rejecting god
[1:05:46] and now who's who's the god it's a
[1:05:49] goddess now
[1:05:50] because it's a woman they're always
[1:05:51] putting a woman on a platform
[1:05:53] you drive by a billboard what's on it
[1:05:56] it's some sexual relation to a woman
[1:05:59] sitting on that billboard because that's
[1:06:00] what they want your focus to be on
[1:06:03] right because that type of thing sells
[1:06:06] right it's perversion it draws to a
[1:06:09] man's desire
[1:06:11] which has drawn so many men away and and
[1:06:14] all this pornography in this day and
[1:06:16] that's what it is
[1:06:17] it's a scaled-down uh form of
[1:06:19] pornography when you
[1:06:20] when they're posting these women in
[1:06:21] bikinis on there it's a
[1:06:23] it's a slimmed-down form of pornography
[1:06:25] that's absolutely what it is
[1:06:27] it's a nakedness
[1:06:30] and people might be watching i don't
[1:06:32] know they might uh whatever i like to
[1:06:34] look at that stuff well that just shows
[1:06:35] that there's something wrong with you
[1:06:38] you got to get your heart right
[1:06:41] but we have all these fads that are
[1:06:43] going on and like i said we ought to
[1:06:44] pattern ourselves after
[1:06:46] somebody that's righteous so pattern
[1:06:47] ourselves after the word of god amen
[1:06:50] so where did the term christian come
[1:06:52] from everybody here i'm sure knows
[1:06:53] it's it's a term christ like that's why
[1:06:56] they were called christian
[1:06:57] you go to you go to uh florida and the
[1:07:00] people that are
[1:07:01] uh that live in florida are called what
[1:07:03] floridians right
[1:07:04] people that live in pennsylvania were
[1:07:06] pennsylvanians uh
[1:07:07] people that live in ohio ohioans so if
[1:07:10] we're
[1:07:11] in christ we ought to be christian right
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:14] so um but we are the ones that ought to
[1:07:16] be different
[1:07:17] we pray before we eat we go to church to
[1:07:20] hear the word before we do anything else
[1:07:21] we put it we set it as a precedence we
[1:07:24] have it first before sports or anything
[1:07:26] else dancing
[1:07:27] dance class ballet or or whatever it
[1:07:29] might be gymnastics
[1:07:30] we put the word of god first we go to
[1:07:32] church first and you ever notice when
[1:07:34] you do
[1:07:34] when we we try to have our boys into
[1:07:36] sports and and i think hope
[1:07:38] hope and shy they played softball for a
[1:07:40] little bit why is it that they always
[1:07:42] have to have it all wednesday
[1:07:44] and then they want to start having
[1:07:45] everything on sunday
[1:07:50] but that's what makes us different is
[1:07:52] that we don't go into those things
[1:07:54] we put god first because we want to hear
[1:07:56] the word of god amen
[1:07:57] we don't want to pattern ourselves after
[1:07:59] the world is that right so
[1:08:01] uh like i said we pray before we eat we
[1:08:03] go to church to hear the word
[1:08:04] uh it's set as a precedence we forgive
[1:08:06] people when they do the unthinkables all
[1:08:08] right
[1:08:09] and we pray for people even if they're
[1:08:12] not our friends
[1:08:14] even if they've despisedly despitefully
[1:08:16] used us in some way we still pray for
[1:08:18] them if they ask
[1:08:20] how many people have come to you you're
[1:08:22] not real friends with them but they know
[1:08:23] you're christian
[1:08:24] and and they don't want to they don't
[1:08:25] want to be a christian because it's
[1:08:26] boring but
[1:08:28] have a have a hard time in their house
[1:08:29] one time who are they going to come to
[1:08:31] hey uh would you pray for me and my
[1:08:33] family what
[1:08:34] i i thought you didn't believe in god
[1:08:37] now you're asking for prayer
[1:08:38] they know where to go to so you keep on
[1:08:40] doing what you're doing amen
[1:08:42] because they you're being salty they see
[1:08:44] something in your life
[1:08:45] and that's the only avenue that they
[1:08:46] know to go because they can't
[1:08:48] do they can't find anything else that
[1:08:49] works amen
[1:08:52] but we try to be compassionate where
[1:08:54] others think that you should leave it
[1:08:55] alone because
[1:08:56] uh they feel that uh they deserve what
[1:08:59] they're going through
[1:09:00] they shouldn't have done what they did
[1:09:01] but how many mistakes do we make
[1:09:03] amen and then we plead to god in prayer
[1:09:06] oh lord god forgive me i didn't mean to
[1:09:08] do that
[1:09:10] but some people that's just good enough
[1:09:12] oh lord forgive me because i drank this
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:14] and so on and so and i did this and that
[1:09:17] and then turn right around and go back
[1:09:19] and do the same thing
[1:09:20] the next day or the next week or the
[1:09:21] next month
[1:09:23] oh my god but we are called out people
[1:09:27] we're peculiar we're a holy nation not a
[1:09:30] country
[1:09:30] not a nation as a country but as a
[1:09:32] united people that's what makes a nation
[1:09:34] is a people are united
[1:09:36] that's what makes a nation so
[1:09:39] uh a royal priesthood like that slave
[1:09:42] man that held his head high
[1:09:44] you know when the the the the auction
[1:09:46] was going on and and
[1:09:48] i i hate to bring this up because i
[1:09:50] don't like slavery but i
[1:09:51] i like how uh it came up of how brother
[1:09:54] branham talked about it that
[1:09:55] uh he came to this man and there was
[1:09:57] something different about that man and
[1:09:58] he asked if he
[1:09:59] if they fed him any different well he
[1:10:01] said no we don't feed him any different
[1:10:03] well do you treat him any different does
[1:10:04] he have different quarters or
[1:10:05] and you know do you just pacify him or
[1:10:09] do you
[1:10:09] do you nurture him nope we don't do
[1:10:11] anything different but he acts that way
[1:10:13] because he found
[1:10:14] or he knows that he is the son of a king
[1:10:16] amen so we ought to
[1:10:18] conduct ourselves in the same way
[1:10:19] knowing that we are the
[1:10:21] son of a king or a daughter of a king
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:24] but we are not to be of the world or
[1:10:26] look like the world or smell like the
[1:10:28] world or even act like
[1:10:30] the world we were to be christian
[1:10:32] christ-like you know i can't even put
[1:10:34] you i think of the three hebrew children
[1:10:36] that went into the fiery furnace
[1:10:38] you know their their clothes weren't
[1:10:40] weren't uh
[1:10:41] burnt their hair wasn't singed there
[1:10:44] wasn't anything
[1:10:44] that was even wrong and even to the fine
[1:10:47] detail that it says
[1:10:48] they didn't even smell like smoke i
[1:10:52] can't
[1:10:52] i'm telling you brother sister i can't
[1:10:53] even load my wood stuff i can't even
[1:10:55] open the door and look in to see if it's
[1:10:57] okay without smelling like smoke i don't
[1:10:59] have to be in there it's just
[1:11:00] in the presence of the smoke so if they
[1:11:02] were in the fire and they couldn't even
[1:11:04] smell like smoke
[1:11:05] there was a presence in there amen there
[1:11:07] had to have been something there
[1:11:09] to even keep the keep the smell off of
[1:11:11] them
[1:11:12] oh we accept god's word his spirit his
[1:11:15] love and his chastening oh my
[1:11:17] those he loves he chastens how many
[1:11:20] likes to be chasing
[1:11:21] oh i don't like that whooping when it
[1:11:23] comes but i
[1:11:24] thank you lord for the correction you
[1:11:26] know because it puts you right back
[1:11:28] on track amen but we're not like cain
[1:11:31] who loved the creation more than the
[1:11:33] creator see cain rejected god's word
[1:11:35] when god plainly told him
[1:11:37] to if he did as abel did that he would
[1:11:39] do well is that right
[1:11:40] he said if you do what abel did then
[1:11:43] you're doing fine
[1:11:44] but if you don't sin lies at the doors
[1:11:47] all right
[1:11:48] so he gave him the choice he told him
[1:11:50] what the ultimatum was
[1:11:51] he told him what the outcome was going
[1:11:53] to be but cain still
[1:11:55] rejected his word and went the way that
[1:11:58] he wanted it to go is that right
[1:12:03] and then he went on to kill him because
[1:12:04] we know he was of a different kind he
[1:12:07] we know he was of a different breed is
[1:12:08] that right and it was jealousy
[1:12:10] that drove him to it he refused to do
[1:12:13] what was right
[1:12:15] he rejected what was right
[1:12:18] right he didn't want to be compared to
[1:12:22] abel because
[1:12:24] abel was a humble man and cain didn't
[1:12:27] want to be that he wanted to be the cool
[1:12:28] guy
[1:12:29] well i'm going to do something different
[1:12:30] you know it's just too boring to be on
[1:12:32] the straight and narrow path you know i
[1:12:33] want some excitement in my life
[1:12:39] but we know that he wasn't of god is
[1:12:40] that right
[1:12:42] we know that abel could accept uh
[1:12:45] what god had for the direction we know
[1:12:48] that
[1:12:49] abel was pleasing in the sight of god
[1:12:51] rebellion
[1:12:52] uh as we're told i i think it's in
[1:12:54] samuel or somewhere around there
[1:12:56] rebellion is as witchcraft
[1:12:57] now you might you might not get you get
[1:13:00] your candles together
[1:13:01] or whatever all your rocks or whatever
[1:13:03] it might be
[1:13:04] and and you might not be in or casting
[1:13:06] all these spells and
[1:13:07] and thinking about that but it's likened
[1:13:10] unto witchcraft
[1:13:12] when you are rebellious it's just like
[1:13:15] you're doing that same thing now is
[1:13:17] there one sin greater than the other no
[1:13:18] there is not one sin greater than the
[1:13:20] other
[1:13:21] sin is black sin is sin and that's it
[1:13:26] oh my
[1:13:32] give me a second i'm getting old
[1:13:37] and i'm getting out of shape
[1:13:41] round is a shape as a friend of mine at
[1:13:44] work says you know her co-worker
[1:13:46] he says round is a shape i'm in shape
[1:13:50] he's just funny
[1:13:53] but he can accept this condition we're
[1:13:55] all like you need to change your
[1:13:56] lifestyle
[1:13:58] you know this is bad for you and then he
[1:14:01] asked for help one time
[1:14:03] you know he he asked for help hey if you
[1:14:04] see me eating this knock it out of my
[1:14:06] hand so there was a fellow co-worker
[1:14:07] that obliged him
[1:14:09] so lo and behold somebody had donuts the
[1:14:11] next morning here he had a doughnut
[1:14:12] grabbed one
[1:14:13] on his merry way pow what'd you do that
[1:14:16] for
[1:14:17] you asked for help i'm giving it to you
[1:14:20] so you better be careful what you asked
[1:14:21] for
[1:14:22] you know if you really want help then
[1:14:24] accept the help that somebody's giving
[1:14:25] you
[1:14:30] amen but praise the lord
[1:14:34] i've been healed like i was saying i've
[1:14:36] been healed several times
[1:14:38] several times you know there for a
[1:14:40] little while i was going through some
[1:14:41] struggles
[1:14:42] you know what was that down to 130 135
[1:14:46] pounds i think
[1:14:47] somewhere around there and i'm usually
[1:14:49] at 165
[1:14:50] that's where i like to be i like to be
[1:14:51] at my optimum weight and praise god
[1:14:54] the other day i weighed myself i was 165
[1:14:56] pounds i weighed myself this morning
[1:14:58] 164 pounds so i'm back up to my optimum
[1:15:01] weight
[1:15:02] so i know that god is a healer
[1:15:08] and that's one of the things that they
[1:15:09] say uh it goes
[1:15:11] right along with crohn's you see crohn's
[1:15:13] patients you know that uh
[1:15:16] you know they go through it because they
[1:15:18] they don't have an appetite
[1:15:20] so they lose a lot of weight and that's
[1:15:21] one of the things with with crohn's
[1:15:23] patients
[1:15:24] and i feel bad for those crohn's
[1:15:25] patients and uh i'm not one of them
[1:15:28] and uh i just thank god that i think of
[1:15:31] my brother too
[1:15:32] because uh you know he's been
[1:15:39] he's been battling cancer since 2010
[1:15:42] and uh it started off with uh colorectal
[1:15:46] cancer
[1:15:46] and he's been battling it and i remember
[1:15:49] i went down and i got to that was the
[1:15:51] first time i got to pray with my brother
[1:15:53] i took a bible down for him we prayed
[1:15:55] over a cloth i gave him the cloth
[1:15:57] matter of fact i think it was off a
[1:15:59] dress shirt that i had because i was so
[1:16:01] pressed that i i just ripped the pocket
[1:16:03] off my shirt because i didn't have
[1:16:04] anything else
[1:16:06] and uh and i took it down to him and i
[1:16:08] got to pray with him
[1:16:10] and uh my my sister-in-law was telling
[1:16:13] us
[1:16:14] uh when they were up when when david was
[1:16:16] up they got to visit with him too
[1:16:18] and uh i'm trying not to get emotional
[1:16:21] but uh i was so happy that my brother
[1:16:25] came up to
[1:16:26] to see us i was just so happy but uh
[1:16:29] he's he's not skinny like me where he
[1:16:32] used to be skinnier than me
[1:16:34] um and he's over 202 he's what 212 i
[1:16:38] think something
[1:16:38] sorry brother uh kind of giving away his
[1:16:41] personal stuff but
[1:16:42] uh usually you don't see that in in
[1:16:45] cancer patients
[1:16:46] usually you see them very skinny and uh
[1:16:49] and
[1:16:50] because they're fighting you know their
[1:16:51] body is just fighting but my
[1:16:53] sister-in-law
[1:16:54] she told us i was so determined that my
[1:16:56] husband was not going to look like
[1:16:58] these these other cancer patients i'm
[1:17:01] going to do something different
[1:17:02] she fit like three scoops of ice cream
[1:17:05] every night
[1:17:05] so he's kind of on the other end of the
[1:17:07] spectrum which which is a good thing i'd
[1:17:09] rather
[1:17:09] see weight on him than than being skinny
[1:17:12] but i i just believe god is still
[1:17:14] working and working in his life amen
[1:17:17] i've not given up on him
[1:17:19] as long as there's still breath in his
[1:17:20] body i'm not giving up on him amen
[1:17:23] so i just thank the lord i just think
[1:17:26] it's all the prayers that's keeping him
[1:17:27] because he still works
[1:17:28] he still works full-time you know i
[1:17:31] think i've said it here before
[1:17:33] uh but he went in and saw the doctor
[1:17:36] well how many hours a week are you
[1:17:37] working you know
[1:17:38] uh 10 12 15 hours a week no 40 hours a
[1:17:41] week
[1:17:43] that's unheard of nobody works 40 hours
[1:17:46] a week you know nobody
[1:17:47] nobody works that much when they're
[1:17:48] undergoing uh
[1:17:50] chemotherapy radiation and all that
[1:17:52] stuff you know
[1:17:53] this is this is unbelievable well that's
[1:17:56] my god
[1:17:56] that's all i got to say that's all i
[1:17:58] have to say about that is that
[1:18:00] that's my god that i believe he's
[1:18:01] helping my brother and he's going to
[1:18:03] heal
[1:18:03] and i just believe that i so believe
[1:18:06] that
[1:18:07] but you know people say well it's hard
[1:18:10] how can you do that
[1:18:10] but you know uh be following the way of
[1:18:13] the lord
[1:18:14] it's a hard thing to do you know because
[1:18:16] people look at us
[1:18:17] at us differently you know people well
[1:18:20] that's so boring following all these
[1:18:22] rules and all that and
[1:18:23] then while you follow rules too you know
[1:18:26] if
[1:18:27] if you're walking freely you you're
[1:18:29] you've got to be following some rules
[1:18:30] too because if you weren't following
[1:18:31] them you'd be in jail
[1:18:34] but that's not why we follow the rules
[1:18:36] we follow the rules because we know
[1:18:38] that's what pleases god and we want to
[1:18:39] do what's pleasing unto him amen
[1:18:41] or you say well it's hard no the way of
[1:18:44] a transgressor is hard
[1:18:46] jesus said take my yoke upon you for my
[1:18:48] yoke is easy
[1:18:49] and my burden is light amen
[1:18:53] and we he said you shall find rest to
[1:18:55] your souls amen
[1:18:57] but when we yield to him we are not
[1:18:59] blinded by the things of the world
[1:19:00] we we don't become distracted amen kind
[1:19:03] of like samson now samson
[1:19:05] he took a different approach he got
[1:19:08] distracted because he was he was
[1:19:10] distracted by women
[1:19:11] and remember when i said a little bit
[1:19:12] ago that women is a distraction now
[1:19:15] women are up there put up there for
[1:19:17] mental worship amen
[1:19:19] so the the same it was a very weakness
[1:19:22] for samson because he was so focused on
[1:19:25] women
[1:19:26] right that's what took his heart from
[1:19:27] the lord be careful brothers
[1:19:30] yes be careful sisters that is not a man
[1:19:32] or a woman that's taking you
[1:19:34] away from the presence of the lord don't
[1:19:36] reject god over a human
[1:19:38] human being amen i see
[1:19:41] we know that we were taught that samsa
[1:19:44] gave god his muscles he gave him
[1:19:45] the gift that that god gave him he gave
[1:19:47] it to him in return as far as the
[1:19:49] muscles the strength
[1:19:50] as long as he didn't cut his hair as
[1:19:52] long as he followed that one thing he
[1:19:54] was good to go
[1:19:55] but he did not give god his heart all
[1:19:57] right
[1:19:58] amen i see look at samson when he was
[1:20:01] captured what did they do
[1:20:03] they took his eye out right they took
[1:20:05] his eyes out both of them
[1:20:07] why so he couldn't see his way for his
[1:20:08] escape
[1:20:10] he couldn't find his way he wouldn't be
[1:20:11] able to find his way out of there unless
[1:20:13] he was led by somebody amen
[1:20:15] didn't remember he even had to be be
[1:20:17] asked to be led to the two pillars that
[1:20:18] held up the building
[1:20:20] now nahash uh now see this seems to be a
[1:20:23] thing with the with the enemy
[1:20:24] nahash oh i can't remember where it is
[1:20:28] and
[1:20:29] uh i was with king david anyways
[1:20:32] but he wanted to take out the right
[1:20:34] right eye out of the metal oh this was
[1:20:35] right yeah it was right it was in samuel
[1:20:37] because it was right before
[1:20:38] uh saul took was was put in as king
[1:20:42] uh now nahash he wanted to take out the
[1:20:44] right eye the men of israel
[1:20:45] because it was a treaty he says you know
[1:20:47] what i'm going to do this because he
[1:20:48] wanted to embarrass israel
[1:20:50] he said you know what i want to pluck
[1:20:51] out the right eye of all your men of
[1:20:53] israel
[1:20:56] because he wanted to embarrass him as i
[1:20:58] said but
[1:20:59] now see that's what the enemy is trying
[1:21:01] to do is put the right eye out of god's
[1:21:03] people
[1:21:04] you notice you do you know what the
[1:21:05] right eye uh indicates
[1:21:07] the right that's the one that's
[1:21:08] spiritual now so you remember me talking
[1:21:11] about
[1:21:12] uh raising up a standard about how
[1:21:15] uh in in military uh
[1:21:18] the person that has a the the person
[1:21:20] that has has the authority the higher
[1:21:22] ranking individual walks on the right
[1:21:24] even our nation's flag it's on its own
[1:21:26] right
[1:21:28] which is a place of honor in the place
[1:21:30] of authority and jesus christ was raised
[1:21:32] up onto the right hand of the father is
[1:21:34] that right
[1:21:34] so right the right side shows authority
[1:21:37] it shows honor so it's spiritual this
[1:21:40] has ought to be our
[1:21:42] our spiritual eye ought to be the one
[1:21:44] that has the authority
[1:21:45] not the left eye to lead us astray man
[1:21:48] but our spiritual life
[1:21:50] ought to be leading us into the truth is
[1:21:52] that right
[1:21:53] but if he could put the spiritual sight
[1:21:55] out of your eye where you see the
[1:21:57] natural things and not the spiritual
[1:21:58] things
[1:21:59] he's got you whip right there long as
[1:22:01] you have churches and big places and
[1:22:03] find intellectual dressed people and so
[1:22:05] forth
[1:22:05] as long as your eye looks on looks on
[1:22:08] that and don't see the spiritual side
[1:22:10] the enemy's got you under his control
[1:22:12] because you don't
[1:22:13] know where you're going
[1:22:16] amen see we can get on board with things
[1:22:20] so easily
[1:22:21] that we become blinded to the way that
[1:22:23] is right not the way this seems to be
[1:22:25] right
[1:22:25] that's what the devil does is he blinds
[1:22:27] the people from seeing the way to
[1:22:29] their freedom he blinds them from it
[1:22:34] but you know he can only deceive the
[1:22:35] elect if possible
[1:22:37] see if the devil can't keep you from
[1:22:38] seeing a truth he will push you
[1:22:40] overboard with it
[1:22:43] see we got these little pet doctrines
[1:22:45] that that go around it it's nothing new
[1:22:47] they've had it
[1:22:48] way back when it's been going for years
[1:22:50] see
[1:22:51] the spirit doesn't die it's a it's a
[1:22:53] continual spirit that we have to
[1:22:55] continue
[1:22:55] to fight amen let's see we like i said
[1:22:58] we've got these doctrines
[1:22:59] uh they start with truth the basis
[1:23:03] is built upon truth but they go on and
[1:23:05] they're pushed overboard
[1:23:07] with that truth so much that all they
[1:23:09] see is that one part of the doctrine
[1:23:11] putting a period on what they believe
[1:23:13] and they say it's us born no more
[1:23:15] and they leave off the rest of the
[1:23:16] blessings of god amen they can't go in
[1:23:19] any further
[1:23:20] they stop it right there because of that
[1:23:22] one doctrine
[1:23:23] that one little thing that they keep as
[1:23:25] pets
[1:23:27] and if you'd preached under his hair
[1:23:28] well you didn't have church if you don't
[1:23:30] preach peruser here well you didn't have
[1:23:33] well what about the rest of the bible
[1:23:37] you're right it's truth but go on to
[1:23:41] perfection
[1:23:42] it's growing it's going on to profession
[1:23:45] which is maturity
[1:23:46] you don't stop at the age of 13 at the
[1:23:48] start of puberty no you go on
[1:23:50] to become a man you go on to become a
[1:23:53] woman
[1:23:54] a full mature being amen
[1:23:58] you don't stop right here well look at
[1:24:01] well
[1:24:02] i'm going to embarrass myself well look
[1:24:04] at that i'm starting to become a man
[1:24:05] i've got a hair there i started puberty
[1:24:07] well i'm going to stop right there
[1:24:09] i'm a man now no you've got some growing
[1:24:12] and learning to do to become a man
[1:24:13] trust me amen
[1:24:18] amen praise the lord
[1:24:31] but the rejected king
[1:24:35] now notice when temptation came with
[1:24:37] joseph
[1:24:38] in the house of potiphar right
[1:24:41] he was in the privacy of the room it was
[1:24:44] just him
[1:24:45] and potter for his wife now they
[1:24:47] probably could have done whatever she
[1:24:49] wanted to do and
[1:24:50] nobody probably would have ever found
[1:24:51] out
[1:24:54] but he didn't just sit try to convince
[1:24:56] her the one time or the you know just
[1:24:58] one time oh okay you know i tried to
[1:25:01] convince you but
[1:25:01] you know i'll give him this one time
[1:25:03] nope what did he do
[1:25:05] it went to it's so far detailed that he
[1:25:07] said he ran
[1:25:08] and he ran so fast that she tried to get
[1:25:10] a hold of him that she got a hold of his
[1:25:12] coat right
[1:25:12] and that's what she used against him but
[1:25:15] when that temptation comes
[1:25:17] it's not the temptation that sin it's
[1:25:18] when you give in to the temptation
[1:25:20] that becomes sin you're stepping over
[1:25:22] the word of god to believe the devil's
[1:25:24] lie
[1:25:24] because you're blinded in one eye
[1:25:27] that spiritual eye has been plucked yes
[1:25:30] sir
[1:25:32] that you don't know where you're going
[1:25:34] [Laughter]
[1:25:36] amen you don't know
[1:25:39] you're not paying attention to the right
[1:25:41] path you know the
[1:25:42] there's a straight and narrow path that
[1:25:45] we not need to follow
[1:25:46] and for broad is the way to that leads
[1:25:49] to destruction when you go to the right
[1:25:51] or when you go to the left when you say
[1:25:53] well i don't need to follow
[1:25:54] and i can just step over this guard at
[1:25:56] this line right here
[1:25:57] and i'll be okay like brother brandon
[1:25:59] said we ought not to push the limits
[1:26:02] just to see how far we can go we just
[1:26:04] need to stay as far
[1:26:05] away from it as possible so the the
[1:26:08] further side from the right and the
[1:26:10] further side from the left is right
[1:26:12] in the center amen right in the middle
[1:26:15] of the road
[1:26:17] is all right so as long as we stay
[1:26:20] center we stay focused on god we don't
[1:26:22] reject him we don't refuse him when he
[1:26:23] comes in and says
[1:26:24] do such and such for so-and-so what
[1:26:27] don't you know what he done did to me
[1:26:28] last week
[1:26:29] i got an art against that brother well
[1:26:30] if you got that art in there
[1:26:32] you ought to take care of that amen
[1:26:36] and take care of that art and get it out
[1:26:38] of there it ought not to be there
[1:26:41] amen amen but joseph was of the
[1:26:45] supernatural
[1:26:46] right that right and he was rejected by
[1:26:48] his brothers because he was of the
[1:26:49] supernatural
[1:26:50] the natural cannot deal with the
[1:26:52] supernatural
[1:26:54] right it's jealousy just as we saw with
[1:26:57] cain and abel we see the jealousy there
[1:27:00] the same thing we see it's the same
[1:27:02] kindred spirit
[1:27:03] that that with joseph his brothers they
[1:27:05] could not handle him because he was a
[1:27:07] dreamer
[1:27:08] they didn't like the dreams that he was
[1:27:09] having not knowing that it was actually
[1:27:11] going to come to pass and they were
[1:27:12] going to have to get humbled
[1:27:15] that it was going to come to pass amen
[1:27:18] that all they know is they wanted to get
[1:27:20] rid of joseph
[1:27:21] they rejected him as a brother and they
[1:27:23] sold him into slavery
[1:27:25] it was better than killing him but he
[1:27:27] was in god's hands
[1:27:28] because god saw further down the road
[1:27:31] than what man can see amen
[1:27:33] so just because you're going through a
[1:27:34] little bit of troubles don't worry
[1:27:36] god might have something for you later
[1:27:38] down the road amen it's just a little
[1:27:40] while
[1:27:41] hold on a little bit longer joy comes in
[1:27:43] the morning is that right
[1:27:45] it might get dark and bleak right now
[1:27:47] but morning cometh amen
[1:27:48] and i'm looking forward to that morning
[1:27:50] time morning's coming don't you worry
[1:27:53] amen praise god
[1:27:57] the natural mind doesn't understand the
[1:27:59] spiritual the carnal mind is enmity
[1:28:02] against god is that right that's what
[1:28:03] we're taught in the scripture
[1:28:06] but it's so hard for for so much of us
[1:28:08] that we look through the carnal mind
[1:28:10] that we can't see the spiritual things
[1:28:11] happening
[1:28:12] so then it becomes with the with the
[1:28:14] right eye that we can't see the
[1:28:15] spiritual things
[1:28:16] that we don't believe that god is with
[1:28:18] us anymore because we don't see the
[1:28:20] miracles
[1:28:20] well what's your spiritual life like
[1:28:22] amen you've gone off to the right you've
[1:28:24] gone off to the left what is it
[1:28:25] whichever way it is
[1:28:27] but you fell off from the center you've
[1:28:30] taken your eye off
[1:28:32] first corinthians 3 and chapter 3 and
[1:28:35] verse 3 it says
[1:28:36] for you are ye are yet carnal for
[1:28:39] whereas there is among you
[1:28:41] envying in strife and divisions are ye
[1:28:43] not carnal
[1:28:44] and walk as men for while once said i am
[1:28:47] of paul
[1:28:47] and another i am of apollos are you not
[1:28:50] carnal because
[1:28:51] you're saying oh i'm of jesse smith i'm
[1:28:54] of jim schumacher i'm a cam smith
[1:28:56] i'm a donny reagan i'm i'm of jason
[1:28:58] watkins it's not the man
[1:29:00] that it that blesses your soul amen it's
[1:29:03] the word of god that comes forth that
[1:29:05] sets you free
[1:29:09] so we've got to get out of that
[1:29:10] carnology and get into the spirituality
[1:29:12] and get our mind focused on christ
[1:29:15] amen who then is paul who then is jesse
[1:29:19] who then is brian
[1:29:20] we are nothing and you ask us and we're
[1:29:22] gonna tell you that
[1:29:23] because like i said at the beginning i
[1:29:25] don't even think i should be i don't
[1:29:26] even think i'm worthy to be here
[1:29:27] but for some reason god still put
[1:29:29] something in my heart a minute the
[1:29:31] pastors keep calling me
[1:29:33] to come administer for them amen i don't
[1:29:36] know what i'm doing i'm just being
[1:29:37] honest with you
[1:29:40] but who then is paul and who is apollos
[1:29:43] you ever think that these men felt the
[1:29:45] same way that we do brother
[1:29:47] that i am so insufficient i don't even
[1:29:49] know but i just feel something in my
[1:29:50] heart i don't know what you have need of
[1:29:52] but something in my heart i had no idea
[1:29:54] what i was going to preach usually i get
[1:29:55] ready
[1:29:56] and you know i have thoughts and i'll
[1:29:57] get something but this came yesterday
[1:29:58] and
[1:29:59] i was praying and lord i don't know what
[1:30:01] to preach
[1:30:02] and then yeah i think it was yesterday i
[1:30:04] was trying to get to studying monday
[1:30:06] that or excuse me friday night and
[1:30:07] distraction came after distraction i'm
[1:30:09] trying to so i'm trying to go through
[1:30:11] things i'm reading things and then i
[1:30:13] i think it was yesterday morning well
[1:30:15] okay
[1:30:16] i just felt the leading so i pray this
[1:30:18] blesses you i pray this is something
[1:30:20] that you need
[1:30:20] because i have no idea
[1:30:24] and i love it like that i don't even
[1:30:27] tell my family what i preach
[1:30:28] i don't let the song leader at home i
[1:30:30] don't i don't let brother jim know what
[1:30:32] i'm preaching
[1:30:32] but when it comes forth that somebody
[1:30:34] sings a song that's directly related to
[1:30:36] the message
[1:30:37] and you get done preaching and somebody
[1:30:39] says i absolutely needed that
[1:30:41] uh we were just talking about this
[1:30:42] yesterday it's the holy spirit that i
[1:30:44] want to get addicted to
[1:30:46] that i want i i want the holy spirit to
[1:30:48] lead me amen
[1:30:49] i don't know what your problems are i
[1:30:51] don't know what you're thinking about
[1:30:52] i don't know what your discussions are
[1:30:54] behind the door oh my you just go back
[1:30:56] to the old testament where the prophet
[1:30:58] kept saying
[1:30:58] uh coming forth and telling the king hey
[1:31:00] they're planning on doing this well
[1:31:02] who's in our secret chambers who's the
[1:31:03] spying here
[1:31:04] telling them what they're doing it was
[1:31:06] the holy ghost amen so i pray that the
[1:31:08] holy ghost is moving this morning
[1:31:10] speaking to your heart amen because i
[1:31:11] have no idea
[1:31:13] so who then is paul and who is apollos
[1:31:15] but ministers by whom ye believed
[1:31:17] even as the lord gave to every man i
[1:31:20] have planted
[1:31:21] apollos watered see and it just goes to
[1:31:24] show that we need one another
[1:31:25] one ministry needs the other ministry
[1:31:27] meets the other ministry
[1:31:28] to make the whole ministry amen but god
[1:31:32] gave the increase what
[1:31:36] you mean paul and apollos and jesse and
[1:31:38] cam and all these different brothers
[1:31:39] that
[1:31:40] matt leitner and the different ones it
[1:31:41] wasn't them that gave the increase
[1:31:43] no we're just vessels in god's hand to
[1:31:45] be used amen
[1:31:47] we are his mouthpiece and the same thing
[1:31:49] for you it's not limited to just
[1:31:50] ministers
[1:31:51] it also goes to you amen
[1:31:56] but god gives an increase you yield to
[1:31:58] him your gifts amen
[1:32:00] he will increase it amen so then neither
[1:32:03] is he that planteth anything
[1:32:05] neither he that watereth but god that
[1:32:07] giveth the increase
[1:32:08] now he that planteth and he that
[1:32:10] watereth are one
[1:32:13] they move as one we have to be in the
[1:32:15] right in the same mind one mind one
[1:32:17] accord
[1:32:18] preaching the same thing not different
[1:32:20] things
[1:32:22] not the not the desires of our heart of
[1:32:24] what we want to preach bringing out our
[1:32:26] pet doctrines or whatever
[1:32:27] but it's as of a whole to bless the
[1:32:29] whole body of christ
[1:32:31] it works together as one
[1:32:35] and every man shall receive his own
[1:32:37] reward according to his own labor
[1:32:39] yes the different ministers are going to
[1:32:40] receive their own reward for whatever
[1:32:42] you know there's time that has to be put
[1:32:44] into to studying
[1:32:46] time to be uh to be praying and
[1:32:49] not talking to to uh the whole
[1:32:52] congregation hey what's growing and
[1:32:53] so-and-so i'm going through right now
[1:32:54] hey what's sister sue
[1:32:55] going through right now oh did you hear
[1:32:57] about this did you hear about that
[1:32:58] no it's getting in prayer
[1:33:04] and that's a start but entrusting
[1:33:07] and believing that god is going to take
[1:33:09] that situation under control amen
[1:33:13] and every man shall receive his own
[1:33:15] reward
[1:33:16] according to his own labor
[1:33:21] see it's not the man but the spirit in
[1:33:25] the man
[1:33:26] sometimes it's hard for people to to
[1:33:28] distinguish the difference between the
[1:33:30] two
[1:33:30] because they love to hear the man preach
[1:33:32] so much and uh oh man they bring this
[1:33:34] this much so uh i love the way they
[1:33:36] preach it i love the way brother jesse
[1:33:38] preaches
[1:33:38] i love his teaching i love the way our
[1:33:40] pastor preaches
[1:33:42] i love the way that uh brother wayne
[1:33:43] lost the preachers my goodness that
[1:33:45] that man is a machine gun preacher he
[1:33:48] says
[1:33:50] pow and it's done you know i don't know
[1:33:52] where he gets the energy
[1:33:53] oh my goodness i'd be so out of breath
[1:33:54] i'd probably pass out on the floor with
[1:33:56] that brother the way that brother
[1:33:57] preaches
[1:33:58] but oh my but see everyone you take a
[1:34:01] little bit here and there here a little
[1:34:02] there little precept upon precept line
[1:34:04] upon line
[1:34:05] it all works together for the good of
[1:34:07] one amen
[1:34:12] now who do you think you are
[1:34:13] [Laughter]
[1:34:16] amen praise god i lost my place where
[1:34:19] was i
[1:34:22] all right give me a second
[1:34:27] i'm 46 now and i don't exercise that's a
[1:34:30] terrible thing isn't it
[1:34:36] along with that weight i've kind of
[1:34:37] gained a little bit a little bit of
[1:34:39] girth
[1:34:40] i was teasing my wife so you're doing
[1:34:44] the laundry wrong something
[1:34:45] i don't know what you're doing right
[1:34:46] because my pants don't fit i think it
[1:34:48] was something with
[1:34:49] i knew she wasn't going to shrink
[1:34:50] leather that much but my belt it wasn't
[1:34:52] fitting right either
[1:34:54] so i knew it'd have to be me
[1:34:58] but i just thank god i just thank him
[1:35:01] amen because that means me gaining
[1:35:04] weight that means i'm doing well
[1:35:07] by god's grace
[1:35:12] but getting back under the carnality our
[1:35:15] carnality is what gets in the way is
[1:35:17] that right because
[1:35:20] it's a human element that gets in the
[1:35:23] way
[1:35:24] that when we have disagreement that we
[1:35:25] separate from each other is that right
[1:35:27] because our pet doctrines we don't see
[1:35:29] eye to eye on certain things
[1:35:31] but but brother branham says that out of
[1:35:34] the rejected king he says this
[1:35:37] he says but they didn't want it that way
[1:35:40] they wanted a king
[1:35:42] they wanted to be like the rest of the
[1:35:43] world and when the pentecostal church
[1:35:47] the holy spirit first fell about 50
[1:35:49] something years ago if they would have
[1:35:51] just let it alone and let
[1:35:52] god add to the church see god give it
[1:35:56] the increase
[1:35:57] but when man tries to do something they
[1:35:59] just muddle everything up
[1:36:00] so if they just left it alone and let
[1:36:02] god give the increase
[1:36:04] that and let god enter the church daily
[1:36:06] such as would be
[1:36:07] saved just like it was in the day and
[1:36:10] day in the first pentecost
[1:36:11] it would have been like it was in the
[1:36:13] apostolic age but we
[1:36:15] had to draw fences oh my god
[1:36:18] excuse me he says we had to be like the
[1:36:21] rest of them we had to if a methodist
[1:36:23] was a denomination then we
[1:36:24] we must be one too and here comes
[1:36:26] somebody alone said jesus is coming on a
[1:36:28] white cloud
[1:36:30] and no no he's coming on a white horse
[1:36:32] all right
[1:36:33] we'll just separate i'll get me a group
[1:36:35] and you get your group over here
[1:36:37] there you are you just drove drew the
[1:36:39] line somewhere and you separated
[1:36:41] yourselves
[1:36:41] over your carnality over one pet
[1:36:44] doctrine
[1:36:44] that just kept you from the rest of the
[1:36:46] blessings of god amen
[1:36:48] what difference does it make if he's
[1:36:50] he's coming anyhow and i
[1:36:52] love this thought that he has right here
[1:36:53] he's coming anyhow
[1:36:56] and it don't matter how he's coming the
[1:36:58] thing is is are you ready to go with him
[1:37:00] when he comes that's the main thing it
[1:37:03] doesn't matter how he comes
[1:37:05] what form he comes in let's just be
[1:37:07] ready to go amen
[1:37:10] but they'll split hairs on on any little
[1:37:12] bitty thing
[1:37:13] and form another organization and that's
[1:37:16] just the way the world
[1:37:18] did it and the rejected king they
[1:37:20] rejected him
[1:37:21] over a pet doctrine over carnality
[1:37:25] amen and that's what we think what we've
[1:37:27] got today
[1:37:28] is people rejecting the king persecution
[1:37:31] is happening again over in foreign
[1:37:34] pastors and and parishioners are like
[1:37:36] are being put to death
[1:37:37] and in prison is that right you see this
[1:37:39] happening more and more
[1:37:40] i had to hear a story almost every
[1:37:42] single day about over in a foreign
[1:37:44] country somewhere
[1:37:45] that there's a pastor here that's been
[1:37:48] been slayed
[1:37:48] oh they cut they they beheaded him or
[1:37:50] whatever it was or they put him in
[1:37:52] prison
[1:37:52] and when they put him in prison they
[1:37:54] don't treat him very well
[1:37:57] but i'm seeing the persecution happen
[1:37:59] more and more over there
[1:38:00] so here i'm i don't know if this is a
[1:38:02] squeeze or not but it's
[1:38:04] it's even coming onto our own soil amen
[1:38:06] i see it in our own country
[1:38:08] and it upsets me to where i know it's
[1:38:10] supposed to happen they're picking our
[1:38:11] constitution apart
[1:38:13] you know they got a group out there
[1:38:14] called the freedom from religion
[1:38:17] well i hate to type well i'd love to
[1:38:19] tell you this we gotta we got something
[1:38:21] in our constitution that says
[1:38:23] freedom of religion not freedom from
[1:38:26] religion
[1:38:27] that's a whole that's a wonderful thing
[1:38:28] about freedom is if you have a choice or
[1:38:31] you have that choice to say
[1:38:32] oh i want that or no i don't want that
[1:38:35] that's a wonderful thing about freedom
[1:38:36] isn't it
[1:38:37] well guess what they're starting to
[1:38:39] trample on that constitution they're
[1:38:40] starting to start
[1:38:41] picking it apart do i like it
[1:38:45] nope i don't like it at all but i know
[1:38:47] it's supposed to happen
[1:38:48] i know it's supposed to come but that
[1:38:50] doesn't mean i stopped signing crying
[1:38:52] over
[1:38:53] over the abominations of the world amen
[1:38:57] i know it's coming and about enrages me
[1:38:59] when i see it happen
[1:39:05] now see it's just the time that we're
[1:39:09] living in
[1:39:10] it's supposed to happen right it's the
[1:39:12] time
[1:39:16] lunacy reigns among us
[1:39:19] this is eight brother branham told us
[1:39:21] how many years ago
[1:39:22] that it was going to be it was a
[1:39:24] psychotic age we know
[1:39:26] these people are losing their minds you
[1:39:28] look at what they want to do what
[1:39:31] what crazy person was allowed to do that
[1:39:34] who passed that you know it's crazy
[1:39:37] they're thinking
[1:39:38] of what they're doing yes sir
[1:39:46] but then i remember this one little
[1:39:47] thought
[1:39:49] how brother branham said that yo honey
[1:39:53] that's just the way it is in this
[1:39:56] country
[1:39:57] they're they're americans yes we're
[1:39:59] american by birth in this country
[1:40:01] but we have another land we're from
[1:40:04] another world
[1:40:05] amen i get to thinking this world is not
[1:40:08] my home
[1:40:09] [Laughter]
[1:40:11] i have a home and a land whose builder
[1:40:13] and maker is god amen
[1:40:15] it was not made by natural hands
[1:40:22] but with the carnality of man give me
[1:40:25] another thing
[1:40:31] i have a treadmill that broke that's on
[1:40:32] the back of my trailer so
[1:40:34] donations welcome just just kidding
[1:40:37] i'm just kidding
[1:40:40] i need to get outside more well praise
[1:40:43] god
[1:40:44] the carnality of how people look at man
[1:40:47] you know moses
[1:40:49] was a portion of god and it's funny how
[1:40:52] that works because
[1:40:54] they didn't look as as as moses uh
[1:40:57] as god you know they they kind of
[1:40:59] rejected moses
[1:41:01] but there was a time on uh when he when
[1:41:03] he came down after
[1:41:04] the the the the ten commandments where
[1:41:07] he was bailed
[1:41:08] and they said let moses talk to us and
[1:41:10] not god now see moses had a portion
[1:41:12] of being god and he said that aaron
[1:41:15] shall be your mouthpiece is that right
[1:41:17] aaron should be your prophet and he said
[1:41:18] moses you shall be as god you shall be
[1:41:20] god so when you speak it's just like me
[1:41:23] speaking amen
[1:41:24] so but they wanted moses to speak to
[1:41:27] them because they knew that
[1:41:29] it was more merciful for moses to speak
[1:41:31] to them because there was judgment
[1:41:33] in god's mouth ready to judge the people
[1:41:35] is that right so
[1:41:36] when he came down he had that veil on
[1:41:38] his face that there was so much
[1:41:40] there was something about him that they
[1:41:41] couldn't even look upon his face that
[1:41:43] they had to put a veil on his face
[1:41:44] now as as i was saying that moses was a
[1:41:48] portion of god
[1:41:49] he was he was accepted when everything
[1:41:51] was all convenient and everything was
[1:41:53] uh going nice and smooth he was accepted
[1:41:55] but as soon as
[1:41:56] as soon as they saw the egyptians coming
[1:41:59] this soldier's coming
[1:42:00] moses what did you do to us
[1:42:06] there was a little bit of hardship
[1:42:07] coming their way and they could accept
[1:42:09] moses as long as everything was on a
[1:42:11] flowery bed of ease
[1:42:12] but hold on you're going to go through a
[1:42:14] time of famine
[1:42:15] you're going to go through a time of of
[1:42:18] abundance
[1:42:19] so just hold on stay with your pastor
[1:42:21] you might go through some hard times but
[1:42:22] stay with it
[1:42:23] put it in prayer amen
[1:42:27] you're gonna go through some hard times
[1:42:28] as a christian yeah
[1:42:31] but hold on it's just for a little while
[1:42:39] don't come to church just because you
[1:42:41] see the blessings of god raining down
[1:42:43] and then when you see a dry spell not
[1:42:45] come to church you come to church anyhow
[1:42:48] because you love
[1:42:49] god amen
[1:42:52] that's what was so hard at brother
[1:42:53] branham's age is that they wanted they
[1:42:55] were flocking just to see the miracles
[1:42:57] happen
[1:42:58] but when it came time for the word to
[1:43:00] come forth
[1:43:01] it started dropping off
[1:43:04] you know when the seriousness comes it's
[1:43:07] going to show
[1:43:11] i've said this for a while have
[1:43:14] communion night
[1:43:16] see who shows up it's going to be a
[1:43:18] minimal show
[1:43:19] unless you have a lot of people that
[1:43:21] really have a desire
[1:43:22] to get closer to god but when it comes
[1:43:26] time for a vote brother i'm telling you
[1:43:28] the place is packed out
[1:43:30] because they want to have a say in it
[1:43:34] it's true i've seen it wow
[1:43:38] soon as soon as communion time comes
[1:43:41] it's scarce
[1:43:42] you hardly have anybody's show
[1:43:48] guess we ought to be careful what kind
[1:43:50] of spirit we have huh
[1:43:52] you can only hide it for so long it's
[1:43:54] going to show forth
[1:43:57] and like i said as soon as the vote
[1:43:58] comes place is packed out because
[1:44:01] oh you're not going to have a say it
[1:44:02] here without my vote
[1:44:04] it's that carnality oh my yep that's a
[1:44:08] hard thing to say
[1:44:09] it's a hard thing for me to say but it's
[1:44:11] true yes sir
[1:44:13] yes sir
[1:44:16] oh my if some people saw that saw me say
[1:44:19] that
[1:44:20] statement online i don't know we
[1:44:22] probably won't be friends
[1:44:24] but that's okay i'll stand by what i
[1:44:26] said
[1:44:27] amen yo and i
[1:44:30] don't take away from those that if
[1:44:32] they're not right and they're still
[1:44:34] working things in their life sometimes
[1:44:36] people just don't show
[1:44:37] but you'll see the habitual ones that
[1:44:39] they make it a point that they don't
[1:44:40] show
[1:44:41] let me separate that right now because
[1:44:43] some people might be going things
[1:44:44] going through things and uh just because
[1:44:46] they show don't show up one night in
[1:44:48] community oh we know what that
[1:44:49] spirit that brothers of well he might be
[1:44:51] working some things out or sister you
[1:44:53] know
[1:44:53] he or she might be working some things
[1:44:55] out and it's better for him to stay home
[1:44:57] than it is to come
[1:44:58] and partake unworthily right because
[1:45:00] your heart has to be right before you
[1:45:01] partake
[1:45:02] of communion service so don't take one
[1:45:05] circumstance or
[1:45:06] if somebody doesn't show up you know
[1:45:09] you've got to pray for them
[1:45:10] you've got to a a a terry one for
[1:45:14] another is that right you've got to pray
[1:45:16] one for another they might be going
[1:45:18] through something that's where you
[1:45:19] oh lord help help them to come to
[1:45:21] communion i want to see them here
[1:45:23] my desire is to see them here help them
[1:45:25] make right whatever is there
[1:45:27] amen we all go through some dry times we
[1:45:30] all do
[1:45:31] right we all do yes sir i don't even
[1:45:34] know what time it is
[1:45:37] i thought this was going to be short
[1:45:47] david was another type of of christ is
[1:45:49] that right yeah
[1:45:52] through kingship
[1:45:58] david was another one that was was
[1:46:00] rejected
[1:46:01] yeah there was one time that
[1:46:05] a man you know uh not exactly like me
[1:46:08] but i
[1:46:09] i don't like to see where my
[1:46:10] government's going i don't like to see
[1:46:12] where the leader's going so this man he
[1:46:14] didn't like how how the government was
[1:46:16] going he didn't like how david was
[1:46:17] leading things
[1:46:18] and he made it known and he spat on king
[1:46:20] david is that right
[1:46:22] so there was a guard there and said how
[1:46:23] dare that man come and spit on my king
[1:46:27] he wanted to take the head off of him is
[1:46:28] that right
[1:46:30] to defend his king that's how much he
[1:46:32] felt uh to defend his king
[1:46:35] but david said no no no don't do that
[1:46:39] he said god told him to do that oh my
[1:46:42] god
[1:46:44] but that was a show of rejection that
[1:46:46] was a show of exactly what was going to
[1:46:47] happen to christ
[1:46:48] through his walk to calvary they spat on
[1:46:51] him they pulled his beard
[1:46:52] they did all kinds of stuff they
[1:46:54] rejected that king on that day
[1:47:00] and you know david even in his own
[1:47:02] household
[1:47:04] and it still types christ even in his
[1:47:07] own household
[1:47:09] he was rejected absalom wanted to take
[1:47:12] the kingdom
[1:47:13] the kingship from from david is that
[1:47:15] right so we know that
[1:47:17] even with jesus well i think it's in
[1:47:19] zechariah
[1:47:21] 18 or something like that where it says
[1:47:23] uh
[1:47:26] that through the suffering uh where did
[1:47:29] you get this
[1:47:30] and it was typed as jesus as jesus being
[1:47:32] rejected in his own house
[1:47:33] suffering wounds from the house of his
[1:47:35] friends amen i think it's in zechariah
[1:47:38] and uh where did you get those wounds
[1:47:41] how did you get like this it was in the
[1:47:44] house
[1:47:44] of my friends you know if you were
[1:47:49] friends with the world you're an enemy
[1:47:52] of god
[1:47:54] but jesus said i no longer call you
[1:47:56] servants but i call you
[1:47:58] friends so let's not give the wounds in
[1:48:01] his hands
[1:48:02] but in the house of his friends amen
[1:48:06] i think of those times and you know i
[1:48:07] was thinking of this
[1:48:09] a topic anyway of a message you know or
[1:48:12] just a thought
[1:48:13] is it worth another blow because you
[1:48:16] know
[1:48:16] and this is off my notes but you know i
[1:48:18] i think it was when brother brandon was
[1:48:20] he was in that casino or whatever and he
[1:48:21] saw that that uh law enforcement officer
[1:48:24] with that woman
[1:48:25] and they were just cutting up and
[1:48:26] carrying on and he was saying how lord
[1:48:28] can you put up with this stank of sin
[1:48:30] and uh and then he went into the into
[1:48:33] the room off to himself and the lord
[1:48:34] showed him in a vision
[1:48:35] of what he does of the sin that that
[1:48:38] brother branham did
[1:48:40] and he said what happens is your sin
[1:48:41] just goes and it's like a bumper and
[1:48:42] it's just
[1:48:43] and it's just another blow another blow
[1:48:45] and i just can't help think of
[1:48:47] uh uh when we do our faults and our
[1:48:49] failures and
[1:48:50] and then i just picture christ on the
[1:48:52] cross whenever we sin
[1:48:53] it's just another blow upon christ it
[1:48:55] says that's another slap on him
[1:48:57] on his face and or his walk to calvary
[1:48:59] however you want to
[1:49:00] picture it it's just another blow on
[1:49:03] christ the one that died for us
[1:49:05] it's just another blow onto the one that
[1:49:07] saved us it's just another blow
[1:49:09] under the one that redeemed us amen how
[1:49:11] rich and mercy he must be to continually
[1:49:15] forgive us every single day of our lives
[1:49:17] and every minute how much
[1:49:18] how many mistakes do you make but we
[1:49:20] continue on we pick up to carry on the
[1:49:23] fight
[1:49:24] amen but it's something that we can
[1:49:28] think about
[1:49:29] oh if i do this what's it going to do to
[1:49:31] him
[1:49:34] is this going to be something worthy is
[1:49:36] this going to be something that's going
[1:49:38] to be edifying to my brother or my
[1:49:40] sister is it going to be another blow
[1:49:42] on christ that saved me is it going to
[1:49:44] be another blow on that bumper
[1:49:47] oh my goodness oh praise god
[1:49:54] jews would always turn to other gods is
[1:49:56] that right to idols they would always do
[1:49:59] that
[1:50:00] and it was always in the time that that
[1:50:02] things are going good
[1:50:04] and they got bored of of of of going to
[1:50:07] worship or whatever going to
[1:50:08] the temple of god or worship whatever it
[1:50:10] might have been but it seemed like they
[1:50:12] always turned to an
[1:50:13] idol and then they got rebuked for it
[1:50:16] and then they were forgiven for it and
[1:50:18] then they were put right back on track
[1:50:19] and it's just like us we make mistakes
[1:50:24] don't follow after idols
[1:50:28] just because things are quiet doesn't
[1:50:29] mean that god cease to exist
[1:50:34] in the old testament they set things
[1:50:35] aside because they were supposed to
[1:50:37] teach their children is that right
[1:50:39] they were supposed to tell them the
[1:50:40] tales of what happened in their day
[1:50:42] this is what the lord has done for us
[1:50:44] for us this is how he delivered us
[1:50:46] and we have all these things to teach
[1:50:48] the children
[1:50:50] but when the time came for the children
[1:50:52] to grow up they didn't understand those
[1:50:54] stories those they
[1:50:55] no they heard of it oh that was just
[1:50:57] fables that are told that our parents
[1:50:58] told us
[1:50:59] uh so that we would obey them or
[1:51:01] whatever it might be
[1:51:04] but it's because they didn't have the
[1:51:06] experience
[1:51:07] they couldn't go off or their parents
[1:51:09] experience they had to find out from
[1:51:11] their own experience amen
[1:51:12] amen and god's existence
[1:51:16] isn't contingent on what we say or not
[1:51:19] god exists
[1:51:20] no matter what we say amen
[1:51:28] i've got our clubs here i'm gonna come
[1:51:34] too close
[1:51:40] give me a second
[1:51:51] you know just because god doesn't answer
[1:51:54] your prayer
[1:51:55] the way you wanted him to answer that
[1:51:57] prayer doesn't mean he didn't hear you
[1:52:02] his ways are above our ways is that
[1:52:03] right
[1:52:05] it doesn't mean that we have to have a
[1:52:07] temper tantrum and throw a fit
[1:52:11] because that shows what kind of spirit
[1:52:12] we we have on
[1:52:14] us it shows that we really don't have
[1:52:17] the faith in god
[1:52:18] you know like i said he his ways are
[1:52:21] above our ways he sees something in the
[1:52:23] future
[1:52:24] that he has planned for us so it just
[1:52:26] might not be time yet
[1:52:29] everything comes in its own time there's
[1:52:32] a time to reap and there's a time to sow
[1:52:34] there's a time to gather stones there's
[1:52:36] a time to cast away stones is that right
[1:52:38] so it's all in god's timing amen
[1:52:41] brother bran says this he says and when
[1:52:44] you die
[1:52:45] remember it doesn't change your spirit
[1:52:47] it only changes your dwelling place
[1:52:50] and whatever type of spirit you've got
[1:52:52] in you that's the place it will go to
[1:52:54] and sin could never enter heaven is that
[1:52:57] right
[1:53:00] he says well you say well i confess mine
[1:53:04] every night
[1:53:04] we got a prayer book and when we go to
[1:53:07] church we confess all of our sins
[1:53:09] and turn right back around and do them
[1:53:12] again
[1:53:13] turn right back the next day god forgive
[1:53:16] me for drinking
[1:53:17] forgive me for committing adultery
[1:53:19] forgive me for lying
[1:53:20] forgive me for stealing and turn right
[1:53:22] back and do the same thing
[1:53:24] forgive me for getting drunk last week i
[1:53:26] didn't mean to drink that much
[1:53:28] turn right back and drink it again see
[1:53:31] that's what i call
[1:53:32] a a bull and goat repentance amen that
[1:53:34] was old-time repentance
[1:53:36] where they could and they could go bring
[1:53:38] their offering they'd be forgiven of
[1:53:39] what they
[1:53:40] did and then the next day they'd be
[1:53:41] right back to what they were doing amen
[1:53:43] it wasn't the remission of sins where
[1:53:46] christ came when he came
[1:53:47] when he was sacrificed it was for the
[1:53:49] remission
[1:53:50] of our sins that took away the very
[1:53:52] desire
[1:53:53] of our sins so when you come with
[1:53:55] repentance don't let it be if a bull and
[1:53:57] goat repentance but let it be a full
[1:54:00] christ like repentance amen amen
[1:54:06] let it be that born-again repentance
[1:54:08] that born-again experience amen
[1:54:14] he says when you want to live worldly
[1:54:16] all week then come to church
[1:54:18] and act all righteous you reject the
[1:54:20] king he is a lord over your life it's
[1:54:22] just
[1:54:23] a constant rejection that shows that
[1:54:25] something hasn't changed inside
[1:54:27] you're trying to paint the outside kind
[1:54:30] of whitewash it
[1:54:31] but it what needs to be done is the
[1:54:33] blood of christ
[1:54:34] and washed white instead of white washed
[1:54:37] that's what the world needs today amen
[1:54:39] see he's to reject the king and let him
[1:54:42] not be rejected in our own lives so we
[1:54:44] have to be careful
[1:54:45] amen so in closing
[1:54:50] i think see
[1:54:55] see as he was saying see people want him
[1:54:57] as as their savior but they don't want
[1:54:59] him as their lord
[1:55:00] they don't want him ruling over their
[1:55:02] love their lives when he comes
[1:55:04] in uh he'll govern you and control you
[1:55:07] and a lot of people don't want that
[1:55:09] they just want to go on their merry way
[1:55:11] with anyone
[1:55:12] or without anyone meddling in their own
[1:55:14] lives now see not everyone can see
[1:55:17] him is that right so only people
[1:55:21] only some people would accept jesus
[1:55:23] ministry while others rejected him
[1:55:25] even while they were supposedly looking
[1:55:27] for the same thing now brother bran says
[1:55:30] he says but in the old testament in
[1:55:31] genesis 1 in the beginning god
[1:55:34] the word is used elohim elohim means the
[1:55:37] self-existing one right
[1:55:39] we know that you're taught that right so
[1:55:41] what a difference a word elohim is so
[1:55:43] our word
[1:55:44] god elohim means a self-existing one
[1:55:47] we cannot be self-existing we cannot
[1:55:50] be almighty we cannot be omnipotent we
[1:55:53] cannot be omnipresent
[1:55:54] we cannot be on audition the that elohim
[1:55:58] expresses all of that we cannot be that
[1:56:01] all right the tree that you make got
[1:56:05] a god out of or the building it's not
[1:56:07] self-existing
[1:56:09] so god in the beginning was life the
[1:56:11] eternal one
[1:56:12] in him was attributes and those
[1:56:14] attributes became words
[1:56:15] and the word became flesh jesus was the
[1:56:18] redeemer
[1:56:19] and to redeem means to bring back amen
[1:56:22] if he has to bring it back
[1:56:24] it had to be somewhere to be brought
[1:56:27] back amen
[1:56:31] so you see all people will never be able
[1:56:33] to say it
[1:56:35] because ah people wasn't
[1:56:39] in the beginning in god's thoughts
[1:56:43] look at the priest when they saw him
[1:56:46] express himself exactly with the word
[1:56:48] he was he they called him videos above
[1:56:52] that showed where their nature was is
[1:56:54] that right it was in the modern thought
[1:56:56] of that day
[1:56:58] but the little old prostitute that he
[1:57:00] met at the gate
[1:57:01] expressed his messiah messianic sign
[1:57:05] by telling her what she had done but why
[1:57:08] she said sir i perceive perceive that
[1:57:11] you are a prophet
[1:57:12] we know the messiah when he comes he
[1:57:14] will tell us all these things now see
[1:57:17] she recognized him as the messiah
[1:57:20] not as bees above not everybody can see
[1:57:23] the same thing
[1:57:24] it is ordained to life amen the anointed
[1:57:28] one because
[1:57:28] he met the scripture qualifications even
[1:57:31] though the priests and the prostitute
[1:57:33] they were looking for the same
[1:57:34] exact thing the coming of the messiah
[1:57:37] but one recognized this coming
[1:57:39] even when they were supposed to
[1:57:40] recognize it the priest couldn't see it
[1:57:42] even though they were knowledgeable in
[1:57:44] the scripture so it doesn't matter how
[1:57:46] much you know
[1:57:47] it's how much your relationship is with
[1:57:49] him amen
[1:57:52] it's how much you let him in your heart
[1:57:54] it's how much you let him live in your
[1:57:56] life
[1:57:57] amen
[1:58:00] don't you see she said we know that when
[1:58:03] the messiah cometh he will do these
[1:58:05] things
[1:58:06] now god might have had to interbreed
[1:58:08] this and then to get the certain thing
[1:58:10] out of a bell like the molder
[1:58:11] but he but when jesus turned said i am
[1:58:15] he
[1:58:15] that speaks with you he made himself
[1:58:18] known to the prostitute
[1:58:19] because of what she said
[1:58:22] i perceived that thou art a prophet and
[1:58:24] he disclosed of who he was
[1:58:26] amen i am he that speaks with you
[1:58:30] there is no such thing no such
[1:58:31] expression as bl's above
[1:58:33] she didn't call him bl's above but she
[1:58:35] recognized the truth
[1:58:36] there was something inside of her that
[1:58:38] recognized that truth
[1:58:41] now there are some people there little
[1:58:42] doctor says there wasn't anything there
[1:58:45] they didn't you don't have that seed
[1:58:46] down inside of you but i tell you
[1:58:48] there has to be something in there that
[1:58:51] recognizes the truth
[1:58:55] yes we were born and sinned and shaped
[1:58:57] in iniquity and come to the world
[1:58:58] speaking lie
[1:59:00] but there's something inside of you yes
[1:59:01] you forgot there was a spiritual amnesia
[1:59:04] you forgotten from what you where you
[1:59:06] came from the experience that you had
[1:59:07] with god before
[1:59:08] you forgot that but when you recognize
[1:59:12] the truth
[1:59:13] then you were born again your nature
[1:59:15] changed
[1:59:17] but to be redeemed there had to be
[1:59:18] something in here way
[1:59:20] back that had experience with him it was
[1:59:22] in the thoughts of god's mind amen
[1:59:28] amen
[1:59:32] after that she left her water pot ran
[1:59:34] into the city and said
[1:59:35] come see a man who told me the things
[1:59:37] that i have done isn't this the very
[1:59:39] messiah amen
[1:59:40] now what did this putting the old
[1:59:42] scripture with the experience that jesus
[1:59:44] was giving to her
[1:59:45] what did it do it made the messiah now
[1:59:48] see when those came
[1:59:50] that's exactly oh my goodness it made
[1:59:53] him
[1:59:53] the messiah because it came to show for
[1:59:56] it came to pass the manifestation was
[1:59:58] coming to pass amen
[2:00:00] see there was there's a prophecy here
[2:00:03] that has to
[2:00:04] before it becomes an actual prophecy all
[2:00:06] the events have to come up to lead to
[2:00:08] that prophecy
[2:00:09] for it to come to pass then you can call
[2:00:11] it a prophecy
[2:00:14] if not it's just words that are sitting
[2:00:16] there
[2:00:18] it becomes idle until it comes to pass
[2:00:21] amen
[2:00:23] christ couldn't become the redeemer
[2:00:25] until he had to until he came to the
[2:00:26] cross is that right
[2:00:27] he had to go through that to become and
[2:00:30] to be called
[2:00:31] the redeemer
[2:00:38] and did you notice her sins were
[2:00:40] forgiven
[2:00:41] because at the beginning she was
[2:00:43] redeemable
[2:00:45] because she was in god's thinking at the
[2:00:48] beginning
[2:00:49] so it's it's redeemed her or brought her
[2:00:52] back
[2:00:53] when she seen the express scripture
[2:00:55] manifested of jehovah
[2:00:57] of what he was and what he is
[2:01:01] amen stand your feet with me this
[2:01:04] morning
[2:01:05] or this afternoon
[2:01:11] jesus was trading here excuse me jesus
[2:01:13] was rejected
[2:01:14] another time this was before he went to
[2:01:17] the cross is that right
[2:01:18] we know it by barabbas and you you know
[2:01:21] i had a thought when i was reading
[2:01:23] and uh you know sometimes when i get a
[2:01:26] thought
[2:01:27] there's a minister that comes and
[2:01:28] preaches that thought you know
[2:01:30] because i was thinking along those lines
[2:01:32] and then lo and behold brother daryl
[2:01:34] ward comes and preaches barabbas
[2:01:36] and uh and i just think i love how that
[2:01:38] works
[2:01:39] because god's working on on the ends you
[2:01:41] know and
[2:01:42] i just felt that i was right on the same
[2:01:44] line but you know you put yourself in
[2:01:46] barabbas's position
[2:01:47] because that is you that is you
[2:01:51] yeah well what do you mean because i was
[2:01:54] traded
[2:01:55] he took my sins upon him is that right
[2:01:57] and he gave me
[2:01:58] his righteousness amen
[2:02:03] so taking that place reject not
[2:02:06] your king amen hallelujah
[2:02:10] and i want to close with this scripture
[2:02:13] first samuel 12 and verse 20.
[2:02:18] and samuel said unto the people fear not
[2:02:22] you have done all this wickedness see
[2:02:25] you
[2:02:26] you've done wickedness in your life yes
[2:02:28] you've been born again
[2:02:29] and then you still do wickedness
[2:02:31] unfortunately our flesh falls into
[2:02:33] wickedness
[2:02:34] yes sir yes sir but pay attention to
[2:02:37] what he says
[2:02:38] this is after he after he told them that
[2:02:41] yeah
[2:02:41] you wanted a king you're turning your
[2:02:43] back on god
[2:02:44] that you want a natural king
[2:02:48] i'll give you that desire okay you did
[2:02:51] wrong in that
[2:02:52] recognize that you did wrong because
[2:02:54] afterwards oh man we shouldn't have done
[2:02:56] that they recognized
[2:02:57] we shouldn't have done that but what he
[2:03:00] says he says
[2:03:01] yet turn not aside from following
[2:03:05] the lord oh my
[2:03:08] god that's mercy
[2:03:11] that's mercy he says yet turn not aside
[2:03:16] from following the lord but serve
[2:03:19] the lord with all your heart
[2:03:23] all your heart
[2:03:26] and turn ye not aside for then should ye
[2:03:30] go
[2:03:31] following after vain things see as i
[2:03:33] said they were habitual
[2:03:34] in the following after idols and they
[2:03:37] were
[2:03:37] it was over and over and it was the same
[2:03:40] cycle
[2:03:41] they would be up up on the mountain with
[2:03:42] god they'd get down in the valley and
[2:03:44] they'd turn away from god
[2:03:45] and then they'd get back with god and
[2:03:47] his graces and then and it was just a
[2:03:48] rollercoaster
[2:03:51] don't follow after idol saints we're
[2:03:52] taught that even in the new testament
[2:03:54] it's not just an old testament thing but
[2:03:56] it's a new testament thing also
[2:03:57] for we're told follow not after idols
[2:04:01] so this is the same thing coming uh
[2:04:04] what samuel says he says for then should
[2:04:07] you not go after vain things
[2:04:09] which cannot profit nor deliver
[2:04:12] we have one one deliverer is that right
[2:04:15] there's nothing
[2:04:16] else like when when that person comes to
[2:04:18] you for prayer they know that there's
[2:04:20] one deliverer they're they're coming to
[2:04:22] you to preparate to that one
[2:04:24] deliverer
[2:04:27] they know that you can't save who
[2:04:29] they're praying for
[2:04:30] they know that you can't save them
[2:04:34] they recognize that there is a higher
[2:04:36] power but for some reason they cannot
[2:04:38] submit
[2:04:39] to that higher power
[2:04:43] which cannot profit nor deliver for they
[2:04:46] are
[2:04:46] vain for the lord will not forsake
[2:04:50] his people for his great name
[2:04:53] sake did not jesus say that he is not
[2:04:56] and
[2:04:56] no one can pluck one out of my hands
[2:05:00] amen for his name sake amen
[2:05:04] because it hath pleased the lord
[2:05:07] to make you his people
[2:05:11] amen amen
[2:05:18] most grace is heavenly father i just
[2:05:21] thank you
[2:05:23] for your meeting with us here today
[2:05:26] lord god help us as we go for our daily
[2:05:30] walk
[2:05:31] that we would not turn aside to the
[2:05:33] things that look pretty
[2:05:35] in this world and we know that brother
[2:05:37] branham taught that
[2:05:39] even even others that we're told and
[2:05:42] we're cautioned that sin is pretty
[2:05:44] sin is something that that makes a man
[2:05:47] desire to want to go to it
[2:05:49] but lord may the desire of the holy
[2:05:50] spirit be a stronger desire
[2:05:52] that we would cleave unto the holy
