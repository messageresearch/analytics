just come to the fountain you dipped your heart in the street this mercy as a decries [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I like to look at this thought as I mentioned this morning I'm gonna combine the thoughts here and we'll try to keep it pretty good time we were texting without hearing and listening to God so I want to combine that with the kingdom of God and we want to just read a few scriptures here let's go to Luke 17 we'll start there Luke 17 verse 20 [Music] Luke 17 verse 20 Thank You Lydia let's read 20 and 21 here tonight that'll be our text and that will have you be seated after this verse 20 I'll read verse 20 and then we call read verse 21 verse 20 says and when he was demanded the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation I think you already know my my concept the kingdom of God cometh not with observation so it didn't come with any physical observation verse 21 neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you so now think about the day of Pentecost when it come was there any earthquake to let them know is there any lightning storm or anything like that no they had some of that you know 50 days before when Jesus resurrected but that day when the Holy Ghost came there was no observation it just came quickly like the wind and he said because the kingdom of God is within you so yeah you may have your seats here I think we'll start right there by God's grace so we like to look at thought of the kingdom of God tonight and also like hearing and listening to God I want to read some scripture here so let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 I think I'll just start there you know you can hear from God in many ways and I think I think the first way I think we'll look at is Ephesians 4 the first ways through the preaching of the word so when we come to church and humble ourselves and and listen to the Word of God that's one way we can certainly hear from the Lord so Ephesians 4 and I want to start at verse 8 Asian's 4 8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high so this is speaking of Christ when Christ's body went up to heaven after the resurrection he led captivity captive he took all those who were captive in Abraham's bosom right he he basically took them captive and led them to heaven and verse 8 says and he gave gifts unto men now verse 9 now he that ascended and what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth so Paul says remember Jesus before he ascended he actually went to hell and rescue them and got the keys of death and hell the Bible says so he rescued Abraham and Jacob and Jobe and all the saints praise God he rescued him there amen but what he first descended first and lower parts of the earth verse 10 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things now verse 11 is we're going to get to here and the Bible said and he gave some apostles now these are missionaries that go out and they start churches in places that have never heard the gospel and some prophets prophets foretell events in the name of the Lord and some evangelists evangelists go to establish churches and they relight and ignite fires in people's lives you know they set them back on fire and some pastors that's what I am I stay in one place and I Shepherd a little sheet a little flock of sheep and then there's teachers that they can teach deeper and more more clearly than anybody else than the other preaching gifts so Jesus said I'm gonna go to heaven but I'm gonna send you five gifts and this will take care of you while you're there on the earth now verse verse 12 he sent these five gifts for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ there's a lot in here I just want to show the way we'll hear from God the way will be perfected and work our ministry is by listening to the five preaching gifts verse 13 until so these preaching gifts are gonna be here Paul says until we all come in the unity of faith right until all the churches can gather round on the truth of God and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so how many want to be a real a full Christian I'm gonna be a full Christian so the Bible says these five preaching gifts if you if you listen to these gifts that Jesus sent he said he went up to heaven he sent these five gifts if you listen to those you'll come into the fullness of the measure of Christ so each person has a portion of Christ that they can grow up into some can grow up into more than others depending on their calling in life and we know that because remember the Apostle Paul said he said I labored more than all the eleven apostles now Judas was one of them twelve but Judas fell he was lost so Paul was saying I labored more I wasn't one of the twelve apostles but I labeled labored more than all of them so he had a he had a commission he had a plan that God had for him that would have a greater reward it was a higher calling than the rest of them now if you would let's let's go to verse 14 so if you listen to these five preaching gifts in verse 14 that you henceforth be no more children so if you listen these five gifts you'll become a mature Christian instead of a baby or a toddler Christian right tossed to and fro you get tossed from one idea one church to the next you know you're tossed all over the place and carried about with every wind of doctrine sometimes you believe this sometimes you believe that these these winds of doctors blow you all around you don't even know what to believe right by the slate of men that's the trickery or deception of men and the cunning craftiness whereby that Lyon they lie in wait to deceive verse 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so we listen these five preaching gifts will be real full Christians we won't be tossed and confused and wandering going here and there will be solid praise God will have a place where we can be a pillar like the Bible said you'll be a pillar in the house of God and you'll grow up and you'll speak the truth in love one thing they'll know about you is that you love Jesus glory so that's the first way now there's other ways let's go to first Corinthians 12 here's another way to hear from God is through other Christians that are not preachers and these are called the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit first Corinthians 12 let's go to verse 7 first Corinthians 12:7 now we got to be careful a lot of people and I was raised in a church also that they took the gift of tongues and they made it the most important gift but it's actually not the most important gift I tried to share with the pastor and you know later on when I learned it that you know they try to force everybody to speak in tongues and that's that's not scriptural you know that's not in the Bible but I love them you know I appreciate them and there was a girl I was a thankful for the church I was raised in but the Bible says here that the first verse or the first gift is wisdom it and wisdom has to rule all the other eight gifts because there's nine gifts of the Holy Spirit so there's 5 preaching gifts that will speak to you and then there's 9 gifts of the Holy Spirit that can speak to you as well and do great things so 1st Corinthians 12 verse 7 but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal so see everybody has a spiritual gift whether they're close to God or far from God everybody has a gift verse 8 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one in the self same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so who determines your gift God determines your gift now the trouble of our church that I was raised in they said everybody's got to speak in tongues well that's going against the scripture because the scripture said God determines which gift you get now we appreciate gifts of tongues but we can't make that the gift because look at verse 29 not everybody has every gift because verse 29 says are all apostles is everybody a missionary no if everybody was a missionary there'd be no need to have home churches right because everybody would be out trying to make more churches there'd be no reason to have a home church are all apostles no are all prophets no I've never really prophesied as far as I know are all teachers I believe I'm a teacher are all workers of miracles no not everybody does miracles verse 30 have all gifts of healing no do all speak with tongues see no and that's what I tried to share with our pastor back home but you know he just he had to believe that that's okay that's his his desire do all interpret no so see verse 31 but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet I shown to you a more excellent way okay so we should desire the best gifts the best gifts are wisdom and knowledge because it goes in order wisdom knowledge then faith and then healing praise God so those are the best gifts so let me give an example go to Psalms 118 my mom was dying of cancer I remember I was in second grade I went to the hospital and she's in her white robe there on the on her deathbed they gave her six months to live and and I thought she was gonna everybody thought she was gonna die liver cancer but God anointed one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit my mom's alive today because God God's a healer without radiation she would just vanish her cancer just vanished when I was in the second grade so I've known since I've been in 2nd grade that Jesus Christ is a healer praise God and she came to Bible club two years ago and she gave her testimony in Bible club the kids got to hear her testimonies is a beautiful testimony Psalms 1:18 17 so a woman was praying in my mom's Church and and the Holy Spirit told her go tell Ruby my mom's name is Ruby go tell Ruby this scripture she's going to be healed and so this woman walked into my mom's hospital room I wasn't there my dad I think was asam's 1 18 17 says I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord so the Holy Spirit anointed this woman in the church and she came in you know praying and crying and she was so you know anoint of the Holy Spirit and so basically this woman gave my mother a word a prophecy plus it was a gift of healing who actually it known as prophecy kind like a word of knowledge as well and as soon as that woman told me mom this scripture my mom believed it she believed it she's like I'm not gonna die and all the doctors are like this woman's crazy which that's that's their job their job is to look at their job is to look at the medical books but our job is to look at the the real book when it's God's will God doesn't heal every time but and the time does gods heal we're supposed to look in God's book and so what happened was I don't know how long it was but the doctor said you know Ruby we're gonna open you up and try to take out some of this liver cancer well the night before the surgery my dad walked over and now here's where the gift the healing worked God anointed my dad he put his hand on my mom's liver there on this you know the skin above it and said I rebuke this cancer in the name of Jesus Christ and my dad said he felt a warm sensation there it got real hot and then he just you know and it is prayer well the next day they cut my mom open she showed me the scar and they can't find any cancer and so we see that's see that's a way God speaks to us through these nine gifts of the Holy Spirit praise God so God used the word of prophecy right right from the scripture wasn't a sermon my mom heard it was one of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit praise God and there's been different times you know we can all how many could raise your hands say you've seen a time where the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit I've operated praise God we saw healing a couple weeks ago I don't know if I share this with brother Andy or not but I went to my brother cam Church a couple weeks ago and preached and there was a woman there and she had she had cloudy eyes only in the middle of her eyesight could she see died sure that last week okay I did and so we prayed for her son but while we pray for a son God healed her eyes so that's a that's a that's an example of the gift of healing you might even say it's a miracle actually I don't know for sure I have to talk to her about that but if it happens instantly then it's a miracle if it takes time it's a gift of healing right miracle something that happens instantly there's no way to explain it it was just the hand of God but healing can take like you could pray for somebody and they could get healed a week later okay so that's the difference between those gifts so God can speak in those ways and that's one way to hear from God so hope everybody can see God speaks through the fivefold preaching ministry and then God can also speak through the nine gifts of the Spirit now let's go to Galatians chapter one now here's how to know if God is speaking to you in any situation so in any situation you can know if it's the Word of God or not now there are times of course God will let us struggle and we're not sure and and we might go through like what's called a test the Bible set a test of faith for Galatians 1 verse 8 and the way to know is if that voice or message does it line up with the rest of the Bible that's the way to know okay so Galatians 1 verse 8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have preached unto you let him be accursed now that's quite a statement Paul saying if anybody preaches anything different than what you've already heard they're cursed verse 9 as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel into you than what you have received let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if yet I please men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you brethren the gospel which was preached of me is not after man here it is verse 12 for neither received it I'm sorry for I neither received it of men nor neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ amen that's why if anybody tells you anything that's that's contrary to the New Testament teaching you can say that's a lie because the Bible says this because Paul was taught the gospel by Jesus Christ and if you're saying something that goes against the gospel of Jesus Christ you got the wrong spirit and that's actually called the this the the gift of discernment like we just read in 1st could' is 12 discernment means to judge so when you judge between this is the right spirit or the wrong spirit now you've got discernment that's the gift of discernment to judge between the right spirits and the wrong ones okay so that's another way to judge it as well and go to Romans chapter 2 here's another way to know here's another time Paul says this Romans chapter 2 2:16 Romans 2:16 see this New Testament is so important that Paul says God is going to judge each one of us by the New Testament writings that's why this Bible so dear to my heart because I know I'm gonna be judged by it so I want to live it praise God I wonder whatever says that's what I want to do see in that day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel so every one of us are gonna be judged by this Bible did we live this Bible do we obey this Bible that's how you know like for example with that woman who told my mom about that you know that scripture lined up with the Word of God right so and if she felt it if she felt that was God's Word to her and she believed it didn't disagree with the Bible then you believe it praise God that's one good example of that now I'll go to one more revelation 22:18 and 19 so the Bible ends with one last warning that if anything is spoken contrary to the Word of God then you know it's not though it's not hearing from God revelation 22:18 and 19 alright verse 18 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written this book this is not Old Testament church this is New Testament right so this is still the but still serious thing to be a Christian God still has high calling we got to be careful how we live our lives and make sure it's pleasing unto God verse 19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things where it's your written in this book so we have a responsibility we can't add to it or take away from it praise God now I just want to give a few examples go to first Timothy now and I do apologize you know I don't have this scripture but first Timothy 2 here's a popular here's let me do two examples let me do women preachers and homosexuality and I and you know some people may not understand what the Bible says about it that's why we made the YouTube videos you know to try to show that the Bible is against both you know the Bible is against women preaching and leading churches and the Bible's against homosexuality and that doesn't mean we condemn people we don't send them to hell but we pray for them right and we ask God to be merciful so let me just give an example here the Bible says verse 11 first Timothy 2:11 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to assert authority over the man but to be in silence so when it comes to someone preaching the Word of God the Paul says I don't allow a woman to teach men now here you say we might say why well verse 13 tells us for Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so God goes back and he tells us why in the beginning the man was not deceived the woman was deceived and she was deceived away from believing the word so God said because of that she can't teach and I'm gonna have the man lead now he's not a better person because in Christ were all one in Christ Jesus everyone's equally as valuable but because of that God gives man the leadership because he was created first and she came out of him so he's just called to be the leader right but if he doesn't lead well he gets a greater condemnation so with more responsibility and power I'm sorry with more power comes more responsibility so verse 13 notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing sea she's called with the children if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety now the same man that wrote this said if you change any of this you're cursed right and so we're not trying to put curses on anybody because I know there's a lot of big churches that let women preach but we're just standing here we're just standing here holding the flag and saying this is this is the real Christianity praise God this is the real Bible teaching amen and it's not with anger we say that it's with love we say that we're holding the banner of the true gospel of Jesus Christ now here another example which I have some friends that are homosexual and try to be kind you know but the Bible says it's go to at Romans chapter 1 the Bible says it's wrong and the Bible actually says when a person accepts that and believes that they've actually lost their right mind Paul says that so I just want to lay and I hope this is helpful these two examples right you can see two examples how moderate a lot of modern churches today will just say well what they're doing is they're actually taking that scripture out of the out of their teaching and if they take away from the word we just read it then their names can be taken out of the book of life now we pray there is a way out and it's repentance for any of us if I sin if you sin you know whoever no matter what if we sin God will forgive us if we repent he's merciful he's long-suffering he he would that all men be saved amen but we got a humble ourselves and say we're wrong and the Bible's right we have to say that praise God because this is what we're gonna be judged by we just read that you and I will all be judged by this Bible right here Paul's gospel now Romans 1 and Church it's in it's in three places in the New Testament Paul says homosexuality is wrong so it's not just one time it's it's numerous times all right now there's there's a couple places let's just go to verse 24 just so everybody can see it so this is this is these are two examples of how we can hear from God and listen to God you know with with someone's calling am I called to preach or not and even a relationship should I have a homosexual relationship or not these are just two simple examples of a few you know the way you know if it's of God is to take it back to the word so Romans 1:24 wherefore God also gave them up to their uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves now this is speaking of homosexuality you'll see in a minute who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature so he's talking about lesbians here verse 27 and likewise also the men which men are called sodomites right leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of the air which was meat now he's speaking of sodom and gomorrah which was given over to sodomites or men that were homosexual and what happened them God burned it with fire and we know Peter says gods can do the same thing with it this earth but first he's going to rapture the church out of here then he's gonna burn it with fire amen he's gonna rescue his believers he's in a rescue the children of God and then the Bible says burn it with fervent heat and they's gonna bring back his Saints praise God and have a thousand-year honeymoon aim the head glory yes verse 28 and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge see they don't like the Bible God gave them over to see right here there's a reprobate mind so see God God gives him over to a rejected mind to do think but you're not convenient so someone who is homosexual homosexual I hate to say it and I'm not judging them but the Bible says God has to give them over to a different kind of mind because they've rejected the knowledge of God and this Bible is the knowledge of God to do those things which are not convenient verse 29 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of God see they know the judgments of God that they which commit such are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure and then that do them and now they do it in parades right the lgbtq and and church we're not we're not condemning them but we're warning them if they don't repent then the wrath of God is the only thing left for them and we pray for them I pray for them many times amen everyone remember 2015 when the Supreme Court first did that my I pray too late on my face right here and I prayed and cried out to God that God would end it but it's still allowed to go but see the real child of God cries out and say God save what you can amen but we know all the prophecy says the world has to get more wicked and wicked and wicked and then God will judge it but then God will start all over Amen alright now I hope you can see that two clear examples women pastors preachers are not preaching to men and then a homosexuality to kind of controversial subjects but they're not controversial to the because the Bible is clear you're never gonna find Jesus calling a woman to lead a bunch of men you'll never find that you never it was never in the Old Testament either they always bring up Deborah but Deborah was a judge and a judge doesn't lead the priesthood led a man Aaron and the priesthood and although all the priests at the tabernacle they're the ones that led the people of God a judge was just a judge they were just they had their place in the judicial system but they weren't the leaders of the people the leaders were the priests praise God so and of course homosexual and that's always been Old Testament New Testament that's always been condemned and that's the Word of God so we we just reach out and we pray and we ask God to minister and oh we had a good testimony about that yeah brother Dennis McBride from South Carolina did I share this he started a church of about 8 or 9 years ago down there and real small smaller than ours now that's hard to get that's really hard to get Church small huh but he started the church and then one of the women in his church in this previous church back slid and went into a lesbian lifestyle and she got really far from God but then she heard brother Dennis was a pastor and she always had respect for brother Dennis a real man of God and at that moment she started going to his church and they and she started coming to faithfully and they kept praying and God delivered her from that lifestyle and now she's free aim ahead glory amen the Bible said it see it's it's the it's the lust of the flesh that you know they they lust to do those things but that's a perfect example of how even when we fall short and backside into sin God is merciful God's still reaching out if we just come and confess our sins and humble ourselves God can heal us amen Oh glory amen starting to feel good tonight amen oh this morning brother Andy I was running around I use yourself you know glory so now let's look at the kingdom of God for a few minutes is that okay let me set my time like just give me half an hour let me look at the kingdom of God so I started I tried about a half hour on that and let's do a half hour in the kingdom of God now the word kingdom means a realm or rule or Dominion so and we read the scripture where Jesus said the kingdom of God does not come with observation you know you're not gonna see like that everybody's looking for the blood moons today now how these things they're looking for all these signs but really the kingdom of God comes just by the will of God and the kingdom of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God because Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you so the rule of the Holy Spirit the Dominion of the Holy Spirit is in your soul that's how God starts his kingdom he puts his kingdom in you go amen that's how he starts a kingdom he puts you in a now let me prove it go to Matthew 4:17 Jesus the first thing Jesus preaches is repent that means leave your sin and come close to the kingdom of God because he said the kingdom of God is coming Matthew 4:17 from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand at hand right he was starting to show them it's closed the kingdom of heaven is closed he said the kingdom of heaven is gonna be within you amen the Holy Spirit in you glory go to Matthew 16 since we're there then Jesus says Peter I'm giving you the keys of the kingdom Matthew 16 18 and 19 actually go to 16 17 Matthew 16 17 and jesus answered and said to him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven can you say Amen he says I'm giving you the keys to the kingdom now we've been through this before as a church so we're not going to go there but there was three types of people in God's economy in the Bible there was Jews Gentiles and Samaritans right Jews were just plain Hebrews Gentiles were non Hebrews Samaritans were a mixture they were both Jew and Gentile so God had three kinds and Peter preached the Holy Spirit to all three groups and all three groups got the Holy Ghost amen so Jesus's words he said the kingdom of heaven is closed the clean up of heaven is at hand repent get ready the Holy Ghost is going to come get ready for it to come amen and then Peter went and preached the Holy Ghost to all three groups and the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God started coming into people's lives and then they started obeying the Dominion of the Holy Spirit in other words they started letting the Holy Spirit rule their lives amen that's it right there that's the kingdom of God within you is the Holy Spirit in you ruling your life praise God and let's prove it again revelation 1 so see when you get born again and the kingdom of God is within you now you have a spirit since you're part of a kingdom now you have a spiritual office you're a king and a priest unto God all right let's read revelation 1:5 five and six and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten to the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood my that's a beautiful scripture right there he washed us he took his own blood right picture you mothers and I do it sometimes too I'll take that detergent I'll put it in the laundry well Jesus was putting his own blood in there and we were the ones in the washing machine praise God right he washed us from our sins in his own blood just to give you a little picture in your mind verse 6 and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen see when the kingdom of God is in you now you're a king not physically right like we all wish we could be the presidents but we're not going to be but we're actually greater than that because we're a king in the kingdom of God and were priests in the kingdom of God as well and priests you know king is someone who rules like King David he ruled all of Israel and he brought all the nations and Solomon they brought all the nations in subjection and they had to pay their taxes to him you know and all these things they ruled now the priest though is the one who interceded the priest went in the holiest of Holies so all the people could be forgiven and that's what we're supposed to do in prayer we're supposed to go in the prints of God and take people's needs in the presence of God so we're kings we rule over sin praise God amen we drive out any invaders in of sin into in our lives praise God we drive them out because we're the king and we're priests we intercede through prayer so that God will hear our prayers and minister and help people praise God amen so this is the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost inside of us praise God Amen boy I was real happy I'm not gonna be able get to it but church did you know there's 15 parables about the kingdom of God Jesus gave 15 parables about the kingdom of God seven of them are in Matthew chapter 13 I wrote a chapter on that for my next book seven of them are in Matthew 13 but there's eight more a total of fifteen parables about the kingdom of heaven and so maybe in the next few weeks we'll look at those Lord willing you know now that I'm done with the numerology series the biblical numerology now maybe I ignore the kingdom of heaven we'll see now I want you to see this to go to Matthew 12:34 I want you to see this to show you the kingdom of heaven they were preaching Jesus was preaching about the Holy Ghost it's going to come it's going to come he said o generation of vipers I'm sorry no I'm sorry's mark 12 I'm sorry honey I say it wrong it's mark 12 34 my fault sweetie mark 12 34 yeah oh yeah this is a good Scripture now let me yeah let me turn there real quick I just got a real quick thought I want to throw out here bear with me here mark 12 34 now let's read that it says and Jesus saw that he answered discreetly and he said him thou art not far from the kingdom of God now what was the question he said what's the greatest commandment in the verses above right and and Jesus said the first commandment here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and verse 30 with all thy soul and with all thy mind and I like this one and with all thy strength see this is the first commandment and this second is like namely thou shalt love the Lord thy God I'm sorry love thy neighbor as thyself there's none other commandment greater than the praise the Lord and then a verse 33 the man says you're right to love God is greater than all the animal sacrifices we could ever give and Jesus said you're not far from the kingdom of God when you serve God based upon your love you're not far from the kingdom of God amen see no one's forcing me to come up here I'm not coming to preach or serve God oh I don't go to school and try to witness and you know I don't go to the place and try to witness based upon fear I go there and love amen because I love the Lord amen and Jesus says you're not far now I want you to go back up to verse 30 though mark 12:30 with all your strength see we put so much energy and strength into other things but we've got to come to a place to our lives and as those of us who work we handle or go to school you understand you only have so much strength in your day right some days the kids at school they paw almost all the virtue out of me I hardly have any strength at all left when I get home but the Bible says we're to love God with all of our strength praise God so we've got to find the balance to be able to give strength to our jobs but you know have strength to do the will of God as well because the Bible said love God with all your strength your human strength now I want to look at the next one go to Luke 16:16 it's going to take Church as we know God wants us to give all of our strength God wants to see us to put our best strength our best effort into the things of God right Luke 16:16 the law in the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it see how do you get in the kingdom of God it's through effort right it's through dying out praise the Lord and he says you're not far from the kingdom when you understand I've got to put all my human effort into the things of God a man because Jesus says you've got to press into it so you've got to push into it you've got to press past all the distractions and you've got to really get in the presence of God just like a priest right you got to go past the outer court the inner court and the Holy of Holies you've got to press into the presence of God that's beautiful now looking now let's do another one acts 1:14 acts 1:14 look how the first group press in the kingdom of God and that will give you an idea how we're gonna press this into it or if you haven't pressed into it how you can press into it Luke 1 I'm sorry acts 1:14 so this is after Jesus left them and the angel said go wait in Jerusalem until you get the Holy Ghost and the Bible said and they all continued with one Accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brother amen and that beautiful how did they press into it they said we're gonna take a 10 day vacation and we're just gonna pray and get in the Spirit of God or getting the pleasing to God and then the Spirit of God fell amen and who was the man that pre ship Peter was the man because he had the keys to the kingdom praise God amen glory I hope everybody can see this this is the kingdom of God the Holy Ghost inside of individuals praise the Lord now I just feel kind of moved here kind of a different thought yeah let me show two examples here let's go to Acts chapter eight its to two examples now we had we've had people you know not in our church but we had people like a Bible club we've had guest preachers come in and they'll tell the kids you know I appreciate them coming to speak but we had guest preachers I would tell the kids like that they say you've got the Holy Ghost and you've got the power of God and I'm thinking oh man these kids they love God but they're not filled with the Holy Ghost because if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you've got power to live a godly life right now I'm glad they want to serve God but the point I'm trying to make is that when you when you're really a part of the kingdom of God God lives inside of you praise God and you've got power to live the Christian life whereas I see these and I've seen many of them I love the sweet kids but there they get baptized but then they go back out and they play video games and they get addicted to you know movies and I hear them cussed later on as I get older I've seen them get baptized and then get older and their custom and swearing and fighting at recess and yeah that's not the Christian life they've got to start in Christianity but they got to get born again and this proves it just cuz I want to just show it here in Acts chapter eight so I want to go to acts 8 verse 12 so Philip went and preached in Samaria and he started baptizing people but they weren't filled with the Holy Ghost yet right in other words they were there making they were close to the kingdom of God but the kingdom of God was not in them yet but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done now when the Apostles which were Jerusalem heard that the Samaria had received the Word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost so see getting saved and baptized is just the beginning you've got to keep serving God until you receive the Holy Ghost now verse 16 it says it's so plainly right here and this is another false doctrine that's getting got into a lot of churches you know they'll have they'll have a baptism day people get baptized but the people aren't baptized with the Holy Ghost the they got to get filled with the Holy Ghost then they'll see the works of God and the miracles of God and the power of God and the life of God in their lives they met it see for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so see a lot of people today that's good it's good to get baptized but I know I can look at my life and when I got baptized I still struggle with this this and that but years later I got the Holy Ghost I didn't struggle with those things anymore I had power and after that I saw God do miracles in my life cast out demons you know God's done different miracles in my life I've seen that but I wasn't born again when I got baptized I had to keep going and then get the kingdom of God inside of me praise God glory that's right so that's one example oh yes let's keep reading verse 17 then lay their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost so a bunch of people were baptized but they hadn't yet received the Holy Ghost and then they prayed they kept praying the later hands on them then the Holy Ghost came down now the kingdom of God's in amen that's right church that's right beautiful so we can see some people can be close to the kingdom of God but not be or not have the kingdom of God in them yet because the kingdom of God is within you it's God dwelling in you praise God all right no let me show this I want to I want to show this too so let's go a couple more scriptures did you know there's two kingdoms there's a kingdom of the Sun Jesus and then there's the kingdom of the Father how many knew that there's two kingdoms right now is the kingdom of Jesus right now but after all the Judgment Day and after all the sinners and Satan and all the demons are cast a lake of fire after that it becomes the kingdom of the Father it all goes back to Daddy amen let's prove it cautions 1:13 so see this is the kingdom of Jesus now this is the kingdom Jesus kingdom is here now in the hearts of believers all right who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son can you say Amen see when you get born again Paul says we are he hath already done it he hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son which means we're kings and priests right now we're to rule over sin were to intercede for others and were to do it with God's power praise God but there's gonna come a time after everything's been put down first Corinthians 15 24 where it'll go back to being the kingdom of the Father so see before before there was even a world it was the kingdom of the Father right and then he created his son of course to help to manifest his love to us to be a redeemer and then when all of a sin is done away with and and all that's been forgotten every tears and wiped away from our eyes amen when all that's done away with it goes back to what it was in the beginning the kingdom of his father hey man the kingdom of God the Father first Corinthians 15:20 for then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father when he shall put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign speaking of Christ Christ must reign the kingdom of the son here it says I'm sorry I lost my spot yeah so he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death amen glory so actually the first one that gets cast in the fire is the Antichrist he's the first one that GAD he just gets straight thrown in the fire and then you have the demons and then the day of judgment then Satan is cast in there and the last one that's in there is death the spirit of death death is cast in lake of fire and then Jesus delivers it back to his father praise God which we know the father's invisible praise the Lord in other words it goes back to being it's all about God the father's all about the Holy Spirit and that's what the Bible says so right now we're in the kingdom of his dear son but one day the kingdom will go back to the Father praise God amen I got so much on here I'm just trying to see Lord help me with these last few thousand got about ten minutes here let me uh let me bring out the right thoughts here let me let's go this you like this one Luke 22 28 based upon our obedience here will be appointed a portion of the kingdom during the thousand-year millennium so Luke 22 28 because that's what Jesus tells his disciples he says because you've continued with me I will appoint to you a kingdom in other words a portion of that kingdom Luke 22 28 ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations that's what we got to do Church we just got to stay with the word amen just stay in the Bible just stay with the truth just stay with God just continue with the Lord amen no matter what comes or goes you just stay with the Lord verse 29 and I appoint unto you a kingdom my father hath appointed unto me amen so see that this is Jesus kingdom right now the kingdom of the Holy Spirit and the father appointed Jesus to have this kingdom of the Holy Spirit ruling in the lives of people but he says once this is all done he tells his twelve disciples I'm gonna appoint you a kingdom verse 30 that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel hallelujah praise God amen if we can let the kingdom of God rule our lives now then Jesus says I'll make you a ruler in the next world the next kingdom praise God hallelujah now think that that brings the scripture to mind here where Jesus said you'll rule 10 cities so let me find that real quick I didn't have my notes but let me pull that up here okay it's Luke 19 17 okay we're really close Luke 19 17 now this is a parable of Jesus it's that's a parallel passage to the parable of the talents in Matthew 25 but it's in it's in Luke 19 it's a very similar story and Jesus is coming back to ask them what did you do with the gifts that I gave you myrrh 17 and he sending them well now a good servant because thou has been faithful very little have now authority over ten cities geez the Bible said Jesus gave him one pound I don't know how much money that is it's probably in the thousands because the five taels remember the five taels this was 800 thousand dollars today remember that we preach that while ago we did some research on that so this is one pound he said if you're faithful with one pound I'll make you ruler over ten cities praise God so see we must be faithful with a very little I just got a very little church I got to be faithful of but if I can be faithful over this church then God said he would give us rewards later that's not why we do it but the fact is we're in a kingdom now and we've got to rule over this kingdom well right now he wants us to spread the kingdom of God the kingdom of heaven he wants us to spread it in the lives of believers right now praise God does that help everybody's that helped by God's grace okay I hope so praise the Lord let me find the last one yeah I got a couple minutes here let me find the last few scriptures here praise God now Aaron I talked about this recently but brother we were talking it seems like the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven is the same thing so maybe we can end with that we talked about how they could be different let me show you why I think it may be the same because we've already read the scripture about Jesus preach the kingdom of heaven he said the kingdom of God is within you now go to Matthew 25 1 Matthew 25 1 it seems like in all the parables Jesus calls those the kingdom of heaven but it seems like in all the times where he's just talking about the Holy Spirit he's talking about the kingdom of God but we know they're all the same thing praise God so that's this was this was fresh to me brother this is fresh to me and remember Peter was given the keys to heaven he's the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 16 we just read that so it seems like they're the same now I could be wrong on that but I was as I was studying this thought came to me yesterday I thought well let's just prove it by the scripture Matthew 25 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom now we all know this right this parable right there was five versions that were wise five were foolish the five that were wise had the oil and oil symbolizes the Holy Ghost right and they took their oil the Holy Ghost and they went out to the wedding of the son which was Jesus but there was five that were version they were still appear to God but they didn't have the oil so they went to buy oil but in the time they went to buy the the wedding procession went in the groom's bridegroom's home they locked the door and when the foolish virgin comes they let us in Jesus says I can't let you in you were supposed to have the oil ready to go so in other words if you want to go in the rapture if you want to go to the wedding you got to have the Holy Ghost now amen praise God you got to get it now and not later you got to get it now hallelujah so see this is a parable of the kingdom of heaven so to me kingdom of heaven and kingdom of God they seem to be the same they seem to be synonyms we'd say in school talk they seem to be the same thing because Peter had the keys of the kingdom of heaven the Bible says that praise God so does that help by God's grace hope that helps us to understand that the the difference is the kingdom is you have earthly kingdoms like the king the United States the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the kingdom of North Korea you have all these kingdoms natural but we're a spiritual Kingdom praise God and this is the kingdom of his dear son the holy ghost of the kingdom of Jesus Christ and that will last until the last enemy death is thrown in there and now we just caught the kingdom of God amen the kingdom of the Father because it all goes back to him because it all started with him praise God all right let's stand to our feet and we'll just do one more scripture let's stand here I'll try to just do one more yeah let's just do one more let's close with this thought here on your effort you and I must give effort we must press into the kingdom of God we must love God with all of our strength so let's close this thought right here second Thessalonians 1:5 let if you can pull that one up there let's close with that now they're getting secure this Thessalonians they were getting persecuted but Paul Paul says that's a that's a appearing token that's an obvious token of the righteous judgment of God that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which also you suffer so the reason I brought the scriptures to show you that the reason you have to go through your trials and the hardships like we talked about patience last week right you only get patience through trials the reason you have to go through that is so you can be counted worthy of the kingdom of God that you overcame you chose to continue with Jesus despite all the trouble despite all the criticism like today our biggest persecution is not physical no one's threatening us to put us in jail our biggest criticism or our biggest persecution is people speaking bad about us talking bad about us right avoiding us right just won't even talk about God with you any more speaking bad putting bad things about you or texting about you or you know backbiting you're gossiping about you well they anything they're better they're I think their Holy Roller you know we're not better than anybody we're just trying to obey the Word of God see that you you go through trials so you be counted worthy of the kingdom of God praise the Lord so let's have our musicians come here let's end with that I tried to be more mindful the time I didn't want to go too late here by the grace of God but was that a good start in the kingdom of God I just want to lay in some some clear truths there's human kingdoms but then there's a spiritual Kingdom right now and we're ruling over that kingdom praise God by the power of God by the power of God hallelujah so it's of our heads let's think about this and let's think about this thought here as we bow our heads think about am I am I giving all my strength am i pressing into the kingdom of God can I give more of myself to the kingdom of God and this is just the serve as a reminder to us and also conviction if we're not giving all to the kingdom of God Church then let's give all of our strength to the kingdom of God remember jesus said you're not far from the kingdom when you realize it's all about love through love I give my strength through love I try to witness through love I try to be closer to God through love I try to pray for my lost loved ones love amen when we realize it's love driving our efforts then we're not far from the kingdom and if you got the love you are in the kingdom of God amen let's meditate on that just for a moment [Music] thank you Jesus hallelujah just think about your life just for a few moments let's have a few solemn moments life is filled with all this laughter and jokes which is alright sometimes but let's be real solemn here now let's pray Church let's just pray in our hearts there's any repenting we need to do just we just quickly ask the Lord to forgive us let's ask God to help us to give more strength let's be counted worthy of the kingdom of God [Music] let's ask God to help us to press into it if we're not into it puts the press into it if we are in it let's give God all of our strength paying ahead George hallelujah let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this word that we've heard tonight you've taught us how we can hear your voice amen through the five preaching gifts of the nine gifts of the Spirit and you gave us examples Lord of how we can filter everything we hear through the Word
