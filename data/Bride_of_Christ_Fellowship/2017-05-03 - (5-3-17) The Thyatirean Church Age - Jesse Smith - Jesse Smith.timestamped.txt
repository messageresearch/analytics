[32:19] out to us in Jesus Christ in church said
[32:22] hey that guy misses the sticker Bibles
[32:24] to Revelation chapter 2 verse 18
[32:30] relation to 18 like to be in the
[32:32] Thyatira church 8 tonight for
[32:34] interchange making pretty good progress
[32:39] here so happy to get to the fourth
[32:43] trilogy I've already preached to seven
[32:45] back in 2015 but I'll probably
[32:47] appreciate it or maybe some parts of it
[32:49] did the highlights of it but you let's
[32:51] get there by God's grace book truly
[32:54] enjoying this series and hope it's not a
[32:56] lesson to you it's been a tremendous
[32:58] encouragement to me I want to show the
[33:01] course again as usual
[33:03] God's grace revelation 2:18 as you can
[33:10] tell there's a lot more scriptures you
[33:12] know for this church age than the
[33:14] previous church change so just read
[33:16] let's just read the first two 18 and 19
[33:22] let's read that together the speed at 1
[33:25] 2 3 and unto the Angel of the church in
[33:28] Thyatira write these things saith a son
[33:32] of God who had his eyes like unto a
[33:35] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[33:39] brass I know thy works and charity and
[33:43] service and faith and I patience and I
[33:46] verse and the last be more than the
[33:50] first amen
[33:52] blessing his Rivas word may raise a
[33:58] little so look at this top your tonight
[33:59] and I just want to say thanks to about
[34:01] amen with another Pope song service but
[34:03] I really enjoyed that thank you sir I
[34:05] was wonderful thank you maybe I'd be
[34:08] that if we could I was gonna ask you
[34:10] we could sing one more song again we're
[34:14] going to enjoy this on the loveless Lake
[34:16] that was his go ahead I just love that
[34:18] song
[34:19] if you could maybe even Syrian or
[34:21] willing if I remember I might forget you
[34:23] know if your number than be a blessing
[34:28] so let's look at the Thyatira in church
[34:30] age night are you happy to be the house
[34:32] of Lord tonight I kind of want to beat
[34:34] anywhere else but be in God's house
[34:37] praise God and to again hear the word of
[34:41] the Lord so let's look at this history
[34:43] part one I imagine as I was looking for
[34:45] the notes that I have about maybe five
[34:46] or six sermons on this by the grace of
[34:49] Lord if you listen to him now on the
[34:51] nineteen sixty tapes this is the
[34:54] shortest one prior to your church age is
[34:56] only like a two-hour sermon
[34:57] very short back I just finished it today
[34:59] Oh real slowly through it you know how
[35:01] about twenty minutes in the car here
[35:03] twenty minutes in the car here I get two
[35:05] studies home forty five minutes our gear
[35:08] are there so all the way through it what
[35:10] a tremendous message it was but it's one
[35:13] of the shortest but man he has to cut it
[35:14] short he said because he was a tiny bit
[35:16] hoarse he kinda fit the sermons yours oh
[35:19] I understand the heart throat's a little
[35:20] so our source or so just a reminder here
[35:25] we've now preached the first research
[35:27] ages and also the last by God's grace
[35:30] but now we're the port this is the
[35:32] longest church age 914 years almost a
[35:37] thousand years and this is what's often
[35:40] consider the dark ages as you know or
[35:42] the medieval times as many of you know
[35:44] if you've done a history class or
[35:47] college class or something this is
[35:49] called the Dark Ages so we're here now
[35:53] Columba this is a strange choice as a
[35:56] church age messenger which we'll talk
[35:58] about in just a minute but again here's
[36:00] the here's the time that we're looking
[36:01] at by God's grace here's the summary
[36:04] brother Brandon gifts
[36:05] this is the night after he actually
[36:08] preached the Thyatira he didn't eat him
[36:10] preview that night when he preached the
[36:13] Thyatira church as he was the next night
[36:14] there in the sardian church age he
[36:16] previewed it or summarized a rather
[36:18] summarized and the for church age was
[36:21] Thyatira Columba being the age of the
[36:23] church age the messenger 606 to 1520 and
[36:27] the church age was papal seducing the
[36:31] Dark Ages was last night if you know the
[36:35] dark ages and the reward was power to
[36:38] rule over the nation's and the
[36:40] Morningstar to the angel that's also to
[36:43] every believer power to rule the
[36:46] nation's I can't wait to get to that
[36:47] dock you realize that church if you rule
[36:51] over sin doubt your rule over nations
[36:53] and later and many Jesus has very few
[36:57] will find it see there's going to be
[36:59] plenty of laying the rule over all right
[37:01] why because there's very few that
[37:02] actually overcame we want to be one of
[37:05] those by God's grace so what do you do
[37:07] Jesus the Bible said lay up beside every
[37:09] sit and run the race with perseverance
[37:11] amen let aside everything else make
[37:14] Christ your number one desire amen
[37:16] so again as we said I just want to show
[37:19] that again that's the summary papal
[37:21] seducing and how does he do it
[37:23] he does it through the spirit of Jezebel
[37:25] right Loran said it bands from Balaam to
[37:28] Jezebel of course Jezebel's Roman
[37:31] Catholic Church he says so just to give
[37:33] you an idea but it shows you the same
[37:35] spirit that was in Jezebel is now in the
[37:37] Roman Catholic Church but this is when
[37:39] it really took ahold and number one
[37:41] Jezebel do first she killed all the true
[37:44] prophets well not all the most of them
[37:45] and she set up idols in the true temple
[37:49] of God and then she built her own
[37:51] temples of idols and everything and
[37:53] that's exactly what the Roman Catholic
[37:55] Church hid in this church age on a grand
[37:57] scale so Jesus was very prophetic of
[38:01] this church age when he had John write
[38:03] that in 1896
[38:04] he's very prophetic looking down through
[38:06] the hundreds and 2,000 years of time in
[38:09] a thousand years of time to see what was
[38:12] going to happen near this church age but
[38:14] he was still with them anyway despite
[38:15] the awful Dark Ages there was still a
[38:17] little bit of light every
[38:19] her brother Rams at this age was darker
[38:21] than our age now why is it darker
[38:24] because in the evening time they shall
[38:26] be light we got a little more light
[38:27] because we've got the full revelation of
[38:30] the word amen
[38:31] but this was the darkest age where there
[38:33] was hardly any light hardly any truth
[38:35] the darkest age tire tear now remember
[38:40] on top here's the church age again I
[38:42] just have different you can see the
[38:43] church age behind there I just put the
[38:45] seals remember on top of it and it lines
[38:48] up very very well
[38:49] so the first seagull of course was the
[38:52] white horse but the lion anointing
[38:54] helped overcome so that white anointing
[38:57] that deception last into the second
[38:58] church age but then brother Rams that he
[39:00] jumped off the white and got into a
[39:02] bloody red during that second church age
[39:06] when he could start killing right he can
[39:08] start killing the Christians his church
[39:10] and state were uniting and that lasted
[39:12] quite a while into the church age we're
[39:15] now going to teach on them now remember
[39:17] if you look up history when did the
[39:19] indulgences start it was around the year
[39:21] 980 that's why I put them this dark
[39:24] anointing the Black Horse anointing
[39:26] sorry right before you know the thousand
[39:28] year mark there
[39:29] that's when because that's when he's
[39:30] captured the wealth of the world so went
[39:33] from deception to killing to capturing
[39:37] the wealth of the world through
[39:38] indulgences right Inquisition all kinds
[39:41] of conquering and the Crusades remember
[39:43] that all that took place there this
[39:45] black a-19 time and then the eagle
[39:48] anointing come at the end time to combat
[39:50] this spiritual death that we have now
[39:53] now remember church that's not my idea
[39:56] that's the state the Lord it's not my
[39:58] dear brother Graham talk that and he
[40:00] said the vision of the seals plus the
[40:02] word plus the history plus the church
[40:04] and ages it all blends together
[40:06] he said plus the Word of God the
[40:08] revision the revelation interpretation
[40:10] is the stay at the Lord
[40:12] that's not my smartness that's not me
[40:14] trying to be a scholar that's the Holy
[40:16] Ghost telling us exactly what to look
[40:17] for in this hour you believe that amen
[40:20] so much so that member after after
[40:23] brother Graham got done preaching this
[40:24] at night at 1961 he actually finished it
[40:27] the Holy Spirit came and did this
[40:30] chose that this light shadow - that one
[40:32] - that one - that one did that one -
[40:34] this one on the wall the tabernacle
[40:36] there was a 300 witnesses their mother
[40:37] Graham said and I've indicated that this
[40:41] was the truth of God exactly the right
[40:43] and we got it on tape you can listen to
[40:45] I played it a few times here I think
[40:47] recently I think I played it one time I
[40:48] just can't member a little tired tonight
[40:50] Barry with me
[40:51] oh so let's start with the city of
[40:54] Thyatira we're just going broke up
[40:55] quickly through this fire tears right
[40:58] here hey in modern-day Turkey so we had
[41:01] Ephesus Severna Pergamos if you remember
[41:03] her most became the literal seat of
[41:04] Satan
[41:05] during that church age but that had
[41:07] moved to Rome moved west her own it
[41:10] literally became the seat of Satan okay
[41:12] that's where the Babylonian ruler
[41:15] Attalus went after they after he was
[41:17] defeated in Iraq he moved to Pergamos
[41:19] history shows that so the literal seat
[41:22] of Babylon went from Iraq to Turkey up
[41:24] to Rome right now we're in the fourth
[41:27] church age so I got another reading to
[41:30] do but just just some background
[41:31] historically the city of Thyatira was
[41:33] the least noteworthy of all the seven
[41:35] cities of Revelation it was situated on
[41:37] the confines of my Isha and Iona I'm
[41:40] sorry I oh yeah
[41:41] it was surrounded by many rivers but
[41:43] they're all for the bleaches it's most
[41:45] commendable be true was that it was a
[41:48] well it was well off financially used
[41:50] with the corporate guilds of potters
[41:52] Tanner's Weaver's dyers ropemaker's etc
[41:55] it was from this city that Lydia the
[41:58] seller of purple came interested I've
[42:02] never got opened her heart amen
[42:04] now the reason that the spear chose this
[42:06] city as the one already containing the
[42:09] spiritual elements for the fourth age
[42:11] was because of its religion okay so
[42:15] another Church ages you know the actual
[42:16] city itself had something do with it
[42:18] most it wasn't because the finances of
[42:20] fire tear it was because of this
[42:22] spiritual condition the major religion
[42:26] of fact here was the worship of Apollo
[42:28] ty Rimini Oh Sinestro seda which was
[42:32] joined of the Emperor worship cult this
[42:35] is what kind of churches they had Apollo
[42:38] was the Sun God and the next little
[42:40] power to his father Zeus
[42:44] he Apollo communicated his knowledge of
[42:47] the future and his father's will to men
[42:50] through the prophets and Oracle's the
[42:52] entire tear this ritual was conducted by
[42:54] a prophetess who sat on a tripod chair
[42:59] and delivered the messages while in
[43:01] trance they would go to church and they
[43:04] would wait to this woman God entranced
[43:06] and then she would spew forth these
[43:08] thoughts and then they would all they'd
[43:10] all worship it's all God spoke to us
[43:11] Apollo spoke to us you know Zeus come to
[43:14] us through Apollo and then through this
[43:15] woman just awful now look what the goal
[43:18] history says my grandfather's history
[43:20] the hold of this religion wasn't
[43:22] remarkable but I'd say like this our
[43:25] hold on our religion is more remarkable
[43:28] right because something keeps holding
[43:30] you at I tonight amen it's God's Spirit
[43:33] now but see the Spirit of Devil's held
[43:36] them strongly they straw a beliefs order
[43:38] this church why do they strongly support
[43:41] this church well that's reading its
[43:43] power did not like screw silly in the
[43:45] rental mystery but later in the fact
[43:47] that no one come along to the Guild's
[43:48] which offer the people they're living
[43:51] see either you know whether you are a
[43:53] temp sorry basket maker or weaver
[43:56] whatever you were so your work was
[43:59] connected to the church see that so they
[44:02] connected which offer the people their
[44:04] living unless they belong to the temple
[44:06] worship Apollo's overs you can't have a
[44:08] job in our town unless you belong to our
[44:10] church that's why it was so was such a
[44:13] stronghold anyone who refused to join in
[44:17] the idolatrous feasts and license orgies
[44:20] was barred from these first century
[44:23] unions in order to be a part of the
[44:25] social and commercial life one had to be
[44:28] a practicing pagan idolatry and that
[44:30] awful this was the city that Christ
[44:34] listened to this city most resembles the
[44:37] Dark Ages
[44:38] he believed that now we don't have time
[44:41] to go through it but you know how much
[44:42] awful sexual sin was in the Roman
[44:45] Catholic Church and the Pope's popes
[44:47] were famous for having mistresses
[44:49] adulterers bastard children it's all
[44:53] chronicled in history and a lot of it
[44:56] came during this term
[44:57] so you know there's a lot of conspiracy
[44:59] theories out there but a lot of them are
[45:02] true a lot of it were true I don't like
[45:04] to be a conspiracy theorist you know but
[45:07] a lot of the things about the Roman
[45:08] Catholic Church are true in fact I was
[45:11] listening to it today I'm reading it
[45:12] today Revelation 16 and 17 did you know
[45:14] the Vatican is going to be destroyed
[45:16] because they're guilty of all the
[45:18] murders of all the martyrs of Christ so
[45:21] every murder of a Christian ultimately
[45:23] goes back to the spirit behind the Roman
[45:26] Catholic Church it don't even have to be
[45:28] the Roman Catholic Church it has to be
[45:30] that but it has to be that sphere behind
[45:32] it which is that dominating Spirit is
[45:35] that right now so what's fair to got in
[45:38] the Muslims you got that dominating
[45:40] spirit see it's the same spirit just a
[45:43] different disguise every single into the
[45:45] Hat
[45:45] I hope you see that it's the same spirit
[45:48] because it wants to dominate and kill
[45:50] and destroy any true believer with it so
[45:53] see that's why it all goes back to that
[45:55] because it's the same spirit it might
[45:57] have a different mass start a different
[45:58] church sale on it different shrine date
[46:00] or whatever
[46:01] what is the sustained even power because
[46:03] all the wrath of God gets poured out
[46:06] upon that mother of harlots mother of it
[46:08] all
[46:08] she started it all and she's got
[46:11] daughters say that that's right so see
[46:14] look at this awful that's why Jesus
[46:15] chooses this city is this city is going
[46:17] to have the same characteristics and a
[46:19] t56 it had the same characteristics as
[46:22] the Dark Ages would have six hundred to
[46:25] a thousand years later can everybody see
[46:27] that by God's grace now this is what was
[46:30] happening spiritually and physically in
[46:32] the Roman Catholic Church during that
[46:34] time and of course all their daughter
[46:36] churches now let's fight off on those of
[46:39] these words you know are pretty pretty
[46:41] awful but that's history that we just
[46:44] have to kind of have to understand that
[46:48] and you have to say thank God for His
[46:50] grace that we can live above that amen
[46:52] thank God for grace now the age and the
[46:55] messenger you're probably familiar with
[46:57] this the age course I hear interchange
[47:00] with that the messenger was Columba
[47:02] remember the least amount of life was
[47:04] during this time because the Koroma
[47:06] Catholic Church had power the history
[47:08] says they try to destroy all the Bible's
[47:10] they try to take all the Bible's away
[47:12] from the people and they try to keep
[47:15] such control over it again as we talked
[47:18] about we'll get into the we'll get into
[47:20] the indulgences is that everything they
[47:22] try to do to pervert the Word of God and
[47:24] they have control over the people that's
[47:27] a picture of Columba there now what's
[47:29] interesting as I said what's interesting
[47:31] about this age is that there was so dark
[47:35] the messenger wasn't even born during
[47:38] the age he was before the age so if you
[47:41] look it up in history Columba lived from
[47:45] right here he lived from 521 to 596 so
[47:48] he died 10 years before the age actually
[47:51] started because it was such a dark age
[47:53] let the random search history and he
[47:56] could find nobody in this age that had
[47:58] signs wonders and miracles and the Holy
[48:00] Ghost and stayed away from organization
[48:03] this is the closest man to the age I
[48:05] want you to know this man did a powerful
[48:07] thing he was a mighty missionary full of
[48:11] the Holy Ghost and so what I'm saying is
[48:14] that even though he didn't live in the
[48:15] age the effects of his ministry went for
[48:18] the entire nine hundred years because of
[48:21] the kind of servant of God that he was I
[48:23] don't have all the history on here but
[48:26] one of the things I don't have on here
[48:27] this is how he this is how he converted
[48:29] the whole country of Scotland can you
[48:31] imagine converting a whole country
[48:34] that's what he did here's how I did it
[48:36] he would he would pray and God would
[48:38] anoint him and twelve other men and him
[48:41] in the twelve men would go into an area
[48:42] and they would just start a city and
[48:45] people you know people are out in the
[48:47] remote areas would come to the city and
[48:49] the whole city would be Christians then
[48:51] with Holy Ghost and then the heathens
[48:54] would come in and see the city and feel
[48:55] the love and people getting converted
[48:57] every signs miracles wonders
[48:59] and that's how he did it he would go
[49:02] then he'd go to be pray and get twelve
[49:03] more believers go to the next place
[49:05] twelve more and keep spreading the
[49:07] gospel and he was a mighty missionary
[49:09] and that was his main missionary
[49:11] technique game that he's to do a church
[49:14] play you would go there plant a church
[49:17] and build the city around a bunch of
[49:19] Christians they met and God blessed it
[49:22] abundantly rich
[49:23] usually so much so that he's even in
[49:26] Britannica he's known this is they
[49:29] didn't say nothing about his miracles in
[49:30] Britannica like they did Martin Martin
[49:32] was even listed some of the miracles
[49:34] it's the Martin's life in the projector
[49:36] but this is all said basically the
[49:39] missionary traditionally credited with
[49:40] the main role in conversion of Scotland
[49:42] to Christiana the whole whole country
[49:45] which is quite amazing
[49:47] here's oh brother madam says about 60
[49:50] years after the death of st. Patrick
[49:51] Columbo was born in North Ireland to the
[49:54] royal family of Fergus he became a
[49:57] brilliant consecrated scholar committing
[49:59] to memory
[50:00] most of the scriptures imagine that
[50:02] memorizing most of the body God hauled
[50:05] him in the audible voice of the omission
[50:06] area after he had heard the voice of God
[50:10] nothing could stop them you like that
[50:12] amen oh I've served my heart they met
[50:15] once you heard the voice of God hell is
[50:17] going to talk to you either
[50:18] praise God nothing will stop you and God
[50:21] answers your prayer like for me I like
[50:23] sides you'll God get me a cider
[50:25] there's my sign right there ah you know
[50:29] when God gives you a side nothing can
[50:31] stop you after that Hey praise God when
[50:33] I ask God but add my scotch I be a
[50:35] preacher now I want to share this for
[50:36] you guys no I said God give me a side I
[50:39] prayed a passage I went to church
[50:41] preached at Lima and God gave me a
[50:43] tongue and interpretation before I do
[50:46] priests and then God built the altar
[50:48] afterwards I'd have to die anymore God
[50:50] and answer my prayer so I don't doubt
[50:53] anymore I preach and I don't doubt
[50:55] should I give it up I don't doubt
[50:57] because he already spoke to the priest
[50:58] God after I seen got into my prayer we
[51:02] should not doubt anymore you and I
[51:03] should not doubt once God proves his
[51:05] will to us he met his miraculous
[51:08] ministry has caused many historic
[51:11] stories to claim him next to the
[51:13] Apostles just like Martin Martin Columbo
[51:15] were some of the most highly revered men
[51:19] of God throughout the entire 2,000 year
[51:21] church changes so break was his ministry
[51:24] with a supernatural size following that
[51:26] some have thought the accounts were
[51:28] exaggerated because they were so
[51:30] supernatural here's one story he
[51:32] approached the walled city from the
[51:34] gates barred against him he lifted the
[51:36] voice
[51:36] prayer that God intervened a lot of
[51:38] access to people in order to preach as
[51:40] he prayed the court magicians began to
[51:43] harass him with loud noises then he
[51:45] began to sing a song as he said God so
[51:48] increased the volume of his voice that
[51:50] he drowned out the cries of the heathen
[51:52] suddenly the gates burst open on their
[51:54] own accord he entered in and preached
[51:56] the gospel when he met you through the
[51:58] lawyer
[51:58] that's not that's that's just like the
[52:00] Bible member Peter got an escort right
[52:03] out of jail and the doors just flew open
[52:04] that's my Bible that's he was living in
[52:08] Bible days we're living in Bible days
[52:10] that's not hard to be that's what the
[52:12] Bible says even a god is that for Peter
[52:14] not that it for Joshua you know the
[52:17] walls of Jericho God can do anything he
[52:21] another occasion when he was also shot
[52:23] from a village as he turned awaited a
[52:25] part of the son of a chief suddenly
[52:27] became violently ill even unto death
[52:28] Saint Columba was quickly sought after
[52:31] and recalled when he prayed the prayer
[52:33] of faith the boy was instantly healed
[52:35] the village was then open to evangelism
[52:38] by the gospel he pen those are the two
[52:41] stories by the RAM puts in the church
[52:43] age book so powerful stories a bed the
[52:46] man which is a missionary minded and a
[52:49] true servant of the Lord now we'll get
[52:51] into a few slides on the citation it's a
[52:54] verse 18 so let's go into that by God's
[52:56] grace I just I'll probably just have
[52:59] time for the salutations and I pardon
[53:00] I'll get my watch here okay let me set
[53:05] the timer just real quick here by God's
[53:07] grace I don't wanna go over to month and
[53:12] I do that is because I get so worn out
[53:14] you know I gotta watch myself here okay
[53:17] the revelation I'm sorry let's read a
[53:19] these things say for some of God who
[53:22] have his eyes like a flame of fire and
[53:24] his feet are like fine brass remember
[53:27] perhaps that Jesus always introduced him
[53:29] to the age with his deity so this is
[53:31] something only deity can do only the DD
[53:34] can only be the Son of God the deity has
[53:36] only one who has eyes like in the flame
[53:38] of fire and deities as feet that are
[53:41] like fine brass
[53:42] the head this Josie is deity he is God
[53:46] the revelation of Godhead to the father
[53:49] to your age
[53:50] is that Jesus is the Son of God once in
[53:53] the days of his flesh he was known as to
[53:55] some man but henceforth we know him no
[53:58] more after the flesh
[53:59] he's no longer the son of man the great
[54:02] prophet who hid himself gathered
[54:04] together all prophecies and that's what
[54:07] the Bible said from henceforth we know
[54:10] no man after the flesh egg though we
[54:12] have known Christ after the flesh yet
[54:14] now henceforth know we him no more so
[54:18] how do we know now we know by the Holy
[54:19] Spirit that's why it's so critical to be
[54:22] able to hear the voice of God in every
[54:25] age what does he say he that knows of
[54:27] the the face of the son of man he that
[54:29] had to hear that in here with the spirit
[54:31] say to the churches because now he's in
[54:34] spirit form amen we don't know about
[54:36] their flesh like open it here see the
[54:38] nail scars in my hand see I'm the son of
[54:40] God that's not how he works he works by
[54:43] can you hear what the spirits trying to
[54:44] tell you man that's how he works out we
[54:47] don't know it after flesh body we know
[54:49] him after the Holy Spirit and memorize
[54:52] you hear the voice of God it was that
[54:53] still small voice when he got alone in
[54:56] his prayer closet the still small boy
[54:58] spoke to him God help us to get the
[55:00] prayer closet amen to hear the voice of
[55:03] God the only thing I miss back in the
[55:07] bosom of the Father
[55:07] that's where Christ is now he's in the
[55:09] bosom or heart of the Father remember
[55:11] he's in father's invisible now we know
[55:14] if F if not we known after the parvis
[55:16] resurrection he is risen and has taken
[55:19] unto himself his mighty power and his
[55:22] above all and over all to the praise of
[55:25] his own glory his glory he will not
[55:27] share with another his leadership over
[55:29] the church he will not surrender to any
[55:31] man glory he looks down upon Thyatira
[55:35] and here he sees in that city and in
[55:38] that port age the honor which belongs to
[55:41] him only bestowed upon another so see
[55:45] this is why he has eyes like fire
[55:47] because he's looking now a fighter tear
[55:49] and they're given all the praise to a
[55:50] pope
[55:51] that's why the Bible City is looking
[55:53] down with eyes a fighter
[55:55] his eyes blazed with the fire of Wrath
[55:58] and judgment as he sees Apollo revered
[56:02] as the
[56:03] God when he alone is the only begotten
[56:06] son of the Father and they replace the
[56:08] son of God with Apollo right but later
[56:11] you see the next slide he talks about
[56:12] how the Pope took the place of Apollo
[56:14] eventually how awful must is judgment
[56:18] upon the religion of the fire to an age
[56:21] where in the church members like the
[56:23] pagan worshippers of the son of god
[56:25] Apollo the son of Zeus elevate a human
[56:28] ruler to adoration backed by the power
[56:31] of the state for that is exactly what he
[56:33] saw so now we know why he's looking with
[56:35] eyes afire because the age has replaced
[56:38] the son of God with the son of Zeus he
[56:41] says the Roman Catholic Church fully
[56:43] immersed in idol worship based upon the
[56:46] rights of the Sun God of autumn had
[56:48] elevated a man to actual deity the Pope
[56:52] through the marriage of the church to
[56:54] the state for Thomas Aquinas and alvrez
[56:58] of Elijah's formulated and say to them
[57:02] here's what they said these famous
[57:03] church fathers apparently but they're
[57:06] not our Father or not not our father's
[57:09] mother gravely was able to be our Father
[57:10] in the gospel right I mean no Paul was
[57:12] the father of the gospel I was saying he
[57:14] said you have many teachers but not many
[57:16] fathers so we have a father the bacons
[57:19] brother branham but we don't walk around
[57:21] saying father grandfather grandfather
[57:23] random because jesus said call no man
[57:25] father you see that okay so see we have
[57:29] a right to look back and say okay here's
[57:31] a father of our faith for our church age
[57:33] but we don't have a right to sit there
[57:35] call father father father because that's
[57:37] blessed right what's blasphemy speaking
[57:42] evil God because what do they call the
[57:44] Pope now Holy Father
[57:46] Obama's called him that trumps call him
[57:48] that hillary clinton's calling that what
[57:50] are they doing they're worshipping a man
[57:52] right and they're guilty of blasphemy
[57:55] that's exactly right because says jesus
[57:58] holy fathers only the one time in the
[58:00] Bible as when Jesus was praying to God
[58:02] amen he said Holy Father keep them
[58:05] through thy day who got a skip in need
[58:08] praise God how many we got we call no
[58:10] man father mother father grandma father
[58:13] Jesse Fi
[58:14] rooks or father other viewer or father
[58:17] can read oh yeah we don't do that but we
[58:20] can look back and say that man was the
[58:22] father of the word for our debt that's
[58:25] right and I can prove that my Bible amen
[58:28] so here's what they say the Pope seems
[58:31] to be those who view him with the
[58:33] spiritual eye to be not a man but a God
[58:37] there are no bounce was authority he can
[58:40] declare to be right what he will and can
[58:42] take away from any of their rights as he
[58:44] sees fit to thou this universal power
[58:46] leads to being shut out from salvation
[58:48] the great enemies of the church are the
[58:51] heretics who will not wear the yoke of
[58:53] true obedience look at that so they're
[58:56] looking up on these worshippers of the
[58:57] Pope and they're saying they've
[58:59] exhausted this man to a god but don't
[59:02] just get down in the Catholic Church
[59:03] people worship brother Branham today -
[59:05] yep they'll take his word over the body
[59:08] if there's any disagreement they'll
[59:10] baptize it is vain no get upset if you
[59:14] call brother Brandon oh man but if you
[59:15] call Jesus demands they don't they don't
[59:17] mine that see that that's true you call
[59:20] brother graph just a man will get upset
[59:22] with you what do you say Jesus was a man
[59:24] don't say that's okay in that a shame
[59:28] see because they just love they always
[59:30] say this and be careful what they say
[59:31] they say I don't worship brother Brando
[59:34] but I worship the God inside of him but
[59:36] be careful with that at some point ever
[59:38] I hear that it just doesn't sound right
[59:41] because I don't worship
[59:43] I don't worship any person I never think
[59:46] of a person - oh the God has taught you
[59:48] is God my worship I always look at
[59:50] worship as something outside of the men
[59:52] worship should be separated from a man
[59:54] now is the God was God in brother Graham
[59:57] guest was God in st. Paul yes but we
[1:00:00] worship God alone and we must totally
[1:00:02] separate that from a man never you
[1:00:05] misery understand that by God's grace so
[1:00:08] I just don't like that statement I've
[1:00:09] heard that statement many times well I
[1:00:11] don't worship brother Brandon I worship
[1:00:13] the god inside and that's true but we
[1:00:16] got to be careful how we say that - amen
[1:00:17] because it's just getting closer and
[1:00:19] closer to worshiping brother Branham and
[1:00:22] we want to try to stay far away from
[1:00:23] that okay now here's what the program
[1:00:26] says he quotes first Timothy 2
[1:00:28] I there's one meter between God and man
[1:00:30] the man Christ Jesus the Son of God
[1:00:33] there's only one person that can go
[1:00:35] between you and God and that's Christ
[1:00:38] he's God but the Pope of Rome has
[1:00:41] changed the word he made it he changed
[1:00:43] the Bibles in 1 meter between God and
[1:00:45] man not men so now he he dates between
[1:00:50] the mediator and then so they've got to
[1:00:52] make it say God and man which means that
[1:00:54] man means the Pope that's what they're
[1:00:56] trying to say so now he mediates between
[1:00:58] the mediator men but there's no other
[1:01:00] mediators
[1:01:01] save the son and I remember what they
[1:01:03] caught Mary the mediators I got the book
[1:01:06] I can show it to you they called Mary
[1:01:08] the media tricks and that totally blast
[1:01:11] seems that scripture right there
[1:01:12] that's right if you really get down to
[1:01:15] some of this that faith the faith of the
[1:01:17] Catholic Church it is rotten to the core
[1:01:20] like a brother I would say it's tommyrot
[1:01:23] right as at is rotten to the core
[1:01:26] because they ascribe deity to Mary and
[1:01:29] every picture you ever see it every
[1:01:31] picture with Mary it's always Mary the
[1:01:34] one who's in control
[1:01:35] it's always very the one who's glorified
[1:01:37] it's always a dying Jesus and a powerful
[1:01:39] mayor it's always powerful Mary and a
[1:01:41] little innocent little baby right and
[1:01:44] the church said what is that that always
[1:01:47] how it is
[1:01:48] Mary's exalted the strong one and that's
[1:01:51] what the that's what their book says
[1:01:52] every prayer they said we run to Mary
[1:01:55] the mother of God that's what their book
[1:01:57] says I can prove to you I put all the
[1:02:00] videos I have three videos on mystery
[1:02:01] mystery babble of white stones and
[1:02:03] you'll see it I can quote it right from
[1:02:05] the book the Catechism of the Catholic
[1:02:07] Church the CCC all right now he says the
[1:02:12] Pope announces salvation through the
[1:02:15] Church of Rome but there is no salvation
[1:02:17] except to the Son of God
[1:02:18] no wonder the eyes glazed in fiery
[1:02:21] judgment
[1:02:22] no wonder the feet are like fine brass
[1:02:24] as he stands ready to trample into
[1:02:27] powder and dust the wicked kings of the
[1:02:30] world ah kingdoms of this world he said
[1:02:33] but thank God for those strong feet of
[1:02:35] rats so the feet of brass mean
[1:02:37] destruction for them but here's what
[1:02:39] they need for us they have passed
[1:02:41] the judgment for us hey good idea to the
[1:02:45] beeping two different things either
[1:02:47] they're going to trample upon the
[1:02:48] unbeliever or its Christ hearty trampled
[1:02:51] over judgment for you and I praise God
[1:02:54] they are now our foundation so see his
[1:02:58] feet are our foundation for what he gave
[1:03:02] is ours amen
[1:03:04] we said identified in him Jesus the Son
[1:03:07] of God
[1:03:07] now notice here's where I brought this
[1:03:09] up it was in this fireteam in church age
[1:03:12] that we witnessed the rise of Mohammed
[1:03:15] ISM that denied the Son of God in that
[1:03:18] beautiful but but impulses out of
[1:03:20] history Muslims believe in Jesus but
[1:03:24] they don't believe it was the son of gun
[1:03:26] they'll call him a prophet you're
[1:03:28] talking they'll call the Prophet I've
[1:03:29] had Muslims on my youtube videos writing
[1:03:32] and so all this was great Jesus was a
[1:03:33] great prophet we should dress modestly
[1:03:35] all these things but they don't believe
[1:03:37] he's the son of God see that and this a
[1:03:41] Jesus says I am the son of God right
[1:03:44] that's why I'm soaked up with this age
[1:03:47] it exalts men it makes somebody else's
[1:03:49] son of God but Christ is the son of God
[1:03:51] and in this age Mohammedanism which we
[1:03:54] call the Muslim religion deny the Son of
[1:03:56] God and determine death upon all those
[1:03:59] who call themselves Christians that's
[1:04:02] right I remember there's only one
[1:04:04] Kingdom at the a member Daniels vision
[1:04:05] of the kingdoms there's only one Kingdom
[1:04:07] the IRA kingdom is the spirit of Rome
[1:04:09] that's why I said earlier the spirit of
[1:04:11] Rome yes is the Roman Catholic Church
[1:04:12] it's also in Protestants that deny the
[1:04:15] word and it's also in the Muslim faith
[1:04:17] because it's destroying people with
[1:04:19] power blooded murder it's exactly right
[1:04:22] it's awful to say but that's exactly
[1:04:23] what the history shows right surely this
[1:04:30] age must repent or lose all their stands
[1:04:33] the Lord of glory God very God his word
[1:04:36] is cast aside his person is rejected but
[1:04:40] human hands and human hearts cannot
[1:04:42] dispose him let them deny him yet he
[1:04:45] remained faithful fear not little flock
[1:04:48] it is your father's good pleasure to
[1:04:51] give you the kingdom and when I come
[1:04:53] with feet of brass a flaming
[1:04:54] eyes I will recompense reap a judgement
[1:04:58] is mine I will repay saith the Lord
[1:05:01] praise God this is what he's telling
[1:05:03] them be strong he said I work pay you
[1:05:06] just lived a life you just be the
[1:05:08] shining light and I'll repay with my
[1:05:10] eyes a fire at my feet of brass
[1:05:12] hey now let me bring a little
[1:05:14] encouragement when I read that this week
[1:05:16] now I'm finished with the whole chapter
[1:05:17] but to the whole chapter this is a whole
[1:05:19] sermon when I read that this morning I
[1:05:21] was just really inspired by that on the
[1:05:23] little clock so I want to just encourage
[1:05:26] the little clock a little bit
[1:05:27] anybody's any couraging tonight I could
[1:05:30] use some encouragement by God's grace
[1:05:31] and the Holy Spirit brings it
[1:05:33] encouragement welcome Adam says those
[1:05:36] discouraging times comes to every
[1:05:39] believer so if you haven't been
[1:05:40] discouraged well you're going to bite it
[1:05:42] bite it sometime and it comes to test
[1:05:47] you and to try you and to see if you
[1:05:51] really do believe every son that cometh
[1:05:55] to God must first be tested
[1:05:57] child training as he herceptin 12 amen
[1:06:01] every son must be tried in other words
[1:06:05] every son must face discouragement and
[1:06:07] defeated by the Word of God now I just
[1:06:11] want to tell a little story
[1:06:12] we had good services on Sunday with both
[1:06:14] sides and he preached a fantastic
[1:06:17] tremendous messages but I woke up on
[1:06:19] Monday morning feeling lower than a
[1:06:21] snake's belly I'll say like that I was
[1:06:23] so discouraged I was I know just I think
[1:06:26] I was because I'm so tired
[1:06:27] I'm just worn out I just knows I felt
[1:06:30] like I was just had no energy I woke up
[1:06:32] Monday morning just feeling so
[1:06:34] discouraged I went in the prayer closet
[1:06:36] and as I started praying God's hard
[1:06:38] incursion God's my witness that morning
[1:06:41] as I left for work I was so happy I woke
[1:06:45] up in the depths of discouragement in
[1:06:47] the depths of doubt and and I just got
[1:06:50] the prayer closet so I read it to finish
[1:06:52] the church age book and I left work and
[1:06:54] I was like own cloud 9
[1:06:55] amen but what happened was I was
[1:07:00] discouraged you know because our church
[1:07:01] seems to be getting smaller and smaller
[1:07:03] and smaller
[1:07:05] and that's okay because really those who
[1:07:08] will be here are the elect of God a man
[1:07:10] those who want to stay but of course if
[1:07:13] you're called another church praise God
[1:07:14] but those who fall away and can be
[1:07:17] fought away it shows that they can need
[1:07:19] a see but the elect that stay around and
[1:07:22] can never be to see and so I was it is
[1:07:25] discouraged I think about mine so I'll
[1:07:27] talk about assignment you know how
[1:07:29] things have been discouraging for me
[1:07:30] lately and try and I'm just giving my
[1:07:32] everything I can give to the password
[1:07:35] and helping people and just discourage
[1:07:37] but then I remember to this quote
[1:07:40] brother Branham said that Satan attacks
[1:07:42] you when you're tired so be careful just
[1:07:45] for future reference next time you get
[1:07:47] tired you can expect Satan to come
[1:07:50] around so let's just this close for
[1:07:52] perfect baby okay I said now many of you
[1:07:54] be waiting over to the morning to stop
[1:07:56] out on a Sunday night service and that's
[1:07:59] kind of long distance to go I appreciate
[1:08:00] that effort some of you will drive home
[1:08:02] tonight because you got to go to work by
[1:08:04] daylight in the morning and I know it's
[1:08:05] hard and then what I think when I see
[1:08:08] that he's going to tell a little story
[1:08:10] here about how Satan tries to make him
[1:08:14] feel bad he said that I get spells to
[1:08:17] you now I get moody Siebel Brown wasn't
[1:08:21] God he was a man he got moody sometimes
[1:08:24] he'd say things right sometimes anything
[1:08:26] wrong I found a quote where brother Ram
[1:08:28] said he got sick and he could have
[1:08:31] preached some meetings and went to
[1:08:32] meetings and meet up I wonder since I'm
[1:08:35] sick I missed the meetings I can't
[1:08:36] preach him I wonder if God's even called
[1:08:38] me to preach he was so discouraged just
[1:08:41] because he got sick and he's missing
[1:08:44] meetings he was even doubting whether he
[1:08:46] should preach you know me too said to
[1:08:47] him he said you he says Billy you ought
[1:08:51] to be ashamed of yourself
[1:08:53] not about if RI said that to us brothers
[1:08:57] but he said you're right neither I can
[1:09:00] show you the mote if you wanted me to
[1:09:01] pull it up after service
[1:09:03] she says bill you ought to be ashamed of
[1:09:05] yourself see look out look how we can
[1:09:10] get so discouraged right we can even
[1:09:12] doubt if we're a Christian sometimes the
[1:09:14] church said
[1:09:15] then a prophet of God can wonders am I
[1:09:18] even a prophet should I'm going to be
[1:09:20] preaching it all all because we get
[1:09:22] tired or sick or get discouraged that
[1:09:24] don't mean up it your feelings don't
[1:09:26] mean nothing it's what God's Word say
[1:09:28] man stay with what the word says Amen
[1:09:31] your feelings will almost always lie to
[1:09:33] you but God's Word will never lie to you
[1:09:37] the best I get spells Doggett nu T I get
[1:09:40] a spot where what gets me so remember
[1:09:42] it's very personal here what struggles
[1:09:44] brother Graham is where I get those
[1:09:47] spells when I get all overworked trying
[1:09:50] to do too much any brothers or sisters
[1:09:53] ever start with that try to do too much
[1:09:55] you should have sat down and took a
[1:09:56] little nap where you should have rested
[1:09:57] a little bit on your day off but you try
[1:10:00] to work and press through it overwork
[1:10:02] yourself the RAM so that's when he got
[1:10:04] Moody and if Satan comes telling the
[1:10:07] same come during his overworked tired
[1:10:10] times that's what I was experience on
[1:10:12] Monday morning just two days ago and he
[1:10:15] says why nobody cares
[1:10:19] you haven't really got a friend in the
[1:10:21] world
[1:10:22] for the RAM at that interesting we get
[1:10:25] to see into the thought battles than my
[1:10:27] battles of a prophet of God a man that
[1:10:30] traveled the world seven times saw
[1:10:32] visions all the time and he admits when
[1:10:35] I get my battles Satan comes from you
[1:10:37] and I'm tired and said you're having
[1:10:39] friends yeah nobody really likes you
[1:10:43] that's a net you don't have a friend in
[1:10:47] the world you're not doing nothing for
[1:10:50] the kingdom of God brother Brennan said
[1:10:53] Rep remember I'm not immune to the
[1:10:56] temptation everybody's going to be
[1:10:58] tempted see I got to overcome that then
[1:11:03] when I look back and see something like
[1:11:05] this he's talking about other people
[1:11:07] will come to Sunday morning and Sunday
[1:11:08] night and then travel hours to go into
[1:11:11] work the next day he says I put it right
[1:11:15] back in the devil's face and say what
[1:11:17] about that ha ha ha he said that helps
[1:11:20] me to overcome devil what about that he
[1:11:24] say he said nobody loves you you don't
[1:11:26] have any friends
[1:11:27] everybody has to look at all these
[1:11:28] friends that will stay late on a Sunday
[1:11:30] night and drive home tired just because
[1:11:33] they want to hear the word look at all
[1:11:35] my friends that will take that a man I'm
[1:11:38] glad you got by God's grace I thought
[1:11:40] that sounds so beautiful you see what
[1:11:42] Satan comes at first telling you a lie
[1:11:45] speak something back to and tell him why
[1:11:47] he's wrong will you do that that'll help
[1:11:50] you in your walk with God
[1:11:51] if you speak back something and tell of
[1:11:54] what happened or tell him all about it
[1:11:56] how Olivia amen and now I was listening
[1:12:01] today and here's what he says at the end
[1:12:02] of the sermon here he said oh but uh

[1:12:07] who promised isn't it wonderful to be a
[1:12:10] servant of Christ all the things that he

[1:14:02] belly I was so tired or worn out had all
[1:14:04] these my best nothing's going good the
[1:14:07] church isn't grow not leasing out faster
[1:14:09] battle that God don't care about numbers
[1:14:11] God cares about faith thing but see as a
[1:14:14] pastor that's not that's my battle you
[1:14:15] might have not had that battle but when
[1:14:18] I get over stressing over that's the
[1:14:20] battle Oh big mistake when was last time
[1:14:23] you want to solve oh look at these
[1:14:25] families that left it's because of you

[1:14:32] should have did this and see how I get
[1:14:33] my battles to when I get tired but
[1:14:34] here's what happened I started praying
[1:14:37] and all of a sudden like this thought
[1:14:38] came out of heaven but they a minute
[1:14:40] laure and it thought and it come down to
[1:14:43] me and it came like this he said
[1:14:45] something along these lines I thought
[1:14:46] this end you're the only one standing
[1:14:49] for the message in all of the Akron
[1:14:51] Summit County something came to me and
[1:14:53] just Church and just draw such a source
[1:14:55] of encourage I felt like I could stand
[1:14:56] up it might be a man again I just felt
[1:14:59] like courage and in my heart like you're
[1:15:02] the only one your coach is the only one
[1:15:04] standing in this entire county and then
[1:15:08] I started saying you know what I'm going
[1:15:09] to go on Google Maps and I want to
[1:15:12] encourage myself I want to see where the
[1:15:14] nearest churches are so I just wanted to
[1:15:16] see it so to the North the nearest

[1:18:27] church down here in West Virginia and so
[1:18:30] forth but church where just a little
[1:18:31] flock there's a little flock Jesus said
[1:18:34] few there be that find aren't you glad
[1:18:36] you found Edina now both of these quotes
[1:18:39] do to encourage us and also you know to
[1:18:41] kind of help us to focus because I want
[1:18:44] to think about doing some short or some
[1:18:46] a local missionary work like for example
[1:18:49] brother works that will go out to the
[1:18:50] park and sing and pass out things we've
[1:18:52] had a few people come to church because
[1:18:54] of that now to me it's been worth it
[1:18:56] it's worth it if somebody just gets to
[1:18:58] come in here the Word of God it's worth
[1:19:00] it I'd like to do maybe some of that
[1:19:02] this summer I want to pray about it
[1:19:03] tonight before we close you join with me
[1:19:05] and pray with me about doing some local
[1:19:08] ministries look at the church all these
[1:19:10] looking authors nope there's no churches
[1:19:12] in none nobody look there's nobody
[1:19:15] standing for the truth that I know
[1:19:17] except us so we can't say well we don't
[1:19:20] have a missionary field we do have a
[1:19:21] missionary field there's a lot of lot of
[1:19:24] room you know there's different ways you
[1:19:25] can different ways that you can approach
[1:19:27] that but let me just read a few quotes
[1:19:29] and hope this will help us tonight by
[1:19:30] God's grace so there's local missionary
[1:19:33] work and then there's continental
[1:19:35] missionary work we can do even in the US
[1:19:37] and I know the u.s. church program said
[1:19:39] this he said there's very few believers
[1:19:40] United States because it's already been
[1:19:42] preached the preachers have already gone
[1:19:44] through the harvest and pulled out the
[1:19:45] harvest I understand that but what if
[1:19:48] nobody would have come told you and I
[1:19:49] got it
[1:19:50] so we need we need somebody that told us
[1:19:53] we need to do the same thing we did tell
[1:19:55] somebody about it man so I'm first I'm
[1:19:58] the one that needs to do more of that
[1:20:00] like I said I'm trying to fight one
[1:20:01] person to a church a week I missed last
[1:20:03] week I can still do it this weekend
[1:20:05] ahead did the week before I missed last
[1:20:07] week I still want to do that I want to
[1:20:09] have it on my heart money to invite
[1:20:11] somebody to come to the house of God so
[1:20:14] here's a quote now look at this
[1:20:15] but I'm suppose the people at Tempe
[1:20:17] Arizona do you realize that the
[1:20:19] responsibility of the City of Tempe here
[1:20:22] I believe is resting upon your shoulders
[1:20:25] and money
[1:20:27] that's heavy what about accurate the
[1:20:30] responsibility of the people is on us I
[1:20:32] believe that God is making lighthouses
[1:20:35] each one of you you have the
[1:20:37] responsibility that's into the city is
[1:20:39] resting upon ministers upon the church
[1:20:42] people the pilgrims as we're turning
[1:20:44] threes that don't you believe that what
[1:20:49] you're not afraid
[1:20:51] surely you're not afraid to take God at
[1:20:53] His Word God keeps is where God is not a
[1:20:55] God to say that he's one thing and then
[1:20:57] another see if he promises anything that
[1:20:59] he will do God keeps his word believe
[1:21:01] that he goes on to talk about how the
[1:21:04] church needs to pray for the baptism of
[1:21:06] the holy ghost and that will set the
[1:21:07] church on fire and that's what we need
[1:21:09] to do Jim a nice guy snow Graham said I
[1:21:11] can accomplish more with five people
[1:21:13] with the Backson Holy Ghost than 5000 in
[1:21:16] a church instead I can show you that
[1:21:19] quote he said give me five people fill
[1:21:21] with all the ghosts he said we can turn
[1:21:22] a city upside down remember you might
[1:21:25] just get five more souls to turn the
[1:21:26] city upside down that's like the book of
[1:21:29] Acts - the emphasis was turned upside
[1:21:31] down twelve believers a net filled with
[1:21:34] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:21:36] that's right where we preach on Chicago
[1:21:38] recently member preached on Chicago on a
[1:21:39] Sunday night the shaking of Chicago
[1:21:42] remember that the pastor pray for
[1:21:44] shaking and he left he got kicked out
[1:21:45] and brother Matt peace at all
[1:21:47] I wish Chicago is shaken and he said
[1:21:48] brother I forget in 1200 I forget his
[1:21:51] name whatever was he said your prayers
[1:21:53] already been answered all of those
[1:21:55] believers that got saved that little
[1:21:57] group that was the shaking of Chicago so
[1:22:00] see that's what I said after might are
[1:22:02] to be shaken but if it's not let's ask
[1:22:04] God to shake it one more time and if
[1:22:07] we're doing missionary work that we
[1:22:08] believe God would bless if we pray
[1:22:10] beforehand you see how it's going to get
[1:22:13] focused on that because I get
[1:22:14] discouraged I got a tell the devil
[1:22:16] double your life we're the little flock
[1:22:19] we're the only one standing uh i
[1:22:22] planting on water but God must give the
[1:22:25] increase
[1:22:26] I can't give an increase of the seat I
[1:22:28] just planet I just water that's all I
[1:22:30] can do
[1:22:30] God's got to give it light so I say God
[1:22:32] bring more light admit your will praise
[1:22:34] God
[1:22:36] but instead it goes on to another quote
[1:22:38] here this is a different quotation and
[1:22:40] it has two parts oops this is the
[1:22:41] beginning to give you the background
[1:22:42] order if we believe the coming of the
[1:22:45] Messiah ends and we believe that the
[1:22:46] crisis ended come soon I think we ought
[1:22:48] to lay aside everything else and be
[1:22:50] concerned of getting this message to the
[1:22:52] lands calendar as fast as you can do it
[1:22:53] that's right if we are convinced but we
[1:22:57] preach that there's coming a messiah i
[1:22:59] want to put a hundred million dollars in
[1:23:01] a building if the messiah is coming what
[1:23:05] goods that going to do any well could be
[1:23:08] a house for the foolish virgin to go
[1:23:10] into but don't you think one hundred
[1:23:13] million dollars could be used better how
[1:23:15] do you remember what mother hen would do
[1:23:16] with a hundred million dollars anybody
[1:23:17] remember i showed you a few months ago
[1:23:19] but man said if we believe it seek our
[1:23:22] testimony our action speaks louder than
[1:23:24] our words if I had a hundred million
[1:23:27] dollars what would I do brother man I
[1:23:29] believe the Messiah's coming I would
[1:23:31] support a missionary program that would
[1:23:34] sweep around the country right quick and
[1:23:36] get a church ready for David in other
[1:23:39] words he would just hold more church
[1:23:41] services if he had a hundred million
[1:23:43] knows that I have we go read he go rent
[1:23:46] out a Chron's theater whatever their big
[1:23:48] building is where Hebron run out the
[1:23:51] rubber ball or he read out the zip
[1:23:53] stadium and he would pack it full of
[1:23:55] preachers that preach the message the
[1:23:57] Ottoman that's what you would do with a
[1:23:59] hundred million dollars other words you
[1:24:02] just hold services so see our outreach
[1:24:05] church just has to be more services but
[1:24:07] invite more people amen
[1:24:09] we can do it by mail we can do it by
[1:24:11] Internet you can buy ads on Facebook so
[1:24:16] we just gotta pray yeah that's what I of
[1:24:19] our new weeks have to pray we have to
[1:24:21] give more people a chance to hear the
[1:24:22] word of God and even if they're just a
[1:24:25] lot foolish version at least you reach
[1:24:27] somebody and don't get me wrong we guess
[1:24:31] we get missionary offerings my brother
[1:24:32] Jason comes in brother Ben Ben narada's
[1:24:35] evangelistic
[1:24:36] missionary type of work we do give them
[1:24:38] offerings they got for that but if we
[1:24:41] want to burden if we remember the burden
[1:24:43] of accurate all this area is upon us
[1:24:46] we've got aside crotchet abominations
[1:24:48] and then go out to the highways and
[1:24:50] hedges and brother brandon said this is
[1:24:53] all you they didn't just have to have
[1:24:55] special meetings and invite people to
[1:24:57] come and if people get an invitation
[1:25:00] don't go it's on then then it's on then
[1:25:03] it's not on us because we offer the
[1:25:04] gospel now this is the 1964 the next
[1:25:09] quote in Beaumont Texas
[1:25:11] he says I'm grateful to brother very
[1:25:13] green and to those brethren here that's
[1:25:15] for their efforts to make this meaning
[1:25:17] of success if there's anybody lost in
[1:25:21] this city in this generation it
[1:25:24] certainly won't be upon them fellows
[1:25:26] because they have heard every stone to
[1:25:29] try to make it a success now how do they
[1:25:32] do this how did they turn every stone in
[1:25:34] the city and try to find a safe person
[1:25:36] here's what they did they were feeding
[1:25:38] the people that came to their services
[1:25:40] they were getting them places to sleep
[1:25:43] hotels people's houses advertised on
[1:25:47] television everywhere just taking the
[1:25:51] money right out of their own pockets and
[1:25:53] placing it out they know that the crowds
[1:25:55] that we have wouldn't be able to support
[1:25:57] such as that so they took it are their
[1:25:59] old pockets to do it that's all they did
[1:26:04] also he was hold special being so for
[1:26:06] example here we have brother Brooks
[1:26:07] coming in Sunday if we invite equal to
[1:26:10] that then we're trying to a missionary
[1:26:12] our work praise God
[1:26:14] but let's say the Sun let's say we get
[1:26:16] so on our hearts of might you know
[1:26:17] somebody else and have some special
[1:26:20] meetings what we need to do is do this
[1:26:22] and by everybody we can come everybody
[1:26:24] that we can to come to the meetings and
[1:26:26] ask God to save souls
[1:26:27] that's missionary work how many believe
[1:26:31] that we can be a missionary right here
[1:26:35] now here's the next quote the very next
[1:26:37] paragraph as he's talking up to these
[1:26:40] men that have taken money out for food
[1:26:42] hotels advertising programs I think
[1:26:46] that's wonderful like somebody with a
[1:26:49] like that that's a vision I have a
[1:26:52] vision I have a direction we're going to
[1:26:54] try to win souls we're going to hold
[1:26:55] special meetings and we're going to pour
[1:26:57] our own money and pay for that so that
[1:26:59] some people can get say Amen romance
[1:27:02] that I believe it was set over there
[1:27:04] Hebrews 11 chapter of whom the world has
[1:27:07] not heard Amen glory the world is not
[1:27:11] worthy of people that were take money
[1:27:13] out of their own pockets and support
[1:27:15] meetings that preach the message of the
[1:27:17] hour and they stick their neck out see
[1:27:22] they were sticking out their necks for
[1:27:23] brother man's ministry we believe he's a
[1:27:25] prophet we believe he's preaching the
[1:27:26] truth and everybody would cut their
[1:27:28] heads off right I'm not fellowshipping
[1:27:29] with you anymore I'm not fellowship with
[1:27:31] you anymore but program said they were
[1:27:32] willing to stick their heads out for the
[1:27:34] ministry amen
[1:27:36] in the time when the ministry is so
[1:27:39] unpopular amongst too many the people
[1:27:42] that should believe like Pentecostals
[1:27:46] how many appreciate that by God amen I
[1:27:49] just want to review that now let me just
[1:27:51] go back to get it now I've gone down to
[1:27:54] the watchword post office and even
[1:27:57] though what did after I said and said
[1:27:59] how much does it cost to bail out an
[1:28:01] invitation a postcard to everybody it's
[1:28:03] like three cents or something like that
[1:28:05] it's pretty gee the most expensive part
[1:28:08] is printing off the invitation on the
[1:28:10] paper right with you want color or
[1:28:13] something like that but it would cause
[1:28:14] think it's like seven hundred eight
[1:28:16] hundred dollars to hit every mailbox
[1:28:17] around this area this area every mailbox
[1:28:20] you can invite every person you can buy
[1:28:24] every business to come to this little
[1:28:26] place and hear the word of God let me
[1:28:28] know that by God's grace so that's a
[1:28:30] mission we should have invite people we
[1:28:34] should pray and say God give a
[1:28:35] sufficient to invite people to come and
[1:28:38] hear the word of God we can put our
[1:28:40] website on there and say come here the
[1:28:42] best of the hour learn about you know
[1:28:44] water baptist learn about the baptism
[1:28:45] only ghost learn about Mystery Babylon I
[1:28:49] cut people to the core but it's the
[1:28:51] truth
[1:28:51] anyhow amen and maybe it's because it's
[1:28:54] God's voice saying come out come out of
[1:28:57] her my people so you don't partake of
[1:28:58] the plagues it's actually love the manna
[1:29:01] members love it's love when you try to
[1:29:03] correct somebody
[1:29:03] call them out and the true church will
[1:29:06] always well try to call people out to
[1:29:08] repentance the true believer so we could
[1:29:12] hit like we spend let's say just give
[1:29:14] you know we can spend $5,000 and
[1:29:16] everybody around maybe a 5-mile radius
[1:29:18] around this church would have an
[1:29:19] invitation to come hear the message of
[1:29:21] the hour that's how you see this but
[1:29:24] remember brother I said God doesn't need
[1:29:26] money to do it
[1:29:27] God just needs a willing heart to do a
[1:29:28] man right God moves by the spirit not by
[1:29:32] money but we all set the balance that
[1:29:34] with those quotes we just read men took
[1:29:37] money out and remember he went a brother
[1:29:39] had meetings somebody had to take
[1:29:40] through the auditorium somebody had to
[1:29:42] pay for something the food and some had
[1:29:43] to pay for the preachers it has to be
[1:29:45] done but you don't depend upon money
[1:29:47] what you need first is this what I need
[1:29:51] what we need is sufficient how can we
[1:29:54] try to be mission in mind how can we try
[1:29:56] to give people an opportunity to be
[1:29:58] saved and that's what we should do first
[1:30:01] find a mission first find out we feel
[1:30:03] light of the Lord and then God will
[1:30:05] provide everything I remember the last
[1:30:07] time I felt the Lord to go to South
[1:30:09] America I was in Walmart I never I don't
[1:30:12] they often forget this and I just
[1:30:14] committed the road road signs to the
[1:30:15] other books okay I'll go with you if you
[1:30:17] let the Lord to go preaching God you
[1:30:18] know we had some great meetings
[1:30:19] everything that I felt god bless it but
[1:30:23] I was sure a thousand I think I was
[1:30:24] $1200 shorter and I was a I was talking
[1:30:28] to a pastor on the phone I was at
[1:30:29] Walmart it's late at night I'm just
[1:30:31] trying to shop throughout no diapers or
[1:30:33] I was not what I was out to hell it was
[1:30:34] like okay you know brother he's the Lord
[1:30:36] yeah I'm just I'm here in Walmart and I
[1:30:38] got this $1,200 debt on my Discover card
[1:30:41] because I don't know how I'm gonna pay
[1:30:42] for this ticket and the brother said
[1:30:45] we've got the talking he said oh yeah
[1:30:47] I'm feeling good to go to South America
[1:30:48] he said I can't go this year brother
[1:30:50] Jesse but do you want to go I'll pay for
[1:30:52] you and church within a few weeks the
[1:30:55] check is in the mail
[1:30:56] and there's my $1,200 I'm not in debt
[1:30:59] anymore but see you had to catch the
[1:31:02] vision first by the leadership verbs now
[1:31:05] that's it
[1:31:05] that's the story of like little little
[1:31:08] trial people might be tested with a
[1:31:11] harder problem that's what I'm saying
[1:31:12] that's a pretty weak try was it very
[1:31:14] hard so some people divided two going
[1:31:17] program white into debt to hold meetings
[1:31:19] but God always provided eventually so my
[1:31:24] test wasn't that hard my test of faith
[1:31:25] was America that must not have very much
[1:31:27] fake because guys I got to give you
[1:31:30] something you can't handle but by God's
[1:31:31] grace one fate to rise so see that's
[1:31:37] just a little thought on a vision but we
[1:31:39] have to find a vision I can't expect
[1:31:41] people that you know aren't really
[1:31:43] compared to our church I can't expect
[1:31:44] them to support it but I should expect
[1:31:46] people that are fully committed to our
[1:31:48] church to try to support something man
[1:31:50] right
[1:31:52] I can free to rebuke about you know
[1:31:54] things in people but a people army you
[1:31:57] can't even get people to repent so hard
[1:31:58] to get people to repent but the ones who
[1:32:00] are truly committed will catch that
[1:32:02] vision and they'll do something about it
[1:32:04] but man said the world is not worthy of
[1:32:07] people like that that will catch a
[1:32:10] mission and try to win souls for the
[1:32:12] kingdom of God so all this came out of
[1:32:14] my mind battle on Monday morning all
[1:32:16] these thoughts are started rushing up
[1:32:17] you're the only one standing keep
[1:32:19] standing God's with you god bless you
[1:32:21] praise God
[1:32:22] okay so I read that last quote yeah I
[1:32:24] got a couple more quotable clothes and I
[1:32:26] got six minutes good phrase the Lord all
[1:32:29] right meetings that he preached that
[1:32:34] whole week in Nike of December of 1960
[1:32:37] he said were to search our hearts and
[1:32:39] that's what I would say isn't every
[1:32:42] service like that don't you want every
[1:32:44] service to be like that or join God not
[1:32:46] to search your heart and let little
[1:32:47] doubt or little fear or little sin
[1:32:50] remain I will got to search my heart
[1:32:51] every service but man says writer these
[1:32:54] meetings are meant for that purpose is
[1:32:56] to search our hearts you said them
[1:32:59] planes a fire of your eyes searched out
[1:33:02] and know the reigns of the heart you
[1:33:03] certainly do father and speak back to us
[1:33:05] and then telling us to make keep
[1:33:07] ourselves ready that the hours arriving
[1:33:10] every service is a search your hard
[1:33:12] service so I want to close with this I
[1:33:15] just give me five more minutes I want to
[1:33:16] close with the statute referred man as
[1:33:18] we search our heart that it's want to go
[1:33:20] this again briefly by God's grace
[1:33:21] because I believe the people that will
[1:33:24] most catch the vision our church are
[1:33:26] those who actually born again only that
[1:33:29] if you're really bored
[1:33:31] again you'll have a vision of reaching
[1:33:34] lost souls but Graham said he said one
[1:33:38] of the evidence of the Holy Ghost is you
[1:33:40] just want to do something for God so bad
[1:33:42] you just can't hardly sit still you just
[1:33:45] want to do something for the kingdom of
[1:33:46] God so my prayer is god I wonder some
[1:33:48] for you give me a vision to do it
[1:33:50] a tan ahead so when it close to this
[1:33:53] because we need to examine ourselves and
[1:33:55] say are we born again if not let's get
[1:33:57] born again if we're born again let's
[1:33:59] catch a vision and then let's do
[1:34:01] something for God amen to put poor our
[1:34:03] resources into something because time is
[1:34:05] short amen
[1:34:07] either our lives are short or the
[1:34:09] company's going to be either one or the
[1:34:10] other either we're going to live our
[1:34:12] lives appreciate it's going to be over
[1:34:13] and die and go to the sixth dimension
[1:34:15] grace God will be the first to rise then
[1:34:17] but or the raptures going to come soon
[1:34:19] no one knows so we must do something for
[1:34:22] the kingdom of God
[1:34:24] now remember this is the statute faith
[1:34:27] is when you get baptized and you get
[1:34:28] virtue now the temperance patience guy's
[1:34:30] brother kindness and this is the baptism
[1:34:32] of the Holy Ghost my man tells us that
[1:34:34] right here's this is what it is faith is
[1:34:37] the substance need to choose the right
[1:34:39] way now I've got faith I've found the
[1:34:41] message the hour the Amen virtue is the
[1:34:45] strength needed to daily walked away
[1:34:46] remember Ruth was virtuous because she
[1:34:49] lived a life in front of all the workers
[1:34:51] in the field she's example virtue now
[1:34:54] it's just understanding to know why you
[1:34:56] walk this way well I should not cut my
[1:34:59] hair why should I not smoke
[1:35:01] why should I not wear short shorts as a
[1:35:03] man why should I not wear tight pants
[1:35:07] like all these people do now not
[1:35:08] goodness temperance is self-control
[1:35:11] needed to remain on the way self-control
[1:35:15] I control my senses I can crucify them
[1:35:18] daily
[1:35:18] patience is steadfastness this is what I
[1:35:21] love that's what oh god help me with
[1:35:23] this need it to be content on the way
[1:35:26] I'm just as content I can wait I know
[1:35:30] God good answer me I'm so content I'm so
[1:35:32] patient with the patience of Christ oh
[1:35:34] that's a real good actually right there
[1:35:37] godliness is the reverence needed to be
[1:35:40] just like God in this way to love your
[1:35:43] enemies that's what Jesus said
[1:35:44] even sinners can love those who love
[1:35:47] them but godliness is loving those who
[1:35:49] don't deserve that's what you said
[1:35:52] brother kai this is selflessness to live
[1:35:56] for others on this way praise God you
[1:35:59] like living brothers save money when I
[1:36:01] come here Reese I'm so nervous is to get
[1:36:03] here so I can do something up to help
[1:36:04] you guys out of course I wasn't opens
[1:36:07] for God you know for God's glory but
[1:36:09] because I love you amen amen
[1:36:11] and that we should give you you should
[1:36:13] come here because I would be a curvature
[1:36:15] mother Jessica are being herdsmen to my
[1:36:16] sister or my brother I want to live for
[1:36:19] somebody else I want them to know I'm
[1:36:20] right with compresses the battle amen
[1:36:23] that's friendly kindness I'm going to
[1:36:25] love the body of Christ and then the
[1:36:27] Holy Ghost is the presence of God the
[1:36:29] seal of God in your soul needed to
[1:36:32] completely manifest a living Christ in
[1:36:34] this way so in other words to completely
[1:36:36] manifest the word that God's called you
[1:36:38] to do whether it's preach song lead or
[1:36:41] teach or whatever God calls you to do
[1:36:43] I'll be a faithful wife and mother
[1:36:45] whatever God's called you do you need
[1:36:46] the Holy Ghost to manifest all the will
[1:36:48] of God for your life
[1:36:49] now remember motor have said you must
[1:36:52] have these virtues in you first before
[1:36:55] your captor sealed you must have these
[1:36:58] first then God seals you in any oh man a
[1:37:01] man sitting like this and does that
[1:37:02] permit when a man possesses these kind
[1:37:05] of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:37:07] it no matter if you speak in tongues
[1:37:10] really like that but until these virtues
[1:37:12] here go into you you're still off the
[1:37:14] real true foundation of faith when these
[1:37:16] virtues grow in and you added to that
[1:37:19] back to that then your living monument
[1:37:21] amen
[1:37:22] so you got to add maybe all these
[1:37:24] virtues first but as I said after your
[1:37:27] faith virtue knowledge all these things
[1:37:29] and to brotherly kindness love the Holy
[1:37:31] Spirit and Christ will come see there's
[1:37:35] Christ coming in the baptism with all
[1:37:37] the ghosts now this is the sermon after
[1:37:41] he preaches - for men he's always kind
[1:37:43] of long message and now remember the
[1:37:46] Holy Spirit could not cut the building
[1:37:47] of God until these things are operating
[1:37:51] by the spirit so seeing sanctification
[1:37:54] the Holy Spirit operate nations always
[1:37:57] fear will operate brother
[1:37:58] you see that the Holy Spirit debt but it
[1:38:01] hasn't cashed you yet - you're filled
[1:38:03] with power remember the Bible said stay
[1:38:05] in Jerusalem until you are endued with
[1:38:06] power from on high any man so we need
[1:38:10] the power of the Spirit of God first and
[1:38:12] all those other things will flow out
[1:38:13] that's true but the caption with the
[1:38:15] power to do it part of it at amen
[1:38:18] there's my time so bear with me you need
[1:38:20] couple minutes it's got a couple coats
[1:38:23] now don't forget that he says verse two
[1:38:26] now and so forth is the add to it until
[1:38:29] the complete stature of Christ is made
[1:38:31] manifest then the Holy Spirit comes upon
[1:38:33] it and seals it is one body ha ha a men
[1:38:37] keep that in mine now he says you know
[1:38:40] quote species for thirty two seals God
[1:38:42] keep that mind takes these things first
[1:38:45] praise God
[1:38:47] then the sealing is the Holy Spirit the
[1:38:50] cap that seals us into the body like
[1:38:51] that hey man I like that and now as
[1:38:56] individuals these virtues and things now
[1:38:58] is add to our faith then when the
[1:39:00] capstone comes the Holy Spirit cemented
[1:39:03] together there is the baptismal Holy
[1:39:05] Spirit submits it together amen
[1:39:09] it's not something dirt that can be
[1:39:11] pushed around and blowing around it's
[1:39:12] cemented together in man all right dad
[1:39:15] get all those bill up in there then the
[1:39:16] Holy Ghost of the sweat that holds it in
[1:39:18] place
[1:39:19] glory ah
[1:39:23] one week later remember this morning I'm
[1:39:27] sorry
[1:39:27] yeah one week later this morning's
[1:39:28] lesson these virtues has to be in there
[1:39:31] before the capstone will even come on
[1:39:34] see until these things scripturally
[1:39:36] proven and sealed in to you the Holy
[1:39:37] Spirit sees you as an individual then
[1:39:40] you're a son a daughter on the doing I
[1:39:43] got two more thing let me see yep just
[1:39:46] two more yeah all right everything okay
[1:39:52] why we gets organized religion to us is
[1:39:55] another week later and your faith virtue
[1:39:57] all these things it is all these things
[1:39:59] godless purity holiness everything and
[1:40:01] then you're sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:40:03] anybody see that by God's grace last
[1:40:07] quote but actually you remember the
[1:40:09] bjurman message it's the cap so what
[1:40:12] do the holy spirit capped off the
[1:40:14] individual and seal it when we added our
[1:40:18] faith but I just got this baby
[1:40:20] we misquote some other he's not reading
[1:40:22] and just misquoted and kept adding to it
[1:40:26] till we got seven things and the seventh
[1:40:28] one was love which was God it's actually
[1:40:31] the eighth point if you count love is
[1:40:33] actually two eight one I'm just I'm not
[1:40:34] trying to create go down I'm just say
[1:40:35] like if you run across and count you
[1:40:38] find it and that's how he makes the
[1:40:40] individual and caps him and seals him
[1:40:43] with the holy spirit and then that's me
[1:40:47] so he's got seven church ages he said
[1:40:48] seven ministries has been surrounded I'm
[1:40:51] sorry sounded away it bought board to
[1:40:52] bring it back and how the head so comes
[1:40:54] to cap off the trip to say to our feet
[1:40:56] by God's grace let me go back just to
[1:40:59] show you the cow I'm not trying to be
[1:41:01] smarter anything like that but he said
[1:41:03] love is the eighth one two three four
[1:41:05] five six seven so I'm sorry he said love
[1:41:07] is the seventh love is actually the 8
[1:41:08] because 8 represents eternity right you
[1:41:12] get seven virtues your complete virtues
[1:41:13] then the eighth is the cement the
[1:41:15] capping the sea of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:18] there we love the Lord tonight amen
[1:41:21] and I'm phenom feeling later go back and
[1:41:22] preach little more on the Holy Ghost so
[1:41:24] your brother works will preach this
[1:41:25] weekend he'll Prakashan the Holy Ghost
[1:41:26] that I don't know had this meal like it
[1:41:28] maybe I know but he always preached on
[1:41:30] that he's a wonderful servant of God
[1:41:33] they bet well felt that up when I read
[1:41:38] that little flock they stopped just kind
[1:41:40] of floated me on Monday more and I'm
[1:41:41] going to take the I just really letting
[1:41:43] to take those service that direction and
[1:41:44] if anybody has this in here or is
[1:41:47] building up to this they all want a
[1:41:48] vision to insult sprays hey man they'll
[1:41:51] want a vision do something for the
[1:41:53] kingdom of God so when we're all done if
[1:41:55] you look back and say Lord we tried to
[1:41:57] we try to witness to every every person
[1:41:59] we could we tried to win souls we try to
[1:42:01] reach out we try to do something for the
[1:42:03] kingdom of God
[1:42:04] beneficence of aikidoka so I'm going to
[1:42:09] take a few moments tonight and let's
[1:42:10] pray in here and let's ask God to give
[1:42:12] us a vision now this Fisher this is the
[1:42:16] thought iPad I'm not saying sup actual
[1:42:18] vision but this is the thought I had I
[1:42:19] want to invite once I got all enough
[1:42:21] good videos on my youtube channel the
[1:42:23] church website once I got a lot of good
[1:42:25] to cover the foundation of Christianity
[1:42:27] I wanted to send out these postcards and
[1:42:30] invite people to come to hear the word
[1:42:32] of God and if I had to go to our website
[1:42:34] that's what I felt like and if you like
[1:42:36] it out I've got those pretty good I've
[1:42:38] got 35 videos on there that's not enough
[1:42:41] I don't know what is

[1:42:45] works of grace I got repairs I got
[1:42:46] baptism I got the Holy Ghost you know
[1:42:49] the things somebody really needs to get
[1:42:51] born again is on there a man I need so
[1:42:54] I'm saying is now and that was 2013 I
[1:42:56] start doing that and in 2013 I went to
[1:42:58] the post office and how do I send out
[1:42:59] postcards so here we are four years
[1:43:01] later I feel like we got enough on there
[1:43:05] and now we could fully get somebody to
[1:43:07] Christ if they really had a metaphor so
[1:43:10] I'm going to share with you that was my
[1:43:11] vision I'm not saying it's right I'm
[1:43:13] just saying I wanna do something for God
[1:43:15] so let's take a few minutes to devote
[1:43:18] some time to pray for a vision and it
[1:43:21] kept me anytime you don't have to be
[1:43:23] this summer I just say this summer
[1:43:24] because that's my keyword for I'm not
[1:43:25] working I'm on vacation you know I have
[1:43:29] more time to do things for the church
[1:43:30] which I did that's how I'm a key word us
[1:43:33] my favorite happy time of the end I know
[1:43:36] but I could be fully committed to a
[1:43:40] ministry or you're not outreach in the
[1:43:42] summer I'm not lats a lot easier for me
[1:43:44] they got all the time on eat you know
[1:43:46] just do something for God so how many
[1:43:48] want to do something okay
[1:43:50] let me pray with me let's just pray if
[1:43:52] you could what can we just raise our
[1:43:54] hands if we could just raise our hands
[1:43:55] that means surrender let's just have
[1:43:56] word of Prayer I'm gonna still speak in

[1:44:03] in prayer have any father Lord we love
[1:44:06] you tonight Lourdes thought about the
[1:44:08] little flock truly truly spoke to me on
[1:44:11] Monday morning Lord and truly lifted me
[1:44:13] when I was down in the dumps or Cup all
[1:44:15] beat up all discouraged and when I felt
[1:44:19] like a word came from heaven you're the
[1:44:21] only one standing there's no other
[1:44:23] preacher there's another Church in
[1:44:24] Summit County you're the only one
[1:44:27] standing within 55 miles and 163 miles
[1:44:31] and 197 miles your church is the only
[1:44:34] one standing so be encouraged Lord I
[1:44:37] stand here tonight
[1:44:38] very
[1:44:40] I know this sermon will be played back
[1:44:42] on that day Lord God and Father let it
[1:44:46] be said Lord that we preached it a lord
[1:44:48] we asked for a vision Lord God yes we
[1:44:52] how about missionaries Lord got overseas
[1:44:54] but mortising like there's something in
[1:44:56] me there's something in my heart that
[1:44:57] wants to reach out here in this city and
[1:45:01] lord your prophet said that Lord that
[1:45:03] the sins of this city will be upon us in
[1:45:06] other words we've got to pray for the
[1:45:07] seed we've got to reach out for the city
[1:45:09] we've got to try to win a soul for Jesus
[1:45:11] Christ so we take these few moments here
[1:45:16] Lord God I just train Oregon you fill us
[1:45:19] with a vision Lord God to do something
[1:45:21] perhaps soon Lord God or in your time I
[1:45:24] share with the people my vision Lord God
[1:45:26] four years ago I remember walking in
[1:45:28] that lure that post-office and wanting
[1:45:31] to be able to reach out and invite
[1:45:34] people to come hear the word of God
[1:45:36] whether they accept it or not that they
[1:45:39] have a chance to hear the truth about
[1:45:41] Jesus Christ more than your prophet said
[1:45:45] has the greatest Rivage in life to be
[1:45:47] invited to come to the marriage supper
[1:45:49] of the Lamb
[1:45:50] lord I want to thank you Lord for
[1:45:53] tonight again Lord take this prayer and
[1:45:56] I pray the people that are here and
[1:45:57] those that are listening those that are
[1:45:59] hungry to do something for you Lord God
[1:46:01] those that want a vision I pray God we
[1:46:03] continue to pray about it Lord God and
[1:46:05] find a vision find something we can do
[1:46:08] for the kingdom of God's sake or God
[1:46:12] your prophet said those that do
[1:46:15] something they're the world's not even
[1:46:17] worthy of such type of people that would
[1:46:21] do anything to bring people into a
[1:46:23] little church to hear the message of the
[1:46:25] hour preached Lord God pray Lord to fill
[1:46:29] us Lord fill us with vision those with
[1:46:31] inspiration or maybe put on somebody's
[1:46:33] heart I want to be me the whole thing
[1:46:35] perhaps you put on somebody's heart I'll
[1:46:37] pray about it fast about it and come say
[1:46:39] brother Jesse I just feel that maybe we
[1:46:41] should do this or maybe we'll do that

[1:46:46] and do something for your kingdom I want
[1:46:48] to thank you for your encouragement more
