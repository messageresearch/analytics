[34:22] that's where you know you really see the
[34:24] strength and love of motherhood and
[34:26] that's why God has called women to be
[34:29] such wonderful and faithful servants

[36:42] so anoint us with that sweet spirit
[36:44] today afresh in Jesus Christ's name the
[36:47] church said amen god bless you be in see
[36:49] the praise God so like to look at this
[36:55] thought here god bless you brother Vann
[36:59] good to see you sir let's look at times
[37:06] and seasons I'm sorry let's look at just
[37:09] purpose again I do have just a few
[37:12] scriptures or quotes rather and
[37:14] scriptures that go through about times
[37:15] and seasons but I don't think the whole
[37:17] sermon will be on times and seasons
[37:19] that's why I didn't really give it that
[37:20] title but that doesn't matter so I like
[37:24] to start with a few quotes on times and
[37:26] seasons and then we'll get to this
[37:29] please the essays chapter 3 I want to
[37:31] start going through these 14 times in
[37:33] seasons we preach recently how in the 14
[37:37] seasons there's there opposite seasons
[37:40] but there are also complementary seasons
[37:42] so in other words there's natural
[37:44] applications but there's also spiritual
[37:47] applications I think we'll be able to
[37:49] start those this morning if the Lord
[37:51] will help us here how many happy be in
[37:53] the house of Lord this morning
[37:54] nowhere else I'd rather be praise God
[37:56] than be in God's house so we're happy to
[37:58] be here so we read our text here now we
[38:01] actually did verses 1 2 3 but I want to
[38:03] go back to these times and seasons for a
[38:05] moment and get through a few more quotes
[38:06] as I said quotes from God's prophet so
[38:11] brother Branham is preaching a prophet
[38:14] of God and he's teaching about how the
[38:16] two different vines bring forth their
[38:19] fruit in different seasons so if you
[38:21] have your Bible let's go to
[38:22] you thirteen so you know that when
[38:24] brother branham was preaching on this he
[38:25] was preaching from the bible so jesus
[38:28] preached this in matthew 13 so let's go
[38:31] there and let's look at the
[38:33] interpretation of the two vines or the
[38:36] two seeds so Jesus says in the last days
[38:39] there's gonna be two different seeds
[38:40] there's gonna be a weekly and a tare
[38:43] seat all right and both live off the
[38:45] same anointing so these seeds these
[38:49] vines have to be both proposed claiming
[38:53] to be Christian churches right because
[38:56] the Muslim has no part with the Holy
[38:58] Spirit right they don't they don't want
[39:00] Jesus's anointing they want allows
[39:02] anointing and all Allah is no God right
[39:06] because the Muslim faith is the second
[39:08] largest in the world I mean oh there's
[39:10] 1.8 Muslims in the world but there's
[39:13] over 2 billion Christians and the
[39:16] Catholic Church makes up 1.3 billion of
[39:18] those and then the Protestants are not
[39:21] even a billion so if you were eat it in
[39:24] the scripture here this is referring to
[39:25] the true church as the wheat and the
[39:28] false church as tears but both live off
[39:32] the same anointing so let's go if you
[39:36] would to verse 36 because here's the
[39:42] interpretation 13:36
[39:44] then Jesus sent the multitude away went
[39:46] to the house and his disciples came unto
[39:48] him saying declare nos the parable of
[39:50] the tares of the field the answer said
[39:53] to them he that soweth the good seed is
[39:56] the son of man the field is the world
[39:59] the good seed of the children of the
[40:01] kingdom but the tares the children of
[40:03] the wicked one the enemy that sowed them
[40:05] is the devil the harvest is into the
[40:07] world and the Reapers are the Angels as
[40:10] therefore the tares are gathered and
[40:13] burned the fire so shall it be in the
[40:15] end of this world the Son of man shall
[40:18] send forth his angels and they shall
[40:19] gather out of his kingdom all things
[40:21] that offend and then which do iniquity
[40:24] and shall cast them into a furnace of
[40:26] fire there should be wailing and
[40:27] gnashing of teeth then shall the
[40:29] righteous shine forth as the Sun in the
[40:31] kingdom of their father
[40:32] who hath ears to hear let him hear
[40:36] now that's the interpretation of us
[40:38] let's go back now I kind of show it
[40:40] wanted you to see the symbols or the the
[40:42] the interpretation of the symbols now
[40:44] let's go read the parable so it's in
[40:47] verse 24 Matthew 13:24
[40:51] another parable put he forth him saying
[40:53] the kingdom of heaven is like in a man
[40:54] which sowed good seed in his field but
[40:56] while he slept his enemy came and sowed
[40:59] tares among the wheat and went his way
[41:01] now let's stop right there everybody
[41:03] knows I hope you know that a tear is a
[41:06] weed but it looks exactly like the wheat
[41:09] seed it looks exactly the same and they
[41:12] both look the same until harvest time
[41:14] and at harvest time will bow but the
[41:18] tear will just stand straight up and it
[41:20] won't bow to the Sun and that you know
[41:21] of course we don't Paul said we bow our
[41:23] knees to our Lord and Savior Jesus
[41:25] Christ of whom all heaven and earth is
[41:27] named praise God so the true children of
[41:30] God bow to the commands of the Lord
[41:32] Jesus Christ whereas the false church
[41:34] that air will not bow they won't obey
[41:36] all the commands of the Bible and yet
[41:39] they'll still claim to be wheat they'll
[41:41] so claim to be the true church they'll
[41:42] even look like the church so they'll go
[41:44] to a Christian Church they'll sing
[41:46] Christian songs but their lives will not
[41:48] bow and obey the Word of God and so see
[41:53] there's two there's two seeds here that
[41:55] there's two different vines we're
[41:57] talking about
[41:58] and Jesus said they'll go all the way to
[42:00] the end time he said angels don't don't
[42:02] pull them up now
[42:03] because you might pull up a good one
[42:04] when you pull up the bad one because
[42:07] it's hard for the angels that - no he
[42:09] said let them both grow together until
[42:11] the harvest time and then the angels
[42:13] will gather they'll gather the tear burn
[42:16] them and then the wheat will be gathered
[42:17] in heaven for the marriage supper of the
[42:19] Lamb praise God but we see from the
[42:22] parable now we go to verse 26 but when
[42:27] the blade was sprung up and brought
[42:28] forth fruit then appeared the tares also
[42:30] so the servants of the householder came
[42:32] and said him Sir didst not thou sow good
[42:34] seed in thy field for whence then hath
[42:36] the tares and he said an enemy have done
[42:38] this the servants said unto Him wilt
[42:40] thou then that we go and gather them up
[42:42] but he said nay lest while ye gather up
[42:45] the tares you
[42:46] rude up also the wheat with them let
[42:48] both grow together into the harvest and
[42:50] the time of the harvest I'll say to the
[42:52] Reapers gather you together first the
[42:54] tares and bind them in bundles to burn
[42:56] them but gather the wheat into my barn
[42:59] amen
[43:01] a church this is why we were we're happy
[43:05] with being a small Church because as a
[43:07] small Church we're not part of any
[43:10] denomination because we know all
[43:11] denominations once they write their
[43:14] bylaws and they say this is how God this
[43:18] is how God works right there the Holy
[43:20] Spirit leaves them because they've
[43:22] limited God they put God in a box but
[43:25] God will not be contained in a man-made
[43:26] box praise the Lord
[43:29] he's not gonna be contained he's the
[43:32] Holy One of Israel he's the one who
[43:34] won't be limited he's the unlimited God
[43:37] and so God has left every denomination
[43:40] he left the Catholic first then he left
[43:42] the Lutheran then he left the Methodist
[43:44] and then he left the Presbyterian and
[43:46] the Nazarene and then he left the
[43:48] Pentecostal and so where is God today
[43:50] he's not a denomination but he's in a
[43:53] small group of people called his bride
[43:55] and with what we are claiming to be a
[43:58] part of a bride but all the other ones
[44:01] who claim to who stay in denomination
[44:04] and they live in dead churches that's
[44:07] what we believe those dead churches are
[44:10] this false mind and God is calling them
[44:13] in love God is saying come out of that
[44:15] system come out don't be a terror praise
[44:17] God if you're a real weak you won't be
[44:20] in terror you'll act like a wheat you'll
[44:22] act like I'm sorry won't act like a
[44:24] terror act like a real wheat seed amen
[44:26] you'll bow you'll love the word you obey
[44:28] the Bible you'll live the Bible amen if
[44:31] you're a real wheat seed of God
[44:33] hallelujah and so that's what brother
[44:35] Branham is talking about here he said
[44:36] the true vine of the false vine both had
[44:39] the same anointing so see even in false
[44:41] churches they can have good anointings
[44:43] people can get healed people can have
[44:45] spiritual dreams and things like that
[44:48] he said the water fell on both of them
[44:50] no wonder he warned us it would to see
[44:52] the very elected if it was possible
[44:54] notice they look they're saying they're
[44:56] anointed the same he said by their fruit
[44:58] how do you
[45:00] how'd you know it oranges in the orange
[45:02] because it's berry a grapefruit the vine
[45:05] is alright it's living in the tree but
[45:06] it's burying a grapefruit it isn't like
[45:09] the first one if the church says they
[45:11] believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[45:12] today and forever but denies power and
[45:15] denies works and denies word the church
[45:18] that believes in Jesus Christ will do
[45:20] the works of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[45:23] it'll have the life of Jesus Christ and
[45:26] if it isn't no matter if the life is
[45:28] pouring into it if it isn't
[45:29] predestinated from the roots it will
[45:31] bear great fruit every time or something
[45:33] different but if it's the predestinated
[45:35] life in the roots
[45:37] it'll bear Jesus Christ the same
[45:39] yesterday today and forever if it's the
[45:41] word coming up through the route which
[45:44] he is the route the beginning of time
[45:47] notice it's it's what they produce that
[45:50] tells the difference so you'd have to
[45:53] look at our lives you have to if you
[45:56] didn't know which church was the right
[45:57] church you have to watch you have to
[45:58] watch amens life or bang's life you have
[46:01] to watch Aaron's life or my life or my
[46:03] wife you have to watch what is our life
[46:05] produce does it produce the same life of
[46:08] Jesus Christ or not amen
[46:11] then you have to take like a
[46:12] denominational Church and look at their
[46:14] life this their life produce a life that
[46:18] looks like Jesus Christ and that's the
[46:20] only way to know because jesus said by
[46:22] their fruit or by their actions you
[46:24] shall know them that's right he says man
[46:28] does not gather grapes of a thistle even
[46:30] though that this will be right in the
[46:31] grapevine that could be possible but the
[46:33] fruit will tell it what is fruit the
[46:36] word for the fruit season that's what it
[46:39] is they're teaching the teaching of what
[46:42] the teaching of the season what time it
[46:44] is
[46:44] men's doctrine denomination doctrine or
[46:47] or God's word for the season amen
[46:50] hallelujah now if you got your Bibles
[46:54] let's just go to 2nd Timothy 2 all right
[46:56] second Timothy 3 here let me show you
[46:59] what exactly what the Bible says the
[47:01] false churches will be preaching I'll
[47:02] just put it up here because I I didn't
[47:04] put it I didn't put it on my slides so
[47:11] here
[47:11] all these descriptions and how many
[47:13] words I think I've preached it on a
[47:15] sermon lately wasn't there 16 of these
[47:17] lovers at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
[47:24] 14 15 16 17 18 19
[47:29] okay 19 19 that's right yeah I preached
[47:32] up to 19 I think no I stopped at 17 I
[47:36] can't remember I'm sorry anyways there's
[47:38] 19 19 that repeats there now look at
[47:41] here here's what the Bible says this is
[47:42] what the teachings from false churches
[47:45] will be false churches will allow these
[47:48] sins can embrace amen
[47:49] because Paul said no this also in the
[47:51] last times last days perilous
[47:53] troublesome times shall come for men
[47:56] should be lovers of their own selves
[47:59] that's the first thing that false
[48:01] churches will have they will love
[48:02] themselves more than they love God
[48:05] they'll be covetous they'll want the
[48:08] things of other people more than they
[48:10] want God there'll be boasters they'll
[48:13] brag about themselves rather than
[48:16] bragging on Jesus let me tell you
[48:18] churches there's anything good about you
[48:20] right it's only because of Jesus Christ
[48:23] I'm not taking credit for the book oh
[48:25] you're not taking credit for the healing
[48:27] you know anything good that ever
[48:29] happened this church none of us are
[48:30] taking any credit it's all Jesus amen
[48:34] we're just thanking God for what God's
[48:36] done amongst us amen
[48:38] proud so that means they went their own
[48:41] way remember pride pride is the opposite
[48:43] of humility humility is taking God's
[48:45] weight humbling yourself pride is doing
[48:47] your own thing how many churches allow
[48:49] people to do whatever they want and
[48:51] don't tell me what the word says they'll
[48:53] blaspheme which is speak evil of real
[48:56] churches they'll blaspheme God's name
[48:59] they'll blasting true churches true
[49:01] believers they'll blasting them speak
[49:03] evil against their name they'll be
[49:06] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[49:09] without natural affection trucebreakers
[49:11] they'll break their promises especially
[49:13] marriages right they'll get divorced
[49:15] from this one divorce from that one and
[49:17] let them remarry that's evil that's
[49:19] adultery a minute truce breakers they
[49:22] can't keep their word
[49:25] false accusers incontinent fierce
[49:26] despisers of those that are good so
[49:30] they'll speak they'll speak good of evil
[49:32] churches but they'll speak bad of good
[49:34] churches traitors they'll betray you
[49:38] heady highminded lovers of pleasures
[49:41] more than lovers of God they'll watch
[49:43] March Madness more than they'll watch
[49:45] God's Word amen Church or Super Bowl or
[49:49] World Series or video games or whatever
[49:52] you want to say right or movies well
[49:55] that way they'll love that more than
[49:57] they'll love God God should be our first
[49:59] love amen and if we love God the love of
[50:02] the world should pass away hallelujah
[50:04] when I was a child I did those things
[50:07] but when I became a man I put away those
[50:09] things amen
[50:11] spiritually see they have a form of
[50:15] godliness they go to church they might
[50:17] even sing about Jesus but they denied
[50:19] the cleansing power of the gospel they
[50:22] men so see that's that's exactly what
[50:26] the Word of God said for this surah they
[50:29] which creep into houses and lead
[50:30] captives silly women letter laden with
[50:33] sins and led away with diverse lusts
[50:35] see they go into people's houses these
[50:37] false churches and they let the people
[50:39] have whatever they want as long as they
[50:41] come to church you can keep living in
[50:45] sin you can keep loving sin as long as
[50:47] you come to church they ever learned but
[50:51] are never able to come to the knowledge
[50:53] of the truth and what is the truth jesus
[50:55] said thy Word is truth alright now let
[51:00] me show you the Antichrist in 2nd
[51:02] Thessalonians chapter 2 I was just
[51:04] talking with a friend this week about
[51:05] this it just became fresh to me again so
[51:09] let's go let's go to 2nd Thessalonians
[51:12] chapter 2
[51:17] okay here just yeah second Thessalonians
[51:20] chapter 2 verse 10 if you have time read
[51:22] the whole chapter if it's if you're
[51:25] unfamiliar with it but this whole
[51:26] chapter is about the Antichrist so the
[51:29] Antichrist is going to be the head of
[51:31] the false churches and denominations but
[51:34] Christ is going to be a head of the true
[51:35] church and he already is praise God aim
[51:39] ahead he already is the head of this
[51:41] church amen
[51:42] because his word rules amen now look
[51:47] what
[51:47] so Satan let me actually go to verse 9
[51:49] even him whose coming is after the
[51:51] working of Satan that's the Antichrist
[51:53] the Antichrist has powers after Satan
[51:55] it's after his leadership with all power
[51:58] and signs and lying wonders so the false
[52:01] church will have power and lie but some
[52:05] of their signs and wonders will be lies
[52:06] there won't be real miracles but see
[52:10] that all the people all the nations will
[52:12] get caught up in that well they've got
[52:14] miracles they must be of God and we
[52:16] believe that we'll be led by the Roman
[52:18] Catholic Church and all the Protestant
[52:20] churches that will follow them now look
[52:23] here's how they deceive people Church
[52:25] they deceive them with unrighteousness
[52:27] in them that perish so they're gonna let
[52:30] them live unrighteous sinful lives see
[52:35] and that list that I just read you in
[52:38] 2nd Timothy 3 that's part of the list
[52:41] there to let them be prideful
[52:43] trucebreakers liars they let them just
[52:47] love the things of the world as long as
[52:49] you come to our church you're still
[52:51] saved
[52:51] that's the nothing but a bold-faced lie
[52:54] when you're saved the Bible said you
[52:57] died a sin praise God when you Jesus
[52:59] Christ really saves your soul then
[53:01] you're dead to all the things in the
[53:03] world and all you want to do is feast on
[53:05] God's Word all the time amen that's
[53:08] right but see this is how he deceives
[53:10] and through sinful things
[53:13] unrighteousness and then that perish why
[53:16] because they love not the truth so they
[53:19] didn't know really really what the Bible
[53:21] said they didn't really love what the
[53:23] Bible said that they might be saved
[53:25] because this God is going to send them a
[53:27] strong delusion God is going to send
[53:29] them a lying spirit the
[53:31] a lie don't let that stumble you God did
[53:35] that in the days of my kya and Ahab
[53:37] right
[53:37] God said who will go before who will go
[53:40] for me and who will be a deceiving lying
[53:42] spirit in in the mouth of Ahab in the
[53:45] prophets and a lying spirit said I'll do
[53:47] it before you God and God said go ahead
[53:50] that right God allowed a lying spirit to
[53:55] going to see they have and this it's the
[53:58] reason why because God knew he didn't
[54:00] want to believe the Prophet hey hey man
[54:03] glory the real man of God God knew Ahab
[54:06] wouldn't believe my kiya no matter how
[54:08] much preaching that prophet did and told
[54:11] him the truth God knew he wouldn't
[54:12] believe it so he said fine who are going
[54:14] to see they have because they have wants
[54:16] to be deceived anyway and a lying spirit
[54:18] said I'll go and God said go the same
[54:21] thing is repeating today who will hear
[54:23] God's prophet today amen
[54:25] who will hear the Word of God today you
[54:27] and I will hear the word of God and if
[54:31] we don't if you don't then you'll just
[54:33] receive a lying spirit because God this
[54:37] God if you do the same thing right here
[54:38] God will send that God sends them a
[54:39] lying spirit and they believe a lie that
[54:43] they all might be damned who believed
[54:44] not the truth but had pleasure in
[54:46] unrighteousness now that sounds pretty
[54:47] rough doesn't it but it depends how you
[54:50] look at it God has to be rough because
[54:53] God has already said John 3:16 for God
[54:56] so loved God's love was trying to send
[54:59] them listen to the Prophet listen to the
[55:01] word God so loved the world that He gave
[55:04] His only begotten Son that whosoever
[55:06] believeth on him should not perish God
[55:09] doesn't want people to perish and that's
[55:11] why sent prophets that's why I sent a
[55:14] prophet in our day amen
[55:15] here does it weren't the unit perish
[55:17] that they might have everlasting life
[55:19] praise God but because they won't
[55:22] receive it God has no other choice but
[55:25] to give them over to a lie but God tried
[55:28] God's live sent a man of God preaching
[55:32] the Word of God God always saves men and
[55:34] women by preaching men oh so I'm glad to
[55:37] be here today hallelujah because
[55:39] somebody can be saved today amen because
[55:43] that's what God's preaching does
[55:45] God anoints a man to save men and women
[55:48] hallelujah with the spirit that they
[55:50] might believe the truth that they might
[55:51] be saved amen hallelujah but we're bound
[55:57] to give thanks always to God for you
[55:58] brethren beloved of the Lord how many
[56:00] know God calls you his beloved God loves
[56:06] you Church you're his beloved beloved of
[56:10] the Lord because God hath from the
[56:11] beginning chosen you salvation through
[56:13] sanctification of the Spirit and belief
[56:16] of the truth that reminds me real quick
[56:17] I just want to go over this honey
[56:19] remember when Daniel prayed three weeks
[56:20] I remember that he's like God hear our
[56:22] prayers he was confessing his sin he was
[56:25] confessing his dad said
[56:26] Daniel was confessing the nation said he
[56:28] was confessing everybody sins for three
[56:30] weeks and what's the first thing that
[56:33] you just said he said fear not
[56:35] he said because your but you're very
[56:38] much beloved in heaven ah oh ma and if
[56:43] Daniel was beloved in heaven under the
[56:45] blood of bulls and goats what about you
[56:47] and I under the blood of God's Son Jesus
[56:49] Christ amen hallelujah but see we got to
[56:54] seek God like Daniel sought God we got
[56:56] to be devoted to God like Daniel was
[56:59] devoted to God and that's how we become
[57:01] the beloved of God amen
[57:04] see because God has chosen you God chose
[57:07] to save you through sanctification of
[57:10] the Spirit that means cleaning you up
[57:12] through the Holy Spirit and believing
[57:14] the truth hallelujah thank the Lord so
[57:19] let me go back to this quote now here
[57:21] what is their fruit then it's their
[57:24] teaching it's not their miracles and
[57:27] their anointing that's not the real
[57:28] fruit the prophet said the fruit is the
[57:30] teaching that actually impacts their
[57:34] life right it's the teaching what do
[57:37] they teach the teaching of what he said
[57:40] it must be God's Word for the season
[57:42] that's right now I want to go to the
[57:46] next thought there's a couple more
[57:47] thoughts I want to get through here
[57:48] brother Graham said the rapture is the
[57:50] Firefall season let me know that now go
[57:55] to Revelation 8 here this is this is
[57:57] scriptural
[57:58] and I've had different preachers
[57:59] preaching here it's been a while now but
[58:01] the seven seals in Revelation chapter 8
[58:04] which we believe is the day and hour of
[58:05] the rapture according to many many
[58:07] quotes by brother Branham now I think
[58:11] it's striking look at revelation 8 verse
[58:14] 1 and when he'd open the Seventh Seal
[58:17] There was silence in heaven about the
[58:19] space a half hour because that Lord and
[58:21] Savior is coming down to redeem his
[58:23] bride amen and he done left heaven
[58:25] hallelujah he's going down to meet his
[58:27] wife in the air for the wedding ceremony
[58:30] Lori and I saw the seven angels which
[58:33] stood before God and to them were given
[58:35] the seven trumpets verse three and
[58:38] another angel came and stood at the
[58:40] altar having a golden censer and there
[58:41] was given unto Him much incense that he
[58:43] should offer it with the prayers of the
[58:45] Saints upon the golden altar which was
[58:47] before the throne and the smoke of the
[58:49] incense which came with the prayers the
[58:51] Saints ascended up before god out of the
[58:54] angel's hands amen
[58:55] look how god's listening to your prayers
[58:57] church never get discouraged God hears
[58:59] your prayers verse five and the angel
[59:02] took the censer and filled it with fire
[59:04] of the altar and cast it into the earth
[59:09] and there were voices and thunderings
[59:13] and lightnings an earthquake the seven
[59:14] trumpets which had them seven trumpets
[59:16] prepared themselves to sound
[59:19] now I want to read this quote and I got
[59:21] a video for you because I found at
[59:25] Yosemite National Park where the fire
[59:27] falls I think that's what brother Moran
[59:28] was talking about one time and a couple
[59:30] of his stories so I want to show it to
[59:32] you in just a little bit so let's read
[59:33] the quote from invisible Union where the
[59:35] prophet of God is talking about this now
[59:38] before closing one time I was up in
[59:40] Glacier National Park we heard all day
[59:43] long they had a fall a glacier fire that
[59:46] was going to fall at night so the people
[59:49] was busy all day long getting that thing
[59:51] ready because they was going to pour
[59:52] that fire out that night they put a
[59:54] liquid fireballs like a great glacier
[59:56] water but it looked like a rainbow
[59:58] almost when it comes out of the fire
[1:00:00] falling out of this glacier all around
[1:00:03] through the park wife and nine children
[1:00:04] walked around through the day we want to
[1:00:07] stay we want to stay to see that fire
[1:00:09] exhibition it was promised
[1:00:12] that we would see it and we witnessed it
[1:00:14] again they said they have it ever
[1:00:16] through the summer season so forth I
[1:00:18] said well will we be able to see it now
[1:00:21] the one I found he says Glacier National
[1:00:22] Park I looked it up I couldn't quite
[1:00:24] find which park that was so I have a
[1:00:26] video it may be the same thing it may be
[1:00:28] something different but it's the same
[1:00:30] thing in one way because fires falling I
[1:00:32] think you'll see what I'm saying in just
[1:00:33] a few minutes all right so just bear
[1:00:36] with me
[1:00:36] and so we promised it tonight we're
[1:00:38] promised that they were up there getting
[1:00:40] it ready now and after and after all had
[1:00:44] been made ready for the event that's
[1:00:45] what's taking place right now all has
[1:00:48] been med raid ready for the event a
[1:00:50] church being called pulled out for his
[1:00:52] namesake
[1:00:53] taking his bride out from amongst the
[1:00:55] world these denominations and all the
[1:00:57] world
[1:00:58] and the filth and things of the world so
[1:01:00] brother ham is typing of the rapture as
[1:01:03] them getting ready they're making ready
[1:01:04] all day for the fire to fall and brother
[1:01:06] man said that's what's happening now the
[1:01:08] church is being made ready for the fire
[1:01:11] to fall amen
[1:01:13] everybody the event was ready everybody
[1:01:16] was standing out they said now keep
[1:01:18] watching right up to the top of the
[1:01:19] mountain there that's the way I always
[1:01:21] come that's the way it's come this time
[1:01:23] that's the way it always comes not
[1:01:24] through denomination never did God use
[1:01:26] the denomination never so we're in a
[1:01:30] pretty good spot here our chances of
[1:01:32] receiving the fire from heaven our super
[1:01:35] increased because we're not in a
[1:01:36] denomination amen because God never did
[1:01:40] use a denomination he didn't use the
[1:01:41] Pharisee denomination the Sadducees the
[1:01:43] Herodian God didn't use any of those he
[1:01:46] uses a group of small called out humble
[1:01:49] little people that love his word amen
[1:01:52] the reformer goes forth he gets the word
[1:01:55] of the Lord and then when he dies they
[1:01:57] build a denomination out of it that's
[1:01:58] what the Pentecostals and all did and
[1:02:00] when the new issues everything that's
[1:02:03] just the way that's the way the thing
[1:02:04] come out a new word added and they build
[1:02:07] a church out of it made in denominations
[1:02:10] separate themselves it had to be that
[1:02:11] way now you can't beat nature nature
[1:02:14] falls in the same routine all the time
[1:02:16] stalk leave tassel so forth shucks then
[1:02:19] the wheat now notice all was ready
[1:02:23] everything had been kindled and made

[1:02:42] we're all excited that fire is going to

[1:03:18] on high the former and the latter rain
[1:03:20] shall come together in the last days so
[1:03:24] this fire represents the latter rain
[1:03:26] rapturing bathe amen all these promises
[1:03:30] through the Scriptures been given we're
[1:03:32] looking upward watch at the true bride
[1:03:34] across the nation this hour looking up

[1:03:42] separate yourself from shucks lay before
[1:03:45] the Sun keep looking up be under
[1:03:47] expectation and all at once we heard
[1:03:51] something from the top of the hill a
[1:03:53] voice came down to the live loudspeakers
[1:03:55] saying all things already then this man
[1:03:59] standing right up there by the side of
[1:04:01] me said let the fire fall here it come
[1:04:05] pouring down across the mountain a
[1:04:07] glacier of fire and a blazes of licking
[1:04:10] he sent a sight to behold
[1:04:13] glory now bear with me here let me play
[1:04:15] his video here I got it saved under my
[1:04:17] photos I saved it a few weeks ago I was
[1:04:20] gonna preach it last week but as the
[1:04:22] Holy Spirit moved I never got to it well
[1:04:25] I've taken a lot of pictures since that
[1:04:26] and then haven't I that's all my student
[1:04:29] pictures I take a picture of the class
[1:04:31] and I give it out to the parents well
[1:04:33] where'd it go there is
[1:04:37] the fire phone alright here let me go
[1:04:53] back and read that I'm sorry it says a
[1:04:59] rare phenomenon known as a fire fall is
[1:05:03] back at Yosemite National Park in
[1:05:05] California the visual display happens
[1:05:16] when the light hits a waterfall which
[1:05:20] makes it appear as if fire is flowing
[1:05:22] down the rocks you get to be here and
[1:05:31] see whatever nature gives us I think one
[1:05:34] of the most exciting experiences I ever
[1:05:36] had in this in this particular spot is
[1:05:39] when the light finally showed and only
[1:05:42] showed the very top of the falls and the
[1:05:44] forest erupted with people applauding
[1:05:46] and cheering whistling you know it was a
[1:05:50] happy place to be alright and that's the
[1:05:53] end of that so what'd you think of that
[1:05:55] your semi National Park people waiting
[1:05:58] around and said and these workers say
[1:05:59] the most exciting thing is when the fire
[1:06:02] starts falling people don't know they're
[1:06:04] waiting around and all of a sudden it
[1:06:05] falls and you see the glory of God and
[1:06:08] that's what the rapture is gonna be the
[1:06:10] glory of God falling striking the church
[1:06:13] again amen glory he said brother let's
[1:06:17] get all things ready for one of these
[1:06:19] days the fire is going to fall we're
[1:06:21] going up now let's get ready for the
[1:06:23] fire falling time we're in the last days
[1:06:26] we all know that we're ready for the
[1:06:27] coming of the Lord the thing to do is
[1:06:29] separate yourself from all sin separate
[1:06:31] yourself from anything that pertains in
[1:06:33] the world don't love the world or the
[1:06:35] things of the world let no man by his
[1:06:37] kree deceive you you stay right
[1:06:39] straighten the promise of God the Word
[1:06:40] of God and that word if it's a word for
[1:06:43] this day God vincit Eights it so if he
[1:06:45] doesn't it's not the word for this day
[1:06:48] alright everybody understand that now Oh
[1:06:51] see when I saw a video I'm like Firefall
[1:06:53] brother branham said firefall it struck
[1:06:55] me and then the says it is well it's
[1:06:58] connected with the seventh seal amen
[1:07:00] loretta said get everything ready this
[1:07:02] is the last month before he passed away
[1:07:03] this is the November 65 at the
[1:07:08] invincible Union saying the fire is
[1:07:09] gonna fall get everything ready cuz one
[1:07:12] day the Holy Ghost is gonna fall in a
[1:07:13] great way hey man thank God
[1:07:16] and we read this notice the fire falls
[1:07:19] before the seven trumpets blow the seven
[1:07:22] trumpets blow in the tribulation but the
[1:07:24] fire falls before that and all right we
[1:07:27] already read that so I'm not gonna read
[1:07:28] that all right you can race amen to that
[1:07:31] they like that
[1:07:31] praise the Lord now this is the last
[1:07:34] season quoting then we'll get to the
[1:07:35] Ecclesiastes chapter three this is the
[1:07:38] season we're all looking forward to the
[1:07:40] season of a new body I just want to read
[1:07:42] these last quotes here he says but those
[1:07:46] who sometimes their soul is saved and
[1:07:48] this old body still belongs to Satan and
[1:07:50] he knows it'll take it at the end time
[1:07:52] he'll crush it and send it back to the
[1:07:53] bugs of the earth will crawl into it and
[1:07:55] eat it up but he'll never touch that
[1:07:57] soul for it's the precious treasure of
[1:08:00] God did you know that God considers your
[1:08:03] soul the treasure the Bible said we have
[1:08:07] treasures in earthen vessels praise the
[1:08:10] Lord that's why God can allow you no
[1:08:12] accidents you might lose a finger you
[1:08:14] might lose an arm you know we wondered
[1:08:16] well how could God do that because God
[1:08:18] looks at your soul and your soul is what
[1:08:21] he treasures most he wants your soul to
[1:08:24] be a repentant soul a saved soul praise
[1:08:27] God a soul that loves God that loves the
[1:08:31] word that's his treasure is a soul that
[1:08:33] has his own nature amen and through that
[1:08:38] life out of that leaf it returns back to
[1:08:40] God who will give it will come forth in
[1:08:42] the next season with the new body that
[1:08:45] Satan can never touch a man Olivia oh
[1:08:49] brother bang Satan can touch this body
[1:08:51] candy he can make this sick but he'll
[1:08:53] never touch that next body ain't I
[1:08:56] he has no right to touch that one
[1:08:58] hallelujah and thank God he can't touch
[1:09:00] my soul either hallelujah because the
[1:09:03] blood of Jesus Christ has sealed us all
[1:09:05] of the believer amen he'll never touch
[1:09:08] the new body he says that's the next
[1:09:11] season that we go in to praise God
[1:09:12] neither can our old age or anything else
[1:09:15] touch it it'll be a glorified body we're
[1:09:17] looking for that Lord bless thy people
[1:09:19] now we're so glad to know that this is
[1:09:22] just not bring the people together for
[1:09:24] something in vain that has been proven
[1:09:26] the greatest reality the world has ever
[1:09:29] known
[1:09:29] that the Son of God is not dead who made
[1:09:32] the promises but is alive among us
[1:09:35] forevermore and we're so happy this
[1:09:37] morning Lord above all things that we
[1:09:39] own the world and could be young I'm
[1:09:43] sure though we could own the world and
[1:09:44] could be young for hundreds of years to
[1:09:46] enjoy it but it would be only a season
[1:09:48] compared to what's the time that's laid
[1:09:51] up for those who love Him oh my so we're
[1:09:54] trying to point our brother and sister
[1:09:55] to this great hour that's approaching us
[1:09:57] and as we see that time coming Lord our
[1:10:00] hearts burn we want to make ready praise
[1:10:03] God all right now see I'm finished now
[1:10:06] with all those times and seasoned quotes
[1:10:07] I'm ready to move on to clean sea
[1:10:09] chapter three how many like that that's
[1:10:11] about four good services on just
[1:10:13] programs quotes on times in season and I
[1:10:15] hope you can see God's times and seasons
[1:10:17] today can you see it I can see it
[1:10:19] because the false churches are teaching
[1:10:21] people to sin there they're teaching
[1:10:24] shows what their fruit really is inside
[1:10:27] their lives and it's corrupt fruit now
[1:10:29] let's get to this in Ecclesiastes
[1:10:31] chapter 3 there's 14 different seasons I
[1:10:35] think tonight or this morning rather
[1:10:37] we'll have time to just do the first
[1:10:38] three here and that's okay because I
[1:10:41] think I'm only studied up to number for
[1:10:43] Easterns are all fresh so they take
[1:10:45] extra extra time to research and each
[1:10:47] you know research each one and make sure
[1:10:49] it's exactly right these are the real
[1:10:51] time-consuming ones but they're also
[1:10:53] rich ones too so remember there's 14
[1:10:57] opposite seasons but they're also
[1:10:59] complementary in the spiritual there's a
[1:11:01] season to be born die plant pluck up
[1:11:04] kill and heal
[1:11:06] break down build up weep and laugh mourn
[1:11:10] dance
[1:11:10] cast gather stones embrace refrain from
[1:11:14] embracing get a time to lose
[1:11:17] time to keep a time to cast away a time
[1:11:19] to rent something and a time to show
[1:11:21] something a time to keep silent or speak
[1:11:23] a time for love or hate and a time for
[1:11:26] war and a time for peace alright so
[1:11:29] let's look at each one of these can we
[1:11:30] do that for a few minutes here by God's
[1:11:32] grace let me uh set a little timer here
[1:11:36] now I put those lines in here so you can
[1:11:39] see I'm just let's just look at born and
[1:11:41] die for a few minutes okay that's a good
[1:11:43] these here now of course it's easy to
[1:11:47] see how these are just opposite seasons
[1:11:49] being born and dying right because I
[1:11:52] just use brother Graham's dates you know
[1:11:53] he was born at night you know nine and
[1:11:55] he died in 1965 everybody can see how
[1:11:58] that's that makes sense that that's
[1:11:59] that's understandable right that's
[1:12:01] common we all know that but you know as
[1:12:04] you look at more scriptures God
[1:12:06] determines when you're born and God
[1:12:08] determines when you die right now
[1:12:11] there's times where God lets some people
[1:12:13] live a little longer than he wanted
[1:12:16] because he's merciful and there's times
[1:12:18] that God takes him a little early before
[1:12:20] that he wanted them to go right so God
[1:12:24] is flexible in that because he's trying
[1:12:27] to show mercy God has to God has to
[1:12:31] prove to people listen I was
[1:12:33] long-suffering I gave you a choice I
[1:12:36] extended mercy to you and if you enter
[1:12:39] the wrong thing I gave you what you
[1:12:41] wanted even though you didn't want the
[1:12:42] right thing I was merciful because no
[1:12:44] man or woman who ever to say and say God
[1:12:46] you are merciful you didn't have
[1:12:48] patience with me you weren't
[1:12:49] long-suffering God will be able to say I
[1:12:51] was long-suffering to all mankind amen
[1:12:57] in other words God's not gonna force
[1:13:00] anybody to do what he wants he's gonna
[1:13:02] give in an option he'll give you the
[1:13:04] choice but then he'll be merciful and
[1:13:06] long-suffering in the midst of it all
[1:13:09] right
[1:13:09] but now the spiritual which this is
[1:13:12] exciting because this may happen for
[1:13:14] some people today you never know when
[1:13:17] someone's gonna be willing to die that
[1:13:19] they might be booked again amen
[1:13:22] so see this is beautiful because this is
[1:13:25] so inspired by the Holy Spirit because
[1:13:27] there's natural opposite season
[1:13:30] with them their spiritual season closely
[1:13:33] tied together and and if not I think you
[1:13:39] understand about in this sermon here by
[1:13:41] the grace of God so let's look at the
[1:13:43] opposites again Paul says and God is
[1:13:46] made of one blood all nations of men for
[1:13:49] to dwell on all the face of the earth
[1:13:50] and has determined the times before
[1:13:52] appointed and the bounds of their
[1:13:54] habitation
[1:13:55] so God determined we'd live here in
[1:13:57] Akron in 2019 God determined the times
[1:14:00] the time you I was born you were born
[1:14:03] because job says who can bring a clean
[1:14:05] one of an unclean not one seeing his
[1:14:08] days are determined and the number of
[1:14:11] his months are with thee thou has
[1:14:13] appointed his bounds that he cannot pass
[1:14:15] so there's a certain boundary that we
[1:14:17] can't pass like with Hezekiah God said
[1:14:20] okay yeah I would have rather have you
[1:14:22] die now and come home to heaven he said
[1:14:24] I'll give you 15 more years but you're
[1:14:26] not going to pass that 15 more years
[1:14:27] they were understanding that he should
[1:14:31] have died 15 years earlier God wanted
[1:14:33] him to go home but because he cried out
[1:14:35] he lived a life of integrity God said
[1:14:36] fine I'll give you the permissive will
[1:14:38] of God but God said you're not going
[1:14:40] beyond 15 years and church he didn't go
[1:14:41] one day beyond 15 years right because
[1:14:45] you cannot go beyond the boundary that
[1:14:48] God has determined right
[1:14:52] Exodus 30 23 25 and ye shall serve the
[1:14:55] Lord your God he shall bless thy bread
[1:14:57] and thy water hey that's my prayer god
[1:14:59] bless my bread and water and I'll take
[1:15:01] sickness away from the midst of thee
[1:15:03] amen
[1:15:03] there's nothing cast there young nor be
[1:15:06] barren in thy land the number of thy
[1:15:09] days I will fulfill see God promises I
[1:15:14] will fulfill all your days so you ever
[1:15:16] write if you feel that of the Holy
[1:15:18] Spirit like Satan's trying to take your
[1:15:20] life early you have a right to claim
[1:15:22] this and say no Satan I'm still got
[1:15:24] years to fulfill all the years God
[1:15:26] promised me amen and you might not know
[1:15:29] the years but God does you understand
[1:15:32] God said you are going to fulfill all
[1:15:36] the years that I've determined and
[1:15:38] you've got to write to stand there as
[1:15:39] they say and move back in Jesus Christ's
[1:15:42] name God
[1:15:43] giving me more than this because you
[1:15:45] believe it you don't know the number but
[1:15:47] you believe God has more years for you
[1:15:49] now I believe this
[1:15:51] at the time when we're you know if we
[1:15:52] have to go through the grave of God
[1:15:53] Terry's 100 more years and I have to go
[1:15:55] to the grave
[1:15:55] I believe God will so if we pray and see
[1:15:58] God I believe God will show us he'll
[1:16:00] give us peace to know in a
[1:16:02] life-threatening disease he'll give us
[1:16:04] peace to know whether this is it's time
[1:16:06] to take us or whether it's it's time to
[1:16:08] heal us and then through that anointing
[1:16:11] we'll be able to speak God's Word and
[1:16:13] say no Satan it's not time for me to go
[1:16:16] or we'll be able to say Lord I see your
[1:16:18] hand in this it's my time to go let me
[1:16:20] set my house in order before I go praise
[1:16:23] the Lord hallelujah he said but the
[1:16:29] number of your days I will fulfil how
[1:16:32] many glad to be still be fulfilling your
[1:16:34] days I am I'm so glad the Lord gave us
[1:16:37] these days now David says so teach us to
[1:16:41] number our days that we may apply our
[1:16:44] hearts on new wisdom help us to remember
[1:16:47] Lord that we're mortal and if you tell
[1:16:49] me we're going to have to die so let me
[1:16:51] use wisdom to know that what I should do
[1:16:54] on this Sunday and what you should do is
[1:16:56] doing what you're doing here in God's
[1:16:58] Word that's wisdom it would have been
[1:17:01] foolish to skip the house of God or to
[1:17:03] miss the preaching of God's Word because
[1:17:05] the preaching of God words is what
[1:17:07] builds you up in words of faith amen and
[1:17:10] so wisdom is what brought you here to
[1:17:14] the house of God this morning and not
[1:17:16] just some other silly event now let's
[1:17:20] switch over now now let's switch over to
[1:17:22] this spiritual I mean oh Jesus said you
[1:17:24] must be born again so he says you must
[1:17:29] don't marvel at this you must be born
[1:17:31] again and member Jesus said God said
[1:17:34] there's a time to die and there's a time
[1:17:36] to be born so if Jesus said there's a
[1:17:40] time to be born spiritually then there
[1:17:43] must also be a time to die spiritually
[1:17:45] amen hallelujah because there's a season
[1:17:50] to be born there's got to be a season to
[1:17:53] die and
[1:17:56] Romans tells us this god forbid how
[1:17:59] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[1:18:03] longer therein on that beautiful church
[1:18:07] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[1:18:10] that we shall also live with him amen
[1:18:14] now this is why foolish version is
[1:18:17] called foolish by the Bible in Jesus is
[1:18:20] because she refuses to die for her love
[1:18:22] for the world
[1:18:26] praise God even if it's just one little
[1:18:29] sin like the rich young ruler he didn't
[1:18:31] love anything else except money and that
[1:18:34] kept him from being a part of the
[1:18:37] missionary fivefold ministry of Jesus
[1:18:40] Christ can I just say like that so he
[1:18:41] kind of relates to today he didn't want
[1:18:46] to sell out office riches give to the
[1:18:48] poor and follow Jesus Christ
[1:18:49] so Jesus said okay you're not gonna be
[1:18:51] born again right he wouldn't die out for
[1:18:56] the things of the world so Jesus says
[1:18:58] you must be born again and Paul said the
[1:19:00] only way that you're alive with Christ
[1:19:03] as if you died with Christ praise God
[1:19:09] does that help by God's grace like we
[1:19:13] know like a regular C to C must rot and
[1:19:15] once that seeds Lots in the ground then
[1:19:18] it springs forth life it's got a rock
[1:19:21] it's gotta have like a dying point and
[1:19:23] then it's got to have like all of a
[1:19:24] sudden a change where that little root
[1:19:26] breaks up and one goes up and one goes
[1:19:27] down and it just starts that like that
[1:19:29] growth praise God
[1:19:31] amen so see if there's a burner the
[1:19:35] spiritual birth there's got to be a
[1:19:37] spiritual death first because every
[1:19:42] Christian that's born again is dead to
[1:19:44] sin now I love this this struck me like
[1:19:48] a ton of bricks I was listening to a
[1:19:50] preacher preaching he quoted scripture I
[1:19:51] was like I forgot about all this this
[1:19:54] whole time I forgot yeah I feel it here
[1:19:57] yeah just as a preacher I feel like I
[1:19:58] could put I wish I could preach every
[1:20:00] scripture every service you know so but
[1:20:02] I know it all comes in season because
[1:20:04] I'm in preaching on seasons look at this
[1:20:06] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:20:08] standeth
[1:20:10] so what is God's foundation guy's
[1:20:11] foundation has a seal on it the Lord
[1:20:15] knows then that are his to see we have
[1:20:18] to worry oh is God gonna save the
[1:20:22] Aborigines in Australia is not going to
[1:20:25] save other people out in Hudson and all
[1:20:29] these people that don't they're not part
[1:20:32] of Western civilization can God save
[1:20:34] them Church God's church has the seal
[1:20:38] that God knows all them that are his
[1:20:41] Amon all that are meant to be saved all
[1:20:44] that he knows will receive salvation
[1:20:46] will be saved amen that's God's
[1:20:50] foundation hallelujah amen
[1:20:53] and but that I love this Isle I know
[1:20:56] yeah this is what I was trying to get to
[1:20:59] let everyone that name it the name of
[1:21:02] Jesus Christ depart from iniquity this
[1:21:05] is why I've treated certain people the
[1:21:07] way I've treated them with coming to our
[1:21:08] church or not and this is just not
[1:21:10] recently but in years past if people are
[1:21:13] not repent of iniquity and keep doing
[1:21:17] evil then we have a right to avoid them
[1:21:23] because this is the foundation of God in
[1:21:27] other words our church will have no
[1:21:28] foundation unless we all depart from the
[1:21:31] iniquity that we started with just
[1:21:34] because you started Nick when he doesn't
[1:21:36] give you an excuse to continuing it
[1:21:38] you've got to be sanctified you and I
[1:21:40] gotta live clean lives Amen that's right
[1:21:46] see a foolish Forge it refuses to die or
[1:21:50] depart from iniquity and this is why she
[1:21:54] sealed out from the rapture because the
[1:21:56] seal is you've left inequity amen the
[1:22:00] boxes of the Holy Ghost is in your heart
[1:22:01] and then it guides you into all truth
[1:22:03] and truth is the opposite of iniquity
[1:22:05] and so the seal the Holy Ghost leads you
[1:22:08] into a sinless life ain't ya you might
[1:22:11] fall short in minor sins but not major
[1:22:14] sins like the ones we read earlier in
[1:22:17] 2nd Timothy you say oh there's minor
[1:22:19] major sins yes there is Jesus said he
[1:22:22] that's unworthy of
[1:22:23] then he's rightfully beaten with many
[1:22:25] stripes he has to Sun a few things will
[1:22:28] be beat with fewer stripes and the
[1:22:29] church said there are major sins and
[1:22:32] there are minor sins the Bible cause the
[1:22:34] major sins abominations praise God
[1:22:39] which are detestable disgusting things
[1:22:43] the God like we all preach about all the
[1:22:46] time right
[1:22:47] trying to get people out of their
[1:22:48] abominations what are you trying to do
[1:22:50] rid of Jesse you're trying to run people
[1:22:52] on the church no I'm trying to establish
[1:22:54] the foundation of the church amen
[1:22:56] because the foundation is if you name
[1:22:59] the name of Jesus Christ depart from
[1:23:01] iniquity and the people go what can I do
[1:23:06] they got to go but all's I know is I
[1:23:09] don't want to crack foundation I want a
[1:23:11] foundation that's solid that everybody
[1:23:13] in the church has departed from iniquity
[1:23:16] amen
[1:23:17] so let them go if they if they don't
[1:23:20] want to live the Word of God they can do
[1:23:22] whatever they want but as for me and my
[1:23:23] house we will live a life free from
[1:23:25] iniquity never under said hallelujah
[1:23:34] because a foolish virgin still hangs on
[1:23:36] the things they love can't really die
[1:23:38] out don't really get born again can't
[1:23:40] get the victory can't live with a stable
[1:23:42] faithful continual on fire Christian
[1:23:45] life I don't want to be one of those I
[1:23:47] don't want to be a spew out of the mouth
[1:23:48] of Jesus because I'm lukewarm I want to
[1:23:51] be hot on fire for Christ amen that's
[1:23:55] right church I got some brother Aaron on
[1:23:58] the cult brother Madison Satan comes to
[1:24:00] pervert the church and he's all about
[1:24:04] Prevention's well you can still come to
[1:24:07] church and still sin and still love the
[1:24:09] things of the world and still commit
[1:24:10] these evil thing and you're still part
[1:24:12] of our church but innocence God doesn't
[1:24:14] build his church upon perversions he
[1:24:17] said God business church upon
[1:24:18] conversions the Lord's God doesn't make
[1:24:22] perverts God makes converts amen
[1:24:27] hallelujah this is why the reverse
[1:24:31] version is sealed out of the rapture
[1:24:32] because she's not standing on the
[1:24:33] foundational seal that all Christians
[1:24:37] got
[1:24:37] leave all their sins praise God
[1:24:41] has that been made clear now let let me
[1:24:49] get this here this is the Scriptures
[1:24:52] reference and let's read it
[1:24:53] Romans 16:17
[1:24:56] yeah yeah that's what I was mentioned
[1:24:59] earlier here church Paul hands this
[1:25:02] letter there's beautiful letter Romans
[1:25:04] maybe one day we'll preach him series on
[1:25:06] that I still gotta finish Ephesians
[1:25:07] though mercy and I got a finished
[1:25:09] numerology I got a few more to finish up
[1:25:11] here revelation gotta finish up that
[1:25:13] ones you've got a few to finish he said
[1:25:17] now I beseech you brethren mark them
[1:25:18] which cause divisions and offences
[1:25:21] contrary to the doctrine which you have
[1:25:23] learned and avoid them for they do not
[1:25:28] serve our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:29] but their own belly so what God are you
[1:25:31] serving are you serving the God of belly
[1:25:32] or you serving the God of heaven the
[1:25:34] Lord Jesus Christ when people continue
[1:25:38] to sin and do things contrary and offend
[1:25:42] God's people and God's Word when they
[1:25:44] continue to offend the Word of God it
[1:25:46] shows who their God is it's not Jesus
[1:25:48] Christ because if Jesus Christ was your
[1:25:50] God you do the righteous thing and by
[1:25:55] good words and fair speeches they
[1:25:57] deceive the hearts of the simple they
[1:26:00] still talk of real nice a talk and they
[1:26:02] still can say such sweet things but if
[1:26:05] their life is not free from iniquity
[1:26:06] they're not a part of the kingdom of God
[1:26:09] at that time can they be a part of it
[1:26:11] yes jesus said the violent take it by
[1:26:14] force so they got to get all violent in
[1:26:16] the spirit and whether they God do they
[1:26:17] got to kill their own well praise God
[1:26:20] they had to die to their own will that
[1:26:23] they might be born and it comes at the
[1:26:25] right season hallelujah what kind of
[1:26:30] people miss the season four for that the
[1:26:33] people that are lazy right lazy people
[1:26:37] sit when the season comes for them to
[1:26:39] work lazy people sit on the side they
[1:26:41] don't do nothing that's how it is
[1:26:42] spiritually some people are just so
[1:26:43] spiritually lazy they won't kill their
[1:26:46] own desires they won't just lay here at
[1:26:48] the altar
[1:26:49] they just won't lay at the back of the
[1:26:50] chair and just
[1:26:51] God just take it all out of me just rip
[1:26:53] it out of my heart Lord I'll never go
[1:26:56] back to it God give me strength and
[1:26:57] never cuss again or never go back to
[1:27:00] those dirty things again then take it
[1:27:02] all out I want to die they never do that
[1:27:04] and because they never do that they miss
[1:27:06] the time and sees it but you should be
[1:27:08] so happy if you caught God's leading to
[1:27:11] die and be born at the right season amen
[1:27:15] Laurie can you imagine
[1:27:20] people's God is their own belly you can
[1:27:24] see it especially a buffet lines when
[1:27:26] there's a big long line you can see
[1:27:27] whose God is the real God I'm so hungry
[1:27:31] get out of my way you cut in front of me
[1:27:35] what you see who their God is because
[1:27:39] they're fighting for their God it's
[1:27:40] right here their belly right churchy
[1:27:43] that's just the natural example right
[1:27:47] you see how they were they were there
[1:27:50] there I don't they to make themselves
[1:27:52] the idol that's what Satan told Eve oh
[1:27:55] you'll be a God see how the same thing
[1:27:58] that's what he saw did Oh give me pylons
[1:28:01] for my belly okay right there he was his
[1:28:05] own God right he exalted his will so
[1:28:08] prideful so selfish he invited himself
[1:28:10] above the will of God can everybody see
[1:28:16] that
[1:28:17] see we have a choice we have an
[1:28:18] opportunity to it we're the command to
[1:28:20] avoid people that won't live right when
[1:28:22] they've been taught the doctrine and
[1:28:23] they don't live right we have an
[1:28:24] opportunity or we have the command to
[1:28:26] avoid them rather all right let me see
[1:28:34] thanks for closing there just I can kind
[1:28:36] of have a good idea okay yeah I can know
[1:28:41] a few more here yeah now remember but
[1:28:44] the Bible said love not the world
[1:28:45] neither the things there in the world
[1:28:47] If any man love the world the love of
[1:28:48] the father is not in him if we love the
[1:28:53] things of the world and love engaging in
[1:28:55] things that are sinful then God's love
[1:28:57] is not in us even a cuss word church
[1:29:00] even if there's one cuss word on a video
[1:29:03] or a video game or amongst your friends
[1:29:05] if there's even just one class word that
[1:29:07] grieves the Holy Spirit go to James
[1:29:10] chapter one it's in the Bible that's how
[1:29:17] you know if any man this verse 26 if any
[1:29:24] man among you seem to be religious and
[1:29:25] Ralph's not his tongue but to see with
[1:29:28] his own heart this man's religion is in
[1:29:30] vain if someone can't tame their tongue
[1:29:33] they their religion the power of
[1:29:36] Christianity has not taken effect on
[1:29:38] them and so if you love those things if
[1:29:42] you love the things of the world more do
[1:29:44] you love God than the love of God is not
[1:29:45] in you then you haven't died out all the
[1:29:49] ways everybody would ever say what I'm
[1:29:50] saying all the love must be for God's
[1:29:55] Word and then say God died help me to
[1:29:58] die out to not love the things of the
[1:30:00] world that you might live in me Lord I'm
[1:30:02] making my first love oh yes and pure
[1:30:07] religion and undefiled before God and
[1:30:08] the father is this to visit the
[1:30:10] fatherless and widows in their
[1:30:11] affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[1:30:13] from the world that's pure Christianity
[1:30:15] right there in a nutshell what serve
[1:30:18] others and serve God help others and be
[1:30:22] pure before God I mean right that's
[1:30:24] pretty self-explanatory all right now
[1:30:28] let's finish with a second one here give
[1:30:29] me I'll set my timer here for 50 more
[1:30:31] minutes
[1:30:36] and pluck up so in the in the in the
[1:30:41] natural this is what's happening right
[1:30:43] now we're planting some of you were
[1:30:45] planting in Springs anybody plant any
[1:30:46] seeds yet I know my wife's get ready has
[1:30:49] you have your planet oh yeah she's
[1:30:51] playing something already okay so that
[1:30:53] these are opposite seasons will plant in
[1:30:55] March or she'll plant
[1:30:56] I'm not saying me I'm not gonna play
[1:30:58] nothing but in what does it may be
[1:31:02] October you pluck everything up maybe
[1:31:05] September October and somewhere around
[1:31:07] there I'm not sure I'm not getting yes
[1:31:09] or no so anyway
[1:31:12] sometime after harvest that's natural
[1:31:16] but spiritual planting and plucking up
[1:31:20] is seen a few different ways it's seen
[1:31:24] how God planted Israel in the promised
[1:31:26] land but for us God's not interested so
[1:31:28] much in us finding like a country of our
[1:31:32] own in other words God's not trying to
[1:31:34] get us to a physical promised land God
[1:31:36] is trying to get us to a spiritual
[1:31:37] promised land
[1:31:38] the baptism Holy Ghost to possess this
[1:31:42] body to bring this wild body under
[1:31:45] subjection to the Holy Spirit amen this
[1:31:48] is the mountain God once Caleb in this
[1:31:50] hour to overcome is this mountain right
[1:31:52] here this mountain of flesh and sin and
[1:31:55] lustful desires this is the mountain
[1:31:57] that God wants pain in this hour and so
[1:32:01] ministers preaching will plant God's
[1:32:04] Word in your heart and will also pluck
[1:32:08] up if you let it now if you let the
[1:32:11] preacher do it it'll pluck up sins out
[1:32:16] of our lives and let me close with this
[1:32:18] it's a good way to end a sermon I think
[1:32:19] don't you so in the natural the Lord
[1:32:22] spoke of the Moses and the plains of
[1:32:24] Moab by Jordan near Jericho saying speak
[1:32:26] of the children of Israel and say them
[1:32:28] when you have passed for Jordan in the
[1:32:29] land of Canaan
[1:32:30] then you shall drive out all the
[1:32:32] inhabitants of the land from before you
[1:32:33] and destroy all their pictures all their
[1:32:36] pictures on your phone and destroy all
[1:32:39] their molten images and quite pluck down
[1:32:41] all their high places and ye shall
[1:32:43] dispossessed in happening to the land
[1:32:45] and rather and for I've given you the
[1:32:46] land to possess it
[1:32:48] and at what instant I shall speak
[1:32:51] concerning a nation and concerning a
[1:32:52] kingdom to bear out and to plant it so
[1:32:57] this is speaking of course Nehemiah's
[1:32:58] time jeremiah was speaking the future
[1:33:00] Nehemiah's time when god was going to
[1:33:02] plant them back in the promised land if
[1:33:04] it knew evil my sight that it obey not
[1:33:06] my voice then i will repent of the good
[1:33:08] where and i said i would benefit them
[1:33:13] again jeremiah says for i will set my
[1:33:15] eyes upon them for good and I'll bring
[1:33:17] them again to this land and I'll build
[1:33:18] them and not pull them down and I will
[1:33:20] plant them and not pluck them up so even
[1:33:25] when Joshua church remember I preached
[1:33:26] others last year or two years ago when
[1:33:30] Joshua drove out the inhabitants the
[1:33:32] Bible said he was plucking them up so
[1:33:36] when the when the walls of Jericho fell
[1:33:37] down in the spiritual the angels were
[1:33:39] plucking up Jericho and throwing it down
[1:33:41] throwing it out of the promised land so
[1:33:43] I'm gonna plant a holy seed here amen
[1:33:46] these groups have had plenty of time
[1:33:48] four hundred forty years to repent and
[1:33:50] they repented not and God said fire the
[1:33:53] season has passed a buck in Europe you
[1:33:56] haven't brought forth any fruit and I'm
[1:33:57] gonna plant the righteous seed in this
[1:33:59] land okay when they weren't obeying God
[1:34:03] and God had to plug that love to and God
[1:34:06] said okay this was a schoolmaster this
[1:34:08] was just a lesson to teach you what I
[1:34:10] want to do in the spiritual I'm not
[1:34:11] concerned about a natural land I'm
[1:34:13] concerned about a spiritual land amen
[1:34:16] people that will live God not just for a
[1:34:19] few years but live God for all eternity
[1:34:20] praise God I can plant my word in their
[1:34:24] hearts and not just plant them as a
[1:34:26] nation into a land but actually plant my
[1:34:29] word and write my word on the fleshy
[1:34:31] tables of their hearts
[1:34:33] don't you love God's teaching now let's
[1:34:37] go to the spiritual now this is what you
[1:34:39] and I can do today he said see I've now
[1:34:43] God's telling Jeremiah this is what I
[1:34:44] built you for I built you as a preacher
[1:34:46] to do this I ordained before you were
[1:34:49] born in your mother's womb I ordained
[1:34:52] you to root out sin and to pull down and
[1:34:56] destroy and to throw down and build and
[1:34:58] to plant can you imagine that this call
[1:35:02] in life he was supposed to walk in the
[1:35:04] pizza people's spiritual lives and pull
[1:35:06] out the weeds of their lives and you
[1:35:09] know how we'd like to hang on don't you
[1:35:11] church about poor my back every year and
[1:35:14] I put on a pot one of these oh just a
[1:35:16] small tree I'll try to pull this out my
[1:35:17] goodness I'm strong enough to bar this
[1:35:19] little tree and I go about pull out my
[1:35:22] back but the shovel I'm getting kind of
[1:35:25] old I guess but see old habits like to
[1:35:30] hang on but we need something strong to
[1:35:33] dig him out hallelujah and Jeremiah said
[1:35:37] that's why God tell them that's why
[1:35:38] you're born you're born to go in there
[1:35:40] with the sword of God's Word and go
[1:35:42] right to the root of it and dig it out
[1:35:45] and dig it all their lives if you got to
[1:35:47] preach it fifteen minutes free fifteen
[1:35:49] minutes if it takes 15 minutes and they
[1:35:50] got that root bridge 50 minutes if it
[1:35:52] takes half an hour preach half an hour
[1:35:55] if it takes an hour preach it over if it
[1:35:59] takes an hour and a half preaching out
[1:36:00] at half but I'll try not to do that here
[1:36:01] although I'm getting close but see
[1:36:04] however long you are called your
[1:36:07] ordained
[1:36:08] anointed of God to root it out and then
[1:36:11] plant the Word of God in their lives
[1:36:13] that's why you were born glory see
[1:36:18] there's a time and this happens at the
[1:36:20] same time right it's a season to root
[1:36:24] out the old ones and then plant good
[1:36:27] seed in there by the preaching of God's
[1:36:30] Word who then is Paul who's Apollo's but
[1:36:34] ministers by whom he believed even as
[1:36:36] the Lord gave to every man see God God
[1:36:38] gave everyone up to you a preacher I
[1:36:40] know I'm a very small one but God did
[1:36:42] gave you a preacher
[1:36:43] thank God God gave him a preacher in the
[1:36:45] point brother cam God gave a preacher to
[1:36:48] every man those people in Napoleon need
[1:36:52] to hear God's Word through brother cam I
[1:36:54] believe that don't you I believe that he
[1:37:02] said I have planted apollos have watered
[1:37:04] but God gave the increase
[1:37:06] so then neither is he that planteth
[1:37:08] anything see the preachers don't really
[1:37:10] nothing they're just planting God's seed
[1:37:11] God's seed is what has the power
[1:37:14] amen
[1:37:15] there's not power in a preacher there's
[1:37:17] power and God's word amen
[1:37:19] but preacher still gotta do their job
[1:37:22] that God that gives the increase now he
[1:37:25] that planteth and he that watereth or
[1:37:26] one and every man shall receive his own
[1:37:28] reward according to his own labor for we
[1:37:30] are laborers together with God you are
[1:37:32] God's husbandry ye are God's building
[1:37:35] sea but what's his foundation that we
[1:37:38] depart from iniquity that's the
[1:37:41] foundation of God's building start by
[1:37:43] hating sin dying out to sin praise God
[1:37:46] and building your life upon
[1:37:49] righteousness and holiness in the fear
[1:37:50] of God that's right I love this then
[1:37:56] came his disciples and said to him
[1:37:58] notice the other though the Pharisees
[1:38:00] were offended after they heard you're
[1:38:01] saying but yes he don't you know that
[1:38:03] you heard them denominations feeling by
[1:38:05] preaching on them but he answered and
[1:38:07] said every plant with my father have not
[1:38:09] planted shall be rooted up let them
[1:38:13] alone they be blind leaders of the blind
[1:38:16] and if the blind fall the ditch both
[1:38:18] shall fall into the ditch see when we
[1:38:22] offend people church it depends did we
[1:38:24] do it with the Spirit of God or did we
[1:38:26] do it with a fleshly prideful spirit if
[1:38:28] I offend somebody in Pride I'm wrong
[1:38:30] I've got to repent but if I preach God's
[1:38:33] Word out of love to try to save people
[1:38:35] to get them to repent then they need to
[1:38:37] repent not me because I already repented
[1:38:41] praise God but ya can a preacher have a
[1:38:45] bad attitude
[1:38:45] yeah and preacher can say it the wrong
[1:38:47] way but hear Jesus saying when he
[1:38:50] preaches the word and it offends people
[1:38:52] that's not his fault and if they don't
[1:38:55] obey it we got to just let them go let
[1:38:57] the blind lead the blind Hebrews says
[1:39:03] follow peace with all men
[1:39:04] and holiness without which no man should
[1:39:06] see the Lord looking diligently lest any
[1:39:08] man fail the grace of God lest any root
[1:39:10] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[1:39:14] and thereby many be defiled
[1:39:19] so some people will let roots of
[1:39:22] bitterness in the let sin take anchor
[1:39:25] and grow its roots in their heart and
[1:39:27] when the preacher comes they won't let
[1:39:29] that word root out that root of
[1:39:31] bitterness they'll remain bitter they'll
[1:39:33] remain angry and they'll let that go and
[1:39:35] with they let that go it defiles the
[1:39:37] ground of their heart is that right
[1:39:40] church that's why every church service
[1:39:43] is so important because in between
[1:39:45] church services who likes to throw evil
[1:39:48] seeds upon your heart Satan oh you know
[1:39:52] you and I know Oh Sunday's such a
[1:39:54] glorious day it is no I don't have many
[1:39:57] battles on Sunday thank God for the
[1:39:59] victory brother Haman gets that song
[1:40:01] playing we get to shout and praise You
[1:40:03] God clever not many battles on Sunday oh
[1:40:05] but bring Monday around on Tuesday or
[1:40:08] Thursday morning or Friday of a haunting
[1:40:10] or Saturday and that's the time Satan
[1:40:13] will trying to plant that root of
[1:40:15] bitterness in there and that's why we
[1:40:17] got to come to church and let it get
[1:40:18] wheat and while it's a real small
[1:40:19] problem that doesn't become this life
[1:40:23] defiling life altering life defining
[1:40:27] problem in our lives let's stand to our
[1:40:31] feet here this is I think the last one
[1:40:35] yep last one well praise the Lord and
[1:40:38] brothers have a music musicians if you
[1:40:40] want to come you can start playing
[1:40:42] something here so I'm ending this with
[1:40:45] repentance because that's what this is
[1:40:48] let me go back there one time before
[1:40:50] Reedus plant and pluck up planting and
[1:40:57] King up and Church this planning and
[1:41:01] plucking up this applies to everyone
[1:41:02] right you can't say well I've been in
[1:41:06] the message ten years I've almost been
[1:41:07] in the message almost twenty years
[1:41:08] almost I think I'm at eighteen no I
[1:41:10] can't say well I've been to the message
[1:41:12] eighteen years I'll never have a root of
[1:41:14] bitterness because I'm saved
[1:41:15] no we've all seen people have been the
[1:41:18] message a long time and they get roots
[1:41:21] of bitterness so see that's why this
[1:41:24] seasonal teaching by Solomon is so
[1:41:26] inspired for today there's a time for
[1:41:30] you to die to sin be born of God and
[1:41:32] there's a time to let the word of God be
[1:41:35] planted and a time to pluck up many
[1:41:37] roots of bitterness or sin
[1:41:39] how many can see that today you see how
[1:41:42] this is so inspired in it can anybody
[1:41:44] else see the inspiration behind in
[1:41:45] Solomon's writing by this is beautiful
[1:41:47] this is like a whole new world
[1:41:50] it's like a whole understanding mind I'm
[1:41:53] following in one of these fourteen
[1:41:55] seasons at this right now right now
[1:41:57] Church this may be a season of your life
[1:42:03] where you let things grow up roots of
[1:42:06] little bitterness or roots of
[1:42:07] disagreements have grown up but
[1:42:10] thankfully glory at the same time it was
[1:42:15] time to pluck up was also a time to
[1:42:16] plant God's Word there that grounds not
[1:42:20] going to remain just barren glory
[1:42:22] there's a seed hallelujah to planted in
[1:42:25] that old weeds place thank God for that
[1:42:27] amen but first the root of bitterness
[1:42:32] the root of any sin needs to be plucked
[1:42:34] up and then God's Word needs to be
[1:42:38] planted there and then it needs to be
[1:42:40] watered with praise during the worship
[1:42:42] circuit is a yeah
[1:42:45] thank the Lord amen it's so true look
[1:42:51] what the word says you said bringing
[1:42:53] forth therefore fruits meet for
[1:42:55] repentance and think not to say within
[1:42:57] yourselves we have brother Branham to be
[1:42:59] our father can I just put that in there
[1:43:02] he is a father of our message Paul said
[1:43:06] I was a father to you Jesus said call no
[1:43:08] man father but that meant like a worship
[1:43:10] but Paul said I have become a father to
[1:43:13] you because I appreciated the Word of
[1:43:14] God brother random is the father for
[1:43:17] this church age so don't say well I
[1:43:20] believe brother Adam was a prophet a lot
[1:43:23] of people are saying that God is able to
[1:43:27] raise up these Thrones children under
[1:43:29] brother Rams message right and now also
[1:43:37] the axe is laid to the root of the tree
[1:43:42] therefore every tree which bringeth not
[1:43:44] forth good fruit is hewn down and cast
[1:43:46] in the fire what is repentance it's the
[1:43:49] stopping the sin repentance is uprooting
[1:43:53] the sin I am done with this I'm I'm
[1:43:58] letting the Holy Spirit dig this out I'm
[1:44:01] dying to this and I want God's Word
