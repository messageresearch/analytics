[18:22] looking at it um so let's go to
[18:25] uh ephesians 5 10 let's go to ephesians
[18:27] 5 10.
[18:30] read our text and then we'll just take a
[18:31] few prayer requests we'll just kind of
[18:32] put those together
[18:38] i was telling amen i'd like to get uh
[18:39] started on this music series before i
[18:41] got a break you know because i don't
[18:42] want to put it off too long
[18:44] i kind of want to just get started on it
[18:45] right now tonight
[18:47] and just be honest i haven't had or
[18:50] haven't made
[18:51] too much time to study into it so i'm
[18:53] just at the beginning of the study
[18:55] and i'll share some resources you know
[18:57] and references and
[18:59] things that i'm studying so you can
[19:01] understand too
[19:02] kind of where i'm coming from but
[19:04] anyways ephesians 5.
[19:05] looking forward to this study it's i
[19:07] believe it's going to be a real blessing
[19:09] um brother ben around he showed it back
[19:11] in 2016. you remember that brother it
[19:12] was over there
[19:13] so i was listening that today what a
[19:14] wonderful message that was boy that was
[19:16] a shout message
[19:18] that was glorious i was like wow the
[19:20] lord has blessed us richly with some
[19:22] wonderful nuggets and just treasures the
[19:26] bible calls them treasures
[19:28] ephesians 5 verse 10
[19:34] let's read verse 10 together one two
[19:38] three proving what is acceptable
[19:41] unto the lord now this is not in context
[19:44] about music but later on in the chapter
[19:46] it is so go down if you would to verse
[19:49] 18
[19:50] i'll read 18 and then we'll read 19
[19:52] together so let me read 18.
[19:54] be not drunk with wine wearing is it is
[19:56] excess
[19:57] but be filled with the spirit now
[19:59] remember we preached on this not long
[20:00] ago with the ephesians series
[20:02] how do you how are you filled with the
[20:03] spirit verse 19 says it let's read it
[20:05] together
[20:06] one two three speaking to yourselves
[20:10] in psalms and hymns and spiritual
[20:13] songs singing and making melody
[20:16] in your heart to the lord praise god so
[20:19] we see we've got to prove what is
[20:21] what god likes right and everything got
[20:23] to prove what god likes
[20:25] and then you have to walk in the spirit
[20:26] by singing and worshiping and speaking
[20:28] to yourselves and
[20:30] even yourself encouraging yourself in
[20:32] the lord like we saw with david last
[20:33] week
[20:34] so let's have a word of prayer let's
[20:36] remember these needs here

[23:09] comes in and father bless us here
[23:11] tonight take this word that i read
[23:12] i pray lord you'll bless it to our
[23:14] hearts in jesus christ's name
[23:15] and saint said amen god bless you as
[23:18] you're being seated there
[23:22] i do have a few quotes i'd like to share
[23:24] and some slides here so let me
[23:26] switch over by god's grace
[23:29] uh i like to get started on this music
[23:31] series here before
[23:32] uh i get a break um
[23:37] so let's look at this uh tonight by
[23:38] god's grace it's coming up i don't know
[23:40] why it's loaded again but
[23:41] i'd like to look at uh
[23:45] we'll see how long we do this uh but
[23:47] really want to look at music and i've
[23:48] had numerous questions about it over
[23:51] i guess i'd say the last six months or
[23:52] so and we just want to look at it and
[23:55] take a few services on it you know my
[23:56] wife asked me how many i thought well
[23:57] maybe four
[23:58] we'll see how many and let me just be
[24:01] first to say i am no music expert
[24:04] i think everybody knows that here right
[24:06] alki and lydia will tell me
[24:08] we'll tell you a hundred times more than
[24:10] i can tell you about music and
[24:11] they meant probably a thousand more then
[24:13] i could tell you about music as far as
[24:14] uh
[24:15] you know notes and scales and all those
[24:18] words i was listening to brother ben
[24:20] rod's sermon he's saying words i don't
[24:22] even know you know so
[24:24] but anyways i just want to bring out the
[24:26] word and i want to get to the spot where
[24:28] we feel
[24:29] uh content with our music because
[24:32] there's so many questions that come to
[24:33] us
[24:34] you know especially but amen as a song
[24:35] leader and to me the pastor because i'm
[24:37] i'm head over everything the pastor's
[24:39] sovereign over this church
[24:40] just this church no other churches i'm
[24:42] just a sovereign over here just like a
[24:44] shepherd is sovereign over his
[24:46] flock right a husband is sovereign over
[24:48] his wife right
[24:49] you know god has order and so i've got
[24:52] to answer for
[24:52] the music and uh for the amen and but
[24:55] mainly me you know as a pastor and each
[24:57] family's got to answer for what they
[24:58] allow in their homes and
[25:00] and so uh every every preacher every
[25:02] home church has to answer for that
[25:04] so i want to be faithful to the lord and
[25:05] i want to um uh know the truth i know
[25:08] the truth will set me free praise god
[25:10] so let's look here tonight uh like i
[25:12] said the thoughts will probably be all
[25:13] over the place because i just really got
[25:16] deep down studying it this today this
[25:18] morning this afternoon
[25:19] as far as deep really hammered down in
[25:21] there to try to get some thoughts so
[25:24] um we wanted to call this god's
[25:26] acceptable music
[25:28] because we know there's a kind of music
[25:30] that god accepts and then there's a kind
[25:31] of music god does not accept
[25:34] right and i just had a few thoughts open
[25:35] up to my heart but
[25:37] i imagine we'll get to them here as my
[25:39] outline goes on so
[25:41] let's look at god's acceptable music so
[25:43] our text was uh
[25:44] our first one was ephesians 5 10.
[25:47] and it says proving was it what is
[25:49] acceptable unto the lord and that that
[25:51] greek word just means well pleasing
[25:54] so there's music that pleases the holy
[25:56] spirit right
[25:57] uh and and we want to be able to find
[25:59] that right because in this context this
[26:01] scripture wasn't about music but then
[26:03] shortly after
[26:04] it was about music uh and then we know
[26:06] first
[26:07] thessalonians 5 23 right right we
[26:09] probably got that memorized
[26:10] prove all things right hold fast that
[26:12] which is good we probably got that
[26:13] memorized in such a short verse
[26:15] and we ought to because we did the prove
[26:17] all things series
[26:19] okay but i want to just take this
[26:20] approach that the bible says prove all
[26:22] things
[26:23] and in a world where there's so much
[26:26] uh access to music now like new music
[26:29] right
[26:29] we've never had more with spotify and
[26:32] apple music
[26:33] and youtube and just the internet in
[26:35] general we've never had access to so
[26:37] much
[26:38] music before it used to be you had to
[26:39] get on a cd
[26:41] if somebody had to give you a cd or a
[26:42] cassette tape when i was growing up
[26:44] we would burn them on cassette tapes you
[26:46] know i remember recording off the radio
[26:48] i thought that was a big thing to do you
[26:49] know
[26:49] on cassette tape of course it was all
[26:51] evil music sadly but
[26:53] um the point is there's so much music
[26:55] now and uh
[26:56] and it's it's also prophetic as you
[26:57] probably remember you know uh brother
[26:59] man tells us shadrach meshach and
[27:01] abednego
[27:01] we'll preach on this eventually but
[27:03] right before uh their last test was
[27:05] music
[27:06] when the music played they had to bow
[27:08] down to the image
[27:10] right uh and that the music told them
[27:13] when to bow down right so the music
[27:16] leads people
[27:17] into worship either the true worship or
[27:20] the wrong worship well our music is
[27:21] going to lead us into true worship by
[27:23] god's grace
[27:24] it always does amen hallelujah i believe
[27:27] that
[27:28] but we know the world right if that's a
[27:29] type of the end of the gentile
[27:32] dispensation or gentile times of the
[27:34] gentiles
[27:35] gentile church ages then it would be the
[27:38] false music would lead sinners
[27:40] into worshipping a man right because it
[27:43] was
[27:44] worshiping one image an image of a man
[27:46] right but shadrach meshach and abednego
[27:48] said
[27:48] you can do whatever you want to our
[27:50] bodies you can do whatever our you can
[27:52] torture us whatever you want
[27:53] i don't know if god's going to save me i
[27:54] don't have a guarantee i don't have a
[27:56] thus saith the lord on a miracle
[27:57] but one thing's for sure i only worship
[27:59] jesus amen
[28:01] and then jesus come and stood with him
[28:02] in the fire praise god amen
[28:04] proving that if you stand with jesus
[28:06] he'll stand with you amen
[28:08] amen hallelujah so uh it is there is
[28:11] a prophetic element to music and it
[28:13] makes sense because
[28:14] jesus said it's going to be so close it
[28:16] deceived the very elected if it were
[28:18] possible
[28:19] so we know there's never been a time
[28:21] where the music will be as close
[28:23] to being true as this time
[28:27] and so we've got to be able to rightly
[28:29] divide the song
[28:31] okay and the songs and what's what's
[28:33] being said and everything uh and the
[28:35] lyrics and
[28:36] the rhythm and the style now all some of
[28:38] these words i don't even really
[28:39] understand them so
[28:40] i'm just going with what i've been
[28:42] reading and what i've been hearing so
[28:44] just bear with me we'll see how far we
[28:45] can get tonight i want to set my timer
[28:47] here yeah
[28:47] because i want to have enough time here
[28:48] to worship at the end as well worship
[28:50] and praise the lord
[28:52] all right so here's some questions i'm
[28:54] going to answer
[28:55] not today uh but probably in the future
[28:58] so the first one there
[28:59] i wanna these are all come up all these
[29:02] have come up in conversations i've had
[29:04] with preachers or brothers or something
[29:06] like that
[29:07] um so this is one i had with a preacher
[29:09] lately and i love the preacher
[29:11] is it wrong to sing a song if the song
[29:13] doesn't tell the full gospel story
[29:15] so this preacher had an interesting
[29:16] point i never heard it before he said
[29:18] he said like i can only imagine right by
[29:20] mercy me
[29:21] so the preacher was saying it's only
[29:23] about going to heaven so
[29:25] they were saying there's nothing about
[29:26] you know getting saved repenting getting
[29:29] baptized filled with the holy spirit
[29:31] now my first thought is no my first
[29:32] thought is i think it's okay just to
[29:34] have one song
[29:35] or a song just about going to heaven
[29:37] right that's just my
[29:39] that's my thought right now to me i've
[29:41] always liked that song
[29:42] now i don't like the version mercy me
[29:44] does because they crank it up and
[29:46] some of the versions have electric
[29:48] guitar and it sounds like rock and roll
[29:49] but i like how we sing it right because
[29:52] we take out all the worldliness
[29:54] right and that's that's part of this
[29:56] proving what's acceptable to god
[29:58] now some people amen may totally
[29:59] disagree with me on that and that's okay
[30:01] i can love them back
[30:03] but i don't i don't see i believe we
[30:05] have the liberty of the holy spirit
[30:07] to look at a song and if it's scriptural
[30:09] we can apply
[30:10] we can sing it and we can appreciate
[30:12] what it says
[30:14] and if if if you know worldly christians
[30:16] make it rock and roll
[30:17] i believe we have the wisdom and the
[30:19] ability and the right
[30:21] to take out the worldliness and sing it
[30:23] the way it should have been
[30:25] inspired at the at the beginning praise
[30:26] god right because if the lyrics are good
[30:29] if the lyrics are godly
[30:32] then the inspiration behind it was right
[30:34] but what they do they mixed a little
[30:36] rock and roll in there the wrong
[30:37] inspiration praise god
[30:39] right so see we gotta it's just like
[30:41] david david had the right leading to
[30:43] bring the ark back right with dancing
[30:45] and worshiping
[30:46] but he got off the word a little bit
[30:48] right he put it on the car
[30:50] he put it on the cart of the ox rather
[30:51] than on the shoulders of levites
[30:53] so church many times people get i
[30:55] believe that's an inspired song i love
[30:56] that song i've wept to that song i've
[30:58] i've cried to that song i praise god to
[31:00] that song
[31:01] but uh the reality is is uh the
[31:04] inspiration can come but if
[31:06] if you're not totally faithful with it
[31:07] you'll inject some other false
[31:09] inspiration to it
[31:10] just like a sermon you can get a good
[31:12] servant i could get a good sermon from
[31:13] god but then i can inject some thought
[31:15] in it that's not pleasing to god
[31:17] okay so that's my first thought on that
[31:20] the second one is it wrong just if the
[31:22] song
[31:24] it just has simple repetitive lyrics
[31:26] we'll get more into that
[31:27] i need some more examples of that one
[31:29] okay
[31:30] um so you know it kind of depends on
[31:34] your age right if you're a little child
[31:35] you think jesus loves me this side now
[31:38] or the bible tells me so and you know
[31:40] you kind of keep it like a
[31:41] it's a keep it a simple song right but i
[31:44] think the people are kind of like
[31:45] criticizing like
[31:46] uh you know like a chris tomlin song
[31:48] that maybe would just say something over
[31:50] and over again or a hillsong
[31:51] song where they might repeat something
[31:52] over again um that's something i gotta
[31:55] look into i
[31:56] i don't know too many songs though that
[31:58] are that repetitive
[32:00] so to me that that criticism i don't
[32:02] know if i totally agree with that one
[32:04] all the time
[32:05] um you know i'd have to see some
[32:06] examples of that okay
[32:09] now some people again say you know
[32:10] what's a simple song it just talks about
[32:12] the cross and the blood
[32:13] well what's more important than the
[32:14] cross the blood church what's more
[32:17] important than the cross
[32:18] and who does in this day who doesn't
[32:20] need a good reminder about the cross and
[32:21] the blood
[32:22] praise god amen because the member of
[32:24] the bible said if we don't grow in the
[32:26] statue of perfect man what'd the bible
[32:27] say
[32:28] you'll forget you were forgiven
[32:31] see and we have we have the age of the
[32:33] greatest deception today
[32:35] right so satan's trying to deceive
[32:37] people to get their minds off the cross
[32:39] make them feel they're not saved they're
[32:41] not forgiven that's why i love some of
[32:42] those songs
[32:43] they're refreshing praise god i get to
[32:45] talk about the cross and sing about the
[32:47] blood praise god
[32:48] being forgiven praise god the love ran
[32:51] red i love that song praise god my
[32:53] there's a place where where mercy reigns
[32:56] amen
[32:56] hallelujah and sin is powerless amen
[32:59] i think that's beautiful now are those
[33:03] people's lives right
[33:04] no you know people that write some of
[33:06] these songs these
[33:07] modern songs are their lives right not
[33:10] exactly
[33:11] well let's not judge them and send them
[33:12] to hell just yet right
[33:14] because jesus said however you judge
[33:16] them they'll judge you
[33:17] right jesus will judge you the same way
[33:20] so you've got to be careful
[33:22] third and this is one i might i may i
[33:24] may even get to this tonight i think
[33:25] you'll like it if you haven't heard it
[33:27] uh was the fast song because some people
[33:29] say oh you can't sing a very fast song
[33:31] in the message or well brother branham's
[33:33] saying or brother bran was there
[33:35] and listened to a very fast song called
[33:36] i was there when the spirit came
[33:38] and he called it a nice spiritual lift
[33:41] and i i might have time to play it
[33:42] tonight we'll see
[33:44] we'll see how it goes
[33:47] i may have to get something else here so
[33:50] malachi can you go get my ipad it's in
[33:51] my
[33:52] gray bag here so i i'll need another
[33:54] device to play it okay
[33:56] that's okay i need you to get my ipad
[33:58] because i need the phone to show the
[33:59] slides
[34:00] okay now and fourthly this is something
[34:02] i've just studied a little bit
[34:04] uh brother graham's daughter rebecca
[34:05] branham wrote an article in 1992 about
[34:08] music
[34:08] uh it's been very well received by
[34:10] people i've not read all of it i was
[34:12] skimming through it a little bit when i
[34:13] was studying
[34:14] i didn't get a chance to read all of it
[34:16] um
[34:19] but she seems to say uh is she
[34:22] her point she seems to make at least in
[34:23] one paragraph is in order for the song
[34:25] to be
[34:26] godly it has to be the right rhythm
[34:28] thank you
[34:29] uh the right lyrics and the the person
[34:31] who sings it has to have the right
[34:33] lifestyle now that's where i may
[34:34] disagree a little bit like i said
[34:36] because someone who doesn't serve god
[34:39] faithfully
[34:40] can still get inspiration from god if
[34:42] that's their gift right
[34:43] if their gift is to write songs which
[34:46] thank god for that
[34:47] because the bible said we need new songs
[34:48] amen thank god for that
[34:51] uh but if they get inspiration from a
[34:54] godly song yet they don't live a
[34:55] life does that mean we get rid of the
[34:56] song the inspiration from god i don't
[34:58] believe so
[35:00] i believe we got to take that into
[35:01] consideration you got to look at their
[35:03] lifestyle right
[35:05] um but i don't believe just because
[35:07] someone who was inspired to do something
[35:09] supernatural
[35:10] we can't accept anything they say if
[35:12] they have the wrong lifestyle
[35:14] like brother ram said right you take the
[35:16] uh you don't if you're eating cherry pie
[35:18] and you hit a
[35:19] cherry you don't spit out the pie just
[35:20] spit out the cherry
[35:22] right take what's inspired from that
[35:24] person who wrote it but then
[35:25] you know like the song shout to the lord
[35:27] it was by that uh
[35:29] wonderful i should say wonderful
[35:31] songwriter but she cuts her hair and
[35:32] wears makeup
[35:33] well almost every church sings shout to
[35:35] the lord it's a great song
[35:37] i don't agree with their lifestyle but
[35:39] it's an inspired song praise god it's a
[35:41] beautiful song
[35:44] and so people were doing that in the 90s
[35:45] why can't they do it now you know so
[35:46] it's
[35:47] it's just uh it's strange you know what
[35:49] people why people go so far on some of
[35:51] these things but it's okay
[35:52] we're still gonna love everybody we're
[35:54] gonna stand where we stand we're happy
[35:55] to serve the lord
[35:56] and we want the spirit of god in our
[35:57] church we want music to accomplish
[35:59] everything it should praise god
[36:01] oh there's so much you can do praise god
[36:02] it can teach us it can cast out devils
[36:05] it can deliver us praise god
[36:06] there's so much it can connect us to god
[36:08] amen there's so much music and do we
[36:11] want all the benefits
[36:12] of music praise god amen
[36:15] now here's some of the topics i'm going
[36:17] to teach eventually i'll probably go
[36:18] back and listen to ben narada and some
[36:20] other ones
[36:20] the history of rock and roll we will
[36:22] eventually get to that not tonight
[36:23] how music affects the mind and body
[36:25] bender rod did a nice job on that
[36:28] how it affects your mind and body um
[36:32] and then uh music is the approach to war
[36:34] that's
[36:35] that's that was a very sermon topic of
[36:37] brother ben
[36:38] okay so here's the three references i've
[36:40] i've spent the most time on so far i
[36:42] forgot to put up sister branham on there
[36:44] so
[36:44] let me do that next here in just a
[36:46] minute um so the first one was brother
[36:48] ben that's when i listened to today um
[36:51] replica branham smith
[36:55] and her article was called uh music the
[36:58] sound
[36:58] and unsound 1992
[37:02] okay so you won't you won't see it now
[37:03] but it'll be on here later
[37:05] okay and then the seven part series i
[37:07] listened to that this week i listened to
[37:08] all that
[37:09] it's only like a couple hours it's not
[37:10] that long um he does a nice job on it
[37:13] there's a few things i disagree with
[37:14] like he seems to be against anything
[37:15] that's a little bit fast but
[37:17] i kind of like fast songs i love him
[37:20] praise god
[37:20] and brother brahm liked him amen he
[37:22] called him a spiritual lift as we'll see
[37:24] and then the 10 part series distraction
[37:27] dilemma i think i shared with brother
[37:29] amen but
[37:30] uh it's been a while since i've watched
[37:31] it it's been a while and that guy's a
[37:33] seventh day adventist he
[37:34] has a lot of good points though i
[37:35] remember watching that that's like a 12
[37:37] hour series
[37:39] because each part is over an hour and
[37:41] now he does a real thorough job
[37:43] and i like a lot of what he does of
[37:45] course i don't believe in the seventh
[37:46] day like they do the
[37:48] saturday sabbath i don't believe in that
[37:50] but again you just take you spit out the
[37:51] spit out the seeds and just take what's
[37:53] good and then uh sister rebecca branham
[37:55] smith the late rebecca branham
[37:57] uh she wrote that article i'll be
[37:58] studying that as well
[38:01] okay so uh three important truths i just
[38:03] want to look at briefly here tonight
[38:05] uh we have three important duties that i
[38:07] found in regards to music
[38:09] i guess i could put a fourth one got to
[38:11] sing a new song so let me add that one
[38:13] there
[38:13] we go we have to introduce new songs uh
[38:17] so introduce uh new songs
[38:22] okay so uh first prove what pleases god
[38:25] now this includes the lyrics
[38:27] uh the rhythm of the song now you could
[38:29] put in there beat
[38:31] uh style i don't know i don't know all
[38:33] the words i'm not sure how they're
[38:34] different you know
[38:36] i don't know but we'll look at that
[38:37] eventually a second uh
[38:40] another duty is to create the right
[38:41] atmosphere so our music
[38:43] has to create the right atmosphere so in
[38:45] other words when we do song service
[38:47] we should feel people happier right we
[38:49] should feel people being blessed
[38:51] we should hear people shouting clapping
[38:54] saying praise the lord amen
[38:56] i mean we should have that like we
[38:58] should have the songs that produce the
[39:00] right atmosphere
[39:01] how many times have i been tired and i
[39:02] just get out here and hear by the amen
[39:04] sing and
[39:04] i'm all energized again honestly church
[39:07] it literally
[39:08] changes the state of your mind amen it
[39:11] literally
[39:12] refreshes you that's the power of music
[39:14] amen it's supposed to do that that's
[39:16] what brother ben
[39:17] the rod was showing on that sermon you
[39:20] have two parts of your brain one side is
[39:21] think think think
[39:22] the other one is more creative well when
[39:24] you start singing you get away from the
[39:25] think and the worry
[39:27] and the stress and and you get that
[39:29] other side and it refreshes your mind
[39:31] because you stop worrying and thinking
[39:32] all the time
[39:33] you just get focused on the power of god
[39:35] the love of god
[39:36] the mercy of god how great god is amen
[39:39] you just you just get outside of that
[39:41] that thinking and that all that constant
[39:43] thought thought and stress
[39:44] and you and you get into the attitude
[39:46] and the place of worship praise god
[39:49] amen and then thirdly uh
[39:53] identify the meaning of sounds and this
[39:55] is going to probably be the most
[39:56] technical part
[39:58] uh like every sound has a meaning the
[40:02] bible says
[40:03] so we really got to find out what are
[40:04] the sounds in rock music we got to kind
[40:06] of
[40:07] figure out what are the sounds now we
[40:10] can we can
[40:10] tell right now but i don't know how to
[40:12] define it like i can listen to a song
[40:14] and say oh it's got too much irrelevant
[40:15] electric guitar
[40:16] but then you can have a song that has a
[40:18] nice electric guitar
[40:20] right uh so we got to be
[40:24] able to def define the meaning of the
[40:26] sounds right we got to say well
[40:28] that's too much here that's well that
[40:30] beats too heavy
[40:31] or that that percussion is too too much
[40:34] you know you got to
[40:34] we got to be able to identify the sounds
[40:38] praise god and fourth is introduce
[40:41] new sounds or not sorry new songs but i
[40:43] don't have that
[40:44] on here the bible says sing to the lord
[40:46] a new song
[40:48] all right so let's look at a few
[40:49] scriptures here uh by god's grace
[40:52] i'm going to type in real quick new song
[40:55] okay there's nine of them all right okay
[40:58] so
[40:59] so the first one we have can prove it
[41:00] pleases god we read this in our text now
[41:02] the context
[41:03] is we are children of light and we're no
[41:06] longer in darkness so because we're in
[41:08] the light
[41:08] we can prove what something is because
[41:10] we can see it
[41:12] right you were sometimes darkness but
[41:14] now you are light amen
[41:16] not only do i have the light but i am
[41:18] the light praise god hallelujah
[41:20] we speak the light we are we're a city
[41:22] on a hill a light that cannot be hidden
[41:24] praise god
[41:27] uh we walk as children of light for the
[41:30] fruit of the spirit is in all goodness
[41:31] and righteousness and truth
[41:33] proving what is acceptable unto the lord
[41:35] and have no fellowship in other words
[41:37] don't partake
[41:38] with the unfruitful works of darkness in
[41:40] this case with rock music
[41:42] rap and now the reason i'm not going to
[41:44] bring up rap very much is because we
[41:45] don't get in the rap right we
[41:46] we're not going to battle rap right you
[41:48] know we're not going to
[41:50] a lot of church at least you know uh
[41:52] we're not going to battle country music
[41:53] at church right
[41:54] the one right we're after that we i'll
[41:56] have to watch out myself is just the
[41:58] rock we got to watch out for the rock
[41:59] because that was the vision brother
[42:00] graham saul too remember that church the
[42:02] vision he saw
[42:03] uh of the preview of the bride the
[42:05] american bride was dancing to rock and
[42:07] roll
[42:08] and then he had to cry out and then when
[42:09] the true bride came some of them got
[42:11] online he said get back in line
[42:13] so i don't know if it was music inspired
[42:14] off to look at the vision again
[42:16] but remember rock and roll was what
[42:18] satan was going to use through albus
[42:20] presley brother abraham said
[42:21] to bring rock and roll to the church and
[42:23] my mom is a witness she's lived to see
[42:25] it sadly
[42:26] she said now they never had it before in
[42:28] the 1950s 60s 70s
[42:30] and now her denomination they go they do
[42:32] hip hop rap and jazz
[42:34] everything at their denominational youth
[42:36] group so my mom is a witness when i told
[42:38] her
[42:38] i said mom uh i said brother ram had a
[42:41] vision that the church was dancing to
[42:42] rock and roll i said you better get out
[42:43] of that denomination
[42:45] and she said my denomination's going
[42:47] down the tubes she said so she can
[42:48] recognize it
[42:50] okay but we can't be a partaker uh with
[42:53] the unfruitful works of darkness but
[42:55] rather
[42:56] reprove them so we are supposed to
[42:57] correct the children of darkness
[43:00] now the best we can right and the best
[43:02] way to do it is not preach him a sermon
[43:04] but live him a sermon praise god
[43:06] and if you get a chance to preach it
[43:07] then preach it to him or testify to him
[43:09] sisters
[43:10] right if you get a chance but you might
[43:12] not so you have to let your life
[43:14] speak so loudly that they can't even
[43:15] hear what you're saying because you're
[43:17] living
[43:17] such a holy life praise god amen i found
[43:20] that the longer i've gone on
[43:21] the fewer people want to talk about the
[43:23] lord it's harder harder and harder when
[43:24] to talk about the lord and now with the
[43:26] six feet of distance and everybody's
[43:27] staying home there's even less people
[43:28] out there
[43:30] you even have less people around so we
[43:32] got to use some more digital right we
[43:33] got to use the digital and youtube and
[43:34] our texting we got to
[43:36] we got to do that more by god's grace
[43:38] okay so we can prove what pleases god
[43:40] now next
[43:41] uh the bible said uh the right music
[43:43] brings the right spirit so the bible
[43:45] says if you want to be filled to the
[43:46] spirit or fill with the spirit rather
[43:48] speak to yourselves i have to look up
[43:51] this word i didn't look it up yet
[43:53] but speak to yourselves i don't know if
[43:54] that means speak to yourself
[43:57] like encourage yourself or if it means
[43:59] like tell brother am or tell amen or
[44:01] tell
[44:02] you need to tell your brother a good
[44:03] song in the lord i'm not sure which one
[44:05] it means
[44:06] imagine maybe both right because you got
[44:08] to create an atmosphere in your life and
[44:09] you got to
[44:10] right you got to break out of your mind
[44:12] battles right and you do that many ways
[44:13] by singing
[44:14] praise god because singing is an
[44:17] invitation
[44:18] channel that's the power of music it is
[44:21] an invitation
[44:23] to open yourself up to god or the devil
[44:26] amen
[44:27] that that's what i've realized when we
[44:29] sing and when we get into worship it's
[44:31] opening up
[44:32] it's opening a space it's opening our
[44:34] minds and it's opening a space in our
[44:36] church for the holy spirit to come down
[44:38] and dwell amen
[44:39] you don't believe that go to psalm 22.
[44:42] hopefully everybody believes that
[44:44] i guess i'm preaching to the people on
[44:45] the livestream here on that point
[44:48] psalm 22 1
[44:51] let's believe that with all of our
[44:52] hearts praise god singing is your
[44:55] it's your chance to open yourself up to
[44:57] god
[44:59] satan uses it of course for his tactics
[45:02] but it's it's your channel so when you
[45:03] start singing anything gotta be careful
[45:05] what we sing
[45:06] we're opening ourselves up
[45:13] all right
[45:17] now this is interesting verse one is uh
[45:19] jesus's prayer on the cross david wrote
[45:20] that
[45:21] a thousand years before christ uh go
[45:23] down to verse two
[45:24] oh my god i cry in the daytime but thou
[45:26] hearst not and in the night season
[45:28] and am not silent but thou
[45:31] art holy oh thou that inhabitest the
[45:34] praises
[45:36] of his people our fathers trusted in
[45:38] thee they
[45:39] trusted and thou didst deliver them they
[45:41] cried unto thee and were
[45:42] delivered they trusted in thee and were
[45:44] not confounded
[45:46] so see he inhabits he lives in praises
[45:50] so when we start singing god is using
[45:53] amen to get trying to get us to open up
[45:55] a door right
[45:55] open up a door and say jesus come and
[45:58] dwell in my mind
[45:59] come fill my mind right now so i can
[46:01] forget about the things of the world
[46:03] i want you to inhabit my mind praise god
[46:06] amen i want you to dwell in my thoughts
[46:08] i want you to take all control of my
[46:10] mind
[46:11] so that once once brother amen gets in
[46:13] the spirit week in the spirit then when
[46:14] the preaching comes i can receive that
[46:16] too praise god
[46:17] amen right but many people don't receive
[46:19] the preaching because they don't get in
[46:20] the song service right
[46:22] and their mind just is not ready they're
[46:24] still stressed out about this and
[46:25] planning that for tomorrow and
[46:27] upset about what happened earlier but
[46:29] when we sing we
[46:30] we allow the holy spirit to come and we
[46:32] cast down anything that
[46:33] exalts itself against the word of god
[46:35] you open yourself up to the holy spirit
[46:37] and now god is anointing your mind amen
[46:40] and the peace that passes all
[46:41] understanding lives in your mind
[46:43] it reigns in your mind and your mind is
[46:45] free now to receive the word of god
[46:49] see it inhabits it lives in
[46:52] your songs god anoints he comes and
[46:54] lives
[46:55] in the space or the room of your mind
[46:59] praise god now go back to ephesians 4.
[47:01] remember we read this one on
[47:03] sunday night right about the mind
[47:05] battles but just to kind of prove it
[47:08] again ephesians 4.
[47:16] it was 23 no i'm sorry it was 27. that's
[47:19] what i read last time
[47:20] ephesians 4 27 neither give place to the
[47:23] devil
[47:24] right so it's about a place it's about
[47:26] inhabiting it's about territory right
[47:28] demons like territory both physical and
[47:30] spiritual right
[47:32] they like to take somebody's mind first
[47:33] and then when they get all these people
[47:34] the same mindset they like to put them
[47:36] in one physical location right
[47:38] we can all think of like gang places
[47:40] like chicago right or new york city
[47:42] where there's a
[47:43] high concentration of gangs how did they
[47:45] get there well because satan first got
[47:47] there
[47:47] uh first got their minds he got real
[47:49] estate in their minds
[47:50] and then people of of like thoughts
[47:53] right go to the same places
[47:55] right that's how it is in anything and
[47:57] then they kind of live in those same
[47:58] places
[47:59] or rich people that are stuck up and
[48:00] prideful the same thing praise god
[48:04] right they got all this money and they
[48:05] wasted on this uh mansions and cars and
[48:07] boats and everything like that
[48:08] it's all selfish it's the same thing
[48:10] right and they all live in the same area
[48:12] because demons like to be together ah
[48:16] so see when people take satan's thoughts
[48:19] and any lie
[48:20] they're giving their mind or their real
[48:23] estate to the devil
[48:24] but we've got to open up and let god
[48:26] come in clean out our houses right
[48:28] clean out of anything that doesn't
[48:30] please god and bring and then preaching
[48:32] all these spoils all he'll bring in all
[48:34] these blessings amen
[48:35] so bringing all this love and joy and
[48:37] peace and mercy and all these things
[48:39] all the character of god all the spoils
[48:41] of god he'll bring it into our room
[48:43] praise god
[48:45] that's right so see singing is uh the
[48:48] invitation
[48:49] uh channel of the human spirit that's
[48:52] how you invite god
[48:53] to come and anoint you is through
[48:56] singing because he inhabits the praises
[48:58] of his people
[48:59] praise god so next time we're feeling
[49:01] outside the holy spirit we need to
[49:02] invite the holy spirit to come in
[49:04] through a nice song amen
[49:08] all right now uh before i get too far
[49:11] here let's see what the next one is okay
[49:13] all right now here's the wrong music
[49:16] brings the wrong spirit remember this
[49:18] after moses was gone 40 days
[49:20] and he brought down the tables and god
[49:22] said god said they've already broken
[49:24] those
[49:25] he threw down the tables when joshua
[49:27] heard the noise of the people as they
[49:28] shouted he said to moses there's a noise
[49:31] of war
[49:32] in the camp and he said it is not the
[49:34] voice of them that shout for mastery
[49:36] neither
[49:37] is the voice of them that cry for being
[49:38] overcome but the noise of them that
[49:40] sing do i hear so it sounded like
[49:44] a battle and what they were doing they
[49:45] were worshiping their idol
[49:47] they were giving the praise to the idol
[49:49] that should have got to god
[49:51] right and they heard it like it's some
[49:53] loud battle like
[49:55] they'd won a battle right and not only
[49:58] that but the bible said when he came
[49:59] nigh
[50:00] he saw the image and they were dancing
[50:03] so it was like a victory dance right
[50:05] they were doing a victory dance
[50:07] and it was for it was the wrong spirit
[50:10] right it was for
[50:10] a demon right and the bible said moses
[50:14] anger wax hot and he cast
[50:16] the tables out of the hands and break
[50:17] them beneath the mount
[50:19] now god wants us to be victors right god
[50:21] wants us to win battles praise god
[50:24] right but in this case it was the wrong
[50:26] kind of music
[50:27] right and then the wrong spirit would it
[50:29] produce idolatry
[50:32] so see the right spirit will produce
[50:34] true worship the wrong spirit will
[50:36] produce
[50:36] idolatry so especially as a leader
[50:40] as a pastor and a song leader we've got
[50:42] to really keep our lives free from
[50:44] idolatry
[50:45] keep our lives free from sin confess
[50:47] anything
[50:48] because we will influence the rest of
[50:50] the congregation
[50:52] right so you got to be very careful
[50:55] got to be very careful how we live our
[50:57] lives and of course the holy spirit will
[50:58] help us right we know that
[51:00] so we don't get all scared but we just
[51:01] the bible said you got to watch
[51:03] watch him pray right guard yourself
[51:05] right guard your heart
[51:06] always have a guard always have
[51:08] protection praise god and that's prayer
[51:10] amen we'll get to that lord really next
[51:11] time
[51:11] the bible said keep the holy spirit will
[51:13] keep your hearts and minds that word
[51:15] keep means guard in
[51:16] philippians 4. the giving of thanks and
[51:19] praising god
[51:20] that will keep that will guard your
[51:22] heart so giving thanks and praying
[51:24] that is setting up a guard to protect
[51:26] you if we know if we're not praying
[51:27] enough that we're not guarded we're
[51:28] going to be attacked
[51:29] and we're not going to be able to defeat
[51:30] the enemy so we got to keep praying amen
[51:33] amen guard our hearts and lives
[51:37] so if someone feels like they're getting
[51:38] slain or beat up by the devils because
[51:40] they're not guarded
[51:41] right they let their guard down the word
[51:43] prayer fellowship with god
[51:45] amen amen hallelujah praise god so see
[51:49] a battle so a victory dance but it was
[51:52] the wrong
[51:52] spirit right because you could see the
[51:56] idolatry going on
[51:59] all right now third every sound has a
[52:02] meaning now this is beautiful
[52:04] uh now i got this from that dr frank
[52:06] good good good preacher
[52:08] now therefore if i come unto you
[52:10] speaking with tongues what shall i
[52:11] profit you except
[52:12] i shall speak to you either by
[52:14] revelation or knowledge or by pray
[52:16] prophesying or by doctrine now this
[52:18] isn't dealing with music right it's
[52:20] dealing with tongues
[52:21] because this is the tongues chapter if
[52:22] you know anything about corinthians
[52:24] and even things without life giving
[52:26] sound whether pipe or harp
[52:28] except they give a distinction in the
[52:30] sounds how shall be known what
[52:32] is piped or harped right so there ha
[52:35] each sound has to have a meaning for if
[52:38] the trumpet give an uncertain sound who
[52:40] shall prepare himself
[52:41] to the battle so in other words you got
[52:44] to be trained on certain
[52:46] sounds right so you have to know you
[52:48] have to know the sound for battle
[52:50] like if you're in the military the
[52:51] revelry right you got a
[52:53] taps you got no taps it's bedtime song
[52:56] lunch is lunch ravelry is that is i'm
[52:59] not sure malcolm you know
[53:01] his revelry the lunch or the morning
[53:03] call
[53:04] i'm not sure if he's read that one yet
[53:06] my friends and i
[53:07] my friend's a marine at school and i
[53:09] talk to him sometimes about it i just
[53:10] can't remember which one
[53:12] so there's a certain there's a trumpet
[53:13] for breakfast there's a trumpet for
[53:15] waking up
[53:16] there's a trumpet for bedtime and each
[53:19] one has a certain sound
[53:21] right each one has a meaning so likewise
[53:24] except the utter by the tongue
[53:26] words easy to be understood how shall be
[53:29] known what is spoken
[53:30] for ye shall speak in the air so see
[53:32] we've got to make all sounds
[53:34] easy to understand okay so we want our
[53:37] music
[53:38] easily to be understood what what it's
[53:40] preparing us for right
[53:44] amen praise god
[53:47] next uh the next verse there are it may
[53:50] be so many kinds of voices in the world
[53:52] and none of them is without
[53:54] signification so every voice has a
[53:57] certain uh meaning to it right therefore
[54:00] if
[54:00] i know not the meaning now that's
[54:02] dunamis or
[54:03] power or influence of the voice
[54:07] right i shall be unto him that speaketh
[54:09] a barbarian he that speaketh shall be a
[54:11] barbarian
[54:12] unto me so you must know the meaning of
[54:15] the sounds
[54:15] and this is where it's going to be
[54:16] helpful with rock and roll for us we've
[54:18] got to find the meanings of the sounds
[54:20] so we've got to be able to have fast
[54:22] music but not sound like rock and roll
[54:25] right we've got to be able to clap and
[54:27] stomp and dance and praise the lord
[54:29] but not do rock and roll right
[54:33] because the bible says they dance with
[54:34] tambourines on the red seashore praise
[54:36] god
[54:37] they dance they had victory dances in
[54:40] the bible
[54:41] right did you still do them today at
[54:42] times when they have victories or
[54:44] celebrations
[54:45] right and brother brahma's we'll play
[54:46] that one a little bit a really fast song
[54:51] the one time brother bram danced in the
[54:52] spirit he said they were they were uh it
[54:54] was a new year's eve service
[54:56] there was going to be a meeting in the
[54:57] air the sweet sweep by and by he said
[54:59] the sister had a thimble
[55:00] and a washboard it was scratching it
[55:02] back and forth there's going to be
[55:05] a meeting in the air and brother started
[55:07] dancing in the spirit
[55:09] that was a fast song for praise god so
[55:11] there's got to be a way to do it
[55:13] but not interject an evil sound
[55:18] right
[55:22] now we know god is the author of music
[55:24] here i'm just going to go over a few
[55:25] scriptures
[55:25] i love this scripture the lord thy god
[55:27] is in the midst of thee is mighty
[55:30] he will save he'll rejoice over thee
[55:32] with joy so see god
[55:34] is happy too when you get saved now he
[55:36] already knew you were going to get saved
[55:38] right but the bible says
[55:40] he rejoices right just so not only do
[55:43] the angels rejoice
[55:44] jesus rejoices amen he said he will rest
[55:47] in his love
[55:48] he will joy over thee with singing
[55:53] hallelujah praise god so they give this
[55:55] uh
[55:56] they give this personification i think
[55:58] is the word right where got course he is
[56:00] a person
[56:00] but he's an invisible person but god
[56:03] rejoices and sings
[56:05] over us he loves us
[56:09] amen god sings jesus sang too
[56:12] he's saying right before his death we
[56:14] know that the bible said he said i will
[56:16] not drink henceforth of the fruit of the
[56:17] vine
[56:18] until the day when i drink it new with
[56:19] you in my father's kingdom and when they
[56:21] had sung to him they went out
[56:23] into the mount of olives now some
[56:25] there's a preacher that framed preacher
[56:27] dr frank
[56:27] he says he he knows which hymns they
[56:30] sang because there were certain hymns
[56:31] that were tied to the passover and they
[56:34] would always sing them before
[56:36] during and after the the meal so he says
[56:39] he has a pretty good idea which one's on
[56:41] so i know they're in the psalms they're
[56:42] in the psalms
[56:43] so i may preach that later on but we
[56:45] probably know some of the songs
[56:47] jesus sang and jesus sang songs praise
[56:50] god
[56:53] angels sing songs uh he said
[56:56] god asked joe where were you when i laid
[56:57] the foundation of the earth declare if i
[56:59] was understanding
[57:00] when the morning stars sang together and
[57:03] all the sons of god
[57:04] shouted for joy now remember sons are
[57:07] angels
[57:09] now morning stars are angels too right
[57:12] morning stars because satan was like a
[57:13] morning star okay now it's a different
[57:16] greek word so it's a different hebrew
[57:17] word so these are speaking of angels
[57:20] but also the bible says all creation
[57:22] glorifies and sings to god
[57:25] right all creations the mountains sing
[57:27] and the waves roar and
[57:29] and because uh their noise is uh every
[57:32] noise is a vibration right that's what a
[57:33] song is a vibration right
[57:35] it's a vibration so everything uh that
[57:38] god created has a vibration for
[57:40] it so not only do the angels sing but
[57:43] all of creation sings amen
[57:45] brother ram said that's why you never
[57:46] see a bird with a heart
[57:48] a trouble because they're always singing
[57:49] all the time
[57:51] they're doing what they were made to do
[57:53] praise god right what do you say which
[57:55] bird the
[57:55] not the mock converter he said one of
[57:57] the birds the robin or whatever
[57:58] they sing all the time so they never
[58:00] have blood pressure right
[58:01] they never have stress they don't have
[58:03] to take a stress pill they don't have
[58:04] heart attacks
[58:05] because they're constantly singing all
[58:06] the time and the same thing's true for
[58:08] us praise god amen
[58:10] if we'll cast down stress if we'll cast
[58:12] down temptations
[58:13] if we'll cast down anxiety the bible
[58:15] said he that a merry heart maketh good
[58:17] medicine praise god
[58:19] he'll heal us if we just stay happy stay
[58:21] rejoicing
[58:22] and let the holy spirit clean out our
[58:24] minds through the song music
[58:26] song service hallelujah
[58:31] bye it's even angels sing
[58:35] remember angels are called angels are
[58:38] called sons in job 1 6. the sons of god
[58:40] came to present themselves
[58:41] satan came with them right so that's
[58:43] just a little that's a
[58:44] mystery unlocked in the bible there
[58:47] now you know satan's the perverter of
[58:49] music uh
[58:51] let me yeah i better find a place to
[58:52] close here now satan was in the garden
[58:54] of god remember he's covered with all
[58:56] these beautiful stones
[58:57] but his workmanship or his occupation or
[59:00] business
[59:00] was of the tambourine and of the pipes
[59:03] and that means a grove
[59:05] socket or whole which is a strange
[59:07] hebrew word
[59:09] was prepared in thee in the day when
[59:10] thou was created now remember there's
[59:12] nothing wrong with a tambourine because
[59:14] miriam used a tambourine so satan was he
[59:18] had
[59:18] built in some type of tambourine work he
[59:21] was doing or maybe he was playing some
[59:22] tambourine
[59:23] he was keeping the beat right and like i
[59:27] like i like what brother ben said he
[59:28] said some people say satan was a song
[59:30] leader brother ben said he's more than
[59:31] that that's true
[59:32] he was more than that because he was the
[59:34] anointed cherub that covereth
[59:36] he was far he was he was great he was
[59:38] really close to god he was right there i
[59:39] believe it was michael and lucifer
[59:40] that's what i believe
[59:41] those archangels i believe i believe we
[59:44] can prove that by the scripture
[59:47] so uh this scripture kind of and now
[59:49] this is our assurance so see satan at
[59:51] times
[59:52] he makes his style very close to the
[59:53] true style remember because
[59:55] those spirits will be so close it would
[59:57] deceive the very elect if it were
[59:59] possible
[1:00:00] okay so be very careful some people are
[1:00:03] deceived in the wrong type of music
[1:00:05] right but it's so close sometimes and
[1:00:08] that's what i found too is some of the
[1:00:09] songs it's so hard to tell man is this
[1:00:11] right
[1:00:11] but the bible said we got to make it
[1:00:13] certain so if
[1:00:15] so if it's if it's even close if it's a
[1:00:17] little too fast then we just got to slow
[1:00:18] it down
[1:00:19] right like if it's i don't know all the
[1:00:22] details yeah you know but
[1:00:24] i can't tell you all the details but i'm
[1:00:25] just saying if it if it sounds like it's
[1:00:27] it's rock and roll
[1:00:29] then we gotta take out whatever it is if
[1:00:31] it's got good lyrics
[1:00:33] maybe and then still sing it for the
[1:00:34] lord maybe by god's grace if we feel led
[1:00:36] to the lord
[1:00:37] okay so it's all about following the
[1:00:39] leadership of the lord here
[1:00:42] and then remember the spirit of god he
[1:00:44] promised church
[1:00:45] he'll not forsake us he'll not leave us
[1:00:46] out there too long if we make a mistake
[1:00:48] with a song
[1:00:49] he won't leave us out there if we're in
[1:00:50] touch with him he'll guide us into all
[1:00:52] truth praise god
[1:00:53] especially if we're daily praying god
[1:00:55] purged me of anything wrong
[1:00:57] purge me of any evil i want to obey you
[1:00:59] in everything i will live by every word
[1:01:01] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:01:03] don't you think god will grant it to us
[1:01:04] praise god amen
[1:01:08] i believe that now get your bibles go to
[1:01:11] psalm 33
[1:01:12] verse 3 i don't have the slides so i'm
[1:01:14] sorry uh just get your bible there

[1:01:27] i guess beforehand i was
[1:01:28] i was a song leader and i didn't really
[1:01:29] introduce many many new songs
[1:01:32] because i was just i was all i could
[1:01:33] think about was the preaching the
[1:01:34] preaching the preaching
[1:01:36] so i appreciate you being fully
[1:01:37] dedicated to that
[1:01:39] psalms 33 verse 3. uh

[1:01:52] one
[1:01:53] rejoice in the lord oh you righteous for
[1:01:54] praise is calmly
[1:01:56] for the upright that means beautiful
[1:01:59] okay

[1:02:03] service
[1:02:03] and every week i try to tell brother
[1:02:04] amen how much i appreciate the song
[1:02:06] service
[1:02:06] because it is it is beautiful the bible
[1:02:09] said praise is beautiful
[1:02:11] for the upright amen see if your heart's
[1:02:13] upright you'll enjoy worshiping god amen
[1:02:16] it will be a beautiful song service if
[1:02:18] your heart is right with god
[1:02:20] right the song leader the preacher
[1:02:21] everybody's heart our hearts got to be
[1:02:23] right with god
[1:02:25] praise the lord with harp sing unto him
[1:02:27] with the sultry
[1:02:28] of an instrument of ten strings so like
[1:02:31] a harp loot guitar yeah guitars in there

[1:02:34] there it is with 10 strings sing unto
[1:02:38] him a new song
[1:02:39] play skillfully with only quiet music
[1:02:43] loud there's times it's quiet right when
[1:02:46] we're searching our souls
[1:02:49] right and we want to be able to think
[1:02:51] that's why brother bran would many times
[1:02:52] when the angel overcome
[1:02:53] he would say play it soft but then after
[1:02:55] everybody's all clear
[1:02:57] let's worship let's praise god let's
[1:02:59] glorify his name amen but if we're
[1:03:01] trying to
[1:03:02] search our hearts and our minds we don't
[1:03:03] want it too loud right because it just
[1:03:05] our minds can't really focus
[1:03:10] verse 4 for the word of the lord is
[1:03:12] right and all his works
[1:03:15] are done in truth
[1:03:18] praise god so see we have so many
[1:03:20] beautiful scriptures
[1:03:21] there's such a liberty saints in in
[1:03:24] in worship there's such a liberty in
[1:03:26] doing it
[1:03:27] in fact let me read these last quotes
[1:03:29] i'm going to skip i'm going to skip
[1:03:30] ahead i'm going to close with this
[1:03:31] i just want brother amen if i haven't
[1:03:33] preached forgive me uh it's been years
[1:03:38] i probably haven't preached them since
[1:03:41] you know you've been song leading so
[1:03:42] forgive me i just want to do these
[1:03:44] quotes here real quick
[1:03:50] so yeah let's let's just close with
[1:03:51] these uh quotes here
[1:03:55] now brother i was talking about the new
[1:03:56] wine now i'm going to skip i'll i'll
[1:03:57] preach these full
[1:03:58] i'll read these fully later i'm just
[1:04:00] going to skip to the main part but
[1:04:02] i'm talking about how the holy ghost
[1:04:03] when you get it it'll come by the word
[1:04:05] but then the holy spirit
[1:04:07] himself comes you hear the word but then
[1:04:09] the presence of god has to come upon you
[1:04:11] right that's what he's talking about in
[1:04:13] other words you you feel god
[1:04:14] you feel the joy you feel the anointing
[1:04:16] right that's what he's talking about
[1:04:18] so the man said i know there's a lot of
[1:04:20] fanaticism and people carrying on
[1:04:22] i know sometimes they do it when the
[1:04:23] music's jumping up and down and
[1:04:24] everything
[1:04:25] and i know that goes and i believe that
[1:04:27] too so brother man believed in jumping
[1:04:29] up and down
[1:04:30] but the man believed in praising the
[1:04:31] lord amen he said i've seen
[1:04:34] people in the day when as as long as the
[1:04:36] music's playing
[1:04:37] everybody was jumping and screaming but
[1:04:39] when the music stopped they stopped see
[1:04:41] i believe well that's still all right as
[1:04:43] far as i'm concerned as long
[1:04:44] as the people lives right so he's given
[1:04:47] a little criticism he says some people
[1:04:49] can only rejoice when the music's on
[1:04:51] see we need to rejoice while the
[1:04:52] preaching preaching's going on too
[1:04:54] praise god
[1:04:55] i do it all the time right because i can
[1:04:57] feel the joy of god right
[1:04:59] i'm just a happy person many times right
[1:05:01] but i feel the love of god i feel the
[1:05:03] happiness the joy of the holy spirit
[1:05:06] but he says he says he's a little
[1:05:07] critical of that some people only get
[1:05:09] excited with the music
[1:05:10] but we should also get them excited just
[1:05:11] with the word
[1:05:14] but now you start bringing the word
[1:05:15] that's the thing that actually brings
[1:05:17] life is the word
[1:05:18] that brings the joy of stimulation new
[1:05:20] wine and that's what it was on pentecost
[1:05:23] when the word was vindicated but i just
[1:05:24] want you to see even if people just get
[1:05:26] excited with music that's okay
[1:05:28] as long as they live right right
[1:05:31] but we know if you get the holy ghost
[1:05:33] and you're born again you're going to
[1:05:34] get excited about music a lot of times
[1:05:36] praise god amen because it's you
[1:05:38] inviting god
[1:05:39] to have his place in your mind it's god
[1:05:41] taking over your mind amen
[1:05:43] and your body that's why they said
[1:05:45] they're drunk because the holy ghost had
[1:05:47] taken over their mind and their body
[1:05:48] praise god
[1:05:50] all right now i'm just going to skip
[1:05:51] some of this here
[1:05:56] see so abraham believed god it was
[1:05:57] imputed on him for righteousness but god
[1:05:59] given the sign of circumcision
[1:06:01] as a confirmation he accepted his fate
[1:06:03] so that's the same thing we must do
[1:06:05] we must wait on the holy spirit until
[1:06:07] it's done something
[1:06:09] right we can speak the word and pray and
[1:06:12] sing all we want but the holy spirit
[1:06:13] eventually has to come
[1:06:14] and do something to you praise god all
[1:06:17] right you got to receive a blessing you
[1:06:18] got to reach
[1:06:19] you got to feel him praise god you got
[1:06:20] to you got to be inspired by him
[1:06:23] not necessarily because we spoke in
[1:06:25] tongues not because we danced or got
[1:06:27] emotional we shouted
[1:06:28] but until we're changed until something
[1:06:30] actually happened i don't care what form
[1:06:32] it comes in
[1:06:33] just so it happened that's the main
[1:06:35] thing so the form of the holy ghost
[1:06:38] coming on you might be speaking in
[1:06:39] tongues
[1:06:40] it might be dancing it might be
[1:06:41] emotional that's that gets me all the
[1:06:43] time
[1:06:44] i start crying just because i feel his
[1:06:46] presence i just
[1:06:48] uh i just get emotional right sometimes
[1:06:50] i'll dance
[1:06:52] he said i always shout mercy i'm always
[1:06:54] shouting in the church
[1:06:57] see don't care what form it comes in as
[1:07:00] long as it happens as long as
[1:07:01] something happens so you got to respond
[1:07:03] to it right
[1:07:05] now um i'm not going to play that
[1:07:09] tonight
[1:07:11] but let's close with this brother and
[1:07:12] said do you love it this at the end of a
[1:07:14] sermon
[1:07:14] first the thirst message okay i love
[1:07:16] this message
[1:07:18] he said now i wonder if you got your
[1:07:20] feet converted you don't dance anymore

[1:07:23] let's pat our feet to the lord to the
[1:07:25] lord
[1:07:26] so then he get you could we'll play it
[1:07:28] next time or where like next wednesday
[1:07:29] maybe
[1:07:30] he he said let's clap and let's stomp
[1:07:32] our feet for the lord
[1:07:33] lord said is your hands converted you
[1:07:35] don't steal anymore
[1:07:37] he said are your lips converted you
[1:07:38] don't lie anymore just don't get
[1:07:40] religion in your head
[1:07:41] get it all over you remember i'm saying

[1:07:45] your hands
[1:07:46] get religion in your feet get religion
[1:07:47] all over you praise god

[1:07:51] over you so you can praise god
[1:07:53] you're so surrendered that your whole
[1:07:55] body can glorify god amen
[1:07:57] amen is to get your religion all over
[1:08:01] your body praise the lord
[1:08:03] he said that's it it takes the whole man
[1:08:06] that's right
[1:08:07] now let's pat our feet he says they said
[1:08:10] do you believe he's the light of the
[1:08:11] world all right paul
[1:08:12] he said paul said when i sing i'll sing
[1:08:13] in the spirit if i worship i worship in
[1:08:15] the spirit whatever you do
[1:08:17] do it all in the spirit and the spirit
[1:08:19] brings the word
[1:08:20] to life amen all right i'll stop right
