========================================

Isaiah 64: 6 all right but we are all as unclean an unclean thing and our righteousness as filthy rags and our righteousness are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away now listen to that again but we are all as an unclean thing and our righteousnesses notice that the plural part of that our righteousness is is plural are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away now the uh the word that um Isaiah uses here for unclean is to be unclean both ethically which means humanly or within a human being and also religiously because you realize that Doctrine false Doctrine incorrect Doctrine can make you unclean before the Lord as well now listen to this in a message called God's covenant with Abraham brother says I haven't got nothing to offer my utmost righteousness to yours would be filthy rags in his sight right so I'm a sinner to begin with there's nothing that I could do about it but there's something that he could do he took his son's blood and covered it over me like that I love that statement so he sees me as a right ous man because his son's blood made me righteous let's pray together with the word thank you Heavenly Father we're so thankful for the opportunity to come into your house this morning Lord what a privilege it is to be your sons and your daughters father to be called by thy name and Lord as we come into this place we do so in the name of Jesus Christ asking you to not only take your word and speak to us but Lord you would Grant to us an audience with your presence that we might be able to go into the holy of holies and be able to commune with you face to face ear to ear mouth to mouth and so on and so forth then we pray Lord Jesus that you would not only take your word and speak to us this morning by it but use me Lord as an instrument to get out of the way that you might speak through me Lord open up the hearts and the minds and the lives and the ears of your children and so forth Lord that they might be able to receive that which you would Place Into the Heart of every single man woman Boy Child every who they might be Lord May the Holy Spirit speak to us Lord and give us of thy favor and thy unction as we look into the things of God as we commit this to you now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and all the saints said amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you really good and we sure appreciate the Lord and and his his Mercy to us and once again I'm just glad to be a Christian aren't you amen I'm glad to be a Christian now now sister and I'm using this right you got this all connected here you don't need any mic from me in any way just just this right here is okay unless you want it brother no I'm fine myself just I want to make sure I wasn't interrupt in your recording program all right you're good sh live stream there oh I got you okay hello everybody God bless you very much amen amen I um appreciate the Lord I want to just talk a little while the Lord will help me upon obtaining the favor of God and uh I've got a couple things if the Lord will help me get to it that um I want to talk about including humility and uh you know and inspiration of the Lord and a few of those kind of things but I I just want to lay a foundation uh for just a little bit upon uh my thoughts and the way that I want to try to project this about the uh righteousness of a human being and I think if I can kind of get this in at the beginning here all these other things that we're going to kind of carry on with we'll be able to really bring out a uh a solid understanding about humility what true humility looks like and then what it means to be humble and what that really is biblically speaking and then I want to try to carry the Lord uh helping me into uh a little thought about inspiration of the Lord so there there's there's the agenda there's the list everything you know and so I I I we'll see how it goes you know when you want to make God laugh you just tell him your plans ain't that right amen but anyways we're just going to try to follow the spirit of the Lord the best we can but I I do feel like it's important to kind of get some of these subjects in for us because I think as the people of God we've arrived at a place in time where quite honestly we we should know some of this material way more than we know it and I I say this almost to our shame in a way but really church people and uh people that follow the message of the hour you would think folks know their Bible better than what they do but they don't pray they don't read they don't study like they should and and preachers are all the time hitting up against brick walls trying to get people somewhere until after a while some preachers just throw their hand up and say you can't beat them join them and then everything just becomes some kind of fluffy sermon where everybody's saved and going to heaven and there's no reason to dig no reason to pray or labor but I think the real body of Christ I'm talking about the real ones now I think they want to know where they stand in terms of righteousness Holiness and everything don't you think so I believe as a child of God I want to know where my feet are I want to know exactly what calling that the Lord has called me to I don't want to be set in a position or in a place to where I don't know how I'm supposed to act behave or be pleasing to the Lord and I certainly want his favor don't you think so I want to know how that I can obtain that favor of God and as we read in this beginning scripture this opening text here Isaiah is really dragging us through the mud and I'm going to say this because I'm in a mixed audience this way he's really taking us through the uh through the dirt and the filth and the gum of what our righteousness really looks like in the eyes of God and when you look at the term filthy rags it's an unsanitary thing it's a thing that's repulsive it's a thing that's uh it's certainly not dinner conversation and it's certainly not conversation that people want to have uh of things that are done in the dark should never be spoke in the light that's what a filthy rag would be something that is so uh Gammy and ungodly and horrible that a human being would never even want to even discuss the thing much leave let's have a conversation about the whole thing and yet that's what the way God looks at self-made righteous self-made Holiness is that in the eyes of God and we want to understand that for you and I to be the right kind of people to be the right kind of Christians God is Not depending upon us to find some way to be holy within ourselves are you with me amen but he wants us to completely and solely depend upon the grace of God that takes away the sin of the world and not just the sin of this world but the sin of this world right here amen I want to be so dedicated I want to be so committed to him that when it comes to being righteous in his eyes I don't want to have to stand there and say well Lord you know you done that and I done that and us together we did such and such but I want to be able to say Lord Beyond any shadow of doubt in my mind whatsoever I wouldn't be the man that I am today had not it been for the grace and the mercy of God that his son's blood would cover me to make me righteous and clean in the eyes of God and I believe that when it comes to the favor of God having the favor of God is something that comes along with this act of God in your heart for example when the Lord first saves you and you come uh my repentance into the Christian church and now you're beginning to understand what it means to be saved and forgiven of all of your past sins amen the Lord will show grace to you and favor to you and give you opportunities to straighten out and correct and do things then as he brings you to the spot of sanctification it's not an action that we do I I wish folks around the church would get this idea out of their mind that true sanctification is when you decided to quit smoking or lusting or cussing or whatever you did that that's yourself made sanctification true sanctification of God is when the Holy Ghost went down in your spirit and cleaned you out and gave you a new spirit so that you could be agreeable with the word of God Amen that's what the Bible said I can't help that that's what the Bible said amen and no matter what message preacher tries to twist that around or what other kind of preacher tries to turn that around and make it just a believe the prophet or believe the message or come to church and be a good person and clean yourself up a little bit and you'll be Sanctified without the Holy Ghost sanctification that's one of the reasons we don't have the new birth here so much people right on putting before the and walk off and leave the whole thing amen and what do you do when you get a person like that you get a Pharisee right right you get a sadducee you get an actor I heard brother B say it this morning he was talking about enticing spirits and he said now we get uh actions and things in the body from these demons he said that's the powers and Supernatural Powers he said it's even proven to be a fourth dimension disease he said said all disease and things like that come from fourth dimension and he said and these Devils will move in the form of the physical cancers and things like that he said but then the human being has that in their soul he said but at the same time a person that has this in their soul he said you see there's never been a person that could ever genuinely be a li test he said the human being wasn't made to lie and he said they sit before that lie detector and it catches right quick in that subconscious that they're telling something that ain't true now we've had people down through the years that's learned how to beat a li test that's how Wicked and indifferent we' become in the last days to where they've seared their own conscience with such a hot iron that they don't even know when they're lying anymore deceived by the thing but human beings were not made to be that way and brother man said I heard him say it this morning if a person then would have all of that inside of him amen knowing that they they they they can't tell something wrong and then declare to be a Christian you said that heart will tell them you're you're just an actor you're not really genuinely Born Again of the Holy Spirit and in that regard amen this is exactly where sanctification comes in sanctification takes you to the level Amen to where you're no longer an actor but now you're genuinely moving on Lord I need to be right with you I need to be clean and set aside for service so you can fill me with the holy ghost real genuine sanctification in the Church of the Living God would change a lot of our people around here sure would it would take a lot of these young people been raised up in the message and and and and given all the instructions and the rules and the rule book and the list of things they're allowed to do and not do and so forth and it would take all of that and all that adherence that they've given to those things and it would make it genuine and make it real in their heart rather than just putting on the show because that's the way it is right amen listen I got girls of my own teenage girls and I told my babies the other day and I told a brother the other day we was talking about families and things I said look I said I'm not here to put the burden upon my girls to be bride I don't know if God's called them that way or not I can trust the Lord I can claim my inheritance but I don't know whether God made not one of my Youngs bride or not and I'm not going to put upon them the burden of being bride but I just want to see him saved amen I want to see God do something for him and wherever he carries him that's up to him not up to me but I don't want to try to make or force them to be someone that they're never going to be as I tell them they live in a my house you live under my rules the things that they when they break rules or whatever the thing might be I tell them this is not punishment this is protection because the idea is that we need to protect our loved ones keep them in an atmosphere where if they are a bride of Christ the Holy Ghost can regenerate that heart and bring them into the spot they need to be amen but I think what we've done is very pharc we've laid upon our churches and upon our families burdens that we ourselves are not willing to Bear up right sure we try to make people live right and do clean and act a certain Manner and all that kind of thing but at the end of the day there's not a preacher stands in the pull pit that can tow the line the way he preaches it oh you say well he shouldn't be preaching but I'm talking about the human side right no matter how much I might preach truth to you no matter how close I live to God there's still going to be an element in me in the eyes of God that's going to be like a filthy rag I'll never be able to come 100% that's why Jesus come for us folks amen that's why Jesus died cuz none of us could tow the line but God's grace provides for us a medium where we can step into the the river the flow of the River of Life and drink as of the Waters of the rivers of life amen and be able to thirst never again because our souls are being Satisfied by the great presence of almighty God the shik sh the indwelling presence of God God's bread that feeds our hungry Souls amen amen We Lay upon the church you got to be this you got to be that we've long forgotten the idea that none of us could be this or that right it's all being covered by the blood of Jesus Christ repenting and dying daily keeping our lives right before the Lord when we do something wrong go make that thing right and then keep throwing oursel on the mercies of God every day amen that's what brings the church along that's right that's what brings us into another statosphere amen and into another atmosphere not this idea of I will and God will and I will and you will and then God will do something but he said to Abraham I I know you can't do it that's right it's impossible for you to do it so I can't swear by you but I'll swear by myself you notice when he come to Abraham he just kept saying I'm looking here he said I will I will I will I will he never stopped and said Abraham what you going to offer he knew he couldn't offer anything he wasn't interested in what he could offer by the grace of God by faith are you saved not of works that any man could boast see there's the problem right there everybody wants to have a little boasting power folks want to say I got saved I came to the altar I done this before the Lord I was forgiven yeah but who's the one that did all that for you that's right amen not you done it within yourself but Christ done that for you amen my faith declares that he is that kind of God my faith declares that he is able to do those things my faith declares that his power is greater than I could ever imagine my faith declares he's the same yesterday today and forever my faith declares have he done it one time he can do it every single time my faith declares that if God's still calling amen the message of repentance is still alive and the Holy Ghost is still able to be received by all who receive it amen so he sees me as a righteous man not because of my own thing but because of what he's done amen you see trials and these type of things shape us into a thinking a mode of thinking a style of thinking an atmosphere of thinking it goes into our thought world and trials will steer us in a certain direction and where we get in the most trouble we could ever get into is when we start taking our own thought in the middle of a battle like that taking our own attitudes and our own thinking and saying well Lord I can figure this out but then he may he just turns up the heat degree by degree Crank by crank until finally you start yielding yourself over why does he do that not to be mean it's not punishment it's protection he's trying to give you a spot give you a place to where you can receive better character than what you were born with better character than what you were raised to have no matter how good your mom and dad might be I always think of when I think of good clean wholesome Godly families I always think of Jesse and Christen and I always think of how they've raised these kids to the glory of God you know and and if I was ever jealous or envious of anything it's that I would to God that I could be that kind of father be that kind of mother in our home Samantha and I would to God that we could do as good a job as was what I've seen in this little Church's family and I love what God's done for this little group right here and I think to myself Lord you know I I look at all of the traveling and all the mistakes I've made as a father and I think you know I I see this happen or that happen or certain things conversations come up and I've got good girls don't misunderstand me we got a good home that loves the Lord amen but we're not without the human side right and I think of all of that and I think God don't let the devil take him babies out there right and run them out into the world and things like that right but I also realize that as holy and as Godly as we can raise a family at the end of the day it's up to the Lord of where he's going to take them this way or that way all of our children including these kids all these young people sitting here amen all of them we all have a choice as adults we all have a choice mommies dads we all have a choice how we're going to serve the Lord or whether we're not going to serve the Lord would to God that every family in this message that follow brother bram's teachings and the things that was given in this last day I would to God that all the families would have the attitude of my house we will serve the Lord yes amen amen sure you see things happen but yet I think on the other side of it here come brother brandham from a drunkard home yes broken up every Wich away you know I imagine brother Braham had times in his life he' look back and said I would to God I would have had that Godly type home where we was raised reading the Bible and talking about Jesus at the dinner table right but you see predestination by the hand of God does not and I'm thankful for this does not grab us and put us in our position based upon the family atmosphere amen hallelujah the worst of the worst can become the best of the best and if we're not careful the best of the best can turn around become the worst of the worst and us not see it look at Judas Judas raised in the message we'd say Judas raised in a condition to where that he could do all things religious and every which way the Rich Young Ruler followed every commandment of God right to the letter right but you see in the heart of man no matter how well we've raised our families no matter how we've loved one another husbands and wives could have such a Godly relationship I I've heard people tell us all the time you know I wish we were like you and Sam I said well listen Samantha's one of the greatest women I've ever met in my entire life and we buddies her and I are just just Chums and I said that's my wing girl and I'm her Wing man amen amen and we we we like peas and carrots we stick together and we've always stuck together and fought together and cried together and laughed together and everything else and folks will say I wish I had a marriage like that and then I think to myself oh God all of the humanity of my own and all of her humanity and how we were raised as the babies of the family both of us stubborn and hard-headed always wanting our own ways and everything else it's a miracle in a way that we've even survived being as SPO old as we were but that's what I'm trying to tell you the grace of God Amen knows how to put things in its right place and its right position oh I don't mean that we should just throw caution to the wind and not serve the Lord and not raise our families right but I mean that there is a hope when you see flaws there is hope when you see errors there are there's hopes in our life are you with me there's hope laying there when things don't go the way that we think they should go God doesn't look at those things as being qualific ations of his mercy and his grace right we train our churches we train our people we train one another the Elder teaches the younger and so on so forth like that we do our very best to bring people into the right Spirit and the right attitude of Christianity but at the end of the day we can give them all the tools and all the abilities and tell them how to do things but God has to show mercy righten and anoint that which has been said amen as if he does an anointing bring it into your heart and you accept it freely that it's just laying there as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol that's what Paul was talking about when he said I could have all of that I could be loaded up with all the tools and the goods and the understanding and the Mystery I could have been raised in a good home I could have come up in a good church could have had the best pastor had all of the best music in the world but that alone wasn't enough for me I needed the love of God hallelujah hallelujah I was raised in church raised here in brother Ram's name raised here in the name of Jesus Christ raised here in the Bible read and the message is played I come up here in all the Godly things as a boy myself but but for the grace of God I would have went to the world like everybody else would have went that's right and stayed in the world not just went there but stayed that's right amen no telling where I would have been had not God rescued me from the greatest rescue he could have rescued from me amen yes amen I said he rescued me from me yes that's the greatest rescue hell wasn't even a big a danger as I was the devil wasn't even a bigger threat as I was he rescued me from the greatest threat myself people live in the shadow of teaching and instruction from Ministry that will say you know the only thing you have to follow the message believe brother random believe on Jesus as your savior it's all good to say that and it's easy to make those statements right but if God doesn't Quicken it to you right and you can't receive that in your heart all you're doing is learning sir and never coming to the knowledge of the truth that's right how many friends do we have sitting in pews around the churches of this truth that are in that very same condition they sit around and hear all the great things of God even feel the spirit of God in Services time and time and time again and I love it when you come into anointed churches before your hand reaches the door knob you can feel the presence presence of God in the place I love being in atmospheres like that and I've seen many sit right there in that church and sit right there in those atmospheres like that and walk right out the door and it doesn't even affect them I used to wonder how could that be such a thing the prophet described it this way in Rising of the sun he said that when the sun rose all the sticks and the rocks and the dirt and all of that laid there and never even moved but that seed was able to catch on to what the light was bringing Hallelujah and there was an understanding created there one was was able to respond to the other and one was able to say Amen to the other and one was able to say yes Lord to the other Hallelujah and what did it produce It produced a new birth It produced the Holy Ghost It produced Christ in the human heart amen amen and what done that that little seed could have maybe looked at The Rock The Rock looked back at the seed what makes you so special the only thing he could say is how my Creator made me right yes me within myself I'm not special the only thing special about me is how my Creator made me and how he chose me amen amen not he that willth not he that runneth but God that shows Mercy that's right I want you to notice to find God's favor and to have the favor of God in our life we have to understand that God's favor doesn't come on conditions amen now I know some people will will will think in their mind well I get God's favor and then I lose God's favor that's not true once you obtain God's favor you always have his favor now that doesn't mean that at times he won't be angry with you right does it mean at times you won't be corrected right right that's right does it mean at times that he won't look down at you and say what in the world are you thinking boy right brother huh there might it might be times that God Almighty brother said it one time that God gets some mad at us he feels like kicking us sometimes right that's true Paul even said he was living in a place that he didn't frustrate the grace of God which tells me at some point he learned at some point he was frustrating the grace of God that may get frustrated with us but we never lose his favor amen now you understand that when the favor of God is placed on someone the idea that we have to understand about favor is the word favor is actually translated correctly saying grace yes 156 times you'll find favor mentioned in the New Testament and every time you read favor it means Grace yes amen and the grace of God and the favor of God goes like this that once the Lord has found favor in your life or you found favor with God I should say and he's put took his favor and he's placed it upon you that means god is allowing you to receive not only his best amen God's Not only allowing you to receive his heart amen his Blessing and all of that that comes with it but all of the worst that comes to Christianity is going to be right in there too right yes sir right yes sir you get God's worst and you get God's best right you say wait a minute now preacher God ain't God is worst hold on that ain't what brother Brenham said brother B said in why cist speak that when Faith looks at God's worst he esteems it better than all the devil could offer so there is a worst and a best that comes to Christianity none of us like trials and tribul ation right right and yet all of the worst that Humanity can throw into it and all of the things that happen in our lives once God has taken up favor with you you don't lose that because one day you're a bad boy or a bad girl or you get discouraged or you miss praying or you miss reading the Bible that day or you lost your temper on and on and on and on but the idea has been in order for me to be righteous and keep God's favor in my life I've got to walk this perfect sinful life and never make a mistake and yet that kind of life is just not humanly possible right right brother to be forgiven is a life of perfection yes amen that's what makes a person perfect is when they are forgiven of God when their sins are underneath the blood that brings them back to that perfect State and a person's got the right kind of feeling in their heart toward Christ they don't want to go out doing all kinds of things and wrong things cuz they've been changed amen as I said just ification makes a way for sanctification and sanctification cleans the heart up and puts a person in a condition to where they're ready to receive the Holy Ghost and then when they receive the Holy Ghost that's God's seal of approval that's his favor upon you to say I know that you'll make the journey and you can go right to the end of the journey and though the the the road may be rough though the the turns and the twists may be treacherous though there might be all kinds of things would befall you along the way I'm placing that seal upon your life cuz I know that you'll make it to the end of the journey amen hallelujah w beat anybody that tries to tamper with that seal right Hallelujah tries to work on your Holy Ghost and tell you you got to follow a bunch of Creeds or ideas of some man in order to get you right amen God will take exception to that but once we find the favor of God once his favor comes into our life the main thing in our our life would be to we would think in our mind to live in a manner where Lord I don't ever want to lose that but you can't right cuz God don't give and take away like that right amen amen I know that's hard to swallow but I'm going to let you work on it a little while because the idea of legalism is that if I can keep myself right on a daily basis well that's true we want to be right on a daily basis yes but there's just going to be times that we're just not able to cut the mustard hello somebody right there's just going to be days where we're going to fall short of the glory of God yes sir though you might try and try as you might you're going to fall short you're going to not be able to reach the goal that you wanted to reach for that day that's right there's going to be sick children around you there going to be troubled bosses and people at work with bad attitudes there's going to be all kinds of issues you're going to be unhealthy or some other things going to hit and there's going to be somewhere in your life that you're just not going to be able to tow the line like you want to that's right brother and what happens then do we fall out of favor with God absolutely not his favor is what places Us in the condition that while we're going through all of that he's standing right there making sure we come out on the other side amen I love that because he tells us Ephesians 4:30 Dre up the Seal of God for it will be there to the Redemption of your body good amen I'll never leave you never forsake you I'll be with you in the consummation the end of the world he'll always be with us yes and you say Amen he'll always be there notice the greatest thing in the world is to find favor with Goden and if I've got fav faor with God I can serve his people correctly yes that's true amen if I've got favor with God he'll give gifts into my life right but remember don't seek for the gifts seek for The Giver that's right follow after him follow on to know the Lord and all these things shall be added unto you seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all of this will be added unto you amen hallelujah makes sense when you go to thinking about how that if he is the giver gifts come with him right that's right never understood how people around the truth could say well we've got the giver got the giver got the giver you never see a gift anywhere right amen evidently he's got him on lay away somewhere or another right but if he's got gifts he's looking for someone that he can trust amen right not only with divine power Divine wisdom yes Divine ability he's looking for someone that is willing to Humble themsel to whatever God wants them to do they're willing to do it yes amen now turn me to Psalm 5:12 let me let me read you a couple things here on the favor of God then we're going to jump into humility and if that clock will quit preaching so fast I may get to the end of this and start something new tonight but we we we'll see that clock is a faster preacher than I am amen I promise that Psalm 5:12 now I love this statement right here he says in Victory said now remember God has counted you worthy when you have a test he said I don't fail this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found or you have found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand the test amen this is in Victor 63 in April 63 he said that God counts you worthy when you have a test you found favor with God job an upright man isth evil Satan said I'd get a hold of him you'd take your hand off him is said all right but don't you touch his life amen now why'd God do that CU he hated job got aggravated at Job thought he would put him through a little hard time give job a little Timeout on Earth or a little spanking on Earth it wasn't the idea of it no sir no sir not at all job had found favor with God Amen and God believed that he was able to stand the test but you know there's something that comes with trials sometimes when you start going through hard things like that if you're not careful you'll start working on that Human Side you get aggravated you get frustrated and just like job you come to the spot where you think oh well you know I I I I've done a pretty good job of dealing with all these problems and you know and i' I've got issues but I'm tough I can handle it you better be careful because it'll be about that time you'll hear a whirlwind speak out and say stand on your feet and talk like a man that's right right where was you when I laid the foundations of the world yes sir now watch him when it comes to Psalm 5:12 for thou Lord will bless the righteous with favor thou Compass him as with a shield Hallelujah so brother Jesse in other words if I am righteous not because of me now but because his son's blood has covered me amen and made me righteous isn't that a beautiful quotation he's taken his son's blood brother said and cover me if I'm covered in the righteousness of Jesus Christ when Satan comes to me or some evil thing comes toward me or even if I decide I think I'm going to step a little further than what I'm permitted to step right God's favor acts as a shield amen amen hallelujah am that not only keeps the devil out but keeps me inside [Music] amen glory his shield his favor his grace is what keeps you from going farther than what you would go yourself amen how many times have you as a child of God decided I'm done I quit it's over with all of a sudden you just feel like you're you're you're Bo I've had enough of the church his shield puts it around you and he protects you and keeps You There He blesses the righteous with favor compasses him with that favor as a shield favor which is grace of God Amen wonder how many times the devil has sought to take you out wonder how many times evil spirits have went to God and said if you just take your hand away I'll deal with that thing I I I'll work on them I I'll attack them with this and that and the other and God say wo they're not ready yet you just stay your hand and hold your peace until the hour arrived and then all of a sudden you come to that place in Christ where you can handle that battle and the next thing you know here it comes right you get discouraged you get upset you get worn out you feel like uh given up you go through all those human emotions and all those range of emotions and you do everything you can to regulate those feelings inside of you but let's be honest there's times that our mind and our spirit just can't keep up right stuff's moving so quick we can't keep up with it that's right and all of a sudden we come to that spot I think I'll just tell him I'll quit and here comes that Shield though he slay me yet I'll trust him it's a protection it's not punishment right Psalm 30:5 and we're talking about the favor of the Lord for just a little bit and I'm going to move on to humility God helping me Psalm chap 30:5 now now listen to these words these are important all the Bible's important but in terms of the thought today this is important to catch yes amen for his what anger for his anger now for those who don't think God gets angry right there you go oh he's a good god he's a just God he's a loving God he's all of that but sometimes he gets mad right where do you think you get it from right that's right uhhuh that's why the Bible said be angry and sin not there is a righteous anger that comes there is a a human response that all comes from God friends anger is the feeling according to the experts which I call them Eggheads not experts but anyways according to these people out here that think they're so smart compared to God ain't got a brain at all right they'll tell us that anger is the deep-seated feeling in the heart of wanting to see something change it's not changing you want it so badly that you get frustrated and that's what what triggers this emotion called anger is wanting to see change in it not happening though you try though you force it though you try to make it happen it just doesn't happen that's what anger is and it's all right to feel frustrated when you see something not going the way that it should you want it to go another way it's not it's okay to feel frustrated but just remember there's a line that you can't cross when you're angry cuz you will enter right into sin the Bible said be angry and sin not you'll enter right into a condition of unbelief and everything that goes with that yes so there is a range there is a degree that lay within anger now listen to me that you go so far and then you stop hallelujah amen and the Bible said his anger endureth but for a moment amen amen in other words God may get angry at us but he never crosses the line amen hallelujah he never crosses to that place to where I'm done with you you're going to cross the line that's it I'm done with you his anger endures but for a moment and in his favor is life his favor is what he puts Upon Our Lives and he sees us as being a certain type of people he knows that we're the right kind of kids and the right kind of children and he looks at us and sees us doing things or believing or acting or behaving in some way and God gets angry at us and say what is the matter with those kids I'm a Daddy too I love my young ons and and and I I I do anything for those girls within reason of course but I'd do anything for them if it was possible I'd be like the king with Esther I'd give up to half of the Kingdom if I thought they wouldn't turn around and spend it on shoes and purses and I I I love those onions but sometimes I get angry with them when I know that I've told them and taught them so do it this way and they don't do it I get angry with them sometimes I look down at him and I'll say girl I don't know how in the world was your brain working when you did such a thing what was you thinking when such and such happened and I make get so mad at I feel like shaking the tree out of them every leave just going on every way just shaking them like an old tree but they're my girls they're my blood amen my anger only endures for a moment and then I got to remember they're mine and if I remain angry at them I can't I can't help them progress if I remain angry at him I can't teach him to do better if I remain angry at him I can't encourage him to take the next steps right so the anger of God only endures for a moment CU after he realizes oh we've done this or done that or said this or said that his anger only endures long enough and then he comes back to himself so to speak and says but that's my boy that's my girl I got to go back remember his Mercy is knew every single morning amen so God may get mad but he don't get mad for Keeps hallelujah amen amen Joy look at this Joy comes in the morning hallelujah amen as God knows yeah okay all right speed bumping the road but tomorrow's a new day now look at this in Psalm chapter 30: 7 I love this statement he said Lord by thy favor thou Hast made my Mountain to stand strong thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled but thou has made my Mountain to stand strong now a mountain in the Bible symbolizes many different things one is inspiration we'll talk about that in a moment and if I don't get to it this morning I'll try to bring it in this evening this afternoon it'll bring inspiration to the child of God it is also the universal symbol of being near to God but a m in the Bible also symbolizes a place of a new beginning CU as a person walks through the valley David said it ye though I walk through the valley the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me as we walk through the valley we come through that Valley and what do we see but the beginning of Another Mountain so a mountain represents a new beginning so not only does the favor of God Compass us like a shield protects us not only does God's favor bring joy after anger and defeat but he also offers to us his favor offers to us a new beginning yes amen amen in other words have you ever heard somebody say I've gone too far I can't go back you ever heard that messed up too bad and never be fixed maybe they're drawing something other and they did some kind of a mistake on the thing and and and oh ruined it it'll never be better well if their Bob what's his name with the big curly hair they just take it and turn it into seagulls or some other kind of thing why cuz he learned that you know every mistake is actually maybe a a great inspir inspired piece of art hiding in that mistake right same thing that God does with us though it looks like the failure is great he always offers us a new beginning that's what his favor does Amen but now think of it contris remember I preached to you last time about Judas and the nature of Judas and how he was remember when Judas come to that place of no return and that spot to where he was going to completely turn down Christ and Satan was going to enter into him there was no new beginning for Judas but Peter who was not only got mad and swore and denied and big tough guy right Jesus walking on the water he jumped out from say hey Lord I'll walk out there always the big mouth of the group and and yet whenever he failed and went out there and wept bitterly 10 days later Jesus was standing before him and said now go on up to Jerusalem and go ter up there until you're endued from power on high why the favor of God always gives you a new beginning amen should have rendered a bigger amen and what it God Amen goly right God always offers us a new start and a fresh beginning you've heard me say it before let me say it again yesterday ended last night yesterday is gone sweet Jesus help me one day at a time am now listen to this in uh Luke 1:30 the angel of the Lord said unto Mary thou Hast found favor with God Amen what did Mary do what' she do what what was different about her than the other 700 95,000 Marys in the world was she the only virgin in the world the only young girl in the world no what was different about her was quite simply the fact that God had chose her to be the incubator it wasn't anything she done right no way that she acted no way that she behaved right but God chose her to be the incubator of the created body of God himself amen well Mary do they feed you better than the rest of them do you have better quarters than the rest of them what makes that that slave out there so much different he said that boy out there knows he's a King's son and he behaves like a King's son that's the way she was she was God's daughter and God was going to choose her to be that way it was nothing within her that she done right God by his grace said that's the one that I'm going to choose amen what kind of favor did Mary have with God think about it they tried to kill Jesus all the days that they had a chance to kill him lied on her and told all kinds of stories and made it up that she had some kind of a secret relationship with a Roman soldier was trying to covered up some spiritual thing that's history now right it's authentic history tried to put all kinds of things together to make it sound like something that it really wasn't and yet while Jesus was hang on the cross 33 and 1/2 years later he said behold thy mother why' he tell him that she had favor right to the very end amen amen not only did she have favor of God to Bear the very creative body of of Jesus Christ but it was so strange to her now listen close don't miss this part it was so strange to her that when the angel brother come to her and said you found favor she jumped back and said wait a minute what kind of salutation is [Laughter] this in her mind she couldn't understand why anybody would say such words to her does anybody know what I'm talking about you come to Christ in such a way you think why me Lord out of all of the people in the world did you choose to put your grace and mercy in why me out of all of the peoples of the world there were much better that you could have pulled out of the sheep coat but you chose me am Hallelujah am she kind of jumped back and said she wondered the Bible said she wondered what kind of salutation is this it's about the way some of yall are in church when God goes to telling loving on you telling you how great you are some of you'll start putting your head down and looking around and this way and that I've seen people get nervous because it's hard for us as humans to accept that God feels that way about us but he does am sir right it's not what you done it's what he done amen it's not our own righteousness but it's his righteousness now watch this uh let's pick up um oh there's so many places I could go let's pick up Romans chap 10:3 for just a moment and then let's see and maybe I can maybe I can start over here on this about humility I got a little time here I can bring it in I sing to you for 20 minutes so technically you got to go backwards 20 minutes for the preaching time sir amen Romans 10 and verse three for they be being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness if that ain't what done around us what is moms will do it dads will do it right preachers will do it deacons will do it trustees will do it any kind of leader any kind of person that has the ability to interpret what they think Holiness looks like they'll do it almost every time my girls and I just for the for the fun of it we're getting ready to go back through brother Jesse's book on Holiness and we're going to go piece by piece and talk about a few things lately we had the question come up about what does hair and dress and these things mean and I made a statement brother Jesse like this I said hair as far as hair goes what does God care about hair hair is just as much uh calcium and potes like like any other part of our body but it's not the hair itself but it's the symbol of Holiness that it represents amen right what is the dress all about they had robes in one day they had other outfits and you hear girls in this day and age that are trying to find a reason not dress with the dresses and things like that they well that ain't the way they dressed back then when they were talking that way but it's a symbol of Holiness in this day and age amen there're symbols like baptism and communion and foot washing they're symbols of what they represent to us amen they represent a Godly life and a holy lifej you take a woman for example that's got cancer and she's got brain cancer and they got to work on her they may have to shave her head all the way in order to do that well then you know some critic will run over and say well you ain't even got long hair but in God's eyes because her heart is right and she wants to be holy before the Lord and she's trying to be as obedient as she knows how God don't look at the links and all those kind of things like that he looks at the attitude and the demonstration of how she's adhering to the word of God and it's a symbol of Holiness to almighty God right as far as that goes what is a hat or breaches or anything else what was walking behind That Old Testament what did uh what did one hat have any difference in another hat it was a symbol of Holiness before God they represented that they were walking in a way that they felt was pleasing to the Lord to the best of their ability yes sir that's why they didn't eat pork that's why they didn't combine their clothes with other types of synthetics and whatever else may have been available in that day course wasn't synthetics but you get my meaning amen but some man-made handmade thing you know that wasn't pleasing to the Lord some denominational Creed you put in there right good right they weren allowed to mix it what was it but symbols of Holiness and a standard before God but righteousness being established by man will always produce the same vomit filthy rags cage of foul unclean Birds foul birds will produce that much as it would The Bootlegger the prostitute or the whoever whoever whoever on the street right cuzz God does not look at self-made Holiness as being a righteous thing that's right right sure we had a young lady some years ago that started backsliding and she was a party girl in the world and ran with everything in the world and done with whoever was out there and and and just you name it she did it and put a list together of all the sin and the wrong a person could commit and put a title her name is right at the top of the list she wanted to be the first in line to do all of the bad things a person could do until she met the Lord and tried to get saved and tried to live right well then she started backsliding and I told this young woman I said the problem I'm seeing is that you're trying to live the same exact life that you lived out there but you're doing it this time with a dress on and in the eyes of God friends we cannot produce a Holiness like that Holiness has to be something produced inside the Heart by the Holy Ghost holy dressing comes from a holy attitude if it's correct right and from a holy Revelation amen I I like was it you Christen or one of you girls whenever you got that that bunch and they said oh some man made you do this and some man and somebody spoke up out of the little group up here you know and said no man taught me to do this and no man told me to do them things right what is it that's God placing true Holiness inside a heart hallelujah hallelujah I want to tell you something friends that's what we're missing around our truth the kind of attitude that came by God's own hand we have followed man and followed their ideas and followed their Creeds and followed their leadership long enough away with Men's Leadership back to the leadership of the Holy Ghost hlj amen they that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons and daughters of God hallelujah amen and he said they have not submitted them themselves under the righteousness of God this word Paul uses is a condition that is acceptable to God a lot of people they get tripped up on things let me just give you a couple examples we'll move on in Oklahoma many years ago there's a sister she'd never cut her hair out want she come into the truth and she got her hair accidentally rolled up into the seat Bel they tried every way in the world even tried to take the seat belt apart to get her hair loose and she said one of the most heartbreaking days of my life is when they had to take P of scissors and cut that thing out like that and there's a fellow standing by and say ahuh jez Bel Jezebel but I said it's a symbol of Holiness God knows what her heart was and knows what it represented and knows what the trouble was How could a God who is Holy and just and understandable hold something like that against a dear sister that was heartbroken over having to go in such a route right didn't seem as though any other Alternatives and one fell spoke up and said well I to cut the seat Bel first to stay right with God I said you're an idiot that's your problem that's right idiotic stupid and foolish selfmade Holiness is what that is right laying upon people burdens that they themsel would never lift up right it's a phical attitude that's right our God ain't that kind of God people hallelujah he don't judge us for the things that we stumble into come on somebody preach to me a little while he don't judge us and throw us in hell for things that we cannot help right holds our standard even when we can always keep it he holds our standard he keeps our mountains strong Hallelujah yes and he Shields us from ever going further than that hallelujah amen amen and Hallelujah amen amen I think of the lady in Alaska that perig green told the story about brother B met her somewhere outside the outreaches of where they were going to the meeting she's going to guide him back in and there she's on that horse in a pair of britches like that and Perry said I was waiting any moment for brother randam to lay it on her he said said with that discernment brother Ram turned around after a bit and said Perry look around here at the conditions in this place the only way she could have been decent was to have a pair of them riding things on like that said she's trying to keep from freezing to death said she's not doing it to be a sinner she's doing it because the conditions are putting her in a place like that I know a lot of people would throw her in hell and condemn her over that very same thing but let me try to tell you something God don't look at selfmade righteousness and Holiness that's right am yes maybe that was her decision at the moment maybe she felt bad about it later maybe she didn't but in the eyes of God he's not going to put a lightning bolt right smacking our forehead every time we do something that that people think ain't just exactly that way right getting a quiet Church on me but I'm telling you the truth anyhow self Bay righteousness will never take us to the throne of God that's right circumstances sometimes will dictate that things have to happen in a certain manner or something like that these are attributes of life that we can't always help we got to roll with the punches to the best of our ability and do we always make the right choices no but neither is it better to kick oursel in the head every single day because we're caught in a situation that we don't know what the answer out is right right the best way is to throw yourself into the mercy of God and say Lord help me figure out the appropriate way to approach this amen sure and I don't agree with a woman wearing pants either but if I was up there in the freezing cold of Alaska 25 below Fahrenheit I might put on a Prayer Brides too if I was her I don't know we don't endorse things like that in the normal that's right but not all things are expedient friends right sometimes things will come into a situation how do you think it is with a woman who has living with a sinner husband the Bible said if they're contented to live together could you imagine what a yo-yo and a seesaw that is living with a man that you got a desire to serve God and want to be the right kind of woman and everything else and he's nothing but a filthy hearted human being got his mind on football and sports and everything all day long never talks about God maybe cusses out of both sides of his mouth and there she is in a corner praying and reading her Bible he might make fun of her and put her down and the least little mistake bothers her because of the Holy Ghost and he could care less if he was to blaspheme God tonight not all things were expedient but selfmade Holiness will never bring us into a place that's why brother R when he was talking about those situations it used to be a teaching many years ago that those women like that would keep their love and their affection from their husbands and brother Ram advised him in the cood he said don't do that that's right show them love that's your husband show him love and grace and mercy amen what I'm trying to say to you is self-made Holiness will never get us there I told you just a few examples I know you'll tighten up on it because it's easier to say am man to the other kind of preaching that it is this kind of stuff but this is where we're living at church that's right I'll just say it this way our young people are having to make decisions every day I'll say it that way they're confronted with situations every day from Social Media stuff to technological things out there to educational choices to uh you know everything else out there in the world they're confronted with all kinds of things that you and me US middle-aged people we don't even know what these kids are going through in this day and age right right it took us 4 days back in my time to get gossip to come back around the Grapevine they can get it all around the school to 5,000 people in a matter of a post that's right the age has pushed the envelope pushed the envelope into the place where now it's almost impossible to even have good sanity in a public school system right I I don't mean every school like that but I mean on the whole right with without the Holy Ghost our children walk right into the gates of hell every single day our teachers walk right smack into the gates of hell every single day it takes God to lead him right in the middle of those things amen amen and sometimes you have to overlook one thing to be able to get to another in a list of problems you have to try to figure out which one is the best to solve first right and everybody's got problems that ain't solved just yet well then how do I get God's favor to help me get there I got to stop focusing on every little detail and constantly trying to be pleasing to God and constantly am I am I am I right Lord I mean that's okay to have that that feeling wanting to be right with the Lord all the time but some people will drive themselves crazy with it never have no peace of God wondering if they've made a mistake it he's going to throw them away that's what I'm trying to preach to you this morning the favor of God doesn't leave you amen no matter what valleys you may be walking through Hallelujah his grace is always there even he said to Paul about his eyes he said don't worry my grace is there amen amen good I like that notice this in Romans chapter 5 verse 10 now going back from the 10th chapter the fifth chapter 10 and 11 I ain't going to get to humility I'll have to catch it this afternoon time's gone amen Romans 5: 10 and 11 I'm not trying to rush it I was just hoping to get it in that's right all right for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement at one meant separate the word a little bit at one amen that's what atonement means to make us at one with God hallelujah when Paul uses this word in the Greek listen what this means atonement in the Greek means the restoration of the favor of God Amen at one time I was an enemy at one time I was an outcast at one time I was a far off but his grace and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and his mercy and Calvary and the resurrection has now restored his favor back to me amen and back to you as Sons and Daughters he's give us his favor back amen he couldn't give it to us when we wern't saved as God can't put his favor and his approval upon our life as being as we were Sinners born in sin and S my mother conceived me and I was shape in iniquity came to the world speaking lies right but then when I went through justification sanctification and then the glass was set aside for service and he poured the buttermilk in Hallelujah that hour arrived Glory I not only received his holy ghost but his favor came restoring don't forget friends we are in a restoration message behold I send you Elijah the prophet to do what restore us back amen amen hallelujah and that's what God done for me and you yes amen so how do I get his favor how do I get it I've got to let him put his righteousness in me amen yeah that's one right I got to let him be the shield of my life amen and when he's angry with me I got to remember it only goes for a moment amen when I go through trials as he's got confidence and I found favor with him he trusts me and believes I can make it through it and then finally he's going to make my Mountain to stand strong amen every day and every way and every situation every circumstance he's going to give me a new beginning Amen in everything that I do and then the final element of the whole thing is what will talk about this afternoon God willing restoration of his favor also brings humility cuz listen the first thing God does when he saves you is give you humility amen amen true humility yes amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we so thank you for your word thank you Lord Jesus for the speaking of Thy word Lord we could read it we could hear it on a on a message and MP4 three or some other bit of Technology but Lord Jesus when you bring your truth to us through the spoken word it's just so personal and so real thank you for speaking to us and moving on us now Lord as we commit the remainder of this service to you

God's upset with me and you know I love what our brother said God's like a a parent he's mad for a moment but then he's faithful to for God and remind me that scripture in Psalms where the Lord pth his children I like that I love that thought just like you're talking about how a parent has to have that same pity towards their children he feels sorry for us but he's got to be he's got to show us that anger right's he's got to show us that mercy and that forgiveness praise God so I know the message was for me today I hope it was for somebody else as well by God's grace Hallelujah and like our

shield you only let me go so far amen hallelujah God thank God for Amazing Grace his favor is life God's favor made my Mountain strong praise God that reminded me of one of the greatest verses on favor that last year the Lord reminded me of in the Book of Psalms the Bible says because of God's favor my enemies have not triumphed over me yes that's the reason I don't fall away that's the reason I don't go into an awful sinful condition because of God's favor on my life amen I know he's favored me because I conquered over my enemies I triumphed over my enemies praise God oh I love it Grace Grace God's grace more of Grace to know Hallelujah we now received the atonement praise God I love that statement just ask the Lord to remind you of this I mentioned this on Wednesday Perfection is forgiveness now I said it in a little different way remember I I said how the the Kings would throw like Hezekiah would say Lord I've served you with a perfect heart how could he do that how was he perfect through the blood through the sacrifice and I said you can say the same thing I've served you with a perfect heart because I've confessed my sins that's beautiful Perfection is [Music] forgiveness does that resonate with anybody my God beautiful beautiful that's why I said you can throw yourself to the wall you some awful happen say God I've served you with a perfect heart I've been
