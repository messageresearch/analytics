[24:59] John 3:14 let's read verse 14 together
[25:07] John 3:14 on three if you're ready one
[25:11] two three and as Moses lifted up the
[25:14] serpent in the wilderness even so must
[25:17] the Son of Man be lifted up I'll read
[25:20] verse 15 that whosoever believeth in him
[25:22] should not perish but have eternal life
[25:26] verse 16 let's all read that together as
[25:29] well one two three for God so loved the
[25:32] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[25:35] that whosoever believeth in him should
[25:38] not perish but have everlasting life for
[25:42] God sent not his son into the world to
[25:43] condemn the world but that the world
[25:45] through him might be saved
[25:48] praise God let's have one more word of
[25:49] Prayer here tonight Heavenly Father what
[25:52] a glorious scripture Lord God one of the
[25:54] first ones I was ever taught to memorize
[25:56] John 3:16 Lord when I read it I see how
[25:59] Lord in the same passage you're speaking
[26:02] of this serpent that was lifted up Lord
[26:03] God it was lifted up Lord for salvation
[26:06] Lordan and you connect that Lord that
[26:09] natural healing to a spiritual healing a
[26:11] soul healing eternal life healing and no
[26:14] dark no doubt bodily healing as well
[26:16] Lord God for by your stripes were we
[26:19] healed Lord God so father we thank you
[26:22] Lord that you were lifted up between
[26:24] heaven and earth
[26:25] Lord you couldn't be in heaven and be a
[26:27] curse you could it be on the earth so
[26:29] you had to be in between and make a
[26:31] cross between heaven and earth make a
[26:33] bridge between heaven or thank you that
[26:36] the cross is the bridge Lord God so we
[26:38] can make it to heaven Lord God

[27:09] here tonight and trust me a blessing to
[27:11] you by the grace of God I love Good
[27:16] Friday cuz I never have to work on Good
[27:18] Friday and it gives me extra time in the
[27:21] Word of God so that's why I love this
[27:23] day I'm gonna switch over here and of
[27:25] course remember in the old rugged cross
[27:26] what a blessing
[27:28] so let's look I'll start with these
[27:31] thoughts on types of the cross and then
[27:35] I like to look at a few other thoughts
[27:37] that the Lord has inspired here so let's
[27:40] look at a few these scriptures now
[27:44] before we get to types of the cross
[27:48] let's go through and read about the
[27:50] cross again so let's go to Matthew 27
[27:54] let's just get a little bit of
[27:55] refreshment how many like little
[27:57] refreshment on the cross praise God it
[27:59] sure is a blessing to go back and see
[28:02] what God was doing on that specific day
[28:07] so Matthew chapter 27 now verses 1 & 2
[28:12] he's delivered to the sin or to Pilate
[28:15] rather and then Judas is in verse 3 to
[28:18] 10 he's interrogate arrogated by Pilate
[28:21] in verses 11 to 14 and then they choose
[28:25] Barabbas instead of Jesus in 15 to 25
[28:28] let's pick up at verse 26 where Barabbas
[28:31] is released and how many remember two
[28:34] years ago when I preached on this where
[28:36] were used by the Rams quotes and mother
[28:37] Graham said I was that Barabbas praise
[28:40] God I remember that you were Barabbas
[28:43] you were the one that should have been
[28:44] crucified but Christ took your place
[28:47] thank God for that
[28:48] amen verse 26 then released he Barabbas
[28:53] unto them and when he had scourge Jesus
[28:56] he delivered him to be crucified verse
[28:59] 27 then the soldiers of the governor
[29:00] took Jesus into the common Hall and
[29:02] gathered on him unto the whole band of
[29:05] so
[29:05] soldiers let's pick up there at verse 28
[29:09] and they stripped him now remember this
[29:12] was pure stripping there was no cloth on
[29:14] him like you see in the passion movie or
[29:16] any crucifixion movie he was just plain
[29:19] stripped naked and put on him a scarlet
[29:23] robe when they mocked him and when they
[29:25] had planted a crown of thorns they put
[29:28] it upon his head and a reed in his right
[29:30] hand and they bowed the knee before him
[29:32] and mocked him saying hail King of the
[29:34] Jews now yesterday at school we had a
[29:36] Bible club and it was about the cross
[29:39] and and one of the mothers went through
[29:42] all went through and made 80 packages
[29:44] with all these like stones like a stone
[29:47] representing the stone that was rolled
[29:48] away she put a coin represent in there
[29:50] how Jesus was over 30 pieces silver and
[29:52] she put a piece of a thorn in there off
[29:55] roses it's so striking to me the kids
[29:57] could look open up their bag and take
[29:59] out each one of these things represent
[30:00] the cross and one of the girls got cut
[30:03] and started bleeding from that thorn I
[30:05] thought my what a reminder now as awful
[30:08] as it is and these are just little
[30:11] thorns off of a beautiful rose you know
[30:13] just little thorns what an awful thing
[30:15] but what a reminder that Christ not only
[30:17] got one thorn he had a crown of thorns I
[30:20] mean I imagine that girl will remember
[30:22] that this year right sure her family
[30:24] does does attend church I imagine so
[30:27] remember I know what it's like to be cut
[30:30] by a thorn and what a reminder to to
[30:33] help us to think it and feel for Jesus
[30:36] as he was crowned with the crown of
[30:38] thorns not just a little bit I just won
[30:41] but a whole crowd man what a reality it
[30:44] is - to her no doubt and they mock him
[30:47] in verse 30 and they spit upon him and
[30:49] took the reed and smote him on the head
[30:51] and after that they had mocked him that
[30:55] they took the robe off from him put on
[30:57] his own own raiment on him and led him
[30:59] away to be crucified and as they came
[31:02] out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by
[31:04] name him they compelled to bear the
[31:07] cross now let me stop right there I got
[31:10] some quotes on Simon Cyrene I preached
[31:13] on him a couple years ago we know he was
[31:15] from Africa Libya I'm not mistaken I got
[31:19] some
[31:19] slides down here I'm just gonna jump
[31:21] down here to Simon the Cyrene but notice
[31:24] the verse 32 as they're leading him away
[31:27] to be crucified they found a man of
[31:31] Cyrene which is modern-day Libya in
[31:33] Africa Simon by name him they compelled
[31:37] to bear the cross so he didn't want to
[31:40] bear the cross they had to compel him
[31:43] you need to carry the cross and
[31:44] historically it's probably because the
[31:47] soldiers could see his blood loss they
[31:50] could you know they they already scourge
[31:51] him they could see how weak he was
[31:53] already remember he was up all night
[31:55] getting Jews in prison and question he
[31:58] was that he had to go through six trials
[32:00] can you imagine that six trials in one
[32:02] night and they'd already scourge him he
[32:05] lost all this blood and they could tell
[32:07] this man cannot he cannot carry this
[32:10] cross and live but remember the the
[32:13] commission from Pilate was he's got to
[32:14] be crucified they couldn't let him die
[32:17] here before they went up to Gao Gotha
[32:20] because if he did then they didn't they
[32:22] didn't fulfill pilots requirement he had
[32:25] to be crucified so they they pulled
[32:27] somebody and say Simon you've got a you
[32:30] you've got to carry his cross he didn't
[32:32] want to do it I mean which which one of
[32:34] us would want to do that he didn't want
[32:36] to do it but they compelled him and so
[32:39] we learned a few things from Simon the
[32:41] Cyrene we learned that he was a real man
[32:43] if you go to mark go to mark 1521 here's
[32:49] a few important things we learned about
[32:50] Simon the Cyrene mark 1521 the script
[33:02] tells us here and they compel one Simon
[33:07] a Cyrenian who passed by coming out of
[33:08] the country the father of Alexander and
[33:10] Rufus two barons cross I remember marks
[33:14] riding this mark wasn't there but he's
[33:17] riding it like Luke Mark and Luke
[33:19] weren't there
[33:20] they're just riding down the accounts
[33:22] they've seen and they wanted to have a
[33:24] witness and they had to make sure that
[33:26] this was written down correctly this
[33:28] Gospel of Mark and so notice he records
[33:32] even his two sons names right Alexander
[33:35] and Rufus because it seems like later in
[33:39] the scripture Peter or Paul writes a
[33:42] letter to the church the Christians in
[33:43] Rome and Rufus is one of those believers
[33:47] so it's almost like mark records this
[33:50] because Simon we don't know if Simon was
[33:53] saved or not but it seems like his
[33:55] children were saved because Paul salutes
[33:59] Rufus who was living in Rome so let's
[34:01] read that let's go to Roman's 1613
[34:06] because if you were writing a letter and
[34:08] you wanted people to to know that these
[34:10] things were true you'd have to call out
[34:11] people that were living that at that
[34:13] time right you'd have till you'd write
[34:15] it and say well that's because Simon's
[34:16] sons are still living today to give
[34:18] proof that these people actually
[34:19] experienced Simon was a real man you can
[34:22] go talk to him he knows what it's like
[34:24] to carry the cross of Christ amen
[34:28] my Roman 1613 he said salute Rufus
[34:34] chosen to the Lord and his mother and
[34:36] mine
[34:38] praise God so it seems like Rufus was
[34:42] according to historians was a real
[34:44] believer he was chosen and no doubt his
[34:47] daddy was chosen to carry the cross now
[34:52] so that's that's one reason Simon is
[34:54] brought up because he was a real person
[34:57] they wouldn't know he's a real person
[34:59] also the second thing he's a foreigner
[35:02] now brother BAM said Ethiopian but it
[35:03] looks like from Libya Libya and he
[35:07] actually helped Jesus now Libya is
[35:10] mentioned in Acts chapter 2 verse 10 so
[35:12] Libya was one of those nations that
[35:14] heard the same
[35:15] speak in tongues on the day of Pentecost
[35:17] course in their own language amen
[35:19] it understood language and so Simon
[35:23] steps in to help the help Jesus just
[35:26] like the angel who came to help Jesus
[35:29] when he was praying in the Garden of
[35:31] Gethsemane to finish his calling
[35:33] so Jesus needed help from angel he need
[35:36] to angel help to do this
[35:38] and he needed man's help to do this
[35:40] praise God and I tell you this if
[35:42] anybody helps out a Christian if anybody
[35:45] helps out Jesus they have a reward amen
[35:49] so God is giving Simon he chose Simon to
[35:52] be one of the helpers to help out Christ
[35:54] the Messiah himself carry his cross and
[35:57] no doubt Simon will get a great reward
[35:59] for that because just like the angel
[36:03] came in the garden Jesus could not have
[36:05] done it without the help of the angel or
[36:07] else God would not have sent him right
[36:08] he needed the help of the angel and so
[36:12] God gave help through an angel to endure
[36:14] this cross remember church crucifixion
[36:17] was the absolute worst death it still is
[36:19] the worst death the person could ever go
[36:21] through it was perfected it wasn't it
[36:24] wasn't even invented yet when David
[36:26] wrote about the crucifixion my bone
[36:28] stare at me
[36:29] it wasn't even invented now in fact the
[36:32] Grecians and actually started it and and
[36:34] then it was perfected by the Romans and
[36:36] it was the worst death because she had
[36:39] to die naked and you had to die alone
[36:41] and and even Roman citizens themselves
[36:44] were never crucified even Rome wouldn't
[36:48] allow their own citizens to die by
[36:50] crucifixion it had to be a foreigner and
[36:52] they would kill these men publicly
[36:54] crucify them as examples to the Roman
[36:57] citizens and all the foreigners that you
[36:59] don't go against Rome and so Jesus not
[37:02] really being a Roman right not being he
[37:05] had to be killed this way and he was
[37:08] killed publicly and given the worst
[37:10] death that could possibly be given and
[37:14] it's the worst death also because you
[37:17] have to die alone all the other deaths
[37:20] if they cut your head off it's a human
[37:21] that does it right or if they spear you
[37:24] or whatever they do another human caused
[37:26] you to die but when you're crucified
[37:28] you die from your own self you get so
[37:31] tired you get so uh your diaphragm
[37:34] collapses and you're just trying to get
[37:36] a breath you have to die alone it's the
[37:38] absolute work that worse death if
[37:40] somebody could ever suffer and Jesus
[37:42] needed angel help to do it amen
[37:45] oh they do Yeah right he was the
[37:49] suffering Savior hallelujah he was
[37:51] willing he knew as a heaven brother amen
[37:53] he knew he but he's the Bible said he
[37:55] did it for the joy that was set before
[37:56] him and he did it through great crying's
[38:00] and tears no doubt if Jesus was around
[38:03] there Jerusalem there he would have seen
[38:05] people crucified they would have seen it
[38:07] was part of their everyday life and
[38:09] that's why the the historians the the
[38:12] the Gospel writers they don't put a lot
[38:14] of details about crucifixion in their
[38:16] Gospels because the people knew about it
[38:18] it was very familiar they didn't need to
[38:21] but now we need to go back and see and
[38:23] people examine it so we could understand
[38:25] how awful was it because we it's not
[38:28] acceptable in our society but Jesus
[38:31] prayed so desperately let's go to
[38:33] Hebrews five seven through nine and I
[38:39] read one place where people could live
[38:41] that were crucified four days can you
[38:43] imagine four days walking past the same
[38:45] person died just getting weaker it
[38:47] depends what if they were in good
[38:49] physical health and then their scourging
[38:52] wasn't that bad they could live for days
[38:55] just dying and people and it was other
[38:57] people's job the Roman government
[39:00] encouraged Romans to walk by and mock
[39:02] them and spit on them and make fun of
[39:04] them and hit them it was all part of the
[39:07] Roman society to try to curb violence
[39:11] and crime it was all meant to do that
[39:14] and so can you imagine as a child of
[39:16] your four days you walked by this man
[39:18] day-in day-out and then the animals wild
[39:21] animals would jump up and kill them and
[39:24] what brains was flying and pluck at them
[39:26] and because they're dying I mean it just
[39:28] it's the absolute worst it's the lowest
[39:31] disrespect you could ever give to a
[39:32] person yet jesus knew what he had to do
[39:35] and he did it Church for you and I amen
[39:39] Hebrews five seven nine
[39:41] in the days as flesh we need to offer to
[39:43] prayers and supplications with strong
[39:45] crying in tears unto him that was able
[39:48] to save from death and was heard and
[39:50] that he feared so God heard his strong
[39:52] crying's and his groaning he knew every
[39:56] he knew he'd seen people crucified he
[39:58] knew the awful pain he was going to have
[40:02] to suffer but he's willing to do it for
[40:05] the joy that was set before him for
[40:08] though he were a son yet he learned he
[40:10] obedience by the things which he
[40:11] suffered and being made perfect he
[40:14] became the author of eternal salvation
[40:15] unto all them that obey Him amen
[40:19] see strong crying tears he say help me
[40:24] God and God sends an angel and helps him
[40:26] amen hallelujah God sends the angel
[40:30] gives enough strength to go through the
[40:32] trial trials all night the imprisonment
[40:34] the the scourging the beating the
[40:37] whipping the spitting the hitting on the
[40:39] head gives him the strength to make it
[40:41] through there and just when he's ready
[40:43] to die God allows Simon compels him
[40:46] pulls him out to carry the cross I'll do
[40:48] it for you he said I've got to do it for
[40:50] you Jesus my brother man said because
[40:57] Simon was African he said it just shows
[41:00] God cares about the Jew right God cares
[41:02] about the African God cares about
[41:04] everybody and even if you give it a
[41:07] Christian a cup of cold water the name
[41:09] of Lord you'll have a reward so no doubt
[41:12] Simon will have a reward first step
[41:15] begin to carry this the cross thirdly
[41:17] Simon is a beautiful example he's a
[41:21] picture of what a true disciple does now
[41:23] turn your Bibles to Luke 23 26 let's go
[41:26] back there Luke 20
[41:34] 26 look at this
[41:41] picture here notice and as they led him
[41:44] away they laid hold upon one Simon a
[41:47] Cyrenian coming out of country and on
[41:51] him they laid the cross that he might
[41:53] bear after Jesus so Jesus goes before
[41:58] can you imagine they're just kind of
[41:59] pushing him and beating her he would die
[42:01] he would die if he had to carry that
[42:02] cross they're pushing him in a beating
[42:04] him along and he's he's all dripping
[42:06] blood he's just you can't recognize we
[42:08] don't look like a man but Simon is
[42:11] behind him carrying the cross he's
[42:14] following Jesus amen and it's so perfect
[42:19] because in Luke 9:23 I'll turn there
[42:23] it's such a perfect picture of
[42:25] discipleship and this is why you'll hear
[42:28] brother Branham say we got to follow the
[42:30] bloody footprints of Christ amen glory
[42:35] he said and he said to them all If any
[42:38] man will come after me let him deny
[42:39] himself take up his cross daily and
[42:41] follow me amen
[42:45] so Simon is behind he's following and no
[42:48] doubt he's bleed oh Jesus bleeding and
[42:50] he's able to follow those bloody
[42:52] footprints yet he's carrying the cross
[42:54] and it's a beautiful picture of how you
[42:57] and I must carry the same cross of Jesus
[43:00] Christ
[43:01] we carry a heavy burden right we live
[43:04] our lives and although there's days of
[43:06] great joy there's always a burden we got
[43:08] to carry whether we're rejected or
[43:11] whether we're laughed at or made fun of
[43:12] or whether we God allows us to be sick
[43:16] or God allows us to lose a loved one at
[43:18] a young age whatever the burden is
[43:20] whatever the cross that we must be a
[43:23] bear is we've still got to carry it and
[43:25] we've got to be willing to follow Jesus
[43:27] all the way to the cross amen
[43:30] till death sets us free hallelujah
[43:33] that's right what a picture of
[43:36] discipleship praise God and he was
[43:39] compelled than that doesn't that work
[43:41] compare our mind he had to kind of be
[43:43] pushed into it right you kind of had to
[43:45] be you better do this right you need to
[43:47] do this I remember jesus said when we're
[43:50] the last days we've got to compel them
[43:53] to come into the marriage supper
[43:55] so we've got to use compelling - you
[43:58] really need to read this book
[44:00] my pastor wrote right you really need to
[44:03] come to church and hear the message this
[44:06] hour you really need to listen this
[44:07] sermon that we put on YouTube you know
[44:11] you really need to hear the message of
[44:13] William Branham right whatever whatever
[44:14] tool or whatever witnessing opportunity
[44:20] you're gonna give you've got to compel
[44:22] people you really should do this this
[44:24] changed my life just as he was compelled
[44:29] to carry the cross we've got to carry
[44:31] we've got to compel people to carry
[44:33] their cross - and come and follow Jesus
[44:36] you should come to church you should
[44:38] repent we've got to compel each other
[44:40] amen so it's a beautiful picture of
[44:46] discipleship and lastly I like this it's
[44:49] a picture of sudden unexpected cross
[44:51] bearing and I think that's a beautiful
[44:55] picture don't you
[44:55] he wasn't he was just there right he was
[44:58] just there probably for the feast we're
[44:59] not sure why Simon's there but he's just
[45:01] compelled to do it
[45:02] because he came out of the country was
[45:04] coming out of the country and as they're
[45:06] as they're going on the the procession
[45:08] to go Gotha they just compel him you get
[45:10] over here and you help us out you help
[45:13] up this man being crucified out so it's
[45:17] a great picture we don't know when God's
[45:19] going to call us to take the cross but
[45:22] we got to be willing to carry the cross
[45:24] amen
[45:26] especially like when unexpected things
[45:28] happen in our lives we weren't expecting
[45:30] this now it's a burden now it's a now
[45:33] it's a life-changing event it was so
[45:36] unexpected well it might have been
[45:37] unexpected to us but God had it in his
[45:39] great plan all that's all along and
[45:41] we've got to be willing to accept the
[45:43] burden we've got to be willing accept
[45:45] that the cross that God allows us to
[45:48] carry all right good praise Lord now
[45:51] let's head back there let's go back to
[45:54] Matthew 27 we left off
[46:02] all right verse
[46:04] 33 when they were coming to the place
[46:06] called Golgotha that is to say a place
[46:08] of a skull
[46:09] they gave him vinegar to drink mingle
[46:13] with gall and when he had tasted thereof
[46:15] he would not drink and they crucified
[46:20] him and parted his garments casting Lots
[46:22] that it might be fulfilled which was
[46:24] spoken by the Prophet they part of my
[46:26] garments among them and upon my vesture
[46:29] they did cast lots and sitting down they
[46:33] watched him there and set up over his
[46:36] head his accusation written this is
[46:39] Jesus the King of the Jews
[46:42] then were there two thieves crucified
[46:44] with him one on the right and other on
[46:46] the left and they that passed by reviled
[46:50] him wagging their heads and saying thou
[46:52] that destroys the temple ministered in
[46:54] three days save thyself if thou be the
[46:57] Son of God come down from the cross
[46:59] likewise also the chief priests mocking
[47:02] him with the scribes and elders and said
[47:04] he saved others himself he cannot say if
[47:06] he be the king of Israel let him come
[47:08] down now from the cross and we will
[47:11] believe him verse 43 he trusted in God
[47:16] let him deliver him now if he will have
[47:18] him for he said I am the son of God the
[47:21] thieves also which were crucified with
[47:23] him cast the same in his tC oh what a
[47:27] picture church I know we say that often
[47:28] but look how merciful God is people the
[47:31] only very thief on his right that would
[47:33] get saved in a few minutes is still
[47:35] saying the same thing to him he was just
[47:38] as guilty as everybody else but his last
[47:40] moments he asked for mercy amen live
[47:43] kind of the Holy Spirit even in your
[47:45] worst situation even in your lowest spot
[47:47] he's died look how the Holy Spirit was
[47:50] still working there the Holy Spirit had
[47:52] to leave Jesus so he could be cursed but
[47:54] the Holy Spirit was still there to bring
[47:56] that man to repentance and salvation
[47:58] amen you see you see here people say
[48:01] where was the Holy Spirit there why
[48:02] where's all these spirit if he wasn't on
[48:04] Jesus he was right there trying to win
[48:06] souls amen
[48:08] the Bible said the eyes of the Lord go
[48:10] forth around all the earth seeking
[48:12] someone that will honor God and serve
[48:14] God someone has a pure heart and
[48:17] I found up your heart amen but it wasn't
[48:20] always Pierre he's even their Machens
[48:22] mocking them the Bible says cast the
[48:25] same and his teeth see they're sneaking
[48:27] right through their teeth they're angry
[48:29] if you're the Son of God do something
[48:31] you see their faces the Bible reads it
[48:34] like that on purpose because it shows
[48:36] you how quickly a heart can change amen
[48:38] Lorie amen thank you Jesus
[48:42] now from the sixth hour there was
[48:44] darkness over all the land under the
[48:46] ninth hour the six hours noon so from
[48:50] noon to 3:00 there's darkness all over
[48:52] the land God turned out the lights on on
[48:55] earth amen hallelujah God was saying
[48:59] he's becoming dead he's becoming sin the
[49:02] very holy one the very perfect one has
[49:05] become a curse amen and about the ninth
[49:09] hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
[49:11] saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is
[49:16] to say my God my God why is there
[49:18] forsaken me so we are not sure when the
[49:21] Holy Spirit left Jesus probably the
[49:23] Garden of Gethsemane remember he still
[49:25] healed that man
[49:26] Malchus right the servants the soldier
[49:31] of the servant there he still had the
[49:32] holy spirit 19 to heal his ear at Peter
[49:34] cutoff so somewhere between there after
[49:38] that healing and here somewhere the Holy
[49:40] Spirit left him and then he cries out
[49:43] God you forsaken me my God my god watch
[49:47] out for sake of me showing to God and
[49:49] turned his back on his son right and God
[49:53] even showed it by turning off the light
[49:55] from the Sun I'm not going to let the
[49:58] Sun Shine on him because he's he so he
[50:01] has the Beast he's cursed all the curse
[50:04] of all your sins and my sin was on him
[50:07] and got it and turned his back and God
[50:09] had to forsake him that you and I won't
[50:12] be forsaken amen hallelujah my God my
[50:16] God why have you forsaken me at church
[50:19] we never have the opportunity to say
[50:20] that because God is always with us amen
[50:25] we should be saying
[50:27] my God my God help me to see you in this
[50:30] situation I don't see you help me to see
[50:32] you and help me to trust that you have
[50:34] not forsaken me let me not give in to
[50:37] the devil's lie that you have forsaken
[50:39] me because the Bible said he cannot
[50:41] forsake us amen he cannot leave us and
[50:46] some of them that stood there when they
[50:47] heard that they said this man calls for
[50:49] Elias nope he called for God and
[50:52] straightway one of them ran and took a
[50:54] sponge and filled it with vinegar and
[50:55] put it on a reed and gave him the drink
[50:57] the rest said let be let us see whether
[50:59] a lice will come to save him Jesus when
[51:03] he had cried again with a loud voice
[51:05] yielded up the ghost let's just we'll
[51:09] read 51 then we'll stop right there and
[51:11] behold the veil of the temple was rent
[51:13] in twain from the top to the bottom and
[51:15] the earth did quake and the rocks read
[51:17] he imagined such can you imagine such a
[51:20] earthquake that would rip veil on a
[51:24] 30-foot high veil a cloth veil think
[51:29] about it you think about like if it tore
[51:31] not you're ripped apart the wall I mean
[51:32] you'd have to have a huge shift in order
[51:35] to lift this 30 foot really thick strong
[51:39] veil you have to have a major earthquake
[51:41] and so the light the sun's out
[51:43] earthquakes happening and the Romans
[51:46] sent it looks like it's up I said this
[51:48] has to be the son of God
[51:50] amen God was letting everyone see that
[51:53] this was a son he was paying the full
[51:56] price of all the sins past present and
[51:59] future
[52:00] and God was letting everyone see this is
[52:03] my lamb this is my sacrifice or he's
[52:06] curse that you might not be cursed that
[52:08] you might be blessed amen glory let's
[52:12] look at some of the types of Christ here
[52:15] brother man I'm just going to go through
[52:16] a few of these thing there seven he said
[52:19] notice in the butcher and the Baker one
[52:20] was refused one was rejected like the
[52:22] two thieves at the cross a perfect type
[52:25] can you say amen to that
[52:26] amen praise God little man and I just
[52:30] typed in cross and types and I found
[52:33] seven different ones from brother
[52:34] branham of course there's more I'll go
[52:36] through those in just a moment that's a
[52:39] tie
[52:39] the cross Jesus or Joseph in prison two
[52:43] men with him - yeah one dies and one
[52:47] lives and that's speaking of eternal
[52:49] salvation praise God amen number two
[52:52] Israel through the Red Sea brother man
[52:54] said the church ought to be pressing
[52:56] everywhere to hear the word of God
[52:57] staying with the word so I'm so glad you
[52:59] pressed your way out to the house of God
[53:01] tonight that's what the real church
[53:02] ought to be doing he says we're the
[53:05] church now tour the church spiritual
[53:07] just like Israel was the church natural
[53:08] we were brought out of bondage human
[53:10] bonded just like Israel's brought out of
[53:12] Egyptian bondage you believe that we
[53:14] come across we had to sacrifice to come
[53:16] out by the blood of the lintel the door
[53:19] in the post just across perfectly no one
[53:22] wants to go out to go under the blood
[53:24] after once coming in until they can't
[53:26] the call came to go out they crossed
[53:29] Jordan across the Red Sea a type of the
[53:32] blood sanctifying power of God killing
[53:34] all sin nature
[53:35] sin behind you the taskmasters the
[53:38] cigarettes the whiskey the road houses
[53:40] and the picture shows everything that
[53:43] bothered you back there and hindered
[53:44] your Christian experience died in the
[53:47] blood of Jesus Christ yes sir brother
[53:49] amen all your bandages all your
[53:53] addictions all the things that that
[53:54] bothered you it all was buried it all
[53:57] drowned in the sea and the blood of
[53:59] Jesus Christ a perfect type of Christ he
[54:05] says and they marched over how beautiful
[54:07] the types of our churches today how that
[54:09] they crossed the Red Sea and then Moses
[54:10] begin to sing in the spirit man picked
[54:13] up a tambourine began to dance it's like
[54:15] an old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting
[54:16] dancing dancing and praising or why they
[54:19] had to victory they got the victory
[54:22] thank God for the victory amen
[54:24] number three Isaac but then it said
[54:26] Abraham when he was old he believed and
[54:28] God told him to go and he obeyed and all
[54:30] just rode out I can see him take the
[54:32] servants the little mules and start out
[54:33] they get to the Mount of God I just love
[54:36] this this and this he said to the
[54:37] servants you say here while we go yonder
[54:39] in the land I shall return home I excuse
[54:42] me my emotion gets me from sometimes the
[54:44] land I shall return how I don't know I'm
[54:47] going up there to kill him and he says
[54:50] he knows somehow someway you return
[54:53] and here he had a knife sticking in his
[54:55] belt and he laid the wood on Isaac's
[54:57] shoulders and Isaac went up the hill led
[54:59] by Abraham beautiful type his only son
[55:02] taking him to the hill and the very
[55:05] altar that he had laid his son on he
[55:07] packed it up the hill on his back
[55:09] a type of God sending his son up Gow
[55:12] Gotha with the wooden cross on his back
[55:14] the very cross he was nailed on where
[55:17] the Bible said God spared not his own
[55:19] son
[55:19] amen Isaac taking that own cross up
[55:23] there just like Jesus had to carry it
[55:25] right but then they had to get Simon
[55:26] Cyrene to finish the job the very the
[55:29] very type the one who's to be crucified
[55:32] carries the cross right MA thank the
[55:37] Lord
[55:37] beautiful type Abel's blood sacrifice in
[55:41] Genesis chapter 4 the Bible said God
[55:43] received Abraham's sacrifice I'm sorry
[55:46] Abel's sacrifice but he rejected Cain's
[55:48] and the Bible said I can see Abel he
[55:52] gets a little grapevine reached out a
[55:54] little male lamb first from the old
[55:57] mother you wrap this vine around his
[55:59] neck and here he comes dragging him not
[56:01] much beauty is that is there pulling her
[56:04] up there then he got him up there a big
[56:05] rock laying at the east end of the gate
[56:08] came probably told all year to make the
[56:10] best crop that he could thought he could
[56:12] please God by that notice the beautiful
[56:15] type here he comes dragging little lamb
[56:17] pulling him along
[56:18] I could imagine little fellow falling
[56:20] probably knew what was near dragging his
[56:22] little feet perfect type of Christ
[56:24] dragging the cross God's lamb coming
[56:27] down through Jerusalem fouling week here
[56:30] come the little fellow beating along and
[56:32] when he got into the great rock laid him
[56:34] upon the rock taking a piece of sharp
[56:36] rock I don't know I guess they had no
[56:38] knives in those days laid him like that
[56:40] took him by the back of his head and
[56:42] pulled him up like this or the rock and
[56:44] began to chop as in a throat and the
[56:46] rock began to beat through his throat
[56:50] striking and on that rock died the Lamb
[56:54] bleeding blood splashing his little
[56:56] arteries cut the blood flying all over
[56:58] his little white will become bathed that
[57:01] red with blood God looked down from
[57:04] heaven and said that's it now you got it
[57:06] the way the blood spurting out his
[57:09] little veins amen and so this is Abel
[57:12] sacrifices he's striking at the lamb and
[57:15] it's all bloody and God said that's the
[57:18] way and then Cain tries to bring
[57:20] beautiful fruit and said God said that's
[57:22] not it
[57:24] salvation only comes by death and death
[57:27] is never easy right and God the only way
[57:30] God can save is through substitution
[57:33] because you and I can't save ourselves
[57:34] we need a substitute to take our place
[57:37] amen it's never pretty
[57:40] salvations never pretty if you got saved
[57:42] it was pretty you probably didn't get
[57:44] saved amen but if you got saved and you
[57:47] were weeping and crying rejoicing and
[57:49] dying out and you felt like you were
[57:51] totally ripped apart and fully repented
[57:54] and you felt like you died then you can
[57:56] understand what it was like for Abel
[57:58] amen because that's what Abel had to go
[58:00] through the bleeding the diagram the
[58:02] mess of animal sacrifice was a perfect
[58:05] type of Jesus Christ hallelujah what was
[58:11] it the Son of God 1,900 something years
[58:13] ago he was led from prison he was taken
[58:15] to the judgment seat from there to the
[58:17] Hall of scourging from up there up Gotha
[58:19] pulled up his Hill Simon the Cyrene
[58:21] helping him bear the cross and there
[58:23] died on the Rock of Ages with his blood
[58:26] beat out of him his body strip stripped
[58:29] or striped great big old globs of his
[58:32] maken soldiers spit on his face he said
[58:35] of my kingdom was of this world I'd
[58:37] asked my father he gave me legions of
[58:39] angels that would come and fight for me
[58:40] but this is not my kingdom but died
[58:43] kingdom come Thy will be done and it
[58:45] will be here pretty soon thy kingdom
[58:47] come Thy will be done
[58:48] glory when Billy Sunday said one time in
[58:53] every tree said an angel he just pulled
[58:56] your hand loose and put your finger
[58:58] that's all you'll have to do we'll
[58:59] settle the question down their mind
[59:01] ain't that the truth
[59:02] remember Jesus said I could call for
[59:05] twelve legions of angels he told Pilate
[59:08] he said but I'm not going to do it so go
[59:11] to him says Billy Sunday taught us that
[59:13] angels are sitting in every tree just
[59:15] waiting for the moment we'll help you
[59:17] we'll bring you down just like we
[59:19] strengthen you in the
[59:20] well strengthen you we'll bring you back
[59:22] to the health again and Jesus had that
[59:25] temptation but he knew God's will was
[59:27] not to deliver himself but to be
[59:29] delivered for you and I so he let those
[59:32] angels sit there and watch him and no
[59:35] doubt they wanted to help right but he
[59:37] said he kept himself from calling for
[59:39] deliverance he still suffered he chose
[59:42] to suffer that we didn't have to twelve
[59:45] thousand twelve legions rather twelve
[59:47] legions of angels I read somewhere that
[59:49] legions have at least 3,000 soldiers the
[59:52] twelve times three over thirty-six
[59:53] probably thirty almost forty thousand
[59:55] angels right around there he says don't
[59:58] you know I could call from heaven and my
[1:00:00] father would send twelve legions of
[1:00:01] angels I have all this help but the
[1:00:04] purpose is not to be delivered right now
[1:00:06] from from fleshly plane the purpose is
[1:00:08] to pay the sacrifice of all the sins of
[1:00:10] humanity
[1:00:13] Caiaphas looked and said oh he saved
[1:00:15] others himself he cannot save it was the
[1:00:17] greatest compliment ever paid to him
[1:00:20] idea the greatest compliment he saved
[1:00:24] others he can't save himself it was the
[1:00:26] greatest compliment if he saved himself
[1:00:28] he couldn't save others so he gave his
[1:00:30] life that he could save others
[1:00:32] hallelujah Amen what a compliment Amen
[1:00:35] he didn't save himself he didn't take
[1:00:38] the easy road he took the hard road he
[1:00:41] took God's Way amen the greatest
[1:00:44] compliment you could play he didn't save
[1:00:47] himself praise God
[1:00:49] he said all we like sheep have gone
[1:00:51] astray God laid upon the iniquity of us
[1:00:53] all he was led to the slaughter and like
[1:00:55] a sheep led like a sheep done before the
[1:00:58] shears opened out his mouth yet he was
[1:01:00] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[1:01:01] for our iniquity the chastisement of our
[1:01:03] peace was upon him and with His stripes
[1:01:05] were healed how could you reject such
[1:01:07] masters love amen he said to see him as
[1:01:12] he goes staggering up the hillside poor
[1:01:14] little weak frail body bending beneath
[1:01:16] the load that's why they had to call
[1:01:19] Simon out number five the brass serpent
[1:01:22] rodenticide now notice when these people
[1:01:24] had sinned against God and against Moses
[1:01:26] they sinned against God by speaking
[1:01:28] against God and speaking against his
[1:01:30] leader and now I want you to notice God
[1:01:32] told Moses to go
[1:01:33] make something make a serpent hanging on
[1:01:35] a pole now it was a serpent that was the
[1:01:38] death bite and he made it out of brass
[1:01:40] and hung it on a pole now what that
[1:01:42] represented the first thing the people
[1:01:45] had sinned and were dying of sickness
[1:01:47] now watch the compound reason they were
[1:01:50] sin and were dying of sickness because
[1:01:51] of sin and all sin is direct or either
[1:01:54] direct cause all sickness rather caused
[1:01:57] by sin before we had any sin we had no
[1:02:00] sickness and sicknesses in the hatchery
[1:02:01] to sin maybe not what you've done but
[1:02:04] what someone else done before you
[1:02:05] inherited sickness is an attribute of
[1:02:08] sin now God showing you the type now the
[1:02:12] first thing the pole represents the
[1:02:13] cross the wood the serpent itself being
[1:02:16] a serpent spoke of sin already judged
[1:02:18] for God had judged the serpent in the
[1:02:20] Garden of Eden but brass spoke of divine
[1:02:22] judgment was like the brazen Laver in
[1:02:25] the days of Elijah looked out and he
[1:02:27] said the sky looks like grass divine
[1:02:29] judgment over all the country no rain
[1:02:31] and now notice that these people had to
[1:02:35] look or behold that brass serpent the
[1:02:37] serpent couldn't pray for them they just
[1:02:38] had to look and live and it was for a
[1:02:41] compound reason to take away their sin
[1:02:43] and to heal their sickness praise God
[1:02:46] and Jesus over there speaking as Moses
[1:02:49] lifted up the brass serpent awareness
[1:02:50] the same reason must have Son of Man be
[1:02:53] lifted up now if the type done the
[1:02:56] healing what about the anti-type if the
[1:02:59] brass serpent the shadow done the
[1:03:00] healing what will Christ do - look at
[1:03:02] him look and live my brother look there
[1:03:04] Jesus now in the hymn amen if a natural
[1:03:08] brass serpent would cause healing and
[1:03:10] forgiveness how much more we're looking
[1:03:13] at Jesus Christ the real Jesus Christ
[1:03:15] today how much will that today bring
[1:03:18] both bodily healing and spiritual soul
[1:03:20] healing amen what a beautiful type it
[1:03:25] was our sin it was our sin right that
[1:03:27] causes the get bit by the snakes right
[1:03:29] but yet God made a way out of that and
[1:03:32] all she got to do is look away from our
[1:03:34] trouble and look to Christ and he'll
[1:03:36] heal us amen thank God how
[1:03:45] I'm gonna just move past that number six
[1:03:47] listen you're familiar with - this is
[1:03:50] from the fifth seal when Joseph brought
[1:03:53] his two sons to his father Jacob Jacob
[1:03:56] was supposed to bless them but member
[1:03:58] the Bible said that his hands were
[1:04:00] crossed I want to read it from this
[1:04:01] quote from the revelation of Jesus
[1:04:03] Christ he says now Joseph on Egypt was
[1:04:08] given a Gentile bride and through her he
[1:04:11] received a family of Gentile of two sons
[1:04:13] Ephraim and Manasseh Joseph asked of his
[1:04:16] father to bless the two boys he placed
[1:04:18] him in front of Jacob so that Manasseh
[1:04:20] the first boar would be on Jacobs right
[1:04:22] hand and Ephraim on his left as Jacob
[1:04:26] was about to bless that me cross his
[1:04:28] hands so that the right hand would fall
[1:04:29] upon the younger Joseph cried out not so
[1:04:33] father this is the firstborn to your
[1:04:35] right but Jacob said God has cost my
[1:04:37] hands amen so Ephraim was brought on
[1:04:41] this side Manasseh was on that side
[1:04:42] because the right hand represented
[1:04:44] blessing and authority and so the Jacob
[1:04:48] felt letting the lordís switches hands
[1:04:50] here in type we see the blessing which
[1:04:53] belonged to the firstborn the Jew was
[1:04:55] given over to the younger the Gentile
[1:04:57] through the cross the cross hands of the
[1:04:59] Lord Jesus Christ the blessing comes to
[1:05:01] the cross Galatians 3:13 and 14 said
[1:05:04] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[1:05:06] of the law being made a curse for us
[1:05:08] amen hallelujah ofertas written cursed
[1:05:12] is every one that hangs on a tree that
[1:05:14] the blessing of Abraham might come on
[1:05:16] the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that
[1:05:18] we might receive the promise of the
[1:05:19] Spirit through faith the blessing of
[1:05:21] Abraham came through the cross to the
[1:05:24] Gentiles the Jews rejected the cross
[1:05:26] therefore Jesus got the Gentile bride
[1:05:29] how important it is for us to accept the
[1:05:32] cross because it's through the cross
[1:05:33] that we are blessed Jesus was cursed
[1:05:37] that we might be blessed and it all came
[1:05:40] through the cross all these are types
[1:05:44] the brass serpent is healing forgiveness
[1:05:46] divine healing of the body and here
[1:05:48] blessing comes to the cross because
[1:05:50] Jesus was cursed for us this is a long
[1:05:53] one here remember the
[1:05:58] and Elijah it was after Elijah less left
[1:06:02] the brook of cherith and gods that I've
[1:06:04] commanded a widow woman to sustain you
[1:06:07] and brother Bantam dramatized it she
[1:06:11] dramatized is it that this widow woman
[1:06:13] her husband died fighting for Israel but
[1:06:17] now they had three and half years of no
[1:06:18] rain and she kissed her little son and
[1:06:22] knows that they're going to die soon and
[1:06:25] she goes out and begins to pray and the
[1:06:28] Bible said she hears no and the Bible
[1:06:31] said she went picked up sticks and
[1:06:33] weatherman said notice two sticks
[1:06:34] what is it the cross now anyone knows
[1:06:39] any Indian friends here any hunter the
[1:06:41] correct way of making a fire is to cross
[1:06:44] two sticks I'd never know that cuz I'm
[1:06:45] not a hunter or two logs light it right
[1:06:49] in the middle and just keep pushing the
[1:06:52] ends together that's the perfect way to
[1:06:54] keep a fire going you keep pushing it
[1:06:56] together he said it didn't last all
[1:06:59] night he said many time have I laid in
[1:07:02] the wilderness with just two sticks no
[1:07:03] bigger than that and keep them warm all
[1:07:05] night just enough to keep ward keep it
[1:07:07] right in the center of it now what's she
[1:07:10] going to do line up these sticks and the
[1:07:13] word and the spirit has brought the
[1:07:16] self-sacrifice of the Cross ready for
[1:07:18] duty ready for life putting the word in
[1:07:21] the spirit that's her faith in the Word
[1:07:22] of God by the Holy Ghost leading herself
[1:07:24] to sacrifice anything else to the cross
[1:07:26] and when she got back or when she got
[1:07:29] this thick underarm two of them she
[1:07:30] started back and there's a voice came
[1:07:32] from the gate said lady
[1:07:36] maybe an old bald-headed gray man with
[1:07:39] whiskers and the old sheepskin wrapped
[1:07:41] around and walking down the street Lord
[1:07:44] it's a certain saying Lord is it it's a
[1:07:46] certain white fence there'll be a lovely
[1:07:49] young lady she must have been young
[1:07:50] because the boy was young you told me
[1:07:53] there's a widow that was going to feed
[1:07:54] me now where she I'll keep walking
[1:07:56] the spirit leads in this way then turns
[1:07:59] him now notice God was finished feeding
[1:08:02] him through crews and now God's gonna
[1:08:05] feed him through a young woman but see
[1:08:07] the point is God's still gonna feed him
[1:08:10] and that's how it is for you and I
[1:08:12] God may provide for you one way
[1:08:14] financially this way but when that runs
[1:08:16] out God is going to find another way
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:19] or if so if something fails that
[1:08:22] something was blessing you and it failed
[1:08:25] God will find so another way to bless
[1:08:27] you praise God see God may provide
[1:08:30] through different means but he still
[1:08:32] Jehovah Jireh praise God
[1:08:35] he said so wonderful sons of God are led
[1:08:39] by the Spirit of God and all of a sudden
[1:08:41] the spirits that look to your right and
[1:08:44] then he said look to your right to your
[1:08:46] left there's someone praying who needs
[1:08:47] it and she looked back and said I just
[1:08:50] have a little bit of me left in a barrel
[1:08:52] I've got just enough oil i dampened it
[1:08:56] and I've already dressed it or I mix it
[1:08:58] I've got the word in the spirit so she
[1:09:02] had oil and flour but man said the oil
[1:09:04] is the Holy Spirit the flour was the
[1:09:06] word amen
[1:09:07] she said that's all I've got I've got a
[1:09:10] little bit of Holy Ghost and I've got a
[1:09:12] little bit of word oh my god that's all
[1:09:17] I got to live on amen so I need the
[1:09:20] cross I need the fire that comes through
[1:09:23] the cross to be able to take this oil
[1:09:26] and flour put together that I can live
[1:09:30] amen hallelujah and that's how we live
[1:09:33] today church slowly we live through the
[1:09:36] cross the fire the power of the sticks
[1:09:38] the cross plus the Holy Spirit and the
[1:09:42] Word of God it must all come together
[1:09:44] it's got a mixture of all those that we
[1:09:47] can live today in this and this our
[1:09:49] famine can the church say Amen
[1:09:51] it's a famine but the only way we live
[1:09:54] is through the cross and the word and
[1:09:57] the spirit and
[1:10:04] and the word gets together on the cross
[1:10:06] it makes a life loop for you a life of
[1:10:10] the hope anyway thank God
[1:10:14] he said I'm gonna bake it then we're
[1:10:16] gonna eat it and die now take him up
[1:10:18] we'll wait for death she said he said
[1:10:20] but you make me a little one first isn't
[1:10:22] that strange guy would ask a widow woman
[1:10:24] dying for the last bit of meal with a
[1:10:27] dying child God does things so strange
[1:10:30] make me a little one first she said you
[1:10:32] know the Bible says that we have
[1:10:33] entertained strangers we've entertained
[1:10:35] strangers there were angels not knowing
[1:10:37] what we were doing well she said I'll do
[1:10:39] it in that strange God will let some of
[1:10:45] us get so far into a struggle it seems
[1:10:47] like we barely have any strength left
[1:10:49] and then at the end of that God asks you
[1:10:51] to sacrifice a little more right you
[1:10:55] thought it was so hard before well I
[1:10:57] don't know if it could get any harder
[1:10:59] and she is tested to the very last this
[1:11:02] is her last hope she's given she's down
[1:11:08] to her last hope and God said now
[1:11:09] sacrifice that and put the word first
[1:11:12] stay ahead live for others amen manifest
[1:11:17] eternal life it looks like you have
[1:11:19] nothing left but still even if with your
[1:11:21] last hope live for somebody else and she
[1:11:27] turned and there it was the greatest
[1:11:29] consolation that any believer ever
[1:11:32] listened to he said for thus saith the
[1:11:35] Lord amen he said that's what the word
[1:11:40] she was waiting for the bell would not
[1:11:44] go empty neither will the crews go dry
[1:11:46] until the day God said rains rains set
[1:11:50] on the earth what was she waiting for
[1:11:53] she was waiting for a prophet to say
[1:11:55] thus saith the Lord amen
[1:11:57] she was waiting for a word from heaven
[1:11:59] and that's how we know we will survive
[1:12:03] in the midst of a famine because we were
[1:12:05] given thus says the denomination or thus
[1:12:07] saith the church we were given thus
[1:12:09] saith the Lord amen
[1:12:11] thus saith the Lord the last sign before
[1:12:14] the rapture was the ministry of William
[1:12:17] Pam saith the Lord so we look for no
[1:12:20] other signs because we've already
[1:12:21] received the sign first saith the Lord
[1:12:25] the mark of the beast is unionized
[1:12:27] religion the Confederacy of apostasy
[1:12:29] verse 8 the Lord every Church will take
[1:12:33] the mark of the beast will saith the
[1:12:34] Lord so we know not to join in with them
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:38] it's not safe the Lord they'll say the
[1:12:41] Lord trinitarianism is of the devil thus
[1:12:45] saith the Lord amen that's it the Lord
[1:12:49] the only true baptism is in the name of
[1:12:52] Jesus Christ oh we've got that's how we
[1:12:56] live today just like she did we
[1:12:59] sacrifice everything there any last hope
[1:13:02] we have for any natural hope we've got
[1:13:04] to sacrifice it and Trust and thus saith
[1:13:07] the Lord what do we get there so what do
[1:13:12] we learn from this woman trusting in
[1:13:13] thus saith the Lord seek ye first the
[1:13:15] kingdom of God and His righteous will be
[1:13:19] added how do you know brother Branham
[1:13:21] how do you know only thing I know put
[1:13:23] God first and move on sacrifice makes
[1:13:26] the oil makes the word and the spirit
[1:13:28] together and lay yourself upon the cross
[1:13:31] lay yourself upon the cross he says and
[1:13:35] say Here I am Lord put God first and
[1:13:37] everything so even as in your greatest
[1:13:42] trial the greatest hardship you'll have
[1:13:43] in the coming months put God first obey
[1:13:47] the word first don't compromise put God
[1:13:50] first for thus saith the Lord the crews
[1:13:54] will not run dry neither with a barrel
[1:13:56] empty into the day that the Lord God
[1:13:58] sends rain upon the earth she know then
[1:14:00] that that prophet was speaking to her
[1:14:01] oh how her heart must have jumped she
[1:14:04] ran and made that little cake and
[1:14:05] brought to him with the water trembling
[1:14:07] hand over that old sunken cheek she knew
[1:14:09] that God had come to the rescue over a
[1:14:10] little piece of bread oh you just take
[1:14:14] that one little promise of God and get
[1:14:16] everything right out of the way watch
[1:14:18] and what takes place get that heart the
[1:14:21] unbelief away from it just take that
[1:14:24] little believe that you've got and lay
[1:14:26] it on the cross and say this is all I've
[1:14:28] got Lord take it watch the turn
[1:14:31] thus saith the Lord oh he's just the
[1:14:33] same today as he ever was that's what
[1:14:35] she was waiting for maybe looks awful
[1:14:37] dark now Church but you know sometimes
[1:14:40] we're taught it's always the darkest
[1:14:42] before the day it's at the darkest hours
[1:14:45] or night when the morning star shines
[1:14:47] its reflecting the coming of the son hey
[1:14:50] man
[1:14:51] lay yourself on the cross he says so
[1:14:55] consider that you're you're the one
[1:14:57] that's got to lay there you've got to
[1:14:59] sacrifice everything you have and give
[1:15:01] it to God and trust God that if you put
[1:15:04] God first God will hear your cry he'll
[1:15:09] meet your need now oh that was all the
[1:15:14] types I had huh I thought I had more
[1:15:18] than that okay so I thought I have a few
[1:15:24] more though before I get to this one
[1:15:25] have a few more remember the cross when
[1:15:30] Moses was fine the Amalekites of the
[1:15:33] Israel they only won the battle when
[1:15:36] Moses his arms are raised a beautiful
[1:15:39] type of the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:15:42] but notice even he needed help right and
[1:15:45] look he had two helpers oh look it's
[1:15:47] Simon the Cyrenian and the angel glory I
[1:15:52] didn't think about that till just now
[1:15:54] Caleb and it wasn't Joshua it was Caleb
[1:15:57] and who was it her yeah that's right
[1:16:01] Caleb and her or Joe Joshua and her
[1:16:03] Josh Xuan her not Caleb Joshua because I
[1:16:06] always think Joshua and Caleb but it's
[1:16:08] actually
[1:16:08] Joshua and her so they whenever their
[1:16:12] arms were up they were winning whenever
[1:16:14] his arms were down and they were losing
[1:16:16] right so he needed help
[1:16:18] as long as Moses had help to keep his
[1:16:21] arms up in the shape of a cross then
[1:16:24] they would win and the fighters could
[1:16:26] look up and say we're winning now the
[1:16:28] hands are up or we're losing out because
[1:16:30] the hands are down let the hand stay up
[1:16:33] in other words keep our eyes on the
[1:16:35] cross of Jesus Christ when we realize
[1:16:38] the part of the Cross will win every
[1:16:40] battle amen
[1:16:42] right when we look to the victorious
[1:16:45] cross and all the Jesus accomplished on
[1:16:47] the cross all we gotta do is look and
[1:16:50] know the battles won just like the brass
[1:16:53] serpent amen hallelujah remember in
[1:17:01] first corinthians 10:4 the bible said
[1:17:04] they all drink from the spiritual rock
[1:17:05] that accompany them and that rock was
[1:17:07] Christ
[1:17:08] so Moses had to take the rod and he spit
[1:17:12] the crown or though the rock and the
[1:17:14] rock brought forth water which is a type
[1:17:17] of Jesus Christ when they Smit him it
[1:17:20] brought forth the holy spirit amen
[1:17:22] huh yeah and it happened twice right and
[1:17:26] believes in the second time Moses was
[1:17:28] supposed to speak to it but he struck it
[1:17:30] and we have said that was a type of this
[1:17:32] day where now he's being crucified Jesus
[1:17:36] being crucified a second time through
[1:17:39] denominations and creeds of men oh but
[1:17:41] they're still water flowing today amen
[1:17:44] today a former laterade they're still
[1:17:47] waters of life today for you and I
[1:17:50] although he's been crucified again
[1:17:52] they're still believers that will accept
[1:17:54] the water hallelujah remember the
[1:17:58] thirsty Israel came upon the oasis of
[1:18:01] Marah and the water was bitter and Moses
[1:18:04] said throwing he didn't say throwing
[1:18:06] gold
[1:18:07] glory he didn't say throw in brass he
[1:18:11] said throw in wood and when they throw
[1:18:13] the waters of the wood in the waters the
[1:18:16] Bible said the waters were made sweet
[1:18:18] and this is the type of if you throw the
[1:18:21] cross into a bitter situation it
[1:18:23] produces sweetness Oh hallelujah
[1:18:28] how many believe that Christ the cross
[1:18:30] of Christ will make you sweet when
[1:18:31] you're bitter how many ever experienced
[1:18:34] that oh it's really upset I really had a
[1:18:36] bad day
[1:18:36] I really had a bad attitude but when I
[1:18:38] got on my knees and prayed and I thought
[1:18:40] about Jesus or when I came to church I
[1:18:42] was all bent out of shape but as brother
[1:18:44] amen started singing or brother Jesse
[1:18:46] started preaching or somebody started
[1:18:47] preaching all of a sudden all my
[1:18:49] bitterness floating away
[1:18:51] and the waters became sleet all because
[1:18:54] of the cross of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:19:03] thank you Lord even even remember
[1:19:13] Balaam looked down from the mountain and
[1:19:16] he saw Israel and what shape were they
[1:19:18] in they're in the shape of a cross the
[1:19:21] Victoria they camped about in the shape
[1:19:23] of a cross a foreshadowing that God's
[1:19:26] people will be near the cross you'll
[1:19:29] have a part in that what brother have
[1:19:31] said you had a part in the cross if
[1:19:34] Jesus was the word then we had a
[1:19:36] spiritual part in him right not a
[1:19:39] physical but a spiritual right if he's
[1:19:42] the way that we in other words we are
[1:19:44] represented in the cross he paid the
[1:19:47] price for me
[1:19:48] because I'm a part of the word is that
[1:19:51] right you and I weren't on the cross we
[1:19:55] didn't die on the cross you and I didn't
[1:19:57] pay the price for sin Jesus paid the
[1:20:00] price for our sin but because the word
[1:20:02] was crucified and we were chosen in
[1:20:05] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:20:06] world that we know that he's paid our
[1:20:08] price he was thinking of us when he was
[1:20:11] on the cross amen
[1:20:13] so we have a great connection to the
[1:20:15] cross hallelujah Jonah was a type of
[1:20:22] Christ right three days the night to the
[1:20:24] belly of a whale
[1:20:25] and so his prayer in the belly of the
[1:20:31] whale was a foreshadowing of of Christ's
[1:20:34] right as a for shouting of the cross and
[1:20:39] so he cried out and he cried out to the
[1:20:41] temple he cried out to God's chosen
[1:20:44] place of worship right and Jesus cried
[1:20:47] out to God my God my God why have you
[1:20:50] forsaken me and that was so that we
[1:20:53] didn't have to be forsaken as we said
[1:20:55] earlier just like Jonah cried out to the
[1:20:58] temple so Jesus cried out to the
[1:21:00] heavenly temple and he was heard praise
[1:21:02] God he was heard
[1:21:05] Amen I'm almost through with these types
[1:21:07] here all right yeah I do believe that's
[1:21:14] it I had a list of 14 here but I've
[1:21:15] already covered those okay now let's
[1:21:18] look at a few things the Bible said that
[1:21:20] Jesus would bruise the serpentine oh
[1:21:23] Mack I like snakes I'm gonna show a
[1:21:26] little just a little bit about a serpent
[1:21:28] being crushed on the head okay so I
[1:21:30] don't mean I know won't upset you but I
[1:21:31] just want to prepare you because I know
[1:21:33] he likes to go around catch snakes and
[1:21:35] he's real good with them and he's got a
[1:21:36] pet snake but remember here the Bible
[1:21:44] says this the Bible said put enmity
[1:21:48] between thy seed and the serpent seed
[1:21:50] and your seed shall bruise the Serpent's
[1:21:52] head in other words I will overshadow a
[1:21:54] virgin someday and come down and be made
[1:21:56] flesh myself and I'll take the sinners
[1:21:59] place amen
[1:22:01] so when Jesus was prophesied to bruise
[1:22:04] the head of the serpent it was a
[1:22:07] foreshadowing that Jesus was going to
[1:22:10] take our place praise God Jesus bruising
[1:22:14] the serpent head was him taking our
[1:22:16] place you and I couldn't bruise Satan
[1:22:19] we'd lose every time right just like
[1:22:21] Adam and Eve lost
[1:22:22] they couldn't Bruce the serpent only one
[1:22:25] person could do it the seed of the woman
[1:22:27] which was Christ the lamb said this now
[1:22:33] he cannot bruise it with the law so G
[1:22:36] God couldn't used well maybe I'll use
[1:22:37] Moses to bruise the serpent Moses
[1:22:40] couldn't do it wasn't the law the tables
[1:22:42] of stone couldn't defeat Satan glory he
[1:22:45] could not bruise him with the prophets
[1:22:47] Enoch couldn't do it right Ezekiel
[1:22:50] Jeremiah couldn't bruise the serpent so
[1:22:53] he had to do it when the woman's seed
[1:22:55] became the masterpiece Christ then
[1:22:59] the seed of the woman had to be a
[1:23:02] masterpiece and this revelation just
[1:23:04] struck me last week when Michelangelo
[1:23:06] made that masterpiece did he add
[1:23:09] anything to the rock or did he just take
[1:23:11] away he just took away are you with me
[1:23:16] when he's chipping away do you think he
[1:23:19] was worried oh I lost I lost some stone
[1:23:21] you think he was worried about that no
[1:23:23] that was the whole point of it to chip
[1:23:26] away so the stone would lose the stone
[1:23:30] so that we could see the masterpiece
[1:23:32] hidden in the stone and that's what you
[1:23:35] and I missed struck me last week
[1:23:37] that's just like you and I we only
[1:23:38] become a masterpiece when God chips away
[1:23:41] at our fleshly desires amen helps us
[1:23:46] lose some of our fleshly less and after
[1:23:50] chipping away all of our desires of the
[1:23:52] flesh
[1:23:52] AHA god help us to do it tonight he's
[1:23:55] God when God can chip away when we dial
[1:23:58] to this and that the self and die of the
[1:24:01] selfishness and die with the pride when
[1:24:03] we can die out and God can chip away all
[1:24:05] these things from our life we're
[1:24:07] constantly losing our own desires when
[1:24:09] he can chip away all that then you and I
[1:24:12] will be a masterpiece like Christ amen
[1:24:17] he said let this mind be in you which
[1:24:19] was also in Christ Jesus he became a
[1:24:21] servant and church that's what God is
[1:24:23] doing to us he's chipping away our
[1:24:25] thoughts so that we can get the right
[1:24:27] attitude to always be a servant for
[1:24:29] Christ do you want to be a masterpiece
[1:24:32] for Jesus well then you got to get a lot
[1:24:36] chipped away from you we got to get a
[1:24:38] lot of selfishness chipped away from us
[1:24:40] that we can be the right masterpiece for
[1:24:42] Jesus I like that the head glory look
[1:24:46] what he said about bruising the separate
[1:24:50] this old sinful world had a block out
[1:24:52] the Sun went down in the middle of the
[1:24:54] day it had a nervous prostration the
[1:24:56] rock shook the mountains rented the dead
[1:24:57] bodies bursted from the grave what'd he
[1:24:59] do God zeroed in at Calvary he wounded
[1:25:04] that animal called Satan forever so God
[1:25:08] did this God wounded the animal Satan
[1:25:13] now he's been more vicious since then
[1:25:15] Satan because it brought light to the
[1:25:17] human race and anyone knows that a
[1:25:19] wounded animal is at its most vicious
[1:25:20] crawling around with his back broke
[1:25:23] Satan was knocked out at Calvary by the
[1:25:29] heel
[1:25:30] right so God took his heel he zeroed in
[1:25:34] he said I'm gonna do it right there he
[1:25:36] saw that serpent right there all that
[1:25:38] sin right there and God took his heel he
[1:25:40] went and he smashed that Serpent's head
[1:25:44] amen God zeroed and said I'm going to
[1:25:48] put all the sin right there an evil
[1:25:50] serpent Satan all the Dominion he has
[1:25:52] over them and I'm going to smash him
[1:25:54] right there and I'm gonna crush his head
[1:25:56] amen under there yeah and Satan got
[1:26:01] knocked out at Calvary so you imagine
[1:26:03] God knocking him out he smashes up the
[1:26:06] head and the snake just goes like that
[1:26:08] sorry Malachi but he knocked him out the
[1:26:14] earth proved that it was the greatest
[1:26:15] price that was ever paid the only one
[1:26:17] that could pay it come down and down in
[1:26:19] that Calvary that's where the great
[1:26:20] prices pay that's one of the things now
[1:26:24] I'm gonna skip down there he said
[1:26:26] Lucifer the son of the morning was
[1:26:28] walked on the earth where as burning
[1:26:30] volcanic those same rocks that had
[1:26:31] cooled off when Jesus died at Calvary
[1:26:33] belched forth out of the earth that
[1:26:35] price that was paid the bondage of Satan
[1:26:38] was broke so Satan had chains of bondage
[1:26:42] Iran or everyone at the cross and God
[1:26:47] crushed that praise God
[1:26:50] God broke our chains at the cross oh I
[1:26:59] forgot the high decision he said yet he
[1:27:01] broke the backbone of say in their
[1:27:03] Calvary the backbone of sickness and it
[1:27:06] brings every mortal being on the earth
[1:27:08] back in the Friends of God with sins
[1:27:10] forgiven our sins are forgiven no more
[1:27:12] can Satan black us off from God there's
[1:27:14] a highway made there's a telephone
[1:27:16] sitting there there's a line the glory
[1:27:18] it brings every person in reach of that
[1:27:20] line because before the cross all the
[1:27:24] saints were kept in the heart of the
[1:27:25] earth and they felt member there's a
[1:27:27] chasm they could see the sinners and
[1:27:31] they didn't really feel close to God but
[1:27:35] Jesus came and he smashed those chains
[1:27:37] he broke Satan's back he bruised his
[1:27:40] head and he pulled them out and now they
[1:27:42] were live
[1:27:43] surely in the presence of God and now we
[1:27:46] are spiritually in the presence of God
[1:27:49] hallelujah
[1:27:53] we got a line to glory thank the Lord
[1:27:58] advance another church you don't have to
[1:28:00] say I'm not worthy we all know you're
[1:28:02] not sure you're not well I I don't
[1:28:06] deserve it of course you don't I don't
[1:28:09] deserve it I'm not worthy you're not
[1:28:12] none of us are worthy he said surely not
[1:28:14] you never could be but a worthy one took
[1:28:17] your place you're free you know have to
[1:28:19] wonder anymore you don't have to be a
[1:28:20] pleasure-seeking man out here on the
[1:28:22] earth because there's a fountain filled
[1:28:24] with blood for you
[1:28:25] see that in other words don't live in
[1:28:27] guilt
[1:28:28] instead of living in guilt live in
[1:28:30] gratitude amen instead of saying I'm not
[1:28:33] worthy Otto deserve of course you don't
[1:28:36] live in gratefulness living thanks in
[1:28:39] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:28:41] will of God we should be thankful for
[1:28:42] the cross all the days of our life you
[1:28:49] don't have to be lost there's a highway
[1:28:51] in a way it's called holiness he broke
[1:28:55] the powers of Satan he opened the prison
[1:28:58] doors of hell to every man that was shut
[1:28:59] up in the earth and the Prince fearing
[1:29:01] that when he died what death would be
[1:29:02] for him on Calvary he opened those cell
[1:29:05] doors that every captive go free you
[1:29:07] have to be no longer be torn by sin you
[1:29:09] don't no longer have to yield your
[1:29:10] members to send drinking smoking
[1:29:12] gambling telling lies you can be honest
[1:29:15] I love this page this is what we can
[1:29:17] meet today we can be honest we can be
[1:29:20] just we can be upright Satan can do
[1:29:23] nothing about it because you got a hold
[1:29:25] of a line you got a hold of a life line
[1:29:27] it's anchored in the rock of ages'
[1:29:29] nothing can shake you from it no winds
[1:29:32] can shake you from it no nothing not
[1:29:33] even death because the love of God
[1:29:35] that's in Christ Jesus so just whatever
[1:29:39] we struggle with we don't have to
[1:29:41] struggle with it right we can get
[1:29:44] freedom because Jesus broke the chains
[1:29:46] he broke the bondage Satan doesn't
[1:29:49] having dominion over us because we're
[1:29:51] free Jesus paid the price
[1:29:57] all right let me get a few of these
[1:29:59] things here I got these on here let's
[1:30:02] take our Bibles again let's remember
[1:30:03] what God did let's go to Colossians 2:15
[1:30:19] Colossians 2:15 let's rehearse some of
[1:30:23] these by the grace of God I'll try to
[1:30:25] finish here almost been an hour my
[1:30:30] questions 2:15 since this is why it's
[1:30:39] called Good Friday right this part right
[1:30:42] here wasn't good for Jesus right but it
[1:30:44] was good for us amen that's why we call
[1:30:47] it Good Friday now let's go up to verse
[1:30:52] can't skip this verse 13 Colossians 2:13
[1:30:55] and you being dead in your sins and the
[1:30:57] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[1:30:59] quickened together with him for giving
[1:31:01] you all trespasses listen church if
[1:31:03] you're hanging on to anything from your
[1:31:05] past let it go let it go in the
[1:31:06] scripture he's forgiven you all your
[1:31:11] trespasses praise the Lord don't let if
[1:31:16] st. remind you some from the past just
[1:31:18] say God forgive me Lord if I haven't
[1:31:20] fully repented I'm sorry
[1:31:21] I never would have to answer for that I
[1:31:24] want to be forgiven I'm trust your blood
[1:31:26] has forgiven me for all my
[1:31:27] transgressions
[1:31:30] verse 14 blotting out the handwriting of
[1:31:33] Ordinances that was against us which was
[1:31:35] contrary to us and took it out of the
[1:31:38] way nailing it to his cross amen so all
[1:31:42] those mistakes we made it was nailed to
[1:31:44] the cross of Christ paid for and having
[1:31:47] spoiled principalities and powers he
[1:31:49] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:31:51] over them in it how did he spoil the
[1:31:56] powers of hell because he took the keys
[1:31:58] to death in hell hey that's how he
[1:32:02] spoiled them praise God he took their
[1:32:05] keys
[1:32:06] I remember them said Jesus didn't have
[1:32:08] the keys to the king
[1:32:09] gave that the Peter but Jesus had the
[1:32:12] keys to death in hell haha amen he gave
[1:32:16] him the keys to the kingdom to Peter but
[1:32:18] he said I'm gonna go get the keys of
[1:32:19] death in hell and when he raised from
[1:32:22] the dead he had those keys he was
[1:32:24] swinging those keys and all those Saints
[1:32:26] that were resurrected he spoiled all
[1:32:28] those principalities and he's proved to
[1:32:30] them that I'm in control deaths not in
[1:32:33] control I have power over death amen
[1:32:37] beautiful thank you lord
[1:32:42] Hebrews 2:14 and 15 I've tried to preach
[1:32:46] these every year so you remember and I
[1:32:48] remember what Christ did through the
[1:32:50] cross always trying to find a place to
[1:32:53] put these in here we ought to be so
[1:32:59] happy tonight praise God we ought to be
[1:33:03] Hebrews 2:14 and 15 first much soon as
[1:33:06] the children are partakers of flesh and
[1:33:08] blood he also himself likewise took part
[1:33:11] of the same that through death he might
[1:33:12] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:33:14] that is to say the devil to see the
[1:33:17] bruised head was Satan was Jesus
[1:33:20] destroying death the power of death and
[1:33:23] I remember when I preached on fear and
[1:33:25] brother him said the greatest fear of
[1:33:27] humanity is death now recent polls say
[1:33:32] public speaking is the biggest fear now
[1:33:33] but I think in all reality I think if
[1:33:36] people were near death I think if you
[1:33:38] ask older people I think the biggest
[1:33:39] fear would still be death don't you they
[1:33:42] probably asked young people they never
[1:33:43] think about death but yes old people
[1:33:45] it's probably death dying what's gonna
[1:33:48] happen when I die is everything in order
[1:33:49] when I die
[1:33:51] verse 15 here it is and deliver them who
[1:33:56] through fear of death were all their
[1:33:58] life subject to bondage see they they
[1:34:02] felt like they were and they were slaves
[1:34:05] to death right that's what Solomon said
[1:34:08] that's what Ecclesiastes was all about
[1:34:09] right he said I work and work in toil
[1:34:12] what is it just vanity he said I'm gonna
[1:34:14] build this kingdom I'm gonna dine I'm
[1:34:16] gonna give it to my sons and who knows
[1:34:17] that my sons are gonna be faithful with
[1:34:19] it he had all these sadness he was so
[1:34:22] discouraged he was
[1:34:23] depressed about death but in the New
[1:34:27] Testament when we know Jesus took his
[1:34:29] heel and crushed the powers of death now
[1:34:32] Paul can say Oh grave where is your
[1:34:34] sting
[1:34:35] Oh death where is your victory amen oh
[1:34:38] yeah
[1:34:40] and now Paul doesn't fear death where
[1:34:43] Solomon and Joel they all fear death
[1:34:45] now Solomon to earn parlors in fear
[1:34:48] because he knows Jesus conquered death
[1:34:50] amen and parted out the wonder if she's
[1:34:53] alive Jesus met him himself Jesus came
[1:34:57] and made sure the man is going to write
[1:34:59] the New Testament I'm gonna meet him
[1:35:00] myself a resurrected living Christ to
[1:35:03] show that I've conquered death hell and
[1:35:06] the grave and that way when Paul was
[1:35:10] walking to get his head chopped off as a
[1:35:12] martyr and program said that bee was
[1:35:14] flying around him Paul could say oh
[1:35:16] you've got no stinger you've lost your
[1:35:19] stinger there's no such thing as you've
[1:35:22] got no victory because God has given us
[1:35:25] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[1:35:26] Christ
[1:35:31] so God destroyed God zeroed in and he
[1:35:34] took his heel and he smashed the powers
[1:35:36] of death but death has no more victory
[1:35:40] over us hallelujah
[1:35:45] now let's look at that picture here now
[1:35:48] bo-ram says it's also well known if the
[1:35:51] predicted bruising of the Serpent's head
[1:35:53] was in actuality a prophecy concerning
[1:35:55] what Christ would accomplish against
[1:35:57] Satan at the cross so what would he
[1:36:00] accomplished Church if you know a
[1:36:02] venomous snake their venom gland is
[1:36:06] right there in their head right and then
[1:36:09] it flows down this duct and it's
[1:36:11] released out through the fangs he's
[1:36:13] released out through the Fang so if you
[1:36:16] bruise a Serpent's head you've cut off
[1:36:18] the poison then it combines like one
[1:36:22] time I got bit by a gardener snake
[1:36:24] through a glove and it was really hard
[1:36:26] to rip it off the glove and I think I
[1:36:28] killed the snake I didn't mean to poor
[1:36:30] little fella and Bush he sure was
[1:36:33] aggressive though but they
[1:36:36] is what the pictures Jesus is going to
[1:36:38] bruise the head so the poison of death
[1:36:41] the sting of death this thing of the
[1:36:44] grave would be cut off so now there's no
[1:36:48] if you see a gardener snake now you
[1:36:50] might be scared but you're not life and
[1:36:52] death scared you just know that's just a
[1:36:55] little gardener snake right and you
[1:36:58] probably know a snake that's got a
[1:36:59] triangle head those are the most
[1:37:00] poisonous right the more so when you see
[1:37:03] a little gardener Hakes
[1:37:04] and gardener snake head it's just like
[1:37:06] you're not scared of that because that's
[1:37:08] not poisonous and usually the more
[1:37:10] colorful there are the more poisonous
[1:37:11] they are but see st. was the most
[1:37:14] poisonous snake ever and God zeroed in
[1:37:18] God saw him slithering around Jesus and
[1:37:21] the member sure Satan didn't know what
[1:37:24] death would do to Jesus but the brand
[1:37:28] said when Jesus got down to hell Satan's
[1:37:30] that I thought I had you enable he said
[1:37:33] I thought I had you in Moses that I
[1:37:35] thought I had you in Ezekiel and
[1:37:37] Jeremiah he said I was for sure I had
[1:37:39] you in John the Baptist seed st. really
[1:37:41] didn't quite understand it all but gee
[1:37:44] but Satan said now I've got you now and
[1:37:46] brother and said Jesus gave him a swift
[1:37:47] kick Jesus gave him a swift kick and
[1:37:50] took the keys of death and hell and they
[1:37:52] slammed the door and said he said come
[1:37:54] with me let's take this make a
[1:37:56] whistle-stop in Jerusalem I'm going to
[1:37:58] prove that I've spoiled all the powers
[1:38:01] of death and hell and I got the keys
[1:38:03] amen see Satan thought he had him he
[1:38:07] thought he's going to kill the Messiah
[1:38:08] and enable he thought he thought Moses
[1:38:11] was the Messiah Joshua he thought all
[1:38:13] these people were the Messiah and then
[1:38:15] when he killed Jesus he didn't
[1:38:16] understand what he was doing he was
[1:38:18] actually saving God's people free amen
[1:38:21] hey God zeroed in there and he smashed
[1:38:24] with his heel and now the Serpent's head
[1:38:26] is bruised and now death cannot conquer
[1:38:28] because Jesus has the keys of death
[1:38:33] hallelujah let me find it
[1:38:39] the closer now do you remember that day
[1:38:46] on Calvary better have said did three
[1:38:48] things I forget the second I remember I
[1:38:52] remember the the first and the third the
[1:38:56] first thing is that it's settled the sin
[1:38:58] question I was looking at my notes today
[1:39:00] I remember the second Calvary cell the
[1:39:02] sin question you and I no longer have to
[1:39:05] answer for our sins because we recognize
[1:39:07] God's sacrifice took our place right and
[1:39:10] we're forgiven all of our trans
[1:39:12] trespasses and the third thing it did
[1:39:16] brother Graham said was it the Calvary
[1:39:19] motivates us to do the greater works so
[1:39:23] let's look at the greater works just for
[1:39:24] a moment here now I'll skip ahead
[1:39:27] there's a lot of reading here perhaps
[1:39:30] Jesus at the works that I do shall you
[1:39:31] do also and greater works shall you do
[1:39:34] because I go to my father here in this
[1:39:40] church here's the greater how many one
[1:39:41] do the greater works if people have
[1:39:45] received the Holy Ghost in our church
[1:39:46] then we've done the greater works amen
[1:39:51] now notice the greater works was that
[1:39:54] power of the church not only to heal the
[1:39:56] sick by prayer which were thankful when
[1:39:57] God does that now only to cast out
[1:39:59] Devils by prayer but to impart eternal
[1:40:02] life to believers the Holy Ghost was
[1:40:05] coming and giving the hands of the
[1:40:07] church to impart life oh that's what
[1:40:09] Calvary meant today huh
[1:40:13] so not only are sins forgiven but now we
[1:40:17] can do the greater works and the greater
[1:40:19] works are imparting and praying for
[1:40:22] people to receive the baptism of the
[1:40:23] Holy Ghost aren't you glad Church oh my
[1:40:26] goodness
[1:40:27] hallelujah that's beautiful
[1:40:38] he said what does he turn a life the
[1:40:39] life that he lived the life that was in
[1:40:41] him and part that to others can a man do
[1:40:42] that a son of God can Jesus said
[1:40:45] whosoever sinned you admit to them they
[1:40:46] were admitted whosoever seems you
[1:40:47] retained to them they are retained all
[1:40:52] right let me uh I'm going to close in
[1:40:58] just a minute let me get a couple more
[1:40:59] things so the last few things I want to
[1:41:03] say on the cross Jesus destroyed the
[1:41:07] power of death do we still see death
[1:41:09] though sure yeah people die all the time
[1:41:13] and if God Darius we're all gonna die
[1:41:15] right so he destroyed the power of death
[1:41:20] he took the poison out of that serpent
[1:41:22] right he crushed the head of that
[1:41:25] serpent and now death can't hold us in
[1:41:30] the heart of the earth
[1:41:32] remember what brother Branham said he
[1:41:34] said that's the reason the Witch of
[1:41:35] Endor could call up Samuel because there
[1:41:38] was no blood to protect them they were
[1:41:39] just in the heart of the earth so Satan
[1:41:41] could have access to Souls and he could
[1:41:44] just he had the Piatt jury as he has
[1:41:45] great power but after Calvary Jesus that
[1:41:49] I haven't taken them back and Satan
[1:41:51] won't ever touch him again and he led
[1:41:54] captivity captive amen and now how Satan
[1:41:57] can't get them because every time he
[1:41:59] tries to come to heaven together Jesus
[1:42:01] said where's their sin I don't see their
[1:42:03] sin it's already paid for amen
[1:42:05] hallelujah thank the Lord but death is
[1:42:10] still here death has been though
[1:42:13] disarmed right death has lost its power
[1:42:17] death has lost its victory praise God
[1:42:20] and you and I know that the last enemy
[1:42:25] that will be destroyed as what death
[1:42:29] remember that revelation the last thing
[1:42:32] that destroyed is death because as soon
[1:42:34] as death is destroyed then everybody
[1:42:36] that's left after the Millenium is gonna
[1:42:38] live for eternity hey hey remember all
[1:42:42] those people in the Millenium they're
[1:42:44] all going to that all the ones that get
[1:42:46] to see by Satan are gonna have to come
[1:42:47] up to the surround Jerusalem but the the
[1:42:50] Jerusalem Temple and Bieber
[1:42:51] by fire and then the white throne
[1:42:54] judgment where the the sheep are saved
[1:42:56] and then the goats are casting like a
[1:42:58] fire and the last one that's destroyed
[1:43:01] is death God takes this wounded snake
[1:43:04] it's got a bruised head no more poison
[1:43:06] God and he's still around there he still
[1:43:09] he still does a little bit right but
[1:43:11] he's wounded and God finally takes that
[1:43:13] snake and he throws him into the fire
[1:43:15] and that's the last enemy that's
[1:43:17] destroyed and normal enemies praise God
[1:43:20] no more snakes through the route no more
[1:43:23] people dying from here on out it's all
[1:43:25] life it's all eternal life no more death
[1:43:28] the last enemy's been destroyed no more
[1:43:31] serpents no more tears no more sadness
[1:43:33] it's all joy and glory and Holy Ghost
[1:43:36] life amen
[1:43:39] yeah thank God and who we fight now were
[1:43:44] fighting that same snake now except that
[1:43:46] snake is on a pale horse right now right
[1:43:50] and he changes appearance now I don't
[1:43:53] look like a snake he looks like a horse
[1:43:55] rider the last horse rider what's his
[1:43:59] name we don't know his name for the
[1:44:01] first three rides on that last ride that
[1:44:03] Eagle anointing calls him out he's death
[1:44:06] brother random the prophetic ministry
[1:44:09] he's death
[1:44:10] that's the Antichrist spirit Satan but
[1:44:17] the Bible's
[1:44:18] the rapture we get we get our victory
[1:44:20] over death because the Bible said death
[1:44:22] will be swallowed up in life oh thank
[1:44:26] God for that aren't you glad Church that
[1:44:31] you and I get the victory over that pair
[1:44:32] of horse rider just like think about it
[1:44:36] eagle how easily can an eagle Brant or
[1:44:38] put their in a tree if a horse rider
[1:44:40] comes by how easy is it for an eagle to
[1:44:43] fly on the out of the way
[1:44:44] all you gotta do is flap his wings cause
[1:44:47] the others put to work these powerful
[1:44:49] wings that he has and then he catches
[1:44:52] the air and he flies up that's that's
[1:44:54] the type of the rapture praise God when
[1:44:57] we go in the rapture that's all we got
[1:44:59] to do spread our faith in the Old
[1:45:00] Testament New Testament and fly out of
[1:45:03] here because we'll get victory we'll
[1:45:05] defeat death we'll fly up in the rapture
[1:45:08] and when victory over death because
[1:45:10] that's God's plan for his Eagles thank
[1:45:14] the Lord out of the area we batter him
[1:45:18] we see him but one day for the rapture
[1:45:20] will get death will be swallowed up and
[1:45:23] we'll have victory over him and we'll
[1:45:25] fly away up to heaven let's stand to our
[1:45:28] feet
[1:45:28] let's close to this quote I gots got one
[1:45:29] more quote I hope it's been a help to
[1:45:37] you tonight by God's grace Pope would
[1:45:39] spend a good reminder of the power of
[1:45:41] Christ the power of the cross by the
[1:45:44] cross is so powerful it can take a
[1:45:45] murderer who's mocking Jesus in a few
[1:45:48] moments
[1:45:49] make him tender-hearted make him repent
[1:45:53] make him say sorry remember me remember
[1:45:56] me on the day of judgment I don't want
[1:45:58] to go to hell there's nothing wrong with
[1:46:00] Jesus Christ he's perfect he's holy or
[1:46:02] if they can do that to him how about us
[1:46:04] tonight
[1:46:04] praise God those of us who already saved
[1:46:07] already filled with His Holy Spirit how
[1:46:09] it should make us have the right
[1:46:10] attitude tonight if we got the wrong
[1:46:13] attitude if we done anything wrong
[1:46:16] how it should make us understand the
[1:46:19] cross of Christ
[1:46:22] the last thing
[1:46:24] Krauss does I just wanted to close to
[1:46:25] this there's just three little slides
[1:46:26] the last thing the cross does is make us
[1:46:28] humble right buh-bam says this tell me
[1:46:33] any man any woman can come to Calvary
[1:46:36] and try to be a big somebody because
[1:46:38] somebody said something tell me where
[1:46:43] you can look in the face of Calvary he
[1:46:46] said it's right light that day in
[1:46:48] Calvary he says have you had your day on
[1:46:51] Calvary and come out of a stuffed shirt
[1:46:52] how can you come out a puppet for some
[1:46:55] organization and preach some man-made
[1:46:56] doctrine
[1:46:57] why don't humble you to the Word of God
[1:47:00] I said why don't it humble you to the
[1:47:01] Word of God if you ever go there you'll
[1:47:04] come out humble it's like for me
[1:47:08] preaching on a good Friday night this
[1:47:10] doesn't make me feel prideful and look
[1:47:12] how it look what a great preacher look
[1:47:13] how faithful this makes me humble right
[1:47:16] coming to church on Good Friday
[1:47:18] should make us all humble it doesn't
[1:47:21] make us a stuffed shirt look what we did
[1:47:22] because church we didn't need nothing
[1:47:24] all we did was look and live a may
[1:47:27] Christ did all the work amen Christ did
[1:47:31] everything and all we got to do is stop
[1:47:33] looking at our sin problem and look to
[1:47:35] our forgiveness solution amen
[1:47:38] we just got to look to this the solution
[1:47:41] to our problem
[1:47:44] how can you want to be some big
[1:47:46] something in your organization with a
[1:47:48] feather in your hat when Jesus Christ
[1:47:50] son of God humbled himself to a
[1:47:51] hacked-up body to a spinet face until
[1:47:53] shame and disgrace and they stripped his
[1:47:55] clothes off and crucified him before the
[1:47:57] world despising the shame how can you in
[1:47:59] a countering come away anything
[1:48:00] different than when he was a disgrace in
[1:48:03] a shame
[1:48:05] it's the last quote brothers we can come

[1:48:11] say they'll kick me out let them kick
[1:48:14] have your dad Calvary God will have his
[1:48:17] way with you let me quote that again

[1:48:27] the songs there honey want God to have
[1:48:29] his way your life amen

[1:48:38] look what a great job I've done we
[1:48:40] haven't done anything I haven't done one
[1:48:42] thing all I've tried to do is remind you
[1:48:47] and remind myself of what Jesus Christ
[1:48:49] already did for us what he did he sent
[1:48:57] us free he's the one that conquered
[1:49:02] death he's the one that destroys the
[1:49:04] works of the devil
