[18:33] blood of Jesus Oh precious is so close
[18:39] God makes me white as snow No
[18:47] [Applause]
[18:49] [Music]
[18:54] hallelujah amen thank you Lord for this
[18:57] well I live here
[19:00] glory to God amen amen I'm how many's a
[19:06] little bit warm in here okay all right
[19:09] I thought maybe cuz I wore my long johns
[19:13] or something I'm I'm kind of sensitive
[19:15] to the cold even having grown up in
[19:18] Wisconsin I I like to be warm and all
[19:22] that too so all right let's try that
[19:28] course or song I worship thee Almighty
[19:31] God there is none like
[19:37] [Music]
[19:53] [Music]
[20:07] [Music]
[20:14] for you are my righteousness
[20:21] [Music]
[20:36] [Music]
[21:07] [Music]
[21:14] [Music]
[21:28] [Music]
[21:31] let's try that course - there is none
[21:34] like you no one else can touch my heart
[21:36] like you do I get key down there brother
[21:41] for me there is not like you
[21:52] no one else and touched my heart like
[21:57] [Music]
[22:04] [Music]
[22:12] there is not for you are my
[23:13] righteousness ship you all my
[23:27] [Music]
[23:31] there is no there is not and there is
[23:55] not like a meant let's just raise our
[24:01] hands and worship Him this morning just
[24:04] tell him Lord there's none like him he's
[24:07] above all he's greater than all how much
[24:10] he means to us thank you
[24:12] we think like the the writer in the Book
[24:25] of Psalms said it is good to praise the
[24:28] Lord and it is good to sing unto how
[24:31] many men it truly is good I think of
[24:34] another song I don't even know how to
[24:36] sing it but it was some it's a southern
[24:38] gospel song it goes something like he is
[24:40] to me my comfort he is to me my joy he
[24:44] is to me all these different things he
[24:45] is to me you know there's just so many
[24:48] so many thinks he is to us believers
[24:51] Amen let's try one in a line of the
[24:54] season here I will come let us adore him
[24:57] this is actually a good song year-round
[24:59] musty socks are but I'm hoping I'm
[25:03] hoping it comes right up here but I
[25:06] think I can get it started
[25:11] we can let's try that first verse there
[25:16] go come with us I'm sorry o come all ye
[25:21] faithful right I'm sorry about that
[25:28] [Music]
[25:33] Oh
[25:42] Oh
[25:44] [Music]
[25:51] [Music]
[26:04] [Applause]
[26:12] [Music]
[26:30] [Music]
[26:36] [Applause]
[26:41] [Music]
[26:44] [Applause]
[26:47] [Music]
[27:04] [Music]
[27:07] [Applause]
[27:09] [Music]
[27:15] [Music]
[27:17] lord
[27:21] [Music]
[27:23] [Applause]
[27:27] [Music]
[27:37] [Music]
[27:41] [Applause]
[27:47] [Music]
[28:02] oh hey man you may have your seats as my
[28:40] wife and girls come with their son
[29:11] [Music]
[29:31] [Applause]
[29:33] [Music]
[30:04] [Applause]
[30:08] [Music]
[30:20] [Music]
[31:35] [Music]
[31:54] [Music]
[32:04] [Applause]
[32:16] let's stand and we'll sing one more song
[32:19] so we're changing the order of the
[32:21] service one thing brother Jesse and I
[32:26] did not discuss was a collection or an
[32:29] offering doesn't seem to be a big
[32:31] priority and a lot of I'm gonna call it
[32:35] Full Gospel believers churches you know
[32:38] but I'm sure if you need to give there's
[32:43] a brother here that wants to help with
[32:44] that you're welcome to coming up and
[32:46] tell me what we need to do or if there's
[32:48] a box out there I'm sure you're aware of
[32:50] it so we know giving is part of worship
[32:55] thank you brother it was getting ready
[32:57] to ask for that now let's sing that song
[33:02] i'd i think the title of it is my open
[33:05] heart or i will give
[33:08] to use the first verse brother Soriano
[33:12] from the Philippines wrote that one in
[33:13] brother Jesse adopted it for
[33:15] congregational use and I heard him sing
[33:18] it here when we were here a few years
[33:19] back so do you still sing that one do
[33:22] you yeah we're not sure we're not sure
[33:26] okay
[33:28] hmm well I gave brother Jesse a list and
[33:33] he approved it so I know he knows the
[33:36] song he knows it I'm gonna have to talk
[33:41] to him about that
[33:43] that's a good song - it's a really good
[33:46] song and I thought it was a really good
[33:48] idea to sing it congregation was the
[33:50] only person I ever heard do that but I
[33:53] guess we'll have to work on that some of
[33:56] the tongue let's just sing my old
[33:57] standby then thank you Lord for saving
[33:59] my soul thank you for saving my soul
[34:48] [Music]
[34:58] thank you for giving to great salvation
[35:11] so rich and free you know let's bow our
[35:19] heads and our hearts as we prepare to go
[35:21] into the word Lord we thank you for this
[35:22] time together we thank you for you
[35:24] traveling mercies we thank you for the
[35:27] prayer and prayer requests and songs and
[35:30] the special and just all the licks of
[35:34] fire that have come together here this
[35:35] morning to give you praise for your work
[35:38] as we approach this next stage of the
[35:42] service load we just ask you to its
[35:45] divided with us and help us to maintain
[35:48] our concentration and their minds not to
[35:51] be pulled out for the directions but may
[35:54] that atmosphere that's been set by the
[35:56] worship just help us to help the seed to
[35:58] be sowed in fertile ground and may we go
[36:01] forth from here and bring forth much
[36:03] fruit for thee in Jesus name we pray
[36:05] amen amen
[36:09] well you're standing we can turn
[36:12] together to our text which is Isaiah
[36:17] chapter 33 and verse 6 and that reads
[36:30] and wisdom and knowledge shall be the
[36:36] stability of that times and strength of
[36:40] salvation the fear of the Lord is his
[36:43] treasure amen you may be seated
[36:52] and if you could just turn this screen
[36:54] on brother I've got the slide ready
[36:57] there's is just a title slide for this
[37:00] message this little message titled true
[37:05] gold Lord kind of blessed me with some
[37:12] years ago 2015-2016 and I've been
[37:16] preaching it everywhere I go which isn't
[37:18] too many places but it's been to
[37:21] Virginia and a couple other up into
[37:25] Canada actually we were working there
[37:28] with helping a little group there for a
[37:32] little bit there but the word gold is in
[37:36] the Bible 419 times so it's a very
[37:40] biblical topic and as we know there's
[37:46] real gold and then there's something we
[37:50] commonly call fool's gold I'm just gonna
[37:53] flip over here okay
[37:58] and this here on the screen is the
[38:02] Mojave nugget which is California's
[38:06] largest gold nugget that's real gold 156
[38:11] ounces in just under ten pounds so it'd
[38:16] be a nice chunk of gold to have if you
[38:18] had your hands on it knowing the
[38:21] approximate value of gold we'll talk
[38:23] about that later but we all know gold is
[38:25] very valuable and then you all may you
[38:30] may not know but fool's gold is not very
[38:34] valuable and in the next slide we're
[38:37] going to look at a piece of that which I
[38:39] think is in a museum somewhere and
[38:41] fool's gold is commonly known as iron
[38:44] pyrite or pyrite so for purp
[38:50] says of this morning I'm going to be
[38:51] calling it pyrite a lot and probably
[38:55] fool's gold interchange a little bit but
[38:57] it's all the same thing and we'll get
[39:01] into that a little more as we go on in
[39:04] our pictures the false gold or the
[39:10] fool's gold actually looks better than
[39:14] the real if you look at this beautiful
[39:20] squared off crystals on the fool's gold
[39:24] and this lumpy Miss shapen real gold you
[39:29] look at you think which one would you
[39:30] rather have well if you didn't know the
[39:33] difference you might rather have the one
[39:36] that looked better natural gold tends to
[39:42] be irregularly shaped and iron pyrite
[39:46] comes as either cubes or multi faceted
[39:49] crystals so this is not just a one
[39:51] unusual example but is typically how
[39:54] they appear and this is a good type of
[39:59] real life for many times what looks good
[40:02] to us is not so good think of Hebrews 11
[40:10] 24 through 26 by faith Moses chose
[40:14] rather to suffer affliction with the
[40:16] people of God and rejected the riches
[40:21] and power of Egypt and fool's gold is
[40:26] actually a mineral called iron pyrite
[40:29] and it is distinguishable from gold by
[40:33] its hardness brittleness and crystal
[40:38] form so we're going to start talking
[40:40] about the characteristics of fool's gold
[40:42] or iron pyrite it is unstable in the
[40:47] natural environment in nature it is
[40:50] always being created or being destroyed
[40:52] iron pyrite exposed to air and water
[40:57] decomposes into iron oxides and sulfate
[41:02] now I had to go on and read the
[41:05] encyclopedia so to speak or Wikipedia as
[41:07] we call it today to learn all this stuff
[41:10] because I didn't know this either but
[41:13] when they're mining and digging through
[41:16] the earth these reactions occur more
[41:20] rapidly because the pyrite as they're
[41:24] digging through and blasting through
[41:26] going underground it comes it gets into
[41:30] the air in fine crystals and dust this
[41:36] reactions take place more quickly when
[41:38] it's in little bitty pieces like that
[41:40] and this instability means that iron
[41:44] pyrite gives off energy which can cause
[41:48] mining shafts to collapse or dust
[41:53] explosions in mining shafts now we
[41:56] probably all heard about explosions in
[41:58] mines collapses miners being trapped
[42:01] underground and we've probably heard the
[42:05] term of sealing off in mind now a big
[42:10] part of the reason they do that is
[42:11] because they're trying to keep this
[42:13] pyrite in that mine from reacting with
[42:17] air so if they seal it off it's secure
[42:23] or safe because the air can't get in
[42:26] there and cause explosions and collapses
[42:31] and things like that all because of the
[42:36] reactivity of pyrite or fool's gold now
[42:41] there are other kind of pyrites
[42:43] but iron pyrite is one of the most
[42:45] common types of pyrite sand pyrites by
[42:48] the way which we're going to get you
[42:49] later are the most common type of
[42:51] minerals now this iron pyrite also gives
[42:56] off an acid in its reactivity and this
[43:00] acid can cause polluted streams
[43:04] something like acid rain but they call
[43:07] it acid mine runoff
[43:11] so it's really a damaging product I
[43:15] would say product but it's not a product
[43:17] it's a element or something in creation
[43:22] the instability of iron pyrite also
[43:26] causes problems with building materials
[43:30] buildings stone containing pyrite tends
[43:33] to stain Brown as the pyrite oxidizes
[43:37] now what oxidizes means is simply reacts
[43:40] with oxygen we call that rust
[43:44] how many have cars out there vans or
[43:47] trucks I'm going to know what rust is
[43:51] hopefully if you're looking at yours
[43:54] you're not seeing too much rust because
[43:56] it just eats your vehicle away doesn't
[43:59] it you know that's what oxidation is so
[44:04] in this case you're building a building
[44:05] you got a beautiful white columns of
[44:08] stone you know on the outside of your
[44:10] building and the next thing you know
[44:11] this Brown is running down the front of
[44:16] your building and it came from within
[44:18] the stone how do you fix it you know the
[44:23] presence of pyrite in the aggregate used
[44:26] to make concrete can lead to severe
[44:30] deterioration as the pyrite oxidizes
[44:33] there's a lot of big words in there but
[44:36] again concrete we're all familiar with
[44:38] concrete can I get a show of hands
[44:41] someone that's familiar with concrete
[44:43] all right good young children concrete
[44:47] is a building material and we use it
[44:50] typically for foundations and floors
[44:52] although in many countries they use it
[44:54] for walls and ceilings as well and
[44:58] concrete is formed from aggregate which
[45:03] is basically the word aggregate means
[45:06] things put together kind of like cooking
[45:09] pancakes
[45:10] that would be an aggregate of ax sorts
[45:14] but so you put a little gravel in you
[45:18] put a little sand in you put a little
[45:19] water in you mix it all up and then you
[45:22] pour it out in your form or out on your
[45:25] floor and once the water dissolves or
[45:29] evaporates out of the concrete it
[45:31] hardens up and becomes this really nice
[45:33] solid strong foundation so but somewhere
[45:38] into that mix got a little bit of this
[45:41] iron pyrite Fool's Gold and now because
[45:46] there's pyrite in there the concrete is
[45:50] severely deteriorated in other words
[45:53] it's crumbling the foundation on your
[45:56] house is crumbling maybe your house
[45:59] begins to tilt a little bit because it
[46:02] was a little bit this iron pyrite so
[46:04] we're finding out that gold is valuable
[46:07] and iron pyrite is almost detrimental
[46:12] it's it's problem causing even though it
[46:16] looks good in the early 2009 problems
[46:22] with Chinese drywall imported into the
[46:24] United States after Hurricane Katrina
[46:26] were attributed to oxidation of pyrite
[46:30] so once again pyrite was found to cause
[46:33] trouble with drywall that had got into
[46:36] in the United States in Canada and more
[46:39] recently in Ireland where it was used as
[46:42] underfloor infill that's like floors and
[46:46] basements and stuff like that
[46:47] pyrite contamination has caused major
[46:51] structural damage modern tests for
[46:56] aggregate materials certify such
[46:59] materials as free of pyrite so there
[47:03] they're trying to make sure this doesn't
[47:05] get into the concrete now now on the
[47:10] other hand iron pyrite does have several
[47:13] uses
[47:15] the main use of iron pirate is for the
[47:19] production of sulfur dioxide and
[47:23] sulfuric acid which is a highly
[47:26] corrosive substance in other words one
[47:31] of the most useful things of pyrite is
[47:33] to create an acid which can burn or
[47:37] destroy a person so it continues
[47:42] exhibiting a very destructive nature now
[47:46] I know sulfuric acid has some uses and
[47:49] industry and things like that but it's
[47:53] not a real pleasant substance pyrite can
[47:57] also be used to start fires by striking
[48:01] it against steel so the reactivity of
[48:05] pyrite just can cause all kinds of
[48:08] problems
[48:09] Fyers acid acid runoff in streams
[48:14] explosions can ruin concrete ruin
[48:18] drywall and ruin other building
[48:21] materials now we we mentioned earlier
[48:25] that iron pyrite is a very common
[48:29] substance oh I'm sorry that's the I
[48:33] don't think we're on that slide yet it
[48:37] is the most common of the sulfide
[48:38] minerals which are about 25 different
[48:41] minerals now almost everything pyrite
[48:53] isn't gold is in contrast real gold is
[49:02] valued for several characteristics this
[49:04] metal has we'll start out with
[49:08] malleability and ductility this
[49:14] allows metal atoms to slide past one
[49:17] another without being subjected to
[49:20] strong repulsive forces that would cause
[49:24] other materials to shatter to be plane
[49:29] this allows gold to be hammered to a
[49:34] very thin layer called gold leaf I have
[49:40] a nice little picture here on this and
[49:44] if you look on this screen this tiny
[49:47] piece of gold at the bottom of this
[49:50] picture is five millimeters that's about
[49:54] something on this order if I'm right I'm
[49:58] not up on my metric system entirely but
[50:00] very small piece of gold and that can be
[50:04] hammered or worked to a sheet of about
[50:10] half a meter which is approximately this
[50:14] big and then to put it in our American
[50:19] measurements an ounce can be worked into
[50:25] three hundred square feet which is about
[50:29] 30 by 10 feet maybe the length of this
[50:32] room and this big so one little ounce of
[50:36] gold can be hammered into that big of a
[50:38] sheet now you think about you know you
[50:42] look at these where they call it the
[50:45] Dome of the rock I think it's over in
[50:47] the east Istanbul or Israel or somewhere
[50:54] over there I didn't have that in my
[50:57] notes but you look at the Dome of the
[50:58] rock that great big huge dome covered
[51:01] with gold you look at the state capitals
[51:05] federal buildings things like that I
[51:07] know Wisconsin where I'm originally from
[51:09] State Capitol had some gold up there you
[51:13] know and
[51:14] and the way they put all that gold it's
[51:17] very heavy and it's very expensive the
[51:20] way they cover things like that with
[51:21] gold they it's not solid gold you're
[51:24] looking at but they hammer out this gold
[51:27] leaf and then they cover it over with
[51:30] gold leaf very common I believe even the
[51:35] Ark of the Covenant was instructed it
[51:38] was built of wood and then it was
[51:40] covered overlaid with gold which would
[51:42] have been gold leaf
[51:44] so that workability I'm gonna use the
[51:48] word workability they say malleability
[51:50] ductility we're gonna use the word
[51:53] workability here of gold makes it very
[51:57] valuable it's the most workable of all
[52:02] substances ok gold is also one of the
[52:09] least reactive chemical elements
[52:13] chemical elements is basically the stuff
[52:17] that makes up the earth you know you got
[52:19] iron you got copper help me out somebody
[52:26] here aluminum thank you so much
[52:30] beautiful I keep thinking of things that
[52:32] are put together you know but it's got
[52:34] to be
[52:35] it can't be things put together there's
[52:38] gotta be basic things carbon I think my
[52:42] chemistry days are 27 years ago or
[52:45] something you know but those things they
[52:47] come in useful every now and then
[52:49] children you know so keep up with your
[52:51] studies there you know but anyway the
[52:55] basic things that make up gold is one of
[52:59] the least reactive now we learned how
[53:01] reactive pyrite was setting off
[53:05] explosions and Hassen mine runoff and
[53:08] everything this low reactivity of gold
[53:14] makes it resistant to corrosion
[53:18] corrosion oxidate oxidation rusting as
[53:23] we would call it
[53:26] that's when a metal breaks down and
[53:28] weakens the most common form is rust
[53:32] gold will maintain its form a buried
[53:36] treasure chest of gold will not rust and
[53:41] it could even be at the bottom of the
[53:45] ocean for 500 years and they're out
[53:50] there diving for it because they know it
[53:52] hasn't changed in all that salt water
[53:58] this here I will talk about this slide
[54:03] in a minute real gold is rare whereas
[54:11] pyrite is the most common among the
[54:12] sulfide minerals and it's these
[54:15] properties that give gold its value now
[54:20] if you lay up treasure in other items
[54:22] like Jesus spoke about when he was
[54:24] speaking about laying up treasure such
[54:27] as cotton clothes a lot of clothings
[54:30] made of cotton blankets whatever would
[54:33] be wool food wood iron all of these
[54:42] items are subject to decay and they must
[54:47] be kept free from bugs air humidity and
[54:53] any other influence that may ruin their
[54:57] value also there will be a constant cost
[55:04] to maintain the value of them you know
[55:09] heating your house or humidifying your
[55:12] house or dehumidifier your house you
[55:16] know how many have ever had a moth get
[55:19] into their clothing yeah
[55:23] all of us have had it happen how many
[55:25] have ever had mold your clothing or your
[55:28] shoes mold we've been through it you
[55:32] know several of us yeah
[55:35] now military machinery is mostly made of
[55:39] these cheaper metals like iron which are
[55:43] subject to corrosion and to slow this
[55:46] corrosion process and protect their
[55:49] equipment the military has begun
[55:51] shrink-wrapping their equipment see if
[55:57] they made it of gold they wouldn't have
[55:59] to worry about it they probably couldn't
[56:00] get it off the ground if there's a
[56:01] helicopter it'd be too heavy but gold
[56:05] will hold its value even in a harsh
[56:07] environment now here this brings us to
[56:12] our slide here a wise person will not
[56:16] put their treasure in a place where bugs
[56:19] and rust can destroy it I'm talking
[56:24] about natural wisdom if you're smart and
[56:28] you're wealthy you're not gonna save up
[56:32] all kinds of clothing for one thing be
[56:35] out of fashion in 20 or 30 years and you
[56:39] just throw it all away or give it all
[56:41] the way you know but they will lay their
[56:46] treasure in something that holds its
[56:48] value and this gold bar here that we're
[56:51] looking at I think we all saw it's
[56:52] valued it was valued at when I did this
[56:55] back in 2016 approximately nine million
[56:58] eight hundred thousand dollars that's
[57:01] about 551 pounds of gold largest gold
[57:06] bar in the world so quite quite valuable
[57:09] there I've got a transition here and
[57:19] then get a little code and handwritten
[57:22] and all this if you'll bear with me for
[57:24] a moment we're gonna get this figured
[57:27] out
[57:34] worldly life can be typed to fool's gold
[57:39] or pyrite the unsaved life we're going
[57:44] to start with the outward beauty of
[57:46] pyrite in the crystal form fool's gold
[57:52] appears outwardly more beautiful and
[57:56] often the world with its wealth power
[58:02] and influence and education and all the
[58:06] things the world holds dear and
[58:08] treasures seems more beautiful than the
[58:12] Christian way you know I mean who did
[58:16] who looks better Jesus walking up a hill
[58:19] carrying across bleeding defeated to the
[58:25] earthly I or Herod walking around with
[58:28] his great beautiful robes and crown and
[58:30] palaces and servants and everything you
[58:34] know just to the first glance the world
[58:38] looks better than the gospel the Bible
[58:42] even tells us that also fool's gold we
[58:47] learned is brittle hard and not easily
[58:53] molded we know that the ungodly or the
[58:58] unsaved resists the gospel they resist
[59:02] God changing them and they even resist
[59:05] salvation and repentance they don't want
[59:09] it they don't want to hear it it's the
[59:12] stone that was rolled out of the
[59:15] mountain and it breaks the things that
[59:17] are in its way it breaks the world also
[59:24] the instability of Fool's Gold which
[59:27] causes so much trouble and construction
[59:30] and mining in different areas can be
[59:34] compared to hatred malice
[59:40] envy strife anger loss of self-control
[59:46] impatience and the unbeliever often
[59:51] hurts others around them like gossip or
[59:57] contentions or name-calling anger
[1:00:02] produces a lot of them things too
[1:00:08] finally pyrite is very common and we
[1:00:15] know that Jesus told us the broad way is
[1:00:17] the way to destruction and there's many
[1:00:21] that are going that way now in the same
[1:00:26] way that this fool's gold is a wonderful
[1:00:29] type the real gold is a wonderful type
[1:00:34] of the believer and of the truth and of
[1:00:38] the Spirit of God
[1:00:44] we'll start in this case that it's not
[1:00:47] very common and Jesus also said little
[1:00:51] flock yours is the kingdom so just like
[1:00:56] real gold if it was real common it
[1:00:59] wouldn't be that valuable but it's not
[1:01:02] that common and at first glance the
[1:01:11] false may look better than the real we
[1:01:13] covered that ok real gold is very
[1:01:18] workable they call it malleability or
[1:01:21] ductility God can work with the
[1:01:25] Christian easily bent formed and shaped
[1:01:30] to his desires a Christian is not
[1:01:34] brittle or easily broken or offended
[1:01:39] Matthew 11 6 says Jesus speaking and
[1:01:43] blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[1:01:46] offended in me
[1:01:49] and john 6:66 through 69 says and from
[1:01:54] that time many of his disciples went
[1:01:56] back and walked no more with him they
[1:01:58] were offended many of them then said
[1:02:03] jesus unto the twelve the few will ye
[1:02:06] also go away then Simon Peter answered
[1:02:08] him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast
[1:02:12] the words of eternal life and we believe
[1:02:15] and are sure that thou art that Christ
[1:02:17] the Son of the Living God now we know
[1:02:20] Jesus was speaking some hard things
[1:02:22] things they didn't understand the
[1:02:24] disciples were often confused and not
[1:02:27] sure of exactly what he was saying
[1:02:30] yet they knew there was something there
[1:02:33] they weren't gonna be broken off no
[1:02:36] matter how hard things got they were
[1:02:38] gonna stay with them it didn't break
[1:02:43] them it just bent them those hard things
[1:02:47] also real gold does not react easily
[1:02:51] with outside influences a scripture for
[1:02:55] us on that about not reacting easily is
[1:02:57] first Corinthians 13 for charity
[1:03:03] suffereth long and is kind charity
[1:03:06] envieth not charity vaunteth not itself
[1:03:09] is not puffed up does not behave itself
[1:03:13] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:03:17] easily provoked or easily angered
[1:03:20] thinketh no evil hard to get a reaction
[1:03:26] out of real gold where the Branham said
[1:03:32] in perfect faith 1963 that's the way it
[1:03:38] is to all believers speaking of Jesus
[1:03:40] they're a mystic the people don't
[1:03:42] understand because they live in a world
[1:03:45] to themselves Jesus lived in a world
[1:03:50] that nobody else could touch the
[1:03:51] disciples couldn't understand him they
[1:03:53] said why you talk in riddles and when a
[1:03:55] man lives by faith and walks by faith
[1:03:58] I mean substance faith he is isolated
[1:04:02] from the entire world and becomes a new
[1:04:06] creature in Christ there now you're
[1:04:09] getting into bride material amen so that
[1:04:14] condition where nothing can move you
[1:04:16] nothing can faze you it's like you're
[1:04:20] like gold you know nothing affects it
[1:04:22] hardly but it is very workable you know
[1:04:25] by the master workman gold is resistant
[1:04:32] to corrosion so Christian character
[1:04:35] gives one resistance to the corrupting
[1:04:37] influences of the world first John to 14
[1:04:41] through 17 I've written unto you
[1:04:44] father's because you've known him that
[1:04:45] is from the beginning I've written unto
[1:04:47] you young men because you're strong and
[1:04:50] the Word of God abideth in you and you
[1:04:53] have overcome the wicked one love not
[1:04:56] the world neither the things that are in
[1:04:58] the world
[1:04:58] If any man love the world the love of
[1:05:00] the father's not in him for all that is
[1:05:02] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[1:05:04] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:05:06] is not of the Father but is of the world
[1:05:07] and the world passeth away and the lust
[1:05:10] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[1:05:13] God abideth forever
[1:05:15] so the real Christian gold the spirit in
[1:05:19] your life gives you resistance to those
[1:05:22] corrupting influences it also gives you
[1:05:27] stability and value and that brings us
[1:05:30] back to our opening scripture which was
[1:05:32] Isaiah 33 6 and wisdom and knowledge
[1:05:36] shall be the stability of thy times and
[1:05:39] strength of salvation the fear of the
[1:05:43] Lord is his treasure my brother Bram
[1:05:46] says here speaking of brother Neville
[1:05:47] increments in concern 62
[1:05:49] I've known brother Neville for years in
[1:05:51] his lovely little life even before they
[1:05:53] were married and the years that I've
[1:05:55] known him he's never changed one bit
[1:05:56] only just went hiring God that's all
[1:05:59] but he's dependable we love him now is
[1:06:03] the pastor he's been in there for years
[1:06:05] and we hope he stays till Jesus comes if
[1:06:07] it be the will of the Lord
[1:06:09] now the properties of real gold make a
[1:06:13] good type of the real of Christian
[1:06:18] character but the true gold is not what
[1:06:23] most people know as gold
[1:06:26] elemental it's called au is the
[1:06:29] elemental symbol for gold the true gold
[1:06:33] is Christian character and in the church
[1:06:38] age Brook here in the Laodicean Church
[1:06:42] age he's saying come to me and buy it is
[1:06:47] evident from this phrase buy of me that
[1:06:50] the Laodicean Church is not at all
[1:06:52] dealing with Jesus for the spiritual
[1:06:55] products of the kingdom of God
[1:06:58] their transactions cannot be spiritual
[1:07:01] they may think that they are spiritual
[1:07:02] but how can they be the works in their
[1:07:06] midst are definitely not as Paul would
[1:07:07] say God in you willing and doing of his
[1:07:10] own good pleasure Philippians 2:13 thus
[1:07:14] what about all these churches schools
[1:07:15] hospitals missionary ventures etc God is
[1:07:18] not in them as long as their
[1:07:19] denominational seed and spirit and not
[1:07:22] the seed in Spirit of God buy of me gold
[1:07:24] tried in the fire that you may be rich
[1:07:30] now these glare to see in church they
[1:07:32] thought they were rich because they had
[1:07:34] real gold true I mean they had elemental
[1:07:39] gold they had the gold that glittered
[1:07:41] like this wedding ring here this is gold
[1:07:45] probably the only gold I have to my name
[1:07:47] but I wouldn't mind having more but you
[1:07:52] know God hasn't ordained that way yet if
[1:07:57] he does you know he does so we're not
[1:08:00] worried about that we're we're more
[1:08:01] concerned about the true gold so now
[1:08:05] these people had plenty of gold
[1:08:06] remember the Laodicean church was rich
[1:08:09] and thought they had need of nothing but
[1:08:12] it was the wrong kind it was the gold
[1:08:15] that bought men's lives and destroyed
[1:08:19] them
[1:08:20] it was the gold that warped and twisted
[1:08:23] human character for its love was the
[1:08:28] root of all evil
[1:08:30] so we see that elemental gold as
[1:08:34] valuable as it is is wonderful of
[1:08:36] characteristics as it has and I think
[1:08:40] we'd all be happy to have a little more
[1:08:41] if we could you know yet it's love the
[1:08:47] love of wealth which gold is a great
[1:08:49] symbol of is the root of all evil the
[1:08:53] Bible tells us I would stick with the
[1:08:55] ESV translation which says the root of
[1:08:58] many evils but that's a whole different
[1:08:59] thought there but anyway you could check
[1:09:02] with that one yourself or check with
[1:09:03] your pastor but a lot of translations
[1:09:05] say the love of money is the root of
[1:09:08] many evils or all kinds of evils King
[1:09:11] James says all evil I kind of hold of
[1:09:14] many different evils because if all evil
[1:09:18] comes from the love of money then how do
[1:09:21] you explain murder where there's no
[1:09:22] money involved at all that was evil you
[1:09:25] know but I don't see you know if people
[1:09:28] don't have money and and yet one murders
[1:09:31] the other out of hate that's an evil how
[1:09:36] many you would agree with me there is
[1:09:37] murder and evil okay thank you so the
[1:09:40] love of money isn't the root of the evil
[1:09:43] of murder so anyway that's just for free
[1:09:48] wow it's coming against the King James
[1:09:51] no I'm just you know I want to
[1:09:54] understand what the Bible says and we'll
[1:09:59] get back to our thought here the love of
[1:10:01] money was the root of all evil as it
[1:10:02] says but the gold of God 1st Peter 1:7
[1:10:07] the trial of your faith being much more
[1:10:09] precious than of gold that perisheth the
[1:10:13] gold of God is a christ-like character
[1:10:16] produced in the fiery furnace of
[1:10:19] affliction that is the right kind of
[1:10:21] gold but what kind of gold does a church
[1:10:23] have today it has but the worldly gold
[1:10:26] that will perish it is rich it is
[1:10:28] complacent it is made affluence or
[1:10:32] having money we would say
[1:10:34] the major criterion of spirituality so
[1:10:39] in many churches if you have money then
[1:10:41] you're considered a godly person because
[1:10:44] God has blessed you because you have
[1:10:46] money you know that's a lot of churches
[1:10:49] you know that's the way a lot of
[1:10:50] churches teach and thank and act you
[1:10:52] know the evidence of God's blessing and
[1:10:56] the correctness of doctrine etc is now
[1:11:00] based upon how many rich folks are
[1:11:02] involved in it he's talking about the
[1:11:04] Laodicean church you know the great big
[1:11:06] churches and the great payers and things
[1:11:09] I one of our brothers at the church back
[1:11:11] home was telling me he remembers when he
[1:11:13] was a boy and he'd sit in the church and
[1:11:15] he'd watched this man he said every time
[1:11:18] the offering plate came around so this
[1:11:19] man his wife both had rings on almost
[1:11:21] every finger and this man would take his
[1:11:24] big fat wallet out and he'd reach in
[1:11:26] there and grab a big wad of money and
[1:11:28] throw it in the plate
[1:11:29] and he said as a boy he would just every
[1:11:31] time the offer he came he to watch him
[1:11:33] cuz he wanted to see how much is he
[1:11:34] throwing this time he said it was a show
[1:11:37] it was all about a show you know that I
[1:11:38] bet he'd pull that wallet right out and
[1:11:41] pull that water you know he wanted
[1:11:44] everybody to see what he was doing you
[1:11:45] know and that's many people you know
[1:11:51] look at religion that way but that
[1:11:55] that's not what but that's a wrong view
[1:11:59] you had better come before it is too
[1:12:01] late saith the Lord and buy of me gold
[1:12:04] tried in the fire and then you will be
[1:12:08] truly rich are we getting it listen to
[1:12:12] me naked physically we came into the
[1:12:15] world
[1:12:17] butt-naked spiritually we will not leave
[1:12:19] it oh no we are going to take something
[1:12:21] with us what that something is is all we
[1:12:24] can take with us nothing less and
[1:12:26] nothing more so then what will we take
[1:12:29] with us we will take our character
[1:12:33] brother
[1:12:35] that is what we will take with us now
[1:12:39] what kind of character will you take
[1:12:40] with you will it be like his whose
[1:12:42] character was molded by suffering in the
[1:12:44] fiery furnace of affliction or will it
[1:12:46] be the softness of this characterless
[1:12:48] Laodicean people it's up to each of us
[1:12:51] now moving down here only the gold tried
[1:12:57] in the fire shall endure so the real
[1:13:01] gold is Christian character amen so we
[1:13:06] look at you know the the great value of
[1:13:09] natural gold and how it's so much more
[1:13:10] valuable than clothing or cars or all
[1:13:13] these different things because it can
[1:13:15] hold its value but that great value that
[1:13:19] it has as it said here very briefly
[1:13:21] talked about it's ruined thousands and
[1:13:25] thousands and millions of people the
[1:13:28] conquistadors came over to the Western
[1:13:31] world and just plundered and murdered
[1:13:34] and attacked all because they wanted to
[1:13:37] get the gold that the Mayas and the
[1:13:40] Aztecs and the Incas had and take it all
[1:13:42] back to Spain or wherever they were from
[1:13:44] you know terrible terrible terrible
[1:13:47] things have been done over this really
[1:13:50] good substance of gold so the real gold
[1:13:55] isn't the real gold the real gold is
[1:14:00] Christian character it's the Holy Spirit
[1:14:03] that's the real valuable thing amen 1st
[1:14:09] Peter 3:1 as we're winding down here or
[1:14:14] a33 I'm sorry this speaking to the
[1:14:17] ladies whose adorning let it not be that
[1:14:21] outward adorning of plaiting the hair
[1:14:25] and of wearing of gold or of putting out
[1:14:28] of apparel but let it be the real gold I
[1:14:34] added that part the hidden man of the
[1:14:37] heart in that which is not corruptible
[1:14:42] well you can't corrupt real gold but you
[1:14:45] can sure corrupt the use of it you know
[1:14:49] and do all kinds of Evil's with the real
[1:14:51] gold but this is not corruptible this is
[1:14:55] the hidden man of the heart even the
[1:14:58] ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[1:15:01] which is in the sight of God of great
[1:15:04] price a man there's a real real deal
[1:15:08] there brothers and sisters unseen things
[1:15:14] are more real than the seen brother
[1:15:17] branham Tata sis 1956 God's covenant
[1:15:20] with Abraham Christians don't look at
[1:15:23] things or I'm sorry Christians look at
[1:15:24] things they don't see and the things you
[1:15:29] don't see are more real than the things
[1:15:34] that you see you see that microphone
[1:15:38] it'll perish I see faith that'll never
[1:15:41] perish see I see love joy peace
[1:15:44] longsuffering goodness meekness
[1:15:45] gentleness patience every shield of the
[1:15:48] believer is supernatural everything that
[1:15:51] belongs in the realm of christianity is
[1:15:53] worked by supernatural an atheist once
[1:15:56] said to me said anything that can't be
[1:15:58] scientifically proven isn't real I said
[1:16:01] anything that can be scientifically
[1:16:04] proven isn't real
[1:16:05] that's vice-versa he said there's
[1:16:08] something wrong with you I yeah I got
[1:16:10] saved that's what's wrong so it's the
[1:16:16] real things sometimes it's hard for us
[1:16:19] you know I think in another place the
[1:16:22] Prophet talked about the pulpit he said
[1:16:23] that you know this Spirit of God is more
[1:16:26] real than this pulpit here you know the
[1:16:29] Bible says heaven and earth will pass
[1:16:30] away everything in it but the Word of
[1:16:33] God shall stand forever it's hard for us
[1:16:36] as human beings
[1:16:37] you know to look around us every day we
[1:16:39] wake up we we walk out the door we stub
[1:16:42] our toe that felt pretty real to me and
[1:16:45] you you know cuz that stubbed toe shot
[1:16:48] up through your nerves and your oh my
[1:16:51] toe my toe you know and you know you
[1:16:55] you're hungry your stomach is growling
[1:16:57] that feels pretty real to you and if I
[1:17:00] don't get food I'm gonna die and it's
[1:17:02] true you know you have to have food to
[1:17:05] live and sustain your life here but yet
[1:17:09] there's things more real than those
[1:17:12] things which seem so real seem so
[1:17:15] important seem so pressing a minute
[1:17:18] that's why we're here this morning and
[1:17:20] that because we recognize as the the
[1:17:24] song says things that are higher things
[1:17:27] that are nobler these have eluard my
[1:17:31] sight amen
[1:17:33] a stand is worth winding down here
[1:17:36] brother come to the piano just look up a
[1:17:56] quick scripture used to having a Bible
[1:18:02] actually didn't bring it out with me but
[1:18:04] we have one here so Galatians 6:15 as
[1:18:09] we're closing for in Christ Jesus
[1:18:14] neither circumcision availeth anything
[1:18:16] nor uncircumcision but a new creature or
[1:18:22] a new creation this new creature of
[1:18:26] creation that Paul speaks of is really
[1:18:29] what matters as Weymouth New Testament
[1:18:32] States it neither circumcision nor
[1:18:35] uncircumcision which are natural things
[1:18:39] earthly things is of any importance but
[1:18:44] only a renewed nature
[1:18:48] the only thing of real lasting value
[1:18:52] comes from the new birth and by the
[1:18:56] sanctifying cleansing power of the Holy
[1:18:58] Spirit that brings us to the true gold
[1:19:02] which is Christian character with the
[1:19:05] fruits of the spirit flowing and living
[1:19:08] in us rather than the works of the flesh
[1:19:10] I mean let's bow our heads and our
[1:19:11] hearts Lord God we thank you for your
[1:19:15] word we thank you that you show us that
[1:19:20] the things of nature the very elements
[1:19:24] themselves show forth the type of you're
[1:19:28] working in the human hearts and in the
[1:19:30] human lives and God we pray that you
[1:19:34] just give us that real gold or did we
[1:19:38] know we'd all like to have some of the
[1:19:40] gold that is heavy and workable and and
[1:19:45] useful and doesn't rust or corrode but
[1:19:50] god we'd we'd much rather have that real
[1:19:53] gold that gold of Christian character
[1:19:55] that gold of a new life a new birth the
[1:19:58] renewed nature with those virtues of the
[1:20:01] Holy Spirit flowing in us Lord we know
[1:20:04] sometimes that gold comes by through the
[1:20:07] fire of the refiners fire different
[1:20:11] messages have been spoken on that and
[1:20:14] will be spoken I'm sure well we know
[1:20:18] sometimes the gold comes at some price
[1:20:20] and sacrifice God but we just want to
[1:20:22] say this morning or this afternoon
[1:20:24] whatever it takes Lord we want that real
[1:20:28] gold in our lives that gold of the
[1:20:31] Spirit of God that gold of Christian
[1:20:33] character living and moving and flowing
