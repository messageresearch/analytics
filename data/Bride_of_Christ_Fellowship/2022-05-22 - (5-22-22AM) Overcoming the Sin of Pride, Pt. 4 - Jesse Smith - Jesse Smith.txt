TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first john 2 15. first john 2 15. lord willing just so the church knows you know next week when i go to both camps i'm going to preach two services lord willing so one of them i think i'm just going to preach on the book of joshua i started uh preaching that i think i've reached the first five chapters when i went to kansas church you know the highlights so i think i'm just going to preach the last part of that lord willing i kind of felt as i'm meditating on the word and things i kind of feel had to preach that and then the other one i think i'll preach on pride overcoming pride by god's grace so just so you know i i never like to preach anything new other places i mean i don't travel much anymore you know but uh just wanna let you know that's kind of what i'm feeling let me minister on we'll see how the lord directs us maybe we'll go to gideon and i'm not sure how the lord will direct that or maybe just put it all together put all those thoughts together god is good i'm gonna be grateful for god's amazing grace and we're so thankful today with the saints today just make sure you like stephanie or anybody okay good all right first john 2 15 through 17. let's read all of it together maybe do a little extra reading today by god's grace let's begin on three one two three love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him verse 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the congress but is of the world verse 17 and the world passes away the lust thereof that he that doeth the will of god almighty prayer let's have one more word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's just make it known unto god here heavenly father lord we're grateful you fight our battles lord hallelujah we can't fight him alone we don't have enough we don't have any power of our own lord god we just have your authority that you've given to us and we're so grateful for that lord god we we just have the keys to the kingdom like you gave to peter and the saints lord god hallelujah and we can only use them at your direction so father we thank you god for your amazing grace you are forgive us of any sin lord god as we come before you in the word lord speak to us now lord break the bread of life to us lord feed us oh god from your word from heaven lord just move me out of the way lord move any of us out of the way and may the holy spirit be the one we focus on god the one we feed on worship hallelujah when we give glory and honor to you lord jesus we come to worship you and love you lord god we need you in this hour lord god hallelujah we need you lord as we see the world getting darker and more wicked and more violent and more hate hateful all the time how do you make us more holy how to do it make us more loving oh god make us more in your image and god help us to overcome every one of our battles for lord it doesn't matter what we have to overcome it only matters that we overcome by the word hallelujah so teach us to overcome every obstacle every trial by the word of god in jesus christ's name the saints say amen amen god bless you as you're being seen praise god i have some quotes here by god's grace some scriptures you'd like to point to so we looked at our texts here we'd like to continue on this thought now i changed the title i've been calling it overcoming pride and that just didn't sound right to me as i thought about it i just want to kind of retire overcoming the sin of pride because we think of overcoming grace and overcome overcoming strength overcoming revelation i said well that doesn't sound right let me change it to overcoming the sin of pride so just a little slight change but same idea um you know we as i was you know preparing i just kind of was led to some of these scriptures i never really thought about it before you know we are we're going to be battled in one of three channels praise god the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life how many could say amen to that amen we're going to battle every single day of our lives brother we'll get to these quotes later brother brandon says can you avoid temptation he says never never you'll never get to a spot where you can overcome being overcome just being tempted we're going to be constantly tempted every single day praise god sure we're never just going to be able to avoid that yes we can walk in such an anointing you know uh for a little verse where uh like moses where pharaoh doesn't know what to do with moses but now look first look at that now first as soon as he gets out there and gets the red seat what happens he says lord you left us here you called us here to the red sea and the lord says why are you crying to me so see he was he was only just untouchable for so long because eventually that anointing leaves praise god eventually god wants us to remember that we're nothing and he wants us to teach us he wants to teach us rather to rely upon him in every area of our life praise god so yes you can live so close to satan i'm sorry so close to the lord that satan doesn't know what to do with you you can live so close under the anointing of the holy spirit the devil doesn't know what to do for a little portion but then you're going to sit back into that human mind amen slip back in the flesh and the cares of the world or the human thinking and then we got the crowd to god again amen just like moses he cried out and then when he cries out god gives the instruction and the rebuke he rebukes him and says why are you crying speak and go forward praise god see church the holy spirit is not going to be a slack to rebuke us if we know better if we if we know the word of god and we've been trained and taught and we've been experienced servant of god our servants of god as we as we believe even as the bride you know god is gonna sometimes bring a word to bring rebuke to us and that that is only to say lord forgive me and thank you for the word now i'm going forward i know the direction you want me to go praise god amen now church as we look at i'm just going to emphasize this scripture a little more here you and i have to break down our own pride which means humility we have to humble ourselves or god has no other choice but to break us so we're either going to break ourselves or god will break us in church many times you see it when our life is so busy and we don't have time to pray like we ought to and we don't have time to just read the bible like we ought to and talk to the lord like we all do we don't have time to fellowship with the saints like we ought to right now we do it to ourselves sometimes right and so god will have to just make us even more busy and have this breakdown and that and that fail all these things in order so what is it god breaking us to bring us back to humility amen praise god that's in the believer's life now that's the kind of mercy i want praise god amen i want that kind of mercy where it brings me back to humility praise god and back to a more humble walk with the lord but we've got that choice the bible says humble yourselves and as we showed last sunday you've got to choose the garment of humility how many war today's church amen you choose that garment of humility to put that on i come i come to serve people sure i don't come to be served i'm coming to be the servant that's the lord amen that's what we should have put on how can i be a blessing to a brother or sister how can i be a strength to somebody else today i use my voice i use my hands uh i use my my hugs or my fellowship you know i use my words of encouragement lord just use me as i put up this garment usually that i can be a servant to you to bless your people amen oh yes oh my god so see that's what it must be done daily break down your pride now more winning this week i'll get out my next youtube video it's on this question people have asked me if you're if your spouse isn't serving the lord how do you how do you approach your life the first thing about ram says is to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness true brother tells a woman who's married to a sinner man if he tells you don't read your bible don't go to church but i said you don't have to submit to that that's right because jesus says you're not worthy of me if you won't love me more than father mother husband brother or sister amen that's right see we don't have to submit to anything someone tells us we're married or not and that tells us to deny the word of god jesus is our true husband amen jesus jesus is our true head praise god so yeah we want to be humble you know and we want to be uh submissive about submitting yourselves unto one another the fear of the lord but we always just remember true humanity is submitting to god above everybody else amen and let me say that includes your boss too and the church said boss tells you to work sunday sorry can't do that are you losing your job well thanks for the time i'll get another job holidays now god gives us grace but see god wants to see submissive heart in every area of our lives praise god amen hallelujah and if not god will slowly break us down or maybe quickly break us down god has different seasons of our lives now the scripture where where god says this is through jeremiah of course uh he gives them a an analogy rather he said for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem break up the follow ground and sow not among thorns okay so he's telling them a couple of different things here first your ground has become really hard in other words even if seeds were planted there they wouldn't even bring forth because it's so hard it's got to be broken up it's got to have a place to land it's got to have a place to be buried amen hallelujah and so god tells them to do that god gives them that option first he gives them that option first you need to humble yourself you need to break up the follow ground plowing is hard work i don't plow with tractors i plow with a shovel that's what i play with in my car not about you but i get off the shovel and i plow and try to turn over the ground not a lot lately but in years past i would do that break it up to follow ground amen who else is going to do it i've got to do it who else is going to humble yourself you've got to do it praise god you've got to do the hard work of recognizing lord i've become i've become hard i've been cold here my watch got a little cold here or my uh i've got a little cold here towards that brother or that sister i got a little cold toward church i got a little cold towards so and so you know if we get cold or get hard it's our responsibility to make it soft again amen amen it's our responsibility to go over there and start working on the ground amen hallelujah just like they say just a little talk with jesus breaks up the final ground amen you gotta say like that praise god amen it's a little talk you know it just takes a little bit of a a fellowship a little bit of repentance and it breaks up the hardness of your heart and then he also says don't sow your word seeds among cares of the world amen oh what a lesson about coming to church amen let's not come to church we're not going to receive any word seed unless we forget about all the cares of the world and be encouraged you made the big step to get here praise god because they hate to save me here on the live stream thank god for the live stream but it's not the same as being here amen because when you're in here you're totally shut up praise god now you can do that but i we just know it's harder to do what you're live streaming it's much harder because you've got the fridge you got uh the iced tea whatever you got you know ice water hopefully whatever you got you know you got all these distractions but here there's nothing here god's people god's word god's worship everything's on god you're in a holy place you're in a separated place you're in a place where there's a difference between holy and unholy sacred and not sacred we're in a sacred place and that's where god wants you to plant the word of god in your heart when there's no charism in the world and all you care about is pleasing jesus then he says break up your follow grounds to give them two analogies here one to a gardener or farmer and one to a surgeon or a priest right circumcise yourselves to the lord right take away the foreskins of your heart right you men of judah inhabitants of jerusalem let my fury come forth like or i'm sorry lest my fury rather come forth like fire and burn that nun can quench it because of your evil doing so these are people that are doing evil over and over and over again these are people we'd say backslidden or never safe to begin with right but we can all relate we can all relate to having a hard heart can't we we can all relate to doing evil sometimes amen amen because we all sin every single day and so what god is telling them you need to have a surgery he says a permanent surgery you need to have a permanent such uh separation you've got to make yourself where it's hard you've got to make if you don't feel softness toward god you got to pray until you get the softness back amen my brother man told the married people uh again i'm working on this video so the quotes are kind of fresh on my mind a husband who was married uh to a woman and had a son the husband said brother branham i'm having it i'm finding it hard to claim my family because of all their worldly habits he says and he says he said i love your message it thrills my soul but then when we look at his wife and son it depressed his soul right and the church said never felt that way you love the message you love the word but then you see people's response to it and it really really frustrates you sure sure and he asked me he said how can i do this and brother answer response goes something like this he said you've got to have the sweetness of the holy spirit [Music] he says and if you don't have it pray until you get it amen praying do you get it praise god so how do i get how do i claim a family member you've got to pray until you feel good about it praise god [Music] that's hard work though brother just yeah i know plowing is hard work yes it is surgeries are really serious right circumcisions are very serious right it's very you got to be sincere you got to know that i've if i'm going to change my heart i'm going to change my thinking i'm going to change my mind it's going to be a lot of hard work because in other words it's going to be a lot of soul searching amen we've got to search our hearts search our motives search our objectives praise god that's why i found church sometimes it's helpful to go back and listen to a sermon from a year ago or two years ago or and you might see yourself shouting or clapping and then looking well look what i used to be help me jesus yeah it happens to me all the time i'm i'm guilty as anybody right because we're all human that's what every believer is going to battle they're going to battle pride as life goes on if the devil don't get you in less than the eyes that's the flesh then he's going to try to battle you in pride praise god we saw that last sunday it's not if you're going to be tested with pride it's when you're going to be tested with pride and the older you get the more you got to battle pride amen hallelujah that's exactly right happened to every single man of god down down the line you can look at every single one of their lives every single one of them by the end of their life the main thing that the battle is pride thinking they had figured it out they knew all about it in terms of help god help us never to think we've arrived and we don't have to pray anymore we have to seek god anymore we just know everything about everything oh my that's where a lot of people get church is sad and you can see it many times in their lives as we've been looking at but it's hard work now church here's where i got to just lay this in you know there's a lot of people that say you've got to get baptism of the holy ghost after baptism holy ghost and baptism after baptism i know there's a quote on that but that doesn't line up with the bible the bible said jesus says in acts chapter 1 verse 5 jesus said terry there up in jerusalem until you're baptized with the holy ghost and fire he didn't say until you get your first out of many baptisms he said make sure you go there until you're baptized with the holy ghost and fire amen one baptism remember uh james and john's mother asked jesus uh can my two boys sit on your right left he said can you be baptized with the baptism that i'm baptized with he didn't say can you get one out of a hundred baptisms it was one baptism amen the soul gets baptized one time the soul gets of nature and change one time amen it's one time now because we believe that in line with the bible sometimes church i feel like in churches like ours that believe the truth like that we don't do a good enough job of getting the baptism in the spirit more often it's true in other words we let we get lazy in our minds true see you know so like i said like this at least the churches that say baptism after batsmen at least they know i need a fresh feeling right that's where i've got a poor morse preaching into that yeah in other words you need to transform mind absolutely we need a mind that thinks the same as when we first got saved amen that's right because i think even in our brothers and sisters heirs that believe in baptism after baptism even in their heir i think they're getting blessings because they know i need my mind in other words i need to fill it up praise the lord i'm not filled up on god's word and i want to be filled up i was the same uh joy that i had at the beginning i want the same excitement i had here in other words fill my mind back up transform my mind let my mind be baptized with the holy ghost amen so i just thought that thought came to me yesterday i thought no i better preach that another word church here we got to break up the the fallow thoughts the hard thoughts sure the hard feelings we got to break those up and let god's word be planted there and god's word will produce love and forgiveness uh and hope amen hope for a future praise god amen let me just make sure i'm clearly preached by god's grace you need a baptism after baptism in your mind praise god if you're not born again yeah your soul first needs a baptism praise god yeah don't stop like a pentecostal way well i spoke in tongue once or i jumped once and i shouted once i don't need it again no no no no get it in your soul and then in your mind say god restore my mind i'm getting i'm getting weak but never satan his whole desire is to weaken the nations that's right his whole desires to slowly weaken you so when we see ourselves not serving god with the same amount of zeal with the same amount of fervency we've got to repent we've got to break up our follow thoughts amen we've got to cut away any evil thoughts or any roots of bitterness [Applause] i hope that five-minute segment there was a blessing praise god i could preach your own sermon on that and maybe i will one day by god's grace i just want to say that's the that's the kind of thing we have to be cautious for since we don't believe in soul baptism after soul baptism after soul like some people do we've got to say i need a mind baptism mind baptize my mind peanut my mind restore my mind fill my mind with hope amen fill my mind with faith hallelujah amen so that's what you and i need and if you're not born again you need in the soul praise god so keep pressing on hallelujah now here is where god now leviticus 26 has both blessing and curse it's very similar to deuteronomy 28. he says he tells israel if you will not yet for all this hearkening to me then i will punish you seven times more for your sins to see church but they knew better because they knew better sometimes the chastisement was harder right so people denominations they may not get chasing as hard as you and i would because we know better yeah right that's that's what israel because you know better and you're procured people and i brought you out of egypt and i brought you right here i brought you if you disobey you might get jason seven times harder praise god that's real quiet on that one because you're waiting what's coming next i'm not sure what's going next i'm waiting on the lord too remember paul what paul he needed humility what did god do he sent that buffeting satanic messenger in his flesh yeah did he not that's right to keep him from pride amen it didn't say he fell to pride it just said he had to be kept from pride amen so be humble he'd be humble and he wouldn't exalt himself because of all his revelations see so see church seven times more so in other words there's a the there's accountability that's the word i'm looking for there's responsibility brother says if you if you put a log in the water it'll rot out twice as fast right and he compares that if you put a christian uh in the word of god if you put a christian word with god and they're not growing and they're not feeding on it they'll ride out twice as fast sure right because they're not letting the word of god take effect they should be and they're responsible to do it amen they're supposed to do it praise god sure if they don't do it they're going to get spanked that's right now i just want to maybe i'll do this if i could have just a little bit of liberty here which i always know i got my home church by god's grace appreciate everybody love everybody i just want to bring this up again the bible does say uh we get spiritual spankings uh i just want to bring that up the bible said i know it's hard to receive but whosoever the lord loveth he chastens and scourges now scourges scourge what a scourge means to whip right jesus got scourged on the night of his arrest the church when people say they're getting a spiritual spanking there's a reality to that brother and accuser that left the message say oh oh brother god was the was the was not a loving god and he would take your child if you disobeyed but what does the bible say the bible says god means business he would rebuke israel seven times more because they knew better and the bible said he scourges every son that comes to him so in other words he spanks all of his children right how many have been received by god i mean how many feel like god's received you as a child of god then you're open to be corrected praise god then he's going to make sure he quickly corrects you praise god especially if you're getting into some serious sin whether it's lust of the eyes less of the fresh flesh the pride of life and church it's a good thing he does do it right amen praise god sometimes we get weak and we don't break up the ground of our mind if we don't do that who knows what we could do right who knows what we could do program always almost convinced to leave the field and go live up in the mountains almost convinced almost it but thank god the angel lord was there who's there to protect you amen who camps around you amen because you fear the lord the angel of the lord and thank god he sends his angels as a ministering spirit to help us in the time of need amen amen hallelujah thank god thank you lord so yes you're a special people yes you're the bride yes god loves you yes you're more than a conqueror but if you disobey the heavenly father he may scourge you so god help us verse 19 why well here in this case now because they disobey plainly he says i will break the pride of your power oh see so see because because they wouldn't break their up their own fallow grounds god said fine then i'm going to break you i'd rather break myself praise god right now i'd rather break myself humble myself then have god break me yeah because who knows what could happen yeah you don't even want to think what would happen right if god has got to the spot where i've got to break them down in humility it could be like nebuchadnezzar you could lose your mind that's true some of these bested people that lose their mind what happened this might be it right they know better they've been taught better right they've been preached at all these years and they might have received it for a while but as soon as they turn into night god's got to do something if they're not going to humble themselves god's got to spank his child god's got to bring him back thank god he does he's a loving father amen amen now we'll shout when he blesses us but why don't we shout when we know he's going to discourage us amen and the church said it's the same god it's not a different god it's not a different person it's not the second person or the third person it's the same verse the same person that showers that blessing is the same when they're singing come on over here son and fake us do we still love him yes yes don't fight against him now we're all going to try to get out of the way of that spanking we're all going to try to get out of the way but he's going to spend it all right you won't if you don't humble yourself he's going to humble you amen break the pride of your power have mercy and i'll make your heaven as iron and your earth is brass he said it's going to start affecting uh what you reap and so your strength will be spent in vain it seems like every everything i try to do ends up in vanity i can't get ahead the church said amen for your land shall not yield or increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits i'm not going to read the whole context but you understand that here all you gotta do is go back to deuteronomy 28 we can preach that again i preached this little series on lessons and cursings last year two years ago that's all we got to do it affects everything it affects your food your family your money your income your church affects everything if we won't humble ourselves when the word of god comes then god's got to break us mercy and he's got a scourges that's exactly right remember the amoeba's case i think that brother just said for months for months he laid in bed and the doctor said this is the worst amoebas case we have ever seen and he thought uh he thought uh that he might never go back on the field again and brother bowser tell you just started he said you're just a boy the man was talking like it's the end of his ministry at the end of his life and brother you said you're just the boy you're just getting started see sometimes we think that it's the end we think it's all over and we got to remember not just we got to remember that that god is trying to get us to repent praise god god's trying to get back on the right road he's trying to get our heart in the right kind of condition to receive the word of god amen amen all because he told these preachers i'm going to go preach in a church of 300 rather than 15 000 out in the fields remember in south africa right they wanted to preach to 300 people in the room rather than 15 000 at the racetrack that's true my brother went to the 300 yeah rather than the 15 000 yeah we might think that's crazy but you haven't been overseas then if you think that because that person is taking care of you they're driving you around all right they're buying all your food right you just want to treat them good because they're training you good true tell us it was a denominational spirit yeah he catered in that game he catered to the domination spirit because of that for months he laid with one of the worst the worst case of amoebas uh the jeffersonville doctors had ever seen that's a spanking right that's just thinking see church and we're saying that because brother brown was a real man of god so are you a real man and woman of god but a real man and woman of god can get mixed up on pride and god's got to scourge every sign that he receives and if you want if you receive then you've got to accept the discouragement as well praise god you got to accept the good and bad praise god it really is bad because it's our fault ahead that's why yeah hallelujah now you ever wondered about this scripture the context of the scripture jesus was talking about was about the jews rejected the kingdom of god he said but the gentiles will receive it jesus told the parable you know about lending out the kingdom and uh and the jews would reject the kingdom and he said therefore i say to you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you israel and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof now look you ever wonder about this whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken true but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder so there's something in other words everybody's got to come to this stone and this stone is either going to fall on you or you're going to fall on the stone but if this stone falls on you it just doesn't it just doesn't fall on that up it's going to keep pushing down the pressure is going to get harder and harder and harder and grind you down to where you are only powder there's you can't there's so many pieces the pieces are all broken and he's just totally crushed church people get crushed because they won't obey the word of god their whole life falls apart they call their life a waste of life but it doesn't have to be that way let's be the other side let's not let it fall on us let's go down and lord crush me amen lord break me follow the lord in other words follow jesus feet and ask for his mercy amen amen that's the thing to do praise god follow in prayer follow follow the friends of jesus christ and follow him praise god he'll you'll be broken and you'll have a fresh start and you'll be able to to know that i've forgiven and that and that you've come to him and he's received you praise god bless the lord amen bless his holy name he's either going to grind you down with pressures in life and difficult trials where you you're just you're totally right but god still is dealing with the gentiles and it still could happen we saw it even in uh remember we all saw even the corinthian church remember the man sleeping with his stepmom but paul is basically saying give him up to the devil so that his soul might be saved in other words let the devil grind him and push him down and ruin his life just so that his soul might be saved because he wouldn't fall down and humble himself in the presence of the church is that right aren't you glad you're overcoming the sin of pride hallelujah a perfect example of god breaking a man the prodigal says give me my money i want my inheritance now i wonder how much it was 50 000 for our day 100 000 a million you can spend a million dollars really fast especially with inflation these days real fast but the bible said he went on with uh licentious living and all spent all his money and he finds himself in the worst place a jew could find themselves with swine yeah unclean animals the word the most wicked thing that you could ever see was a pig yeah so he finds himself in the he knew i'm a covenant i'm a covenant jew right but i find myself at the lowest spot there's no lower i could be and it was his own doing now we get a beautiful picture here that he had lost his mind and the church said right he had lost his mind he he let demons come in demons of lust and no doubt blessed the flesh in this one lust of the eyes pride life he let all these demons come in and he wasn't even himself it's like when he left his mom and dad was like this is not even the same person that we knew that's not the boy we raised he was a good boy yes he became because of the influence of demons he become a completely different person yeah and so those demons drove him to the harvest the demons drove me up we'd say to the uh the modern day uh car dealership to get the fanciest cars you know it drove him to all these places where normally he wouldn't go but that's because he wasn't himself he was possessed with demons in the mind and god had to let famine come now at first they'd say oh it's not going to rain for a week oh that's no problem i got some extra money well they said it's not going to rain for a month oh no better start counting my pit my pennies here sir it's like it rained for six months oh my goodness i'm going down to my very last few bucks here let's go it's gonna rain they said it's gonna get some rain next week let's go let's go get drunk again let's go get some more harvest and it kept going let's say eight months nine months we don't know how long the famine went but it was slowly god was trying to get him to repent all these times and when he wouldn't do it he finally got to the spot where he's feeding filthy pigs and then their food looks good to him ah think about that the slop think of a slide everyone's seen slots lately i see it all the time in the school the school trash can because they throw all the they threw all the food in there slots yeah the slops look good in other words death looks good or being a beast looks good yo that kind of light looks good and the bible said he finally came to himself praise god when he's in the lowest deepest spot when god is writing him down god's breaking him god's bringing him to realize you're nothing you've made the wrong place and thank god he has the right attitude he said lord i sin i'm going to go to my father i sinned against you and i sinned against my father in other words have mercy on me hallelujah amen have mercy on me i've been prideful i've done it to myself he could blame nobody else and church really this is a gospel story this is all of our story when we first got saved and if you don't feel that way maybe you better check your salvation praise god he says i will go to my father i will go humble myself so these teachers that's what we got to do we got to humble ourselves we have to humble ourselves either you'll do it or god will do it hallelujah there's places church people go there's places spiritually people go they thought they'd never go to that's where that's where we're going to get to with uziah do you think uzziah would ever think he would be covered with leprosy because of his own sin there's places in church sometimes people go if they get if they won't take the correction of the holy spirit they would never ever i'd never do that like that one time my wife warned the sister my wife had a dream that a sister of the message had cut her hair wearing pants my wife went to her humbly and said i had this dream she laughed it off within a couple years she cut her hair in worn pants laughed it off laughed off a warning of the holy spirit see they they never would imagine they'd be and that now this woman has basically lost her mind she's on medication divorced again and all kinds of things all because the person won't humble themselves they won't repent they won't take god's word seriously they won't obey things that they used to love they that sister used to stand right by us and raise the hands and shout and clap when brother brooks would preach your brother greg brother i'm sure she's standing next to you at some point but stand right there what happened disobeying the father cried i know more about it i want to live my life church we don't have a life we don't want to live any life except the life of christ amen the life that he would have us to live that's the life we want to choose amen and submit to that praise god amen hallelujah warning after warning after warning if you don't if you don't fall on this stone this stone is going to crush you down grind you down where it looks like there's nothing left is there anything left is there any hope for this person's life the only hope is for that soul to be saved the bible says in those cases i want to read this again church i shared this with our brother yesterday i think i started in part one now he's talking about uziah we're going to get to uzi again in just a moment but i want to skip down to the blue here uzziah learned a great lesson god orders his man to the place see man cannot order himself god orders his man god makes you what you are yeah so god made me a teacher god made me a preacher now i've got a choice i can understand that or i can try to get out of it and try to run from it my brother man says most times people want to run from their commission right see god orders his man and he mustn't take another man's place and it was a lesson to isaiah that he mustn't put his eyes on human beings for an example but he must put his eyes on god you see god has a certain place for you god has a certain position to you but you've got to be humble with that and you've got to be content with that and satan is going to try to use the sin of pride to try to tempt you to leave your calling in life leave your position in life he's going to try to tempt you to leave that but you've got to turn him down how you know brother jess pray go back to the word does this does this look at the effects if i make this decision it's going to draw me closer to god or it's going to take me any even one step further from god if it takes me one step further from god i'm against that i'm stepping toward the gospel i'm obeying god's will i don't do what god wants me to do i was telling i mean i told this before but for four or five years in a row i was praying god made me a principal i was only looking at a dollar bill signs brother man i don't look at dollar bills and i go into interview i'd pray before the interviews i just thought well god's going to naturally make me a principal all these things and each time i would miserably fail and all the interviews the one time i was looking my fingers too much i was going like this licking papers and guys like you're looking for papers too you're looking your fingers too much i'm just trying to look at my papers it says like little things little things that were just ruined by interviews and then covet hit now this is years later and then i saw the pressure on principles oh yes and they were meeting all summer for hours it was supposed to be their vacation time they're meaning planning for copenhagen church it hasn't really let up too much no no i've received different things from different principles i know i've just heard them talking and they're like i didn't even know if i could ever make it through this school year i didn't know if i could make it through that school year now by god's grace i've never really felt like that but god was showing me i was trying to get out of position and if i would have went in there it probably would have made me crazy i probably would have been so uh overwhelmed with all the even though i had more money in my pocket i would have had less joy in my heart yeah and the church said amen it's not always about more money church god had to teach me that through failure failure disappointment like disappointment praise god but i can see now it's the wisdom of the holy spirit yes thank you jesus it's the wisdom of god yes because what is the most valuable thing god said teach us to number our checks in our checkbook no he didn't say that teach me teach me to number all my debit account transactions teach me to count all my bonus checks is that what god said no god said teach me the number of my day that i might apply my heart to wisdom [Music] wisdom because we only have a certain number of days yeah and we want to fill those days with efforts for the kingdom of god and his righteousness yes but see god is going to make you what you are oh lord jesus have mercy god want you to be a factory worker you'll be the best factory worker you can right stay at home mother whatever you are accountant whatever you are right be the best one that you can be a church god will make if god wants you to go somewhere he'll take you there praise god just like you did joseph now you might have to go to the dungeon first right don't forget that well i want to be somebody great i wanted to do something great well you might have to go the dungeon first do you remember that i'm after beyond the wilderness 40 years like moses oh lord merciful jesus see god orders your steps god makes you what you are yeah so we don't put our eyes on any human being we put our eyes on christ jesus lord jesus what do you want from my life open up doors close doors just love your prayers like that lord uh the word is neutral everything about that word all week what was that word i kept thinking what was that word when you don't want to be on either side what is that word it's neutral i need to put it i just need to put on a post-it note right up here don't forget be no not unless you've got god's word or something like that unless you've got like a certain leading of the lord in other words be neutral a christian is humble a christian knows god's ways are way higher than my ways so christian can be neutral i'll just let god do it that's that's what i've learned learn to do i'll just let god do it praise god right we must all learn that we'll just let god do it amen blessed be the name of the lord now that's us brother said that's us who's us we must keep our eyes on god any man is subject to mistakes he's subject to error because he's human he's subject to the violations of god laws and he is subject to many things because satan tempts him and he's just a human being i'm let's all say i'm just a human being ready and if god ever lifted his hands off your life church you would fall that's all lord if god ever would take his anointing off you you'd be a failure have mercy lord i heard i purposely said i've heard he said i heard people say oh satan can't do that to me satan can't touch me i'm the bride i'm this you better be careful oh yes you better oh yeah what'd you say that's right he says yes you just let god now this is after let me say after after the seals for all those people that uh well i only think what comes after the sales but here he goes right after this just perfect for you and just you know it's eight months after the seals it's more than half of a year let god just lift his hand one time and watch what sin would come in your life i'll just say it like that i constantly pray god i'm so great i'm such an overcomer i'm the bride no one can touch me is that what he said no i put that in there he said i constantly plead god don't send him satan have mercy on me yes keep satan away from me amen amen now we know church he comes in seasons so if you're in a season he's not around hey how's it going to rejoice [Applause] because you know the battle is coming back amen the season's coming back but he says he prays he's keeping him away from me that's jesus's model prayer hallelujah right remember jesus totally he taught us to pray uh let no temptation what it's not coming to me all right matthew 6 i don't know why i set my mind here all right that's the very prayer of a christian jesus taught us to pray yes yeah he says yeah there's lead us i don't know i can think of that lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil amen in other words keep satan away from me amen keep the keep the tempter away from me amen keep your hands upon me praise god deliver me from evil hallelujah and say like this deliver me from myself yeah that's because i'm actually my worst enemy right yeah you're actually your worst enemy that's right keep your anointing on me lord god so i don't live for myself i don't live a prideful life i live a humble life amen have mercy on me he said i need god's mercy we all need that amen that's one of the most beautiful quotes i've read in a long time there's a lot of beautiful quotes but that's a real beautiful one to me praise god yeah look at the humility of this man he stood before which doctors he'd seen the blind received their eyes the literal eye sockets right the eyes in the eye sockets he's seen a congressman a paralyzed man rise up you would think he would be like on cloud nine and i'm just a faith machine i'm gonna just heal you and heal you and heal you and he he was just to be a faith machine but he wasn't he was a man he was humble he was the prophet of god who knew the word of god he knew there was a real devil but he also knew there was a real god praise the lord he said god would ever lift this hand of protection off me i'd certainly fall oh yes that's why god sent the angel before he left the scene and standing in the gap amen praise that's why god sent the angel he would have failed the angel said your wife would have left you now how would that have looked today yeah if we've been preaching and well brother i was really really on fire well it's about 1963 you know right after the seals his wife left him and you know so brothers if you want to leave your wives that's okay i mean can you imagine sisters you can leave your husbands if you want to because it happened to the prophet of god but who kept him from evil god kept it for me glory to god from evil god amen god's hand upon you keep saying the word satan get back say move back let the presence of god cover my life all week not all week just one time oh no just one time that god's anointing your mind what would you do oh lord you don't want to know what you do no you don't want to know what i do no or brother or anybody else no just one time let that anointing lead oh lord what would you do okay if you want a clue just look at the centers around you that happens haven't come to the message right your sister's probably put on bikinis brothers would probably follow them right out there on the beach all right run run into a theater movie theater and watch the avengers or whatever they got now batman or whatever hell man what are they all hell man whatever they are right bat dog man big man whatever they are they're all they're all demons they all want to be uh they don't want to be exalted like there's some pride like they got some superpowers only god satan's power is what they got see it's god's mercy that each time his hand is upon us oh yes hallelujah i don't want to forget that quote so i might be rehearsing that brother amen brother bank just you know i might be bringing that every every couple months i might be bringing that quote out okay to remind you i need to humble myself be thankful for god's constant protection on my life brother jesse brother bang a sister naomi brother jose how can you live this life god's hand is upon him his hand because if it wasn't you don't know what you do now i just want to go i just want to get a little i listen to a yesterday i was uh i just i was driving home from you know with the kids you know what i was listening to a sermon on i want to look for a sermon called pride throughout the whole bible i just i saw this i just clicked on a baptist preacher you know i listened to brother this week i listened to influence god talked about uzziah but i want to listen to a another like this in the sermons and this baptist preacher brought out uzziah's now brother branham labored on usaid if you look up influence he preached it numerous times probably five to ten times and he's talking about the influence that uzziah lived under and then isaiah had to find the right influence right because isaiah looked at uzziah at the end of his life and then isaiah saw him fall away and he's like how could this happen and then god brought isaiah into the temple and then he saw the lord high exalted and highly lifted up now get your influence from that it's your influence from those holy seraphims that are reverent and they fear god and they're in action from the angels of god amen god almighty but this baptist preacher thought i'd never really seen before so you've got your bible go to second corinthians or second chronicles 25 second chronicles 25 rather i'm just going to pull a few thoughts and then i had some thoughts of my own a church i just thought it was so interesting fathers and sons and let me say like this mothers and daughters probably battle a lot of the same things right sure you might feel bad about that but that's actually an encouragement like i know what i battle with so i go to my son and i can say malcolm you know we're on the drive home you got a battle with this and that and he might say oh that's the same thing i bet well now he's got a he's got a mentor you're right now me i can't talk to my dad my dad he's depressed you know don't talk to me about those things but mount guy he's got it good your children got it good they got you in their house they have to take you hallelujah amen so amaziah and uzziah battled pride abraham and isaac battle lying yeah brother hey that lying spirit will come around every now and then when the pressure comes on right if they didn't pray about it pass it down she's not my wife no no no she don't like you you can have it you could have you imagine what sarah yeah what what or rebecca what no i'm not your wife what god said eliezer you know what what about all that testimony what are you doing can you imagine church this is what they battled amen father and son does the bible say uh that the iniquity is the father visit the children all right don't the bible say that but don't but don't the bible also say that when we become sons god gives us the power to become the sons of god amen how do you do the bible say that we got into a spiritual seed now i got spiritual in his power i got power through my heavenly father i got power and authority in the name of jesus christ amen yeah we're gonna have natural battles think about that by the amen the battle is your dad thought you're going to fight many of those yes that's true each one of us yeah my dad about still battles depression well guess what sometimes i battle my dad's uh that addictions of the flesh god's give me grace over that but like i told you i can still smell cigarette and my flesh wants to go get one that's just honest i've never done it since i became a christian i got victory but i'm tempted every time god didn't take that away from me god didn't take that out of me because he wants me to overcome praise god you must be the word god and be more than a conqueror hallelujah so maybe some of the things you've battled ah somebody battled that before and you can learn from that right that's true and then you apply that understanding you apply wisdom to your heart is that right church amaziah and uzziah both battled pride it was a family thing oh the church we're all going to have family things we've got to overcome that's true that's true now george let me say this we got to be real careful not to look down on people in the church because of things they battle true abraham the prophet and the son would you well they they're just a bunch of liars i mean think about the gospel that could have started that church abraham had 300 servants amen with families and they all look at well he's the father of faith but they lie all the time well guess what when you point that finger how many got point back at you true three fingers pointing back at you oh look at daddy abraham will look at you what have you struggled with this week all right see how we need a lot of gracious merciful savior lamb of god hallelujah prince i've been saying this the last few weeks with gideon and all these guys men of god that had victories with fail i've been saying that i've been praying this over and over god keep my sins private between you and me at the very least at the very least it's going to be with my family please don't let me sit amongst the church so it don't impact the church praise the lord is that your prayer too yes i hope it's your prayer yes you see church in the old testament they didn't have access back to the holy ghost so abraham well they're kind of struggle with lying now look some some families struggle with lust of the flesh yes so sexual battles some families will really struggle with that true lust of the eyes riches a bigger house some families are really going to struggle with that yeah but the bible says when you accept the word of god it will bring those temptations into subjection to the word of god amen hallelujah merciful savior your body has to obey your profession hallelujah so whether it's lying whether it's sexual lust whether it's pride or money or something like that you've got to say body and mind you're going to obey the word of god i command my life to praise the lord amen hallelujah oh blessed be the name i cast all these thoughts i cast on this generational curse i cast down these things that are passed out in jesus name and i will overcome i'll break the cycle i'll be the overcomer i'll be the conqueror amen if you help me if you help me and you keep your hands on my heart i'm overcome by the grace that's right you're going to fall on him and say jesus help me this week i'm really bad online this week or god help me i'm really bad and proud if he got better than other people or jesus really bad those sexual lustful thoughts or the riches of money you either fall on him or he'll fall on you hallelujah merciful savior prince of peace so it was brother adams pride that's when he battled the most sure remember that remember there's that joke i just saw this remember that joke my man would tell his children he said there's three great men in kentucky there's abraham lincoln who's the other one daniel moon or some some westerner like that he said and your father brother used to joke around and tell his kids that joke he said that he had a repentant spiritually is he greater i think so by the blood yeah that's right that's prophet as a church age messenger that's it no doubt about it right but is it right for us to say that no and tell our children that lydia no one's greater well there's three great people out of ohio john glenn is john glenn from ohio yeah astronaut yes john glenn lebron james and your dad that's a god what a lie oh what a lie it's a lie yeah but it says there's no great ones among us let god do the label rewards at the judgment scene of christ let christ put the names and the rewards on people then not not see he had to learn how to humble himself of course my dad you know my family was lust to the i mean i had so many uncles that were addicted to either alcohol at drunkers i'm just playing i remember my uncle tone tony anthony he would come over he had this huge belly he was skinny like me but huge pot belly he had suspenders on he would just sit down there with my dad smoke cigarettes and just drink alcohol for hours yeah and he eventually convinced my dad to divorce my mom and then my dad said as soon as he did that as soon as he agreed to divorce his mom tony never came back he was anointed of the devil to break up the marriage sure is that right sure yeah yeah i mean my uncles are all i only got one that's kind of like actually a health guy actually takes care of his body so what is that lust of the flesh addicted to alcohol addicted to cigarettes addicted to all these things so see we we all got a little lineage we got to overcome by god's grace we all got uh generational uh battles that we've got to overcome but how many are here to win the battle amen amen hallelujah you're gonna battle something so you might as well look at well god what am i gonna battle and god made me such a warrior saint make me so dedicated protect me let my mind be so focused on when this battle that i can glorify your name and you'll say well done good and faithful servant hallelujah amen amen your grace is sufficient thank you jesus i feel i praise the lord [Applause] [Music] [Applause] might as well realize it and get graced overcome it remember at that last time the longer you live it's going to come back pride is going to be the one that battles you sure yeah pride is going to be the one that battles you i'm better yeah i can do this you have mercy i don't know jesus i got this you know they say uh-oh you got nothing except a bad spirit that's what they got a bad thing yeah now second chronicles 25 verse 2. the overall ranking of this member there's three kinds of kings they did that which was right right but did this and then there was that did evil and messiah use eyes ads in the middle verse two he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but not with a perfect heart so he did right for a while but then within his life did the wrong thing now this is quite a story in verse 7 amaziah hearkens to a prophet he was going to go hire some men from northern israel to fight with him against the but then a prophet came with thus saith the lord in verse 7. but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to win with all the children of ephraim but if thou will go do it and be strong for the battle god shall make thee fall before the enemy for god has power to help and to cast down that beautiful god has power to help you and also cast down your enemy praise god and we know he hearkens and the are defeated but look at verse 14. now this is quite striking i i can only think of a few examples before coming to church i was thinking about this look at verse 14. now came to pass after the amazon has come from the slaughter of the that he brought the gods of the children of seer and set them up to be his gods and bowed himself before them and burned incense unto them that wherefore the anger of the lord was killed against a messiah and he said unto him a prophet said to him why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of their own hand out of their hand what a cr what a just unbelievable story first of all he obeys the prophet of the hour and got a great testimony the church said amen there's a lot of people that follow brothers ministry that had testimonies that don't mean you're saved no that don't mean you're an authority now you can tell everybody else what to do and your personal stories are better than the tapes and the bible life amen not better right because you got to watch what they're going to do after they got these testimonies it's just it's astonishing the very gods they defeated amaziah said well let's let's worship them yeah can you imagine god just gave you the greatest victory you could possibly ask for and then you want to go and worship other gods and the only one i could think of is that i know a person in a church god healed them they were walking in a cane and then after that there was some can i just say like this there was some gossiping in the church some brothers didn't make it right with he and his wife they ended up leaving the church and he he could hardly walk he had a cane he was in his 30s god i was at the service he was supernaturally healed and he just threw the pain away that later that week and the the military doctors were just baffled how could this happen it was a great testimony but after some gossiping happened and some backbiting or something i don't know all the details they refuse to go back to church people refuse to repent and the last time i talked to myself i talked to him on the thing on the text on facebook he said brother why aren't you in the house of god he said well i've lost my jobs and and i got to go work at a carnival and so i can't go to church on sundays you know those carnivals they used to have before copenhagen remember all those things before copenhagen and i thought how sad i thought this is the perfect example god heals the man so he can walk but he won't take any other job if i was in that place i would just go down to mcdonald's if i'd have a job i'd go down to mcdonald's and say hire me i just want to work i don't want to waste any days that's what i did now i said god gave me a job at the grocery store bagging groceries right after college i went back for a job and i got one and then the next day god gave me a better one then next week god gave me a better one amen today amen praise the lord but it's the only one i can think of god heals you so you can walk and you refuse let me say this you refuse to humble yourself and go to that brother and make it right and so because of that bitterness spirit it keeps you out of church and now let me say like this he's bowing down and worshipping the god of money saying oh i can't go to god's house because god's people now spiritually he's bowing down and say i got to make money he could go to any other church he could went to the baptist he could have made it to the lutheran he went to the medical school any other church but instead they're bowing down worshipping the gods of the enemy that they were delivered from he was delivered from the ability where you couldn't even walk without a cane but because of sin you go right back to that isn't that something true that's why divine healing is not the major no healing is the major yeah if his soul would have gotten healed he never released the word of god amen amen surely god healed my man you can't wait till they open those doors for church service to get in here and worship your god with god's children hallelujah amen god raised him up defeated his enemies and he went right back and worshiped the gods of this world let's be careful let's not shake our heads like well i could never do that that's the same thing use i said it's the same thing he thought i'll never do that if god takes his hand away you never know what you oh lord jesus merciful well i obey the prophet i i god did a miracle in my life i don't doubt that one day right but what are you doing right now to show god your appreciation [Music] what are you worshiping right now where are you getting your advice from right now the word of god or somebody else see see after we have to make sure every time we get something is from the lord yeah we have to make sure we're being led by the holy spirit true praise god true that's why when i was on facebook i used to joke and say be careful who you follow right well i'm following this person i'm following you you better be careful you're following yeah they might lead you to hell that's true [Music] then in chapter 26 now he lived a mediocre life he died in sin remember you died for each other numerous times i believe he was the old testament church and messenger brother right and i've got the receipts to prove i've got the questions they received i got the scriptures to prove it i think lebron said the old testament had uh messengers from solomon to john the baptist okay there's just a couple quotes that i preached on that last year anyways this man built and restored israel he built inventions he had all these engines he invented to yeah protect israel you know i beated all these foes for 50 plus years he defeated that right it's true i haven't been preaching 20 years i'm getting close though i'm at 18. this guy preached hard uh reigned over sin for 50 plus years yeah but then at the end of his life he says i'm going to be something that i'm not i just want to experience what is it like to pray in the presence of god in the holy place i've got to experience that i've never got to go to the holy place i've just got to go in there oh now can you imagine this church eighty men one two three four five six three three two two okay we got twenty here okay so take this church multiply times four that's all the people that tried to stop using from going there stop stop can you imagine 80 people don't do it you you're lifted up in pride don't do it and not the bible we didn't read it but the bible said each one of these cases it was pride that lifted them up because i knew the prophet because i obeyed the prophet because i've done so many great things i can do whatever i want that's a lie you can't do that you should all do what god calls you to do jesus that's right and 80 believers couldn't keep this man from satisfying his pride church here's how you know that you got pride when someone tries to correct you or god tries to correct you you get mad yeah that's it they both got mad that's why watch when people blow up church oh yeah watch when they lose their cool oh yeah just got event oh yeah now we all got to talk to people right we all need counseling but i'm talking about blowing up and angry and saying things harsh things you ought not to say that's going a little too far yeah that's a spirit doing that yeah there is that's right and he got mad and the bible said when he was in there he finally looked he finally got to do what he wanted church also was shaking like an incense thing you know and offering prayers at the author of incense i mean it was i mean it was glorious don't get wrong but it was it wasn't his calling right burning the fire saying the prayers while he's in there he sees he gets leprosy and i can't do oh and he runs out all because of pride his life ends in disgrace all because of pride so this is a good example of god taking his hand off somebody because he took his eyes off god because the bible says as long as he saw the lord god made him prosper yeah so he got to the spot after 50 years i don't need to go down to the altar anymore i don't need to go up for prayer for brother jesse tomorrow i have to read my bible i don't do this anymore i got it all figured out i know what i can do i know i know the message oh no i've obeyed the prophet i've got testimonies a mile long lydia i can tell you because all those were god's victories have mercy yes he thought they were his righteousness lamb of god people could not convince you that he was private they couldn't convince him to stop before you wreck your testimony this is what pride does church pride exalts our ways above god's ways i was looking at actually that scripture yeah and if you go to the previous chapter 25 about amazing verse 19. thou sayest low thou hast smit in the and thine heart lifted the up to boast okay now look he's msi took credit i beat the and it wasn't even him i mean the very least he said it was the problem of god at the very least but now he's taking credit it was me that beat him oh it was god giving you the word through the prophet and you just obeyed right i just humbled myself one time but it got to the spot where i did this oh i caused myself this great victory that's right because of that you'll lose everything and he did he lost his life my goodness now brother take usia church and this is what i've been listening to the last few weeks but listen to uh this is the one from november 14 63. okay the same one i read earlier but abram takes using he says the the the equivalent today is a minister building their own kingdom with the false security [Music] that's right just because we're small doesn't mean i i i can uh i don't pay attention to this because you know a preacher can build a kingdom with a small church or the big church it don't matter right true i'm not just saying just oh if you have a big church you can build a kingdom no you can build a kingdom here true it's a small one though oh yeah right so i've got to be careful too i've got to examine myself too just like you have to examine yourself yeah now he says first because i was raised in a godly home as parents now which dad was serving the lord now uzziah's kingdom was so great it was next to solomon's i believe it's anointed next to solomon's how god blessed him this was a great influence upon upon the young prophet isaiah who was at the temple of the time or in the land and how he was seen and how god would bless a man that taken the right stand and done the right thing and right motive and right objective and he done right and uzziah held his standard he was a great influence as i've said to isaiah the prophet then uzziah made the fatal mistake just like many other people does when he got felt secured felt that he had just the whole thing in his hand he got lifted up in his spirit he got lifted up to pride now there is a real example for us all amen everybody say all ready oh that means me you a good example for us all is when god blesses you how many of god blessed out there you have to raise your hands god's blessed me how many ever feel secure i've got to be careful with that i'm securing god's love praise god i'm securing the blood of jesus christ praise god glory but he got the wrong kind of security yes and he got lifted up and this is an example when you feel secure you feel like god's blessed you so much so you are you know but no nothing can bring you down church many times i pray that this is my prayer clause i'm sure you do do i just pray god keep me from falling god give me strength today keep me obeying your word help me to be humble help me to be faithful just keep keeping me awake [Music] help me lord jesus you know that's been the trouble what's been the trouble pride's been the trouble i'm speaking to christians and ministers i want to be honest about these things and just that's where many ministers even make a mistake we've heard so many times about the ministers the acts they do with the things some of them may be doing things that they should not do i think sometimes they're them our good man a wonderful christian that's been used to the lord so see a preacher that's been used of god he's got testimonies just like a messiah just like usia but then finally they get a little kingdom built around them or a lot of influence many people attend their meetings okay so okay now i can see until they get careless what they say behind the pulpit and they get kind of lifted up the people applaud them let's see church that's right i never want you to clap for me if you enjoy something don't you clap for jesus but see a prideful preacher will start thinking oh clapping me that's i i must have something to do with this it's because of me they're clapping for me now we like we like to clap for your birthdays but we're not worshiping you right he says we really shouldn't do that clap for preachers applaud preachers remember we're just all there's no big people among us we're all just god's children you see if god made some of us one thing and some another why he made me the finger and i and so forth well we got to appreciate each other and then not sorry not try to feel good hey i've got to find a way to tell malcolm i appreciate all your piano playing i appreciate your organ i appreciate your song little brother it's such a blessing but yet at the same time but don't get lifted up true you with me well jose i appreciate your testimonies and send those prayer claws i appreciate that pray so long but i'm not going to exalt you stay humble amen praise long but to make sure we know who we're clapping for it's true hallelujah amen we have to make sure we know who we're thinking blessed be the lord so i gotta quote my man said don't you ever thank any man because all this grace goes on jesus christ now we can say well thank you brother thank you sister but we got to say it with humility we got to say well all the real the real things the real glory that goes to jesus because we're all connected to one god the lamb of god and we all come off one tree yeah now we find that many times ministers gets to feel a little secure and they keep leading out and the first thing you know they'll do things they should not see they just start with something small oh god didn't strike me dead like i said i want it oh i didn't feel lightened maybe i know a little further god doesn't oh god i didn't god didn't kill me there maybe i could try this and pretty soon you zaya tried all these things now look it's in progress now he thinks well i can just go and i can be a priest i've defeated every i've defeated every enemy there ever was i'm undefeated and see church it's just not one time it's just it's a sin that's a sin progression you sin one time goes a little further it goes a little further see that's why we gotta repent after the first time preparing for the first time again i'm reading this quote again bill graham says sometimes great guys get together and you hear them say great so and so great so-and-so don't never do that there's no great ones among us no i like this though i'm just gonna read this for my sake just encourage me okay i don't care if you're a pastor of church that's got five people there glory thank you lord that don't make you little that makes you a glory i'm a brother hallelujah thank god okay now i'm encouraged all right now let's go notice god himself come down from ivory palaces to glory to become one of us now who's the big one see we all got to get the perspective who's the bigger one oh i got a bigger church i got a bigger youtube following i've got bigger than all this no there's one way higher above that man the one who came down from the ivory tower not to be in the form of a priest but a servant washed the very clay created the feet of the apostles now can these preachers wash the feet they created can i wash feet i haven't created enough i could take sand off the beach man okay we did that a couple times we literally we can take a bucket of sand and try to make it look like some feet you know try to wash it but those aren't real feet i'd be deceiving myself who's the great one the one who can make the feet make the feet walk give life to the feet and then wash them amen amen that's a great man hallelujah yes it is so be very careful don't don't say i got a great pastor no you just say god is saying god has kept his hand on my pastor yeah and i'll say the same thing about you praise god god has kept his hands on the brothers in the church praise the lord god has protected our sisters in the church they've been able to stand all these battles praise the lord but i shouldn't say i've got a great song leader although i appreciate our song peter i've got great musicians i shouldn't say that i should say thank you lord i appreciate our song musicians they've got gifts and talents now if i said that you have to help me and repent you have to help remind me i have to go back and dance honestly i've said that i gotta learn i gotta learn i have to learn the very things i'm preaching i gotta learn myself sure right you don't practice what you preach if you don't practice what you profess what is it it's vanity very bad now who's the great one jesus is the great one yes he is i'm trying to get somewhere but it's going good praise god going good look at brother humility and then it's also his plea for us to be humble now this one this is what i told you about we want to be gems in the crown of jesus christ don't you we won't i'm sorry we don't want never put a man in it you forget anything about me or you're saying well brother justin he just said that to be humble let's keep reading the quote i'm your brother sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth and i ain't saying that to be humble [Laughter] hallelujah hallelujah amen now remember this is after he told all the stories about the visions about the church age i'm sorry the seven seals i remember there were seven visions about the church ages i was at seven seasons i keep fixing up there's some visions about the church there's the seven seals that he makes it up he says there are nothing nothing in me not one something at all but by the grace of god god has let my poor dimming eyes look beyond the curtain of time so look how brother man placed it a man that battled a critical spirit but he could still humble himself after preaching the seven seals and the revelations contained which he did not plagiarize i proved that on the on the youtube and you can watch it on the podcast he said we never want to put a man in it and give them the credit he says it's all jesus christ amen hallelujah he said i ain't saying that to be humble that's true he says that's facts hey man hey man that's sex hey man church where's this kind of humility it should be in the bride yeah but i showed you i know all bright people are bright no not all bright people are humbling themselves some of them are exalting themselves i don't think so what about this amen brother brandon said he's sitting every day and so did paul but i said we are tempted all of us are tempted all of a sin there's none without sin every day we sin paul said he had to die daily so brother used that scripture to see it so to show paul sinned every day she had to die to die out to sin every day sure and if we say we sin and have no sin rather then we make god a lie and we could not do that so we sin daily and it's grace god's grace this satan yeah and as we confess our wrongs god is just to forgive them and your confession i love this as long as it holds good your salvation is perfect same as it is in divine healing it's your personal faith in a resurrected lord jesus [Applause] hallelujah you're never going to get to a spot where you're not tempted you're never going to get to a spot where you don't sin but you've got to keep confessing the sins and giving god all the praise amen next year what was that next week yeah next year he said we're perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin on us are you above temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet you are perfected because we are in him hallelujah that's what the bible says and god can no more judge us than nothing could it be righteous he's already judged us in him when he judge christ he judged me judge you and he can't judge me again because he took my judgment if i've been redeemed amen hallelujah amen he can't judge me again because christ took my judgment for me hallelujah amen and i got a ticket you know what his ticket is i'll get to you later his ticket is the bible his scriptures i got a ticket to show that i'm redeemed my watch from uh the pawn shop that somebody tried to take it back in the pawn shop once when i've got a ticket i have redeemed it in other words i got god's receipt hallelujah and the devil would try to put punishment on me i've got a ticket that shows i've been redeemed no more judgment what is my ticket it's john chapter 5 he that hears my words and believes on him has eternal life and shall never come to judgment but he's passed from death into life that's my ticket he ain't the promise amen amen see every day saying come here and say you're not worthy you sinned i said of course i did i never said i did it devil but i told jesus i was sorry and here i've got a ticket for you devil oh god 5 28. i've passed from death unto life i'm already perfected i'm already beloved [Applause] [Applause] because he already took my judgment for me i can't be judged i can't go to hell jesus already did it for me amen yes i'll fall every day yes i'll be tempted every day yes i will sin every single day but i've got a cleaner i've got i've got a lawyer to pardon me before the judge wonderful savior amen the ramp says i have so much holiness i can present to god is that what you're saying oh wait let me know what my glasses get here yeah looks like i need a new prescription i have no holiness to present to you wow what i'm trusting in is oh his grace yes and i have it in my heart blessed be the name of the lord i'm unmerited nothing i can do deserve it i love how he makes up new words and new phrases these do not this is not appropriate grammar no but he's just talking to god like he's just like he's god's friend amen like abraham was a friend of god but by grace he called me and invited me to come and i looked to him and he took the desire from me i make thousands of mistakes in a month i've read this one before read again in each year surely i do when i see i'm wrong i say god it didn't mean to do it you know my heart i didn't mean to do that i was tracking that i didn't mean to do it you forgive me lord amen if i don't wrong to my brother i say brother forgive me i didn't mean to do that certainly god knows my heart oh there you are there's the blood sacrifice oh glory each time you say you're sorry each time you confess your sin you're calling on the blood sacrifice the blood sacrifice of jesus christ you're getting help from heaven you are you're uh you're tapping into the benefit of the blood sacrifice amen amen there's there's the where's the part of the gospel and you saying forgive me yeah where's the part of the gospel and you saying please forgive me i sinned against you there's the power of the gospel we all want miracles we all want to see the people healed and saved don't we yeah but quarterback says where's the miracle somebody that can humble himself and say i'm sorry amen that the holy church moves on and doesn't get stopped in one spot of sin or root of bitterness like aiken right they can move on to ai they can move on to more victories not because something you've done or me done it's something you had nothing to do with there is the atonement the church said amen remember the atonement makes you one at one it makes you one with god it appeases god's anger against us yes it is the blood of jesus christ takes away the propituation it's the wrath taker it takes away all the the guilt and thank you it takes it away because jesus took it for us thank you that's the atonement and that church is the power of the gospel well i want to hear some power of the gospel at church you totally did you heard two hours of it amen yeah sorry so long but i just can't stop i don't know why i just haven't actually been paying attention to god amen that's the power of the gospel amen someone who can humble himself yes it's true and follow god's will and seek after god and not get prideful lift it up and say i don't need to seek god for this i know how to handle this trying to close so again whether i'm starting a pastor in 1933 i think if i'm not mistaken he started passing at 24. i started passing 25. i love the similarities we all want to be like god's servants in humility if he died in 1965 that's 32 years if he just did one sin a day just once in a day if he just said you should have thought that god forgive me oh shouldn't have stole that i should have lied to the irs like you did that one day that would be 11 times now if like he said if he said i send thousands of mistakes a year and we'll take the low thousands which is 2 000. that is 64 000 pounds that he had look look i said like this 64 times had to fall on the on the stone amen amen 64 000 times wow you and i can't even understand that no you can't understand 11 000. what does that number really look like maybe the hairs are in our heads i think maybe 12 000. someone's got more hair than others some of our brothers lose our hair good picture i can picture that many pairs but sixty four thousand sixty four thousand times and church i love this god is so faithful each time brother man when viola said say forgive me jesus would no doubt in heaven speak back you're forgiven praise the lord now peter got upset when jesus said you've got to forgive him seven times he was like how about seven seven times and jesus like no 70 times seven yeah four hundred ninety well i was like well who then can be saved are you this is impossible true jesus like just watch me peter just watch me i'm the virgin born son of god watch me take every punishment on that causation and i can forgive not just a 490 but 64 000 multiply that times all these believers down to the age think of how many times these these believers confess i'm sorry forgive me and each time jesus says you're forgiven i forgive you and it ain't just something he's saying he actually means it he actually gets rid of your guilt he sent your shame away he actually doesn't write down your sin because there's no condemnation and heaven doesn't record your sins amen [Applause] and yet just that just that year god forgave you 11 000. 679 more times but we'll hold one thing against the preacher right that's true you forgot to buy tissues for the church you're right ah i forgot to get water for the church and ran out are you gonna hold one thing against that sister or that brother but look how look how quick and merciful christ is amen forgive me you confess it i forgive you that's a lot of sins that's how these things happen you talk about how you'll raise the holy spirit that's why i can stand in the whole world and say has the word ever failed they'll say the lord god promised me back there as a kid that's the reason say aren't you afraid of failing he says i'm never i'm always a failure so now you see my brother said yeah this is why i promise to say i'm always affair if i don't say what the lord says i'm going to fail yeah the only reason they'll say the lord fails is because i obey him i'm sorry the only reason i said the lord never fails is because i obey it but if i did it on my own i'd always be a failure yeah amen remember the other quote i'm nothing but he said that remember i'm nothing you forget anything about me i ain't saying that i'm not fit to live no church if we saw how many times we sinned in a year we would also say i'm not fit to live because i've said now church let's be honest that's just one sin a day yeah how many ever had a bad day how many you ever had a bad week [Music] you didn't read your bible like you got to work kind like you ought to right you got a really mean spirit all week why not how many would you have thirteen thousand fifteen thousand twenty thousand yeah that's why brother brown says i am not fit to live i'm always a failure because i know the human side but also these are people that are born again but we've talked about that we're scoring again man sure the soul never sins but the mind and body do every day [Music] no wonder the bible says god is abundant in mercies yeah thank you father jesus no no wonder the bible says he's long suffering yeah thank you lord thank you god that would be my best year if it was just that as you get older you have to battle pride and more and more as you get older right brother uh jose and brother ray you have to battle pride just get over it that's why a man that's good that's at that point was 54. he could say i'm not even fit to live i'm a fan i'm always a failure but god never fails amen that's true overcoming the sin of pride remember brother i was so humble they said brother man can you prove you're over there in heaven he said no i cannot prove it god could use me for a tool of something else and use you the same way see there it is god can take his hand off you oh lord but he said i believe by faith i'm saved not by knowledge i'm saved by faith that's the way you're saved that's the way we're all saved yeah amen let me see what i got here i'm close with this let's stand our feet church when we increase our humility you know i'm preaching so hard on pride so i can really get everyone to be humble and me too need to because we all need it the whole point of this is to say when we're humble we will serve others when more prideful we only serve ourselves that's true i'll say it again when we're prideful we only live for me right but when we're humble we live for other people that's right it's true true and did you know i'm sorry and let me remind you because i know i've preached this before the whole secret to christianity is increasing your service to god tells us that's the whole secret the church the whole secret is when the devil says slow down you're too tired earlier last night but i feel better sure i didn't quit coming to church just because i was tired yesterday i just made sure i got to bed early the whole secret is humbling yourself brother graham says and then as you get older not decreasing your service to god but humbling yourself and increasing your service towards god amen this is speaking spoken of authoritarian church age the darkest age bill abraham said in this age the darkest of all ages yet they say they would see the darkness of all ages well we'll talk about that last week the believers serve jesus even more right what a lesson that is there's no ceasing of this gracious service of love unto the lord but rather an increasing of it amen that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our servants for them that's all the devil wants is for you to stop serving other people and just live for you yeah that's all he wants that's right i can just get him living or get her just live for yourself that's all he wants i've got him now now the rest of the body's gonna suffer because i got him yeah he just wants one part of the body selfish broken down not connected to the rest of the part of the body that's just what satan wants i could get them focused on themselves but no brother man says the holy spirit will come in you know say devil you're going to try to cut down my service i'm going to increase it for the glory of god amen i'm going to find more ways we're going to say like this i'm going to find different ways to serve god and his people amen what is our reply to satan satan i'm going to increase my service to god and his people when the faints are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory can we shout out a victory here by god [Applause] satan wants to weaken the church he wants to weaken the nations but you've got to increase your strength through humility through service to god i will serve god's i won't back up all my service to god i'll increase my services to god how many want to do that like amen amen we've got our family trials we got to battle our family lord jesus i don't like mine so much i'm sure you don't like yours either but we're more than conquerors through the blood of jesus christ where's the gospel it's saying brother sister forgive me i sin against you forgive me that's the power of the gospel the power of the blood of jesus christ to redeem us from let's pray together heavenly father i preached a long time where i hope lord that we've met the long and the deep needs of the people of god today i'm just trying to follow your leadership lord you place these thoughts on my heart dear god your word's been preached your word has lied there's no great ones among us we appreciate one another but there's no great ones here lord you're the only great one the one who created this uh the matter that could build this little church one that created lord uh vocal cords and the ability to sing and lift our hands and praise the lord you put life in our feet you put life in our hands oh god a mind that's a sound mind lord to think and to feel and taste and touch the lord and hear all these things we're so grateful lord god for all you've done you're the great one lord none of us are fit to live no our best year would be eleven thousand six hundred eighty sins that'd be our best year and each time you're faithful you say i forgive you brother jesse i forgive you my son i forgive you my daughter almost 12 000 times lord this is a love that we have a hard time comprehending lord [Music] and yet we rejoice in it lord god because it is great love it is love that's promised to us and you gave us a ticket in the bible that we can put in the devil's face and say i am forgiven hallelujah i am as long as i confess it i am forgiven i am perfected i'm complete in the might of god god sees me as a finished product hallelujah and he forgives my sins here in time and space because i confess it [Music] hallelujah jesus each person feel lord our great need for you thank you for putting your hand in protection honestly thank you for the power of the gospel that makes us go our sister and say forgive me i've done wrong lord you forgive me if i do anything wrong to the church lord i don't

continue to deal with us lord god yes lord lord you said you would chasten every son you discourage every sin lord the way we want to do it is we want to fall on you dear god we want to fall on you please don't ever take your hand of mercy off praise god we would bring such reproach upon the message upon the gospel lord we fall on you today lord forgive our sins god and lord lead us god is the repent of anything we've wronged anyone on your jesus we're god in the blood of christ we're humbling ourselves here today are you minister to each and every person here lord especially with our family traits and our genealogies these generational curses and things that come down in jesus name god made each person get the victory hallelujah may each person seek your face overcome life or pride or lust whatever it be dear god in jesus [Music] he's failed to name the victory over the generational curses and the strands that remain in our bodies and our minds we know you're faithful we know you'll do it dear god and increase our service to our church family i pray and all these things in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah desire's prayer you're welcome to come i'll be happy to pray
