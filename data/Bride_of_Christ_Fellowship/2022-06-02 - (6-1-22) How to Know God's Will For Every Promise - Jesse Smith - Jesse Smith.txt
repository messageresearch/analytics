me sunday after the service i thought i'll just preach a sermon on that by god's grace i just want to call it just simply how to know god's will for any promise so look at that hot enough i know god's will for any promise i don't know brother amen told you that but he and i were talking about that i don't know if he talked about it i just thought that's a great question and i thought it'd be good to review it uh let's see i'm gonna text up here is it on you guys turn on the live stream jeremiah 29 amen hallelujah good stuff praise god all right glory so how to know god's will for any promise any promise uh we'll just look at a couple scriptures here i guess we'll just read three briefly uh let's read uh jeremiah 29 now 11 verse 11 is one of the most beautiful scriptures some people think of the whole bible so i'll read that for i know the thoughts that i think toward you say the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you unexpected and how many weren't expecting them this is spoken to israel when they're in babylon jeremiah wrote the letter it was taken to babylon israel is out of the promised land and god says i have thoughts of peace for you even though you're you're slaves and captives in another nation i have thoughts of peace for you i'm going to give you an expected end in other words you can know what to expect praise god praise the lord verse 12 let's read 12 and 13 together one two three then shall he call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall send thee and find me when he shall search for me with all your heart amen i look at verse 14 and i'll be found of you save the lord so how is how are they going to find the will of god they've got to seek god's will god tells them i have all these thoughts i have all the expected ends but they've got to do a human element they've got to seek god now doesn't this line up with what jesus said you must love god with all your heart soul mind and strength what's the greatest commandment to love god so what is the greatest expression of love of god seeking god's will for your life with all that you have all your strength all your time all your being you'll find that as the opportunity that's the area where you find the will of god praise god let's have one more word of prayer here for any promise of god heavenly father we just thank you lord for your word tonight god we read your word and father we know it's true it's faithful lord god and just have you we had this good question from our brother we just want to answer the lord god as i've thought i've meditated on these three days lord god i just want you to speak to us help us lord god and lord jesus we just made we give the holy spirit lord god for the holy spirit is the anointing there's the the joy of the lord is our reign the anointing breaks the yokes lord god hallelujah breaks any addictions lord or any uh any chains lord depression or unbelief lord as we saw lord it breaks all those feathers in jesus name we pray oh god let your anointing be upon us here tonight and we'll give you all the praise all the glory and honor in jesus christ's name said amen amen god bless you and see the praise god i just want to call it how to know god's will for any promise that we have some uh slides here male kind of sure about god's grace so brother amen and i were talking and i just thought well as a pastor i just i thought we'll be good for our people to go back over that i thought brother amen's got that question sometimes i've had questions about that sure and i thought well i think i'll just preach that uh just you know today by god's grace also i just want to tell you you know we had such a wonderful time in the point thank you for the sacrifices everybody made to go it was really wonderful okay the power's out so i gotta put new batteries in but um this one tell you know a lot of people were blessed by the services and by the specials they really enjoyed those thank you for doing all that and uh you know i think you know there's many highlights you know just being around the saints you know my wife asked me what was the best part of the weekend i said well everything but as i drove back and i meditated on things uh after the sunday service before we went to the graduation party i just had something just a little unexpected you know my mother-in-law came up to me and saints she sat through my three-hour sermon on priests three hours on saturday night two hours or two and a half on sunday she came up after me after the service on sunday and she said uh jesse i just want to tell you i really love hearing to come hearing you preach and he said you said the law i shared so many things that i had questions about blessed god and she started crying praise god praise the lord i never thought i'd see that when we first come in the message she was totally against us she said you guys are nicole all these things and now she comes to the services we listen to her son-in-law who acts crazy he looks like he's crazy fighting bees and everything like that swat knowing everything spitting and running and jumping and i should come and shall weep at the word of god wonderful it took 20 years but was it worth the church amen i better believe it's worth it so i'll tell you god is doing something you know the bible said don't despise the day of small things amen this is not the mission the missionary age was the day where the most number of souls would be saved the other man told us that it was the age of the open door the man said now though the door is closing when we see these people come in and we see their hearts softening we got to rejoice in that sure we need to be thankful yes sir to be encouraged so brother austin you know you wait 20 years to selena laura terry's you've been wait 20 years wait 20 years for your loved ones we just stood there showing love and you know what my mother-in-law's been to other families houses and she comes back from our house saying your family is different that's the holy spirit goes to all the families of god she needs our house brother there's a different spirit there praise god you don't ask for it she just tells us glory to god and now she's coming to church crying good day i think that's the highlight sure amen the lord so i just thought i'd share that you know just to encourage your church i've been preaching since 2004 you know so 18 years i've been preaching and i told my wife this i thought my mother would come and hear me preach more than my mother-in-law because my mom was more involved in church but look who god is bringing here at this time now it's all the time and season that's right but the one we thought maybe wouldn't wouldn't even like it now is enjoying it she was smiling all throughout the service i saw her holding where's jenna she's probably sleeping i always put him to sleep you know that's that's just an encouragement yes it is it's the greatest miracle yes it is it's a repentant heart so we'll look and see you know we'll watch stephanie you know watch my mother-in-law and just just keep loving keep manifesting the word god has a time and season for everything so we we want to find how to know uh god's will for any promise i want to go quickly to matthew seven we'll just read some scriptures here let me set a timer uh i don't have work tomorrow but i want to get exactly okay well a couple you have one tomorrow but the kids don't have school tomorrow that's a nice part but we're going to honor the people working tomorrow but let me know sorry i promise i'm not going to freeze three hours like friday or saturday okay i'll try not to try not to eclipse that there's such a good anointing there and the brothers came out i couldn't believe it was three hours they said it seemed like it was uh it seemed like it went so fast i hope that's how it was i hope that's how it works matthew 7 7-8 but cam said that saturday night service was just discerning a lot of the pride problems he's seen in the church he preached on the pride of life you know and uh sarah he said that just discerned so many problems people were having really pride always manifested in contention right and division and so he said that sermon spoke to numerous situations so hopefully that will strengthen the church it'll bring the church to a higher place in god with humility praise god god help us to be humble on god's grace yeah jesus says in matthew 7 7 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you notice jesus gives three different uh kind of examples of how you can seek god to know god's will for any promise first you can ask in prayer right right then you can seek what would you seek well you would seek the word of god you could seek through prayer uh there's different ways to seek god's will and then knock okay so actively actively engage you know approaching god knock and god says it will be open to you did he say wait a year and there or did he say six months or did he say five years in there no he just puts it as a general thing we don't know how long it's going to be just like he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he didn't say when they'd recover he just said they shall recover praise god so we get the same idea here it's it's in god's time it's in god's season right but he says if we do ask we shall receive now we also know remember from hebrews 11 there's some that went uh down in the grave many of the old testament states died not inheriting certain promises like abraham didn't see the fullness of what his seed would become he didn't see the two million right like like that came out of egypt he didn't see that praise god but he was promised your seed will be like the stars of heaven amen but he saw a partial manifestation of it right like we would say the whole mountain wasn't moved right the whole the whole prayer wasn't answered but it was partially answered okay so we want to uh brother ram tells us you know in the sermon court trial you haven't listened that lately i haven't either but it just kind of comes to my mind the man tells us that you know there's lots of skeptics that will go on trial against god and one of them is mr impatient yeah right they'll argue and say well god said but it hasn't happened yet but the counter to that the defense is god never said when right right unless he did tell you when like like he told uh he told israel you'll be back here in 70 years well then you know right but if he doesn't tell you the time you just got to trust him you've just got to be patient you got to have confidence in god you have to believe god's word you have to manifest some abrahamic faith amen you gotta you gotta show that you're really the seed of abraham amen and hear the word of god believe it and rest upon it praise god and the other one is revelation 1 verse 10. this is of course overran fixes up in the church eight book and makes a great deal of this verse i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet so notice he gets in the holy spirit and then he hears the voice and then it begins speaking to him i am alpha and omega and brother and tell us we'll get to this later but brother says that's the key to being a christian is getting in the spirit now we know there's a couple different keys or secrets right the one we went over the other secret a few weeks ago the secret is when the devil says don't don't serve god as much you serve more right when the devil says stop serving god or decrease your service you say i'll do more for god before you try to do a word of god get in the spirit first amen that's another secret praise god it's another way to make sure you please god before you ask god anything or before you try to manifest the a promise of god or before you try to act upon anything first get under the anointing of the holy spirit amen brother i said go through get in the spirit first then go through the acts right and he gives numerous examples like uh acts 2 38 he says if you really repent in acts 2 38 he said and go get in the spirit of repentance he said you'll get the holy ghost eventually but some people just hear they know it's a revelation they can see lord jesus christ fathers and holy ghosts we've seen hundreds of them or maybe scores of them they get baptized but then they go back out in the world right they go back out to denominations and never they never got the spirit of repenting and really uh separating themselves from the dead works the bible says remember the first doctrine of being a christian is repentance from dead works leaving all dead work in other words you want all your works to be holy you want your hands to do holy things you don't want to do anything wrong you want to be like jesus you want to do us right amen the first word is to repent from all dead works according to hebrews six verses one two three that's the i just put that youtube video out this week so it's kind of fresh on my mind amen that's it that's right and there's six of those foundational doctrines the first one is repentance from dead works that's why denominations never get to really sanctification they never really repent from all their dead works now you and i should right you and i do by the grace of god all right now in 2016 i taught a little message on divine healing and how to approach it so i'm going to just briefly review that and then come back to these other thoughts that we have so just bear with me here as i switch over to slide 31 now the first thing uh program tells us is to confess all sins and of course this is the bible telling us this as well not just about the brahman uh brother graham everything that everything that we believe from him comes from the bible praise god the bible says now i'm sorry for all the caps i know it's hard to read but this is from like uh six years ago if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward god so see church this is why sometimes we're not confident when we're hearing them preaching we're not confident when we're praying it's because we're not not believing the word of god right or we know there's some be setting sin in our lives and so because we know that's there we know we haven't dealt with it or we haven't taken care of the situation we don't really have confidence in god church before we even before we even listen to the sermon we should repent of our sins that should give us confidence amen amen praise god all right now got to pull on the word here church tonight got a pawn in the word see that's why if we're lacking confidence it's because satan has weakened us right and so the way to overcome satan is to use the word of god amen [Music] he's not a dumb devil he's not a stupid devil he's so very wise very smart he tricks you every day that's right if he's dumb and he tricks you then what does that make you right church now of course he's done compared to god but we don't name call like that even michael the archangel wouldn't do that but we're talking about having confidence the way we can have confidence is to believe god's word take god at his word amen and then church whatever you ask you receive of him because we keep his commands and do those things that are pleasing in his sight and the church said it didn't say when you receive them it just said you're going to receive them amen if you keep confidence in god's word amen if we can be confident that god backs up what he says amen that god's a miracle working god he's a waymaker a promise keeper all these things that god cares about our desires if we believe these things and keep confident the bible says if we ask them and we keep and we obey the word of god we shall receive them amen amen we've received some lately i'm just going to rehearse lately the devil kind of whispers in my ear sometimes and said god is doing nothing in your church i say you liar get behind me satan amen hallelujah god do something mother-in-law's life i just seen that amen gotta do something in stephanie's life hopefully she's listening for i don't know how old your mom is but 50 or 60 or whatever she is for all those years she's been against church but all of a sudden when austin come back and lena come back the holy spirit moved on her heart she started weeping and said i've got to get back to church and where did god send her he said her to us he could have sent her anywhere we would have been rejoicing as long as it was a good church but god sent her here god is moving he's turning hearts of stone to hearts of flesh amen amen hallelujah amen true jose's heart the doctor said it was an absolute miracle he's alive did you know austin that whole day when when jose jose was sick all day saturday the heart the heart was hurting him all day saturday did you know that he was laying in bed do you know that whole day austin's heart was hurting him when you guys went to the zoo was that right was it the zoo so at the same time jose was laying in bed and he laid there for 18 hours with a heart attack 18 hours until he finally went to the er i'm sorry it's friday it's friday all day friday late there i'm sorry it's all friday night sorry all friday night into saturday morning he finally went there saturday morning as soon as he got there at the er nobody was there that hardly ever happens every walk in the er usually it's packed now the last time i took who who did i take jenner yeah jen and it was totally empty that was god's blessing to us but uh jose got the same thing as soon as he walked in there it was right in there they got right to the medic it's in right and they took that thing he said put it through the vein and they broke up that little clot in his heart i mean it's amazing technology they got anyways the whole time he was hurting austin was hurting and then he texts the brothers can you pray and brother austin prayed for him amen brother amen prayed for him i prayed for him i'm sure many of you others i just went in the prayer closet and had a little prayer for him and as soon as i get there he said just minutes before i got there on a sunday morning before church he said all the pain went away praise god just our prayers the doctor looked at him said it's a miracle that you're still here amen i don't know you know we can't overlook these things amen amen god is gracious your prayers so it's like god gave austin a burden to be able to pray for him because he was going through the heart pain as well see god works on both ends and so austin would have had a greater and he probably did have a greater burden of prey than maybe than other some of us because he was actually suffering along with it how about haven't been praying for her friends to be saved for years and one of them just got baptized two weeks ago hallelujah and now she's texting lydia to try to be friends olivia keep it up lily you just stay honor okay that's another thing for you to remember but you're 17 you got a good memory stay honored to show her the love of god hating you keep showing your love of god see years of prayers years of prayers amen amen hallelujah god doesn't always work overnight god wants us to be strong in faith giving god glory amen amen whether we see anything or not he wants us to be soldiers he wants us to be men and women of vision let's see the word of god and know that if god's word is true it will come to pass true sister lina come up here for a few weeks ago for her sister who was being uh mistreated badly and she prayed for deliverance we were both weeping and crying remember that sister meena weeping and crying was within two days that person was removed out of her life amen hallelujah and it was almost a life or death situation it was almost that bad and look how look how the holy ghost moves amen it's god's simplicity amen hallelujah so many examples these just these are just the recent ones just the recent ones remember that uh but austin uh i'll tell you guys been moving on wednesday nights a lot too right right guys we're moving on wednesday nights hallelujah right see what people might skip wednesday night oh there's not enough anointing it's not a good service they're all good services when jesus comes amen but we got invited and if we invite him surely he'll come amen [Music] true but the one wednesday night austin was really bothered by a certain situation in his house he come in my office he talked to me for like 30 minutes i was just listening we prayed and i said lord either change austin or remove the situation the next day unexpected the situation totally changed god answered the very next day amen praise god all right god well nina's mom was missing what do we do brother austin said uh he said that make sure you have jose pray well jose didn't come that night i was closing service and the holy spirit just reminded me pray for uh lena's mom i said who can pray here tonight we only had a couple people that's all it takes everybody it just takes a couple people where two or three are gathered there i am in your midst amen that's all it takes hallelujah you don't take jesus a whole bunch of people it takes jesus just a couple believers amen just a couple that's all he needs just a few licks of fire and then the holy fire comes down amen amen that's right and boy if we ever had a prayer that was a prayer hallelujah the holy ghost anointed sister naomi the mighty way holy ghost anointed you to say get out satan get out satan you yell that numerous times we yell jesus jesus jesus and look what jesus did they was it the next day the two days after the very next day she's been missing for days uh out on an awful uh drug binge or something like that and the next day they find her and she's alive and then we talk to her and then within one week she repents for what she's done now i know she got some issues now but it's better off now than what it was is that right it's a process amen who was that that answered prayer that was jesus amen on a wednesday night praise god amen the devil likes to say nothing's happening there's a lot of happening praise god we've got to open our spiritual eyes get out that eye sound how do you thank god i can rub it tonight thank god we all can rub it on our eyes tonight hallelujah so is this true church when we ask do we receive is this true sure better believe it's true amen you better believe we just don't know when it's going to happen now sometimes it's our fault it doesn't come to pass but god will forgive us god will deal with us with that that's true but what do we gotta do church if our heart condemn us just confess all your sin confess any sin and then you can have confidence again so now i'm gonna pray again i've confessed all my sins let's pray again let's ask god to move amen that's true that's why church don't be afraid if you have a need tonight or something right afterwards just because it's wednesday god has been moving on wednesdays amen god has been answering on wednesday nights amen hallelujah and just goes to show god answered god answers whenever we're in condition and whenever it's his will the bible says if you abide in me my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you didn't say the time he just said he'd do it therefore saying to you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them you shall have them and when ye stand pray forgive you see we've got to confess our sins and forgive others that have hurt us if we expect god to forgive us we've got to forgive others god will not answer our prayers if we don't forgive other people you will be judged jesus said the very way you judge other people right i know i'm hard on certain people that have either left the word or criticized me or something but that's because i've gone to them and i've told them specifically or letter talked to them on the phone or emailed them or or sent them letters i told them exactly what they're wrong with and when they won't repent then they're they're going against the word of god right i don't have anything against them but i've told them the truth and now it's in their core are they going to repent and most times they don't that's okay god's in control vengeance is god's not mine vengeance is not yours vengeance belongs to god and actually we actually i don't even want veggies i just want mercy for these people amen the mercy of their repentance that's what we want praise god hallelujah forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses we all got trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is heaven forgive your trespasses we must forgive others and then we can expect god to forgive us amen now also god honors integrity and purity so that every time god will hear your prayers just because of your faithfulness to him we saw that with hezekiah and i remember he was choosing the permissive will of god which was a bad choice but god still gave it to him which is amazing i i can't quite understand that but god is gracious that's all i can all i can think he said remember now how i walk before thee in truth how many walking in truth anyone else i am i'm walking the truth i'm not walking in a lie no this message is the truth amen amen amen because this message is the bible the message is the bible scriptures god is fulfilling right now praise god amen hallelujah i'm walking in truth with a perfect heart now this means of course a heart that just repents because no heart is perfect no one can ever go without sinning except jesus christ so this means someone who just confesses all the time and tries to live the best they can and he said you've done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore so i love this god honors people that have integrity that walk in the truth that want to do what's right god will honor that and then god will hear their prayers don't the bible say the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man prevails much church your prayers are powerful amen amen i just listened to your numerous examples of how powerful your prayers are amen amen hallelujah amen god hears our prayers we gotta live right yes we got a walking truth gotta have a perfect heart so that's the first thing confess all sins forgive all people second thing is ask for the will of god which will be a revelation right so confess your sins and then ask a leper came and worshiped jesus and lord if you will this is a perfect example lord if you will will you heal me he says i will praise god i love it amen lord will you that see that's why we gotta ask lord will you take away this lord will you forgive me of this lord will you save that person lord would you heal me of this we got to say is it your will lord if you will see we got to be neutral we got to be humble and say god it isn't your will see but most of the time we just want to boss god around if we're honest we just want to tell god what we want and that's a spoiled child right right i can tell which of my children have matured sister who into maturity and which ones are still so immature because the immature ones tell me daddy do this i'm like no i'm not going to do what you want me to do all the time but the other ones say daddy can i have this or daddy can you give me that or daddy can you get me socks or daddy daddy can you get me something daddy can you give me some mice for my snake can you do it you don't demand it because he's got an understanding it's dad's will hallelujah that's what i appreciate now okay it's dad's will not not my will let the fathers will be done hallelujah amen a church you're going to find there's sometimes where your will does light up with god's will and god will answer your request right away but it's not every time right now not every time we've got to be careful about that not ordering god around but we got to we've got to wait until we we uh we feel like we're in obedience and we've done what god has asked us to do jesus said verily verily i say to you the son can do everything of himself did i read that right no no jesus could not do anything of himself but what he sees the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also do the son likewise brother reported this and said jesus never healed anyone by his own will jesus always relied upon the will or the revelation of the father the church said amen now there are times god did heal through jesus and jesus didn't know about it like the woman with the blood issue he said who touched me and brother said he was not joking he didn't know who touched him no look at that god can even work outside of jesus is human flesh and human mind but he looked at her so daughter your faith has made me whole amen what was it it was the woman's faith pulling upon the gift of god she had a revelation if i can just god let her know beforehand if i can just touch him i'll be made whole jesus didn't know what's going to happen but she knew because she had a revelation church how important is revelation today revelation was so great that even jesus didn't know it that woman's revelation because god didn't let even his own son know about that that's true i can't do anything except the father shows me hallelujah amen so what is one of my sayings pray and ask god for revelation what we find though is that we get we get partial understanding of revelations i hope you understand me on this one like when austin when he told that testimony when he prayed for that what's her name karen kathy kathy ed coven austin was just he showed a dream that she was going to be well well he didn't say thus saith the lord he just had a real burden it was going to be healed so he had a partial understanding right but you can go out and say thus say the lord is going to be healed because you're not a prophet so that's what i'm saying in most of our cases we've got to be careful right and most of us are i mean i would say all the time we are we just gotta we gotta realize i'm not gonna be a prophet i may not know exactly the perfect will of god but i have a strong leading i have a strong burden to do something and i'm doing the best i can and of course we got to be careful not to make ourselves profits but at the same time follow the leading of the lord and be led by god to do god's works like i said that who is that being healed i didn't have thus saith the lord i just i just i just saw him now he died but was uh he died but was brought back i was woke up early with there's life in the tongue i just said it just seems it's just the perfect timing of god but the whole time i was hoping he'd be doing well i didn't have a revelation like i knew i just asked god because i felt the word of god was the timing was right you know and what i wasn't a prophet but now i look back and say well it's a revelation but i was just trying to keep the faith i was just trying to i i'm just trying to believe that the best i can does everyone understand amen what i'm saying is that when we get a revelation since we're not prophets we don't say thus save the lord many times amen if we do say thou said lord then we're a minor prophet and the church said amen hallelujah that we're a minor prophet glory now program says plainly i shouldn't make this smaller i'm sorry but man you got to first find the will of god you got to find the will of god this morning as you're coming to be prayed for you got to find the will of god whether it's god's will to heal you or not the first thing is to find out what god's will is and then if you really have received the seed in your heart then you can be persistent there's nothing going to move you yes sir find the will of god i'm not going to read all that because you understand then brother graham said he says if you want to be healed he said check your motive and objective there has to be a real objective to be in the will of god if you want to be well what do you want to be well for see if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling god what do you want to do with your life when you get healed see there's got to be you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of god then then when the faith is revealed to you and by a sovereign grace places that faith in there then it's over see okay so now if we don't know god's will whether it's to heal or save or do something then we got to first repent of our sins right and then ask god and make sure our motive is right like i always pray this god i don't care who you save i just want to win souls and they don't have to come to my church [Music] then my motive is right because it's not about building up my church or our church it's just that they get saved and they know jesus amen that's the motive and objective now the one time i did ask for somebody from this church it was brother amen and then you come along which was a great blessing hallelujah i said lord i'm either going to be stop pastoring and this is 2014 by the ray i said i said lord i'm either going to stop pastoring or go out as evangelist or you're going to save somebody in my ministry and send them into my church and that was brought with your brother amen and sister who came in so that that's about that's a gideon vibe everybody with that's a gideon sign and so there's times if you ask god for a sign then believe the sign if you know it's god don't say thou say the lord because you're not a prophet but believe the sign with all you got if you ask for it and god gives you do it then believe it but you gotta hang on amen amen you gotta hang on if you really believe it's god's word that was in the summer so let's say june june july august september it was november 2014 brother amen and sisterhood said we're making your church our home church so i had to wait five months brothers that ain't very long actually that's a really short time i made a vow i said lord i'm i'm leaving pastor if you don't send somebody in here amen see my motive and objective was i just want to preach i just want to do what god wants me to do you want me to be a pastor or manchester and so i asked god for a sign god gave me the sign so i stand here because god answered my prayer just like a real man or a daughter of god someone that believes god's word we just want to know god's will and then we can walk in it amen then i can preach to one two three four five ten people just as hard as i preached to a hundred people amen last weekend because it don't matter i know the will of god it doesn't care nothing else matters god has answered my prayer he's giving me the word he's giving me the revelation and now i've got to do my part carry out the revelation amen amen feed these souls that god sent to us feed these wonderful souls that god said to us hallelujah amen brother the god that saved your soul can you heal your body it's just the same reveal to you he's your healer as he was your savior but it's got to be revealed first that's the difference you have to have something to base your faith on see revelation first revelation first all right i'm gonna have to i got way too many quotes uh for this night i would say i mean for some night that might be good now i want to say this here here's where brother amy and i were talking and this is where we all have cases where we don't know because we're not profits we don't know sometimes god's will about some of our requests like our lost loved ones are they going to be saved god can't force them to be saved they've got to choose by his free will by their free will right so brother man tells us if you don't know it's best to hope and then trust god hope and trust god what do the three hebrew children say our god is able to deliver us but if not we will not serve your gods amen amen they walked into a burning flame of fire they didn't know it was god's will to save them it's true that sounds so encouraging to us because we don't know how the squeeze is going to play out right there the the rhetoric from the government is getting more aggressive see canada not taking away guns right when's that going to come to the u.s yeah it might it might not but it might they're trying to they're trying to uh disarm the people so they can do a purge that's what that's what that's what that's what the squeeze is eventually is going to turn into a purge if you don't take the mark of the beast they're going to purge the world the world of those people that turn on the mark of the beast sure which will be foolish virgin by god's grace because the true bride will be out of here amen right but if not see that's how it is we don't know exactly how the squeeze gonna play out we don't know how god's going to deliver us we don't know how it's going to go but one thing for sure we will not serve the roman catholic church we will not serve the world hollywood we will not serve them we'll serve jesus christ amen hallelujah and i just believe if god delivered them god will deliver us amen i don't know i just believe i'm hoping for it it's better to trust in men i'm sorry trust in the lord than to put confidence in man blessed is the man that trusts in the lord and whose hope the lord is see the lord is your hope jesus is your hope right he's your living hope hallelujah now if god reveals the word to you or gives you some type of like austin a dream or like me wow i woke up at 4 30 with just that scripture on my mind three scriptures but speak the word then you gotta hang on to that with all your heart act light it's gonna come to pass and the church said amen that's what the whole sermon i was listening to part of it today works his faith expressed that's what that whole sermon is about if you have faith in god's word then your works will show it if you believe god's going to save your mind if i believe god's going to save my mind then we've got to act like it amen because that's faith that's a revelation working out through your life now any promise you're seeking i know we know some of our situations some of the things you're praying for you've let me know if you don't know god's will you should still hope for what you want make sure your motive and objective is right and then act like god's going to answer it that's going to be my closing but i'm not closing right now i got 13 minutes on my 45 minutes so i've already preached 30 minutes hard to believe that but see once you get that then you got to act like it's going to happen that may be a long time you might get tested a little on the way and you might stumble and fall but get encouraged again because that's what happened to abraham amen that's what happened to your dad abraham and the church said amen that was that's what happened to the father of faith but the bible says he's staggered not so through the blood through the power of the blood covenant the blood doesn't recourse your mistakes the blood doesn't remember your shortcomings the blood doesn't remember your failure the blood forgives all that jesus looks at you through his own blood amen and he sees perfection he sees a finished product he sees a real son or daughter of god with a white washed garment on amen amen you are not clothed in your righteousness you're clothed in jesus righteousness amen hallelujah that's what makes you holy is because the holy spirit's anointing you amen that's your righteousness is the holy spirit upon you now it's hard to see some smiles in some amen amen hallelujah amen that's your righteousness amen the righteousness of the saints the bible says amen there's lots of examples of people who got revelations and then had to act upon it abel mary moses david john the baptist and that man uh from africa he bought his baby shoes even before his feet were healed hallelujah so he had faith he knew what's gonna happen said the feet are gonna be healed she went out and bought shoes before they got healed that's real faith he's acting upon the revelation that he was given sure okay then you express or act like you received it with your works yeah i kind of yeah he says if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we do not believe it right now that doesn't mean just one staggering moment of i'm i'm doubting i'm struggling that's not what it means it means if we just keep uh uh keep disbelieving or keep doubting for long long stretches of time church what i've found it just takes one good service and i can get my faith right back to where i needed school or one good prayer meeting yeah a one good sermon or one good song and just take glory it takes one minute one moment in the presence of god five minutes of the presence of jesus christ can change everything hallelujah you know i ought to be more encouraged than ever if my mother-in-law who used to fight against me for 20 years can now sit through me preaching for five or six hours i ought to be really encouraged hallelujah sure from closing calling us colt and all these things to now coming and crying and enjoying the word of god i got so much out of that and she said thanks for your prayers and all that gave me a hug and everything we ought to be really encouraged mountains are moving rocks are moving god is moving god is faithful god is true blessed the lord our works express what faith we have but if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we do not believe it see you've got to believe it all right okay i'm going to get back to tonight here okay i'm already at 35 minutes okay now there's kind of two approaches church to divine healing uh sorry to receiving any promise of god there's kind of two approaches now brother branham told us his approach he says the promises are to everyone yet he knew that wasn't right and i'm going to show you the quote so i'm not making that up i would never want to make anything up that was his approach the promises are for everyone okay now the other approach is the one i've learned through brother graham's sermons okay so i felt like he hid it numerous all about i just showed you some of those perseverant quotes and then the church age book he puts them all through here and i feel like this is i think this is the mature approach but i could be wrong on that that's just my thought but my my my approach is that promises are to those whom god ordains in his perfect will and that's a lot but this is based upon what the bible said about how jesus operated his gifts god's promises are not for everyone as far as i can understand but they're to those that god ordains in this perfect will now here's the quote let's get down here he says we believe the word of god every promise that he made is true that's right it's about anybody who will accept it and now there's some who try to accept it and cannot there's others who can accept it and some get it without half trying now that's a whole other sermon some people can get divine healing or miracles and they hardly try at all that's true right let me say like this you didn't fast for it no you didn't pray for it really hard right hey but i prayed for austin to get that out of debt i didn't pray that hard it was one little prayer we might have did two little prayers brother you know you and i it's all right it's true some of them god just answers without much effort right on the human side now that we have to preach the gospel that healing is to all yet we know it's not so beloved tell us this right his approach was healing is for everybody but yet he knew it wasn't isn't that something it is to all if they can receive it but we know that they all could not receive it that's a very wise statement amen right we know just like just like salvation the bible said god wouldn't all men be saved god wants salvation to everybody but he knows that everybody will receive it right okay now the reason i would take a different approach is because i'm not preaching to sinners all the time i get the same wonderful people almost every week brother brad would go to special meetings there'd be sinners in there i mean they would have 10 20 people get saved all these services we'd i mean we hardly have it get people safe it's just different different ministries get a divine healing ministry i've got a pastor ministry so if i'm going to be preaching the same people every day or every service i can move beyond this is for everybody to god is trying to do his perfect will in your life and you need to see god's perfect will for your life i don't have to be general i can be very specific because you hear me week after week after month after year thank god you come back thank god hallelujah without you we would we would not have a church hallelujah remember brother said the laity are just as important as the preachers right it's satan who tries to conquer the laity nickoladens and take the holiness out of the people you're just as holy as me hallelujah because we're holding by the blood amen you have just as many gifts as i do because the the gifts are in the body of jesus christ so let's all be used by the glory of god amen let's come here anointed let's come here with confidence let's put our faith together let's believe god's word amen amen hallelujah your prayers are just as important but also when we prayed and elena's mom come back who prayed harder was it sister naomi or me who was it when lindy had that issue there uh and remember i had a mind battle who was it that brought you out i prayed hard i've heard but who got you deliverance sister now you understand that sister lina when your sister needed help it was your night prayer right who'd god use well it was her enough we put our faith together it's very similar there's different gifts and we all have to be somebody said this we all got to be available to be used by god amen we have to be surrendered and willing and if you're called upon to pray hallelujah are you if you're not pray amen amen hallelujah or like naomi did go up to the person if you've got a burden and they're on your heart even the service is closed you go talk to them sure if god is leading you to do that that's your gift operating sure hallelujah right but eventually i just want to be as honest as i can be i preach it like this for everybody but it's not we'll see then i feel like i can learn from that i can i can say it's not for everybody i can say find god's will for your life amen i can use jeremiah 29 and say seek god with all your heart soul mind and strength and then you'll find him. amen does everyone understand amen we're thinking real deep tonight on those things there's two approaches so i don't take that first approach i don't say they're for everybody because i we know not everybody's gonna be healed not recently gonna be saved i i approach it god is going to ordain the perfect will of god for your life and let me say it like this you can have the permissible of god but you really don't want it right god could give you the permissive will but you really don't want that that's why i say ask for the perfect will of god make yourself neutral and let god ordain what happens in your life hallelujah amen that's why i take this out here's why i take the second the second approach the first approach and brother graham actually says is i heard it today works as faith express he said we see a lot of disappointments in divine healing he said people get emotional and they think that emotion is god telling them they're going to be healed and he said they get disappointed they go off and they're still sick but i just i feel like if i preach it like everybody's healing for everybody's salvation for everybody then there could become disappointments if the promises i promise them don't come to pass right what if i told all of you yes it's god's will to do this yes it's god well what if i don't know what if i'm wrong right then you get disappointed in me and i let you down and you think god lets you down but really god didn't let you down i just let you down are you with me true the rap says that there's disappointments in divine healing if we don't find god's will first right and then of course the second reason i go i don't know what this is for everybody is because what i see jesus say so you see so see first there's harder disappointments you could get mad at god someone could get mad at god since he didn't keep his promise but we know god does maybe it wasn't his ordained or perfect will and yet you'll see other people they got the promise but i didn't get it so i'm mad at god i've had people tell me that they're they hate god they're angry god sure they they didn't get married when they wanted to they want to get married at a younger age and so they said i hate god i'm mad at god because of that now where is in the bible does it say you got to be married by 20 or 18 or 22. you don't say that in the bible but that evil spirit has found that person for many years i've always known something wrong with that person they're a woman and they said i wish i was a preacher that was the first that was a big problem and i still never repented of that one even though i told them to told her to repent of that that's fine that's between them right it's between her and god right but see if we preach it like it's for everybody then people will be disappointed well your brother brother you said you told me the lord heard your prayer you said no i said find god's will first that's what i said that's what that's what we all want to say let's find god's will first because then when we got god's will we know what's going to happen praise god now i'd give you numbers like i believe god will heal you 99 of the time or ninety-eight percent of the time whatever to say in other words the majority of the time god's gonna heal you especially while you're young right but god doesn't heal every single time like in the case of elisha he died of a disease in case of paul's eyes he said three times deliver me and god didn't heal from that at that time we don't know when he did it when or if he did get healed of that we don't know now the other thing is if we say it's for everybody you could condemn yourself or a preacher or friend or live under guilt because you or others could not build up enough faith so you feel disappointed well i'm not a good christian well but brother adam says you can't receive anything unless god gives it to you it's a gift faith is a gift you're saved by grace through faith it is the gift of god not of works that's that ain't your most amen in other words god has a plan for your life and if he wants to do a miracle through healing he'll make sure you have that anointing at that time amen how do you praise god you want to do god's perfect will just remain humble just remain neutral obey his voice all the time then god will anoint you at the right time in the right season so see i feel like it's best to emphasize each individual seek god's will for themselves sure that's why i don't say it's for everybody that's why when you hear me pray now or i've been praying for years out if it's your will god may be according to your will right because it's got to be god's will three times jesus said i can do nothing very very i say to you the son could do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do he had to see a vision first john 5 30 i can of my own self do what not nothing then jesus says without me you can do nothing hallelujah jesus could do nothing without the father and we can do nothing without him praise god jesus says i do nothing of myself so if he couldn't do anything of himself we can't do anything of ourselves we gotta wait for his power right we gotta wait for his anointing and the church said what was it that happened on that night we prayed for your mom or pray for your sister that was god's anointing come down that wasn't us it wasn't our power we just got the channel god wanted to move through us so god moved all glory to god and then god will not share that glory with me or austin or hua or lena or naomi god will not share his glory with anybody amen hallelujah so we just rejoiced i was there when god did it it wasn't me but god is flowing through me praise god it wasn't us it was god's wrong flowing throat we were blessed just to be there when god moved amen we were blessed just to see god answer our prayer no great ones among us oh you're the you're the greatest you're the greatest wife there ever was oh you're the greatest song special person there ever was you're the greatest brother in christ there ever was nonsense nonsense oh you're the greatest preachers of all time nonsense hallelujah it is all god's grace it is all god's mercy we're just there when it happens amen amen he said we're just like microphones the voice ain't even us it's just passing through us amen we're just the glove we're not blood has no power so we have no power it's just god picking us up and using us praise god he's got to be surrendered to his time in season hallelujah like i told you that preacher who went to the church and said god's going to heal the pastor's wife she died right so that was not god that's an example where you say something without having a revelation in other words that man as gifted as he was has tremendous gifts he's probably born again he's probably got a big complex of pride so many powerful testimonies but that man failed to seek god's will first and what happened it caused a great big letdown and i found out even that the mother who died her son had had a a kind of strange thing happened he was preaching and then while he was preaching his ipad just started preaching brother branham and i just went right along with the sermon he thought that would be a miracle or a sign that his mom would be healed and then when his mom died he was all disappointed so see how church we're all just kind of struggling to know the will of god thank god they didn't say thus faith the lord thank god then they'd truly be a false prophet or false prophet preachers see we are just we're we're looking through a glass dark remember when i told you that all these prophecies and tongues and visions they'll all fail but one thing will remain that's god's love amen hallelujah i'm playing americans i love them you love them too we're glad when god does them i'm glad i'm there and god doesn't but i can do nothing of myself neither can you then we must not take god's glory amen amen if jesus could do nothing without god first showing him how much more do we need god to do something first right we see the same truth in jacob and rachel's marriage jacob could not do nothing without god remember rachel's like begging him give me a child or i'll die and he said am i in god's stead same thing like i'm not god i can't i can't do it i gotta pray to god right that's why we don't promise it for everybody we can't promise it to everybody because it's up to god it's not up to man it's up to god now god told rachel he could not give her a child god eventually though opened rachel's womb see god remembered her see church god will remember you amen she went she went to man can man help me know but no doubt she must have prayed prayed prayed god said then i remember i hear your prayer i'll pour out your answer i'm faithful i care for my daughter i'll speak to her i'll give her my word i'll answer her prayers hey see she went to the wrong person she shouldn't have went to her husband she went to god because god's the only one who's got revelation now god might speak a word through your husband or something or wife or something like that all right stephanie's also great god god bless stephanie hope you're enjoying the word of god tonight hopefully the internet didn't kick out like we got that often problem isaac actually had to intercede for his wife to have children in other words this one wasn't going to happen unless the father had a real burden to pray and the church said see because god has a different plan for everybody different tests different trials all for one thing god's glory amen be thou glorified that's right now it seems some struggle more than others with promises i'm just going to lay this in just real briefly here some people they pray boom answers right away that don't mean they're more spiritual it just means that's how god wanted to answer yes right that's true but there's others who can accept it others can't and some just get it without half trying that's true that's so true you'll struggle struggle god do this god and then you'll see somebody else get the answer well what's wrong with me well that's what the devil wants you to think there's nothing wrong with you god has a different plan for you praise god remember we don't see a lot of struggle in this passage this one i mentioned earlier i'm sorry this is the great multitudes no i'm sorry this is the one i said earlier we don't see a lot of struggle but perhaps there were years worth of struggle the father must have shown jesus the healing beforehand but god didn't show jesus all the healings beforehand okay so here's what we don't see a lot of struggle he just comes up he says if you will will you heal me he says i will you're healed i mean it's just like that fast just one little conversation jesus will hear me yes all right glory my leprosy is gone pretty fast and easy it seems like now church if we're all honest don't we want that to be our situation lord i've got a toothache or lord i may be more serious lord i've got cancer god take it away without any chemo now i've got that for my mom but god don't do that for everybody we all we all want it fast and easy now in this poor support portion we don't see a lot of struggle in this passage but perhaps this man was 30 this man was already battling for 38 years this is the man there's a whole multitude of sick and jesus only healed one of them okay so we don't see a lot of struggle in this situation but no doubt he probably struggled for 38 years in the sermon on desperation brother seems to say god allows struggle or desperation god wants you to struggle sometimes the church said amen i say god wants you to struggle sometimes amen so you'll be desperate for fellowship with him amen amen hallelujah that's true he wants you to struggle to receive a promise to bring out your true colors your true character amen amen god is trying to bring out a real believer he's trying to show your real truth quality character even if you have trials you'll keep persevering even if things don't go easy you'll keep believing even if everything seems to fall apart you'll keep trusting god amen and the only way that could happen is by letting you struggle other people are going to quit fall away but not you amen others will give up talk bad about the preacher talk bad about the song leader talk bad about all the sisters they'll give up and they'll curse and they'll walk away but you won't because you're a real believer amen you'll go through struggles you'll go through trials if somebody offended you you'll go talk to them amen but see struggles bring out your real character here's where brother brown says it in doing that in desperation it brings out the real thing that you are it shows what you're made out of in the time of desperation usually pulls all the good things that's in you sounds like a fiery trial of faith and you'll come forth as gold amen you are the goal but you've got some drugs but you got to go through the fire to show what you're really made out of and remove all the unbelief remove any sinful desires the only way to do that is to struggle to be desperate while other people can just walk right up sometimes well you've had it too just walk up prayer answer right away i remember that sign that amen was sick and you're laying by him and you just reach your hand over you felt the power of god on your arms you remember that a couple years ago and amen was instantly healed then you went back to bed well that's nice right you have to stay up and pray all night you see church that's that's one of those times where it's just easy thank god for those but not everyone's like that it's all on god's plan it's all in god's depending on god's will this must mean that god has different testimonies for purposes to use on the day of judgment our lives are his work that we must walk in and accept god has a work for brother austin to do god has a work for sister naomi to do god has a word sisterhood for you you've got to do it it's already laid out and you just have to you're created for that work and you just have to walk in those works in the perfect will of god by waiting on god for the revelation of god amen gloria that's right put that nail down in there pinch it so now look at this brother brandon's advice to a man being divorced i just want you to see this because i can't think of anything harder than to be divorced by somebody and left behind can you imagine now i was left behind by my dad so i kind of i can't imagine that actually but not my spouse thank god for my wife and i thank god for our love the holy spirit praise amen but look what brother man tells a man his wife has walked away from her and they have two kids together look what he tells him to do he said just be as happy as you can be now you think that would rip your heart out right it would feel like it's ripping out your heart and your soul but brother adam says satan is only trying to destroy your physical health by making you worry and making you mourn right now here's the question uh she's my wife's sued me for divorce we're separated what must i do we have two boys he says brother let me tell you she's going to sue you for divorce that's satan you shouldn't do that but you're a christian and done enough in the world to hinder that woman and satan doing that he's only trying to tear you up yeah now look without thus saying the lord look what brother graham tells this person brother doesn't have thus saith the lord look what he says he basically says be neutral and pray committed to god and wait for god to work it out that's true church the prophet don't have all the answers sometimes god don't give him a vision right right hello he's not god right but man says god only tells prophets what he wants them to know amen amen so he didn't tell brother in this case brother just said she just now if she's one of god's elect she'll come to him if if she's not she's not worth worrying about that's a statement i married the woman we've had two kids but if she's not elect she's not even worth worrying about that's quite a statement that's that's speaking of like divine pres that's not human perspective that's like divine perspective that's that's a statement right there true if you worry listen it'll break down you it'll break your health down and that's what satan wants to do he's working i know it you so you just commit the whole thing to god and go right on serving god just as happy you're in the midst of a divorce and just be as happy as you can be god will take care of the rest of it all that the father is going to come to me look he says now get down on your knees i'll pray with you or anything i'll pray over the matter just say lord i love her she's the mother of my children i'll just commit the whole thing to you lord i want them saved you know i do but i can't go no further she's going to divorce me anyhow i haven't done nothing if i have revealed reveal reveal reveal amen reveal your will amen amen reveal if i did something wrong reveal your ways your will for this situation and i'll go make it right i will do anything then commit to the lord and just let it alone just let alone go right on living just the same as nothing ever happened and god will take care of the rest of it end quote that's the end of it so see when you don't have thus say the lord what do you do you do the best you can you invest all your sins and you pray and ask god i'm asking you and i'm waiting on you and then try to be as happy as you can because satan wants to make you sorrowful when you get sorrowful and depressed what happens your health goes down you start getting diseases he's trying to destroy your body he's trying to kill steal and destroy yeah but jesus come that we might have life and have it more abundantly now i'm just have to close here i'm good okay i'm left so two conclusions let's stand our feet my musicians can come so basically i took two conclusions church how you can find the will of god for any promise of god spend that song i want what you want for me to do whatever or whatever it may be two conclusions first if you already have the revelation church this is a pretty this is the one that's a little more easy to understand first confess your sins every day right be happy or positive whether god requires desperation enough god may require you to be desperate god was requiring uh remember in jeremiah 29 god was requiring israel to be desperate they had to seek god with all their hearts soul mind and strength to go back to the land [Music] some of them you might not have to be desperate [Music] but sometimes god is calling you to desperation so it can show what you're really made of i'm a real believer i've struggled for months i've struggled for years but i'm still believing because i'm a real christian praise god hallelujah i'm not a quitter i'm not a doubter i'm not mr skeptic amen i'm mr believer i'm misbeliever hallelujah and then if you know it act like you already got it like i'm sure austin was happy kathy's going to be healed he's going to be healed i'm sure he was happy glory that's if you know the revelation if you don't brother says get in the holy spirit first which means what confess all your sins then just like the other one be happy and positive waiting or hoping whether god requires desperation or not [Music] amen [Music] and then three worship and trust god his will or his plan even if we're not sure if god's gonna do it we're not sure we still need to worship god and give him praise because if he doesn't do it then his way is better than our way and we should want what god wants and not what we want let me close with this how many have the baptism holy ghost if you have holy ghost you have charity the bible says charity suffers long [Music] i'm gonna say that again if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost you can suffer long because it's not you doing it it's god doing it charity verse 7 bears all things it can bear that burden of waiting [Music] i love this next one believeth all things that means believes all revelations and then what's the next one hopeth glory popeth all things church god doesn't give us revelation every single day like i know what's gonna happen today i know what's gonna happen tomorrow i know it's gonna happen friday i know god don't do it like that [Music] when we don't know the will of god the bible says the love of god in our hearts it hopes all things i hope god does this i'm going to keep worshiping i'm going to be neutral i'm going to give him praise i've made my request to run to god i'm hoping he hears me and i'll still love him even if he doesn't answer my prayer praise god hallelujah as i was driving to church that scripture i felt like it dropped down charity hopes all things so if you don't know god's will get the holy spirit then you'll be hoping for it praise god and act like you're hoping for it i hope that was understood i hope the holy spirit gave you an understanding of that i might have chopped it up let's bow our heads here how you can know the will of god for any promise that's how you know seek god get in the holy spirit first and then start acting [Music] church for a lot of us let me just be honest it's going to be waiting everybody repeat after me and say lord i'm willing to wait can we say that lord and let's say lord i'm hoping all things let's say that ready lord i'm hoping all we've got to be willing to wait and we've got to hope hope is an attribute of divine love amen hope hoping a long time is an attribute of the holy ghost hoping that god does it if you don't know the will of god yet so i oh brother amen was able to listen to this i'm going to text him after service sister i felt like i want to explain this a little better you know i felt like i knew a good job for our brother [Music] let's pray together how many would say brother jesse pray for me that i'll be able to hope a long time i'll be able to be patient to these promises coming to pass almost every hands up my hands up as well a church you pray for one another sister who why don't you pray
