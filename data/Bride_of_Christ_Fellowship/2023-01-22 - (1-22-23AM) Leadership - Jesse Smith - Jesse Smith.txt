TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Tony I like to look at the life of Solomon but before I get to Solomon I like to uh just look at leadership for a few messages here by God's grace so we're going to preach on leadership this morning Matthew chapter 20 verse 16. Hallelujah of course A Familiar verse here and as I talked with different you know Saints and brothers and things like that we just come on the topic of leadership you know over the last few months and I've just been meditating on it and reading a little book on it I got a book about the Temple of Solomon I bought by Kevin J Connor he's a Pentecostal preacher and he's just been a wonderful resource for me to find a lot of great scriptures and history so and then tying that with what brother Brandon said in the Bible you know it's been a real good study and I'm just gonna try to build to that by God's grace in the next few weeks here but Lord willing so Matthew 20 verse 26. I'm sorry verse 26 honey I'm sorry I'm 16 there no problem thank you appreciate that thank you all right let's read that if we can ready one two three but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister interesting scripture for a leadership message but of course if you know the real heart of leadership you know the real leaders are the servants and there could be no greater leader than our Lord Jesus Christ let's have one more word of prayer here as we approach the word of God if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto God Heavenly Father we've worshiped you we've loved you we've sang your songs a cried Lord God just thinking about Amazing Grace Lord God you took my place God and all my days are known to you Lord Jesus thank you for dropping the charges all my sins Lord you dropped the charges so I thank you Lord Jesus saved by grace through faith what a glorious gospel no wonder it's called The Gospel no wonder it's called the good news Lord God to save a Wretch like Me dear God arrest like each one of us Lord God hallelujah none of us are worthy you will not share your glory with another dear God no man shall boast in your presence Hallelujah so we give you thanks and praise today Lord God just anoint each and every one of us Lord not just the preacher but each and every person Lord God as we've been looking at that every knee every person needs to have a leading of the Holy Ghost I want to leave you the Holy Ghost Lord May each and every listener Lord from the youngest to the oldest have a have a Heart Lord God to be led by the Holy Spirit today we love how you move dear God in your sweetness and your power Lord gentle at times Sharps Stern at times Lord God we just appreciate your leadership God father Lord as I look all my life I'm so thankful Lord you show me your leadership oh God and I could follow you Lord God what a blessing what a privilege Lord God today so we thank you and give you praise Lord just anoint us God as we approach your word each one of us in Jesus Christ's name and Saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so we'll look at leadership this morning you know this evening we'll probably do the kids Bible study we'll look at what is the message I think we started that a couple weeks ago right now I got about uh 27 verses brother Branham used to say what is the message so the message is the scriptures that God is fulfilling right now and Satan attacks that so much he says the messages the tapes as the messages of Jeffersonville or something or the message or you're the message or something like that's why I've been hearing preachers say lately you're the message I'm not the message the message has come into me but Jesus Christ is the message praise God his word is the message Hallelujah and so little children will do the bible study tonight and we'll try to get through maybe five or six of those however many we can get through just to show you right through the scriptures what the message is it's the word of God God is fulfilling today okay so how about a few verses here uh again I'd like to look at this and let's start with the context here of this the scripture here as we look at leadership and of course it's a vast subject it's a I mean you can apply this the word leadership you can apply it to every story in the Bible right how about the leadership of the Garden of Eden can you see the leadership there it was it was God gave it to Adam right but Adam failed right uh and so you can see leadership you can place leadership in every single story of the Bible Hallelujah and then we see leadership all the way at the end there's no Temple because the lamb and the Lord God are the temple thereof praise God there's no need for light because the lamb is a light thereof so who we led by then we're led by Jesus Christ praise God Hallelujah who is God manifest In the Flesh so of course you apply this to every single topic but as I was showing you I like to look at Solomon and eventually get to that I'm going to try to close a little bit you know today with some of his some of his story and the importance of leadership by God's grace so uh Matthew 20 verse 24 I actually preached a little bit of this on Wednesday when we looked at Isolation part three I believe it wasn't but here uh James and John's mother comes to Jesus and says let my two sons sit at your right and left hand right and Jesus said well can you be can you drink the cup that I drink of can you be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized with and they said yes Lord and surely they would surely as Martyrs they'd give their lives each one of those disciples outside of John gave their lives for Jesus Christ um but after Jesus kind of says you know dear Mother Woman and he said this is only given to the Father the father is the only one who gives these seats right and that kind of goes back to our sermon and I think I even preached at Albion you know the pride of message people to say oh we're the greatest of all time the pride and message people to say we are the ones who sit on the right and left hand that's Pride that's a sin um because they're saying they know something that Jesus didn't know or Jesus didn't share on Earth and that's just so awful and of course the tape players say it and the preachers say it too you know it's a shame for anybody to say that because it's pride in the heart and pride is an Abomination unto the Lord priorities abomination of the Lord so that's why we pray for those people that are in such a sad condition because we don't want to be prideful we want to be humble praise God God works in humility Hallelujah thank God for that Hallelujah and we thank God for every testimony verse 25 but Jesus called them unto him so now he calls him over actually I didn't read 24. when the 10 heard it they were moved with Indian Nation against the two brothers so I like what Jesus does whenever there's anger what does he do he calls people together let's talk about this right he doesn't send you away and okay you just be angry and he tries to bring Unity right he tries to bring Unity when there's anger and feelings are hurt and everybody's mad he just he doesn't say go ahead and walk away Jesus doesn't walk away from him he says come unto me right that's what I've always appreciated about my wife you know when I I think I preached like eight marriage Banquets now and at the last few I've just been uh I've been bringing it down to this you know the best part of our family I feel like of course is the leadership of the word of God that God's given unto us in this hour but how it applies to the home is my wife uh will when the children make a mistake she'll correct them right away like she doesn't wait weeks and months and let it and then she talks to them about it so Lydia's smiling so that's probably like an amen from a minute and that's kind of opposite of me like I was raised to just laugh at mistakes and our family was in Pentecostal you know we we kind of laughed at mistakes we didn't you know my mom couldn't bring much correction because she you know her she and my dad were divorced you know so it was really hard for her to do all the jobs um and maybe she didn't know better I don't know uh but that's one thing I love about it you know my wife will call the children together I'm not there all the time right nine months out of the year I'm not there I'm at work but I just love that and that I've tried I've tried to stress that to the married couples that I've been able to minister to that's love Jesus's love is saying hey you're all Angry he's like he's like just come come to me let's talk about this let me calm your anger right let me and the Bible says a soft answer turns away your Wrath now there's times of yell Jesus yelled in the temple right with the Zeal he took the ropes out whipped them out there's a time to yell but there's a time to be gentle so what do you have to do be led of the Holy Spirit the best part about family and Christianity is that you can repent if you make a mistake and God's not going to throw you out of the Kingdom oh I'm done with Jesse he got mad I'm just I'm done with him no I'm saved by grace praise God hallelujah I'm saved to the uttermost the Bible says praise God uh so just what a what an example of Christ so he says you're all Angry don't go fight amongst yourself don't go out to your tents or go don't go out two by two and argue about it he said come to me and I'll make everything right I'll calm you down right because Peter's saying I'm greater and John's like no I'm going to be greater James oh I'm going to be greater they were all great men in One Way by in God's eyes they're all great men right but we don't exalt one another and say oh Peter's the greatest or that one and I'm the greatest or this church is the greatest but God will decide who labored the most God will decide who gets the greatest reward praise God it's up to God and Jesus said you know the prince of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and that they are great and they that are great exercise authority over them so Jesus has to go outside of their culture and say you know remember the Gentiles you're Jews remember the Gentiles they're the ones who Lord over others don't get that Spirit on you so now we know what spirit is on the people that call themselves the greatest of all time right there's a there's an evil spirit on them because the Gentiles didn't have God they didn't have promises they didn't have covenants but the Jews had the covenants the Jews had the word of God hallelujah and so those without the covenants those without the Holy Spirit those without the word of God exercise lordship and they have they have Wicked leadership they have sinful leadership and Jesus says Don't Take Your examples from the Gentiles take your example from me praise God Hallelujah and Jesus I love what Jesus says but it shall not be so among you aren't you glad Jesus stepped in your life and said it will not be so it will not be a sinful life in your life amen you will not be under the wrong leadership you'll be under the right leadership hallelujah amen that just struck me right there real good amen hallelujah it will not be sub why because he dropped the charges because he had Grace on me amen my life will not be a wasted life my life will speak of a testimony of Christ Jesus hallelujah amen it will not be so among the real believers but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister let them be your servant and we've been looking at that over the last few months how to serve others and we want to encourage one another to serve one another that's why I told Zur and each one of the uh each one in the Yang family I said if you need to talk to anybody about the passing of your father just let me know I'll be a listening ear I won't say anything I'll just smile I'll probably cry a little bit too but if you want to share any memories with me about your father and you know the good times or maybe the challenging times I'm here to listen praise God we want to we want to give of ourselves we want to be servants to other people right we just don't want we don't want to be served we want to be the servants and each one of us can have that Spirit of service right the Holy Spirit of service at verse 27 and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as a son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many now this thought just came to me right now remember the Bible said uh there were some women that ministered under the needs of Jesus I think Joanna was one of them somebody help could somebody help me with one of those other names who was it Solomon again one of those but here Jesus says I've come to serve you and he no doubt he was he was the greatest servant but even Jesus had servants who served him these humble little sisters right and then who did Jesus honor after the resurrection amen Mary Magdalene amen The Humble one The Humble servant yeah Mary Magdalene was one of them that's right yep she was delivered out of seven demons and then she along with Joanna I just remember that name Joanna is always a beautiful name there a servant to Christ Jesus and she would and so Jesus honors them by first showing them the resurrection you get to be the first witnesses that I'm alive think about that it wasn't Peter the man with the kingdom it was these humble servants amen oh come on God help us to be servants today hallelujah thank God help us to serve one another humble ourselves like brother said humble yourselves and then you'll really be great in God's eyes got to Humble ourselves not exalt ourselves we have to Humble ourselves and so he gave his life as a payment for many he paid the charges Hallelujah he paid the debt that we all owed praise God he gave his life as a ransom so that should encourage us let me give my life for others as well yours might look different from you know other people you know you give you give your life in other words you give them uh you you give of your own desires your own hopes and dreams which are all selfish dreams right right we have to we have to give up our selfish dreams in order to meet the needs of others and when we do that we really have the mind of Christ we really have achieved the dream that God wants for us right or the the destiny God wants for us when we choose to give up our ideas our plans and we accept the plans of the Lord you know I've talked to how many how many older people have I talked to these last few years that their parents have died you know they're in their 50s or 60s their parents have died or their parents have gotten sick and their whole life trajectory I can't hardly say that word trajectory I gotta go back to Elementary good thing I'm going tomorrow trajectory that's not probably third grade word anyway but uh you know there I've talked to these adults and their life was going this certain direction and then all of a sudden a parent gets sick and now their whole life changes and I've told those I've told each one you know it's been difficult maybe they can't work as much or maybe uh they don't have as much Freedom anymore but I've told each one in each case God will honor you for taking care of your parents because your parents took care of you right that's a simple lesson right Jesus talks about that in the scriptures right the Pharisees try to take that money to take care of the parents right they try to take that away and Jesus said that's a commandment of man that you need to take care of your parents right but just think Church how you know our lives can we can have a certain idea but we've got to be humble enough to accept the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God if God would change the trajectory of our lives in order to serve other people we have to accept that and say praise the Lord God's ways are the right ways because we all know people that choose not to right to their shame right and I know there's cases at them in their lives where they've got to go to hospice or they got to go to the nursing home I understand that but we understand that I'm just saying when God leads you to do something when it's in you the Bible says when it's in your ability to do something to be good to others we should do it praise God Hallelujah and so here we see a real leader Christ Jesus he says you lead by serving other people now of course I looked up web servers this is these are just kind of General I don't really like this leader these definitions so much because just as a position or the ability and capacity to lead but if you look up leading I like that with the arrow you know providing direction or guidance I like that definition there praise God because leadership is giving you guidance it's giving you a direction to go you need to walk in this way right I need to walk with this and I need a word of guidance so Lord Lead Me Guide Me with some type of word some type of Direction I need to know which way to go I need to know what to choose so God thankfully God gives us guidance and Direction praise God we're like sheep he's like the great Shepherd Hallelujah Hallelujah and he leaves the 99 to go get the one amen hallelujah thank you Jesus so he's here Church he's here today to provide guidance and Leadership to each one of us Glory and you know of course this thought came to my mind too everyone leads in some way right like last night James was James and I were playing with the Dinosaurs on the floor he was leading the play I was following his lead his lead was his T-Rex would uh kill my T-rex and I just had to act like I was dying you know that he was leading there you know uh and so you know just one simple example but everybody's a leader you know I pastors lead the congregation I lead the congregation Paris lead children husbands lead wives I could have put wives lead children in there and they when they guide the home right the Bible says I'm sorry sisters I forgot that one forgive me I don't want to forget the sisters I got a church full of sisters we're way outnumbered Brothers uh so forgive me I didn't mean to forget that today uh but it's just a vast beautiful subject you know you can break it down each one of these could be a long series I mean how many series is a man gonna need to be a real leader right I need leadership all the time I need to learn all the time how to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost right how many sermons do children need to become leaders of their parents to listen the first time children how many how many sermons do we need for that how much prayer time do we need for that praise God obey the first time don't wait to the second time obey the first time I was lecturing my class about that this week you know I'm saying first time obedience you must I want you to obey the first time they're just trying to get caught up from the you know the Christmas break and all the sugar they ate probably and come down from that sugar high but just reminding them like it's so important you know um everyone leads you know and the children will lead their friends right when you have play dates somebody takes the lead we're gonna play this game okay well either you follow or you don't I mean you go play by yourself or whatever you have that choice so everybody is a leader and uh the greatest leaders are the servants as we said with Jesus that's our text there so yeah I just want to revisit that again that's what makes Jesus so great that he was such a servant to other people I just love what John said I'm always reminded that in John chapter 20. you know he said I suppose even the whole world cannot contain the books that could be written about Jesus's leadership because that's what he was he was a servant a servant leader praise God you know I just uh I just thank the Lord you know you always Jesus was always serving other people his life was given as a a sacrifice for other people that's how we knew he was different of course he had the signs wonders Miracles the prophecies but here in this we can see how he served other people he went to other people he ministered other people and that's what made him great was his service for other people and great leaders as well as I'll tell them brother amen yesterday I was telling him you know what I was going to preach today and just how I was being stirred up when I was studying and everything like that uh I said great leaders are really great followers so whenever you see a great leader you know we could go I was looking at some other books I was looking at you know the history of military and all these things and how many great generals there were I mean see how you could preach they could preach a whole you could preach a whole lifetime on leadership really uh you know you could look to every area business you look at military religion good leadership or bad leadership but really the greatest leaders are those who follow another leader or have learned to follow another leader right and so Jesus followed every word of the father there can never be a greater leader than Christ never so here with with him it's just it's so simple you think about it all the all the self-help podcasts that are out all the self-help books that have been written over the years think about that think about all the YouTube videos and all the Rumble videos and all the self-help and how to lead and how to be successful how to be productive all these things it could all be summed up in one person if you want to be a great leader if you want uh if you want to be great in this life if you want a life that's worthy of the Gospel follow Jesus Hallelujah or look to Jesus's leadership and that will show you how to be a leader praise God but I was just thinking now even remember uh Miriam on the Red Sea Red Sea Shore she was a leader for the Sisters right with their worship right the Bible didn't say Moses got out there and danced the Bible said Miriam led the sisters out there to dance right see even that a woman leading women right Titus said that the Elder women ought to teach the younger women how to love their children how to keep their home amen see so see Elite sisters can be leaders right just simple examples like that all from the scripture but I love what Christ said uh and he that sent me is with me how many no God's with you praise God let's pull out all the blessings all the truth out of here and the father hath not left me alone how many know the father is with you praise God Hallelujah for I do always those things that please him so we get some lessons in here first if we want if we want God's presence more we have to obey What God Says right so Jesus is saying I I'm constantly In God's Presence God's never uh left me he said one of the reasons is because I always do that which pleases the father right he's with me he sent me and church yeah that with that thought too each one of us has been sent to this time we were sent here from the mind of God the Bible says you're chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world so God knew all six thousand years of human history in any prehistory whatever who knows how long that was but God knew all that but he sent you here at this time he sent you to be on the earth at this time so we know he sent us here praise God and by Grace he saved us he's opened our spiritual eyes we're no longer Children of the darkness we're Children of the light and he's proven he's with us praise God and he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you he cannot break the promise of his watchful eye his watch will care over our lives he's going to be faithful he's going to keep his word praise God we're set here by God to do a work praise God fathers are sent to lead the the homes and and be not discourage their children the Bible says right don't bring them to discouragement praise God mothers are called to nurture the children in the fear and admonition of the Lord and to and fathers are calling our husbands are called to love their wives and and wives are called to submit to their husbands praise God and all this is done through following the leadership of Christ's example to us amen each one of us in those situations must look to Christ and recognize Christ gave me the example Christ showed me what I must do Christ was a leader he showed me how to overcome in this situation he showed me how uh he gave me guidance for this moment of my life praise God and you know I just think about you know the moment the moment that we're in we're in a moment of mourning we're in a moment of loss with zur's Father passing and amen being sick this probably isn't a dance in service like we'd say we've had some too brother Matt they've been really wonderful we've I've been dancing we've been dancing all around here by God's grace it's been good Hallelujah but you know look at the moment and you I just got to watch those things look at the moment that we're in now we got sick and Afflicted we got you know we got death we got to deal with that but you know in each moment we can look to the leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord what must I do in this hour what's the direction for right now guide me for this moment praise God but I just want to say this too if God answered somebody's prayer and you want to dance around the church you go right ahead have your Liberty you know do like David you just do it with all your might praise God don't give me a half might dance who's looking at me who's watching me should I do how should I dance just do with all your heart praise God let's do it with all your money dance like Dave and dance amen praise God we dance at the school on Friday you know the kids every week I ask the kids at bible Club who wants what song you want to sing and they always say dance like David dance see there's something about a child the joy in their hearts I saw I danced around my classroom Friday morning I do it almost every Friday I'm always dancing around the school there but it's something about children they always want to dance praise God they always want to uh they always they're always usually joyful usually you know if their lives have been protected by the grace of God and the Bible said we must become like children to enter the kingdom of God Hallelujah but thank God he's never left you alone and church you can do those things that please the father Hallelujah you can do it today you and I can choose to please the father today Glory bless you and you know Jesus again these are more thoughts about Christ hearing from the father but you know Jesus only gave them what they could handle right you know like how many times have you prayed for Lord help me to know something I want to know this I want to know that God doesn't always answer right because God knows maybe our motive and objective is wrong or our motive objective could be right but it's just not the time and season for it right so Jesus said henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth now of course they were still servants but he's saying in our relationship you're not you're not he's comparing their relationship to Servant or son there the disciples are always going to be servants everybody understands a minister or a child of God is always going to be a servant but he's just talking about their relationship on our relationship you're not going to be a servant you're going to be equal you're going to be a friend right now of course nobody's equal to Jesus so don't take that too far you're getting all kinds of false doctrines that people take things too far but our relationship you're not going to need a servant you're going to be a friend I'm raising up as Abraham was a friend of God Amen so are we the friends of Christ Hallelujah see the servant doesn't know what he's doing that's why I thank God for the message praise God we know what God is doing right now praise God God is doing uh Revelation 10 8-11 we're eating the book praise God where's my Bible did I leave my Bible in there I left my Bible in there well I always got an extra up here anyway Hallelujah I can't believe I left my Bible in there I left my my good old Scofield but that's what he's done we're eating the revelations of this book the water baptism Hallelujah the marriage and divorce which is crucial people can be adulterers fornicators and not inherit the kingdom of God and think of all these Revelations we have with us saith the Lord the Seven Seals the seven Church ages we have all these Revelations we're eating those Revelations and prophesying them again but we're they're not getting more people Jesus said there's actually less people he said few will find the way that leads to life but thank God we're some of those few praise God oh my thank God I wasn't even looking for this message it came to me you know why because I was hungry for truth well all the other football guys went out I was there in my I was dorm I was reading the Bible on Saturday nights I was in denomination you know what does Matthew 7 mean how how can you do prophecies and go to hell I didn't understand a few months later I hear Brother Brown preach anoint the ones the end time now I understand praise God hallelujah it's a beautiful Revelation praise God but see we know where we are Hallelujah so see that proves we're the friends of God like Abraham he knew where he was going Hallelujah just like that where the Seed of Abraham we know where we're going praise God church and I mean this too you know I watch different uh you know just Christian news sources like CB I never heard of CBN or anything like that they actually believe there's going to be a great Revival and all these uh prophets in the charismatic movement they're not profits they say there's going to be this great story this great Revival but we don't see that in the Bible right we see Paul saying evil seducers will act worse and worse deceiving and being deceived we see Paul saying we're not children of the darkness we're Children of the light praise God Hallelujah and the whole world will be groped in darkness the Bible says the Antichrist will deceive All Nations including China including the USA including Russia right including Ukraine Satan will the Antichrist will deceive all of them so the Bible paints a very dark picture but thank God we know where we are praise God we're not servants we're friends hallelujah we're not strangers we're family hallelujah amen thank God but that's really what they're preaching I just heard a prophet now a charismatic prophet uh yesterday now the reason I listened to him was because he reached out to me and he liked one of my YouTube videos and now he's the president of this charismatic group and he was trying to pull me into his influence and I said I don't want your influence I said you could have my influence I don't want your influence he was trying to get me to put him on my YouTube channel oh my God I don't do that but he was saying oh there's this great Revival coming and we feel it coming oh yeah he said there's gonna be such a Revival that God will send Christians all the money to pay off America's debt now look how close that is oh I just thought of that right now he said don't you know God can come up with 32 trillion because that's how much our debt is oh yeah the ceiling yeah I don't know if they're going to go into gridlock or not but like that's their thinking like okay so uh God's Gonna Save A bunch of people and then God's gonna send all the Christians money to get America out of debt and there's going to be a new age you see how that's it's so wrong but it's it's so close like brother Ram said the debt is going to cause somebody to pay it off but it ain't going to be Jesus it can be the Antichrist it's going to be the Pope right right it has to be because the woman sits on Seven Hills who else sits on Seven Hills but the Roman Catholic Church the seven ancient cities or seven ancient Hills of Rome I mean it has to be the Pope but see how it's so close but yet it's so far away but thank God we are not servants amen hallelujah we're not servants We are family members we're children of God hallelujah we're Jesus is Broad hallelujah amen oh thank God so let him have 15 000 views on his on his on his latest video and I'll take five five or ten let him take that he can have it because the word of God will go to God's elect amen hallelujah God's word will not return void Hallelujah oh it's beautiful that we're not servants we're friends but I've called you friends I'll be glad to be a friend of Jesus I'm glad I'm not a stranger to Christ I'm glad I'm his friend for all the things I've heard of my father I have made known unto you praise God all that God wants us to know he's made known to us and we just know this too as much as we need to know for the Rapture Jesus will let us know all that we need remember brother Adam said thou say the Lord we received the last sign for the Gentiles his ministry the discernment of that was the last sign to the Gentiles so we're not looking for some other great sign we're looking for what the scripture says we're looking for Jesus to return praise God we're looking to trim our lamps Hallelujah and get closer to God and live a more Sanctified dedicated life praise God and also here's another thing I've preached of course you heard me say this we're looking for American laws to change based on the influence of The ecumenical move because that's what program lays out in spoken word Original Seed and the church age book right people have asked me that what are you looking for about Joseph what are we looking for well that's what that's what brother Adam says America has to change the laws in order to murder the Christians because if you don't take the mark of the beast you get murdered so Bob Brown says the churches will unite kind of Unite with the government in order to change the laws that's why I watch the different news places mostly now I'm on Newsmax because the other places just get that Newsmax I mean it's just hard to find any good news source if somebody finds a good news source let me know I've been looking for a long time it's hard to find a good news source where you actually get the updated news of what you know is going on in the Senate and the house and all these things but that's what Broadband told us to do that's what that's what brother Brown said was going to happen and we see it happening remember Trump even allowed the churches now to get into politics remember I showed you that in 2017. I don't have the article right now but he allowed the churches to have more influence in politics and church is just increasing all the time right it's increasing all the time so that's what we're watching for before the mark can be laid down Jesus said I will keep you from the hour Temptation that will come upon the whole earth in Revelation 3 verse 10. why because you've kept the word of his patience Hallelujah if you've kept God's word if you've kept God's leadership he'll rescue you from this one world government thank God we'll be rescued because the word of God has been shared with us his friends hallelujah oh my thank God that was not my notes I just thought I'd preached that today Hallelujah Jesus told him right before he has sent it up to heaven he said he said unto them it is not for you to know the times of the seasons which the father hath put in his own power right so no man knows the day or the hour you know it was it was just shocking to me I was reading uh Charles days Russell and um Uriah Smith this week and I was shocked to see that uh Charles says Russell predicted the Rapture would be in April I think it was uh 1878 or something like that he predicted the Rapture and people still follow him you know I was you know I was just thinking like like Jesus said no man knows those times now was he still safe in one way yeah because he didn't say the day and the hour he gave the month in the year was he still safe yes but look how deceptive that is now come and gone and they said okay well there's reasons it could fail and now they still of course he started the Jehovah's Witnesses movement and everything like that see how that I just was reading that this week but he had all these other doctrines like Jonah went to hell and everything and then came back because the Bible said when he was in the whale he went down to the depths of Hell well that wasn't literal but that's what he taught you know all these kind of things you know it just really shows we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah thank God we got it Hallelujah because it's in the word of God hallelujah the Holy Ghost will only point us to the word of God that's right now I just want to encourage you that this you know Jesus's life shows us that we can be great leaders too not that we'll call ourselves great I never want to say that we're not calling ourselves great but we can achieve wonderful things for Christ because he had no physical Beauty now don't raise your hands but how many feel you're not handsome enough but you sisters don't feel like you're not pretty enough don't raise your hand but like right we all battle these complexes right but Jesus had none of that and yet he could still influence billions hallelujah amen he can still make the most lasting impact as a leader because it didn't deal with your physical image it deals with your spiritual image praise God Amen it's not who you are naturally it's who you are spiritually praise God it's what people see behind the the Veil it's the Christ it's the character that they see behind the outer person it's the character soon after you never have to worry sisters well I'm not pretty enough for her my hair is not long enough or brothers I don't have enough hair I'm losing my hair you never never have to worry about nonsense like that because that's not a requirement the requirement is to obey the father Hallelujah thank God and church it don't require money for the rest of the Holy Ghost is not moved by money he moves by his power so the the prayer should never be Lord I want more money so I can do something for you that that has nothing to do with it money often corrupts and you know power without character satanic and that's what that's you know that you know Oral Roberts may have started out right I don't know I wasn't there but by the end of his ministry that money had corrupted that man have you seen it where he and he ordained Kenneth Copeland take his place and he said he used that scripture in Acts where Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None and he was ordaining Kenneth Copeland and he said Silver and Gold Have We much and they all clapped and they they were saying hallelujah now which now which one do they got they got money but they got no power I'd rather have power and less money thank God for what he you know the signs wonders and miracles he's done in our lives thank God for that but look no matter how he started look at the end Church look at the end unbelievable so it never it never involves riches you know and I'll just be I'll just be transparent you know we I think as Americans we all battle like oh if I just had a little more money if I could just get a little more what can I do to get a little more money but godliness with contentment is what hallelujah amen church amen I'm Amen to you now your testimony you know but it's never by physical looks it's never by riches if you want to be a good leader it's not going to be right into that it's not how much money you have it's not how many likes you got on your selfie I never really got into this I thank God I didn't get into those but see it's all about them it's all about me right it's that's not a leader a leader it's all about you the real leader says it's all about you how can I serve you and it's it's not really how many years you have in your life because again Christ really of Holy Ghost Ministry he only had three and a half years and it's been the greatest Ministry there ever was you know Moses had 40 Years of ministry powerful he part of the Red Sea he spoke things into existence think of that church he spoke please into existence frogs into existence he just spoke it but that didn't compare nothing to John the Baptist now you tell you figure that one out for me he spoke things and his his stick ate up two other serpents all the supernatural he saw the hand of God he was he was so much in God's presence his face was turning like God's face amen it was glowing but God still said Jesus said John the Baptist is greater than all these other prophets so it's not it's not even like the supernatural in your life not even that not even the depths of the supernatural experiences doesn't make a person a better leader now was he a great leader yes Moses was a great leader no doubt by the grace of God but let's just cancel all these off our expectations well if I'm going to be a good leader I got to be handsome no that's that one if I'm a good leader I gotta have riches no that's not one uh for me to be a good leader I got to have a really long ministry that's not one either so how many feel better about your chances to be a good leader so far Hallelujah I feel pretty good too thank God six months how could six months of ministry be greater than 40 years it had to been like brother man said about he said why did why did God use the spirit of Elijah because he was so obedient to the word of God right Elijah would get thus saith the Lord and go out there now let me think about that church he'd go right up to the white house that day and say thus saith the Lord Jezebel think about that thus saith the Lord Ahab and he could have died thou saith lord it's not going to rain until I call for it he stomped out of the window went out back to the Wilderness now we know that's an Old Testament Prophet New Testament prophets stay with the church today right we looked at that but John the Baptist got right there in the face of uh Herod and herodias said it ain't lawful for you to be married to this person and it burned her up I want to begin his head on a charger just couldn't couldn't handle that rebuke what do you do he just preach repentance repent repent and the Bible said the mountains were made low and The Valleys were raised up it put everybody on the same plane because all all men are without excuse praise God John the Baptist preaching just put it all on the same level everybody needs to repent and Herod even honored John the Baptist in some things but not in the important things praise God God help us let's listen to brother Brandon let's listen to God's Prophet but let's obey all the word of God hallelujah right we see all these people say well just press play and yeah we should listen to the tapes in the quietness of our room but what about forgiving what about repenting of all your sins especially worshiping man like brother Branham right worshiping brother Brandon worshiping Joseph or worshiping Milly power worshiping the tapes or worshiping your pastor or something like that yeah let's obey the most important things amen Jesus said you must obey all the way to your matters of the law praise God judgment Justice Mercy amen hallelujah let's obey what's the most important praise God hallelujah see they might they major on a minor it's good to press play in the quietness of your home I do it in the quietness of my drive to church or the quietness of when I'm washing dishes but that don't get exalted above the fivefold ministry sit down and put brother and brat back in his place but man the Bible never said to do that nor did Brother Brown ever say to do that I sent Joseph the message the other day I said why are you saying change why are you saying change the ministry when brother Brown said don't change a thing I'm still waiting for my reply here see because when you have the truth you're not afraid to answer questions that's what I found it's easy to put stuff out but now let's take some questions here that's what they don't want they don't want questions just follow me and give me your money that's what people want that's not what we want we want to follow Christ and serve other people how many one do that by God's grace so think about that you know that's a whole other thought I'd like to get into that at some point how can we six months be greater than 40 years speaking squirrels seeing the hand of God right Ten Commandments on two tables of stone watching God's hand do it but somehow it was greater because Jesus Christ said so Hallelujah a church I was this was my chapter of the morning you know Proverbs 21. so I thought wow this is a pretty nice chapter to read I'm going to preach on leadership he that filed after righteousness so see if you're being led you're going somewhere and if we're following Christ if we're following his leading then we know where we're going we're going towards righteousness that's integrity right right doing what's right you're not going to be a liar you're not going to be a swindler you're not going to be a deceiver now you're going to make mistakes you're going to tell that you're going to do we're all going to make mistakes but you're gonna say Jesus forgive me try me again Hallelujah drive me again Lord amen and you're on the path Jesus had led you to what he's leading you to Mercy and to eternal life amen amen amen hallelujah is leading you to heaven Hallelujah he's leading you to a life of Integrity showing Mercy on other people now I don't have the verse in front of me but I read it the other day in Proverbs the Bible said a real king shows mercy and I'm just paraphrasing like any King can lead and oh one mistake cut off their heads right any King could do that right but Proverbs says a real King has Mercy on others yes he exercises judgment but he also must show Mercy right now we're all glad God is a god he's a god of Mercy praise God if not he'd all get rid of us now I was studying uh the Zuzu Street Revival I'm gonna preach on the Zuzu Street Revival pretty soon pretty powerful stuff there pretty powerful stuff and it can really help us it could really help us but William Seymour at the beginning of his ministry when the Holy Ghost first fell he was real hard on Saint vacation so he was taught under uh preachers that taught Wesley's sanctification and so at when the Holy Ghost fell you know it fell because they prayed seven hours a day seven hours a day now that's not always what has to happen right because corneos we know he prayed gave alms fasted but we don't know how much the Bible never says Thou shalt pray seven hours a day then thou shall get the Holy Ghost the bible say that God fills you when you're empty and no man knows the number of hours but just this is the point if you want a great Revival you got to put a lot of investment into it yeah right but he was so strict at the beginning right when the Holy Ghost fell Church they had three services every day for three years think about that think about the times where think about the times where you can't wait to get back to church right that feeling okay and I mean twice on Sunday twice on Sunday most churches do once on Sunday right we're one of the few that does too but think about that think about the love you have oh I can't wait to come back to the evening service what a move of God right they had that re-services for seven days a week for three years because they kept coming back you couldn't keep them away and there's pictures they could I think they could fit 800 in that building and then they said there was 500 out in the outside waiting but he eventually got you know after three years he got to this point where he was preaching if you don't say Sanctified you've lost your salvation now he was wrong but he was on to something because we know Judas fell away right and God says in the Old Testament Moses said blot my name out and God said no I'll blot out the names of those who sinned against me so people can lose their testimony and lose salvation he was onto something but but when he when he he was going too hard on that during the Revival and people just started leaving because they needed what they needed Mercy Church you and I can only we could only maintain Revival for so long right if you don't know just get about eight kids you'll find out you you can only maintain a Revival for so long or just get two kids or whatever just get one just get one they you know what I'm saying is they keep you up all night you know they got to take the diapers and you got to do all these things they just wear you out get a few nights where you don't have sleep how excited are you going to go to church you know it's just it's brother I've said a revival can only lasts about three four years a man's Ministry the first three four years sometimes that's where you see the great move and they just got to maintain after that that's how I mean John Wesley did a great job for 88 years you know that was a powerful job he might have been the the exception to the ruler I don't know I haven't studied his life enough but see Seymour had to learn Mercy and by the end of it right before he died he was preaching to us they were down to 20 people imagine that you had you had 800 people every week for three years but because of your then he made some mistakes every man does no pastor's perfect yeah thank God they said that amen then they'll forgive me if I make a mistake they won't vote me out because I Repent I'll make it right but by the end he was down to 20 people per service and he was telling the people he would say do not seek the gift seek The Giver because he saw all these people speak in tongues and Fall Away they were only seeking an experience a one-time experience rather than a lifetime of leadership you say it like that and he learned Mercy by the end the beginning it was like if you backslide if you do this you're going to hell you lost it now there's some truth to that but he went too hard on it people started leaving Revival leaves they had all these schisms they had so much Unity that was a time where there was segregation between white and blacks but he brought everybody together and that's why God blessed it was such a time of unity but then God brought divisions these preachers it was it's funny and every time they'd lock out a preacher if they didn't like what the preacher said they wait till he leave to eat and then they lock the door when you come back he couldn't get back in to preach anymore it happened they just did it over and over again they didn't see more when he first got there the church locked him out and then he had to lock other preachers out and we just was division after division after division Strife strive Strife strive strife the Satan attacked the unity of the church but by the end he learned God's God of Mercy and seek to know Christ he yeah he said let the evidence be the fruits of the spirit that was so powerful he said Let It Be love amen let it be loving your heart for other people to serve them praise God that was his message at the end it was beautiful I mean it's a beautiful lesson we can learn from these these brothers I mean especially with the lens of the message the hour I mean it's three works of Grace they were so close Charles parnam was a white man uh Seymour was a black man white uh he and that's the one who Seymour got taught under and he taught he was the first one to preach three works of Grace but he said the third work is speaking in tongues he was so close he had two out of three but that's better than the lutherans they just had one right better than the the wesleyans they just had two but see what a great blessing we can learn from the message of the hour see we're being led and we're going somewhere Christ is leading us he's leading us to righteousness look at this Mercy life and then he says again righteousness and honor Hallelujah so what does that mean I'm not making a Doctrine or anything but look at that double righteousness we talk about a double anointing right here give me uh give me a double portion of your spear there we go that's what it is oh Lord give me a double portion give me a double portion how about a double portion of righteousness help me to be double righteous to this week and be totally a man or woman of Integrity for Christ I'll take that over speaking in tongues twice I'll take that any day I appreciate that uh the women would say it's like they had a jar inside him and then it burst and that this tongues just came out that's beautiful but what about the rest of the week what about when somebody goes against your idea what about when somebody calls you a name how are you going to respond give me a righteous Heart Lord God give me a righteous heart I set my time okay I'm on that 48 minutes okay so I set my timer for an hour so when we follow Christ as Kings and Priests we find all these blessings right the king's heart is in the hands of the Lord as the rivers of water he turneth it with orsoever he will so this is a good King right now we know God can control the evil Kings too he can cause them to give uh he can cause him to keep the word of God like Nebuchadnezzar and everything like that servants in the hand of God but this is what we want our hearts to be we want our hearts to be like water so God can turn us whatever way he wants to lead us Lord I really you're turning me to be more of a servant praise God you're turning me to focus focus more on prayer you're turning me to to focus more on reaching out to other people being a help and blessing to them how many would say that Lord turn my heart as you turn the waters praise God turn my heart if I'm going the wrong direction Lord just turn my heart because I want to be a king I want to be I want to be an example of leadership somebody can look at and say God just turned his heart towards something I can follow that kind of that type of a leader because God's leading me to that my heart is opening to this right my heart is changing Hallelujah God help our hearts to change Amen to be more like Christ it's a beautiful thought because we are Kings and Priests unto God we know that Revelation went out to preach that again I've preached 125 sermons on the Book of Revelation you've all been patiently sat through and enjoyed it by God's grace remember we read this a few weeks ago you know we are Kings and Priests by Christ let us offer therefore I'm sorry therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruits of our lips giving thanks to his name now we're talking about leadership if you want to be a great leader let God move your heart right to his plan and make sure your mouth is always giving God praise continually right so just like we said thanking God whatever situation we're in whether we're in a Temptation like I was talking with amen if you're in the Temptation or if you're you're being hedged about and you're not really battled with many Temptations God has you hedged like job and protection or if you're coming up to a temptation right if you know if something's coming I feel something Stern things are get a little strange here if you're coming up to a Temptation let's do what the Bible says I thank God in every place I'm at I thank God God's going to guide me here I feel something coming on or I'm in the midst of fires this seems awful this is hard but I'm still going to give God praise Hallelujah the midst of the trial praise God or if it feels like all the enemies are under my feet I'll give God praise I'll say hallelujah thank you Jesus amen thank God for a Mountaintop experience Hallelujah we sure ought to enjoy those like I said you better enjoy your mountaintops because you're gonna have some valleys grab some dark valleys but the same Christ that's with you in the valley will be with you on the Mountaintop but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased so God is pleased when you praise him when you do good things and when you communicate right and God is well pleased now remember Church God loves us God loves you he died for you praise God and you can know God as well pleased when you do these things when you make the sacrifice I'm going to praise God in the midst of my trial I'm going to do good today I'm not going to do evil you know you can go to sleep at the at that at night time you can look yourself in the mirror and say thank God God's well pleased with my life I've done good today right I praise God all throughout the day and then I've communicated I forgot the definition of that brother Matt do you happen to know that at this moment the Greek definition of communicate is it really praise God Amen that's that's felister that's right yes I preached on it yeah the financial element that's right that's right thank you let's give him two claps Hallelujah yeah somebody emailed me about that a few weeks ago and I was like I know that what is that I'm like Get Out of My Head you know yeah so you know Lord I've given my tithes and offerings or I've helped out the poor today now you're not bragging but you're just being honest it's the end of the day Lord I know you're pleased with me and remember don't trust your feelings we looked at that last week right your feelings are lying to you all the time look at what God says about you don't trust your feelings they'll betray you all the time all the time and then obey so here's leadership so when you obey the Lord you're actually following his leadership right obey them to have the rule over you so obey the preaching when it's according to the word right you don't have to obey my testimonies because God might not work with you in that way you know he might but he might not obey my human mistakes obey the word of God right and look at my life the Bible said we're father the ministers are examples if you see a good example in my life follow that praise God and submit yourselves to the word for they watch for the ministers they watch over your souls as they might give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you now I've said this many times but on the day of judgment I've got to stand there with my art my church and I've either got to be I've got to give a good account of some of your lives I got to give a sad account of your lives right but don't don't forget someone's going to give account of my life the Lord Jesus is going to give a cow to my life right but God has ministers right the Bible says it and then fathers you got to give account of your homes right you got to give an account over your stewardship right so live in a way that you want the pastor to say something good about you on the day judgment right I would live in such a way that you know my brothers and sisters the congregation will say something good about me on the day of judgment praise God live in such a wonderful way that everybody knows you're led by the Holy Spirit because you're a servant Hallelujah we got to give an account when we follow Christ we follow spiritual blessings he that loveth father a mother more than me is not worthy of me I love Christ more than any family member and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me anyone that will put family above the word of God doesn't love Christ he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy so leadership see so you want to be a good leader you got to take up a cross and follow Christ if they take up a slow death the cross is a slow death we gotta each each day we have to Die daily take up that cross Die daily don't be tempted by money that's a cross you got to crucify that desire right don't be tempted by lust you got to crucify that desire don't be tempted by uh jealousy got to crucify that desire don't be tempted by gossip you got to crucify that desire and you got to follow Christ don't be tempted by social media you gotta crucify that desire praise God don't don't be tempted by anything praise God overcome the Temptation I'm saying we can't help being tempted but overcome every Temptation don't give in to any Temptation praise God forgive me and again Jesus said in other places if a man will come after me if a man really wants to be led by the holy spirit let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me every day daily each day you take up a cross each day you're gonna something has to die out your desires my desires have to die out and that's fulfilling what Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God in his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you praise God and I'm trying to get down here to close I got about a couple minutes here um brother Brown labors on this thought being saved is accepting Christ's leadership that's just a just a summary of it you know when we repent of our sins we confess our sins except Jesus Christ as Savior our sins are thrown the sea of forgetfulness what we've really done is accepted the leadership of the Holy Spirit right well Brian said Moses chose to go with that group instead of being called the king son look at that see because he was he's seen the end time see that rich young man but he's seen Jesus like we have see him in a vision that the end time is what is going to pay now he accepted Christ's leadership and Moses esteemed the reproach greater Treasures so Chris just got saved a couple months ago God bless him amen he chose Christ leadership rather than his moms or his dads oh no he we appreciate all the human leadership But ultimately somebody's leading you right it's either me the devil or it's going to be Christ and Chris accepted Christ's leadership praise God what a blessing amen hallelujah and we'd rather go through we'd rather go through the suffering of being a Christian than enjoy pleasures of sin for a season that ultimately lead to death and destruction in God's Wrath we want God's mercy not God's Wrath Hallelujah so salvation is choosing the leadership of Christ Joshua is a godsend prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed a full leadership in Joshua's hands because he stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the other so it will repeat in this end day the same problem the same pressures see God's leaders they Faithfully obey the word they stay with the word of God Hallelujah if it says it in here then we've got to stay with it praise God we've got to stay with the word of God that's how you know a real leader a real leader will stay with the scripture and not with their own human opinion right now we know Bishops or pastors they must be blameless see they have to say with with the word so much that people see them as blameless there there's so much under the leadership of Christ that you can't put a finger on their life and blame them for something see and God don't ask you to file a leader that's not blame us God asks you to follow somebody who's Faithfully following Christ I love this uh Nehemiah said I gave my brother Hannah Hannah and I and hananiah the ruler of the palace charged over Jerusalem why did you do that Nehemiah because he was a faithful man and he feared God above many praise God remember we preached on that a few months ago the fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord is everything the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life the fear of the Lord is a strong tower of praise God the fear of the Lord is that apart from Evil praise God it's the beginning of wisdom praise God and Jesus was anointed with this with the fear of the Lord the Bible said he was quick in the fear of the Lord hallelujah so being a leader is obeying and you obey by being fearful of the Lord being respectful of the Lord recognizing his presence knowing that his promises are true he's going to keep his word hallelujah we want faithful leaders who obey the word of God they stay with the word because they fear the lord more than man that's why I don't care what people say brother Jesse believes the messenger brother Jesse don't believe the message I don't care the message is God's word and I believe God's word I believe the message I don't believe your opinion of the message right so I don't care what anybody says I know in my life I know how I live and I want to be a faithful like these leaders I want to be blameless I want to stand on God's word praise God I want to say what the spirit tells me to say praise God and how do I know it'll be lined up with God's word how you know it'll line up with God's word there's my hour so let me bring this down here yeah I'm just uh let's see I'm just going to skip ahead let me just close to this let me give me five give me five minutes to close here my wife's like yeah right I want to just start getting into Solomon because I had this request somebody requested I look at Solomon's life and I've I just preach on David's lifestyle I'd like to look a little more or David's uh uh David's dancing and so forth like that a little more David and the Ark returning and so I wanted to get into Solomon as well but let's look at Solomon's leadership now Church look at him he was born in the leadership position most of us are not going to be born like that he's born into it like I'm going to be king there's just no I don't have a choice I've got to make decisions over millions of people most of us are not born there how many can say thank God I'm not born under that right brother I said don't you ever wish you were a prophet right and we we wouldn't wish that right because they have so much responsibility right and then suffering look at Jeremiah suffering look at Isaiah's suffering most of them were killed right most of them were murdered martyred look at Paul look at I mean being a prophet not a glamorous thing at all to see Solomon was born in this he had no choice I'll get your Bibles ready I'm gonna we're just gonna read a few scriptures here as we close so Solomon had to trust his father's leading about his life's purpose now look church he don't even have a choice about what he's supposed to do now he really did but you know it was already laid out Solomon you were born your beloved your name means beloved your love of God God loves you but God is calling you to build a house right the Sea church that's how we are too you know we have a choice we can either do God's will or we cannot do God's will Solomon could have said well I want to do something else I don't really want to build a house I want to I want to dig a a channel I want to build boats or something he could he could've done anything he wanted to do but it was already kind of set up like this is what Dad said to do looks like God's leading this way and he had a choice what was he going to be led by all right so do we we have a choice in fact it's already been laying out too the word of God's already been laying out for our lives we just have to accept the word of God and so see we've got to trust our Heavenly father's leadership about our purpose in life praise God so this is the main thing I just want to end with this because this is what I'm going to start with looking at Solomon's life here the first thing to find for Solomon was to find the vision or you could say or find the direction or find the Revelation for his life right and at first Chronicles 28 11. let's turn there First Chronicles 28 11. just a simple thought here this morning have you been blessed today all right praise God that's good to hear First Chronicles 28 11. then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch now look he got it from who from his dad his dad already had the blueprints laid out on the porch the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and the upper chambers thereof and the inner parlors thereof and the place of The Mercy Seat look at that there's the porch the houses the treasuries The upper chambers parlors and The Mercy Seat look at verse 12 and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit see where did David get all these things from the spirit and of the Courts of the house of the Lord the chambers round about the treasury of the house of God and the treasuries of the dedicated things there's ten things right there this was a detailed pattern samica said wow this is overwhelming or he could have said well if God called me to it if God birthed me here God knew what he's doing and I'll overcome by God's grace if God brought me to this God will bring me through this praise God verse 12 we read that verse 18. and for the altar of incense refined go by way and go for the pattern of The Chariot of the cherubims and the spread and that spread out their wings and covered the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord again the word pattern so there's the holiest of holies right and verse 19. and all this said David the Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me well look at that wow the Lord was moving my my pen the Lord moved me to draw this out the Lord did all this designing even all the works of this pattern so where do leaders how do they know what to do whether you're going to build something whether they're going to write something write a music or make a YouTube video or write a book whatever gonna do where do you find it you got to find inspiration you got to find the vision first from the pattern that you receive from the Lord Jesus Christ you've got to find the pattern of your life the vision of your life has to come from Heaven first praise God that's what Solomon received he received it from his father he had to trust that his father had the right pattern how do you know because his father was a man after God's Own Heart hallelujah thank God despite his mistakes church and the church said despite murder adultery numbering the people just by those mistakes he still to trust he was still a man after God's Own Heart how do you know because he repented of that praise God he didn't do that again church God will always make the vision plain so Simon couldn't say well Lord I don't know what you to do or I don't know what I'm supposed to do God made it plain for Solomon to be this great leader the wisest leader now I'd still say maybe John the Baptist was wiser because of what Jesus said but we get these sayings among ourselves you know Solomon was the wisest of all time well he wasn't wiser than Jesus right and he wasn't as great as a man as John the Baptist John the Baptist was greater than all of them so I just want to you know try to be balanced but see God will make it so plain that we are without excuse Paul said in remember in Romans 2 16 in that day God shall judge every seeker of man's Hearts according to my gospel every person here every person uh over there watching the playoff game the football game every person at the at the restaurant every person at Applebee's every person at Walmart right now will be judged by the same pattern Paul's Epistles and God always makes it plain go to habakkuk too this is just such a glorious scripture habakkuk Zephaniah Hagia and Zechariah there it is wow Hallelujah Abacus 2 1-3 I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved he knew he's going to be corrected if you know chapter one he was rebuking God he was mad at God and then God rebuked him verse two and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it so it had to be so plain a man could look at it understand it and then go run with that message right for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though what Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tear it of course this is referring to Israel but we can look at this and we can see God's pattern in this God always gives a word so we can run the race in Hebrews 12 by laying aside every sin that so doth easily beset us praise God man it's so plain right love the Lord your God with all your heart you can summarize in so many ways love God with all your heart and love your neighbors yourself or follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit be led by Christ every single day he'll lead you to righteousness I mean we can sum it up in so many ways but the point is first we must have the revelation and God makes it so plain Proverbs 29 18 we don't have to read it but he says without a vision the people perish Solomon would have perished in this ability to build a temple if he had not received the vision and the instruction from his father David but thank God God was faithful if God calls you to do anything he's going to supply you with everything you have need of to finish the work and to please God hallelujah Paul made the vision plain too his whole life was a pattern in first Timothy 1 16 I'm going to read that this is the portion where he said I was a blasphemer but I did it ignorantly that's why God can forgive me if I blaspheme before I became a Christian God can forgive each one of us how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them which should hear after believe on him to everlasting life so God was very long-suffering to say Paul that's a pattern God will be long-suffering with you God's not going to give up on you God's patient with you he's going to save you he's going to bring your life to a complete estate he's going to make your life glorify him praise God as you submit to God God will make your life glorify him he's made it plain Paul made it plain by writing all those Epistles and then church our pattern our Our Lives should be a pattern of good works you should see wow this brother well he did that last week he did it again this week he was faithful last week he was faithful last month he was faithful last year look at him this year he's so she she's so faithful wow what a pattern a good works they Faithfully teach Sunday school or they Faithfully do this or they Faithfully it's a pattern of good works see that's how you know you've received the vision from Heaven because your life is a pattern Hallelujah your life is an expression of that Vision praise God people can see the pattern in your life and they know you've seen God's pattern amen I'm not quite saying it right but you understand Hallelujah your life gives a pattern your life expresses the pattern of the master Hallelujah so brother Branham gave us that see the pattern of Paul's gospel was laid out to us by Brother Branham like I said Charles Barnum I got to have tongues in the third step brother man come in and said brother said that's my message of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother said the Holy Ghost will only point you to the word so the pattern of today is point us to the word back to the word I got a problem go back to the word I've got struggles back to the word I'm sick go back to the word everything's back to the word that's the pattern we have Paul's gospel will meet all of our needs praise God because it was Christ Revelation to us hallelujah and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against this Revelation this pattern this direction so what do we want to do we want to be careful Builders right the Bible says wisdom hath builded her house right wisdom has builded the house so these are scriptures wisdom builds the house I think about sisters how they build the atmosphere of the house while the the husband's away working they build the atmosphere of the home right of course speaking of Solomon he was building a house of God and then Paul said let every preacher be careful how he builds upon the foundation that he laid see we're all building something right and we got to build by the wisdom of the Holy Ghost this is the last verse go to First Kings 3. I'm closing with this first king three this is my clothes First Kings 3. so hard just getting these places you know you just want to say in the presence of God first Kings 3 verse 3. this is the prayer God loved Lord you've called me to be a leader of the church that's my prayer for the husbands Lord you've called me to be a leader of my wife and children sisters could say Lord you call me to be a leader of my home and the children and guiding the house teenagers can say you've called me to be a leader of my younger younger siblings right you call me to be leader of my other friends who are teenagers First Kings 3 3. let's remember today this beautiful prayer church if you need to you can pray this prayer yourself God loves a prayer like this and Solomon loved the Lord how many love the Lord today and he walked in the statutes of David's father no of course not not his whole life at this time he was walking he was keeping the commands only he sacrificed and burned incense in high places and the King went to gibeon remember we looked at that how the sacrifices were in gibeon but David had the holy place in holiest in Jerusalem so he went to giving the sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand word offerings that Solomon offer upon that altar so he wasn't a stingy giver when it come to ties and offerings Hallelujah and in gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night and God said ask what I should give you now notice God comes to him after his sacrifice of praise that's when God will come to you and look so there it is Solomon Drew nigh unto God and so God Drew nigh unto him see he had to leave where he lived he had to leave where that was he had to go out to meet God he had to make great sacrifices and but that's where he met God ask what I shall give you what a question what do you want Solomon what the Holy Spirit was here today and said what do you want brother Chris now before you answer pray about it Hallelujah sister Beatrice what do you want what the Holy Spirit was here today it reminds us of brother and how do you write doesn't it another reminder for that whatever you say you'll have it God did the same thing see he's the same yesterday today and forever ask whatever you want I'll give you all your hair back if it's the bald man you know whatever you want I'll give it back the biggest muscles the longest life ask whatever you want and see if it isn't given to you right now right verse 6 and Solomon said thou has showed unto thy servant David my father great Mercy see he saw God's forgiveness in his life according as he has walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and uprightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day look at this just to stop for a moment look how kind God was to a murderer look how kind God was to an adulterer look how kind God is in just in general Church don't ever think that God's not going to be kind to you just repent of your sins just come back to Christ remember he's going to throw all that in the sea of forgetfulness yes there's consequences on this side but I'll say like this there's really no consequences on that side praise God he said God you are still kind to my father your kindness never left him Hallelujah verse seven and now oh Lord my God thouest made thy servant King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or to come and look at the humility in this prayer you've been kind to my dad your kindness never left my dad and I'm just a child I'm a nobody at church we can all pray that can't we we're just a tiny little church where nobody we're not a big Message Church we're not a mega church we're nobody but that's who God can work with yes God can work with big churches too I'm not saying he can't but I'm just saying let's let's relate to the humility of this prayer let's see how we can be humble today and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this so great of people and the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing this is a prayer God loves thank God for the mercy you've seen in your life and your parents humble yourself and then say God help me just to know right and wrong in my life isn't that beautiful in other words help me to follow your leadership praise God help me to choose your leadership and God said because thou has asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life neither has asked riches for thyself nor has asked the life of thine enemies but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment I just want to do what's right I just want to treat people fairly I just want to treat everybody the same as God would treat them behold I have done unto or done according to thy words lo I have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any rise like unto thee and I have also given thee that which thou Hast not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee all thy days and if thou Wilt walk in my ways and keep my statutes and my Commandments as thy father David did walk then I will lengthen thy days and Solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all the servants let us stand musicians can come praise God the prayer that God loved God
