[41:08] know me if it
[41:09] hurts amen well just let me know that
[41:12] you're with me praise the Lord yes sir
[41:15] now if you have your Bibles very
[41:17] familiar scripture reading to us we want
[41:20] to uh read out of the Book of Joel and
[41:24] if you'll turn there with me this
[41:26] morning morning into the second chapter
[41:27] of
[41:35] Joel somehow another when I pray my eyes
[41:37] leak I don't know why that
[41:39] is Glory
[41:44] uh the old song of the church said that
[41:47] tears are language only God
[41:50] understands so I guess I was speaking in
[41:52] Tong while I was yes sir sir all right
[41:56] yes sir
[41:59] amen now in Joel's
[42:05] uh gospel we'll call it it's good news
[42:08] isn't it right yes sir and we want to be
[42:10] in chapter
[42:12] two and
[42:17] uh I want to start reading at Verse
[42:22] 18 just so it'll lead us into this uh
[42:26] Prophecy of the
[42:28] restoration amen and in verse 18 it says
[42:32] and then will the Lord be jealous over
[42:34] his
[42:35] land and pity his people
[42:40] that's and where we we we instantly
[42:44] begin to see the
[42:46] possessiveness of God that he's
[42:50] identifying the people and the land as
[42:53] his personal possessions
[42:57] right y the Lord will answer and say
[43:00] unto his people right behold I will send
[43:04] you corn and
[43:06] wine and oil yes so we realize that corn
[43:11] is
[43:11] word wine is stimulation a
[43:15] revelation and the oil is the spirit of
[43:18] God Amen all right so we see these types
[43:22] that we could not we could not declare
[43:25] these types to you
[43:27] emphatically as thus sayith the Lord had
[43:30] we not heard these things from a
[43:32] Vindicated Prophet amen I'm glad that
[43:36] I'm not standing here waiting on my
[43:37] theology to kick in praise God Amen but
[43:40] I know that my neology will work every
[43:43] timeall and I know that the word of God
[43:46] is true and he says here that and ye
[43:50] shall be satisfied therewi amen are we
[43:55] satisfied with the word of God are we
[43:58] satisfied with the revelation of that
[44:00] word are we satisfied with his life
[44:04] praise God he said I will no more make
[44:07] you a reproach among the Heathen but I
[44:11] will remove far off from you the
[44:15] northern Army and I will drive them into
[44:17] the land Barren and desolate with his
[44:20] face towards the east sea and his hinder
[44:23] part toward the uttermost sea and his
[44:26] stink shall come up and his ill uh Savor
[44:30] shall come up because he hath done great
[44:33] things fear not o land be glad and
[44:37] rejoice for the Lord will do great
[44:40] things Be not Afraid the beasts of the
[44:42] field for the pastures of the Wilderness
[44:47] do spring for the tree beareth her fruit
[44:50] the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their
[44:54] strength
[44:56] be glad then ye children of Zion so it's
[44:59] speaking of both Jew and
[45:02] Gentile he said and be glad ye uh
[45:06] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[45:08] your God for he hath given you the
[45:11] former Reign moderately and he will
[45:13] cause to come down for you the rain the
[45:16] former uh rain and the latter rain in
[45:20] the first month yes so we see now that
[45:23] the so so what's happening is the is the
[45:26] serwer and the and the reaper are
[45:29] overrunning each other amen what is that
[45:31] telling us amen that there's a that
[45:33] there's a reaping that's going to take
[45:35] place in Israel to those four those but
[45:39] there's a sewing of the word to Israel
[45:42] but there's also a reaping of the
[45:44] Gentile bride so one the former and the
[45:46] latter range speak of a sewing rain and
[45:48] a reaping rain all in the same season so
[45:51] we see what's happening friends it's a
[45:54] we're we're actually re we're actually
[45:57] uh uh preventing the word to go to
[46:00] Israel by our presence here that's right
[46:03] amen Oho something's got to be happening
[46:07] oh if we could see what was happening in
[46:09] the Supernatural realm and the floors
[46:13] shall be full of wheat speaking of the
[46:15] reaping
[46:16] time and the vat shall overflow with
[46:19] wine and oil so we're at the season of
[46:22] the spirit and the revelation of the
[46:25] world word that has come in its full
[46:28] harvest season amen and watch what he
[46:31] says here in verse 25 for our text and I
[46:34] will restore unto you the years that the
[46:38] locusts have eaten and the korm and the
[46:42] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[46:45] Army which i s among you and you shall
[46:48] eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[46:49] praise the name of the Lord your God you
[46:52] see what he's he's talking about here is
[46:54] a restored worship
[46:56] amen yes amen and you shall eat in PL
[46:59] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[47:02] your God that hath dealt wondrously with
[47:05] you and my people shall never be
[47:08] ashamed may the Lord bless the reading
[47:10] of the word yes you make yourselves
[47:12] comfortable this
[47:21] [Music]
[47:23] morning I would like to
[47:27] title the message this
[47:31] morning
[47:34] uh
[47:40] restoring get up here to my page the re
[47:44] uh the I change that the
[47:49] resurrection of true worship from
[47:52] Extinction amen and we like to sub title
[47:56] it the way of
[47:59] God here this morning we we're
[48:02] just such a tremendous text that we
[48:05] would read yes sir many areas of uh
[48:09] study that we could go
[48:12] into there this morning but
[48:20] I want
[48:23] to start with this one thought and we
[48:27] got a lot of as I said a lot on my Fork
[48:30] here but
[48:32] where where job is talking about that I
[48:35] will restore unto
[48:37] you all these years or all the damage
[48:42] brother B preached to us a couple of
[48:44] messages where he dealt with the Palmer
[48:46] worm and the canker worm yes and the
[48:48] brid tree and what more we had spent a
[48:51] lot of time on that but just in a
[48:54] nutshell he showed how each one of these
[48:58] insects was actually a different stage
[49:01] of the same bug yes and it started out
[49:05] in its infancy and then how that it
[49:06] matured into its final stage in the
[49:10] Palmer worm right and that each one of
[49:13] these bugs had a certain effect upon the
[49:18] tree that it had that it had infested
[49:21] yes and it had started off eating the
[49:24] fruit and then the leaves
[49:26] and down uh into the into the bark and
[49:29] into the very life of the tree it had it
[49:32] had reduced the tree to a
[49:35] stump that tree he tells us was the
[49:38] bride tree yeah and he brings it down in
[49:42] stages now brother Adam had a way of
[49:46] bringing these things of Realms ages
[49:50] dispensations all these different things
[49:52] and sometimes you can't really draw
[49:55] timeline and and put all these lines in
[49:58] there if you did you would have so much
[50:00] overlaid on each other you wouldn't be
[50:02] able to make any sense of it and so uh
[50:05] the best way that I can uh we we have
[50:07] what we have an icon on our computer and
[50:10] then under that icon there will be a
[50:13] window and then inside of that window
[50:15] there will be links that will take us to
[50:18] different windows and we can go deeper
[50:19] and deeper and deeper into the thought
[50:22] as we click on the link is that right
[50:25] yeah and so only in this age did God
[50:27] send us a prophet that would preach us a
[50:29] message that would actually have that
[50:32] kind of an effect right when the actual
[50:35] computer would actually be designed so
[50:37] that we could give that as an example
[50:38] the two run concurrent with each other
[50:41] tells us that we see modern
[50:43] achievements and as there's a modern
[50:45] achievement is uh uh comes to being he
[50:49] said then that's exactly what God is
[50:51] doing in the church amen and so as the
[50:55] church then has advanced in certain
[50:58] areas like you gave the example of the
[51:01] ox and coming up through the uh the the
[51:04] the car and then from the car to the
[51:07] airplane and the airplane to the
[51:08] astronaut you're showing us this
[51:10] advancement of technology and so we we
[51:13] confuse that pattern throughout the
[51:15] Bible and throughout the message it just
[51:18] you you just see how the advancement of
[51:21] of of of uh of of technology or uh photo
[51:26] uh photography or uh whatever it might
[51:30] be each one of these advancements will
[51:32] just show how that the church has
[51:35] actually advanced in in in in in in in
[51:38] in its uh uh understanding and
[51:40] revelation of the word so
[51:44] amen he gives us these insects and they
[51:47] as they destroyed so he starts back at
[51:51] Ephesus and brings it through what
[51:53] brother Ram called for four death
[51:56] Messengers right and these four death
[51:59] Messengers brought the church down to
[52:03] the time of
[52:06] Luther now that he says is four death
[52:09] Messengers brought the church down he
[52:13] said then so also it'll take four life
[52:16] Messengers to bring the church back to a
[52:20] restoration so and so we see that at the
[52:24] time of the
[52:25] uh uh Reformation of the church under
[52:28] Luther Wesley Pentecost there's your
[52:31] three first three stages but then the
[52:34] fourth stage of the life messenger then
[52:38] would would come as the prophet to the
[52:41] Gentiles and that he would actually
[52:44] restore the church back into its full uh
[52:48] manifestation it's full understanding of
[52:50] the word everything that was lost in
[52:53] Paul's day would be rest stored back in
[52:56] our day amen so we see this and so
[53:00] that's why we want to call it the
[53:04] resurrection of true worship from
[53:08] extinction because we realize that what
[53:10] it had what the church was in the day of
[53:14] Pentecost by the time we get to Luther's
[53:17] age it was a a dead church right it was
[53:21] completely it was dead to the point
[53:25] there was almost no life left in it enti
[53:29] time but then we find in Luther's age a
[53:31] little light be to Spring out in a
[53:34] restoration and then now it's being
[53:36] restored back in a process and now we're
[53:39] coming right to the end time where the
[53:42] scripture says that it would be so close
[53:45] that it would deceive the very elected
[53:48] if it was possible amen and so that now
[53:50] that we have a h a a church with
[53:54] character istics of the true church but
[53:57] yet inside of that individual that the
[54:01] life would be missing brother says I
[54:04] don't care how right you are in your
[54:05] Doctrine he said if you miss that life
[54:08] you miss it that's all so we want not
[54:12] just to be an outward appearance a form
[54:16] of godliness but we want to have the
[54:18] very power of the word in our hearts
[54:21] amen you love the Lord this morning
[54:23] Hallelujah yes
[54:27] so we want to use a Bible example
[54:31] here just because it it it fits so well
[54:36] we find that job the Bible says that job
[54:41] was a perfect man yes don't you wish you
[54:45] had that testimony yes sir and so here
[54:48] was job and and brother tells us all
[54:50] about job's life and how that he visited
[54:53] the Widow and the Bible tells us these
[54:55] things and we find that he visited the
[54:58] the the fatherless and the Widow and the
[55:00] and the and that he was sight to the
[55:03] Blind and he was all these things and he
[55:05] was a he was a generous man he was a
[55:08] wealthy man he was a upstanding man the
[55:10] Bible says that that he shoot evil amen
[55:13] you know that word to shoot means to
[55:14] turn it off
[55:17] amen amen just turned it off yes just
[55:21] hit the off button there and uh so when
[55:25] evil showed itself he just turned it off
[55:27] amen oh man we take a lesson from that
[55:30] praise God and so we we we we find that
[55:33] that job now that that his his worship
[55:38] was was so impeccable his integrity was
[55:43] so to the point that that that that that
[55:47] God actually used him as an example of
[55:53] every believer as to as to what God
[55:56] could do in that individual's life and
[55:59] he took job to the very
[56:01] extremes and we we would wonder why a
[56:04] man that was perfect a man that is shoot
[56:07] evil a man that was that was had
[56:09] integrity and these kind of things that
[56:11] God would allow Satan to attach himself
[56:15] to that man's life in such a way that it
[56:18] would destroy his children it would
[56:20] cause his wife to turn on him that it
[56:23] would cause his church board directors
[56:25] Amen to to stand and with and and not
[56:28] even speak to job for seven days while
[56:32] he sat there amen with ooing sores
[56:36] all over his body with infection running
[56:38] out of his his body fever running
[56:41] through his
[56:42] body no doubt the man was in absolute
[56:46] misery but yet nobody landed a hand to
[56:49] help it the Bible says that job said in
[56:52] an ash Heath amen with a broken piece of
[56:54] potard and he had take the he would
[56:57] scrape the heads off the boils and we
[57:00] know this by experience of what people
[57:02] used to do that he would they would
[57:04] actually have to squeeze the the puss
[57:07] and the and the infection out of those
[57:09] sores and then put the ashes on top of
[57:12] it to get some relief from the pain and
[57:15] the infection that was going through his
[57:16] body and I've seen a picture of a
[57:18] disease that looked very much like what
[57:20] job had and it was just a hideous thing
[57:22] job was very hideous
[57:25] to look at with the the sickness that
[57:27] was upon the man's life the Bible says
[57:30] that he was full of sores from the top
[57:32] of his head to the bottom of the seat
[57:34] yes sir and then here was a man that was
[57:37] in such pain and his wife you would have
[57:40] thought that she would have come and she
[57:42] would have she would have she would have
[57:44] brought a a cold cloth and laid it upon
[57:47] his
[57:48] head and then she would have said oh Joe
[57:50] this one in the middle of your back you
[57:52] can't reach it he said she would she
[57:54] said let me let me help you joob let me
[57:56] let me try to relieve some of your
[57:58] suffering right wowow but instead she
[58:01] just looked at him said you need to do
[58:03] call Dr
[58:04] Koran right brother right you call do
[58:06] death see if you you just need to curse
[58:09] God and die right what a what a pitiful
[58:13] thing to pull the plug on you Joe with
[58:16] you those keeping you around anymore I
[58:19] about what her thoughts was you're done
[58:22] you're finished there ain't no hope for
[58:23] you Joe spull the plug on you get the
[58:26] insurance
[58:28] right I mean what a heartless thought
[58:32] yes sir yes sir but yet he says woman
[58:34] you you speak like a foolish person the
[58:38] Lord gives the Lord takes
[58:41] away blessed be the name of the Lord the
[58:45] Bible says that job never accused God
[58:48] foolishly
[58:50] yes so much
[58:53] that you say say why would God allow
[58:57] this man to go through all these things
[59:00] yes but we find that there was a point
[59:03] in job's life as he sat there and monst
[59:05] of suffering and no doubt he could look
[59:08] out into the burnt field where his crop
[59:10] used to be where the scripture says a
[59:13] fire came down from heaven right
[59:15] consumed his crops he can look out in
[59:18] the and The Paddock and the pastures
[59:20] where his his donkeys and his camels had
[59:23] once grazed
[59:25] you can see that they were all gone for
[59:27] this the the the the Sabian I think it
[59:30] was came and took all of his animals
[59:32] away and killed his
[59:34] servants he can see the little little
[59:37] Huts down there and the little Barracks
[59:39] is where where his servants used to live
[59:42] and he can see out behind him the
[59:44] Tombstones where he buried his Faithful
[59:47] Servants wow he can look up on the hill
[59:49] at where there was a pavilion where the
[59:52] where where his family had built a
[59:53] pavilion and and his eldest son had a
[59:56] place up there and he could see where
[59:58] the Pavilion had was laying in Ruins yes
[1:00:03] he could see amen seven little
[1:00:05] tombstones up there right where he
[1:00:08] buried his Darlings right no D that his
[1:00:11] heart was breaking you know when you

[1:07:22] job when was buried there left a
[1:07:28] revelation of true
[1:07:32] worship that would now stay in the

[1:07:44] went and bought a piece of land that's
[1:07:46] right and when he bought that piece of
[1:07:49] land and he buried his wife there he
[1:07:52] left instruction s that they would bury

[1:07:59] going to follow this thought in the
[1:08:02] message my redeemer
[1:08:05] living He said now job when he seen this
[1:08:09] so it's talking about seeing the
[1:08:12] Redeemer and Abraham saw it so how did
[1:08:17] he see it he saw it amen when he parted
[1:08:21] the animals right and the the smoking
[1:08:24] furnace went down between them consumed
[1:08:27] the animals but he didn't part the doves
[1:08:29] remember that he was showing that it was
[1:08:32] Christ the sin Bearer he was seeing
[1:08:35] Jehovah uh the the the quickener he was
[1:08:39] seeing the one Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[1:08:41] shama he saw and he saw the vision and
[1:08:46] the type fulfilled in Isaac that job had
[1:08:51] saw when he saw the Redeemer amen I'll
[1:08:55] read it to you and Abraham saw it and he
[1:08:58] buried Sarah near job purchased the
[1:09:02] field bought it with money so that it
[1:09:05] would be assured and put a witness
[1:09:07] before it that he was assured he bought
[1:09:10] the field for a bearing place and then
[1:09:13] Abraham himself when he died he was
[1:09:17] buried with him also in the same field
[1:09:20] yes sir
[1:09:22] watch now
[1:09:24] uh I believe it's in another place and
[1:09:26] we'll get to it but brother Ram said uh
[1:09:29] I think it's right
[1:09:33] here yeah brother says
[1:09:36] Abraham job saw it in a vision and
[1:09:41] Abraham saw it by
[1:09:45] Isaac
[1:09:47] so he actually acted out what job saw in
[1:09:52] the Redeemer right amen when Jo saw the
[1:09:54] Redeemer standing upon the Earth and now
[1:09:57] where he said I know that I'm going to
[1:09:59] be in the resurrection because I saw
[1:10:01] myself there in a vision amen and
[1:10:03] Abraham knew that those Visions never
[1:10:07] failed and so he said now then because
[1:10:10] he gave me this son from the dead he
[1:10:13] said I know he'll bring him again from
[1:10:16] ashes a perfect time amen of restoring
[1:10:20] something that would gone into
[1:10:21] Extinction back into a living man
[1:10:25] estation job was going to be brought
[1:10:27] back from Extinction Abraham knew that
[1:10:29] if he was buried near uh uh job that
[1:10:33] because he could see the type that was
[1:10:35] in his own life through Isaac him being
[1:10:38] the the the H bringing forth the
[1:10:40] promised son Isaac being a type of
[1:10:43] Christ amen carrying the the the the the
[1:10:46] wood the cross upon his back amen and so
[1:10:49] he saw that in Isaac and so now then
[1:10:52] Abraham had the same same Revelation
[1:10:56] amen am Abraham be Isaac and when Isaac
[1:11:01] died he was buried with Abraham under
[1:11:04] the same
[1:11:06] vision the same thought the same deep
[1:11:10] calling to the Deep the same I know my
[1:11:14] redeemer

[1:11:18] inspiration the same worship and every
[1:11:21] time they went down they went down under
[1:11:23] that same Revelation and so we
[1:11:25] understand that in this last days that
[1:11:27] there be two groups there will be the
[1:11:30] dead in Christ and then who went down
[1:11:32] with the Revelation and they will come
[1:11:34] back up with the same Revelation they
[1:11:36] went down with it was a la your

[1:17:23] could said so much as job I know my
[1:17:26] redeemer living amen for he had seen the
[1:17:29] whole thing dramatized he had seen like
[1:17:33] like job and we read this a little bit
[1:17:36] ago but job saw it in a vision Abraham
[1:17:40] saw it by Isaac Jacob saw it by
[1:17:44] wrestling and now Joseph saw it now this
[1:17:48] is where I want to touch on for just a
[1:17:49] little bit Joseph saw it
[1:17:53] in his own life amen amen Joseph saw the
[1:17:59] Redeemer the prophecy that was given to
[1:18:02] job he saw it in his own life amen now
[1:18:08] watch boy this is good all right I can

[1:18:14] myself a good oldfashioned slobbering
[1:18:16] ball and snot and fit right here yes sir
[1:18:19] amen Joseph saw it by his own life
[1:18:24] he's seeing that he was a particular boy
[1:18:27] that he was a Seer there was something
[1:18:29] about him he could see Visions he
[1:18:31] couldn't understand it he even went and
[1:18:33] seen told his mother and father and they
[1:18:35] tried to correct him and he seen the
[1:18:36] sheaves all bowing to to bowing to his
[1:18:39] he couldn't understand it but then the
[1:18:42] next thing he found that he was betrayed
[1:18:43] by his Brethren and he said what am I
[1:18:47] portraying here right amen how many
[1:18:51] times friends yes yes sir have you
[1:18:53] looked in the face of Calamity in your
[1:18:56] own life look in the face of of failure

[1:19:03] at the face of rejection yes by
[1:19:09] betrayal wonder what part of this I
[1:19:13] betray now yes you know because we're
[1:19:16] the body of Christ beautiful yes

[1:19:27] feels the things that you feel he
[1:19:29] suffered in every way that you suffer
[1:19:31] right and so Joseph he was there
[1:19:34] betrayed of his brother in the bottom of
[1:19:35] a pit wondering why did they throw me
[1:19:39] down in here right why I didn't do
[1:19:42] anything to him and he says what am I
[1:19:44] portraying
[1:19:46] here yes sir beautiful beautiful he
[1:19:51] said what is this for knowledge that I'm
[1:19:55] receiving oh he watched his own life wow
[1:20:00] he was having a dejo or something he
[1:20:03] didn't even know what it was right yes
[1:20:05] yes because at this time in his life he
[1:20:08] knew that he was portraying something
[1:20:10] this is something but there was a vision
[1:20:12] that his brothers were going to bow down
[1:20:14] to him he knew he wasn't going to die in
[1:20:16] there he knew there was more to it Glory
[1:20:19] he knew there was a greater part but he
[1:20:21] didn't understand what part of
[1:20:24] amen beautiful when he see his life
[1:20:26] begin to move and deceived by his
[1:20:28] brothers supposing to have been killed
[1:20:31] thrown into a hole taken up again he
[1:20:34] didn't know what was happening right he
[1:20:36] had to go down in the pit yes the type
[1:20:39] of Christ the Redeemer but he didn't
[1:20:41] know it yes he just went in there
[1:20:43] wondering oh God my God my God why not
[1:20:47] forsaken
[1:20:49] amen yes taken up again saw his in
[1:20:53] prison in the dungeon went to hell
[1:20:55] preached to the souls in prison right
[1:20:58] hallelujah praise God he saw God was
[1:21:01] with him whatever he done he was the
[1:21:04] prince of prosperity the world prospered
[1:21:07] everywhere Joseph was there was
[1:21:09] prosperity for he was the prince of
[1:21:11] prosperity and him foreshadowing Christ
[1:21:16] wherever Christ there is prosperity yes
[1:21:20] now
[1:21:20] look at Joseph
[1:21:23] seeing it then when he
[1:21:27] know that he had that everything that he
[1:21:30] did he seen his brother betray him and
[1:21:32] finally come to him not knowing who he

[1:21:53] let's
[1:21:54] see finally come to him not knowing who
[1:21:57] he was bow before him reverently and
[1:21:59] those who had crucified him as it was
[1:22:03] throw him in the ground those who had

[1:22:06] Egyptians all those that mistreated him
[1:22:09] speaking of the Jews speaking of Israel
[1:22:12] speaking of Christ showing all these
[1:22:16] things and him the great Prince every
[1:22:19] knee bowed every tongue
[1:22:21] confessed and they trembled because he
[1:22:24] said we have slain our brother and all
[1:22:26] about that how that it was to be a
[1:22:31] foreshadow Joseph he knew that he would
[1:22:34] be the
[1:22:36] conditions he knew that that would be
[1:22:39] the conditions of the world at the
[1:22:41] coming of the Lord Jesus so he made
[1:22:43] mention of his
[1:22:46] bones after all of these things after it
[1:22:50] all played out he didn't understand all
[1:22:52] the way back here right but by the time
[1:22:55] it had come to the end and he had seen
[1:22:58] his life fully type out the coming
[1:23:01] Redeemer he made mention of his bones he
[1:23:04] said I've got the same Revelation that
[1:23:06] job had that Isaac had that Jacob had
[1:23:09] that that Abraham had I've got the same
[1:23:13] Revelation and I know that my redeemer
[1:23:15] live it leave my B here take them down
[1:23:18] there
[1:23:20] to I know that's where the resurrection
[1:23:22] take place amen and I want to be a part
[1:23:25] of it hallelujah amen it's essential
[1:23:28] yeah that I be buried down there
[1:23:31] hallelujah oh Hallelujah brother said
[1:23:33] where is it today it's essential that we
[1:23:36] be buried in
[1:23:38] Christ yes Glory yes sir Joseph he said
[1:23:43] he
[1:23:44] knew by by by seeing his own life
[1:23:48] brother says and any man can watch your
[1:23:51] own life and tell about what you are if
[1:23:55] you just check up on
[1:23:57] yourself whether you're really a
[1:23:59] Christian or not watch the things that
[1:24:01] you do and what you say your
[1:24:04] associations and so forth amen you'll
[1:24:06] find out really whether you really got
[1:24:08] anything
[1:24:10] there
[1:24:11] Hallelujah yes
[1:24:17] sir can I go a little longer yes sir yes
[1:24:21] sir
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:25] Amen
[1:24:27] brother tells us
[1:24:30] frequently that the
[1:24:33] world has its
[1:24:35] scientists said but God has his
[1:24:38] scientists too that's right that's right
[1:24:42] we find
[1:24:44] that it was in the early
[1:24:48] 60s late 50s early 60s
[1:24:51] were they actually began to understand
[1:24:56] genetics they be they understood
[1:24:59] genetics all the way back in the time of
[1:25:00] Darwin as far as natural selection and
[1:25:04] and you know uh you know one flower or
[1:25:06] bring forth another flower but it wasn't
[1:25:08] until the the time of the electron
[1:25:11] microscope being invented in the I think
[1:25:13] in the 50s somewhere along in there that
[1:25:15] they were able to look down and to see
[1:25:19] and actually break down
[1:25:22] the genetic codes as far as what what
[1:25:27] the gene actually was and what the man
[1:25:30] was actually made of DNA and be able to
[1:25:34] understand these things and then so it
[1:25:37] was actually uh they they understood the
[1:25:40] the the breeding processes and things
[1:25:42] like that they've been able to do it for
[1:25:45] several hundred years uh uh with just
[1:25:49] cattle and things like that all the way
[1:25:51] back into the time of the 1600s they
[1:25:53] were actually they were
[1:25:55] actually actually later than that even
[1:25:58] back in Mesopotamia they were cross
[1:26:00] treating animals different uh different
[1:26:02] breeds of dogs and things like that to
[1:26:04] produce these big mastiffs and different
[1:26:07] things like that and they and they they
[1:26:09] they bred all these different kind of
[1:26:11] hunting dogs and protection dogs and
[1:26:13] attack dogs and they they did the same
[1:26:15] thing in the horses and they did the
[1:26:16] same thing in cattle
[1:26:18] yes but they didn't understand what that
[1:26:22] what that DNA really was and how that it
[1:26:25] you know and they actually were able to
[1:26:27] now draw a picture like a ladder that's
[1:26:30] a twisted ladder and then on that ladder
[1:26:32] there's different markers and indicators
[1:26:35] and and there's certain genes that you
[1:26:37] have that are exactly the same genes as
[1:26:40] uh uh uh Botanicals we have certain
[1:26:44] certain genetics that are with within
[1:26:47] the animal kingdom that are cross that
[1:26:49] are in all eyeses but then there are
[1:26:52] certain genes that are specific to human
[1:26:55] beings yes and then they can't be
[1:26:57] crossed with anything else and so uh
[1:27:00] because and so they can take uh H HH
[1:27:04] stem cells from embryos and things like
[1:27:07] that and they can and they can take
[1:27:09] those stem cells and they can inject
[1:27:12] them into a healthy human being and
[1:27:14] those Ste those cells and this is on
[1:27:17] tape brother BR tells us about this he
[1:27:19] says and how that those cells actually
[1:27:22] from another human being or another
[1:27:24] embryo uh that they can actually uh find
[1:27:27] their way and kidney cells will go to
[1:27:30] your kidneys
[1:27:31] right eye cells will go to your eyes and
[1:27:35] so on and so on and so on and then they
[1:27:38] but he said there's an intelligence that
[1:27:40] guides it there right there's
[1:27:42] medications that you can put into your
[1:27:45] body and that medication somehow or
[1:27:48] another Finds Its way to the place that
[1:27:51] needs needs the medication amen by by
[1:27:55] you can have an infection in your foot
[1:27:59] and they can give you a shot in your
[1:28:02] arm and
[1:28:04] that antibiotic or whatever it might be
[1:28:07] will find its way to that infection yes
[1:28:09] sir yes sir and it won't affect any
[1:28:11] other part of your body on the way there
[1:28:13] it'll just find its way go to the bad
[1:28:15] spot and attack it right amen it's an
[1:28:19] amazing creature yes
[1:28:27] and
[1:28:27] so I was doing uh you know how this is a
[1:28:33] day of knowledge yes sir and if you want
[1:28:35] to know who
[1:28:37] the eighth president
[1:28:40] was anybody know who the eighth
[1:28:42] president
[1:28:43] was nobody knows who the eighth
[1:28:46] president
[1:28:47] was but we can all find it just a couple
[1:28:50] of seconds that's right we just call
[1:28:53] Uncle
[1:28:54] Google Bingo we got
[1:28:57] it and so it was one of those situations
[1:29:01] I was driving along and seeing some
[1:29:04] white cows out on the side of the
[1:29:06] road and well I was raised in cattle
[1:29:09] country and so typically that would have
[1:29:11] been a a charlet cow and that's the
[1:29:14] breed of the of the cow would be a
[1:29:16] charlet but these particular cows they
[1:29:19] didn't look just exactly like Charlie
[1:29:22] they were white but that was something
[1:29:25] different about them and I said I don't
[1:29:27] know I'm not sure
[1:29:29] so my son asked me well is there what
[1:29:32] other white cows are there I said we
[1:29:34] better call Uncle
[1:29:36] Google and so I I so we forgot about we
[1:29:39] was on our way to church and so after
[1:29:40] church I come back I see that same bunch
[1:29:43] of cows I said what cows
[1:29:45] are I can see them from my house
[1:29:47] standing out on the hill there good ways
[1:29:49] down there but in New Mexico there's no
[1:29:51] trees and I can see see about 50 60
[1:29:53] miles in One Direction Just way off out
[1:29:55] there in distance and then cows is
[1:29:57] probably six seven miles away I can
[1:29:58] still see him sit on the
[1:30:00] hill and so I was I said I want to see
[1:30:03] what them cows
[1:30:04] are that's so I got on the internet and
[1:30:07] I and I found out there's several
[1:30:09] different breeds of white cows there's
[1:30:11] actually uh you know there's uh these
[1:30:14] what they call I think a British white
[1:30:17] and then there's a an American white and
[1:30:19] so I said wellow I wonder but these C
[1:30:22] they didn't look like either one of them
[1:30:23] and so I said well they're just probably
[1:30:25] you know I don't know they're probably
[1:30:26] charlet and I just didn't ain't seen a
[1:30:29] charlet in a long time or something but
[1:30:31] anyways I'm looking on there and then
[1:30:32] all of a sudden there was this little
[1:30:34] note down there a little link you know
[1:30:36] how it is on the computer it said the
[1:30:39] the
[1:30:40] uich U's cows were the
[1:30:46] original cows that all domestic cows
[1:30:48] come from that's and then there was was
[1:30:52] another link down there that there said
[1:30:54] that these cows were extinct but that
[1:30:57] they were going to back breed them and
[1:31:01] bring them back from Extinction W I
[1:31:05] thought imagine
[1:31:08] that I said they're actually going to
[1:31:12] bring something that's extinct there
[1:31:14] ain't no more and then I read there this
[1:31:17] article I just I just read it to you
[1:31:22] it says many extinct species might now
[1:31:26] be
[1:31:27] reclassified as
[1:31:30] bodily but not genetically extinct come
[1:31:33] on
[1:31:35] now boy there's in
[1:31:38] believers they done crossed over but
[1:31:41] they're not gone right right amen
[1:31:44] they're still here amen said God takes
[1:31:49] his man yes sir but he leaves his spirit
[1:31:53] amen so what was it it was that life
[1:31:55] that was in it that same Jesus that same
[1:31:58] spirit that rais Jesus from the dead if
[1:32:02] it dwells in you it will Quicken your
[1:32:05] mortal body amen so it'll bring it this
[1:32:09] mortality will come subject to the word
[1:32:13] amen so what it we cannot truly worship
[1:32:19] like the Pentecostal Church did at the
[1:32:22] Ephesus age unless we receive the same
[1:32:26] baptism that they received there amen if
[1:32:29] we receive the same baptism they
[1:32:30] received there we will act the same way
[1:32:33] they acted there amen but the prophet of
[1:32:36] God said that that message of Pentecost
[1:32:38] won't work for this day right so you're
[1:32:41] saying
[1:32:43] but what message will work you see they
[1:32:47] were under Joel's prophecy that I'll
[1:32:49] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:32:52] we were under Joel's prophecy that I
[1:32:54] will restore all the years that the
[1:32:56] Palmer
[1:32:57] W and so now but we're still under the
[1:33:00] inspiration of the word and because
[1:33:02] we're under the inspiration of the word
[1:33:04] he gave us the corn and the oil and the
[1:33:07] wine just like he did to them in their
[1:33:09] day they recognize their day and its
[1:33:12] message and they worship God and when we
[1:33:14] recognize our day in message we will
[1:33:17] worship the same way they worship yes
[1:33:19] amen hallelujah oh my it'll get the same
[1:33:23] results the same emotions the same signs
[1:33:26] and wonders if it does not it is a seed
[1:33:29] of dis yes sir that's right brother amen
[1:33:32] that's
[1:33:33] good that's
[1:33:37] true he
[1:33:40] said they're bodily but not genetically
[1:33:45] extinct they're
[1:33:47] dead but their DNA is recoverable
[1:33:52] yes yes amen from Museum specimens and
[1:33:58] fossils and thanks oh I love it when
[1:34:00] they say
[1:34:01] thanks thanks to new developments in
[1:34:05] genetic
[1:34:06] technology that DNA may eventually bring
[1:34:11] animals back to life
[1:34:15] amen remember what he said what you see
[1:34:17] in the scientific Community wow is what
[1:34:21] God
[1:34:24] praise God
[1:34:25] Amen they're walking all around
[1:34:29] res talking we're just gonna keep
[1:34:31] reading here oh my I feel I feel like oh
[1:34:37] man I believe in a sensational God let
[1:34:40] me tell yes sir he said but why bring
[1:34:43] back Bish creatures to
[1:34:46] life it'll be expensive oh let me tell
[1:34:49] you this cost yeah God everything
[1:34:52] yeah yes bankrupt heaven for
[1:34:55] thisen amen oh my oh my this pull pit
[1:35:01] ain't just near be enough this rope is
[1:35:03] just too
[1:35:05] short all right yes
[1:35:09] sir my language just ain't enough I'm
[1:35:12] telling thank you Lord it will take
[1:35:16] decades oh
[1:35:19] God and it won't always succeed
[1:35:23] so why even try
[1:35:25] right their Resurrection might not work
[1:35:28] yeah oh what a resurrection that
[1:35:33] was what a resurrection this
[1:35:36] is I'm under the spell of Resurrection
[1:35:41] I'm under the Revelation that joob was
[1:35:43] under that Paul was under the polycarp
[1:35:46] was under the way was
[1:35:49] under the destroy My Flesh I shall see
[1:35:53] God
[1:35:54] Amen Glory Hallelujah he said this y was
[1:35:59] a massive
[1:36:00] creature stood more than six feet tall
[1:36:03] the shoulder that's a big old cow yeah
[1:36:07] he said and weighing more than a
[1:36:11] ton man talk about a cash
[1:36:13] crop man I like her of them
[1:36:18] buggers man you could make some money on
[1:36:20] that
[1:36:23] he said it had forward- facing horns a
[1:36:25] white stripe running down its spine and
[1:36:28] the uro were
[1:36:30] denominated I
[1:36:32] mean
[1:36:36] domesticated but some some URS also
[1:36:40] remained in the wild until the Middle
[1:36:44] Ages about that but there was these
[1:36:46] original Pentecostal ugs right and they
[1:36:51] remained
[1:36:52] AED they remained there was a certain
[1:36:55] Mark about them yeah oh I could I have
[1:36:59] get all Little Children Here we just
[1:37:00] changed the message yeah I preach to you
[1:37:03] little fellas about the little donkey
[1:37:06] and I can't maybe another time maybe
[1:37:08] tonight amen amen you have to bring all
[1:37:11] the children yes sir send send your
[1:37:15] children that's right right amen he said
[1:37:19] uh he said now now
[1:37:22] what they were uh they all got
[1:37:26] denominated and they remained in the
[1:37:29] wild until they couldn't be denominated
[1:37:32] some of that couldn't be denominated and
[1:37:34] remained in the wild until the Middle
[1:37:37] Ages when scientists believe they became
[1:37:41] extinct due to martyrdom and
[1:37:45] persecution over honey and the loss of
[1:37:48] habitat beautiful amen they closed the
[1:37:50] door yeah they did wow and it darkened
[1:37:53] the age he said but he said you take the
[1:37:56] Liv said but don't touch the
[1:37:58] old leave that all in line praise
[1:38:02] God Amen he said now what he said when
[1:38:07] scientist uh he said they believe they
[1:38:10] became extinct all
[1:38:12] right now I'm reading for this is Time
[1:38:15] Magazine February 2010 where I'm reading
[1:38:18] this from I did not make this up
[1:38:22] I did not put any words in here except
[1:38:24] for a
[1:38:25] few but I'm reading their words and I
[1:38:28] love it when science declares the glory
[1:38:30] of
[1:38:32] God he said the
[1:38:34] hope of its
[1:38:36] Resurrection
[1:38:38] yeah wow now lays in the tame
[1:38:42] descendants right the domesticated
[1:38:46] C brother Bram said we're all hybridized
[1:38:50] that's right in this to see age we've
[1:38:53] all become
[1:38:56] hybridized but the hope of the
[1:38:58] Resurrection is lay and a few
[1:39:02] selected thank you that have the
[1:39:05] characteristics amen of the
[1:39:08] original glory to
[1:39:10] God oh my
[1:39:14] beautiful he goes here's how the process
[1:39:18] is expected to work yes sir they're
[1:39:21] expecting this to
[1:39:23] [Music]
[1:39:24] work they said first the scientists will
[1:39:29] secure
[1:39:31] old Ur Pentecostal Ur Bowers
[1:39:35] right empty and fragments from M museums
[1:39:41] in order to glean oh my you see Ruth
[1:39:47] gleaning yes yes what they're doing
[1:39:49] they're gleaning they're bringing that
[1:39:51] word what is the Propet of this day he
[1:39:53] was a scientist a
[1:39:56] researcher a holy researcher from God he
[1:40:00] went out and began to get the loose out
[1:40:02] of the Methodist movement out of the
[1:40:05] Lutheran movement out of the calvinist
[1:40:07] movement out of the uh Armenian movement
[1:40:11] they begin to bring all the Lo and place
[1:40:14] of all and what they called a genetic
[1:40:18] Mosaic who putting all the pieces
[1:40:21] together tying all the loose hands not
[1:40:24] bringing new information but just
[1:40:26] bringing the information and putting it
[1:40:28] in his proper
[1:40:30] perspective oh because it was going to
[1:40:32] do something Glory
[1:40:35] sir in
[1:40:37] able to
[1:40:40] recreate its DNA right wow you got
[1:40:44] recreate
[1:40:46] this using they were going to with their
[1:40:48] ability to tie oh my you see got a whole
[1:40:53] message on this but they they they were
[1:40:56] able to go
[1:40:58] back with a computer age they were able
[1:41:02] to record and
[1:41:04] store the genetic
[1:41:07] information of all human genetic
[1:41:12] characteristics in this little room here
[1:41:15] we have uh uh Asian folk we have
[1:41:20] Caucasian folk right we have colored
[1:41:23] races we have uh uh just
[1:41:26] every Avenue of we we some of us
[1:41:30] probably got American Indian Spanish yes
[1:41:32] all these different races right right
[1:41:35] each one of those human
[1:41:39] characteristics are in our genetic
[1:41:44] code right us white folks have black
[1:41:48] jeans in us right yes just there but
[1:41:52] they're they're recessive they don't
[1:41:54] manifest right but and the same with
[1:41:57] black races have white genes in he said
[1:42:00] well but we've been in Africa for you
[1:42:02] know since the dawn time no we all have
[1:42:05] human genes that's why we all have human
[1:42:08] blood why we can all share body parts
[1:42:11] and blood and all these different things
[1:42:13] we can go to one another right but but
[1:42:17] there's parts of that that are recessive
[1:42:19] and so the scientists went back back and
[1:42:21] with the computer age they were able to
[1:42:25] uh uh uh uh record or
[1:42:30] list and they started a list called the
[1:42:33] human genome and the human genome was a
[1:42:36] record of all human genetic
[1:42:41] characteristics and they begin to record
[1:42:43] it they didn't figure that they would
[1:42:44] get this for years they figured it would
[1:42:46] take them centuries or at least decades
[1:42:50] but with the the advancement of the
[1:42:51] computer age and computer technology
[1:42:55] where at one time it took a computer
[1:42:57] that would fill this room to hold you
[1:43:00] know just a a a a you know 500
[1:43:06] gigabytes we
[1:43:08] carry hard drives Yeah in our pocket
[1:43:12] this big that'll hold a terabyte right
[1:43:15] right you know the advancement of
[1:43:18] technology is is just rapidly increased
[1:43:21] until finally they thought it would be
[1:43:24] somewhere 2015 our time now 2016 before
[1:43:28] they would find the whole list of human
[1:43:31] genome but because of the advancement of
[1:43:32] Technology they completed the human
[1:43:35] genome they know every human genetic
[1:43:40] characteristic and there's millions of
[1:43:42] them maybe more wow and they completed
[1:43:47] it in
[1:43:48] 2000 in 20 they known for 16 years all
[1:43:53] human genetic
[1:43:56] characteristics and they put that in a
[1:43:59] genome that they called The Book of
[1:44:03] Life they called it
[1:44:05] that and so now if all human genes that
[1:44:08] are recorded in the Book of Life are
[1:44:11] known then what about the latin's book
[1:44:13] amen yes he's calling all those human te
[1:44:18] amen he's putting them in their place H
[1:44:21] glory and so what are they doing they're
[1:44:24] they're taking this H this this animal
[1:44:26] DNA to recreate this original Arc cow
[1:44:33] amen because they believe that they can
[1:44:36] actually resurrect a extinct species
[1:44:40] right
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:47] Wonder so the
[1:44:49] researchers these researchers this is
[1:44:51] how it's expected to work these
[1:44:54] researchers will glean enough genetic
[1:44:57] material what do we have we had a
[1:44:59] prophet in this last day that has been
[1:45:01] glean he gleaned for his entire ministry
[1:45:05] right all the mysteries of God would be

[1:45:13] was in those seals which he said was
[1:45:17] names of the Lamb's Book of Life yes sir

[1:46:22] DNA mine di mine's gone it's buried Amen
[1:46:26] in the sea amen of God's forgivness to

[1:46:44] pile of rocks few years later we driving
[1:46:47] back here his old leg was coming out the
[1:46:48] pile of rocks I said look at luk he's

[1:47:19] researchers
[1:47:20] amen we then
[1:47:23] compare I like this this is this is
[1:47:26] important because now we're coming down
[1:47:28] to the testing time right the Judgment
[1:47:31] time which must begin at the house of
[1:47:33] the Lord he said the research will then
[1:47:36] compare the DNA of the modern
[1:47:41] Pentecostal
[1:47:43] cow to determine which breeds still
[1:47:47] carry these denominated cows you see
[1:47:51] he's denominated Pentecostal cows he's
[1:47:53] going to compare them to determine which
[1:47:58] ones carry the
[1:48:01] creature or the Creator the Creator's
[1:48:04] genes beautiful the creatures
[1:48:08] genes you see and then create a
[1:48:12] selective breeding program to
[1:48:15] reverse thousands of years of
[1:48:18] evolution we St say I'll find these je
[1:48:23] they're out here in these denominations
[1:48:26] and this one here has it and that but

[1:53:54] amen I I got to find a place to jump out
[1:53:57] here amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord
[1:54:01] thank you Lord watch this in the early
[1:54:03] 20th
[1:54:06] century why wouldn't the 18th century
[1:54:08] right but in the 20th century
[1:54:13] yes the Nazi government funded an
[1:54:16] attempt to breed them back is part of a
[1:54:18] propaganda
[1:54:21] a million more
[1:54:24] 44 they were trying to breed them back
[1:54:26] they were trying to burn them into the
[1:54:28] church yes yes the denomination are
[1:54:30] trying to add to their numbers because
[1:54:33] they needed a generational herd to
[1:54:37] reproduce and needed at least a
[1:54:40] hundred of these animals that had this
[1:54:43] perfect genetics in order to uh produce
[1:54:47] this herd right and it was to V indicate
[1:54:50] what Nazi Germany was trying to do with
[1:54:53] the Aryan Nation right he knew if it
[1:54:55] could do with cows he could do with
[1:54:57] humans right yes
[1:54:59] yes but it was a skewed mentality yes
[1:55:04] sir and the uh he says uh these were
[1:55:08] called heck
[1:55:10] cattle which may to some
[1:55:13] extent
[1:55:15] resemble I love these words the ancient
[1:55:22] U
[1:55:24] but but goat Doctrine M but bu something
[1:55:30] right but he said they're genetically
[1:55:34] quite
[1:55:36] different they had all the
[1:55:39] form right right see so they look like a
[1:55:43] Europe cow yeah they had all their human
[1:55:46] characteristics but they
[1:55:48] couldn't produce it genetically right
[1:55:52] for another generation it couldn't it
[1:55:54] couldn't reproduce itself right oh
[1:56:01] my now
[1:56:04] watch we want a
[1:56:07] breed that will
[1:56:10] resemble the eurox the
[1:56:14] original not only in
[1:56:18] phenotype but in genotype yes
[1:56:22] phenotype
[1:56:24] means comes from the French word finel
[1:56:28] the Greek word feno which means
[1:56:33] shining that's exactly what brother said
[1:56:36] right right the Pentecostal Church it
[1:56:38] shines it
[1:56:40] Glitters he said but the
[1:56:44] gospel oh they had the phenotype right
[1:56:49] but another
[1:56:50] genotype and a form of godliness right
[1:56:54] but they denied the baptism in the name
[1:56:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ they denied the
[1:57:00] Oneness of God they denied the seventh
[1:57:03] Church age messenger they denied
[1:57:05] everything that the word declared them
[1:57:07] and therefore they were only able to act
[1:57:09] it out and show it in a form in the and
[1:57:12] their forms of godliness or Holiness
[1:57:15] standards and all these other things but
[1:57:17] yet the life inside of them
[1:57:20] it wasn't
[1:57:22] genetically which is genos or
[1:57:25] genotype which
[1:57:27] means Offspring right amen amen they
[1:57:32] were the
[1:57:34] daughters of the wh right right brother
[1:57:38] right but they weren't amen the sons of
[1:57:42] God Amen yes they were the daughters of
[1:57:46] a strange God right but they weren't
[1:57:52] amen of God Amen oh praise His
[1:57:58] name I'm going to
[1:58:00] close he said the only way that we can
[1:58:03] make the
[1:58:07] recombinations oh my my my is by having
[1:58:13] the
[1:58:14] animals produce a new generation right
[1:58:18] amen the only way brother R said if that
[1:58:22] tree that original tree amen if it ever
[1:58:26] puts forth another
[1:58:28] Branch amen not the grafted on stuff oh
[1:58:32] it looked like but it looked like it
[1:58:34] would produce but it always would
[1:58:35] produce the same Citrus but if that one
[1:58:38] tree that root ever put forth a new
[1:58:41] generation right it would be back to the
[1:58:43] original or yes amen
[1:58:46] hallelujah oh that's what's going to
[1:58:48] happen there's got to come there's
[1:58:50] rising up a new generation another
[1:58:55] church that will be exactly like the
[1:58:58] first church why because God has been
[1:59:01] selectively amen breeding and joining
[1:59:05] and and grafting and bringing us from
[1:59:08] this group and that group and putting us
[1:59:10] into the Mosaic they called it stitching
[1:59:15] Taurus stitching the
[1:59:17] bull amen oh what has he done he's been
[1:59:21] stitching a bride yes yes he stitching a
[1:59:24] bride he's sewing her together bringing
[1:59:27] word upon word upon word amen life this
[1:59:31] is for my own thoughts closing maybe our
[1:59:34] musicians can
[1:59:36] come he said
[1:59:39] life all this is my own thought life
[1:59:43] from the thoughts of God I actually got
[1:59:46] this from a quote I just kind of
[1:59:47] reworded it it's kind of a paraphrase ra
[1:59:50] uh my thought just kind of to put it in
[1:59:52] order because brother was kind of uh you
[1:59:55] know was all around this thought but
[1:59:57] this is from a from a quote it's just
[1:59:59] rewarded
[2:00:01] yes
[2:00:03] life from the thoughts of God was
[2:00:07] waiting to be expressed
[2:00:10] amen when the natural body is being
[2:00:14] formed in the
[2:00:16] womb life is waiting to enter that body
[2:00:20] right yes your natural
[2:00:24] birth the new
[2:00:27] birth his
[2:00:29] Spirit enters the soul which is the
[2:00:32] quickening power on the gene of
[2:00:36] God and as it begins to grow up into the
[2:00:39] stature of the fullness of Christ the
[2:00:42] adoption crying AB the
[2:00:46] father then there is another body
[2:00:50] waiting to receive that life in the
[2:00:53] resurrection amen yes and that was the
[2:00:55] three-fold purpose of God was to
[2:00:57] manifest itself yes in a body Redeemer
[2:01:01] to have the preeminence in the body yes
[2:01:04] Christ the bride and to
[2:01:07] restore that church back to original
[2:01:12] worship yes that was lost or went
[2:01:15] extinct right amen at the fall of Adam
[2:01:19] it fell down Through the Ages until it
[2:01:21] was lost forever but God said I will
[2:01:24] restore right Hallelujah and so he
[2:01:28] poured out his Spirit Upon Our flesh and
[2:01:31] restored it at Pentecost perfect Church
[2:01:35] said it was it was the
[2:01:36] original pattern was Pentecost yes so
[2:01:40] then then that church went down was had
[2:01:43] that corn of wheat had to die and be
[2:01:45] buried right went down through the Dark
[2:01:47] Ages we said I will restore Hallelujah
[2:01:49] and he brings us back now in this age to
[2:01:54] restore us back to True Pentecostal
[2:01:56] worship Hallelujah yes amen amen back to
[2:02:00] the original under the original word The
[2:02:02] Original Seed word that was sown because
[2:02:05] a spoken word is the original Gene right
[2:02:09] it's the original life that is being
[2:02:13] restored amen and I'm believing that
[2:02:16] amen bury me there yes amen because I
[2:02:19] know that when he resurrects he's going
[2:02:22] to resurrect his word he's not going to
[2:02:24] resurrect people he's going to resurrect
[2:02:26] his word right amen he's going to give
[2:02:28] that word
[2:02:29] bodies amen so that they can do what
[2:02:31] they were designed to do right yes

[2:04:04] another some of our forefathers and
[2:04:08] ancestors no doubt
[2:04:10] were had those
[2:04:13] genes coming down through them lived in
[2:04:17] their times of the ERS lived in the
