[0:00] word of encouragement
[0:01] today uh there's so many things that are
[0:04] happening in our lives right now and
[0:07] within the framework of the world within
[0:09] the framework of the religious system
[0:12] and I'm sure that most of us are
[0:15] understanding the time in the seasons
[0:17] that we're in um and I want to say uh
[0:21] this which I'm sure most of us realize
[0:23] that is later than what you think I
[0:26] believe that we are about to embrace the
[0:29] translation
[0:30] and those who are predestined to do so
[0:34] will do so and I'm trusting that each
[0:36] and every one of us here this morning
[0:38] are one of them and uh because I'm glad
[0:42] to be one of them uh we we have received
[0:45] the message of Malachi 4 that has given
[0:48] back to us our identity of where we came
[0:52] from and where we going and I am so
[0:54] grateful for that uh in the name of the
[0:57] Lord Jesus amen
[1:00] as we stand we we also want to give
[1:02] honor to uh uh Pastor Jesse uh Smith and
[1:05] his family and the church family we
[1:07] thank you for having us here again uh
[1:11] Jesse reminded me it's been just a year
[1:13] ago and it feels like it's been 10 years
[1:15] ago uh but uh nevertheless we are
[1:18] grateful to be among you and we always
[1:22] Lay Love Your Way of worship uh we love
[1:25] the songs that you
[1:26] sing uh they are also meaningful
[1:30] and I love that uh as we stand let us
[1:33] turn to Romans
[1:35] 8:22 I want to give honor to my wife and
[1:38] and those who are with me my
[1:40] grandchildren and my my son Joseph and
[1:43] his daughter and the rest we appreciate
[1:45] you being here by the grace of God
[1:48] Romans
[1:50] 8:22 uh which is a familiar
[1:53] scripture we're going to give you all
[1:55] the voice that I have uh and whatever
[1:58] God gives us amen
[2:00] so we thank God for that uh it makes me
[2:04] uh feel pretty good actually Romans 8:22
[2:07] through
[2:14] 23 for we know that the whole creation
[2:18] granth and travaileth in pain together
[2:21] until now and not only they but
[2:25] ourselves also which have the first
[2:28] fruit of the spirit
[2:30] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[2:34] waiting for the Redemption to Wi the
[2:38] Redemption of our body amen
[2:42] amen and um we're going to ask that you
[2:45] turn with us to Revelations 10
[2:51] 8-1
[2:56] Hallelujah and the voice which I heard
[2:58] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[3:02] go and take the little book which is
[3:05] open in the hand of the Angel which
[3:07] standeth upon the sea and upon the
[3:11] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[3:15] unto him give me the little book and he
[3:18] said unto me take it and eat it up and
[3:22] it shall make thy belly bitter but it
[3:25] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and
[3:29] I took the little the book out of the
[3:30] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[3:34] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[3:38] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[3:42] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[3:46] before many peoples and Nations and
[3:49] tongues and Kings but there will
[3:52] come but there will come a time soon
[3:56] when this will be just I'm sorry I'm
[3:59] sorry I'm just uh reading two things
[4:01] together
[4:02] and let me read that 10th verse again
[4:05] and I took the little book out of the
[4:08] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[4:12] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[4:15] had eaten it my belly belly was bitter
[4:18] let's pray our gracious father God we
[4:20] thank you for your grace we thank you
[4:22] for your mercy we thank you for being so
[4:25] good to us Lord we ask oh God today that
[4:29] your that you have preeminence here this
[4:31] morning I pray father God that you touch
[4:33] the weary flesh Lord God may we give you
[4:36] all everything our body our soul our
[4:39] spirit to you Lord is you're worthy oh
[4:42] God of all praise of all worship and
[4:45] Lord we ask oh God that we in your name
[4:48] Jesus Christ binding every uh spirit of
[4:51] of a system or religion or anything uh
[4:54] because he whom the son is set free is
[4:56] free indeed and I pray that the people
[4:58] will understand they have Liberty oh God
[5:01] to worship God to in any form of fashion
[5:04] that that pleases God and Father today
[5:07] we thankful to know that we are H are
[5:11] free people born free to stay free and
[5:15] we we love you for that Lord in your
[5:17] name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may
[5:20] be
[5:22] seated I like to entitle this message
[5:26] this is who we
[5:27] are and often times you know we we we're
[5:31] we're we're in a
[5:33] uh how can I say a time where everybody
[5:37] uh wants to uh basically have an
[5:41] identity everybody wants rights and and
[5:44] all that kind of a thing but uh we
[5:47] realize by the grace of God that this
[5:49] age that we're living is is the most
[5:51] confusing age ever it is the darkest of
[5:54] all ages uh it is the wicked uh the
[5:57] wickedest of all ages and we know that
[6:00] Satan rules Amen in this age but in the
[6:04] midst of all of this Darkness God is
[6:07] doing something uh we know that we have
[6:10] been chosen in this day to be a certain
[6:13] kind of people but we ourselves we can't
[6:16] make ourselves a certain kind and we
[6:20] understand that the only reason why
[6:21] we're different is that because God
[6:24] before the foundation of the world
[6:27] planted a seed within us and that seed
[6:30] was his seed and he within himself
[6:33] determined what time that seed would
[6:36] come to life uh we know by the grace of
[6:39] God that none none of us stumbled into
[6:41] this age this age was predestined by God
[6:45] and we have been brought here for a
[6:48] purpose we have been born for this
[6:50] purpose uh you know we look at things
[6:53] and we think how difficult they are but
[6:55] when you have it's like for a gift that
[6:58] God gives you you know like a gift of
[7:00] singing or a gift of playing uh uh the
[7:03] gift is there it always was there
[7:06] because every gift of every good and
[7:08] perfect gift come from God and the Bible
[7:11] tells us that God gives us these gifts
[7:13] without repentance so the gift is there
[7:15] but if you don't cultivate the gift
[7:18] nobody will ever know it you see what
[7:20] I'm saying because I have a gift to play
[7:23] in Piana or I have a gift of singing if
[7:26] I don't get on that piano and start
[7:28] working with the gift nobody would ever
[7:30] know it or if I don't ever would ever
[7:32] would never sing amen uh nobody would
[7:36] ever know that I have a gift of singing
[7:38] out this morning you may not think so
[7:40] either but nevertheless amen God has
[7:43] given us all gifts and and these gifts
[7:46] that are within us the greatest gift
[7:49] that God has given to us is
[7:51] himself but if you don't work it if you
[7:55] don't use it nobody will ever know he's
[7:59] in in
[8:00] you is that right and sometimes God has
[8:04] to bring trials and tribulation upon us
[8:09] to wake up the gift that's in US yes sir
[8:13] CU as human beings we have this thing
[8:16] about being dotory or lazy and sometime
[8:20] God has to put the pressure to us to
[8:23] manifest himself in
[8:26] us no no we we we we we Within ourselves
[8:30] we can't uh fathom the mind of God but
[8:33] it it's wonderful when you can see
[8:35] little
[8:36] portions of the things that God has done
[8:40] and and and understand it's the way he
[8:43] he he does or do things when I read the
[8:46] Bible I see the mind of God I see it's a
[8:50] a magnificent mind that even even my
[8:53] little peanut brain can't even
[8:55] comprehend but I see God working in so
[8:58] many ways
[9:00] and from Genesis to Revelation I see the
[9:02] grace of God Amen even during the time
[9:06] of the law I could still see the grace
[9:08] of God now we're here and and and one of
[9:12] the things that reason why I'm I'm I'm
[9:14] preaching this particular message
[9:16] because I realize that this is a time
[9:19] that every True Believer needs to be
[9:22] encouraged you say oh it's time is hard
[9:25] my God what are you talking about this
[9:27] is nothing compared to what we're
[9:29] getting ready to face and the Bible said
[9:32] when you see that day approaching look
[9:35] up because your Redemption draw nine see
[9:39] that's the we must learn how to refocus
[9:42] our thoughts even when we get sick we
[9:46] think oh God why I mean what are you
[9:48] talking about all things work together
[9:51] for the good of them that love God when
[9:54] you find yourself thinking negative you
[9:57] got to refocus and you got to realize
[10:00] that God is working something even
[10:03] though you can't see it you may not be
[10:06] able to understand it but it's still
[10:08] working toward your good Hallelujah yes
[10:13] sir I believe that we are the true
[10:17] manifestations of the sons of God is
[10:20] that right the whole the Bible said the
[10:23] whole creation groans and wait for the
[10:27] manifestation of the sons of God
[10:29] now when will the sons of God be made
[10:32] manifest if you're not the Sons and
[10:35] Daughters of God when will it happen
[10:38] Hallelujah and we see that the time is
[10:41] running out they're ready to push the
[10:45] button y'all know what I'm saying
[10:48] everybody in the world all nations are
[10:52] are are are anointed with the spirit of
[10:55] destruction that's the anointing that
[10:58] there are Anointed with destroy
[11:02] everything that God has
[11:05] created Hallelujah and you must
[11:08] understand you a part of what God
[11:10] created so the anointing on this world
[11:14] is to destroy you that's right
[11:17] Hallelujah see the devil don't care
[11:19] about houses and lands and all of those
[11:23] things he's concerned about the seed of
[11:26] God right he's the one that hates you
[11:29] Hallelujah more than you can
[11:32] imagine but you see God has already
[11:36] predestinated us he's already determined
[11:40] our end am and the Bible tells us that
[11:43] we have an expected in we know what to
[11:47] look for Hallelujah Satan cannot stop
[11:51] what God has already
[11:54] determine Hallelujah in the scriptures
[11:57] of the Bible lies victory for every
[12:01] believer but a lot of time people don't
[12:04] know how to work with the Bible because
[12:07] we're not spiritual we look at the Bible
[12:10] as if those stories are historical
[12:13] stories and they are history but they're
[12:16] they're not just history because it is
[12:19] the word and Jesus Christ says I'm the
[12:22] same yesterday today and forever it's
[12:27] history when you can't take what to what
[12:29] took place yesterday and bring it to
[12:32] your day Hallelujah well how do you do
[12:35] that brother Brooks you got to realize
[12:38] that every character that that that that
[12:41] stands for God represents
[12:45] you and we become that character right
[12:49] oh come on somebody because you got to
[12:51] realize even as the prophet of God says
[12:55] Moses was
[12:56] Christ Joshua was Christ
[13:00] all the great leaders was Christ
[13:03] Hallelujah my question is then who are
[13:08] you Hallelujah you are the Christ of the
[13:12] day and if you're the Christ of the day
[13:15] you're still the Christ of
[13:18] yesterday oh my God you see I have
[13:22] learned to step into the book I preached
[13:24] that years ago because sometimes trials
[13:28] hit you and you think okay where am I in
[13:30] the book I'm in there amen I'm in there
[13:35] you are in there right from Genesis to
[13:39] Revelation you're in there and so you
[13:42] must understand you must find the place
[13:44] where you are in the word and I'm going
[13:47] tell you something when you find your
[13:49] place you find that you will be able to
[13:52] see your end your Victory and what God
[13:56] has determined for you
[14:00] Hallelujah we are those amen though we
[14:03] be the seed of God we are those who
[14:05] needed salvation and
[14:07] Redemption Hallelujah we are those who
[14:10] needed healing we are are the leaders
[14:14] that that led the massive and we are the
[14:16] leaders that led the few he said what do
[14:20] you mean because if Christ if we were in
[14:24] Christ before the foundation of the
[14:26] world wherever Christ is that's where we
[14:30] are oh Lord have mercy it's true
[14:35] anyhow I'm not asking you to comprehend
[14:37] it with your brain I'm asking you to
[14:40] hear it with your heart amen amen see
[14:43] your brain can't go beyond what it is
[14:46] but your heart is where the seat of the
[14:49] Throne of God is and God in your heart
[14:54] can give you a revelation that you are
[14:57] the word
[14:59] oh my God not just a different
[15:04] word God has placed you in the greatest
[15:07] of all
[15:08] ages the darkest of all ages but we are
[15:13] the
[15:14] generation that will not see
[15:17] death we are the generation that will
[15:21] defeat Satan oh come on somebody we're
[15:24] the generation that would take a
[15:27] Rapture Hallelujah
[15:29] and those who take a Rapture are the
[15:31] only ones that will be able to take a
[15:33] Rapture why because you came from God
[15:37] and you go back to God only those who
[15:40] descended will be able to
[15:44] ascend
[15:45] hallelujah amen amen if you don't pull
[15:49] holler I'm going to run out of
[15:53] Voice Hallelujah listen we are those who
[15:58] were caught in in sin and adultery and
[16:01] we are those who were delivered and set
[16:05] free Hallelujah you say well what do you
[16:08] mean brother Brook see when I see that
[16:10] woman and all of us all of us you say
[16:13] well brother Brooks you know I came from
[16:15] a family that was just Thoroughbred well
[16:17] I'mma tell you you don't know
[16:21] that you have no idea what you're
[16:24] talking about yes sir because history is
[16:27] not written in that way
[16:29] right most history that we know of is
[16:32] nothing but man-made
[16:35] lies the only history that is certain is
[16:38] what the Bible speaks
[16:40] of amen hallelujah oh it's the truth you
[16:45] see what brother Bru what are you
[16:46] talking about my my point is this when
[16:49] we we we we the devil knows what he was
[16:53] doing and the whole time excuse me he's
[16:57] trying to stop the the the the
[17:01] multiplication of the word of God or the
[17:04] replenishing of the word remember this
[17:08] now because in the New Jerusalem in the
[17:10] new world there are no
[17:14] babies no no no sister no woman gets
[17:17] pregnant matter of fact the new world is
[17:19] a
[17:21] implanting it's a it's a
[17:24] transporting everybody from Heaven
[17:27] everybody that's been redeemed we come
[17:29] back and we feel the
[17:31] Earth you understand me and we come back
[17:35] in our glorified
[17:37] bodies just the way it was supposed to
[17:40] be in the
[17:42] beginning we're not something that just
[17:45] happened this thing has been ftuned amen
[17:49] it has been purposed for us to
[17:51] understand listen you would never love
[17:54] God the way you do or the way you would
[17:57] if it had not been for this
[18:02] Dimension amen God being
[18:05] perfect how else can he show you how
[18:08] much he loves
[18:09] you you had to have the negative stuff
[18:13] in your life the hardships the pain the
[18:17] rejection all of those things the
[18:19] failures you had to have those things
[18:23] you had to have that to learn what evil
[18:26] was if you got to heaven and you never
[18:29] knew what evil
[18:30] was right good is that right that's why
[18:34] Jesus asked he said listen there was two
[18:38] one was forgiven little and one was
[18:41] forgiven much he said which one of the
[18:44] two would love me the most you see those
[18:47] of us who have come in
[18:49] this those of us who have come in this
[18:53] layer the see and
[18:54] age Hallelujah we've seen evil
[18:59] like the age before us has never
[19:05] seen and to be
[19:07] delivered out of this
[19:10] age that's why we will love him the
[19:15] most
[19:17] Hallelujah glory to
[19:19] God let me move on
[19:23] Hallelujah listen when the Lord opened
[19:25] the
[19:26] seals and he took to that Angel take the
[19:29] book yes and We Know by the grace of God
[19:33] there was a angel from heaven and an
[19:35] angel on Earth and that Earthly Angel
[19:37] was Malachi 4 and he took that book and
[19:40] he ate it and then he took that book and
[19:43] then that same commission was given to
[19:45] usj you got to eat the whole book it's
[19:49] not just just just like like I heard a
[19:52] brother say it's not just chewing it you
[19:54] got to swallow it Hallelujah it must
[19:58] become a part of you y you understand me
[20:01] why because you understand the message
[20:04] is the a word that transform and creates
[20:09] amen y'all understand me in other words
[20:11] the bread behind behind the the Shina in
[20:15] the shakina glory behind that final veil
[20:18] was was the same bread but the
[20:21] anointing of the bread behind the veil
[20:25] was a bread of creation
[20:28] it it literally had the purpose of
[20:31] transforming and changing a dead Rod
[20:35] into life y'all understand me so if you
[20:39] eating this message and you're not being
[20:41] changed something is wrong that's right
[20:45] Hallelujah like I told my church we come
[20:47] to church for change I don't come to see
[20:51] you I come to see him I come to be in
[20:55] that shakina Glory that when I leave out
[20:58] of here the word has changed
[21:02] me Hallelujah and when you come to the B
[21:05] when you come to church and the preacher
[21:08] is preaching if you receive that word
[21:11] under the anointing you will leave out
[21:14] here a different person Hallelujah glory
[21:18] to God right let me say
[21:22] it you see I I say this and I've been
[21:25] saying it a lot because I find out in
[21:28] message we have a tendency of
[21:31] repenting oh we we know how to say I'm
[21:34] sorry but learning how to
[21:38] surrender what we're sorry from or sorry
[21:41] of is a different
[21:43] story you hear what I'm saying you know
[21:46] that's what people oh I'm repented yes
[21:49] that's good but after you repented
[21:52] there's another step you got to
[21:56] surrender yall understand me people say
[21:59] oh oh my God I want the Holy Ghost I
[22:01] repent repent that's good but you'll
[22:05] never get it until you
[22:08] surrender hallelujah what you talking
[22:10] about surrender
[22:13] everything
[22:15] everything

[22:37] you'll never see it
[22:40] again y'all hear me you must die and
[22:46] rock in order to
[22:49] live oh it's the truth anyhow you see
[22:53] what brother was what are you saying
[22:55] because God don't need none of you
[23:02] y'all hear me he doesn't need any of us
[23:07] what he only need is your house that's
[23:10] right your
[23:11] body being the temple of God he needs
[23:15] somebody who will be willing to give him
[23:19] all and not consider
[23:23] themselves right this is why Paul says I
[23:26] have to Die daily amen
[23:29] I can't say oh I'mma die today and live
[23:30] tomor no every day this old man wants to
[23:35] live and you must
[23:38] surrender
[23:40] everything Hallelujah you know I'm so
[23:44] how can I say pressing it is really a
[23:47] press the Bible said we are Epistles
[23:50] written in our hearts known in rid of
[23:53] all men in other words when people see
[23:55] us they will they're supposed this is
[23:57] Who We Are
[23:59] we we we you know you might be a fireman
[24:01] you might be a a lawyer you might be a
[24:04] dentist but your your your your your
[24:07] your main purpose uh is to be Sons and
[24:10] Daughters of God you understand me I
[24:13] mean Jesus was a carpenter but his main
[24:17] purpose was to be the Son of God yall
[24:21] understand me and at some point he left
[24:24] the
[24:25] carpentry oh come on somebody in order
[24:28] that the that the god of Heaven and
[24:30] Earth would be made manifest in him
[24:34] Hallelujah Peter and was a
[24:37] fisherman but their main objective when
[24:40] God called them they had to drop their
[24:43] Nets and follow

[26:30] Christian y'all understand me so let's
[26:33] move on by the grace of God see we are
[26:36] in this thing brother brand and I'mma
[26:39] tell you something the saddest part
[26:40] about the message that I see is
[26:43] everybody's becoming so
[26:47] formal everybody's becoming you know
[26:51] systematic we come to church we sing Our
[26:54] songs you know and and we don't
[26:56] celebrate Jesus but the early Church
[26:59] Celebrate Jesus with healings and
[27:02] deliverances and all of those things you
[27:04] know the Supernatural is what they and
[27:06] they indulged themselves in and they had
[27:09] it amen I mean come on to tell you the
[27:12] truth I mean even if you go to Azu
[27:14] Street back to where the fire fell again
[27:18] Amen in this last day among the
[27:20] Pentecostal people you know we had
[27:23] people say hey remember brother bandam
[27:25] talks about the one sister who had
[27:27] cancer and and and and and and her
[27:29] neighbor uh lived uh was going to this
[27:32] uh this uh this little church down the
[27:34] street you know uh in the alley or
[27:36] wherever it was and and she found out
[27:38] that her neighbor had cancer and she
[27:40] says come on and go down here with me
[27:42] because we believe in Divine Healing and
[27:44] she had a son that was a theologian and
[27:48] he comes home and he finds that she's
[27:50] well and she said well praise the Lord
[27:52] you know God healed me she said Mama
[27:55] what's wrong with you you talking like
[27:58] that you're talking like those people
[28:00] down
[28:01] there he said well in my school we
[28:04] learned that Mark 16 is is not inspired
[28:09] she said well praise the Lord
[28:11] hallelujah mama what's wrong with you if
[28:14] God Can Heal Me by the uninspired
[28:17] scripture what can he do with the
[28:19] inspired scripture you see what I'm
[28:22] saying so we know by God's grace that
[28:26] that church had something going
[28:29] on Hallelujah and listen we supposed to
[28:32] be further up the
[28:35] road it it's not all in the preacher's
[28:38] lap it's all of us if we have the liquor
[28:43] fires we say that we
[28:46] have amen Demons of Affliction should
[28:50] flee from this
[28:54] building Hallelujah I preach the same
[28:57] way at my church but the truth of the
[29:00] matter is we got too much of us still
[29:03] living that's
[29:06] right you understand
[29:09] me listen brother Brown in the M this
[29:13] Feast of the trumpets he said but there
[29:15] will come a time soon when this will be
[29:18] just a fond memory that is right now
[29:22] what we had last night I don't know
[29:24] about you but I'm still feeling good
[29:28] he said these times will be taken away
[29:30] from us so therefore we must do all that
[29:34] we know how to do to make this every
[29:38] minute
[29:39] count y'all understand me don't be
[29:43] afraid to shout in the street dance in
[29:45] the street say hallelujah in the street
[29:47] praise the Lord in the street witness
[29:49] this message in the street don't be
[29:51] ashamed of
[29:54] it this is Who We Are
[29:59] this is who we
[30:01] are you love the
[30:07] Lord the Bible according to Isaiah 54:15
[30:12] And1 17 I don't want to go too long but
[30:16] I'm trying to get somewhere but they
[30:18] shall excuse me starting with the 15th
[30:21] verse but they shall surely gather
[30:23] together but not by me whosoever Shall
[30:27] Gather GA against thee shall fall for
[30:30] thy sake behold I have created the Smith
[30:34] that bloweth the Coes in the fire and
[30:37] bringeth forth an instrument for his
[30:40] work and have created the waster to
[30:43] destroy this is what I'm saying now he's
[30:46] telling you I did I've done all of this
[30:49] basically your enemy I've
[30:51] created everything about this whole
[30:54] world I created right amen I mean Satan
[30:57] may have deformed this and deform that
[30:59] but it all started with when God said
[31:02] let there
[31:03] be y'all understand me I mean Lucifer
[31:07] amen who we think is so great he's
[31:10] nothing can I say it like this before
[31:13] Lucifer was I
[31:17] am and you were
[31:20] there whether you can remember it or not
[31:24] if you are part of God no I don't
[31:26] remember it but I believe it
[31:29] amen right it's like my son you know who
[31:34] say well I don't know about was I there
[31:36] yes you were
[31:38] there cuz if you wasn't there you
[31:40] wouldn't be
[31:42] here right so we look at this thing and
[31:45] you say well what do you mean now God is
[31:48] telling you everything all these evil
[31:51] thing is that right the Bible said I
[31:52] created good and I created
[31:54] evil that's the Bible but this comes to
[31:58] us and he says no weapon that is formed
[32:02] against thee shall
[32:06] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[32:09] against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[32:13] condemn who shall lay any charge to
[32:18] God's
[32:19] elect now I don't know about you but
[32:23] this excites me because I realize we are
[32:27] coming under the
[32:29] pressure maybe you haven't been keeping
[32:31] up with the news but everything is
[32:33] turning against
[32:35] Christianity you're the evil
[32:38] now and that thing those things that are
[32:41] evil that's the good you understand me
[32:45] hell is blending into Earth that's
[32:48] exactly what it is you you want to you
[32:51] say what in the world why that look look
[32:54] like that or look like that is because
[32:56] it is the inspiration coming from hell
[32:59] right brother right and now you're the
[33:04] Oddball you're the one that looks out of
[33:07] order to this world sir y'all know what
[33:10] I'm saying look at our
[33:14] sisters don't ever be ashamed of what
[33:16] you look like Hallelujah you're the one
[33:20] you are we are who we are and we are
[33:24] expressing what God's will is for this
[33:27] hour
[33:29] power no weapon that is formed against
[33:31] you shall
[33:32] prosper this is what the
[33:36] heritage of the Servants of the Lord and
[33:39] their righteousness is of me sayeth the
[33:43] Lord
[33:44] hallelujah so what are you talking
[33:48] about I have no righteousness outside of
[33:52] the righteousness of
[33:54] God hallelujah I got the quote but I'm
[33:57] I'm read I'm going to say it like like
[33:59] I'm SP I'm inspired to say it you know
[34:02] brother Bram said it like this he said
[34:04] when when when the priest or a sinner
[34:08] came to the
[34:09] priest right to to for for his sins to
[34:13] be forgiven he brought a
[34:16] lamb am he said the priest examined the
[34:21] lamb not the
[34:23] man the man had nothing to do with it
[34:28] amen he examined the
[34:31] lamb hle come on
[34:35] somebody oh and if the lamb was found
[34:39] perfect the man was set free I don't
[34:43] know about you but they examine my lamb
[34:47] did they examine your lamb my lamb is
[34:51] Jesus Christ they led him from one H H
[34:56] place to another judgment Hall the
[34:58] Judgment Hall the Judgment Hall pilot
[35:01] said I find no fault Hallelujah it was
[35:05] never about you Hallelujah it was all
[35:10] about him y'all understand me so he
[35:15] became our sin that we might become his
[35:19] righteousness we didn't have to work for
[35:21] the
[35:23] righteousness the righteousness was in
[35:25] the
[35:26] lamb oh my God hallelujah we were were
[35:30] we were before Lucifer we were with him
[35:34] hidden within him the great Elohim in
[35:37] Jesus Christ in you and in me and like I
[35:41] said just a spoon F full would do it
[35:43] right that's what the prophet God said
[35:45] he said he said a spoonful of ocean is
[35:47] like the whole ocean everything that's
[35:49] in the Spoonful is in the ocean all I
[35:52] need is just a little
[35:54] bit right think about this now am excuse
[35:59] me I thought that when you get the Holy
[36:03] Ghost you say fill me with the Holy
[36:05] Ghost I thought God had to put a whole
[36:07] picture of himself in
[36:08] Me Feel Me Lord and brother Rand said
[36:12] like this it's just the head of a
[36:15] needle that little space is that all God
[36:18] look like a drop you know how you do the
[36:21] essential oils just a
[36:24] drop just a drop of God in you changes
[36:28] and transform your whole entire
[36:30] life think about it God the Creator in
[36:35] you amen creates recreates you amen
[36:39] hallelujah destroys the old man and
[36:43] creates a new man and that's why the
[36:45] Bible said put on the new man Hallelujah
[36:50] yes Jesus we love the Lord no weapon
[36:53] formed against us understand that our
[36:56] Warfare is not carnal Hallelujah I know
[36:58] y'all know these things but I'm just
[37:00] bringing something to refresh your mind
[37:03] I'm just trying to refresh you because
[37:05] sometimes during the battle we forget we
[37:08] just forget that's right and so I'm just
[37:10] trying to refresh you I'm not trying to
[37:13] bring nothing deep I'm just trying to
[37:14] bring something
[37:16] refreshing Hallelujah see listen turn
[37:20] with me to Proverbs 8 Hallelujah you
[37:25] love the Lord
[37:34] now we know
[37:36] how we know
[37:38] Elohim the self-existing one he created
[37:42] time he created space and then he
[37:45] stepped into it but he's all that in all
[37:50] uh he there's nothing really can contain
[37:53] him and and even though he in Christ was
[37:57] the fullness of the godhead God was
[38:00] still
[38:00] God y'all understand me cuz God is a
[38:04] spirit and when we saw Jesus Christ we
[38:07] saw the Flesh of God you understand me
[38:10] so but but it still didn't limit him
[38:13] matter of fact as as the prophet said
[38:15] that Jesus healed nobody did y'all know
[38:18] that that's right he never healed a
[38:21] man Hallelujah that's right because he
[38:24] himself said I can do nothing
[38:27] except the father show me yall
[38:30] understand me so if we can understand
[38:32] that concept we'll understand God in
[38:36] us he was a man yet he was
[38:41] God hallelujah and though we be men if
[38:45] God is in us yet we are
[38:49] God Amen I didn't say the
[38:54] God but we are children of God
[38:58] just as as much as the others were
[39:00] children and daughters and sons of God
[39:03] Servants of God only because of the
[39:06] Christ only because of the anointing and
[39:09] often time we fail to see that because
[39:11] we look at our flesh your flesh is
[39:14] perverted yes sir your flesh is a
[39:18] lie every time you look in the mirror
[39:20] you looking at a
[39:21] lie
[39:23] right because your real self that's not
[39:26] you amen
[39:27] you see all this
[39:29] flaw that's not you that's a
[39:33] lie he there's no flaws in
[39:38] heaven there's no flaw in the you the
[39:40] real you no sir this is a
[39:45] mess sir you might think this is the
[39:47] best looking mess but I'm telling you
[39:49] it's still a
[39:54] mess Hallelujah
[39:57] when
[39:58] you listen let's read the 22nd verse the
[40:02] Lord possessed me in the beginning of
[40:05] his way before his works of old now
[40:09] that's
[40:10] you you said well oh that's Jesus well
[40:13] that's
[40:16] you he possessed you now you might not
[40:19] want to accept that but brother B said
[40:21] you were in him which whichever way you
[40:24] want to put it that's right you were in
[40:26] him so he possessed blessed you you were
[40:28] in him before anything started you were
[40:32] there see eternal life is not something
[40:36] that has a beginning or ending either
[40:38] you were with him or you were not and
[40:41] when God gives you eternal life he's
[40:43] just giving you something that you had
[40:47] already
[40:49] Hallelujah this life is a life of
[40:52] beginning and ending but his life had no
[40:55] beginning it had no
[40:58] ending Hallelujah that's why I sang last
[41:02] night I got eternal life oh yes I got
[41:05] eternal life death can't stop me because
[41:08] I have eternal life so do
[41:12] you who's afraid of death in here if you
[41:16] truly got the Holy Ghost you're not
[41:19] afraid of
[41:21] death you might be you might have a
[41:24] little bit of funny feelings on how you
[41:26] die
[41:28] but you're not afraid of death you
[41:31] understand me Hallelujah he said I was
[41:34] set up from
[41:35] Everlasting from the beginning orever
[41:39] the Earth was Now understand everything
[41:42] brother Bram said has to come back to
[41:44] the word where do you think he was
[41:46] getting this stuff from Hallelujah and
[41:49] everything the angel showed him had to
[41:52] come back to the
[41:53] word hallelujah when there was no depth
[41:57] I was brought forth when there was no
[42:00] fountain abounding with water now you
[42:03] say that was the Loos and if it was the
[42:05] Loos where were
[42:07] you you were
[42:12] in you said well brother I don't know
[42:15] about that well let me say it like this
[42:16] that's why brother vand talks about the
[42:18] two sons and daughters of God we have
[42:20] the ability to
[42:22] create is that right and the only
[42:25] Creator there is is God go
[42:29] amen while as yet he had not made the
[42:31] earth now you see brother why are you
[42:33] saying this because when that squeeze
[42:35] come when that pressure come these are
[42:37] the things you got to
[42:39] remember then at that time who you
[42:42] are because remember the test and trials
[42:45] of Samson made him forget who he
[42:49] was Hallelujah but after a while when
[42:54] everything had gotten so dark his eyes
[42:56] were put out everything the mockery and
[42:59] everything else then all of a sudden
[43:01] something came back to him that he once
[43:04] served The
[43:06] God Who was the destroyer of the
[43:08] Philistines y'all understand
[43:11] mey and all he had to do is cry out oh
[43:15] Lord once
[43:16] more Hallelujah in sincerity he cried
[43:21] out oh Lord once more and he finished
[43:24] his purpose amen you said what you mean
[43:27] to tell me that God's purpose was
[43:29] Philistine for for Samson be blind and
[43:31] Samson
[43:34] yes God had to put Samson right among
[43:36] the Philistines in order to kill so
[43:41] many you mean to tell me God have put me
[43:43] in a bad position
[43:45] yes yes sir yeah you we always want to
[43:49] blame the devil no
[43:54] God he's doing what he's giving you a
[43:59] testimony he's giving you a
[44:01] testimony
[44:03] Hallelujah yes I I remember when when
[44:06] cancer struck me my brother said out of
[44:09] all the people marking me out of all the
[44:12] people you got
[44:16] cancer a few years later his wife was
[44:18] streaking with
[44:21] cancer she's delivered
[44:23] now but I often think about how he
[44:26] approached me how he said that and then
[44:29] when I showed him how God has delivered
[44:31] me even the doctors just recently I got
[44:34] a perfect
[44:36] health yeah no no sign or anything so
[44:41] what what I'm trying to say and I I'm
[44:43] I'm boasting on Jesus not me my my thing
[44:46] is this amen sometimes Satan don't want
[44:48] me to tell say you talk about it too
[44:49] much I can't talk about it enough right
[44:53] Hallelujah you got to know what I had to
[44:55] go through in my my mind in my spirit
[44:59] Hallelujah to understand when you get
[45:02] Victory how can you stop talking about
[45:05] it hallelujah it's like a soldier who's
[45:09] got a scar that he got on the in the
[45:11] wall and that scar seems say oh what's
[45:14] that scar about oh you in for a big
[45:15] story
[45:18] now right amen because he's got that
[45:21] scar because he was fighting for our
[45:24] freedom oh my God and let me tell you
[45:27] like this when people get into a place
[45:30] you don't understand God put you there
[45:33] but God expects you to come
[45:37] out I believe
[45:39] that the Bible said with every
[45:41] Temptation God has made a way of Escape
[45:45] every one of them every one of them and
[45:49] I believe that Hallelujah and the Bible
[45:52] said many are the Affliction of the
[45:53] righteous and God delivered them out of
[45:56] out of them
[45:59] Hallelujah let me hurry up now before
[46:02] the foundation was settled before the
[46:04] heels was I brought forth while as yet
[46:07] not made the Earth nor the fields nor
[46:10] the highest part of the Dust of the
[46:11] world when he prepared the heaven I was
[46:14] there when he set a compass upon the
[46:17] face of the dep you said well what do
[46:18] you mean brother you must become that
[46:24] eye see how we get all nervous
[46:32] you and the word must become
[46:34] one you and the word must become
[46:38] one you and the word must become
[46:42] one before the separation of Adam and
[46:45] Eve they were
[46:46] one showing that in the beginning the
[46:49] bride and the groom were one husband and
[46:52] wife one God male and female one
[46:57] oh Lord help me Jesus see see that's
[47:00] just where I'm at I you know uh 1 Peter
[47:06] 2:9 this is who we
[47:09] are when I
[47:13] see
[47:15] God working in the Old
[47:19] Testament and I see how
[47:22] God used a
[47:25] man by the name of of Joshua and
[47:28] how they walked around Jericho in
[47:33] obedience and a lot of time we
[47:36] see uh the the the Israelites are
[47:39] Marching around Jericho and we don't see
[47:42] the stress we don't see the
[47:45] pain we don't see the weariness of the
[47:48] people uh but that wasn't easy and to
[47:52] March around seven times yes sir it
[47:54] wasn't a little city it was a big city
[47:58] right we couldn't even Mark March around
[48:01] uh acarine without getting tired you
[48:04] understand me so you got to understand
[48:06] these people were tired but they were
[48:09] obedient now think about it even on the
[48:11] SE the the the last round they had to
[48:13] work walk seven times around six times
[48:16] however you want to put it but can you
[48:18] imagine they were in no condition to
[48:23] fight and often time that's how God puts
[48:26] us when we are weak that's when he's
[48:30] strong he takes us to that place where
[48:32] there is no substance in us to fight
[48:35] with and then he comes on the scene and
[48:38] becomes our battle a y'all
[48:41] understand so you and I must this is who
[48:43] we are but we said Lord Use Me Lord
[48:47] understand what you're asking for when
[48:50] you say God I want to be used by you you
[48:52] better understand God can use you for
[48:55] whatever he wants to use you
[48:57] far and you must be prepared to be
[49:01] used but how you going to be prepared if
[49:03] the if the enemy comes in and you don't
[49:05] know it's still God behind the
[49:09] enemy what do you mean every devil has

[57:57] different
[57:59] Hallelujah uh uhh let me hurry I got a
[58:04] uh listen what the prophet of God says
[58:07] he said remember brother the message is
[58:09] supposed to shake the nation or shake
[58:11] the church don't you look for some great
[58:14] something to come down all corridors the
[58:17] message of God will be exactly to the
[58:19] elected Church these signs and wonders
[58:22] will never be done before the world
[58:25] they'll not surpr supposed to be so
[58:28] sometime we think oh my but you see what
[58:30] God is doing he's trying to get us to
[58:33] believe amen the world has already
[58:36] showed us they don't
[58:39] believe but we are to believe what the
[58:42] word of God
[58:44] says signs and wonders are supposed to
[58:47] be an everyday life for
[58:51] us is that right oh my we don't have to
[58:55] worry I'm almost done yes we look at
[58:58] this thing look what he says don't look
[59:00] at yourself but look at your
[59:04] sacrifice God don't look at you he look
[59:07] at your sacrifice which is Christ don't
[59:10] look at yourself I'm not worthy you're
[59:13] not worthy nobody's worthy but he is the
[59:17] one right that's what the angel said
[59:20] they couldn't find nobody worthy nobody
[59:23] Moses Elijah Jeremiah you name it nobody
[59:26] was
[59:28] worthy to open the book of the looser
[59:30] seals thereof it took God Christ the
[59:33] lamb Hallelujah nobody and that's what
[59:37] the devil say well you look at you and
[59:39] and I'm telling you it's the truth I
[59:41] came up in an Apostolic Church like I
[59:42] said and you had to do this this this
[59:45] this this and the least mistake you made
[59:47] you thought you were going to
[59:49] hell right we were the closest thing to
[59:52] the Catholic church because if we made a
[59:54] a mistake we had to go confess to the
[59:56] the bishop that ain't even the
[1:00:00] word y'all hear what I'm saying sir but
[1:00:03] whenever you find such laws you see all
[1:00:06] kinds of
[1:00:08] corruption oh is the
[1:00:11] truth all laws all the law will do is
[1:00:14] Manifest your
[1:00:15] sins because nobody can do it
[1:00:20] amen that's why I don't like the most
[1:00:22] self-righteous Spirits you know
[1:00:24] self-righteous I'm better than than you
[1:00:26] in the message Hallelujah wait a minute
[1:00:30] cuz if you need the blood to to to to to
[1:00:32] to redeem you I need the blood too yes
[1:00:35] sir right so two P's in the same
[1:00:39] part but that you know you look at these
[1:00:42] people these pH let me go on let me go
[1:00:44] on anyway I I never made it but I'm
[1:00:48] looking to what he done that's where I'm
[1:00:51] trusting what he's done he's my S y'all
[1:00:54] better hear what I'm saying
[1:00:56] cuz when the squeeze come when that
[1:00:59] pressure come we going to see how much
[1:01:02] how many how many mistakes you're going
[1:01:03] to
[1:01:06] make and the devil will truly say you
[1:01:08] ain't even Rapture
[1:01:10] Ready but Rapture Ready doesn't mean you
[1:01:13] won't mistake make mistakes Rapture
[1:01:16] Ready it means if you whether or not you
[1:01:18] got God on the
[1:01:20] inside the Holy Ghost the Resurrection
[1:01:23] on the inside if the resurrection is the
[1:01:25] ins inside it will show up on the
[1:01:27] outside you understand
[1:01:31] me Hallelujah you know I that's the way
[1:01:35] I see it he never looked at
[1:01:38] you that's why even now when you make
[1:01:41] mistakes it ain't you he hear the blood
[1:01:43] it's through the
[1:01:45] blood you hidden under the blood
[1:01:49] yeah oh my God how else would you be
[1:01:53] perfect yes how else would you be
[1:01:55] perfect
[1:01:56] perfect you know when it come down to
[1:01:58] Perfection we don't even pray enough you
[1:02:01] say oh brother I pray I pray he and the
[1:02:04] Bible said pray without
[1:02:10] season you know what I'm saying there's
[1:02:13] nothing we can glory in
[1:02:16] nothing we ought to be grateful that God
[1:02:20] chose
[1:02:21] us and so when the Trials come I'm
[1:02:24] telling you I'm telling you yes we
[1:02:26] whatever you make wrong make right but
[1:02:29] at the end of the day we became his
[1:02:32] righteousness he became our sins let me
[1:02:36] finish it and this is it he says listen
[1:02:39] there where where I'm trusting what he
[1:02:41] done He's My Sacrifice I'm not worthy of
[1:02:44] healing no sir Lord I ought to have died
[1:02:47] long ago ought never been born but I
[1:02:51] live I got I got eternal life I'm going
[1:02:54] to heaven why because he's done it for
[1:02:57] me he was the one he took my place I was
[1:03:02] knock knee crosseyed in every kind of
[1:03:06] condition but he took my place
[1:03:09] spiritually speaking I was twisted up
[1:03:12] and all messed up but he took my place
[1:03:16] wait a minute the prophet is speaking
[1:03:17] like this he made me a perfect Son of
[1:03:20] God a perfect daughter of God his
[1:03:24] sacrifice did it
[1:03:26] not
[1:03:27] mine I had nothing to do with
[1:03:30] it I was born all out of shape
[1:03:34] anyhow but I don't trust in what what
[1:03:38] I've done I trust in what he's done and
[1:03:42] and what was that's what it was y'all
[1:03:47] understand me that's Abraham and his
[1:03:49] seed so you and I understand people how
[1:03:52] can I say it we we I'm going close is
[1:03:56] how can I say it
[1:04:02] uh we have to fight for our
[1:04:06] joy there's no reason why we should ever
[1:04:09] be
[1:04:10] sad and the reason why he brings sadness
[1:04:13] I mean you know when trials sickness you
[1:04:15] know what I'm trying to say but I mean
[1:04:17] just sad because you don't even know why
[1:04:19] you're
[1:04:22] sad y'all know you know you ever woke up
[1:04:24] you wake up like that you feel so sad
[1:04:26] don't even know why you're sad and
[1:04:28] instead of rebuking that thing and
[1:04:29] getting some joy in it you go out
[1:04:31] throughout the day I don't know why I'm
[1:04:35] depressed that's the
[1:04:38] devil and you and I must learn how to
[1:04:41] battle those things when that thing come
[1:04:42] I like no sir if I got to put some music
[1:04:45] on brother I'm gonna put me some music
[1:04:47] if I got to dance in my house by myself
[1:04:50] that's what I'm going to do I'm not GNA
[1:04:53] allow you to control me throughout the
[1:04:55] day cuz this day is the day that the
[1:04:57] Lord has made and let us rejoice and be
[1:05:00] glad in
[1:05:01] it that's
[1:05:03] it well they don't treat me right come
[1:05:06] on somebody they don't treat they never
[1:05:09] treat Jesus right this world ain't going
[1:05:11] to treat you right you know and I know
[1:05:14] they look at you at the cash register
[1:05:16] discern you a Christian and then treat
[1:05:18] you
[1:05:21] bad they do they do the same in
[1:05:24] restaurants right
[1:05:26] they look at you like oh she must be a
[1:05:29] Christian have you waiting all night
[1:05:32] somebody else come in and they take
[1:05:33] their
[1:05:34] order y'all May y'all never had that
[1:05:37] happen I have I mean they could discern
[1:05:41] just like you can discern their
[1:05:44] Devils they can discern you a
[1:05:46] Christian and so what I'm trying to say
[1:05:49] is even so I I had this lady this
[1:05:51] morning I spoke to her and she rolling
[1:05:53] her eyes at me and I said 'I going to
[1:05:56] praise the Lord
[1:05:58] anyhow I told her that this morning I
[1:06:01] said Thank You Jesus right there in the
[1:06:02] kitchen I said Thank You Jesus I'm going
[1:06:05] to praise the Lord anyhow and then later
[1:06:07] on her husband get up and say how you
[1:06:09] doing sir I said I'm doing
[1:06:12] fine it is what it is sometime you got
[1:06:16] to take them devils and you got to hit
[1:06:18] them back and how do you hear them that
[1:06:22] praise God they can't stand it they
[1:06:24] can't stand it when they done treated
[1:06:26] you bad and then you come out of your
[1:06:28] mouth thank you Jesus y'all
[1:06:31] know I know y'all think I'm crazy but
[1:06:34] maybe I am but my point is this and I'm
[1:06:37] closing I thought the word would go in a
[1:06:40] different manner but God knows the
[1:06:42] way my my thought is this be who you
[1:06:47] are if God has called you to be the word
[1:06:50] be the word that means you got to be
[1:06:53] different and ain't nothing wrong with
[1:06:55] being different when you know you're
[1:06:59] right right and if God called me
[1:07:03] precious I'm going to be precious if God
[1:07:06] called me great I'm going to be great if
[1:07:08] God said that in me dwells uh the
[1:07:11] omnipotent power of God that's exactly
[1:07:13] right and whenever he calls for it I
[1:07:16] want him to use it amen amen yes I pray
[1:07:19] for sick sick no doubt our pastors
[1:07:22] prayed for sick people and they get well
[1:07:24] then sometime you pray pray for people
[1:07:26] and they
[1:07:27] don't but it ain't your
[1:07:29] fault God just say lay hands on the sick
[1:07:32] they shall recover it's up to them to
[1:07:34] have
[1:07:35] faith Hallelujah sometime your faith
[1:07:38] connects and they instantly heal and
[1:07:41] sometimes it's down the road they heal
[1:07:43] Hallelujah but never think that your
[1:07:46] prayer was
[1:07:48] weak your prayer is never weak as long
[1:07:52] as you pray in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:56] am never I don't care what the
[1:08:00] circumstances may be let's
[1:08:07] stand if if that's what Paul says if
[1:08:12] this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:08:15] dissolved he said I have
[1:08:19] one I have a building waiting for
[1:08:23] me a body that's
[1:08:26] been made by
[1:08:31] God I just can't imagine how it's going
[1:08:33] to be but I know the Bible said the
[1:08:36] suffering of this world cannot be
[1:08:38] compared we're right on the brink of a
[1:08:41] miracle I'm looking forward to it
[1:08:44] Whatever May Come Let It
[1:08:47] Come who knows I might never make it
[1:08:49] back this way but at least I'm leaving
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:53] something to be
[1:08:56] remember that brother Brook said
[1:08:58] remember who you
[1:09:00] are don't let the devil take take take
[1:09:03] it away from you and I'm telling you God
[1:09:06] promised you something and he keeps all
[1:09:08] his promises he said I'll never leave
[1:09:10] you nor will I forsake you I will always
[1:09:14] that's my that's my quote that's my
[1:09:15] favorite scripture cuz when you don't
[1:09:18] feel like he's there he's
[1:09:20] there right and I'm so grateful uh to to
[1:09:24] uh uh for to Lord toward the lord for
[1:09:27] being who he is and amen you love the
[1:09:34] Lord Amazing
