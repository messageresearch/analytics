Jesus da my soul my dog you I love you don't you love Jesus tonight amen love you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you Lord amen praise God he's an anthem of my heart I know he is yours too I say in our feet here and let's take our Bibles let's go to John chapter five like looking at times and seasons again tonight I kind of sat down to study on those fourteen different seasons but then the Holy Spirit kind of directed me to go read every time brother Branham said times and seasons so there's a hundred and fifty of those I got through twenty-five so I'm gonna preach those 25 tonight so I felt it was the Holy Spirit redirected my thoughts so John chapter five like to look at times and seasons here tonight leave us verses 1 to 8 kind of familiar scripture here John 5 1 through 8 where the RAM uses this text a lot to talk about how God's compassion is different than our compassion always keep the balance though - don't don't forget that there was times jesus healed everyone the Bible says that there was times everyone was healed but then there's a time like this where only one was healed so that again tells us the wisdom of God sometimes God wants to heal everybody sometimes God just wants to heal a few it all depends on his great leadership praise God that's why we got to be constantly looking for the leader the leading of the Lord by God's grace so john 5 the bible says after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk a blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water a notices in verse 4 for an angel went down at a certain season in the pool we're looking at times and seasons tonight and troubled the water who sever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an affirmative thirty and eight years that's how old I am I'm 38 but this man had this infirmity for as old as I am when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that disease so I guess that means I'm a long time old 38 in that case he saith unto Him wilt thou be made whole I like this how Jesus puts it on his faith will you be made whole the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another step it down before me Jesus saying to him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath praise God let's have a word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make a known unto God here tonight I really just felt like the Lord took over my studying this morning and kind of led me to this direction so I'm just trusting the Holy Spirit to bless you speak to you or speak to me and help us here tonight Heavenly Father again we bow our head Lord God we come near reverently we ask that your spirit Lord would have its way help me Lord God to preach Lord your word and father help me to be a true witness Lord God help each person Lord to receive your word and father may it be a word and new season father we pray Lord I felt strangely Lord you redirected my thoughts this way so father just have your way tonight Lord we feel your presence Lord God we're aware Lord that you're here you promised to be here and father have your way tonight Lord have free course have Liberty tonight by the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you to be in see the praise the Lord so let's look at this here tonight let's look at this is part ten on the purpose series and like I said I just felt led strangely I was studying on those fourteen seasons for a little while and then all of a sudden it just seemed like the Holy Spirit directed me to go look up for the Rams quotes on times and seasons so let's look at those tonight you can switch over and every ready huh there was all there was a hundred fifty of them so I got through 25 so this sermon has about 25 of those quotes so look forward to that I started in 1946 or 47 and kind of worked my way up to 1954 I think is where I left off this morning so let's look at these thoughts here now let's look at brother branham's thoughts on times and seasons now some of these I'll just be bringing a few quotes and then we'll kind of look at a few real in-depth here by God's grace so but hey I'm saying now Jesus here was speaking he said father the time has come now there's seasons for everything do you believe that he said you so in a certain season you reap it a certain season there's seasons when the time comes that's right for things that happen do you believe that the time came one time for God to destroy the world with water and he sent a man by the name of Noah and God got the world ready for judgment the time came for Noah to go into the ark isn't God doing the same thing today he's getting the world ready for a judgment of fire not on a judgment of water but a judgment of fire and he says and when the time of the promise drew nigh so now he moves that now to Moses they're raised up a pharaoh who did not know Joseph why this season was there so for Moses his time and Noah's time both times had to come to the right season and then God could bring forth of Noah and then caught God could bring forth a Moses it had to be the right time because they'd respected Israel that till that time but the season was therefore no more respects that God could shower down his judgments upon the people the time had come remember we're nearing the time when all of Israel I'm sorry Israel is going to be gathered against by every nation I remember that from the Book of Daniel we preach on that a few years ago all nations the Bible said will gather themselves against Israel did you see this week some of the Democrats come out against Israel more forcefully to see that some anti-semitic talk in their real awful but you know that's what the prophecy were under you know thank God some people are for Israel thank God for that but there's gonna come a time just like in these times when all the nations are gonna be against Israel well you and I you and I keep praying for Israel praise God there's blessings if we pray for Israel we know that praise the Lord now the Prophet goes now to the three Hebrew children he said the Hebrew children when they were carried over in Babylon listen the time come when they had to stand for what was right the King made a proclamation he said whosoever will not bow down to the image to be thrown in the fiery furnace the time came for Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to show their colors their faith in God so they turned their back to the image hey hey man getting closer to you and I shown our colors right our true colors you know seems like now like message people just get to kind of hide in our small churches but there's going to come a time when this government is not going to like you and I and we're not gonna be able to hide our faces right they're gonna they're gonna try it like rubberband said last Wednesday we saw it they're gonna bring a mark of the bees and they're gonna ask every Church and demand that every church agree with their mark and you and I are gonna have to show our colors there's not going to be any more hiding after that they're going to be anybody more kind of played it easy we're gonna have to stand we have to bow to the world or if the stand for Christ we have to stand amen amen if you've got on the full armor of God you'll stand Amen that's right now look he said they said God our God is able to deliver us for this fiery furnace but nevertheless will not bow down to the World Council of Churches si like that because that's the image under the beasts will not bow down to the churches uniting with the United States government well not bow down to that he said that it is it was time this season was there so then the time came that when he was going to throw them in the fire furnace burned that religion out of them amen you can't burn the Holy Ghost out of somebody because it's a fire burning inside them amen their Holy Ghost is the true fire they've just got natural fire but we've got real supernatural fire amen to see it was the time and season and but they're not you know you Sunday night you were working but on Sunday night I looked at the number 17 which and I shared your name how you giving me a lot of those deep insights I appreciate that but at the end of that we showed how Paul said in the first Thessalonians 5 that you need not know the times and Caesars you don't need to wonder what the times in season are for the rapture remember that you don't have to wonder about the times and seasons because you and I know it's going to come like a thief in the night and the world is going to be saying peace and safety right and they're going to be overtaken like a thief you and I don't have to worry well what's the time and season like we already know God's given us thus saith the Lord amen we know it's going to come down like a mark now we will be here when it actually gets laid down but we'll be in the part of the squeeze part of it right we'll be a part of that and we'll see the pressure coming up and we'll see the government's uniting with the world countless of churches so we have to wonder what time it is we have to wonder about which side we have to stand on we've got to stand on God's Word amen and we've got to have the full armor of God on because that's what Paul said in first Thessalonians 5 if you and I want to stand we've got to put on the full armor of God did you do that this week I did a couple of times this week I got on my knees right in the morning at 4:30 or 5:00 and I said Lord by faith I'm putting on the breastplate of faith you do that this week I hope you do it soon I said by faith Lord I'm putting on the helmet of salvation amen by faith I'm putting on the belt of truth praise God my mind's ready by faith I'm putting the feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace by faith I'm picking up the shield of faith amen and my faith I'm taking the word and I rebuke Satan right in my prayer closet amen see that's what we got to do and if we do that if we put on the full armor of God and have the real baptism of the Holy Ghost then the Bible says that we'll be children of the day and we won't be surprised when the rapture comes we'll expect it we'll expect Jesus to return amen that's what a real Christian should have now remember I was listening to this week also this is this week I was listen brother Brian preached of putting on the whole armour of God from 62 remember what he said about Peter he said Peter did it he said he had courage enough to chop a man's ear off but not the real courage to stand up and say I'm one of those that follow Jesus so I hope everybody catches that cuz that really struck my heart in other words you and I could have real courage to defend ourselves with our guns or you know to shut our doors or defend ourselves by throwing stones that's not real courage physical fighting is not real courage the real courage is when your life is on the line and you you you don't deny Christ but you confess Christ that is real courage but have said so net he said Peter and have the real courage so he had to go up to Pentecost get the Holy Ghost and then he had real courage after that how many want real courage in their life see and we get little glimpses how much courage we have especially at work or family functions not so much a church although it's good to have your courage at church but I'm saying it's like when we get tested when we get put to the test when people say now you do you really believe that we get we get little glimpses of how much curves we have if we're born again we'll stand on the word and say yes I believe that the Bible says that amen but if we sure Kawai that we really got to look inside ourselves and say what am I made of am i putting on the full armor of God do I have real spiritual courage because you and I've got have it if we expect to go in the rapture amen see it was the time and season so they had it say our God is able to deliver us from the squeeze but nevertheless even if he does it will not bow down to the will of the government or the will of churches will only obey the will of God is that right so we got to have real courage tonight we got a real courage all the days of our life amen now brother and now goes to Ruth like I said I started 46 or was it 47 I can think was 47 wasn't it then the quote start in 47 yeah I think it was 1947 yeah sorry I keep thinking 46 cuz that's when he got the Commission okay sorry Ruth now this is beautiful look at this this a beautiful quote now let's get the picture right quick why are we running along this line if we can not notice and she would not but she went on and did you notice they only returned in barley season just exactly at the right time when they were gathering barley her timing was perfect Laurie and Boaz was her kinsman and he was harvest in his grape fields the Lord of the harvest and Ruth the young Gleaner went out into the field to glean a look at this a type of the Gentile church gleaning amen picking up just what they could the Gleaners going ahead oh they say you all haven't got the Pentecostal blessing oh yeah we're gleaning all right amen glory you and I are Gleaners we're not coming back you know when there's a big huge harvest we're coming back to glean glory we're coming back just to fly there's last few Souls hallelujah that's what we're back for that's the real Bride of Christ that's our type and we got to be content with that we got to rejoice when we find a few Souls thank God for a few souls we're just cleaning we came at the right time this is God's time for me to clean all these wheat wheat plants amen this is the right time this is what I was called to do because I type truth hey man thank you Lord he said oh say oh they haven't got to see how they doubt us oh you're just a small church oh there's really nothing going on there they said oh yeah we're gleaning all right we've how many do these are souls that we baptized in last few years all those little souls back there we're cleaning all right amen glory amen to see church we just got to be thankful we got to understand that God works everything in his time in season brother him says about Eli he's to notice sometimes in that day like it was now when our prayers are a little bit lingered we become dull sense bound so Zacharias doubted that they could be so he didn't believe it now notice after he had plenty of examples now Sarah and Abraham how old they were when Isaac was born Hannah came to the temple past the age of bearing went to the temple that day to serve God all right so now he's looking at how Zacharias doubted God could give Elizabeth the baby so did Abraham and Sarah Sarah laughed Sarah lie right in God's face right but God was bringing the son of men ministry there to prove to her to discern her heart and prove his word to her isn't that what God is doing to us God sent brother Branham with a sign in discernment and know people make doubt they've though mean we made out though others may doubt God's gonna get Sarah ready God's gonna change her doubting too laughter amen and God is going to bring forth his promised son in this hour amen we believe it praise God what I mean I mean this chart change maybe not this decade maybe not this 50 year period maybe not even this generation but in this church age God is going to bring forth the bride that's right amen look what he says probably the women holding up to Shiloh now now he gets to Eli and Hannah maybe to see what kind of hats won another war but not Hannah so Hannah Hannah then go to church and look at everybody's clothes she went up with something in her heart she wanted to talk to God amen and she prayed in such a deep since - the priest misunderstood er like today sometimes were called fanatics because we pray and cried to God we're not fanatics were just misunderstood that's all ah thank you lord amen but when he thought he was drunk so Eli thought Hannah was drunk they did the same thing on Pentecost they do the same thing today she said she was not drunk but she was praying God take her away her approach he blessed her and as soon as she received the blessing from the priest noticed didn't wait now God could have put the baby in her arms right then you know I'm not gonna say the name but somebody recently was telling me about a former pastor they used to had and this pastor basically blasting the Holy Ghost and said that speaking in tongues and that crying at the altar and that shoutings all of the devil and it wasn't long after that he got cancer and died one of my friends was telling me that I'm not gonna name the names but that's a reality amen God demands respect search praise God and if we can just give the right respect to God don't you think we'll see more of God don't you think so like brother can't preach on the heavenly places who's going to create that atmosphere it's not going to happen on its own it's going to be sons and daughters of God who come to church expect him to talk to God just like Hannah did amen Oh glory like I heard one time well I told you one time Simon was at a meeting and one of the women there he was talking about serpent seed he was telling about Surma seed and when the women she she walked out of that meeting and said they'll say the Lord serpent seeds of the devil and it wasn't long after that her husband came down with Parkinson's and still struggles with it greatly today and then that same church had about twenty people die in the next year or two and they knew man and I know I know people that were going there they knew something was going on wrong see you don't speak against God's Word if you don't know you just should leave it alone you should just have respects praise God we gotta respect the Holy Ghost gospel you and I have to believe maybe God can feel somebody with the Holy Ghost tonight a man could be one these little ones hey we gotta just love God we just gotta love worship we just got to praise the name of the Lord and get out of our tiredness or get out of our complacency say we're sorry repent and get right with God get our garments wash and just worship God the way he needs to be worshiped amen we should not we should have to have people pump us up into that we should go in the prayer closet and the Holy Ghost should pump itself out of its out of our lives and it should when we pray should be God just pumping us up with Morris Perry praise God if it's a man or a woman singing a special if that has to pump us up something's wrong praise God our own walk with Christ our personal walk with Christ should stir us up amen that's right church like brother like brother man you know was right after brother cam left i Sabri it was reading a quote by brother Branham and he said no Minister can pack a revival in their briefcase brother cam can't bring a revival I can't bring a revival but Ram says you bring a revival you each one of us have to bring a revival from our homes amen so I guess I'm bringing the revival from my prayers this week I hope you are too I hope you are too because that's how we're supposed to get revived be dedicated in a home be dedicated all day bring that same dedication to church and gods right there with us amen here in the church yes it's a revival it's a strengthening God strengthens us in our home and then that overflows to the church that's right amen Oh God sent us a revival preacher send us the Holy Ghost in our house that's really the revival preacher we need amen we don't have a guest preacher for a few more weeks but doesn't really matter we can have a revival tonight you can have a revival on Sunday we could have at any time we would God send us a revival in our homes that's the whole key to it that's the O key to it she said she's not drunk and it was not drunk she was praying to God to take away a reproach he blessed her and as soon as she received the blessing from the priest notice didn't wait now God could have put the baby in her arms right then but she went home happy knowing that in due season God would bring it to pass oh yeah that's the kind of people we need today taking God at His Word hallelujah how many one say God had his work tonight I do too and then he doubted to be so but God's going to confirm his word don't you worry God's able these stones the right children Abraham said John now watch then all that what taking place God was sure to bring it to pass because it was at the season at the time his words every cog must fit the same place when their prophetic wheels began to roll together it's got to happen amen the prophetic wheels rolling together it's got to happen now this was our text the healing from John 5:1 to 8 now look what Burnett says he says nothing look there letting a man over there on a pallet or little cut for 38 years now here comes Jesus coming down bias this market and as he passed through the buy the market he goes down amongst these sick crippled people do you believe he was kind hearted do you believe he was loving do you believe he had compassion on the people then why did he heal all those sick people there and you imagine that church can you imagine that it's just like going to the hospital when was last time you went to the hospital I went a couple months ago think about all those rooms that passed right that's kind of what Jesus did he just walked past all those people that sick of infirmity and he went to one man who been sick for 38 years was how many believe Jesus was kind-hearted how many believe that how many believe he was loving I do do my hands up but instead of that he went by the blind man he passed the withered man he passed the crippled child he ask the child he went over to a man that had an infirmity let's say sugar diabetes or something other he had at 38 years he walked over that man and knew not now that he'd been a long time that way he said will you be made hope he said sir now he wasn't crippled he said well I'm coming down to the water somebody can stop him before me and they get healed so every time he went up to get healed and the next time happen again here oh no Saddam somebody how would you feel that happened here you come up her prayer you're trying to sneak up for prayer and all of a sudden somebody steps right in front yeah you go back to your seat thank God it's not like that in our church to be hidden but that's how it was Angel's heal and they're angels that they had this commission from god you're just healing the first person that still be wouldn't that still be merciful though at least they had divine healing right a lot of churches don't like divine healing or reject divine healing don't believe in it at least the Jews had divine healing by way of angel he said somebody just kept getting the blessing before I did the angel only had one blessing and I just can't get after all these years he said just only one at a time and then the angel they waited again for another season maybe a month or whatever it was for a certain season oh I didn't get a blessing this month my it's March I didn't get the blessing maybe I'll get it in April wow what a sad well is that a sad condition to be in church you and I don't have to be like that do we now it may be God doing that for us right but it don't have to be like that in other words God can heal more than one person a month and the church said see it don't have to be like that now God may be dealing with you for a longer or not like we said last week maybe another month wait maybe God may be dealing with you like that but what I'm saying is God's not limiting his holy spirit to just one person healed a year here our sister who experienced something I our experience in all these years she felt a holy wind come in hit her and then Amen said she's so well he said I'm still struggling with my sickness but she's completely made whole that's a holy wind now thank God that happened to Sunday nights ago but that don't have to we don't have to wait till April for that to happen again it can happen tonight praise God that's what I'm trying to say like we don't have to say well maybe next month we do you know what the limit God let's not limit the Holy One of Israel let's believe the Holy One is let's let him be unlimited let's ask God to raise our faith that all things are possible to them that believe amen he said he come down again he said while I'm coming someone else step said to me and Jesus said take up that bed and go to that house go on and he walked right away he left that great crowd of people laying there lame halt line withered impotent is that Scripture well here it is I'm reading right off it walked right away from there now Church I don't know about you but it seems like Jesus would heal everybody maybe out in the away from the big cities or maybe there was other cities for eg of people but a scene like in Jerusalem there was so much unbelief that it hindered his miraculous miracles you know they all follow the Pharisees and they all fall under there their fear tactics right all those fear tactics just like the treaty internat Aaron's trying to say oh you don't you don't confess a Trinity you're going to hell it's not easy to do a fear tactic on you they say trying to explain it and you lose your mind but try deny it you lose your soul that's just a mere tack right same thing here oh you will even that rabbi Messiah oh you're going to him and so there was a reason in some places everybody could heal everybody could be healed ah you can hear it on tape where brother Graham says you can hear him praying if people get healed up in the discernments like Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever in 63 one person gets here and he tells another one to rise up from the from the cotton he said why don't you rise up and walk and everybody starts shouting embracing God and everybody just receives her heal amen and other times nobody gets healed all right the gift can operate because of unbelief same thing with Jesus except he heal way more than anybody could ever imagine right because no books on the earth could even handle all the books of all the things that Jesus did right so it's interesting he can walk in here by the Solomon's porch and heal one man and leave all the rest lying there and yet he's a kind-hearted God that's true now if we went was in such a hurry I read it but you scholars understand there was lying underneath porches haen't lame hot blind withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel to come down in a certain season trouble the water the first one stepping in just when it's on what every two or three months he says but the first one stepping in after the troubling of the water was made whole of what summer disease he had is that right amen now you've reached it last week brother Branham said he said Lord I just come business every once in a while to let us know we're still walking with you remember that quote I believe in that too like I said in other words I'm not gonna say well God you have if I don't see a miracle this week or next week I'm giving up on my faith I'm not I'm not gonna treat God like that so we respect it and we respect the God heals at his season we just don't want to limit this season that God wants to heal in other words we don't want to miss God's healing season praise the Lord I think you feel that way too don't you I don't want to miss the season where God can do something in my life that's right now let's look at this saw a little bit further healing in seasons because this is kind of dealing with our church now we can start applying this to our church and our life healing God does healing in season now let me turn there before I forget in Ecclesiastes 3 because there's a beautiful scripture there we read on Sunday please ask these chapter 3 alright now there's a scripture about there's a time to heal let me find that there yeah verse 3 there's a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up so the Bible tells us plainly there's a time to kill and then there's a time to heal so there's a time and season for every purpose under heaven aren't you glad God heals you Church I'm begging for those seasons when God heals me usually I got to get sick though to experience the healing well Bank over those seasons of God's healing his member again the Bible said an angel went down at a certain season not every season but a certain season and this is what I found even when you know sister tiny got healed the Holy Spirit was just anointing us for healing for that season like Aaron's heart from that one night where you came up for prayer you said God instantly he'll feel better yes and these all happen within a matter of like a few weeks or months or it was a season it was a season of healing and then our sister who you know a couple months later we move on a few more months to February 2019 we just wait a few more months and God does another healing so it's at a certain season and I remember when Tanya got healed I remember that day before I was studying on something else and the Holy Spirit just totally changed my sermon and brought me to the keys of the kingdom I was even plan on preaching it I think I've never seen that before the service and I prayed for right here and I saw I took the keys of the kingdom and I rebuked the devil in Jesus name may she be made well I don't know what I think was the next day God and touched her it rose that night while she was singing the worshipping and cooking dinner God healed her arm and she could raise her arm again amen you know church one time the same thing happening at Pennsylvania a few years ago I was there preaching and I was preaching a sermon on our face seeking out space and maybe to preach on Jezebel and how she painted her face this was so strange and there was a one of the back foot pads on and makeup on her face an older woman and all of a sudden while I was preaching she just started raising up her hand prays to the Lord oh that's wonderful I just want to freeze a sermon couple people came up for prayer raised for them well walk out and talk to the pastor under service he said god bless you he said brother Jesse I want to tell you a little testimony why you were preaching that woman with makeup on she said she came into church and she couldn't raise her arm and she said all of a sudden she felt somebody tap her on the shoulder and she looked and she thought it was her husband it wasn't her husband she looked over it wasn't her husband tapping on the shoulder she's the all of a sudden her shoulders started feeling good she started raising her arm that she couldn't raise before and that was the reason she was waving it during the service God healed her shoulder while I'm preaching the word now she never came back after that we never heard from her again but to me it was God showing her that she should not paint her face and indicate that I was preaching the truth God healed her shoulder that's the twice that happened where a woman could God's God here on the shoulder right when I was preaching the word and God raised faith for the healing but you know what it came in a certain season that woman never came and any other season back to the church as far as I know it was just for that service praise God amen and so God wants us to be ready at the right season right now look what program says he said God's got a time for all things we play he's got a time we plant corn a time we that we plow corn then at that time we harvest the corn the spring rains come to drop through the summer the fall rains the snows you just can't say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow go out and harvest it same things true well I'm gonna plant my faith today to see my grandpa Seder my my dad or mom Savior or I'm gonna see my son or daughter steak well hope to see them same tomorrow we can't expect that it's gotta be the right season 13 oh gods encouraging me tonight amen Thank You Lord amen you can't just walk out I plan it yesterday oh I'm gonna get some wheat tomorrow that's not how God works now doesn't work in the natural that way so God usually doesn't work in the spiritual that way God has x for season he has seasons for his word he has times in the scripture here where it said and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick how many let's the scripture in Luke chapter 5 that's when Jesus was ministering to at the Friends of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the Friends of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick and we found out that God works everything seasonally a man and now in Moses what he failed to do was the time living on God now I'm not gonna get to Moses I'm gonna just dwell on this stuff and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching there were Pharisees and doctors of Lawson Iman which would come out of every town of Galilee and Judea Jerusalem and the power the Lord was present some people say of apologizing you're just doing some teaching so there's nothing there's no anointing there to heal the sick let me tell you friend let me encourage you brother sister even if the pastor's teaching the word the power of the presence of the Holy Ghost can still be present studying the Word of God because teaching is just one of the five gifts it's just one of them there's four other and Jesus Christ had power to heal even while he was teaching the people hey man oh yeah some people have criticized me well all you do too much teach and or you do too much of that I just brushed it off it just goes water off my back right I've got off a duck's back or a Dean goes back everyone is saying because it's not scriptural what Scripture is that God will heal us and his ordained season amen and whether it's teaching or whether it's prophesy or whatever it is we're brothers just rebuking sin getting people to repent whatever it is it all depends on God's season that's right is that the state the Word of God that's not my thought that's your prophet saying that and then that's the Bible saying it was teachers see I didn't highlight teaching because I didn't strike me this morning like it didn't now that's why I turn he just can't be critical god help us to just not be critical help us to be open to receiving fresh revelation from the Holy Spirit like this morning I was a little bit upset that man who emailed me and said I was a rich young ruler he called me the rich young ruler I'm just meditating on the word you know because I teach a few things about the serpent see that that brother Graham doesn't specifically say that's because brother Graham and I showed this gentlemen there's a few quotes about man says he just has their contradictory which is that's we all know that you know there's times the Prophet learn more and change his teaching so he doesn't believe for the serpent seed this brother doesn't believe that Adam knew his wife in Genesis chapter 3 he doesn't believe that the fruit she went and took and gave the Adam was another act but I do believe it was because God said there's two seeds in genesis 3:15 already I'm gonna put mg between thy seed and her seed so there's already two seeds well he doesn't believe that well anyways he calls me the rich young ruler and he says you're you're so popular because of your false teaching just like the rich young ruler I said sir I said I'm the least popular preacher I know he said we have 29 thousand views on your Surrency I said that might be right but I've got a small dwindling Church which is okay you know because God's got a season for everything and I said I'm not making any more money I don't have to I have to beat people and make them sit you know we don't we don't have an overflow room because we're so popular you know I'm just being honest you understand what I'm saying like I'm not discouraged I'm just trying to be honest with this guy I said I'm not getting more popular I'm not making more money I'm not here I'm not getting more people in our church preaching the Serpent's eat is not making me more popular is actually just making me more or less popular and that's okay that's how Jesus was that's how brother Branham was that's how Paul was that's how I'm gonna be too and I'm okay with that but here's what the Holy Spirit brought to me the oice first said remember brother Branham said serpents see does not pertain the salvation so even if I'm wrong which I believe I'm right I don't leave I'm wrong even if I'm wrong and he said look at all those people that you're leading astray on serpents eat I said even if I'm wrong serpents see does not pertain to salvation brother Branham said it doesn't save you and he said it doesn't condemn you anybody want to read that raise your hand is anybody wanna read that I can show it to you okay I already got it okay good I don't have to show that so see that's unsafe like people misunderstandings they make some doctors major dr. Manson you can never measure on a minor back and I said with all the grace of my heart appreciate your ideas but I said I believe you have an heir and I believe you're making a minor a major and I said I don't believe I'm the rich a ruler I just believe I'm a faithful servant to Christ amen but see teaching see you know people get real critical but we have to be I have to understand that love will conquer all that right praise God I didn't leave the word to become rich I left riches I left the world to follow Christ I see myself more in James and Peter and John than I do the rich young ruler but that's again my opinion I believe that's my testimony but see the power of God can be here to t even know why he's teaching you God can give us power to teach you can empower me to teach and it can give you power to receive healing that's right so it's the right attitude now look at this have you ever thought of this type Saints never thought about this this is an ecclesiastic chapter one one generation passes away another generation cometh but the earth abideth forever the Sun Also Rises and the Sun go down and hastens to his place where he arose doesn't seem like that let the Sun just gets faster faster let it seem like your life's going faster and faster it does for me and about you the wind go toward the south and turneth about unto the north it worlds about continually and the wind returneth again according to is what circuits are we know the wind has paths in circuits let me know that so do the waves in the ocean they all follow a circuit Debra's trying to see where I'm going on this healing comes in seasons because I know somebody who preached his first doctrine ever was on the baptism the Holy Ghost and that man was the Lord Jesus Christ he said Marvel not a son of the must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth so what is the Holy Ghost like it unto the wind how does the wind blow [Applause] go get discouraged if you don't feel it or we'll hear another testimony for a while don't get discouraged the wind he said so is everyone that's born of the Spirit ha ha ha amen thank the Lord now you can't tell what it's coming you just got to be ready when it's coming I mean honestly I believe flow right I've even hit sister Naomi and who at the same time does she scream at the same time she got hit by the wind amen you don't know it is coming you can't tell well will it be the morning service or evening or Wednesday night if you can't tell but you know so I want to be ready because if it comes back inside I want to be there when it happens hey man I don't know which service Malachi Liddy's going to get the Holy Ghost but I'm gonna be there and every one of them praise God and then I can say I was there wind travels in circuits and he's going to show up pretty soon again thank you thank you Jesus for your word that's right look brother Adam cause revivals hot and cold he says we could ask we would ask to bless our dear pastor brother Neville who stood gallantly at the post of duty year after year through the hot times and cold to heard a pastor the Sheep of the flock that gathers there he sends it again let this is so beautiful I think I preached in the church ages but listen to this again this is so beautiful I think we all feel that way don't you I don't want no robes or crowns or palaces I just like to look at it you know just you know what he's just like I'd like to hold your hand while I'm doing it brother Neville so picture this brother Brandon and brother Neville holding hands they walk up here and here's Jesus on the throat they say brother Devon can I hold your hand they start holding hands and he says think of it for the devil how we stayed at the Tabernacle marina and hindquarter things but lookie here what we're looking at we're looking at the Son of the Living God did that beautiful hi we we never quit we never gave up we never just for so long oh we're just god I must have left us they never gave up on the wind they knew the wind would come back if they were just faithful hallelujah so he tells a grown man I'm gonna hold your hand while we look at Jesus oh yeah in that glorious yeah man there's something about the love of Christ they hold another man's hand put his arm around another man kiss him on the neck whenever I go to camp Church bed row man kiss me on the neck that might shake you up a little bit like circuit I think I'm awesome that's a holy kiss if I ever got one ha ha hey man I'm not really you shoot around here which is okay you don't have to yeah that's up to you but it's alright but the love of God was so on brother branham they said I would reach out let's hold hands I'm sorry look at Jesus think about that we were hearing the revisable times and we were hearing hard times but look everything we're preaching about there he is hope I can hold your hands brothers that that day and say look then we say together on Wednesday nights then we just stay with Jesus and look brothers there he is amen Jose all those hard times and all the prayers and your son in jail and all the hard times and Christopher having seizures wasn't it worth it there is amen the hard times and people left and we felt all alone and people fell away and people we baptized wouldn't serve God all these things but look at that there's Jesus the one that we were serving the whole time ha ha ha ha amen that'd be wonderful just a look and see his features now program says this is a new quote now in this city tonight I think there's 2 or 3 more of I was going on on healing services we're not here to be competitors of those brethren we're only here to do our part and we're believing God and asking to help all the sick and afflicted everywhere where people are praying for the sick in every Church and every denomination we believe that God will hear the prayer of any sincere person that we believe and there's no other man that's a divine healer we're just ministers of the gospel to preach the braveness say God's divine healer and God can do for you he did it in Jesus Christ your work of redemption for soul and body is completed even to your rapture is already completed and with Jesus rose from the dead God justified justified by faith believing that God rose enough from the dead and we are waiting for the rapture which will come everything will happen and sees that our salvation our healing and everything was completed when Jesus died at Calvary how many can look back on your salvation and see my I can understand that was the real season for me to get saved I can see him perfectly for mine I had to be away from my church God brought me three hours away from everybody my mom dropped me off I told you story many times I felt all alone just 3-4 months after that I gave my heart to the Lord God had to separate me that was the right season for me to get saved right and then for healing and then for everything everything comes at the right time and season because God's ordained your seasons oh that's right see healing happens in seasons now how to remember this story there's a woman that that died a young mother got it here and then she died and brother Graham said Lord you owe me understanding how many member that story well the woman that died her family was known to brother and he said they were real friends but but just one of those kinds of people that when revival is going on they will come to church I'm sure we've had some of those and I'm sure other churches some churches have people that could go to church only when there's guest preachers or they'll only come to church really excited they'll only pull on the word when there's a guest preacher there and the church said right because he said one of those kind of people that can only come to church when the revival is going on people are excited people just got healed by their testimonies some people can only come to church during revival season but when the revival was off and the load was polling nobody would pull all the children was here on the cradle roll and we had our classes and things so see church even a brand's a vertical there was times and seeds the good services and other times where feels like I'm just pulling I'm just trying to pull then I just use this as an illustration tonight this is a little more for that sometimes you come to church and you feel like this I'm just trying to pull the hammer over I have a good service that feels hard doesn't it and there's other times it's just so easy it's just so easy to have a good service right there's other times like somebody helping the preacher I could always know the difference because when it's when people are following my just flows out and everybody's into it praise the Lord and doesn't matter if you heard me preach your name's honors God's presence there and the pole is all but there's other times when people are really pulling or they're tired which I'm tired sometimes dude it just feels like I gotta get to the end of the service somebody help me polish some people can only come to church when there's revival on ok it was a nice illustration I wasn't planning on doing that some people can only come to church when it's revival and they're really excited but then there's other people that will come all the time I'm gonna be one of those that come all the time oh as soon as I return from California the Lord willing what the Branham tabernacle needs is a revival they need to revival in a filling of the Holy Ghost and that's what the great need of the tabernacle some of the finest people in the world comes here what we need is that Moli goes church I'd say the same thing what we need is everyone baptized with the Holy Ghost right right is that right because then when you got the baptism all he goes but America says you're not living in the outer Court where you're down and out of the time or even the holy place you're living in the Friends of God and if you're living in the presence of God that you manifest the presence of God amen see so the brand tabernacle would go through seasons to hot cold hot cold now that's finishing the quote but he's talking about giving instructions and had prayer meetings to receive the Holy Ghost the resurrection of Lazarus now let me skip to the court I want to get to here now brother man and this quote says that Lazarus was a scribe how many he said that Lazarus was a scribe and he had a good character he's very religious in a standing Mary and Martha did needlework and tapestries and he said at this time when Lazarus had died Jesus foster father Joseph I suppose was gone and Jesus had to come and dwell with them and he become so famous to his work just about scattered a place where he had to go away now he was living it had to come to season so Lazarus miracle happened at a specific time and season he says everything comes right in its season do you believe that you plant the wheat in the fall of the year in the spring of the year it brings itself forth or God brings it forth and you plant the corn in the spring in the fall you harvest it everything has its time just like his life it had its beginning as that's best part and it had a shadow as he closes you gots that you've got a beginning part then you've got your best part and then your life ends like a shadow he says our ministries becomes the same brethren it has our best our beginning our middle part the best then close your life starts as a baby then your adolescence then the middle age then closes same as the Sun rise in the east and sets over the West everything is beginning and ending how many would it be at their best at some time there's a season for you to be your best spiritually there's a season remember what the Bible said about John the Baptist Jesus tell him about John the Baptist he was a burning and shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light they just rejoiced for a season what was it Church six months oh they're going right there that proves it amen I was wondering how long this season was well at least I was using months right so a season could be six months okay praise the Lord I like that all right there you go they're willing to rejoice for a season Luka program says in 1954 11 years before he passed he's 45 years old look what he says this is striking cuz after you get 45 years old it's the idea of it is now of course if I'm ever going to be in any season or any age to be the best for the Lord it'd probably be right now hmm look what he says because all the kid things are passed away you ever feel like that Lord I wish I could just grow up a little bit wish I could just be more mature in Christ how many could save rid of that exit so all his kid things are finally passed away at 45 I got what seven more years so I get there all my kid things may be passed away by the sea and you're settling down turning gray you know just the time of life where you should really be anchored and strong enough yet and just at your very best mellowed out the kid part and the boyhood beat out just at the time to enter the field brother Bannister 45 the best time of my life now we know Church the best time actually came later I'm gonna get rid of that brother at his best time actually came at 54 55 and 56 because that was the third pole when did Moses work best eight legs we was 40 80 Moses best work started when he was 80 years old so see even in our own thinking it's not always what we think will best will be the best season it's what God calls for his scene yes like right now I could make ever excuse well I don't have time to preach I don't have time to do this I'm time to write books I'm time to make youtube videos I can make all these executions and this is not the season my life but I'm not looking at that I'm looking at what the Holy Spirit's leading me to do grace God I've had numerous people ask me how in the world could you write a book I said one paragraph at a time praise God over here and a half you write enough paragraphs a day you're gonna preach didn't have a book to go along with it but see we don't know we might think all this season possible it may be the seasoning I want you to overcome remember brother says I like a man who has goals I like the man who's got ambitious or agrees on that with him around Lincoln I just see a man who knows what he's called to do hey man praise the Lord bless your heart the church we just got to understand even though our thinking may think well I'll be the best of 25 I already passed 25 I guess that was my best days I'm I so relax on Jesus because those were the best season of my life no let's not limit God remember Abraham Moses all use the older ages right brother branham use best at the end of his life God could finally convince him after dream dream dream all those dreams God can finally convince him to leave Jeffersonville his church his family leave everything so you can go out of the wilderness to get the revelation of those seals hi amen get that revelation of marriage on and divorce oh thank God in church thank God he did so no matter where at Jose no matter where you're at God could have a greater season ahead of you praise God sister Beatrice no matter where you're at I could have a greater season ahead of ya amen no matter where I am God it's what God is already playing now and for days and there's no devil hell that can stop God season for you and I amen well I'll be my best at 45 and that's what I'll really serve God know it might be after that just stay faithful watch God move the season watch God use you give me all you can give all diligence to serve God and your faith virtue all those things put on the fool and I've got serve God with all your heart and you'll be ready at that time in season a brother man never stop preaching he never said well I'm giving up I'm past 45 I just give up on God I'll just retire no he just kept going and trusted God for the right time in season why didn't God preached that long on that quote and if I'm ever gonna do anything that I have I should do it now and I'm so thankful what he has shown me in the Gospels and how I'm so glad of that says this in 1954 he did not have the tenth Bishop he didn't gonna realize the third polis company until two years later program thinks this will be the best time right now I'm 45 this would be the best time and he's little did he know two years later God was going to show up I got so much greater things for you you think you're you're probably now he's actually not you actually be at your best at the end of your life Thank You Dee it's gonna be now it's gonna be when I'm 50 45 years old let's not put a limit on God let's be open to what God wants to do with us in the future look at this he says this in 54 and yet I just can't satisfy myself somehow I just hunger for God how many hunger for God out there there's just something I ought to be doing looks like and I just can't get to doing it right it was here years ago I used to tell you I could just reach after something to almost touch it you see it just seems like to me there's something else out there I'm just almost touching somewhere if I could only get to that spot and then it would be fine it was right there something he can almost touch Oh wouldn't come down till 1963 amen ha ha ha I know yeah that was the third pole Oh glory amen 9 years before the sword came down he says like I reach out and touch it ha ha ha he was so feathering sharp he said oh my and just fit perfectly in my hand but 9 years earlier he's like I just feel like I'm so close to something church you and I may feel like we're so close to something we're so close to the Holy Ghost revival we're so close to seeing more so say just keep reaching out just keep reaching out yeah I'm gonna fill that and just keep reaching out the spirit people even God let's let God do it in the season nine years away but he never gave up on God remember when he preaches seven seal he said here it is the one with the seventh seal the thing I wondered my whole life he said the other seals medow after me of course oh but you don't know what this is meant for me for one time in my life I prayed I cried to God after that Phoenix meeting I laid the mountains one morning God when Sabino Canyon and he said I went down there and there's a little foot trail and he goes and talks about the sword coming down the thing he wonder what's the purpose of my life am I to go out west why am i compelled to go out west what am I supposed to do with my life and he said after he felt that seven-day joy he said this is the thing I wondered my whole life to preach the seven seals praise God is that beautiful church Dorie hmm I kind of feel like that too I feel like there's just something out there like some vigorous I mean even Simon left me a letter last time you said God is gonna send a revival just keep waiting for it and church I don't care if God doesn't add any more people here as long as everybody here feels revived in the Holy Spirit and God's wind can just blow through here and get everybody reel on fire loving Jesus Christ well let's see I better find a place to stop here let me look at that real quick yeah let me close with this this will encourage you not to give up Church we got to keep sighing crying for the domination done the city we have to in this quote program tells us that the time and seasonal rat is at the closing of time and the love of many shall wax cold but that doesn't mean we stop praying we should keep reaching out in the spirit church keep praying keep believing keep asking God to move I do it every year service almost this morning or I'm sorry this evening I'm here at the altar crying out to God say God that signs miracles and wonders be done by the name with our Holy Child Jesus I'll keep crying for it coz I feel like it's just right out there in front of me get all those rabbit he said I want to ask you a question I ask you this question we'll close as quick as I can I'm gonna close the night - after this quote there's a couple slides so bear with me what would take place today if the Holy Ghost went through Jeffersonville new album Louisville to seal those that this afternoon who would be at home God send the revival just so hungry for a meeting Oh God look at the sins of the city oh isn't it terrible God oh won't you please send a revival God send some good preacher send someone oh Lord let the Holy Ghost where would he seal think of that praise God so in other words are you and I praying this in our homes who's praying this at home o God send revival Oh God stir up the church Oh God let people get the Holy Ghost at church Oh God fill the children with the Holy Ghost glory now well brother branham what do you mean I mean this and I say this now reverent walking on brittle threads I believe that day is about finished then that's in is in see the doors are closing together if you don't have to have that burden no more you don't have that burden no more Billy Graham's had meetings all across the country oh Roberts all the rest of us we've cried and prayed and pray and everything else but you see the doors are closed and that's him that's filthy I'm quoting scripture revelation 20 to be filthy still than him that's righteous righteous still him that's holy holy still and I believe the doors Gentiles disclosure together see the day the time the season is just about over just a few more to come in I'm glad that I'm one of those few right in the door come in closer I slipped in the door looks like this is slipping in there say thank you hard right before the door shut haha our little children got even in even closer right the reason you can't have no kind of me like that there's no travail of soul you just don't get that burden I remember years ago you always heard me talk about the sawdust trails and things in the tabernacle that didn't make it anymore not a bit more and then but then it was fresh God was calling his church I've seen them sobbing crying lay on the altar all night long I went to their houses

the tears flowing down there you know walk into this church walk down to another church and hear them there there's a precious fountain Oh God saved my boy saved my daughter she's lost lord please you

abound the love of many would fail see grow cold the love is dying away and what they got into just the form beat the piano up and down real hard and holler glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord see
