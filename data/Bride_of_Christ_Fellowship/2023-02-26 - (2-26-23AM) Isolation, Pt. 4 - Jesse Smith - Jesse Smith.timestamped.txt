[0:17] everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus

[1:17] make it
[1:19] so I said brother cam could you and
[1:20] three or four of your families maybe
[1:21] come the next month and we could have
[1:23] Revival services at our church and he
[1:25] said definitely
[1:26] uh
[1:28] so
[1:29] totally understand if you you know you

[1:32] just I really feel like I need some time
[1:34] in the presence of Lord there

[1:38] so I like to
[1:39] be a part of that by God's grace

[1:52] brother Brian
[1:54] he's a faithful servant so
[1:56] I'm very thankful for God's grace
[1:58] Genesis 3 verse 8.
[2:02] it's like to preach on Isolation part
[2:05] four
[2:06] with a subtopic of hiding from God you
[2:09] remember last week brother cam preached
[2:10] on Adam and Eve hid from God
[2:13] and how you know that applies to us both
[2:16] random said the same and so when I heard
[2:18] cam say that and they call it that's a
[2:19] good sermon that would line up with the
[2:22] isolation series
[2:24] I don't know if I got 10 sermons out of
[2:26] Cam's sermon but I at least got two
[2:28] Wednesday and then today
[2:31] probably some more by God's grace
[2:34] so blessed to hear those words of life
[2:38] verse 8.
[2:41] well I'll read in verse 8 and then I'll
[2:42] read nine and ten myself so let's do
[2:44] that one two three and they heard the
[2:47] voice of the Lord God Walking In The
[2:49] Garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[2:53] and his wife hid themselves from the
[2:55] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[2:58] Trees of the garden now read nine and
[3:01] ten and the Lord God called unto Adam
[3:03] and said unto him where art thou
[3:05] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[3:07] garden I was afraid because I was naked
[3:10] and I hid myself let's have one more
[3:12] word of prayer if you have a need on
[3:13] your heart let's just make it known unto
[3:15] God today
[3:16] Heavenly Father we just want to give you
[3:18] thanks and praise for today Lord God
[3:19] thank you Lord that you are our portion
[3:22] Lord God in this text right here Lord
[3:24] Adam and Eve had lost
[3:26] their anointing they had lost their
[3:28] their innocence all they had was you
[3:30] Lord God Satan had stole from them Lord
[3:34] God the enemy comes to steal kill and
[3:36] destroy but Lord you have come that we
[3:38] might have life and have it more
[3:39] abundantly Lord
[3:41] so Lord even in this text you are the
[3:43] portion Lord that we have need of the
[3:45] Lord God so we thank you Lord God
[3:47] Hallelujah in our in our moments of
[3:49] Shame and our moments of guilt you are
[3:52] always our portion dear Gods we thank
[3:53] you God Lord I'm drawing on your
[3:56] inspiration from last Sunday's the Lord
[3:58] just guide me I'm just reporting for
[4:00] service as well I Need Your Grace today
[4:02] Lord of God each and every one of us
[4:03] Lord are relying upon you Lorna are you
[4:06] Minister each and every need today God
[4:08] may your will be accomplished for today
[4:10] Lord we're happy to gather it's a joy to
[4:12] gather and thank you for Lord seeing all
[4:15] the saints and be with our sisters see
[4:16] you Lord I pray God you'd restore her
[4:18] story
[4:18] father bless this reading of Thy word
[4:20] meet every need I pray in Jesus Christ's
[4:23] name the saint said amen God bless you
[4:25] as you're being seated
[4:37] hard to imagine the
[4:40] depths
[4:42] guilt and shame that Adam and Eve must
[4:45] have felt In This Moment
[4:47] we don't know how long but for some time
[4:49] they had enjoyed perfect Fellowship
[4:53] brother Brandon dramatized I've reached
[4:55] a message on this I think last year
[4:56] about the cool of the evening
[4:58] and brother random said you know for a
[5:01] while they had perfect fellowship with
[5:03] God
[5:04] Adam would take Eve around the garden
[5:07] show her
[5:09] all the animals
[5:11] they would experience
[5:14] nature and its perfect condition
[5:17] so the ram says that you know that Adam
[5:19] could calm the winds by the spoken word
[5:25] for the ram said that they would lay
[5:26] down with the tiger the male tiger and
[5:29] the she tiger
[5:32] and they had perfect Fellowship
[5:36] and then it's hard to imagine you know
[5:38] how they would feel In This Moment
[5:41] you know as Eve somehow gets away from
[5:43] Adam
[5:45] she got away from her headship
[5:48] and somehow she gets alone with the
[5:50] serpent and this human-like creature is
[5:53] able to
[5:54] talk to Eve and
[5:57] disarm her
[5:59] spiritually
[6:01] somehow able to talk to her and
[6:03] deceive her that somehow
[6:06] that God's word wasn't true
[6:09] that God was holding them back from
[6:11] something and church let's just remind
[6:13] ourselves God's not holding us back from
[6:15] anything today praise God wants us to
[6:17] live an Abundant Life praise God
[6:20] the only case is is that you know if we
[6:22] feel like we're held back it's probably
[6:23] our own feelings and they're probably
[6:25] wrong
[6:26] all right or we just got to wait on
[6:28] God's time for something praise God we
[6:31] really got to look and see what did God
[6:32] promise me
[6:35] right some people think you know God
[6:36] made a promise of this or that but
[6:38] really got to make sure it's really from
[6:39] God
[6:40] what did God promise me
[6:43] God didn't promise us a flowery bed of
[6:45] ease
[6:46] right that's why we were made to be
[6:48] soldiers
[6:50] we're like it under soldiers we're
[6:51] liking under Vineyard workers at the end
[6:53] of the day
[6:55] picking the grapes
[6:58] there were big Grapes of course I don't
[6:59] know
[6:59] but that's like but this is the
[7:01] illustration God gives us
[7:03] and somehow Satan is able to deceive her
[7:06] and say
[7:08] you won't die but God knows this so
[7:11] Satan always makes it seem like he knows
[7:14] more than what we know
[7:16] regarding what God thinks
[7:19] Satan thinks he can convince us of what
[7:22] God really means and we don't need Satan
[7:25] to interpret the word to us hallelujah
[7:26] God's word interprets itself
[7:29] Hallelujah as we heard brother cam
[7:31] beautifully say why didn't Eve just say
[7:33] well just wait I'll just wait till God
[7:35] comes down
[7:36] what a beautiful thought that was I I'll
[7:38] just wait to hear from my husband let me
[7:40] talk to my husband first before I make a
[7:42] decision
[7:43] what a great lesson church that we we
[7:45] should all learn to wait upon the Lord
[7:48] let's wait if there's a question
[7:49] Hallelujah if there's a question let's
[7:51] put it before God and wait for the
[7:53] answer from God
[7:55] let's not make uh let's not make a
[7:57] choice before we actually have the right
[7:59] answer praise God
[8:00] let's go before God In Prayer especially
[8:03] if it's questionable brother says if
[8:04] there's anything questionable he says
[8:06] don't do it
[8:09] so let's really wait upon the Lord as we
[8:11] uh as we ask you know questions and as
[8:15] we we wonder about things and
[8:17] and so at some point
[8:19] Eve lets her guard down and has uh this
[8:22] intimate action with the serpent
[8:25] and uh in that moment we don't even know
[8:28] how she felt
[8:30] we don't even know how how either of
[8:33] them fell and then Adam comes here Adam
[8:35] finds Eve in the state and she's got the
[8:38] she's had the forbidden fruit and and
[8:41] Adam realizes she's going to die if I
[8:43] don't participate with her
[8:45] and so then Adam partakes and as soon as
[8:48] they they're done
[8:49] as soon as they're done we would just
[8:51] dramatize a cold wind blows over
[8:56] we'd say and and the perfect conditions
[8:59] now change
[9:01] and they go find leaves they pick leaves
[9:04] off a tree and sow them together
[9:07] and try to clothe himself with fig
[9:09] leaves
[9:12] and right on schedule god comes down at
[9:15] the cool of the evening
[9:17] and the Bible says the voice of God was
[9:19] walking praise God
[9:21] God's voice walks amen God's voice moves
[9:25] I'll say like this God's voice comes
[9:27] looking for us praise God
[9:29] Hallelujah God's voice goes walking in
[9:32] the garden and think of the level of
[9:34] Shame and guilt that they felt Eve is
[9:36] now feeling guilty for two intimate Acts
[9:40] two
[9:42] two oh I broke God's word there
[9:45] I I took I took one that was not my
[9:48] husband
[9:49] and then with my husband
[9:52] and she feels ashamed uh how could we
[9:55] imagine more shame than that
[9:58] and she knew better
[9:59] right she knew the word of God
[10:02] and then Adam here feels shame ashamed
[10:05] and God's voice comes to them in just a
[10:07] beautiful picture of God going after
[10:10] mankind to redeem them
[10:13] God did not let them stay separated but
[10:15] God went to them praise God hallelujah
[10:18] amen Oh Amazing Grace amen
[10:21] God God initiated the Redemption praise
[10:24] God Adam and Eve didn't initiate
[10:26] Redemption so God had to initiate I'll
[10:29] redeem my own Fallen children who have
[10:32] gone against my word and they've
[10:34] transgressed my Covenant they've broken
[10:35] my law but God wasn't surprised amen
[10:37] because God already before the
[10:39] foundation world had slain the lamb in
[10:42] his mind amen
[10:43] so God is just seeing it all play out
[10:46] you see it all play out he had this
[10:48] perfect plan praise God
[10:50] someone said this week some preacher
[10:52] said that this wasn't the perfect will
[10:54] of God it hadn't been the perfect will
[10:55] of God
[10:57] God allowing his children to sin had to
[10:59] be the perfect will of God or else the
[11:01] lamb slain the mind of God wasn't the
[11:03] perfect one of God
[11:05] right it had to be God had to God wanted
[11:08] to write a story of redemption praise
[11:10] God
[11:11] it had to been
[11:13] and then the Bible says in Romans 12
[11:15] that you and I can prove the perfect
[11:17] will of God
[11:18] the perfect will
[11:20] the perfect not a permissive but we can
[11:22] prove we're in the perfect will of God
[11:26] and so God finds his children in the
[11:29] most utter shame they could possibly
[11:31] imagine no doubt they're PR they're
[11:33] probably cold right after the sin and
[11:34] and also got his leaves when was the
[11:36] last time leaves made you warm can
[11:38] anybody think of that anybody been out
[11:40] there in the in the fall or the spring
[11:42] and well I'm a little cold I think I'll
[11:44] go I'll go put some leaves together and
[11:45] try to warm myself
[11:47] they were they weren't the leads weren't
[11:49] accomplishing what they wanted them to
[11:50] accomplish it was a man-made religion
[11:53] just like a denomination in other words
[11:55] they went to a denomination instead of
[11:56] going to God hallelujah
[11:58] a man-made way for coverage a a man-made
[12:02] covering we'd say
[12:04] man-made religion but man religion fails
[12:07] every time
[12:08] you and I are trying to be good good
[12:10] enough and make it to heaven on our own
[12:11] merits will never work we've got to make
[12:14] it by the grace of God hallelujah we've
[12:16] gotta we've got to recognize that God
[12:18] will provide himself a sacrifice praise
[12:21] God
[12:21] and we've just got to accept his
[12:23] sacrifice
[12:25] like like brother Brown says you know
[12:27] our our father and mother according to
[12:29] the flesh you know are the first parents
[12:31] the first ones are the ones that hid
[12:33] from God
[12:35] right they hide themselves
[12:38] and uh and then God brother man said God
[12:41] went shouting Adam where are you
[12:44] Eve where are you
[12:47] and God was showing his desperate love
[12:49] for his children
[12:51] the ram said he shouted we'll get to the
[12:53] quote in just a moment here
[12:55] God says where are now God knew where he
[12:57] was now look at this God
[12:59] is a drama writer
[13:01] God loves drama because God knew where
[13:03] they were
[13:05] but he says where are you but God knew
[13:07] where they were
[13:09] God loves drama God loves to move our
[13:11] emotions amen right
[13:14] he loves it when we can cry for him or
[13:16] Rejoice for him
[13:18] Hallelujah he loves emotion he loves he
[13:21] loves showing us his grace and
[13:22] compassion and he cries out where are
[13:25] you where are you son where's where's my
[13:27] daughter
[13:29] and Adam says I heard your voice and I
[13:33] was afraid
[13:34] instead of this instead of God's voice
[13:36] being soothing like it used to be now it
[13:39] causes fear
[13:41] same voice The Voice never changed but
[13:44] the believer's uh lives changed the
[13:47] Believers uh condition their minds
[13:50] changed same voice
[13:54] and so he says I was afraid because I
[13:56] was naked and I hid myself
[14:00] and he said who told thee that thou was
[14:02] naked
[14:04] hast thou eat another tree where have I
[14:06] commanded thee that thou shouldest not
[14:07] eat and again God knows the answer this
[14:09] question
[14:11] but he likes to he likes to dramatize he
[14:13] likes to pull out a people he likes to
[14:15] discern the thoughts and intents of
[14:17] their hearts praise God
[14:20] he wants his creatures to see what's in
[14:22] their heart praise God
[14:23] so they can they can uh they can repent
[14:26] of what's in their heart and let God
[14:27] form a new heart in them praise God
[14:32] and notice the man
[14:34] what does he say
[14:36] he says the woman whom thou gave us to
[14:38] me she gave me of the tree
[14:40] and I did eat
[14:42] so again he he puts the blame off
[14:45] himself
[14:46] where does Adam ever take responsibility
[14:48] in this text
[14:50] he doesn't
[14:51] he puts it off
[14:53] on his wife
[14:55] so he learned a lot of great lessons
[14:56] church when we when we sin or if we if
[14:59] we were Sinners when we were Sinners
[15:01] before we got saved
[15:02] we didn't want to admit our mistakes
[15:06] but God wants us to admit our mistakes
[15:08] praise God
[15:09] and we see and character If we're honest
[15:12] with ourselves sometimes we don't admit
[15:13] our mistakes even after we're saved
[15:15] praise God
[15:16] right
[15:18] we don't always say it's not easy to
[15:20] admit our mistakes
[15:22] but we see this example this we see how
[15:24] this is Humanities this is our flesh's
[15:26] natural reaction blame somebody else
[15:32] so see that when we we're in a shameful
[15:35] a guilty condition
[15:38] when we're ashamed of ourselves we have
[15:40] to make sure that we don't push the
[15:41] blame on other people we got to push the
[15:43] blame on ourselves praise God
[15:46] right none of us are going to be able to
[15:48] point the finger at God and say Lord you
[15:49] never made a way for me to make the
[15:50] rapture
[15:51] or Lord you never made a way for me to
[15:53] get the Holy Ghost the Bible says if any
[15:56] man hunger and thirst praise God
[15:59] let him come and drink on the Waters of
[16:01] Life freely praise God the only he said
[16:04] everybody all you have to do is come and
[16:06] drink praise God
[16:08] whosoever will
[16:10] let him come
[16:13] I like where brother random says he said
[16:15] Adam realized he was lost and he know
[16:16] that he had done wrong and it made
[16:18] manifest before him that he was in the
[16:20] wrong instead of calling oh Father come
[16:23] to me I've lost so instead of running to
[16:25] God say God I broke your commands he
[16:27] went and he goes and hides
[16:31] he went the wrong direction praise God
[16:33] he put it in reverse and said I put it
[16:35] in forward
[16:37] right he said I've done wrong I've been
[16:39] deceived come to me
[16:41] now the Bible says he wasn't deceived
[16:43] right so there we go again how not every
[16:44] word on the tapes is thus saith alone
[16:46] right the Bible said he wasn't deceived
[16:49] and it was God going up in the gar up
[16:51] and down the garden screaming Adam where
[16:53] are thou
[16:54] isn't that the same today
[16:56] you can show men or women by the word of
[16:58] God when a person's failed
[17:02] right
[17:03] isn't that how you know we try to
[17:06] interact with people we we ask God Lord
[17:08] give me a moment I can witness to
[17:09] somebody
[17:10] and let me show them their wrongs we
[17:12] know they're wrong we've seen their
[17:13] lives so many times and we just say God
[17:15] give me a chance to show them they're
[17:17] wrong and church nine times out of ten
[17:20] when we get that chance they just stay
[17:22] right in the same thing they're doing
[17:24] because that's Fallen Humanity
[17:27] Hallelujah few there be that find this
[17:29] narrow road but God in his grace makes a
[17:32] way so everybody knows there is a road
[17:34] praise God
[17:35] there is a way out of sin amen there is
[17:38] a way of Holiness praise God
[17:40] Hallelujah
[17:43] Adam had failed he failed the word of
[17:44] God now like what Albert Barnes says
[17:47] here Adam confesses he's afraid of God
[17:49] but because he was naked but there's an
[17:52] instinctive hiding of his thoughts from
[17:54] God In This Very speech so he responds
[17:56] to God but he doesn't he doesn't he
[17:58] doesn't do he doesn't say all he should
[18:00] have said
[18:01] he mentions the nakedness but not the
[18:04] Disobedience from where it arose
[18:07] so God I'm feeling this way but I'm not
[18:09] ex I'm not confessing why I feel this
[18:12] way
[18:13] it was my fault I'm feeling this way he
[18:15] should have said I've sinned I went
[18:17] against your commands and I'm feeling
[18:18] naked
[18:21] right
[18:23] so we see he's not learning he didn't
[18:25] confess the right way but Jesus then in
[18:27] the gospels shows us the correct
[18:30] confession
[18:31] we see the Holy Spirit coming to the uh
[18:34] The Prodigal and the pig bed and the
[18:37] Bible said he finally comes to himself
[18:39] amen he finally comes to his right mind
[18:41] and he said I'll go to my father and
[18:43] I'll say I've sinned against heaven and
[18:45] I've sinned against you praise God
[18:48] and so Jesus shows us this is the way
[18:50] back praise God
[18:52] to recognize you you have to go to the
[18:55] person you sinned against you've got to
[18:56] you got to go back to God the God you've
[18:59] sinned against
[19:01] and you have to say first of all I'm
[19:03] guilty I'm the one who sinned Lord God
[19:05] forgive me the guilt's on me I need
[19:08] Mercy praise God the fact that Satan
[19:10] wants to lie to us and tell us there is
[19:12] no more Mercy there's still Mercy praise
[19:15] God
[19:15] Hallelujah as long as there's time here
[19:18] there's still Mercy praise God
[19:21] God still has Grace for us praise God it
[19:24] hasn't run out
[19:26] Hallelujah
[19:30] so we see that's how a real son or
[19:32] daughter of God repents praise God but
[19:35] we're not perfect I'm not saying I'm not
[19:36] patting myself on the back saying I
[19:38] always run to God when I make mistakes
[19:40] I don't think you would say that either
[19:44] but we see we see two examples Adam and
[19:47] then we see the prodigal
[19:48] and we want to strive to be a prodigal
[19:51] praise God
[19:52] now I know we're already saved and
[19:53] everything about but it's the example
[19:54] it's the idea of I realize I've come to
[19:56] myself I realize what I've done and I'm
[19:58] going to go to God and I'm going to
[20:00] confess my sins
[20:03] and then the Bible said and Adam called
[20:05] his wife's name Eve because she was the
[20:07] mother of all living unto Adam also
[20:10] and to his wife did the Lord God make
[20:12] coats of skins and clothe them
[20:15] so here God provides forgiveness for
[20:17] Adam and Eve through a sacrifice and
[20:19] they get clothed in their sacrifice
[20:21] talking about hiding from God
[20:24] So Adam and Eve isolated themselves
[20:27] but then God comes to find them and then
[20:29] God covers over their sins
[20:32] they're feeling ashamed they're feeling
[20:34] naked they're feeling exposed and God
[20:36] said I'm going to cover your shame amen
[20:39] I'm going to provide a sacrifice that
[20:41] will cover your shame and you won't feel
[20:43] ashamed anymore praise God hallelujah
[20:46] this is God's mercy this is God's grace
[20:49] amen this is what God does when we
[20:51] isolate ourselves he comes us and brings
[20:53] us out of our own isolation amen
[20:55] Hallelujah
[20:57] I love what Matthew Henry said he said
[20:59] but God made them coats of skin large
[21:01] strong durable fit for them
[21:05] see God didn't make a mini skirt for Eve
[21:07] the Bible said it went down from her her
[21:09] shoulder all the way down to her her
[21:10] feet praise God
[21:12] if you look it up in the Hebrew
[21:14] such is the righteousness of Christ
[21:16] therefore put you on the Lord Jesus
[21:19] Christ
[21:20] God will always provide us with a
[21:22] covering that's fit for us praise God
[21:26] 's not going to forgive just half our
[21:28] sin and then leave the rest hanging
[21:29] there to make us feel guilty God's going
[21:31] to cover over all of it praise God
[21:34] he's going to give you exactly what you
[21:35] need praise God because he's the one
[21:37] that came to say praise God and he wants
[21:40] to love you you're his child praise God
[21:41] he wants you to walk in truth amen
[21:44] God Will Make A Way
[21:46] so church if God made a way for Adam and
[21:48] Eve to cover their sins and and as as
[21:51] awful as they were sexual right
[21:54] Disobedience so thus say the Lord all
[21:57] these things direct Disobedience if God
[21:59] was faithful to close clothe them out of
[22:01] their mistakes God will be faithful to
[22:03] clothe us as well praise God
[22:05] amen
[22:08] that's what the Bible says here
[22:10] in the context Paul says let us walk
[22:12] honestly as in the day how many had a
[22:14] good honest week Hallelujah told the
[22:17] truth
[22:18] did what was right
[22:19] didn't deceive anybody
[22:22] not in rioting and drunkenness thank God
[22:24] we're not writing and there's no
[22:25] drunkenness praise God not in chambering
[22:28] and lanternness I can never say that
[22:30] word not in strife and envying so Strife
[22:34] is is battles and arguments with others
[22:37] and envying is wanting what belongs to
[22:38] someone else coveting
[22:40] so that that's these are examples of of
[22:43] not putting on Christ of Walking In the
[22:45] Flesh but Paul says put you on the Lord
[22:48] Jesus Christ and do not make provision
[22:51] for the flesh to fulfill the lust
[22:53] thereof
[22:54] in other words don't plan out a
[22:56] dishonest Act
[22:57] don't plan out rioting or drunkenness or
[23:01] these I can't remember what those were
[23:02] or strive for end ring or any sin don't
[23:05] plan it out
[23:07] but just stay faithful to God put you on
[23:10] the Lord Jesus Christ keep the anointing
[23:12] of Christ on our lives praise God and
[23:15] starve the flesh don't feed the flesh
[23:16] but keep the anointing of the spirit of
[23:19] God on your life praise God
[23:22] amen
[23:23] So Adam and Eve were clothed with
[23:25] literal lambskins but we're closed with
[23:27] the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[23:29] Hallelujah that's how we know we got the
[23:32] anointing on we're not walking in the
[23:34] flesh we're walking in the spirit
[23:36] Glory
[23:38] Paul says the same thing another place
[23:40] therefore If any man be in Christ he's a
[23:42] new creature old things are passed away
[23:43] behold all things are become new
[23:46] and all things are of God who hath
[23:49] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[23:52] it hath given to us the ministry of
[23:55] reconciliation
[23:57] so I want to look at that definition or
[23:59] reconciliation is to exchange we have a
[24:02] we have a Ministry of change a Ministry
[24:05] of exchange as when you exchange coins
[24:07] for equivalent value
[24:09] think about that
[24:12] this also means we have the ministry of
[24:14] returning to favor with God
[24:17] we were out of favor with God but now
[24:19] we're in favor with God
[24:22] your ministry is now a Ministry to show
[24:25] people the favor of God
[24:29] right and it's not uh it's not the
[24:33] it's not the Prosperity Gospel that's
[24:35] not the gospel
[24:37] the gospel is Jesus Christ forgives your
[24:39] sins fills you with the Holy Ghost and
[24:41] prepares you for battle praise God
[24:43] hallelujah that's right
[24:46] and God will give you favor in your
[24:49] battles praise God because listen Church
[24:51] we're all going to have battles we're
[24:52] all going to have struggles like like
[24:54] Ecclesiastes says all these things are
[24:55] common to all men but there's only one
[24:58] group that has a favor of God that's the
[25:00] group that's except accepted the
[25:01] sacrifice of Christ Hallelujah
[25:04] amen we have a Ministry of favor a
[25:08] Reconciliation
[25:10] to it God was in Christ reconciling the
[25:12] world unto himself
[25:14] so God used the body of Jesus to give
[25:17] favor back to the Believers not imputing
[25:20] their trespasses unto them
[25:22] and hath committed unto us the word of
[25:24] favor or the word of reconciliation the
[25:27] word of change
[25:29] now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[25:34] as though God did beseech You by us we
[25:36] pray you in Christ's dead be you
[25:38] reconciled to God
[25:40] so Paul Paul says I'm in Christ's stead
[25:43] I'm in Christ's place I'm Paul will say
[25:45] I'm preaching today and it's I'm
[25:46] standing in Jesus place in other words
[25:48] if Jesus was here he would say be
[25:50] reconciled to me praise God
[25:52] Hallelujah
[25:55] for he hath me here's here's the
[25:57] exchange he hath made Jesus to be our
[26:00] sin
[26:02] who knew no sin that we might be made
[26:04] the righteousness of God in him
[26:07] so when God looked at Adam and Eve and
[26:09] the Skins he saw righteous
[26:11] and he saw the Lambs were were guilty
[26:15] he exchanged it oh my God hallelujah he
[26:18] reconciled them praise God I now see you
[26:21] as righteous yes there's consequences
[26:23] but I see you as righteous praise God
[26:25] we're back in Fellowship we can have
[26:27] communion again praise God
[26:29] Hallelujah
[26:31] so the same thing happens with us but we
[26:34] have a far much more greater sacrifice
[26:36] amen hallelujah praise God Amen
[26:40] far greater
[26:43] now we're ambassadors for Christ
[26:45] we're representatives of Christ now we
[26:49] can't take this too far and say uh we're
[26:51] the greatest people on the Earth I
[26:52] wouldn't say we don't go that far
[26:54] but we are in the place of Christ we are
[26:57] in the place of Jesus disciples we are
[27:01] the True Believers for this day and our
[27:05] ministry is a Ministry of reconciliation
[27:07] it's our duty to let others know that
[27:10] God can favor you if you repent of your
[27:13] sins God will favor you God will bless
[27:15] your life praise God
[27:17] in other words don't hide from God
[27:18] praise God don't hide from him come to
[27:22] him and God will give you favor praise
[27:24] God
[27:24] because every single person has to do
[27:27] this amen there's not one of us that
[27:29] doesn't have to come to God we all need
[27:31] to come to God we all need to repent of
[27:33] our sins we all need God's favor God's
[27:35] drawing all of us to him praise God
[27:39] so park in other words be saying I'm
[27:41] giving we have the ministry of
[27:43] reconciliation because we've been
[27:44] reconciled
[27:46] Hallelujah we know what it's like to be
[27:48] saved and forgiven we know what it's
[27:49] like to to fall short of God's glory and
[27:52] we also know it's like to go from God's
[27:54] anger to God's favor Hallelujah
[27:57] we've had that Divine exchange amen
[27:59] hallelujah
[28:00] thank the Lord
[28:03] and so see after we confess then God
[28:05] sees our sacrifice
[28:07] because the Bible says for ye are dead
[28:10] now I'm alive today you're alive today
[28:13] so what does this mean it means your
[28:16] desire for sin the unbelief of your soul
[28:20] is dead
[28:21] because the Bible said you were dead in
[28:23] sins
[28:24] but you've been quickened by Christ
[28:27] Hallelujah
[28:28] so we are dead and your life is hid with
[28:33] Christ in God
[28:36] Hallelujah that's just that's a verse I
[28:39] think we could marinate on for a couple
[28:40] a couple hours by God's grace I could
[28:42] probably preach a few hours on that
[28:45] your life you are dead and your life is
[28:48] hidden with Christ in God what is your
[28:50] life it has to be your soul
[28:52] right
[28:54] your flesh isn't in in God right
[28:58] your flesh is in the world
[29:00] right your mind
[29:01] your mind is sometimes is too much on
[29:03] the world
[29:04] and the church said
[29:06] right we are our mind gets on worldly
[29:08] things and it's not always in God
[29:10] but if our soul is saved if our soul is
[29:12] filled with the Holy Ghost then that is
[29:14] our life and God hides it with Christ in
[29:18] God hallelujah
[29:20] our life is hid with Christ in God
[29:24] Hallelujah and then is that a beautiful
[29:26] thought
[29:28] as much as Satan attacks us and as we go
[29:30] through the daily battles of life we
[29:32] have this assurance that when I'm under
[29:34] when I'm under attack when I'm going
[29:36] through difficult times we have this
[29:38] assurance I can hide in Christ
[29:40] Hallelujah
[29:41] the Bible didn't say your life will be
[29:43] hidden in Christ the Bible says your
[29:45] life is hid in Christ praise God
[29:48] so in all of our trials and all of our
[29:50] deepest darkest moments or our greatest
[29:53] uh trials that we go through we have
[29:56] this this confidence that God hides our
[29:59] life in Christ so in other words no
[30:02] matter what happens is natural life I've
[30:04] got spiritual life amen no matter what
[30:07] happens in the natural flesh I've got
[30:09] eternal life praise God
[30:11] and Satan can't touch that if that life
[30:13] is in God then Satan can't touch it
[30:15] hallelujah oh thank God Amen
[30:20] you know many of our battles we can see
[30:22] then
[30:22] in all of our battles we just have to
[30:24] differentiate between the body the mind
[30:26] and the soul
[30:30] see because how many times Church in the
[30:33] midst of our trials how many times we
[30:34] feel like oh I'm really hiding in God
[30:38] if we don't feel like that then we're
[30:39] spending too much time in in the mind
[30:41] right or dwelling on the flesh rather
[30:44] than knowing the confidence that we have
[30:46] for our soul is in Christ
[30:49] see I just thought that was a blessing
[30:52] praise God so there's no reason to hide
[30:54] from God he wants us to hide in him
[30:56] praise God
[30:58] hide in him
[31:01] Little Brown says it here plainly in a
[31:03] future home Satan cannot bother how many
[31:06] can say Amen to that
[31:08] well who was he bothering this week who
[31:10] I'm gonna raise my hand
[31:12] well Satan can't bother you he's talking
[31:13] about your soul
[31:15] Hallelujah
[31:16] he can tempt but he cannot get in other
[31:18] words he cannot make you cannot make you
[31:20] leave the faith right
[31:22] he cannot get a born-again Christian for
[31:24] God from the foundation world for Psalm
[31:26] and sent Jesus to redeem him and the
[31:28] blood speaks for him
[31:30] then the Bible say the blood of Jesus
[31:32] speaks better than that of Abel
[31:35] how can he sin when it can't be seen
[31:38] even by God
[31:41] the soul we're talking about the soul
[31:43] how can the Soul sin when it when Jesus
[31:47] has has filled that soul with the Holy
[31:49] Ghost praise God and when Jesus given a
[31:52] portion of his Spirit into that soul
[31:54] that Soul can never sin the Bible says
[31:57] Hallelujah
[31:59] the only thing he hears is your voice he
[32:02] sees your representation praise God
[32:07] beautiful
[32:09] so what does God want to hear today God
[32:11] wants to hear your voice
[32:13] God wants to hear my voice
[32:16] when we have sin or when we have any
[32:18] fault that separates us from God we're
[32:20] not to isolate ourselves and hide from
[32:22] God we are to go to God praise God
[32:25] and remember that I've got a sacrifice
[32:27] that sacrifice covers me that sacrifice
[32:30] forgives my sins and then God will hear
[32:33] my voice calling out through the
[32:35] sacrifice Hallelujah
[32:37] oh it's a beautiful thing amen just like
[32:40] Adam and Eve after they got the coats on
[32:42] they were crying out through their
[32:44] sacrifice praise God
[32:45] they had their sacrifice on God saw
[32:47] their sacrifice their coats but it was
[32:50] their voice praise God so it is with us
[32:52] it's our voice but we're clothed in
[32:54] Jesus's righteousness praise God
[32:59] Hallelujah
[33:01] and this is what job this is the secret
[33:03] job had we've gone through many times
[33:06] how he had all these sins he had fear he
[33:08] had Pride all these things but the one
[33:10] thing he did he continually sacrificed
[33:13] to God
[33:15] isn't that why you come to church today
[33:16] how many how many did that say
[33:18] the Bible says come to come into the
[33:20] house Lord with Thanksgiving we
[33:21] sacrifice the praise
[33:23] that's why we love coming to church
[33:25] that's why we got to come to church all
[33:26] the time continually thus did job
[33:28] continually
[33:29] he would sacrifice for his children
[33:32] praise God
[33:34] he would make those sacrifices now
[33:35] church that's what we've got to remember
[33:37] we're the ones who have to make
[33:38] sacrifices for our parents and our
[33:40] siblings
[33:41] we're the ones
[33:42] that's our responsibility
[33:45] let's not forget that
[33:48] so job had a revelation I'm forgiven
[33:51] through my sacrifice and then God I'm
[33:54] trusting in God to save my children
[33:57] through these sacrifices
[33:59] job couldn't do it they had their own
[34:00] free more agency but job's sacrifice and
[34:03] asked God to make a way that his
[34:06] children could be saved because what was
[34:07] going to happen very shortly they were
[34:08] going to die
[34:10] isn't that something God put it on job's
[34:13] heart to do all that sacrificing because
[34:14] they were going to be taken off the
[34:15] scene very soon
[34:17] that's what we've got to see the same
[34:19] that's why we got to be that's why we
[34:20] got to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit
[34:24] right we just had sister who is Dad go
[34:26] off the scene right for the bangs there
[34:28] it's Thursday
[34:31] see how the Holy Spirit prepares for
[34:32] that
[34:33] that service before
[34:35] two days before
[34:38] now going forward we want to be very
[34:40] sensitive to what the holy spirit says
[34:43] let's remember church thank God for the
[34:45] blood of Christ for our lives we thank
[34:46] God for that but let's remember we are
[34:49] Kings and Priests unto God as well
[34:51] where priests I think it was Karis come
[34:54] up for prayer on Wednesday or somebody
[34:55] come up for prayer in intercession and
[34:57] it happens often and that's a that's a
[34:59] beautiful thing
[35:01] I think we had that a few weeks ago and
[35:04] and when one of the children asked for
[35:06] intercession that's the one where the
[35:07] Holy Spirit I felt fell on me the
[35:10] the the most
[35:12] was interceding and what do we find job
[35:14] doing job was constantly praying God
[35:16] forgive my children if they'd done
[35:18] anything wrong forgive my children
[35:20] because he was sensitive to the Holy
[35:22] Spirit and they were going to leave the
[35:24] scene very soon
[35:29] a church you don't have to raise your
[35:30] hands but I think all of us want to be
[35:31] sensitive because with Souls it's
[35:33] between life and death
[35:36] once once someone is down in the in the
[35:38] in the Realms of Hades they don't they
[35:40] don't come back
[35:42] they don't get a chance to come back
[35:43] there's no passing from that place
[35:50] and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[35:52] to consider my servant job that there is
[35:53] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[35:55] upright man one that feareth God and the
[35:58] skeweth evil how do we know we fear God
[36:00] because he kept continually sacrificing
[36:03] to God
[36:05] and let's let's now I want to encourage
[36:07] you I want to encourage you all the time
[36:09] but let me encourage you you coming to
[36:11] church continually God sees your
[36:12] sacrifice
[36:14] God sees your sacrifice
[36:16] God sees you're not hiding now
[36:19] try to get to this a little later
[36:21] when we come to church we're physically
[36:23] here but we can't hide spiritually
[36:27] in other words while we're here we got
[36:28] to confess our sins and we got to just
[36:31] talk to God about it
[36:32] I think I'll get to that on Wednesday
[36:34] Lord willing by God's grace had a lot of
[36:36] slides for today I felt like today was
[36:38] his
[36:39] it's not some days you know I'm
[36:40] wondering oh Lord
[36:41] what am I going to say what am I going
[36:43] to say but see I felt like I just had a
[36:44] whole bunch it's like a rushing wave
[36:45] come in so we got leftovers for
[36:47] Wednesday my God's grace
[36:50] and then what does the Bible say let us
[36:52] therefore come what afraid to the throne
[36:54] of God but no but boldly
[36:56] of God
[36:58] that we may obtain mercy and find Grace
[37:00] to help in the time of need
[37:02] we can only come boldly if we know our
[37:04] sins are taken care of
[37:06] we can only come boldly if we know we
[37:08] have God's favor in our lives and how do
[37:10] we have God's favor through
[37:11] reconciliation
[37:13] through forgiveness of sin sins through
[37:16] continual sacrifices remember Brothers I
[37:18] don't often feel saved but I've got to
[37:20] trust God's promise that I am saved amen
[37:23] I've got to trust God's promise and if I
[37:25] confess my sins he's faithful and just
[37:27] to cleanse me from all unrighteousness
[37:29] praise God
[37:31] Hallelujah that's what I felt the Holy
[37:33] Spirit was speaking through cam last
[37:34] week
[37:35] that's why preaching on Wednesday move
[37:37] on
[37:38] if we sin confess it and move on
[37:41] and remember again you can come boldly
[37:44] that God forgives your sins quickly he
[37:47] quickly puts away your sins praise God
[37:51] now we never take Grace for granted and
[37:52] make a disgrace
[37:54] but also the same time we can't fall
[37:56] back into guilt and shame and unbelief
[37:59] you can't forget our position in Christ
[38:01] that's what I thought Sunday was a great
[38:03] reminder
[38:05] God is going to give us Grace when we
[38:07] need it the most
[38:09] Hallelujah
[38:11] and their sins and iniquities will I
[38:12] remember no more and where remission of
[38:15] these is there's no more offering for
[38:16] sin
[38:17] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[38:19] enter into the wholeness by the blood of
[38:21] Jesus church when we pray let's pray by
[38:23] the blood of Jesus that's the way into
[38:25] the holiest praise God
[38:27] come by our sacrifice we come clothed in
[38:30] our sacrifice Hallelujah in other words
[38:33] you got to forget what happened
[38:34] yesterday forget what happened last week
[38:36] forget what happened 10 years ago you
[38:38] have to forget that and you got to thank
[38:39] God for what's present what's present is
[38:41] the blood amen
[38:44] Hallelujah
[38:46] by a New and Living Way which he has
[38:48] consecrated for us through the veil that
[38:50] is to say his flesh Jesus's body the the
[38:52] crucifixion of his body made the way
[38:54] that we can go straight to heaven praise
[38:56] God In Prayer to the throne of God
[38:59] and having a high priest over the house
[39:01] of God let us draw near with a true
[39:03] heart now look at that True Heart
[39:05] in full Assurance of Faith having our
[39:07] heart sprinkled from an evil conscience
[39:09] and our bodies wash with pure water
[39:14] so see the church this has to be
[39:15] something very personal
[39:17] when we confess our sins it has to be
[39:20] such a confession that we can come with
[39:22] a true heart and no Lord I'm coming to
[39:25] you in truth
[39:27] I'm not hiding anything I'm coming with
[39:29] everything praise God I'm not hiding
[39:31] anything
[39:34] now the sprinkling represents the
[39:35] anointing you receive after being
[39:37] forgiven that's Peter wrote about that
[39:39] sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
[39:40] that's there's no physical blood it's
[39:42] spiritual it's the Holy Spirit forgiving
[39:45] you after you confess your sins
[39:47] and our bodies wash with pure water of
[39:49] course he's talking about the Waters of
[39:51] the spirit praise God the washing of
[39:53] Water by the word amen
[39:56] so see instead of hiding from God this
[39:58] is what God God wants us to do he wants
[40:01] us to confess our sins and then come to
[40:03] God with a A Heart full of faith
[40:07] remember faith is Trust
[40:10] Hallelujah if I asked each one of you
[40:12] today I come up and say you know uh we
[40:14] just said these prayers do you trust God
[40:15] heard you what would you say
[40:18] I hope you say yes
[40:20] that's trust and that means you have
[40:22] faith in our prayers
[40:24] right you're coming to God with a full
[40:26] Assurance of Faith how do you know why
[40:28] why can you have faith because you
[40:29] confess your sins praise God
[40:32] and we have a faithful high priest who's
[40:34] faithful to forgive us and cleanse us
[40:36] from all unrighteousness
[40:39] amen
[40:40] now here's what I was saying on
[40:42] Wednesday
[40:44] there's so many examples of course of
[40:45] writing I'm sorry hiding or running from
[40:47] God
[40:49] we already looked at Adam and Eve they
[40:51] ran from the presence of the Lord they
[40:52] hid it from the prince of the Lord the
[40:53] Bible said when after Moses killed this
[40:55] Egyptian verse 15 Exodus 2 15 but Moses
[40:59] fled from the face of pharaoh
[41:02] and dwelt in the land of Midian
[41:04] so he knows the government's after him
[41:07] is going to arrest him as a murderer
[41:09] but he also knows his mom told him he's
[41:11] the deliverer
[41:13] he had a special bird he was a prophet
[41:16] he had all this knowledge and uh but in
[41:19] that moment of fear the fear isolated
[41:22] him from God
[41:24] Adam's sexual sin and Disobedience to
[41:26] the will of God isolated him from God
[41:30] so here's a different sin murder fear
[41:34] these sins isolate the people from God
[41:39] so he runs from the face of God
[41:42] I'm not going to ask you raise your
[41:43] hands but has anybody ran from God
[41:45] rather than running to God
[41:50] Hallelujah
[41:54] said now Moses after taking the
[41:56] situation in his own hands so see that's
[41:57] where God that's where he had the
[41:59] trouble
[42:00] he was trying to bring Deliverance by
[42:01] his own human efforts
[42:04] I just
[42:05] beat down one of these guys and then
[42:06] surely they'll see that I'm the
[42:07] deliverer
[42:09] but that was just like Birdman said one
[42:11] stinking dead Egyptian that's all he
[42:13] could accomplish on his own
[42:19] found out that he was a total failure I
[42:22] mean no without God you're a total
[42:23] failure that's my life verse John 15 5 I
[42:26] think he said without me you can do
[42:28] nothing
[42:29] none of us or anything on our own we
[42:31] have nothing we cannot offer God
[42:32] anything
[42:33] except just yielding to him praise God
[42:35] we have no ability of Our Own
[42:38] and brother Adam said Moses ran from
[42:40] both pharaoh and the prince of God look
[42:43] at that he runs from God's people
[42:47] that's the people he's supposed to
[42:49] deliver and he runs from his very
[42:51] responsibility
[42:53] oh but thank God he's a god of Mercy
[42:55] hallelujah thank God he said God has
[42:57] Second Chances even after 40 years amen
[43:01] see Church you might have been running
[43:02] from a problem for a year two years five
[43:05] years 10 15 20 25 30 35 40. let's break
[43:10] out that kindergarten first grade County
[43:13] doesn't matter how long you're running
[43:15] for God's Mercy is sufficient praise God
[43:21] think of the Mind battles on the back of
[43:23] the desert I'm a murderer
[43:25] I'm afraid of the government
[43:27] think of the Mind battles
[43:31] hiding from God and again does Moses go
[43:33] to God or does God go to Moses
[43:37] God didn't make Moses go all the way
[43:38] back to Egypt before he met the burning
[43:40] bush no the burning bush came to him
[43:42] church and if you're sincere and you're
[43:44] looking at it right God's burning bush
[43:46] came to you praise God
[43:48] you didn't go looking for God God came
[43:50] looking for you praise God
[43:52] even after murder
[43:54] even after abandoning God's people and
[43:56] abandoning the teachings of your mother
[43:59] and father
[44:02] hiding from God
[44:04] isolating oneself
[44:06] he was a stranger for 40 years way back
[44:13] I like this but God gave it to him God
[44:15] God was with him and all that praise God
[44:17] God orchestrated his marriage God
[44:19] orchestrated everything about going to
[44:21] Midian the sons his father-in-law God
[44:23] orchestrates every event of Our Lives
[44:25] praise God
[44:28] third was Jonah Jonah 1 verse 3 Jonah
[44:31] rose up to flee unto tarshish from the
[44:33] presence of the Lord and went down to
[44:35] Joppa and he found a ship going to
[44:36] tarshish so he paid the fair thereof and
[44:39] went down into it to go with them unto
[44:42] tarshests from the prince of the Lord he
[44:43] paid money to get out of the will of God
[44:46] Church happens all the time people will
[44:49] overspend on things they shouldn't spend
[44:51] on
[44:52] and then it hurts their financial
[44:53] condition
[44:54] right
[44:56] disobeying the word of God
[44:58] or paying for filthy movies or paying
[45:00] for our Sports tickets
[45:02] they're paying money for something that
[45:04] drives them away for God
[45:07] but thankfully the gospel is without
[45:09] money or Price amen God's never going to
[45:11] take your money God's never going to
[45:12] mistreat you God's always going to bless
[45:14] you praise God when we come to God and
[45:16] recognize
[45:17] that we want to be in his presence we
[45:20] don't want to run from God we want to
[45:21] run to God hallelujah
[45:26] so he runs from the prince of the Lord
[45:29] I listened to sermon yesterday beautiful
[45:31] message
[45:32] it's right before he preached on
[45:34] marriage and divorce and remember where
[45:35] Jonah went God was in the boat now look
[45:37] at this thought
[45:38] Joan is trying to run but brother Adam
[45:40] said God was in that boat the whole time
[45:45] God was in the storm
[45:49] God was even in the fish
[45:51] Hallelujah God was in that fish God
[45:53] prepared that fish and then God was in
[45:55] that fish praise God
[45:57] he went on being
[45:58] he went on being right along with Jonah
[46:01] until his perfect will was done that's
[46:03] right
[46:04] and the church said
[46:06] so when you make a mistake
[46:08] whether it's Financial
[46:10] relational
[46:13] job related
[46:14] whatever you make a mistake we might
[46:16] make even though we're running from
[46:18] God's will we know we know better than
[46:20] it God's still right there with us in
[46:23] the midst of our mistakes
[46:26] so God is that little voice saying you
[46:27] know
[46:28] shouldn't have done this last week and
[46:30] then two weeks later God's God's voice
[46:32] is still saying there his voice is
[46:34] walking to you praise God
[46:36] it's walking to you
[46:38] you should not have done that you should
[46:39] come back
[46:41] you know you need to confess this and
[46:42] make this right
[46:45] God is in all those emails you check
[46:47] maybe there's the email says oh you
[46:48] should have done this you should have
[46:49] done that too
[46:51] maybe you see a sign out there on the
[46:52] street that's God God it's God with you
[46:54] trying to show you that was wrong
[46:56] I know God speaks through Austin through
[46:57] different things like that side
[47:00] God's with us the whole time
[47:02] even though we feel separated from God
[47:04] which is true one way we breed him in
[47:06] our human Spirits like we don't have the
[47:07] anointing on our minds but yet God never
[47:09] leaves us that's amazing love that's the
[47:11] kind of God I want to serve praise God
[47:15] but in this summer brother man was
[47:17] preaching mostly on those who made
[47:18] mistakes with marriage and divorce
[47:21] and he said even even in mistakes like
[47:22] that God is still with us and then look
[47:25] what happened in marriage and divorce
[47:28] wrote around gives them he said he said
[47:30] the same holy spirit that met Moses and
[47:32] and talked through Jesus the Same holy
[47:33] spirit gives me permission he said stay
[47:35] married as you are but don't you ever do
[47:38] that again
[47:40] program brother man could have had the
[47:42] right by the word to separate all those
[47:43] marriages
[47:45] you could have the right to do that
[47:47] but God's grace gave him Grace to say
[47:49] stay as you are
[47:51] it's too late to break these things up
[47:53] because God don't want his children left
[47:54] you don't want the little children left
[47:55] without parents
[47:58] now were they going adulterers go in the
[48:01] Rapture I don't know about that brother
[48:02] said brother man said I hope so
[48:05] the ram said LeBron said there might be
[48:07] a way for you getting in
[48:09] now that's that's a that's great so if I
[48:11] ever heard it by God's grace
[48:15] see
[48:17] and if he's ever after you how many
[48:18] knows he's after you
[48:20] the Bible said if I love you I will
[48:22] chasten you and rebuke you in other
[48:23] words if I love you I'm chasing you down
[48:25] until you get this right praise God
[48:29] you might Dodge over here and Dodge over
[48:31] there can I just
[48:33] let's say brother Cameron's preaching
[48:35] let's say brother Cameron was preaching
[48:36] it and it was preaching right to your
[48:38] situation last week
[48:39] and church you know spiritually this is
[48:41] what we do we hide behind I'm not gonna
[48:43] listen about the camp
[48:45] he's not going to preach on me
[48:47] we might Dodge the sermons for a week
[48:50] but let's not let's let's not let it go
[48:52] two weeks or three weeks
[48:53] that's not to go two months
[48:55] let's not let it go
[49:00] this is our flesh our flesh wants to
[49:02] hide from God but God's grace is with us
[49:04] in every trial praise God
[49:08] and church we're going to be miserable
[49:09] until we come back and do the thing you
[49:12] started out for him to do at the first
[49:15] place
[49:17] praise God
[49:20] that's why I told my dad I said the way
[49:22] back
[49:23] if you left God through cigarettes and
[49:25] then you left God by not reading your
[49:27] Bible praying I said then that's exactly
[49:28] the way to go back get rid of your
[49:30] cigarettes and go back to read your
[49:31] Bible and pray in the closet then you'll
[49:33] be blessed that's the way back
[49:35] that's what happened to Abraham Abraham
[49:37] left the promised land because of a
[49:39] famine now look at that church he let
[49:41] his he let the father of Faith grow go
[49:43] through a famine
[49:46] I thought God loved Abraham he did
[49:49] so church when money gets a little tight
[49:51] on us or we don't have food or we don't
[49:52] have all the things that we need we
[49:53] don't have the nicest things in life
[49:54] does that mean God doesn't love us no he
[49:57] even let the father of Faith go through
[49:58] a family what about Ruth and Naomi
[50:01] they wouldn't even had Ruth unless that
[50:03] was for Naomi so the famine Naomi had to
[50:05] go through
[50:06] right
[50:08] that's why I was I was talking to Nia
[50:10] yesterday and we were talking about
[50:11] things I said brother I said Nia listen
[50:13] here I got the I got that buy right
[50:14] there I said brother I said let's read
[50:16] Romans chapter eight I took him to the
[50:18] place where I said where the Bible says
[50:20] nothing shall separate us from the love
[50:22] of God
[50:24] shall persecution shall tribulation
[50:27] separate you from the love of God
[50:29] is sword or I said like this is a AR-15
[50:32] going to separates from the love of God
[50:34] and in that text it says famine famine
[50:37] cannot separate you from the will of God
[50:40] hallelujah from the love of God
[50:42] a starving person God will let Star his
[50:46] children starve naturally but not
[50:48] spiritually praise God
[50:50] if you let Abraham famine condition
[50:52] Naomi famine condition Paul said he was
[50:55] in hunger often
[50:59] church if we're going through difficult
[51:00] times let's not let's not be mad at god
[51:02] let's trust God God's doing something
[51:04] praise God
[51:06] he's building my faith he's giving me
[51:08] Grace he's with me in this I'm not going
[51:10] to run away from God I'm going to run to
[51:12] God hallelujah
[51:16] that's a good sign you are a child of
[51:17] God
[51:19] when you go through difficult times
[51:24] but this is what we got to be honest
[51:25] with are we feeling miserable
[51:27] spiritually are we feeling good
[51:28] spiritually
[51:30] don't don't go don't run from the
[51:32] presence of God face up to it you
[51:34] believe it's the truth if it's the truth
[51:35] it's worth living for dying for anything
[51:38] else
[51:40] and if he's ever Vindicated it to you
[51:43] that is the truth then we can't run from
[51:45] in nowhere he'll be right there just the
[51:46] same you can't do it I love that he'll
[51:48] be right there let's all say he'll be
[51:49] right there ready he'll be right there
[51:51] Jesus is going to be right there with
[51:53] you praise God ah thank God Amen if you
[51:57] run from Jesus he's right there with you
[51:58] if you run two to the Friends of God
[52:00] he's right there with you he's with you
[52:02] all the time he's going to make sure you
[52:04] make it praise God
[52:06] nothing can separate you from the love
[52:08] of God hallelujah
[52:12] let's read it while we got it so Romans
[52:14] 8.
[52:24] so everybody can thank brother cam for
[52:26] this message this morning
[52:28] you kind of preached the motivation for
[52:30] it Hallelujah
[52:38] Romans chapter 8. so I took brother Nia
[52:40] yesterday
[52:42] that's why I put him to verse 35 who
[52:44] shall separate us from the love of
[52:45] Christ
[52:46] I said shall tribulation or distress or
[52:48] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[52:51] Peril or sword this means God has to let
[52:54] his children go to the sword
[52:57] God has to let his children go through
[52:58] perils
[53:02] nakedness they lacking clothes
[53:05] famine lacking food persecution
[53:09] distress tribulation
[53:12] why because we're sheep as verse 36 and
[53:14] 37 says look at verse 37 though nay no
[53:17] in all these things we are more than
[53:19] conquerors through him that loved us in
[53:20] other words God wants you to conquer
[53:24] famines with his love
[53:27] you can conquer a famine with God's love
[53:31] you can conquer persecution with the
[53:33] love of God hallelujah
[53:36] oh it's beautiful
[53:37] for I'm persuade in verse 38 that
[53:39] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[53:40] principalities nor powers nor things
[53:42] present nor things to come see don't
[53:44] worry about your future
[53:45] because anything in your future cannot
[53:48] separate you from God's love Hallelujah
[53:52] nor height nor depth nor any other
[53:54] creature shall be able to separate us
[53:55] from the love of God which is in Christ
[53:57] Jesus our lord and the church said
[53:59] go to Philippians chapter 1 verse six
[54:01] let's nail down some of these
[54:02] encouraging scriptures again
[54:07] not even famine concept
[54:10] Abraham from God's love
[54:14] remember Beatrice's testimonies they had
[54:17] to pray for food many nights
[54:19] did that did that do the trouble about
[54:21] uh having food or not or school fees did
[54:24] that ever separate her from God's love
[54:27] but in those moments God's love was
[54:29] manifested
[54:31] as they prayed as they cried out to God
[54:33] God's love was manifested Ephesians 1 6
[54:35] Lydia I know you got it honey
[54:45] who started your salvation
[54:47] did you start it or did God start it
[54:49] God God came looking for you so if God
[54:52] started it God's going to be there the
[54:54] whole time and then he's going to finish
[54:55] it praise God
[54:57] and the Bible said be confident
[55:00] in other words let's not doubt that God
[55:02] is the author of my life
[55:05] let's not struggle with this well am I
[55:07] is God really a part of this or not God
[55:09] is a part of this praise God
[55:12] God's the author about it he's the
[55:14] author and finisher of my faith I'm
[55:16] confident he started this I'm confident
[55:18] he's with me right now he's with me now
[55:21] he's with me in the future and nothing
[55:22] can separate me from his love praise God
[55:28] but if we're miserable church then we
[55:29] got to find something to take care of
[55:31] that misery that's confession
[55:37] this is a beautiful chapter
[55:39] I don't have time I said if time permits
[55:41] to read all 18 verses I can't do that
[55:44] but David knew the same just like
[55:46] brother Rams said God was with Jonah in
[55:48] the fish God was with Jonah in the boat
[55:52] David said if I Ascend up into heaven
[55:54] Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell
[55:57] behold Thou Art there
[56:00] Hallelujah
[56:02] see we isolate ourselves but yet I'll
[56:04] say like this even in our isolation God
[56:05] is with us
[56:07] because we isolate ourselves in our
[56:09] minds
[56:13] and then David a man for God's Own Heart
[56:17] he does adultery and then murder
[56:20] and then Nathan comes to him and says
[56:22] here no what'd he do he hid himself from
[56:23] God
[56:24] see how all these people hide themselves
[56:26] from God
[56:28] and this ain't just a common believer
[56:30] this is a man after God's Own Heart
[56:33] a message believer after God's Own Heart
[56:36] sometimes can hide themselves from God
[56:41] and Nathan said you did this secretly
[56:44] I will do this thing before all Israel
[56:46] and before the sun and of course we know
[56:48] that happened with his son Absalom
[56:50] and David said unto Nathan I have sinned
[56:52] against the Lord so Steve now now
[56:54] David's get on the right Road praise God
[56:56] now instead of hiding from God now he's
[56:58] coming to God but look God had to send
[57:00] the prophet to him in order to bring him
[57:03] to correction praise God again God chose
[57:06] His mercy God went to Adam and Eve God
[57:08] took the burning bush to Moses and God
[57:10] brings the prophet to David hallelujah
[57:12] oh he's he's so rich in Mercy praise God
[57:16] he said I've sinned against the Lord and
[57:17] Nathan son of David the Lord also hath
[57:19] put away thy sin Thou shalt not die
[57:22] isn't that amazing David does two of the
[57:25] most awful sins you could do
[57:27] and as soon as he says I've sinned now
[57:29] look at this as soon as you say church
[57:30] I'm sorry Lord it was my fault God puts
[57:33] it away from him
[57:35] God's just waiting for us to say those
[57:37] words I have sinned
[57:41] and remember under Old Testament law he
[57:43] would have he and Bathsheba should have
[57:45] been stoned
[57:46] for adultery
[57:49] and God said I'm gonna because you said
[57:51] that I'm putting it away now you're
[57:52] going to pay for all the consequences
[57:54] but you're not going to die
[57:56] because I put it away from me I put it
[57:59] out of my sight because I'm looking at
[58:00] the sacrifice praise
[58:03] God hallelujah
[58:05] in other words when we sin God is
[58:07] looking at the sacrifice of Jesus to
[58:09] forgive our sins
[58:13] Hallelujah
[58:16] and of course there's other consequences
[58:18] he lost that that David Bathsheba lost
[58:20] their first son
[58:22] brother cam was mentioning Peter a lot a
[58:24] man again not not just a common man a
[58:27] man with the keys to the kingdom
[58:30] on the night of his arrest Jesus said
[58:32] all ye shall be offended because of me
[58:34] this night for his written I will Smite
[58:36] the shepherd and the sheep of the flock
[58:37] shall be scattered abroad Peter twice
[58:40] tells Jesus no
[58:41] not once twice
[58:44] though all men should be offended
[58:45] because of thee yet I will never be
[58:47] offended I'll never be offended this
[58:49] message
[58:50] I'll stand on it I always I'll always
[58:52] follow you I'll die for this message you
[58:54] better be careful what you're saying
[58:56] and God's going to test that too
[59:00] I never struggle I've got all the faith
[59:02] in the world you better watch God's
[59:04] gonna show you don't have all faith
[59:06] you've got all Faith you be Jesus
[59:10] all Faith wouldn't make that kind of a
[59:12] statement that kind of a prideful
[59:13] statement
[59:16] yet I will never be offended
[59:19] he got offended real soon
[59:21] Jesus said unto him barely I said to you
[59:23] that this night before the Crow
[59:25] Thou shalt deny me Thrice Peter said to
[59:27] him though I shall though I shall he
[59:29] doubles down on it though I should die
[59:32] with thee yet I will not deny thee
[59:35] church we I hear people say it all the
[59:37] time sermons I would die for this
[59:38] message I die for Jesus let's wait till
[59:40] it comes and then we'll see
[59:42] because anybody can say that
[59:46] wait to come down and look at job's
[59:48] example
[59:49] the hardest trial was his own physical
[59:51] health
[59:54] because remember the first trial was he
[59:56] lost all of his money and his children
[59:59] and then God saying goes back to God and
[1:00:01] said well you you know mano
[1:00:03] a man he'll make it as long as he's got
[1:00:06] his health he said let me touch his body
[1:00:07] and then he'll curse you and God said go
[1:00:09] ahead
[1:00:13] but that's what's the hardest battle you
[1:00:14] can fight many times a battle of your
[1:00:16] health
[1:00:18] your health
[1:00:20] when it's just you and God
[1:00:22] nobody can help you nobody can help job
[1:00:24] get better it was just him and God
[1:00:31] share some of our hardest battles but
[1:00:33] time goes on I mean you see in other
[1:00:34] churches other churches we have people
[1:00:35] that you know they we hear about them
[1:00:37] they die cancer or they're battling
[1:00:38] cancer
[1:00:39] if time goes on there's some of us are
[1:00:41] gonna have some battles I imagine
[1:00:44] I'm not prophesying anything evil I'm
[1:00:46] just
[1:00:46] I'm just looking at facts
[1:00:48] probability
[1:00:49] now I hope everybody has perfect health
[1:00:51] the rest of our life
[1:00:53] that'd be wonderful
[1:00:57] but let's be careful what we boast about
[1:01:01] Paul said I'm not going to boast in
[1:01:02] anything except the Cross of Christ amen
[1:01:05] he said I'm boasting nothing saving the
[1:01:07] Cross of Christ my Lord amen
[1:01:11] Peter's boast and said I got the keys
[1:01:13] guys I'll never you can never offend me
[1:01:15] I've got faith I'll die for this message
[1:01:18] and then when I come push come to shove
[1:01:19] he didn't die for the message right
[1:01:21] there later on he did
[1:01:23] but not right there
[1:01:27] in that same hour said Jesus now the
[1:01:29] multitude surrounding him Peter's
[1:01:30] already cut off the malchus's ear
[1:01:32] servant's ear Jesus put the ear back on
[1:01:35] and Jesus says are you come out as
[1:01:37] against a thief with swords and saves
[1:01:38] for to take me I sat daily with you
[1:01:40] teaching in the temple and ye laid no
[1:01:42] hold on me but all this was done that
[1:01:44] the scriptures the prophets might be
[1:01:46] fulfilled then all the disciples forsook
[1:01:48] him and fled so just a few hours later
[1:01:50] Peter runs Peter hides from Jesus yet
[1:01:54] he'd said all along I'm going to stand
[1:01:56] with you I'm just I'm faithful I've got
[1:01:58] all the faith in the world
[1:02:00] wait till your health and freedom come
[1:02:02] into question
[1:02:07] the church in America we have health we
[1:02:09] have freedom we have all these great
[1:02:11] things
[1:02:13] but I hope you understand the greatest
[1:02:15] tests are the ones where they just like
[1:02:17] job you lose your family
[1:02:19] you lose your health you lose all your
[1:02:21] money
[1:02:23] and in those moments will you say
[1:02:25] what job said
[1:02:28] blessed to be the name of the Lord
[1:02:30] he gives and takes away
[1:02:33] praise God
[1:02:38] so Pete not just Peter all the disciples
[1:02:41] hide from Jesus
[1:02:43] why was it wasn't it to show that we
[1:02:45] would all run from Christ so we all need
[1:02:47] forgiveness
[1:02:50] all of us do
[1:02:52] so sexual sin isolated Adam fear
[1:02:55] isolated Moses sexual sin and murder
[1:02:57] isolated David Jonah's anger because
[1:03:00] remember Jonah was angry about his Gore
[1:03:03] and God was saying that's the anger you
[1:03:05] have against Nineveh
[1:03:07] anger will isolate someone from God
[1:03:11] you'll run you'll pay money to get out
[1:03:13] of God's presence
[1:03:14] you'll do anything to get out of God's
[1:03:15] presence
[1:03:16] and God's saying don't run from me come
[1:03:18] to me
[1:03:19] the whole time and that's your lead and
[1:03:21] as you're going as we run from God's
[1:03:23] presence some of us when we run from
[1:03:24] God's presence God's with us whole time
[1:03:26] saying come back come back come back you
[1:03:28] can come back there's there's Grace
[1:03:29] there's Mercy
[1:03:36] and of course Church all of our sin
[1:03:38] isolates us from God
[1:03:40] all of our sin
[1:03:44] this is a beautiful chapter
[1:03:47] was this a Psalm of David was this
[1:03:51] I forgot to check on that
[1:03:53] psalm 32.
[1:03:59] yes the psalm of David praise God oh and
[1:04:01] this is connected to David Bathsheba
[1:04:03] now this in church I acknowledge my sin
[1:04:05] unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid
[1:04:10] we have we have to be completely honest
[1:04:13] with God
[1:04:15] we cannot hide anything from God
[1:04:18] I will confess my transgressions unto
[1:04:20] the Lord and thou forgave us the
[1:04:21] iniquity of my sin
[1:04:24] for this shall every one that is Godly
[1:04:27] how many godly people we got here today
[1:04:29] this is how everyone that's Godly pray
[1:04:32] unto thee in a time when thou mayest be
[1:04:34] found
[1:04:35] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[1:04:37] they shall not come nigh unto him
[1:04:41] and look at here see instead of hiding
[1:04:43] our in our sins the Bible says Thou Art
[1:04:45] my Hiding Place
[1:04:49] Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou
[1:04:51] shalt Compass me about with songs of
[1:04:54] Deliverance Salah
[1:04:58] so we don't hide away in our sins
[1:05:01] we don't let our sins cause us to
[1:05:03] separate ourselves from others
[1:05:06] but we're to go to Christ and find a
[1:05:08] hiding place in Jesus's love
[1:05:11] praise God and this is what everyone
[1:05:13] does
[1:05:15] that is Godly
[1:05:18] Hallelujah
[1:05:23] many Sorrows shall be to the wicked but
[1:05:26] he that trusteth in the Lord Mercy shall
[1:05:29] Compass him about
[1:05:31] me thank God for your guardian angel
[1:05:34] praise God
[1:05:36] the Hedge how many thank you Over the
[1:05:37] Hedge about you praise God
[1:05:39] see Mercy compasses you about
[1:05:43] and this is how the chapter ends and
[1:05:45] church maybe I'll look at this on
[1:05:46] Wednesday but I want to go through some
[1:05:47] of the Psalms of David and David makes
[1:05:49] all these complaints to God
[1:05:51] but in almost every situation he ends it
[1:05:54] by giving God praise
[1:05:58] so I look at that when we when we are
[1:06:00] isolated or when we isolate ourselves
[1:06:03] just tell God all the honest truth
[1:06:06] tell God what you feel
[1:06:07] of course say it with respect
[1:06:12] don't make vows you can't keep
[1:06:15] but God's not afraid of what you're
[1:06:16] going through
[1:06:18] that's why the that's why the book of
[1:06:19] Psalms was given to us
[1:06:21] so that we in our trials could see this
[1:06:23] is what David faced this is the trial he
[1:06:26] faced
[1:06:28] way harder than what I go through
[1:06:32] when was the last time you had a bounty
[1:06:34] hunter who was the president United
[1:06:36] States hunting you down
[1:06:40] right has FBI ever knocked down your
[1:06:42] door to hunt you down and kill you
[1:06:49] so they the these expressions of crying
[1:06:51] out to God God where are you Lord
[1:06:54] I need you
[1:06:56] they always end with but I will be glad
[1:06:58] in the Lord and rejoice
[1:07:01] he says ye righteous shout for Joy all
[1:07:04] ye that are upright in heart
[1:07:06] Hallelujah
[1:07:09] so brother Ram ends this sermon a man
[1:07:11] running from the presence of God if you
[1:07:12] haven't listened to it lately he ends
[1:07:13] the sermon by saying we must face up to
[1:07:15] our responsibilities especially when it
[1:07:17] comes to sins
[1:07:21] but even as I said ministers they'll
[1:07:23] come face to face with truth and then
[1:07:24] walk away from us see there seems like
[1:07:27] there is something sometimes that they
[1:07:29] don't want to face up to him many times
[1:07:31] have people come and say I know that's
[1:07:32] right brother Brandon but if I did that
[1:07:33] they'd kick me out of your church what
[1:07:35] of it if you don't they're going to kick
[1:07:38] you out up there they're going to kick
[1:07:39] you out of heaven
[1:07:41] you're gonna get kicked out somewhere
[1:07:42] praise God
[1:07:43] might as well get kicked out here right
[1:07:45] from denominations come to the truth and
[1:07:48] then they'll accept you in heaven praise
[1:07:49] God
[1:07:52] so you got to be kicked out somewhere so
[1:07:54] you might as well face up to it instead
[1:07:55] of running from it say well I'll go over
[1:07:57] here I won't go back go back sure listen
[1:07:59] to some more of it
[1:08:00] search the scriptures Jesus said search
[1:08:02] the scriptures for in them you think you
[1:08:04] have eternal life and they are they that
[1:08:06] testify of me but we find that people
[1:08:07] won't face up with that being brought
[1:08:10] into the presence of God and see when
[1:08:12] God made a promise God is obligated to
[1:08:14] that promise and when he brings that
[1:08:15] promise to pass then people are afraid
[1:08:17] to face up the responsibility of coping
[1:08:20] with the message of the hour we find
[1:08:21] that everywhere
[1:08:23] church that's why there's so many Cults
[1:08:25] and evil things around the message
[1:08:26] because message breachers they've heard
[1:08:29] the word and they haven't preached it
[1:08:31] they haven't faced up to it
[1:08:33] right and then they've made false
[1:08:34] doctrines
[1:08:36] right and then once they make one false
[1:08:38] Doctrine it spreads to another false
[1:08:40] Doctrine
[1:08:41] and pretty soon sin is allowed sins
[1:08:43] allowed us to go on
[1:08:45] think about that the Corinthian Church
[1:08:47] had a man that was sleeping with his
[1:08:49] stepmom and nobody mourned over it
[1:08:52] see church that's what we need if we
[1:08:53] know there's sin in the church we've got
[1:08:55] to mourn over it
[1:08:57] praise God
[1:09:00] and that was what we would call a book
[1:09:01] of Acts church or that would be one of
[1:09:03] those original churches Paul started
[1:09:07] see
[1:09:08] it's a responsibility if we know the
[1:09:10] word we got to keep the word
[1:09:13] Hallelujah
[1:09:14] we can't run from it we got to keep the
[1:09:16] word of God
[1:09:21] and then and when you see this in this
[1:09:23] day now when the word of God has made
[1:09:24] these promises of things that we see
[1:09:26] happening now then we've got the
[1:09:27] responsibility to either face up to it
[1:09:29] or get away from it you can't just stay
[1:09:30] neutral you've got to do something about
[1:09:32] it some move has got to be made you
[1:09:34] can't come in that church door and go
[1:09:35] out the same person you come in
[1:09:38] you're either further away or closer to
[1:09:40] God every time you come in and go out
[1:09:42] there oh see how easy it is look it's
[1:09:45] not hard for people to shirk the
[1:09:46] responsibility it's easy
[1:09:49] it's easy not to do what's right
[1:09:53] it's hard to do what's right
[1:09:56] because it goes against your flesh goes
[1:09:58] against your mind your thinking
[1:10:04] now let me just use an example for last
[1:10:05] Sunday we heard the energized word now
[1:10:08] I'm not going to ask for hands but which
[1:10:09] of us this week said I'm going to take
[1:10:11] that word and I'm gonna let that word
[1:10:12] energize a part of my life I hope I hope
[1:10:14] all the hands will go up
[1:10:17] but if we didn't look what happened we
[1:10:19] just heard the word and it wasn't mixed
[1:10:21] with faith
[1:10:26] that's why with each service with each
[1:10:28] day with each time We Gather we got to
[1:10:30] take something away from that and apply
[1:10:32] it directly to our lives
[1:10:37] what does James 1 say we can't just be
[1:10:39] hearers only we got to be doers of the
[1:10:41] word of God
[1:10:43] Hallelujah
[1:10:46] by God's grace hold on to one thing
[1:10:48] do that right
[1:10:50] and do it tomorrow
[1:10:52] praise God
[1:10:55] it's easy to just come to church and go
[1:10:58] through the motions it's hard
[1:11:00] to let God energize your faith every
[1:11:02] single day
[1:11:04] praise God
[1:11:06] Hallelujah
[1:11:09] I was just went through those five
[1:11:11] examples to bring you I want to go
[1:11:12] through those bad examples to bring you
[1:11:15] to the example who never failed
[1:11:18] Jesus never hid from God
[1:11:22] brother Brandon said he faced up and he
[1:11:24] took the right path
[1:11:28] Jesus stood there what man would be poor
[1:11:30] didn't have a place to lay his head that
[1:11:33] even knowed where a fish swallowed a
[1:11:34] coin who what man could take them big
[1:11:36] jugs of water turn them into wine and
[1:11:38] not have a place to lay his head look at
[1:11:39] that didn't even have
[1:11:42] enough he had to face up the
[1:11:43] responsibilities that had been given
[1:11:44] into his hand what man that could Raise
[1:11:46] A Man Out of a grave after he had been
[1:11:48] dead four days of rotten he could not
[1:11:50] could he not have saved himself sure he
[1:11:52] could but if he did he'd not say he
[1:11:54] would not have saved us he had to face
[1:11:57] up to the responsibilities and because
[1:11:58] of his Disobedience to the word
[1:12:01] I'm sorry because of his obedience to
[1:12:02] the word sorry
[1:12:04] where is Adam's Disobedience and he had
[1:12:07] took the shortcut So Adam took the
[1:12:08] shortcut the way down to tarshus but
[1:12:11] Jesus Took the straightway to Nineveh to
[1:12:13] the Gentiles to get himself abroad
[1:12:15] that's a beautiful type wow Damon see
[1:12:17] that's right now Hallelujah I'm glad he
[1:12:19] did it tonight and we ought to face up
[1:12:21] to the facts that we belong to him and
[1:12:23] take the world away praise God and the
[1:12:25] church said
[1:12:28] Don't Take The Wrong route away from
[1:12:30] obeying the word of God obey the word of
[1:12:33] God that's the route we need to take
[1:12:34] praise God
[1:12:35] the way of disobedience is always going
[1:12:38] to be harder
[1:12:39] it's always going to have more suffering
[1:12:42] so he's going to have more trouble in it
[1:12:45] the way of obedience is the right way
[1:12:48] praise God it's the ship to Nineveh can
[1:12:51] we say it
[1:12:53] like obedience is taking the first shift
[1:12:55] to Nineveh praise God
[1:12:58] obedience is hearing taking the first
[1:13:00] sermon or the first time you read that
[1:13:02] in your Bible and obeying that the first
[1:13:04] time that's taking the shift in Innova
[1:13:06] praise God
[1:13:09] Hallelujah this is what cam mentioned
[1:13:11] Kim
[1:13:12] mention Elisha had to keep his eyes on
[1:13:15] Elijah for the double portion
[1:13:18] Jesus had to keep his eyes on Calvary
[1:13:21] to pour out the portion of his holy
[1:13:22] ghost on the day of Pentecost
[1:13:24] the Bible said when it was time
[1:13:27] the time had come
[1:13:30] he set his face steadfastly to go to
[1:13:32] Jerusalem
[1:13:33] that's what we need to do today we need
[1:13:35] to see what is what time is it right now
[1:13:37] what does God want me to do in my life
[1:13:39] right now what time is it and help me to
[1:13:41] find out help me to know that and then
[1:13:43] help me to obey God's word in this time
[1:13:45] of my life
[1:13:46] it came time to go to the Cross so he
[1:13:48] set his face there nothing could stop
[1:13:49] him
[1:13:53] is it time that we obey something is it
[1:13:55] a time that we make something right
[1:13:58] it's a time that we finally do what
[1:14:00] God's called us to do
[1:14:02] praise God
[1:14:07] it's when Jesus was faced with this
[1:14:10] crucifixion the night of his arrest what
[1:14:12] do you do instead of running from God
[1:14:14] instead of running out in the wilderness
[1:14:16] he went to Gethsemane it means the oil
[1:14:18] press
[1:14:20] so he was going to go through all the
[1:14:21] pressure prayer the power of prayer was
[1:14:24] going to bring out the will of God in
[1:14:25] his life
[1:14:27] prayer going to God In Prayer is going
[1:14:29] to allow the perfect will of God to be
[1:14:30] done in your life
[1:14:32] going to God In Prayer
[1:14:34] Hallelujah
[1:14:36] he says sit ye here while I go Yonder
[1:14:38] and pray
[1:14:40] he took with him Peter and the two sons
[1:14:42] of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and
[1:14:44] very heavy then he said unto them my
[1:14:45] soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto
[1:14:47] death Terry ye here and watch with me
[1:14:53] and he said to his disciples weary
[1:14:55] they've had lots of big meetings was
[1:14:56] tired perhaps like you this you know
[1:14:58] this morning you don't raise your hand
[1:14:59] but anybody tired this morning
[1:15:02] long work week
[1:15:05] he was tired
[1:15:07] perhaps like you are this morning
[1:15:09] but he said will you just watch with me
[1:15:11] an hour
[1:15:12] where I've got to go Yonder and have a
[1:15:15] conference I have to go alone
[1:15:17] and then the conference was set and the
[1:15:19] lamb young a beautiful life never a life
[1:15:21] like that never was never will be a life
[1:15:24] like that the lamb had but the father
[1:15:27] said to Jesus in Gethsemane are you
[1:15:29] willing
[1:15:30] is your love for your brethren great
[1:15:32] enough
[1:15:33] is your love for that sinful stinking
[1:15:36] world that you were born in do you love
[1:15:38] them enough to forfeit your life
[1:15:42] do you love them enough to take their
[1:15:43] place to Bear their sins to the hardest
[1:15:46] crucial death
[1:15:49] he said there could be nothing die that
[1:15:50] could that kind of death but him in that
[1:15:53] conference such a decision was made
[1:15:55] until blood dropped from his brow he was
[1:15:57] under a strain the sins of the world was
[1:15:59] upon him and he looked into the face of
[1:16:01] the dove and said not my will but thy
[1:16:04] will be done
[1:16:06] look at that he said his face towards
[1:16:08] seeking God
[1:16:09] he could have ran from it Hallelujah but
[1:16:12] he didn't run from it praise God church
[1:16:14] we all run from it at times
[1:16:17] but when we feel the beckoning of the
[1:16:19] Holy Spirit we got to face up to what
[1:16:21] God's calling us to do
[1:16:23] and it's got a it's got to line up with
[1:16:25] this word right here and the church said
[1:16:27] if God's calling you to do something
[1:16:29] it'll be right here in this word praise
[1:16:30] God
[1:16:31] it won't be outside in this word
[1:16:33] it'll be right here in the word of God
[1:16:36] 's asking us to face up to it
[1:16:39] and look and look the word of God in the
[1:16:41] face and say Yes Lord I'll do your will
[1:16:43] not my will
[1:16:47] that's taking the ship to Nineveh praise
[1:16:49] God
[1:16:53] he said oh can we have that decision in
[1:16:55] your hearts this morning can you forfeit
[1:16:57] that little filthy life of yours
[1:17:00] what can I say a little filthy habit
[1:17:04] are you willing to look into his face
[1:17:06] and say not my will I'm a druckard but
[1:17:09] I'll drink no more I'm a gambler but
[1:17:11] I'll gamble no more I'm gonna have in
[1:17:13] there
[1:17:13] I'm immoral but I'll be that way no more
[1:17:16] I'm a liar but I'll stop it today
[1:17:19] I'm a foul person
[1:17:22] but in this conference in this service
[1:17:24] this morning I look into Jesus face and
[1:17:26] take my master who died for me to make
[1:17:29] my way clear
[1:17:31] not my will
[1:17:33] but your will
[1:17:35] if it cost me my home it would cost me
[1:17:37] my husband my wife my father my mother
[1:17:39] my fellowship my church membership
[1:17:40] whatever it costs me in this conference
[1:17:42] this morning I say I want your Holy
[1:17:44] Spirit to live in me praise God
[1:17:48] I've heard about it I want you and me
[1:17:49] not mine yours that's my decision
[1:17:53] God has called a place not upon some
[1:17:56] high Pinnacle place but a humble little
[1:17:58] Tabernacle about to Fallen we're having
[1:18:01] a conference
[1:18:02] how many know we're having a conference
[1:18:04] this morning praise God
[1:18:06] Hallelujah
[1:18:09] he wants to meet each one of us
[1:18:11] and again just reiterating the scripture
[1:18:13] how does he want us to come he wants us
[1:18:15] to draw near to God he doesn't God
[1:18:17] doesn't want us to run he doesn't want
[1:18:19] us to hide he wants us to come near to
[1:18:21] him
[1:18:23] having a True Heart
[1:18:25] full Assurance of faith
[1:18:27] having our heart sprinkled from an evil
[1:18:29] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:18:31] pure water
[1:18:36] Hallelujah
[1:18:42] I'm going to skip past that
[1:18:47] yeah I was been listening to The Sixth
[1:18:48] Seal this week as well a little bit off
[1:18:50] and on the church there's gonna be
[1:18:52] nobody that can hide from Jesus
[1:18:55] think about it millionaires billionaires
[1:18:57] trillionaires I don't know if there's
[1:18:58] such a thing as true in there
[1:19:01] they're spending their whole life now
[1:19:02] running from Christ
[1:19:05] Ronnie
[1:19:07] the word of God says this
[1:19:12] and we have the opportunity we're the
[1:19:14] we're the Blessed ones to hear the word
[1:19:16] of God
[1:19:16] Hallelujah hear the message of the hour
[1:19:18] the revelations restored the church back
[1:19:21] to its rightful place
[1:19:23] and sometimes we struggle with hiding
[1:19:25] from God
[1:19:30] and sermons like this are to encourage
[1:19:32] us and to teach us to teach us to come
[1:19:34] to God every time
[1:19:36] not hide from God
[1:19:38] not not try to just put it off for
[1:19:40] another week or put it off or just try
[1:19:41] to forget about it whatever we may be
[1:19:44] battling we got to come to God we got to
[1:19:46] face up to what responsibility God's
[1:19:49] given to us
[1:19:51] no one can hide from Jesus
[1:19:53] under the Sixth Seal the kings are there
[1:19:55] so let's just name some Kings
[1:19:58] what's the Saudi characters
[1:20:00] nobody remember him what's the North
[1:20:02] Korea Kim Kim Jong-un what's the North
[1:20:04] Korea guy
[1:20:10] Vladimir Putin let's put some names in
[1:20:12] there
[1:20:13] Joe Biden
[1:20:14] the kings of the Earth the Great Men the
[1:20:16] rich man Elon Musk will put them in
[1:20:17] there Bill Gates Chief captains if it
[1:20:19] happens in our day all the Mighty Men
[1:20:21] every slave every free man hid
[1:20:24] themselves in the Rock in the dens in
[1:20:26] the rocks of the mountains
[1:20:28] now I hear about it on on I hear about
[1:20:30] it from people that you know rich people
[1:20:32] are actually building themselves bunkers
[1:20:33] underground I don't know if that's true
[1:20:34] but look what the Bible says the Bible
[1:20:36] says they'll want to do it
[1:20:39] they will spend hours and and years
[1:20:42] digging holes in the rocks to try to get
[1:20:44] away from Jesus why don't they just come
[1:20:45] to Jesus
[1:20:47] but they want to enjoy their their sins
[1:20:52] they'll do everything they can to hide
[1:20:54] from the face of Jesus and yet Jesus
[1:20:57] Jesus invites everyone to him
[1:21:02] and they actually say to the mountains
[1:21:03] and rocks they're actually crying out to
[1:21:05] Nature fall on us
[1:21:07] let me be buried in rocks let me be
[1:21:09] buried under mountains so I don't have
[1:21:11] to look in Jesus face
[1:21:13] they're asking to be buried alive so
[1:21:15] they don't have to look in this word and
[1:21:17] say you know what this is right and I'm
[1:21:18] wrong
[1:21:20] this is right I'm the one who sinned
[1:21:22] against this I've got I want to be right
[1:21:24] I want to do what this says
[1:21:26] they will say mountains and they'll say
[1:21:27] walls follow me let this whole building
[1:21:29] follow me so I don't have to face this
[1:21:31] but Church we've got to face it praise
[1:21:33] God
[1:21:34] we've got to face the word of God and do
[1:21:36] what the word of God says
[1:21:40] fall on us hide us from the face of him
[1:21:42] that sitteth on the throne and from the
[1:21:44] Wrath of the Lamb
[1:21:46] the six seal proves nobody can hide from
[1:21:48] Jesus when the day of Wrath comes Jesus
[1:21:51] comes
[1:21:52] and the Bible said every eye will see
[1:21:54] him
[1:21:57] let's come to him in Mercy right now
[1:22:00] he promises Mercy to all them that come
[1:22:03] praise God
[1:22:07] I'm going to look at this more on Sunday
[1:22:08] but or Wednesday
[1:22:11] I want to buy our musicians to come here
[1:22:16] Proverbs 24 let's say nor feet
[1:22:19] Proverbs 24 verse 15. maybe I'll start
[1:22:21] with this on Wednesday
[1:22:23] lay not wait o Wicked Man against the
[1:22:26] dwelling of the righteous
[1:22:28] spoil not his resting place
[1:22:33] for a just man Fallen seven times
[1:22:37] and riseth up again
[1:22:41] but the wicked shall fall into
[1:22:45] Hallelujah
[1:22:51] I got one too so maybe we can sing yours
[1:22:52] first
[1:22:53] we might have the same song
[1:22:55] Hallelujah
[1:22:58] first I preached all that
[1:23:02] to encourage us that in the times we
[1:23:05] isolate ourselves God's still with us
[1:23:06] even when we isolate ourselves
[1:23:08] we don't want to talk about it we don't
[1:23:10] want to hear nothing about it
[1:23:12] we want to feel sorry for ourselves
[1:23:15] we want to complain
[1:23:17] we want to ignore obvious things that we
[1:23:20] need to take care of
[1:23:21] God is still with us in those moments
[1:23:29] and as you know it's natural to fall
[1:23:31] into mistakes
[1:23:33] that's what Humanity does
[1:23:36] Adam and Eve just naturally fell into it
[1:23:41] I'm reminded too where Jesus
[1:23:44] Peter said Lord how many times do I
[1:23:46] forgive my brother one day if my brother
[1:23:48] sins against me seven times should I
[1:23:50] forgive him he said no he said 70 times
[1:23:52] that
[1:23:55] that means Jesus said a man could fall
[1:23:57] 490 times and be forgiven in one day
[1:24:03] the Bible says here even a just man even
[1:24:06] a righteous man we're going to fall into
[1:24:07] mistakes
[1:24:10] but the Bible says we've got to rise
[1:24:13] again
[1:24:17] not to rise again
[1:24:21] I'm talking about whatever situation
[1:24:23] that we have ignored or not taken care
[1:24:25] of we've got to take care of that
[1:24:27] situation it's got to be brought under
[1:24:28] the blood of Jesus
[1:24:31] Hallelujah
[1:24:34] let's bow our heads here for a word of
[1:24:36] Prayer
