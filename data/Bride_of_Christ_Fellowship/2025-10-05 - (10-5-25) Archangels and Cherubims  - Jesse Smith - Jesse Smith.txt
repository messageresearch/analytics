TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Uh why don't we start in Jude 1 vers9. We'll just start there. I like to preach on archangels and cherubims this morning here by God's grace. I'll leave the tithes and offering basket up here for today. All right. Norma, I have it over there, but um I'll just sit over there because of the the bread and the wine and so forth by God's grace. So, Jude 1:9 and then we'll go to Daniel chapter 12. Uh, by the grace of the Lord, Jude 1:9, and then Daniel 12:1. I'll read verse 9 and then we can all read uh Daniel 12:1 together. Jude 1:9 says, "Yet Michael the archangel when contending with the devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, dur not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke thee." Let's go to Daniel 12:1. There's only two mentions of the word archangel in the entire Bible. So, this is a a smaller pool we we'd say uh to draw from as far as understanding archangels. Uh cherubims would be the most uh there's over 60 mentions of cherubim in the Bible. So I imagine we'll spend most of our time on the cherubim today by God's grace. And of course ties in perfectly with communion uh because that's the first place where God told Aaron and Moses he'd have communion with them between the wings of the cherubam. So, I'm thankful it lines up here uh by God's grace. And I trust you have a wonderful service here today as we approach the Lord's the Lord's supper, the Lord's table. Amen. Daniel 12:1 is speaking of, of course, the tribulation period, a time of trouble that the world uh will never see. Has never seen the likes of it before nor after. Daniel 12:1. Let's read if we can. 1 2 3. And at that time shall Michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people. And there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. And at that time thy people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book. Let's have one more word of prayer. Father God, we're thankful for the word of God today. Lord, again, Lord, we see another witness of you, Lord, sending your angel to deliver your people, Lord God. We learn that, Lord, in the book of Psalm 34:7, how you send your angel to encamp around us and to deliver your people. Lord, here we see again another angel that will deliver your people. Lord, thank you, God, for sending help to the heirs of salvation. We are humbled to know that we're heirs of salvation by the grace of God. May it never become common, Lord God. May we always fear the Lord and may we always reverence your presence. Dear Lord, bless this reading of thy word to your people as we approach your table, your supper, the communion in Jesus Christ's name. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; amen. God bless you as you're being seated. Praise God. So we'll start with archangels. Uh we looked at uh of course the angel of the Lord for two services and uh we showed how the greatest angel there ever was would have been God in angel form. Hallelujah. We'd say it's the Lord Jesus in his logos form. And we saw how he uh revealed himself to numerous men uh attached to his covenants. He would make a covenant and then he would reveal himself to that person with the covenant. Praise God. And uh thankful I'm thankful to know the angel Lord came down in Revelation chapter 10. Hallelujah. I'm thankful that we have received a messenger, a prophet of God. Praise the Lord. That received uh the covenant by the grace of God. Do you remember church? Brother Am said outside of the seven seals and the seven church ages. He said that was my commission from God. He said outside of that, who remembers what was the highlight of his ministry? The token. Does anybody remember that by God's grace? He said that in desperation 1963, brother Ram said, "Outside of my regular commission, the most important message to get to the people was the token that we are all right. &gt;&gt; You're baptized with the Holy Ghost. Your soul is sealed unto the day of its redemption." &gt;&gt; That was the highlight sermon other than the commission that the Lord sent him to do. Hallelujah. Amen. And what is the token? It's the It's the confirmation that the covenant has been received. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The token is we'd say the ticket to get on the plane or the ticket to get on the bus and we all got to have the ticket if we're going to fly and all these things. That's what the token is. It's the ticket knowing that God has received you that you're going to be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; What a token. Hallelujah. And so, we're thankful that God came down as the angel of the Lord. Met with brother Brandham day after day to deliver uh the revelation of the seven seals. Hallelujah. We know there's a little bit left uh to be revealed. Hallelujah. Some of it will not be revealed. Amen. It's the unknown day and hour of the rapture. Hallelujah. That revelation of the seventh seal. No man knows the day or the hour. Uh that will not be revealed to any man. Even Jesus says he doesn't know it. Only the father knows it. Hallelujah. So there are some secrets of course God keeps to himself. Amen. And of course, you know, in each of those services, we I took the last few minutes and just looked out looked at how we have a guardian angel given to us. And the guardian angel is there to deliver us uh to help us because we are the heirs of salvation. Amen. And brother Bram said, I'll just rehearse from the last time. Brother Bram said, when that angel comes around, people start weeping. People start crying. He says sometimes they'll shout, sometimes they'll weep. He says, "Sometimes they'll bow their head. Sometimes they'll throw up their hands and scream uh because the presence of the angel of the Lord. Hallelujah. So we want to be mindful of that today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We should uh invite the presence of God into this service every service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should invite the presence of God into our lives on a daily basis. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when the angel of the Lord comes, he brings a special feeling. The Bible most often calls it fear. uh they the the believers had fear that the angel was there. And so that's how we would feel. Brother Ram would say his angel that would come to him. He said uh uh was not an archangel. It wasn't a wasn't a cherubam or anything like that. He said just it was a regular angel. Uh he said there since his birth, he said but he could always notice. He said he's here. The angel Lord is here. Hallelujah. So he could recognize the presence of the angel Lord. And church that's what we want to do today. We want to recognize God's presence in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he's going to come and visit us in a special way. We want to recognize that and be beneficiaries of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We do not want to grieve the angel of the Lord. Hallelujah. Uh we want to invite the presence of the Lord and we want to receive what he has for us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that last one I read? Remember the woman battling arthritis? Brother Ram said for a day in a row the angel would hover over her with his arms folded and she just couldn't accept it. I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy to for my healing. But brother Ram said, "Look how faithful God was." He kept sending the angel until after the final meeting, the angel stood there. And when everybody's dispersed, everybody left. She's still there sitting in her wheelchair. She's finally able to accept it and she gets up, gets healed of arthritis, pushes out the wheelchair, &gt;&gt; testifying that an angel has visited me. Amen. Hallelujah. May God visit us today. Hallelujah. He might visit you in your home or in a service or something along those lines, but let's keep trusting in God. Let's let's be able to accept the promise of God when he sends it to us and receive it and be beneficiaries because we're heirs of salvation. &gt;&gt; Now, let's get to archangel here. I don't want to spend too much time on my review. Uh the archangel uh seems to be uh one of the highest angels. Now, there's only two mentions. We read one of them in uh Jude 1:9 speaking of Michael and of course Michael here in Jude 1:9 is connected to the body change of Moses. We know Moses was uh almost a perfect type of Christ. So when Moses died up on the mountain uh at some point Satan went looking for his body but God had resurrected that and God had taken Moses uh and the body to heaven. And we know that because 1500 years later, Jesus is on Mount Transfiguration and Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus. Hallelujah. And so, Brother Bam tells us God didn't keep Moses out of the promised land. God eventually let him in the promised land. Hallelujah. He just had to wait about 1,500 years. But of course, time goes faster in heaven. Hallelujah. Amen. So, God was gracious to Moses. Amen. God will be gracious to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we see that mentioned and we only see one other time the word archangel mentioned in the Bible. 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 16 again in the rapture text or a body change text. And so at this point, you know, alls I can do is just presume. And uh as long as I let you know I'm presuming, then there's no harm in that. Hallelujah. Because I'm not trying to express that I have some greater revelation. Uh I don't. I'm just noticing uh patterns in the scripture. But in uh 1 Thessalonians 4 uh 16, we're we're seeing the three steps of the rapture process. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel. Now, one archangel, one voice from one archangel. So, people have specul speculated, could this be Michael? It could be. Could it be another archangel? It could be, right? But in the Bible, we're only told about one archangel, Michael. Now, there's quotes. Brother Ram says there's archangels, right? So, more than one. And I'm not here to I can't say only what the Bible says, right? So, perhaps there's many archangels, but in the Bible, they just list one archangel. Praise God. And so, we wonder, could the voice of Michael be the voice that resurrects the dead? Because Michael's connected to the resurrected Moses. Hallelujah. So, could it be? I don't know, church. But alls I know is that I want to hear it. Praise God. Hallelujah. Alls I know is I want to if I if I pass and go to the grave, I want to hear the voice of the archangel that will raise up the dead in Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there's a connection to resurrected Christians with voice, one voice of one archangel. Hallelujah. Now, some will say that Michael is Christ. I don't believe that. There's only a couple of quotes on that and brother Bram never preaches a whole sermon on it uh because of all the other quotes where brother Bram talks about how angels uh are lower than Christ and I don't I don't ascribe to that but it's not it's nothing for me to argue out about with somebody &gt;&gt; unless you're trying to correct or connect that uh Michael is Christ as some form of salvation then you've went too far and then you're uh then you're inching into to uh I say polluting the gospel of salvation. Brother Ram said you can never major on a minor. &gt;&gt; So when people start uh messing with salvation and maybe connect it to some angel or something like that, salvation is by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not by accepting an angel or not by speaking in tongues or saying you believe the message of the hour or God sent a prophet. Salvation is trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ when you repented of your sins, knowing that Christ became your sin that you might be made his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. The good old gospel of the good news. We're not saved by works. We're saved by grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we stand where the Bible stands. Hallelujah. We stand on the truths of the Bible, the majors of the Bible. Amen. And so we see a connection here with the voice of the archangel with the resurrected dead in Christ. Hallelujah. And then the final step of course is the trump of God where uh he tells us also Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 15 it's in the moment in the twinkle of an eye at the last trump that those that are alive and remain their bodies are swallowed up in life. Death is swallowed up in life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By the trump of God. Amen. Uh, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Hallelujah. Let's just read 17 is such a promise. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. So shall we ever be with the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see the dead in Christ rise first. Now, Brother Ram takes us back to the resurrection of Jesus and how the the people on earth saw the resurrected bodies before Jesus ascended, right? before they met in the air, we'd say, or the meeting in the air. And brother Ram says, perhaps that'll happen in this second coming of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we'll see the dead in Christ rising, he said, for 30 or 40 days, or he said, or a month or so. Perhaps we'll see that. I hope we do. But all I know is that Jesus will get his bride ready and the rapture will not be one moment late. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If he got them ready for the first coming of Christ, he'll get us ready for the second coming of Christ. Amen. God knows how to do it. Amen. And there will not be one that misses the rapture that was supposed to go in the rapture because God had a book, hallelujah, in heaven called the lamb's book of life. And every name on that book, hallelujah, is redeemed by the lamb and empowered by the lamb and in love with the lamb and married to the lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, brother tells us, I'm just going to read this quote from 1955, the presence of the Lord Jesus. Brother Ram said, "We know Joseph Smith didn't receive a true angel because that angel added entire books to the Bible." Amen. He said, "A real true angel will come and vindicate this scripture to the dot." &gt;&gt; So if anybody would ever say, "Well, brother Jesse, I met an angel or an angel visit me." I would say, "What did that angel say?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because Satan transforms himself into an angel of light. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And a true angel of God will never add or take away one dot or tit from this scripture. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One jot or one tit. Forgive me if I said that wrong. Amen. You know the scripture. And I mentioned that even last Wednesday how that man in Africa predicted the rapture and was way off. He did not see Jesus. He saw Satan disguised as Jesus &gt;&gt; because the Bible said Jesus said no man knows the day or the hour of the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So it's it's easy to know. Hallelujah. It's e I shouldn't say it's easy. Uh it's obvious to know the elect cannot be deceived. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have that promise. We will not be deceived. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the deception has to get worse and worse and more cunning and more cunning. But what will that move you to do? That will move you to have a closer walk with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, thank God, church. We ought to thank God for our trials today because they're drawing us closer to Christ. We'll thank God for that difficult person in our life because that difficult person forces us down to our knees to pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That difficult work situation or when things are tight financially, what does that do? It gets you on your knees saying, "God, I need to hear from you." And that prayer time with God, that communion with God gets you closer to his heart. Helps you to hear his voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you might not have that if you weren't going through that particular trial. All things work together for good to them that love the Lord. I said all things work together for good. &gt;&gt; All things. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now, we also know that Michael was uh the leader of God's armies in heaven in Revelation 12:7. Honey, you want to pull that up there? And then there's other mentions of Michael, of course, where we see Michael is the is a winner of a war. This angel didn't lose. This angel only knows how to win. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, do you think he's going to win in the tribulation or not? Do you think Satan's going to be able to gather all the all the armies uh the uh the kings of the east and the kings of the north, Russia and China? Do you think that Satan's armies could possibly defeat Michael's armies? I'd say certainly not. If he beat him before, he can beat him again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. God will stand up for Israel. And I'm talking about the 144,000. Hallelujah. Not those that are uh abominable and so forth. Like like Paul said, not all Israel is Israel. Hallelujah. Only the elected, the ones whose names are in the Lamb's book of life. And last time I checked, that was about 1% of all the Israelis on the earth. 1%, hallelujah, will actually be saved. So think about that. 99% are lost. Only 1% is saved. Hallelujah. I would say the bride is less than that. We just passed eight billion people on the earth. I would say the bride is less than a tenth of 1%. Hallelujah. But either way, God's in the minority, but we are not alone. Although we're smaller number, we're not alone. As Elisha knew, we are encamped by angels that surround us. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God's angel armies are with us. Hallelujah. Now brother said now these minor angels perhaps he says and he says notice he said it's angels with us that comes to your humble servants. So brother says a minor angel comes to him in his in his we would say in his regular ministry of praying for the sick. Now did the Lord Jesus meet him? Yes. To open the revelation of the seven seals. He told us that. He said the pillar of fire would be there and show him the vision of the meaning of of the seal. He'd have to write it down as long as the pillar of fire was there and spend the rest of the day searching it out to make sure the revelation came from the Bible. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, that's probably a minor angel, but when Gabriel comes, brother, that's something really on the road. Something major going to happen." I'll say it like this. When Michael comes, something major is going to happen. A prophet's going to be resurrected. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The dead in Christ will rise when Michael stands up. Hallelujah. Amen. And when he comes back at Armageddon, uh the entire armies of the world will be defeated because Michael standing up for his people. Hallelujah. 144,000 will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Because Michael's there standing up for the people of God. No weapon that's formed against them shall prosper. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God will send his angel to protect his people. Glory. My something major is on the road. Now, brother says this, I don't understand this, but he says, Gabriel announced the first coming of the Lord Jesus, and Gabriel will announce the second coming of the Lord Jesus. So, I don't know if that's already happened or not. I don't know, and I don't have a scripture. I'm just reading you the quote. Amen. Hallelujah. So, we see Revelation 12:7. Let's read that, hun again, just to show what a a warrior Michael is, uh, by the grace of God. Then, we'll go to Daniel 10. And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought against uh fought and his angels. Let's do the next one here. By God's grace, and prevailed not, neither was their place found anymore in heaven. So, I like that that Michael keeps the place of the angel. Michael's going to keep the place of the Jewish people, the real Jews. Michael's going to keep the place of the dead in Christ. Hallelujah. In other words, God has a protection for his people. Every true believer is gonna their place is going to pro be protected by the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And church, you and I have a position in Christ. The Bible said we're seated in heavenly places to be kings and priests unto God. Let me say it like this. Who's going to keep you praising God? The angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who's going to keep you praying? The angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're going to help you keep your position so you don't fall away. You don't get cold on God. &gt;&gt; You don't leave God. You don't desert God. You don't go away like Judas or something like that. But you stay with God because the angel of God is camped around you to minister to your needs. Hallelujah. The Bible calls them ministers of flames of fire. Hallelujah. The Bible calls them deliverers. God's angel will deliver you so you can keep praising God so you can keep praying to keep you as a king and priest unto God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like brother Rod said, he was this far from falling away. What kept him, church? The angel Lord kept him from falling away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We read it last night uh with with Moses when he's pushed on the ark. Brother Ram said, "What protected that ark with all those crocodiles in the Nile?" Brother Ram said the angels of God were around him. And so when the crocodiles would come up, the angel would pull out the sword and they'd tuck tail and run away from Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. God protecting his children. God protecting the position of the believer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God needed a prophet. So God uh sent angels to protect their position. God needs a bride. So he sent his angel pro to protect his bride today. Church, you're protected by the almighty hand of God and his angels. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a blessing that we have today. Hallelujah. Now remember Daniel 10:13. If you pull that one up there, we see Michael again. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withtood me 1 and 20 days. So this is a particular angel. I don't know what kind of angel this is. I know earlier in the book there's a watcher angel. We'll get to that maybe next service, Lord willing. But this minor angel can only get to Daniel through the help of Michael the archangel. Hallelujah. He says, now he said, uh, the prince of Persia withtood me one in 21 days, but oh, Michael, one of the chief princes. Now, here we go. One of the chief princes. So, this makes it seem like there's more than one archangel, right? Because another word, another King James word for archangel would be prince. that great prince Michael, right? But lo, Michael, one of the chief princes came to the help came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Persia. Then that then down in verse 21, it says, "But I will shoe thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth, and there's none that withholdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince." Hallelujah. Amen. So he have God had Michael assigned to get this revelation to the prophet of God. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. There was an angel in heaven that God commissioned to get brother Brandham the word of God, the word of truth. Thus sayith the Lord for us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And church, do you realize God sent the angel? You know, sometimes we seek revelation and all these things. Sometimes we want to know God's will. But did you know if God ever sent you an angel, he would he would tell you something in here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what does that encourage you? Just stay in here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just look in here. An angel visit. Daniel said, "Look back to the scripture." If an angel angel visits, Brother Ram, look back to the scripture. If an angel visits us, it'll say, "Look in the Bible. Look for the truth." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He's not going to add one word. He's not going to take one word away. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The archangel. Amen. So, that's all I'm going to say about archangel. Now, let's look at the cherub here or the cherubims. Uh, by God's grace. Now recently I preached on the throne of God. How many remember that a couple was it last month I preached on the throne of God? Now casea let's let's just review here briefly. Cherubam here. Let's look at this briefly. I kind of showed this when I preached on it. I don't know if you remember. Maybe you remember once you see it. Does anybody remember? Raise your hand. Does anybody remember? Okay. Couple. All right. Glory. Hallelujah. So I I did a little study on this. A brother, precious brother from Minnesota asked me, could you do a a teaching on it? And so I took a couple weeks and off and on tried to look at it. So man is three parts, right? Now we know Larkin Larkin had these wrong. Brother Ram straightened it out. Soul is the innermost part. Uh spirit, mind, and then body. And so Moses Moses saw Moses saw this in heaven, right? And he copied it. But we know man is the temple of the Holy Ghost as well, right? But Moses saw this in heaven. And Moses, there was a outer court, holy place, and holiest of holies. Hallelujah. And remember the cherubam were right seated. They were connected to the mercy seat. Hallelujah. So, brother makes a statement. He said cherubam are interested in humans. Now, this could open up a whole another angle, but I've I've consider this. It's possible your guardian angels are cherubam. It's possible. You can't rule that out. because of this. Now, I just I just what I taught you is I said, "Well, there's possibly a separate group of angels called ministering spirits, right? That are guardian angels, but there's also a possibility that our guardian angels are cherubam because your throne, I'm sorry, your heart is also another throne of God." And what do the cherubam do? They sit on the throne. Hallelujah. and they're face in to the presence of God, right? The two cherubam face each other, their wings touch, and they're there looking in to the mercy seat. And the mercy seat is where God's presence dwells. And there's also blood. So, the worshipper can talk to God and be accepted. Without blood, no communion. Hallelujah. Without blood, no fellowship. &gt;&gt; Thank God we've got the blood of Jesus Christ today. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why some people can't have communion with God or they can't learn the things of God because they've never let the blood be applied to their lives. &gt;&gt; They say, "I don't know what God wants me to do or I I I can't find the will of God." I'm talking about people that can never find it. Never. Right? They might come to church and all these things, but they can never find it. It's because the blood must be applied. &gt;&gt; And that only comes by repenting of all your sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not not on a list but just God you know everyone forgive me and to really mourn over your sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there is a possibility that your guardian angel is a cherub. It's very possible because cherub were right on the mercy seat in the very presence of God. Hallelujah. Now Moses what Moses saw some something in heaven very similar the sacrificial altar and brother Ram tells in the fifth seal the Jews which this this makes perfect sense the Jews since the days of Jesus that rejected Christ but were saved and kept the law he said the Jews are under the altar crying how long oh Lord Ram said the Holocaust victims there the true Jews that 1% I'll say like that right that's how it is for every every nation right just barely few saved he said the Jews accuser under the sacrificial altar crying, "How long, oh Lord, holy and true, dust thou not avenge our blood upon the face of them on the earth?" Right? But the Lord comes back and says, "There's still a number of brethren that must give their lives." So this is a beautiful picture. Israel can't come into here because they they're blinded to the Messiah. They were never truly under the blood of Jesus &gt;&gt; because God had to blind them because they rejected him and he had to take a gentile bride. Ah, &gt;&gt; but in here, but in here in the throne, we see 24 elders, hallelujah, surrounding the throne. And they're they're joining the the cherubam crying, "Holy, holy is the Lord all Lord God Almighty, all glory, power, dominion, might." Hallelujah. So we see people here, we see people out here. So people that are in here, they've accepted the blood of Jesus Christ. They've repented of their sins. They know Jesus as their Messiah. So in one way spiritually, the blood or the spirit of God's been applied to our hearts. May we repent of our sins, church. Each and every one of us repent fully of all of our sins that the spirit of God can be applied to the throne of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this is where the Bible picks it up and shows there's four cherub. Hallelujah. The Bible calls them beasts or living creatures as well, which we'll look at here today. There's four beasts or four living creatures that are around the throne. Hallelujah. Now, don't leave out this holy place there, right? Prayers. You got to pray. If you want the Holy Ghost, you really got to learn how to pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just, Lord, bless the food and Lord, I lay me down to sleep, but really pray, pour out your heart before him in love. Hallelujah. Really die out to yourself. Brother Abraham says, of course, a sea of glass in there as well. That's connected. We see that revelation with the uh Israel as well because they have the song of Moses around the sea of glass. So notice Israel not able to go in because they didn't accept the blood of Jesus Christ. All right. Now that's just a very general statement there. Now, for some reason, I emphasized this holy place in here. Uh I'm not sure why I did that, but anyways, a closer look. You get a closer look at the throne of God, the rainbow, the lamb. Uh and you have the four cherub there by God's grace. I'm just going to give you some visuals and we're going to read about these here. Now, I made that just with AI. That's a chat GTP uh and just took my words and tried to make it there. I was just trying to show how uh the throne of God has has brother said it's moved, right? It's moved or it's been different places. So, here in in the garden, there was a throne of God. There was a tree of life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? And we know that was the spirit of Jesus. Satan was the tree of knowledge and good evil. Hallelujah. That's a deep revelation there. Now, when Adam and Eve sinned, the Bible said in re or Genesis 3 that God placed cherubam there to guard the way of tree of life. &gt;&gt; And I read this morning, brother Random said, "This is where Cain and Abel would go to worship God." Amen. Doesn't that make perfect sense? There's cherubam protecting the presence of God. So this is where Cain and Abel would come and Abel would slice the the throat of the lamb, let the blood bleed out and God would somehow vindicate that sacrifice, but Cain would just bring uh fruit, right? Or or vegetables or something like that. It wasn't blood, but this was the place of worship. So again, we see connected, we see blood and God's presence, and we see cherubam. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. always connected. They're always connected. So, this was the throne of God on earth. Brother Ram calls them throne guards. Another word is zoom in the Greek. You'll hear brother say zooms or I'm sorry, zoo with an n. Zoom. How many heard that? 1961 the revelation series. Brother preach that. Zooms. He called them living creatures. But here, look. We see man, God, the throne of God, cherubam, blood, worship. That's where God's presence was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Moses built this and he said in Exodus 25:22, "And there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubams which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which I give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel." Amen. So anything God was going to speak to them, it's going to be between the cherubam. Oh, hallelujah. Anything God reveals to you, it's going to be on the throne of your heart. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I love that verse. I think it's in uh Acts chapter 7 where Stephen, he's not a preacher, but he's uh rebuking the Pharisees that are about to stone him. And he says, "When Moses was about 80, the Bible says it entered into his heart to visit his children, his brethren." And I love that. Where did it enter, church? Where did the word of God enter Moses? Into his heart. The throne of God. So see church, you may not hear voice of God. You might not hear the voice of Jesus. You might not hear the voice of the angel, but when God speaks to you, he's going to speak to the throne of your heart at times. You've heard people say, "I just got a burden on my heart for this. I've got a burden on my heart for that." Many times I preach it just cuz I had a burden on my heart. And someone will say, "That's exactly what I needed to hear." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God speaks to us from the throne of our heart. &gt;&gt; How do we know? I don't know. It's just a presence on my heart. Amen. It's just God place something there. In other words, God's presence is there and it's urging me to do something. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So may we keep our heart holy for Jesus. Not let anything get upon the throne of our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not let any idols in. Don't let any idols in. Don't give anything else your heart. Don't give it to Delilah. Praise God. Don't be like Samson. Give God both your strength and give God your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the days of Moses again the high priest would offer. Now, he doesn't have on the urum, so I'm not sure. It must not have been a complete picture. But anyways, you have the throne guards there. So, blood had to be there. Blood had to be there. Hallelujah. The blood brought the fellowship between God and man. And church, you're here today. Why? Because you want fellowship with God. And it comes by the blood of the lamb. It comes by the Holy Spirit communing on the throne of our hearts. So, let's be sensitive to what the Holy Spirit is putting on our hearts today. Amen. Now, again, I'm just showing the picture as a review there with the uh the three furniture elements in the in the holy place before they move into the holiest of holies. So, here the here Israel is divided into four camps. Those four camp represent the four cherubam up in heaven. Hallelujah. Because they surround the presence of God. All right, everybody see that? And of course, each one had four flags uh with the four uh three animals and the one human head, right? The the wisdom of man. Hallelujah. So, those are connected to each one of the camps. And these represent cherabs. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon calls them throne guards. Then we see them in Revelation chapter 4. Just another artist picture. I love these artist pictures. Amen. Just makes me long for heaven. Hallelujah. Makes me wish I could draw like that. Amen. Uh just how beautiful it's going to be. And uh imagine the glory of God in the presence of God. And the Bible said angels surround the presence of God. Hallelujah. Around the throne. But there's four in particular, cherub that are around the throne of God. Again, another picture say same idea here. 24 here. You see the 24 elders and you see the four beasts around the throne of God. Now, brother Ram says those two uh I'm sorry, the two throne guards revelation. I'm sorry. There's two revelations of the throne guards. Brother Ram said there's there's four anointings to the churches, right, throughout the seven church ages. Hallelujah. So, we know it was uh we know it was lion and then axe and then man and then eagle. So, we're in the eagle age. We're the only one that's flying up in the heavenlies which represents revelation and sight. Hallelujah. Amen. We're the only ones with the book revealed with thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. were the only ones that know the revelation of the mysteries of God with thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And brother Ram said then these four cherubam they protect the book of acts and he gives us two examples. He gives us uh salvation and divine healing. This just a beautiful picture. Brother man said you can do this with every doctrine. Uh he said but he only gives two when he has time to preach it. So salvation and water baptism is in the book of Acts is connected to Acts 238. But baptism is protected. The water baptism of Acts is protected by all the four gospels. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John says there's much water, not sprinkling when you're baptized. Luke says you're you get repentance and remission of sins in his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Jesus commands go be baptized. He whoever is baptized shall be saved. And Matthew speaks of uh being saved in Matthew 1 7 and 28:19. Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father, son, and the holy ghost, which is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't you love that? Any truth God has, God protects it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then the last one I have is brother said, divine healing is protected. Now, I could I preached on the book of Acts last year, so I could put lots of different verses in there like Acts chapter 3 when the lame man gets healed. Divine healing is protected by all the four uh gospels. Hallelujah. Matthew protects it when Jesus sends out the 12. Luke is another uh repeats that where Jesus sends out the 12. Now, all the the New Testament church is given power for healings and miracles in Mark chapter 16. And then Jesus said in John 14, "These signs shall follow them that believe." He said, "And uh the works that I do shall you do also." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I think that's my last one. Yeah, that's my last one. Okay. So, I hope that was a helpful review. Is that helpful by God's grace? It's just a tie all together. Amen. Hope that's a help there since it was it was it was so fresh. It was so familiar to me about the throne of God. How cherubam surround the throne of God. Hallelujah. Now, we saw in Genesis 3:24, these cherubam had flaming swords on the earth. Hallelujah. And they were protecting the throne of I'm sorry, the presence of God on earth. And that's where Cain and Abel came to worship. Then we saw Exodus 25, God's uh uh communion or fellowship with Moses and Aaron was between the two cherubs on the mercy seat. That's where he dwelt in the days of Moses. Hallelujah. Now, I like Psalm 18:10. I like this one. Now, pull this one up here. This one is the one that makes me think perhaps our guardian angel or cherub. But again, I'm not sure, but this one makes me think it. What angel does God fly on when he comes down to rescue his people? The wings of a cherub. The Bible said, and remember this is thus sayith the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; right? And he rode upon a cherub and did fly. I love this. Yay. He did fly upon the wings of the wind. God don't have to use a cherub, &gt;&gt; but he gives the cherub a position. Amen. He gives the cherub a job because God loves his creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. God don't have to use you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Despite all of our faults and our failures and our mistakes and the guilt and shame we go through, God don't have to use us, but he still uses us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not worthy. That's why we must put on the white raignment today. Don't don't let that beat you up. Okay. If it does, repent of your sins. Get that white raignment back on. Praise God. Don't live in guilt. Don't live in shame. That's not what Jesus died to give you. He died to give you white raignment. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not stained up and guilty and bloody, all kinds of uh dirty raignment, filthy raignment. He died to give you white ramen. Hallelujah. He counseledled you to buy that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember, he he's the great counselor. Says, "You need to buy these three things." Now, thank God I've never went to a counselor, but if I had to go to a counselor, if that counselor said, "You got to do these three things and you'll make it," I'd surely do it. &gt;&gt; If the doctor said, "Go get these three things and you'll be healed of that." I'd do it in a heartbeat. &gt;&gt; Now, what about Jesus offering us three things today? Amen. &gt;&gt; Buy the gold, buy the white raignment, and make sure you buy the eyes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you do that, you'll be an overcomer in Leodysia. And you just won't be there at the resurrection. You'll be seated with him in his throne at the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me use Claude and Patrick since I saw them and they had a good soccer game yesterday. Now they lost, but they were really tried hard. You guys stand up here. Stand up. Come stand up here. Would you brothers do that? My pastor used me all the time when I was growing up. So he said, "Just come up." Okay. So I'm gonna use Oh, he's sleeping. You can stay there, buddy. You're his pillow. That's You stay right there, buddy. So cloth. Now here it is. If you overcome Leodosia, church, Jesus is seated on his throne. But then he'll have all these overcomers. This is the white throne judgment. Right now, just let's pretend he's sitting. He's not sitting, but let's pretend he's sitting. And Jesus will be separating uh the sheep from the goats. And a a goat will stand before him and say, "Well, Lord, uh I was a teenager in high school and and I I I I couldn't overcome. The temptations were too hard." Right? and he'll have all the excuses. And the Bible says the Lord will rise up. Rise up, Claude. And he'll be able to say, "I overcame high school temptations by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony." &gt;&gt; And the Lord will say, "Thank you. Be seated." Now, he can be seated. Let's give him a round of applause there, buddy. I say, you can be seated. He said, "Therefore, by the testimony of this believer that judges you unworthy. Depart from me, you worker of iniquity. I never knew you." So, see, church, you've got a you've got a purpose over there at Ken State, Sister Charlotte. Amen. You got a purpose. My wife went to Ken State, too. She's God could use her, too. Amen. Hallelujah. You got a purpose. There's a reason you are where you are. God wants you to overcome there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God has equipped you to overcome. Amen. Just while you're there at Ken State or while you're there at Garfield High School, buy the gold, buy the white raignment. Hallelujah. And by the ice and you will overcome. &gt;&gt; It's impossible for you not to. Praise God. Because this is what Jesus requires as a counselor. Get these three things. Hallelujah. And you will overcome the wicked one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, your heart will be a throne of God if you can just get these three things in Leodysia. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, getting back to this, God flies on the wings of Cherub. Now, I went through all 69. There's 69 mentions of cherub. Uh 68 in the Old Testament, one in the New Testament. And I tried to pick out the ones I thought might be a blessing. Now, it's interesting. Let's go to Ezekiel 10:2 just to get you a further picture of uh heaven. And church, I hope it makes you long for heaven. That's Ezekiel 10:1 and two. Then I looked, and behold, in the firminant that was above the head of the cherubams, there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. Okay, so this is in the Old Testament. Now, something changed. I don't know what changed in the New Testament. Well, we'll get to that in just a moment. So there's cherub, but above the cherub is a throne. That sounds really good. Jesus is the high high exalted one. High lifted up. Nobody's higher than Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like that. Amen. The cherubam are high, but there's a throne still higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the king of the universe. Amen. Verse two. And he spake unto the the man clothed with linen. He said, "Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubams, and scatter them over the city." And he went in in my sight. So I want you to notice this. The reason I bring this out is to show you the coals are not far from the cherub. But then what else is there? Saraphim. Saraphims are the ones with the coals. And friends, even saraphim have interaction with human, right? Because they interacted with Isaiah. And what did they do for Isaiah? They cleansed him from his filthiness. He said, "I'm a man unclean of unclean lips and I dwell amongst unclean people." God said, "I've got a remedy. I'll send a seraraphim with a coal of fire. I'll send holy fire to clean out your mouth and make sure you say the right thing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Amen. So, not only are cherubam interested in humans to come down and save humans, as the Bible said, God rides on the cherub, but God also sends seraraphims to give us the spirit of burning to clean us out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, I want you to see this. You have the throne. Underneath that, you have cherubam. And not far from that are these coals of fire. heavenly fire. Hallelujah. God uses the heavenly fire, right, to cleanse his servants and send them out. Now, go down to verse 20 in uh Ezekiel 10:20. Here's where they're called living creatures. This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel. Amen. By the river Chabbar. And I knew that they were the cherubams. Hallelujah. Don't you love that? Amen. living creature under the God of Israel. So Ezekiel knew the God of Israel sits on the throne. Hallelujah. He's still the God of Israel. &gt;&gt; He's still the God of the Gentiles. He's still the God of the bride. Hallelujah. And I'll say this, he still sits on his throne. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And church, we can have communion with that God today. &gt;&gt; The God of Israel, the God of the Gentiles. Hallelujah. Those two becoming one. As uh Ephesians chapter 3 says, the great mystery, God breaking down the middle wall, partition between Jew and Gentile, making one man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So there, the Bible calls them living creatures in Ezekiel 10:20. But let's go back up to verse 14 and 15. Ezekiel 10:14 and 15. Here's where we get a little bit. This is the thing I don't understand about cherub, of course, as I mentioned. Verse 14 says, "And everyone had four faces, and the first face was the face of a cherub, right? Cherub. And the second face was the face of a man." Now, this should this should sound very familiar with the picture I just showed you, right? And the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of a eagle. Now, that's very familiar, right? Cherub, man, lion, eagle. The only one that's missing is the ox. So, does the ox have a face as a cherub? I don't know. That would be the most likely guess that I would I would I would say if I'm guessing, but I'm not here to guess. I'm just showing you here the correlation. Ezekiel sees the cherub in heaven and they got those four faces that we're so familiar with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, verse 15. And the cherubams were lifted up. That is the living creature that I saw by the river Chabbar. Hallelujah. So Ezekiel sees these high lifted up and he sees those four faces. And brother Ram said, John and Daniel and Ezekiel and Moses, Amen, they all saw the same thing in heaven. Hallelujah. Glory. Let's go to Revelation 4:6. Revelation 4:6. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like under crystal. And the midst of the throne around about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. All right, so future past, right? Verse 7. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast was like a calf. Now, maybe that's the face of a cherub, right? As Ezekiel 10 says, I don't know. And the third beast had a face as a man. And the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And these four beasts had each of them six wings round about him. And they were full of eyes within, and they rest not day or night, saying, "Amen, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and is and is to come." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. So we see their whole life is surrounding the throne of God and giving God praise, saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." That's what our lives should be. Our lives bel should should say holy, holy, holy in everything that we do. &gt;&gt; Because your heart is the throne of God as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. These are the same uh beasts, living creatures, the zoons, brother Brandham calls it. And the Bible said they had six wings there in Revelation. Each beast had six wings. And brother brother tells us what they are. I don't remember. Uh action uh service and humility I think are yeah action action service humility. Brother tells us brother said that's a real servant if I ever saw one. Amen. A servant in action right? A servant with humility. Hallelujah. That type of servant. That's what we need to be servants for our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I can't uh go further without mentioning the other chair we know Lucifer. Let's go to uh Ezekiel 28 14. Ezekiel 28:14. Now, we've already said he's like a lion roaring about seeking who whom he may devour. He transforms himself into an angel of light. So, he transforms himself like he's trying to bring some revelation or or bring some assistance or bring some help. He's not bringing anything but division. That's what he's bringing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll say it. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I'll have to amen myself a little bit here. That's okay. I know. Maybe I'm going along here. About 50 minutes. That's not too bad. Ezekiel 28:14. Now, actually, I'll go up to 12. I'm just going to skip down. It's a It's a compound prophecy of the king of Tyrie. Thou seals up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. So, nobody was more wise. Nobody was more beautiful than Lucifer. So, think about that, church. By the There's major angels, minor. Satan was the major of all of them. Nobody was more wise. Nobody was more beautiful. Church, consider it a blessing. If you're not the most beautiful or the most wise or the strongest or the most handsomest, consider it a blessing on your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said not many great ones can receive the revelation of the gospel. &gt;&gt; It is such a temptation to be the strongest or the the the handsomest or the prettiest, anything like that. It's such a temptation. Why? Because Satan recognizes that's how I was, right? And he tries to influence that person who so outwardly looks like they got everything together. My goodness. Let's be mindful of the battle Satan's fighting. Hallelujah. Let's let's turn him down at every one of his tricks. Brother Abraham says, right? And you turn him down with it is written. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, the Bible says, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Now 13, thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God. Because Michael kicked him out right down into the garden. Every precious stone was thy covering, the sardis, the topaz, the diamond, the barrel, onyx, jasper, the sapphire, emerald, and the carbuncle, and the gold. So, he's got a he's got an imitation gold. We don't want that kind of gold. We want the gold of Christlike character. &gt;&gt; That's one thing Satan can't do. He can't live this word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He cannot love God, church. We ought to be so encouraged that you love God and you can obey God. Satan cannot do that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He cannot live the word of God. He cannot overcome his own sin and his own pride. We ought to feel so thankful if God's given us grace to overcome certain addictions in our lives. It proves we're overcomers. It proves we're not serving him. It proves we're serving Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, he has to obey what God says, but he don't like it. &gt;&gt; So, church, let's obey God and like it. &gt;&gt; Brother Chris, &gt;&gt; certainly. Yep. Yeah. Uh yeah, every person has free will. Yeah, brother Ram says that's and because God because God gives free will then nobody can condemn him on the day of judgment. But God even said though, God even says in Romans nine though, even if that's their argument, God said, "Well, can't the potter do whatever he wants with the clay? Who you going to tell God? Who's going to tell God he can't make something the way he wants to do it?" Right? So either way, and and I could be wrong. If there's no free will, that's fine, too. But uh Brother Bam says there's free will. The Bible says, "Choose you this day whom you may serve." The Bible lays because you chose this. Right? Uh the Danny Henry prophecy of brother Brandon because you chose this because you chose the harder way. &gt;&gt; Right. So each one Yeah. I believe God gives free will and that works perfectly with predestination. Brother Ram says this in the message Thirst 65. If you want to listen to this thirst 1965, brother Ram said uh that God has to give free will, but he can predestinate because he knows what they're going to choose in their free will. So therefore, he can still predestinate because he knows what you're going to choose. Does that make sense, brother? He gives you a free will, but he's so great he can't be limited. He knows what you're going to choose. He knows you. He knew he knew you'd choose the message. Amen. He knew it. Hallelujah. And he he So he can do both. That's why we're not Calvinists and uh Armenianist, I'm sorry, Calvinist and Armenianism. Calvinist is like, "Oh, God. Uh it's all predestinated, all predestinated." Uh uh the the the ar I can never say that word. Armenium. Armenianism. Say it, honey. Armenian. Thank you. Thank you. I always appreciate you, honey. Armenian says you got free will. It's all free will. But brother says when you got two camps, the truth is right down the middle. Right. There is free will and there is predestination, &gt;&gt; right? Because if if you take the Calvinist, well, you leave out all these verses. If you take the Armenian, you lose out all the Cal the Calvin verses. So, we're not Calvinists. We're not Armenius. We're Holy Ghost fil Christians. My wife and I went to this supper two Saturdays ago where Malachi was playing the piano. And it it was just fresh. It was just it was just uh fresh for me to say it. Uh the man shook my hand right away. Uh his name was Marlon. He says, "So, what church what church are you a part of? And I said, 'Well, if I said, 'If there's anything that we're a part of, uh, most like it's like Pentecostal except we don't have tongues as the interpretation or tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost, but we follow a prophet named William Brandom who restored the Bible back uh the revelations of God. I said, but just to make it plain, we call ourselves Holy Ghostfilled Christians. &gt;&gt; So, I went on this big long rant and I just I'm like, "Okay, I'll just say it the right way. We're just Holy Ghost fil Christians." Amen. And he said, "Okay." And he moved right on. I was like, I went to all that length just to get that. I was hoping he'd say, "Who's William Brandom?" Or, "You got a sermon or something like that." But it, you know, you try to explain what am I? I'm a Bible believing Holy Ghost fil Christian. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know God sent a prophet named William Brandham with thus sayith the Lord. Praise God. But I will not be attached to any organization because organization is death. Hallelujah. And all those daughters will be thrown back into a bed with their mother, the mother harlot, and they'll be burned with fire. My goal is to give them an idea of what I believe, but not be attached to the mother harlot. Hallelujah. There's one mother I want to be attached to. That's the new Jerusalem. Hallelujah. That's all of our mother. Amen. The new Jerusalem. Glory. Now, Satan was in the garden. He's got that false gold. the workmanship verse 13 of thy tabs and of thy pipes was prepared in the in the day that thou was created. So here we see the pipes and tabs tablets is like a tambourine. So he had some type of a tambourine instrument and then pipes like we see on a pipe organ. He had all this music ability and verse 14 thou art the anointed chair. Now that word anointed means overshadowed uh possibly mean wings. So in other words, uh maybe maybe Lucifer had the biggest wings of all of them, but he was the most beautiful and he was the wisest of all the cherub. Now George, does this surprise anybody that brother Ram would say cherub are interested in humans? Does this surprise anybody that Satan is interested in humans? He's interested in getting worshiped by humans. &gt;&gt; Right? Because God created the cherubam, protect the throne of God. Uh bring the people into worship. Protect the word of God so God's people can worship. And Satan saw that and he wanted that worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wants the worship. So we must make sure all the worship stays with Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now there I told you about that letter that was sent out about me. Now this is more personal for our church but uh four pastors have called me on that or I'm sorry two have called four of uh two others have sent messages and they said brother Jesse I feel led to tell you this that I was uh God used me to bring a man into the message. He became my song leader. He said he faithfully served song leader for 15 years and then he turned on me with an accusation against me and he said I feel he said I thought this was about you brother Jesse he's from South Carolina he said I thought this letter was about you because it said Akran on it and he said I just called you to encourage you he said when I went through that it was the hardest thing I ever went through so I'm sharing this in kindness here &gt;&gt; that God has somebody who's gone through something you're going through &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, he said, "When this song leader came against me," he said, "It hurt so much, but then I reached out to other pastors and they they had song leaders come against them." And he said, "Brother Jesse, we've just found it in churches." He said, "It's not always the song leader. With Jesus, it was the treasurer, &gt;&gt; right?" In other words, Satan's going to try to And how many preachers have fallen away from the gospel? The brother's point was when certain people get power and they feel like they want more then there's divisions in the leadership in the church. &gt;&gt; So he said, "I just wanted you to call you up to let you know, be encouraged. You're not the only one who's had a song leader or a trustee, right, or a deacon, right? Or a treasurer turn against them." Hallelujah. And he said it was just like God. He said God was like the pastor in heaven and Lucifer was the song leader, right? And so what what broke up the heaven church? It was the song leader. Now I'm not saying that about what happened with our church. I'm not making anybody out to be the devil. But he just said that. He said, "Be careful to the people who are in leadership. Make sure you stay humble." And the church said &gt;&gt; because he said Satan had all this power and all this influence and then all of a sudden it wasn't enough &gt;&gt; and he wanted more. He wanted worship, &gt;&gt; right? And we've all been part of churches for years. Some of us were raised in churches. I've seen it since I was raised. Uh there's always sa Satan's trying to battle the leadership. He's trying to get the pastor discouraged. I'll say like this. He's trying to get the song leader discouraged. He's trying to discourage the leadership. So, they'll want to quit and give up and then the sheep will be scattered, right? The sheep will be scattered from the shepherd. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about Jesus as the shepherd. But you have to have an earthly shepherd according to Ephesians 4:11. So, I just want to tell you church that whatever you're going through, there's somebody else who's gone through it. &gt;&gt; Take courage. Stand upon the word. Stay with the word of God. Know that God's if he himself has to ride down on a chair of him, he's going to come strengthen you. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to help you out in your time of weary, your time of discouragement. &gt;&gt; And church, I didn't know someone from South Carolina would think of me. I never even talked to the man, but he just saw me on YouTube, I guess, or something like that. And he just had it on his heart to tell me, uh, he said, "Just keep loving. Just keep showing love." He said, "Just keep standing for the word of God." He said, "God, just keep praying. God will take care of everything." How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 14. Thou art the anointed cherub that coverth, and I've set thee so. So God, brother Chris, he just stepped out. God said, God knew he was the most wise. He was the most beautiful. God sent him. Brother Ram said he was the right hand man to fellowship. That's quite a statement. Satan was God's right-hand man to fellowship. See, you can you can see how that would be because he was the wisest. Who else could talk with God about theology? Now, it's a little bit of a joke, but you understand. Who else could talk to God? Who was the smartest of all the angels? Lucifer was, right? But he was that cherub. He was near the throne of God. He said, "I've set thee." So, thou was upon the holy mountain of God. Thou walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Verse 15, "Thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee." And I think I'll stop right there. Oh, I'm sorry. Let's go to verse 17. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty. Thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness. He was so bright. Remember Isaiah calls him the son of the morning. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And Jesus is called the morning star. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Like Jesus the bright morning star, but the second brightest was Lucifer, son of the morning. He was so much like God, right? He was he was smartest. He was the the handsomest every everything most powerful most wise that made him think he was something and he tried to split the church and he succeeded taking a third of the angels right but this is Lucifer a fallen cherub church I'll just say it like this he fell from the presence of God he fell from the throne of God may God help us to always be a heart and soul that can be the throne of God let us always be a throne where the presence of God can dwell is what I was what I want to say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm kind of mixing up my words there. I'm trying to get it across. In other words, Satan left the presence of God. May you and I always stay in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Glory. How do you do that, Brother Jesse? Repent. Hallelujah. Revive. Get it. Revival. Hallelujah. Get your first love back. Buy of Jesus. Those three uh three uh articles you need to buy for the Leodysian church age. Glory. Now, brother Bram said, I'm going to read the quotes now where he said they're interested in human beings. Brother Brham said, notice these cherubams that John saw must have been interested in keeping the tree of life. So, they must be interested in human beings. So, Satan is interested in trying to steal your worship. But the cherubams of God are interested in trying to get you to worship God. The angels of God are here to help you worship him. Hallelujah. Now, is that a good refresher? Let me take a pause. Is that a good refresher on archangels and cherub? It's been a while. It's been five years since I preached on angels, at least according to my records. Hallelujah. So, now let me uh bring this down to close. I'll preach an hour. Here's a thought I want to close with. Now, if you got your Bible, let's go back to the book of uh Matthew here. Matthew 4:11. Now, I'm going to go back to the Lord Jesus here. The Lord Jesus getting visitations from angels. Now, did a cherub visit him? Perhaps, right? Perhaps it was a cherub. We're not told this specific kind of angel. But let's read Matthew 4:11. Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and ministered unto him. Not just one angel, but angels came to Jesus. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was hungry, right? How many Do you remember how many days he fasted? 40 days. Hungry, thirsty. He hungered all these things. Satan brings the three hardest attacks he could possibly bring on a hungry man. And even a man who's anointed with the Holy Ghost as the Holy One of Israel. He brings him the three hardest temptation. Lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, pride of life. Jesus overcomes every one of them. But there was virtue that went out of him in o in order to overcome. In other words, brother Chris, it took spiritual strength to overcome those temptations. See, church, that that's what we need to remember. In the moment of temptation, we have to call on God for strength. It takes strength. Let me say like this. We've all done it before. I'm sure we've all just given in to temptation without a fight. You don't have to say amen. You could just say ouch or something like that, right? Sometimes, church, we just give in without really putting up a fight. But that's not what Jesus taught us. Jesus taught us to fight with the word of God. As we preach on, we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Jesus taught us to get out the sword of the spirit and fight against the enemy and cast him down at all of his temptations. Now, think about this, church. Jesus withtood three of them. Sometimes we fall on the very first temptation because we're weak, right? We're human or we're not walking in the spirit. But I'll say like this, we can overcome Satan on the first one, but that might mean he come with a second temptation or even a third. If he left after three with Jesus, well, I think he would leave after three with us as well. But we got to be willing to fight and overcome. But I want you to see this. He fought with the word here. Hallelujah. And then after the trial, after he got the victory, after he overcame, God sent him angels to strengthen him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We saw that with Elijah. Remember a couple weeks ago, I preached on Elijah. We saw that with him. Hopefully you brothers able to live stream that one. But he was running for his life. He was suicidal. And he said said, "God, I'm I'm no better than my fathers. Take my life." And what did God do? God sent him an angel. Touch him. Get up and eat. Go back to sleep. Touch him again. Get up and eat again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, see, when you're discouraged and you feel like quitting and you feel like giving up, God's going to send you help because God is faithful to help his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which parent here if Lily needed help? Wouldn't don't you think Vang would do everything in his power to help out Lily? When my children need help, don't you think I do anything in my power to help them out? And if if that's how we feel naturally, how much more does God feel with a divine love? And then God promised, I'll never give you a temptation that you can't overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So after every major temptation, when you stand upon the word of God and you feel weak, God will send help. God will spend spiritual supplies from heaven. Hallelujah. Praise God. He'll send you an angel that can touch you and strengthen you. Hallelujah. And the last one, L, this is my last verse, then we'll do the Lord's supper. Luke 22. Well, we got to read our text, too. Luke uh 22:39. Luke 22:39. Here we see the Lord Jesus again getting visited by angels in the garden of Gethsemane. The Bible says and he he went I'm sorry he came out and went and as he was want to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him. And when he was at the place, he said unto them, "Pray that you enter not into temptations." Let's pause right there. Brothers or sisters, when we feel temptation, the best thing to do is pray. Pray. Jesus said, "Pray so you don't enter. You don't fall into that temptation." So before you go yell at somebody or before you go to have some pleasure, before you do any of those things, pray. And the Holy Spirit will help you to overcome those temptations. Hallelujah. Pray that you don't enter into that. You know, like I told you before, my mom before every day we go to school, went to public school, she would always make us gather around a circle and pray as teenage boys. That was hard. That was hard to do. I wasn't a believer. It was hard to humble myself. But I just had to respect my mama because she'd been healed of cancer. And of course, she was our uh she was the only one in in the in the house. I had to respect her. Okay. I always had that respect for her. But what was she doing? She was praying for us so we wouldn't enter into the same temptation that other people would at the high school. Hallelujah. Pray so you don't enter into it. Verse 41. And as he was was withdrawn from them about his stones cast, he kneel down and prayed. Church, when was the last time you knelt down and prayed? Hopefully this morning. Look at this. Jesus and church. How many know brother Ram said this is when he really got the victory of Calvary. This was the victory of Calvary right here. He had to get his mind willing to accept Calvary. This is what eventually caused him to overcome the cross was prayer. So the the holiest man like brother said the holiest man in the holiest place goes through the most hardest temptation. And how does he pray? He gets down on his knees and prays up to the father. Now, how many of us now think about church, how many of us are ashamed to get on our knees here at church? How many of us are ashamed to maybe jump and shout and praise the Lord in a church service? Look at Jesus. Was he ashamed to get on his knees? No. In his most sincere moment, he got on his knees. And the B the Bible said about a stones throw from his his other apostles. He got on his knees. So we see church the way you approach God even with your body it's important it sends a message to God. Hallelujah. The way you sit even today the way you stand or uh the way you respond it tells a message about your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Didn't didn't those quotes from brother aren't those true? When the angel of God comes you weep or you cry. You praise the Lord. Right? And yet we we can also fight against that. We don't want to fight against that. We want to yield to that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your soul is the throne of God and God visits his throne. Hallelujah. God dwells on the throne of our hearts. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, there's something about this. He gets on his knees. Hallelujah. And he gets down and prays saying, "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done." The greatest prayer that could be prayed, let God's will be done in my life, not my will, not what I want. Church, are we so selfish that we want our way? Or could we be so humble and accept God's way with our life? Let us not be selfish and have to have what we want in life. &gt;&gt; Let us be willing to accept when God communes with us, let us be willing to accept what God wants in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; What does God want in your life? He'll tell you on the throne of your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, especially the big ones are marriage, right? After salvation, second one is marriage. That's a real big one. So, I'm looking at my single friends here by God's grace. That you really must make sure you have the leading of God on that one. Hallelujah. So important to do the will of God, not your own will. Hallelujah. Verse 43. And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven. Hallelujah. Strengthening him. Hallelujah. Think about that, church. He was praying so sincerely, he was running out of strength. He was praying, "God, I don't want this to happen. God, I don't know why this has to happen." He was praying with so much strength that God has to send help to give him more strength. The Bible said he prayed three times this prayer. So he went back to God two more times. Lord, take this cup if it be possible. If not, then Lord, let me let me do it. Let let me do thy will, not my will. He needed strength to pray that church. Don't you know you need strength to obey God's word? You need strength from an angel to overcome temptation. Hallelujah. I don't know what you've been tempted with this week. I don't know. Or maybe this month. I don't know. But I know this. If you're praying and seeking God in the midst of your temptation and you feel weak, keep praying. God will send you strength to get you through that temptation. &gt;&gt; You don't have to fall. &gt;&gt; You don't have to give in. You don't have to be defeated. You can overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly. So he strengthened so he can pray more sincerely. and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. And it's not in here, it's in it's in Matthew, but the word uh the word about him in agony is the the deepest word for depression. So, brother Chris, Jesus knows what it's like to be depressed. If any man was ever depressed, it was the Lord Jesus right here in Gethsemane. So, nobody would be able to say on the day of pen or the day of judgment, well, I couldn't overcome depression. Jesus overcame depression, the oppression that he was to go and he knew he'd get his beard ripped out and uh slapped and spit on and the catine tails and beaten and nails through his hands and his feet. He knew all that was going to happen. Moses and Elijah came to talk to him about his decease. &gt;&gt; He knew what the scriptures said. Brother said he knew his place in the word of God. And so we got to know our place in the word of God. And this made him sweat drops of blood. The most agonizing sweat or of any type of a sweat or suffering. Our Lord Jesus went through it. But how did he do it? Through the power of an angel. Church, this tells me at your hardest time of life, God will dispatch angels to help you get through it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know if anyone else us would say, "Well, right now is the hardest test in my life." I don't know if anybody would say that right now. If it is, well, take courage. The angel of God will strengthen you. &gt;&gt; But surely, church, we can all look back a year ago or two, five, whatever it was your hardest moment in life. What got you through that? It was the anointing of God that came upon you to strengthen you to get through those difficult moments. Now, a lot of us are younger, so let me just say this. It's likely your hardest days are to come, right? It's likely, and I didn't get any amens on that, which is understandable. Listen, church, but the longer, if you're younger, the longer you live, there's more tests you're going to have to go through. So, I just pray that the Holy Spirit would bring this to our remembrance, church, when we need it. &gt;&gt; When we're wrestling with God, what I don't understand this, what is happening? What do you want me to do? What's your will for my life? I trust, church, by God's grace, he'll bring this back to us to remind us that when we're tested with the greatest test of our lives, we'll look to Christ. We'll look to heaven for help and we'll receive his help and pass the test. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Verse 45. And he rose up from his prayer and was come to his disciples. He found them sleeping for sorrow. He said them, "Why sleep ye? Rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation." And while he yet spake, behold, a multitude, he that was called Judas, one of the twel, went before him, and drew near unto Jesus, and kissed him. Now, this is my last thought here. I've always thought about this. Notice notice the contrast between the Garden of Eden and the Garden of Gethsemane. In the Garden of Eden, sin entered humanity through the serpent. Right? In the garden of Gethsemane, sin was confronted and overcome through prayer. Hallelujah. In another garden. Isn't that beautiful? Hallelujah. One garden they fell. One garden Jesus overcame. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Eden was paradise perverted. Gethsemane was a deep place of sorrow and prayer. Hallelujah. Amen. And that Gethsemane victory will bring us back to the garden. We'd say or the new Jerusalem, our future home, the heavenly city, the true paradise of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the Garden of Eden, man's will prevailed. In the garden of Gethsemane, God's will God's will prevailed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the garden of Eden, temptation overcame. Hallelujah. In the garden of Gethsemane, temptation was overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. In the Garden of Eden, death entered the world. Amen. In the Garden of Gethsemane, the remedy for sin began through Christ's prayer. Hallelujah. Amen. The garden of Eden was the presence of Adam. The garden of Gethsemane was the last Adam. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The garden of Eden was separation. Adam and Eve hid from God. Amen. In the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus came to God and was united to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the purpose of redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the Garden of Eden, there was blood because the blood had to be a sacrifice, right? And even we know in the act of of the serpent and Eve there was blood. But here in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus sweat blood in order to make a way for eternal life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The garden of Eden was a a a life that brought death. The garden of Gethsemane was eternal life through the sweat drops of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. In the garden of Eden, the curse began. Hallelujah. In the garden of Gethsemane, the curse was overcome and we become a blessing through the power of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The garden of Eden was the tree of death. The garden of Gethsemane was the tree of life, the Lord Jesus Christ. And I'll say like this, the mercy tree that followed the garden of Gethsemane, the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. The second Adam restores all that the first Adam lost. Romans 5:19, "For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." 1 Corinthians 15:22, "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." I hope somebody can say amen to that. Hallelujah. You're You live because Christ live, you shall live also. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because of Gethsemane. Hallelujah. Yes, &gt;&gt; because of what Jesus did in the garden to conquer sin and temptation and the curse and to become a curse that we might be blessed. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 15:45. And so it is written, "The first Adam was made a living soul. The last Adam was made a quickening spirit. And now that quickening spirit comes upon us." How many want that quickening spirit? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet by God's grace. Musicians can come as we prepare &gt;&gt; for the Lord's supper. The last Adam is made a quickening spirit. Hallelujah. Let's bow our hearts here as we approach the Lord. As we normally do at our church, so our sister Charlotte's aware, before communion, we do still take prayer requests. If anyone wants to come up for prayer, we still do that just in case there's special needs that people want lifted up. The Bible says the prayer of faith shall save the sick. call on the elders of the church, anoint the sick with oil, pray the prayer of faith, and God will raise them up. So, we want to be mindful of that before we start the Lord's supper today. Hallelujah. Lord, we thank you for the word of God today, Lord God. Thank you, Lord, for this. We'd say second garden, Lord God. Lord, you sent an angel to make sure, Lord God, that your son Jesus was able to overcome in his darkest hour, darkest trial. [Music] Because the Lord got the victory over the battle of the mind, he was able to bring his body into subjection, taking the body to the cross to die for us. Lord God, what an overcomer. Lord God, thank you for sending your son to overcome temptation. Lord God, Lord, I just felt your presence, Lord God, on that statement there about in our greatest trial, may we pray and remember that there is help to get us through our greatest battle on this earth. If you send it for Jesus, you'll send it to each one of us. For we are the heirs of salvation. We are the children of God by faith. Lord, I'd probably say the hardest thing in my life would be maybe the divorce of my parents, Lord God. Certainly the miscarriages my wife has had, Lord God. Those been very trying times. [Music] But Lord, if it be that the hardest moment is still in the future for me, Lord God, I pray this remembrance to me, Lord God, when I need it. That when I'm tested and tried, like Job said, I'll come forth as gold. I pray that for your people as well, Lord God. Lord, most of us are young here. If you Terry, Lord, if you Terry, many decades left. Tulsi is not even five months. Lord God, the average age of a worldwide is 73. Lord God, if you Terry, she would have about seven decades left of life. [Music] But Lord, in those decades, in our lives, Lord, we have great hours of trial, hours of testing. We've got our Garden of Gethsemane moment, Lord God. And I pray, Lord, in our greatest battles, Lord God, we would be able to say, Father, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but thy will be done. As I said, Lord, I don't know if the people are going through their hardest battle or not. Thou know us all things. You're faithful. You're watching over them. I pray if they are, Lord, I pray you'd ride the wings of a cherub today, Lord God. Come down and minister to your people. Deliver your people, Lord, in the midst of their trials, Lord God. Send your angel to minister strength, Lord God. strength so they can keep praying, keep worshiping as we said, be a king and priest unto God. That their heart would remain a throne unto God where your presence would dwell there and they would worship you. They'd pray to you, Lord God. They would praise your holy name for you are worthy. We thank you, Lord, for today. Thank you for the greater garden, the garden of Gethsemane. Lord God, thank you for these great works of restoration you did. For in Christ shall all believers be made alive. Thank you, God, for these promises. in Jesus Christ's name.
