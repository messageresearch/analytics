[38:29] amen my wife has a headache tonight
[38:31] that's why she's not here she had like
[38:32] the last three days the baby's been
[38:34] keeping her up all night you know
[38:35] teething so when she teethes she kicks
[38:37] all night and my wife can't sleep and so
[38:39] she has it wakes up with a headache and
[38:41] laid in bed most of the day today so we
[38:43] just pray for her if we can that God
[38:44] will give her grace um also there's a
[38:48] little girl at school I'm not going to

[49:44] everybody said amen amen praise God I
[49:46] take our Bibles tonight let's go to
[49:48] Colossians chapter one I like to
[49:49] continue on the Holy Ghost series here
[49:51] tonight amen I want to title this the
[49:54] foreshadow glory of the baptism of the
[49:57] Holy Ghost I want to preach on that
[49:58] tonight amen the foreshadowed glory of
[50:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost so let's
[50:02] go to Colossians chapter one verse
[50:06] 25 I said I'm G to kind of make it like
[50:08] more of like a Bible study little
[50:10] preaching you know I got the quote for
[50:11] everything I'm gonna say tonight by
[50:12] God's grace as far as I have planned God
[50:15] could do his own work there but uh
[50:18] that's my plan right now that's how I'm
[50:19] feeling LED I didn't plan on preaching
[50:21] this this morning it just kind of came
[50:23] to me this afternoon so I quickly wrote
[50:24] it down and and quickly studyed as quick
[50:27] as I can I had a whole different sermon
[50:28] I thought i' preach tonight I'm trusting
[50:30] it's the leading of the Lord amen
[50:32] Colossians 125
[50:37] 25 amen verse 25 wherefore I made a
[50:41] minister according to the dispensation
[50:43] of God which is given for me to you to
[50:45] fulfill the word of God even the mystery
[50:48] which have been hid from the ages and
[50:50] from Generations but now is made
[50:52] manifest to his Saints to whom God would
[50:56] make known what is the riches of the
[50:58] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[51:02] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[51:06] whom we preach warning every man and
[51:08] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[51:10] may present every man perfect in Christ
[51:13] Jesus where unto I also labor striving
[51:16] according to his working which worketh
[51:19] in me
[51:20] mightily the work of God works mightily
[51:22] in Paul I want to read one more
[51:24] scripture Gans
[51:27] 3:8 here's a scripture where we look at
[51:29] see where the Bible said the
[51:31] foreshadowing notice I use the word
[51:33] foreshadowing Bible uses the word
[51:36] forese doesn't actually use the word
[51:38] foreshadow I looked it up but it used
[51:39] the word forese let's read this together
[51:42] Galatians 3:8 let's begin on 3 1 2 3 and
[51:45] the scripture foreing that God would
[51:48] justify the Heathen through faith preach
[51:52] before the gospel unto Abraham saying in
[51:55] the shall All Nations be blessed may God
[51:58] has blessing reading his word may be
[52:00] SE so I'm taking I'm putting these two
[52:03] scriptures together like I said I want
[52:04] to preach on this is part six uh Lord
[52:07] willing uh this Sunday I want to preach
[52:08] again on the Holy Ghost keep laying this
[52:11] uh laying these truths in here and uh I
[52:14] believe it's going to do something for
[52:16] us amen I don't believe God's word ever
[52:18] Goes Forth in vain I always believe it
[52:20] has a purpose that it will accomplish
[52:21] praise God so I'm trusting that God will
[52:24] do great things here for us sometime
[52:26] soon with these sermons on the baptism
[52:28] of the Holy Ghost amen praise God uh so
[52:31] our first scripture showed that the
[52:32] preaching of the Holy Ghost was a
[52:34] mystery hidden from the ages and the
[52:36] Mystery was Christ in you the hope of
[52:39] glory so the whole Hope Of Heaven is
[52:41] that Christ could come in his children
[52:43] amen that is the hope of Heaven it's the
[52:45] hope of glory amen and then the Bible
[52:48] said in Galatians 38 that the scripture
[52:51] foresaw that God would justify the
[52:54] Heathen through through faith so let's
[52:56] look at this thought just briefly the
[52:58] scripture foretold in Hosea and Isaiah
[53:01] and Genesis different places that God
[53:03] was gonna forgive the Heathen and he
[53:05] would bring all the Heathen into his
[53:07] name and into his fold and so forth so
[53:10] if if the scripture foretold God would
[53:13] justify the Heathen then don't you think
[53:15] the scripture foretold he would sanctify
[53:16] the Heathen and then don't you think the
[53:18] scripture for told that he filled the
[53:20] Heathen with the Holy Ghost amen praise
[53:23] God one of the most obvious
[53:25] ones uh that we can clearly see uh would
[53:29] would be in Ezekiel 20 or 36 let's go to
[53:32] Ezekiel 36 like I said I wanted to go to
[53:34] the scripture and uh kind of stay in
[53:38] there by the grace of the
[53:40] Lord Ezekiel
[53:44] 3626 26 and 27 a new heart also will I
[53:48] give you and a new spirit will I put
[53:50] within you I will take away the Stony
[53:53] heart out of your flesh and I will give
[53:55] you in heart of Flesh and I will put my
[53:58] spirit within you and cause you to walk
[54:01] in my statutes and you shall keep my
[54:03] judgments and do them praise God now
[54:06] here's a beautiful foreshadowing of the
[54:09] three works of Grace how many know those
[54:10] three works of Grace justification is
[54:12] the new heart sanctification is a new
[54:16] spirit sanctifies the spirit your habits
[54:18] your thinking your thoughts and then my
[54:21] spirit or God's spirit is the third work
[54:23] of Grace so he gives you a new heart
[54:26] then a new spirit then he gives you his
[54:28] Spirit but notice what the new spirit
[54:30] does it causes you to keep the
[54:33] Commandments we can't keep the
[54:35] Commandments of God without the baptism
[54:36] of the Holy Ghost you'll fall short
[54:38] every time you need the baptism of the
[54:41] Holy Ghost that causes you uh to keep
[54:44] the Commandments it guides you uh uh the
[54:46] Bible said it's the spirit of Truth
[54:48] praise God uh it's the guide It's the
[54:51] comforter praise God Amen it's the
[54:53] advocate inside of you the lawyer inside
[54:55] of you and he's trying to persuade you
[54:57] to obey the word amen if you're obedient
[54:59] child you will praise to God because
[55:01] he's The Advocate he's a lawyer there uh
[55:03] sharing the scripture with you amen now
[55:06] I want to go now if I can that's just a
[55:09] simple one that's a real simple one and
[55:11] we'll get to it later in Jeremiah where
[55:12] it says the same thing God was done he
[55:15] was tired of writing the word on tables
[55:16] of stone he wanted to write the word on
[55:18] fleshly tables of the heart amen we'll
[55:21] get to that one eventually but the first
[55:23] one I got nine of them I want to go
[55:24] through the night so should go kind of
[55:25] fast nine of them so I need some readers
[55:27] here by God's grace but I want to show
[55:29] you all these types and these are just
[55:30] the ones that came to me in the last few
[55:31] hours that before we got here by God's
[55:34] grace so uh let's go if we again first
[55:37] of all let's go to acts
[55:39] 15 acts five and Mark 18 so Malachi
[55:43] acts 15 and brother Benjamin can you get
[55:47] Mark 18 brother is that okay thank you
[55:49] sir so acts 15 and then Mark 18 let's
[55:52] just read these here by the grace of God
[55:56] okay so Malachi when you're ready acts
[55:57] 15 for John the baptized water shall be
[56:01] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[56:03] days amen are those red letter words on
[56:05] your Bible Mali praise God who's saying
[56:08] that the Lord Jesus so I want to see the
[56:10] foreshadowing of the glory so this is
[56:13] called a baptism what do baptism mean it
[56:15] means an immersion so picture somebody
[56:17] at a dunking tank and they know the ball
[56:20] hits the tank and they fall down they're
[56:21] immersed in water or you do a cannon
[56:24] ball if you're off your diving board
[56:26] you're totally when you go under you're
[56:28] totally immersed underwater and that's
[56:30] what Jesus said it's like now not
[56:32] silliness like those kind of things but
[56:33] it's a spiritual immersion of your soul
[56:37] and the Holy Ghost is covering your soul
[56:39] amen I'll say like that it's covering
[56:41] your soul brother Benjamin Mark 18
[56:45] sir I indeed have baptized you with
[56:47] water but he said bze you with the Holy
[56:50] Ghost amen thank you sir so John the
[56:53] Baptist for told it he said I'm just put
[56:54] putting you in natural water like we
[56:56] talked about the dunk tank and and and
[56:58] and so for like that he just I'm just
[57:00] this is it's good it's right it's good
[57:02] to be baptized but he's going to baptize
[57:04] you in a different way amen it's going
[57:07] to be a spiritual immersion in the Holy
[57:09] Ghost your soul is going to be immersed
[57:12] in the Holy Ghost amen so it's going to
[57:14] be protecting you and that's why brother
[57:16] Bram said Satan can't get in he said
[57:18] that he can't make you sin he said you
[57:21] got to go out so you got to stop
[57:22] operating and deciding from the soul and
[57:24] you got to go out to the human Spirit or
[57:26] the Flesh in order to sin he said
[57:27] because Satan can't get into your soul
[57:29] because it's sealed by the Holy Spirit I
[57:31] will get to that eventually but it gives
[57:32] you the idea the immersion is totally
[57:34] immersed in the love of God in the
[57:36] spirit of God now go to 2 Kings 5 verse
[57:39] 9 you know the story but we're just
[57:41] going to hit it here's a beautiful type
[57:43] and I'll read the quote when we get
[57:44] there uh brother BR reads this
[57:46] quote 2 Kings
[57:48] 5 so the the the glor the foreshadowing
[57:52] of the Holy Ghost the glory of it is
[57:54] right here in 2 Kings chapter 5 it's
[57:57] also in chapter 4 which we read last
[57:58] Wednesday night but here's the glory now
[58:01] you know the story non uh uh the the
[58:04] ruler here he needs a healing he's C
[58:06] he's getting covered in leprosy leprosy
[58:08] always represents sin and Le and leprosy
[58:10] is an incurable disease right except for
[58:13] Christ amen right so let's go to verse
[58:16] uh nine so non came with his horses and
[58:19] with his chair and stood at the door of
[58:21] the House of Elisha and Elisha sent a
[58:23] messenger on him saying go and wash in
[58:25] the Jordan seven times now look the
[58:26] prophet wouldn't even look at him face
[58:28] to face why because he's a gentile he's
[58:30] a he's a Jew right so now that he could
[58:34] have taken that as a dis Act of
[58:37] disrespect he could have but look that
[58:39] was God's provided
[58:41] way now he says go and wash in the
[58:43] Jordan seven times in verse 10 and thy
[58:45] flesh shall come again to thee and thou
[58:47] shalt be clean but non was WTH so the
[58:50] prophet's instructions made him upset
[58:53] and went away and said behold I thought
[58:55] he will surely come out to me and stand
[58:57] and call on the name of the Lord is God
[58:59] and strike his hand over the place and
[59:01] recover the leper now look what he
[59:03] thought he had this all worked out this
[59:05] some of you planners some of you taipe
[59:07] people that like to plan everything out
[59:09] he had this in his mind okay I'm GNA go
[59:11] to the prophet's house the prophet's
[59:12] gonna walk out and say thus sayi the
[59:14] Lord let the power of Heaven come down
[59:16] and heal him in God's name in the name
[59:18] of Jehovah right Jehovah Gyra and but
[59:22] because it didn't come the way he wanted
[59:24] he got upset and we got to be careful
[59:27] that we don't get upset with God if it
[59:29] don't come the way we want it to come
[59:30] amen praise God he said I thought see
[59:33] how our thinking our planning sometimes
[59:35] gets in God's way sometimes God does use
[59:38] us to plan like Solomon planned out a
[59:40] temple took seven years to build that's
[59:41] good planning that was Holy Ghost
[59:43] planning praise God but here this was
[59:45] the wrong planning he thought well it's
[59:47] got to happen this way and God said I'm
[59:49] not doing it your way you need to Humble
[59:50] Yourself Praise Goden all right now
[59:53] verse 12 are not abana and farar rivers
[59:57] of Damascus better than all the Waters
[59:59] of Israel they not washing them and be
[1:00:01] clean so he turned and went away in a
[1:00:03] rage can you imagine the word of God
[1:00:05] making somebody so upset that they won't
[1:00:07] turn away and say that that Prophet I
[1:00:09] can't believe he said that to me who
[1:00:11] knows what he said I'm not gonna say
[1:00:13] anything who knows what he said but it
[1:00:15] caused him the word of God the
[1:00:17] directions for for the healing of
[1:00:19] leprosy made him so upset he turned and
[1:00:21] let the church as fast as he could verse
[1:00:24] 13 and his servants came near and spake
[1:00:26] unto him and said my father if the
[1:00:28] prophet had bid thee to do some great
[1:00:29] thing wouldest thou not have done it how
[1:00:31] much rather than when he said to thee
[1:00:33] wash should be clean so look he needed
[1:00:36] somebody to come by and help him
[1:00:37] sometimes church if you see somebody
[1:00:39] that's not right with God sometimes
[1:00:41] you're the one supposed to go try to
[1:00:42] correct them amen praise God Amen these
[1:00:45] are lower these are servants these are
[1:00:47] not great men are you with me Church
[1:00:49] Great Men amongst us or great women
[1:00:51] amongst us even the humble even the
[1:00:54] humblest can correct that we those we
[1:00:56] might call Great praise the Lord and the
[1:00:59] humble ones come up and say well he
[1:01:01] didn't ask you to do something great
[1:01:03] he's asking you to do something humble
[1:01:05] and it starts convicting him look at the
[1:01:07] power of humility amen look at the power
[1:01:10] of Correction it can bring some some
[1:01:12] upset rage rage filled anger-filled
[1:01:15] person down to humility and obedience
[1:01:17] just by a word of
[1:01:19] Correction a word of Holy Ghost wisdom
[1:01:22] by verse 14 look look Humes himself then
[1:01:25] he went down and dipped himself seven
[1:01:27] times in the Jordan according to the
[1:01:28] saying to the man of God and his flesh
[1:01:30] came again like unto the Flesh of a
[1:01:32] little child and he was clean and he
[1:01:34] returned to the man of God and all his
[1:01:36] company and came and stood before him
[1:01:38] and he said behold now I know that there
[1:01:39] is no God in all the Earth but in Israel
[1:01:42] now therefore I pray thee take a
[1:01:44] blessing of thy servant and you know the
[1:01:46] story he wouldn't take one and the
[1:01:47] servant takes one he gets me with Le
[1:01:49] leprosy okay now let me read you this
[1:01:52] quote here brother B says in
[1:01:53] perseverance 19
[1:01:55] 63 he said now people the way they want
[1:01:57] to get this or get healed and get the
[1:02:00] Holy Spirit the way they think they
[1:02:02] ought to have it then now I'll come down
[1:02:04] brother if you'll bring me up and take
[1:02:06] me into a room where nobody can see me
[1:02:08] lay your hands upon me and bless me and
[1:02:10] put the holy ghost on me and I'll accept
[1:02:11] it he saids oh no see people come to
[1:02:13] church and they want they want to get
[1:02:15] the Holy Ghost they want to be baptized
[1:02:16] the way they want to be baptized or they
[1:02:18] want to speak in tongues or they want to
[1:02:19] do this the way they want to do it but
[1:02:21] it doesn't come your way it comes God's
[1:02:24] way
[1:02:24] yes amen but said non now look he types
[1:02:28] his holy ghost to non he said non wanted
[1:02:31] to accept his healing like that one time
[1:02:33] but Elisha told him to go out there in
[1:02:34] the old mudy Jordan and dip seven times
[1:02:37] I can see him get out of his Chariot oh
[1:02:40] a great man hold his nose here he comes
[1:02:42] out of the water tiptoeing like a cat in
[1:02:45] molasses coming out you know getting out
[1:02:48] down the water he said oh I hate to do
[1:02:50] this hot down down he says some people
[1:02:53] comes to the altar like it's a sickening
[1:02:55] Affair to them yeah I don't want to do
[1:02:57] that now look he says name went down
[1:02:59] there like this tiptoeing can you
[1:03:00] imagine a tiptoeing to Ser man great man
[1:03:03] I don't want to get the stinky water it
[1:03:05] was dirty water it was filthy water but
[1:03:08] God said go the humble way go the way of
[1:03:11] humility humble yourself go my provided
[1:03:14] way am but he did it anyway so I say
[1:03:17] brother lik that to the altar people
[1:03:19] don't want to come to the Altar and pray
[1:03:22] amen hallelujah he sees drawing a tight
[1:03:25] this was a foreshadowing of the baptism
[1:03:28] of the Holy Ghost amen he says it on he
[1:03:31] goes on
[1:03:32] again he says it this next in the
[1:03:35] cruelity of sin
[1:03:37] 1953 he said now you mean to say brother
[1:03:40] Ram you mean I have to get down there
[1:03:42] and get filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:44] carry on like the rest of them he said
[1:03:46] if you expect to be with the rest of
[1:03:48] them you do that's all glory he said non
[1:03:51] had the same thing God told the prophet
[1:03:53] tell him go go down there and dip seven
[1:03:55] times he said isn't this water cleaner
[1:03:57] and better but it was it but it was that
[1:04:00] water of Jordan it looks pretty bad
[1:04:03] sometimes amen doesn't look pretty bad
[1:04:05] to get down here and cry and snot uh and
[1:04:08] have you know tear stains on your shirt
[1:04:11] praise the Lord and snotting and blowing
[1:04:13] your nose doesn't that look pretty awful
[1:04:15] sometimes it doesn't look as dignified
[1:04:17] as when they go to the the priests in
[1:04:18] the denominations and and they all bow
[1:04:20] and they all shake hands and they
[1:04:22] they're all dressed beautifully and it's
[1:04:23] all routine and all this not we'd say
[1:04:25] false religion and traditions of men it
[1:04:28] looks dirty but it's God's provided way
[1:04:30] Amen brother said this is a type of the
[1:04:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of
[1:04:35] the Holy Ghost is the only thing that
[1:04:37] cures the incurable sin disease amen
[1:04:41] glory are you with me church so Jesus
[1:04:43] said it' be a baptism so here's a
[1:04:45] baptism in the Old Testament
[1:04:47] foreshadowing the glory of the baptism
[1:04:50] to come oh glory amen amen hallelujah
[1:04:54] brother R said so you you see that by
[1:04:55] God's grace this is a foreshadowing
[1:04:58] taking away all all trace of sin all
[1:05:01] trace of leprosy that incurable flesh
[1:05:04] eating disease we'd say of sin that just
[1:05:07] eats and consumes you amen now stay
[1:05:11] there in your Bibles uh but go to the
[1:05:13] previous chapter 2 Kings 4 we read this
[1:05:15] last Wednesday night oh this was a
[1:05:17] wonderful time in the Lord oh my last
[1:05:19] Wednesday night amen ah now keep your
[1:05:23] spot there but um brother Austin can you
[1:05:26] read acts 2:4 for us brother Austin acts
[1:05:29] 2:4 and everybody else will stay in 2
[1:05:31] Kings 4 unless you you like flipping or
[1:05:32] you you know you got bookmarks or your
[1:05:34] hands want to hold those now let's look
[1:05:36] at the second the first foreshadowing
[1:05:37] was immersion or baptism of the Holy
[1:05:39] Ghost that was the first foreshadowing
[1:05:41] the second is filling and I got nine of
[1:05:43] them I'll try to get to them tonight
[1:05:45] okay brother Austin acts
[1:05:46] 2:4 and there were all filled with the
[1:05:48] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:05:50] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:05:52] utterance amen let's say praise the Lord
[1:05:54] praise the Lord amen now thank you
[1:05:56] brother Second Kings
[1:05:57] 4 verse 5 this remember this is last
[1:06:01] Wednesday night remember these beautiful
[1:06:02] types I was just so abused by this so
[1:06:05] she went from him and shut the door upon
[1:06:07] her and upon her sons who brought the
[1:06:09] vessels to her and she poured out so she
[1:06:12] pours out now this one vessel that she
[1:06:14] poured out of that type Christ praise
[1:06:17] God because one vessel was pouring into
[1:06:20] many empty vessels amen hallelujah and
[1:06:24] brother man said all that God was he
[1:06:26] poured into Christ and all Christ was he
[1:06:28] poured into who the church Hallelujah so
[1:06:32] we all get holy ghost power from one
[1:06:35] vessel from Jesus Christ amen the life
[1:06:38] in him is divided and sent down into
[1:06:41] many empty vessels glory amen verse six
[1:06:44] and it came to pass when the vessels
[1:06:46] were full that she said unto her son
[1:06:47] bring me at a vessel he said there is
[1:06:49] not a vessel more in the oil State then
[1:06:52] she came and told the man of God and and
[1:06:54] he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt
[1:06:56] and live thou thy Children of the rest
[1:06:59] so this was a one vessel this one vessel
[1:07:01] was a pouring out and a filling and it
[1:07:03] was an inexhaustible Fountain we'll say
[1:07:06] like that an inexhaustible source of oil
[1:07:09] and that's Jesus Christ amen and he said
[1:07:11] I will baptize you with the Holy Ghost I
[1:07:13] will fill you with the Holy Ghost I'll
[1:07:16] do it amen praise God now let's look at
[1:07:19] another good one Genesis 26 I've never
[1:07:21] preached this in my life so here's the
[1:07:22] first time I've ever preached this 10
[1:07:24] years or 12 years of preaching 10 years
[1:07:26] of pastoring uh so I'm excited to preach
[1:07:28] it that's why I said that because I'm
[1:07:29] excited maybe you're not but I I am I
[1:07:32] God's grace because I never preaches
[1:07:34] amen glory I got the joy of the Lord
[1:07:36] amen Genesis 26 verse1 17 beautiful type
[1:07:40] here look at this beautiful
[1:07:41] type Isaac was uh working
[1:07:45] here and in order to be filled up he had
[1:07:48] to dig a little bit praise God he had to
[1:07:50] empty out empty out a little hole before
[1:07:52] he could get filled up how many believe
[1:07:54] that by God's grace amen Genesis
[1:07:57] 26 uh 17 2617 that's
[1:08:02] it now look this is uh Isaac here and
[1:08:07] Isaac departed then and pitches T the
[1:08:09] valley of gerar and dwelt there and
[1:08:12] Isaac digged again the wells of his
[1:08:13] father which they had digged in the days
[1:08:16] of Abraham his father for the
[1:08:18] Philistines had stopped them after the
[1:08:21] death of Abraham and he called their
[1:08:23] names after the names of them by which
[1:08:25] his father had called them now look at
[1:08:27] this Isaac comes back to the place where
[1:08:29] his father worshiped praise God but
[1:08:32] because his father was gone on there was
[1:08:35] no more Ministry for the water to flow
[1:08:38] Oh Glory Hallelujah the old the old
[1:08:41] Ministry had passed on right just time
[1:08:43] and years and and and enemies had come
[1:08:46] up and and Men of God and risen and fall
[1:08:49] so the ministry of water was not flowing
[1:08:52] in this area anymore but Isaac
[1:08:54] recognized if we just dig out these
[1:08:57] Wells again if we revive the wells of
[1:09:00] our fathers amen if we dig out and if we
[1:09:04] live and do the same works of our
[1:09:06] fathers we'll get the same results amen
[1:09:08] we'll get the same Waters if we do the
[1:09:10] same digging praise Goden in other words
[1:09:13] I will restore sayith the Lord amen I'll
[1:09:16] restore all the Waters of your fathers
[1:09:18] amen he said I'll restore the faith of
[1:09:20] the fathers amen hallelujah it's exactly
[1:09:23] right and he called them the very same
[1:09:25] names that his dad called them amen
[1:09:28] hallelujah and these three whs represent
[1:09:30] the three works of
[1:09:32] Grace hallelujah amen that's that's my
[1:09:35] my revelation of it I'll say like that
[1:09:38] look at verse 19 and Isaac's servants
[1:09:40] died in the valley actually brother said
[1:09:41] the same thing sorry and found their
[1:09:44] well springing water and the Herdman of
[1:09:46] guer did strive with Isaac's Herman
[1:09:48] saying this water is ours and he called
[1:09:50] the name of the well esac because they
[1:09:52] stroll with him now notice Isaac does
[1:09:54] the work it's a work of Isaac uh but
[1:09:58] then and and springing waters are coming
[1:10:00] up but he doesn't they don't last very
[1:10:02] long so Isaac works this is the first
[1:10:05] work of Isaac and the church said amen
[1:10:08] so this is justification it brings uh
[1:10:11] Sweet Waters for a while but then Strife
[1:10:14] uh Strife comes and takes it away so
[1:10:17] he's got to go so this justification
[1:10:19] just lasts a little a little while and
[1:10:21] then he's got to move on to another work
[1:10:24] this is beautiful amen amen that work
[1:10:26] only lasts so long that he's got to move
[1:10:28] on to another work praise God isn't that
[1:10:31] what happens you get Justified get on
[1:10:32] fire with God and what turns off that
[1:10:34] fire a little Strife amen praise God
[1:10:38] Jesus said so he said there's four
[1:10:39] reactions when seeds fall on grounds
[1:10:42] amen the first one is that falls on the
[1:10:43] Wayside Satan snatches away the second
[1:10:46] one is persecution Strife amen you're
[1:10:49] persecuted because you receive the word
[1:10:51] you rejoice at first but then
[1:10:53] persecution comes and uh and there's no
[1:10:56] there's no root in the seeds amen so
[1:10:58] this shows what happens you've got to
[1:11:00] move on to the next work and church if
[1:11:02] if your Waters get stopped off move on
[1:11:04] to the next work praise God dig again
[1:11:06] praise God go back to where the fathers
[1:11:09] uh had faith and and virtue and powers
[1:11:12] and holy spirit blessings we need to go
[1:11:14] back to the old past I'm convinced the
[1:11:16] Holy Ghost will fall here when we get
[1:11:17] serious and start praying with God I'm
[1:11:20] not saying he hasn't fallen in special
[1:11:21] ways he has fallen in special ways I'm
[1:11:23] talking about those who want the Holy
[1:11:25] Ghost and if we want to see a real book
[1:11:26] of Acts a more book of Acts Movement by
[1:11:28] God's grace it'll happen when we start
[1:11:30] praying and digging out all this dirt
[1:11:32] out of our Lives amen praise God and
[1:11:36] getting serious with God hallelujah now
[1:11:38] verse 21 and they dig another well so
[1:11:40] now he's got to work again he had one
[1:11:42] wasn't one work enough no sir amen one
[1:11:44] work wasn't enough he's got to do a
[1:11:46] second work hallelujah amen and they dig
[1:11:51] another well and strove for that also
[1:11:54] and he called the name of it
[1:11:56] sitna verse 22 and he removed from then
[1:11:59] and died another well so the second well
[1:12:02] the second work was not enough he needs
[1:12:04] a third work of Grace amen hallelujah so
[1:12:08] he goes to the third and for that they
[1:12:10] strove not and he called the name of it
[1:12:12] riobo and he said for now the Lord has
[1:12:15] made room for us and we shall be
[1:12:17] fruitful in the land you see you can't
[1:12:20] bear the fruits of the Holy Ghost until
[1:12:21] you're born again of the Holy Ghost am
[1:12:24] amen that's exactly right and look
[1:12:26] there's no more striving after you're
[1:12:28] born again there's no more striving you
[1:12:30] because you love everybody Oh Glory
[1:12:33] Hallelujah You' got charity charity is
[1:12:35] the Holy Ghost in 1 Corinthians 13 right
[1:12:37] and charity hope withth all things
[1:12:39] believeth all things envieth not seeketh
[1:12:42] not her own praise God Amen it's time we
[1:12:46] must read it must be time we read that
[1:12:48] again sometime soon that's what the real
[1:12:50] Holy Ghost does there's no more striving
[1:12:51] no more fighting against flesh no more
[1:12:53] fighting against that you're now praying
[1:12:55] you're praying for your enemies you're
[1:12:57] loving people in the church if they
[1:12:58] don't love you you love them back anyway
[1:13:01] if you don't feel loved don't don't feel
[1:13:03] bad or isolated I found a scripture
[1:13:05] recently where Paul said he said the
[1:13:06] more I love the people the less they
[1:13:08] love me Glory it's in 1 Corinthians 16
[1:13:12] he said the more I love them the less
[1:13:14] they love me and is that what brother
[1:13:17] brand the more he loved the people the
[1:13:18] more he was rejected right the more
[1:13:20] Jesus loved people and did Miracles then
[1:13:22] he preached the unless he was loved as
[1:13:24] well don't feel discouraged if you feel
[1:13:26] lonely or nobody loves me just get in
[1:13:28] God's presence you'll feel love and then
[1:13:30] he'll give you some human love pretty
[1:13:32] soon by God's grace some Christian love
[1:13:34] but don't that's how it always is
[1:13:36] brother Adam said God told him to walk
[1:13:38] with me you'll walk what
[1:13:41] alone so the more you love people guess
[1:13:44] what sometimes the more you've got to
[1:13:46] deal with not being loved uhuh amen
[1:13:48] praise God that's the scripture right
[1:13:51] there and it's always that it's always
[1:13:52] the end right right as you go on things
[1:13:54] get harder harder but we still stay in
[1:13:56] God's grace and there's room for all of
[1:13:58] us at the third well praise God there's
[1:14:00] room for everybody at the holy ghost's
[1:14:02] well amen here's where brother Bram says
[1:14:04] it now brother Braham calls this Jacob's
[1:14:07] well but it's actually Isaac's well okay
[1:14:09] so bam says this in 1959 what you went
[1:14:11] out to see he said you know Jacob dug a
[1:14:13] wh and the Philistines run away from it
[1:14:15] and called it malice he dug another well
[1:14:17] the Philistines run away from it so they
[1:14:19] call it stride he dug another well the
[1:14:21] third well he said there's room for us
[1:14:22] all brother said God dug a well in the
[1:14:25] Lutheran
[1:14:27] church and they all run the rest away
[1:14:29] from them but the Lutheran he dug a well
[1:14:32] at the Methodist Church for
[1:14:33] sanctification Luther was justification
[1:14:36] sanctification he dug a well and now
[1:14:38] they run all the way from it but now
[1:14:40] he's dug another well it ain't no names
[1:14:42] there's no more denomination it's just a
[1:14:45] pure Holy Ghost and there's room for us
[1:14:47] all amen hallelujah amen three works of
[1:14:51] Grace it takes three works three dying
[1:14:54] to yourself in order to have a well that
[1:14:57] there's room for us all Hallelujah to
[1:14:59] have Love At The Well of God where
[1:15:02] there's no Strife or malice but now I
[1:15:04] got love for even my enemies amen glory
[1:15:08] all right number three it's a fallen
[1:15:10] Malachi acts 8:16 please Malachi acts
[1:15:12] 8:16 the holy ghost is now a
[1:15:15] fallen a
[1:15:17] fire a falling of
[1:15:20] fire don't you love these foreshadowings
[1:15:22] of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:24] the foreshadow glory of the baptism of
[1:15:26] the Holy Ghost
[1:15:29] immersion filling praise God Amen so
[1:15:32] once Isaac dug it out what happened he's
[1:15:33] caught well and it filled up that hole
[1:15:36] it's a filling of the Holy Ghost how
[1:15:37] many believe that by God's grace
[1:15:39] immersion filling and now it's a falling
[1:15:42] of fire amen acts 8:16 okay as upon none
[1:15:49] of them only they baptised in the name
[1:15:51] of the Lord Jesus amen remember at
[1:15:54] remember in the Samaritan he hadn't
[1:15:55] fallen on them yet so it's a falling
[1:15:57] from
[1:15:58] Heaven these are all foreshadows of what
[1:16:01] it feels like now when you're born again
[1:16:03] you can relate with these by God's grace
[1:16:04] because you you've had the Holy Ghost
[1:16:06] fall on you you feel like your Soul's
[1:16:07] been immersed you feel like you're all
[1:16:09] filled up of God's spirit amen that's
[1:16:11] right these are all the foreshadowed
[1:16:13] glory this is the glory so when you read
[1:16:15] the Old Testament you can relate and say
[1:16:17] my I know what it's like to be like non
[1:16:19] to go down there and keep keep dipping
[1:16:21] keep immersing until I come and I've
[1:16:23] obeyed all the word of God and now my
[1:16:25] sin trouble's gone amen hallelujah
[1:16:28] there's no more unbelief in my soul my
[1:16:30] soul is immersed in the Holy Ghost

[1:16:35] of God Amen all right now another one 2
[1:16:39] Chronicles 7 let's go there 2 Chronicles
[1:16:42] 7 brother amen can you get this one 2
[1:16:44] Chronicles
[1:16:48] 71-4 2 Chronicles 71-4 now this also
[1:16:52] happened in Moses is day uh but we'll
[1:16:54] have we'll have this read about Solomon
[1:16:56] here so whenever you're ready brother
[1:16:57] amen now when Solomon had made an end of
[1:17:00] praying fire came down from heaven and
[1:17:03] consumed the burnt offering and the
[1:17:04] sacrifices and the glory of the Lord
[1:17:06] filled the house and the priest could
[1:17:09] not entered into the house because the
[1:17:10] glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's
[1:17:12] House and when the children of Israel
[1:17:14] saw the how the fire came down and the
[1:17:16] glory of the Lord upon the house they
[1:17:18] bowed themselves with their faces on the
[1:17:20] ground upon the pavement and worshiped
[1:17:23] praise the Lord saying for he is good
[1:17:25] and his mercy endureth amen thank you
[1:17:27] sir so remember Solomon built it for
[1:17:30] seven years remember he had Timbers
[1:17:32] dedicated to him he had all these Stones
[1:17:34] sent to him and there was not one sound
[1:17:36] of a buzz or a saw or anything like that
[1:17:37] remember it was all God chosen stones
[1:17:40] and God took all these chosen stones and
[1:17:43] brought them together and they fit
[1:17:44] perfectly like a puzzle into a temple
[1:17:46] amen and the Bible said we're fitly
[1:17:48] joined together as Lively Stones amen
[1:17:51] each one of those stones from different
[1:17:53] places from the north east south and
[1:17:55] west was like all the bride members
[1:17:56] coming into the body of Jesus Christ and
[1:17:59] when that's finished then the fire falls
[1:18:01] that's the Rapture amen hallelujah then
[1:18:03] the fire falls and the body is filled
[1:18:06] with the power of God and you watch the
[1:18:08] church then amen it's called the third
[1:18:10] pole it's called the latter rain
[1:18:11] Hallelujah but it's all got to be placed
[1:18:14] together each person has to be in the
[1:18:16] body of Christ a part of the temple and

[1:18:31] people may the Holy Ghost fill this
[1:18:33] place now with a burning fire and the
[1:18:36] smoke of the holy spirit that come in
[1:18:38] the temple when Solomon dedicated and
[1:18:41] may the power of God surge through the
[1:18:43] people amen church we got to come to we
[1:18:46] got to come to church wanting this to
[1:18:48] happen that the fire of God would come
[1:18:50] down and surge through the place amen
[1:18:53] that we can pray that I can invite a
[1:18:54] brother to pray whoever the brother is
[1:18:56] and he'll pray that in his heart say God
[1:18:58] send the Holy Ghost like a fire like you
[1:19:00] did in Solomon's day amen where nobody
[1:19:03] can Minister nobody can preach it's all
[1:19:05] G to be praised with our faces down on
[1:19:07] the ground or our hands raised up or
[1:19:09] tears or so or worship words sacrifice
[1:19:13] of praise words where God gets all the
[1:19:15] glory
[1:19:16] amen number three Firefall praise God
[1:19:20] immersion filling the falling of Fire
[1:19:22] fire upon the people foreshadowed in the
[1:19:25] Old Testament amen the next one's a
[1:19:27] pouring out so let's go to this one acts
[1:19:31] 10:45 acts
[1:19:33] 10:45 brother Austin I'm sorry brother
[1:19:35] uh yeah Benjamin get acts 10:45 and then
[1:19:38] brother Austin um 1st Samuel 16:13 can
[1:19:41] you get that one 1st Samuel 16:13 and
[1:19:44] then brother Benjamin when you're ready
[1:19:45] uh acts 10:45 and they of the
[1:19:47] circumcision which believe were
[1:19:49] astonished as many as came with Peter
[1:19:51] because that on the G Gentiles also was
[1:19:53] poured out of the gift of the only G
[1:19:55] amen praise God the pouring out so the
[1:19:58] Bible calls it a pouring out Hallelujah
[1:20:00] that's kind of we looked at like a
[1:20:01] shower remember we looked at the shower
[1:20:03] on Sunday uh by God's grace but this is
[1:20:06] a pouring out now I'm going to use this
[1:20:09] now tonight for pouring out of oil okay
[1:20:12] uh so brother Austin 1st Samuel
[1:20:16] 16:13 then Samuel took the Horn of oil
[1:20:19] and anointed him in the midst of his
[1:20:21] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[1:20:23] Upon David from that day forward so
[1:20:25] Samuel rose up and went to amen so David
[1:20:29] gets down there right we always see the
[1:20:30] picture in our Bibles where he's kneel
[1:20:31] down there and Samuel's got a horn of
[1:20:33] Rams Horn of oil and he pours it out
[1:20:35] over David and the Bible said the spirit
[1:20:37] of the Lord came on him at that moment
[1:20:39] amen at the pouring out right and that's
[1:20:42] what Acts chapter 10 says he was poured
[1:20:45] out from Heaven upon Cornelius in Acts
[1:20:47] chapter 10 how many believe that's the
[1:20:48] Bible amen now this is also spoken of
[1:20:52] again in Psalms 22:22 so Malachi can you
[1:20:55] read psalms 22:22 and brother amen can
[1:20:57] you get Hebrews
[1:20:59] 2:12 this is again type now this is all
[1:21:01] through the Bible the pouring out of the
[1:21:03] oil in the midst of the Brethren so
[1:21:05] remember David was surrounded by his
[1:21:07] brothers right he had seven other
[1:21:08] brothers and there he is the eighth son
[1:21:10] and he's getting the oil poured upon him
[1:21:13] and eight represents eternity so there's
[1:21:14] Christ the Eternal son amen hallelujah
[1:21:17] amen and as baptism the Dove came down
[1:21:21] amen hallelujah he got born again
[1:21:23] Hallelujah so Malachi Psalms
[1:21:28] 22:22 I will declare thy name unto my
[1:21:31] brethren in the midst of the
[1:21:33] congregation will I praise thee amen so
[1:21:35] see once he got anointed he could
[1:21:37] declare God's name unto his Brethren
[1:21:39] he's amongst his Brethren but he had to
[1:21:41] get anointed in in order to declare the
[1:21:43] name of God Church do our lives declare
[1:21:45] the name of Jesus Christ praise God it
[1:21:48] ought to David's did David got anointed
[1:21:51] and he declared God's name he went to
[1:21:53] Goliath what not in his name but in the
[1:21:55] name of Jehovah amen the name of
[1:21:57] almighty God our lives should declare
[1:21:59] the name of Jesus Christ to our
[1:22:01] co-workers our family our friends our
[1:22:03] mothers our fathers right everyone we
[1:22:05] come in contact to our our our life of
[1:22:08] God in us should declare the name of
[1:22:10] Jesus Christen amen okay uh Hebrews 2:12
[1:22:14] brother
[1:22:15] amen saying I will declare thy name unto
[1:22:17] my brethren and in the midst of the
[1:22:19] church I will sing praise unto thee amen
[1:22:22] so look this was fulfilled in Christ
[1:22:24] this was speaking of Christ Christ
[1:22:26] declared the name of God because he was
[1:22:28] anointed in the midst of his brethen
[1:22:30] amen just like David did now here's what
[1:22:32] brother bam says in this great warrior
[1:22:33] David
[1:22:34] 1955 now David was called by election he
[1:22:37] was called elected anointed and placed
[1:22:40] elected by God he was called from sheep
[1:22:43] herting to be the king anointed and
[1:22:45] positionally
[1:22:47] placed he said you're not a Christian by
[1:22:49] your desire you're a Christian by God's
[1:22:52] desire
[1:22:54] God had a desire for your life amen a
[1:22:56] calling as we heard on Sunday night with
[1:22:58] brother Gandy he said no man can come to
[1:23:01] me except the father draws in first
[1:23:03] first you were elected by God before the
[1:23:04] foundation of the world to be a
[1:23:06] Christian that's scripture no man can
[1:23:07] come except my father draws him he said
[1:23:10] the first thing you was elected or
[1:23:12] called then when God elected you then he
[1:23:14] called you and he heeded you to this
[1:23:17] call then he poured out the anointing
[1:23:19] oil on you the Holy Ghost
[1:23:23] he says what does oil represent in the
[1:23:24] Bible the Holy Spirit he said in a
[1:23:27] symbol form he said when he poured the
[1:23:30] oil on him he baptized him with the Holy
[1:23:32] Spirit in a SLE form I hope you get that
[1:23:34] he said he just poured the oil upon him
[1:23:36] it just went all over him a whole Horn
[1:23:38] of oil not sparingly amen it's the whole
[1:23:42] horn so he didn't spare any holy ghost
[1:23:45] He poured all the oil upon David
[1:23:49] amen and that's the way God pours the
[1:23:51] holy ghost on man not sparingly just
[1:23:55] baptizes him into it anointing him with
[1:23:58] the spirit amen now notice right there
[1:24:00] when that anointing struck him he was
[1:24:02] placed positionally as a king so see
[1:24:04] David when the anointing was on him he
[1:24:06] was called To Be a King but he wasn't a
[1:24:08] king yet praise God but he was going to
[1:24:11] go through trials to prepare him to be a
[1:24:14] king how many want to be a ruler Bible
[1:24:16] said you're a king or queen or priest
[1:24:19] right how many want to be a king or
[1:24:20] queen well that's a ruler you're called
[1:24:22] to be a ruler as well but you might not
[1:24:24] feel like it yet but let God take you
[1:24:26] through the process of be being ready to
[1:24:28] be a king or queen praise God you must
[1:24:30] go through that I think David ran I
[1:24:32] think if I'm not mistaken it was 12 12
[1:24:34] or 15 years he ran from Saul before he
[1:24:36] was actually a king something a long
[1:24:38] that was like that it was over a decade
[1:24:40] or something so he was called King right
[1:24:43] after he was anointed but he didn't take
[1:24:44] the throne for a decade
[1:24:46] later amen sounds like sounds like
[1:24:49] Abraham you're G to have a son and two
[1:24:51] decades two and a half decades past and
[1:24:53] he still don't have one yet but what
[1:24:55] God's word was still true amen he just
[1:24:58] had to hang on to God's word amen it's
[1:25:00] not in our time it's not for us to
[1:25:02] figure out it's just for us to believe
[1:25:04] what God said about it amen David did it
[1:25:07] Abraham did it everybody did it Peter
[1:25:09] did it everybody had to wait upon the
[1:25:11] promise of God and then God would bring
[1:25:13] the word to pass as you remain faithful
[1:25:15] amen that's exactly right and when
[1:25:17] you're in your unfaithfulness he'll
[1:25:19] correct you and bring you back to the
[1:25:20] fold just like David amen
[1:25:22] now the next thing is the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:25] foreshadowed by new clothes let's go to
[1:25:28] that uh Luke 2449 so brother Benjamin
[1:25:31] you go to Luke Luke

[1:25:40] because we need to get to communion
[1:25:41] pretty soon uh but I think you'll
[1:25:43] understand the uh types and shadows the
[1:25:46] for shadow glory of the Holy Ghost Amen

[1:27:28] an easy thing to get the the double
[1:27:29] anointing of the Holy Ghost no it's a
[1:27:31] hard thing he lets him know if you want
[1:27:33] a double portion of the baptism of the
[1:27:35] Holy Ghost you're gonna have to labor
[1:27:37] for it how remember last Wednesday night

[1:28:30] came to pass as they still went on and
[1:28:31] talked that behold there appeared a
[1:28:33] charot of fire and Horses of fire and
[1:28:35] part of them both the Sun and Elijah
[1:28:37] went by a whirlwind into heaven and
[1:28:39] elishah saw and cried my father my

[1:28:42] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[1:28:44] and he took hold of his own clothes and

[1:29:10] he took up also the man of Elijah that
[1:29:13] fell from him and went back and stood by
[1:29:16] the the bank of Jordan so he takes his
[1:29:18] mantle he said now I got new clothes
[1:29:21] let's see if these new new clothes work
[1:29:23] he said remember Jesus said you be
[1:29:24] clothed with what power amen so the Holy
[1:29:27] Ghost baptism is a new clothes and you
[1:29:29] got power in your life but look what he
[1:29:31] does with the power and he took the man
[1:29:34] of Elijah that fell from him and he
[1:29:35] smoked the water and said where is the
[1:29:37] Lord God of Elijah amen and when he had
[1:29:41] also smitten the waters they parted
[1:29:43] thither and thither and Elijah went over
[1:29:46] amen so he took that word and he wasn't
[1:29:49] afraid to use it amen hallelujah he said
[1:29:52] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:29:55] and forever amen hallelujah that's what
[1:29:58] we can do with the word of God with the
[1:30:00] name of Jesus Christ if it work for them
[1:30:02] it'll work for us amen we just got to
[1:30:05] take off our own clothes praise God the
[1:30:08] Bible said don't let your garments be
[1:30:09] spotted with sin that's that's what the
[1:30:11] Bible said you are supposed to hate is
[1:30:13] sin dirtying your garments the Bible
[1:30:15] says that hate even the garments spotted
[1:30:17] by the flesh the Bible says you should
[1:30:19] feel you should hate your sin when you
[1:30:21] sin praise God it's like having dirty
[1:30:23] clothes but rip it off and say I need a
[1:30:25] double anointing amen I need the Holy
[1:30:28] Ghost amen hallelujah now here's what
[1:30:31] brother man
[1:30:32] said when Elijah the old Prophet
[1:30:35] represented Christ Elisha the young
[1:30:37] Prophet followed him across Jordan when
[1:30:39] he come back he had a double portion so
[1:30:41] he said Elijah represented Christ Christ
[1:30:44] went up to heaven and who got the mantle
[1:30:46] of Christ the
[1:30:48] church Hallelujah didn't Peter seem like
[1:30:51] he had pretty good mantle on when he
[1:30:53] healed the healed the and raised
[1:30:55] the dead little girl didn't it look like
[1:30:57] he had a pretty good power there amen
[1:31:00] that's what we need praise God and Jesus
[1:31:02] said he said and the church followed
[1:31:05] Christ to Calvary and the mantle of
[1:31:07] Christ fell down with the baptism of the
[1:31:08] Holy Ghost and Jesus said these things
[1:31:10] that I do shall you do also and even
[1:31:12] greater than this shall ye do and he
[1:31:15] said where is the god of Jesus Christ
[1:31:17] where is the god that made the promise
[1:31:18] in the Bible we need more Elijah we need
[1:31:21] more Believers in it we need more
[1:31:23] Believers in truth because there's been
[1:31:25] so many twisting Creeds it's an
[1:31:27] uncertain sound of the people I'm trying
[1:31:28] to tell you he said get back to the
[1:31:30] Bible amen isn't that beautiful church
[1:31:33] we need some more elijas that say where
[1:31:35] is Jesus Christ where is the baptism of
[1:31:37] the Holy Ghost that's what we need today
[1:31:39] amen and then strike it and watch it
[1:31:41] happen amen that's what we need today by
[1:31:44] God's grace remember every promise is
[1:31:46] based upon conditions praise God so he
[1:31:49] got into the right conditions use the
[1:31:51] word of God used the the Holy Spirit
[1:31:53] power on him and it it worked by God's
[1:31:55] grace and we see it happen when your
[1:31:58] faith is in the word of God it works
[1:32:00] amen amen glory now we don't have time
[1:32:02] but brother bam said when Joseph got the
[1:32:04] coat of the rainbow coat he said that
[1:32:06] was the type of the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:08] Ghost said that in
[1:32:10] 1953 you say why because it was a
[1:32:13] rainbow color and if you go to
[1:32:15] Revelation 4:3 the Bible said Christ was
[1:32:18] ordained like a a rainbow the Bible said
[1:32:21] and he's the one that fills you with the
[1:32:23] Holy Ghost so it's a new garment new
[1:32:25] clothes uh so that represents the
[1:32:27] baptism of Holy Ghost all right are
[1:32:29] youall with me by God's grace that's the
[1:32:31] fifth one new clothes and Gideon got new
[1:32:33] clothes oh my you can you can start
[1:32:35] naming all the men that got new clothes
[1:32:37] and it represents the baptism of the
[1:32:38] Holy Ghost right number six I'm almost
[1:32:42] there number six we went over last
[1:32:44] Wednesday night the act of resting is is
[1:32:47] a type of the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:49] Ghost that's in Hebrews 4 let's go there
[1:32:51] Hebrews 4 and then Ruth
[1:32:56] 3:18 we read this last Wednesday
[1:33:02] night Hebrews
[1:33:04] 4:9 there remaineth therefore a rest for
[1:33:07] the people of God for he that has
[1:33:08] entered into his rest Heath also ceased
[1:33:11] from his own works as God did from his
[1:33:13] let us labor therefore to enter into
[1:33:15] that rest lest any man fall after the
[1:33:17] same example of unbelief remember Jesus
[1:33:19] said come unto me all you that weary
[1:33:21] heavy laden I'll give you what rest to
[1:33:23] your souls so it's the baptism of the
[1:33:25] Holy Ghost in the soul that's what the
[1:33:27] rest is and when brother said when you
[1:33:30] get the rest you stop your sinful habits
[1:33:33] you stop your worldly works and you
[1:33:35] cease from your works and now you do the
[1:33:37] works of the spirit
[1:33:40] amen now let's go to Ruth 3:18 this is
[1:33:42] what we didn't get to last week I just
[1:33:45] mention I read the quote but we didn't
[1:33:46] read it so let's go to
[1:33:49] Ruth Ruth is right before Samuel you
[1:33:52] find judges and
[1:33:57] Ruth Ruth
[1:34:04] 3:18 now if you know the story remember
[1:34:06] chapter one is Ruth getting Justified
[1:34:08] how many remember that she decides to
[1:34:10] follow Naomi and go the right path
[1:34:12] doesn't go back to a denominational moit
[1:34:14] worldly family second chapter is Ruth
[1:34:17] laboring brother BR said that's
[1:34:18] sanctification she's out working in the
[1:34:20] field she's looking for glean any any
[1:34:22] Soul she can glean from the field praise
[1:34:24] God and in chapter three she rests she
[1:34:27] rests until she's fully Redeemed by the
[1:34:30] kinsman redeemer brother that's the type
[1:34:32] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:34:33] third chapter the third work of Grace oh
[1:34:36] beautiful amen she doesn't leave the
[1:34:38] house she don't go out there to labor
[1:34:39] anymore she's resting on the work of
[1:34:41] Boaz we're resting on the finished work
[1:34:44] of Calvary through Jesus Christ amen
[1:34:48] Ruth 3:18 I'll read
[1:34:50] that then she said sit still my daughter
[1:34:53] until thou know how the matter will fall
[1:34:56] for the man will not be in rest until he
[1:34:57] have finished the thing this day so God
[1:35:00] won't rest until we're fully redeemed
[1:35:03] praise the Lord and now in 1961
[1:35:05] Revelation chapter 5 brother R says
[1:35:07] this he says now when Ruth was resting
[1:35:10] it's a type of the church resting in the
[1:35:13] promises of God we have the earnest now
[1:35:15] of our Salvation now listen we're not
[1:35:17] worried whether we're going over there
[1:35:18] or not we're
[1:35:20] going we're not worried if we're going
[1:35:22] to heaven or not we're going because
[1:35:24] we're resting on the promise of God amen
[1:35:27] amen he said God said so God promises we
[1:35:31] got the earnest which is the Baptist of
[1:35:33] the Holy Ghost it's done been received
[1:35:35] Christ has accepted us he's now now
[1:35:38] doing the kinsman redeemer work we have
[1:35:40] the earnest of right now waiting for the
[1:35:42] time that when he comes back in the
[1:35:45] Rapture amen glory he said then he goes
[1:35:48] the next thing was Ruth rewarded but
[1:35:50] then he goes through through
[1:35:51] justification
[1:35:53] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:55] he said went into the baptism of the
[1:35:56] Holy Ghost in the last days and now
[1:35:58] resting with the earnest of our
[1:36:00] inheritance that we know that something
[1:36:03] happened to us we pass from Death un
[1:36:05] life amen don't you love that church oh
[1:36:10] this stirred me up amen all right next

[1:36:57] train right the cars had to be sealed
[1:36:59] that's true we'll get to another one
[1:37:00] just a moment but uh that word actually
[1:37:03] means marked that's what the actual
[1:37:05] Greek word means you're marked unto the
[1:37:07] day of your Redemption hallelujah amen I
[1:37:10] love that I'm marked by God's presence
[1:37:13] okay now also in 2 Corinthians 3:3
[1:37:16] s much of are
[1:37:20] manifest the Epistle of Christ

[1:37:25] not living
[1:37:27] God
[1:37:30] Stone amen praise
[1:37:32] God okay so where where's the spirit of
[1:37:35] Christ the spirit of Christ ministered
[1:37:37] the word of God and wrote it upon the
[1:37:40] fleshly tables of our heart how many can
[1:37:42] see that by God's grace it's written
[1:37:45] praise
[1:37:47] God now Exodus 2511 let's read that one
[1:37:50] here is here now a type of the Arc of
[1:37:52] the Covenant now here's a here's a type
[1:37:55] for the seal but there's actually two
[1:37:56] types in here that type the baptism Holy
[1:37:58] Ghost there two types for us uh Exodus
[1:38:02] 2511 and we could take a sermon on every
[1:38:05] each one of these separately you could
[1:38:06] take a sermon I'm just going through
[1:38:07] them quickly because I want you to see
[1:38:09] them I want to spend more of my time on
[1:38:11] the quotes in the New Testament baptism
[1:38:13] Holy Ghost myself that's just how I feel
[1:38:15] L but uh so you can see it when you read
[1:38:17] the Old Testament it becomes brother
[1:38:18] said it becomes a new Bible the Bible
[1:38:20] becomes a new Bible when you the message
[1:38:21] of the hour yes praise God amen glory
[1:38:24] now in verse 10 Exodus 25:10 and they
[1:38:27] shall make an ark of shamwood and that
[1:38:29] sham wood means AAA wood that's why we
[1:38:30] named AAA AAA because she we wanted her
[1:38:34] to be the house of the word of God
[1:38:35] that's what the ark was it was a house
[1:38:37] of the word and the rod amen and also
[1:38:41] the Mana amen they shall make an ark of
[1:38:44] and wood brother said it was shwood
[1:38:47] was Ood two cubits and a half shall be
[1:38:50] the length thereof and a cub and half
[1:38:52] the breadth thereof and a cub and a half
[1:38:53] the height thereof and thou shalt
[1:38:55] overlay it with pure gold within and
[1:38:57] without shalt thou overlay it and it
[1:38:59] shall make up upon it a crown of gold
[1:39:03] round about now I'm GNA stop right there
[1:39:06] brother say this about the Ark in 1955
[1:39:08] this same sermon he mentioned the
[1:39:10] caseywood so I like the sermon he said
[1:39:12] the gold they just had to beat out the
[1:39:14] gold they got it hot and beat it the
[1:39:16] beater of the gold beat the gold you had
[1:39:18] to beat it with a hammer and they beat
[1:39:20] the gold to exceed is reflection it then
[1:39:22] get her hot and pour it all over the ark
[1:39:24] and it soaked into the wood praise God
[1:39:29] so the gold would soak into the out
[1:39:31] outside of the wood and also the inside
[1:39:34] of the wood amen hallelujah you
[1:39:36] understand what I'm saying the outside
[1:39:37] of the Ark was soaked in with gold and
[1:39:39] the inside was soaked in as well talk
[1:39:41] about sealed praise God Amen brother
[1:39:45] Rand said I don't have time to all this
[1:39:47] but brother R said the Ark of Noah had
[1:39:49] to be sealed with pitch
[1:39:51] and he tiped that to the baptism of the
[1:39:53] Holy Ghost so no water could get in amen
[1:39:56] had to be fully sealed Hallelujah are
[1:39:58] you with me he said the Arc of that
[1:40:01] Moses was put in that little Arc bull
[1:40:02] rush Arc he said that had to be sealed
[1:40:05] as well praise God Heen so the Bap of
[1:40:08] the Holy Ghost is liken unto a seal he
[1:40:11] says he said but when going back to the
[1:40:14] Ark of the Covenant when the Holy Spirit
[1:40:16] being the power Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:40:18] poured out upon the believer through the
[1:40:20] blood of Christ makes atonement for him
[1:40:23] he's safe from all Divine
[1:40:25] judgment he said he said it absolutely
[1:40:28] does include all sickness amen
[1:40:30] hallelujah so look at that he tipes it
[1:40:33] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:35] it shows the protection you're free from
[1:40:38] all Divine judgment because gold types
[1:40:40] deity as well amen and remember your Ark
[1:40:44] is typed by the heart right your heart
[1:40:46] the ark is a type of your heart so in
[1:40:48] your heart or we say in your soul you
[1:40:50] have to have the written word in there
[1:40:52] praise God and didn't Austin just read
[1:40:55] it for us the Holy Spirit writes the
[1:40:57] word what on the fleshly tables of our
[1:40:59] heart in our soul praise God amen amen
[1:41:03] and we'll get to the rod at at the end
[1:41:04] that's the last one I'm going to do the
[1:41:06] rod at the end I really got to hurry
[1:41:07] let's go to Jeremiah
[1:41:09] 31:33 oh my there's another one to
[1:41:12] Jeremiah
[1:41:17] 31:33 I might well let's see I think I'm
[1:41:21] going to stop at after this I'm going to
[1:41:22] stop after this one but God's great
[1:41:23] let's stop at Seven I like seven Seven's
[1:41:25] a good number that's a number of
[1:41:26] completion praise God three is
[1:41:28] perfection four is deliverance and five
[1:41:31] is Grace six is the number of man and
[1:41:34] Seven's completion praise God so ezek
[1:41:37] I'm sorry Jeremiah
[1:41:41] 3133 okay here's one we mentioned
[1:41:44] earlier but this shall be the Covenant
[1:41:46] that I will make with the house of
[1:41:47] Israel after those days sayith the Lord
[1:41:49] I will put my law in their in parts and
[1:41:51] write it in their hearts and will be
[1:41:53] their God and they shall be my people
[1:41:56] hallelujah how many believe that by
[1:41:57] God's grace remember this ties in with
[1:41:59] Ezekiel 36 remember writing the word
[1:42:02] upon the fleshly tables of the heart now
[1:42:04] this is quoted in uh Hebrews 10 but
[1:42:06] we're not going to go there but just
[1:42:07] take my word you look in your Bible
[1:42:09] Hebrews directly quotes this right from
[1:42:12] Jeremiah so the seventh and power a
[1:42:14] seventh we say the completion one is the
[1:42:17] cealing or marking let's go to one more
[1:42:19] uh Ezekiel chapter 9 go there by God's
[1:42:21] grace how we love the Lord tonight amen
[1:42:23] how many got joy in their heart tonight
[1:42:25] amen hallelujah the foreshadowed glory
[1:42:29] of the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:31] Ghost oh glory amen thank you Jesus this
[1:42:35] it did it all this for us it did all
[1:42:37] this for us it sealed us it marked us it
[1:42:41] helped us rest it clothed us it poured
[1:42:44] upon us it fell on us as fire it filled
[1:42:47] us and it immersed us amen oh
[1:42:51] hallelujah thank you Jesus last one
[1:42:55] Ezekiel chapter
[1:43:02] 9 verse
[1:43:04] one how we know the scripture the riter
[1:43:07] with the
[1:43:08] inkhorn now didn't the Bible just say
[1:43:10] we're going to write it with the ink
[1:43:12] upon the fleshly tables of the heart so
[1:43:14] this again types the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:43:17] he cried also mine ears with a loud
[1:43:18] voice saying cause them that have charge
[1:43:20] over the city to draw near even every
[1:43:22] man with his destroying weapon in his
[1:43:24] hand this is not a good situation people
[1:43:27] are about to get slayed here verse two
[1:43:30] and behold six men came from the way of
[1:43:32] the higher gate which lith toward the
[1:43:33] North and every man a Slaughter weapon
[1:43:36] in his hand and one man among them was
[1:43:38] clothed with linen with a Rider's
[1:43:41] inkhorn by his side and they went in and
[1:43:43] Stood Beside the braz and altar bra
[1:43:45] altar always represents death and
[1:43:46] judgment because that's the that's the
[1:43:48] AL where they all the animals were
[1:43:49] killed at the bra an altar okay verse
[1:43:52] three and the glory of the Lord God of
[1:43:54] Israel was gone up from upon the Cherub
[1:43:57] where whereupon he was to the threshold
[1:43:59] of the house and he called to the man
[1:44:01] clothed with linen which had the rider's
[1:44:04] ink horn by his
[1:44:06] side okay so there's six men and one of
[1:44:08] them's got a riter's inkor so the glory
[1:44:10] of God goes up and then there's a man
[1:44:12] with an inkor ready to write now what
[1:44:13] does he telling before judgment strikes
[1:44:16] verse four and the Lord said unto him go
[1:44:18] through the midst of the city through
[1:44:20] theid of Jerusalem and set a mark upon
[1:44:22] the foreheads of the men that sigh and
[1:44:24] cry I'm sorry men that sigh and that cry
[1:44:26] for all the Abominations that be done in
[1:44:29] the midst thereof
[1:44:31] amen so God said put a mark put a
[1:44:35] spiritual mark on those who are so
[1:44:37] burdened by sin that they sigh and cry
[1:44:40] over it amen that's why brother said
[1:44:43] when the Holy Ghost comes on him again
[1:44:45] he sigh and cries and booos and Carries
[1:44:47] On because it's so holy it makes you
[1:44:50] hate sin hallelujah amen amen is that
[1:44:54] right amen this is those who God marks
[1:44:57] and seals those who hate sin so much
[1:45:00] praise God that's why God will let
[1:45:02] somebody get away with mocking Sinners
[1:45:04] that's why God will let brother R get
[1:45:06] away uh uh that's why God let Elisha get
[1:45:09] away with calling down she Bears on
[1:45:10] children that mocked a prophet of God
[1:45:13] praise God Amen that's why God will let
[1:45:15] him get away with that or calling a Mrs
[1:45:17] dog meat right God will let them get
[1:45:20] away with that because they're filled
[1:45:21] with the Holy righteous indignation of
[1:45:24] the holy spirit amen amen they're living
[1:45:27] a separated holy life onto God and
[1:45:29] brother R said when you get so he said
[1:45:31] these things like cutting hair and
[1:45:32] makeup and and worldless he said they
[1:45:34] don't seem so bad down here he said but
[1:45:36] the higher you rise toward Heaven the
[1:45:38] more sinful it looks
[1:45:41] amen the closer other words the closer
[1:45:43] you get to the light the more the more
[1:45:46] sickness we'd say or the more the more
[1:45:48] bad the more evil Darkness looks I said
[1:45:50] like
[1:45:51] that amen is that right Church the
[1:45:55] closer you get up to God the closer you
[1:45:57] the closer you draw night to God the
[1:45:59] more awful sin is and God said before I
[1:46:01] destroy everyone in the city let's mark
[1:46:03] first those who sigh and cry for the
[1:46:05] Abominations done in the city amen verse
[1:46:09] five and to others he said in M hearing
[1:46:12] go ye after him through the city and
[1:46:13] smite let not your eyes spare neither
[1:46:16] have ye pity slay utterly old and young
[1:46:19] both maids and little children and women
[1:46:21] but come not near any man upon whom is
[1:46:23] the mark and begin at my where Sanctuary
[1:46:26] start at the church the church should
[1:46:28] know better the church should hate sin
[1:46:30] the church should always ball out
[1:46:33] sin he said start at my house because
[1:46:36] judgment begins at the house of God Amen
[1:46:40] God don't play around with sin God wants
[1:46:42] people that hate sin that are tired of
[1:46:44] sin that will confess sin and he'll mark
[1:46:46] them with the Holy Ghost if they hate
[1:46:48] iten amen praise God God does not play
[1:46:53] around with sin how many you believe
[1:46:54] that if you haven't sighed and cried for
[1:46:56] someone sin lately I encourage you start
[1:46:59] praying more amen you'll get so
[1:47:01] disgusted by sin you'll get so burdened
[1:47:03] and so grieved by sin you'll start
[1:47:05] sighing and crying for it that's the
[1:47:07] trouble we don't get far with God we're
[1:47:09] not sincere about Sin we just see it so
[1:47:11] much church we got to rise up higher in
[1:47:13] prayer and the way to do it is spend
[1:47:15] time on your knees in prayer spend time
[1:47:19] praying
[1:47:21] let's stop right there by God's grace
[1:47:23] now let's stand to our
[1:47:26] feet this was a type of course of
[1:47:29] Revelation chapter 7 remember remember
[1:47:31] God came down and said well the Angels
[1:47:33] came down and said hold those uh hold
[1:47:35] those angels that have the Four Winds
[1:47:38] the Four Winds of the earth remember
[1:47:39] that he said hold them until the
[1:47:41] Servants of God are sealed in their
[1:47:43] foreheads praise God and this Ezekiel 9
[1:47:47] was had a has numerous types it was type
[1:47:49] before uh Titus destroyed Jerusalem in
[1:47:52] ad70 remember because all the Holy Ghost
[1:47:54] filled people were out of there four
[1:47:55] years before Titus killed
[1:47:57] anybody they were marked see by God
[1:48:00] they're protected because they hated sin
[1:48:02] and also it's going to be fulfilled in
[1:48:04] Revelation 7 with 144,000 God will Mark
[1:48:07] and seal all those who who really want
[1:48:09] the Holy Ghost so Mark and seal them
[1:48:10] Before Destruction comes amen because
[1:48:14] remember the earth and the Sea and the
[1:48:16] land cannot be hurt until the Servants
[1:48:18] of God are sealed in their foreheads how
[1:48:20] you believe that by God's grace what a
[1:48:23] blessing let's bow our heads here praise
[1:48:27] God sealed or
[1:48:29] marked the foreshadowed glory of the
[1:48:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a cealing
[1:48:34] it's a marking I'm scrolling back it's a
[1:48:36] resting from your own works it's a new
[1:48:39] clothing it's a pouring out of
[1:48:42] oil or rain we'd say it's a fing of fire
[1:48:47] it's a filling after a digging out and
[1:48:50] it's
[1:48:51] immersion into water the washing of
[1:48:54] waters of the word now church tonight
[1:48:57] for communion at our church I don't
[1:49:00] force people to or I don't my my rule
[1:49:03] isn't well you have to feel like you're
[1:49:04] born again to have communion I feel like
[1:49:06] you can have communion as soon as you're
[1:49:08] Justified because the Bible said those
[1:49:10] who are Justified are already what
[1:49:14] glorified so all those who are truly
[1:49:16] Justified eventually will receive the
[1:49:18] baptis of the Holy Ghost so how could I
[1:49:20] one of those little ones uh communion
[1:49:22] with our Lord when God is going to
[1:49:24] finish the work that he started that's
[1:49:25] just my thought that's just my my
[1:49:28] instruction from you know Revelation
[1:49:30] Romans chapter 8 by God's
[1:49:32] grace so before we take communion let's
[1:49:34] have a moment here of prayer and Malachi
[1:49:37] can you turn back on the instrumental
[1:49:38] music let's just have that going since
[1:49:40] we don't have a musician here tonight
[1:49:42] well we do have amen but um I like him
[1:49:44] to he he's here to partake of community
[1:49:46] by God's
[1:49:49] grace let's just have a word of prayer
[1:49:50] if we can Heavenly Father Lord God thank
[1:49:53] you for this word of God
[1:49:55] tonight Lord I raise my hands and Lord
[1:49:57] as a church we thank you Lord for the
[1:50:00] word of God we've heard tonight this is
[1:50:02] the glory of what we're preaching about

[1:50:08] of these Lord 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000
[1:50:12] years ago about the
[1:50:15] glory of the baptism of the Holy Ghost

[1:50:22] we need to hunger and yearn and thirst
[1:50:23] for this Lord we must sigh and cry for
[1:50:26] sin in our lives and this the sin we see
[1:50:28] in the lives of others the sin we see in
[1:50:31] the lives of those in this city akan

[1:50:50] that our souls can feel totally immersed
[1:50:52] by the Holy Spirit our souls can be
[1:50:55] filled with the spirit whereas once
