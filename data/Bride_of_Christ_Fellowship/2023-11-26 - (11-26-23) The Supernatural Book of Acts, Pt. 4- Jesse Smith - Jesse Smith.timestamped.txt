[0:00] the Holy Spirit praise
[0:03] God enjoy these those series here I'm
[0:05] trying to get through the Romans one and
[0:07] this acts one looking at all these
[0:09] examples here and for me you know I feel
[0:12] allowed to do this you know we looked at
[0:13] U you know the Deeds of nians on Sunday
[0:17] I don't see any false doctrines in our
[0:19] church you know so I feel like uh we are
[0:22] trying our best as brother R said to be
[0:24] the book of Acts Church um and as we go
[0:27] through the book of Acts to me it gives
[0:29] us peace giv me calm it gives me Comfort
[0:31] it gives me courage we can see a lot of
[0:33] these same things they're going through
[0:35] we go through a lot of the same
[0:36] testimonies they had we can see we have
[0:38] those testimonies as well so it's a
[0:41] great refresher to go through this and
[0:42] see the gifts of the holy spirit working
[0:45] uh through uh the Saints in the book of
[0:47] Acts church and we want to see uh that
[0:49] the same thing work in our lives how
[0:51] many want to see it more praise God
[0:52] that's that's a main thing that we see
[0:54] you know main thing I preach we want to
[0:55] see more of it we're grateful what we
[0:57] have seen we want to see God continue to
[0:59] move Among Us
[1:00] we know he will but there's also the
[1:02] human ele element where we must Draw N
[1:04] to God and God will draw a n to us
[1:07] praise God I'm going to set timer for an
[1:08] hour here by the grace of the Lord just
[1:10] to kind of give me a measure of how
[1:13] we're going here acts
[1:28] 5:12 try to finish 5 this morning here
[1:32] by the grace
[1:38] of
[1:41] Hallelujah so I'll read 12 down to 16
[1:44] but we'll just save our voices from
[1:46] verse 16 so then I'll read 12 through 15
[1:48] myself and then we can all read 16
[1:50] together the Bible says and by the hands
[1:52] of the apostles were many signs and
[1:54] miracles wrought among the people and
[1:55] they were all with one Accord in
[1:57] Solomon's
[1:58] porch Solomon's porch was that area in
[2:01] the outer Court where anyone could go
[2:04] Jew and Gentile that's where Jesus often
[2:07] taught he would sit there on the porch
[2:08] and he would teach the people the words
[2:09] of God remember when he was arrested and
[2:11] he said wasn't I always in the temple
[2:13] sitting on Solomon's porch teaching you
[2:15] every day you come out against me as
[2:17] like a thief with staves right but he
[2:20] was constantly there so we see the
[2:21] Saints doing the same thing Jesus did
[2:24] Jesus would sit amongst the people and
[2:25] teach the people the word of
[2:27] God verse 13 and of the rest of no man
[2:30] joined himself to them but the people
[2:32] magnified them so there was a great
[2:34] reverence around them right as we saw
[2:36] when ananas and SAA died we saw that no
[2:39] one would join themselves to the church
[2:41] God had to be guiding them in there was
[2:42] such a reverence there was such a love
[2:44] there was such a respect for God verse
[2:47] 14 and Believers were the more added to
[2:49] the Lord multitudes both of men and
[2:52] women and God kept bringing in people in
[2:53] at the right time verse 15 in so much
[2:56] that they brought forth the sick into
[2:58] the streets and laid them on beds and
[3:00] couches that at the least the shadow of
[3:02] Peter passing by might overshadow some
[3:04] of
[3:05] them let's read verse 16 together ready
[3:08] one two three there came also a
[3:11] multitude out of the Cities round unto
[3:14] Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them
[3:18] which were vexed with unclean spirits
[3:20] and they were healed everyone may God
[3:23] has blessing to reo's word you may be
[3:24] seated God bless
[3:27] you so we're grateful uh for today
[3:30] Hallelujah be the house of the Lord and
[3:33] just looking at that scripture again you
[3:34] know I was reminded you know how the
[3:35] Lord has allowed me to see casting out
[3:37] Devils a number of times um and I'm
[3:41] grateful for that I'm aware that the
[3:43] same God is here today Hallelujah he's
[3:46] the same yesterday today and forever
[3:47] Jesus said in my name they shall cast
[3:49] out Devils praise God and so I believe
[3:52] God has given us a witness here in this
[3:53] hour in our generation that the book of
[3:56] Acts is continuing remember brother
[3:58] brandom said uh the true church will
[3:59] always try to be as much like the book
[4:02] of Acts as possible talk that in the
[4:04] church age book Hallelujah and so that's
[4:06] what we see in our life our church here
[4:08] we're trying to be like the book of Acts
[4:10] as close as possible you know one
[4:12] testimony I don't know if I've ever
[4:13] shared with you but verse 15 says the
[4:15] shadow of Peter would strike people and
[4:18] they'd be well that there was a
[4:20] testimony a brother Perry green gave do
[4:21] you remember that brother Jose Perry
[4:23] green would go over overseas and and
[4:26] people would try to get in his shadow
[4:27] and people would be made well even as
[4:30] his shadow that's how much reverence
[4:31] there was for brother bram's Ministry
[4:33] that was probably in the 80s or uh maybe
[4:35] 70s brother Perry green even saw that in
[4:38] his ministry uh where people would be so
[4:42] uh inspired by Brother R's Ministry that
[4:44] they would they'd follow the man after
[4:46] brother brandom and they would see the
[4:48] same signs wonders and miracles so it's
[4:50] a wonderful testimony God is the same
[4:52] yesterday today and forever praise God
[4:55] hallelujah so those are just a few
[4:57] testimonies we see uh there now I would
[4:59] like to um just briefly if you got your
[5:01] Bible let's read a few verses I got a
[5:03] few uh emails about you know prayer
[5:05] meetings uh and I've appreciated those
[5:07] and I'll just want to show you the
[5:08] scriptures that uh I'd like to share
[5:10] with them let's go to acts
[5:13] 27:20 so I believe you know uh if
[5:15] there's a desire uh if people want to
[5:18] pray more that's wonderful
[5:20] um and I I feel like if we can start
[5:22] praying more as a church when we have
[5:24] services and if there's still a great
[5:26] hunger for prayer then we can call extra
[5:28] prayer meetings as well that's what you
[5:29] would see the church do the church in
[5:31] the book of Acts you there wouldd be
[5:32] times and Seasons where they'd have
[5:34] extra prayer meetings there would be
[5:35] times and Seasons where they would do
[5:37] remember they would pray when when
[5:38] someone got in jail remember they would
[5:39] have like a prayer chain right like when
[5:41] Peter got in jail and so people you know
[5:44] are feeling led to pray more well then
[5:46] we want to follow the leadership of the
[5:48] Holy Spirit and this is what I've said
[5:50] over the years you know with Exodus uh
[5:53] 27:20 um anybody got that can read that
[5:56] real quick anybody got that there you
[5:59] got that anybody you get there I
[6:01] actually didn't turn to I was
[6:02] talking Exodus
[6:05] 27:20 then I'll get John 1213 so car
[6:09] whenever ready Exodus 2720 I'll get John
[6:28] 1213
[6:39] amen praise God now we look at this
[6:41] verse and we see uh Israel the Old
[6:43] Testament couldn't have service they
[6:44] couldn't have their daily service unless
[6:46] the people brought the oil as well and
[6:49] so I use this verse to show each one of
[6:51] us must bring the Holy Spirit we must
[6:52] bring uh a faith right we must bring a a
[6:55] revelation and we looked at it on
[6:56] Wednesday night every one of you have a
[6:58] PSAL so there's some Services you want
[7:00] to bring a song to church praise God
[7:02] there's some Services you might want to
[7:03] bring a doctorine to church like sister
[7:05] be just read 1 Thessalonians 4 The
[7:07] Rapture scripture on Wednesday right and
[7:09] we shared that on Wednesday night that
[7:11] was a a Doctrine she want to share just
[7:12] reminding us of the doctrine of the word
[7:14] of God but this is true for everybody
[7:16] this is for me true as a pastor my
[7:18] family we all got to bring the
[7:19] leadership of the Holy Spirit I typed it
[7:21] out when I preached the um when I
[7:24] preached that series on uh the Waters of
[7:26] Separation I typed it out as you know we
[7:29] won't have light in the Holy place or
[7:31] sanctification we won't have a great
[7:32] sanctification unless everybody brings
[7:34] the anointing of God if everybody lives
[7:36] a Sanctified life you know we'll get
[7:38] sprinkled by the holy spirit for
[7:39] repentance we'll come to the outer Court
[7:41] we'll enjoy the sacrifice of Jesus
[7:43] Christ right at the Brazen altar We'll
[7:45] Wash in the labor the washing of Water
[7:47] by the word right that's the outer core
[7:49] justification that's also represents
[7:51] water baptism but then we come into the
[7:53] holiest so when we need a real
[7:55] sanctification when and God wants his
[7:56] church Sanctified praise God the people
[7:58] bring the oil and then the oil lights up
[8:01] the manora praise God in other words the
[8:03] light of all seven Church ages is
[8:05] shining in our lives in other words we
[8:07] can see our lives in the Bible we can
[8:09] see how our church is a part of the book
[8:11] of Acts Church praise God Amen but each
[8:14] person's got to bring their oil each
[8:15] person has to bring an anointing of the
[8:17] Holy Spirit I feel led to do this I feel
[8:19] led to do this I feel led to pray for
[8:20] that person I feel led to sing this song
[8:22] uh this verse is really blessing me I
[8:24] want to share it with somebody so each
[8:26] person brings some type of anointing a
[8:28] leadership one of those channels and
[8:30] since I'm there I'm going to go and read
[8:31] the one we read brother R uses this in
[8:33] the church age book and it's applicable
[8:36] 1 Corinthians
[8:37] 1426 because like we said we are not
[8:39] under the Antichrist Spirit we're under
[8:41] the spirit of God so the Antichrist
[8:44] spirit will come in like a wolf right
[8:46] the Antichrist spirit will come in to
[8:48] divide the church to separate brothers
[8:50] from brothers and friendships from
[8:51] friendships that's how the Antichrist
[8:53] comes Spirit comes in and we don't want
[8:55] to bring that Spirit to church we want
[8:56] to bring the oil to church praise God so
[8:59] that's John
[9:01] 14:26 so this is how you bring oil Paul
[9:03] says how is then Brethren when you come
[9:05] together everyone everyone you have the
[9:07] song which is a
[9:08] song everyone has a Doctrine like be
[9:11] just had that Rapture Doctrine on their
[9:13] heart everyone have a tongue see if you
[9:15] have the gift of tongues everyone has a
[9:17] revelation a revelation is the the
[9:20] revealing of the will of God right it's
[9:21] a substance of things hoped for some
[9:24] someone might have a a fresh
[9:26] Revelation and half an interpretation of
[9:28] an known tongue let all things be done
[9:31] under edifying so we see if we bring in
[9:33] the anointing we're going to want to
[9:35] edify the people of God you'll
[9:37] especially see when a preacher brings
[9:39] the wrong anointing he'll want to tear
[9:40] the people down but a preacher under the
[9:42] anointing of God will want to build them
[9:44] up praise God Amen so if I brought the
[9:46] oil I'm here to build you up today
[9:48] praise God hallelujah yes we must repent
[9:50] of our sins preachers must rebuke sin
[9:52] and by God's grace when we're mature we
[9:54] can feel the rebuke of the holy spirit
[9:56] in our own lives praise God then we can
[9:58] confess confess our sins make everything
[10:00] right bring the oil have some type of
[10:02] anointing have some type of leadership
[10:04] today Hallelujah and be led by the Holy
[10:06] Spirit to speak to somebody by God's
[10:08] grace
[10:10] amen all right now John 12 so I use that
[10:13] and brother Ram says uh in the the
[10:16] breach message brother Ram says that a
[10:19] church should pray before service right
[10:22] and so I've said you know I invite you
[10:23] to church half an hour beforehand or you
[10:25] can pray at home whichever one but the
[10:27] thing to do is pray for the service
[10:29] R said if a preacher is not praying
[10:31] before service he gets all confused
[10:32] during service every's going to be
[10:34] watching me make sure I'm not confused
[10:35] today
[10:37] right because I did pray before service
[10:39] Austin was here we prayed as a family
[10:42] Hallelujah but brother brother said you
[10:44] got to sit in the quietness of the Holy
[10:46] Spirit and then you gather into worship
[10:48] with the Saints hope I'll get to that
[10:49] quote eventually here maybe Wednesday
[10:51] night by God's
[10:52] grace all right so this verse here John
[10:56] 12113 uh took the branches of palm trees
[10:59] and went forth to meet him and cried
[11:01] Hosanna blessed is he that blessed is
[11:04] the king that cometh Sor the king of
[11:05] Israel that cometh in the name of the
[11:07] Lord so this is Jesus riding on the cat
[11:09] the foul of an
[11:11] ass but notice and this is I just I
[11:13] drawn a tip from here if we bring out
[11:16] the Palms which I just I know we're
[11:17] talking about plants but here I'm
[11:19] talking about our our palms of our
[11:20] worship if we lay down our palms or if
[11:23] we pray if we humble ourselves before
[11:25] God then the king of glory will ride in
[11:27] amen hallelujah how many believe that am
[11:29] if you bring worship if you come here to
[11:31] love God if you come to pour out your
[11:33] praises the king of glory is going to
[11:34] slide through here praise God am he's
[11:36] going to come through here like a wind
[11:38] of the Holy Spirit like a rushing Mighty
[11:40] Wind but in both cases see you got to
[11:42] bring oil in this in this case here the
[11:44] second case you got to bring Palms you
[11:46] got to bring worship that's why I always
[11:48] say I bring my Palms here I I lay down
[11:50] at the altar and let the king of glory
[11:52] ride in Hallelujah that Jesus's will be
[11:55] accomplished in our lives
[11:57] Hallelujah now the third one one was um
[12:00] Joshua 6 ver7 so You' got your Bible
[12:03] birthday girl you want to read that
[12:04] birthday Joshua
[12:08] 67 he
[12:15] people amen praise God so this is of
[12:18] course when the walls of Jericho came
[12:20] down now brother Randon gets the order
[12:22] of our services from the
[12:24] scripture
[12:26] okay um it was singers you know in this
[12:29] we have singers then the ark and then
[12:31] the armies but what I found when I read
[12:32] it there before the singers was also
[12:34] armed
[12:36] men so armed men if you're armed you've
[12:38] got the word of God brother R said I got
[12:41] the sword of the king it's the sword
[12:42] that I live by anybody live by that
[12:44] sword when the enemy comes in like a
[12:46] flood what do you get out your sword
[12:48] praise God Amen you fight the enemy off
[12:51] you live by it but also the full armor
[12:53] of God in Ephesians 6 if you got all six
[12:56] pieces of armor five defensive six off
[12:58] I'm sorry one offensive what does the
[13:00] Bible say you're praying always with all
[13:02] prayer and spiritual supplication amen
[13:04] amen so when you're walking on the
[13:06] anointing you're constantly praying
[13:07] remember the Bible said pray without
[13:09] ceasing how many try to do that this
[13:10] week just talk to the Lord I try to talk
[13:12] to the Lord when I'm at work and talk to
[13:13] the Lord as I'm driving about my errands
[13:15] just talk to the Lord pray without
[13:17] ceasing tell the Lord you must tell
[13:19] Jesus all your troubles praise God tell
[13:22] Jesus all your trials Hallelujah he'll
[13:24] help you praise
[13:26] God so this is the third one here now um
[13:31] so there's three examples we got
[13:32] bringing oil laying down the
[13:35] palms and then before the walls fall you
[13:38] got armed men worshippers trumpets which
[13:41] represents the singing and then you have
[13:43] the Ark of the Covenant is that
[13:45] landscaper out there is that what keep
[13:47] noises I keep hearing would you go check
[13:49] just to be sure I've heard a couple
[13:51] things that just it's good to know he
[13:53] usually usually comes on Saturday I wish
[13:55] didn't come on Sunday um verse eight and
[13:59] it came to pass when Joshua had spoken
[14:00] on the people that the seven priests
[14:02] bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns
[14:04] passed on before the Lord and blew with
[14:06] the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant
[14:08] of the Lord F them so see there we see
[14:10] trumpets first and then word Ark it
[14:12] represents the word the anointed word
[14:15] hallelujah remember the armed Men passed
[14:17] on before the ark so we have armed
[14:20] soldiers we got soldiers and how many
[14:22] know we need some prayer warriors praise
[14:23] God Amen how many how many are a prayer
[14:26] Warrior by by Grace by grace so see the
[14:29] armed men go first the prayer warriors
[14:31] then you got the music the trumpeters
[14:34] then you got the word of God hallelujah
[14:36] amen it's a beautiful it's a beautiful
[14:39] uh testimony and remember like getting
[14:40] back to the oil you can't have oil and
[14:42] unless you beat out the oil you stomp on
[14:44] the olives right it's a lot of stomping
[14:46] right it's it's a lot of work you got to
[14:48] you got to labor to produce this oil is
[14:50] he out there
[14:51] okay just curious our friends out
[14:55] there so see there's there's always
[14:57] there there's spiritual ual uh effort
[14:59] that must be put forth I I don't like to
[15:01] use the word work but the Bible said we
[15:03] have good works and we're not earning
[15:05] the anointing of the Holy Spirit but
[15:07] we're making ready for it we've got to
[15:09] prepare for the anointing of the Holy
[15:11] Spirit if we want more of God if we want
[15:13] to see more of God we got to put more
[15:14] into God Amen right because we're either
[15:18] putting things into the world or our
[15:19] life or just Christian Liberties we're
[15:21] putting things into that but if we want
[15:23] more of God spiritually we got to put
[15:24] more effort into it spiritually Paul
[15:26] calls it diligence praise God Amen put
[15:28] more diligence be more Earnest in the
[15:30] things of God whatever we put into God
[15:32] that's what we'll get out whatever you
[15:34] put in the service that's what you'll
[15:36] get out amen hallelujah exactly
[15:39] right okay now verse n is where I want
[15:42] to get to and the armed men went before
[15:44] the priests see that that blew with the
[15:46] trumpets so brother R gave us trumpets
[15:49] and and and Ark but see before that we
[15:52] got armed men we got soldiers ready to
[15:54] fight we've got saints that got the
[15:57] sword of the spirit in their hand
[15:59] Hallelujah let's not lay down our swords
[16:01] let's have our swords ready to fight am
[16:04] because this is how the army of God
[16:05] marched on praise God now to me as
[16:08] brother R said this is more information
[16:10] about the same Revelation it's the same
[16:12] Revelation before the word you got to
[16:14] have
[16:15] worship but the further re the further
[16:18] information shows us we got to have
[16:20] armed soldiers going before we have to
[16:22] have people that are anointed with the
[16:24] holy spirit with the armor of God on
[16:26] praise God I don't have much voice here
[16:28] didn't realize must have sang it all out
[16:30] during the song
[16:31] service so I apologize but everybody can
[16:34] can see that by God's grace you have
[16:36] armed soldiers trumpet music and then
[16:39] you got the word of God that's the order
[16:41] that it goes through praise God now the
[16:43] last one acts 131 now we'll get to this
[16:45] eventually but I just thought it was a
[16:47] fourth example in the mouth of two or
[16:49] what two or three Witnesses I'm going to
[16:51] give you four of course there's way more
[16:53] than that two or three Witnesses let
[16:55] every word be
[16:57] established Acts
[17:00] 131 I think it's a wonderful thing when
[17:02] we want to have more
[17:05] prayer I think uh first let's pray more
[17:07] when we're together if we can do that if
[17:09] we can have that everybody in One Accord
[17:11] then we'll have extra services but of
[17:13] course as I told people too if you want
[17:14] to come pray on your own I'll get you a
[17:16] key to the church you can pray as much
[17:17] as you want to pray uh one thing we want
[17:19] we want you to pray by God's grace
[17:21] numerous times when we were going to
[17:22] Lima and we didn't have this church here
[17:24] I would uh go to Lima to pray on
[17:26] Saturdays before preaching on Sundays my
[17:28] brother Brooks was out and I'd preach
[17:29] for him I would go Saturday I'd pray up
[17:31] Saturday before the
[17:33] service that's just one thing I always
[17:35] like to get alone with God I would just
[17:36] say brother can you let me into the
[17:37] church and brother Mike would let me
[17:39] into the church I just go in there all
[17:40] by myself those were some sweet times
[17:43] Hallelujah now it makes it a little
[17:44] harder on my wife but you know that's
[17:45] that's her uh that's her responsibility
[17:47] with the children there but each one of
[17:50] us should desire to have times with the
[17:52] Lord now acts
[17:54] 13:1 now this is right before they
[17:57] started their missionary work and they
[17:58] needed God's
[18:00] leadership Hallelujah so here's what you
[18:02] do when you want God's leadership I was
[18:03] reminded today how brother Randon would
[18:05] get many many invitations I would I
[18:08] would say maybe say let's say a 100
[18:09] invitations a year think about that
[18:11] think about if people invited you to a
[18:13] 100 different services this year which
[18:14] ones would you go
[18:16] to right that's a lot of a lot of
[18:18] invitations I hardly get any invitations
[18:20] so it's very
[18:21] easy but brother there's quotes and I
[18:23] couldn't find them I didn't have time to
[18:25] find them but brother lay all the
[18:26] imitations all the letters on the table
[18:29] in front of the church it would be the
[18:30] uh communion table and they would pray
[18:32] and say God as we start this next year
[18:34] let's you know as we're coming to
[18:36] 224 but before you would start 1963 say
[18:39] Lord you know all these requests guide
[18:41] us onto which ones we go
[18:43] to and he said I have no leading I said
[18:46] I just got to pray and see which ones
[18:48] God might have me to go
[18:50] to and the point of it is church there's
[18:52] some things God lets us work out on our
[18:55] own right God wants to see what you're
[18:57] going to do about it
[18:59] right there's some things that you know
[19:00] God doesn't tell us remember the angel
[19:02] Lord Brother was so discouraged he would
[19:04] only pray for like five or seven people
[19:06] a night and all robbers would pay pray
[19:08] for 500 in one service and the people
[19:10] started putting that brother Ram's ear
[19:11] and he's like Lord what should I do and
[19:13] finally the angel Lord came to him and
[19:15] he asked the angel Lord which way do I
[19:17] do it and you know what the angel of
[19:18] Lord said just as you feel
[19:20] led Hallelujah so see in the book of
[19:24] Acts we have we have this standard of
[19:26] the book of Acts but we don't have all
[19:27] the details okay amen so in each case we
[19:30] got to pray seek God first right seek
[19:32] God put your put your sacrifice before
[19:34] God put your fleece before God and see
[19:36] how God's leading you to go praise God
[19:39] and right now at our home you know for
[19:40] our Bible time we're reading through the
[19:41] book of generations the book Jose got me
[19:43] I keep mentioned it but we read through
[19:45] we probably read through seven or eight
[19:46] of
[19:47] those and each one of them each one of
[19:50] them has some type of testimony from the
[19:53] discernment lines of brother Brandon
[19:55] it's amazing they saw people get healed
[19:57] from Poli tuberculosis crippled walk and
[20:01] so see when brother was given the choice
[20:03] do I do 500 or do I discern each one
[20:06] slowly he chose a slow discernment but
[20:08] look at the testimonies that come out of
[20:10] it right
[20:12] Hallelujah remember the main thing is
[20:14] that we're serving Jesus Christ right
[20:16] because if you get well if you get a
[20:18] miracle that's great but are you going
[20:19] to keep serving Jesus right that's the
[20:21] most important thing
[20:23] Hallelujah but see that I just thought
[20:25] that's a great example of you know we
[20:26] all have Liberty the holy SP like I said
[20:29] with holidays we looked at holidays you
[20:30] know on Wednesday with the the uh Deeds
[20:33] of nickads and some people are really
[20:35] against holidays other people see the
[20:37] Liberty in it I see the Liberty in it
[20:40] but I got to make sure that my Liberty
[20:42] doesn't become sin it does which would
[20:45] be a distraction right so whatever we do
[20:48] we must find the Liberty remember
[20:49] brother Rand had a Christmas tree
[20:51] brother random said Merry Christmas
[20:53] Hallelujah brother Ram gave gifts out to
[20:55] his children brother Ram uh celebrated
[20:57] uh
[20:59] Thanksgiving Easter brother R celebrated
[21:01] all these holidays but in each case you
[21:04] gotta you got to stay in communion with
[21:05] the holy spirit so you don't get
[21:07] distracted you don't go too far you keep
[21:09] the balance and you stay in the liberty
[21:10] of the holy spirit amen
[21:14] amen so now I can read acts 13 boy my
[21:16] voice is really out my goodness wasn't
[21:18] really happy about that now there were
[21:20] in the church that's at an certain
[21:23] prophets and teachers and Barnabas and
[21:25] Simeon that was called Niger and LU of
[21:28] sirene and Manan which had been brought
[21:31] up with Herod the tetrarch and saw isn't
[21:34] this
[21:34] interesting God saved a man out of the
[21:38] political system he was brought up with
[21:39] Herod right so we'll say like this A man
[21:41] was involved in the White House and God
[21:43] saved him out of there gave him the Holy
[21:45] Ghost praise God I like that
[21:47] amen God can save him from anywhere
[21:50] remember the Bible said there's not many
[21:51] wise there's not many great that God's
[21:53] called but there will be some great ones
[21:55] that God calls to this message praise
[21:57] God amen amen oh yeah like this I know a
[22:00] uh I was I'm in contact with a a pastor
[22:03] from Minnesota and he used to be an NFL
[22:05] football player brother Austin I never
[22:07] knew it his name's Brian really and he
[22:09] believes a lot of the same things we do
[22:11] and I thought wow there's an example I
[22:13] he prob make millions of dollars he's a
[22:14] backup player but I forgot about that
[22:17] God called him uh out of the the NFL and
[22:19] now he's a pastor now he's an older man
[22:22] now I think he played in the 67s OR 80s
[22:25] I thought there's a good example God
[22:27] calls a great great person great by the
[22:29] world standards and shows him the
[22:30] nonsense of that and brings him into the
[22:32] truth praise
[22:33] God
[22:36] Amen now look at verse two as they
[22:39] ministered to the Lord and fasted the
[22:42] Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and
[22:44] Saul for the work whereinto I have
[22:47] called them so see how do they minister
[22:50] to God did you ever realize that
[22:51] sometimes it's your duty to minister to
[22:53] God right amen right we always say God
[22:56] bless me God God I need this that's God
[22:59] ministering to you but has ever been a a
[23:01] reality where sometimes you need to
[23:02] minister to
[23:04] God now the Bible said God doesn't need
[23:08] anything right but when you want when
[23:10] you want God's will for something it's
[23:12] as if you go make sacrifices and you go
[23:15] make offerings right and it's that it's
[23:17] as you're ministering to God and then
[23:19] God will speak back amen like I just
[23:22] read about Samuel and Saul when Saul
[23:24] became king and before Saul was King
[23:28] went to Samuel's town and they said hey
[23:30] we got a prophet in town you better take
[23:31] him some bread and some
[23:33] meat right take take the man of God a
[23:35] present I'm not asking for
[23:37] presents because I'm not a prophet
[23:39] brother R is a prophet Hallelujah we
[23:41] might have Minor Prophets but I just
[23:43] like that look at the respect look at
[23:45] the the respect when when they need a
[23:46] word from God they go offer a sacrifice
[23:50] amen now it's not legalism we're not
[23:51] making a legalistic item for us mainly
[23:54] it's just confessing sins and worshiping
[23:56] God when we need something from God we
[23:57] got to confess our sins we got to bring
[23:59] an offering we got to worship God we got
[24:01] to minister to the Holy Spirit praise
[24:03] God Amen
[24:05] okay and that's why you know if we want
[24:07] to have separate par means that we can
[24:09] it's a good idea but we got to have a a
[24:11] motive behind it the motive behind this
[24:14] is what do we do for missionary work
[24:18] Hallelujah right and so God answers here
[24:22] as they fasted they ministered the Holy
[24:25] Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul
[24:27] for the work called them to do verse
[24:29] three and when they fasted and prayed
[24:31] and laid their hands on them they sent
[24:32] them away and so they being sent forth
[24:35] by the Holy Ghost departed unto salua
[24:37] and from then they sailed to Cyprus amen
[24:40] so see if you desire prayer meetings
[24:41] that's a wonderful thing we all should
[24:44] desire prayer meetings hallelujah amen
[24:46] right if we need leader especially if we
[24:49] need leadership or we need an answer
[24:50] from God or we got a big decision to
[24:52] make or we want to go out this ministry
[24:54] we feel led to do you must pray seek God
[24:58] you must minister to God hallelujah and
[25:00] then God will minister to you praise God
[25:01] Amen now see church that's why many
[25:04] times I'll fast on a Sunday and then
[25:05] I'll come here and pray what am I doing
[25:07] I'm trying my best to do this on a very
[25:09] regular
[25:10] basis or I won't eat Wednesday before
[25:13] church I won't eat fast and just pray
[25:15] and meditate get on the word of God what
[25:17] am I trying I'm trying to get wisdom
[25:18] from the word of God and I believe God's
[25:21] helped me by God's grace amen there's
[25:22] been times I haven't known what I preach
[25:24] and maybe I preach something that was
[25:25] just for you or something or God K
[25:27] somebody at the end of a of a service
[25:29] what do I give that I give that credit
[25:31] to the word of God because the word of
[25:33] God has taught me I've got to minister
[25:35] to God I got to show God some love and
[25:37] respect hallelujah amen I got to
[25:39] consecrate myself unto God and then God
[25:41] will answer my prayer hallelujah amen
[25:44] see
[25:45] that so there's four
[25:47] examples of just just going over the
[25:50] preparation uh the Saints must make in
[25:53] the Supernatural book of Acts church and
[25:55] the church said bring the oil you got
[25:57] you got to stomp it out you got to get
[25:59] it ready you got to filter it out right
[26:00] you got to filter the oil out you don't
[26:01] want pieces of oil or olives in their
[26:03] oil you got to filter it
[26:06] out you got to bring the Palms you got
[26:08] to go out get the branches and bring the
[26:10] Palms you got to get your sword sharpen
[26:12] you got to get your gear on Amen
[26:14] Hallelujah and here you got to pray and
[26:16] fast and call on God Amen and gather
[26:20] together with Saints of light precious
[26:21] Faith so those are all I love the
[26:24] requests when people want to do extra
[26:25] prayer so I I say let's pray first
[26:28] together and if we see this if we see
[26:30] the Zeal if we can see some Zeal coming
[26:32] up then we'll do extra prayer meetings
[26:34] as well by God's grace amen all
[26:36] right
[26:38] Hallelujah now let's go to Acts chapter
[26:41] 5 we read 12 through 16 Acts chapter
[26:48] 5 so that's a little bit of a review but
[26:50] it's been years since I've actually
[26:52] preached that probably 2017 or so
[26:54] haven't preached that for years I just
[26:56] want to lay that out there and that's we
[26:57] do we see these types in the book of
[26:59] Acts because that's what brother brand
[27:00] did Brother looked at the type of
[27:01] Jericho Joshua chapter 6 and he brought
[27:04] it to his church okay we'll have
[27:06] trumpets we'll have the songs and then
[27:07] the word
[27:10] hallelujah so we can learn from that by
[27:12] God's grace so in Acts chapter 5 we see
[27:15] the power of a holy church Scofield
[27:18] calls it Hallelujah no no doubt these
[27:21] Apostles had many signs and wonders
[27:23] wrought amongst the
[27:26] people and notice they brought the sick
[27:28] ones to the apostles that were vexed and
[27:31] they healed them everyone now remember
[27:33] earlier with Jesus they couldn't heal
[27:35] some because they weren't doing what
[27:36] they weren't praying and fasting right
[27:38] so if they're healing everyone what have
[27:40] they learned amen they've learned to
[27:41] pray and fast hallelujah amen now
[27:43] remember chch I'm not making this
[27:44] legalism but I'm saying if we want God
[27:47] to use our gifts if we want to see more
[27:49] Supernatural we got to be consecrated to
[27:51] our
[27:51] gifts like I read that quote on
[27:53] Wednesday ra said you got to be just as
[27:56] interested in your ministry as the
[27:58] pastor is in his I'm trying to be very
[28:00] interested in my Ministry I'm trying to
[28:02] now I'm trying to post a quote from
[28:03] Brother brand every single day that not
[28:05] just helps the YouTube but just to keep
[28:07] me in the word of God that's why I'm
[28:09] doing that too amen I just want to stay
[28:11] in that word as much as I just want to
[28:13] be reminded because I forget a lot of
[28:14] quotes there's a lot of quotes out there
[28:16] there's a lot of scriptures I forget
[28:17] there's a lot of quotes I forget I want
[28:19] to stay in that channel remember the
[28:21] word of God meditate on the word of God
[28:23] because you never know God might use
[28:24] what you place if you put those little
[28:25] seeds in there God will water and it'll
[28:27] it'll bring forth at the right time
[28:29] it'll bless somebody at just the right
[28:30] time praise God
[28:32] Amen put all these seeds in there and
[28:34] then God will bring forth those seeds in
[28:36] the right time and season our hearts and
[28:38] Minds
[28:40] Hallelujah now verse 17 here's the
[28:43] second
[28:45] persecution against the church then the
[28:47] high priest rose up and all that were
[28:49] with them which is the sect of the
[28:50] Sadducees and they were filled with
[28:52] indignation they laid their hands on the
[28:53] apostles and put them in the common
[28:55] prison but the angel of the Lord by
[28:58] Night opened the prison doors and
[28:59] brought them forth and said go stand and
[29:02] speak in the temple to the people all
[29:04] the words of this life
[29:07] amen hallelujah what a testimony now
[29:10] again remember when I demonstrated this
[29:11] with Malachi you know they laid their
[29:13] hands on them and they drag them off to
[29:15] jail now would we would our face stand
[29:19] if that was the case in America would
[29:20] our face
[29:22] stand or we say oh no no you got the
[29:24] wrong guy I I I want my freedom don't
[29:27] take me to jail would you recant or
[29:29] would you go to jail for
[29:31] Jesus Hallelujah now it's come down to
[29:34] some people it's starting to come down
[29:35] for some conservatives on that right
[29:37] they've been taken in jail uh of course
[29:40] we're seeing it more and more slowly
[29:41] it's the birth pain of slowly moving
[29:42] into that more and
[29:44] more but the but remember as I said last
[29:47] time just like with job Satan had Satan
[29:49] was before God and God had to say you
[29:51] can take them to jail just don't take
[29:53] their
[29:54] life so if you go to jail or if anything
[29:56] bad happens to you you know God allowed
[29:58] it right right God didn't abandon you
[30:02] God's letting you be tested so you can
[30:03] overcome praise
[30:06] God he wants your faith to go through
[30:09] the fiery test of Affliction that it may
[30:11] come forth as gold God let these trials
[30:14] these bad things happen to us they'll
[30:16] make us more like Christ amen amen just
[30:19] like job he come out better he come out
[30:21] repenting God I I said things I didn't I
[30:24] didn't understand I I I made myself more
[30:26] rightous in you forgive me that God says
[30:29] I'm blessing you with double what you
[30:30] had
[30:31] before you passed the test
[30:36] Hallelujah so they lay hands on him and
[30:38] I love this the Angel takes him out and
[30:40] what does he say go speak the words of
[30:42] this life not legalism it's
[30:45] life this Bible produces a life how many
[30:48] enjoy the life God Gave You amen it's
[30:51] not a life it's not a death it's aive
[30:53] praise God Amen he says go stand in the
[30:56] temple and and speak the words of the
[30:58] light what do we got we've got eternal
[31:01] life hallelujah amen we've all got
[31:03] natural life but that's not what the
[31:04] angel was talking about the angel was
[31:06] telling them go talk about eternal life
[31:09] through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen
[31:11] that's what he's telling them so what
[31:13] they do here's another gift now this is
[31:15] my favorite one of I shouldn't say my
[31:16] favorite gift this is the gift that I
[31:17] got verse 21 and when they heard that
[31:20] they entered in the temple early in the
[31:21] morning and talk see there's teaching so
[31:24] does the book of Acts church have
[31:25] teaching yes just like had tongues in
[31:27] Chapter 2 right just like it had
[31:30] miracles in chapter 3 and the saint said
[31:33] amen it has all these just like had a
[31:35] miracle right there the angel opened the
[31:37] prison doors set them
[31:40] free they didn't have to escape but the
[31:43] angel of Lord let them out of prison a
[31:45] supernatural Miracle this is the
[31:47] supernatural book of Acts Church
[31:49] hallelujah amen as we saw what were they
[31:51] doing praying fasting they were
[31:53] dedicated to God their hearts and Minds
[31:56] were on God all the the time they were
[31:58] able to use God's gifts that God had
[31:59] given them they were faithful to God's
[32:02] gifts Hallelujah but the high priest
[32:05] came and they that were with him and
[32:06] called the council together and all the
[32:08] Senate of the children of Israel and
[32:09] sent to the prison to have them brought
[32:11] but when the officers came and found
[32:13] them not in the prison they returned and
[32:15] told saying the prison truly found we
[32:17] shut with all safety and the keepers
[32:20] standing without before the doors but
[32:22] when we had opened we found no man
[32:25] within Hallelujah now when the chief
[32:27] priests and the captain of the temple
[32:29] and the chief priests heard these things
[32:31] they doubted of them where to this would
[32:33] grow then came one of them uh saying
[32:37] behold the men whom you put in the
[32:38] prison are standing in the temple and
[32:40] teaching the people just like Jesus
[32:43] right there's times remember there's two
[32:45] types of preaching there's two types of
[32:46] of preaching there's preaching and
[32:48] there's teaching preaching raises your
[32:51] faith for
[32:52] Supernatural it's public it's publicly
[32:55] declaring the power of God teaching
[32:57] gives you instruction this is how you
[32:59] serve God right so what what have I
[33:01] giving today I'm giving teaching we need
[33:03] to fast and pray right we need to come
[33:06] together we need to everyone needs to
[33:07] bring an anointing of the Holy
[33:09] Spirit hallelujah amen see that's
[33:11] teaching you to teaching that these
[33:13] scriptures tell us what we need to do to
[33:15] serve God
[33:17] better
[33:22] Hallelujah all right verse 26 then went
[33:24] the captain with the officers and
[33:26] brought them without violence for they
[33:28] feared the people that they should have
[33:29] been stoned and when they had brought
[33:31] them they set them before the council
[33:33] and the high priest asked them saying
[33:35] did not we straightly command
[33:38] you that you should not teach in his
[33:40] name and behold you have filled
[33:41] Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend
[33:44] to bring this man's blood upon
[33:46] us okay so see
[33:49] that they brought them and they laid
[33:51] them before the councel said didn't we
[33:54] tell you not to teach in this name I
[33:55] love these words Peter says verse 29
[33:58] then Peter and the others Apostles
[34:00] answered and said we ought to obey God
[34:02] rather than men amen even if I get
[34:05] arrested I'll obey God rather than
[34:08] men right we're seeing more of that
[34:10] coming around as we said in
[34:12] America there's more crooked uh Das
[34:14] there's more crooked judges than ever
[34:16] before so we don't know what we're going
[34:18] to have to do we don't know what we have
[34:19] to suffer but we must speak the name of
[34:21] Jesus
[34:22] Christ especially I want to share this
[34:24] with the adult especially with 2024
[34:26] coming the last presidential election we
[34:28] had what happened Co came in they tried
[34:30] to strip a lot of our Liberty so adults
[34:32] we got to pray here we go here we go
[34:35] 20124 it was all set up by the
[34:37] government
[34:42] yeah we got to pray about
[34:45] death remember there the government that
[34:47] killed JFK it was a Government tried to
[34:49] assassinate Ronald Reagan our own
[34:51] government our own government paid for
[34:54] the co virus and Unleashed it right that
[34:57] was four years ago here we come another
[34:59] time so the thing to do is just be ready
[35:01] and pray don't live in fear but let God
[35:03] hear your prayers
[35:05] Hall remember each time it's a harder
[35:07] pressure right just like a birth pain
[35:09] you mothers know what I'm talking about
[35:11] it's birth pain so we can expect likely
[35:14] another pre time of pressure and and no
[35:18] doubt most people most preachers will
[35:19] say well this is the rapture this is the
[35:20] rapture it doesn't matter no man knows
[35:22] the day or the hour we'll always be
[35:24] ready for the Rapture praise God if
[35:25] we're born again if we're God if we're
[35:28] seeking to be born again wherever we're
[35:29] at if if our name's on the Lamb's Life
[35:31] we'll be ready for the Rapture praise
[35:33] God that's why he called me out the
[35:35] world he didn't call me out of the world
[35:36] to Lead Me in the tribulation he called
[35:38] me out of the world to get me ready for
[35:39] my wedding with Jesus

[38:27] Holy Ghost was Friday Saturday Sunday
[38:30] now which was sad they didn't record the
[38:32] Saturday night service that's the one
[38:33] where the Holy Ghost really fell and
[38:35] he's like oh I wish they would have got
[38:36] a tape of it last
[38:37] night he said there were shouting
[38:39] screaming dancing kind of like we've had

[38:59] year so we're going to do this this year
[39:01] I don't we don't have to do that
[39:02] remember Traditions are okay right it's
[39:05] okay to have some tradition that don't
[39:06] write the word of God but I also want to
[39:08] be led into new things by God's
[39:10] grace I want to see what does the Holy
[39:13] Spirit want for us today what does the
[39:14] Holy Spirit want for us for 2024 praise
[39:17] God I remember Naomi's word for 2023 was

[39:22] word you were praying for was was that
[39:24] the right word supernal Supernatural
[39:26] amen hallelujah God definitely visited
[39:28] Us in that in a number of ways
[39:31] Hallelujah but however God's leading the
[39:33] church we want to be led that direction
[39:35] hallelujah amen now see I've been I've
[39:38] LED I've been felt led like Johnny felt

[39:46] before we were led into that Johnny felt
[39:48] led to do that so I felt led to do that
[39:51] too but we don't have to keep doing that
[39:53] forever we can go back to preaching
[39:54] twice on Sunday if you want want to hear
[39:56] me preaching clapping shouting screaming
[39:58] we'll do that on Sunday night too or
[39:59] whatever you be allowed to
[40:01] do but the main thing is gather more as
[40:04] we see that day approaching obey God and
[40:07] God will give you what you have need of
[40:08] praise God even those of us who have the
[40:11] Holy Ghost we might want a refilling in
[40:13] our minds hallelujah or we might have a
[40:16] need of some healing or we might have a
[40:18] need of a lost loved one or just a
[40:20] Ministry God is my Ministry in its right
[40:23] place am I serving you the best I can I
[40:25] want to draw n to you so you'll Draw N
[40:27] to me
[40:30] am okay verse 33 when they heard that
[40:34] they were cut to the heart and took
[40:36] counsel to slay
[40:38] them the Christians said we're going to
[40:40] obey God not you they said then they
[40:42] start playing well now we're going to
[40:44] kill
[40:44] you right people and you see you see
[40:48] that anger but and it's true like we saw
[40:50] with the Hamas that same demon that was
[40:52] on Hitler is on the Hamas people they're
[40:54] doing the same things Spirits never die
[40:57] right and brother R said thus sayith the
[40:59] Lord that spirit that was on Rome is
[41:01] coming to the us through the same
[41:02] persecution it did in
[41:04] Rome right of course we know it's for
[41:06] the tribulation but Saints we got we got
[41:08] to recognize it's coming but God's
[41:09] making us ready the Rapture is coming
[41:11] too amen hallelujah persecution is
[41:15] coming but Deliverance salvation and
[41:18] Escape is coming as well
[41:20] Hallelujah we don't know when no man
[41:22] knows the day or the
[41:23] hour we want to be maken ready by God's
[41:25] grace
[41:27] verse 34 then stood there up one in the
[41:30] council a Pharisee named Gia a doctor of
[41:32] the law had a reputation among all the
[41:35] people and commanded to be put the
[41:37] apostles forth a little
[41:39] space okay so Gia is the the teacher in
[41:43] the Jewish synagogue and he can see his
[41:45] Jewish brothers are about ready to kill
[41:46] these Christians so what does Gia do
[41:49] gamea he tries to tell these guys don't
[41:51] kill the
[41:52] Christians brother Ram said he might get
[41:54] eternal life just for doing that
[41:57] that's what brother said he said perhaps
[41:58] remember perhaps Gia and Nicodemus will
[42:01] receive eternal life because they stood
[42:03] for God's people in a difficult
[42:05] time
[42:07] Hallelujah think about the people in
[42:09] your life that have helped you they
[42:10] weren't messeng Believers but think
[42:12] about the people that helped you in your
[42:13] difficult hour God might be giving them
[42:16] eternal
[42:17] life he said give them a little space
[42:21] now remember they've already been
[42:22] arrested twice they already spent a
[42:24] night in prison
[42:28] and now God anoints God anoints gamea
[42:30] and says give them some space don't try
[42:33] to kill
[42:35] them that's one see that's one thing we
[42:37] got to keep in mind if it's our time to
[42:39] go it's our time to go like brother said
[42:42] if it ain't my time to go there's
[42:43] nothing the devil can do to take
[42:45] me I might suffer I might struggle but
[42:48] there's nothing the devil can do if God
[42:49] doesn't want me to go praise
[42:52] God so we just stand on God's word faith
[42:55] was we we can thank God for the time
[42:57] that we have here redeem the time
[42:59] because these days are evil right
[43:07] Hallelujah verse 35 and said to them ye
[43:09] men of Israel take heed to yourselves
[43:11] what you intend to do as touching these
[43:13] men for before these days rose up thas
[43:17] boasting himself to be
[43:19] somebody to whom a number of men about
[43:22] 400 joined themselves who was slain and
[43:24] all As many as obeyed him were scattered
[43:27] and brought to not so here's his
[43:29] wisdom he tells his Jewish friends that
[43:32] got their swords they want to go kill
[43:33] the Christians he said this this
[43:34] Christian move is an uprising but
[43:36] remember there was men that did
[43:38] uprisings
[43:40] before and they came to not they came
[43:42] into the movement killed itself like
[43:44] that's what we're seeing the woke
[43:45] movement right the woke movement really
[43:47] got big in 2020 with the black lives
[43:49] matter movement which did you see what
[43:52] they did they donated millions of
[43:53] dollars and the the owners of the
[43:56] founders of black lives matters didn't
[43:57] give any money back to those communities
[43:59] they went and bought themselves
[44:01] Mansions so it proved it was not a
[44:03] genuine desire to help out people it was
[44:06] a political move for money
[44:09] right so we see
[44:12] that whatever you know they're eating
[44:15] the back to the the woke are eating
[44:16] themselves down now you can never be
[44:17] woke enough right you can never be uh
[44:20] demonic enough demons attack each other
[44:24] that's brother that's where they get War
[44:26] they attack one another they got
[44:28] territories right they want to take
[44:30] people they want to fill people's bodies
[44:32] they attack one another I'm glad
[44:34] Christians love and forgive one another
[44:36] praise God demons tear each other down
[44:38] but Christians we build ourselves up
[44:40] praise God Amen we edify the body in
[44:44] love the Bible says
[44:47] hallelujah there we
[44:49] go now verse 37 and this man rose up
[44:53] Judas of Galilee in the days of taxing
[44:55] and Drew away away much people after him
[44:58] and he perished and all even as many as
[45:01] obeyed him were
[45:02] dispersed so Gia is a real Jewish
[45:05] teacher and he gives two witnesses in
[45:07] the mouth of two or three Witnesses let
[45:08] every word be established so he knows if
[45:11] I get two examples to my Jewish breth
[45:13] that want to kill the Christians I know
[45:14] they'll least
[45:16] considerate so he gives two examples
[45:18] here's two uprisings both both movements
[45:21] died out because it was the wrong
[45:23] motivation right and church don't you
[45:26] know the same thing they're doing in
[45:27] America now with the transvestites and
[45:30] all this trans movement that was already
[45:32] done in China years ago when China went
[45:34] over to this uh communism that's in now
[45:37] that's how they started they had all the
[45:39] teenagers and the the young adults all
[45:41] the men and women cut their hair the
[45:43] same they dressed the same no more men
[45:44] and women's garments they killed all the
[45:47] traditions and they just made everybody
[45:49] like a follower of the state that's what
[45:51] they're trying to do in America this has
[45:52] been done before it's the same demon
[45:55] power Powers but we've got overcoming
[45:58] power it won't touch us hallelujah but
[46:01] what I'm saying is we can see what's
[46:03] going on my wife and I watched the video
[46:05] when we had our uh 20th anniversary
[46:07] getaway watch the video all this that's
[46:09] happening now trans and everything it's
[46:11] already happened that's how they've
[46:14] taken over Nations before but we've got
[46:16] the power of prayer we got the power
[46:19] praying fasting praise God Amen what are
[46:22] we going to sit by and let it happen no
[46:24] we're to stand we're stand with God's
[46:25] word and pray and ask God to change
[46:28] things praise God Amen whatever he
[46:29] changes he
[46:31] changes
[46:32] Hallelujah we can't just sit here and do
[46:34] nothing we've got to call to God call
[46:37] upon God while he's near praise God
[46:43] Amen
[46:45] now verse 38 and now I say to you
[46:47] refrain from these men other words don't
[46:49] kill them and let them alone for if this
[46:51] counsel of this work be a men it will
[46:53] come to
[46:54] not
[46:56] but if it be of God you cannot overthrow
[46:58] it less happy happily you be found even
[47:01] to fight against
[47:05] God so see that's a lot of wisdom from
[47:08] an old Bible teacher a Jewish Bible
[47:10] teacher G that's a lot of wisdom I've
[47:12] seen these movements rise up before if
[47:15] they're really of God you don't want to
[47:16] fight against God but if they're not of
[47:18] God they'll rise up and fall
[47:21] down right rise up and fall
[47:24] down
[47:26] and that's how it is even the message
[47:27] you know different movements have risen
[47:29] up like the seven Thunders the two Souls
[47:31] perusia now the tape Church movement's
[47:34] rising
[47:35] up I just say Let It Go I know it's off
[47:37] the word Let It Go I'm going to see it
[47:39] fall again it's going to fall all their
[47:42] bragging all their boasts and claims let
[47:44] them say whatever they want if it's of
[47:47] God I'm not going to fight against it
[47:48] but I know it can't be of God if you're
[47:50] breaking God's word hallelujah and it'll
[47:53] come to not amen right see that's why
[47:56] each one of us we have to have our own
[47:58] personal experience with God and if
[48:00] we're really in touch with the fivefold
[48:01] ministry The Winds of Doctrine won't
[48:03] move us again we'll stand on the solid
[48:05] rock of the word of God hallelujah amen
[48:08] we're not going anywhere makes me want
[48:10] to sing brother B I shall not be I shall
[48:14] not be
[48:15] moved right just like a tree right
[48:18] planted by the rivers of water I can't
[48:20] be moved I've been around the message uh
[48:23] for 20 almost 23 years now I can't be
[48:26] moved out the truth because I'm founded
[48:27] on the rock of Revelation praise God
[48:30] amen
[48:35] amen by God's
[48:37] grace verse 39 for be of God you cannot
[48:41] overthrow it that's happy you be found
[48:43] even to fight against God that's one
[48:44] thing we don't want to do is fight
[48:45] against God we do not want to speak
[48:47] against God and we don't want to fight
[48:49] against God and even when I you know
[48:51] I've I've taken stands on different
[48:54] topics like the tap Church movement and
[48:55] the goats the goat debate before I've
[48:57] said anything I've waited on God to see
[48:59] what God's word is right and I've
[49:02] searched the scriptures I studied about
[49:04] it I prayed about it I reached out to
[49:06] people to see what kind of spirit they
[49:08] got on
[49:09] it
[49:10] Hallelujah like with brother Billy Paul
[49:12] before he passed I wrote him a letter
[49:13] three years before I passed I said Billy
[49:15] Paul brother Jose I ever give you a copy
[49:17] of that letter okay I said brother
[49:19] here's five things you got you and
[49:21] Joseph are wrong on and please correct
[49:23] me if I'm wrong and the the brother
[49:25] although he's fast I'm sure we love him
[49:28] I love him but he never even would
[49:30] address one of the one of the five
[49:32] things okay now if I was working for
[49:36] Austin was working for me training my
[49:38] dog I said brother Austin I want you to
[49:41] do these five things and Austin didn't
[49:42] do those five things how would I feel or
[49:45] if Austin told me it was training me to
[49:46] train my dog let's say I had a dog I
[49:48] would have a dog I never have a dog
[49:51] maybe some actually I would say never
[49:53] but if Austin said brother Jess you need
[49:54] to do five things and next week come
[49:56] back make sure you do these five things
[49:57] with your what if I come back and say
[49:59] Austin how you
[50:01] doing and I I don't even talk about the
[50:03] five things what kind of customer do you
[50:05] think I would be what kind of customer
[50:06] would I be not not not his customer and
[50:10] see you can't be God's fivefold Ministry
[50:13] if you don't obey God's word hallelujah
[50:16] I can show you five and now it's 24
[50:17] things if I can show you 24 things wrong
[50:19] and you won't even address one
[50:20] something's wrong with
[50:22] that if my wife said brother Jesse
[50:25] you've done these 24 things can you fix
[50:27] these 24 things at our house can you and
[50:30] if I just say how you doing honey the
[50:33] next day you feeling okay today what do
[50:35] you want to do today I asked you to do
[50:37] these 24 things can you please address
[50:39] one of them and that's what it is and
[50:42] that reminds me of the the parable of
[50:45] that man when when he come in with no
[50:48] wedding garment they said where's your
[50:50] wedding garment and he didn't say
[50:51] nothing that's what reminds me brother
[50:53] Jose I ask these brothers here's 24
[50:55] things you li on what's your answer and
[50:57] they don't say nothing it shows they're
[50:59] wrong to my opinion of it but see if
[51:02] we're on the rock of the word and storms
[51:05] come and questions come they don't move
[51:07] us they don't blow down our house they
[51:08] don't destroy our testimony we keep
[51:10] standing we keep testifying that there
[51:12] is a true God hallelujah there's a true
[51:15] message there's a true Bible there's a
[51:16] true Holy Spirit and we've got it praise
[51:19] God amen amen
[51:22] amen I've seen him in his power I've
[51:24] seen him in his glor praise God to my
[51:27] experiences I believe it with all my
[51:30] heart we're going through these Seasons

[51:45] good point brother Perry green brought
[51:46] up you might remember this Jose brother
[51:49] Perry green didn't like the church age
[51:50] book I don't know why I keep going back
[51:51] to Bar Green he's a good he's a good man
[51:54] we talk about him
[51:57] um there's a part of the church age book
[51:59] that says uh the elect cannot persecute
[52:02] the elect remember that but then per
[52:04] green brought it out King Saul
[52:06] persecuted
[52:08] David wasn't King Saul saved yes he was
[52:11] saved after he died David wrote a song
[52:13] about
[52:14] him what he was so mighty he lyia he won

[52:18] first two battles again was it the
[52:20] amalekites the ammonites the Philistines

[52:25] what David remembered he wrough Mighty
[52:28] testimonies I just read through it but I
[52:29] couldn't remember the exact names I just

[52:35] testimonies when he was young and on
[52:36] fire for God Amen God help us Amen to

[53:02] complex the people won't receive my
[53:04] message so I don't want to go out and
[53:05] preach to them anymore he actually
[53:06] shared that now what would you feel like
[53:08] if I come to church and I said I've got
[53:10] a complex with
[53:12] everybody you're not doing what I told
[53:14] you to do I'm not going to preach

[53:29] we admire him because we see Christ in
[53:30] him amen he's overcoming he's overcoming

[53:35] he's saying this is my fault this is
[53:37] something I got to overcome and I love
[53:39] God always comes in and saves him from
[53:40] doing he was going to go he was going to
[53:41] move away from Jeffersonville and move
[53:43] up into the mountains and not even
[53:45] preach anymore but the Holy Ghost said
[53:46] if you do that you'll be a bum and your
[53:48] wife will leave you I love that how God
[53:50] will protect us from the plans we make
[53:53] and that's why I love the Bible says I
[53:54] know the plans that I have for you plans
[53:56] of peace and an expected end praise God
[54:00] hallelujah brother had his own plans but
[54:02] God said no you're keeping my plans amen
[54:05] hallelujah right we all get plans I'm
[54:07] going to do this because I'm upset or
[54:09] I'm frustrated or I'm depressed I'm
[54:10] going to go do that and God said no
[54:11] that's the wrong plans you're keeping my
[54:14] plans
[54:18] Hallelujah do not want to fight against
[54:20] God Amen want to fight for God and if
[54:23] I'm fighting for this word I know I'm
[54:24] fighting for
[54:26] Christ these men and women didn't die in
[54:29] vain to give us this
[54:31] Bible men and women didn't die for the
[54:33] Bible so we could make brother's tapes
[54:35] thus sayi the Lord every single word on
[54:36] there men and women didn't die for this
[54:38] Bible for that
[54:39] purpose we believe the truth on the
[54:41] tapes but we're not here to worship
[54:43] tapes verse
[54:45] 40 and to him they agreed and when they
[54:47] had called the apostles and beaten them
[54:49] so see now now the devil gets permission
[54:52] you can beat them but don't take their
[54:54] lives I wonder how many punches they
[54:56] took brother Austin how many kicks did
[54:58] they take once they're down how many
[55:00] kicks did they take they get
[55:02] beaten and at some point while they're
[55:05] kicking them just the Holy Ghost will
[55:07] come the angel would come down and say
[55:09] that's
[55:10] enough that's
[55:12] enough how many how many would be
[55:14] willing to suffer that for Christ get
[55:15] beat up for Christ and notice Church
[55:17] they didn't fight back America we got
[55:19] the right to fight back we got guns too
[55:21] which you can do that if you're LED do
[55:23] it Hallelujah def even the Jews had uh
[55:27] ability to defend themselves but this
[55:29] was an ordained experience they're
[55:31] arrested they're getting
[55:33] beaten do you remember Brother s that
[55:36] Russian brother that would come here did
[55:38] you know he was arrested in uh Russia do
[55:41] you know that he was beaten he was tied
[55:44] up for I think about two or three days
[55:46] all because he was a Christian and then
[55:48] some that's why he loves this message he
[55:51] was there a couple Saturdays when or
[55:52] Sundays when I went over Junction City
[55:54] after service all he want to do is sit
[55:56] around and play guitar and sing all
[55:58] those good old songs I'm one of
[56:00] them he's been arrested he's been beaten
[56:03] for this
[56:04] message and he's still standing for it I
[56:07] like a man like that don't you that's
[56:09] why he says brother Jesse you want to
[56:10] come preach these people remember I told
[56:12] you I really tired I didn't want to go
[56:14] have to drive all that but I went anyway
[56:15] and God blessed
[56:16] it that's why I respect that guy that
[56:19] that brother sge said well just I think
[56:22] God's calling you to teach those people
[56:23] I said okay brother you say so I'm a
[56:26] little tired you know that was last a
[56:28] that was last March almost a year now
[56:29] brother I'm a little tired I'm a little
[56:31] worn out but okay if you feel that
[56:33] brother I I'll pray about
[56:35] it a man that
[56:38] suffered beaten and imagine imaginea
[56:41] Austin disappears for three days you're
[56:42] like what are you going to call me what
[56:44] you you probably say say overnight at
[56:46] our house

[56:52] and all of a sudden I show up I'm beaten
[56:54] I got bruised but I'm thankful for
[56:57] Jesus that happened in Russia I think it
[56:59] was like 15 or 20 years ago that's why
[57:01] they
[57:02] moved now they got a little church there
[57:04] in Columbus now he's not a pastor but
[57:06] there's two guys that kind of do the
[57:07] work he doesn't feel like a pastor but
[57:09] see that's the same thing today Jesus
[57:11] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[57:12] forever if God lets you get beat up he
[57:15] know you'll overcome it praise God it'll
[57:17] be for a testimony now that gives me
[57:19] courage if that man can stand there and
[57:21] sing in Russian and if he can preach in
[57:23] Russian and that gives me courage if he
[57:26] can do it I can do it praise God am cuz
[57:28] he suffered way more than
[57:30] me way more so if he's got courage to do
[57:33] it I'll stand right by his side praise
[57:34] God amen amen I'll support the work that
[57:36] God's doing
[57:38] there and remember how they remember how
[57:40] they even started church that brother
[57:42] sge wanted to build a house so he
[57:44] reached out to the Amish community they
[57:46] weren't even message
[57:48] Believers and they I think they buil him
[57:50] a house or I I forget maybe they built
[57:51] him a barn I can't remember what it was
[57:54] house or a barn but through that he met
[57:56] brother Levi who had shared the message
[57:58] and then Levi went and shared the
[58:00] message with that church down there in
[58:01] Junction City and that's when they come
[58:03] out into the message see even in your
[58:06] little things like housing or clothes or
[58:08] cars or grocery shopping even in those
[58:11] things even you would think well God
[58:13] don't care about my barn God don't yes
[58:15] God does care about it amen right we
[58:18] don't want to be selfish or you know we
[58:20] don't want to be L to seeing but if we
[58:21] need a barn we need a barn right I need
[58:25] these things and God is even in the
[58:27] midst of all that Hallelujah then God
[58:29] just called me to be a part of it by
[58:30] God's grace
[58:31] amen but it's it's God's work it's God's
[58:34] church amen and God is building his
[58:37] church
[58:42] Hallelujah they beat them they command
[58:44] them they should not speak in the name
[58:45] of Jesus and let them
[58:48] go and they departed from the presence
[58:50] of the council rejoicing that they were
[58:53] counted worthy to suffer shame for his
[58:56] name what a
[58:57] test after you're beat up you're
[59:02] happy we go to tawo we get beat up a
[59:04] little bit might be a little happy after
[59:07] that but this is a whole another thing
[59:09] you get beat up by guards soldiers and
[59:13] you leave there rejoicing as you're
[59:14] leaving and maybe your ribs you maybe
[59:16] have a broken rib and it hurts that
[59:18] happened one time I got punched at I no
[59:19] I had to get a broken rib because I
[59:20] couldn't breathe right for months it
[59:22] just hurt ouch master great
[59:25] action but these guys are beaten and as
[59:28] they're beaten as they're leading
[59:29] they're rejoicing thank God I could
[59:31] suffer for his name may God help us have
[59:33] that kind of Faith next time we go
[59:36] through a trial say thank you Jesus I
[59:37] could suffer for your name praise God
[59:40] someone cussed me out or someone flipped
[59:42] me off or somebody spoke bad about me or
[59:44] somebody doesn't want to talk to me
[59:45] anymore all for your sake thank God I
[59:47] can suffer for your sake praise
[59:53] God remember even speaking even somebody
[59:56] speaking a word against your name get
[59:58] you get you reward in heaven remember
[1:00:00] that Jesus said leap for
[1:00:03] Joy when somebody speaks bad about you
[1:00:06] because your reward is great in heaven
[1:00:08] let's read that I'm going to look that
[1:00:09] up in my Bible I just kind of came to
[1:00:18] me there only six new testament times of
[1:00:21] leap so it's really really easy to find
[1:00:24] Luke 6:22 blessed are ye when men shall
[1:00:27] hate you and when they shall separate
[1:00:29] you from their company and shall
[1:00:30] reproach you and cast out your name as
[1:00:33] evil for the son of man's sake I had all
[1:00:35] kinds of people do that in Liberty
[1:00:36] Center when I first got saved and come
[1:00:37] in the message I had there was three or
[1:00:40] four guys in high school that got saved
[1:00:42] because I got saved but once I got the
[1:00:44] message then they call me a
[1:00:47] devil right so what did Jesus say you're
[1:00:52] blessed when that
[1:00:53] happens Hallelujah I won't worship their
[1:00:56] denominational Creeds I'm blessed
[1:00:58] because I believe the word of God next
[1:01:00] verse so in that day he said leap I'm
[1:01:03] going to LEAP again ready I'm going to
[1:01:05] leap for Joy again
[1:01:07] Hallelujah behold your reward is great
[1:01:10] in heaven just if they say something
[1:01:11] about it about your name oh Naomi and
[1:01:15] beus they're Holy Rollers they're goody
[1:01:18] two shoes the Bible said rejoice in that
[1:01:21] day because they spoke against your name
[1:01:23] because you're not living your name
[1:01:25] you're Liv in the Name of Christ
[1:01:26] Hallelujah there's my hour you're stand
[1:01:28] it for Jesus great is your reward in
[1:01:31] heaven when people just won't associate
[1:01:33] you or say well he's he's blasphemed or
[1:01:36] that's what they said about
[1:01:38] me those friends called that Pillar of
[1:01:40] Fire with brother R my friends called
[1:01:42] that
[1:01:43] Satan and I said God have mercy on
[1:01:47] them one of the guys that said that his
[1:01:49] wife got a pretty got L disease pretty
[1:01:52] bad not sure not long after that I don't
[1:01:55] know I'm just like I like I told you
[1:01:56] even when uh that home church back home
[1:01:59] when they said thus sayi the Lord
[1:02:00] serpent seed of the devil and they went
[1:02:01] through that season of divorce a season
[1:02:03] of funerals my M called it a season of
[1:02:06] death I just look at those things I'm
[1:02:08] not saying it's exactly uh you know A
[1:02:10] and B I'm not saying it's because of
[1:02:12] that but it sure looks like it is
[1:02:14] because I don't want to fight against
[1:02:16] God and I know the word of God and the
[1:02:18] word of God is true and we've got
[1:02:20] answers in the word of God we've got
[1:02:21] truth in the word of God we've got joy
[1:02:23] in the word of God we've got victory in
[1:02:25] the word of God we got freedom in the
[1:02:26] word of God we've got a new life in the
[1:02:28] word of God hallelujah
[1:02:31] amen Le for Joy brother sister leap for
[1:02:36] Joy when people speak evil you sister
[1:02:39] iser that reminds me of that text you
[1:02:40] God that sometimes family members might
[1:02:41] be upset with you for certain reasons
[1:02:43] remember that leave for Joy
[1:02:46] sister they speak evil of you praise God
[1:02:50] Jo Hallelujah
[1:02:53] why
[1:02:55] because in like manner they did that to
[1:02:57] the fathers the prophets all down to the
[1:03:00] ages God's people have always been
[1:03:01] ridiculed mocked made fun of in this
[1:03:04] case in Acts 5 they're
[1:03:06] beaten kicked and punched and they leave
[1:03:09] there rejoicing thank God I can suffer
[1:03:11] some reproach for the name of
[1:03:14] Jesus remember we got to know him both
[1:03:16] in the power's
[1:03:17] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:03:21] sufferings glory
[1:03:25] verse 42 we'll close with this and daily
[1:03:28] in the temple and in every house they
[1:03:30] cease not to teach and preach Jesus
[1:03:33] Christ let stand our Mal will be let you
[1:03:37] come up here Mal be back in a
[1:03:40] moment they get meet
[1:03:42] up they're rejoicing on their way back
[1:03:45] and they said we're not stopping
[1:03:47] teaching and preaching about Jesus
[1:03:49] Christ we will not stop so no matter
[1:03:52] what we go through church we're not
[1:03:53] going to stop serving
[1:03:56] Christ and if God let something awful
[1:03:58] happen like brother van Z's dad passing
[1:04:02] even in that we can see the mercy of
[1:04:05] God no matter what we may go through no
[1:04:07] matter the questions we might have we
[1:04:09] know God is merciful god is gracious God
[1:04:12] had it all planned out
[1:04:15] Hallelujah whatever we must suffer for
[1:04:18] the name of Jesus Christ let's do it
[1:04:20] with that
[1:04:22] understanding that wow God has bless me
[1:04:24] so much that I can suffer for being a
[1:04:27] Christian I can struggle just for the
[1:04:29] sake of knowing Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ Hallelujah I believe Church you
[1:04:34] know I believe that and I could be wrong
[1:04:35] I hope I'm wrong with this but I believe
[1:04:36] 2024 maybe a year or something strange
[1:04:39] might happen like
[1:04:42] 2020 we might have to suffer I don't
[1:04:44] know I have to suffer for being
[1:04:46] Christians I don't know remember it was
[1:04:48] out remember I was out in uh California
[1:04:50] they shut them down from going to church
[1:04:52] it didn't happen here well we were a big
[1:04:54] church so we could still come to
[1:04:57] church but in California they literally
[1:05:00] shut down
[1:05:03] churches so see that was the last
[1:05:06] squeeze right on this birth pains what's
[1:05:09] going to come next with the next
[1:05:10] election because these people in power
[1:05:12] they don't want to lose power they'll do
[1:05:13] anything to stay in power they'll kill
[1:05:15] they'll let all those millions of people
[1:05:16] that died of Co they did that on purpose
[1:05:19] to keep their
[1:05:21] power brother Ram said we know prophecy
[1:05:23] it's coming to this age and I'm I'm not
[1:05:25] a fearmonger you know me I'm not a
[1:05:26] fearmonger but we got to be ready if it
