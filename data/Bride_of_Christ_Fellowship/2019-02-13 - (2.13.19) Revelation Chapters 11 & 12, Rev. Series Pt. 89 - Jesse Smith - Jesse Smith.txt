this song hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus praise the Lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh he's alone let's take our Bibles here let's go to Revelation chapter 11 like to look at a couple more chapters tonight or willing we look at Revelation chapter 11 and chapter 12 revelation 11 here chapter 11 verse 1 such as reverses 1 & 2 par me praise the Lord revelation 11 1 & 2 verse 1 and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles for the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months now I just had that thought let's go to Luke 21 here she reminds me a little scripture I read I believe yesterday Luke 21:24 I believe yes now what's striking is that this was spoken 2000 years ago and it's still being fulfilled and will shortly come to pass maybe in our lifetime maybe in the next maybe the one after that we don't know it's amazing that Jesus Christ's words are still rock solid amen every word he said still being fulfilled praise God verse 24 let's read this one together on three Luke 21:24 one two three and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled amen let's have a word of prayer for everything on your heart just make it under to God here tonight imagine I'll be doing teaching but of course the Holy Spirit come down here and minister to other needs outside of this teaching text here Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord God who are your servants we just want your will to be done Heavenly Father or we love you and we love your word father there's nothing we love more than your word worshipping you singing to you Lord sitting here in heavenly places for this is a foretaste of the glory divine Lord God that will experience shortly we believe dear God we believe your coming is near we know it we don't know when but we know it's it's nearer than when your prophet was here on the scene speaking with us say at the Lord so god help us to make ourselves ready Lord as we sing that song trim our lamps Lord God give us back to our first love Lord God father may you be glorified here tonight in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you didn't see the praise the Lord well I didn't know it was Beatrice the birthday this week so it's giving around flaws praise the Lord I guess it was written in here I didn't I didn't check it in here so let me take just a moment here February 12th yesterday okay well Lord bless you sister and we sure appreciate you a bed hallelujah it's just so nice you can be here you know the Lord has certainly directed your path and you've just been a real godly example to everybody so thank you sister you should appreciate how you love your family and you love the Lord just though you're almost very special person you're a child of the King and we're glad to have this time with you praise the Lord so I have just a few slides here and then we'll look at these two chapters here by the grace of the Lord someone look at these two chapters done here tonight and then that will catch us up a little bit to finishing it's been my goal and desire to preach the whole book of Revelation so I get through these two I'll be over halfway done by the grace of Lord so it's nice to see the landmarks along the way praise the Lord and of course as we read last week you know this is what brother Branham wished he could have done he said he could have wished he could took four months in a row and just preached straight through he said all the revelations and the book of Revelation he said would have been a little heaven to him so this is a little heaven for us I'm about you but after all the trials of the world and all the battles of the day this is a little heaven to me I hope it is to you as well being in the presence of the Lord Jesus and with the Saints here so I'm skipping ahead let me get to my notes here okay here we are now just remember if there's any chapter if there's any questions you have on these chapters as we go through please you know send me a text or send me an email and we had brother Johnny his family here last time we turn on revelation 10 and he came out of service saying that was wonderful brother Jesse says we just love the teaching there and he said you know so often you know I don't know what's going on in every church but he said so often you know preachers will just preach and they'll shout know yell but they don't really get maybe to teach in things so that really encouraged me you know that we just want to we want to understand you know if someone asks you a question isn't a blessing to be able to say well you know the Bible says right here you know you know sisters can have words of knowledge too you know gifts of knowledge right just because the sister shares the scripture doesn't mean she's preaching on it right so there there is little gifts in there too and so we thank the Lord for that and I feel just brought that back to me Luke 21:24 so let's go back there Jesus is actually teaching or prophesying on titus coming in verse 23 he said but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there should be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people he was speaking of Titus coming remember Titus surrounded them and I think starved him out basically he starved him out and then he went in and slaughtered him and Josephus said it was awful it's like rivers of blood were pouring out of the temple down the temple steps you know it was just it was just awful and so jesus said woe to them you know he said he said as soon as you see those armies he said run to the mountains he said don't look back don't take anything just to run and Josephus also said by history there was not one Holy Ghost field Christian or he called him Christians there was no Christians in the city when Titus did that because Jesus had warned them about that and Titus said they were out three or four years before I'm sorry Josephus said the Christians were out three or four years before Titus even came because Jesus they took the heed of Jesus and said that destruction Jesus knew and told them destruction was coming so you must flee and so all the Christians got out before destruction came and that's a beautiful type Church that every age God has not given his children over to wrath or judgment God has had mercy on his children you can take that all the way back there Enoch was three generations before the flood came Enoch walked with God and God took him off the earth and even Noah who's a type of the foolish virgin even God spared him from the wrath of God did he hear the shouting probably did he hear the screams and the blood-curdling cries probably but he himself found grace in the sight of the Lord and that's what I believe will happen to the foolish version during the tribulation because remember the Bible said there's coming an hour of temptation where they're gonna lay down the mark of the beast and all those who won't take it will have to be killed right because they cannot buy or sell so I personally believe that's what's going to happen the foolish virgin have to give their lives at the beginning of the Great Tribulation and they won't maybe see the seven trumpets or the seven vials or the three woes perhaps they won't see that because they're going to get stamped stamped out or stomped out at the beginning because that fits the type Noah had to go through it and suffer a little bit and feel the pressures of it here the rain for 40 days I wonder are we ever going to get to go through the pressure of it but maybe not suffer like the rest of them and so I just believe that seems to fit the pattern of God's Word look at Lotte he's a foolish virgin did he feel the heat maybe behind of Sodom no doubt but God even had mercy on him and so it be merciful for the foolish virgin to die when the marks being laid down to be merciful them to die there rather than have to go through the trumpets as we saw a few weeks ago and run into caves and you can't die or to be hunted down by scorpions for five months and you can't die there's there's no way to do it because of insanity and and the spiritual condition that'll be over the people at that time there'll be no holy spirit can you imagine the mind battles you'd have without the Holy Spirit right because there's no more you know what once he once he pulls that it's gone from the Gentiles the spirits gone and now it's gone all back to Israel back to the Jews so it's it's an awful time but Jesus tells them about this and warns them and in every age God had mercy amen God had mercy on the true believer now look at verse 24 again let's go back again Luke 21:24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and should be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled what up you know what a prophecy here the Gentiles we're gonna have control over Jerusalem until their time is fulfilled and they still have it you know the Dome of the rock is still there I've never been to Jerusalem but I see it on pictures all the time the Dome of the rock is still there the Muslim shrine is still there the Gentiles control that area for the most part that tent that Temple Mount right and Jesus said it's going to be that way until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled now we all got excited when when the president said you know he's bringing the embassy back to Jerusalem that's a good sign it looks like it's getting closer looks like we're getting closer but now heading back with this in mind when you head back to revelation 11 this is one time brother Branham said the sat the Lord twice he said about Israel as I preached a few years ago there's two times he said thus saith the Lord about Israel he said thus saith the Lord Israel will rebuild their temple he said it's thus saith the Lord according to the Bible and that's where we start here revelation 11 verse 1 there's given John a reed like a rod that angel said rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein now isn't it something God give that rod to a preacher to measure and just see what is the size of this and and how what examine the people doesn't that fit the spiritual the spiritual thing of what God does doesn't God give the ability of a preacher to kind of see the congregation understand their size and and where they are aren't you glad God does that God doesn't preach half of your preacher or the pastor or preachers preach way over your heads you can't understand it if they do maybe they got off the spirit one day but they know it they out they understand the condition of the church and able to minister right to it and see if we're measuring us to see where we measure to the things of God that's right but look John is given the measuring stick for this and notice the Bible said the temple of God is built so revelation 11 the temples now rebuilt it's not rebuilt right now so this is something that's going to happen we believe soon maybe in our lifetime Church if it gets started pretty soon you're gonna see all of us well if you're not dancing I'll be dancing all over this church because the Bible said the Gentiles will control that until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled we don't know if they're going to start building it before the rapture or right after the rapture I'd imagine before that's what I believe and I believe that because here John sees em and he sees Pete in the in the court or the temple rather worshiping their worshipping and their Jews right so they will be killing animals for three and a half years while the two prophets are ministering them they'll be killing animals and worshiping there in the temple I believe for three and a half years and then at the end of that after they see the rapture then Jesus comes back where the man says in the church age book so if God leaves the Gentiles that spirit goes off them and it goes on the Jews to get everything right with the law and the word I would imagine if they're gonna worship there they'd have to have that temple already built wouldn't that encourage your faith if you see the temple being rebuilt and the Muslim Dome it'd have to be demolished I'm not sure I'm not sure how maybe yeah maybe the Israelite government will do that I don't know maybe they'll destroy it I'm not sure but the Jesus Christ said it'll be trodden down of the Gentiles until the Gentile dispensation is over I don't understand why people can say there's no dispensation as there's no dispensation in the Bible there is Jesus Christ says it right here there's times of the Gentiles God as a dispensationalist amen God gives a time God gives a season the Bible said to everything there's given a time and season amen there's given a time and season where this prayer is gonna be answered there's another time a season when another prayer is gonna be answered amen we've just gotta have patience and endure the times and seasons and let God work everything out so God gets all the glory amen you know we always get we always you know say how Dave you know try to do God a service without being his will and that's true he did that and use use that lost his life remember he was only three months off the right season a church I know some bad things happen there the man lost his life but he was only off three months now what if we could only be all three months what if we're only three months off from the rapture wouldn't that be a pretty good thing I would think so not that we're trying to guess but what I'm trying to say is that we should be so close in God's presence and so close in our walk with the Lord that we should feel it's almost the time it's almost the season praise God you only missed it by three months ah and that's what we're saying here he was feeling I need a new gotta service I need to bring this Ark back I need to do this i nee and he only missed it by three months that's pretty good if you ask me I don't know about you that'd be pretty good three months now look at this year they have a temple and most one they have an altar and they have worship going on ah verse 2 but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles so see the the altar there the holy place and the place of the Gentiles will have to get under control that's why I believe there have to build the temple there of the green build that back but then they're still gonna have a court of the Gentiles like they did in the days of Herod King Herod they had a court of the Gentiles that was the big court on the outside and then they had the holy place right then after the court of women and the court of the Jews and then they had the holy place and the host of Holies but God but God tells him here so even in the time of the tribulation the Gentiles will have this Opera court of the Gentiles he said don't measure that he's to just measure the part that the Jews are gonna worship it ain't hey they're gonna get their temple back they're gonna get their altar back they're gonna get their worker back its thus saith the Lord according to the Bible right first woman to don't measure that part for its giving of the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months that's forty two months is three half years right 36 months is three years and then you have the half okay now that's verses 1 & 2 now that's the major theme right here is the Jewish temple of God is being rebuilt now verse 3 is where we we see now these two witnesses these two prophets Moses and Elijah we believe it could of course be just two men that the spirit upon them but I believe it'll be the two men now verse three and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth so three and a half years and it even tells us what kind of clothes they're gonna wear sackcloth it isn't gonna be silk garments like all these priests and prophets and evangelical charismatic Pentecostal rich guys right sangmi silk garments it's gonna be sack cloth praise God they're gonna be humble they're gonna look humble they're not gonna look rich and famous they're not going to be a prosperity gospel they're gonna be of the original gospel that's right they're gonna be humble but they're mean filled with power praise God amen verse three now verse 4 these are the two trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth like this verse 5 and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed now brother man tells us in the fifth seal he says this is not literal fire he said it's the word so there speak the word and it's going to come out like fire the word is going to burn like fire it's in other words it's going to take effect whatever the prophets said it's going to come to pass that's right and this is a perfect time to lay trim remind us of that scripture where David said touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm see right right now God is so merciful right church that people can speak against brother Branham they can blaspheme brother Branham and nothing happens to him seemingly you I've seen videos where people have blasting God and said if there's a God in heaven strike me dead now they just keep living see God is so merciful right now I don't then don't misunderstand me they're gonna suffer and pay for that eventually every either word spoken will be given account of but here at this time there's no more mercy amen there's no more mercy it's like going back to the law right and so if anybody harms one of those two prophets they are power of the word to speak it and judge them right there and harm them if they try to harm God's servants all right and people today don't understand how much mercy there is but there's mercy for you and I thank God for that now I just want to read this quote here to you from questions answers on the seals according to the opening of the fifth seal Moses and Elijah have to die what about Enoch he said I don't know if I don't know I'm just going to tell you I don't know I don't know all the answers folks I just want to read this because my man tells us he doesn't know everything I don't know and if I don't know I'm gonna tell you I don't know if I do know I won't tell you till I know see but I don't know I'll often wonder that myself there was a knock I see Moses come and Elijah comes back and they're killed see but now Enoch was translated before time I've often wondered their thought and wondered myself well what what about that but then here's the only consolation I can say is this that now notice Moses only serve God 40 years see he was 120 but twenty years the first 40 I mean he was getting his education the second 40 God was taking it out of him and the third 40 he served God but Enoch walked five hundred years before God was blameless see so Moses comes back to serve some more time him and Elijah sober man thinks it'll actually be Moses and Elijah the two men to come back from heaven right because they came down from heaven to meet Jesus I'm out Transfiguration they got raptured back up right and then they come down again my man says to be those same people so they can serve God a little longer on this earth they meant see every for every true believer whether your desire just more time to serve the Lord just do something for the Lord that's why I love getting up in the morning yeah I'm tired sometimes yeah I'm a little cranky sometimes but when I finally wake up all I want to do is do something more for the Lord I'm gonna keep my health I'm gonna keep serving God better so that I can do more and share the light of Christ with more people that more people might know that I believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever I know most people are going to reject it I know most people who stomp it underfoot and trot it down and you know feel like we're casting our pearls before swine many times like we talked about last it may feel like that but also they're got the answer and as and I'll be a witness that I try to share Jesus Christ with them hallelujah so Bob Arum says I think Moses and Elijah will have a little more time and he says I don't know everything now the reason one reason I read that of course that dealt with Moses and Elijah was because I saw a quote this week where our friends from Jefferson mill are using a quote where brother Ham says if you need any answers they're on the tape so see they take this quote and they make it sound like every single answer is on the tape but you've got to balance that quote out and you got to take it into context well the brand is referring to something that he's they're asking him there that answers on the tape but brother Branham says he doesn't know all the answers so see how slick and sly the enemy is he'll try to twist one quote and say well all the answers are on the tape well that's true for your that question but every answer to every Bible question was not on the tape because God doesn't let any man know all the answers only Christ and even then Christ doesn't know the day or the hour of his coming as far as his natural flesh does the spear inside of him no yes cuz that's God's Spirit right but the flesh destruction this flesh body does not know because it's under constraints right it's under limitations it's still a human body right and so I just want to balance that out so you know and just show how humble brother Adam was program never beaten meat himself on the chest like some people now I don't know who does it but I'm not calling anybody out but some people beat themselves on the chest to make it sound like they have all the answers well brother branham never was like that go see they say they follow brother Graham but they don't have the same spirit as brother branham are you think and that's just the Holy Spirit the spirit of humility now I want to go to this one too now I don't say that's right now look he even says I don't even say that's right about Moses and Elijah see I'm just giving you my thought just to say what part I don't know I really can't tell you what what happened there or what God will do now why can't people see this why can't they see that every word is not the state the Lord why can't they see that he's not God he doesn't have all the answers see now they asked him the next question what's the name that will be on the people of revelation 3:12 Jesus said I'm gonna give you a new name said I don't know he said give them a new name I don't know what it is see it'll be probably may know when we get there but I don't know what it is now see he's gonna do that see he give them a new name that they just know they themselves see all right let me go back to her so two questions in a row the Prophet tells you I don't know and I don't know because God hasn't let me know yet so just something real simple but I want to make sure I lay that in there because this week I heard that quote and people are using it the same well every answer is on the tape just press play don't get me wrong there's a lot of great answers on the tape some of all the answers everything I'm preaching that you know today about revelation 11 and 12 is all I got from the tape everything okay but they're trying to make it say like every single answer to every single question is on the tape and that's not true that's not true because the brother branham said that now let's go to revelation 11 let's keep going here now verse sixth here verse 6 is where we see that it makes it seem like this will be Moses and Elijah because the ministries match let me pull the scripture there all right 6 these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy that's first King 17 1 remember that was Elijah's first recorded miracle he said thus saith the Lord do or water will not fall from the heavens until I call for it right and it lasted for three and a half years see so that matches the spirit of Elijah and have power over waters to turn them to blood that's Exodus 7 19 when Moses did that by the leadership of the Holy Spirit to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will so whenever anyone tries to attack them they've got the word so since they're not in the days of grace uh since they're not the days the Gentile dispensation God gives them that power to protect themselves praise the Lord and they can just protect themselves with the word now the same thing is true for us spiritually we can just speak the word and it'll protect us we may have to suffer who may go through trials but the word we got to speak the word hang on to the word it's going to take effect praise God speak the way they've God but they have that literal instant right instant power if any man harms and they speak the word takes care of it these are mighty men of God mighty men of God by the Holy Spirit of course not by their own power so see verse 6 matches the ministry of Moses and Elijah verse 7 and when they shall finish their testimony so this is three and a half years so this finishes the last half of Daniels 70th week the last three half years the first half of the 70th week was already fulfilled in Jesus ministry there's only three and a half left or a second half of that 70th year so when that finishes that that's the end of Daniel 70 weeks verse seven the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them so this beast must be Satan himself right so it must be all Satan's power this this Antichrist spirit or whatever is whether it's a separate spirit or Satan himself besa sends out and and then God allows these two servants to die now think of a think how humble that is for three and a half years they can keep everybody off them but then God allows them to die because God's gonna do something great coming up hey I didn't praise God gods do something great and people might look and say no doubt that means as Microsoft they lost their power haha they lost their gifts and God's saying just wait three and a half days right they're gonna be mocking and making fun look good they did and look over to spit on them in the file of my new out cards evil things but God always gets the last say praise the Lord see sin is only pleasurable for a season a shortened in a season but God will have the final word on everything that's right Church amen see he makes war against them and shall overcome them and kill them so God still lets them go through experience a humble death now Moses already died once but that would be Elijah's first time dying right if it is the actual man Elijah which I believe it will be because that would be enough to influence Israel to see my here's the man that wrote the law of Moses and here's the one that prophesied all the Israel and called fire down from heaven this has got to be right how can we deny the very one that gave us the law and the very one that vindicated the law to us now verse eight and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of that great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified Jerusalem right Jerusalem where our Lord was crucified in that striking there a spiritual Sodom in that striking there not a physical Sodom there a spiritual Sodom which of course they were given over to abominations so Israel and the spiritual sense had been given over to abominations right and Israel the spiritual sense would have been guilty of much idolatry which was guilty of greed idolatry so this city was given over to spiritual Sodom sodomy and abomination it was given over to idolatry and God calls that lovely city he calls it spiritual Sodom and Gomorrah oh but wait - that new heaven and earth comes down amen he's going to say this ain't the old Jerusalem this is the New Jerusalem Amen Holly and then she'll be called faithful and chosen hahaha amen no more Sodom and no more Egypt but she's faithful now praise God because Christ's bride will be living there and this 144,000 and his eunuchs praise God right all the broad members and then all the bride servants praise God they'll all be living at holy New Jerusalem praise the Lord oh my thank you Lord so their dead bodies lie there verse 9 and they're the people and Kindred's and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and should not suffer their dead bodies to be put in the graves now let me I want to look at a few notes I wrote down here make sure I got everything here that was verse feel like I am missing something here okay yeah verse nine now did you catch it nations how our nations going to see dead bodies now this is where brother man tells us he said you got to read between the lines on this verse this here shows the power of the internet and television right this is where you can read between the lines o nations are going to see this and then they're gonna send gifts to each other within three and a half days well they couldn't do that in the days of the Lord Jesus right you couldn't send a gift you wouldn't send somebody you go deliver it because they live right down the street right if you said it it wouldn't get there in three-and-a-half days right so this shows it has to be a future time when there's instant communication and quick gift-giving so you can get an Amazon in two days right so this is three half days that's plenty of time for Amazon to get the gifts there if they're still going during the Tribulation Period I'd imagine right the Bible said they should draw them up upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth mine so it's complete torment these men brother band said they're gonna interrupt nature right they're gonna it's not going to rain they're gonna turn water to blood they're gonna call plagues as often as they want they're gonna see they're gonna power to kill any enemy that comes against them and it's going to be torment to the people of Jerusalem the unbelievers now not the Redman not the hundred forty-four thousand but it's going to be tormenting them see isn't that what the world is don't don't no sinners hate Jews they still hate Jews right sinners still hate Jews the majority of people despise the Jews and so when they see it on TV for three and a half years these men in sackcloth that every now and then they'll probably go back these holy rollers and look what they're doing and look at the ruckus they're causing and they'll make them look bad they'll make them look bad for three and a half years they'll rejoice that these men have died the world will rejoice because they're tormenting them but they're commissioned by God to do it well where's all the love why are there preaching love weren't they preaching mercy because the days of mercy are over they had their chance that had received mercy today's the day of mercy praise God today's the day to see that the Roman Catholic Church is full of wickedness and adult and murders and abortions and abuse today is a day to see that that's right today's there's a to see that America's filled with evil murderous spirit murdering babies today's are there to see that today's the day the repent is that right today's a day but when since once the brides gone there's no more time today's a mercy or over its torment time today's the day to cry out to God for those things hallelujah and we do by the grace of the Lord amen see they make merry because the torment has stopped for three and a half days verse 11 and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them now church that's the same fear that those soldiers saw when the angels were there when Jesus resurrected right there was such great fear that the soldiers looked like they died the Bible said because of the the power of the Resurrection so here's another resurrection and great fear comes upon them see that's what God's fear does when God's fear begins to move when God starts doing miracles like that the sinners get all fearful right but their believer rejoices amen see they fear verse 12 and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them now that come up here there is the same come up hither that you saw revelation 4:1 right when when God called up John to heaven after the seven church age so these words are important their rapture words amen hallelujah I wonder if we'll heal though hear those words Church come up here their bride come up hither brother so-and-so come up here their sister so-and-so I wonder if we'll hear those words because we know John heard them and we know the two prophets heard those exact words come up a little higher Amen come up higher praise the Lord and notice they go up in a cloud just like Jesus ascended to heaven in the cloud the Bible said a cloud took him up because this is the sixth and final rapture not seven not five 6 because 6 is the number of anointed man in the head that's right praise God 6 raptures are not 7 they're 6 I've always been looking for number 7 but uh but there's 6 as far as I can see because 6 is the number of anointed man if you're going to go in the rapture you're going to be anointed what were they anointed with the spirit of life from God Amen Alleluia god's holy spirit of life raises their dead bodies takes them up in a cloud I should cut cloud of glory amen raises them up in the sight of them all I wonder if they'll catch it on their smartphones there won't be a need to do it really because they're just going to be tormented but they'll probably catch it there they'll try to text it and share it or something like that but don't matter God's gonna play all back later God's got one great smartphone he's recording all this song right and it's all uploading to heaven you can't erase it only your sins can you erase because that's under the blood of Jesus Christ amen thank the Lord for that that's the only video that's gonna be the lead and praise God there's all the sins we did it'll be forgiven uh-huh thank you Lord so great fear and a cloud a resurrection cloud like Jesus did and it's caught of ascension just like an axe chapter 1 when Jesus ended the Bible said he'd send up in a cloud and the two angels looked at them and said why are you tearing here go to Jerusalem and be filled with the Holy Spirit now verse 13 and the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell now that city is Jerusalem right a tenth of the city of Jerusalem falls that's interesting a tenth is a tithe I never thought about that till now a tenth of it falls and the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the God of heaven that's interesting I never thought a tenth the tithe has to fall an earthquake kills 7,000 now later the next verse this says this is the second woe so the second woe is an earthquake after the rapture of those two witnesses 7,000 men died in the earthquake can you imagine the buildings that are following there in Jerusalem and then a third I'm sorry tenth of the city Falls a tenth of the city Falls and that's verse 14 the second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh quickly now church let me just say something here I want to say this with all humility if you look there's two quotes or brother Branham says the second is the Second World War now this is where I just disagree weather band never said it right in the seals or after the seals I felt like he was just you you know using that as the best teaching that he had the time but I think by reading this scripture right here we can see that the second low can't happen to after the two prophets are raptured up and I know I don't say that to hope you know I don't say it to sound smarter than brother branham I'm not smarter than him but like brother BAM said he doesn't have all the answers he was doing the best he could but one thing that we know the Spirit of God is supposed to direct us into all truth and I'm not gonna argue if someone wants to argue about dancing you don't believe brother Branham you're not saying what brother Ram said I had people tell me that this week saying I didn't you know they can email me or text me saying you were a sailor I said well not every word he said is thus saith the Lord you got to find a balance but one thing that is true is that the Holy Spirit will direct us to the Word of God and church this is a minor this doesn't even deal with the bride of Jesus Christ so what does it matter anyway you know why why should we get upset with people we're not I hope it's that if they get upset with us but this doesn't even deal with us we're already be in heaven out of a wedding reception amen ah yes we care about a 144,000 brethren but we're gonna be having communion with Jesus amen during this time and and then it doesn't even kneel with us so we should just be kind and pleasant right that's the real test right the real test is when you get in a trial are you gonna act like a lamb or a wolf that's when it comes to Humpty right you either got lamb nature or you got wolf nature and that's the best time to see which nature you have when somebody blatantly disagrees with you or calls you something or whatever more this week I got called rich young ruler on the email he said you're just a rich young ruler you're just going after popularity I thought well if I'm going after popularity I'm sure saying the wrong things cuz I'm gonna at least popular churches in the world right we're not growing and we're not busting at the seams and there's not millionaires in our church and we're not tickling the ears of millionaires to try to get there I said you really surely don't know me sir I appreciate your your I appreciate your comments but I don't think you really know me too well haven't made too many friends my preaching when I preached fact I lose most of them but they can call me what they want but I'm gonna say my dear brother in Christ because that's the kind of nature I've got a lamb you can kick me around you can push me around I'll just say in that right Church yeah I know there's time there's no game around there's times have a backbone but I'm not Apostle Paul like I call blindness down from heaven like Moran said how can you call blindness down when they're already blind I can what are you gonna do I'm not a prophet so what can I new Church I can either get in the sphere of the wolf or I can just be a meek little humble am I think I'll be like the lamb I'm not gonna fight where I'm not a fighter but at the same time am i earnest in contending for the faith yes I am that's why I'm standing where I'm standing but I don't want to let my flesh have the victory I don't want to walk in the flesh on it I'll start attacking that person I want to walk in the spirit and I just want to though I was a gave an answer to every man that asketh you with meekness and fear meekness is not you're not even a preacher you're the rich young ruler you're just a Judas you're just a wolf in sheep's clothing I really don't think that's a real meek spirit there right God give us grace to be meek that's at least the season of life I'm seeing right now I'm seeing just a lot more attacks and God is just testing my meekness he wants to see my program said he said are you gonna be a lamb or gonna be a wolf he said this we'll see what spirit is that that's on you all these trials that we go through so I just want to bring that out verse 14 that's just my like I said my opinion I can't see how the Second World War uh there was two witnesses raptured yeah Mohsen elijah I didn't see that in the Second World War I don't know about that I don't know if a tenth of the city was destroyed in World War two I I just can't make that fit okay I believe this is a future event I believe this is after the rapture so I'm just letting you know what I believe ee brother Brian was a prophet absolutely 100% with all my heart was he perfect no no prophet was outside of Christ so I just want to say that okay verse 15 now this is not the seventh angel brother man's ministry this is the 7/7 heavenly angels blowing the trumpet the heavenly trumpet that brings judgments verse 15 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever so this is the brother Aaron said this is the day of the Lord but man said the day of the Lord is when the days of man have ended so after the second world it's not gonna be very long to the Battle of Armageddon aim ahead because at the Battle of again Christ comes back and that's the end of all human kingdoms because he's coming back in a sword as a shower of his mouth and it divides all of them amen and the fowls of the air come and feast on their corrupting bodies and then fire burns over the earth and then we walk on the ashes on the wicked in the Millenium praise God amen so see God's letting them know the seventh angel sounding the seventh trumpet and it's almost time for the Battle of Armageddon verse 16 and the four and twenty elders which sat before God on their seats fell down their faces and workship God's they do it again so you see they found their face I think two or three times here in Revelation what do they say saying we give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou has taken to thee thy great power and s reign and that so humble of God God has been lettin Satan had all this power on the earth since Adam sold it out right satan's called the god of this world he's let him have the power all the time now some of the power of the governments of course guy but God everything God's been active in the church he's been acting the people but he's kind of give Satan a little bit of power but at this moment what's that seventh trumpet sounds God's taking all the power back you had your fun devil but now you're gonna get chained up in a chain of circumstance and cast in the bottomless pit for a thousand years amen Christ is going to step on in the earth and rule with a rod and iron you had your six thousand years now I'm gonna have my seventh day of peace now I'm going to have my millennial honeymoon with my sweet old wife amen that's right church amen and they're saying God's finally taking his power back to himself see cuz God likes to have a God likes to have an enemy amen God wanted us to overcome is that right God one day he knew Satan would be an enemy so he gave him a little power gave him the power the whole time God was gonna win the whole time it was never in question it might look like it was in question might have been tough during those later C in age but the Bible said Jesus was in the midst of the seven candlesticks for all seven Church ages amen in other words Jesus Christ is here right now it may not look like it but Christ is here amongst his bride he never leave us or forsake us he's standing in the myths of the layers in church age he's here tonight whether we want to recognize now but let's recognize it amen hallelujah and they rejoice and say you're taking your great power and now you're gonna rain on the earth verse eighteen other nations feel about this the nations were angry angry remember they're so angry they still won't repent member we looked at under the sixth seal couple months ago they're so angry they still blaspheme or in church you can see on these people that they just want more death more abortion right they want more Jews to die they want world domination you can see that spirit growing up on them already more wickedness more Eve all they want is more and more and more and that's how they're gonna be for the rest of the time until judgment were angry and thy wrath has come and the time of the Dead that they should be judged now see this is skipping already ahead to the Millennium I've start to the great white throne judgment after the Millennium so see that time is close when this happens there's only a thousand more years that's only one day with the Lord that's not very long church I imagine that thousand years is gonna go like this don't you think there's no temptations there's no struggles you never run out of energies just from one thing you had whatever God's having you build and box it will build houses in the habit then light right like the like the seventh feast of it the the Feast of Tabernacles right it'll be like that alright I'll finally get to build something in my life you know that's some physical looking bored of that but it'll just go so fast and then the Bible said it's closed now it's even closer than it was because now there's just a one day before the great white throne judgment see that they should be judged as finished eighteen and that I should has give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the Saints oh praise the Lord you know so often we hear about brother branham's or war which he has a great portion of heaven and the church said of course he left his family he left everything hid great portion of heaven but don't forget you've got a reward to the Bible said the prophets Gary words and so do the Saints the thing that is make sure you're sane and not a hate right make sure you're a real Saint a real separated one and gotta have a reward for you well I like that that's encouraging to me more than profits get rewards Saints get rewards and then that fear thy name how many fear the name of the Lord you respect that Nate you're careful how you say that name of Jesus I'll see those that fear his name to small and great and should as destroy them we should restore the earth I was reading today the church age book member have said that at the white throne judgment brother Branham said Berta and Nicodemus will be granted eternal life even though they never converted over into Christianity he said because they stood for God's people in a time of trouble perhaps they'll be given eternal life give many of fear God so much they told those Jews hey hey don't persecute those book of Acts children don't persecute them because you might find yourself fighting against God that's how much fear of God he had he realized this and I could be wrong I've been a dedicated Jewish teacher I'm a doctorate in divinity but I can be wrong see cuz he saw power in their movement and he didn't see it in his and the church said see he feared God he said don't don't hurt them you might be found fighting against God and the Bible says here at that white throne judgment that God will have mercy upon those that fear the name of God see when you see somebody that's fighting or wants to fight somebody condemn people judge people curse people there's something wrong with that they've got the wrong spirit see it's those that fear the Lord that's a great attribute to have because that's the beginning of wisdom and see even the beginning of wisdom is enough to get you turn 'life hey man yeah that's right the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom see all that fear thy name to the Saints of them that fear thy name small and great matter how small they are no matter how great they are see I appreciate you know there's been some media my mind's all on this abortion there's been some celebrities that have kind of sit up for babies on more babies lately and church I wonder if God will have mercy on some of them because it's so unpopular the small and the gray anyone that fears the Lord God may have mercy on them and God bless them for that see smelling great so no matter where you are God will have mercy on you because remember it's God who makes you poor it's God who makes you middle class or it's God who makes you rich and the church said that was in proverbs ecclesiastes we preached out recently it's God who does that verse 19 I'm sorry let's pray 18 and should us destroy them which destroy the earth so anyone that destroys the earth God will destroy them so you think of these million dollar people that put all these pollutants in the world you know they destroy the earth they kill the animals but BAM said those hunters that shot animals for not for sport he said they're murderers they're destroying the earth you know they're murder they got the wrong spear they're not doing it for sport they're doing it for murder so those who destroyed the earth will be judged by God verse 19 and the temple of God was opened in heaven now this is just a striking mysterious verse here and there was seen in his temple the Ark of his Testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings an earthquake and great hail we've seen that all over right we've seen all we've seen lightnings and voices Thunder now this is striking I wonder if they're gonna see heaven open from the earth I wonder or is this just refer to those in heaven they can see maybe the intercessory booth program talks about that and intercessory booth in heaven I don't know but Heaven's going to be open and they're gonna see the Ark of the Testament right that's what the Bible said the Ark of his Testament and there's lightnings voices thunderings earthquake and hail now church notice Jesus is off the mercy seat right so what is it judgment seat judgment Jesus has a vesture that's dipped in blood right that's the blood that's blood that we have right now thank God for the blood that we have right now but during this time when the seventh trumpet blows Haman has opened up there's just an arc of the Covenant and there's no blood mercy mercy on them so there's no blow on the mercy seat it's just judgment and that goes along with everything that this chapter has taught so far all right now let me start chapter 12 I'm not going to get all the way through it well let me start I'm gonna set my timer here we're trying to catch up on my sleep this week Victoria was sick on Monday night so I got in my sleep got interrupted like four or five times you know so I'm still trying to catch up on my sleep but I want to wear myself out I don't want to get sick so verse 1 of chapter 12 revelation 12:1 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered how many know who this woman is you say it out loud Israel this is Israel absolutely now let me go through this like I said I'll try to go as fast as I can now program tells it plainly here this is after the seals so many of the mysteries we're now beginning to open and be revealed and given thus saith the Lord it's not let's say the Lord but it does fit all the teaching Revelation chapter 12 I have said this plainly does not pertain to the bride Revelation chapter 12 I haven't looked it up but I know it it's the woman standing in the Sun with the moon under her feet the moon represented the law now this is a beautiful teaching here the woman representing Israel the church the 12 stars in her forehead was those 12 apostles the 12 church ages and so forth which just passed see and the Sun was at her head I think he means 12 tribes of Israel I think and the Sun was at her head which you see the moon as a shadow of the Sun which the law was a shadow of good things to come and that woman is Israel not the bride praise God now get your Bibles to go to just Hebrews 10:1 just look look at the beauty of this now this had to take a prophet I never would have thought of this scripture program said the moon represents the law how does the moon represent the law I never would have thought this in fact I was so happy and related I had a little stimulation of Revelation a couple years ago when I read this I like Oh glory I never once saw that revelation or Hebrews 10 one for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers they aren't too perfect look what brother Branham said look the moon this isn't 54 the Sun at her head the moon and her feet the Sun was dispensation of grace to see she's about ready to go into grace and the moon was the dispensation of the law the woman was the Orthodox Church and she was standing over the law the law was passing away because the law was a shadow of the good things to come is that right the moon is only a shadow of the Sun reflecting of the moon is that right making the moon and the law was under her feet she had done lived through that day and noticed how she was dressed here now oh my in that beautiful church the moon represents the law that was under feet because the moon constantly has a shadow on it praise the Lord who would I never would have thought of that but the moon cut I mean there's only a couple days right of the month there's I think there's 28 days in the lunar month there's a 30 30 days in lunar month there's only like one or two days where it's just full moon all the other days it's got a little shadow on it so the moon represents the law because the moon constantly has a shadow and the law was a shadow of good things to come lor amen is that right he says that is right amen that's one way we know that it's Israel because they're still under the law now let's look the timing of this program tells us the timing of this the timing of this is just before the birth of Jesus Christ so verses 1 & 2 and back back to Revelation 12 I'm sorry revelation 12:1 and 2 the timing of this is right before the birth of Jesus Christ so a woman is Cobra the Sun that's Israel the Orthodox Jew clothed with the Sun so she's about ready to come into the Sun which is the righteousness of Christ the New Testament the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars the twelve stars represent the twelve tribes of Israel and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered so that church has to represent when Jesus was going to be born to the Israel of Israel right through Mary she's pain right she's grabbing birth pains the the church the Jewish church is about to bring forth the Messiah amen my it's just so beautiful praise the Lord that church and I read this when I first came in in the nomination I thought this was the bride or something I mean who knows I might have thought this was the Muslim who knows right position me I had 12 sons that were princes who knows but see with the prophet of God who gave us all the other symbols of revelations chapters one two three four five six you know all these other chapters that gives all the symbols now we can put these symbols together and now we know exactly who it is amen now there's just no question about it so verses 1 and 2 is right before Jesus Christ is born verses 3 and 4 is again right before the birth of Christ look what it says verse 3 and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven Crown's upon his head number seven Crown's was that represent it represents those seven hills upon which she sitteth right 7 10 horns those 10 future for the BAM calls them not tyrants dictators there it is buh-bam calls those 10 future dictators that are going to give their power to the beast for a short little season but then they're gonna start hating around for that and then destroy of course Russia is gonna destroy the Vatican and for that that's from revelation 17 so look at Satan he's pictured as a dragon verse four and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast into the earth alright I think I got my and I mixed up here oh yeah I guess well this is what I alright let me keep going and they cast them to the earth verse four and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered oh yeah for to devour her child as soon as was born so look at that Satan use the third of the four demons to get ready to anoint Herod to kill all those babies remember when Jesus born some wonder what's killing those babies today demon powers human powers so a third of those demons are set are brought to the earth the time of Herod to stir them up in order to kill all those babies no that's powerful my goodness I knew that but it's kind of fresh to me tonight that was fulfilled to Matthew two 16 and 18 I'm gonna read that real quick bath rusik scene and 18 cuz that fulfilled another prophecy I believe Jeremiah Jeremiah prophesied of that then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men imagine how many that was men was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the Prophet saying in Ramah was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping in great mourning Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not in that sad they were weeping for him then and today the women rejoice over abortion they rejoice over death but there that they still had the natural affection right we're living in the age where there's no more natural affection among sinners so there it was fulfilled all of them two years and upward my what did that demon powers did that okay let's just finish up here got a couple more minutes let's just do verse five and six then we'll be done now verse five and six boy that's good I need to use it you know you know why that struck me so good because I've had people tell me lately o demons don't fill people and cause them to do things well here approves are right there demons were drawn down by Satan's tail and anointed Herod and all these men his soldiers to kill all these babies it was demons that anointed them I tried to tell them and look at Matthew 12 Jesus said the strong man gets bound up by demon powers when one gets cast out if they don't get the Holy Ghost in there it brings back seven more so that's eight demons right and but they just can't see that but this will give us more viable proof for that good I've never used that before that'd be a good one to use alright five and six let's say to our feet and we'll finish with this five and six and she brought forth a man child so now we see this is actually at the time the birth of Christ who was to rule all nations with the rod of iron which he hasn't done yet that will be in the Millennium because the Bible says you two if you if you're an overcomer he'll give you a rod of iron you know the Bible said that that's one of the rewards for the overcomers so Christ has the rod of iron we must have minor rods of iron and her child caught up unto God and to his throne so look at verse five you have thirty three and a half year 32 33 years of Jesus life in Britain verse five you have the time he's born to the time he's caught up to heaven see that see how God can hide all these things in the scripture there he can hide 33 years the whole life of Christ in one little verse not striking now let's go to verse 6 and I'd like to find that verse real quick about the round of iron so you can see that verse 6 and the woman fled in the wilderness where she was where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days now that's again three and a half years so God after Jesus is ascended it's like God allows Israel to go out in this spiritual wilderness but they don't get fed until the two prophets come and the church said that's when they really get fed right now they're not getting really fed because they're not hearing the real preaching of God's Word but they're gonna hear the real preaching when Moses and Elijah start preaching so the man said they're gonna preach the same message that we received hey man so what are we feeding on organ fed by God tonight amen every time we gather we're getting fed by God's heavenly the table I'll say like that Oh glory now give me a minute let's go to Revelation 3 I believe it's Revelation 3 or giving a rod of iron now if I'm wrong I'm gonna be really disappointed because I thought I read that recently I don't think I'm wrong I thought I was right well maybe I am okay revelation 2 27 I thought there was a scripture that said we would have a rod of iron maybe not I could be wrong Church I could be wrong about what could be one thing I made a mistake on if I did forgive me 227 okay no no verse 26 yeah probation 226 and he's at overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's and he shall rule them with the rod of ayran okay I think is right as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers even as I received my father Wow yeah that is that is if you can faithfully rule and overcome today what age was that in was that Sardis I was tired tear oh wow the darkest of all the ages where they hardly had Bibles right they hardly had any truth it was almost completely dead the Reformation had even shine forth yet and Jesus says if you overcome you'll rule over nations and rule them with the rod of iron as the vessels of Potter's should be broken to shivers think about that man God's going to give us power over nations to break nations just by our Christian character if we can overcome right now praise God if it's a big hit but with God were more than able to do it praise God he that started working us he'll be faithful to finish that work in us and we can just leave here tonight lord help me to rule over my sinful nature help me to rule over this depression or help me to rule over this mind battle I'm struggling with if we can just rule over the hats we'll be an overcomer and rule over nations later how many believe that I believe with all my heart let me stop right there let's give the low around laws thank you Jesus thank you Lord we love your word Jesus thank you Lord praise the Lord Jesus thank you Lord Lord willing next Wednesday we'll see we'll finish chapter 12 or will either go to the the series the couple looking at by God's grace either the purpose series what's the other one I've been doing purpose revelation with yeah numerology thank you brother new biblical numerology praise the Lord I had somebody tell me on Sunday night after that purpose series they said God revealed to them their purpose in life right there while I was preaching and they told me in tears I said well thank you Jesus see I just trying to we're gonna know why I'm sharing that is let you know I feel like I'm filing the leadership of the Lord and if somebody can find God's perfect will there purpose in life while we're preaching hallelujah that means Jesus is here to give us that revelation and if that is a revelation then the gates of Hell will never come prevail against that person they might matter they might fight they might knock them down a little bit but a righteous man will get back up amen okay thank you sir love the Lord tonight a mass just a wonderful wonderful Word of God that we have this doesn't even pertain to us yet we can rejoice because that we see a lot of great truths in these scriptures in church what I love to know is I love to know which part pertains to me don't you I love to know that this isn't me we're not going to be left out in the wilderness where God's not going to feed us for three and a half years God's feeding us now so what should we do we should be happy we should we rejoice and say thank you for your food right now and we should eat it happily and grow in spiritual muscles and strength we should grow in faith amen such an encouragement if we can just rule over these battles and trials right now he'll help he'll help us to rule over nations later the Bible said you'll break them with the rod of iron praise the Lord well I'm glad to say I didn't make a mistake I thought I'd made me maybe made a mistake on that one I'm glad it wasn't I'm going to say brother Jesse pray for me that we can rule over these areas of our lives how many would say that and you pray for me I battled today quite a bit too Hollow just different things Church and these emails with texts and things like

Christ will rule all nations but he'll give his overcoming servants part of that reward to rule over nations Lord I'll just say it real humbly now I'm not living to rule over those nations that's not really why I'm living I'm living right now to rule over Satan and to put Satan under my feet right now and Lord perhaps if you see a fit that I wasn't good enough overcome her and have me to rule later on later on that that'd be fine Lord but right now Lord I'm in the midst of a battle we are we're all in the midst of these battles you saw the hands that were raised we want to rule over sin now Lord God hallelujah maybe not with a rod of iron physically but with the rod of your word your God the rod of Revelation we might say Lord God thank you Lord that you're revealing your purpose to

name everything that you he's already oh let me pop a scripture real quick I was just thinking about this how many want to be perfect in Christ the Bible said he'd have perfected forever then that are sanctified Hebrews 10:24 and a new a new thought came to me today I've seen it for by one offering he has perfected forever then that are sanctified as sanctified means you're being set aside see in order for us for God to perfect us and be complete we've got to be continually sanctified and that's happening right now tonight amen glory glory this is part of your perfection to come here and say God we love you we believe all your word that help me to rule over my struggles I really don't care if I actually hold a little rod of iron but I want a rule over Satan right now amen that's the reality of it praise God [Music] that we can see Christ working in us thank God not what I should be but thank God I'm not what I used to be praise God I'm not what I used to be I can see Christ taking more preeminence in my life not perfect yet but I am more sanctified that's the way out I love that scripture just struck me today I think I saw an ESV translation of it it says something like that he has perfected forever then that are being washed constantly every service is so important to be washed that's how he perfects us praise God my world my world [Music] my closest friend I will
