[Applause] [Music] oh thank you musicians let's take our bibles here tonight by god's grace we'd like to look at this thought i preached on sunday i just got part two here of the disciple whom jesus loved yes sir yeah sorry let's go to john chapter 20 one verse 20. yes sir john 21 verse 20 and 21 we'll just keep it short here today a little shorter by god's grace so i know uh for sure naomi's family loves me because they come back after sunday's sermon so now we know for sure nature i know you love me now because you listen to me preach for two hours on sunday but also i preached two hours on sunday so it's a long sermon and youtube cut us off after 26 minutes it is a great great time great atmosphere and just a wonderful time in the presence of the lord and uh glad you guys had a great time at brother cams praise god hallelujah very thankful about god's grace john chapter 21 verse 20 and 21 chapter 21 verses 20 and 21. so i just want to look at this jet it's just a general scripture where we hear about the writer of this epistle writing about himself not calling his own name but calling himself the disciple whom jesus loved i love that last song we sang you know i could have found a way to put the name jesus in there but i think jesus knows who i was singing to don't you don't you think jesus knows that we're singing to him our prayer is the lord remind us who we are when we fall short and when we struggle and we forget who we are remind us who we are in other words transform my mind daily that i can prove the perfect will of god and i can remember i'm just not a church member i'm not i'm just not one out of the i'm not one insignificant person out of 8 billion but i'm a child of jesus christ i'm a child of god and i've been called to a high calling much higher than others by god's grace and all is that by grace that's all by grace it's not by works unless any man should boast as we heard on sunday part of it of course is those who are faithful to god come to god and so god can give them more rewards because god is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so he saves us by grace but then he invites us to come anytime and the more we come the more blessings we get and the more rewards we'll get in heaven by the grace of god not that we're going for rewards but we want to do the father's work while we're on this side like like the bible jesus said you want to work while it's day because he said no man can work at night time in the tribulation praise god john 21 verse 20. okay so let's see if i can adjust that that be better is that that okay thank you how's that sound occasion for the live stream and sound okay all right yeah we've had a lot of youtube problems and i'm not sure what the problem is i don't know i don't know so we'll just we're trying something a little different tonight hopefully that works better i've had brother william has asked me uh for sermons why can't i find the sermons i've had other people paul's asked me why can't i find these sermons i say it's youtube's fault or my fault i don't know whose fault it is but it's somebody's fault it's probably gonna come back to me anyway so i'll take it it's my fault so hopefully this works out all right let's read verses 20 and 21 together then i'll read 22 myself so i'm sorry john chapter 21 verse 20. then we'll all read verses 20 and 21 together then i'll read 22. good question brother thank you all right let's read it starts with then peter so let's read verses 20 and 21 together one two three then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing him sayeth to jesus lord and what shall this man do now i'm going to read verse 22 jesus saith unto him if i will he didn't say he would he said but if i will if it's my will that john tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me in other words don't worry about how long people live don't worry about if you're going to live to see the rapture or not follow the voice of god how many could do i'm going to appreciate that tonight we all want to live to see the rapture but jesus is specifically saying specifically saying here don't worry about who's going to live to the rapture or not follow the voice of god praise god i'm going to follow that voice let's have one more word of prayer here heavenly father as we bow our heads we thank you god for this beautiful opportunity to be in your presence tonight and i just pray god you'd speak to us and help me to move aside that the holy spirit can preach lord i felt that on sunday and i want to feel it again tonight lord that i'm not the one preaching but your people are pulling on your you and your word and lord the holy spirit comes in and preaches to us lord god strengthen us through this uh lord this uh giving of the word because we know faith will come by hearing this word raise our faith raise our assurance we'll raise our trust in you through this message tonight and bless your people especially those who have made sacrifices to be here tonight bless those live streaming and those that are listen on the archive but especially i pray minister to our local flock i pray in jesus christ's name and saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i'm going to set a timer for 45 minutes and maybe i can do that we'll see i don't know if it's possible but let's see uh i like to be mindful of time you know someone's got school tomorrow right girls someone's got school tomorrow first of all got us rest of us got in the home you know so uh let's look to the lord here tonight let's look at part two i don't know if i'll preach a part three or not kind of goes out tonight or see how tonight goes um but i hope by the end of this service church you know how much god loves you and i trust you'll understand how much god loves this church that's my prayer hallelujah so we read our texts here tonight i'm just gonna do a quick review from the two-hour sermon or the mayor long-winded sermon whatever so on sunday we looked at five scriptures where john says he was the disciple whom jesus loved and then we looked at uh how jesus loved all his disciples and the sisters in other words jesus did not have any favorites he loved martha mary lazarus all his disciples which included john so i kind of asked the question why would he call himself i'm the disciple jesus loved then we looked at how god's love is unquestionable no one here should ever question god's love for them i know we do that's why we're just saying that remind me who i am right we do but none of us should if we ever get down to praying about it and thinking about it and the battles between satan and and the word of god and ours the holy spirit our souls the holy spirit should get the victory that god loves us that's why we do memorials that's why we you know read the bible and pray because we must remember that god loves us very much he's interested in every part of our lives and i've just been reminded of that especially this week here and i'll explain why at the very end i'll explain something at the end where god truly reminded me this week that he hears all my prayers even just simple humble little prayers i'm not even you know on my knees or anything and god hears our prayers i love jesus praise god i i want you to love jesus with all your heart praise god then we looked at how jesus sometimes austin and lena jesus would sometimes leave his other eight decide or i'm sorry other uh nine disciples behind and then he would go out and he would work with peter james and john so it looked like jesus had favorites but he didn't those three just had special gifts that jesus wanted to use okay peter had the gift of faith john had the gift of love and then james had a gift of hope so faith hope and love that's in the bible these are the three greatest gifts of god but the greatest of these is let's all say together the greatest is love love is the greatest of all gifts that's what first corinthians 13 says there's these three faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love the king james calls it charity but it's the same thing and for one example brother austin you know uh when jesus raised jairus daughter from the dead he said get all these mourners out they would actually hire women to cry and mourn to help the family feel better you know after a funeral because just because the getting out all the emotion helped right you know if we don't if we don't mourn over uh sad things in our lives it gets it gets stuck in here right and eventually it's going to spill over on somebody so there is a lot of wisdom in getting all your tears and weeping and crying there's a lot of wisdom in that so they had they done that at jairus's house his little daughter died well jesus walks in there and he said this death or this is not a death she's just sleeping and everybody starts laughing oh jesus he's really crazy this guy and jesus said get out he said get everybody out except jairus daughter and these three peter james and john so he kicks them out of the house now that don't seem very like it was very nice but jesus had to do that and the bible said because they didn't believe they didn't believe a miracle was possible so see when a miracle happens you have to get all the unbelief out and you have to have just faith hope and love amen praise god and so jesus walked over and he he said rise he said uh he told his daughter rise and she rose well fast forward years later jesus already died rose went to heaven peter gets called to a house of a dead woman she's already dead her name's dorcas or tabitha and peter does the same thing peter hears them all crying peter says i remember what jesus taught me he had faith he kicked all them out and he went over to tabitha he said tabitha rise and she got up in the name of god in the name of the lord praise god so that's a good example of how jesus was teaching these peter james and john he was teaching them things they needed to know for their future ministries and they had special gifts but jesus did not have favorites because the bible said he loved them all he loved them to the end amen and that's what we're going to do we're going to love jesus to the end praise god if the end is this year for america we're going to love jesus to the end praise god amen if the end of our lives is next year the year after or five years down the road doesn't matter we're gonna love jesus all the way to the end i don't plan on stopping i don't i don't plan on giving up early i plan on giving him being faithful to death and faithful unto death praise god amen that's the kind of faith we have to have praise god faithful to death uh is different than faithful unto death faithful unto death means you're faithful knowing that you're gonna die faithful to death just means you're faithful till you die but we want to be faithful to either one we want to be faithful all the way pray god would have us die by martyr whether god would have us die a natural death or whether god would rapture us we want to be faithful to the end praise god because we know once the end comes it's just the beginning praise god hallelujah when the end of this life comes we step into the next life and that's an eternal life amen hallelujah the end here is just the beginning amen hallelujah praise god now we then we saw how god is impartial so god loves everyone but then he has to give rewards to those who obey his word and they become his beloved because but be he four knew beforehand that the other ones wouldn't choose him but the ones that would would and so he would love them with special love because the others would just fight against god and he would show them love but eventually the bible said he would turn on them the bible calls it reprobate mind because that's what the bible said the bible says jacob have i loved and esau have i hated so god foreknew and the bible the bible says in the book of romans the bible said god foreign knew that esau was going to be a renegade and he was going to be a reprobate so god tried to get him god tried to get him to repent but then eventually he turned a reprobate and then god fought against esau but god loved jacob because jacob wanted the blessing amen jacob wanted a new birth amen jacob one of the the inheritance praise god and he wrestled with an angel till he got it praise god that's what we need to do wrestle with god wrestle in prayer you know battle in prayer keep believing keep praying until you get the answer to your prayer amen glory now the next we saw how god loved job so we went through job's life now brother austin i'm just gonna i'm just gonna back up and show you and lean on this because i don't you probably never heard it and it might be a help to you job uh had probably the greatest test there ever was in the old testament i can't think of a greater one maybe joseph you know in prison like that i don't know um but if you remember the story of job you remember the story a little bit brother okay so job was a he was a godly man it was before the it was in the old testament about the days of abraham and uh job had how many kids did he have seven oh lots of kids okay i could maybe seven daughters with seven daughters i think okay ten kids and three of them were daughters is that what it was okay yeah anyways yeah lots of kids and he had lots of cattle i read an article one time and they said it was equivalent to about five million dollars today so he had five million dollars sit in his bank account because he was so rich but in heaven satan come up and said well you he only serves you because you bless him well let me back up all the devils had to come before god and present themselves and tell god what they were doing of course god knew what they were doing but god still makes all the demons come before him and god recommended job to the devil god said have you considered my servant job a man who's perfect a man whose integrity have you considered him and satan said well you protect he only serves you because he protects you early serves you because you're protecting him and god said that's he said fine he said no he said i'll prove to you that that job serves me because he loves me and he said go ahead he said touch his take everything from him and so satan left from the prince of god and he brought a whirlwind and tornado he destroyed all of his cattle he destroyed all of his house he let the house where all his kids were eating a meal together he let that house fall down satan destroyed that house and killed all job's family so job had nothing left except him and his wife and what did he say the bible said he got on his face on his knees in his face he said the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord so he passed the test in other words even though he lost everything he passed the test well you know all the devils come back for another round and god said hey devil have you considered my servant job he does it again and he says well eye for an eye you know tooth for tooth he said he said a man will he said job will curse you to his face if you just if you take away his health and god said go but don't take his life in other words other words you can do anything to job just don't touch his life and the bible said instantly satan come down and he smoked job with sores and he had to take glass and cut his sores can you imagine taking glass to kind of get relief from your sores he would take glass and it was all over him from head to toe he lost all his hair he couldn't even sleep for months brother couldn't sleep for months and he got so skinny he's kind of like jesus he said my bones i can see my bones they're staring at me from this awful condition with the sores and after all these months he starts complaining to god and then a man came by lahu and came told him you're wrong and then job said i'm i i'm righteous god needs to come talk to me and god came down to talk to him so if you ever read job you need to read job god come down and never answer job's question he just said have you uh he said do you where were you when the the foundation of the earth was settled he asked him uh he asked him do you know where uh do you know where the storehouses of snow are you know where he said in other words you know do you know where i keep the snow and of course he asked job 60 questions and job couldn't say anything and after god left without answering his question the bible said job fell on his face and repented in dust and ashes and said i abhor myself therefore i repent and dust and ashes he said i spoke things i should not have spoke after all that god tells job's friends go job needs to pray for you and you'll be healed and then after joe prayed for them job was healed and god gave job double children and double finances than he ever did so in other words joe passed the test but the thing was god knew he'd passed the test hallelujah praise god amen now in heaven brother austin god told satan job is perfect but on earth god rebuked job all the time god rebuked him with 60 questions god rebuked him through elijah so we have to understand things are different in heaven and earth in heaven we've got a savior praise god in heaven we've got a lamb of god who takes away all of our sin amen and in heaven we're perfect praise god amen it's like we're a finished work already in heaven the bible said your theophany always beholds the face of the father which is in heaven amen in other words your spiritual body is waiting there for you in heaven it's a perfect body in other words god knows you're going to be a perfect being and god has a body for you to go and after this body dies you have a perfect body to go to and in god's eyes you're already complete you're already perfect amen but on earth sometimes we're failures on earth sometimes given sinful nature right we fall short of god's glory and we upset with god we see things about god we shouldn't say so god has to spank us on earth but in heaven he's like you consider my servant and you consider my servant beatrice she's perfect hallelujah you consider my sermon william he's perfect right and the uh god allows us to be tested god doesn't tempt us but he allows satan to test us or tempt us because he knows we'll pass the test and the bible says in first corinthians 10 god will not give us a temptation that we cannot overcome but in every in every temptation there's an escape route amen there's an exit door in every temptation every room of temptation we come into god makes an escape door and that door is christ amen hallelujah but brother uh austin sister lena in heaven job was perfect but on earth he had a fear problem he was always afraid that sound familiar we all got it i had it when coleman first came out sometimes i get it still too like when is this nation gonna end are they gonna lock us up or you know sometimes we we battle that job had great fear elijah said job had iniquity iniquity is purposeful sin it's purposeful transgression against god even though you know the right commandments we all have iniquities we all do things wrong when we know we shouldn't so did job job was not just in other words he had pride he wasn't fair he wasn't treating god fair job was also a little lazy at times the bible said he was at ease so he wouldn't pray like he should and the church said he wouldn't read his bible like he should of course i don't know if he had a bible other than the stars i'm not sure about that also the bible said he was guilty of rebelling against god while he was in the trial how many times do we say the wrong thing in the trial like i don't deserve this yet we do right and we don't get as much as we deserve that's how merciful that's how loving god is so job had all these faults on earth brother sister but in heaven god said you're perfect because he sacrificed all the time amen because he hit a lamb he would kill the lamb he would kill the ox he would sacrifice and because he kept the promise because he kept god's command of sacrifice in heaven he was totally forgiven god said he's perfect and that was under the blood of bulls and goats what about us under the blood of jesus christ amen how much more are we perfect in heaven right now praise god because we don't have animal blood we have holy sinless son of god blood amen that totally abolishes all sin praise god hallelujah it sends it all away so don't feel discouraged on earth we get rebuked god spanks us that's supposed to happen but in heaven he's bragging on us amen he's bragging on us amen because he knows the sacrifices we're making the prayers the trust and the blood the the request for forgiveness he sees it and he honors it and heaven backs it up amen now also brother austin lena along with his problems he did a lot of good things on the earth too he lived for others he gave widows money so men that women that didn't have husbands and if you didn't have a husband those days you were like a beggar because a woman couldn't work fatherless he helped the fathers who had no dads in other words the beggars he loved his enemies he was good to his enemies even though they cussed him out or hated him or whatever he was still good to them he trusted not in riches although he was rich and that beautiful you can be rich and not trust in riches and then he helped strangers right that's what we should do help strangers and then he overcame mind battles he said i'm not going to look at other women i've made a promise in my mind look look how pure this guy was this guy meant business with god but was he human too yeah did he rebel against god sometimes yes he did he did but yet god loved him and allowed him to suffer so that he could be more pure after the trial how many know god's going to make you more pure after your trials there is a purpose for every suffering in your life it's going to make you love god more afterwards everyone everyone the bible said jesus learned obedience through the things he suffered so the more you suffer the more showing you you've got to obey the word of god obey the word of god then we looked at uh okay yeah i'll head back up so that's just a quick review of job now i preached just a couple sermons on job i may preach longer on that i really love that book i feel like there's so many more nuggets in there well then on sunday we looked at how our thankfulness for god's love we ought to be very thankful for the love of god everything we say do it should all be thanks for the love of god and then we close i kind of close kind of fast i'm going to go over this a little bit i'll just go over right now here now i'm going to slowly say what i said fast on sunday now some of you might have a hard time thinking sunday was fast but i did close fast so i got this from john piper a lot of these thoughts he's a preacher and of course i don't agree with him on everything but john he said john said jesus loved lazarus than his other disciples his other 11 disciples in all these verses so john is not saying he's excluding others from jesus love so when john would say hi i'm the disciple that jesus loves he wasn't saying jesus doesn't love you that's not what he was saying because jesus loved everybody the kids would sit on his lap right he said let the little kids come sit on my lap praise god i wonder if he said let me give you 10 jumps tonight i wonder if he said that or maybe he just did five i don't know probably a lot of kids around there no he loved the kids yeah maybe he gave him fruits fruit strips or something like that raisins dried fruit you know he loved the kids he didn't say don't come to me he said let the little kids come to me but john had a close relationship with jesus uh and he so much so brother that he would lean into his bosom and think about the last time i hugged you now what if by the house when i hug you you would have tried to let go but i ought to hug you tighter i just want to put my head right there on your chest what would you have thought you want uh oh okay okay bro jesse all right yeah that's how we are with jesus right that's how john was with jesus jesus would just be sitting there he said let me come up and just hug into you i just love you amen praise god the disciple amen that love jesus amen the disciple and he called himself i'm the disciple that jesus loved look jesus never took no what about a lesson that is i didn't see that jesus will never turn you away from his bosom if you want to fellowship with jesus he ain't going to push you away just like john he's going to let you settle right in for some communion praise god hallelujah for some fellowship praise god you ever see jesus pushing john away hey don't you're not too close man you got germs you might have coveted you ever see him pushing him away of course if you're sick don't try to spread it to somebody on purpose but look we never see jesus turning him away but rather jesus just lets him rest there right there in his bosom john as long as you want to stay there buddy you can stay there thank you lord i love you i wonder if he felt i've only got a few more only got a few more weeks or months with him remember he was going to live till he was 95 100 maybe more he had all those years without christ if you were a disciple which one would you be john i don't know you'd want to lean in jesus's muslim praise god see they had a close relationship right peter even asked john he said john ask jesus and you're really there close he remember can you imagine that at the table john asked jesus who's the betrayer they were all asking am i lord said i said i so peter says i'll i'll go to a likely source i know where i can get the answer i'll get it from the one who leans in his bosom ah that's what it's like when people come to you say i know i want you to pray for me praise god i want your advice about the bible i want to know what you say about the bible see they know you you spend time in the bosom of christ amen you know i had my principal tell me this today he said i didn't even ask for this we had a little meeting i got i got to be great this year with nature i got gotta go get my grade and see if i'm gonna be a good teacher this year we're meeting there you know and he says we're all done he says you know he said i wanna tell you something he said november and this fall was the hardest uh time in as being principal i said yeah i'm so sorry he said yeah we had a lot of things going on we had a lot of kids that were just out of control and i would hear them screaming and mr capra would be carrying these kids out of the school you know and they were just out of control and there were times uh you know he was just really struggling but he looked across and he said he said you know i was sitting there talking with my wife at home and he said he said all of a sudden you came into my mind this was back in uh december i think it was and he said he said oh jesse the reason the devil's fighting us so hard is because jesse's starting to start he's trying to start bible club back up again [Laughter] and i just laugh i said well i said that might be it sir i said one thing i know is jesus wants the little children to come unto him amen i didn't hear you and i said jesus likes when little children get saved sanctified and they serve the lord all their life now of course i meant holy ghost filled too you know i just forgot to say that see but when you need information you got to go to the guy that can get it and peter had to go to john that guy that leans in his bosom there that guy john ask him ask him why didn't he just ask him because he knew john had this close relationship with christ also piper went on to say this also this phrase of calling yourself i'm the disciple whom jesus loved this shows that he was an eyewitness of all these things second this was john's way of saying his most important identity is being loved by god just like that i don't want you to call me brother jesse i mean you can don't look at me as a pastor don't even i don't even want you to look at me a friend i mean you will right i'm your brother i want you to look at me as a disciple that jesus loves praise god hallelujah that would be the greatest privilege you could ever give to me in my life that when you saw me that's a child of god right there god loves that man right there praise god isn't that what you want praise god people look at you and they see the grace of god on your life and they don't see any of your identity they just see god's love poured out on you amen hallelujah it's beautiful didn't paul say it is no longer i that lives but christ that lives within me praise god amen he said i don't live he said i don't live by my faith he said i live by the faith of the son of god which gave his life for me and died for me amen so when you look at me just see jesus just see a testimony of god's love amen just see a testimony of god's grace amen when you look at me just look just think of the blood of jesus christ what did brother graham call it just just he said call me a trophy of god's grace when you look at me just see a trophy jesus i'm jesus's trophy you're jesus trophy he fought the battles and you're the reward amen you're the reward that jesus fought the battle and he won hallelujah he didn't lose he won by death he defeated death and won and conquered death amen he took all the powers of death and he overcame that and you're the trophy praise god you imagine that's you but austin you're the one jesus holds up i defeated the devil here's my trophy you know how they kissed the trophy that's you that's that's you that's jesus kissing you brother austin this there's my trophy i'm a trophy of god's grace amen he fought the devil to defeat the devil and you're the reward you're the trophy hallelujah then we saw that john was speaking like paul when paul said i'm loved by christ because this is why i live christ's love for me controls me i'm constrained by the love of christ i am arrested i am imprisoned to the love of christ i can't get out of this love amen hallelujah i'm locked in i'm sealed in i'm shut in to the love of christ amen and there's no getting out praise god i'm sealed and i'm a prisoner for christ whatever he says that's what i do oh hallelujah so the revelation is that john knew how much god loved him which is why he called himself the disciple that jesus loved get your bibles let's read this uh maokai lydia can you read this for us luke 9 52. if you if you can get your bible let's read that so i flew through this so fast i didn't have time really to stop and preach it i was just trying to close and let everybody stand up and worship the lord and get their legs feeling a little better put smile on their face a lot of you were smiling already luke 9 52 lady doing read 52 53 and 54. now can i read all the way to 54 then i'm sorry 56. but he turned and refused amen now in the scripture john and his brother james are called the sons of thunder now what do you think of when you think of thunder loud right yeah loud shaking yeah good good nature's shaking you get shaken up and you hear a lot of booming sound right they were called sons of thunder because of their zeal right john was so zealous if they won't receive jesus let's call fire down from heaven and destroy this whole city and jesus said you don't even know john you're going to be the disciple of love but you don't even know right now you don't even have any love right now you're filled with this uh too much zeal you got an angry spirit on you you gotta murder a spirit on you i didn't come to destroy man that's leader for the tribulation i come to save man's lives but see he had this reputation i'm a son of thunder i'm i got zeal i want god's power to show god's will to be done right now if not judgment and wrath praise god amen i saw a zealot like some people i don't know some preachers but i'm zealous you know mercy god have mercy on them uh yours truly is one of them probably but god has a way to soften them over the years god has a way of rolling those stones against that rough stone against another stone pretty soon it gets all smoothed out over the years praise god see jesus protected don from murder in other words or having a bad attitude right angry zealous uh wrathful attitude jesus saved john from himself right so see before the cross of christ in the upper room john had this murderous mentality this judgment mentality and he was not patient and did not have the divine love that he later was known for in other words he wasn't exercising love at that particular moment although that was his gift he wasn't exercising it how many know you don't always exercise your gifts the way you should you might use them for the wrong thing especially a preacher especially a preacher because they're up in public right if you're not a preacher well your mistakes are not broadcast over youtube and then people corn you and email you and make more videos about you which i don't want to make mistakes but i'm just likely to because i'm a human now i want you to notice this ephesians 2 says all of us had our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh so before we're christians we were just living whatever made our flesh feel good we did it and the church said okay and the mind whatever your mind would make you feel good you just did that and we were by nature the children of wrath even as others sound like john doesn't it he was a child of wrath you want a wrath to fall on the samarans right but god who's rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us so god looked on upon us as we were giving ourselves to sin and loving sin god had pity on us in his great love and he said they're dead in their sins but i'm going to send them my love and it's going to make them go from dead to alive because i have great love for these fallen humans i'm going to send them my love it's not a small love it's not a diminished love it's not a anything it's a great love it's a powerful love it's a sufficient love i don't know it's more than enough love hallelujah god's love is not lacking tonight it's our love that's lacking so even when we were dead in sins hath then he quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved so god saw all of us wandering around in our sins and our lusts and our our bad habits and everything and his great love said i'm going to save them i know they want to be saved he sent them he sent us his grace he sent us his love and now we go from dead to life we didn't even know we were dead while we were alive did we we didn't even know until we heard the real gospel and saw a real condition i don't want him but to be dead i want to be alive and so we repented and as we repented god poured out his love the bible said he shed it like he was stabbed on the cross he shed his love abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost amen hallelujah oh that's rich amen that's glorious god's great love quickened us to life he filled us with his love so we can endure our trials through love so the only thing that's going to hold us in the hard times is his love he said i need to put something in them so that when they have trials they can overcome the trials he said oh i know the perfect thing my love he could have put anything in there he could have put jewels he could have put diamonds he could have put medicine he could have put anything in there to heal our souls but he knew that wouldn't do it the money wouldn't do it but he knew love would do it and love still does it love will always help you overcome love for god hallelujah the bible says hope maketh not ashamed so when you're hoping for the rapture you're not ashamed of it because it makes you unashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us anybody that's not expressing love probably isn't born again or if they're not expressing it they're in the midst of a complex a battle but give them a little bit time they're going to overcome they're going to show the love of god again but if they never show love if they never show the love of jesus christ they're probably not born again see with god's love in our hearts or john's heart john could endure the trials of life you remember the story he was boiled in oil and he didn't die all the other guys died that would bore on oil but not john i don't know why they didn't cut off his head why didn't they just cut off his head i don't know right you ever think about that just like i told you remember with moses moses walked in there with aaron all those times past those guards of see pharaoh and they never killed him see if god has a calling on your life the devil can't touch you oh i didn't hear i said something right there amen if god wants you to do something there's no devil in hell that can stop you praise god because you have a divine mission that was eternally planned out by god and god's going to make sure you fulfill it hallelujah no man can stop a real son or daughter of god satan might discourage you and try to get you upset you just stay in the love of god you're going to get the victory well oil didn't work so he said oh i'm getting rid of this guy he's a soothsayer so they strand him on the isle of patmos patmos is right here it's uh close to ephesus modern-day turkey these are some bible cities you'll be familiar with so there's athens you know all kinds of places there here's crete paul had ministry at crete so they they sent john out i'm tired of you john i'm going to send you out to the isle of patmos we don't even want to see you anymore you can go out there with a bunch of crazy devil worshipers and soothsayers that's what they did the wikipedia says that uh he was sent out to the isle of patmos at the in the late 1st century by the roman emperor domitian and the bible said in roman revelation 1 9 he was sent to the aisle that's called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ amen church in other words any time you're isolated any time you're stranded anytime you're persecuted for your faith it is for a testimony to the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ counted all joy the bible says when you go through trials and tribulations and persecutions for your faith shall be made stronger your faith will become like gold hallelujah the trial of your faith is more precious than gold the bible says the roman authorities banish him to patmos this was the common punishment for a number of offenses such as practicing magic and astrology the romans viewed prophecy as belonging to the same category where whether pagan jewish or christian anyone who tried to prophesy and especially about political events in those days would be banished because the romans didn't want to hear the bad news that was coming their way right so the romans would perceive any negative word or negative prophecy against them as a political threat and so they would banish the men i don't know what john said maybe john said something about rome i don't know but they got so tired of this guy and his prophecies that they sent him to the isle of patmos said look we did the isle of patmos he didn't complain he didn't quit he didn't give up on god he loved jesus all the way to the end amen just like jesus loved him all the way to the end he loved jesus all the way to the end praise god while he was on that isle of patmos all isolated the bible said he got in the spirit on the lord's day i wonder if he played his favorite song when the spirit of the lord comes upon my heart i will dance like david i wonder what song it was praise god he got the stomping and praising the lord and all of a sudden he sees jesus in a vision and he falls down like he's dead he said he touches him and he gets up he said write this in a book and send it to the seven churches the seven cities which will be seven church ages amen hallelujah he could have quit out there he could have gave up he could have committed suicide but he said i'm just instead of getting the spirit of death i'm going to get in the spirit of life amen hallelujah praise god we always have a choice there's always a way death or life you choose and beat unto you according to your faith all right i got uh six minutes on my 45 boy a little surprised here now you would think the man who's called the disciple of love you think he'd understand a little bit about god's love right and if you ever read the book of first john it's only five chapters brother sister it's full of the love of god as soon as i thought about this subject i went right to the first john it's so full now you don't need your bible but i'll have some of you help me read this here john at the end of his life had such a revelation all right so let's start looking at the love of god in this book uh let's have nature you want to read this for me can you read that do a read off here okay here bye in him verily perfected hereby so john says here's how we know him if we keep his commands people that don't keep jesus commands do not know him they think they know him but they don't right if a man says i know jesus and don't they don't obey the commandments they're liars and the truth is not in them but whoever keeps the word truly in him the love of god will be perfected he'll come to a more perfect state of being a christian he'll become a mature christian praise god and hereby know that we're in him because we keep the commands of god keeping the commands is essential he that saith he's in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even now that's why we don't hate anybody we don't hate anybody we feel sorry for them we try to correct them but we don't hate anybody we love them he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there's none occasion of stumbling in him so as long as it gets this as long as you're walking in love you're not going to cause anybody to stumble and you're not going to be stumbling see if you just walk in the love of christ every day my i love the lord i love his people i love my enemies if you just walk in love all day you're not going to cause anybody stumble because you're so full of care for other people you're so full of of looking outward that you don't let sin get caught inward amen amen good you're so busy spewing out blessings amen you don't let anything corrupt form in your heart praise god you're not taking any evil because all you're doing is pushing out god's love amen hallelujah he that hates his brothers in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because the darkness has blinded his eyes so someone living in hatred don't even they don't even know where they're going in life but those who have the love of god they know exactly where they're going we're walking up the king's highway amen hallelujah praise god love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him so this clearly proves someone who loves the things of the world is not born again it's impossible right you can't be born again and love the things of the world you have to have the things of the world but you do not love them right for all that's in the world the lust of the flesh things your flesh wants the lust of the eyes things your eyes once and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth the way and the lust thereof but he that do it the will of god abideth forever amen now look at this now we're getting to god's love what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us or given to us that we should be called the sons of god the very fact you can be called a son or daughter of god shows a great amount of love was poured out upon you amen john's like what manner of love is this amen that us sinners us men and women who walked after the flesh and lust of the eyes and lust of the mind could be caught quickened first made alive though we were dead and now love other people love our enemies and manifest christ what kind of love is this this could only be god's love what manner of love is this therefore the world doesn't even know us because it didn't know him beloved now not not tomorrow now where there's ever ever say now ready now now we're the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be as far as our next bodies but we know that when he shall appear jesus we shall be like jesus for we shall see jesus as he is so whenever we see jesus we'll have a body just like his that means i'll live just as long as he does amen that means act just like him praise god hallelujah now look at this every man that has this hope what to see jesus in him purifies himself now that's where a lot of churches fall short they don't get more pure they get more sinful even as jesus is pure how many hoping to go to heaven how many above that how many hope to go in the rapture and skip death everyone that has this hope you will purify yourself you will work to say i've got to be more pure i've got to be more like christ i need more of the mind of christ tomorrow amen hallelujah that's what i need amen if you have a hope for heaven purify yourself so there's no doubt you'll get there praise god hallelujah there's my 45 so give me a few more minutes here i can never stop on time i think out later let me make a note i may stop right here and uh let's see what i got left here well i may preach one more sermon on this okay i'm making each one we'll see um let's do this let's finish uh john yeah let's finish john and then i'll stop because i want to go back to leah i had some more notes on leah i want to revisit that but we'll have to get to that later okay little children let no man deceive you he that does righteousness is righteous even as he's righteous he that commits sin is of the devil for the devil sins from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil now here's a beautiful scripture church this is for your soul this is for your soul not your flesh and not your mind whosoever is born of god whoever is baptized with the holy ghost does not commit sin wait what what what what'd you say john the one who loves he knows god loves god god loves him he said if you're born of god you don't sin for his seed what's the seed the holy spirit's the seed his seed remains in him so in other words you were a sinner until you got a seed and now that seed is a new life in you it's producing a new life and that seed cannot sin amen if that seed cannot sin it must be a different kind of life it must be god's own life amen which is the holy ghost praise god he cannot sin because he's born of god so when a person gets the holy ghost in their soul god doesn't even see them sin in heaven right but on earth is he going to correct you absolutely he's going to correct you but in heaven you have the seed of god you pass from death and the life you're sealed away in the kingdom of god until the day of your redemption how's that youtube sounding is okay all right thank you hopefully it didn't cut us off people are hanging on to the end here to catch the ending here in this the children of god are manifested the children of devil whosoever does not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother so anyone who does wicked acts and then doesn't love his brother they're not born of god very plain you think how many think this guy understood what he's talking about this is the disciple whom jesus loved now brother brother austin here's the balance this scripture says we don't sin right but then earlier in the in the book two chapters earlier john said if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us so see we got to be very careful with this the same guy two chapters said and then he says if you say you've not sinned you make god a liar and his word is not in you but see if you confess here it is if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you of your sins and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness so let me say like this you've got three parts right your soul and once it's born again can never sin again but this mind will sin and this flesh will sin so never say i don't sin in the flesh and the mind but you can say my soul doesn't sin hallelujah praise god your soul has a seed if it's born again it has the seed of the holy spirit that seed can never sin praise god that's what the thus saith the bible says amen but your flesh will sin and your mind will think the wrong thoughts and act on them and say things wrong but your soul will never agree with that and here you are trying to handle three parts of your being you're just trying to i'm just trying to talk about all the needs around the world like india all these i'm just trying to handle this guy right here sometimes i feel like that sometimes i'm trying to try to handle my mind all these mind battles and this flesh a couple more here this is the message you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another so what's the message jesus been saying this whole time love each other love each other not as cain who's of that wicked one so here's cain was a serpent seed he was of the wicked one and he slew his brother abel wherefore he slew him because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous marvel not ye my brethren if the world hates you so don't be surprised that people hate you now that you're a christian we got a lot of those praise god all right let me stop there i'm going to put a note here let's stand to our feet musicians can come but i'm not quite done i just want you to stand here okay live streamers love you all god bless you i'm going to share our beautiful testimony here as we close here let me put a note here that has stopped so right there's 50 minutes i stopped at 50
