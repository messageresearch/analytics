TRANSCRIPT
========================================
by the grace of god let's go to uh isaiah reject the chapter i believe it was 59 if i'm not mistaken isaiah 59 19 i like to continue on this mighty man series here at part seven i'm gonna finish up what i didn't finish on wednesday and then lord willing i'll look at this scripture about when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him amen he's the waymaker thank you jesus isaiah 59 19. that's 85 19. it's just amazing to see all through the scripture how god always fights for his people god doesn't let other people fight he comes and fights himself praise god amen how grateful we should be to our lord jesus christ amen the bear calls in the five-star general how many believe he's a five-star general highest ranking general there could be praise god let's read verse 19 together if we can ready one two three so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the horizon of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him let's have one more word of prayer if you haven't eat on your heart let's just make it known unto god there's seven seven or eight laying there on my page the lord the lord knows all of them heavenly father we just come again the mighty name of jesus you're the waymaker the promised keeper light of the darkness even when we don't see it we know you're working god we know you're working now lord god lord we're thankful that you're working on our behalf lord god the scripture says your eyes run to and fro upon the earth or looking for someone you can show yourself strong in so lord may we be strong today we repent of any doubt we repent of any unbelief any sin lord any lust of the eyes thus of the flesh or pride of life forgive us of these things oh god lord may you find faith strong in us today oh god that you can use us god for your glory we're trusting in you the living god we know all things are possible to them that believe lord god so lord may faith come by hearing hearing by the word of god let your word raise our faith i have nothing lord i know that uh apart from you i can do nothing none of us can do anything but we're trusting in the living god the lord we can be vessels that you can float through lord flow through each one of us lord there's power in our gifts in each one of us the lord you place these gifts in our lives god so i pray you minister lord to all the needs lord god flow through each person god and may the word of god be glorified today lord jesus may you be magnified may you raise up a standard today i pray hallelujah give us a standard of your word i pray in jesus christ's name and the saints said amen god bless you should be in seattle praise god hallelujah so we'd like to start here uh with where we left off uh on wednesday night by god's grace i have some uh scriptures here to show it's good to see about daniel as well bye guys let's give her a new keep round back to the house of god amen amen so looking at part seven here uh by god's grace i just changed the text you know i think i'm gonna be focusing uh we're going more on that isaiah 59 scripture but we were we were pulling from second timothy 3 where paul said all scripture is profitable for you for doctrine for correction uh the bible said the scripture will make you perfect unto every good work so we know there's power in the word of god if we're going to be mighty today paul said the scripture works within me mightily to warn to teach others uh then we know we can draw strength from everything in this entire bible praise god i was talking with somebody this week and they said brother jesse is the whole word of god thus saith the lord like when abraham lied was that thus saith the lord i said i said well the record of it was thus saith the lord but god didn't tell abraham to lie never understand so all these stories are thus saith the lord they're accurate stories there's records of these are true records of what god has done praise god but we wouldn't say when it recorded someone sinning the sin itself wasn't thus saith the lord but the fact that it happened was and and i love it and each time these cases with believers whenever a believer falls short it's thus saith the lord god's going to redeem them praise god amen every single case hallelujah when you're a real believer god won't let you fall too far but his merciful hand will reach out and he'll grab you and he'll pull you back into the fold praise god because god is faithful hallelujah so i hope your faith has been encouraged that he can work mightily in your life through this little homo series here and uh i know i know it's a reality whether we see it or not like a tree that's planted by rivers of water as we said last week as long as we stay planted by the waters of light the working of the holy spirit our lives will grow and we'll bring forth the fruits and due season praise god we'll stay planted near christ oh god god's given us a fresh water source amen hallelujah we are planted by a fresh water source hallelujah and we're drawing on the waters of life and it's helping us to grow up into him look church here we stand another week later praise god we're standing on the promise of god amen we're planted by the living waters amen and our fruit doesn't wither praise god we still got love we still got patience we still got long suffering amen we still got faith hallelujah and the word of god why because we're planted by a living water amen amen so whether we see it mightily or not god is working in our lives mightily because we're still standing for jesus christ we have not denied the faith praise god we've denied satan hallelujah and we've overcome satan all week amen amen here we stand today letting the holy spirit work mightily in our lives praise god all right now we ended wednesday on how you overcome laziness and we looked at how the way to overcome is to get sincerity back where we have our fear and trembling and we're in a spot of worshiping jesus kiss the son we worship him see we love him uh it was the pharisees that wouldn't worship jesus right and we got to be careful when that pharisee spirit comes around here when that intellectual spirit comes and satan comes to try to tempt us we got to cast that aside and we have to worship jesus like he's our husband praise god we've got to have the liberty of the holy spirit for where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty to worship praise god we can worship and we don't have to be ashamed we don't care what anybody thinks all three cares what jesus thinks praise god amen and we have that freedom to worship praise god uh but we also have this this real godly fear as we said we know god can take our lives at any time we know god could take anything from us our health our jobs our possessions and so we have this reverential fear and yet we rejoice the bible says we rejoice with trembling amen so while we're rejoicing we're also trembling god everything is in god's hands he is in control of everything nothing surprises him he's watching over everything he's looking at every detail he's in every detail this is the love of god that where we cannot get lazy on god i heard a preach i was listening to a good sermon yesterday from a preacher message preacher down in louisiana and it's uh in christ you're you're in when you're a real christian you know you're secure in christ you're secure in your relationship with god but you're always seeking as well i thought that was a good i just want to share that statement you're secure but you're always seeking more of god amen amen hallelujah amen brother graham said when you get the holy ghost he said the token it makes you so relaxed right so that's in your soul and your soul you you have to relax you have relaxation in other words you have security praise god but in your mind you're constantly battling every single day it is the greatest battle ever fall right so you're secure in your soul right but but then he says he says i can't relax he said he said since i've got the token he said i can't relax in his mind in his human mind because he doesn't want to fall short of god's glory he says that the message of desperation he said in token he said i'm so relaxed but then in the evening service desperation he said i can't relax i've been in desperation since god has revealed himself to me because i've got to take care of two other realms praise god right i've got to take care of my mind and my flesh and pulse and i beat under i beat my flesh under subjection so that i will not be a castaway as we said last sunday hallelujah amen i've seen another one last night i can't remember what it was now i just thought it would come to me but that's not coming to me i see another metaphor so now there's at least 14 metaphors brothers we were talking about those last week now we also looked at paul's in the new testament we are to work out our salvation with fear and trembling amen there's uh there should be times in our lives when we come to church and we're trembling under the presence of god we really need god to move or we're something is between life and death praise god because it's god paul says it's god working in you both to will and do his good pleasure in other words there's always going to be two choices the perfect will or the permissive will and paul says here it gives us the illustration the idea that when we need to choose the perfect will of god we may be in a moment of troubling we we may not be sure which way does god want us to go and so it makes us trouble if uh it's god bringing the pressure upon our lives amen god's allowing pressure so we'll really be sincere and in that moment then the bible said god will work with us and define the perfect will of god but look he brings us down to a pressure amen because when the pressure's on you it really shows what you're made of amen hallelujah we said do all things without murmurings and complaining praise god don't complain don't murmur praise god right god's god's gonna take care of it amen now this one i didn't get to again we looked at you know one of these days i'm gonna preach on slavery in the bible one of these days i'm going to get there i'm not this this will not be the day but i haven't studied i've been sending other things like this this subject and uh when the enemy comes in like a flood but paul told the servant these are sirs these are slaves in roman the roman government and roman captivity be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with what fear and trembling so see again we get this idea you know even when you're serving your boss at your word you want to be so reverent to your boss to the owners right of the company you want to be so reverent you don't want to get lazy on them either right you don't want to get too lax or too uh comfortable you want to be humble you want to be quick to learn you want to recognize i may make mistakes and i want to be corrected and uh i'm needing guidance i'm needing more of god amen in singleness of heart as i'm the christ not with eye service i look that up eye service means you only work when people are watching you i looked it up may god help us all churches right in other words he's telling the slaves don't just work when the when the boss is around and you might get a whip on those days they would have got whipped they could have died under capital punishment don't work just when somebody's watching you work like god is always watching you praise god not with eye servants as men don't please men lord so you only work hard uh uh if you're afraid of men if you want to please men and sometimes but you'll work hard all the time if you want to be a god pleaser amen there goes my voice see that's what a servant of christ does they're not lazy they serve god from the depths of their heart praise god amen with good will doing service as is the lord not to men right so each one of us each one of us have a job right and a boss well our attitude should be why thank god for my boss but really my greater boss is jesus but i'm going to serve my earthly boss like i'm serving my heavenly boss and the church said amen that's what the bible says we can't be lazy so see we've got scripture and we can use the scripture lord i'm going into work today with fear and trembling or i'm taking the home school lesson i'm taking the homeschool course today i'm reading this book with fear and trembling because i'm not learning from my parents i'm learning from god praise god like i remember i told you i think i told you this when i wrote the first book about modesty i always wondered why would god have me still go to college but when i was in college i found that book about what americans wore so i just saw how even my college experience god was guiding that what if i would have skipped class that day i could not have wrote that first book if i would have skipped class that day but i never skipped class i never studied class i didn't unless i was maybe i'd take kristin out or something like that but i hardly i'd rarely ever ever skip to class because it was it was i knew it was a special gift i was a christian i knew i was called to be faithful praise god if i had not been faithful that class i would not have that book out there i'm still getting testimonies about that book praise god i got one this week as well see because you have to realize i'm doing this for god my whole life speaks of jesus christ praise god amen in every area of my life i'm supposed to manifest the character of jesus christ so they see in third grade they see jesus christ and you as a third grader as a senior as a sophomore they see jesus christ in your life in every action because you're not serving man you're not a man pleaser you're a god pleaser amen amen and here's what you know whatever good you do on your job or in school god is going to pay you back amen i don't tell you i praise god that's what the bible said whatever good any man look at that any man it's even sinners if god sees anyone doing good that means it's an attribute of god they've learned that from god god placed that in them whether the man is good or the woman is good or bad whatever they do he will receive or she will receive some benefit some dividend some interest some payback from the lord himself god is watching us praise god we should be mighty workers on the job amen no doubt it's hard sometimes that's called seasons of uh trial right that's because that's called the trial of your faith praise god so what do you do you get through the trial get the victory and you renew your strength again praise god see whether he be bond or free so whether you are a slave in the roman system those days where you be a slave to your mortgage lender like me the bible says whatever good you do god will pay you back hallelujah when you when you serve god with singleness of heart your heart's not divided between the world and god no everything i do is with singleness of heart i've got one motive i got one objective to serve jesus christ praise god i know he placed me here i know he gave me this position on this job or in this school i know he's brought me here i know he's blessed me here i'm serving him and he will reward me because i'm doing what he wants me to do praise god you didn't even ask to be more praise god you didn't ask his country you'd be born in god bless you here god did exactly all about it but he'll reward you for doing his will praise god amen hallelujah he doesn't want lazy believers he wants believers to approach it with fear and trembling i love what brother anderson he's talking about jesus preaching out of the boat with the disciples he said i can see jesus moving getting a little closer all the time the crowds got great i could hear him get in the boat thrust a little from the bank he borrowed a ship from sight look he borrowed that wasn't jesus's ship in the natural now it was eternally because the bible said christ created all things hallelujah but as far as earthly in the earthly realm of economics that boat belonged to peter and he got through speaking he said to simon now you launch out into the deep and let down for the draw jesus never borrows nothing from you but what he will pay you back a hundred-fold praise god what do you do he sent him out there remember he said throw the net on the other side what do you get you got a huge huge catch how do you if you give anything if you dedicate anything about this dedicating your children think about dedicating your strength your energy anything you dedicate to jesus christ he'll pay you back a hundred fold amen amen that's exactly right praise god he said let him have your faith tonight how many want him to have your faith today praise god amen hallelujah the little boy come one time with some fishes in his hand there's 5 000 people standing there more now the little boy had five fishes it wasn't very much in his hands church my job my life isn't very much in my hands oh but if i could just place it in jesus's hands my time is not very much it seems limited oh but don't worry if you place it in a greater person's hands they can do more with your life than you can amen that's the very purpose you were created to praise god to give god the opportunity to place your life into the nail scarred hands of jesus christ the eternal hands of jesus christ and watch him bless it and it'll be abundant it'll go above and beyond anything you could ask or think amen hallelujah oh hallelujah wasn't very much it's not very much in my hands my life is not very much to me but oh my when it's put into the masters hands what it could do it fed five thousand the master's hand and what little you have tonight just give it into the hands of the master then launch launch out into the deep and let down i just say jesus take all of me praise god take all of me now let's launch out to the deep praise god amen i love it now i'm not going to go through i'm going to go through these quickly remember the bible said in proverbs keep or guard from danger your heart with all diligence so your your feelings and your affections for jesus protect that with all your strength in other words don't fall in love with anything else in the world guard your heart guard your love amen all right right because love is the motivator behind all works lovers of pleasures more lovers of god right but jesus said we love the light so we come to light so our deeds are manifest in the light praise god amen put away from your forward life i'm sorry forward mouth rather and perverse let's put far from me let thine eyes look right on and let thine islands look straight before they see don't don't get your eyes off the of the lord keep your eyes straight ahead on the lord keep your eyes off the things of the world but i forgot that out of it are the issues of life so whatever you love whatever your love is focused on out of that will come forth life you'll find life to do it if you really love something you're going to find a way to get there right like when chris and i were recording you know i would have every now and then the football season i'd have one day up and we would like work and train and have all these weeks but i get one day off so that morning i get up at 6 a.m i drive three hours to see her and i'd stay real late i stay until like midnight you know and then and then i get home at 3am you know and i go to practice the next day you know see because whatever you love it's easy to do right so whenever we love when we love jesus if we love a natural person that much how much more shall we love jesus praise god i got to share austin austin works sometimes till 2 30 a.m and then come to church at 10 a.m the next that same morning right brother i've seen him do it amen i like that praise god whenever you love you'll make sure you have time for it praise god but you got to guard your love with all diligence peter said the same give all diligence to keep adding to your life that's why we keep coming back to the house of god to add more strength to add more character praise god to add more anointing amen to us to let jesus add to our lives praise god amen give diligence to make your calling election sure for if you do these things you will never fail so you can if you can humble yourself and actually do the word of god not just talk about that's what we always do sometimes you know we always talk about the rapture or we talk about these things or talk about that we don't want to just be talkers we want to be dealers see we'll talk and say well i heard a good word today or i read a good thing today i'm going to do this we better make sure we do it let's not just talk about it let's do it because peter says in doing in obedience is the power the power is in obedience because if you do these things you will prove your calling you'll prove your call to be the gentile bride of jesus christ if you do the word of god amen hallelujah that will prove your calls that will prove you're elected that will prove you're predestinated that will prove your ordained that approve you were chosen in the mind of christ before the foundation of the world and so there will be an entrance for you jesus will let you enter into heaven praise god if you do the word of god an entrance will be open to you what a blessing and how many times will you follow church how many times do you fall never you never fall see you'll go through battles but you'll never fall you'll never be a castaway like a judas right you'll never be shipwrecked like judas praise god you'll never uh you'll never be apostate like dennis and love the things of the world more than the prophet of god's message amen see but you got to give all diligence can't be lazy amen peter says i just defined it there diligence means uh just uh earnestness that means you really earnest means you really want to do it you have a great desire to do it you're eager i'm eager to do this think about what you're eager to do on your day off what are you eager to do on your day off i'm not talking about the boring stuff i'm talking about the exciting stuff what's the what's that what's something you're eager to do on your day off do that that's we don't have that same attitude towards the things of god i i believe it i'm eager to go to church every sunday i'm sorry nobody's gotta make me i'm eager every wednesday night no one's got a baby praise god hallelujah eager to do it that's what all diligence is give all eagerness to add to let god add his character to your heart and life praise god let's be eager for the things of god and jesus it really says this is the greatest commandment because you must love god with all your strength all your eagerness all your love this is the greatest commandment to love jesus christ with all your heart so let's not be lazy i'm gonna i'm gonna want to be eager for uh for jesus by god's grace let's not be lazy now i just i'm just showing this quote because i preached this a couple years ago and i did the purpose series but i just look at that look at that man look at look at the bags of his eyes no doubt crying and fasting for the civil war six hundred thousand men that died on these grounds here in america look at his hair did he look like he even had a comb you know got time to comb his hair men are dying right there right better die in the battles abraham lincoln i love what brother ever says he says he was deprived of an education think of that he had no education growing up but yet there was something in his heart there was a purpose in his heart this is why i wasn't lazy god placed something in his heart he said i like a man of vision i like people that's got something they're fighting for see mighty men and women what are you fighting for you must be fighting for something here this morning amen not just laying around well whatever comes along that'll be all right so there's something shirts that are not all right this proves it when something's happened to us they are not all right and we've got to overcome them by the grace of god we have to rebuke them right we have to cast them down we might have to pray until we get the victory there's some things that are not all right in our lives it's when the enemy comes in like a flood he said i love these words i got right on my phone oh be up and at it and lincoln never let his education stand in the way he had something to do so even though he could you know when he got to his teenage years or adulthood he could have said well i never had an education i guess i'm not going to go into politics but what he could have said he could have complained he said well everybody's 15 years ahead of me so why why even bother do that do not just give an example like like why are they even going to college now everybody's already got their degree that's my age i don't know what god's leading you to do i'm just saying it's just a simple example well they've already got ahead of me here i'm already way behind but lincoln didn't let that stop him because there was something in his heart to deliver those slaves amen that's what it was there's something in his heart and he just had to make up for his education he just had to keep going amen he didn't believe those voices he went by the leaning of god that god had placed in his heart he was a man of vision praise god he saw those slaves set free how did jesus saw you set free hallelujah where did he see it in his mind before the foundation of the world he knew you'd be free and free indeed in christ's holy name amen [Music] he had something to do i just feel like i got to get into politics he'd say i think every christian not just the preachers every christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it he talks about people that attend this chapter of the businessman fellowship he said have a purpose in life something you're going to do he said let's go do something about it praise god all right you like that praise god that's awesome i love that now i preached over this a few weeks ago so i'm not going to spend much time with the bible says if you plant to the holy spirit you shall of the holy spirit reap life everlasting so human effort human effort you know i always look at the human effort of my wife out in our garden she goes there every spring and plants those onions or those garlic or that corn right or the potatoes right it's human effort she she could she could have all the seeds there and say lord bring forth the corn bring forth the corn right she can stand there and praise it i speak to that seed i speak to that chord right she can do all that right but it wouldn't do nothing because you got to follow the laws of god amen god requires human effort for fruit to be brought forth praise god just like god requires effort for you and i if you want to see the fruits of the holy spirit if you want to see fruits to our lives through our ministries it requires us taking what god has given us and us to have a purpose and know what god's taught us to do and then go do it praise god amen have a purpose amen to me i believe in speaking we've spoken to we spoke in the bearing wounds right and they brought forth we spoke into different situations you know cygnicism you speak but i'm saying not every time is going to be just speaking to it sometimes there's human effort into it also like this most of the time there's human effort into it of all the testimonies i think we've ever had i think most of it involves some human effort right pray come up for prayer i'll confess you know seek god pray trust the lord you know listen to more sermons humble yourself repent in most cases human effort is required so your human effort connects to certain rewards spiritually now i think this is the so i'm moving on from lazy's laziness now to death here faith in the holy scriptures make you mighty to overcome death or say like this the fear of death i love this i was just a baptist preacher and i thought my if this baptist preacher could have faith like this what about me look at the bible says i love it so see we're not going in the tribulation because of this right here oh i love this hey i did a friend my second favorite chapter after isaiah 53 i think his first thousand chapter five praise god okay so if i ever have a funeral do isaiah 53 honey and if i think i got a second chapter put this one up there for me praise god for god has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ i'm going to be delivered i'm saved i'm rescued by jesus christ hallelujah who died for us that weather so i love this idea whether whether i live or die i'm not alone the bible says whether i wake i'm awake or i sleep i go to the grave we should or we do live together with him praise god what a promise if i die tonight in my sleep don't cry too long because i'm with jesus i'm together with christ amen each one of us that's a reality praise god whether i wait or whether i sleep i'm with christ christ is with me and he's with if he's with me he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me praise god baptist preachers like 80 86 and he said this is the scripture i've been quoting every night before i go to bed because i'm worried about dying i thought what an honest soul praise god what a beautiful scripture to quote whether i make it through this night or not whether i wake or sleep i'm living together with christ amen in other words christ christ has made an abode in my soul praise god amen i am the tabernacle of god amen no you're not children you are the temple of the holy ghost amen hallelujah he wants to live in you abide in you speak through you he's walking with you praise god whether you live or die you are christ and christ will be with you what a hallelujah amen he said that has taken away the fear of death from his life an 86 year old preacher he's got some good wisdom too and for a baptist he's pretty wise he's got a gift of wisdom now real born again child of god looks to heaven and knows the father holds the reigns of all things you believe that amen god holds the reigns on your job god holds the reigns on your family your brothers and sisters praise god amen your aunts and uncles he holds the reigns he controls all those things he's got it all under control we saw a couple riding horses the other night on our daily reminding me they had the rings they got it all controlled the one the male horse got a little jumpy so the woman slapped him on the side of the neck i don't know if that's right but i said that's interesting she slapped it right there and then by the end they got back on the ride she's all kissed at him oh you did a good ride boy you know all these things like she got him by the reins she had control god has everything under control praise god amen i'm not teaching i'm preaching to you praise god i do a lot of teaching but i want to praise you praise god amen preaching is declaring the good news it's good news god has everything in your life under the reigns of his control praise god you can trust god with your life he does all things well not some things all things well and there's neither death nor sorrow for a christian wait what brother what there's neither death nor sorrow for a christian why brother adam because christians don't die there's not one scripture that says a christian dies it's very vice versa jesus said if you die believe on him you pass from death into life in other words death in that case means separation from god you'll never be separated from god you won't go down to the grave or go down to the pit you'll go up to heaven you go up to the heavenly rails you'll go up where the angels of god are where the heavenly hosts say holy holy holy is the lord god almighty you're going up to the place of holiness praise god not the lower place of hell and that's the greatest thing that put fear over man was death but jesus died for us and death is swallowed up in victory amen so when coming to the end of this road like saint paul he said o death where is i stinging great where is thy victory but said thanks be to god who gives us the victory to our lord jesus christ amen i used to wonder sometimes what's the matter with the christian church they're so scared of things why you got nothing to be scared about well the first word nearly jesus said after the resurrection was fear not the very first thing he says don't be afraid see don't fear don't get scared there ain't nothing going to happen nothing can happen nothing can bother a christian amen not even death itself can touch the christian he that hears my words and believes on him that sent me and has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life amen death itself has no reign over a christian christ died in our stead amen what a marvel what a faith that ought to build up in the people something that will tow the mark you'll never get nothing by being a little jellyfish christian did you ever see a jellyfish you just hit him he spatters all over everything i've never hit a jellyfish but i trust the prophet have you seen him a jellyfish you don't want usually eats them crabs and things on the side of the seashore comes up his pincher and cuts him in two and takes him down since the jellyfish just lays there so jellyfish is floating around i think i've seen a couple videos of them right they just float around and then a crowd will come up with his pictures and just because he's floating he's not really active he has no defense he just sits there and chops him up into little pieces oh let's not let the devil chop us up into little pieces let's if we know the devil's to come let's move out of the way amen or even better let's hit him back praise god remember on wednesday they said he put the devil or scriptures right in the devil's face put it right in his face don't let that guy chop you up don't let him chop your dreams up and your desires and your hopes praise god don't let them chop up all your love and all your devotion to god don't let them chop up all your uh uh your diligence and things like that stand there but fight or move out of the way we read it where paul says paul don't do the flee from youthful lost phrase god right that's right see the jedi just lays there and lets them beat them up and cut them up don't lay their children fleeing from youthful love and father righteousness peace joy and the holy ghost praise god don't just be a jellyfish let's sing cut up all your desires just try to do away with everything that's good in your life ruin everything in your life he says brother we need some christians not jellyfish but with a backbone i think we're talking about vertebrates and invertebrates if i'm right in science it's been a while since i've studied that but i think that's what we're talking about oh i don't mean fuss with people so see brother man when you when you're strong in the faith you don't fuss with people but you stand for the god-given rights that christ died for amen praise god so you can i've seen brother uh dennis mcbride do this all the time we've sat and talked with him and different people and think people will say things you don't agree with and he'll just i just it's so funny they just look at him like that and they'll say well brother i kind of see it like this [Laughter] that's how he that's how he uh he differs with people he just lets them say whatever they want and just so sweetly the bible said uh if you answer with a soft word you turn away wrath if i ever seen it right there real good it's your brother dennis see man so i kind of see it this way brother that's a great way see he's not fussing with people but he's standing for his beliefs amen i like that praise god see we don't get no not pushed around we don't have to be you don't be pushed around by the devil amen no sir we got inheritance and our inheritance belongs to us it's your privilege to have anything you've inherited through accepting jesus christ and dying to yourself how marvelous satan said well i'll tell you what i'm going to do so here's an example we'll get to this in a moment of the enemy coming in like a flood james says i'll tell you what i'm going to do now i'll tell you what's going to happen isn't the devil think he's like some prophet or something like that he's going to tell you what this bad's going to happen that bad how does he know what's going to happen he don't know what's going to happen he's not god but he wants you to he wants you to jump ahead and be fearful and be afraid and make a wrong decision because of fear well i'll tell you what's going to happen well i'll tell you brother brother malcolm let me tell you what's going to happen that's satan coming in like a flood hmm right and look what brother adam says no you ain't going to do nothing well i'll tell you what's going to happen no satan you're not doing that you're not telling me nothing is going to happen hallelujah that's the way to talk back to him i just showed you church i just showed myself now i know how to talk back to satan satan touches this thing no that ain't gonna happen no you're wrong about that no you're wrong jesus says this i'm taking my inheritance i know what the bible says praise god say i know my position in christ and you might as well get away you might as well get behind me satan i'm not listening no more i got promises i got vindications i've got thus saved the lord i know what the bible says praise god amen oh i like that it goes back to acts 2 38 is our promise he says and the blood of jesus is just as good as it would be shed 10 minutes ago jesus blood was shed 2 000 years ago but it's just as powerful right now in 2022 praise god i don't care if they have the shroud of taurus i don't care if they've got nails all the 50 nails they got that supposedly went in jesus i don't care what they got none of that has any virtue the virtue is in the spirit the life of the blood that was shed amen the virtues in the life of jesus christ and it's just his father david it'll never lose his power reaches to the highest mountains of victory but also for us it goes to the very depths the lowest valley we could ever be in god's spirit is there to meet us he stands with us in the valley of the shadow of death amen amen and so i'll fear no evil because he's with me amen hallelujah amen the blood is just as real as if we were just on the cross and just heard him say it is finished we all be weeping and crying just as real praise god he said every believer it's your profession that's what hebrews says do not lose the confidence of your profession of faith he says in church isn't this true sometimes we get scared to use our rights that's awesome right sometimes you get scared but god is merciful remember peter said god's divine power has given us all things everybody say all things again ready oh i wonder what's like last year right oh we have all things that we need to live a life of godliness and holiness that's right how because we've been given precious great impressions not just promises great and precious god can't use any other words oh these promises are more than promises they're great and precious praise god look at the wording god used god even used exceedingly abundantly above all yet exceeding abundance look at that exceeding abundance now for spiritual gifts for spiritual rewards not so much natural but it's spiritual praise god exceeding abundance so here's abundant so exceedingly abundant is way up here he's going to do exceedingly abundant above all we ask our thing according to his will his good pleasure praise him all right that's what that's what i've been preaching on labor on we must first find the will of god and then when we find the will of god then he'll do exceedingly above the abundant that he promised hallelujah because he wants us to partake he wants us to feast or enjoy his divine nature in other words lord i want your i want your faith to flow through me right i want your virtue your knowledge i want your your patience to flow through me and when i see myself patient where i wasn't patient last time when i see that patience there now i can rejoice because i'm i'm enjoying his divine nature amen i can see i've grown and now the nature of the holy spirit is flowing through me it's no longer the human nature of jesse smith getting in the way but it's christ's nature amen so now we appreciate them new we've preached on all these topics the church here's what your inheritance is you have hope instead of depression amen that's your inheritance that's right so satan says well look what's going to happen you're going to be depressed say stop the devil get behind me my inheritance is hope i have a real hope my home is anchored in heaven praise god that's your inheritance depression is not your inheritance hallelujah satan says god doesn't see you no the bible says i am cared for and all he got to do is cast his care on the lord praise god amen he does see me saint says you're not loved i can go thus saying romans 9 he that the gentiles that were not of his people are his people i can say thus say the scripture satan i am god's people and i am beloved amen amen i've got thus saying the scripture hallelujah i'm loved so stop it satan get behind me when you doubt what's going to happen say i'm going to trust in the lord with all my heart amen he is trustworthy i don't know he's trustworthy amen satan say oh you need to be stressed out about this oh you better worry about this this may happen i'm going to have the peace of god that's my inheritance instead of anxiety amen as i ended with this one on wednesday god always causes me to triumph in christ hallelujah always he always makes me come out on top hallelujah hey man kind of liking my this is just the natural uh my senior year i never lost a race until the second to last race i got second place but it was a preliminary it wasn't the final race and so i lost that race because i was tired i was sad that our team had dropped the baton in the previous race i was sad i was discouraged the next day cam came up and cam was like don't he was a christian at that time he said he's like stop worrying about that he said just he's like my leg was hurting he's like he's like take that thing off take that thing off your leg and just run just just be yourself jess i remember cam gave me this pep talk and so i went out there and i won the next two things and then i had i got a re-race on that race i lost the day before in the finals so in the finals i got to run it again and that time the lord calls me to triumph and i want that ring straight's got him i lost the preliminary because i was discouraged but cam's word lifted me up praise god and i come back and so i ended the season where i never lost praise god as far as finals i never lost he always caused me this triumph now see satan wants to make us a failure spiritually or naturally but we don't have to accept that because the bible says god always will cause us to triumph in christ jesus amen amen in other words it will do the word of god it will obey the word of god he'll work it out where you in the battle praise god he'll make sure you win amen go make sure you come out with a pure heart praise god amen and we saw it today your inheritance is to be diligent not lazy so you can say satan i'm not i'm not called to be lazy i'm called to be diligent get behind me satan here's what we did last time the bible said there are many many other afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers me out of all of them my brother jesus i go through so many hard times that's okay the lord's delivery out of every single one i i've never seen a fail yet praise god don't we all the bible said all that live uh godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution some more public than others but god promised this church even though we have these afflictions that seem unending god will bring us out of everyone now we could take revenge satan could say take revenge on that brother yeah take revenge on that sister but our answer should be safe to get behind me i'm going to be good to my enemies amen venus is mine saith the lord don't forget those last words saith the lord because you might quote the scripture and say vengeance is mine and then stop and then you would try to take vengeance finish those three more important words vengeance is mine the lord not mine but vengeance is god's don't leave out those three important words instead of lusting satan will bring a lust to attract you then come back with purity so i made a covenant with my eyes not to look upon a maid praise god my eyes were made to look straight ahead praise god not to the right not to do that praise god my eyes are trained to look on spiritual truths praise god satan says you should be impatient just go make it happen go make it happen yourself but god says no be patient and have expectation that's your inheritance don't try to make something happen you trust god to make it happen amen we saw this oh oh oh god uh satan says oh see look god don't love you you lack food you like money or you're like this you're like that the bible says i can do all things through christ who strengthens me amen god shall supply all my need ah according to his riches in glory in christ jesus praise god amen amen that's the promise of god well i feel abandoned like israel i'll never get to the place i'm supposed to be no satan you're a liar god said if he's gonna put israel in their position with all of his heart and soul god will do the same thing for you praise god because you're not just a servant you're a wife praise god amen oh he gotta use his whole heart and soul to place his bride right in the middle of his perfect will praise god i know you're getting tired let me try to finish up here by god's grace thank you the spirit of god will always lift up a standard amen now i never quite understood this so i have a little note on that i've always known like a standard is like a banner or a flag but i've always thought you know like flood water so i've always thought god would like you know build up some type of a bridge or you know wall or something like that but it's not that i've always thought it differently like that i've never quite understood this and then yesterday i was in the prayer closet in the morning i was crying i was you know confessing my sins i was asking god to help heal people and everything and all of a sudden this scripture came to my mind and it actually stirred me up in my prayer closet oh i want to preach on that tomorrow i was just saying i was just praying all of a sudden i said when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard against it amen i'm just confessing my battles to the lord and asking god to be merciful and that scripture it's like the scripture struck me and i i just i started weeping and praising the lord i'm gonna preach that tomorrow so i finished studying i took the kids on our our you know usual daddy day we call it you know the errands and and i was just scrolling you know i was listening to sermon on saturday before and i found a brother and a message in his sermon was this that was the title this uh when the enemy comes in like a flood i'm like oh i just prayed that this morning that don't happen very much i believe that's god so i listened to it and then i went he was referencing some commentary so i went and looked at some commentaries so let's look at some of these thoughts here now the word standard is used 20 times in the old testament 22 rather it means like a flagpole or a banner okay so flat yes now three of these verses three out of these 22 speak of a god lifting up a standard against the enemy three of them now in numbers chapter one we're not going to read all this but the bible said israel now this is when they're after they've left egypt right and god's numbering them right before they go in the wilderness the children of israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp and every man by his own standard through their hosts so if you're an israelite you are assigned to this flag or you're assigned to that flag but the levite shall pitch around the tabernacle the testimony amen the levites didn't have a flag they just had god amen praise god they had no flag all they had was the pillar of fire over the tabernacle of the holiest place amen thank god amen it's either one you got you got a good place because you either got god's standard or you got god himself as your standard amen [Applause] that there be no wrath upon the congregation of children of israel and levite shall keep the charge of the tabernacle testimony so if you read numbers chapter one and two you'll see all the tribes all 12 tribes are given one of four standards or banners or flagpoles and there's four standards judah dan ephraim and reuben so to the north was dan east judah west ephraim and then south was reuben so god says my army is now going to move out of justification in the sanctification and they got to reach the promised land praise god and if they're going to reach it they need four beasts i mean four of flagpoles i mean four standards praise god amen they're gonna reach the baptism of the holy ghost if they reach the promised land they need four beasts they need four anointings that'll guide my church into its position to receive its inheritance amen oh it's not like the church does that amen god gives us four anointings to bring the church in the right complete uh complete inheritance complete location glory now the standard was the position of the family army and you would always fight by your family side church when so when you go out to battle if you're a man you want to fight by strangers you're fighting by your own family because that's where you hung out you hung out with your your banner your standard you couldn't say well i don't want to go over i'd rather hang out with this person i already don't like my family all right you can do that you have to stay with where god placed you because god knew the best place for you amen it's like that story of uh was it manasseh or ephraim in the promised land remember they come to joshua and said we're too big uh it might have been ibrahim or manasseh we need more land and joshua's like no you got to conquer the land you've already got what a beautiful type preachers are trying to go do things or people try to go help other people when they haven't let god help them you can't move on to help somebody if your life's in a mess you got to possess your land first then you can help somebody else same thing here you pitch by your family's banner you stay with your family and you fight with your family i mean fight the enemy you might fight you know in nice ways you might disagree but you always you're always with your family and you fight next to your brothers and sisters now here's the first verse that says lifting up a standard isaiah 49 22 thus saith the lord god behold i will lift up my hand to the gentiles this is like a hand of invitation i'm going to lift my hand to invite them see gentiles going to come in and set up my standard to the people so he said i'm going to lift my hand of the gentiles and i'm going to set a standard for the gentiles and they shall bring their sons in their arms and their daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders sound familiar about the precious love of god placing us on our on his shoulders praise god here's what albert barnes said a standard or an enzyme was erected in times of war to rally the forces of a nation around it here it is god would erect an ensign high in the sight of all nations and will call them to himself as a military leader musters his forces for battle so god is basically saying i'm the general i'm the leader of this army and i'm going to raise my hand and i'm going to invite the gentiles i've only to this point i've only gathered in the jews oh glory but now i'm raising my hand to the rest of the nations and saying come stand under my inside bring your sons and daughters don't leave your children behind amen bring them along and come stand we're rallying here right he says uh this is a time of battle and the title battle come to my side if you want to be saved come and stand with me praise god oh hallelujah come rally around jesus christ amen church there's a lot of people rallying around other things in christ like tick-tock's the big rallying thing right now they're round around black lives matter which all lives matter yeah you know the rally around the democrats and they rather around the republicans but we're supposed to rally around the one glory the god of heaven jehovah who's lifted up his hand and invited us to come praise god that's who we rally around amen because it's time for battle now next we see the same scripture but we see the tenth the parents tenderly hold their children and let them sit upon their shoulders so this is this is jesus inviting all the gentiles come to me battles approaching come to me and carry your children carry your children or set them on your shoulders he didn't say anything about weapons did he in this case he didn't say anything about the armor of god he said first come to the location where the generals act first be gathered with your people there it is right there amen first be gathered to jesus christ amen it's it's a battle time there's there's there's all kinds of enemies out there but we must flee we must go where the standard has been raised we must go where there's a flag flying with the enzyme that says jesus christ is king amen bring your children to don't leave them behind see a lot of people abandon their children right they let their children sin and get those sinful things and lustful things they abandon their children but we're supposed to bring them along praise god and look at this bring them when they're young too bring them let the little ones come to jesus hallelujah now let's move now to the next one that's the first one he's inviting all the gentiles to this standard and now this was our text when the enemy comes in like a flood the wind of the lord because spirit means ruach here this is the same ruach the hole in the holy spirit hovered over the earth in genesis chapter one the wind of the holy spirit so when you see the enemy coming in it looks like he's around he's coming in like a flood he's all around us he's sweeping in when the enemy comes in god will come down like a wind and raise up a standard a rallying place when the enemy comes in the spirit comes in like a wind and doesn't that remind us when israel crossed the red sea praise god you know uh pharaoh and all his armies and their chariots they're chasing the enemies coming in like a flood amen but what happened god says the holy spirit the bible said moses lifted up his hand and the bible said a strong wind hallelujah the enemy was coming like a flood but the spear lord came in like a wind and raised up a standard a place where god and his people could meet right through the red city praise god amen amen oh hallelujah when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will blow against the enemy and he'll raise up a place we can rally right here we can rally we're going to walk across not on wet muddy ground we're walking on dry ground our feet will not center baby man [Applause] right where we eat the world we'll stay right where we need to step we'll step into the perfect but of god because the ruroc the wind of the holy spirit the spirit lord will make a way for us amen amen hallelujah amen thank god amen you won't lose yourself church you won't step out of the perfect will of god because the wind is the holy spirit the spirit of god has raised up a stance against the enemy and that's a type of water baptism that ain't even a type of thing look at all the rest of god provides mana water from the rock and uh hunting the rock everything we need is right around us amen amen because you never leave us christ will never forsake us you don't invite the children to come and then abandon them he carries them through he sends us wind now do you know church the enemy comes black and blood remember the the beast system is called many waters remember that in revelation 17 so we can apply this to our day the b system if you've ever never seen it now the b system is coming in like a flood i heard a preacher say this to yesterday i was alive and i was 16 years old in 1996 brother when bill clinton the american president signed the defense of marriage act because all these homosexuals were crying out for marriage rights he denied them a democrat think about that a democrat denied the homosexuals in 1996 i was 16 years old and then in 2015 barack obama uh influenced the supreme court to rule for homosexual marriage so just in my lifetime i've seen uh i've seen both sides you know you can think of how fast this flood is coming when i was 16 everything seemed to be going good and with a matter of 15 19 years it's completely the tide is completely turned they said they just wanted mayor's rights but now know it's trans rights now they want to get in our bathrooms amen because they're such filthy people right they didn't stop with marriage and now they're trying to get into our schools thank god we've got good schools around here by god's grace we have a pretty conservative area even if they told me to teach it i'd lie and say no i would not do it or maybe explain and teach it and show how it's wrong maybe i'll do that but i've never thank god i've never had to do that but look the bee system is coming in like a flood upon america and upon the whole world look what kovan did how it brought in all this fear we were at a meeting on the opening day of our of our uh school year and everybody's talking about how you know kids go through trauma and they say and they said this we've all gone through trauma because of cove that's not trauma i mean if you were sick you know and you almost died that's trauma but see the condition the beast says be afraid be afraid give up your rights uh take this shot you know take it uh take the vaccine and give up your rights and trust the government trust the word they don't know nothing they're lying and they call that trauma they're conditioning the people to give up their rights they're conditioning the people that they won't buy or sell without tomorrow they're moving them into the market beast but we're standing against the beast system the beast is coming in like a flood but god promised to raise up a standard race of a banner against that so god's people can rally with the true military general jesus christ amen hallelujah that's the scripture the beast system has never come in like a flood like it is right now that i can find because the bible said evil seducers will wax worse and worse it gets worse and worse in every generation did you ever think billy williams growing up you'd see things like we see today trans and all kinds of things like that i never thought we'd see that people with blue hair purple hair pink hair you i just never thought you see such things as this uh unbelievable the b system coming in like a flood like i said 19 years of my life from 16 to whatever age i was in 2015 35 16 to 35 they did a complete opposite and it's pushing in but thank god there's a standard for us i'm not on the enemy side i'm not joining their flood i've got a standard i've got a place to stand by hallelujah i'm where the ruach is the wind of the holy spirit that's where i am amen that's where you are the ruach of the holy spirit here's a perfect example and this is during the tribulation revelation 12 is all about the jews remember the woman with the the son and the 12 stars it's all about the jews the bible says satan will cast a flood of some type of war during the tribulation period and look the enemy comes in like a flood to the jewish people who are under the blood of bulls and goats and what does god do god helps the woman a flood is coming in you have no way to stop the flood who's ever stopped the flood it's impossible they can put the sandbags brother they can do all that but it don't stop and praise god so israel has these a fun approach all they do is they stand glory all they do is stand on the commandments of god and the testimony of jesus christ and so god in his mercy says you can't stop it but i will i'll open up the earth and i'll swallow the blood because my spirit will raise up a standard against it amen amen glory hallelujah amen that's my god that's your general that's your savior praise god when it comes to like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard again amen oh hallelujah amen ah it's beautiful church oh my goodness how many times have things like it looks like in our lives it's gonna crush us and all of a sudden it's as if the earth opened up and all of our trials fall right down it's like they never were coming where'd they go where's all my haters where's that where's all my trials where's all my bills where's all these things it's all swallowed up because that's what god how are you doing that's what he uh masters it that's what he excels in doing the impossible waymaker miracle worker promise keeper amen wind in the darkness because the wind of the spirit in the darkness amen hallelujah so jesus christ stands for the jews who have the commandments of god the old testament and the testimony of jesus christ just like we got that's right amen just like we got amen i believe that old testament i've got the old testament wing i got the new testament wing i'm a flying eagle praise god i can mount up on 59 praise god i can mount up on revelation 10 7 amen i can nod on all these promises and fly above the criticism and god will come down and he'll stop the flood and he'll put me on a rock by his side hallelujah there's the last time there's only three times the last time the bible said lift up a standard go through go through the game make the past straight doesn't sound familiar like john the baptist doesn't sound like robert's ministry make straight the path the elijah ministry he said lift up a standard for the people get the gates ready and get the highway ready because god is going to gather his people at his standard make it already see how god always makes a way for your life church if god spiritually makes a way for you to stand by this standard i'm sorry and god naturally makes a way for israel how much more is going to make way for you spiritually to reach your destination he said take away the stones make sure brother jesse doesn't trip on the highway make sure the gates are open so i'm not locked out and i have trouble i have trouble getting into the promises of god amen make sure the gates of the highways everything there's no stone because god is gathering his people to stand with him god is rallying his people in one location in christ jesus praise god amen amen amen church in the hebrew standard means a rallying point lift up a standard this is when an army is about to march oh one of these days we're marching design where's on well these days we're marching up to the holy zion praise god i'm talking about heaven hey one day we're marching up there but god's got to gather everybody before the march that's called raising up a standard when you raise up a standard the bible said god collects all the people from all their different location and he restores them into their own land in their own place in order for this to happen a command must be given and then a banner must be reared up so we can all rally around the banner amen because we're going for a trip we're setting out on a battle praise god hallelujah praise god amen what's the next verse say behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say to the daughter of god and behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work is before him so he's saying come gather around my standard my daughter of zion the bride the the woman the woman of jerusalem and we are the new jerusalem praise god see salvation deliverance comes and look he says my reward is with me and look this reminded me of the scripture jesus said he that's unjust let it be unjust he that's filthy let him be filthy that's righteous righteous he that's holy let it be holy ghost filled amen and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be i am alpha omega the beginning to end the first and the last did you know church the rapture is a lifting up of the standard the enemy is gonna come in like a flood he's gonna he's gonna say you're either gonna die or take my mark he's gonna come in like a flood and we're gonna see the squeeze coming on we're gonna be a little bit pressed you know we're gonna see the waters coming but jesus is going to raise up a standard amen he's going to raise it up in the air how did it go amen he's going to raise up in the air and he's going to call his people unto me come you gentiles i'll reach out my hands you come bring your children glory bring your loved ones come and gather unto me i'm raising up a standard come raise up here in heavenly places hallelujah in the rapture praise god he that's holy let him come my reward is with me let me tell you this church if the only reward i get is to see jesus that's good enough for me you don't have to give me no crowns church i don't have to have a crown i don't have anything special no special clothes no special sash no special ring i don't even know that just give me jesus just let me be one of those that get to see jesus jesus you're my reward amen anything else on top of that's just gravy you know hey i want jesus when he comes he's got my reward and my reward is him amen hallelujah like i said i don't care if i have 10 cities to reign over or zero as long as i get jesus well brother austin might have nine but amen definitely have ten see sometimes we have something three questions you know how many will brother william have he's got all these grandchildren he's invested in his kids you know and that don't really matter that's good i'm sure god will do that but the main thing church we need is we need jesus yes yes we're giving all diligence like i said we'll let god sort out who's the greatest let god let's not argue about it now let's not debate about it and of course we never do i'm just saying it for the live stream audience you know but our main reward is to see christ amen because at that moment our faith no longer faith our faith is sight hallelujah amen amen oh and when we see your brother amen we will we shall be like him because we'll see him as he is i'll have a body like under his glory's body but i can't wait for that new body brother i'll tie this body on man i get enough of this body and the last verse and they shall call them the holy people what the ones that come to jesus's enzyme the one that come to his standard i wonder if he's the one i wonder if he's the standard bearer he's the one holding the flag and they should call them these are the holy people that come to this ensign the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken you're called two things you are called sought after god sought after you in other words you didn't go looking for god god came rescuing you oh the overwhelming precious love of god didn't he chase you down you ran from him church but he chased you down because that's what your name your name is sought after praise god amen hallelujah that's your name he sought after you and said i'm bringing you by because you chose me i'm bringing you to my standard i'm bringing you to the rallying point for god's army and i will call you brother william not forsaken amen amen sister beatrice not forsaken amen brother jose never forsake it put your name in there brother jesse i was never forsaken because when the enemy was coming in god said gather around
