let's do announcements first though this Sunday we have two services with brother Diggs we're looking forward to him coming by God's grace all the way from South Carolina so he'll get in Saturday and then he's going to stay Saturday night Sunday night leave out Monday morning so look forward to that by God's grace thanks for everyone who was able to attend the carry in and all the the gifts they got the going-away gifts they got for brother William that was really nice I miss our brother amen but thank you for the support there by the grace of the Lord I want to just read this I guess concerning prophecy I don't know if you saw but when I was there I saw this article it's from September 22nd so that was went four days ago the Vatican and China had been at odds for decades at the center of their spat who has the right to nominate bishops today in a major concession the Vatican agreed to recognize seven bishops appointed by the Chinese government it's part of a provisional agreement under which both bei Beijing and the Pope will have a say-so on who becomes a bishop so in other words the Catholic Church just bowed to China China's like we're gonna have our own bishops and before the Vatican's like no we got to support them and now they're bowing to China see they're all bowing to Satan so it's just a I wanted to show that as a prophetic move or a prophetic event there that shows even the Uniting times how they're uniting they used to have just well we have to have our way but now the Vatican's like okay we could just do your way to China so remember the Bible said this beast must deceive all nations so that's the midst of it right there there in the midst of being deceived and being deceive is the blind leading the blind thank God we have eyes to see praise God thank God for the Holy Ghost I sound Amen I just thought I'd share that with you as a modern event made clear by prophecy so that shows the uniting and the binding of the tares perhaps that's the hour we're living in is the binding of the tares okay let's take a few prayer requests here my wife says please continue to pray for sister Brenda who had another stroke so Brenda is sick with that stroke another ones let's pray for her but Jose's wife needs to touch her eyes okay okay let's pray for her did the Lord touch your wife when we prayed for her at all okay wonderful I really felt like I was gonna answer amen praise the Lord amen I really thought God was gonna answer because I was such good service right praise the Lord God is so good a man that blessed in my heart will lift her up for the other needs to then thank you sir I was I was meaning to ask you I just can't forget oh that's so sweet by God's grace well I was just I really thought you know I thought man that was such an ordained day and thank you for bringing her brother I really appreciate that that means so much to me that you bring her in yeah amen amen and on top of that we have two other testimonies that last Wednesday you probably heard Erin and I shout and after the service he come up for prayer and he said he felt like something was squeezing his heart all day and he said instantly when I prayed for him he said all that left his heart that's why we were shouting over here so we can thank the Lord for that by God's grace I remember I was I was binding that that power and loosing him from it in Jesus name and then Tonia my wife said Tonya told my wife that was the same day we prayed for I'm sorry the day we prayed for your wife the morning we prayed for Tonya Tonya couldn't she said she told my wife she couldn't lift up her arm just to do her job she couldn't lift up her arm and she told my wife on Sunday that God healed her of that after we prayed for her and then she said

tonight by God's grace let's go to Revelation chapter 6 verse 1 so we preach Revelation chapter 1 2 3 4 or 5 I like to just just a little bit review Revelation chapter 6 maybe for one or two services by the grace of the Lord I do not have a slide show tonight so sorry about that amen well as you're standing there it's good to be back good to see the Saints in the house of Lord tonight good to see all the brothers and sisters there and I we had a really great service there was about 105 women there at the at the conference and a couple brothers to interpret and lead songs and everything and the brother asked me to preach Friday night and then brother Brooks preached Saturday morning Saturday night then I preached Sunday morning then we went back to New York into the Bronx to their church and I preached there as well so I preached three out of five services so I'm awfully worn out I'm kind of sore right here but it was good and it was wonderful I didn't get any uh you know individual testimonies but the Friday the Friday night I preached on the waters of separation and there's about a hundred women with their hands raised crying repenting of dead stuff in their homes so it's a real blessing I hadn't seen that many repent in a while that's been a good and then Sunday morning I preached on God's purpose for a woman and just kind of preached that Lia message I preached and Mary Magdalene and I kind of use different example from the scripture and sisters were blessed and it was a really good time then I preached binding and loosing Sunday night that same sermon I preached here about binding and loosing the devil and they were really blessed there but the Vaughn said it discerned his church there and there's numerous people that came up for prayer so I hope to hear some testimonies from that but God was really moving it was a real sincere group and just a wonderful time in the Lord but we're happy to be home by God's grace revelation 6 we'll just read the 1st and 2nd verse verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer let's just bow our heads here and have another word of Prayer you ever need on your heart just making known unto God Heavenly Father we just come into your presence again lord thank you for amazing grace worthy is a lamb that was slain o God you're worthy tonight of our worship our time this investment of our energy and our attention Jesus speak to us Lord we see you moving among us move continually in power Lord move amongst us by your Holy Spirit we humble ourselves we realize we're nothing your everything may we exalt you may we follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit that you might be glorified amongst us in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise the Lord hallelujah so we're happy to be here again and this is part 82 for those who keep in track I know it when he likes to keep track so part eighty two of the revelation series by the grace of the Lord I want to start off just by sharing a few quotes from brother Branham about what the the seals meant to him some of these you know it's been a little while maybe since you heard it maybe some of these maybe never heard I want to review a few of these so we can see what it meant brother ham was talking about what how Jack Moore was kind of baffled he said by the the message he said especially on some of the things that we hold a dear and believed that it came to us through the opening of the seven seals as we believe such as the serpent seed the eternal security the believers and so forth some of those messages we don't think this is hard but if you've got he said you've got to open your heart to truth amen so when we open our hearts to truth we can receive doctrines that maybe seemed hard before so in order to receive the seals bro man said you have to open your heart to them he says again in God's power to transform but since the opening of those seven seals of them angels just behind the mountain yonder this has become a new book it's the thing that's been hid is being revealed as God promised in revelation 10 he would do it and we are the privileged people that God has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things I chose you God chose me to reveal these things that were hidden the book God chose us amen and indicate it with the cloud we know the praise God the you those seven angels praise the Lord but a man said and I was returned to return back here to Jeffersonville and preached the seven seals and if I've ever said anything that was inspired it was that there were the angel Lord Metis the Bible become a new Bible there it opened up and revealed all the things that the Reformers and things had left out it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ altogether new to us but perfectly exactly with the scripture that was the word which always was been I was so inspired and directed so the seals was the word that's always been here it's always the Reformers missed it this so that means all the other churches that have reformer messages like you know a Wesley's and Lutheran's and Catholics they're all they're all preaching sermons or messages that have holes in them I'm glad our message doesn't have any holes in it praise God we're not missing anything we're not lacking anything our message has the full gospel in it we're not lacking anything it's the restored word and it became a new Bible too brother Brett amen now here's the here's the court I was looking for a one time the Feast of the trumpets I think I read this one time because someone said brother Branham will them seven seals then that'll be revealing the last day some great mystery on how we get closer to God but man said no sir it can't be because whosoever shall take one word from the Bible and add one word to it his part will be taken from the book of life what it is is a revelation on what has been missed back there to bring - it's already wrote here it's in here the Bible it's to reveal what's already been written because you can't add one thing or you can't take one word from the Bible amen hallelujah then he says this he says this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the seven seals had the mysteries hit of what it all was and it's supposed to open it in the last day at the layers in church age at the end time thanks be to God that finishes the message to the church that finishes it when they look back and see what has been and see where it's all brought up that finishes it to the age of the church hallelujah so our message is finished when brother Branham finished preaching his message we know that brother a also said this he said about the seals he said I want you to check my revelation he says oh how I got a message I'll be going along and something strikes me and if I know it's God I'll take it over and find it in the scripture how do we know your message is from God it's found in the scripture program says then it's never failed but from Genesis to Revelation runs true no matter what people think about it it's been more so ever since those seven seals that did it that time he says so the seven seals open it and made more revelation more as time goes on and that's what I'm finding I'm fighting a Zyra study more and read more and I'm finding - as I write these books I'm kind of in the process of writing two books I'm fine as I meditate on these scriptures they just start opening more and more so that's her brother BAM fired he said Mauro so ever since he sees he's opening now I want to read another thing here too if I can by God's grace let me read this I have some more quotes I want to share here in the first seal brother Branham said I hope the people are spiritual are your spiritual tonight you're trying to turn you away from that tiredness and shake yourself maybe slap your arm a little bit and I know I got to slap my arm a little tired from work you know he says I would have had a horrible mistake on that first seal if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something I was writing down to say Amen don't you love that when the Holy Spirit sweeps into your life and you're about to make the wrong decision or about to say the wrong thing but then the Holy Spirit sweeps in and he changes the course ha ha ha amen God did that for brother Branham he said yes there's about 12 o'clock the Holy Spirit swept down the room and the whole thing just opened up to me there it was the first seal being open he said the same thing in the second seal he said I tell you today something happen again today the first thing you know something just happens all together it's different it just comes in different then I grab a pencil right quick and start writing just as fast Amala as I can while he's there amen so each time brother man preach the seals the Holy Spirit would sweep into the room and he'd see visions and you have to write it down while the angel the Lord is there he says it again in the third seal he said I want to see this each time even this morning I got up real early and just go to prayer before things there and just keep praying throughout the day this morning early the Holy Spirit came to where I was just as plain as anything and I seen this other seal open up just exactly and that beautiful now we get to hear this sermon open up but brother Branham got to see the sermon open up he saw the seals broken he saw the horses ride out and heard what the Holy Spirit called him he saw we didn't have the privilege to see it but we do have the privilege to hear it praise God thank God for that the RAM said in the third series said when it revealed to me early this morning before daylight then I went click quickly to the scripture and begin to look and search it up that's a real prophet amen that's that's that proves you and I are real Christians if God ever reveals anything to us we got to make sure it's found right in the holy pages of this Bible aim ahead in the fourth seal brother Barrow said I'm so happy I just thought this one wouldn't come but it finally did he thought it when is it gonna come when is he gonna come it finally came he says praise the Lord and he says when it goes to breaking forth like that I just pick up my pen and start riding and stay just there maybe for hours until it gets finished ours envisions before it gets finished now I got a setting on my phone I'm sorry my watch and it buzzes me every time I need to stand up every hour it won't let me sit hours but brother Branham didn't have that and he could sit there for hours and the Holy Spirit would just show him things and write down as he saw an hour after hour because he was an obedient prophet he was a faithful man of God he sat and waited upon the Lord and he heard what God said and he gave it out to you and I glory he say there for hours until the vision finished and then he said he said then I got my concordance and I go back and here it is right here and here it is over again here here it is down here and over there then I just hide together I know that's God as long as it's comparing Scripture with Scripture that's the way it has to do just like putting a building together the stones have to fit stone by stone sober man knew the visions were right when he could pile Scripture upon Scripture upon scripture upon Scripture that's how he knew they were right because they pointed back to the Word of God in the fifth seal brother Graham said I want to give thanks to him who's I'm the present that came today not knowing one thing about the fifth seal but came in that same mysterious way this morning just about an hour before they break that when I was out in prayer alright now the next one he says in the fifth seal and he said here's the revelation according to the revelation that the Lord Jesus gave me today this morning early now here's what he says in the fifth see who said them revelations listen in the presence of that ball of fire the picture of ball of fire but man said that morning he saw a ball of fire hanging there in the room oh brother I've seen it since a child but every time it comes near to me it alarms me he almost puts me in an unconscious condition you never get used to it you can't it's too sacred amen that's why the Christian can never get too tired of coming to church here amen because the Holy Spirit visits us you might not see the pillar of fire you might not see a ball of fire but when we feel that sacred presence and we know he's here we never get used to it it's always fresh it's always new and that's what we live for amen that's why we don't get bored coming to church or we don't get discouraged like well I wonder if I should go to church who was it that who was it that touch brother Aaron when we prayed for him last Wednesday that was the pillar of fire who was that healed us sister Tanya that was the pillar of fire who here in Jose's wife that was that same ball of fire amen and it's too sacred you don't get used to it that's why you keep getting drawn back to God's presence amen that doesn't get boring to me that just actually stimulates me amen I know it does you too you never get used to it it's so sacred the presence of God also the fifth seal brother have said I saw he said when he saw the fifth seal let me I read it here he said I seen Elijah walk out there for that first age by himself so brother Ham saw Elijah walk out for the Gentiles he was all alone and then when he saw the sixth seal he saw Moses and Elijah walk out that's how he knew Elijah came five times not for other because he saw the vision I see Elijah coming to finish the Gentiles and then I see Moses and Elijah stepping out to the 104 4,000 and how did he know that because God showed him God reveals his mysteries to his servants the prophets amen by vision now let me go to the sixth seal he says this he said this is my seventh day in a room without light just electric light setting and praying for God to open these seals he says something happened today when this seal was revealed - I had to walk out and completely out in the yard just walk around out in the yard a little while it just simply almost took my breath why right away from me so he had such a revelation the sixth seal he had to walk out members in Matthew chapter 24 remember that six seals are in Matthew chapter 24 we won't get to that tonight but maybe later it was so powerful he had to leave the room and walk out from the presence of God because it was so powerful just that he said just to feel human again my god help us but we have said of all the times I've been behind the pulpit at the tabernacle I've never never in any time in my ministry ever worked into the realms of God and the spiritual realms as it's been this time memory seen a hundred a hundred thousand people give their lives to Christ in durban remember that or is it three hundred thousand I don't know which one it was and he and the blind man received his sight all these things he'd seen all these things but he said I've never worked into the realm of Revelation in any service more than in the service of the seven seals it's beyond anything I ever did at any time of my ministry he says that any meaning at anywhere like this mostly out there it's on healing this is revealing of truth by the same spirit Amen Alleluia he said the human mind can only stand so much and when you get to a spot where you set an hour numbed with the presence of God and the pillar of light hanging there before you you can't say they're too long the human being can't stand it he says right so is everybody understand here this was now these services brother man preached on the seven seals were not average sermons these were not as regular healing campaigns where he just fasted on Friday a little lunch on Saturday you know preach on Sunday like he says it wasn't average like that it was every day God would sweep in the room and make him numb and he would sit there and try to write down and and he said when the angel would leave me write down he spent the rest of the day searching out concordance is to make sure everything that was preached was right in the Bible because brother Adam believed what Paul said Paul said though we or an angel anything different let him be cursed so brother that fruit man was a real prophet he said even if a danger comes I'm gonna make sure his word lines up with God's Word amen because my friend said God's absolute is his word amen that's God's absolute hallelujah now let's go to the first seal here let's start looking at the first seal I want to I want to review a few these here by God's grace we'll just see how far we can get tonight now also I want to pull this quote up brothers you remember when we were in Jeffersonville you remember that brother said that he listened to the mighty concur and he never heard brother random say that the White Horse rider was the Holy Ghost you remember when he said that it's okay if you didn't yes yes and that's where it was because I found it so anyways we were Jeffersonville and we were saying how there's some you know brother man I met brother Brian had further revelations but member they believe every word is thus saith the Lord so they they can't really deal with doctrines that change they can't deal with that because they believe every word as I say the Lord and God doesn't change so the one brothers I listen to brother and preach the mighty conquer and I never heard him call the White Horse writer the Holy Ghost now he's right it wasn't in mighty conquer it was in another sermon and that's what I forgot about and I didn't think to pull it up you know it just wasn't on my mind but I have those quotes and I want to make sure we go through those tonight by God's grace so you can see it so let me pull it up here real quick okay there's all right it was in the Patmos vision 1960 and the ten virgins and 144,000 look at you whether you like a computer you're like a message concordance so that means it's been written on your heart no kidding oh well that's a vindication there's another witness I just felt let allured to preach that today though I need I think I need to start digging back to the revelation series thank you I was in the closet praying this morning I thought I better go back I feel led to go back to the revelation amen so let's read that again revelation 6:1 and to the hos day I just feel like you were just tied together like for eternity or something you know weird all of us you know God put us all here we're all tied together Akron it's just it's all of us for eternity God had to serve together we're just all gonna be together amen revelation 6:1 and 2 now we read this for our text now you know the symbols but let's let's look at these again just to kind of refresh our minds I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now first of all in verse one notice who's opening the seal who over who opens a seal the lamb and this is the first revelation brother Branham gives the lamb is opening the book so picture the Lambs opening the book and then a white horse rider goes out the first revelation romance says is that white horse rider can't be Christ because Christ is opening the word and Christ is not two persons you can't have Christ ending there in a body and then another then he then he's riding a horse at the same time he's not - he's one amen glory I love that he said next the noise of a thunder so at every time a seal breaks a thunder thunder speaks that's why we believe the seven thunders are each individual revelation of the seven seals because here the first seals broken and then a thunder goes so every Co had a thunder behind it it was the voice of God amen that was going to tell the revelation of it and notice one of the four beasts say come and see chabela and said see that beast that beast is the lion beast right the lion beast comes forth and he declares what this is now the lion beast is the anointing for the true church brother Branham called it the Living Word or the Word made manifest in the holy spirit hallelujah now this white horse rider brother Branham says he said it's not the is he said it's not the early church brother BAM said this is the Antichrist spirit he said in deceptive innocence or deception it's false teaching it's false ministry and the horse represents a spiritual power now let me read you the quotes that brother was right it wasn't in mighty conquer brother Branham preached mighty Conqueror four times and every time he preached it this was his text but in all four serpents he never mentions this white horse rider in any of them cuz I looked I looked hard I typed in white I typed in horse I typed in writer I typed in all these things never one time run around using the text four times but he never even preaches on the white horse rider until December 4th 1964 other random reads about the White Horse in Revelation 19 I mean no there's a humming oh there's a white horse rider in Revelation 19 that is the real white horse rider this why or stridor is an imposter is Satan Superman brother Branham says but the real white horse rider is revelation 19 now brother random reads about a vesture dipped in blood when Jesus comes back riding a white horse brother Han reads that scripture and liquid he says what went out of his mouth the white horse rider and revelation he said seven I believe eight which was actually six he says and the why or she said no at six when the white horse rider went forth he was given a bow to conquer to conquer and a sword went out of his mouth what was he the white horse rider of Revelation notice the sword so brother man calls the horse rider program calls it the same right horse rider of Revelation 19 so in 1960 brother have said these two white horse riders are the same person amen and then seven days later when he preached the ten version the 144,000 brother Graham said then come the pale horse death and hell found it and each one of those riders are the horses now after these things after this great destruction now listen first went forth was the Holy Ghost across the earth conquering and to conquer so program literally says that the first horse rider was the Holy Ghost going forward to conquer and conquer and three years later he's going to preach that again and the Holy Spirit said that's not it he said that's not me it's the Antichrist amen you see the hatpin that powerful now what's striking is this this is how merciful God is brother Branham preaches in December of 1960 as part of the seven church sermons one month orbs are one month later when he preached revelation chapter four the Holy Ghost came down there in the back of the tabernacle and vindicated the seven churches and he even made the mistake how merciful see God was merciful because God knew he was going to correct him about three years later Amen God looked at the Bible said got a wink at your ignorance but once he shows it to you there's no more ignorance you've got to obey what he tells us amen that's why you know if you knew it was wrong to drink before the message or I'm sorry you didn't know is God a link at that but now that you know the difference God won't wink at that you have to repent amen hallelujah so those are the two quotes thank you brother Jose the Patmos vision and then the ten versions of 144,000 so brother random did he did teach that that the white horse rider was the holy ghost and God himself a ball of fire corrects you and if a ball of fire corrects you and it lines up with the word we better stay with that ball fire amen and the Word of God it's exactly right so brother and said this is the false teaching this white horse rider of course is the antichrist spirit Abraham said he was riding in his teaching ministry so we got to be real careful with teachers don't we gotta be careful what someone's teaching you about the Word of God like we preach last Wednesday night on doctrine doctrines good and it's necessary you can't get the Holy Ghost without doctrine but make sure that doctrine doesn't lead you outside the Word of God because that's how we see Satan moving today he's using teachers of the message to say well brother hams wrong programs wrong not a prophet not a prophet let's leave the message and when they do that they leave the but of Christ because the blood of Christ is upon this word today amen exactly right now here's the symbols who is he but RAM said it's the Antichrist spirit and he's killing my spirit he said a spiritual kill by giving them false doctrine when you wave if you receive a false doctrine it'll kill your spiritual life that's why I'm so glad to be alive and feel alive I don't feel dead in Christ I feel alive in Christ because we only believe true doctrine amen we don't add to the word we don't take away from the word we just believe the word what is the bow now brother him preach this but the Bible says the bow is a lie let's go to Jeremiah 9 3 and this ties in perfectly with what brother Branham preached so go to Jeremiah 9 3 Jeremiah 9 3 because Braham said he was spreading lies with its false doctrine jeremiah 9 3 oh you got it you're faster than me and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies but they're not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil to evil and they know not me saith the Lord what bow do they have their bow is their mouth and they shoot out lies amen and notice motives that he has a bow but no arrows he that means he's a bluffer he's pretentious that he's got thunder but no lightning but well then my brother said Christ has both thunder and lightning and weathers of that is that his throne in Revelation chapter four and five may remember lightnings and thunders proceed out of the road but this riders just got a bow and no arrows but Jesus Christ has a bow and arrows he's got a sword he's got lightning and thunder that's our mighty Conqueror amen glory oh my that's a powerful revelation hallelujah and then he says a crown was given unto him and brother have said this is a literal crowd that was given to the rider after he became incarnate in the Pope or the false prophet so that's what the crowd represents the crown that they gave to the literal Pope remember Church do you men were night a few about a month ago when we had church on Wednesday night at my house I read with what the Catholic Church has meant foes of doing in Pennsylvania I remember that the Pope never apologized he's still not apologized you already said no comment a thousand reports on priests molesting men and women and audre abortions and all this evil and the Pope says no comment that's because he's got an antichrist spirit how could anyone anywhere with natural affections would cry out against that but because he doesn't have natural affections because he and all their leadership have the wrong spirit they don't cry out against it they don't even remove these people from office it takes the government to remove them from office that's how evil it is and so it proves they're filled with all hateful and wicked things and no matter how glorious they may look to the the public no matter how beautiful the churches and how many people get married to them they're only full of demon powers amen it's exactly right I don't care what crime they wear I don't care what how beautiful their churches are this church is much more beautiful than theirs we might not have stained-glass windows but we're going to be walking on streets of glass just like gold amen how the hell we got the promise of that transparent glass hey man I don't want it here I want it there praise God amen and conquering but men have said what are they conquering he said they're conquering the land T that's why I appreciate your faith to come up for prayer that shows you're not being conquered when you got faith to receive prayers when you got faith to be healed or you got faith to receive a prayer that shows you're not being conquered you're led by the Holy Spirit the Spirit of God is leading me up to join another person's faith to pray together and remove those to bind the demon and cast out the demon to loose the person from the demon what is it it's everybody should have an anointing of the Holy Spirit that's exactly right amen now actually you know what I do have something to show here the Malachi Cain useless I didn't think I'd do this but maybe I'll do this I forgot this was from the old notes I had from a few years ago program talked about the Triple Crown and I forgot I did this this was on a website a Catholic website and I just went and I looked at the lira the letters these are all the letters that our own programs brother Brad said he saw this the Triple Crown I don't know if it was the same one but this is certainly a Triple Crown and it has all these titles on it well I went and studied that out I did the I did the translation and I got it from there they did the translation the complete inscription on this crown is is this it means to the infallible of Jesus Christ to the Supreme Governor of the world on earth to the father of Nations and kings it has the Pope's crown my that's just a bunch of nonsense I just a bunch of Lies those are the words look at those words they're the words you can look them up on Google Translate if you want I use that all the times I have a girl my class who speaks she's from Colombia I always say the wrong country s I got to speak to her in Spanish I use hey Siri how do you say raise your hand in Spanish oh there goes there goes sorry didn't mean that Siri [Laughter] they're always listening aren't they but the point is this is what they call their leader and he won't speak out against molestation I wonder how many people he's molested I don't know or how many of his friends he's molested I don't know but when they do this they blaspheme the name of Jesus Christ that's right giving infallibility to a man who's Supreme Governor of the earth only Christ is the king of the earth amen they're stealing the the titles for God which is blasphemy they blast him in his name that's right I think I'll just preach off these I I pulled these up okay that's the first sales everybody okay with the first seal I think I'll probably to the first four seals tonight this is an old I found this old PowerPoint from you know eight years ago I thought well let me rehearse it I'll just go fast with the church because most y'all didn't see this I think only my wife saw this yeah I think I think my only my wife saw this in 2010 maybe Lydia if she remembers there has been a long time ago you know remember oh sure you do now the second seal second seal revelation 6 and when you open the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see so second the first one was the the line second one is the calf or the Ox we'd say and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there she was given unto him a great sword all right let me make sure I got everything I want to say about that okay I do so the Ox like beasts from Revelation 4 7 is the anointing for the true Christians he's a beast of sacrifice and gave their lives just as freely as they could give them in that age the red represents a bloody red program said quote they're waiting they were waiting through the blood of everybody that disagrees with them and of course the horse is a spiritual power my power was given to him to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another but RAM said this is the unity of church and the state grants power eventually leads to the Crusades and other Wars the RAM said the great sword representing the murdering of 68 million plus Protestants by the Roman Catholic Church from the time of Saint Agustin of hippo until 1586 kills by sword political power when church and state United now I read I haven't heard this with the Pennsylvania the cases they have at least a one death from all this abuse one of the boys was so badly abused by a man who would rape him a free so to rape him he would take pills for pain and he overdosed and died in his 20s because of the evil pains of that church and that was just an accidental death what about the purposeful ones the abortions that they admitted to they've admitted to having abortions because they've impregnated girls and all these things all these women have come forth all these abortions what comes out of this church death what comes out of the bride of Jesus Christ's life amen hallelujah I know it's off I know it's sad I know it's hard to say some those things but we have to call it like it is this is truth this is where God's Word is being preached and thank God that our eyes are open to see what's been left out all these years amen thank you lord Wow Ardi to the third one yeah okay third one let me read it when he opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts saying a treasure I'm sorry measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the line program said the third the Beast is a man-like beast the anointing for true Christians he said the wisdom of a man which was a power that went forth in the reformers the black represents the dark ages four was the time of midnight to the true believers that was left and the horse again is spiritual power how many premiere with that one by God's grace the pair of balances brother have said is when he saw Satan through the Catholic Church was capturing the wealth of the world and stripping his subjects of their money a voice in the midst of the beast it was the voice of Christ the lamb now back to this program said he walked through the Vatican remember brother said he went for an interview with the Pope and the man that was before that he said now you have to do a few things he said you're gonna have to call him father and brother banister that's fine I'll call any man Reverend I'm sorry not father Reverend I'll comb all these things he said then you got to bow down and kiss his ring he said that's out he said because all worship goes to my Savior Jesus Christ saying that he's not called man doctor I'll call him Reverend but all worship goes to Jesus Christ amen and there's pictures you can see on the internet just type in Pope being kissed kissing a ring and you'll see people bowing down and kiss him I never found Obama but I wanted to I always want to find a George W Bush you're a Donald Trump kissing his ring but I never did yet if you find one let me know I've got to make sure it's not photoshopped though because they usually like to photoshop them but never set a voice in the midst of the Beast and motives and this voice that cries out do not hurt the oil and the wine amen this brother said this is Christ saying and he says like this he says don't you make them do any novenas no don't make you don't make then do the many indulgences he said don't touch their spiritual faith he said don't don't let anyone touch their own wine in other words the devil can't touch the Holy Ghost if you've got it amen the devil can't make you fall away the devil can't make you lose your salvation because the Holy Ghost is the seal unto the day of the rapture amen he can't touch your oil he can't touch your wine see now we got to make sure the wine doesn't get touched because sometimes we lose our inspiration sometimes we lose our excitement about the word and the church said we got to make sure to Satan you can't touch my wife I'm gonna go to church and I'm gonna get stimulated by the revelation ain't n and if you feel like that you got to tell that to the devil you get off me get away from me I bind you get off me I bind you too and you must leave I want my wine back aim ahead because he cannot touch the oil and the wine exactly right now program said a measure wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny Christ recognizes the rider charging for the natural staff of life brother Branham says and indulgences which is false spiritual hope all right now bro Graham said he went to the Vatican and he said after that interview he turned it down he said he went walking through the Vatican he said you couldn't buy that with a hundred million million dollars and I looked it up on the encyclopedia and it says that it says the Vatican's artworks are priceless you can value how prices there and I look at how Satan calls it the Eternal City and he makes it priceless in the natural what a perversion he's just trying to copy our home the New Jerusalem because our home is eternal amen you know it doesn't matter whether the devil calls it that or not it is eternal praise God and now and our home doesn't have earthly treasures it has spiritual treasures ha ha it has spiritual riches spiritual rewards that will never fade away of in the rural value and the most valuable is Jesus Christ himself amen hallelujah so see it's a perversion Satan perverting the New Jerusalem see by imitating it but in those days the Catholic Church had control I'm sorry the Kevin he's a good man that's Martin Luther the Catholic Church had control of the economy and also had controlled the government and so they could they could charge for food their control of everything because they own government church and state right the two horns ecclesiastical and civil civil civil powers they control both so they captured the wealth of the world the artwork they went on Crusades they captured all the wealth and all the money they killed anyone that argued against them and see thou hurt not the oil line Christ protects the oil the Holy Spirit and wine the stimulation of Revelation of the true believer amen all right now we're up to our day the fourth seal let me read it to you this is a little bit longer one here and when you open the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast saying come and see and I looked at me holding a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth you can see that the Eagle like beasts is the anointing for us it's the revelation it's program says the promise in Revelation 10 7 praise God so the fact that we know the mysteries if we know the mysteries that live by the mysteries it's a proof we've got the eagle anointing amen the pail but as I said pail is red and white and so mixed together the three-in-one and he calls that the eternal separation from God so when someone is anointed with this pale horse riders spirit they're eternally separated from God because they're dead they've crossed the line between mercy and judgment and huh me know in that sermon huh me know in that sermon brother Branham said the Pentecostal church dead he said thus saith the Lord that's striking when he says a whole denomination a whole movement is dead thus saith the Lord it's true it struck the church and you can see it right you can see it on their church service if your friends go the Pentecostal Church you can see in their lives they're dead they're not on fire for the word of God it's not about the word anymore it's about tongue speaking or it's about prosperity or it's about a new building or something like that it's not about truly Christ the word all eyes should be about Christ the word we need more of the word god guide me in your word guide me in your path help me to be more like Jesus Christ not somebody's idea about Christ but Christ amen his name that sat on him was death program this is a quote god only knows how many he calls to spiritually die by his anti Bible teaching this is the one he put sixty-eight million of the sword and killed and probably billions died spiritually on his false teaching no wonder he takes the name death now do I have the quote here let me go back to this one here death brother Brahim said this this writer is the same writer the whole time but in the first three rise no one knew his name to the last ride and then in the last ride an eagle flew up really high a fly you could look down and say I know who this is he's rode the whole time that's death amen so see in the end time it took the Eagle anointing to identify what is this spirit in that in the organizations and programs said it was death did you know brother have said it was actually the preaching of the seven seals that showed him how evil organization was those quotes before the seals remoter have said it's okay if you're in an organization you should be in an organization and there's quotes after the seals where he balls it out you get out of organization don't put your name on their book their book won't get you to heaven your name must be on the Lamb's Book of Life because there's only lambs in the Lamb's Book of Life that means you and I are am say Mary is this the Lamb's Book of Life and only Lambs names in there hi there yeah thank you Jesus I want to be a Lamb of God so he could only get the you could only identify who is that Rider you could only know his name in this last age when the Eagles flying thank you Jesus and hell followed death Legrand said now he'll always follows death in the natural when unnatural man dies hell follows him that's the grave Hades that's the natural when the spiritual it's a lake of fire and the church said he'll always follows death all right and power was given unto him over over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth well Adam said this is the last ride of the incarnate devil in the person of the Antichrist which fulfills those scriptures revelation 13 about the mark of the beast and Revelation 16 but Ram said he's gathering his subjects to Armageddon in that interesting death is going to gather all the world unto Armageddon death is death is gathering all them to a place where they can all be gathered and then Jesus will come back after our wedding supper praise God he'll come back and they're all gathers sword can go out of his mouth and devour all of them death gathers them together see they're uniting they're uniting with governments they're uniting with the Vatican they're uniting with with sin but we're uniting with Jesus Christ were uniting with the Word of God were uniting with all message believers amen who really believe the message amen we're uniting with life they're uniting with death he's gathering his subjects for Armageddon I see Christ gathers us for Armageddon I don't know how to ride a horse right now but God's gonna give me that ability if I'm a real message believer I'll have that ability of when I get a new body I don't know right now but I'm promised if I've got the Holy Ghost I'll be riding a white horse amen somewhere at the back way at the back behind Jesus Christ I'll be waiting the back is on the lease of the Serpent's amen as long as I'm there I'll just be happy as a happy give me I just want to be there Church you just want to be there with Jesus amen now I think it's where I stopped the rest these are my new by memory so you can um you can unplug there because I think that's where I stopped on that one the rest is because I wrote it out right here here I'll take a few more minutes let me set a timer here I really got to watch my voice because that's been as I've been really tired three sermons and three days was really hard on me yeah the priest so loud and so hard help me Jesus let's look at the fifth seal here alright let me look at my notes here I wrote these down before service okay yeah the fifth seal was a great revelation of brother Branham he said because all these other teachers were teaching that souls go to sleep when they die I mean oh we're talking about some people like the Mormons they they believe when someone dies their soul actually sleeps and it has no contact with anyone else but that's a lie that's not true souls never sleep praise the Lord your body goes down and your body rut you know deteriorates and breaks down your body deteriorates but your soul if you're born again it'll never die my soul can't die because the giver of life is inside myself he quickened my he made my soul alive so it cannot die I always be alive amen hallelujah because Christ is in me the hope of glory amen remember remember jesus said you do err Pharisees not knowing the scriptures God is not the god of the dead God is the god of the living ain't ahead the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob our God is the god of the living a hallelujah now the fifth seal it's a longer one two and when he opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony that held well Ram said who are these people but remember these this is not the early church martyrs but man said this is the martyred Jews and the way you know is because their slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held they're not slain for the testimony of Jesus Christ because they don't have that testimony this says Jews the fifth seal is Jews now if you hold your spot revelation 1 says this that's what I love about the seals program taught us that through the seals of the church ages the Bible interprets itself we don't need another book a book of Mormon or we don't need any other book to interpret the Bible the Bible has got enough information it interprets itself praise God amen now in Revelation 1:9 John says I was in the isle that's called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ how many are both testimonies I do I've got the testimony of the Word of God how many believe the Old Testament I believe the Word of God but I also have the testimony of Jesus Christ that the Messiah that they spoke up for those four thousand years they kept speaking of it me bruise the Serpent's head and and all need be born in Bethlehem and all these things ah we believe he's come and his name is Jesus Christ amen he's alive tonight hallelujah amen and that's that fish seal is there only slain for the word of God's sake not for the name of Jesus Christ but the word of God only verse 10 and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true thus thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now brother man said this proves they're Jews because they're asking for vengeance they're asking for vengeance honey I've been reading Psalms I think I'm in Psalms 30 and David's crying out for vengeance all the time he's like God to kill my enemies put my enemies under my feet right he's a man who's not all the way born with the Holy Ghost right he's got the Holy Ghost on his body he's got the Holy Ghost in his mind but he's not quite born-again because he's asking for revenge you not to ask for revenge we're so say God you have revenge in your time we're supposed to ask for mercy upon our enemies amen now last Wednesday I preached out there there may times there may be times you're led of the Holy Spirit and you speak judgment on someone like Paul said Paul Cedric Paul said reward Alexander the coppersmith for the evil he did unto me and then two verses later he says have mercy on those that hurt him and left that forsook me so there may be times you speak the Word of God and anointed to speak judgment but generally for a Christian we speak mercy we speak forgiveness father they don't know what they're doing Lord lay it not to their charge amen remember Paul was so filled with the Holy Ghost he said I wish that I was a curse that my brethren could be saved now that's real Christianity right there or what I was Jesse Smith would be curse and go to hell just so that my friends could be saved that's that's real Christianity right there of course God won't let that happen but this proves that this is the Jew now this also proves we preach on this a few years ago brother Branham said at one place you're your human spirit breaks up when you die but this proves it actually doesn't now you could say this your spirit gets renewed when you die say that but it can't break up because look they have their same human spirit they still remember that somebody killed me wrong they didn't forget that they remember that someone killed us the wrong way and we want vengeance so they've got the wrong attitude and they still got their memories from their human spirit their human spirit did not break up when they died right and it's also proven by the rich man who died and went to hell right and he said Abraham said send Lazarus so he can go and witness the my six brothers or was it five his five brothers yeah go send to my five brothers because if someone raises from the dead they'll believe what Abraham say yeah you got the wrong thought there buddy you've got the wrong thought if they don't believe the literal preaching of Moses they're not going to believe that somebody rise from the dead if you don't believe the power of the written word you're not going to believe the word made manifest amen that's why we got to love the word met the word itself but also the power behind it we need both but we got to believe this word amen that's the trouble with the workers of iniquity they love the anointing but they don't love the written word and the church said they cast out devils that healed the sick they did all these things but they were workers of sin because they didn't love the written word of God but we love both same heme will wear spring tonight not just in spirit oh thank God somebody got here let's see if somebody gets here together let's pump you up let's get everybody jumping let's get everybody shouting that might be good we want the spirit but we want the truth as well tell me how to live my life give me instructions give me doctrine what does the Bible say what does it say about my life tell me what God said because I fear God and I want to keep his commands hey man so true we must have both and this is what they were lacking their spirits did not break up they had the same human spirit we need vengeance gimmie vengeance on those like Bob Arum said the high command group you know give me vengeance on the Germans give me vengeance on all these people that Russia the ones that may have killed us give us vengeance and look how merciful God is when he answers that's the look at verse verse 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so God gives any Jew who keeps all the Old Testament God gives a faithful Jew a white robe as long as he has a faithful testimony all how God loves a heart of integrity how God loves a pure heart amen that's why some friends if they've got a pure heart they got a good chance of getting a white robe because God loves someone that will live what they say they will amen if it's holy if it's righteous if it's good even though they're blind they had a testimony we love the Word of God we believe in righteousness we believe in holiness we know God's real though they didn't know it it's further revelation but because they live true to their testimony and their faith of the Old Testament God's that I'm giving you a white robe and church and even though their lives they rejected the blood of Jesus Christ during their lives but because they're blinded God gives them a white robe I notice it's nothing different than your robe is that right what do you get you get a red robe you get a blue robe you get a white robe we all get white robes because we all need the blood of Jesus Christ amen now we'll get different rewards right we get to be the bride they get to be the bride chamber keeper right but because we're the bride because we're called this we were called to believe this message remember he said in the beginning we were called blessed are your eyes for they see Amen all the prophets have longed to see what these seals meant they belong to know what the book of Revelation was but you and I know it Amen blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears for they hear hallelujah mm-hmm said they should rest for a little season program said that's the tribulation they got a rest for a little season a little tribulation season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled amen now brother Graham said I hope this answers and solves your question on Soul sleeping souls do not go to sleep these souls are alive and well and they're so alive and well that they're crying out to Jesus there under the altar and they're crying to Jesus and Jesus talks back that's how alive they are and that's why brother Branham at the end of this he tells the story of going beyond the curtain of time right his body lays there but he sees it going away you see so he must mean us theophany going away his bodies there and he goes up and he's taking on a high place right he's exalted above the people I'm sorry first he goes down to the ground and he's get screened at all these things and he said it was just he said he said he was hugging women but all the sex glands was gone because there could be no temptation there God took that all out he said it was so beautiful he said it was beyond sublime he said was sublime time sublime is beyond sublime he said you he said you can't you can't explain how perfect it was he said everybody looked like they're 20 years old glory and they're saying my precious brother my precious brother if you had not gone I wouldn't have been here that's what I want to say that's what I want to know I don't know people come up to me and say if you do not preach I would not have been here but then humble look at somebody said I would have been here if you did not preach well I'll have somebody that pointed us because that's how God works he flows through the body God saves man through man amen oh I trust on that day sister Connie that Tonya will look at you and say I'm here because you're here because of you because you had a garage sale amen hallelujah I hope we can all point each one and different ones that point us to Christ we can all point and say I'm here because of you amen and that'll be that'll be enough reward for me let like the real reward ledges let me sit at Jesus feet for 10,000 years that's all the reward I want but I hope people come and say because you preach the gospel that's why I'm here amen and that's how I end the fifth seal by going beyond the curtain of time and he says those those souls are alive and I remember when he was going back he was telling the angel or the voice I don't want to go back can I just stay well then it says but the gospel had to be preached oh my what would what would move God's heart to keep a servant of God who wanted to be with this wife one to be with his daughter to share rose what would moves God's heart to give him what he really wanted what would move God's heart would be souls that needed to hear the preaching of the gospel amen souls that weren't yet born again or saved or filled with the Holy Ghost that's what--when move God's heart to make sure he brought the proper come back here but I know you're enjoying it but come back here you need to preach God's Word because the preaching of the word is power and the salvation to all those who believe amen has been powerful to you oh yes it has that's why I love the message let's stand to our feet so I love the message because when I was in an organization it only had a little bit of power it only had power for me to get rid of a few things of my life but I could never get rid of all of them I still smoked I still chewed I still listen to bad music even though I still watch evil movies and all these prompts I still constant all these things but once I came and got baptized in Jesus Christ I never cussed one time after that ha ha ha I never went back to those things after coming this because this message has power to truly set a man or woman free and now that we're born again Saint tries accuse it tries accused as he tries to discourage us but we always remember that Jesus said that he can't touch the oil and the wine in our lives ha ha ha saying can't touch the Holy Ghost inside of me he can't take the Holy Ghost from me amen so no matter how hard he tries to tempt me and beat me down when it all comes to the very depths of my soul my soul will always go back and say no devil I'm staying with the word amen amen because he cannot touch that Holy Ghost seal amen how did he God put it there and it seemed to the day of redemption and it never be removed I'm seeing it for eternity praise God hallelujah and he can't take my stimulation Wednesday night he can't take a happiness he can't take our joy because Christ gave it to us amen hallelujah he can't take that from us we just got to make sure we don't give it to him remember the Bible never said you're sealed with wine you're seeing with the oil to the day of redemption and we know a lot of people that may have only ghosts but they sure lost their wine and they're just grumpy Christians now whiny yeah exactly yeah whiny you're right that's a good one I never heard that one before just whine and complain about this complain about why is the pastor that why is the Deacons do that why is this only to do that why they do that they complain about everything instead of realizing how thankful they should be just for life just for this message how thankful they should be for the power and had to change their lives amen thank the Lord what a blessing we have Church with these first five seals up I'll probably preach the six separate next week and maybe we just we'll just do two parts on the seals is that okay by God's grace then we'll get to the real new stuff seven eight and all the way through oh that's real new to me by the grace of God how many love the Lord and I've always said this I'm gonna say it again I hope it you don't get tired of it the main thing with the seals the main revelation is sin we cannot let that Antichrist spirit right into our lives because he's only gonna get more powerful he comes in as a little doctrine and then he starts kit blobs are black represents them so red represents killing and that's how it works today you see people the message when they get an evil spirit they start killing people killing their testimonies bad-mouthing this person bad-mouthing that person and then they try to go to the black they try to build their own Kingdom and then they die spiritually and they really will never stay with the word we've all seen people do that especially preachers that have the wrong Antichrist spirit because remember Jesus said this he said sin is like a little mustard grain seed it grows up into a great tree and all the fowls are the unclean spirits Lodge on it that's what Jesus said so we can never let sin get into our lives we can never become a good sinner we've got to become an awful sinner we've got to feel so so bad we always be a sinner saved by grace I sit but I'm saying I'm forgiven by the grace of God amen I just read a quote today we wrote brother ham said never make yourself feel so secure that you feel like you would never fall away in other words be humble never get so exhausted like all Satan will never touch me you watch that you can go pretty low brother Brian had some real hard trials he laid in a bed for nine days one time almost died he had those amoebas right because he disobeyed the Lord almost died let's never get exalted let's be thankful we got that eternal spirit that Satan can't touch it but let's be vigilant let's watch and look for that roaring lion he's roaring like a lion but he's not a lion we've got the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah hallelujah we've got the Holy Ghost we got Jesus we've got the Holy Ghost
