remember brother jose i got to visit him this morning and he said the last 36 hours have been awful he said he felt like his heart has been squeezed from both sides he could hardly breathe but he said before right before i got there he said his heart started feeling a lot better and then by the time i left he said he had no more pain so thank you for your prayers and we thank the lord jesus for his grace but he said i'll probably be in there one more day if everything goes smooth like it's going right now probably they'll keep them for one more day the doctor said he had a heart attack so um they say if if you have another likely it's within 24 to 48 hours so that's why he's got to stay there one more day and so then i just oh brother uh i probably well i'll see you tomorrow but you might be home tomorrow as well so hopefully hopefully he's home tomorrow by the grace of the lord you're always welcome to see them now they're only taking two time back there so if you go you can only only two people go go at a time you gotta wear a mask you know just take it off while i'm in there you know uh but he's doing a lot better by god's grace oh yeah do you want to tell me he loves everybody and he thanks you for your prayers he said make sure you tell the church he loves everybody and he thanks you for your prayers his sister though jolene he said has blood pressure so he said well you

sermon here today about the help of the lord proverbs 31 verse 28. [Music] i just want to title this message a woman that feareth the lord shall be praised i just want to just speak on this simple thought here today by the grace of god proverbs 31 verse 28. there's 31 28. if you're there say amen i'll read 28-29 then we can read 30 together her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all let's read verse 30 together one two three favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised amen let's have a word of prayers with our heads on your heart let's just make a known unto god surely god is in this place hallelujah healing jose as we speak by the grace of the lord amen he's a god who's brought us through all these years all these tests all these trials he's the ever-present god he promised i'll never leave you nor forsake you so heavenly father we just thank you for today what a beautiful day again we thank you for this reading of your word i bring you quicken these thoughts to us lord god and i just pray lord the holy spirit will speak lord as as lord as as you desire lord god let your spirit speak lord help me to not to quench anything lord god help me not to hinder anything may you speak in your love and your grace and your mercy and your uh your spirit lord god with your power with your authority father god for lord this is your your desire this is how you would keep your people encouraged this is just as you would save them through preaching god you would also strengthen them and keep them through the preaching so this is your design lord this is your this is your mind this is your plan so god we just want to fit in your plan today help each person to choose the perfect will of god we thank you for our mothers and we call them blessed today hallelujah we praise them or we commend them or we celebrate we honor them today and we lord we give you thanks in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise the lord we're thankful again for the grace of god and uh trying to get just a little picture here trying to get a picture of my mom up here okay so i like to look at this thought a woman that fears the lord shall be praised we'll just take uh i might preach a whole two hours today we'll see you know what kind of scene that does because i'm joking but you know i'll try to try to watch the time but at the same time you know we'll see what the lord would like us to feel the inspiration on i shared uh those who weren't here on wednesday night i just shared two great prayers god answered this week it was just really phenomenal for me to see that after four or five years you know we've been praying for the supreme court to overturn roe v wade and it looks like they're going that direction so we're very thankful for that and what a week for that leak to come out i know the enemy meant to do harm with that leak but actually what an encouragement with mother's day coming up praise god you know god always uh reverses satan's plans right say he thinks he's got a head on him or something like that but it's just a great victory it's a it's a it's a sign letting us know we're going in the right direction so i was talking with van yesterday out there i don't know today yet but i was just saying you know those two vindications let me know god is with me and i'm going the right direction because these weren't prayers that were answered the next day these were prayers that were answered years years down the road praise god amen so we're thankful for that let's just keep praying that god will rid this red different parts of this nation no doubt you know if it goes back to the states no doubt uh maybe half the states will have abortions too but also but think about if half the state stop it what a blessing god's face would shine upon those those areas praise god and so that's what we're praying for and i was thinking today if god would have spared sodom for ten righteous souls what is he gonna spare us for praise the lord that's why the bible says there's got to be a time right before the rapture when no more people want the holy ghost but all those that want it they'll receive it by the grace of god hallelujah look we got one two three four five six ninety nine we have way more than ten here today by god's grace i love jesus christ i want to serve him and uh it's just an encouragement church that god hears our prayers the other one by the amen was a few it would have been let's see this is the fifth month fifth sixth sentence so seven months ago i sent a letter to a man who preached at cam's church showing him 24 false doctrines that he taught well i talked to kim two nights ago i talked to cam we had to talk about an hour and a half maybe hour fifteen and uh cam said that brother cameron was going to be nice and give one more time to maybe repent make things right well he came and i guess he doubled down on his thoughts and uh cam said his whole sermon was to prove me wrong uh that i was wrong you know i never i i wrote it with love i mean i wrote the letter of love i don't know why but uh i think it's just that the spirit of pride doesn't like to be corrected it doesn't like to be called out when someone has a demon no matter what the level of possession it is that demon does not like to be called out so the brother preached it brother cans recently and said to vindicate that my doctrine is right god's going to raise up brother mike mccloskey out of his wheelchair in this service well god didn't do it they prayed they were they had a six and a half hour service can you imagine that i think i've been in five hour services i don't think i've ever been in six and a half in other words they kept trying to pray when it happen and the brother ultimately tried to put it on other people and mike himself but mike i talked to him on the phone mike's like oh no i know jesus loves me i know if god wants to heal it's going to be god and so i said thank god that you didn't take that evil spirit trying to condemn you because he's so solid he said i have love for the brother i forgive the brother now that's real christianity so anyways the point was that god vindicated that my desire to correct people and ultimately i told like him to to to protect your church from false doctrine i said ultimately because god had me help start that church and we started it with a day of prayer and fasting and everything and i said just as a vindication that my desire was right plus the hours and hours i put weeks i put into studying that out it's an 18 page letter single spaced that's a lot of that's a lot of typing that's a lot of a lot of writing uh god gave me vindication that i'm on the right road to praise god i'm wanting to correct branham tabernacle wanting to correct believe the sign wanting to correct preachers that preach false doctrine that's the spirit of love love brings correction amen love it brings corrections those are great two great testimonials so one took seven months brother the other one took about four or five years so either way we're rejoicing in god's place amen i'm thankful for god's mercy and his love and so i kind of say it like gideon these are signs that i'm on the right road getting needed all these signs do the perfect will of god to me these are signs letting me know i'm on the right path amen i have not strayed from the path i have not left the faith but i've kept the faith like paul said that's what we all want to say lord i've kept the faith amen so i just thought i'd share a few moments on that by god's grace um so yeah let's look here to the lord here as we preach a little bit hear about the grace of god and again great that brother nia here god bless you man hallelujah sure love you buddy god bless you so let's look at a woman that feared the lord shall be praised we just want to preach on motherhood you know this word in the hebrew praised actually means to commend which means compliment or celebrate which means honor so the bible says a woman that fears the lord shall be honored she shall be complimented and of course the text the whole context of this shows who's going to honor her and who's going to bless her it's going to be her husband and her children praise god hallelujah and so of course you know we'd also know like a grandchildren right grandchildren as well and of course all the saints you know all the saints in the congregation would feel uh the love of a godly woman praise god hallelujah and because that that sister is a as a like jesus said she's a city on a hill that cannot be hidden now especially the way you dress this is we're going to get to that just a minute just encourage you and really appreciate you for that especially nowadays when all these women uh wear these uh what they call them exercise pants where they call yoga pants right it's really close to a state of undress i don't forgot we've got our different ideas on that but um to think about how a woman would put herself out like that and even grandmothers do that and uh they put themselves out in such an ungodly way to think that you as sisters here led by the holy spirit would cover up your your body and would would force people to acknowledge wow there is such a thing as holiness wow there is such a thing as humility there is such a thing as real beauty amen then god is making you a city on a hill that cannot be hidden praise god amen and you know those women and those men are convicted when our sisters walk out there you know they're convicted because they're they're all without excuse there will be no excuse on the day of judgment i didn't know about modesty i didn't know about that any red red blood and blooded man won't be able to witness i knew about it because i felt it right i felt the temptation i felt the test in the and the trials but by the grace of god we were able to overcome and we thank god for our sisters making uh this great sacrifice to be such a testimony for jesus christ today and they deserve compliments they deserve honor the bible said so children make sure you go home and honor your mother and your grandmother i'm looking at where's all that i'm giving them the big eyes we'll make sure we'll do that today by the grace of god make sure you're honored that brother ram did that over and over again uh he said mother is so great and we'll read those quotes later on in today but but so this word praise means doesn't mean to worship but it doesn't mean to honor and compliment them and thank them for what they have done for you praise god now i just want to start again this this woman of course remembers she had the fear of the lord and she had this because she honored god and she honored her husband remember there was two there was two aspects of this fear of the lord and any godly woman today will do the same she'll fear god and she'll respect it and treat her husband good all the days of our life amen if she can choose those things to fear god respect god to honor god to listen to god and she can also love her husband every day and honor him then the bible says she will be praised amen that's her desire remember the man he'll be praised too right if he leads well praise god if he loves his wife as christ loved the church amen hallelujah and he doesn't bring his children unto wrath praise god so he's a he's a loving father but he's also corrective as well but the bible says if they do that they fear the lord they shall be prayed in other words they'll have a great reward in heaven amen now let's just review these some of these are just so beautiful the fear of the lord is to hate evil so a mother that fears god it saddens and grieves her when your children sin right same thing for father if a father fears the lord it grieves him to see his children sin but austin shared a good song with me this week uh what was it called brother how about take the lead take the lead yeah it's a beautiful song if you want to hear it now we can send you a link to it's a nice deal it's on youtube i just thought of that right now it's a beautiful song and the song basically says who will teach the children who will teach them right and wrong it's us the schools aren't going to do it i know because i work in them you know if you've gone to them they'll say you know now it's all positive like you can't say the word not like you should not run out of the hole you got to be positive and said you must walk down the hallway like that's going to make any difference they're six years old they got all this energy it just has uh two cartons of sugary chocolate milk in it how are they gonna run down the hallway i'm sorry how are they gonna walk down the hallway if you're positive they'll walk not always but see the since they kicked out prayers since they kicked out the bible they're left with this they're just they're grabbing for straws anything these are just vain efforts the fear of god is what's going to do it praise god of course that's mixed with the love of god he says sometimes you're strict sometimes you're loving sometimes you're merciful there's a balance and god gives us the wisdom to know which is which but a godly mother hates when her children do evil and i'll say this she hates when she herself does evil like we all do obviously we should hate the garment even spotted with the flesh the bible says in the book of jude that's new testament we should hate our sins so this is so when we say i fear the lord we should hate our sins we should hate our mistakes right and a mother that fears the lord will do that of course we can't force and say tell our children oh you'll never do that again you'll never lie to me again i'm going to put you in the [Music] but we have to understand that we do our part and if we do our part god will do his part proverbs 16 verse 6 by mercy and truth iniquity is purge so we have to show mercy on the children and we're to speak the truth to them in love and by the fear of the lord men depart evil so why do people keep sinning it's because they don't fear god enough they don't fear hell enough they don't fear scandal enough like these preachers that fall they don't fear scandal enough they don't fear uh criticism enough they they they they don't fear guilt enough we should fear sinful things we should have respect for them i'm not going to walk that way i'm going to stay as far away from that as i possibly can amen that's the fear of the lord i'm going to depart from the evil that i've done or thought to do ready praise god and so that's what a mother does a mother helps her children depart from evil and then the bible says once you got that once you got that once you got that now you've got a little bit of wisdom amen because the fear of the lord is what the beginning of wisdom amen that shows how it shows up why we have so many foolish virgin amen right in the churches even message because once they compromise on sin cutting hair makeup sport watching sports smoking drinking all these things wearing shorts once they once they compromise on these things it proves they don't have any wish they can't even get to wisdom because they don't fear god enough to even get the beginning stages of wisdom amen i can't even say it right but i hope the holy spirit relates to you what i'm trying to say amen that's coming fresh here by god's grace the fear of god makes you leave evil the reason we continue sinning or something we're doing wrong is because we don't fear god enough we think god is just going to wink at our sin and right and cuddle us along like a little baby right no he wants it while we are while we are god's children he wants us to grow up into maturity right that's what the stature of a perfect madness what's worse statute it means maturity the maturity of a perfect son or daughter of god amen we're growing and becoming more mature right our discernment should grow so we can exercise discernment between good and evil that's why i talk about the camera so this trial comes to your church god allowed it and i said brother it's a it ends up being a blessing because it lets me know i was discerning the spirit the right way praise god remember this bride she's an invincible army because she can discern between the two spirits and the framework of the church amen in other words we can identify which spirit is leading us which spirit is guiding us which spirit is fighting against us and when we can discern those then we can withstand satan by the love of god amen hallelujah amen that's why trials are just gifts of grace trials look like gifts of grace when i look to jesus thank god amen it's just god's gift to show me where i'm wrong and to help me grow to be more right i don't know because god knows we want to be right amen amen right with god now you have this idea in the new testament too let love be without dissimulation or favoritism right or division okay so we should love all no matter their age or or or gender or or nationality with all sincerity let love be without any of that uh discrimination amen we should just give love freely praise god in the church said amen hate that which is evil cleave to that which is good amen mothers teach us how to do this i still remember the first time i saw mtv was when the spirit of lust came on me and i was in second or third grade i can't remember i wrote about in chapter one in my modesty book i had never before seen mtv i spent the night at my friend his name was seth i spent spent the night at seth's house and we stayed up and i still remember i was i was in second or third grade i still remember seeing those women on that tv they had a tv in their kitchen just a small little tv i still remember seeing women half naked singing and dressing like that and from that moment on i was hooked i was only in second or third grade a brother shared with me this week when the first time he saw pornographic magazines in kindergarten kindergarten i was in second or third what about today were these kids with cell phones and ipads yeah they're probably seen at preschool right and and seen it so early and still is and we can still remember that very moment when that evil spirit come upon us right we can still remember that and so if that and i still remember you know battling that free oh yeah i remember my mom that's why i'm trying to get to my mouth okay so right after watching the mtv i went home and my favorite thing of all was baseball cards right and that's all i loved was baseball cards football cards well one night and i put in the book there my whole family's watching the cosby show which was a sinful show but that's what we did instead of watching cosby boys did that i went to my room and i made my own baseball cards but i put women in with i drew women with bikinis on there and my mom comes in like jesse what are you doing let me see that card and i was so embarrassed i was caught red-handed you ever talk about being caught red-handed i was totally caught right and one thing i appreciate about my mom she didn't rebuke me in front of everybody she just took the car and said come come in the living room with all of us that's one thing i appreciate about my mom she didn't she didn't publicly shame me she never she had never even brought it up after that amen now that might have been because she's so busy with six kids and didn't have the strength to do it but at the same time i loved how she was patient with me that's good and i there and there was a conversation why are you drawing this why are you doing it and it went back to that while i stayed the night at my friend's house god bless brother ray good to see you sir happy mother's day to your wife brother so that was that that was when my mother she intervened with my battle with the spirit of lust in second or third grade and i really you know because i wasn't the message i really didn't get victory over that until i was in college once i came in the message that's when i finally got victory over that amen but see look how satan does he likes to attack when you're young see that that's why i love how god before even before i even second grade before i could even see that tv god had already showed me the love of god through my mother amen she's already taken me to church she's already dedicated me to jesus christ look where i am today servant jesus christ amen that's why brother masters get them that get those children dedicated to jesus before satan gets his dirty hands on him amen we all have to be tested we all have to be tried but when that mother right she sits there and loves you and prays for you and dedicates you to god hallelujah that's a great blessing amen i still remember when lydia was born i remember i was she was there in a plastic container thing they got for babies which looks like something out of a space movie you know it just it's ridiculous i remember sleeping over on there and in the middle of the night she let out a little square right i kind of like crawled up there and just make sure are you okay i just made sure she okay she's all right i went back and laid down and hold on like is she gonna is lily gonna live is she gonna die she's gonna i thought my wife was gonna die the first time she went in labor that's how far removed i was from anything with you know related to labor or medical things you know so far removed from that but you know uh mother's love was there first oh that's right that when i when i moved there to there i i prayed for i said lord jesus i dedicate lydia to you before the devil can get it amen praise god hallelujah praise god praise god so see that mother has this great impact on you praise god amazing impact on on us on us all and so she is to help you hate evil your mother's there to correct you to show you evil's wrong and he was going to lead you the wrong path right because dad ain't going to be there all the time especially if he's working yeah but she's there to teach you to hate evil in other words that wooden spoon or whatever she uses to correct you or that sticker or whatever it is that ruler whatever it is it's there to get you to hate evil amen praise god and that's why the people today love evil because they were never corrected amen yes right it's true that's why there's there was planning to be many uh there was planning to be many crowds and multitudes gathered around churches today against pro-life churches and they were going to protest life and that see it just it shows they never they never were taught their mothers never taught them see this this is the effect people that love murder generations that love murder because their moms didn't love them of course god would still be merciful and try to save them but the but if they don't surrender to that then this compounds generation generation remember brother and talked about it he said he said your grandmother what was in the choir and she brother says your grandmother was a bob-haired woman to cry choir right he said uh he said your mother uh uh painted her face and wore slacks and he says now you're a striptease so went from bob hare in the choir to sit in the chair the next generation with pants on abomination to now sexy dress tempting men all day look at that's just three generations look at the progress but the opposite is true as well amen let me remind satan to the man amen praise god hallelujah if your mother was a godly saint now look at you you're a godly saint and you've learned and god's growing and god is still restored again the bible said elijah shall restore all things amen amen hallelujah and the holy spirit today is restoring all things amen that pertain to life and godliness [Applause] look where we stand today praise god hallelujah thank god praise god these godly mothers godly fathers think where we would be if it wasn't for that we'd be out there protesting life we'd be on the side of death they are literally on the side of death rejoicing over death singing about death loving death why so they can live a wicked lifestyle because they're lovers of themselves more than lovers of god but we hate ourselves as far as our flesh amen we hate our sinful nature we hate that part of us and we are lovers of god we're lovers of jesus lovers of the word lovers of the holy ghost lovers are repent lovers of godliness amen amen glory and if god if you have the holy spirit work in your life he'll lead you from all appearance of evil amen he'll lead you away from evil like your mother is trying to point you to all those children i should have i should have heard amen maybe i'll get next sunday now so our scripture was this now who wrote proverbs again solomon i'm going to bring a thought out at the end just remember that who wrote it when do you write it beginning middle or end of his life beginning he was on fire for god he was warning everybody against idols he's warned everybody against prostitutes but by the end of his life what did he do he made a prostitute against god he built houses of worship spiritual prostitute unto god to every one of his 100 i'm sorry a thousand wives 300 wives 700 concubines he built a house to all their gods and when he do he didn't live he did it he didn't apply the wisdom gift that god had given to him he didn't invest all the way he stopped investing he stopped fearing the lord he thought i'm so great i'm so gifted i'm so tempted i don't need to keep holding myself may god help us to always hover ourselves no matter no matter how gifted no matter how much you're blessed no matter how many testimonies we have we must keep humble ourselves amen we must be faithful to god and god will bless us amen but if not we go the way of solomon true we're here he's on fire he talks about these women are excellent they deserve compliments yes they deserve but the man said they deserve to know they're great for us they do great things for us yes that's right i love this give her the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates hallelujah in other words all like my mom said all that bread she cast on the water hallelujah it's gonna come back to her all those times she corrected the children uh one day all those two are gonna come back and they say thank you mom for point me on the right direction yes amen thank you for keeping me from a life of sin i've seen my friends go down this road thank you mom for praying for me thank you for telling me when i was sinning thank you for helping me to hate evil i know you praise god amen they will come back and praise her yes i just heard brother and said today that mother's day sermon i was listening to it today but man so you cast your bread upon the water it'll come back to you and he also said it'll come back to you if some people have died and gone on it'll come back to you you'll meet them on the other side in a perfect body and he said they'll thank you over there for your testimony he said because you never know how far your testimony reaches amen and he said it reaches as far as that water that waterway once you splash in the water and it goes out there that's how far your testimony reaches amen it reaches in your family those waves reach to your job amen they reach in your church praise god all those waves of influence your influence just reverberates amen it's constantly uh influencing and hit glory your prayers are constantly hitting people again your prayers are stopping people from going to hell amen sure yes the prayer of faith will save the sick what was it god used the prayer god anointed you and you accepted the anointing and you prayed and god saved the sick hallelujah bless the lord yeah yeah my sister amen from copenhagen amen god uses you and then he calls you an overcomer hallelujah amen so see a woman's fear of the lord is evident it's inside her being and it's also seen on the outside now i want to say this too a woman who fears god still wants to be pretty so i'm gonna i'm gonna deal with a little bit on the outward appearance for a few moments okay all right all right i mean i guess i wrote a book on it to come back to it at some point yeah bill brandon says you know it's just the nature of a woman to want to look pretty sure she's supposed to be that way yes so little girls it's okay to want to look pretty we think you all look real pretty today like i have to tell the girls that's a beautiful dress yes i want them to feel pretty yeah like i like your hair that looks really beautiful today just in a nice godly way they're made they're supposed to be pretty sure praise god yeah rodriguez said about eve uh adam was one strong fine handsome looking man eve was one of the most beautiful women the earth ever seen probably the most beautiful right sure right i'm sure that was the most handsome strong man you'd ever want to see you know right uh that's the way god made them right and you see this also in the scripture you know solomon here when he's young see he's singing about one woman here not a thousand at the end of his life he was singing i guess i guess he was singing the blues to a thousand wives here at the beginning he's singing praise and compliments on his only wife his first wife of course that times the bride yeah jesus christ and the pride right he says you are all fair my love there's no spot in me wow that's that beautiful uh honeymoon love can i say it like that right you have no spot in you you're just perfect for me right right and so we must remind our sisters and our little girls how beautiful god made them to be because the bible says david said i'm going to praise you because i'm fearfully and wonderful wonderfully made marvelous are your works and that my soul knows right well in other words lord i know you gave me this life i know you you call me to be a boy you call me to be a girl whatever you call me to be you've done it well you did it masterfully yes you blessed me amen by making me a boy or making me a girl you blessed me your hand's been upon me praise god i'm saying this by the blood of jesus there is no spot in you amen thank god there's no sin spot in you hallelujah amen hallelujah because that's the real beauty that matters now we all want to keep wrinkles away as far as we can for as long as we can right we all want to keep bringing this away white hair long as we can but the real beauty is inward beauty praise god brother man said now the true thirst a woman should have would be to adorn themselves in modest apparel and to have a christ-like spirit first timothy two verse nine now that's the way a woman should thirst to be how many thirsts for that sisters you want to be modest and you want to have a christ-like spirit now if you want to be pretty that's the way what makes you pretty see is a christ-like spirit and adorned in modest apparel that's the truth so what does the verse say the verse says in life manner women adorn yourselves in modest apparel with shame-facedness and sobriety right yeah so seriousness and shame basically just means uh just a humble it's just it's a humility like you know you would not exalt your face you would not be prideful you just be a humble a humble countenance right it doesn't mean like i'm ashamed i can't go look at brother jesse i can't shake his hand or i can't shake my husband's hand or you know that's not what he's talking about no it's humility yeah you're serious you're not all-time joking all the time although we like to laugh here we like to love the pressure but most times we're serious especially in the house of god and not with broadened hair which in those days was a very costly hairstyle oh yes right now real man tells us and we know that from history braiding hair is not sinful but expensive haircut or i'm sorry expensive hair dudes because we don't believe in women cutting hair expensive hairdos are sinful right just like expensive gold pearls and costly things are expensive as well okay so when we buy such things like that they got to be low cost they shouldn't be in other words you shouldn't spend thousands and thousands of dollars on some of these things what a waste of money what a waste of money that's it you could use that to help someone feed your family or help a neighbor or pay off a bill or something like that use it with use wisdom because it's that's all in vain yes it is it's in vain but instead of being uh instead of being adorned with expensive hairstyles and gold and costing things uh the bible said women professing godliness should be adorned with good works like teaching your children how to hate evil amen that's a good work amen serving your husband praise god loving your husband being good to him all the days of your life that's a good work paying your tithe give it offerings like like brother mj said last week with anna having a ministry of prayer and fasting for the church that's one example like tabitha having a clothing ministry to close people that need new clothes that's a ministry be a woman dedicated to good works sing song specials amen amen you know do what god's called you to do praise god be a woman with good works constantly speaking of the lord jesus christ your life manifest the glory of jesus christ amen now in the book i got this picture there just everybody knows the god breaks the body up into five parts you have head the breast or bosom you have the belly loins and thighs you have legs and then feet well these verses show how the the bosom area's nakedness daniel genesis and isaiah show how the belly loins and thighs are nakedness and then and then you know we're not quite sure where the you know brother man says pass your knee that's a great that's a great advice but in my book i just put for wisdom sake you should cover from the shoulder down to your shin that's what i put in the book so i think that's the wisest thing to do because i think with the shoulder any man once he sees an exposed shoulder he's thinking about the bra like he's tempted by bras right brothers that that's why you want to cover the shoulder right and you want to you want to your skirt to go down somewhere to your shins because if you sit down and it goes up above your knees and that's that exposes the thigh and the bible says that's nakedness remember i showed you that picture in the 1920s in chicago they used to measure the women's dr uh swimsuits to make sure they were at least six inches above the knee they used to have tape measure can you imagine i would not want that job i'll tell you that right now let that be for the sinners you know they had tape measures literally measuring oh no six and a half don't change can't come in can't come on the beach they're gonna cause men to stumble now who's smarter i'll stir that who do you think could i mean the the center right the sinners of this generation are the centers of that who's smarter they were a lot smarter than the sinners of this generation right now in the book i also put guidelines for modesty these are both male and female men should only wear male garments women should only wear women garments we should wear loose clothing because we don't want it too tight we must be aware that our clothing don't get too tight especially our sisters right as far as i know i've never walked to the pulpit with a skin skin type shirt on you know so it would be gross anyway so i'm not going to even do it i don't even consider it anyway to begin with so but you know with our sisters that's the thing of temptation their clothes are too tight you know sisters made by god to be beautiful right it's attractive to men we've got to make sure the clothes are loose right right and then cover areas of nakedness now the message i think i think the errors to be aware of is that we don't expose thighs and the sisters don't show cleavage we should never do that but sometimes people get close to the edges right especially sisters let me say like this if you lean over like that and then people can see your cleavage then your shirt's too loose yeah you won't lose clothing but you don't want it that loose maybe wear a tight shirt underneath yeah right just wisdom wisdom because we all need reminders praise god and brothers too if you re if you see my my suit pants are getting a little too tight somebody come tell me about that i don't think i mean we just we've got to be we got to be wise it's for male and female yeah right i try to emphasize that in there that's right i mean like i'm on youtube right i'm watching a sermon what's the first ad that comes up this guy's got no shirt on he's got huge muscles he's like which one am i gonna eat tonight salad or pizza i'm like dude get the shirt on man but like right that's the temptation right so brothers can use their their muscles as temptation as well right true yeah they're so demon-possessed remember it's only demons that take clothes off amen right remember when the sons of schemer tried to cast out devil with the devil said i know paul i know jesus who are you and the vibes of those demons ripped off their clothes right i'll never forget i think it was around the year 2000 brother ray right when i come in the message they had the summer olympics and the women's soccer team was just getting popular do you remember that woman she scored a goal from the u.s do you remember that and she pulled off her shirt and she had a bra underneath they put it on the cover of sports illustrated i'm like what was that that was a demonic power sure she just had a black sports bra i can still i can still see that unfortunately you know we're scarred by these things i can still see this cover the sports illustrated she's like this and she's got her shirt off and it's just a sports bra now of course they've done wicked things like that all through the year you know the swimsuit editions and things like that satan is the one who's telling them to take out their clothes hallelujah but god is telling us put them on amen be modest in your clothing praise god and then wear thick clothing or multiple layers of clothing because remember adam and eve they just had lambskins which is thick clothing they were wearing lambskins couldn't see through them yeah so like brawls visible today that's where message people got to watch out you know you just don't want to do that or brothers you don't want such a thin shirt where everybody can see your big muscles popping out of there right i hope it's not i hope it hasn't happened here you know but you wanna you want to use wisdom right it's for male and female i've always tried to be gracious that way i always want to be balanced i don't want to preach too hard on the women men need it too we all need it brother don't go to sleep hallelujah and god because this because this sisters god will honor you amen hallelujah god will command you god will compliment you for this because you turned down the demons of this world and you lived according to god's will and god's spirit and god will honor you one day with eternal life amen amen hallelujah amen and then also i remember i put remember i put in the book as well there's that honor your body guideline where we don't do tattoos and body piercings right because demons are the ones that cut themselves right a demon cut himself with stone a demon-possessed man comes up with stones uh the prophets of baal cut themselves cry not that's a demon driving people to do that right right true but we know there's mercy for those who've done it right god forgives us all right all you have to do is repent and then the demon leaves hallelujah like i told you that testimony i almost got a tattoo before i would come in the message but thank god i felt some i felt some conviction i called my pastor and he put his wife on the phone and talked me out of it with a leviticus scripture isn't that funny the nominations like to use uh they say well we're not under the law but then they sure like to use the law with me yeah right yeah oh yeah the same people say oh women don't have to wear skirts but they just use the law to tell me not to see the contradiction they use the law but they pick and choose when they want to see we're not look we're not under the law but we're under the spirit of god praise god we're under the spirit of holiness praise god and the bible says in romans 8 we fulfill the righteousness of the lord praise god that's true so those holy commands that remain the holy commands god carries over we fulfill those not by legalism no not not not by any human effort but by the love of god in our hearts amen like on some of the austin i think it was awesome the other day no i don't care i said these people don't even know what legalism is right legalism is adding to the bible adding some human command onto the bible but if the bible says it that's not legalism that's obedience right the church said amen amen so you either have obedience or you have legalism on this side they add and add or they have legitiousness jude says so i i just made it easy there's three elves either love god and obey or you're into legalism you add or lasheviousness the says um makes the turns the grace of god into lasheviousness amen right lawlessness the shittiestness is lawlessness oh you can do whatever you want you're going to be saved and you're going to be forgiven well only so far it only goes so far if you're willing to repent hallelujah let's choose love let's use that middle of the road praise god amen let's choose love by the grace of god amen now our sisters also because they like to be pretty uh that's a great thing and our brothers do but we've got to choose to honor god with our bodies and that's where a lot of people fail today they don't honor god in their body the bible says you're bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body in your body and the church said amen and in your spirit your mind so you have to purposely honor god with your body say this body is not mine it was bought with a price i've got to take care of this body and i'm going to take care of my mind i got to make sure i meditate and think about and and imagine all good things that god has god has given to me amen five verses later he says this every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things everybody say all can we all say oh oh that means self-control in every area of your life now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an uncomfortable crowd so we are trying glory we are trying to win a race this morning amen i'm here running a race praise god i'm here you're here to win a prize that god has set before you praise god you're here running a marathon this morning amen amen you might have started out of sprint but then you have to realize i gotta humble myself i'm gonna wear out before i or i'm gonna rust out right now before i wear out before i rest out right if you don't take care of your body if you're just all spiritual all spiritual you don't rest your body you don't take care of your body you're gonna wear out or before you rest out we must all earn or we're running a race and we must run it with perseverance praise god and we must learn to be temperate in all things amen praise god so we must control everything that goes into our body right let's control everything that stays in our mind sure and if you're born again the soul your soul is good just got to feed it every day right all right remember that verse i was listening to a sermon i appreciate it brother can just say because i always like to what did i preach your camel so i don't really preach the same thing you know if i preach that thought where you have three parts with all three parts the body's saying feed me feed me feed me so is the mind the mind saying feed me give me something to think about give me imagination conscious memory reason affection feed me be me me and then the soul saying feed me feed me because david said my soul thirsts after god the living god so all day long you got three people or three not three people three parts calling feed me feed me feed me feed me and what do you feed whichever one you feed that's what you'll see the effects of amen hallelujah so we must feed the soul first amen feed your soul the word of god worship god pray seek god's righteousness die daily feed your soul the word in church i'll say this the rest of it will work out praise god hallelujah you seek the kingdom of god first everything else the bodies come out for god will provide amen hallelujah that's the trouble the trouble is when we feed the body too much instead of the soul or we feed the mind the wrong thoughts praise god hallelujah so we gotta feed them a balanced diet [Applause] praise god so see daily worship and prayer will relieve your stress okay they've proven that by science i don't have the articles but i'd like to go find them i've seen them before scientists or doctors will test those people go to church and those people who don't the people that go to church have a lot less stress yes it does yeah they're kind of feeling all happy all the time you know smiling all the time right right hallelujah true and then for your body drink a lot of water and avoid sugar and fast food avoid it sure if you put trash in you're going to get trash out right remember i think i told austin that brother from iowa he drank diet coke all day you can imagine that so his body's saying feed me water and he would just take a diet coke instead he got so bad he couldn't walk upstairs his name's brother rich he's still the message he's a tremendous brother loving brother he said one day he was praying and said god heal me this arthritis the devil told him it was arthritis it was just uh aspartame build up in his body his bones and somebody come around and said well you're probably drinking too much diet coke he stopped drinking diet coke within one week he was walking upstairs and now he's fine he's never had no problems okay yeah see that sugar is meant to kill you why do they put sugar advertisements pop advertisements on sports and and the movies all these things because it's trying to kill you it's trying to get you six you get on medication so you stay in the doctor's office well i want to stay in one doctor's office this is the doctor's office [Applause] doctor jesus amen i want him to see me more often than dr saunders down the road so i go right down the road here to doctor once a year i'm like i'm glad i just see you once a year buddy i'm glad i'm hoping i can see you less you know but they've got to check me over here to make sure i'm healthy so praise god but see if you treat your temple wrong you're going to experience the effects of it a brother texts me last week he said brother how do you pray and fast for a demon of diabetes i said brother i said you just you don't you don't have to you just got to change your diet and i got a quote for it brother and said diabetes is not a germ because the germs have the demon in them from amsterdam diabetes is chemical meaning you're putting too much sugar in your body chemicals and the church says god can change the diabetes right away too sure but i went on webmd and know what they said they said people with type 2 diabetes can reverse it just by exercising and drinking less pop and just having a more balanced lifestyle and i said to the brother he said oh thank you that's very helpful hallelujah you can reverse the curse reverse the curse you put on yourself oh the devil put this on me no you did is that right church because you didn't honor god's temple praise god that's right god said well don't call for that your lust call for that now that's a clear lust of the flesh right there yes pop and sugar and sweets and all this thing your body ain't meant to take that all that sugar yeah that's why it's got to store it later you know it's going to source it for later on it makes you overweight is that right yeah your body's made to eat like the garden of eden praise god all the grains and everything like i heard a preacher say to his own shame our preacher said the only green thing i eat is jello he said i'm glad i'm not a skinny 108 pound person i'm glad i'm overweight no church now to me that was like that was so sad yeah that is a disrespect to this that's right and it was interesting the brother later come down with cancer he hadn't changed his diet still has cancer hadn't had it for years now you know perry green had i don't know if you knew this pair of green cancer you know what he did he went to an all-vegetable diet and he did got healed of cancer naturally he did not die of cancer he died of just natural old age huh does it make us think a little bit today now most of you know these if you've been around for a little bit here you know just trying to review because that's what our mother should do that's what our fathers should do we should honor god my house my body's a temple praise god hallelujah do you think god wants a debilitated temple oh he's hanging out in the doctor's office instead of in the church missing church because you're in the doctor you think god wants that no especially if you know better and you do it to yourself now we know this too there's also the warning due to her beauty though sinful men make women into idols i'm gonna do it at my time okay remember the bible says the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with men when these men these generations of uh i'm sorry the generations that come at noah's time when they choose a woman just because she's sexy dress god said i can stand it no longer yeah right of course there's violence in the earth there's numerous there's numerous uh attributes of those days but this was one of the big ones you had to be 120 days he says now then jesus said as it was in days of noah so shall be the days of the son of man they eat they drank they married wives see they were given america we see the same thing so it must be the same sons of god that should have married godly character and said married sexy dressed women sons of god now the only way they can do that is if their food's virgin right yeah a real holy ghost for a person he'll pray and fast right he'll pray and fast because he knows this is the second greatest decision outside of me being saved i'm going to pray and fast and make sure i choose the right one praise god see they're not flying you know like a holy ghost person they're not flying they just don't well see if this works out you know yeah my wife and i we've talked to numerous friends over the years that are not the message they're uh denominational and they've got divorce and we've asked them you know my wife and i was how much did you pray about did you see any of these signs in your divorce spouse while you were recording and they're like yeah we're just blinded to it because of sexual lust
