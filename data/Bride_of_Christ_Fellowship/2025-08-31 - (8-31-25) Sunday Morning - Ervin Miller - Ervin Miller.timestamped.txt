[0:00] of bondage.
[0:04] I don't think any of us wants to be in
[0:05] bondage.
[0:07] The price is paid and we can be free.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; And if we're free, we're free indeed.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; So, you want to turn to Galatians chap 2
[0:19] verse 20. We'll read that.
[0:26] Galatians chapter 2 verse 20.
[0:37] I am crucified with Christ.
[0:39] Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but
[0:44] Christ lives in me. And the life which I
[0:47] now live in the flesh, I live by the
[0:51] faith of the Son of God, who loved me
[0:53] and gave himself for me.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; I do not frustrate the grace of God. For
[0:58] if righteousness comes by the law, then
[1:01] Christ is dead in vain.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads for prayer.
[1:10] Heavenly Father,
[1:12] we thank you for your gift.
[1:15] We thank you for your love. We thank you
[1:17] for your Holy Spirit.
[1:20] Lord, we ask you
[1:23] that your spirit would be here present
[1:26] today. Lead and guide and direct us,
[1:28] Lord.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, use
[1:33] my lips.
[1:36] Lord, help me to surrender
[1:40] that you can speak through me. And Lord,
[1:42] I ask that every heart would be
[1:45] surrendered to you here today.
[1:48] And Lord, speak to us whatever you want
[1:50] us to have. Lord, we want your living
[1:54] water to flow through our lives. Thank
[1:57] you, Lord, for this. And we praise you
[2:02] for the price you paid at Calvary for
[2:04] each one of us. Thank you that we can be
[2:07] free and free indeed. Amen.
[2:11] You may be seated.
[2:17] So Paul here in Galatians, he
[2:22] he wrote a lot to us. Paul was a man. He
[2:27] he thought he was doing right.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is with a lot of
[2:36] people today? It was the way that it was
[2:38] with me and probably with all of you if
[2:41] we're honest.
[2:46] So the day came that Christ opens our
[2:50] eyes if we want them open.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; It even says I think it's in Ephesians
[2:54] it says he opens the eyes of our
[2:56] understanding.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; So we need Christ to open
[3:03] our understanding to reveal himself to
[3:06] us because Paul experienced that. Paul
[3:08] was a man. He was persecuting the true
[3:10] Christians,
[3:12] but he was living the law or under the
[3:15] law. He thought he was doing right.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; But one day he found out that he wasn't
[3:20] doing right and Christ met him.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; How many people to hear here today can
[3:28] say they experienced that? that one day
[3:31] we realized that we weren't doing right,
[3:33] but that Christ was revealed to us and
[3:36] from that day on our life changed. Our
[3:39] life was different. I'm one of them.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; It was by his grace that we are what we
[3:47] are.
[3:52] So here in in Galatians chapter 3, it
[3:55] says, "Oh foolish Galatians, who has
[3:57] bewitched you that ye should not obey
[3:59] the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[4:02] has been evidently set forth, crucified
[4:05] among you? This only would I learn of
[4:08] you, receive ye the spirit by the works
[4:10] of the law, or by the hearing of the
[4:12] faith?"
[4:16] So why did God bring the law through
[4:18] Moses?
[4:24] Are ye so foolish, having begun in the
[4:27] spirit, are ye now made perfect by the
[4:30] flesh?
[4:34] Have you suffered so many things in
[4:35] vain? If it yet, if it be yet in vain,
[4:40] he therefore that ministers to you the
[4:42] spirit, and workketh miracles among you,
[4:44] does he it by the works of the law, or
[4:47] by the hearing of faith?
[4:52] Even as Abraham believed God and it was
[4:55] accounted to him for righteousness.
[5:01] So Abraham is the father of faith. We
[5:04] can learn a lot through Abraham. If we
[5:07] did Abraham do everything right? No, he
[5:10] didn't.
[5:12] I'm glad for that.
[5:17] If we look through the Bible, if we if
[5:19] we read through the Bible, there's a lot
[5:22] of people that God used that didn't live
[5:25] a very good life.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Actually, they were living in sin. the
[5:29] adulterous woman, the woman at the well.
[5:33] A lot of different uh most of them
[5:40] didn't live a good life until one day
[5:44] that Christ came into their heart and it
[5:48] changed them. And that's how it is with
[5:49] us. We're no different. But what I want
[5:53] to point out there, let not the devil
[5:57] condemn us if we fail miserably in our
[6:00] lives.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't want us to be free.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus said, "It is finished,"
[6:08] the price was paid for all sin.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Once for all, it doesn't need to be paid
[6:15] again.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; So, how do we receive it? Do we have to
[6:18] do a lot of good works to live the law
[6:21] to to get it? Or is it or does do we
[6:23] believe that it is a free gift?
[6:27] &gt;&gt; If somebody wants to give me something,
[6:30] I receive it. I say, "Thank you. I don't
[6:32] need to pay anything for it. If it's a
[6:34] gift, right?
[6:35] &gt;&gt; It's free."
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; And that's how Christ wants us to be. He
[6:39] wants us to be free. He paid the price
[6:41] that we can be free if we believe.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; If we believe.
[6:53] But why is it our nature,
[6:56] it seems more right sometimes to try to
[7:00] live the law?
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't it that sometimes if we fail, we
[7:09] try to do better, we try to do good for
[7:11] a couple weeks and
[7:14] we don't need to do that. we repent and
[7:16] we can be free instantly
[7:19] &gt;&gt; because a lot of times if we try to do
[7:21] better and better and better we fail
[7:23] again and then we condemn oursel again
[7:25] and that we are not under condemnation
[7:27] if we are in Christ. Now it says even as
[7:31] Abraham believed God it was accounted to
[7:33] him for righteousness.
[7:35] Then it says know ye therefore that they
[7:37] which are of the faith the same are the
[7:40] children of Abraham.
[7:43] And as the scripture foreseeing that God
[7:45] would justify the heathen through faith
[7:48] preached before the gospel unto Abraham,
[7:51] saying, "In thee shall all nations be
[7:53] blessed."
[7:55] So then they which be of faith are
[7:57] blessed with faithful Abraham. For as
[8:00] many as are of the works of the law are
[8:02] under the curse.
[8:05] For it is written, cursed is everyone
[8:07] that continues not in all things which
[8:12] are written in the book of the law to do
[8:14] them. Wow.
[8:20] So why do we want to live under the law?
[8:24] &gt;&gt; The law
[8:27] is a school master to bring us to
[8:29] Christ.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[8:32] It shows us we can't live a life good
[8:34] enough.
[8:37] So we need to turn to Christ.
[8:41] But that a man is justified by the law
[8:44] in the sight of God. It is evidence for
[8:46] the just shall live by faith.
[8:50] So I want to be one of them that we will
[8:53] live by faith.
[9:04] I'm going to go back. I think it's in
[9:06] Genesis
[9:13] chapter 4.
[9:35] talking about Cain and Abel.
[9:43] It says here in chapter 4 verse
[9:49] three, "And in the process of time, it
[9:53] came to pass that Cain brought of the
[9:55] fruit of the ground an offering unto the
[9:57] Lord. And Abel als he also brought of
[10:01] the firstlings of his flock, and of the
[10:05] fat thereof. And the Lord had respect
[10:07] unto Abel and his offerings, but unto
[10:10] Cain and his offerings he had not
[10:12] respect. And Cain was very wroth, and
[10:15] his contendants fell. And the Lord said
[10:18] unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? And why
[10:20] is thy contendants fallen? If thou doeth
[10:23] well, shall thou not be accepted? And if
[10:26] thou doeth not well, sin layst at the
[10:29] door, and unto thee shall be his desire,
[10:32] and thou shalt rule over him.
[10:37] So Cain was a very religious man.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; He thought he was doing right. He was
[10:45] working. He was doing a lot of work with
[10:47] his hands to bring fruit. And so he was
[10:50] raising crops to bring fruit for an
[10:53] offering to the Lord. But Abel
[10:57] had something different. And here's
[10:58] something very important to understand.
[11:01] Abel had the revelation what God wanted
[11:06] to please him. He had the revelation
[11:09] that it takes faith
[11:12] to trust him to believe him. Cain was
[11:15] trying to work his with his good works
[11:18] trying to get good works so God would
[11:20] accept him and it didn't work.
[11:24] So that's the way it is today.
[11:27] Either we're trying to worship God by
[11:30] our good works or we worship him through
[11:34] faith, revelation.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; And where does revelation come from? Re
[11:41] true revelation comes from God. He
[11:44] reveals something to us about the word
[11:46] of God. And the mystery is hid in the
[11:49] word of God. And he reveals it to his
[11:52] people.
[11:54] Whoever's hearts are true, whoever
[11:56] really wants it, he reveals it to us.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:08] Then if we go in the next chapter,
[12:14] well the other thing we should point out
[12:16] that one day Cain and Abel were out
[12:20] about
[12:22] and Cain slew his brother and killed
[12:25] him.
[12:27] Isn't that exactly what's happening
[12:28] today?
[12:32] That spirit that Cain had is still
[12:34] trying to persecute the true Christian
[12:37] believers.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; So we need to understand
[12:46] just because we're in a church,
[12:49] just because we go to church,
[12:52] just because we have a big church
[12:55] doesn't say we're serving God at all.
[13:04] But just to stop and think a little bit
[13:09] to go back to Cain worshiping,
[13:12] if we could see Cain's worship, offering
[13:15] to God, and Abel's worshiping to God,
[13:19] his bloody lamb, which one looked the
[13:22] best?
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is today?
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[13:35] People go into church,
[13:38] they dress right,
[13:41] they try to do right,
[13:44] but they don't have the revelation what
[13:46] God really wants.
[13:49] They keep a set of rules
[13:52] or they try to.
[13:58] So I think that's the very deceiving
[14:00] thing that Satan is doing today.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; He's got a lot of people wrapped up in
[14:05] religion.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; And let it not be us.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; But it is it is a hard thing to come out
[14:14] of religion to the true thing.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; It takes the revelation from God. It
[14:21] takes the power of God to come out from
[14:24] among them and be separated.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[14:28] God's has God has to open our eyes and
[14:31] give us the strength and the power to do
[14:34] that.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; We're going to go to Genesis 5 now. It
[14:40] talks about Enoch in verse 24. Genesis 5
[14:44] 24 it says, "And Enoch walked with God
[14:48] and he was not for God took him."
[14:53] &gt;&gt; Why did God take him? because he was
[14:56] walking with God. How many people here
[14:59] today are walking with God?
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say that he was going to
[15:08] church, that he was keeping a set of
[15:10] rules or anything like that,
[15:13] but he says he walked with God.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; And I think it's if you go back further
[15:19] in Genesis 2, where Adam and Eve, they
[15:22] could eat of the tree of life.
[15:25] God had a relationship with them and
[15:28] that's what he wants with us. He wants
[15:30] us to have a relationship with him.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Do we need to go to church then? Yes, we
[15:36] need to go to church. We want to go to
[15:38] church.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; But we go to church because we have God
[15:42] in our hearts. The Holy Spirit, the
[15:44] token. Yes, sir.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; I think the token is represents the Holy
[15:49] Spirit.
[15:55] Praise the Lord.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; I hope we can all experience this what
[16:05] Eno had experienced.
[16:08] We're living in the last times. I think
[16:10] we all agree we're living in the last
[16:11] time. The prophet was here to bring to
[16:14] reveal the mysteries of God in the Bible
[16:18] to bring things out so we can understand
[16:22] what the Bible, what he's talking about
[16:26] and he left
[16:30] and he's been gone for quite some time,
[16:32] isn't he?
[16:33] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit is here to lead and
[16:36] guide and direct us.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; I believe the time is getting close.
[16:53] that there's more people going to be
[16:55] raptured out of here.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; The true believers
[17:00] are going to be taken out. Amen.
[17:19] I'm going to turn to numbers.
[17:24] Well, I should start at another place.
[17:27] My mind goes back a little bit. when the
[17:30] when God we know there's different
[17:33] exodus but when God brought the children
[17:36] of Israel out of Egypt so he he brought
[17:40] a nation out of a nation
[17:45] &gt;&gt; so he called them out he didn't want
[17:48] them to be in bondage any longer
[17:51] &gt;&gt; he had a promised land that they were
[17:54] supposed to go to and how many days was
[17:57] it supposed to take to to the promised
[17:59] land.
[18:03] Was it 40 days?
[18:07] Did it take 40 days?
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Why did they spend 40 years in the
[18:14] wilderness?
[18:16] Because of unbelief.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; I think unbelief is the number one sin.
[18:26] If we don't trust our maker, Was
[18:31] it easy to get the children of Israel
[18:33] out?
[18:35] He sent Moses the prophet to get him
[18:37] out.
[18:39] Isn't that wonderful? If we look now,
[18:43] he also sent a prophet to get us out.
[18:47] Right.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; It's true. Amen.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; He brought a church out of Israel. Now
[18:52] he wants to have get a bride out of the
[18:56] church.
[18:58] To the natural carnal man, that doesn't
[19:00] sound very good, does it?
[19:03] &gt;&gt; That God is calling somebody out of the
[19:06] church.
[19:09] But he is.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; He is. So, we got to understand that God
[19:14] is calling people out of the church.
[19:16] People received the church
[19:19] instead of him.
[19:25] So now he's calling his loved ones out,
[19:29] the predestinated ones out out of the
[19:31] church to follow him
[19:34] to have a relationship with him.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have a good relationship
[19:43] with our Lord, right?
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Then sometimes it seems like
[19:49] a door is closed or partly closed.
[19:52] I think it's like this.
[19:56] If we would go out here, try to start
[19:58] our car and it wouldn't start.
[20:03] The battery might be okay
[20:06] if we put like God is the battery. The
[20:09] battery might be okay, but maybe there's
[20:11] a corrosion on the wire or on the clamp
[20:16] that goes onto the battery that it's
[20:17] corroded. Sometimes that's all that's
[20:20] wrong that we can't start it.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; It's on any motor or any equipment, a
[20:25] track or anything like that. So, we have
[20:27] to take the clamp off and clean it and
[20:30] put it back on and everything's okay.
[20:33] Was the battery dead? No.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; So, our God isn't dead.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. That's true. Amen.
[20:42] So time sometimes I think we get away
[20:47] from God or we turn to earthly things
[20:50] and then things are not good between us
[20:53] and God
[20:55] &gt;&gt; but God is still there waiting for us
[20:58] &gt;&gt; waiting for us to return
[21:00] &gt;&gt; back to him.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; But it says in John 10 I think it says
[21:04] my sheep hear my voice.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; So his sheep are going to return right
[21:09] back to him. Amen.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Even if we fail, if we fall, the true if
[21:14] the truth is in in here, well, just like
[21:17] King David, he fell.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; He murdered.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; He committed adultery. He done a lot of
[21:22] things.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; But did he lose salvation?
[21:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't.
[21:30] How do we know that?
[21:32] Because he cried out to God. He said,
[21:34] "Restore unto me the joy of thy
[21:38] salvation." He lost his joy.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; He lost his joy.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; So God called the children of Israel. He
[21:53] worked through a prophet
[21:55] to bring them out of Egypt.
[22:00] So he told them
[22:03] to take a lamb,
[22:06] kill the lamb, put the blood around the
[22:09] door post. We know that story.
[22:12] And wherever the blood was applied,
[22:15] when the death angel came through,
[22:17] they're going to be safe, right?
[22:22] &gt;&gt; So can we apply the blood today
[22:25] &gt;&gt; on our hearts?
[22:28] Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; We can.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; And wherever the blood was in the
[22:33] plight, the oldest son was dead, right?
[22:37] &gt;&gt; And cattle.
[22:43] So, we might as well believe in the
[22:46] blood of the lamb.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; That's the only safe place we have.
[22:52] We can't believe the the world is
[22:55] falling apart.
[22:57] Whatever it is, if we believe in the
[23:00] true blood of the lamb, the token is
[23:02] applied. We're free. We're saved.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; So, the children of Israel came out.
[23:10] They went through a lot of things. I'm
[23:12] going to skip over a lot of They came to
[23:13] the Red Sea.
[23:16] I think sometimes we face things like
[23:19] that, like the Red Sea, things that look
[23:21] impossible. This looked impossible.
[23:24] There approximately two million people
[23:27] there. And this was a big sea. It wasn't
[23:30] just a little river to cross. It looked
[23:32] impossible for them to cross. But what
[23:34] did they do?
[23:36] Moses asked God what to do. And God told
[23:40] him what to do to put his staff out over
[23:43] the water. Right? The water separated.
[23:47] The winds went through and dried it up.
[23:49] And they could walk through there. Amen.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Did when they came to the other side,
[23:54] the enemy was following them. Did the
[23:56] enemy make it through?
[23:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Why not?
[24:03] &gt;&gt; We're still serving the same God.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Now, the children of Israel, they were
[24:12] singing and praising God, but they
[24:15] realized finally in a short time that
[24:18] their own flesh was their biggest enemy,
[24:20] right?
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is with us?
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; So, that's why Apostle Paul said, "I die
[24:29] daily."
[24:30] We have to die daily to our flesh
[24:33] &gt;&gt; so the spirit can live in us.
[24:38] So I want to point something out here.
[24:40] They were supposed to be in the land of
[24:42] Canaan, the promised land, which
[24:45] the promised land for us is the word of
[24:48] God, right? The promises that are in the
[24:51] book here, we can receive all of them.
[24:54] We're supposed to receive all of them.
[24:59] So a lot of things happened through the
[25:01] desert time. They murmured, they
[25:03] complained and got you know what
[25:06] happened. Some died.
[25:09] But here towards the end,
[25:15] I'm going to read a little bit here in
[25:17] Numbers 14. Something that really stood
[25:19] out to me about Caleb.
[25:22] Numbers 14,
[25:25] verse 23. I'm going to start. Surely
[25:29] they shall not see the land which I
[25:31] swear unto their fathers, neither shall
[25:34] any of them that provoke me see it.
[25:39] But this is the verse, verse 24, that
[25:42] really stood out to me. But my servant
[25:44] Caleb, because he had another spirit
[25:47] with him, and had followed me fully, him
[25:52] will I bring into the land where into I
[25:56] went, and his sea shall possess it.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[26:02] Look at that.
[26:05] Caleb had a different spirit.
[26:14] That's why we need the Holy Spirit.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; We need to be born again.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; We can go to church all our lives and if
[26:24] we're not born again, we're going to
[26:26] miss it.
[26:41] So they sent 12 spies over in the land
[26:44] of Canaan to see how the land is.
[26:49] When they came back, Josh and Caleb
[26:52] said, "We can take the land if God is
[26:55] with us."
[26:58] But the other 10 said, "They can't.
[27:01] There are giants over there.
[27:04] We can't take it.
[27:07] You know what happened?
[27:10] Whatever they said is what happened to
[27:12] them.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; We can be careful with our words.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; We can be very careful with our words.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[27:23] &gt;&gt; So, two of them believed they could take
[27:24] it. 10 of them believed they couldn't.
[27:27] And that's what happened.
[27:33] So verse 26 it says, "And the Lord spake
[27:36] unto Moses and Aaron, saying, how long
[27:39] shall I bear with this evil congregation
[27:42] which murmur against me? I have heard
[27:45] the murmuring of the children of Israel,
[27:48] which they murmured against me, say unto
[27:50] me, as truly as I live, sayeth the Lord,
[27:54] as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I
[27:57] do unto you.
[28:00] Your carcasses shall fall in this
[28:02] wilderness, and all that were numbered
[28:04] of you according to your whole number
[28:07] from 20 years old and upward, which have
[28:10] murmured against me.
[28:15] Doubtless ye shall not come into the
[28:18] land concerning which I swear to make
[28:20] you dwell therein, save Caleb
[28:24] and Joshua.
[28:27] But verse 31 it says,
[28:30] "But your little ones which ye said
[28:33] should be a prey, they will I bring in,
[28:37] and they shall know the land which ye
[28:41] have despised."
[28:44] Do we have little ones in here today?
[28:49] Praise the Lord for little children.
[28:53] Little children get a free ticket to
[28:56] heaven, right?
[28:58] &gt;&gt; What about the adults?
[29:04] It is paid for us, too.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; I know there's people already concerned
[29:12] about the children.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; What will happen with the children if
[29:15] the rapture comes?
[29:20] I think God will take care of the little
[29:22] children.
[29:24] I really do.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about that.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; God loves the little children.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; He loves the big men and women also.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Do we love him?
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; We need to love him with all our heart,
[29:45] mind, and soul.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to love each other.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; So, Moses died because he
[30:00] couldn't enter into the land.
[30:06] So Joshua and Caleb
[30:11] and the young people could enter in, but
[30:14] they had to step in the water and then
[30:17] the water stopped
[30:19] and ran away. Right?
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that a step of faith?
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's I think we need to do
[30:28] the same thing. We need to step forward
[30:30] in faith. Once we can see something,
[30:33] it's not faith anymore.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Faith is we see it. If we if we can't
[30:38] see it, but we believe it.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; That's faith. Abraham had that faith.
[30:53] Shared a little bit about Abraham.
[30:59] Abraham had the promise.
[31:02] God told him he's going to have a son.
[31:09] But I think this is something we need to
[31:11] point out that happens in our lives.
[31:15] Abraham was promised to have a son
[31:19] and Sarah, but they were getting older.
[31:23] I think they were what, 86 years old.
[31:31] God told him his seat should be like the
[31:34] sand along the seashore and like the
[31:36] stars in heaven. This looked very
[31:38] impossible
[31:41] &gt;&gt; in their old age. So finally Sarah
[31:44] decided
[31:46] that she's not going to have the son. So
[31:51] Sarah told Abraham he can take Hagar
[31:57] to bring the son.
[32:02] We can do the very same thing in our
[32:04] life
[32:08] if we don't trust God.
[32:10] Take things into our own hands.
[32:15] Well, he Abraham took Hagar
[32:19] and she became pregnant and Hagar bare a
[32:23] son. His name is called Ishmael.
[32:27] All right?
[32:29] But God said that's not the son of the
[32:32] promise.
[32:34] So God came to him and told him
[32:38] anyway, hey Sarah got pregnant in her
[32:41] old age and bear a son Isaac which is
[32:44] the son of the promise.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; So they were what 13 14 years difference
[32:51] in age
[32:56] and they didn't get along too well did
[32:57] they?
[33:00] Because the son of the flesh persecuted
[33:03] the son that was born after the spirit
[33:06] which was Isaac
[33:08] and that's the way it is today.
[33:11] That fight was going from that day on.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is sir?
[33:19] So one day
[33:25] in Genesis 21:9,
[33:30] the children grew up. Verse 8, and the
[33:32] child grew and was weaned, and Abraham
[33:34] made a great feast in the same day that
[33:36] Isaac was weaned.
[33:39] And Sarah saw that the son of Hagar the
[33:42] Egyptian, which she had born unto
[33:46] Abraham, mocking.
[33:49] Wherefore she said unto Abraham, "Cast
[33:52] out the bond woman and her son. For the
[33:55] son of the bond woman shall not be heir
[33:58] with my son, even with Isaac."
[34:05] And the thing was very grievious in
[34:07] Abraham's sight because of the son. And
[34:10] God said unto Abraham, "Let it not be
[34:13] grievious in thy sight
[34:16] because of the lad and because of thy
[34:18] bond woman
[34:20] in all that Sarah hath said unto thee,
[34:23] hearken unto her voice.
[34:26] For in Isaac shall thy seat be called.
[34:32] So he had to cast out the bond woman and
[34:37] her son.
[34:40] We can easily see that, right?
[34:43] That didn't work.
[34:47] But do we know that we all have to cast
[34:50] out the bond woman and her son in our
[34:54] life?
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[34:59] We need to get out of bondage.
[35:02] The sun represents
[35:05] the works that come from the bond woman
[35:09] in our lives.
[35:14] So either we are believing
[35:17] like Abraham
[35:19] and we're
[35:22] enjoying our son Isaac
[35:26] which is by faith
[35:29] or we're still in bondage.
[35:34] Paul gave a very clear directions on
[35:37] that.
[35:41] So, we read some in uh in Galatians, and
[35:45] I'm going to turn back to
[35:50] Galatians again.
[35:54] What Paul had to say after that Paul was
[35:56] converted. He wrote a lot of the New
[35:58] Testament.
[36:03] Did Paul receive it because of his
[36:05] intellectual, his smartness? No. He
[36:09] received it by revelation.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; From God.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; God gave him revelation. That's why he
[36:15] could why his life was changed.
[36:20] So that's
[36:23] precious to me.
[36:26] God didn't destroy Paul because Paul
[36:29] killed people, put people in the prison,
[36:32] persecuted them. God is a God of love, a
[36:36] God of forgiveness.
[36:39] and we look there's a lot of things
[36:43] to share on that but in here in uh
[36:49] Galatians chapter 4
[36:54] not sure where I want to start
[37:01] in verse three
[37:04] even so we when we were children were in
[37:07] bondage under the elements of the world.
[37:09] But when the fullness of the time was
[37:10] come, God sent forth his son made of a
[37:14] woman made under the law to redeem them
[37:17] that were under the law that we might
[37:19] receive the adoptions as sons.
[37:23] So here if we go back to Mary,
[37:27] Virgin Mary, Mary was a young girl.
[37:31] She probably thought she was going to
[37:33] marry Joseph and have children and raise
[37:35] a family and
[37:38] like a lot of us. But one day, God sent
[37:42] an angel to Mary and said she will be
[37:45] pregnant.
[37:47] The Holy Ghost going to come upon her.
[37:50] She didn't realize what was going to
[37:52] take place or how it was going to take
[37:54] place, but something we need to
[37:57] understand that she surrendered.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; She surrendered. She trusted God.
[38:04] Whatever it is. So Jesus
[38:08] was born through Virgin Mary.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; So today we got to surrender our vessel.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Spirit live in us like
[38:19] Mary did.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Mary had a changed life.
[38:28] Mary walked different.
[38:35] Verse six, it says, "And because ye are
[38:37] sons, God has sent forth his spirit of
[38:40] his son into our hearts crying out a
[38:43] father."
[38:45] Is that spirit in our hearts crying?
[38:50] Wherefore thou art no more servants but
[38:52] a son? And if his son then an heir of
[38:56] God through Christ, how about how abide
[38:59] then when ye knew not God? Ye did
[39:03] service unto them which by nature are no
[39:05] gods. But now after that ye have known
[39:09] God, or rather are known of God, how
[39:11] turn ye again to weak and beggarly
[39:14] elements,
[39:16] where unto you desire again to be in
[39:18] bondage.
[39:22] You observed days and months and times
[39:24] and years. I am afraid of you, lest I
[39:26] have bestowed upon you labor in vain.
[39:29] Brethren, I beseech you as
[39:33] beseech you, be as I am, for I am as ye
[39:37] are. Ye have not entered me
[39:40] at all.
[39:49] I'm going to skip some. I'm going to go
[39:51] down to verse 22. For it is written that
[39:54] Abraham had two sons,
[39:57] the one by the bond woman, the other by
[39:59] the free woman.
[40:02] But he who was of the bond woman was
[40:04] born after the flesh, but he of the free
[40:06] woman was born by the promise.
[40:14] So that is telling us if we live in the
[40:16] flesh,
[40:19] if we walk in the flesh, we are in
[40:21] bondage.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; But if we live by faith, Abraham is the
[40:29] father of faith.
[40:32] If we live in that spirit, we can be
[40:34] free.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; The free woman.
[40:40] Verse 25 it says, "And this Hagar is
[40:44] Mount Si in Arabia and answers to
[40:47] Jerusalem which is now and is in the
[40:50] bondage with her children.
[40:59] Who produces
[41:02] the most children?
[41:05] The children
[41:08] by the flesh
[41:11] are a lot more than the children by
[41:14] faith and the spirit.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; But Jerusalem which is above is free
[41:24] which is the mother of us all.
[41:31] But it is written, "Rejoice thou
[41:33] baroness that beareest not. Break forth
[41:37] the cry that thou trailest not, for the
[41:40] desolation has many more children than
[41:43] she which has a husband."
[41:45] Wow.
[41:51] Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the
[41:54] children of promise.
[41:57] But as then, he that was born after
[41:59] flesh persecuted him that is born after
[42:03] spirit, even so it is now.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; So we're not going to get away from that
[42:11] on this earth.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; If we live in the spirit and walk in the
[42:15] spirit, there's people going to be
[42:19] against us.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; And the sad part is sometimes it's even
[42:24] family members.
[42:27] But God told us we need to forsake all
[42:32] &gt;&gt; to follow him.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, what says the scripture,
[42:39] cast out the bond woman and her son? For
[42:43] the son of the bond woman shall not be
[42:45] heir with the son of the free woman.
[42:49] So there's the difference.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:52] So then, brethren, we are not children
[42:54] of the bond woman, but of the free.
[42:58] So we got a choice. We can either live
[43:00] in bondage
[43:04] or we can live
[43:06] free.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; In the spirit.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:20] So the next chapter says, "Stand fast
[43:23] therefore in the liberty wherewith
[43:24] Christ has made us free and be not
[43:26] entangled again in the yoke of bondage.
[43:34] It is very important to ask God for
[43:37] revelation and wisdom. A lot of people
[43:43] think and believe
[43:46] once they leave a religious system
[43:50] or come out of religion system now
[43:52] they're free to live however they want
[43:55] to
[43:56] and that's not the word of God.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; It says use not your liberty as an
[44:03] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[44:07] one another. Amen.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; That is in
[44:14] Galatians 5:13.
[44:18] So if we live in the spirit, we don't
[44:20] want to do anything that displeases God
[44:26] because God's spirit wants to do what
[44:30] the word says we're supposed to do.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:34] It says for in verse 14, all for all the
[44:37] law is fulfilled in one word. Even this,
[44:39] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[44:41] If ye buy and devour one another, take
[44:43] heed that ye be not consumed one of
[44:45] another. This I say then, walk in the
[44:48] spirit, and ye will not fulfill the lust
[44:51] of the flesh.
[44:53] I say that looks like a pretty safe
[44:56] place to walk.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; A very safe place to walk. says, "If we
[45:01] walk in his spirit, we will not fulfill
[45:04] the lust of the flesh."
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; And I don't need a rule book or a law to
[45:12] tell me not to go to the bar or anything
[45:15] like that or
[45:17] whatever.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; I don't need that. If I'm walking in the
[45:21] spirit, the spirit's got control of my
[45:24] life. Right? Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; We need to understand that if we truly
[45:29] are walking in the spirit,
[45:32] we're going to do what the Bible says.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; And the fruit that's going to be coming
[45:42] out of that life is in verse 23. But the
[45:45] fruit of the spirit is love,
[45:48] joy,
[45:49] peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[45:52] goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
[45:54] Against such there is no law.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Why? And it says, "And they that have
[46:01] crucified
[46:02] and they that are Christ have crucified
[46:05] the flesh with the affections affections
[46:08] and the lust. If we live in the spirit,
[46:10] let us also walk in the spirit. Let us
[46:13] not be desires of vain glory, provoking
[46:15] one another, envying one another." Yes,
[46:18] sir.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:24] It says in Christ Jesus, neither
[46:26] circumcision us anything nor
[46:28] uncircumcision, but a new creature.
[46:33] But a new creature.
[46:41] So, I'm going to turn back to
[46:44] Joshua.
[46:46] We talked about the children of Israel
[46:48] going into the land of Canaan.
[46:53] Didn't it say, doesn't the Bible say
[46:55] where milk and honey flows?
[47:02] &gt;&gt; If God gives us revelation,
[47:07] wisdom of his word, isn't that like milk
[47:10] and honey
[47:11] &gt;&gt; to our soul?
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:16] So God wants wanted them to take all the
[47:19] land to cast out all the enemies to kill
[47:22] the enemies, get rid of the enemies. So
[47:24] that's how what we need to do.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; We need to do the same thing.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; If we want to take the whole promise of
[47:32] God, the whole word of God, we got to
[47:34] get rid of the enemies that tried to
[47:36] destroy it.
[47:42] So there's something here in uh about
[47:45] Rahab.
[47:47] Well, I got to back up a little bit, but
[47:49] where the children is. So when they went
[47:52] to take Jericho, God told them to go
[47:55] around the city one time for six days,
[48:00] right?
[48:02] And then the Sabbath day, they were go
[48:04] around seven times and to blow their
[48:06] trumpets and stuff and
[48:10] take the city.
[48:12] But before that, they sent spies over
[48:15] and for somehow they ended up in Rahab's
[48:18] house, right? And her house was on the
[48:21] wall. I think this was a I don't know
[48:22] how big a city this was, but they had
[48:25] walls built up. I don't know how wide,
[48:27] how high, it doesn't matter, but big
[48:30] enough for a house to be built on that
[48:32] wall. And this is where Rahab lived. Was
[48:36] Rahab a good person?
[48:40] &gt;&gt; She wasn't.
[48:44] But she had something evidently in her
[48:47] that she believed. Yes, sir.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; She believed this messengers that came
[48:56] So she tied this red scarlet on by her
[49:01] window or somewhat.
[49:07] So what does that represent?
[49:13] I think that represents the token the
[49:15] Holy Spirit
[49:17] in our lives.
[49:21] So it says the seventh day the children
[49:25] walked around this city seven times they
[49:27] blew the trumpets and the walls and
[49:30] things came tumbling down
[49:34] &gt;&gt; they didn't need any bulldozers or
[49:36] sledes to bring the walls down. Right?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Why not? Because they obeyed God.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; And I think that's what we need to do in
[49:44] our life.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; We need to obey God. Obey his words and
[49:49] walls will tremble down.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Stones will be rolled away.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; And Rahab the harlot because she had
[50:02] that red scarlet tied by her house, she
[50:06] was saved because she believed.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; She believed
[50:12] and her father and mother, her family
[50:14] believed also. They were also saved. But
[50:17] the other people could have believed,
[50:19] but they didn't.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; They probably thought they're inside
[50:24] this big wall city, they're safe. And I
[50:28] think we can take that as a church or
[50:30] something like that, a good solid
[50:33] church. If we're inside this church,
[50:35] we're okay. But if we don't have Christ,
[50:38] if we don't have the token, we are not
[50:41] okay.
[50:47] So that really helps us to understand or
[50:50] it should it helps me to understand that
[50:53] Rahab was a harlot but because she
[50:56] believed she was saved she was spared.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; That's a blessing to me
[51:05] &gt;&gt; and her house.
[51:08] How many of us would like for all our
[51:10] family to be saved? I would
[51:15] &gt;&gt; I would and not just my family. I hope
[51:19] everybody can be safe.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[51:32] So, Rahab, the story of Rahab kind of
[51:35] takes me also back to when the children
[51:38] of Israel were when they uh put the
[51:41] blood over the doorpost. That was a sign
[51:45] that the people on the outside could see
[51:48] the blood. The angel could see the
[51:50] blood. It was a sign that the people on
[51:52] the inside of the house believed.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Where the blood wasn't applied, they
[51:58] didn't believe.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; So the power really wasn't in the blood,
[52:01] right? It was in believing. But that the
[52:04] blood was a sign.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Same way as the token is for us today.
[52:10] Praise the Lord.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; I think we live in a day
[52:18] the world might be falling apart,
[52:22] but God is not falling apart.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Our God is going to have a
[52:28] bride
[52:32] that he's going to take out of here
[52:34] someday.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; We don't know when.
[52:39] I think it's just as it was in the days
[52:41] of Noah. Noah was built in the ark. A
[52:44] lot of people could have helped and
[52:46] built the ark and could have gone in
[52:48] with him. The Bible says as it was in
[52:50] the days of Noah and in Lot, that's how
[52:53] it's going to be when the Son of Man
[52:57] &gt;&gt; is revealed.
[53:14] In Revelation chapter 2, it says, "He
[53:17] that has an ear," verse 7, Revelation
[53:21] 2:7, it says, "He that has an ear, let
[53:24] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[53:26] churches. To him that overcomemeth will
[53:29] I give to eat of the tree of life, which
[53:32] is in the midst of the garden, which is
[53:34] in the midst of paradise of God."
[53:42] So we have to overcome a lot of things.
[53:45] We have to cast out the bond woman and
[53:47] her son.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; The things in life that our flesh wants
[53:54] that we don't need.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; This religious spirit needs to be cast
[54:00] out.
[54:01] We need to overcome
[54:04] religious traditions and stuff. We need
[54:06] to cast them out.
[54:09] And if we do that,
[54:12] if we are overcomers by the grace of
[54:14] God, he will give us to eat of the tree
[54:17] of life which is in the midst of the
[54:19] paradise of God.
[54:27] It goes on down in verse 10. It says,
[54:29] "Fear none of those things which thou
[54:32] shalt suffer. Behold, the devil shall
[54:34] cast some of you into prison, that ye
[54:36] may be tried, and he and ye shall have
[54:39] tribulation 10 days. Be thou faithful
[54:43] unto death, and I will give thee the
[54:46] crown of life.
[54:49] Praise the Lord.
[54:55] If we go on to verse 17, it says, well,
[55:00] verse 16 says, "Repent, or else I will
[55:03] come unto thee quickly, and will fight
[55:04] against them with the sword of my mouth.
[55:08] He that has an ear, let him hear what
[55:11] the spirit saith unto the churches. To
[55:14] him that overcometh will I give to eat
[55:16] of the hidden mana."
[55:19] So, there is a hidden mana.
[55:22] and will give him a white stone, and in
[55:25] the stone a new name written, which no
[55:28] man knoweth, saving he that receiveth
[55:30] it.
[55:34] Isn't that exactly how it is
[55:38] with uh
[55:41] we can try to tell people the full
[55:43] gospel truth of our day, but if God
[55:47] doesn't open somebody's heart and mind,
[55:49] they cannot receive it.
[55:53] So it's by the grace of God that we can
[55:56] receive his truth.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; It says we he predestinated us before
[56:01] the foundation of the world.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[56:19] If we go in chapter 3 verse 20 of
[56:21] Revelation, it says, "Behold, I stand at
[56:23] the door and knock. If any man hear my
[56:27] voice and open the door, I will come
[56:29] into him."
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; "And will s with him and he with me."
[56:33] Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And here he says again, to him that
[56:36] overcometh
[56:38] will I grant to sit with me in my
[56:40] throne, even as also
[56:44] I also overcame and am sat down with my
[56:47] father in his throne. He that has an
[56:49] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[56:51] unto the churches.
[56:57] After Jesus resurrected,
[57:01] first he came to Mary Magdalene out of
[57:04] whom he had cast out seven devils.
[57:13] So I think today
[57:16] Jesus is coming to individuals.
[57:21] I don't think he's It seems to me It
[57:24] sounds to me like he's outside the
[57:27] church.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe not all churches,
[57:36] but a lot of churches see he's on the
[57:38] pushed on the outside.
[57:42] Why?
[57:45] Because people
[57:48] don't want to stay.
[57:50] with the true word of God.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; This is all we need.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; I believe in Jesus in the name of Jesus
[58:07] &gt;&gt; and I believe that's the only safe place
[58:10] to be.
[58:26] I'm going to go in Revelation chapter 10
[58:30] verse 7.
[58:32] It says, "But in the days of the voice
[58:34] of the seventh angel,
[58:37] when he shall begin to sound, the
[58:39] mystery of God should be finished,
[58:43] as he has declared to his servants the
[58:45] prophets."
[58:49] And I believe that.
[58:56] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[58:58] spake unto me again, and said, Go, and
[59:01] take the little book which is open in
[59:04] the hand of the angel, which standeth
[59:07] upon the sea
[59:09] and upon the earth. And I went unto the
[59:12] angel, and said unto him, Give me the
[59:14] little book.
[59:16] And he said unto me, take it and eat it
[59:19] up, and it shall make thy belly bitter,
[59:22] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[59:25] honey.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; And I took the little book out of the
[59:32] angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was
[59:35] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[59:37] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[59:42] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[59:45] again before many people, nations, and
[59:48] tongues, and kings."
[59:52] So I think he's talking to us.
[1:00:01] Take the little book. I don't think he's
[1:00:04] talking about
[1:00:07] this book.
[1:00:11] But we are to take go get all the
[1:00:15] revelation. Ask God to give us
[1:00:17] revelation
[1:00:20] and take it eat it. If God gives us a
[1:00:23] revelation, it is sweet as honey in our
[1:00:26] mouth. Right. Yes sir.
[1:00:29] But once it enters the belly means to
[1:00:32] live it, it is not so sweet.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; It means sometimes we get persecuted to
[1:00:41] live what we truly believe is right,
[1:00:45] what God gave us.
[1:00:47] And then it says, "Prophesy again to
[1:00:50] peoples, nation, tongues, and kings." So
[1:00:52] we are to speak the word, share the
[1:00:55] word.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because God's prophet left. So now
[1:00:59] he's looking to us to spread his word.
[1:01:03] We are his hands and his feet and his
[1:01:05] mouth.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; But sometimes it seems to be very
[1:01:11] discouraging
[1:01:13] how few people really want to hear the
[1:01:16] true word of God.
[1:01:21] But then we got to stop and think, how
[1:01:23] was it? How was it with me? Did I
[1:01:26] receive it the first time somebody tried
[1:01:29] to share the word of God? I remember
[1:01:32] people sharing to me. I wanted to do
[1:01:34] what was right.
[1:01:38] People sharing with me, I believe what
[1:01:40] they were saying, but I couldn't see it
[1:01:45] because I was spiritually blind. But by
[1:01:48] the grace of God,
[1:01:52] God opened my eyes that I could see.
[1:01:54] Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And I am seeking God today yet to open
[1:01:59] my heart and eyes more and more. I want
[1:02:03] more wisdom and more revelation from
[1:02:05] God.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; I want more living water.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Flowing through my life.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's what we need.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; We need the living water to refresh us,
[1:02:18] to encourage us, that we can stay
[1:02:21] faithful and trust him.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers, your
[1:02:35] attentiveness.
[1:02:39] Jesse told me I can preach as long as I
[1:02:41] want to.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; But he told me about how long he usually
[1:02:49] preaches and about how long the church
[1:02:51] will
[1:02:53] Whatever.
[1:02:56] So, I'm not a preacher.
[1:02:58] You would say long winded.
[1:03:03] Usually, when the glass is full of
[1:03:06] water, it just runs over, right?
[1:03:09] So, praise the Lord.
[1:03:12] Let's walk in his
[1:03:14] word.
[1:03:16] Let's receive the little book.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Let's receive all the truth he has. and
[1:03:21] let's surrender our lives.
[1:03:24] And brothers and sisters, I ask that you
[1:03:26] pray for me that I can live a life that
[1:03:28] is pleasing
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; to my savior.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And that I can truly get rid of all the
[1:03:37] religious, self-righteous
[1:03:40] things that I was walking in
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; and just believe the word, the true word
[1:03:45] of God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:50] Does Jesse does he do the prayer or do
[1:03:52] you do the prayer at the end? Okay, why
[1:03:55] don't we all stand up for prayer?
[1:04:01] Heavenly Father,
[1:04:03] thank you
[1:04:05] for your spirit.
[1:04:08] Thank you for your love. Thank you for
[1:04:10] the price you paid for our sins. Lord, I
[1:04:15] ask you just touch everyone's heart here
[1:04:18] today. Fill us with your word. Fill us
[1:04:21] with your spirit. And Lord, help us that
[1:04:24] we can be your hands and feet and mouth,
[1:04:27] Lord, to share your word. Help us to
[1:04:30] live your word, walk in it. Lord, we ask
[1:04:35] that you breathe with us, brother
[1:04:36] Chessie also and the church out
[1:04:38] Napoleon, the church at home. Bless them
[1:04:42] and we ask your blessings to flow.
[1:04:46] Thank you, Lord, that you brought us
[1:04:47] here safe. And Lord, we ask that you'd
[1:04:50] give us safe traveling home everybody
[1:04:52] and help us that we can walk in your
[1:04:55] footsteps this week also and weeks to
[1:04:59] come.
[1:05:00] We just pray this in
