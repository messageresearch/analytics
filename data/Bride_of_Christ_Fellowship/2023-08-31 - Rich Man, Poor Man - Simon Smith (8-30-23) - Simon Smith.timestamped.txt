[5:27] example of a Christian Spirit you know
[5:29] one willing to sacrifice and give what
[5:32] they can and do what they can for for
[5:34] others
[5:35] so I'd like to speak tonight by the
[5:38] grace of God on a topic
[5:42] called Rich Man Poor
[5:46] Man and my brother Paul is the the
[5:50] youngest of six and he's
[5:53] a uh he's a business major a finance
[5:57] major uh growing up and seeing the man
[6:01] that he's become has really impressed me
[6:03] he's very very I would call very
[6:06] successful in uh the the area he lives
[6:10] in uh his salary and and his mindset I
[6:15] watch him I I in a way I'm envious of
[6:18] the way he's built you know he's a he
[6:20] thinks bigger than you know most me
[6:24] I from a from the beginning you know I
[6:27] just always uh even when I was in
[6:29] college I I want to be a teacher
[6:31] and uh science teacher and then uh and
[6:35] then uh the Lord called me out of that
[6:37] and I just do Bible studies I teach the
[6:39] Bible and uh but I watch my younger
[6:42] brother and and I watch how he deals
[6:44] with finances I watch how he do does
[6:47] business and he told me he said he said
[6:50] brother he goes I listen to a book I
[6:53] read a book called a rich uh Rich Dad
[6:56] Poor Dad that's where I kind of got the
[6:58] inspiration of this uh uh uh study and
[7:01] in this book he the man I didn't read it
[7:03] but he just I'm just break this down
[7:04] from what Paul said he just showed me
[7:06] how the man was uh bringing kind of
[7:08] Parables and showing U the difference
[7:11] between as growing up as a son or maybe
[7:13] as a daughter I'll say like that growing
[7:15] up and being under a certain man okay
[7:19] brother Malachi is blessed to have a
[7:20] father uh many had the fathers here
[7:23] blessed by God's grace to have a man
[7:25] under uh uh you were under and has
[7:28] watched and have learned and how to be
[7:30] maybe a dad how however you say like
[7:32] that then um but as in the book it would
[7:35] probably go that a man would watch a
[7:38] young boy would watch how a father and
[7:39] he would deal with a poor father and a a
[7:42] father who was always poor and he he'd
[7:44] make this bad decision he'd make this
[7:46] bad decision he'd do this business deal
[7:48] wrong or he would always quit his jobs
[7:50] or this or that or however and the man
[7:53] uh and this young man would always and
[7:54] he grew up underneath a Poor Dad and
[7:57] then uh the other and another analogy
[8:00] another boy would grow up and he was
[8:03] under a manity he watched his father uh
[8:06] who had amassed all this wisdom in life
[8:09] and maybe he went to college and he
[8:11] studied hard and he learned about
[8:13] finances and he learned about uh
[8:15] equations and how the compound interest
[8:17] and and how to make business deals and
[8:19] how to do this and this and how that man
[8:21] would uh go and flip this house and go
[8:24] and uh uh do this and do that with the
[8:26] the the wisdom and the mind that God
[8:28] gave him in the board just watching and
[8:30] seeing and the example that this man
[8:33] this wise man would set before this boy
[8:35] would in turn show him what a rich dad
[8:37] would do what how in other words now
[8:40] that I'm a young man I can see and watch
[8:41] and learn from my father who's very very
[8:44] rich and and and and and I like this and
[8:47] a wise man a wise young man would go
[8:49] before his Rich Dad and and and and say
[8:52] Dad and and he would I I like I like
[8:54] this when I was young in apprenticeship
[8:56] I would go to my boss and say Chuck what
[8:59] about what would I do in this situation
[9:00] why because I wanted his wisdom I wanted
[9:03] his knowledge I wanted to understand how
[9:07] this worked I want to understand how a
[9:09] closed system heating would work a a
[9:11] closed heating system work how a closed
[9:13] plumbing system would work and how how
[9:15] an open system would work and what what
[9:17] is about this and what about that and I
[9:19] learned and I had to watch many times a
[9:21] very I was like this learning you have
[9:23] to be very
[9:24] patient because he's not going to let
[9:26] you take over a job right away he's not
[9:28] going to let you just jump right in and
[9:30] you're the man in charge you have to be
[9:32] very very the the the the eagerness the
[9:35] desire to become what someone much
[9:37] knowledgeable uh uh someone who has much
[9:40] experience takes time yes yes sir you
[9:43] have to make many many
[9:46] mistakes you might have to make a
[9:48] thousand mistakes to make that one most
[9:50] important decision right to make that
[9:52] decision the right decision there and
[9:54] that will just shoot you like a rocket
[9:56] into who knows what kind of spheres
[9:58] right
[10:00] right
[10:03] amen and dealing with this topic of a
[10:05] Rich Man Poor
[10:08] Man I I was thinking about this and I
[10:11] thought and many thoughts were coming to
[10:13] my M mind you know

[10:21] know this might be simple but I want you
[10:22] to apply this to your lives amen

[10:50] like David was was was playing the harp
[10:52] and the Holy Ghost was upon me he
[10:53] brought forth the words of God Amen

[10:58] said gotten a man from the Lord and
[11:00] never said that she was in prayer and in
[11:01] fasting or she was playing a harp she
[11:03] just spoke out but here we see a woman
[11:05] who is seeking the very face of God in
[11:07] the house of God Amen right and it said
[11:10] the Lord maketh poor and maketh
[11:14] rich and bringeth low and lifteth up

[17:37] to has anything to do with his outcome
[17:39] has nothing to do with his
[17:42] outcome it blew me
[17:46] away Rich Man Poor Man you know the
[17:49] Bible says in 1 Corinthians 9:22 he says
[17:51] to the weak became I weak and that I
[17:54] might gain the weak I and I'm and I I am
[17:57] made all things to all men that I might
[17:59] be by all means save some and this I do
[18:02] for the gospel sake that I might be
[18:04] partaker thereof with you know ye not
[18:07] that they which run in a race run all
[18:10] but one receiveth the prize so run that
[18:13] you may obtain amen saints of God we are
[18:16] we have heard the word we're all what
[18:18] every time every movement you are
[18:20] running for the kingdom absolutely
[18:22] Hallelujah sisters you have the greatest
[18:24] witness in this hour because what the
[18:26] hair and dress is a lightning torch I
[18:30] say that it is a torch among the world
[18:32] you just walk out there and I'm right
[18:34] now working on in in Bowling GRE State
[18:36] University and if you can imagine what
[18:40] these college girls what it is UN I'm
[18:42] just
[18:44] like I was in college but just but it's
[18:47] beyond now it's it's
[18:50] it's and you sisters walk like Queens of
[18:55] God Amen you walk like the Bride of of
[18:58] Christ
[19:00] Hallelujah if you I mean it it would it
[19:03] would
[19:03] be it's unreal he says and every man
[19:07] that striveth for the Mastery is temper
[19:09] in all things he says now they that do
[19:11] it obtain a corruptible Crown but we an
[19:13] Incorruptible Crown therefore so
[19:15] therefore so run not as uncertainly so
[19:18] fight I not as one that beateth the air
[19:21] in other words sints of God when we go
[19:22] into battle and we live life we just
[19:24] don't hope we just don't hope we're
[19:25] going to do this we don't have SS of God
[19:27] we have to have purpose we got to a
[19:28] motive and we've got to what have the
[19:30] ability what to yield of the Holy Ghost
[19:32] what so we can accomplish what he wants
[19:34] to accomplish through your lives
[19:36] amen and we know how and the only way
[19:38] anything's going to get done is but by
[19:40] the spirit of God absolutely sure amen
[19:44] and how does he say to do this he says
[19:46] but I keep under my body he says and
[19:48] bring it into subjection in other words
[19:50] don't let this worry you don't let don't
[19:53] if if there's desires there or however
[19:56] don't let this thing run out of control
[19:57] put it into subjection right you've got
[20:00] to keep this thing at
[20:02] Bay Physical Realm and spiritual realm
[20:05] amen now let's continue on here we see
[20:08] in Galatians 5 the Bible says that they
[20:11] they were Bewitched right the Bible says
[20:14] he says you did run well he says who did
[20:16] hinder you they should not obey the
[20:20] truth Rich Man Poor
[20:23] Man they started out wealthy I'll say
[20:26] this spiritually spiritually they had
[20:28] the truth of God but someone came in and
[20:33] started what planting seeds of
[20:35] discrepancy that's right therefore
[20:38] taking what the Bible talks about uh he
[20:41] says making he says this persuasion
[20:43] cometh not of him that cth un you a
[20:44] little leav leth the whole lump right
[20:49] now
[20:51] naturally it works the same way the
[20:53] natural is always a type of the
[20:55] spiritual if a man has a if a young man
[20:58] outside this brother Malachi's our young
[20:59] man outside of Zion here brother M's a
[21:01] young man he's watched his father he's
[21:02] watch he's he's he's playing the piano
[21:04] and he wants to make and he's he's got a
[21:06] level head on his shoulders he he's a
[21:08] servant of Christ he's got the Holy
[21:10] Ghost those sort of things that say that
[21:11] and and he like now he's waiting he say
[21:14] Lord God direct my footsteps Lord and he
[21:16] always puts the Lord before him why
[21:18] because he's watched his father do these
[21:20] things he's watched his father up here
[21:22] praying he's watched his father up
[21:23] preaching going overseas however uh
[21:25] doing making videos all those things and
[21:27] now in his mind he's Lord God I want to
[21:29] serve you just in the fervor as my
[21:31] father did right and he's going and if
[21:33] he's a good man he's a good good boy
[21:34] he's going to want to serve the Lord
[21:36] Jesus Christ right so now he's got to
[21:38] ask and say Lord God what would you have
[21:40] for my life what would you have me to do
[21:42] because I want to what Prosper your
[21:44] kingdom Lord amen amen
[21:47] amen and if he can do that in the
[21:49] spiritual I say this the Bible said what
[21:51] he said seeky first the kingdom of God
[21:53] first right and then all these things
[21:55] will be added unto you so if he can find
[21:57] his calling in life and and it's God L
[22:00] and it's spirit-led and all those sort
[22:02] of things God is going to add to him all
[22:03] these other things amen but we've got to
[22:06] find the leading of the Lord first amen
[22:08] what is he called to do oh on is he
[22:11] called to teach is he is he called to
[22:13] open a dojo is he called to open is he
[22:16] called to be a teacher is he called to
[22:18] to to just play piano what is he calling
[22:20] he's got to find this right and I
[22:23] believe if he seeks god with a sincere
[22:25] heart he will find it
[22:28] right and then once he finds and gets in
[22:30] the perfect will of God watch the things
[22:32] that God does on the side I on the back
[22:36] burner the Lord starts adding this and
[22:38] starts adding this and starts adding
[22:40] this and starts because what he's put
[22:42] the Lord first and he's faithful yes to
[22:45] whom is faithful with little will be
[22:47] faithful in much amen
[22:52] amen now let's continue on here I don't
[22:54] have much but we're going to we're going
[22:55] to run with it right now one of the
[22:58] Beautiful Things uh is is dealing with
[23:01] literally you have no Parton this we
[23:02] have no Parton this we're just born we
[23:04] just woke I mean my earliest days uh
[23:07] memories were like in Holgate and and
[23:09] probably like three or four maybe maybe
[23:12] five was my earliest memories but what
[23:15] was going on before then I I don't even
[23:16] remember what's going on I hear my mom
[23:18] tell stories I was angry at my brothers
[23:20] and my mom and all those sort of things
[23:22] I was you know I was born first and then
[23:24] boom Sam a camcom and then I'm just out
[23:26] with the dogs right just playing with
[23:27] the dogs it's probably why I love dogs
[23:29] so much cuz I had no one else to play
[23:31] with for the first two or three years
[23:33] just me the dog right oh brother s
[23:36] figured you out yeah that's that's it
[23:37] now he says now notice what it says here
[23:40] in Romans 9 he says what shall we say
[23:42] then is there unrighteousness with God
[23:44] God forbid and he's dealing with st St
[23:46] Paul's dealing with with Cain I'm sorry
[23:48] uh with Esau and Jacob and the Bible
[23:50] said he loved one and hated the other
[23:53] before they were even born that's right
[23:56] he says for he saith unto Moses he say
[23:58] I'll have com I'll have mercy on whom I
[24:00] have mercy says and I'll have compassion
[24:02] on whom I have compassion so then it's
[24:04] not of him that willth nor of him that
[24:06] runneth but of God that showeth Mercy
[24:09] amen amen if God has given you Mercy
[24:13] amen I would say that you are blessed
[24:17] from the foundation of the world to find
[24:20] the mercy of God Amen he's
[24:25] faithful that's a special place right
[24:27] there that's the place I want to be
[24:29] that's the place you want to be amen
[24:31] it's found in the mercy of God worthy of
[24:33] judgment and the Lord says
[24:35] no you can't touch my one child there
[24:39] amen can't touch my son you can't touch
[24:41] my daughter amen no
[24:43] sir amen
[24:46] now one another one pro I just like when
[24:48] I was studying this on the way here I
[24:50] was looking at the scripture I'm just
[24:51] like there's so much said about this and
[24:53] I I think the Book of Proverbs would be
[24:54] a spectacular book to read about this he
[24:56] says now a good day name is rather to be
[24:59] chosen than great
[25:01] riches you mean to be a Bill Gates or a
[25:05] Marcus
[25:06] Zuckerberg or one of those High UPS it's
[25:09] better to have a good name yes look at
[25:14] the mindset of this the wisest man he
[25:17] says I'd rather have a name like David
[25:20] beloved of the
[25:22] Lord or name like Solomon or name like
[25:27] Isaac after is better to have a good
[25:29] name than all the riches of the world
[25:33] amen amen amen look what you mothers and
[25:36] fathers can do to your child you can
[25:38] make them richer than the richest people
[25:41] on the Earth just by giving them a good
[25:44] name amen hallelujah well brother that's
[25:47] that's that that doesn't make any sense
[25:49] don't don't look with this don't think
[25:51] with this look at the word of God
[25:55] hallelujah amen amen
[25:59] you young sisters and but Malachi
[26:01] someday you'll get married Lord willing
[26:04] and you'll have that first baby and the
[26:07] greatest the greatest thing you can do
[26:10] says I name you Malachi
[26:14] Jr but I'll call you number
[26:16] [Laughter]
[26:18] two that would be a great you can
[26:21] literally set the destiny of his life
[26:24] from that point right there yes sir
[26:28] right the power what of your words
[26:31] making
[26:32] someone Rich that's right simple but
[26:36] absolutely impacts the rest of their
[26:38] days brother J you know you know how
[26:40] that works in our family right the name
[26:42] meant everything it'll make or break you
[26:47] that's right that's
[26:50] righten he says the good name is rather
[26:53] to be chosen in great riches and loving
[26:55] favor rather than silver and gold
[26:58] the rich and poor meet together the Lord
[27:02] is the maker of them all right
[27:06] right if you ever go down to
[27:10] Florida South
[27:13] Carolina you go on the coastline you see
[27:16] these big yachts and big nice houses and
[27:20] this and
[27:21] this just think to yourself they're
[27:23] going to have to meet the very God that
[27:25] you've accepted that's right
[27:30] amen and when you walk past those things
[27:32] pray for them that they would find the
[27:35] word of God that the Holy Ghost would
[27:37] deal with them because that's all
[27:39] they're going to have right is this big
[27:42] natural
[27:47] stuff Proverbs 23:4 says labor not to be
[27:51] rich cease from thine own
[27:55] wisdom so if someone is literally trying
[27:58] to become wealthy trying to acquire all
[28:01] the gold and silver make their bank
[28:03] account this and this get their
[28:04] retirement to hear this this if they're
[28:06] trying to do
[28:08] that that's their own wisdom why because
[28:12] our mindset is what following the holy
[28:15] ghost following God Lord because
[28:18] remember the Bible says
[28:22] well I literally had this quote on the
[28:25] way here and the prophet of God said he
[28:27] says he says I could never he says be a
[28:29] rich man he says because every time I
[28:32] see a poor person I'm always handing out
[28:34] money I'm always giving seeing these
[28:37] babies with no food or no clothes he say
[28:39] I'm always giving out he I just couldn't
[28:40] be rich he says because I give it all
[28:43] away
[28:44] amen labor not to be rich cease from
[28:47] thine own wisdom wilt thou set thine
[28:51] eyes upon that which is not for riches
[28:54] certainly make themselves Wings they fly
[28:56] away as an eagle toward
[29:00] Heaven that's right because what all the
[29:03] wealth of the world is
[29:05] God's it all goes right back to him we
[29:07] are just what stewards we're managers of
[29:09] what God gives
[29:11] us amen and that's what we're accounted
[29:14] that's how
[29:16] we this simple but we're just trying to
[29:19] do a little teaching
[29:21] tonight Proverbs 28:20 a faithful man
[29:25] shall abound with blessing
[29:28] but he that maketh haste to be rich
[29:30] shall not be
[29:33] innocent there's no G quick Rich
[29:40] schemes that's the truth and a I'll say
[29:43] like this a
[29:45] man just went to a certain kind of a
[29:47] party and he met certain rich men and
[29:50] the man knows he's rich man he says he
[29:53] says he told me he said he said Simon he
[29:57] said said I've never met an honest
[30:01] millionaire wow they always have to EAS
[30:05] that's just how they do
[30:06] it that's how why because they're trying
[30:09] to make haste to become rich yeah
[30:13] right now
[30:15] notice in Proverbs
[30:20] 10:3 I'll start at verse two Treasures
[30:23] of wickedness profit nothing but the
[30:25] righteous deliver from Death the Lord
[30:27] will will not suffer the soul of the
[30:28] righteous to famine he says but he
[30:30] casteth away the substance of the wicked
[30:33] he becometh poor that deal with a slack
[30:36] hand but the hand of the diligent maketh
[30:39] rich now over times let's say brother
[30:42] Malai says say Dad I'm feeling like
[30:44] business I want to go into the real
[30:46] estate and he starts just boom the Lord
[30:49] blessed him start getting the house here
[30:50] he flips it or sells it however makes
[30:52] profit profet and he just then he starts
[30:54] I'm not going residential I'm going
[30:55] commercial real estate he starts selling
[30:57] million dollar this million dollar this
[30:59] this he just the commission start coming
[31:01] in but if he keeps his hand on that and
[31:04] he keeps working that system he keeps
[31:05] working working working eventually he
[31:07] will acquire that but of course we know
[31:10] his whole mind will be on Christ at
[31:13] doing that right he'll remember the
[31:16] fatherless he'll remember the widows and
[31:19] he will behind the scenes he will do in
[31:22] secret now remember who was the Gentile
[31:24] that got visited
[31:26] first
[31:29] the uh Italian band right Cornelius
[31:32] right and the angel of God come to him
[31:35] and said he says he says Thou Art I'm
[31:37] just paraphrase he says Thou Art a
[31:39] faithful man he says you have given alms
[31:42] to the poor in secret I'm just
[31:44] paraphrasing he said God blessed him
[31:46] with an angel visitation because he's
[31:48] been so faithful so on fire for God and
[31:50] he's done so much for so many
[31:53] people that God said it's time now you
[31:55] receive salvation CU he was faithful
[31:58] what God gave him amen amen he says he
[32:01] that he that becometh poor deal with a
[32:04] slack hand but the hand of the D becomes
[32:05] rich I'll say it like this same with the
[32:08] spiritual right
[32:14] yes that's why we have to what pray and
[32:18] read the word of
[32:19] God because this this book right
[32:23] here will make you rich amen my
[32:27] sister-in-law sometimes my sister sorry
[32:31] oh yeah my sister-in-law and my wife
[32:34] they will get together and they'll just
[32:35] watch a little video here and there
[32:36] right and there's one called the
[32:39] badier wait no no Lumber the lumber
[32:42] Baron they watch this Lumber Barry mov
[32:44] right and the story goes is that this
[32:49] man who had this big business the secret
[32:51] to his business all of the wealth of his
[32:53] business was hidden in the badier which
[32:55] is one of these little things on the
[32:56] side of the house goes up and it's like
[32:57] a little secret place right up in the
[32:58] attic or however it was and as The Story
[33:01] Goes and all those sort of things
[33:03] somebody hears about the big riches that
[33:05] are up in this thing and they try and
[33:06] break in and steal it they try and
[33:07] they're foiled they try and break in and
[33:08] steal it this this they poison the
[33:10] husband he dies and all this all this
[33:12] nonsense
[33:13] right but the sun goes up in the the
[33:17] badier and he doesn't find anything but
[33:19] he finds a little book and the business
[33:22] starts failing because the father's dies
[33:24] and the the son's like I'm going to make
[33:26] this business great again and he gets
[33:27] into this book and it shows him how he
[33:31] made all these deals and how to how to
[33:33] work this number and how to work this
[33:34] and this and that as the story would end
[33:37] is the that riches that that L the
[33:39] family lore that they had there all this
[33:41] riches up in that thing was literally
[33:43] the the mystery was it was in that book
[33:45] how to make money how to make a business
[33:49] run properly was all in that book and
[33:52] saints of
[33:53] God we were given the book to Supreme
[33:57] riches amen right here right this is
[34:01] what we've been given but we've got to
[34:04] have a diligent hand right amen now
[34:06] let's continue on here in 2 Samuel 12:1
[34:10] he says and the Lord sent Nath Nathan
[34:13] unto David and he came unto him and said
[34:15] unto him there were two men in one city
[34:17] one rich and one
[34:19] poor think about the saints of God here
[34:22] was a rich man who is a seed of God
[34:27] anointed rich man and here was a poor
[34:30] man seed of God and still anointed as
[34:33] well he was so
[34:36] anointed that when this man would go
[34:38] under the armies and he would he was but
[34:40] he was under one of the Valiant men of
[34:42] David right top 30 right he would go in
[34:44] there Uriah would fight and this and
[34:46] this he would he had Victory after
[34:47] Victory and he was a warrior and he was
[34:49] a seed of God and David had even greater
[34:54] victories than
[34:55] Uriah right right David more anointed
[34:58] thisiss greater
[35:01] victories and at one time they were both
[35:04] poor right
[35:07] right and God elevated one so much so
[35:11] that he became
[35:13] Rich where did David make a mistake
[35:15] before he became
[35:18] Rich you don't see him do those sort of
[35:21] things right but once he acquired the
[35:25] natural sub
[35:28] how many wives how much uh gold and
[35:31] silver the kingdom all those sort of
[35:33] things once he waxed the
[35:36] rich
[35:37] right something happened to him good
[35:41] good brother but the poor man was
[35:43] faithful because he was depending on God
[35:46] Alone amen he had nothing he all he put
[35:49] his life on the line every day there was
[35:51] no luxury for them he was such a man of
[35:54] God that when the king says come over
[35:55] here he says he says come and drink with
[35:57] me he said then go go home there lay
[35:59] with your wife he said he say my men he
[36:01] says are in the field he said they're
[36:03] dying David they're they're waiting for
[36:05] me they're waiting for one of their
[36:06] captains to get back and lead the
[36:08] charge and he would not take luxury he
[36:12] rejected a Leisure
[36:16] Time and here David in his leisure time
[36:20] in his Leo to I like this that was his
[36:23] Leo toan moment he fell right and he
[36:28] sacrificed the poor
[36:30] man and took what he
[36:32] had good the deceitfulness of riches the
[36:36] Bible said that was the fourth
[36:39] ground what does it say let's look at
[36:43] this he said he that receiveth the seed
[36:45] among the Thorns is he that heareth the
[36:47] word and and the cares of the world
[36:50] anybody go see David over in uh uh
[36:53] Pennsylvania you see David get the
[36:54] throne he's like King down he goes hey
[36:57] some and so's attacking come on
[36:59] guys right he comes back with the King's
[37:01] throne he's like yep that's this one go
[37:04] this one he gets on his throne and how
[37:05] they dramatizes he sit on the throne hey
[37:07] someone's attacking that goes out
[37:09] again he comes back kills another king
[37:11] and puts that crown on top of that crown
[37:13] and it goes on and on and shows how he
[37:15] 10 20 times and by the last time he's
[37:17] just
[37:19] like another
[37:22] Crown he was so Victorious God had
[37:25] blessed him so much right that it didn't
[37:28] mean as much to him yeah
[37:32] right and you see the time before he
[37:35] fell and he says the haveit are upon you
[37:38] David he's like guys go take care of it
[37:41] and he starts drinking his wine he got
[37:43] drunk right and in that time is when he
[37:50] fell the car of this world and the
[37:53] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[37:55] and becometh un
[37:58] fruitful now notice
[38:01] this I want to read this quote
[38:05] here he says when you women begin to
[38:08] want and I'm not bless no you're going
[38:09] to see what this goes he says want to
[38:11] begin like the rest of the woman there
[38:12] is something wrong when you men you
[38:14] ministers try to become like a pattern
[38:18] after somebody
[38:20] else when you business businessmen try
[38:22] to do business on the scale that
[38:24] somebody else would do it on because
[38:26] they're prosperous Prosperity doesn't
[38:29] always represent success in Christ right
[38:31] yeah sometimes very much the contrary
[38:35] see right now Pride he got lifted up
[38:38] you're talking about
[38:40] Uzziah what a great fellow I am oh I got
[38:42] lifted up you got all this he says I'll
[38:44] try to take a place in the ministers so
[38:46] here is a king trying to take place of a
[38:47] priest and now the prophet of God is
[38:49] dealing with what
[38:51] businessmen he says now as I said before
[38:53] again he says businessmen businessmen
[38:55] are not preachers
[38:57] we preachers have enough time to try to
[38:59] keep this thing straight let alone
[39:02] businessmen you're all businessmen not
[39:04] ministers and don't take the place of
[39:06] one or try to because you're not called
[39:08] for
[39:11] such I've heard rumors here that some
[39:15] businessmen actually persuade their
[39:17] pastor and push this and push that due
[39:19] to the amount of ties they go on and
[39:22] they do this and that and
[39:23] however right
[39:29] and I want to say I want to tell this
[39:31] next story here I was talking to someone
[39:36] and this is one of the moments where I
[39:37] literally saw the Fulfillment I could
[39:39] literally
[39:41] feel what Christ saw when he was
[39:44] bringing this
[39:46] Parable I was talking to someone and I
[39:49] told them to do a certain
[39:54] thing because I was going to do a
[39:55] certain thing
[39:57] first I come to the
[40:04] place and what I told the person to
[40:07] do they did not do
[40:11] it but in the miid of me coming there
[40:14] and I'm like what are you
[40:17] doing the person
[40:20] said well I just prayed for such and
[40:23] such and the testimony just happened
[40:28] and at that moment the testimony me
[40:34] nothing and as I I yelled at the person
[40:37] I said why did you do
[40:44] this and they said well look and the
[40:46] guys and the guy the other guy they were
[40:48] talking to said yeah but they prayed and
[40:50] this
[40:51] happened and literally my mind was back
[40:54] in Matthew 7 Lord Lord have we not
[40:59] prophesied in thy name cast out Devils
[41:02] done many wonderful
[41:05] works but the Bible called them workers
[41:09] of iniquity
[41:12] right and at that moment I could
[41:15] understand why Christ will reject
[41:18] some and not others yeah it's not about
[41:23] testimonies though they are good it's
[41:25] not about healings though they are good
[41:28] right Mark 16 and Matthew 7 literally
[41:32] the same kind of people doing the same
[41:35] signs wonders and
[41:36] miracles but the difference was one
[41:39] obeyed the word obeyed the commandment
[41:41] and the other one did not amen saints of
[41:45] God that was terrifying I stood there
[41:46] and I'm like now I know how God feels I
[41:50] literally know
[41:52] how they L
[41:54] said brother
[41:57] they just prayed and this happened
[41:59] Supernatural
[42:00] like I said they did not
[42:03] listen I just totally just
[42:06] went and I'm thinking Lord God have
[42:14] mercy it was a scary time it was
[42:16] literally I was just literally just
[42:18] going this is what it's going to be
[42:21] like the
[42:23] lack Saul when King Saul Samuel shows up
[42:27] Samuel says have you obeyed the word of
[42:28] the Lord he says I have obeyed the word
[42:31] of
[42:32] God and Samuel says well what are these
[42:34] sheep bleeding in my ears
[42:37] right thinking they did what God told
[42:40] them to do and did not do it that's
[42:44] right remember the prophet of God he
[42:46] said he says it doesn't matter your your
[42:48] fastings your prayers or this he says
[42:50] the bride will be in the word all the
[42:53] way y than
[42:57] God if you don't see the signs Wonder
[42:59] Miracles like you like pray for them but
[43:01] just be obedient to the word of the Lord
[43:06] amen obedience is what God wants he
[43:10] wants I'll say like
[43:13] this well me and brother Jesse the only
[43:15] husband's here
[43:17] so I like it when I go home I tell I
[43:20] said babe can you do this and this and
[43:23] this and she's like okay and when she
[43:26] does it I'm just like that's
[43:29] right I'm like I got
[43:33] power why because she was obedient now
[43:36] do I ask her to go lift 300 lb barbells
[43:39] and move uh railroad ties
[43:42] no I said hey did you water the plants
[43:45] our two tomato
[43:46] plants and then she said no I said hey
[43:48] can you water them okay she'll grab her
[43:50] yellow booket bucket and just go and
[43:52] then
[43:54] outside but the C OB obedience and we
[43:57] see a willing heart amen
[44:02] amen you know sometimes does God call
[44:05] you to go out in the jungles and
[44:08] uh and save the Heathen the cannibals
[44:11] and all those sort of things has anyone
[44:13] got that call in this church at
[44:16] all sister
[44:20] lady I'm going to anoint a man to marry
[44:23] you and he's going to be a missionary
[44:26] the
[44:29] Amazon hopefully not but if the Lord
[44:34] would anoint that to
[44:36] happen back up and go and you will be
[44:40] more safe in the will of God through
[44:44] obedience right then you would be safe
[44:47] staying right here in akan Ohio right
[44:51] brother her and her husband could say
[44:54] hey uh her husband say Hey Dad called
[44:57] Jess Dad hey can me and me and Lydia
[45:00] live in a tiny house in the backyard
[45:01] Jess is like sure absolutely but if he's
[45:03] got a call in his heart to go to the
[45:06] Amazon they had better go yeah right
[45:09] there'll be more danger living in a tiny
[45:11] house in your backyard and they would be
[45:13] right in the midst of the
[45:14] cannibal
[45:16] Community
[45:17] right I'm not prophesying just just give
[45:21] an example
[45:23] now I keep thinking rich
[45:26] Man Poor
[45:27] Man and here's where I got the
[45:29] inspiration for this in Amos
[45:31] 84 Amos 84 and saints of God I want to
[45:37] emphasize this heavy and especially
[45:41] for and when I think of this I think of
[45:43] myself and I want to be better as a
[45:47] teacher of the word of God Amos 8:4 hear
[45:52] this oh ye that swallow up the needy
[45:55] even to make the poor of the land to
[45:58] fail now I want you to think on this
[46:02] spiritually saying when will the new
[46:04] moon be gone that we may sell corn so
[46:07] notice these business owners these
[46:09] people who have the corn or the meal I
[46:11] say this and what does the meal or the
[46:13] corn represent Jesus
[46:15] Christ and the Sabbath and we set forth
[46:18] wheat making the epha small so this
[46:23] little basket they're going to measure
[46:25] this weats in transaction for money
[46:28] they're going to make this basket this
[46:29] amount they're going to get and they're
[46:30] going to make it just a little bit
[46:32] smaller so the people get less than they
[46:35] think they're getting they think they're
[46:37] getting an equal trade they think
[46:40] they're getting all their money worth
[46:45] right but what else do they do and the
[46:48] shekele great it was a weight and
[46:53] measure and falsifying the balance es by
[46:56] deceit so notice these guys right here
[46:58] now think about
[47:01] spiritually what they're going to lessen
[47:03] what you
[47:04] get not only it's be one thing if they
[47:07] had the right weight and still tricked
[47:10] you but they're going to give you a
[47:12] weight that's even I like this
[47:15] heavier so that you're going to get less
[47:18] and you're going to have to give more
[47:19] for
[47:21] it sounds like
[47:24] inflation oh yeah that's exactly
[47:27] right but if you think about this
[47:29] spiritually and this is where the danger
[47:32] that
[47:33] ministers and I'll say this all
[47:35] Christians have yes their
[47:38] battle is will we bring all that God
[47:43] there's how many sermons 1,200 1300
[47:46] sermons
[47:48] maybe we want to look at if we teach on
[47:50] a topic we want to look at every quote I
[47:53] want to find every scripture I can on
[47:55] the C to certain topic and I want to
[47:58] teach it the very best give the angle
[48:00] here and according to the ability that
[48:02] God has given each person they want to
[48:05] teach it and preach it in such a way
[48:07] that they can say step back from the
[48:08] altar from the the the desk there and
[48:11] say I've taught it the very best I can
[48:13] see it amen amen but I wonder if we SS
[48:18] of God then that's why the
[48:20] Le is supposed to have the nine
[48:22] spiritual gifts in operation to what to
[48:25] keep the church clean to keep this thing
[48:26] clean so that they can go and listen to
[48:30] a c whoever gets behind here or if you
[48:32] go out to another special meeting or
[48:33] this or however to a camp however is
[48:36] this Minister telling the full story
[48:39] that's
[48:41] right I think it was a couple maybe a
[48:43] year ago or however I I I heard often
[48:47] times sometimes ministers say he's they
[48:49] say the prophet said he says what he
[48:51] says I've seen nothing but the coming of
[48:53] the Lord so literally said they're
[48:54] telling people there's nothing to go
[48:56] through just the coming of the Lord's
[48:58] going to come and they're going to be
[48:58] raptured and that's
[49:00] it the prophet said I have seen nothing
[49:02] but the coming Lord SS of God and I
[49:03] found the quote after that he said he
[49:05] say the Lord did not say this but I
[49:07] don't see anything else but he said the
[49:09] Lord did not say this amen good but if
[49:13] you study all the quotes a brother just
[49:15] sent me a text a quote and it said that
[49:18] the church will go through Great
[49:19] Tribulation not tribulation but great
[49:22] persecution at the time of the the mark
[49:26] of the
[49:28] beast we have to be ready look at every
[49:32] quote and what does the Holy Ghost want
[49:33] us to grab from
[49:35] these
[49:38] amen he said that we might buy the poor
[49:41] for silver and the needy for a pair of
[49:42] shoes yay and we sell The Refuge of the
[49:46] wheat they're going to come and they're
[49:48] going to preach behind the pulpit and
[49:50] the people are going to go out thinking
[49:51] they heard the word of God and yet
[49:53] they've been stolen here and stolen here
[49:54] right thinking they're getting rich when
[49:56] they're getting poor right that's right
[50:06] good
[50:11] that's he says making the EPA small this
[50:14] is Gil he says a dry measurement that
[50:17] held three uh scabs and about the bush
[50:20] of ours with which they measured their
[50:22] grain and their wheat so that besides
[50:23] the exorbitant price they re ired they
[50:26] did not give due measure they did not
[50:29] tell them everything they could possibly
[50:31] tell them and of course the great
[50:33] shekele or making the shekele great he
[50:36] says this was made a little heavier than
[50:38] it should be and so of course the money
[50:40] weighed again it was too light and the
[50:43] poor were obligated to make up with more
[50:45] and thus they cheated them both in
[50:47] measure and in their
[50:51] money but notice there's two of them
[50:55] there's two things
[50:57] here the epha and the shackle there's
[51:00] the there's the food there's the food
[51:03] and there's the
[51:07] money and if you look at the bottom of
[51:09] this as he goes on in Amos 8 it says he
[51:13] says and it shall come to pass in that
[51:16] day that the Lord God that I will cause
[51:18] the sun to go down at noon and will
[51:20] darken the Earth in a clear day and I'll
[51:22] turn your feast in the morning and all
[51:24] your songs and Lamentations I bring a
[51:25] sackcloth upon the loins and baldness
[51:27] upon every head and I'll make it as the
[51:29] morning of an only son and the end
[51:31] thereof is a bitter day and behold the
[51:32] days come say the Lord that I will send
[51:34] a famine in the land there's coming a
[51:37] Time saints of God where the word of God
[51:39] will not they'll be looking for the
[51:42] truth that's right I wonder if it's even
[51:45] in the message of the hour they'll be
[51:47] looking for the truth yes sir
[51:52] right here the prophet God said he says
[51:55] he said God cannot mix hybrid religion
[51:59] with himself he can't reproduce the Holy
[52:02] Ghost cannot reproduce himself with
[52:04] hybrid Doctrine a hybrid religion right
[52:09] amen so that's why that's why we in
[52:11] other words that's why we have to
[52:12] receive the Holy Ghost is because the
[52:14] Holy Ghost will lead and guide you into
[52:16] all truth amen so if there's something
[52:19] false if the if the leav had been waxed
[52:22] great and there's leaven put in this
[52:23] meal the Holy Ghost is going to pin
[52:25] point every false Doctrine he's going to
[52:27] get this out when he came the first time
[52:29] he Sanctified and when he comes the
[52:31] second time we will be Sanctified amen
[52:34] absolutely all faults will be made right
[52:37] what will get all that LE out and you
[52:39] will have the original pure seed word
[52:42] amen
[52:45] amen amen yes he says they he says
[52:49] behold the day comes well send a famine
[52:50] to land not Famine of bread nor of
[52:52] thirst for water but of the hearing of
[52:54] the words of the Lord of thus sayeth the
[52:57] Lord amen
[53:00] amen
[53:02] now now here's what the the scripture
[53:04] says literally he says Thou shalt not
[53:06] have in thy bag divers weights a great
[53:09] and a small so depending what well lets
[53:12] way up and the man goes who he's got two
[53:14] in there and he grabs the heavy one if
[53:16] he wants to make a little B more on this
[53:18] deal but if it was one of his friends he
[53:20] grabs the right one the smaller one and
[53:21] makes just an even
[53:24] deal
[53:26] he said Thou shalt not have in thine
[53:28] house divers measures a great and a
[53:30] small notice making the the epha small
[53:34] however but Thou shalt have a perfect
[53:37] and just we a perfect and just measure
[53:40] shalt thou have the Lord thy God may be
[53:42] lengthened in the land which the Lord
[53:44] hath given thee for all that do such
[53:46] things and all that do unrighteously are
[53:48] an Abomination to the Lord thy God what
[53:50] is
[53:52] nanism what is the first four seals
[53:54] reveal the Antichrist spirit in the
[53:57] church
[53:58] right yes sir if that spirit is present
[54:02] with any in any assembly there is
[54:05] somewhere the the the scales are off yes
[54:09] yes sir these people overseas you know
[54:12] what they're doing they're they're
[54:13] asking me constantly but Simon please
[54:16] send we're waiting on you I said you
[54:18] need to start waiting on God that's
[54:20] right amen amen me I asked for help I
[54:24] asked I when I need something I ask the
[54:26] Lord Jesus Christ and I wait and he
[54:29] always e sometimes he doesn't answer
[54:31] because maybe I don't need it but when
[54:33] he answers I know it because he gives
[54:36] you exactly what you asked for am amen
[54:46] now I just heard a
[54:51] testimony and
[54:53] this couple
[54:55] left a certain
[54:59] church and they sat in this church for a
[55:03] while in the they would have evangelist
[55:08] after evangelist and
[55:10] evangelist all evangelists for years and
[55:13] years and years that's all they brought
[55:14] in and the person said brother Simon I
[55:18] just live streamed another church he
[55:20] said I learned more in 30 minutes than I
[55:23] did in three years
[55:25] that's right why because there's a false
[55:28] balance in that church that's right
[55:31] brother right what is the true balance
[55:34] in a local
[55:36] assembly and he gave some Apostles and
[55:40] he gave some prophets and some
[55:42] evangelists and some pastors and
[55:45] teachers this is the true balance you
[55:49] got to have all five there for what AB
[55:51] balance for what the perfecting of the
[55:54] Saints amen
[55:55] if you're not feating this line throw if
[55:58] you're not having the vangel the pastor
[56:00] not the pastor but the the the Apostle
[56:02] all those all those four running through
[56:04] here you're not going to have a balanced
[56:08] diet that's right and that and that that
[56:11] man
[56:12] left because he was not getting
[56:20] fed for the perfecting of the Saints and
[56:22] for the work of the ministry in other
[56:25] words every service they're trying to
[56:26] get the
[56:30] people and yet they don't know one thing
[56:32] about Doctrine that's right brother they
[56:35] can't prove one one Doctrine thing with
[56:37] the quotes or and bring it to the
[56:39] scripture that's right they can't bring
[56:41] their quotes to the scripture yes sir
[56:44] they don't know the Bible is the
[56:45] absolute that's right he says for the
[56:47] proect perfecting of the Saints for the
[56:48] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[56:50] the body of Christ till we all come in
[56:53] the unity of Faith so all five these are
[56:55] needed for the unity of the faith
[56:59] amen why because there's some things the
[57:02] pastor is going to preach and teach that
[57:04] no one else is ever going to touch and
[57:05] the Evangelist is going to come out and
[57:07] what is what does the true word born
[57:09] evang evangelist do come and set you on
[57:11] fire you feel convicted you get up to
[57:13] the altar you start praying and say Lord
[57:15] God forgive me of all my sins get me get
[57:17] all get the Devils off me amen and then
[57:19] say Lord I'm going to win souls I'm
[57:21] going to win souls and fire you up
[57:22] that's
[57:23] right and then boom he's on the
[57:28] road might have the Apostle come in tell
[57:31] you all what God's doing overseas here
[57:33] and how this church started how this
[57:35] church and the testimonies this boy's
[57:36] raised and this hand grew back and all
[57:39] just why because we need to hear those
[57:41] things amen we need to hear what God is
[57:44] doing on every front of his campaign
[57:47] Hallelujah in this war there's all kinds
[57:50] of generals not generals soldiers
[57:53] there's all kind of
[57:55] soldiers out there right and each one
[57:58] has a commission each one has a
[58:00] testimony each one has their way I think
[58:02] their office amen amen and here's a
[58:07] pastor stays right here and just plugs
[58:09] away and plugs away and feeds the flock
[58:12] feeds the Lambs feeds the
[58:15] Sheep amen and what for he he says from
[58:19] whom the whole body fitly joined
[58:21] together I'll say like this now why do
[58:22] we need the fivefold till we all come to
[58:25] Unity Faith right that we hence for be
[58:27] no more children tossed to and fro and
[58:31] carried about with every window in other
[58:33] words without the fivefold you're not
[58:35] going to know what doctr is true what's
[58:36] not because no one's going to teach it
[58:37] to you that's right one time we had
[58:39] evangelist come out and he read a
[58:41] scripture and he's
[58:43] like he's like wait it was like a punch
[58:45] line for him and we're just like we're
[58:46] sitting there we're
[58:48] going uh explain it what you what are
[58:50] you trying to get
[58:51] to and he's and he read it again he's
[58:53] like don't you guys I see it and we're
[58:56] like
[58:58] no and it was a silent moment for
[59:00] him why because he's not called to
[59:04] teach he's called there what to
[59:07] evangelize and I was just going okay
[59:10] don't leave the teaching for other
[59:12] people CU and he couldn't even explain
[59:14] it he didn't explain it and I'm like
[59:17] okay well okay well then then he went
[59:19] back to evangelizing well okay that's
[59:21] what we
[59:22] needed so I had to talk with the go
[59:24] Pastor like where was he going I was
[59:25] like I'm not sure where he was going
[59:26] okay am on
[59:28] now let's continue on
[59:32] here what do we got here we're almost to
[59:35] an hour so let me let me jump
[59:39] here in Matthew
[59:45] 13:34 Matthew 13:34 says all these
[59:49] things spake Jesus unto the multitude in
[59:51] Parables and without a parable he spake
[59:54] not unto them them you know this is
[59:56] right in the midst there of
[59:58] the right after the seven parables in
[1:00:00] Matthew 13 that it might be fulfilled
[1:00:02] which was spoken by a prophet saying I
[1:00:03] will open my mouth and Parables I will
[1:00:05] utter things which I kept secret from
[1:00:07] the foundations of the
[1:00:09] world now why did Jesus do this why did
[1:00:12] he bring forth those Parables Pastor
[1:00:13] Jesse's got an entire book on this why
[1:00:16] did he bring forth these
[1:00:18] Parables because if you turn to Psalms
[1:00:21] 49:1 yes and to the chief musician of
[1:00:24] Psalm of the song sons of Kora hear this
[1:00:28] all ye people in other words he that
[1:00:31] hath ears yeah amen give ear all ye
[1:00:34] inhabitants of the world notice to the
[1:00:37] world that's not to Jew Jews that's to
[1:00:40] Gentiles amen the mysteries in
[1:00:44] Revelations 13 were what I'm sorry
[1:00:46] Matthew 13 were to the Gentiles amen
[1:00:50] amen both
[1:00:52] high low and high rich and poor together
[1:00:56] my mouth shall speak of wisdom and
[1:00:59] meditation of my heart shall be of
[1:01:02] understanding amen why would now notice
[1:01:04] he says I will incline my ear to a
[1:01:06] parable I will open my dark saying upon
[1:01:10] the harp so all these Parables what was
[1:01:13] Christ bringing Matthew 13 was literally
[1:01:16] a prophecy fulfilled what of David
[1:01:18] playing his
[1:01:20] harp and he said this is
[1:01:22] it within the like this when David
[1:01:25] played his heart and he said what he
[1:01:27] says I will incline my ear to Parable to
[1:01:30] a parable I will open my dark saying
[1:01:32] when he Sayang that within that
[1:01:35] scripture is seven Mysteries amen that's
[1:01:38] right this contains seven Mysteries that
[1:01:42] were opened up in the new
[1:01:45] amen and it all become what getting in
[1:01:47] the spirit playing on the harp that's
[1:01:52] right he says where therefore should I
[1:01:55] fear in the days of evil when the
[1:01:56] iniquity of my heels shall Compass upon
[1:01:58] me that they trust in their wealth and
[1:02:01] boast themselves in the multitudes of
[1:02:03] their riches none of them can by any
[1:02:05] means redeem his brother nor give to God
[1:02:07] a ransom for him for the Redemption of
[1:02:09] their soul is
[1:02:12] precious what's precious what's more
[1:02:15] precious than anything the Redemption of
[1:02:17] the Soul when Jesus when the baby was
[1:02:23] born he he says little baby Jesus grew
[1:02:26] up into a young boy say hey I've got
[1:02:28] this gold frankincense and myrr I'm
[1:02:30] going to redeem my people I got the gold
[1:02:34] that's right he didn't say that in other
[1:02:36] words for the Redemption what was the
[1:02:38] most did did Jesus come with a a full
[1:02:40] inheritance of of of of all the the
[1:02:44] silver and gold and the crows and jewels
[1:02:46] and all that were those decks around him
[1:02:48] from the day one no God sent the most
[1:02:50] precious thing was what
[1:02:53] himself
[1:02:56] right silver and gold cannot redeem
[1:03:00] us hallelujah it was the blood of
[1:03:03] almighty God the very vessel of Jesus is
[1:03:06] what redeemed us that was what purchased
[1:03:09] our souls it's not carnal
[1:03:12] anything right he says for the
[1:03:15] Redemption of your soul is precious and
[1:03:17] it ceaseth
[1:03:19] forever the Redemption of our
[1:03:23] souls

[1:07:47] one of his amen yes now let's continue
[1:07:50] let's finish this off here by God's
[1:07:52] now
[1:07:54] Ian Revelations 3:17 we know this he
[1:07:58] says because thou sayest I am re Rich
[1:08:00] increased with goods and I've need of
[1:08:01] nothing and knowest not that thou are
[1:08:03] wretched miserable poor blind
[1:08:05] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:08:10] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:08:12] rich good good now I rattle off the
[1:08:16] Mysteries the
[1:08:18] revelations but that's not the real gold
[1:08:21] now those are those are beautiful that's
[1:08:22] riches sure The unsearchable Riches of
[1:08:25] Christ but what does the what does the
[1:08:27] Holy Ghost mean by this scripture right
[1:08:31] here buy of me gold Tri in the fire that
[1:08:34] thou mayest be
[1:08:35] rich he says now these days people have
[1:08:38] plenty of gold but it was the wrong kind
[1:08:39] it was the gold that was bought that
[1:08:41] bought men's lives and destroyed them we
[1:08:43] see that every day the effects of the
[1:08:46] economy the wickedness people struggling
[1:08:50] in America
[1:08:52] struggling right I just saw posted where
[1:08:54] was the American dream at it's gone than
[1:08:56] is gone you have to have that you have
[1:08:58] to catch the heavenly vision right
[1:09:00] now you've got to catch this thing that
[1:09:03] you were what part of that bride and the
[1:09:05] prophet God broke and and saw the the
[1:09:07] the the moving of the Bride up you've
[1:09:08] got to you got to see yourself there
[1:09:10] that was me not the ones in the back in
[1:09:12] our line but the ones that are standing
[1:09:13] and marching and says right uh uh I'm
[1:09:15] one of them amen right Hallelujah he
[1:09:18] says he says it was the the gold that
[1:09:20] bought men's lives and destroyed him it
[1:09:21] was the gold that warped and twisted
[1:09:23] human what does the natural go do it
[1:09:26] twists human character for it is the
[1:09:30] root is the love was the root of all
[1:09:33] evil so if false go I like this if
[1:09:37] natural gold
[1:09:38] twists human character right what will
[1:09:42] the what is the true gold amen but there
[1:09:45] is a gold of God he says that the tri
[1:09:47] your faith be much more precious than
[1:09:50] gold that that perishes the gold of God
[1:09:53] is a
[1:09:54] Christlike character produced in the
[1:09:56] fiery furnace of Affliction he says that
[1:09:59] is the right kind of gold
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:03] hallelujah that's right so literally I
[1:10:07] can catch all the mysteries of God I can
[1:10:10] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:12] and the character on
[1:10:14] me the character the very life that
[1:10:17] Christ expressed out of you is literally
[1:10:21] the richest thing you could have the
[1:10:24] gold the wealth that God wants to give
[1:10:26] you is his own life is his own character
[1:10:33] amen let's weigh these things correct
[1:10:36] from here on out Hallelujah if you
[1:10:39] something horrible takes place in your
[1:10:41] life and you don't lash out and you
[1:10:45] don't speak evil of this don't speak
[1:10:46] evil that and you say all is
[1:10:50] well thank you
[1:10:52] Jesus me and my wife just got a new
[1:10:54] little
[1:10:55] puppy and when the first two weeks I had
[1:10:58] a bad dream that that dog
[1:11:00] died I don't have children so this my
[1:11:03] be and I says Lord if that was of you I
[1:11:07] will love you
[1:11:10] still I will love you still Lord
[1:11:13] whatever you take blessed be the name of
[1:11:16] the Lord that's right though he slay me
[1:11:19] yes shall I love
[1:11:22] him
[1:11:25] he says the gold of God is a Christlike
[1:11:28] character produced in the fiery furnace
[1:11:30] of Affliction that is the right kind of
[1:11:33] gold but what kind of gold does the
[1:11:34] church have today it has but the worldly
[1:11:36] gold that will perish it is Rich it is
[1:11:38] complacent it has more affluence of the
[1:11:40] major criteria of
[1:11:43] spirituality the evidence of God's
[1:11:45] blessing the evidence of God's blessing
[1:11:49] and the correctness of Doctrine well how
[1:11:52] do we know who know brother Kim my
[1:11:54] pastor just preached a sermon how do we
[1:11:55] know what is right in the message or
[1:11:58] something to that lines is it because we
[1:12:00] have the biggest church the best
[1:12:03] choir the most well-known
[1:12:06] Pastor the prophet said the evidence
[1:12:09] they say the evidence of God's blessing
[1:12:10] correctness of Doctrine Etc is now based
[1:12:12] upon how many Rich folks are involved in
[1:12:15] it right
[1:12:19] yeah he said you better come to it
[1:12:21] before it's too late and buy me gold
[1:12:23] tried in the fire fire and truly be rich
[1:12:26] are we getting it listen to me he says
[1:12:28] Naked physically came to the world but
[1:12:29] naked spiritually we will not leave
[1:12:33] it I say it like this I was
[1:12:36] teaching on Bible study sorry I'm making
[1:12:38] you tired thank you for standing God
[1:12:40] bless you look at these sweet Honeys
[1:12:43] just
[1:12:45] soldiers I was doing a bible study on
[1:12:48] Monday nights now with a new with a
[1:12:50] family now not new but family cuz they
[1:12:53] wanted to go through for a certain
[1:12:55] new family member and I started just
[1:13:00] teaching and in the first three nights
[1:13:02] first three Mondays they were so blown
[1:13:04] away by the things now they've been the
[1:13:06] message since early 90s they heard stuff
[1:13:09] they never heard
[1:13:11] before and to
[1:13:14] us oh yeah absolutely we can just write
[1:13:16] it off our heads and now I'll just give
[1:13:18] an
[1:13:19] example the four
[1:13:21] gospels were the type of the four zoons
[1:13:24] which produces which protects the Holy
[1:13:27] Ghost the book of Acts right they're
[1:13:29] like that the prophet said that is that
[1:13:31] in the Bible and I did a bible study on
[1:13:33] it and they're like I've never heard
[1:13:36] that yet in the message been everywhere
[1:13:39] in the world never even heard it and I
[1:13:42] kept thinking it's like I might not be a
[1:13:44] very popular minister or teacher but I
[1:13:47] see the just one little effect I can
[1:13:50] have on a family is like what giving
[1:13:52] them the
[1:13:58] amen so then what will we what will we
[1:14:01] take with us he says we will take our
[1:14:03] character brother that is what we will
[1:14:05] take with us now what kind of character
[1:14:07] will you take with you will it be his
[1:14:09] whose character was molded by suffering
[1:14:11] and by the F fiery furnace of Affliction
[1:14:13] or will be the softness of this
[1:14:15] characterless leoan people that's
[1:14:19] right so you want to be a rich man rich
[1:14:22] woman poor man Rich
[1:14:26] Man follow Christ through the Hall of
[1:14:31] critics stick with your pastor seek the
[1:14:34] Holy Ghost and God will bring the fiery
[1:14:38] trials they're coming the fiery trials
[1:14:41] are you guys getting young you've been
[1:14:44] out in the workforce a little bit you've
[1:14:45] seen some things it gets
[1:14:49] worse fiery trials will come and you're
[1:14:53] going to sit in a situation you're like
[1:14:54] Lord how do I get out of this and you he
[1:14:57] puts them there so you can pray
[1:14:59] through right and not just pray through
[1:15:02] and not see nothing and still trust
[1:15:05] him and then at the end you see a great
[1:15:08] Deliverance amen and a lot of times it
[1:15:11] doesn't happen the way you think but
[1:15:13] once you say that prayer we know that
[1:15:15] God is going to work it
[1:15:16] out Hallelujah he says it is up to each
[1:15:20] one of us for in that every man will
[1:15:22] bear his own own burden let's
[1:15:29] stand Rich Man Poor Man rich woman poor
[1:15:33] woman Proverbs 31:10 who can find a
[1:15:37] virtuous
[1:15:38] woman for her price is far above rubies

[1:15:44] character of Christ is the
[1:15:47] gold the way you treat God the way you

[1:15:51] husband is the the character is far
[1:15:56] above rubies

[1:16:01] amen at the end it says Proverbs 31:29
[1:16:04] many daughters have done virtuously but
[1:16:06] thou excellest them
[1:16:08] all you see what we're going to produce
[1:16:10] at the end we are going to be far
[1:16:13] greater by manifestation than all the
[1:16:16] rest it'll be the final move of the Holy
[1:16:19] Ghost favor is deceitful beauty is vain
[1:16:22] but a woman that fearth the Lord she
[1:16:24] shall be praised he says likewise you
[1:16:27] wives 1 Peter 3:1 be in be in subjection
[1:16:31] on your own husbands that if any obey
[1:16:33] not the word they may also without the
[1:16:35] word be won by the conversation of the
[1:16:40] wives just the way I carry myself and
[1:16:44] talk softly and always caring and just
[1:16:47] being sweet and
[1:16:49] kind in

[1:16:54] without the word acting a certain kind
[1:16:58] of way while they behold your Chase
[1:17:01] conversation coupled with fear whose
[1:17:03] adorning let it not be of the outward
[1:17:05] adorning of planting of the hail hair
[1:17:07] the wearing of gold and a putting on
[1:17:09] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[1:17:11] the heart there's your character right
[1:17:12] there the gold that's the gold right
[1:17:14] there the hidden man of the heart which
[1:17:16] is
[1:17:17] not corruptible even the ornament of a
[1:17:20] meek and quiet spirit
[1:17:23] which in the sight of God of great price

[1:26:30] everybody in the church is going to love
[1:26:32] them or everybody in the message is
[1:26:33] going to love them and you're going to
[1:26:35] find favor with all you brothers and
[1:26:38] sisters
[1:26:40] that's that's not the case a lot of
[1:26:46] times what kind of character should we
[1:26:49] have I'll say it like this
[1:26:53] when two brothers or two sisters get to
[1:26:55] talk about the Lord Jesus Christ and one
[1:26:57] has this Viewpoint and the other one has
[1:27:00] this Viewpoint and and yet they still
[1:27:03] don't agree on
[1:27:05] things we don't want to get upset and
[1:27:07] say ah I just leave saints of
[1:27:12] God people are who they are I can only
[1:27:15] see what God allows me to see that's it
[1:27:19] that's all I can

[1:27:22] another anything that's hidden is still
[1:27:25] hidden in the mind of God towards me
[1:27:27] brother Jess might see other things I
[1:27:29] see this but we're all limited to what

[1:27:50] Calvary that blood that that sacrifice
[1:27:53] that communion the the the bread and the
[1:27:57] wine yes very important look at the Book
