[0:01] it a little warm
[0:04] maybe amen you open that
[0:07] nobody thank you
[0:12] sir I put it at about 68 but then once
[0:15] the body's getting here we start
[0:17] praising the
[0:18] lord it's really warm real
[0:21] fast but better than that to have it
[0:23] cold right wouldn't want to come here
[0:25] and freeze icicles so we're thankful for
[0:29] God's gra thank brother am appreciate
[0:30] that Philippians 3 we'll read 13 and 14
[0:34] like to preach part two as I said on in
[0:36] 2024 we press toward the Mark I've have
[0:39] just been uh so blessed by these quotes
[0:41] from brother Brandon uh about how he
[0:44] approached the new year and then today
[0:46] we'll look at I think Jose will like
[0:48] some of these quotes we're look at all
[0:49] the times brother Brandon was given a
[0:50] commission by the holy spirit so I know
[0:53] he likes the
[0:55] quotes I like it too I love I just love
[0:57] talking about he shared some quotes with
[0:58] me this week where brother man said
[1:01] Jesus was tempted at the woman at the
[1:03] well just in his own physical you know
[1:05] because she was Immortal woman he just
[1:07] had to overcome that he was tempted in
[1:09] all points like as we are thought wow I
[1:12] never knew brother R said that so that's
[1:14] a little JB there a little nugget our
[1:16] brother got there and just the reality
[1:18] Jesus overcame everything and he
[1:20] overcame it one way by the word of God
[1:23] that's what we can overcome today by the
[1:24] word of God so Philippians 3:13 and 14
[1:28] I'll read 13 we can all read 14 Brethren
[1:31] I count not myself to have apprehended
[1:34] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[1:36] things which are behind and reaching
[1:38] forth unto those things which are before
[1:41] let's all read this on three 1 2 3 I
[1:43] press toward the mark for the prize of
[1:46] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:50] amen may God add his Blessing to reo's
[1:51] word may be
[1:58] seated
[2:06] see how this service goes I like maybe
[2:07] have some time of prayer at the end
[2:10] because some of these topics are dealing
[2:12] with seeking the
[2:16] Lord
[2:18] so I've learned just you know just I've
[2:20] been maybe reminded but I've learned how
[2:22] brother brandom approached a new year
[2:25] and how he approached uh the you know
[2:27] the goals for his life
[2:30] I thought it was uh just inspiring just
[2:32] so simple but so inspiring um and I've
[2:36] been blessed by that so I'm just going
[2:37] to review just for five minutes
[2:39] Wednesday's message if you didn't hear
[2:40] it uh pressing toward the mark means uh
[2:43] eagerly running after the goal and the
[2:46] High Calling is the invitation to Heaven
[2:49] it's the invitation to the marriage
[2:51] supper of the lamb praise God there's
[2:53] only a small group of people that get to
[2:55] set the marriage supper the lamb
[2:56] Hallelujah and God has called us to be a
[2:58] part of that amen we're not sitting in a
[3:00] Catholic church today thank God we're
[3:02] not sitting in a bar we're not sitting
[3:03] in the hospital today we are in the
[3:05] house of God hallelujah amen we serve
[3:08] the Living God so we are privileged to
[3:11] be invited to the marriage supper Land
[3:13] one place brother said that's the
[3:14] greatest privilege of your life is to be
[3:16] invited to the marriage supper of the
[3:17] Lamb with Jesus Christ Hallelujah say
[3:20] thank you Lord for inviting me I didn't
[3:22] go looking for him he came looking for
[3:23] me praise God hallelujah he came looking
[3:26] for you Hallelujah and we saw that we do
[3:28] this by Pres in our bodies a Living
[3:30] Sacrifice and then renewing our minds
[3:32] according to Romans 12 God promised to
[3:34] instruct Us in the way we would go he
[3:36] would guide us our our steps are ordered
[3:39] of God he gives us wisdom to number our
[3:42] days to apply our hearts to wisdom his
[3:45] word is a lamp into our feet right so
[3:48] the word will be a lamp for 2024
[3:51] Hallelujah and we saw God rewards
[3:53] diligent
[3:55] Seekers Hallelujah so we want to
[3:57] diligently uh investigate that means
[3:59] diligent means investigate to Crave or
[4:01] seek after the will of God seek after
[4:04] God there's always more to be known
[4:06] about God yes there let's us never have
[4:08] the attitude well I'm in the message I
[4:10] know all about it let's never have that
[4:12] attitude let's be thankful for the
[4:14] message as we said thankful we're
[4:16] invited to the marriage supper the lamb
[4:18] but let us always remember there's more
[4:20] to God for us to have
[4:22] Hallelujah and we saw how moral you know
[4:25] your free moral agency decisions make
[4:27] you an overcomer Hallelujah
[4:30] and David was better at obeying God than
[4:33] Saul the only way you can overcome is by
[4:35] the word hallelujah that's the only way
[4:37] you're know sorry the only way you know
[4:39] you're an overcomer is by overcoming so
[4:42] in other words we should have
[4:43] testimonies at the end of the year God
[4:44] help me overcome this God brought me
[4:47] through that situation hallelujah amen
[4:50] that's the only way we can know we're
[4:51] Overcomers Hallelujah we must give all
[4:54] diligence keep your heart with all
[4:55] diligence Peter said give all diligence
[4:57] twice Hallelujah
[5:00] he says love the Lord your God with all
[5:01] your strength but we must first find the
[5:04] will of God for our lives in our gifts
[5:06] our relationships our vocations our
[5:07] locations our Ministries Hallelujah and
[5:11] brother Ram gave us five musts to do the
[5:13] will of God so we went through that
[5:15] again a wonderful review Hallelujah and
[5:18] then we looked at how we must shape Our
[5:20] Lives by
[5:21] self-control Hallelujah and then brother
[5:24] Ram said uh we must do our best for
[5:26] Jesus and then he'll say Well done it
[5:28] was well done good and faithful servant
[5:30] hallelujah amen now uh brother man said
[5:33] do a good job with your talent whatever
[5:35] you've been doing to whatever Talent
[5:37] you've been given to fix
[5:39] machines Hallelujah we got some Factory
[5:41] workers in here that do a wonderful job
[5:44] uh to fix the Earth brother Jose
[5:46] landscaper Hallelujah to train
[5:48] children's Minds you know that's kind of
[5:51] where I whatever job you've been given
[5:53] he said give God all your talent do the
[5:55] best job you can Hallelujah because
[5:57] you're doing it for God hallelujah
[6:00] says the worst thing you can do is
[6:01] neglect a try that's the worst thing
[6:04] like he said the parable burying your
[6:05] talent in the ground that's the worst
[6:07] thing you can
[6:08] do the the so the best thing is find
[6:11] what God's called you to do and do it
[6:13] the very best you can hallelujah amen
[6:15] brother said the most ambitious person
[6:17] is a
[6:18] Christian Hallelujah brother said get
[6:21] some ambition about you set your goal on
[6:23] Christ Hallelujah am he said you got to
[6:26] persevere to make your goal which means
[6:28] continuing in a course of action you got
[6:31] to keep acting on the the word of God
[6:32] despite difficulty we must persevere
[6:36] amen and then I like what he said he
[6:38] said when you plan for the year he said
[6:40] lay he said now he laid out all his
[6:42] imitations brother Jose said he had over
[6:44] a thousand
[6:46] imitations and uh to different states
[6:48] and around the world so he'd let all the
[6:50] California imitations in one stack all
[6:52] the Michigan all the Ohio all that
[6:54] overseas and he would wait on God then
[6:56] he said I'd wait for a week I'd drive
[6:58] around I'd pray i' go for for walks he
[7:00] would look for God to give him
[7:02] inspiration that's what I'm looking for
[7:03] this morning Hallelujah cuz I've laid my
[7:06] request I wrote about on Wednesday night
[7:07] after service I prayed I wrote my goals
[7:09] for 2024 Hallelujah and then this
[7:12] morning before church I laid them before
[7:14] God and I'm going to wait a week I'm
[7:15] going to see what the Lord is leading me
[7:17] to do praise God I'm looking for two
[7:20] witnesses because in the mouth of two or
[7:22] three Witnesses let every word be
[7:24] established and that's what brother Ram
[7:26] did he'd pray he'd wait and he looked
[7:29] for inspiration from the Holy Spirit he
[7:32] said I'm looking for something to
[7:34] impress me so hard I'm looking for just
[7:37] an impression he says I want to be
[7:39] impressed by the Holy Spirit don't you
[7:40] want to be that
[7:41] way said when you approach the New Year
[7:44] resolutions don't work I'm I'm I'm
[7:46] resolved to do this this year he said
[7:48] what works is death dying out to
[7:51] yourself Hallelujah he said it doesn't
[7:53] make you can resolve to do anything he
[7:55] said you'll just go back to it the next
[7:57] day right right but he said die yourself
[8:00] let God give you some impression and
[8:02] then you know God is with you for that
[8:04] that that goal praise God amen amen
[8:10] hallelujah
[8:12] hallelujah so uh now I'm getting down to
[8:14] these last quotes here and when brother
[8:17] Ram didn't have a leading he looked for
[8:19] somebody who had a leading like brother
[8:21] arganbright Hallelujah so if you don't
[8:23] have a leading you know look look to
[8:25] somebody who feels LED you know they're
[8:27] led by God and follow their leading
[8:29] maybe help out with their Ministry
[8:30] praise God hallelujah and then by 1964
[8:34] he said I have no leading of the Lord
[8:35] out here in Arizona but I'm just going
[8:37] to try to do whatever I can so he had no
[8:40] specific leading at that time of his
[8:42] life so he was just doing what wherever
[8:43] got an imitation he would go so it just
[8:46] encourages us no matter where we are you
[8:49] know we should be seeking uh God's
[8:51] perfect will for our lives but if we
[8:53] can't if we can't put our finger on God
[8:55] wants me to do that do something praise
[8:57] God and I'll say like this you're
[8:58] already doing a wonderful job you know
[8:59] paying your ties coming to church
[9:01] singing songs and worshiping God those
[9:03] are all good things but anything beyond
[9:06] that let's seek God for it praise God
[9:09] let's seek God for is there something
[9:10] this year God wants me to do praise God
[9:14] hallelujah so that's what I ended with
[9:16] that last quote uh do the best job
[9:18] whatever you can I appreciate beus gave
[9:21] me a little comment on the the the video
[9:23] there on Wednesday so thank you sister
[9:25] beatric all right now let's begin part
[9:27] two amen I like to hear it's just nice
[9:28] to hear some feedback sometimes you know
[9:30] when you when you're preaching and
[9:31] studying now you can switch over I got
[9:33] some quotes here so that was a actually
[9:36] a 8 Minute 8 Minute review so forgive
[9:39] me so I did A Brief Review eight minutes
[9:42] there so I compiled some of these uh
[9:44] quotes here I want to bring this quote
[9:47] out too brother Rand said you know
[9:49] sometimes he would have invitations to
[9:52] go to a poor church or a rich church I
[9:55] want you to see what he says here he
[9:57] said I truly say I'm sorry this is the
[9:59] closing service he said I'm going to
[10:00] skip down a little bit he says I say
[10:03] this because it's true there's places
[10:04] waiting that's got tens of thousands of
[10:06] people together all overseas hundreds of
[10:08] places overseas major cities in America
[10:11] now but I usually lay the things out the
[10:13] invitations and pray over them now think
[10:15] about that what if you had an imitation
[10:17] e for your job or anything you know and
[10:19] they said there's 10,000 people you're
[10:21] going to be the speaker and there's
[10:22] 10,000 people there or there's just like
[10:24] a you know a same same type of
[10:26] convention and there's only 10 people
[10:28] there which one you think God would lead
[10:29] you to well we would think in our minds
[10:32] well he wants me to go to the big place
[10:34] but just here some time ago I read an
[10:36] invitation my wife and I were getting
[10:37] the invitations at our house one man
[10:39] said brother Ram if you'll come we'll
[10:41] guarantee you such and such a money now
[10:43] isn't that such a Temptation isn't that
[10:47] you know so much if you'll just come now
[10:50] preachers should be paid to come the
[10:52] Bible said the the labors worthy of his
[10:54] hire yes right but the next letter said
[10:57] brother Ram I haven't got a thing I can
[10:59] promise you not even a place to lay your
[11:01] head now which one which one do you
[11:02] think tens of thousands with lots of
[11:04] money or a place where we don't even
[11:06] know if we can house
[11:08] you I said I'm a married man and I have
[11:11] and I have seven daughters the preacher
[11:12] said I got six that's pretty close to me
[11:15] and five of them are grown I got one
[11:16] grown we're all here in a little three
[11:18] room house said I'm preaching under two
[11:21] pine trees said God knows I need you you
[11:25] know where I went he didn't go to the
[11:27] big place promising him money
[11:30] he went to the little humble place that
[11:31] didn't have any
[11:33] money he said that's right and there out
[11:35] of the meeting they built a great
[11:37] Tabernacle so somehow they got funding
[11:39] there to build it they were poor but
[11:41] they great they built a great Tabernacle
[11:43] and that as far as I know is still
[11:44] pastoring and that was down in Arkansas
[11:46] see it's always best to follow the
[11:48] leading of the Holy Spirit you know I'm
[11:50] promised more money if I go to this job
[11:52] or this place here I'm not promised
[11:55] anything but where is God leading that
[11:57] takes the direction of the Holy Spirit
[12:00] that takes somebody who's led by the
[12:02] holy spirit that can submit and humble
[12:04] themselves to the Holy Spirit I'm
[12:07] promised big money here I'm not even
[12:08] promised a hotel over
[12:12] there he says I've never preached to a
[12:14] nicer congregation I have these five
[12:16] nights he said I appreciate you all
[12:18] you've been very loyal so isn't that
[12:20] just wonderful to see a man of God it
[12:23] kind of reminds me of Philip remember
[12:24] Philip was at the great Revival down
[12:26] there in Samaria but the holy spirit
[12:27] said go out to one and preach a
[12:30] Revival preaching a Revival to one
[12:32] person hallelujah amen very similar
[12:35] right so see how again brother R's life
[12:37] matches that of a prophet very closely
[12:40] perfectly I'll say with the
[12:44] scriptures now here I like this prayer
[12:46] you know I'm not sure if this is a New
[12:47] Year's Prayer or not we'll look no he
[12:50] said help us as
[12:51] ministers uh see that we are requiring
[12:55] so much we must have a church we must
[12:57] have this we must have everything our
[12:59] women before going to church yet call
[13:01] themselves Christian we have to have a
[13:02] certain kind of a dress or have to be
[13:03] dressed so dobly now we don't battle
[13:05] that
[13:07] sisters and preachers will have so much
[13:09] money before they'll come thank God we
[13:11] don't have preachers like
[13:13] that you know fact there's been numerous
[13:15] times a like three or four times I
[13:17] forgot to pay preachers and they never
[13:19] complain I just mail it in the mail the
[13:21] week the next week you know I just
[13:22] forget sometimes in my busy life oh
[13:25] Christ when I read here how they
[13:27] wondered about and she skins and goat
[13:29] skins see God may God ever keep us
[13:31] humble like the real saints they lived
[13:34] in the dens of the earth and caves they
[13:35] wondered about under vile persecution
[13:37] yet obtain the faith under the ministry
[13:39] of angels how will we escape when the
[13:41] Lord Jesus has given us fine homes how
[13:43] many got a fine home how many got
[13:47] cars I got cars clothes and food and we
[13:51] murmur we sit around we're
[13:54] lazy now I don't think that's us but
[13:57] I'll say like this we don't want to
[13:58] become that that you're not that because
[14:00] if you're lazy you'd be at home right
[14:04] you're not lazy you come here to love
[14:05] the Lord and worship and you give all
[14:06] your Sunday to God most people can't
[14:08] even give hardly one service to God on a
[14:10] Sunday it's the Lord's
[14:12] day we never try to go out and do
[14:15] something about it how will we escape
[14:16] God now the point I want to get out of
[14:18] here is I want to do something about my
[14:21] friends and loved ones that maybe aren't
[14:23] serving God and that's what I think will
[14:25] help you what is there some what's a
[14:28] situation that you can do something
[14:30] about and what I mean by that is like
[14:32] I've learned this week you know is just
[14:34] just going out and offering to
[14:35] fellowship with somebody or just going
[14:37] out and trying to see someone who who
[14:39] might be depressed or discouraged what
[14:42] can you do about it that's what's
[14:44] impressed upon me what can I do about it
[14:46] is there something I can do about it
[14:48] amen hallelujah that's the kind of zeal
[14:51] I want to have this year praise God Amen
[14:54] I want to finish 2023 and I want to
[14:56] start Lord willly 2024 I don't want to
[14:59] sit back and do nothing about it I want
[15:01] to do something about it you I think
[15:04] about when I wasn't saved at akan
[15:07] University brother bang when we were
[15:08] both
[15:09] there the the chapel preacher invited me
[15:13] out to breakfast I think it was every
[15:14] Tuesday
[15:15] morning I didn't have I wasn't a
[15:17] Christian I didn't have Christian
[15:19] friends I was going to a couple parties
[15:21] and it wasn't was awful you know but but
[15:24] he made that he made a step with me like
[15:26] to kind of Mentor me and eventually you
[15:28] know the story I've told it many times
[15:31] he drew me in
[15:33] right but see I'm glad he made that
[15:36] effort he did something about it so when
[15:38] my mom dropped me off and I was the only
[15:40] one I didn't know a single soul in all
[15:42] of arine except for the coach she drops
[15:44] me off with 150,000 people I know one of
[15:47] them but thank God Jesus was with me
[15:49] amen her last words were uh preacher can
[15:53] you try to invite Jesse to
[15:55] church and look what the preacher did he
[15:57] met with met with me every week and it
[15:59] was nice even paid for my my lunch or my
[16:02] breakfast I always get the pancakes and
[16:04] eggs you like that
[16:06] buddy I always get pancakes and then he
[16:09] would print off parts of a chapter out
[16:10] of a book of a Bible I'm sorry out of a
[16:12] a book of a of a Christian Author can't
[16:16] remember his name now I'll think of it
[16:18] eventually but we he would just go over
[16:20] a few things in there and talk to me
[16:22] about college and how's it going he he
[16:24] did something about my walk my walk with
[16:27] the Lord that's what I want to do that's
[16:29] why I reach out to those three families
[16:31] that don't have they don't have dads
[16:32] they don't have
[16:33] moms and I want I want to do something
[16:35] about it amen I want to show the love of
[16:37] Christ to them I don't want to sit back
[16:38] and let somebody else do it I want to do
[16:41] it praise God am so see I'm not you know
[16:44] I'm not condemning anybody but I
[16:47] recognize I battle complaining sometimes
[16:49] because I'm human right I'm an American
[16:53] I battle first world
[16:56] problems like waiting behind somebody at
[16:58] a stop like too long or someone's
[17:00] driving too slow on the way to church
[17:01] and I'm like can you just you're just
[17:02] going for a Sunday Drive can you please
[17:04] move you know we we're human and we
[17:06] battle these things but I don't want to
[17:09] sit around and do something nothing
[17:10] about it I want to do something about it
[17:12] praise God but I got to be led by the
[17:15] Holy Spirit and so I got to seek God to
[17:17] know what to
[17:19] do like I remember uh remember 200 21 I
[17:23] looked at bang right down here I said
[17:24] brother bang maybe this is year Zur
[17:26] comes back remember that brother
[17:29] hallelujah
[17:30] amen maybe this 2024 maybe it's the year
[17:34] you feel in the
[17:36] blank Hallelujah we'll do something

[22:38] this anointing that comes with singing

[22:51] routines and we go through the year if
[22:53] you're like anything like me I'm just a
[22:55] very routine person but it's just a
[22:57] fresh reminder you know we do something
[22:59] about other people's lives we reach out
[23:00] to other people we try to help people
[23:03] God give us a fresh Vision give us
[23:05] renewed Faith so we'll be up and at it
[23:07] hallelujah amen
[23:12] hallelujah remember it was your Worship
[23:15] in those dance services that he was like
[23:17] wow there's so much Freedom it was those
[23:18] services that he saw all you praising
[23:20] the Lord that made him first reach out
[23:22] to
[23:23] me praise God see God God uses those
[23:27] videos God uses your testimony praise
[23:29] God
[23:30] Amen now we looked at this a little bit
[23:33] I just want to share a little example
[23:34] here now some habits you can overcome by
[23:37] the Holy Spirit how many know that so
[23:39] God help me overcome smoking and chewing
[23:41] and alcohol and dirty magazines all the
[23:44] god helped me do
[23:47] it as I surrendered to his
[23:51] will in other words God just didn't take
[23:53] it all away I had to sacrifice I had to
[23:56] do something about it
[23:59] okay and that's what brother is talking
[24:01] about here habits or
[24:04] Spirits the Bible said they're unclean
[24:07] spirits so we want to have healthy
[24:09] habits by God's
[24:11] grace and here's the quote I read this
[24:13] on Wednesday night you know sobody says
[24:15] Lord uh if the Lord will take this evil
[24:17] spirit from me drinking or gambling or
[24:19] stealing I'll serve him he said but
[24:21] that's up to
[24:22] you you got something to do that they
[24:25] that overcome shall inherit all things
[24:27] they must they that they that overcome
[24:29] you have power to do it you must be
[24:30] willing to lay it down see she's made
[24:32] herself ready you've got to make
[24:34] decisions for yourself when you do that
[24:37] you show your faith and respect to God
[24:39] Amen now I'm going to preach both sides
[24:41] of this right now one side is there's
[24:44] habits that we can get rid of on our
[24:46] own if we just yield to the Holy Spirit
[24:50] right Hallelujah that's what I'm saying
[24:52] today if we got habits that we shouldn't
[24:55] have let's pray God will give us Grace
[24:57] Hallelujah let's reach out to god let's
[24:58] put our faith in it let's trust God to
[25:00] overcome any habit that we can control
[25:03] praise God Amen but there are other
[25:05] habits on this other side see how I move
[25:07] from one side to other side there are
[25:08] habits on this side where you can't
[25:10] overcome it on your own and you have to
[25:12] have God intervening amen so I'm just
[25:15] bringing that out there's some you can't
[25:17] do without God's help there's others you
[25:20] can you can do on your own amen amen
[25:23] hallelujah so we're going to have a
[25:25] fresh Vision we're going to have a an
[25:27] attit you to get up and be at it well we
[25:29] got to recognize some things we can
[25:31] overcome other things we have to have
[25:33] God step in amen and the example I want
[25:36] to give is this
[25:37] sister yeah only there's other habits
[25:40] Only God Can Heal so brother Jose
[25:42] brought me this great book brother I'm
[25:44] loving this book uh we're about 60% done
[25:48] we're doing it for our family devotions
[25:49] at night I love it I love hearing these
[25:50] stories of brother brother R would have
[25:52] visions like eating at the table he had
[25:54] visions of people this person's going to
[25:56] be made well and then the people would
[25:57] get well well just just while you're
[25:58] eating dinner it's just amazing I love
[26:01] hearing these testimonies because some
[26:02] of these are not on tape you only hear
[26:04] them when the people write I want I want
[26:05] to read about this sister here I thought
[26:07] it would just be a good
[26:08] example sister Rosella Griffith Martin
[26:12] how many know Sister Rosella she's on
[26:14] tape brother Jose knows
[26:20] you she first came into contact with
[26:22] brother br's meetings in
[26:26] 1952 uh uh now what happened was her
[26:30] addiction was
[26:32] alcohol she was an alcoholic for many
[26:36] years okay she graduated high school got
[26:38] a job and then going she started going
[26:41] out with the girls they they ordered
[26:42] mixed drinks like every night after work
[26:44] and it became an obsession she drank
[26:48] excessively at the age of 25 in 1949
[26:51] there was no hope for her she was a
[26:53] confir confirmed
[26:56] alcoholic she was so so cold cuz you
[26:58] know you get shakes when you're an
[26:59] alcoholic she was so cold at just like
[27:01] you know 20 some years old 25 her mom
[27:04] bought her one of those big fur coats
[27:05] but she would hide alcohol on the inside
[27:07] of those and keep drinking the whole
[27:10] time that that this is the kind of
[27:12] addicts that would come to brother R's
[27:13] meetings they had to give her shots of
[27:15] vitamins to keep her alive because all
[27:17] she would do was drink
[27:18] alcohol her dad gave up on her one time
[27:21] she tried to step in front of a car
[27:22] going 80 miles per hour and it just it
[27:24] just skimmed her leg just barely she
[27:26] tried to commit suicide
[27:30] how many know God's in the
[27:31] details God knew that little inch or
[27:34] that quarter inch right between the car
[27:35] and this woman why she was a
[27:37] predestinated seed amen amen kind of
[27:41] reminds you of the maniac of gther right
[27:44] she just in this world of addiction and
[27:46] world of demon possession with
[27:51] alcohol her mom her mom never gave up on
[27:54] her her dad kind of gave up on her her
[27:57] mom said said maybe she can't change
[27:58] herself but God is able to change her am
[28:02] when I was at my worst my mother saw me
[28:04] in a vision with my Bible in front of me
[28:06] she believed God gave her that vision
[28:08] and she clung to that rather than
[28:10] believe with the doctor told her amen
[28:12] may God give us a vision Hallelujah give
[28:14] us a dream something to hang on for to
[28:17] do something about somebody else's need
[28:19] praise God oh I love this story what a
[28:22] beautiful
[28:24] Story So eventually she joined
[28:26] alcoholics and she was sober for 9
[28:28] months every day I kneel down by my bed
[28:30] and prayed God would you keep me sober
[28:32] today I stayed sober but I was not free
[28:35] now there's a
[28:36] difference there was that terrible
[28:38] craving
[28:40] still and the craving never left for
[28:42] those nine months until she went to see
[28:45] the prophet of God
[28:47] hallelujah her friend one day told her
[28:50] Rosella make sure you tell your mom
[28:51] there's a man of God over in Hammond
[28:53] Indiana now don't forget that two nights
[28:55] later I was standing for brother brandom
[28:57] on the plat
[28:58] platform and through his prophetic eyes
[29:00] he saw me covered in darkness you're an
[29:02] alcoholic he said to me I said yes sir
[29:05] he told the audience to Bow their heads
[29:07] and he placed his hand on my head and
[29:08] rebuked the demon of alcohol from my
[29:10] life in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:13] instantly I was free Amen Hallelujah
[29:16] Lord that wasn't it Church she had a
[29:18] friend who was addicted she went and got
[29:20] her friend who had the same demon came
[29:22] to brother R brother R prayed for her
[29:24] and she got made well too praise God
[29:28] then she went to Brother M's meetings in
[29:29] Jeffersonville and it was time for
[29:31] communion and she was wondering oh I got
[29:33] to drink alcohol again I think about
[29:35] what a Temptation that would be but
[29:36] before they St up there she tells the
[29:39] testimony brother R saids sister you can
[29:41] have it you're going to be all right she
[29:43] took it she said I never had one craving
[29:45] I've all these years later she said I've
[29:47] never had any craving other at all and
[29:50] I'm able to take the communion I talk
[29:52] about a healing praise God Amen you're
[29:55] addicted for all these years but then
[29:57] God drops down and God does the
[29:59] Deliverance amen see there's some habits

[30:11] encouraging you praise God until the
[30:14] time of Deliverance comes thank God for
[30:16] the hour of Deliverance praise God amen
[30:22] amen then she led her husband to Jesus
[30:26] Christ she said 'I never forget brother
[30:28] Brown for bringing Jesus to me he told
[30:31] me don't you ever fail to witness for
[30:33] Jesus Christ
[30:35] amen think of that she was an alcoholic
[30:38] then an Alcoholic Anonymous that could
[30:40] never cure it then she gets healed and
[30:42] brother says never fail to witness about
[30:46] your testimony now let me bring that
[30:47] down home what testimony has God given
[30:49] us let us always have it on the front of
[30:51] our lips to share our testimony with
[30:53] others praise God I want to show you
[30:55] where God LED this woman
[30:59] this was no ordinary
[31:01] woman she said for the last 50 years I
[31:05] have witnessed in jail Services when was
[31:07] the last time you were jail it's been a
[31:08] number of years since I went to jail I
[31:11] saw I wasn't in jail but I was visiting
[31:12] somebody in
[31:14] jail for 50 years she'd go visit jail
[31:18] Services skidrow missions I'm not sure
[31:21] what that is but missions where I think
[31:22] they take care of drug addicts churches
[31:25] hospitals to my neighbor and people I
[31:28] meet on the street when brother R prayed
[31:30] for me he asked if I would serve Jesus
[31:31] the rest of my life I said
[31:34] yes and I meant it praise God the
[31:36] greatest joy has been to go out and win
[31:39] souls for the
[31:40] Lord she's no preacher but what she's
[31:43] like the woman at the well she's got a
[31:45] mighty testimony Hallelujah and your
[31:47] testimony can burn up the city for Jesus

[32:03] me oh thank you Jesus amen a woman who
[32:07] spent 50 years doing something about it
[32:10] praise God Amen I'm not going to sit
[32:12] back and let let the souls come to me
[32:14] I'm going to go out to the hurting I'm

[32:18] forget who was brother Jose but we had a
[32:20] preacher coming here and he'd heard her
[32:22] testimony she they would have meetings
[32:24] you know message meetings pre Services
[32:26] instead of preaching they would invite
[32:27] her just to give her testimony how she
[32:28] knew brother brandom and people got
[32:30] saved people got delivered so what I'm
[32:33] trying to say is uh let by God's grace
[32:35] let's find what God's called us to do
[32:37] amen amen let's find the hurting let's
[32:41] find where we can share our testimonies

[32:46] grace amen I think that's
[32:49] beautiful look at that she's got both
[32:51] pictures back there Lord Jesus and
[32:53] brother R's picture sometimes I think
[32:55] about putting brother R's picture in
[32:56] here maybe I'll do that that in
[32:58] 2024 because it it's it's about Jesus
[33:01] it's about the pillar of fire that led

[33:51] that right right praise

[35:15] right now remember brother talks about
[35:17] you know eating so you know uh a lot of
[35:20] people get a lot of people aren't
[35:21] blessed physically because they eat the
[35:23] wrong Foods right brother tells us you
[35:25] know some of us eat and never exercise
[35:28] others are over exercised and don't get
[35:29] a chance to eat now he's talking about
[35:31] spiritually but it applies to the
[35:32] Natural as well I mean people want
[35:35] people want their physical bodies
[35:36] blessed but are they willing to meet the
[35:38] conditions of that right we got to be if
[35:41] we want to see a change God's not going
[35:43] to naturally take off 20 pounds or for
[35:44] me he's not going to add 10 pounds of
[35:46] muscle for me I've got to put some
[35:48] effort into it right I've got to obey
[35:51] the laws of the Bible
[35:53] amen so you know I I love these quotes
[35:56] you know brother wish is all these
[35:57] blessings but part of it sometimes we've
[35:59] got to get good habits about praise
[36:02] God the Bible said don't be among wine
[36:04] Biers and righteous Eaters of Flesh the
[36:07] drunker and the Glutton the Overeaters
[36:08] should come to poverty and the Bible
[36:10] said glorify God in your body because
[36:12] it's
[36:13] God
[36:16] Amen and how many want success there's
[36:18] only one time you know this I preach
[36:20] this when the Joshua series there's only
[36:22] one time the Bible said the word success
[36:24] and and God told Joshua you'll be a good
[36:26] success you'll be strong and of good
[36:28] courage do not be afraid of anything
[36:31] because the Lord thy God is with you
[36:33] whether soever thou goest hallelujah
[36:35] amen let's all say God is with me ready
[36:38] God is with me amen he's with you praise
[36:40] God and you'll be a success just keep
[36:43] the word of God in your mouth meditate
[36:45] upon the word of God in your heart
[36:47] praise God God will bless all your pasts
[36:49] hallelujah
[36:52] amen see I want to I want to I want to
[36:54] grow spiritually the Bible says resist
[36:56] the the devil he'll flee from you draw
[36:58] nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to you
[37:01] praise Goden if we want to be if we want
[37:03] to grow spiritually we've got to make an
[37:04] effort we got to obey the laws of God we
[37:07] got to draw nigh to God we must be
[37:09] closer with God in 2024 amen it's not
[37:11] just going to magically happen right
[37:14] right right I mean God could do that
[37:17] what he's going to do is he's going to
[37:18] put it on our hearts the word of God and
[37:20] then we look down at the word of God
[37:21] every day obey it and then we do it and
[37:23] when we do that we're overcoming
[37:25] hallelujah amen
[37:27] Glory humble yourselves in the sight of
[37:29] the Lord and He Shall lift you up
[37:32] humility always goes before reward or
[37:35] Victory humility is always first
[37:38] humbling ourselves drawing close to God
[37:40] and then God will exalt you Amen in the
[37:43] eyes of your family your friends like I
[37:45] said spouse the church the world
[37:47] whatever God chooses to do humility
[37:50] comes first reward comes second
[37:52] hallelujah
[37:54] amen and brother says I I pray God will
[37:57] bless you materially and financially
[37:59] well sometimes God's going to give you
[38:00] an abundance so you can help out other
[38:02] people that don't have as much righten
[38:04] see we might want well I want more money
[38:06] for me or I want more money for whatever
[38:09] but sometimes God's going to give you
[38:10] more just so you can give it to somebody
[38:14] else amen hallelujah that might be the
[38:17] reason God will bless you materially so
[38:19] you can be a blessing to somebody else
[38:23] amen
[38:25] hallelujah
[38:27] okay I'm those are just my notes I
[38:28] forgot to put them now I want to uh
[38:31] again emphasize this we must inquire or
[38:34] look to Jesus or consider Jesus when we
[38:37] plan for this next coming year like I
[38:39] said I've spent a little time praying
[38:41] about that I want to be led by the Holy
[38:42] Spirit I'm looking for something like in
[38:44] 2020 I was preaching on Philippians and
[38:47] I was showing how Paul defended the
[38:49] gospel and I was praying Lord do you
[38:50] want me to take this debate and as I was
[38:53] preaching it I said I I just I felt the
[38:55] Holy Spirit Come On Me me and I said I
[38:57] was born to defend this message and as
[38:59] soon as I close service I got an email
[39:01] pop up saying do you want to do this
[39:02] debate I thought I took that as two
[39:04] witnesses then I did did the debate and
[39:06] numerous people have been helped to save
[39:08] the message through that debate so
[39:10] that's what I'm looking for for 2024
[39:12] amen I'm looking for a second witness a
[39:15] third witness I'm looking for the Holy
[39:17] Spirit to move me because I don't want
[39:19] to do what I want to do I want to do
[39:20] what Jesus wants me to do am that's why
[39:22] I come to church praise God Amen to find
[39:25] out what is God want me to
[39:29] do right we know we know and I'll say
[39:31] like this as a balance we know so much
[39:33] of what God wants us to do but then
[39:35] there are certain areas where we need
[39:37] God to guide us into what to
[39:39] do which we'll show with brother Rand in
[39:42] in a moment here by God's grace I know
[39:44] Jose just can't wait to hear those
[39:45] quotes right
[39:47] Jose I love these quotes I just
[39:50] love remember David said one thing I
[39:53] desired and I will seek after this that
[39:56] that I may dwell in the house of the
[39:57] Lord all the days of my life to behold
[39:59] the beauty of the Lord and to acquire
[40:00] his Temple I just walked in here this
[40:01] morning and I just said I love being in
[40:03] the house of God Amen I love it praise
[40:05] God there nowhere else I want to be
[40:07] praise
[40:08] God all the days so I can behold the
[40:11] beauty of God and inquire in his Temple
[40:14] for I love this in the time of trouble
[40:17] he shall hide me in his Pavilion praise
[40:19] God amen amen in other words I want to
[40:22] spend all my time with God so that when
[40:24] Trials come he'll hide me with him s
[40:26] praise God because I spent all the other
[40:29] days trying to draw close to him praise
[40:32] God and brother uses that that's a
[40:35] Rapture verse for brother BR time of
[40:36] trouble the laying down the mark of the
[40:38] beast he'll hide me in his he'll Rapture
[40:40] me up to the meeting in the air praise
[40:43] God in the secret of his Tabernacle
[40:45] shall he hide me he shall set me on a
[40:48] rock and inquire means to seek after to
[40:50] look for I'm looking for God I'm looking
[40:52] for Jesus I'm considering God I'm
[40:55] reflecting on God go
[40:57] amen now I'm bringing this up from an
[40:59] old sermon I think it was 2017 David
[41:02] never inquired of the Lord about
[41:04] bringing the ark back yet he required
[41:06] about other situations four times and I
[41:08] just I just I'm reading through first
[41:10] Samuel now I'm in second Samuel now and
[41:12] I've just read these
[41:15] recently um David saved Kela from the
[41:19] Philistines remember that David David
[41:21] said Lord are they going to come out
[41:23] what should I do and the Lord said you
[41:24] you'll you'll save Kila
[41:28] and then David came back you know that
[41:29] that case in 1st Samuel 30 David went
[41:33] out with the Phil Philistine King to
[41:35] fight Saul talk about Civil
[41:38] War and God protected him from fighting
[41:41] against his brother and sister that's
[41:42] what I want God to do for us praise God
[41:45] God protect us from fighting against one
[41:47] another Hallelujah a lot of churches
[41:49] have a lot of fights between people
[41:51] that's why they have a lot of troubles
[41:53] different pastors tell me about it I'm
[41:54] like oh thank God for a church that
[41:55] loves each other praise God Amen but
[41:58] David actually went out with his mighty
[42:00] men and then the the Philistine King
[42:03] said uh one of his friends said oh he's
[42:05] just here to spy on you so he sent David
[42:06] back David was upset as soon as he got
[42:08] back to ziklag all the wives and
[42:11] children were gone everything was burned
[42:12] up and they went to Stone David and
[42:14] that's where David said I got to
[42:16] encourage myself amen there's nobody
[42:18] here to encourage me I got to encourage
[42:20] myself hallelujah amen and what did he
[42:22] do he said priest bring me the ark let
[42:25] me ask God what what I should do praise
[42:27] God that's what we need today praise God
[42:30] lord what do you want me to do today
[42:32] praise
[42:33] God and the he said Lord shall I go up
[42:35] he said go and restore all amen amen and
[42:39] while on the way there with the 600
[42:41] friends two of them 200 of them are too
[42:43] tired to go and some of the some of the
[42:45] guys said these guys are weak and tired
[42:47] they won't get the reward David said no
[42:49] they're part of our church praise God
[42:51] they've been faithful just because
[42:52] they're weak doesn't mean they don't get
[42:53] the spoils uh just because they're weak
[42:55] in this moment here that doesn't make
[42:57] them less they're still going to get
[42:58] reward I like that praise God
[43:02] hallelujah see not every battle is yours
[43:04] to win not every battle is yours to
[43:06] fight but you get all the blessings
[43:08] hallelujah amen you get all the
[43:10] blessings of being a Christian you get
[43:12] every benefit from being a Christian
[43:14] Hallelujah whether you're in the fight
[43:15] or not Hallelujah God still blesses his
[43:18] people God still anoints his people
[43:20] praise God
[43:22] Amen I like that then he said where
[43:25] should I go after Saul died and the Holy
[43:27] Spirit said go up to Hebron and he
[43:29] reigned there seven years as a king he
[43:31] Judah anointed him and he reigned seven
[43:33] years remember ishbosheth was was Saul's
[43:36] son and ishbosheth reigned those seven
[43:40] years and then he asked the Lord in 2
[43:42] Samuel 5 shall I go up against the
[43:45] Philistines and the Lord said yes they
[43:48] came against Jerusalem and twice he he
[43:50] inquired another time too the first time
[43:52] he went out whipped them they came back
[43:54] and the Lord said don't go straight out
[43:56] he said go by the way of the malberry
[43:57] trees and when you hear the Holy Spirit
[43:59] move through the malberry trees you
[44:01] follow that leading amen amen I want to
[44:04] hear the Holy Spirit come through this
[44:05] church praise
[44:06] God whether it's me preaching another
[44:09] preacher or one of you giv a word or
[44:10] testimony I want the Holy Spirit to blow
[44:12] through this church so we can follow the
[44:14] wind of the Holy Spirit praise God Amen
[44:17] praise God so you know what to do for
[44:19] this year amen and again there's nothing
[44:22] wrong with continuing what you're doing
[44:24] investing in whatever God's called you
[44:25] to do but if there's a a leading of God
[44:28] on your life let's inquire for God about
[44:31] it amen let's ask God what do you want
[44:33] to do about it like I've got numerous
[44:36] requests on here should I write the
[44:37] family book I want to do a series about
[44:40] learning the message I preach remember
[44:41] learning to learn from Jesus I want to
[44:43] finish that music series I would like to
[44:45] pay off my my debt my one more
[44:47] debt you know should we have more
[44:49] Revival services like the Appo one shall
[44:51] reach out to camp for more of those
[44:53] maybe God would meet us again I don't I
[44:56] don't know do God want us to have
[44:57] another Revival meeting
[44:59] here there's different things I like to
[45:02] make um different Souls I want to win
[45:05] invite people to church well what should
[45:07] I
[45:08] do I need to know but what I do is I
[45:11] have to inquire of God what does God
[45:14] want me to do am if I write the book I
[45:17] don't have much time for anything else
[45:19] right right
[45:21] Hallelujah if I pray for God to pay off
[45:24] the mortgage and some some large money
[45:27] sum comes to me but I've got this other
[45:28] need where do I do what do I do with
[45:30] that I need to know what God wants me to
[45:32] doen Hallelujah I need to know which
[45:35] souls to invite the church amen right
[45:37] praise
[45:39] God so David was undefeated he was in he
[45:42] had an invincible Army whenever he asked
[45:45] God about it this shows us the power of
[45:48] prayer amen hallelujah later when he had
[45:52] the ark he inquired about the famine
[45:53] because of Saul's sins and God answered
[45:57] Hallelujah so again this we get this
[46:00] idea of seeking God seeking God for
[46:03] everything asking God God is there
[46:05] anything different about this year do I
[46:07] need to change something do I need to uh
[46:10] have have something new come in my life
[46:11] do I need a fresh Vision amen amen
[46:16] Lord what what what Lord what do you
[46:19] want me to do about things is there
[46:21] anything that I can do something about
[46:23] that I haven't been doing something
[46:24] about
[46:27] now I just want to bring this out this
[46:29] is this struck my mind this week brother
[46:31] brandom uh wanted to do a world tour so
[46:33] brother Jose I don't know if you
[46:34] remember this but it never
[46:37] materialized so this just goes to show
[46:39] church we can have desires and people
[46:41] around us can be talking about things
[46:43] but it might not
[46:46] materialize so I just want to show you
[46:48] that a prophet of God he said I
[46:50] definitely feel led to have these
[46:51] meetings but they never happened now the
[46:53] thing about that I definitely feel led
[46:56] well there's either one or two things
[46:58] that was just a human leading or was
[47:00] God's leading and then he missed the
[47:01] Mark I choose to believe the first one
[47:03] it probably just a human leading I doubt
[47:05] brother Brandon missed the leading of
[47:06] the Holy Ghost on that he wouldn't had
[47:09] meetings set up where he can preach the
[47:10] vials the trumpets and all these things
[47:12] they never
[47:14] materialize sometimes Church some of the
[47:15] things we plan in life we definitely
[47:17] feel led to do let's not be discouraged
[47:19] amen
[47:21] right ask brother I'm just going to skip
[47:23] down here
[47:24] 1962
[47:28] he said when I come back from overseas I
[47:29] want to go down into Uganda South Africa
[47:32] just make a world tour around trying to
[47:34] be back again by next spring if the Lord
[47:36] willing I like that if the Lord
[47:39] willing and he wants me to continue on
[47:41] trying to evangelize for his
[47:44] glory now here's something I'm going to
[47:45] add for brother Jose too then I aim to
[47:48] do what I've always promise to set the
[47:50] tent in the community where there's no
[47:52] revivals remember brother had the third
[47:55] pole vision and there was a little tent
[47:57] and everybody that walked in there
[47:58] walked out home brother his whole life
[48:00] he thought he was going to set this tent
[48:02] it never
[48:04] happened and I told you my understanding
[48:06] because it was a spiritual tent it was
[48:09] him fasting and praying and preaching
[48:10] the Seven Seals and there was amazing
[48:12] leukemia was healed that week there was
[48:14] over 100 baptisms that's what I believe
[48:16] it was amen I think so but look I's he's
[48:19] Pro I promise you I'm going set that
[48:21] tent but it wasn't a natural tent it was
[48:24] a spiritual tent he set up brother uh
[48:27] let's see he set up eight months later
[48:29] spiritually amen hallelujah I've always
[48:32] promised I'm going to do this but it was
[48:33] a different
[48:35] interpretation how many know he said
[48:37] that by God's grace I'm promising you
[48:40] this but it was actually a spiritual
[48:42] tent not a natural tent yeah the church
[48:45] said there's people that still believe
[48:47] brother's going to raise from the dead
[48:49] come back and set up tents and preach
[48:50] around the world they don't know the
[48:53] quotes yes that's
[48:56] now here brother says this is five
[48:58] months before he died he's still saying
[48:59] this I hope we can have where we can
[49:02] bring all of us together maybe under big
[49:03] tent where I'm feeling really definitely
[49:05] led to preach these seven last vows and
[49:07] he never preached
[49:09] it see church God Is So merciful we feel
[49:13] like something's happening but it's okay
[49:15] if we don't know everything the main
[49:17] thing to do is keep sin out of your life
[49:19] have good habits God will show you the
[49:21] right path hallelujah amen I just wanted
[49:23] you to show you even a prophet can
[49:25] definely feel led to do something but it
[49:27] wasn't the time right or maybe he just
[49:30] had the the wrong understanding of it
[49:31] and that's
[49:33] okay it never
[49:35] materialized all the way the rest of his
[49:37] life he was looking for this tent to
[49:40] uh this tent to
[49:43] manifest and even brother and even as
[49:45] brother Jose knows even when he got
[49:47] healed of that stomach condition he
[49:49] talked about it on the wings of a snow
[49:51] white duve he said I'm going to ride
[49:53] this Trail again and he met or he was
[49:55] saying I'm going to go around the world
[49:56] again he never went around the world
[49:58] [Music]
[50:00] again see but I love it I love brother
[50:03] want to be up and at it praise God I
[50:05] love that he still would have a fresh
[50:07] Vision amen I'm Healed oh God do
[50:10] something with my life amen amen
[50:12] whatever you want me to preach whatever
[50:13] meetings you want me to set up I want to
[50:15] be led to do it and Lord just allow
[50:18] allow what needs to come to pass just
[50:19] work out your perfect will in my life
[50:22] Hallelujah I'm definitely see I I love
[50:25] you know like I can say I told you this
[50:26] I love when I can look and say I
[50:27] definitely felt led to invite that
[50:29] brother and look what happened God would
[50:30] speak to somebody or I definitely feel
[50:32] led I called those meetings in well the
[50:34] Holy Spirit called those meetings in the
[50:35] point that was me that was God using me
[50:38] that wasn't it wasn't me it was God you
[50:40] understand like that was God doing that
[50:43] I felt led to do it now every time I so
[50:45] see every time I I say I'm be led don't
[50:47] make me prophesying
[50:49] okay just like brother R
[50:52] okay sometimes y I feel like it's Le I
[50:55] hope it's
[51:01] l and look brother says yeah brother

[51:39] be like I'm in better shape now I know
[51:40] more about it see he had all these right

[52:47] back to these thousand people it's
[52:49] impossible for me to do it so how do I

[52:57] Amen brother Jess I just don't know how
[52:59] I can accomplish everything let me tell
[53:01] you let me burst your bubble now you
[53:03] can't accomplish everything brother R
[53:05] couldn't accomplish everything but you
[53:06] must accomplish what God has called you
[53:08] to
[53:09] accomplish praise
[53:12] God let's not be a Jonah and leave the
[53:15] will of God and then God's got to spank
[53:18] us to get us back in the will of
[53:19] God and the church said amen
[53:24] hallelujah brother R said uh in
[53:26] desperations he said we're coming back
[53:28] from a or we want to go on a complete
[53:30] World Tour to begin just as soon as we
[53:31] can get it ready but we have to wait for
[53:33] conditions I like that we're waiting for
[53:35] conditions waiting for the time and
[53:37] season says we're fixing to make another
[53:39] world tour it never got
[53:44] one now I got a lot of these quotes here
[53:47] from this book I love this book it's
[53:49] been such a help to me God bless Marcus
[53:50] Becker he's still alive he's such a
[53:52] wonderful brother I never met it but he
[53:54] seemed like a wonderful brother brother
[53:55] to make
[53:56] this so um in 1964 I actually left the
[54:00] book in there but it doesn't matter I
[54:01] already told you I think he started
[54:02] Louisiana and he just stay in the
[54:04] America for the entire year of 64 after
[54:06] saying World Tour World World Tour I
[54:08] definitely feel led it never it never
[54:10] materialized his final trip was in May
[54:13] of 65 to South Africa and remember they
[54:15] wouldn't let him preach and brother R
[54:17] told those ministers the blood of those
[54:19] Souls will be on your hands think about
[54:22] that they wouldn't let him preach cuz
[54:24] they had doctrinal differences against
[54:26] him and he made all that effort to fly
[54:28] over there all all he got to do is just
[54:29] go on hunting
[54:30] trips because of a bunch of
[54:33] denominational uh what is it uh
[54:36] jealousy and all the blood will be on
[54:38] their hands now here's what I want to
[54:41] show with Jose here I think I like this
[54:42] did you ever look at all the brother
[54:44] Ram's commissions that he's been
[54:45] given the first one when he was I was
[54:48] seven years old in
[54:50] 1916 and the commission was don't never
[54:52] smoke or drink or defile your body in
[54:54] any way there'll be a work to do for you
[54:56] when you get older I said that's
[55:00] sacred wouldn't it be wonderful God
[55:02] could visit some our seveny olds how
[55:04] about eight nine or 10 nature how about
[55:07] 10 and give you a commission but now the
[55:10] rest of your life you've got to honor
[55:12] that remind you of anybody like Samson
[55:15] John the
[55:17] Baptist men men that were born under a
[55:21] vow born under a
[55:24] commission so his first one when he was
[55:26] 7 years old then in
[55:29] 1933 believe he's 30 let's
[55:33] see 22 years
[55:36] old he had his first meetings there in
[55:38] 1933 and as as he was baptizing the 17th
[55:42] person he got another commission brother
[55:43] Jose yeah as John was sent to forerun
[55:45] the first coming your message will
[55:47] forerun the second coming of Christ
[55:50] amen
[55:54] hallelujah remember he was only courting
[55:56] hope at this time they weren't they
[55:58] didn't get married till 34
[56:00] 1934 so he he started a church in 1933
[56:03] after after this he started church he
[56:05] was the pastor yet he wasn't married yet
[56:07] he didn't have
[56:08] children how many believe God's a god of
[56:11] Grace I believe it now more than
[56:14] ever in the same Year brother brother
[56:17] Jose when they laid the
[56:20] Cornerstone Hallelujah he saw the vision
[56:22] of the two two trees and the vision said
[56:24] he's got to stand between the
[56:25] trinitarians and the Oneness and God
[56:27] would bring great forth I'm sorry God
[56:29] would bring great fruit out of it and
[56:30] that has happened remember brother's
[56:33] Ministry even history says it started
[56:35] the healing revivals of the 1940s 50s
[56:37] and
[56:39] 60s I believe my mom's healing is a
[56:42] result of brother Brand's Ministry
[56:44] because my mom was in the Assemblies of
[56:46] God and the Assemblies of God honored
[56:48] brother
[56:49] brand amen amen hallelujah I believe
[56:52] that and they the Assemblies of God
[56:54] believe in Divine Healing because of
[56:56] brother
[56:56] [Applause]

[57:25] second Timothy chapter 4 but shall Heap
[57:27] for themselves together teachers having
[57:29] itcher itching ears and shall be turned
[57:31] from the truth to fables if that hasn't

[1:02:23] someday it would come to pass that the
[1:02:25] secrets of the people's heart would be

[1:03:08] with people everywhere and looked like I
[1:03:10] was standing above the people looking
[1:03:12] down where I just made an altar call and
[1:03:13] hundreds and hundreds of people were
[1:03:14] reaping and rejoicing after they
[1:03:16] accepted the Lord Jesus as their savior
[1:03:18] I heard a man say call the prayer
[1:03:21] line he says the people begin to line up
[1:03:23] on this side the uh the left from where
[1:03:26] I was looking down towards a platform
[1:03:27] and they lined up all the way down the
[1:03:29] street for a prayer line and notice to
[1:03:30] my left which would have been to my
[1:03:31] right if I was on the platform a little
[1:03:33] wooden building and I've seen that light

[1:03:45] poll Hallelujah I said why well it won't
[1:03:48] be a public show like the other and I
[1:03:50] came too amen amen now think about that
[1:03:53] if that was the the seven seal meetings
[1:03:56] then it came to pass it wasn't a public
[1:03:58] show God met brother brandom
[1:04:00] individually in that prayer room he
[1:04:02] stayed with the woods family remember
[1:04:03] brother wood his neighbor he stayed with
[1:04:05] him the whole week and he said I sat in
[1:04:07] the room in dark and prayed all day and
[1:04:10] each morning the angel Lord would meet
[1:04:11] me and give me the revelation of the
[1:04:13] Seven Seals praise God amen amen amen
[1:04:17] yes now remember this quote U this is
[1:04:21] the quote I I read last week brother
[1:04:23] random had a signus inection for 9 days
[1:04:25] and he missed the
[1:04:26] sermon and then he asked his wife ma am
[1:04:29] I even called to preach and sister me
[1:04:32] kind of rebuked him remember that people
[1:04:35] a lot of people like that
[1:04:37] online and brother said aren't you glad
[1:04:39] for a faithful wife will tell you the
[1:04:41] truth hallelujah now look what Jesus
[1:04:43] then he saws Jesus and Jesus says you're
[1:04:46] waiting for your new ministry it's the
[1:04:47] third pole to be confirmed to I've
[1:04:49] already confirmed it to you it's already
[1:04:51] confirmed you've got to accept it m God
[1:04:54] had already done hady R's a miracle of
[1:04:56] her two sons being saved that was in 59
[1:04:58] if I'm not
[1:04:59] mistaken God had already showed it to
[1:05:01] him but he had a hard time accepting it
[1:05:03] isn't that true sometimes church God has
[1:05:05] something for us to do but it's hard for
[1:05:07] us to do
[1:05:09] it I wonder if God's trying to get us to
[1:05:12] do something this next year that we've
[1:05:13] been kind of putting off or haven't
[1:05:15] quite understood for a
[1:05:18] while think about that is there anything
[1:05:21] that God's called you to do you haven't
[1:05:23] know yet but you know God's calling you
[1:05:26] to do it or maybe you don't understand
[1:05:28] what God's calling you to
[1:05:30] do thank God there's Mercy thank God God
[1:05:33] is patient with
[1:05:34] us
[1:05:39] hallelujah he said Jesus said you've got
[1:05:41] to accept it in the same way you've got
[1:05:43] to believe it you got to believe in your
[1:05:46] ministry Hallelujah you have to believe
[1:05:48] the word of God that God has revealed to
[1:05:50] your heart yeah praise God I love that
[1:05:56] quote now 1963 brother Raam says this
[1:05:59] Look Away to Jesus right at the end of
[1:06:00] the year he says there's no more doubt
[1:06:02] in my mind so finally after all these
[1:06:03] years God showed him this in 1956 it
[1:06:06] takes all these years seven years now he
[1:06:09] says now there's no more doubt in my
[1:06:11] mind I know what the third poll is I
[1:06:13] know what it
[1:06:15] does
[1:06:18] hallelujah third poll was speaking the
[1:06:20] word of God it was the revelation of
