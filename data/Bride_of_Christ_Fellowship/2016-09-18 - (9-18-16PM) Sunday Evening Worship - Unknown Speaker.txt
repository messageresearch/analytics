prise let's take our Bibles and stand if we can here by God's grace you don't on to Numbers Chapter 20 lot going to take a a different thought tonight I won't be really preaching necessarily on the baptism of the Holy Ghost I kind of feel like I want to go a different direction then maybe get back to that on Wednesday and Sunday Numbers Chapter 20 please I want to um give this an interesting title tonight um thinking about different thoughts and titles from Numbers Chapter 20 like to call this a little message the name calling complex I like to call it that name calling complex like to maybe if I could a subtopic of Ricky and Retta I like to kind of look at that not the Lord has kind of been dealing with me on some certain things I want to look at this here tonight so if you got your Bibles there Numbers Chapter 20 sorry not there yet know recently we looking at the power of the tongue and the power of the words and and we looked at brother BR how he had a battle of the critical spirit and this might tie with it like I said I don't have you know maybe like a full Revelation but I just want to read what brother R says when he talks about mettus um but if you remember in Numbers Chapter 20 um Moses the the people of Israel want water right so God tells them go speak to the Rock and here's what happens here verse 10 numbers 20 verse 10 and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he smokee The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and the beasts also verse 12 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because you believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them this is the water of meah which means Strife because the children of Israel strove with the Lord and he was Sanctified in them praise God so look at this let's bow our heads one more word of prayer Father in Heaven Lord we read your word I pray God just help this to be a blessing to the people Lord here tonight I pray Lord that we can understand it Lord with this complex here that your Prophet talks about and be able to help us all Lord we love you so much in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen amen God bless you being see you here so I want to take this thought tonight looking at the name calling complex we might say and uh trust it be a blessing to you how many remember the message standing in the Gap that brother Brandon preached from 1963 okay some of us remember that um brother brand takes his text uh from number 16 Okay so uh he takes his text and he's talking about how Moses had to stand the gap for Dayan and Kora if you remember numers 16 they said oh you say you're the only holy ones Moses and Aaron we're all holy we can all preach you we can we can all go into the holy place and so we like that and uh Moses the Bible said goes up after he hears this oh and they were they were accusing Moses oh you're the one who's you've called yourself to be a prophet and you you think you're so holy and you you you've put all this together and and Moses was so humble he threw himself in the Gap and the Bible said he fell on his face and cried out for the people but they kept going on they didn't repent of it okay so we know the story they brought they everybody brought a rod in right and the Lord said I'm gonna show who's who I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna bring a resurrection of a dead stick and whoever's Dead stick resurrects that's who's my real priest that's who's my real high priest right whichever Branch brings forth a revel or a resurrection or Revelation that's that's that's my branch okay and it was only Aaron's Rod that budded right and so after that God swallowed up you know Dayan and cor you know swallow up at the Earth and so forth so in that case Moses had the right kind of attitude okay uh for the people he saw the people in an awful condition so what did he do he stood in the gap for them he asked God to intercede for them and help them but in this case it wasn't a time where they could actually repent these people weren't going to repent but he still threw himself in the gap for the people praise God now I want to bring this out too because you know Wednesday night I said that you know I feel like I've just I get if I'm not careful I take it personal when people don't come to church or don't let me know you know why they're not at church or something like that and I take it personally because you know so much of my effort and my time is into the ministry right um and I've learned that that's wrong and so you can you could you know if you wanted to with my wife we could sit down and talk about how um I if I'm not careful I develop a complex about that and it makes me discouraged that's what I mean so a complex will never lead to good fruit it always leads to the wrong thing right a complex is something you build up brother brand says and he asked the church he said how many have a complex he said oh look almost every hands up he said don't ever get a complex and there the whole church is sitting with complexes so it shows we got to do better right right the God's people need to do a better job I think we we need to do a better job and a complex is like this uh it's this uh feeling you build up towards someone or something and it's something you build up uh and whenever that person is brought up or whenever that issue is brought up you have a bad feeling toward it okay uh for example like someone might have a complex with their father or complex about their sister or complex about their family so every time somebody brings up this family member that they have a complex with oh they get all upset you know uh and a comp it's interesting that brother calls it a complex because a complex we'd say like this a stadium complex or a building is a complex and that's scriptural because in second Corinthians I believe it's 10 uh the Bible said we must pull down all the strongholds and the strongholds mean like a castle so the Bible so the Bible literally says that in our minds if we're not careful we let Satan build up a a complex in our minds and we build it up and brother brand said from there you start if Satan has grounds in your mind he uses Satan uses you to attack attack another child of God he said then Satan don't have to fight him because he's already got you fighting him that's awful Place amen we don't want to be there by God's grace don't attack the people of God but I showed you if you Wednesdays ago that brother bradam battled a critical spirit so I just want to briefly read over that real quick um so you'll have that and uh see it there I want you to see uh just kind of exactly the words that he said because as I said this morning he goes and then he he preaches right during right right as he says it okay and it was on a Wednesday night so I'm not sure we even got to hear it by God's grace brother BR said I want to ask the church one more thing before we get some place to studying the scriptures that is that you'll pray for me I developed a critical spirit and it haunts me we're coming up on Halloween time right they talk about haunting right and I heard brother Craigs Bo preach a Ser one time called the haunted house he basically say how you're we're a temple we're a house and and Spirits haunt us right you know if we're not if if we Harbor and don't confess things they haunt us because we haven't confessed something we haven't overcome something so brother man said I've developed a critical spirit and it haunts me and remember he gave the two the two examples okay the one was a woman over in India remember she was claimed to have Divine Healing and she was pulling money uh pulling money from the these poor Indian people and then saying well God will heal you if you give more money and there are dir poor andever she's begging money brother Bram said he started attacking her just criticizing everything that she was doing he said then he got home uh from India because I guess they were there at the same time and he picks up a voice of healing magazine and he starts criticizing everybody in that magazine so the what we saw is that a critical spirit condemns everybody judges everybody except yourself we saw that in the scripture okay so let's read Proverbs 17:20 because this is something that would haunt him he said pray that I'll be get delivered from it so was something it must have been a complex that's why I said I feel like I'm just trying to put these pieces of the puzzle together so you can see it he hadn't been delivered of it he has for prayer from Deliverance of it and it haunts him so maybe it keeps coming back I don't know a little bit tricky to understand there but I think you understand what I'm saying he that at a frower heart findeth no good so there's right there's a critical spirit if you have a a frower which means a crooked heart you findeth no good about things okay and he that have the perverse tongue fth into Mischief all right now remember the Bible said that the Pharisees remember they tried to uh find they try to catch Jesus wrong in what he was saying remember that I know the scripture in front of me but it's kind of comes to my remembrance they their whole idea was to catch him in his sayings and try to find something wrong with him so my dad always told me he said they're always trying to uh religious people always try to find fault with real Christians right because who's the accuser of the brother Satan is Right Satan's accuses of the brother so uh brother B says that and then he goes on to say a little bit further he says but look he said at those poor people lovely people out there following going along with the voice of healing and honest hearted people I look around and see other things that goes on and I start criticizing in my heart I don't want to get that way if I do I lose favor with God so is this a serious thing yes you lose the favor of God upon your life you feel like the heavens are closed to your prayers okay here's what he had to learn he said but I hear this I say who battle is it so when you have a critical spirit you feel like you're the one who has to fight against these people instead of of letting God God fight for you right The Battle Belongs to who I love that song Battle Belongs to the Lord but see brother Bram said I felt like I had to do the battle I like I had to battle AA Allen in the voice of healing or I had to battle This Woman's Ministry and he had to realize whose battle is it he said then God said let the weeds and the wheat grow together the Angels would come and separated at the end times remember Jesus said uproot not the Terrors uh because you get some wheat everybody see that so that's why we don't want to critical spirit we don't want to criticize everybody criticize that church criticize because and what we're just criticizing we're really not doing any good right we're not really doing any good we're just cutting cutting cutting cutting but what about applying some balm like if you're gonna cut somebody you better have some balm to bring some healing right like doctors like Brother Scott would know he's been around doctors you're going to cut somebody you better Stitch it up right you better better apply some uh ointment or whatever more to help it heal and that's and that's what we said as the critical spirit it just cutting people without really trying to help them you just feel like you're the judge or in this case find there's nothing good about them but Jesus said let the blind lead the blind right they both fall in the ditch he said uh and don't try to uproot the tears so don't try to decide who's serpent seed and who's not there's life will show us they are right and as long as they're breathing if God hasn't show me their servant seat I'm going to keep praying even if they have left the message three or four times what's keep praying asking God to do a miracle so they can have a testimony on that day praise God and get saved right at the end he said but instead of criticizing it I need to I will love them anyhow and go on he said just been a constant grind and I'm just human my mental powers are breaking like that and I've got to get away for some rest praise God so now we get more of the picture because he's tired he needs a vacation he needs some time away with the Lord he's under a lot of pressure a lot of traveling he starts criticizing mothers ever get under pre the mothers or fathers ever get under pressure and criticize their children too much right and it can happen to preachers could happen to me it could happen to pastors it happened to brother Brandon happened to brother Brandon he said uh I want to come I want I want it to come from my heart that I really have love for those who are not lovely that Jesus did he said when I was critical when I needed to be criticized still he loves me anyhow amen but said now I'll pray you'll help me take the critical spirit from thy servant Lord so he preaches this full sermon and at the end he said Lord take this critical spirit from your servant if the men are wrong you be the judge let me just love love them anyhow will you father he says how many like that by God's grace I like that so now with that I want to read a few things here and I have my text there with Moses so you understand here I think this will tie in pretty well by God's grace how many ever heard brother brand say Ricky and Retta any never heard that he says it quite a few times I want you to hear when he talks about it on standing in the Gap has anyone heard that lately okay so maybe hope to refresh to you so brother R preaches standing on the Gap and he admits his complex you remember his complex his complex was well I preached the message I go back to the same place a year later and they're worse off than they were and he said if these people won't receive my message then they don't have to hear it anyway he was tempted to go live up in the wilderness remember and just come down when he had thus say the Lord but the holy spirit said you're not a Old Testament prophet he said you're a new testament Prophet with Apostolic gifts that's the Old Testament Prophet the New Testament Prophet stays with the people praise God he's got they got gifts and that's what Apostle does that's what a prophet does they stay there in they're part of the fivefold ministry praise God and then remember God showed him a dream he's driving Billy Paul sleeping he's driving God shows him a dream if he doesn't straighten it out he's going to be like that old man he met in the restaurant there and he repents and then God shows him Seven Mountains and the Seven Peaks and the mountains and so forth he sees that he's got seven letters in his name he feels that's that's God giving him confirmation that he must have a different heart towards people that won't receive his preaching amen and here's what he says in paragraph 159 said in the Gap and these Ricky and retas that have so sassed the words and I've called them Ricky and Retta God give me to understand I shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children oh my now Church did you CCH this he's name calling all these people in denominations now what do we call that today when you put everybody in one group and call them names that's stereotyping right some people stereotype white people some people stereotype police officers some people stereotype black people or Spanish people or Mexican people or whatever people stereotype they love all them together is God pleased with that brother said God didn't wasn't pleased with that God's not pleased with that because he's got children in there and they're not all Ricky and they're not all rickettes so here he is name calling some of God's people stereotyping putting them all together now look now look what brother man says God would have me to understand I shouldn't do that so God let him know he shouldn't do that they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold foral churches has got them that Spirit upon them and they're in his in prison as Israel was in prison just as much as Moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that love Jesus Christ and would serve him if they only know what to serve him by amen and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them you don't do this and you don't do that praise God isn't that wonderful can everybody see that by God's grace you see how we in the message have to be careful not to be critical and not to name call Brother B I'm going to share something too last week we were sitting at a table remember and somebody called uh somebody called all the Seminary preachers idiots remember that do you remember that I okay and it just grieved I didn't say nothing it just grieved me I thought oh I was wondering why you know basically somebody's making it sound like all men that go to Seminary are idiot OT and that that grieved me church because there it wasn't for God's grace I would have been one in there and then God would had to call me out of there but uh they're not they're not all like that God has foolish virgin in there and God apparently must have bride still there because we're still here and Revelation 18 it says come out of her my people come out of Babylon come out of denominations of my people so we shouldn't so Godless brother no you shouldn't call my people shouldn't call my people but what does he talking about that sermon I developed the complex I preach it they won't live it I preach it they won't live fine they don't have to hear I'll go up in the wilderness and God has to say no you won't do that so see what a complex can bring it brings about name calling and I constantly got to watch my children as all parents know my children have to be careful not to name call that's not a that's not a pleasing thing to God it's not pleasing to say all pastors are like this or all preachers are like this all women are like this all men are like that that's not pleasing to the Lord because he might have some servants in that group and we don't want to call them names now he says but the call of God must come to them whosoever wants to March toward the promised land let him March amen so all these people that are in denominations have to hear a call whoever wants to March for Jesus come march with Christ amen we're on our road to the promised land amen let them come March we're on a road to meet Christ at the end time and I wanted to bring this to you so you would see and show that the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere amen so what is brother ra he's showing he's just he's bearing his soul to us isn't he he's showing us his his very this is how he is this is this these are the these are the battles he had he battled a critical spirit he battled name calling God let me know I shouldn't call him that so he shows this is how I was sincere yet I made a mistake he's sincere because what he go goes to preach then goes to preach goes to preach goes to preach brings the message even though they don't want to hear it brings him the message but then if he's not careful he said he loses the feeling of the people how many remember that he lost the feeling of the people in other words he stopped having compassion upon the people remember Jesus looked out on the multitude and what the Bible say he looked at them with compassion because they were sheep without a Shepherd is that right so and then since van and I sat there and witnessed that and you know then different things this week I like I really need to preach this I feel like I really need to preach this um because we we can't group all those people together some of them might be children of God if somebody would have blasted the all those Assemblies of God they're just a bunch of heathen worldly people and yet here I was sitting right in the church and I don't want to I don't want to be Heathen I want of God's children praise the Lord I I don't want to be called that and God has let brother R know I still got children in there don't call them Ricky and ricettas name call remember in the power of your words is what life and death life and death do you say well I don't like this or unlike that or this always do this or people like this always do this always do that you're creating the wrong atmosphere that's a negative atmosphere that's not a a positive atmosphere where where there's Faith there there's no faith there that's just complaining that's criticizing right now he goes on a few more paragraphs he says and all these years I've tried to serve him with with a pure heart and I won't go out there being a hypocrite so he says right now he's feels like he would be a hypocrite if he went and tried to preach and evangelized outside of random Tabernacle this is in June of 1963 so you you must have got victory over this right at some point because he says I can't go back out there unless I get the feeling for the people back I got to feel that that it isn't Ricky and Retta and it isn't this Bunch it's God children that's in bondage and I must go to them until I can feel that way I'll just have to loaf around preach some conventions and things but wait praise God how many heard that is that new to anybody Ricky and Ricket us God let his Prophet understand we shouldn't name call and we shouldn't group everybody together in like stereotypes and so forth so now let's go back to the scripture and let's look at it's something with prophets and name calling must be the Zeal of God it must be the the the office that they hold right but look at look back in numbers 20 verse 11 and Moses and er gathered the congregation before the rock okay now I'm I'm sorry let's go back to verse eight because this is what the Lord tells Moses in 20 verse 8 take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water what was the direction was a direction to speak or Smite speak speak to the Rock and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their Beast drink God gave very specific directions you're a prophet of God Moses Aaron you're the priest you speak to the Rock and it'll bring forth water is that right now look let's finish verse 10 and Moses and Aaron gathered the the congregation before them I'm sorry together before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock what's he do church he calls them names he calls you bunch of rebels brother R would call you bunch of Rick and retas right you bunch of rebels do we have to bring water out of this rock and notice he puts himself into it like he has something to do with it this is a very serious sin if you know the Bible this is a this is a very serious sin Moses commits here look at the next few verses and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he smot The Rock twice now what is that type that types how Christ had to be smitten because brother man preaches is that in the indictment right Christ is the rock well he was smitten once but here the scripture says he had to be smitten twice he was crucified once 2,000 years ago but the Bible said he's crucified again in Hebrews 6 he's crucified today by trotting under the the the try trting underf foot the Son of God aresh just saying oh I won't live I won't let this Blood cleanse me I don't have to live a holy life when you Tred under the word of God and the Holy Ghost for your day it's crucifying the effects of the Holy Ghost to you amen so if you haven't listen to indictment I listen to indictment you brothers would want to do that if you haven't done that that's where this type is fulfilled Christ was smitten twice he was crucified in 2,000 years ago and and then the effects of the word the message has been crucified today to the effects of the people you understand what I'm saying the message lives on but the the message can't get to the people because the preachers have hindered the move of it amen it's been crucified it's been Trot Under Foot but like Austin's mom was telling me yesterday how come I never heard of brother how come I never heard of the mess churches I can say the same thing how come I never heard of it because it's been crucified it's been bad Mound and now they people don't even talk about they don't even now most preachers don't even know about but the old timers do because God was with them God Vindicated his ministry brother Kevin sends me he's we've talked numerous times he sent me a text this week that he met another man who knew brother Brandon's Ministry and was raised in a mess his church and all these things there's of course there's pockets of people out there that know about it but as time goes on fewer and few fewer and fewer people know about it so thank God we got the tapes and we got the videos to show that this was a true man of God he tells your name and your address and the streets you're on and all these things like that that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen now look at verse 12 this is so serious the fact you get up there and call them you bunch of rebels look you had the wrong feeling towards his church didn't he God never said call them name call them and God never said smile it she must have been really angry right smoke the rock twice now brother brandom said God honored Moses's gift and let water come out but because he was A Gifted Man because God never said Smite it he said speak to it but Moses must have knew he had a gift of God with the rod right because he held the rod and to split the Red Seas God so honored it and water still came out even though he Smit it because he was A Gifted Man and brother Bram gives the example of Eli call down she bearss against children God honored the prophet's word but that wasn't the right thing to do he honored his office yet he did the wrong thing so see a prophet can step out of the per the perfect will of God and get into the permissive will of God too just like you and I does that make sense but said that's not of God for she Bears to Maul children just for saying oh Baldhead oh Baldhead oh Baldhead that's what they were doing brother man says because their parents weren't teaching them the right way in their homes their bad mouthing El Elisha their bad mouthing Elisha in their homes and because of that Elisha got upset and God had to honor his gift just like here God has to honor Moses's gift water comes but that wasn't the way God said all right now look at verse 12 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because you believe me not let's stop right there what didn't they believe they believe in God they still believe in Jehovah but God says perfect obedience is really believing me praise the Lord perfect obedience is actually believing me they believed in God but God said you didn't believe me other words you didn't do what I told you to do you didn't keep the directions to a te you didn't dot the eye and cross the te right you didn't do it Faithfully because you believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation in the land which I've given unto them now they didn't sanctify God which means they didn't set apart God and really they didn't make the miracle look like it was from God who do you make it look like it was from him and Aaron and brother BR picks this up and said Moses glorified himself with this instead of glorifying God and just speaking to the Rock he has to have something to do with you bunch of rebels Bam Bam and brother B said that's a man glorifying himself look what I can do I can bring this I have this gift in my life oh my so because he glorifies himself what's he kept out of the promis land what is that type today we preached on that recently the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's an interesting thought anyone with the gift of God that they glorify themselves with the gift of God can't be born again I say like that that now doesn't that open up Matthew 7 where they say Lord Lord have we not prophesied and Jesus said I never knew you they Jesus didn't say they didn't have gifts but I wonder who got the glory when they spoke in tongues or prophesied who got the glory did Christ or did the church or the individual that's pretty good praise God because they glorified because Moses and Aaron glorified themselves name called the people God says you can't go into the Promised Land that's quite that's quite a that's quite a judgment that God gives you didn't sanctify me you didn't make me look like the one that was holy set me apart and show and let me show The Glory you you Sanctified yourself you made yourself you set yourself apart you made it look like it was you because remember what did he say must we fetch you water this Ro we no man can bring water out of a rock right it wasn't we it was God it was he not we amen it was he but they he glorified himself well because I'm called of God I've got the gift of God I could do whatever I want bunch of rebels and here brother brandom 3,000 years later said I'm name calling God's people there some of them that are God's people I shouldn't do that can you see the similarities there both prophets both spoke with thus sayi the Lord both had Supernatural signs wonders and miracles and both named called some people of God now go to uh Psalms 106 the people were not innocent either I mean it's true Moses you know did the wrong thing but look look what the Bible says about this Psalms 106 I love how I love how you know God gives more Revelation and more insight on scripture all throughout the Bible so you can't just read one chapter and think you got it all figured out out you know you got to keep reading Psalms 10632 the church like I said I'm bringing this out because like I said I've had complexes I've I've taken things personally and it meant a lot to me and then brother bang and I sit there and hear things like that I think oh we don't want that because that will start Glory well look at us we don't go to Seminary it didn't come to that but I don't want it to come to that brother van you understand what I'm saying we sit there and hear that we don't ever want to exalt ourselves we don't want to glorify us because who are we who are we we're just humans we're just we're just people that need God every hour praise God we're not the judges we're supposed to judge ourselves that the word judge us but we're not to get a critical spirit and condemn everybody else except ourselves and we're not to name call either all right Psalms 10632 they they angered him also at the Waters of strife remember maraba means Strife so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips a't that something right there my goodness that's powerful Moses I mean he had every right to say the people are wrong they're the ones stirring me up and it's their fault could brother say the same it's their fault they keep cutting their hair those men keep dabbing into sin and all these kind things like it's their fault I'm the I'm the one trying to serve God up here but because of their complaining it caused him to do something and say something unadvisedly too you rebels you name call he named Cs and said we are going to bring do we have to bring water from the rock it wasn't Moses and Aaron it was God going to bring water so yes the people would provoke him but this shows us the same thing too just because uh somebody makes you mad you can't say well you made me mad so I can be mad from now on that's Moses are you with me I've heard so many people say that I had a teacher one time walked into my class a professor no it was a okay I was a teacher not a professor it was a teacher of a class I was in one time I think probably remembers and uh this teacher was was all upset during class and he looked over at his son and said you're the reason I'm upset and everybody starts laughing but really I thought of this I thought no one has the power over you to make you mad because we can cast down all Spirits praise God no one can force you to do that look at this Moses let himself get weak right and because he let that get to him he started name calling but what he should have done he should have went and stood in the gap for them right right just like he did earlier right he did he did that numerous times for Israel standing in the Gap so instead of complaining about people what do we got to do pray for them gotta pray for them is this good is this good tonight by God's grace seeing how brother brandom had you know a critical spirit CR criticizing everybody but feeling like he had to battle everybody and now he starts name well he named call for years and God let them know he shouldn't do that he shouldn't do that and now he see in the scripture Moses bow the same thing and he was kept uh Moses was kept out of the promised land now I want to just bring this down to the close here and I want to say this I found the word Retta six times after standing in the gap and there's a reason I'm saying that God had showed him he shouldn't say that but yet he would he kept he kept saying a few more times there's a lot of sermons you know after June of 63 there's quite a few sermons actually maybe 80 or 100 or something along those lines um but I'm just letting you know he shouldn't he he God showed him he shouldn't do it but every now and then he'd slip up and do it praise God so what does that show you what does it show me well it tells us we're all human right and battles we have God shows us they're wrong sometimes they might come back and haunt us can I say like that does the bible say that though the Bible says you know with demon Spirits once they're once they get off you what they do they try to come back and I'm not saying you know I'm not sure how many I'm not sure how many demons or whatever would come back on us or whatever more I'm just saying when we get over something Satan likes to try to bring it back he even called his own daughter Rebecca a rietta he said she's at that ricketta age the Tian age and God and she was a daughter of God right love the Lord serve the Lord mother George Smith there and he calls his own daughter Rett so you see it gives us an understanding that once we get victory over something we have to keep the victory over it and we must watch the words of our mouth praise God they're so important uh to watch it at all times now let's turn to one more scripture here I want to uh look at another scripture by God's grace Matthew 5 let's go back to Matthew 5 going back to our our tongues and the conditions of our heart here hey Matthew 5 verse 21 was it a serious thing that Moses name called yes kept him out of the very it kept them out of finishing his commission did not his commission was to take them out in order to bring them in right to the promised land because brother man said Redemption is not a one-step process it's three justification sanctification and then baptism of the Holy Ghost well Moses only got to two of them he wasn't able to finish his commission say it like that but oh yeah oh brother said this too but because God is so gracious amen hallelujah 1500 years he said God was so gracious to Moses God let Moses back in the promised land when Moses met Jesus on Mount Transfiguration hallelujah amen Glory Hallelujah that's the grace of God God had given him the commission to take him in but because he glorified himself exalted himself made himself the big shot name called upset with the people spoke the wrong thing God didn't let him see it in his we'd say his his first life so he see it in the the next one striking is that striking 521 you have heard it that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the Judgment but I say to you that what's whosoever is angry with his brother without a call should be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother Rocka shall be iner of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool be in danger of Hellfire so Jesus said just by calling people fooling names you can be a danger of going to hell praise God Rocka means you empty-headed you senseless person so if you call someone you senseless you empty head or knucklehead or whatever he said you're in danger of going to a counsil of men like cor but when he says when you say fool now fool means a Godless person right it's like calling somebody a devil you have no God in you you fool for us it's like oh you they're just serpent see they're just they're lost and they're a wasted cause and everything like that Jesus said you're in danger of Hellfire when you start calling people that remember the Bible said God is not far from each one of us it says that in act 17 in him we live and move and have our being and he be not far from each one of us why because brother BR said he's trying to press in and trying to press into our lives because he wants to save people God would that all men be saved how know that's the scripture his love is so great his compassion is so great he trying to get into people's lives he's tearing amen as we heard this morning he's waiting my what a what a what a thought do you like that thought tonight amen let's go one more Matthew 12 we'll close after this by God's grace I told you I'm G to try to keep it shorter Matthew 1236 and also I want to say this too I need to email the brother so I'll try to do that right afterwards in the past we've had we've had sister services this is before uh the RS came so this is probably like in 2008 to 2012 and uh you before we read this what happened at sister Services I would I would pray and I invite an elderly sister and give a testimony I think we we might did that one time yeah over there um so for example I called sister Brooks from Iowa brother Brooks brought her and then she brought and had his wife uh sister SAS I can't first name I just said it yesterday Alice and Alice gave a wonderful testimony to the sisters and she said she was so refreshed after that and so forth it was really great time in the Lord but now um another brother does sister meetings and they and they have all sisters come and preach I'm all these sisters come to meeting and they have a brother preach to them like it's happening in a few weeks um over there in Pennsylvania at a church so I I'll email the brothers and ask them about that if the brothers and the reason behind it is to refresh the sisters like my wife watching the kids all the time it might be nice for her to just have a whole service and sit in there and hear the word of God God so I'd have to watch the six kids you know I call like a Godly Man to come preach to the sisters or something like that um so that's some that's a thought I had by God's grace so and also uh in PM Services we've done children Bible studies in the past remember when we had all the children sit up front um and really kind of focus our teaching right to them so I want to pray about that too because I really want to I really want to make the most of this time that we have on Sunday nights uh to kind of minister to different needs in the church you know so I know I know Lydia would love to sit by Sarah you know and Mali love to sit up here some of little boys come you know so those are two things I want to mention and I'll email you about that by God's grace I want to make sure I mention those before we finish Matthew 12:36 praise God let's say praise the Lord ready praise the Lord okay 36 and 37 but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by Thy Word words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned amen so it's important what we say right let's stand to our feet here by God's grace it's important what we call people it's important uh how we stereotype right it's good not to stereotype rightless you stereotype the bride and say oh she's all wased the blood they're all a bunch of Blood Washed Christians am Glory that's true that's one stereotype that'll work amen but is it a serious thing church it's very very important God showed a prophet you don't call names we don't stereotype people together we don't make fun of white people we don't make fun of black people we don't make fun of Asian people we don't make stereotypes like that we honor all God's people praise the Lord and now looking at churches we honor all churches not I'm I'm not talking about satanic churches we honor all Christian churches we should give honor and respect and not try to lump them together do we have to preach against their sin absolutely they're false Doctrine absolutely but to name call and call them when we start calling names and criticizing and we get the wrong spirit and so I want to share that too I feel like sometimes I get the wrong spirit I feel I feel upset with people in the church if they don't you know come to church and serve God like they ought to and that's wrong with me and it'll slip out when I'm preaching and I don't like that it slipped out when brother Brandon was preaching when he had he called names um and I might not call names but I get I just kind of get up upset so please pray for me let's bow our heads and in this prayer if you pray for me and I'll pray for you that you don't that that we uh call people the right things let's have hope for people praise God let's have patience with people let's give them time you know let's give God some time to work with them let's not try to stereotype and group all people together act like we're the judge or something like that let's pray here father we thank you Lord for your grace tonight we thank you for this word that we've heard father I thought it was so important after last weekend Lord and brother bang and I sitting there um and then hearing that this week Lord hearing your Prophet say these things and knowing in my heart that I battle complexes and Lord as your Prophet said we we all battle them we want to be free from complexes but as we even heard sometimes they'll try to come back as we saw with the prophet saying Ricky and Retta again after the the sermon standing in the Gap Lord uh I I want to say that this message really gives me a lot of awareness of your grace you're able to be gracious you were gracious to Moses amen you still let him come in the promised land you were gracious to brother brandom and even told him he had a great portion of Heaven that awaited him yet he struggled with criticism and name calling and Lord in my heart I struggle with hurt feelings and I've built up complexes in the past God I need you to help me Lord Jesus I felt so good today I feel like you gave me victory over the last few days but I'm praying for future Lord God praying for the future that I would not fall back into this again I wouldn't take it personal but I'd be able to love Lord if I have a question reach out and ask the individual Lord God if I'm wondering something I need to talk to about it with somebody help me not to speak unadvisedly with with my lips Lord if someone tries to provoke people in the church or us on the job or whatever help us to respond with the right words Lord with the spirit of love a soft answer turneth away wrath amen help us to pray for those who use us pray for those who despitefully use us and speak Evil all all evil manner against us Lord God that we might be the children of God for God lets the sunrise on the just of the unjust he gives rain to the just of the unjust he gives meat to The Sinner of the saint Lord you're so kind help us to be Children of the highest the most high god thank you for this message Lord it even reminds me as I pray it reminds me even of racism Lord it reminds me of anyone that would look down upon other people Lord with a prideful heess oh God help us never to have that dear God I've been so thankful Lord my life my parents were never racist and I never had to really battle that I love people of all skin color Lord all backgrounds and they have so much to offer the the body of Christ there's so much to give to the body of Christ even racist or even sexist Lord Brother brandom said women have such an easier way of letting go and getting in the spirit and than men and even about African-Americans brother BR said they're so much more gifted than the white man Lord in different ways we all have different giftings and abilities Lord help us to never have any critical spirit I just pray let our words be full of life when Satan tries to provoke us may we resist him for when we resist Satan he will flee from us us thank you Lord help me to resist the enemy Lord and he'll fee from me in Jesus Christ's name bless our time here as we close Lord bless the Saints heart for coming out and I pray they were blessed by these words tonight Lord it was such a thing on my heart I just felt like I had to deliver it tonight dear God it's so important too to see that that Moses what he lost because he let people put him in the wrong Spirit instead of having rued over his own Spirit In Jesus Christ's name the church said amen I got one more scripture BL can you put U I just want to put this one up here real quick Proverbs uh 2528 this is the one that this is kind of
