[0:00] And uh man, I can't do that like I used
[0:03] to. I had to get my ladder out and I had
[0:04] to climb down and climb in this time.
[0:07] And I'm
[0:09] like, wow.
[0:11] Um I'm not a young man anymore. Um but
[0:14] we're very close to becoming young
[0:17] again. Uh so and um keep brother Jose in
[0:22] prayer. He has to listen to the sermon
[0:23] again here. He caught me out there. He
[0:26] just started pulling things out. I was
[0:28] going to minister. I'm
[0:29] like, so he's already heard probably
[0:32] half of this. So, I had something ready
[0:34] to go uh kind of and then my computer
[0:37] shut down. That's only happened once
[0:38] before. So, I'm going all inspiration
[0:40] today. So, I'm not captain
[0:43] inspiration. This is not my forte. Uh
[0:46] you know, but uh brother Bam said he
[0:48] said we're not we're not here to teach
[0:50] the gospel. We're to preach the gospel.
[0:52] So maybe the Lord wants me to start
[0:54] going off of teaching and going this and
[0:56] this, but maybe into more inspiration
[0:58] and preaching by God's grace. So I feel
[1:00] completely helpless up here. I have
[1:02] nothing really to lean on except the
[1:04] little notebook brother Malachi gave me.
[1:06] I have some things scribbled down and
[1:07] that's that's about it. So uh we'll be
[1:10] interested to see what the Lord has to
[1:12] speak here. I know something inside me
[1:15] is burning. Uh we share with brother
[1:16] Jose um before
[1:19] service. probably say a lot of the same
[1:21] things, but this is just something
[1:22] that's really weighing on my heart. And
[1:28] um I'd like to say this that when Jesus
[1:32] came the first
[1:33] time, the Bible says that Jesus Christ
[1:36] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:39] forever. Right? We know those things. In
[1:42] other words, God never changes.
[1:47] So if God can't
[1:49] change, what can he
[1:53] do? He can only give more
[1:57] revelation or magnify his word. He in
[2:01] other words, wow, we have we have this.
[2:04] This is fantastic. This is the word. And
[2:06] you take a magnifying glass.
[2:09] I think I actually got you guys some old
[2:12] old uh magnifying uh things from a
[2:15] dumpster one time. Did I give those long
[2:17] long time ago? I was in a dumpster at a
[2:19] a college and they were throwing away
[2:21] science little uh what do they call
[2:22] those little microscopes and I jumped in
[2:25] the dumpster, grabbed those things. I
[2:26] think I gave it so what you could when
[2:29] so when they looked at like a little
[2:30] bug, they could go out there and they
[2:31] could magnify it and see it close. So
[2:33] they'd be able to see the deeper the
[2:35] finer details of the insect. So if God
[2:39] can't add or take away or if he can't uh
[2:42] change his word or anything but what one
[2:44] one thing he can do is he can actually
[2:46] magnify it.
[2:49] Well brother Sai alls we need is what
[2:51] brother Brham said. Yeah but Jesus said
[2:54] he would magnify.
[2:56] So we can go in the message and look but
[2:59] if you have that Holy Spirit he will
[3:01] start to magnify things and you'll start
[3:03] to understand the det. You're not going
[3:04] to see surface anymore. you're going to
[3:07] see the finer
[3:09] details.
[3:11] Anyhow, we trust this will be a
[3:13] blessing. Uh, Abra Mal, I'm not going to
[3:15] sing. Thank you for leading songs and uh
[3:17] uh playing the piano.
[3:20] Um, so where we start here? Let's
[3:24] um bring greetings from Pastor
[3:27] Cam. Uh I I was actually planning on
[3:29] having a nice day off today and I have
[3:31] to minister and go certain places here
[3:34] and those things. I was kind of tired. I
[3:36] wasn't feeling the best. Um but um by
[3:40] God's grace, we're here. We're in
[3:41] service. Um brother Jess uh text me and
[3:46] said, "Brother, can you?" I said, "I
[3:47] can't." So we were we were always
[3:49] willing to come at a moment moment's
[3:51] notice to be a
[3:54] blessing. And however the service goes,
[3:56] I don't want you to lean on what I'm
[3:58] saying, but I just want the Holy Spirit
[4:00] to speak. That is the key to
[4:04] everything, right? What the what what
[4:07] the Holy Spirit impresses upon your
[4:09] heart, what he brings to your mind, what
[4:11] he brings to your remembrance, what he
[4:13] uh would show you, then that's uh then
[4:15] that's for you. Okay? I I I am at a
[4:19] certain spot. I think brother Jose has
[4:20] been the message longer than I have, but
[4:22] each one of us have we've been uh we're
[4:24] at a certain we're all individual
[4:25] levels, okay? We're at uh different
[4:28] heights in uh in life. Everyone's more
[4:32] mature or less mature or certain this or
[4:35] certain that. We're all growing in the
[4:37] grace of God, right? But the main
[4:38] important thing is that we're growing,
[4:40] right? We're maturing. Hey, maybe maybe
[4:42] physically you've stopped growing maybe
[4:44] early or however, but as long as I keep
[4:47] maturing, right? That is what God's
[4:49] looking for is mature. He's not coming
[4:51] for a a wife that's just a babe or young
[4:54] girl, but he's looking for what? for a
[4:56] mature woman. Right? So, anyhow, let's
[4:59] say let's stand for the reading of the
[5:00] word here. I've got some highlights here
[5:03] that
[5:04] uh uh I had on my laptop there. I got a
[5:07] I did bring this the tree of knowledge
[5:09] of evil up here just for the good part.
[5:11] Um we know how dangerous that is. Uh but
[5:15] I do want to be able to read a couple
[5:16] quotes. It'll be a blessing to you and
[5:20] uh we trust this will be a blessing. So,
[5:25] um, now remember I'm fresh off of a
[5:27] wedding. Uh, last night seeing my nephew
[5:32] there get
[5:34] married and a lot of hard things. Saints
[5:38] of God, knowing what we know is very
[5:40] difficult. This is not easy. This is
[5:42] not. You can go to something that's
[5:44] supposed to be rejoicing and happy and
[5:46] joyful. Uh but the things that God has
[5:49] revealed to
[5:52] us is a struggle. Sometimes it's a
[5:55] struggle. It's a battle to
[6:00] um knowing what we know,
[6:03] right? Matthew 5 verse
[6:12] one. Matthew 5 vers1. I wish I had a
[6:15] PowerPoint because I'd love to show this
[6:16] to you. Oh, we we got some we at least
[6:18] we got the scriptures up here by God's
[6:19] grace. We'll try. I think
[6:21] sister and uh verse one. And seeing the
[6:25] multitudes, he went up into a
[6:28] mountain. And when he was set, his
[6:32] disciples came unto him. Notice Jesus
[6:36] departed from the
[6:38] multitudes. He left the
[6:40] masses. he left the great crowds of
[6:45] people. Um he was ready to enter into
[6:49] his
[6:50] ministry and he sees all this vast
[6:53] people and he said this isn't for
[6:55] everybody. This isn't in this isn't for
[6:58] uh just the regular uh a nominal
[7:01] Christian. Uh and then notice what he
[7:04] says. And when he was set his disciples
[7:06] came unto him. So notice he the as he
[7:09] sat there he climbed up high to a
[7:11] mountain. His disciples followed him in
[7:14] that mountain. They had to climb up with
[7:16] him. They had to walk up with him to
[7:18] higher heights.
[7:20] Right? And he opened his mouth and he
[7:23] taught them saying, "So if you have
[7:26] heard this word, come up into the
[7:28] mountain with us this morning,
[7:31] right? Because he's going to show us
[7:33] things right here."
[7:36] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[7:38] saying, "Blessed is the poor in spirit,
[7:41] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[7:43] Let's say a word of
[7:45] prayer. Let's bow our heads. Lord, we
[7:48] Lord Jesus, Lord, we approach your
[7:49] throne of grace and
[7:52] mercy. And Lord Jesus,
[7:55] Lord, I just, you know, I just heard
[7:58] someone say to me the other day,
[8:00] hindsight is
[8:01] 2020. And Lord Jesus, Lord, we are so
[8:04] grateful Lord for Lord Jesus just
[8:07] obeying your spirit. Uh just being
[8:10] yielded to thy Holy
[8:12] Ghost. And Lord, we know Lord, I can
[8:15] take comfort, Lord. Though I may not
[8:16] have a laptop and my notes, Lord, I can
[8:18] take comfort, Lord, that the footsteps
[8:20] of the righteous are ordered. And Lord
[8:22] Jesus, Lord, it's not by chance, Lord.
[8:25] We know everything's forained, Lord.
[8:28] Everything is predestinated, Lord. And
[8:30] Lord Jesus, we love you for that, God.
[8:32] We can take full comfort, Lord, because
[8:34] we have that revelation. We have that
[8:35] understanding, God, Lord, deep within
[8:38] us, planted in us, Lord God. Lord,
[8:39] knowing, Lord, that nothing can take
[8:41] place unless you allow it,
[8:43] Lord. And Lord Jesus, we are grateful.
[8:46] We're thankful. And Lord Jesus, Lord,
[8:48] give us strength, God. Lord, this
[8:51] morning, Lord, bless every soul that
[8:53] pushed the way out, Lord. Those that
[8:54] couldn't, Lord, be with Pastor Jesse,
[8:56] Lord, Sister Christian, Lord, bring
[8:58] forth a healthy baby girl, God. maybe
[9:00] even taking place right now, Lord, on
[9:03] Mother's Day. And Lord Jesus, Lord, we
[9:07] want your grace to shine upon everyone,
[9:09] Lord, to all those, Lord. Your mercies
[9:11] to be upon every soul, Lord God. We love
[9:14] you, Lord. We thank you, God. Lord
[9:16] Jesus, Lord, just bless the hearers,
[9:18] Lord, of this morning, Lord. I place my
[9:19] hands fully into you, Lord. I have
[9:21] nothing to lean on but you, Lord, right
[9:23] now. And Lord God, we ask God that they
[9:25] would uh not try and look at a vessel,
[9:28] not look at a hear my voice, Lord, but
[9:30] Lord, to hear what the spirit would say.
[9:32] And Lord Jesus, Lord, we know everything
[9:34] Lord comes by revelation. Lord, just
[9:36] bless the people, Lord. Strengthen them,
[9:38] Lord, this morning. Lord, if there's
[9:40] anything on their hearts, Lord, prayer
[9:41] requests, Lord, desires, Lord,
[9:43] thoughts, Lord, we ask, God, Lord, that
[9:46] you would be with them, Lord. We
[9:47] certainly love and appreciate, Lord, in
[9:49] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may
[9:51] have your seats, sir.
[9:54] Excuse
[10:04] me. Well, fresh off of a, like I said, a
[10:07] wedding last night.
[10:10] And as we're sitting at this wedding, we
[10:13] went through the rehearsal. We watched
[10:14] the the nuptuals go forth, the IDs, the
[10:20] uh amens, the the la the first kiss, uh
[10:24] the the putting on of the tokens, the
[10:27] pouring of the ritual of the sand there,
[10:28] however they want to do it, however. And
[10:30] then of course then
[10:33] um we went to
[10:35] the the u not the rehearsal but the
[10:40] reception there and then
[10:44] uh you know you're blessed people.
[10:48] you're really blessed people because let
[10:50] me say like
[10:51] this and I'm not trying to point drop
[10:54] anything or say anything negative or
[10:56] anything but you know a difference
[10:58] between a real holy marriage and a
[11:02] denominational one. I'll say it like
[11:05] this. We saw brother Austin, sister Lena
[11:08] get married over there. That was a
[11:11] powerful that was a real
[11:13] reverent
[11:14] holy marriage. And uh we witnessed a
[11:18] really good thing there. Um then to see
[11:22] then on the other flip side we see
[11:23] worldly music, we see dancing, we see
[11:25] cutting up, we see those sort of things
[11:28] which is you know not to their fault.
[11:30] They don't have a revelation yet by
[11:32] God's grace. We're saying yet by God's
[11:34] grace um we love all the individuals. We
[11:36] love everyone. Um but we want we want to
[11:40] see a further work. So
[11:44] um in this sermon I don't know if I have
[11:46] a title here. I would say maybe
[11:49] um coming maybe we could title this uh
[11:53] coming to the revelation of the word by
[11:56] God's grace. Maybe we'll title like
[11:58] that. Uh I'm just kind of going to glean
[12:00] a little bit. U I think brother Malachi
[12:03] and sister Aacia there saw the listen to
[12:05] the how the pastor brought forth the
[12:07] word yesterday in the midst of the
[12:10] ceremony and this and that. Of course,
[12:11] they have a couple things wrong uh on
[12:15] that. Um, but one thing I really liked,
[12:18] you know, you can glean a lot off of any
[12:20] ministry of of any sermon, whether it be
[12:23] denominational or not, but saints of
[12:24] God, one thing I like what he said is uh
[12:27] because they ended
[12:29] uh uh they ended with Matthew 7. Okay?
[12:35] Uh but look in here, this is actually
[12:37] the start of it. I never really caught
[12:38] that till he said that. I was like, "Oh,
[12:40] that's powerful." Now, did they have
[12:41] revelation? No, they have revelation.
[12:43] But as he said, he was bringing this
[12:45] forth because this started here on a
[12:47] mountain. These are called the
[12:48] biatitudes. This is where God, he says
[12:51] he he did not want to reveal these
[12:53] things. In other words, these are hidden
[12:55] revelations to only what? His real
[12:58] disciples. Right? So in this notice we
[13:01] he went up to a mountain and he opened
[13:05] his mouth. When God opens his mouth, we
[13:07] better listen. When God's bringing forth
[13:09] his word, we better listen, right?
[13:12] because he brings nothing forth in vain.
[13:14] There's nothing that he speaks that not
[13:16] should not have been spoken. And
[13:18] everything we know, in fact, if you
[13:19] study the scriptures, if you understand
[13:21] original sin, everything to deal with
[13:24] the original sin takes place in Genesis
[13:26] 1. He sets the stage on the first sorry
[13:30] on the fifth day and the sixth day. On
[13:32] the fifth day and the sixth day,
[13:34] everything that is taking place right
[13:36] now started because of what he did on
[13:39] the fifth day and the sixth day. Saints
[13:40] of God, that's how powerful the word of
[13:43] God is, right, saints of God. So what
[13:47] what God brought forth on the fifth day
[13:49] is powerful. But what he withheld on the
[13:52] sixth day, that first part of the sixth
[13:54] day, when he in fact, let me just
[13:56] rehearse this real quick for you. On the
[13:59] fifth day, God on the fifth day, God
[14:01] brought forth the fowls of the air. He
[14:03] brought the fishes of the sea, all those
[14:06] creatures. We see the eagle, the mighty
[14:08] eagle which is a representation what of
[14:10] the bride in this last day of a of
[14:12] Christ himself. He said he was what were
[14:14] under the wings of Jehovah that mighty
[14:16] eagle, right? And of course we know uh
[14:19] even God bringing forth the whale for
[14:22] Jonah and a prepared fish. The Bible
[14:24] said those fish and you know God told
[14:26] them what he spoke on the fifth day. The
[14:28] Bible said he blessed them. Amen. So
[14:31] there's a blessing upon the fish.
[14:33] There's a blessing upon the birds.
[14:36] There's a blessing upon those things.
[14:37] Amen. So, but notice on the sixth day
[14:40] when we move past the fifth day into the
[14:42] sixth day when God comes down here, he's
[14:45] still on earth in the very beginning of
[14:47] the sixth day and he's bringing forth
[14:49] now all the creatures. He brought forth
[14:52] the giraffe. He brought forth uh uh the
[14:54] lion, the mighty lion. He brought forth
[14:56] the tigers. Oh my goodness, we got
[14:57] battles coming. He brought forth what?
[14:59] The dogs. And I love the p cats that
[15:01] some of us know do or do not like. Uh he
[15:03] brought forth dogs. He brought forth all
[15:05] these creatures terrestrial life. Right?
[15:08] But if you look what God withheld, he
[15:10] brought no blessing upon them. Amen. Now
[15:13] notice, he blessed the birds. He blessed
[15:15] the fish. But when it came down to
[15:17] natural terrestrial life, he left out a
[15:20] blessing, saints of God. That set the
[15:22] stage for everything. Amen. Amen.
[15:26] Because if there's no blessing upon the
[15:28] animal life, that opened the that opened
[15:31] the door for what? A curse.
[15:35] Because God knew there's a serpent
[15:36] coming. He created the serpent and he's
[15:38] like, he's got his eye on that serpent.
[15:40] He said, "There's something coming for
[15:42] you. I had to withhold." He did not
[15:44] speak. He did not bring forth a
[15:45] blessing. But he saved that what? So he
[15:48] could bring forth a curse. Amen. But now
[15:50] notice he also set the stage again on
[15:52] the exact same day because as he got
[15:54] done down here, he ascended up into
[15:57] heaven. And the Bible said, "Let us make
[15:58] man in our image." Amen. So notice, he
[16:01] brought forth every one of us at that
[16:04] time, every son and daughter of God up
[16:06] there. He brought us forth in his image,
[16:09] male and female. But now notice, he
[16:12] withheld the first part on the earth a
[16:14] blessing. He withheld that blessing. He
[16:16] withheld everything. He just brought it
[16:18] forth. And the Bible said he saw that it
[16:20] was good. He didn't say it was good
[16:23] because it would had to remain good. So
[16:25] he just, the Bible says all he saw, he
[16:27] saw it was good. In other words, God's
[16:28] like, Mhm.
[16:31] But when he gets up there and brings
[16:32] forth his children, his sons and god do
[16:35] daughters, then he brings forth what? He
[16:37] says, "And God blessed them." Amen.
[16:41] Everything in those first two, day five
[16:43] and day six set the stage for
[16:46] everything.
[16:48] What he did right there was it. He opens
[16:52] doors. He closes doors. Those blessings
[16:54] right there that were upon us will keep
[16:56] us all the way through.
[16:58] Because Bible said what what God has
[17:00] blessed, he cannot curse. Amen.
[17:02] Absolutely. But now notice as Adam and
[17:05] Eve then fell, right? Notice God comes
[17:06] down. He looks at Adam. He says, "Why'd
[17:08] you do it, boy? Did God curse Adam?" He
[17:10] could not curse Adam because what? He
[17:13] was already blessed. Amen. He could not
[17:15] curse Eve because she was already
[17:17] blessed. But when it come down to the
[17:19] serpent, he said, "Thou art cursed
[17:20] because thou hast done this upon thy
[17:22] belly." Then we know two two sons come
[17:24] forth. What? Cain and Abel. And then now
[17:26] notice we see one rise against the
[17:28] other. And God now what it takes place.
[17:30] God comes down, speaks to Cain. And what
[17:32] does Cain what does he do to Cain? He
[17:34] curses him.
[17:37] How can Cain be a son of God if he if
[17:40] God can curse him? If he was already
[17:42] blessed, there'd be no cursing upon him.
[17:44] But what God had to curse him? What?
[17:46] from off the face of the earth. No
[17:49] inheritance. The inheritance is only for
[17:52] the sons and daughters of God. Amen. How
[17:54] many here are the sons and daughters of
[17:56] God? Amen. Why? Because you've heard the
[17:57] word. You've received it. Amen. Praise
[17:59] be to God. Now, we're going to get down
[18:00] to as brother uh uh uh Jose was talking
[18:04] about this this morning earlier. Now,
[18:06] notice in Matthew 5 when Jesus brings
[18:10] these things, he's starting this these
[18:12] are for his disciples alone. This
[18:14] revelation here, Matthew 5 through7
[18:16] saints of God is literally only for the
[18:19] bride. Though the world of the Catholic
[18:21] Church, though, though the Methodists,
[18:23] the Lutherans, all them glean from this.
[18:25] They preach the biatitudes. They preach
[18:27] all these things. But saints of God,
[18:29] they're never going to catch the
[18:30] revelation of it. They can they cannot
[18:33] comprehend the exactly what God is
[18:36] trying to say right here. Amen. Because
[18:38] now notice it says, "Blessed are the
[18:40] poor in spirit." Saints of God. How many
[18:41] poor in spirit do we know of? How many
[18:43] people walk around say Lord God we need
[18:45] more of you Lord we in fact notice it
[18:47] says they are poor in spirit. Amen. Why?
[18:50] He says because theirs is the kingdom of
[18:52] heaven. It's not like Leo to see who is
[18:54] rich and increased with goods but they
[18:56] are poor of spirit. They know they need
[18:59] more of God. Amen. Saint of God. I know
[19:02] I need more of God. I want more of God.
[19:04] I want more of his anointing, more of
[19:05] the Holy Spirit to come and pour my
[19:07] life. Amen. But remember only remember
[19:10] the he can only pour into you what you
[19:12] can get out of yourself. The more you
[19:15] yield, the more you empty out before God
[19:17] at the altar, the more as you enter into
[19:19] what? The prayer closet, as you empty
[19:21] yourself out, saints of God, he can
[19:23] creep his way into the nooks and
[19:24] crannies of your spirit. Why? Because
[19:26] God has chosen them. He has chosen by
[19:30] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[19:32] of the truth. Amen. That's how you know.
[19:36] Matter of fact, I I heard a brother just
[19:37] preach uh he had a Bible study. He said
[19:40] the difference between those that are
[19:41] called and those that are chosen. What's
[19:44] the difference? What's the difference
[19:47] between someone who's called and someone
[19:49] who's
[19:50] chosen? There's a parable where Jesus or
[19:52] God says he says he says there's a
[19:54] wedding supper. He says he says and go
[19:56] and call all those to the wedding
[19:59] supper. How many have heard this message
[20:01] and tuck tail and run? How many have
[20:03] heard this message and just like, "No, I
[20:05] don't think so. I don't I don't see any
[20:07] importance in this word. I don't believe
[20:08] anything of it. I I can't see it." Why?
[20:10] But they were called. But what remember
[20:12] those that are made themselves ready.
[20:15] The bride and the spirit say, "Come, the
[20:16] wife hath made herself ready." Not only
[20:19] did she was she called, but she was
[20:21] chosen and elected to hear this. In
[20:24] other words, when this word, this light
[20:26] struck your heart, something inside you
[20:28] said, "This is it."
[20:31] that that relationship with uh your mom
[20:33] and dad or or whatever you had to leave
[20:35] saints of God literally became
[20:38] nothing. We went out to this word to
[20:42] meet
[20:43] Christ. And if Christ is the word,
[20:45] saints of God, where are we at? We are
[20:47] what? Joining with the word. Absolutely.
[20:50] Yes.
[20:52] Now, sorry. Notice it says also blessed
[20:56] are they that mourn for they shall be
[20:57] comforted. Notice here's not a people
[20:59] who's just saying I'm this. I'm that on
[21:01] the face of God. These people are what?
[21:03] Sighing and crying for the abominations
[21:05] in the city. They see I say like this.
[21:08] Those that mourn. He's the poorest
[21:10] spirit. I'm looking at this thing that
[21:11] took place last night. I'm like, "Oh
[21:12] Lord God, have mercy. Jesus. Lord God,
[21:15] do something. Raise something up. Do
[21:18] some s something signs, wonders,
[21:19] miracles. Do something that'll catch the
[21:21] attention if there be any seed in here."
[21:25] Those are things that goes my through my
[21:26] mind when I met those things. I mean,
[21:28] those things run the entire time. I'm
[21:31] just
[21:32] like, "Blessed are the meek, for they
[21:35] shall inherit the earth. Blessed are
[21:38] they which hunger and thirst for after
[21:39] righteousness, for they shall be
[21:41] filled." Is there any hunger in us this
[21:44] morning for more of God. Is there
[21:47] something in you that's saying, "Lord, I
[21:49] need more for what I have right now is
[21:51] not enough." Amen. I need more. I need
[21:54] another refilling, a latter rain.
[21:56] something is going to move us and
[21:58] quicken us and something that's going to
[22:00] give us give us more strength. Thanks to
[22:01] God, this I I don't know about you, but
[22:04] every time I receive a refilling of the
[22:05] Holy Ghost, that's when I feel the
[22:07] strongest. That's when I feel the
[22:09] farthest away from the worldly things.
[22:11] That's when I feel like what I feel like
[22:13] a
[22:14] Christian. Because when you get that
[22:16] fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit,
[22:18] things of God, you can look at all you
[22:19] can look at your enemy. You can look at
[22:21] Hitler right in the face and have divine
[22:22] love for him. Amen. Why? Because it's no
[22:25] longer you. Now you are like filled up
[22:27] with the Holy Spirit. Amen. Yeah. Praise
[22:29] be to God. Now notice he says he says
[22:32] blessed are they that are merciful for
[22:34] they shall obtain
[22:36] mercy. These things are should be in our
[22:38] lives. These things should be expressing
[22:40] out of us. He says blessed are the
[22:42] peacemakers for they shall be called
[22:44] children of
[22:45] God. Blessed are they persecuted for the
[22:48] righteousness's sake for theirs is the
[22:49] kingdom of
[22:51] heaven. Yeah. Now notice this is for
[22:55] this is for the
[22:56] bride. Now notice continue here. Uh
[23:00] let's jump here to
[23:05] um notice if you actually actually if
[23:07] you look at this he even deals with
[23:08] marriage and divorce in Matthew chapter
[23:12] 5. Whosoever putteth away his wife and
[23:15] giveth her rightth a writing of
[23:17] divorcement. But I say unto you that
[23:18] whosoever puteth away his wife, saving
[23:20] for the cause of fornication, causes her
[23:22] to commit adultery, and whoever shall
[23:23] marry her that is divorced committh
[23:25] adultery. Saints of God, this is for the
[23:26] bride because who else can receive
[23:31] this? I just saw someone a while back
[23:34] get remarried again and married this and
[23:35] married that. Saints of God, the bride
[23:38] will have this
[23:39] revelation. They'll understand why.
[23:42] Because God gave it to our prophet. He
[23:43] finally gave it. There's one verse.
[23:46] Well, a man could get married as many
[23:47] times as they want. Well, be careful
[23:49] because that's not what the prophet
[23:50] said. He went back to this scripture
[23:52] right
[23:52] here. There's only one time where he can
[23:55] get remarried. Now, for the wife,
[23:57] obviously, she can't at all. Now,
[23:58] notice, continue here. Now, look what he
[24:01] says here. I like what he says
[24:03] uh in verse
[24:07] uh verse 43 of Matthew 5. Ye have heard
[24:11] that it hath been said, Thou shalt love
[24:13] thy neighbor and hate thy enemy. But I
[24:16] say unto you, love your enemies, bless
[24:18] them that curse you, and do good to them
[24:20] that hate you, and pray for them despite
[24:22] for you uh despitefully use you and
[24:24] persecute you. Saints of God, only the
[24:27] bride can do that. Only those who have
[24:30] that anointing within him, because
[24:32] that's not your love. There's no way you
[24:34] could do that in the flesh. I mean
[24:36] really sincerely to where there's
[24:39] nothing negative even you saints of God
[24:41] we could say all this out of our mouth
[24:43] but what's in our hearts right what is
[24:46] really in our hearts is it pure when I
[24:48] say brother I I love you even the
[24:50] brother said this or brother said that
[24:51] or sister said this saints of God if you
[24:53] can literally say I love you and
[24:55] there'll be nothing here saints of God
[24:57] you have you're getting you have
[24:59] arrived he says now notice but notice
[25:01] what now notice the hint he gives here
[25:03] in verse
[25:04] 25 he says that they that ye may be the
[25:08] children of your father which is heaven
[25:10] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[25:12] evil and on the good and sendeth rain on
[25:15] the just and on the unjust. He gives us
[25:17] a little
[25:18] hint. The Holy Ghost is going to do
[25:20] this. He said that same Holy Ghost is
[25:22] going to anoint the false and he's going
[25:25] to anoint the true. The same Holy Spirit
[25:29] he is he is prepping. Notice this is mid
[25:32] sermon here. He said, "Let me give you a
[25:33] little hint. You're going to see people
[25:35] who hate you and yet have the Holy
[25:37] Spirit on them, not in them." He says,
[25:40] "But it's going to fall on them." But
[25:42] notice, he said, "But there's also going
[25:43] to be those who want the Holy Spirit's
[25:45] going to be in as well." Amen. There's
[25:48] two sea lines,
[25:50] right?
[25:51] Now, in chapter six, now these are these
[25:56] are clues. These are this is bride stuff
[25:58] here. These are secrets of the bride. He
[26:01] says, he says, now notice he first he
[26:02] hits
[26:05] alms. Everybody pay their
[26:07] tithes. Everybody give offerings. Guess
[26:10] what? There's also alms. Alms to who?
[26:13] The
[26:15] poor. Now look what he says. Look what
[26:17] Jesus said. Now this is to the
[26:19] bride. Therefore, when thou dust these
[26:22] arms, do not sound a trumpet before thee
[26:24] as the hypocrites in the synagogues in
[26:25] the streets, that they may have glory of
[26:28] men. Verily I say unto you, they shall
[26:29] have their reward. But when thou dost
[26:32] doest alms, he says, let not thy left
[26:34] hand know what thy right hand
[26:36] doeth. In other words, if you give alms
[26:38] to the poor, no one in this church
[26:39] should know about
[26:41] it. Try to do it as quiet and as
[26:44] discreetly, as private as possible, if
[26:46] whoever God puts before you, then give.
[26:52] Right? He says, why? He says that thine
[26:55] alms may be in secret and thy father
[26:57] which seeth in secret himself shall
[26:59] reward thee openly. You're going to get
[27:01] an open blessing whether it be spiritual
[27:04] or natural because of these
[27:06] alms. Because remember, are we building
[27:08] our treasures here or up there?
[27:12] Saints of God, as I'm getting older and
[27:14] I'm seeing that everything that I've
[27:15] tried to do, everything trying to get
[27:17] this paid off, this it means nothing.
[27:21] The closer the more word you see. I like
[27:24] the closer you come to Christ, the more
[27:25] you revelation you catch, the more you
[27:28] see how the things of the world are
[27:30] absolutely we just had a sister stay
[27:32] with us a young sister and she was I
[27:34] treat her like my niece or my daughter
[27:36] and I kind of spoiled her a little
[27:39] bit. It was awesome. I was like finally
[27:42] someone I can God bless you. I miss you.
[27:45] I love you. And she's like brother Simon
[27:47] can we do Bible time? I was like
[27:48] absolutely. So we she says, "Where do
[27:50] you I said where do you want to listen?
[27:51] What do you want to read?" She goes, "I
[27:52] want to go to the Ecclesiastes because I
[27:54] don't understand it." She's a young
[27:56] girl, young sister. I said, "Okay." So
[27:58] every night we did
[28:00] Ecclesiastes. You know what Solomon said
[28:02] about everything. Solomon said he put
[28:04] his hand to everything. He planted
[28:08] vineyards. He built buildings. He did
[28:10] this. He says to God, "Everything he
[28:12] said in his heart he wanted to do, he
[28:14] did it." And you know as an end result
[28:16] he's as all as vexation of spirit and
[28:18] vanity
[28:21] trying to build a business trying trying
[28:23] to trying to do this trying to do that
[28:25] trying to say things of God it's all
[28:27] vanity vexation of spirit those sort of
[28:30] things the bible says no good soldier
[28:32] entangles themselves with the things of
[28:33] the world why because what our focus is
[28:36] what saving souls our focus is what
[28:40] saints of God it's every this end
[28:42] time what brother I'm saying the The
[28:44] mystery of God revealed. It's an
[28:46] individual affair.
[28:49] Brother, I wish I could do something. I
[28:51] wish you could get me in the rapture. I
[28:53] wish I could get you in the rapture. But
[28:55] says of God, it's all dependent on him
[28:56] and me. It's all dependent on
[28:59] me. Because on judgment day, I don't
[29:02] have this brother to stand with me and
[29:03] say, "Brother," I said, "Lord, he he he
[29:05] he did this. He did this for me. I
[29:06] can't. That's not going to happen. It's
[29:08] going to be individual. I don't have to
[29:09] stand before the Lord and say, "I have
[29:12] nothing, nothing but the blood I
[29:14] bring. I have nothing I can bring except
[29:17] the blood of Jesus Christ. Except what?
[29:20] The token of the Holy Ghost." Bible
[29:22] says, "What blessed is the man whom God
[29:24] will not impute iniquity." Amen. Amen. I
[29:27] got plenty of iniquities. God have
[29:28] mercy. Amen. But what blessed that where
[29:31] it says blessed, where'd that blessing
[29:32] come from? Genesis one.
[29:35] Where it says blessed are those blessed
[29:37] are these. That goes from Genesis 1.
[29:41] The biatitudes are for what? Those that
[29:43] want in Genesis 1 up there, the sons and
[29:46] daughters of
[29:47] God. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[29:50] Now, of course, then he go he deals with
[29:53] prayer. Then he says, "When thou
[29:54] prayest," he says, "when thou," in fact
[29:57] everything when Jesus is speaking, he
[29:58] says, "But when thou give alms, when
[30:00] thou pray," he says, "when thou do this,
[30:02] when thou," He's speaking to his
[30:04] disciples on how you're to do these
[30:06] things. He says, "But when thou prayest,
[30:08] enter into thy closet. When thou shut
[30:10] thy door, pray to the father which in
[30:11] secret, and thy father which seeth in
[30:13] secret shall reward thee
[30:18] openly." We sometimes we got to put we
[30:20] got we have to put God to the test. Try
[30:23] the Lord. See if he's not good and
[30:25] faithful in these things. If we just do
[30:27] what he says, saints of God, he's going
[30:30] to openly, and matter of fact, sometimes
[30:32] saints of God, I just say, "Lord, the
[30:34] natural things are good, but I'd love to
[30:35] have more revelation. I'd like to get
[30:37] rewarded spiritually if that be
[30:39] possible. I want spiritual revelation. I
[30:42] want spirit blessings. I want the things
[30:44] that God that's going to keep me
[30:45] through, the things they're going to
[30:46] take with me, things are going to
[30:47] strengthen me." Amen. And now
[30:50] notice also, but when thou fastest,
[30:53] anoint thine head and has washed thy
[30:56] face. How many fast here all the time?
[30:58] It's difficult. We got some of the best
[31:01] pizza the world's ever seen. You got
[31:03] some of the best fish that's ever been
[31:05] fried. You got some of the best chicken
[31:07] that's ever been fried. You eat you eat
[31:10] some of the best steaks you can actually
[31:12] literally melt in your mouth. Saints of
[31:14] God. Thanks to God's got it. This our
[31:17] what? Notice that's our last one of the
[31:19] last things he hit. What? That's the
[31:20] hardest thing to do is fast
[31:22] almost. My sure. He said, "But when thou
[31:26] fast," he says, "Unto thy father which
[31:28] is in secret and thy father which seeth
[31:29] in secret shall reward thee openly." One
[31:32] time I uh something God say sometimes
[31:36] you can you can decide to fast and
[31:38] sometimes there's an anointing that hits
[31:40] you when you know you're supposed to
[31:42] fast, right? One time I I I said, "Lord,
[31:44] I need I felt led to fast three days. I
[31:46] fasted three days and I said, what was
[31:47] my prayer? I said, Lord, what's wrong?
[31:50] What's wrong? What's going on right here
[31:51] in our assembly? After that third day, I
[31:55] finished the fast and the very next day,
[31:57] boom, something came up and I go, there
[31:59] it is. I see it. I see
[32:04] it. But remember, he said he would open
[32:06] you, reward you
[32:07] openly. Fast and secret, he reward he'll
[32:11] open these things to you. I see the
[32:13] problem. I see a problem. Not the
[32:15] problem, but a problem. Amen.
[32:18] Now, let's continue on now. Now, notice
[32:22] jumping in Matthew 7. Ask and it shall
[32:25] be given you. Seek and ye shall find.
[32:28] Knock it shall be opened unto you. For
[32:30] everyone that askketh receiveth, and he
[32:32] that seeketh findeth, and to him that
[32:34] knockketh it shall be open. What do you
[32:35] have need of today? What do you have
[32:38] need
[32:40] of? Does this say anything? He says,
[32:42] "Well, if you if you only ask or if you
[32:45] only seek and this this." He says,
[32:46] "Maybe, maybe I'll give it to you. There
[32:49] is no maybe here.
[32:52] Anything you want within God's will for
[32:54] you, you can have."
[32:57] Well, I'm not happy with this or I need
[33:00] attention here, Lord. I need there's
[33:02] something in my heart weighing. Saints
[33:04] of God, have we asked? Have we sought
[33:07] him? And have we not?
[33:10] all the blessing. You know, brother said
[33:12] he said he said he said God would
[33:14] bankrupt heaven to give you what you
[33:15] want. All you have to do is ask for
[33:20] it. But remember how how did Christ say
[33:22] it? Everyone that askketh is continually
[33:25] asking. He says everyone that receive he
[33:27] says seeketh is continually seeking.
[33:29] Everyone that knockketh is continually
[33:31] knocking. He's what? He's right here. He
[33:34] wants to see how hungry how much you
[33:35] desire these things from him. Amen.
[33:38] Because when you're a desperate man,
[33:40] when you're a desperate son or daughter
[33:42] of God, saints of God, nothing's going
[33:43] to withhold this from you. Why? Because
[33:45] you're going to keep seeking the father
[33:47] and say, "Lord God, I have a need and I
[33:49] need I want you to do this, Lord God, if
[33:52] it be your will." Amen. And God is going
[33:54] to do it. He can. Amen. Thanks God.
[33:58] Every time the spirit of God comes down,
[34:00] something happens.
[34:03] The without the spirit of God, we can do
[34:05] nothing. Even Jesus said that without
[34:06] the father I can't do nothing. So who do
[34:09] we need on the scene? We need the Holy
[34:13] Spirit. We need to be walking in his
[34:17] light in his presence constantly. Amen.
[34:21] But now
[34:22] notice at the end of
[34:25] this at the end of this sermon blessed
[34:28] blessed blessed do this do that do all
[34:30] these sort of things. There's rain
[34:32] falling on the just and the unjust. Look
[34:34] what how Christ ends
[34:37] this. This is to the bride. His
[34:40] disciples were the only ones that saw
[34:43] this. Look what he says here in
[34:46] 7:21. Not everyone that saith unto me,
[34:49] Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of
[34:52] heaven. What's the kingdom of heaven?
[34:54] Does anyone know the kingdom of heaven
[34:55] is? It is the Holy Ghost.
[34:59] When you enter into the Holy Ghost, you
[35:01] have then when you receive the baptism
[35:03] of the Holy Ghost, you have entered into
[35:04] the
[35:06] kingdom. So notice, not anyone just cry
[35:09] calls on the Lord. No one Lord, Lord, he
[35:11] says, he says, shall enter the kingdom
[35:12] of heaven, but he that doeth the
[35:18] will. You have to do these
[35:21] things. From chapter 5 to 7, you have to
[35:24] literally do these things. These are
[35:27] things we have to do.
[35:30] Many will come in that day to me in that
[35:33] day and say, "Lord, Lord, have we not
[35:34] prophesied thy name?" Notice they were
[35:36] able to get in the spirit enough,
[35:38] saints.
[35:40] They were able to yield to the Holy
[35:42] Ghost, saints of God, that the gifts
[35:44] that were in
[35:45] them were being made manifest. And yet
[35:49] they were not obedient. What they were,
[35:51] the Bible calls them what? Workers of
[35:53] iniquity.
[35:58] cause them workers. Notice just like
[36:00] Jesus said there in the in the chapter
[36:02] before he said that the Holy Ghost is
[36:03] going to come upon them. It'll fall on
[36:05] the rain. Rain will fall on the just and
[36:07] the unjust, upon the good and the evil.
[36:10] Here we see saints of God people who the
[36:12] same Holy Spirit is hitting just like
[36:14] the bride. The bride receives the end.
[36:16] They receive the anointing of it. And
[36:18] what it proves that God's with him or or
[36:20] that God is working the exact In other
[36:22] words, it proves that Jesus is alive.
[36:24] The Holy Ghost is still moving. He can
[36:26] move on an unclean vessel or a clean
[36:28] vessel.
[36:30] Amen. Then as we're at the wedding last
[36:35] night, this is the scripture that was
[36:38] read. Matthew
[36:41] 7:24. Therefore, whosoever heareth the
[36:45] sayings of
[36:47] mine and doeth
[36:49] them, see how powerful that is?
[36:53] For 2,000 years, men, women, mostly men,
[36:57] but a lot of women nowadays are studying
[37:00] this word. Theologians in theology
[37:03] schools and seminaries are studying this
[37:05] word to such extent they're breaking
[37:07] down the Greek. They're breaking down
[37:09] the Hebrew, trying to figure out the
[37:12] true meaning, trying to catch the true
[37:13] understanding of what of this
[37:19] word. But do they obey it?
[37:25] To hear him that heareth and doeth, I
[37:28] will liken him to a wise man. How many
[37:29] wise men are
[37:32] here? The bride has a wise and a
[37:35] foolish. Saints of God. And we believe
[37:37] by the grace of God. We've been called
[37:39] not to the foolish, but what? To the
[37:41] wise. Amen. What? Because what? We've
[37:43] heard. And we're going to do these
[37:45] things.
[37:48] And the rains descended and the floods
[37:50] came. Look at verse 26. Everyone that
[37:52] hear these sayings of mine and doeth
[37:54] them not. And the raised descendants,
[37:56] saints of God, here's two sets of
[37:59] people heard the word and receive the
[38:02] exact same storm. You know there's a
[38:04] storm
[38:05] coming. There is a big storm
[38:11] coming. I feel
[38:14] really bad for the people of the world,
[38:16] but especially the younger generation,
[38:18] the young ones. Saints of God, there's
[38:21] we're going to see something in our
[38:22] lives I've never even seen. Brother Jose
[38:24] maybe have never seen. We're going to
[38:26] see a collapse of this thing. We're
[38:30] going to see a religious movement, a
[38:33] worldwide religious movement that is
[38:36] coming, saints of God. And now notice
[38:38] that same member, but remember that as
[38:40] that anointing hits them, it's going to
[38:43] look, wow, wow, look at the signs,
[38:46] wonders, and miracles that are done in
[38:47] them.
[38:50] I like this. What if it hits them first?
[38:52] Because remember Jesus said, he says, "I
[38:54] will bind the tears first."
[39:00] So, what are you going to lean on? Wow,
[39:02] look at that anointing, man. They
[39:04] baptized Father and Ghost. They believe
[39:05] in the Trinity, but man, look at the
[39:06] healings that are going on over there.
[39:07] Look at the faith. Look at the revival.
[39:09] Or are we going to stay on Christ the
[39:12] solid
[39:16] rock? You're we have to make we're going
[39:18] to make choices
[39:19] here. But you have to have confidence in
[39:22] what God has revealed to
[39:27] you. The exact same storm. Notice but
[39:30] this storm that's coming is going to
[39:32] prove who's going to be shaken and who
[39:34] is not going to be shaken. The
[39:36] difference was what? Whose house was on
[39:39] the rock? Is that rock? Jesus. No, the
[39:42] rock is the revelation.
[39:45] The rock is the revelation because it
[39:48] does Jesus does not reveal what that
[39:50] rock reveals is is right here. But he
[39:52] reveals that in Matthew 16 what that
[39:54] rock
[39:55] is. Upon this rock I'll build my
[40:01] church. What did the prophet tell us? He
[40:03] says pray for revelation more than
[40:07] anything because if your foundation
[40:10] crumbles at this well when this thing
[40:12] comes saints we might not have enough
[40:14] food.
[40:16] We might not have electricity for AC. We
[40:18] might not have electricity or even
[40:20] before heat. When is this coming? What
[40:22] Jesus say? Don't pray that pray your
[40:24] flight doesn't come in winter. Bring me
[40:26] when it's hot. Sleep outside. Right.
[40:30] Amen. It's coming. The storm is coming.
[40:32] Saints of God, tonight when you get
[40:34] home, re-evaluate foundation. Is it on
[40:38] the word or is it on our own
[40:41] interpretation?
[40:45] Now I'm going to Jose's already kind of
[40:48] I want to I want you to turn with me
[40:50] here to Revelations 1. Now that's pretty
[40:53] good for that section right there.
[40:54] Revelations
[40:56] one. Revelations 1
[41:02] through3. What's the testimony
[41:06] here? Revelations 1 verse one. the
[41:10] revelation of Jesus Christ, which God
[41:12] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[41:14] things which must shortly come to pass
[41:16] pass. And he sent and signified by his
[41:19] angel unto his servant John, who bear
[41:21] record of the word of God. Who bear
[41:23] record what? Of the word of
[41:27] God. Amen. Yes. He says, "And he says,
[41:31] uh uh and for the testimony of Jesus
[41:33] Christ and of all things that he saw."
[41:35] And now
[41:37] notice, blessed or blessed is he that
[41:41] readeth. In 2001, I got my first church
[41:44] age book. In 2001, I got my first little
[41:48] uh uh um spoken spoken word book. I
[41:51] started reading uh uh anointed ones in
[41:54] the end times. I started reading
[41:55] indictments. Started reading these
[41:56] things. And I've read these things. The
[41:58] saints of God, how many have read the
[42:00] Bible?
[42:03] Praise God. I read exactly what the
[42:04] prophet wrote. I wrote exactly what I
[42:06] read exactly what he preached. I read
[42:08] it. I received this word. Now notice he
[42:10] says, "He that readeth and he that hear
[42:13] and they that hear the words of this
[42:15] prophecy." So notice you receive a
[42:18] blessing if you hear or read.
[42:21] You receive
[42:23] that. I say this. Look at people's
[42:25] lives. Look at their lives. If you're I
[42:27] probably don't encourage this, but I
[42:29] know people who've received this message
[42:31] and I see God just bless them. blessing,
[42:34] blessing, blessing. And as soon as they
[42:36] start rejecting this message, I look at
[42:38] them spiritually and it's literally they
[42:41] fall right off a
[42:43] cliff. Right off a cliff. They can't
[42:46] even
[42:47] discern the word of God anymore. A
[42:50] brother called me. He said, "Brother
[42:51] Sai," he goes, "My my so and so uh this
[42:54] and this, they started getting to they
[42:56] go they go to a church now speaking in
[42:58] tongues as they evidence of the Holy
[43:00] Ghost." He said, "How do you defeat
[43:02] that?" And I'm going, "What do you mean
[43:04] how you do? You don't know
[43:08] how?" A minister asked me how to do
[43:11] that. They came in with
[43:14] me. How does he not know how to do
[43:19] that? Because the Bible said in Matthew
[43:22] 13, he says, God said, what Jesus said?
[43:24] He said, "He that seemth as he have," he
[43:27] says, "Well, I will take that which he
[43:29] seems he have." But they that have, he
[43:32] says, more will I give unto them. I'm
[43:34] just paraphrasing
[43:35] there. If you really have the revelation
[43:38] of God, he's going to give you more. But
[43:40] if it looks like you have the
[43:42] revelation, oh, I've read it. I've
[43:43] listened to it. If that looks like you
[43:45] have it, but you don't, Jesus said,
[43:47] "What? He'll take it from
[43:50] you." You better be grateful for
[43:52] everything you understand. For
[43:54] everything. What if I say, "Brother,
[43:56] brother, God bless you." You know,
[43:58] serpent seed's wrong.
[44:01] You're off on the word, brother. Serpent
[44:03] seed's completely wrong. You need to get
[44:04] baptized in Father Holy Ghost. What are
[44:06] you going to tell me? He said,
[44:08] "Nope."
[44:10] Why? This brother can say, "Brother
[44:13] Simon, let's do a Bible study." I'm
[44:15] like, "But I'm the teacher. Let's do a
[44:16] Bible study." He says, "Brother Sim,
[44:19] look over here. See this? Look over
[44:21] here. See that?
[44:24] What's he What's he bringing me to? He's
[44:25] bringing me to the Revelation.
[44:29] Amen. Now notice in Revelations 1:3,
[44:34] blessed is he that readeth and he that
[44:35] heareth the words of the pe prophecy.
[44:37] Notice these blessings come with that.
[44:39] And then notice, and keep those things
[44:41] that are written therein, for the time
[44:43] is at hand, the
[44:46] keeping. So what would you rather
[44:49] be? What's going to last? someone that
[44:53] hears, someone that reads, or someone
[44:57] that
[44:59] keeps. Let's look at the because this is
[45:01] the beginning. There's a blessing when
[45:03] you start out with this revelation.
[45:04] There is a blessing that comes upon you,
[45:06] saints of God. You better recognize who
[45:09] you are. Amen. Turn to Revelations 22.
[45:13] We'll see the end result. Who who makes
[45:15] it through? Well, I've heard the
[45:17] revelation this day. I've I heard the
[45:19] prophet. I've heard this message. saints
[45:21] of God. But there's one people that are
[45:24] going to going to finish this thing. Who
[45:26] is it? Revelations
[45:29] 22 verse 6. Notice the angels still
[45:33] talking with
[45:34] John. And he said unto me, this angel,
[45:36] the prophet, these things are faithful
[45:39] and true. The Lord God and the holy
[45:41] prophet sent his angel to show unto his
[45:43] servants the things which must shortly
[45:45] be done. That's what Revelations 1 and
[45:47] two. And then notice Christ. This this
[45:50] proverb was so anointed that Christ
[45:52] actually spoke out of him. These are red
[45:56] letters. Behold, I come
[46:00] quickly. Blessed or blessed is he that
[46:03] heareth. I've heard the
[46:06] message. Bless that readeth. Doesn't say
[46:09] that. It says the Bible said what Jesus
[46:12] say. He says blessed he that keeps the
[46:14] sayings of the prophecy of this book.
[46:21] Well, I've heard it. Have you kept this?
[46:25] Have you kept the sayings of the
[46:27] prophecy of the In fact, I'll say this.
[46:28] Why was that church age book
[46:30] given? That church age book deals with
[46:33] chapter one, two, and three. That's the
[46:37] beginning of it. And then, of course, in
[46:40] the messages, we go all the way up to
[46:41] the six seals. We go into Christ, the
[46:43] future home, all these sort of things.
[46:45] God, he covers this. What the ra covered
[46:47] the entire book of
[46:52] revelation. I want to show you something
[46:55] here. Now Jesus says that there. But now
[46:58] notice what this angel says as well in
[47:00] verse eight. And I saw John I, John saw
[47:04] these things and heard them. And when I
[47:06] seen and heard the and seen, he says, I
[47:08] fell down to worship before the feet of
[47:10] the angel which shed me these things.
[47:13] Then then said he unto me, see thou do
[47:15] it not, for I am thy fellow servant, and
[47:17] thy brother in the prophets, and of them
[47:18] which
[47:19] hear of them which
[47:21] [Music]
[47:23] read this angel, this prophet was what?
[47:26] A keeper of the sayings. Amen.
[47:30] He says the sayings of this book worship
[47:33] God.
[47:36] So you can lose a
[47:38] blessing for those who read, for those
[47:41] that hear. If you do not keep the
[47:47] word and of course something here very
[47:49] powerful
[47:50] saints Christ and the bride verse 17 and
[47:54] the bride the spirit and the bride say
[47:57] come let him that heareth say come let
[48:01] him that is thirst come and whosoever
[48:03] will let him take of the water of the
[48:04] life freely for I testify unto every man
[48:07] that heareth the
[48:09] words those that keep the heard. Those
[48:12] that are keepers had to have heard it as
[48:14] well. Those that keep it had to have
[48:16] read as well. He says, but notice he
[48:19] says, "And he that hearth the words of
[48:20] the prophecies, book of any man shall
[48:22] add unto these things." That's how you
[48:25] lose a
[48:27] blessing. The keeping is like this.
[48:31] Well, the keeping is
[48:33] simple. This is the word. This is the
[48:36] Bible.
[48:38] We can't add or interject our thoughts
[48:42] into any of this except it be revealed
[48:46] in the
[48:47] scriptures or let's say we hear a c we
[48:50] have a quote on a tape. Man, that's
[48:52] interesting. That's powerful. Can we
[48:54] bring it back to this?
[48:58] Hey, just like we just seen what we have
[49:00] an American
[49:02] pope
[49:03] prophesied in
[49:06] 1954. And when that new pope comes out
[49:09] of the United States, he calls it a new
[49:13] pope. Was he not a new pope? The other
[49:16] one just
[49:18] passed. Looks like it's been pro looks
[49:21] like it's coming to pass. If this be
[49:23] that
[49:24] one, you're going to watch this
[49:26] confederation is going to start moving.
[49:29] We have a new president, American
[49:30] president, and we have a new American
[49:33] pope. Did not Donald Trump, what he he
[49:36] posted that thing on uh brother Cam
[49:38] talked about it. He literally had an AI
[49:40] image of him being pope.
[49:44] What What was he saying? Was there going
[49:46] to be American pope? I don't know. I
[49:47] don't know what he I don't know what
[49:48] that was all
[49:49] about. Everything's done for a purpose.
[49:53] He made himself as a pope, a
[49:57] Catholic. And what brother said, he says
[49:59] according to the prophecy in what? In
[50:01] Revelations
[50:03] 13.
[50:05] Now, and if any man take away from the
[50:07] words of this book, he says, I'll take
[50:09] his part out from the the book of life,
[50:11] right? And from the holy city and the
[50:13] things that are written in this book. I
[50:14] want to read you some quotes here by
[50:15] God's grace.
[50:20] I want to read this to you by God's
[50:27] grace. Let me read this. God is known by
[50:32] simplicity and of the revelation of
[50:34] Jesus Christ to the most illiterate
[50:37] person. See, it doesn't matter if you
[50:39] can read or write. If you understand, if
[50:42] you what? Catch the revelation. If you
[50:44] keep these things. See, that's why
[50:46] illiterate can't even read. All you have
[50:48] to do is hear. Once you hear, you're
[50:51] accountable. He says, "Not your
[50:53] theology. It's the revelation of Jesus
[50:55] Christ. Upon this rock, I build my
[50:57] church." No other rocks accepted. No
[51:00] other revelation accepted. He says, "No
[51:02] other Roman rock, no Protestant rock, no
[51:05] no other school, no other nothing but
[51:07] the exactly but on the exact revelation
[51:10] of Jesus Christ through the new birth."
[51:13] So the only thing that can give you the
[51:15] revelation of this is the new birth.
[51:19] That's why Jesus said what? Seek ye
[51:22] first the kingdom of God. Amen. And his
[51:26] righteousness. Well, how do you get his
[51:28] right righteousness? You have to become
[51:29] a new creature in Christ. You have to
[51:31] become the blood of Christ. Amen. His is
[51:33] his his his anointing is his his blood
[51:35] must be covering you, sealing you until
[51:37] the day of your redemption. Right. He
[51:39] says he b he says he's exactly. He says
[51:41] he bors it there and he injects his own
[51:43] life and your life is
[51:46] gone. Your life is gone. Thanks God.
[51:48] There's one thing I noticed about
[51:49] myself. I my my personality is too
[51:52] strong. There's still too much of
[51:54] brother Simon
[51:55] here. I want my personality to leave and
[52:00] I want his nature, his
[52:04] personality to come in.
[52:07] There has to be the bride will have that
[52:09] at the coming of the Lord. Now, we
[52:12] should see a little bit. If you don't
[52:13] see it, saints of God, cry out for it.
[52:15] Amen. Run to the altar. Make sure we
[52:17] have exactly what we say we have. Amen.
[52:19] Amen.
[52:21] He says, "And the life of Christ is
[52:23] projecting itself through you with the
[52:25] preeminences to the people, and they may
[52:27] see the very life and works and signs
[52:29] and wonders that he did is doing the
[52:31] same thing in you." That's what he's
[52:34] looking for. is not necessarily
[52:35] understanding the mysteries. Those
[52:37] mysteries are great, but he wants to see
[52:39] the very life of Christ. Maybe he'll
[52:41] walk on water again.
[52:44] Maybe he'll translate somewhere.
[52:48] Maybe this man will speak in tongues and
[52:50] God will say something through that to
[52:51] what? Protect the people of this church.
[52:54] These signs shall follow them that
[52:56] believe. Saints of God. True believers.
[52:58] Amen. Amen.
[53:01] And not only that, but we'll do what?
[53:02] The greater works.
[53:04] There's something we don't know nothing
[53:06] about. It's called the third pole. He
[53:07] said, "But as the council brings forth
[53:09] this crunch as the pressure becomes, as
[53:12] the brother uh brother Jose said, he
[53:15] said that that that squeeze coming,
[53:17] saints of God, he's what what is a
[53:18] squeeze?" The squeeze is a pressure put
[53:21] upon something. You squeeze an orange
[53:23] and orange juice comes out. If you have
[53:25] the Holy Ghost and the squeeze, the Holy
[53:27] Spirit should come out. The lion will be
[53:30] released. Amen. Out of you. Amen.
[53:39] He says, "And they shall see the very
[53:40] life and works and signs and wonders
[53:42] that he that he did is the same life
[53:44] that's doing the thing things in you
[53:46] outside of that. The rest of it," he
[53:48] says, "the reverence is not even called
[53:49] to at all." Watch God's great revelation
[53:53] unfolding. By lack of this
[53:57] revelation, in other words, Christ in
[54:00] you, what are we lacking right now? That
[54:02] revelation.
[54:04] that these signs shall follow you that
[54:07] believe. He said this is the revelation
[54:09] we're lacking. By the lack of this
[54:11] revelation is why we have so many
[54:13] different divisions among us is so much
[54:16] mockery. You know why people in the
[54:18] world uh mo Christians because they
[54:20] don't see the life the power of the
[54:23] spirit. If they saw the life and power
[54:26] of the spirit in you saints of God they
[54:27] would reverence. There should be some
[54:29] kind of fear. There should be something
[54:30] to say, wow, that's a Christian. That
[54:33] man is full of the Holy Ghost. There's
[54:34] something about him. Amen. That's right.
[54:39] He says, "So much division among us
[54:40] because the lack of the revelation."
[54:42] See, they lack the revelation. The
[54:44] teachers Paul after his great re
[54:46] revelation of Christ said in the first
[54:48] Corinthians 2, he says, "Be sure you
[54:50] watch it." He says, "I never come to you
[54:52] with wisdom. Look at that man who did
[54:54] have the wisdom or look upon." He did
[54:56] not come say look who has scholarship. I
[54:58] never came you with those kind of words.
[54:59] He says, I've come with what power and
[55:01] demonstration of the
[55:02] spirit. But that's a
[55:05] revelation. Wherever you should go, when
[55:07] it's time, when God needs his power to
[55:10] displayed, he can use your vessels.
[55:14] Just last night, we took a uh two nights
[55:16] ago, we took a brother out to eat. And
[55:18] while we're eating, I was looking right
[55:20] across the street, and a man I didn't
[55:21] right across the table there, two tables
[55:23] down, this man started going like this,
[55:25] all slumped over. and his wife was
[55:27] holding him and I'm just watching this
[55:29] unfold. Everybody's talking. I said,
[55:30] "Hey, oh, we got to say a prayer." We
[55:32] said a prayer and that man started to
[55:35] slowly recover those sort of things. And
[55:36] however, I later talked with the the uh
[55:39] the uh uh the waiter and he said,
[55:42] "Yeah," he said he was having a
[55:44] seizure. But what I didn't I I initially
[55:47] instantly I said, "We need to say a
[55:49] prayer. We need God on the scene."
[55:53] Saints of God, that's Christ. Whenever
[55:56] the go Christ saw a problem, whenever
[55:57] God let him saw a problem, something
[55:59] strike him, he went and dealt with it.
[56:00] Amen. Yes. Now, I want to read something
[56:04] else here by God's
[56:15] grace. Now, here's the
[56:18] difference.
[56:20] Remember, there's those that hear, those
[56:23] that read, and those that
[56:27] keep. Which one of us are we this
[56:30] morning? He says, "Now notice this. The
[56:34] b the bride body must follow the
[56:39] head." Bride are when you're born again,
[56:42] when you someone is born again of the
[56:43] spirit, they become the body of Christ.
[56:48] Now you are, the Bible says, you're not
[56:49] flesh of flesh. Now you're spirit of
[56:53] spirit. Then the bride body must follow
[56:56] the head, for it is part of his
[56:57] resurrection and part of the mystery.
[57:00] It's impossible for it not to go. See,
[57:02] saints of God, that's why he seek youth
[57:03] first the kingdom of God first. Receive
[57:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That is
[57:07] the
[57:10] key. He says it's part of God's mystery
[57:13] how God revealed himself and raised it
[57:15] up by the word. So he reveals his church
[57:18] and raises up by the same word. It's
[57:20] part of his three-fold
[57:22] mystery. As the head was took from the
[57:25] grave, so must the body follow him back
[57:27] to
[57:28] Eden. Is someone who's not the body of
[57:30] Christ going to follow him back to Eden?
[57:32] It's not going to happen. Only those
[57:35] that are born again will catch this.
[57:38] He says the body and be the b the bride
[57:41] being the body of the bridegroom must
[57:44] follow and the head is revealed and will
[57:48] come back with eternal life and the body
[57:50] must follow that because it is the
[57:52] husband and wife again. Amen. And as
[57:56] long as you're pregnantated with the
[57:58] same word which is his
[58:01] body. You understand the revelation of
[58:03] Paul or I'm sorry John. In the beginning
[58:06] was Jesus and Jesus was the word and or
[58:09] sorry in the beginning was the word the
[58:10] word was with God and the word was God.
[58:12] It does not call him Jesus does not call
[58:14] him son but it calls him the word.
[58:19] Do you see how powerful? In fact all
[58:21] John's writing he calls Jesus the word.
[58:23] In first John he calls him the
[58:25] word. In Revelations 20 he calls him and
[58:28] on his thigh was written a name the word
[58:30] of God. And his name was called the word
[58:32] of God.
[58:38] And as long as you're pregnantated with
[58:40] the same word, which is his body, you've
[58:43] took his body become into you. And when
[58:45] you took the word, not the creed, my the
[58:48] word. Oh
[58:49] my. Wouldn't that make a text this
[58:52] afternoon to go on? Uhhuh. Why wouldn't
[58:54] that be wonderful? See, just think of it
[58:55] now what it is. Therefore, the body
[58:57] cannot
[58:58] recognize. He said the body cannot
[59:01] recognize. He says, "Don't fail this.
[59:05] The body therefore cannot recognize any
[59:08] headship but the
[59:11] word." I just heard a minister a while
[59:14] back. He was preaching. I I don't
[59:16] usually listen to other services from
[59:17] our church other than our church, but
[59:19] sometimes I jump out. I listen to a
[59:21] sermon. The brother said, he said, "You
[59:23] know, hell was created after the
[59:28] fall." I never heard that quote.
[59:32] Was hell created after the
[59:35] fall? I thought on the seventh day that
[59:38] God rested from his works, we're
[59:40] finished.
[59:43] Preached a sermon and it sounded really
[59:46] enticing, but man, he just throws these
[59:48] little things in here that have nothing
[59:50] to do with just made
[59:54] up. Now, why did I catch that when
[59:57] everyone else is
[59:58] amening? I go,
[1:00:02] Because what? The body only recognizes
[1:00:04] the
[1:00:09] word. Didn't use a quote. Notice when
[1:00:11] they when these things take place,
[1:00:13] there's never a quote. There's never a
[1:00:15] scripture. Especially never a
[1:00:19] scripture. I'm like, if I was there, I'd
[1:00:21] been like, "Uh, brother, uh, can you
[1:00:23] show me the Bible
[1:00:25] where just made it up?
[1:00:31] He says, "But the body therefore cannot
[1:00:33] recognize any other headship but the
[1:00:36] word." He says, "Because the word is
[1:00:39] because the head is connected with the
[1:00:41] body and the head is the word and it's
[1:00:43] the same word, one headship. Therefore,
[1:00:45] denominations and holy fathers and
[1:00:48] everything else is dead dung. There is
[1:00:50] one headship that's Christ. The body
[1:00:53] only recognizes one thing. He says the
[1:01:01] word. Brother Jose's out there. You know
[1:01:04] what he said? Brother Jose said, he
[1:01:05] said, "Brother Simon," he goes, "There
[1:01:07] are 20." How many did you say 20?
[1:01:10] There's more than 20 different forms of
[1:01:14] the
[1:01:17] message. We We got Malachi 4. We could
[1:01:19] literally take We go up here like this.
[1:01:21] I'll write Malachi 4. Make a circle and
[1:01:24] then out of here a group. Out of here a
[1:01:27] group. And we can do over
[1:01:31] 20. Now where's the divisions come?
[1:01:33] Where where are these things coming
[1:01:35] from? They're going
[1:01:38] off this. They are not understanding
[1:01:42] this. They did not catch the revelation
[1:01:45] in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Do
[1:01:48] not add or take away.
[1:01:53] In Revelations 20:22, that's the most
[1:01:56] important thing. The bride, the head,
[1:01:58] the bride, the headship is Christ. And
[1:02:01] if he's going to connect with his wife,
[1:02:04] she has to be what? Pure. Pure word. Do
[1:02:09] you think a husband's going to touch
[1:02:12] uh You could go either way. If a husband
[1:02:15] and wife are married and the wife goes
[1:02:16] and messes with another man, do you
[1:02:18] think that man's going to want to take
[1:02:19] his wife again?
[1:02:21] If a man goes to mess with another
[1:02:23] woman, you think that wife's going to
[1:02:24] take that man again? Be difficult. Very,
[1:02:26] very difficult to do to work through
[1:02:27] those things, right? What about Christ
[1:02:30] and his
[1:02:32] bride? I'm the bride. I'm the bride. Oh,
[1:02:34] but I believe the hell was created after
[1:02:37] Jesus is like, that's not what I
[1:02:39] said. That's not me. And if Christ is
[1:02:42] the word and the word is him himself,
[1:02:46] which is his
[1:02:51] voice, brother Austin, can you stand up
[1:02:57] here? Now, I'm going to deal with this,
[1:02:58] brother, because they're nearly
[1:03:01] w. Watch
[1:03:05] this. Now, they're
[1:03:08] married. She knows your voice. And you
[1:03:11] know his
[1:03:14] voice.
[1:03:17] Lena, I'll meet you. Go in the bathroom
[1:03:19] right
[1:03:21] now. This is your
[1:03:24] husband. She's not going to obey that
[1:03:27] voice because that did not come from her
[1:03:30] husband.
[1:03:37] What? Lena, you're not going to eat
[1:03:39] today. You're going to fast and I'm
[1:03:40] going to
[1:03:42] eat. Now, that's kind that's
[1:03:47] just But she knows the tones. She knows
[1:03:51] she for her to listen to that. She's
[1:03:53] like, "My husband would never ask me to
[1:03:55] do that. That that's not something I've
[1:03:58] ever heard him ask before. That doesn't
[1:04:00] make some that usually if my husband
[1:04:03] would what? Fast with me or we would
[1:04:04] just whatever." You know what I mean?
[1:04:07] That's not the that's that's not the
[1:04:08] nature of that man to that wife. It's
[1:04:11] the same with Christ in the word.
[1:04:16] Let me sit down. Think about that.
[1:04:23] See, that's how serious this is.
[1:04:29] The wife of Christ will know the word.
[1:04:36] when you hear something that seems a
[1:04:39] little bit
[1:04:40] off. Amen. Now, I'm going to show you
[1:04:42] one last thing here by God's grace.
[1:04:44] Everybody been blessed. Okay, I know
[1:04:45] it's simple. I'm going I'm going without
[1:04:47] very
[1:04:50] I'm going to show you something. I show
[1:04:52] brother Jose out there. When I heard
[1:04:56] this, it shook me to the core.
[1:05:03] Let's draw the book of Acts right here.
[1:05:05] Book of Acts with a circle,
[1:05:07] right? And in 300 years there was one
[1:05:10] stem off that Catholic Church. Then you
[1:05:13] have the Christians. The Catholic Church
[1:05:15] killed the Christians. And for the most
[1:05:17] part after that, we had Catholics with
[1:05:19] the Alba Albagen and all those real true
[1:05:21] Christians after that, but they're
[1:05:22] really small groups and this and this.
[1:05:24] And the Catholic Church just destroyed
[1:05:26] God's people.
[1:05:29] But when they when the Catholic Church
[1:05:30] started building that cyine chapel, St.
[1:05:33] Peter's Basilica, and they're and God's
[1:05:35] looking down seeing it's a serpent, he's
[1:05:37] like, "All right, I got something for
[1:05:39] you." And he sends in
[1:05:41] Luther. And then now we have the book of
[1:05:43] Acts. Now we have the Catholic Church.
[1:05:44] We have
[1:05:45] Luther. We have then the Methodists. We
[1:05:48] have all these things coming
[1:05:49] out. And what what God slowly restoring
[1:05:53] his bride to his word. And now we have
[1:05:55] Malachi 4 on the scene 50, 60, 70 years
[1:05:57] ago.
[1:06:01] And now
[1:06:02] we magnify it again. We don't focus on
[1:06:05] the Catholics. We don't focus on the
[1:06:07] Lutherans. We don't focus on the
[1:06:08] Methodists. We focus now just on the
[1:06:10] message. This little branch coming here
[1:06:11] with the message. And now, as brother
[1:06:13] brother Jose said, we've got over 20
[1:06:15] different
[1:06:20] kinds. I want to show you something that
[1:06:23] should shake you.
[1:06:26] In fact, when I heard
[1:06:31] this, I listened to another sermon I
[1:06:33] probably should not listen to because it
[1:06:35] really uh did something scared me to
[1:06:41] death. I'll just say it because it's
[1:06:43] it's it's terrifying. I listen to a
[1:06:45] sermon a brother's preaching. He's
[1:06:46] dealing with the seventh seal. We know
[1:06:48] the seventh seal is made up of three
[1:06:49] parts, three-fold.
[1:06:51] You know that third pole, that third
[1:06:53] fold was an unknown tongue.
[1:06:55] I'm listening to sermon. This brother
[1:06:56] said, "Don't touch the seven seal. Just
[1:06:58] don't. Dad, this this." And he says, "Oh
[1:06:59] yeah, that unknown tongue was this,
[1:07:01] this, this, this, this." And I'm
[1:07:05] going,
[1:07:07] "What? No quote, no
[1:07:14] scripture. I'm going to read this quote
[1:07:16] here.
[1:07:21] Do not be surprised that anything takes
[1:07:24] place in this message,
[1:07:26] saints. If you hear of this brother
[1:07:28] leaving or this brother joining up with,
[1:07:30] don't let nothing shake you. There's a
[1:07:33] storm coming. Don't let anything shake
[1:07:36] you. Your foundations on the word. If
[1:07:38] you know you're on the word, if you can
[1:07:40] say, "Lord, I've done this. I've done
[1:07:42] this. I'm doing my best to keep
[1:07:43] everything. I've not added to anything.
[1:07:48] You can be you can be solid on your
[1:07:52] foundation. Second time he preaches
[1:07:55] this trying to do God a service without
[1:07:58] his being his will.
[1:08:03] 11:2765. Blessed are you that hear,
[1:08:05] bless you that read. But saints of God,
[1:08:09] the blessing is for those that keep the
[1:08:13] word. Now, why is that so important? Why
[1:08:16] is keeping the word the preeminent thing
[1:08:19] in
[1:08:22] Revelations? And I'm not throwing anyone
[1:08:24] under the bus, but saints of God, watch
[1:08:26] this thing. Keep your spiritual eyes
[1:08:29] open at all
[1:08:32] times. Paragraph 3:22. Yes. The evening
[1:08:36] promise of the seven seals of
[1:08:38] Revelations 10, Malachi 4, Luke 10, and
[1:08:42] Luke 30 and 10. Read he read Deuteronomy
[1:08:45] 4
[1:08:47] 1-4. You know what Deuteronomy 4 1-4 is?
[1:08:51] That's where Moses tells the people of
[1:08:53] Israel, do not add or
[1:09:01] diminish. And then in verse 25 and 26,
[1:09:04] he says, "I call heavens and earth to
[1:09:07] witness against you this day. Do not do
[1:09:09] these things."
[1:09:12] But Moses said, "I call heavens and
[1:09:13] earth to witness against." Who's the
[1:09:15] witness? What's the witness of
[1:09:18] heaven? 1 John 5 7 6 78. Let's read it.
[1:09:23] Who are who are the witnesses in
[1:09:27] heaven? Let's go there. Just so you
[1:09:29] know. Just so you know, because the
[1:09:32] Bible interprets
[1:09:36] itself. Notice it's revealed to the
[1:09:38] bride who the witnesses are.
[1:09:42] 1 John
[1:09:44] 5 7 and 8. I call heavens and earth to
[1:09:48] witness against you this day. Who is the
[1:09:50] witnesses in heaven? For there are three
[1:09:52] that bear record in heaven. The father,
[1:09:55] the word, and the holy ghost. And these
[1:09:57] three are one. So who is the witness in
[1:10:00] heaven? God himself. All threefold
[1:10:03] manifestations of him. All three offices
[1:10:05] of the same person because they are one.
[1:10:08] Who are the witnesses on earth?
[1:10:11] And there are three that bear witness in
[1:10:12] earth. The spirit, the water, and the
[1:10:15] blood. Everything that came out of
[1:10:17] Christ as a witness that was done down
[1:10:19] here, saints of God, is a witness
[1:10:20] against these
[1:10:25] things. Deuteronomy, notice, I'm going
[1:10:27] to read. I'm going to finish this. Read
[1:10:29] Deuteronomy 4:14 and then 25 and 26
[1:10:33] verse and see what he said about this
[1:10:35] last day. He called Revelation or sorry
[1:10:37] Deuteronomy 4 do not add or take away
[1:10:40] and the and the witness heaven and
[1:10:41] earth. He says this this day for this
[1:10:47] day. This was Moses saying to Israel to
[1:10:50] keep every word and don't add one thing.
[1:10:53] Moses that prophet had been up there and
[1:10:55] seen the word of God. It was wrote unto
[1:10:57] him and vindicated by God's own hand
[1:10:59] keeping it. And he said you keep every
[1:11:01] word don't you add or take one thing
[1:11:02] away from it. You can read in verse 25
[1:11:04] and 26 verse of Deuteronomy 4 and let me
[1:11:08] hit you with something
[1:11:11] heavy. Why is this so
[1:11:13] important? Well, brother S, it's just,
[1:11:15] you know, it's just simple. Just no,
[1:11:17] there's a
[1:11:21] reason. Notice, don't you add to
[1:11:26] it. Don't take away from it. Because if
[1:11:29] you do, God will take your part out of
[1:11:31] the book of life and it shows you wasn't
[1:11:34] his
[1:11:37] seat. Do you understand what that means?
[1:11:41] Many people have received this
[1:11:43] message. We've got 20 different
[1:11:45] denominational organizational
[1:11:50] things. And I'm not saying they're not
[1:11:52] seed, but saints of God, that's scary.
[1:11:55] It's why it's so important and it shows
[1:11:58] you wasn't his seed. adding or taking
[1:12:01] away he says shows a because what only
[1:12:04] the bride is what connected to the head
[1:12:06] which will only receive the revelation
[1:12:09] comes to the to the body is that the
[1:12:11] word is right the headship is right
[1:12:13] Christ is right in Christ
[1:12:15] alone Jesus said if you love me you he
[1:12:18] says he says you'll keep my
[1:12:21] commandments he says if you want to be
[1:12:23] my disciple indeed he says follow me be
[1:12:26] he says stay with the
[1:12:30] serve. See how dangerous this is? He
[1:12:33] said, "But it's for this
[1:12:36] day." How many believe your bride? How
[1:12:39] many is going to stick with the word?
[1:12:42] Amen. I love how St. is one of always
[1:12:45] been one of my foundational scriptures.
[1:12:48] Prove all
[1:12:51] things. Make sure we know what we're
[1:12:54] talking about. Make sure what? Because
[1:12:56] remember I heard a brother preach. I was
[1:12:57] driving a a
[1:12:59] preach a while back. I listened to a I I
[1:13:02] tried to hone into my pastor service
[1:13:04] because it was their service starts at 2
[1:13:05] o'clock. So, I started around 10
[1:13:06] o'clock. So, I get to listen to my
[1:13:07] pastor's sermons and this and that.
[1:13:09] Well, his the the the the connection on
[1:13:11] the internet wasn't there. It's like,
[1:13:13] okay, well, what Lord, what do you want
[1:13:14] me to listen to? And I jump on YouTube
[1:13:16] and a brother was preaching. I hit it.
[1:13:17] Boom. He said, you know what he said? He
[1:13:19] said, he said, this message is not a
[1:13:23] buffet. What happens in a buffet? Well,
[1:13:26] I like okra. I like fried okra. So, I'll
[1:13:29] take my little plate and I'll bypass the
[1:13:31] green beans. I'm going to bypass the
[1:13:34] corn. And I'm looking for that okra,
[1:13:36] number one, because half my plate's
[1:13:37] going to be okra. And then I'm going to
[1:13:39] go get a little mashed potatoes and
[1:13:40] gravy. And then I'm going to go get a
[1:13:41] little piece of chicken, and that's all
[1:13:43] I want. But saints of God, there's a
[1:13:44] whole bunch more food over there. Saints
[1:13:47] of God, there's a whole bunch more of
[1:13:49] the quotes over here. There's a whole
[1:13:51] bunch more of the scriptures right here.
[1:13:53] Saints of God. We cannot just pick this
[1:13:55] one. and pick this and we've got to take
[1:13:57] everything that God gave us. Amen.
[1:14:00] Roberto said what he says. He said the
[1:14:01] spirit showed me this vision. He says
[1:14:03] I'm storing what? We're storing up food,
[1:14:05] great spiritual vitamins, very great
[1:14:08] spiritual vegetables. What for this end
[1:14:10] time? He there's coming a time where
[1:14:11] you'll need this.
[1:14:16] But it's not a buffet. You can't just
[1:14:18] take one quote just like you can't take
[1:14:21] one scripture and take away and add to
[1:14:23] it or say this is it. this one
[1:14:25] scripture. That's
[1:14:27] it. Let me turn I want to I want to show
[1:14:29] you something powerful. I was teaching
[1:14:31] original sin to some new saints there.
[1:14:34] You're going to love I think you're
[1:14:35] going to love this. And as I read this
[1:14:38] scripture, I completely
[1:14:39] missed literally the one of the main
[1:14:42] points of
[1:14:47] this. You know what you know one of the
[1:14:49] things they don't like about original
[1:14:50] sin? Well, I thought we all had free
[1:14:52] will.
[1:14:54] I thought I thought God g God so loved
[1:14:57] the world. God so loved the world that
[1:14:59] he gave his only begotten son that
[1:15:00] whosoever you know receive the sins
[1:15:02] would have eternal life. Right side
[1:15:05] right there there's no service what God
[1:15:06] loved the whole
[1:15:08] world. Well he did. That's why he paid
[1:15:11] the price for all the sins. What?
[1:15:13] Because everyone has free will free free
[1:15:15] will. Everyone's given opportunity to
[1:15:16] receive this word. Everyone's given an
[1:15:18] opportunity to receive eternal life. But
[1:15:20] depending on what's in them will
[1:15:23] determine on what decisions they'll
[1:15:25] make. Well, I don't like that. Look what
[1:15:27] the scripture says
[1:15:29] here. Second Peter
[1:15:33] 2, verse one. But there were false
[1:15:37] prophets also among the people, even as
[1:15:40] there shall be false teachers among you,
[1:15:43] who privately shall bring in damn
[1:15:46] heresies, even denying the Lord that
[1:15:49] bought
[1:15:51] them. God purchased their sins. God took
[1:15:55] their sins. But what they never they
[1:15:58] deny Christ and their sins are kept on
[1:16:00] them.
[1:16:02] But even these false look denying the
[1:16:05] Lord that bought them and bring upon
[1:16:08] themselves swift destruction he did. He
[1:16:11] purchased all the sins. But remember a
[1:16:13] pardon is only a pardon except if it's
[1:16:15] received as a pardon. Amen.
[1:16:23] He purchased everyone's sins all the way
[1:16:25] from Cain.
[1:16:29] But remember, he can only redeem that
[1:16:32] which was
[1:16:33] redeemable. My sheep hear my voice. A
[1:16:36] stranger, my sheep hear my voice. And
[1:16:40] out of my mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:16:41] sword, which is what? The word of
[1:16:44] God. My sheep hear my voice, and a
[1:16:46] stranger they'll not follow. Amen. Let's
[1:16:49] stand here by God's grace.
[1:16:57] Saints, as I've been out, I minister for
[1:17:01] uh usually the smaller
[1:17:03] assemblies. I was out one time and
[1:17:07] uh I was reading a quote. I shared I
[1:17:11] shared this with brother Jose. I was
[1:17:13] reading a
[1:17:14] quote and in the quote, brother Ram
[1:17:17] actually says it's wrong. He said it
[1:17:18] wrong. He actually said the wrong
[1:17:20] number. And I correct. And when I was
[1:17:23] reading the quote, I didn't say the
[1:17:24] wrong number. I said the correct number
[1:17:27] because I had to bring it back to the
[1:17:28] word. And afterwards, the brother was
[1:17:30] like, "Brother S, you should not have
[1:17:31] done that." And I
[1:17:34] go said, "Why?" He goes, "Well," and he
[1:17:37] had a certain revelation about it. So I
[1:17:39] went back and studied it. Brother Bam
[1:17:41] said, he said, "There was nothing
[1:17:42] spiritual about it. There was no vision
[1:17:44] about this. There's nothing." He said,
[1:17:45] "I just made a mistake.
[1:17:49] But things what became he made his own
[1:17:51] doctrine out of
[1:17:55] these. Amen. Saints
[1:17:59] God, we trust you've been blessed this
[1:18:02] morning. Edified. I want you. I hope I
[1:18:05] hope you seen the importance of keeping
[1:18:08] the
[1:18:09] word. You must run from Genesis
[1:18:12] Revelations. Now remember, here's the
[1:18:14] thing.
[1:18:16] He that
[1:18:18] keepeth the mo the majority of that
[1:18:20] we're the days of revelations right now.
[1:18:23] The revelation of Jesus Christ covers
[1:18:25] all the gentile dispensation. All of it
[1:18:27] even to the tribulation and to the
[1:18:28] lineium and even on beyond eternity.
[1:18:31] Right? So we're right in this book and
[1:18:33] we're at the last age. And the prophet
[1:18:35] said he said it'll be so
[1:18:38] close. Let's ask God to give us
[1:18:40] spiritual discernment on everything we
[1:18:43] hear. Amen. Brother Malai, if you want
[1:18:45] to come up and play for something nice.
[1:18:47] Saints of
[1:18:48] God, let's go home
[1:18:50] tonight. As we eat
[1:18:53] lunch, as we fellowship with your loved
[1:18:57] ones, let's say,
[1:19:00] Lord, Lord, I ask God you would let me,
[1:19:03] let me read something to you. This just
[1:19:05] come to me right here. It's in 1
[1:19:12] John verse 1 John 2
[1:19:18] verse
[1:19:21] 23. Whosoever denith the son hath not
[1:19:25] the
[1:19:26] father. Whosoever denieth the son hath
[1:19:30] not the father.
[1:19:35] What other word could use instead of
[1:19:39] son? In the beginning was the
[1:19:43] word. So whoever has not the word hath
[1:19:47] not the
[1:19:49] father hidden right there laying right
[1:19:53] there. We've got to understand in the
[1:19:55] beginning was the word. The word is with
[1:19:56] God. The word was God's and the word was
[1:19:58] made flesh and that was the son.
[1:20:01] Whosoever denieth the son or the word,
[1:20:04] the same hath not the father. But he
[1:20:06] that acknowledgeth the word hath the
[1:20:08] father
[1:20:09] also. First I How do you
[1:20:12] know? Verse 25. And this is the promise
[1:20:15] that he hath promised us, even eternal
[1:20:18] life. These things have I written unto
[1:20:20] you be concerning them which seduce you.
[1:20:22] But the
[1:20:23] anointing, he says, which ye have
[1:20:25] received from him abideth in you, and
[1:20:27] you have need that no man teach you, but
[1:20:30] is the same anointed teacheth all
[1:20:32] things. Saints of God, that's why you
[1:20:33] need the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:35] That Holy Ghost will teach you all
[1:20:40] things. But as the same anointing
[1:20:42] teaches all things and is truth and is
[1:20:44] no lie, even as it is taught among you,
[1:20:48] you shall abide in him who is what? The
[1:20:52] word is coming down that it's that
[1:20:57] simple. It's this simple, saints of God.
[1:21:00] Jesus is so serious about his bride. Let
[1:21:02] me give you example. When I when I talk
[1:21:04] with my wife Beth, Sister Beth, I said,
[1:21:06] "Babe, when you go to Costco today, I
[1:21:09] want you to pick up this, this, and
[1:21:12] this." And I even write a list. Even
[1:21:15] write it
[1:21:17] plain. And I give her the list. She
[1:21:20] goes,
[1:21:22] "Okay." And she drives driving through
[1:21:25] kind of traffic all the way to Toledo,
[1:21:26] blah blah
[1:21:27] Parisburg. And if she would fail to res
[1:21:30] to get one of the things on that list,
[1:21:32] even though I wrote it, even though it
[1:21:34] was available, and she's like, "Oh, he
[1:21:36] doesn't really mean that. He really
[1:21:38] doesn't. I mean, I've got extra, you
[1:21:40] know, I don't know why he wants a little
[1:21:41] bit extra." Saints of
[1:21:43] God, I would be like, "Why didn't you
[1:21:46] just do what I told you to do?"
[1:21:49] Because remember it's a
[1:21:52] marriage. If we are the wife of God,
[1:21:55] this is our this is our husband right
[1:21:57] here. This will show us what to do.
[1:22:00] Amen.
[1:22:02] But remember this is not only just
[1:22:06] letter but there is an author of this
[1:22:08] letter that's still alive. Amen. The B
[1:22:11] what Jesus said the words that I speak
[1:22:12] are spirit and they are life. God can
[1:22:14] literally you don't even have to hear
[1:22:15] the voice of God. All you have to do
[1:22:16] that word right here will speak to you.
[1:22:19] These are spiritual words, saints of
[1:22:21] God. But if you can't understand
[1:22:22] something in here, we have to go then to
[1:22:24] the spirit. Say, Lord, what do you mean
[1:22:25] by your writing?
[1:22:27] Amen. Amen. All hearts, minds clear,
[1:22:30] saints of God, be determined more than
[1:22:33] ever when you're listening to services
[1:22:35] and this this Lord, is this right? Is
[1:22:38] this right? Is this right? Amen. Amen.
[1:22:41] Praise the Lord. So, let's bow our
[1:22:43] heads.
[1:22:45] Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we love you. And
[1:22:48] Lord, this has been burning in my heart
[1:22:49] for a
[1:22:52] while, Lord. And you know, Lord, when I
[1:22:55] and Lord, we give grace onto because
[1:22:57] Lord, I'm not
[1:22:59] perfect. I'm sure I have taught things
[1:23:01] wrong, Lord. But Lord Jesus, I am open
[1:23:04] to full correction,
[1:23:06] God. And Lord Jesus, Lord, we ask God
[1:23:08] you would be with every
[1:23:10] minister. Lord, that you would guide us
[1:23:12] all to that same full, true, undefiled,
[1:23:16] uncorrupted word of
[1:23:19] God. And Lord, we ask you draw every
[1:23:21] member of the bride, God, Lord, to your
[1:23:24] beating, bloody word of God, Lord Jesus.
[1:23:28] Lord, for the Bible says, wherever the
[1:23:29] carcass is, there will the eagles be
[1:23:32] gathered. And Lord Jesus, Lord, we know
[1:23:34] that carcass cannot be corrupted. We
[1:23:36] know that carcass was resurrected, God.
[1:23:39] And Lord Jesus, we've have we have it
[1:23:41] now in letter form, God. We have it in
[1:23:43] Bible form, Lord. And Lord Jesus, Lord,
[1:23:46] these words are not this letter does not
[1:23:49] kill us, Lord. It gives us strength,
[1:23:50] God. Give us revelation, God. And Lord
[1:23:52] God, we thank you, Lord, for these
[1:23:54] revelations, Lord. Thank you for give us
[1:23:57] understanding, God, but Lord, we what
[1:23:59] great Lord, continue to magnify your
[1:24:01] word. Continue to show us the finer
[1:24:04] details, God. Lord, for your prophet
[1:24:07] said, he said only the very elect would
[1:24:09] be able to detect the true from the
[1:24:11] false, Lord. Direct quote,
[1:24:14] Lord. And Lord, we love you, Lord. We
[1:24:17] ask you be with our pastor, Brother
[1:24:19] Jesse. Lord, strengthen, Lord. Keep him
[1:24:22] on your word, Lord Jesus. God, Lord,
[1:24:24] help us, Lord, to continue, Lord, to
[1:24:26] fast and pray in secret, God. Give arms
[1:24:28] in secret, God. And Lord Jesus, we want
[1:24:31] to do everything, Lord, unto you. Lord,
[1:24:32] that so you're the only one that sees,
[1:24:34] Lord, our true hearts. Lord, you are the
[1:24:36] only one to see our true work, our true
[1:24:39] desire to hear from you, Lord God, are
[1:24:42] hungering and thirsting, Lord, in secret
[1:24:44] for you, Lord, we love you. Lord, I
[1:24:47] believe you, Lord. You've been here. And
[1:24:49] Lord God, we ask, God, that your
[1:24:50] revelation, Lord, whatever you would
[1:24:52] have, Lord, for your wife here, God, for
[1:24:54] your bride, God, was heard, Lord, that
[1:24:56] it was brought to them, Lord. Lord, we
[1:24:59] tried to show it in the word. Lord, we
[1:25:00] show you. We showed some of the things,
[1:25:02] Lord, your prophet had said, God. And
[1:25:04] Lord Jesus, we pray it made an impact.
[1:25:06] How important, Lord, to stay, Lord, that
[1:25:09] our foundation is rock that, Lord, your
[1:25:11] church is built on revelation. We are
[1:25:14] give us strength Lord.
