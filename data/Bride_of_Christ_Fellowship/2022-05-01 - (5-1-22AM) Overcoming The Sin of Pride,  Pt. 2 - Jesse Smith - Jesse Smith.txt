when you're next to the bleeding side of the lord jesus christ praise god thank god for his word today let's turn in our bibles here to first john chapter 2 verse 15. i'd like to continue on this little thought on overcoming pride so we'll try to minister here by the grace of the lord first john 2 verse 15. first john 2 verse 15 overcoming pride if we can overcome pride there are great blessings for us praise god great rewards for us if we can just overcome pride first john 2 15. remember pride is self-confidence having a very high opinion of yourself first john 2 15. i'll read 15 we'll all read 16 and then i'll read 17 alone love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him let's read verse 16 1 2 3 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world i'll read 17 myself and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever and the church said amen how many one abide forever with christ amen let's have a word of prayer let's do the will of god today heavenly father we worship you again we thank you for these beautiful songs lord we feel near to the cross today lord god because of your grace because of these songs because of your mercy and our lives what a wonderful cross lord as we sing that song oh the wonderful cross lord god hallelujah thank you jesus for taking our cross taking our shame taking the curse that would have been upon us and taking the curse on you lord and paying the price hallelujah of our redemption of our healing lord god of our peace you paid for all of it lord god you paid the ransom lord that great high price lord upon our souls thank you god lord that your son became the sacrifice for our souls hallelujah thank you jesus for purchasing our souls lord and so lord we just which is our reasonable service we just present our bodies back to you we present our minds back to you this morning as a living sacrifice unto you we will now live for your glory we will now live for your sake dear god so lord take this service anoint me anoint your people father god that you might be glorified i pray you minister to all the needs lord god only you can do it anyhow there's only one real preacher there's only one song leader really that's you lord jesus there's only one real of anything lord god that's you lord god you're the great physician you're the great healer you're the great deliverer lord god we're trusting in you today lord jesus i pray you speak through mortal flesh today god bless your people through the spoken word in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i do have some uh quotes to share in some scriptures so whenever you're ready you can switch over there hunted by god's grace i'd like to uh just briefly reverse you know last week we looked at uh pride you know where it started we looked at where it started with satan and satan exalted of course himself against god and said i will be like the most high he never said i'll be greater than the most high he knew he couldn't do that but he said i will be like the most high and he kept exalting himself to be someone great can you imagine he convinced a third of the angels that he could exalt and be equal to god and he could have a throne that would be equal to god because of pride because of his beauty and because of his wisdom he was he was the one the smartest of all the angels he was the most beautiful of all the angels he was the of course he had all these pipes and tablets on him as well a musical uh angel as well he was the wisest most beautiful smartest and yet because of that that's what corrupted his heart and brother man tells us that to our sisters you know sisters be careful if you're really pretty brothers you be careful if you're really handsome most of us don't have to worry about that praise god but he said the thing that you think may be so great if you're not careful the enemy will deceive you with that and it can actually become a hindrance to you rather than a help look at elvis presley he was handsome when he was younger he could really sing but what happened he allowed the devil to get in there and the devil uses his good looks and his voice and perverted all the gifts that god had given to him and he died as an old man and uh he didn't live very long actually i think he died in his 50s and what a sad life it was and all bloated and uh and he died the very last day he was reading books about witchcraft and that's when he overdosed on drugs you would think a man that was raised in a pentecostal church that knew the power of god and knew the ram knew elvis mother brother man knew elvis's original pastor and would talk him talk to them about it and brother brown would call him a modern day judas iscariot see church the very sometimes the very things where we think our blessings if we're not careful the enemy can use those against us in other words we've got to yield everything that we have we got to yield everything that we are to god praise god and not take any confidence in ourselves remember pride is just self-confidence well i can trust in myself i've done this before i've got the power i've got the ability to do this we've got to leave that idea behind praise god and every day we got to depend on god hallelujah and depend upon his promises as we'll see here today by the grace of god we'll look at uh numerous things i'm going to go from jesus uh to israel and then to jesus disciples that's that's kind of where i felt led to go in this morning and yesterday i was as i was preparing and at the end of this service i'm going to show some uh videos of prideful preachers i'm going to show some we'll stop the livestream at the end i just feel that like i'm going to share it today and so you can see it i've been working on it you know for months and months just picking a little bit here and there and um and may god help us to always be humble that's our prayer may god help us to humble ourselves all the time so i thought you know i had this thought i was listening to a few sermons on pride and i just had this thought well we should go back and see what jesus said about pride we should see what jesus said about humility because if anybody knew anything about anything it was jesus praise god hallelujah god in flesh hallelujah so let's look at jesus's words on pride and humility i think there was only five for four times he said the word humble uh in his that's recorded in the gospels so let's look at those here if we can uh in john 18 1-6 we'll start there someone come up and ask jesus who is the greatest in the kingdom that's a good question right we all want to be we all want to be something in god's kingdom and we would all and we can say this humbly we'd all like to be the most useful we can to god we would all like to how many would like to please god the very best you possibly could so see there's a desire that we want in other words we want to do something great for god but but it's not to exalt ourselves there's a great difference there i want to do something for god but not that i'm glorified but that god is glorified but all but i do want to know that i've done my part i've done what god's asked me to do praise god i want that satisfaction praise god to know that i've done what god asked me to do i was able to uh receive his strength and re and and understand his word and and accept his guidance in my life and that that i know that i found the path i found the narrow path amen i want to know that i did that praise god and so they set a little child in their midst there and i'm going to go to john i'm sorry i'm going to matthew 18 now and just rehearse what jesus said there just a beautiful text here this is where most people get the statement faith like a child you've heard that before that actual statement is not in the scripture but it's it's kind of combined with uh matthew 18 and mark 10. they said who is the greatest in the kingdom in of heaven in verse one and notice he takes a little child and sets him in the midst of them there's all these all these big guys all these strong men and all these wonderful women and and jesus when they ask him he finds one tiny little child and just sets the child he just says stay right there now notice the child doesn't argue with jesus the child doesn't complain with jesus the child doesn't rebuke jesus the child just obeys jesus the child just does what jesus says amen hallelujah simplicity he just says sit right here child i'm placing you right here and the child does and then the child lets jesus do all the talking amen hallelujah that's what we want today amen speak from heaven jesus amen amen speak from heaven let not my thoughts be in it may it be your word amen verse 4 whoever whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven who can humble himself like a child verse 5 and whoso shall receive one such little one in my name receiveth me now we're getting down look at this thought now jesus says if you can just receive a child in the name of jesus so we can't always look who's got the most adults in the ministry sometimes we've got to look who's got the biggest heart to serve children praise god because jesus says whoever receives a little child in my name receives me praise god now let me say this for our church we don't have a sunday school teacher well i guess i am but if you want to do a before service sunday school it would take someone who's dedicated to children and if nobody feels qualified that's fine i'm still happy to do it on sunday night but that's i'm just trying to give you that thought now notice all these churches you know they can have morning sunday school teachers and that's a blessing and if those it's beautiful if those sunday school teachers the women no matter how old are young if they just want to receive those children in the name of jesus to point them to jesus i'll say that this great is their reward amen because jesus said when you receive a child in my name you receive me hallelujah thank god verse 6 but who shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that they were drowned in the depth of the sea there's going to be a lot of people in hell because they mistreated children and that will just be a corrupt fruit that would just be a fruit of the wickedness that was already in their heart because anyone with natural affection anyone with any decency anyone with any honesty would look at a child as one of the greatest blessings there ever was because it's a functioning person it's there's there's uh it's a smiling hat and usually smiling happy child you know and brings so much joy like just like with zion he's learning how to talk it's so much fun like just hearing how to talk and and just all these blessings that come out you know as they grow and as they as they mature and as they come into what god made them to be in other words you see god's purity in a child you see god's beauty in a child amen you see god's power in a child hallelujah and so jesus when he's asked who's the greatest he finds the little child and says look up here whoever can humble himself like a little child that's who the greatest in the kingdom of heaven is amen in other words anyone can i say this anyone who can just lay in jesus's presence and just do what the holy spirit says do and not fight about it not fuss about it not debate about it well jesus you i think you should do this and said i think i should do that not to debate with the lord but just to be a humble child and sit in his presence and hear his word let him speak hallelujah amen he said he's the greatest in the kingdom of god now let's remember now let's go to the old testament who is the grace of the old testament john the baptist john the baptist was greater than enoch moses imagine that my goodness and he only had six months of ministry church that just struck me moses had 40 years abraham had from 75 to 175 abraham had 100 years of service to god and he's the father of the faith and he's still not the greatest because it's not a glory it's not about the number of years it's about the quality of service amen hallelujah oh there it is it's not always quantity it's quality hallelujah amen ah that just struck me right there amen hallelujah six months here we're in the fifth month of 2020 how's you how's your year been 2022. you've had a good year this could be a great year and this could be a great minute six months a ministry was greater than 40 years in a hundred years now what did he do though he forsook everything and he went out and lived in the wilderness to lay before the lord can i say it like that amen to be like a child to wait on the lord he didn't multiply women to himself like solomon and david did he glory amen he didn't exalt himself like moses look what i've done i'm bringing the water out of a rock you bunch of rebels now he rebuked the pharisees for sure six months of preaching and that probably said not one miracle other than the miracle of soul saved amen so church this is totally changing my whole idea around about who's the greatest it's not about how long you've served god it's about the quality of your service to god hallelujah and then brother baby said he was greatest also because he didn't just talk about jesus he introduced jesus amen amen he got to handle the word amen he held him he handled him praise god and look in the very presence of jesus he humbled himself he said he said i'm not the one that needs to baptize you you need to baptize me amen so when he was in the presence of god and flesh he humbled himself there as well and only did it because jesus said so like a child okay okay god i'm like a child whatever you say i'll do it so see church whenever we get the word of god and we just do what the word of god says that's like a child so whether it's through a sermon or whether it's just reading your bible at home wherever it is when you just get the word of god and you obey it that's a child hallelujah like i can tell my kid the kids in my class are gonna say take this down the office they'll say why i said because i said so and they'll just go okay mr smith okay you know whatever's in there it might be money in there or it might be notes in there they'll just do it they just do it they don't now sometimes they question but not all the time you know they're just simple if the word says it i believe it i'll do it jesus said if you want to be great in the kingdom of god hallelujah be like a child humble yourself like a child just sit there listen and then act on it and obey it praise god like what man said about those seraphim in heaven remember isaiah saw the seraphim it had six wings two on the face two wings and then two on the feet brother branham said the two on the on the face uh were reverence and reverse reverence means an admiration for god so catch this the one that faces i adore god i'm covering my face my wings are covered because i adore god so reverence is a key to being a real servant of god amen you have to adore god recognize how great he is what were the wings on the feet romans said that was humility because god said take off your shoes moses you're on holy ground amen what's humility it's a low idea of yourself so the face is a high idea about god humility is the esteem of yourself amen glory and what's the two wings he said in service in action in other words obeying the word of god hallelujah amen now you got a real christian right there praise god i got a real angel a real messenger from god amen one that thinks god is so great he's so great i admire me he's so mighty i reverence him one that thinks so little of yourself i'm nothing i can't do anything without god but then one that obeys the word and obeys the promises as in the action is doing the actions of obedience now we're on to something real there amen the seraphim speaks of your life and isn't sixth six was the number there six number of anointed man right adam sixth day totally holy you got six pieces of armor for the armor of god hallelujah thank god amen six wings reverence humility action that's a real servant of god let's all say let's say i'm a servant of god ready i'm a servant of god i'm a servant of god i'll reverence him he'll be so great i'll humble myself i'm nothing i don't have any power and ability but i will act upon his word amen i will serve god amen i will act upon the promises that he's revealed to me praise god remember you can't act on anything until god's first revealed it to you god has to reveal it to you first then you can act on it right like i don't know if i'm healed until god reveals and then i know i'm healed amen so we must wait on the lord even for that now here's the parallel passage so off of that now mark 10 15. verily i say unto you whosoever shall receive the kingdom of god as the little child shall not enter therein so a child quickly so the truth is then a child will quickly embrace what you say right they'll a child will quickly approve of what you say if you tell them something okay yes i receive it they'll quickly learn what you say now that's good or bad hopefully you'll get it for the most part and the child will get what you say so jesus says that's a child who's that's a humble child that's a humble servant of god you quickly approve of what god says you embrace what god says you can learn what god is saying hallelujah you can hear what the spirit says to the church amen hallelujah now i just was reading this commentary and john gill said he was commentating on this verse and he says this was verified so who's the greatest in the kingdom of god john gill thought paul now that's my belief too i believe paul was the great was the greatest christian there ever was that's my humble opinion i kind of felt like john gill vindicated that for me though he is not one of the twelve because in his own words he said i was the chief of sinners see because he blasphemed the lord before but he didn't know better he took he consented to the death of christians so now we know what the chief of sinners are they blaspheme the holy ghost they want christians to die that's the chief of sinners he said i'm also less than the least of all saints so he truly believed i'm the least of all of them right he said also said i'm not worthy to be called an apostle we said today i'm not worthy to be a preacher i could say that i'm not worthy of it all right we could all say i'm not worthy to be where god has placed me but that's what paul said i'm not worthy because of what i've done because of my past i'm not worthy on the lease of all of them yet john gill said too he had the largest measures of grace he had the greatest gifts and abilities he spoke in tongues more than everybody he prophesied he wrote church he wrote the bible that we'll be judged by john wesley didn't do that brother brahm didn't do that martin luther didn't do that the gospel that jesus gave paul will be what we are judged by that that's the law we'd say that that's the standard that we're judged by praise god the law of the holy spirit not legalism but the law of the holy spirit because there has to be a judgment standard somewhere or else grace is no more grace right shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how can we be that are dead to sin live and sin any longer praise god amen hallelujah gil said god honored paul with the greatest usefulness and success in the preaching of the gospel can you imagine what amen he would go into a city and just sit down at a river and there would be lydia and open up her heart to the lord and just a church would spring up out of there he'd go he'd leave he'd write a letter later and tell the philippians all about their lives and all about the godhead he go to colossae well i'm sorry he didn't go there timothy went to colossae uh the start of the church there praise god i'm sorry epiphanes epiphanes he'd stay there at ephesus and he started church in ephesus everywhere where this man went churches were starting praise god amen and his letters that he wrote to them were directly from jesus and we're still reading them today we're still gaining strength from them right now praise god and that's what will judge all of us that's what will judge brother branham that he preached what paul preached hallelujah now look this is and this is god's grace too this is god's grace paul exalted himself in pride so much right killing christians but then jesus humbled him so much so he was high he was brought low but then because of his obedience he was brought back high again amen but not in sinful pride but in holy honor that god gave him praise god because he gave his life away he could have married but he turned that down he said i got a gift not to marry i can just please the lord i can start all these churches i can write these letters and he gave his life as a sacrifice he planted all those churches and then he said at the end of his life he says i've labored more than they all not i but yet the grace of god that was in me praise god so even at the end he he gave all the credit to grace he gave all the credit to god's unmerited favor in other words god was giving him favor to start churches god was giving favor to write the word of god god was giving him favor to see visions and dream dreams and operating gifts god was giving that favor and he said it's not me it's god's grace that's how we should live amen when something good comes out of my life it was god's grace it wasn't me it was god's grace amen hallelujah if not then we get self-confident well hey look what i can do now i i'm a pretty good fellow now well i'm pretty good preacher i'm i'm a pretty good uh housewife i'm a pretty good worker i'm really something when we realize we're nothing we should realize we're nothing the greatest in the kingdom of heaven is like a child see that's where it is paul would just say lord he said lord where do you want me to go missionary work and god would say don't go to asia go over there to the city of corinth i've got men i've got much people in that city see he didn't as a child he didn't fight against god said no i'm going to asia there's there's millions there you know he followed the leadership of the holy spirit like a child would follow a parent praise god see just laying before the lord what does the child do they lay before the lay before jesus they lay before the parent and they just obey that's what they're supposed to do now you put enough cartoons in them they're not going to do that i've seen it put enough screens in front of them they're not going to do that they're going to fight you but even after a few days of school i can get them trained the right way you know where to they'll finally they'll finally do it by god's grace gotta take away the screen time though you gotta show you gotta show them love too gotta show them love now here's a second verse where jesus talks about being humble he that is greatest among you shall be your servant whosoever shall exalt himself god will abase god will bring them low and he that humble himself god shall exalt now before this it's really striking if you look at this is the chapter where jesus says he says eight woes to the pharisees he gives them eight woes in other words they're destined for hell they're destined for plagues at the white throne judgment before jesus said this he'd already rebuked the pharisees for saying things but not doing them church we don't want to make promises that we don't keep you and i are no better than our word if you say you're going to do something you better do it right because this was the this was the pharisees thing they would say well moses said this and that but then they wouldn't do it themselves that's called hypocrisy right actors acting like they believed moses when really they didn't believe moses that's why when preachers say something let's let's have the preachers do what they say they need to do what they say because jesus is rebuking preachers and then he's saying well they must have they must have exalted themselves so now jesus is humbling them and these lazy preachers won't move a finger to help others burdens they see the burns out there but they won't do nothing at church we got cell phones we can at least do something we can at least do something with our finger i'm praying for you we can at least text people that right i mean we can do something with our fingers amen do something but they wouldn't even move a finger in other words they were all talk and no action may god help us to be talk and action amen reverence humility action amen hallelujah now we can't do everything right we can't do ever can't help every person in the earth but we can act on some people's behalf right the bible says have compassion on some not everybody you can't have compassion on everybody else you never get any sleep you never go to work you just be you just be having compassion all the time and you run out of resources real fast but have compassion on some and make a difference in somebody's life amen and they only did public works they didn't do anything in private it was all about see me i'm a show watch my life i'm just putting on a show it was all about public works they loved the public seats and public greetings now this is one thing i never learned they love to be called rabbi this is my great one i never knew that i was like what so they would say oh my great one how are you the great one oh they love the people called it call me great call me and we're going to show this at the end call me great call me great oh yeah call me rabbi call me rabbi i'm the great one they love to hear you're so great you're so great you're so great and yet they wouldn't lift a finger to help out anybody they were rich and increase with goods and didn't have need of any more of god and jesus says don't be like them they've exalted themselves you be humble praise god or my honorable sir i just came i couldn't believe that my dear honorable sir preacher pastor you've got to call me that or else you're not addressing me the right way in public i don't care if you call me pastor in public brother brother jesse i don't care what you call me just call me just call me a christian that's how i want to be hey man just call me your brother call me a christian that's all i want to be i know i'm not great praise god i'll let we'll let god be the judge of that amen hallelujah let's say it again god will be the judge of who's greatest among us amen let's not exalt ourselves with that type of uh pride i'll say like that that type of flattery the flattering tongue worketh ruin i learned that i learned that even before i come to the message when i first became a christian back in 2000 i started reading my niv bible now i don't know how i i don't know how i made it brother i'll be honest it was god's grace but i read in there that flattering titles and proverbs will worketh ruin in other words when somebody comes up and flatters you and tells you how great you are and you know they're going overboard with it that will cause you to fall they're trying to exalt you so that you'll fall to exalt themselves right and i had friends on the college scene before i come to the message that i felt like that would try to you know you know how i do it you know you know how i know that they'd say all this exalting and then they want to wrestle me in front of all the the girls you know to like show them how strong they were i'm like this don't work here like you're exalt me over here but now you're trying to beat me up you know in other words they're trying to get my guard down because they like to wrestle and headlocks and show off you know well i was probably just as sinful as they were you know many ways but i knew something's wrong with that why are you exalting me in private and then to my face and then trying to fight me over here and exalt yourself above me over there of us we've been through some things in denominations we've been through some things in the message church too amen you know you've got to thank god god's he's allowing it all for a purpose you're to learn all along the way learn along the journey you're going to find faults in me you're going to find faults in our church there's faults everywhere praise god as soon as you if there's no fault there as soon as you get there you're the fault in the cherishing you've heard it said of course there's no perfect church anyway except the one that's over by the blood they already got new bodies that's the only perfect church praise god but see after all these prideful things jesus says the greatest will be the servant not the one who's called call me rabbi call me call me your most noble excellent brother call me the great one when you greet me and yet they're not doing any they won't even move a finger to slide somebody a 20 bill right and when you move a finger won't even do that they won't do nothing they just want glory they just want worship because jesus said you're of your father the devil is that right that's right so look at this so in one the first case they asked who's the greatest he says child the second case he rebukes all these religious people and said who's the greatest the servant's the greatest not the one who gets all the public praise that's why church brother adam said this and it was so inspired there's gonna be a lot of surprises on the day of judgment the bible says some men's sins go before them others men's sins are known on this side we only know about the ones whose sins are on this side we don't know the ones that were hidden we'll find out over there so what what should we do then brother jesse repent every single service repent every single day make sure your sins are blotted out amen glory so there's no sins to go before you amen because they're all under the blood they're all buried in the sea of forgetfulness hallelujah so there can be no sins go before me amen it's just mercy it's just forgiveness that goes before me hallelujah the lord goes before me amen hallelujah granted jesus that will humble ourselves and constantly repent that we do not get exalted with pride next one is luke 14 7. i'm going to go and turn there you can turn there if you like you don't have to bless you 14 7 through 14. here jesus gives two illustrations for being humble so let's see if we can understand this and how it may relate to our lives and he put forth the parable to that to those which were bit when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying to them when our when thou art bitten of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honorable man than thou be bitten of him and he that made thee and him come and say unto thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room but when thou art bidding go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that obeyed thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have worship in the friends of them that sit at meat with thee for whosoever exalteth himself shall be a base and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted so in jesus day uh public feasts in in places was a very big thing not so much today right not so much today like i was even thinking yesterday you go to a wedding the places are already picked out for you right went to that wedding they're already picked out for you we know the seats of honor the seats of honor are for the husband and wife this is their day and they should be honored if they've honored god and they've put god first and they've lived holy lives they should be honored right up there and then the family should be honored because mom and dad put up with them all those years before they got saved they should have a place of honor but you know weddings for us that doesn't really apply to us because we don't pick out the seats so we'd have to use a place where where do we get to choose the seats and in all those situations we should choose with the mindset of i'm going to choose the most humble place right so going out to eat or fellowshipping you know choose a humble place now our room is so small over there i don't think there is a highest seat over there i don't think there is if you know it let me know because i don't see one in there there's really not a good seat in there so i'm just trying to think how can that apply to us well just anytime you're at a church fellowship outside of our church where there's a big place to eat you know now when we go out to eat another public place i like to sit by the brothers if i can you know because i just you know i think that's a godly thing to do you know you don't really want to try to sit if i'm a married man i don't want to try to sit with married women you know i'm going to try to sit with the brothers you know that's a that's a godly that's a holy thing to do praise god so that part of our life you know uh it's not the same now jesus moves on to a part where we can we can definitely do this one verse 12 then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest a dinner or supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbors lest they also bid thee again and recompense be made thee but when thou make us a feast called the poor the man the lot the lit i'm sorry the maimed the lame and blind and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just now in those days it was very common if someone come to your door and knock it was hospitality was very important in those days and you every time you let them in every time there was no like jesus told a parable if somebody come ask you at midnight for food because you've got to guess jesus said because you love them you open your door you'll give them food even at midnight now somebody come knocking down my my house at midnight i can't promise i'd open because i turn off my phone i don't i want to sleep that's my time to sleep i got a lot to do tomorrow but those days are different you know those days were different but here you know and and uh so the the poor would just walk out on the streets and so anytime the poor could knock and want to come in and so you would have people in all the time visiting well that's not our it's not our american life is not like that you know we all live in nice parts of nice parts of akron or our different towns we live in you know and there's not people there's not beggars walking by your house all the time is there probably not so in this case uh like i said in this case i don't invite them to my house but i can take a meal to them in other words what i take from this since i don't have beggars walking by my house and i'm glad i don't you know in some ways what i take from this is that i want to give food to others i want to give people money that can't pay me back amen that's the main idea here i'm not giving to get back i'm giving to be a blessing because i know the father will give it back amen amen because when you lend to the lord well i'm sorry when you went to the land of the poor you lend to the lord praise god so jesus is looking at the heart of it your heart your heart's got to be in it i don't want a rich person to invite me over that's not what i want that's not why i'm doing this i'm doing it because i see poor uh crippled people hurt people and i want to be a blessing to them praise god so eastern life was way different from western life but the the principles the same i want to give to someone who can't give back to me and then jesus says great is your reward in heaven because then you're like your father in heaven who gives to the just the unjust to the thankful and the unthankful then you become like god let's go to luke 18 verse 9. so these are all portions where jesus christ tells us about what is pride versus what is humility in verses 9 through 17 and luke 18 he gives us two more illustrations for being humble public prayer and again he goes back to a child luke 18 9. and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others now look at that church look at this it's real important that we don't miss this we cannot trust in our own righteousness my wife and i were talking about this yesterday the longer you serve god the closer you get to going to heaven in other words the longer you serve god the closer you get to the light and the closer i get to the light the more uh the more scars i see right the more the more mistakes and blemishes oh there's a blemish there blemish there i got a freckle there you know the closer you get to god and jose could say amen to this i'm sure you know in beatrice you know and bertha the closer you get to god the more you realize i have no righteousness when you're young you got strength and you can get up early and you can just do everything you want to do because you're strong you feel like wow i'm really something no wonder god uses me but as you get older you get weaker and tired amen and you don't have the same strength but you're at the same time you're getting closer to the light amen and you realize anything good that was in my life it was because of god and it's not my righteousness that god used me it was to glorify his righteousness he used me so jesus tells a story not to trust in what you can do your goodness now this this hits home for me because i i really do i really desire to fast but these guys were fastened too and jesus said they left the church they were not forgiven so see just because we fast doesn't mean we're holy in the church there i thought i'd get a couple more emails today as much as i preach i'm fasting if the only way it benefits you if it's done with the right spirit everything must be done with the right spirit two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other republican now let me stop there remember the pharisees they had their own mission or they had their own interpretation of what moses said they basically were like the mormons they had their own bible to interpret the bible okay and remember simon brought that good thought out they basically said if you don't wash your hands you're the same as you should you should die because you don't follow our traditions i thought that was a really good thought no wonder they're arguing jesus why don't your disciples wash their hands because that was a creed that meant so much to them that was a self-righteous legalistic creed it meant so much to them and jesus said the bible don't even say that amen he says why do you they they accuse jesus why are you transgressing the traditions of men and jesus said why are you transgressing the tradition of god amen i'd rather transgress the tradition of men rather than the tradition of god amen hallelujah in other words let me obey every word of god i don't care what men or women think or denominations or churches i only care what god says hallelujah the pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself now look he prayed with himself he wasn't praying with god amen god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice a week i give tithes of all that i possess amen he said that's his prayer all right that's his prayer god thank you that i'm not an adulterer thank you that i don't steal from people thank you that i fast and pray and thank you i'm not like this poor wicked person over here and yet he had all those wicked sins like washing his hands he believed all these creeds of men so he wasn't so holy like you thought was he at the same time he must have hated jesus because all the pharisees hated jesus thank god that i can do all these things and thank god i'm not like this other guy over here see it's not about even what you do it's about the heart that you do it with because jesus said when when the bridegroom is gone then will my servants fast so jesus servants will fast but they do it with the right attitude they do it with the right motivation i'm fat i'm depriving my body of food that my soul can receive spiritual food hallelujah not so i'm going to fast because i'm better than this guy at church i'm fast because i'm i'm going to fast so i'm better than this sister that's why they fasted they purposely did that and see while they're fast and they won't they won't even push a finger to help somebody they won't even push a finger then when you lift a finger to maybe hand them a coin it won't even do that in their traditions and creeds of men can everybody say amen remember jesus said they love to make long prayers at the church so everybody can hear him say man the right way holy father oh my i get those echoes of that catholic church when brother uh william and i went there i'm like i better not try to mimic it you know it sound bad so one guy goes up and he prays basically to himself goodness thank god i'm so good thank god i'm not like these sinners over here and yet this guy was full of creeds full of hatred for jesus all these things he hated the message of the hour there it is right there amen hallelujah he despised the message of the hour and god's prophet hallelujah yet fasting twice a week paying tithes every time you it's a good thing you do pay ties we couldn't have this place if you don't make times we can do a lot of things if we don't pay tithes amen but see he was it was all show it was all public show oh there it is the bible said uh remember the bible said you should not uh commend yourselves by by yourselves you shouldn't judge yourself by other people just judge yourself by the word of god amen remember i showed that scripture from paul it's it's wrong he said how dare any of you commend yourselves by yourselves in other words i shouldn't look at brother amen's life for brother austin's life and say lord thank god i'm not doing like them and they shouldn't do that to me right we don't judge ourselves by ourselves we all judge ourselves we all look in the mirror of god's word and say this is what i'm striving to be make me more like jesus amen well i know i fast uh i know i fast more than zion so i'm doing good i'm doing real good there but that's how they come to church right thank god i don't do it like them i'm so much better there it is greatness again always about how great i am i tell the brother i sent a brother a message this week and i said and in this message he said he said jess he said you're the best now that made me feel good that i'm like i'm nothing so i sent a message back and i said i said and this is a good thought here one time i heard brother donnie reagan preach i've loved a lot of things about brother downey's ministry and he was just starting the service he said friends he said he said we need the grace of god he said friends what if all of our evil thoughts from this week could be put up on the screen he said how many of us would be here in the service like if i put up your evil thoughts this week would you want to come back to church if i put my evil thoughts up here she could see the thoughts would i want to come to church no i'd be i'd be sick i couldn't make it that service i thought wow what wisdom what wisdom because we all fall short of god's glory i texted that brother back i said brother i'm nothing i said if any good thing comes out of my life it was jesus he gets the credit he finally got he kind of he chased me he spanked me spanking his mate me until i finally listened to him because i said in my flesh dwells no good thing and my mind is a battlefield amen constant death and destruction going on and just blowing not the right thoughts you want to have amen all the time wars and rumors of wars wars in the mind i mean just it's an awful place sometimes amen i wouldn't want my thoughts projected up on the screen all the time i probably and i told that brother i said i probably wouldn't have many friends i probably my children probably wouldn't like me very much and my wife probably wouldn't like me very much and my church probably wouldn't like me very much you know because i'm human church we're all human all of us shouldn't be able to say amen to that amen if we shared what we actually thought oh my thank god for the blood of jesus amen that's all i'm saying see even this week you know you know people say nice things that i try and then the holy spirit i feel good but the holy spirit says no don't feel good you're you're not and that's true i'm not none of us are but this guy at church is like i fast twice a week i pay tithes thank god i'm not like this guy let's finish that parable luke 18. i closed my bible on accident sorry i have to find my place again luke 18. these are simple but powerful truths the lord jesus gives us verse 13 the public is standing afar off now look he wouldn't even stand close to this guy he was so humble he was so devastated by his sins amen he couldn't get close to these people this guy that the people thought was holy this holy god even his position showed he was a humble person would not even so lift up his eyes to have you ever feel like that you ever feel so low you can't even lift your head to heaven because you're ashamed of yourself he wouldn't lift up his eyes to heaven because he was so ashamed of himself but smote upon the breast now see it became physical glory it hurt his sins hurt him so much it became physical he had to just hit himself god you know it he was so burdened by his sin he wanted just to feel he wanted to feel like a physical want to give like a physical sign god you feel you feel the hurting that's inside of me you know you know i mean business this hurts i've sinned against heaven he beat upon his breast and saying god be merciful to me a sinner now which guy did jesus forgive thank god i'm not an adulterer thank god i'm not a murderer thank god i'm not a cusser ain't got an i'm not a murderer murdering babies yet would have all these other sins that they can hide verse 14. i tell you this man went down to the house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and the church said so what do you how do you pray when you come to church let me just bring it down to us how should i pray when i come to church oh god thank you that i fasted this week thank you that i preached five times this week thank you god it's really it's it's insane to think that now there's a way there's a way there's another side there's a way to say thank like if you're crying weep and saying thank god i don't cuss anymore thank god but this guy was purposely comparing himself to that guy like looking down on him in pride he was exalting himself oh i'm not like this little this low sinner way far off there look how great i am look how holy i am humility jesus says this guy that beats himself on the chest he's going to be exalted churchill let me say like this maybe not in this life but he'll be exalted in heaven hallelujah amen because not everybody hallelujah brother bang gets exalted on this side amen sometimes the exalting is saved for later hallelujah that's exactly right how about the rich how about the beggar lazarus was he exalted on this side jesus said if you humble yourself you'll be exalted was he exalted not on this side no he died as a beggar amen he died as a beggar oh i tell you he was exalted when the angels dropped him down and took him right in the bosom of abraham and he could just lay there can i see your lap buddy oh father abraham thank you hallelujah that was the time he was exalted i'd rather have that than man's empty praise amen hallelujah amen the exalting will not always take place on this side but you've got to trust in god humble me lord humble me and i know you'll exhaust me when i'm ready for it praise god this is the son of god talking about humility and pride so now we've got four illustrations on how to be humble choose the lowest seats give food to people that will cannot can never pay you back that means they're always going to be poor their whole life god has something rich god has some poor church i just realized god just made me rich compared to most people and as an american i am so rich i have every meal i need i mean we're so rich we're so rich so that means god has chosen you to be rich and when you're chosen to be rich then you've got to be generous praise god it's mandatory you we must be generous hallelujah because you were chosen to be rich don't raise your hands but how many of you have missed meals because you had no money i doubt anybody has i mean maybe maybe down in el salvador probably not just it's just for perspective church it's just it's just for our humbling purposes to think about these things and then public prayer again can show if we're humble or prideful and then a child verse 15 and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked him i'm sorry rebuke them but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is of the kingdom of heaven verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall no wise enter therein just receive just accept just embrace the kingdom of god just like a child would praise god in other words if god has something written his word just believe it right now some things are conditional we remember that last week but if you know it's an unconditional promise like pride and humility it's unconditional right there's no conditions where god wants you prideful and the church said none like tithes and offerings there's no condition where god wants you to rob him right that's unconditional you must give tithes you must give offerings you must do these things right so if the bible simply says it then let's just believe it receive it do it act upon it praise god that's humble christianity and i'm saying like this it's the only kind of christianity hallelujah i haven't been keeping track how long ago so i'm not going to worry about it today my body's off i'm all i'm all relaxed here today praise god mark 7 14. now here's the beautiful i mentioned this in the prayer this scripture is on my heart mark 7 14. church when we catch ourselves and let me let me be honest and if you catch yourself this week and you will if you catch yourself being prideful this week and you will we just have to remember this is coming out of a part of me that's not yet holy but one day it will be holy and one day there will be no more pride that comes out of this being amen pride you just got a short time to dwell but after that you're gone buddy not buddy you're gone evil you're gone evil one you wicked one that's sin nature mark 7 14. uh this is jesus again verse 15. there's nothing from without a man that entering into him could defile him but those things that's that come out of the man those that are they that defile man if if any man have ears to hear let him hear now jesus kind of uh rebukes them in verse 18 they say can you explain this what do you mean nothing i put my body defiles me in verse 18 and you say unto them are ye so without understanding also do you not perceive that whatsoever thing from without and earth into the man it cannot defile him because it enters not into his heart in other words that food doesn't become a part of his human spirit or soul right now for us we know if we're born again the sin is no longer in the soul i thought i would get a happy amen after that one amen hallelujah hallelujah amen if you're born again there's no there's no more sin in your soul for the seed of god remains and the seed of god cannot sin amen hallelujah so where's the defilement come the human mind the heart or the emotions right usually that's when people get usually that's when you see people as human sides when they get emotional about something usually angry angry bitter right that's when you see they get emotional you see their face get red kind of like lena shirts red that kind of red right there i've had a couple people get mad at me before like that i say forgive me i'm sorry my fault forgive me i didn't mean to do that i'll do better next time right so jesus tells him the food doesn't make you sinful it's already your sinful nature that's inside of you verse 20. he said that which cometh out of the man that defiles a man for from within out of the heart of men precede evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness and evil eye blasphemy pride and foolishness all these evil things come from within man and defile the man so what do we get defiled from oh satan you defiled me no no he might have set a trap for you but it was your own sin that defiled you amen your own thoughts right jesus said your own thoughts because thoughts become the action so it's the own thoughts of of the less of the less of the flesh the less of the eyes the pride of life and so your own thoughts about those that eventually you act upon and that defiles a man or woman ah so now we know where the pride comes from now we know why we get exalted with pride because of our own selves it's because of our own human spirit right our own human mind that has a sinful part to it right needs transformed daily we must always die out to our our thinking we must cast out anything that exalts itself against the mind of god and then also sin that dwells in our members sin that lives inside of our flesh so that kind of concludes where jesus said about that about the word humble and the church said now uh i'm gonna i'm gonna skip that and uh i told you wednesday night i wanted to get to this god humbling israel in the wilderness is a type of sanctification okay so deuteronomy 8 is what i'm going to be reading out of uh deuteronomy is moses's last commission to israel before his death and he's reminding them the way of humility and testing that they've come so far they're right on the border of taking the promised land they've gone come so far out of egypt through the wilderness and they're right on the border and before he dies he's reminding them this is how you got here he says i command you these things to live by to multiply to go in the land verse 2 thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these 40 years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou would us keep his commandments or no so for 40 years god led them to all these different situations these obstacles and it would prove whether they'd be humble or not church everything in your life everything that comes is to prove you whether you'll be humble or prideful that's what god says here everything is just a test glory are you going to humble yourself when you're sick or exalt yourself when you're sick that's a test when there's a family trouble are you gonna humble yourself in the family trouble are you gonna exalt yourself in the family trouble when there's a test about money are you gonna humble yourself when it comes to the money are you gonna be prideful about the money when there's a test about uh sexual temptation you're gonna humble yourself in that or you're gonna make yourself prideful in that see every every situation it ultimately is a test of pride versus humility like i showed you what was brother brahms major fails with well it looks like the main thing he battled was pride as a real christian you look at peter's life what's the main thing you battled after got the holy ghost pride pride so in every situation we've got to look and see well which one is this is it lust of the flesh lust of the eyes or the pride of life because that's what god was showing with israel and how many know you're on a spiritual journey coming out of egypt praise god come out of egypt amen there you go i'm i'm going through sanctification and i'm possessing the land amen and then when i get in the land i got some real enemies to drive out amen seven of them hallelujah seven nations greater mightier than that once you get the holy ghost then it's time for a real battle praise god still have to be humble in the promised land but god specifically says this wilderness journey was to humble you and i'm going to know what's in your heart by all these situations that i allow i bring in it's going to show me what's in your heart whether you're going to keep my commands or not see church every situation is a test are you going to keep the word or you're going to disobey the word verse 3 and he humbled thee and suffer thee to hunger now look god allowed them to get hungry church god allows our finances to go down the church said god allows you to get sick and the church said god allowed them to get hungry god knew they were hungry but this this pain this suffering was going to show them and god what was in their heart your trials when they come they'll show you what's in your heart when you go and come to a trial oh i didn't know that was in me i didn't know i could talk like that anymore the church said well you don't have to say man if you don't want to i better stop doing that now i've done nothing i've done that enough times this service just getting you know habits of preaching you know just want the lord to speak so he suffered them to be hungry to humble them so they must be too prideful church think about it how could they be prideful when they they're not the ones that held back the water they're not the ones that was showering them you know all the egyptians were showering them with you know earrings and gold as they left they're just getting oh bye i put that in my pocket thank you thank you thank you and they're prideful like it's something they did it was the lamb that brought them out amen it was god's judgment upon egypt that brought them out the pillar of fire brought them out it wasn't them what they had to be prideful about but that's how human nature is maybe that's why god doesn't do as many miracles sometimes as we wish and hope for and pray for we might take some of the credit right all these miracles that's what we saw was getting right god would not do that miracle until all the fearful and all the prideful left the church right why did god do this that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god in other words you get hungry to realize food isn't my food isn't really what satisfies me it's god that satisfies me glory all right you you your finances go down a little bit uh so that you can realize wow god's a provider of my finances it's not why i should not have done no you might have made some mistakes financially we've all made mistakes financially right but really in other words i'm not trusting in my my investments right i'm not trusting in my human ability now i'll be led by the holy spirit right i'm going to be led by the holy spirit but i'm not trusting in my financial ability i'm trusting in jehovah amen amen so you can look at this in every situation of our lives god kept their clothes from waxing not old and kept their feet from life god can keep a foot from swelling 40 years i mean what can you do for us praise god god see god allows trials to teach you you don't live by your own strength you live by god's strength that's all god wanted was just a people that he could have fellowship with and that would depend on him satan would not depend on him that's why he became the enemy of god he wouldn't trust god and depend on god well if god's placed me here i want to stay right here until god changes it god's portion to him in life wasn't enough satan didn't wanted more than what god had gave him and that's why the bible says godliness with contentment is a great gain amen satan wasn't content where god had placed him so we we see where god has placed us and we stay there until god moves us on we're content with where god has placed us verse 5 thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chastened his son so the lord god chasing me in other words church you got to picture yourself i'm a child of god i picture yourself i'm a little baby in the kingdom of god not a little baby i'm a little toddler in the kingdom of god and i need correction all the time if just left to myself i'm going to wander away from god and the church yeah church amen god is my father i'm a child and just like you have to correct a child constantly you've got to correct god has to correct us constantly therefore keep the commandments to walk in his ways and fear see they understood we're children and god is the father god is trying to teach them that now here's a warning god said once you get in the land you're going to be he said you're going to eat and be full your tummies are going to be full and then you'll bless the lord and then in verse 11 but beware you forget not the lord thy god where do you often forget god when everything's going good and easy you let up on your prayer your bible reading give me your tithes and offerings or you let up on something when everything's going good and easy that's when you tend to let up on god not keeping his commandments so see after scenes of prosperity human nature is just like oh just take it easy and all these you know i've heard a man say it before it's so true the more possessions you have the more time you got to spend taking care of them right the more things you got the more time you got to spend on them unless you can pay somebody you have enough money to pay somebody take care of all your things that you got but that's not most of us who's got an extra you know 60 70 000 to pay like a assistant yeah i don't know anybody's got that extra kind of money he says les when you eat and then you're full you built goodly houses and dwell they're in your herds and your flocks multiply my i'm getting bigger and bigger i'm getting greater and greater my silver and gold's multiplied everything's multiplied your heart is lifted up and you forget about god who brought you out of egypt in other words church never forget where you came from amen never forget where god reached out his mighty hand and lifted you up on the mirror clay don't forget and be grateful all the days of your life and recognize god's multiply me god's bless me so i can be a blessing to others praise god now god wants me to be like him and bless other people like he does see but if we're not careful that's why i shared with you those three churches i know three message churches that build a brand new church and awful things happen to them i know four that have done it one hasn't fallen three had fallen one was in sex abuse uh one was then they left the message and what was the other one oh uh the other one was uh uh they uh kind of made a creed out of music you know they kind of made their own creed out of music and they started criticizing others and they had a mass exodus out of their church because they made a denomination they basically made a message denomination basically what they did and now look in the old testament god warned them you're going to forget about me and you know what peter warned us of the same thing he says if you do the statue of perfect man if you let those anointings in your life he said you'll always be fruitful in the knowledge of god amen but if you lack those anointings if you if you let those holy ghost anointings leave your life and your mind the bible says you'll be blind you can't seem far off and you'll forget that god already washed away all your old sins in other words satan will come back and say you remember when you did this you remember when you did that and you'll feel bad about it because you've forgotten that all these anointings you forgot the anointing of god you forgot about him you thought you could do it by yourself but with god's anointing you'll always remember where you come from and where you're going amen hallelujah praise god when god's anointing is on you strongly you're humble and you always remember where you come from and you always realize you're nothing because it's not my strength it's not my anointing it's his anointing i'm only here because of jesus christ amen amen and his anointing so how do you do that brother you're diligent you diligently repent you diligently obey the promises of god if you do if you do these things right those i'm thinking those middle wings those action wings if you do these things you'll never fall so pride makes you forget about christ's blood and also his anointing of his traits pride makes you forget oh i already did repent of that i already did all right oh i already made that right see and look in deuteronomy back to deuteronomy 8. now back to the old testament if you're if someone's anointed with pride they only care about right now but humility sees future rewards and benefits for obeying the word of god so moses rehearses all that god did for them god led them through great and terrible wilderness has god ever led you through a trial you said i don't know how i'm going to get through this but god led you through it glory ever been bitten by a fiery serpent god led them through that ever been surrounded by scorpions or drought there's no rain no water god brought god brought you through the trial or god brought water out of iraq amen god brought a blessing when there seemed like there was no blessing god brought a special blessing just for you praise god he fed you with manna that your fathers knew not that he might humble you that he might prove thee to do the good at the latter end see all your failures church all your failures are going to work to your good at the end all the favors of israel worked out for the good of joshua and caleb and everybody 19 and younger amen all those they could learn church i'm still learning from my failures today right we're still we still learn from that god is only humbling brother jesse when he lets him fall god's only humbling brother amen when god lets him fall it's a it's a time of humility and then repentance and then renewal that's your latter end glory that you'll be ready for the latter rain amen i think if we live to see it amen see god did not want this god didn't want you to say my power and might has got me this wealth or this knowledge oh it's because i'm so powerful i'm so great that's where i am today that's not what god wants god wants humility but he says remember the lord your god it is he that gives thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he swears and it shall be if you at all forget the lord your god and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i testify you this day ye shall surely perish as a nation which the lord destroyed before your face so shall ye perish because you would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord your god so it comes down to humility and obeying the word of god all right i'm about ready where i want to uh keep it going just for a few more minutes let's look at uh we'll try to close here in the next 30 minutes okay try to do 30 minutes here the disciples battle with pride there's a few things i haven't said here uh oh yeah i didn't do there's actually 14 complaints of israel in the wilderness so maybe i'll preach those wednesday i really want to get to this thought remember god cut him off after 10 complaints god said i'm done this whoever's 20 and older i'm done with them i'm going with the young generation and joshua and caleb those older ones that do better he said i'll give you 10 complaints but after that i'm done now of course there's no number in the new testament right we talk about last sunday in the new testament it's a reprobate mind when god knows when that person will no longer repent and they hate god and they they don't don't obey god's word they don't want to retain god's word then god gives them over to reprobate mind right it's not like a certain number thank god church how many got a sound mind today can we say praise the lord praise the lord for a sound mind because the world has reprobate minds disapproved god doesn't god won't even intervene he won't even intervene in their thoughts anymore now mark 9 33-34 and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked him what was it you disputed among yourselves by the way so when you guys were walking here what were you disputing and arguing about but they held their peace huh so that the disciples wanted to argue while jesus wasn't around about who's the greatest but one's in the presence of jesus they didn't want to argue about who was the greatest they didn't want to talk about not church doesn't sound like us we'll sin and then we'll come to church like i don't want to talk i don't want to talk about my sins right in other words we're ashamed of our sins now that's a good thing that's a good thing they wouldn't they didn't want to argue the presence of jesus right it's good because they knew it was wrong they were convicted by their own consciences for by the way oh now we know what they're arguing about they are disputed among themselves who should be the greatest i don't know i just can't imagine arguing with banging amen who's the greatest hero brothers come on there's no way i'm greater can you imagine i just can't imagine that happening but there's a there's a certain way the devil has done it where he's changed it and i'm going to show that to you here it's my opinion my opinion now notice this silence shows again they're not born again now it's a good thing they were silent but i guess if you look at another way maybe they should have repented and said jesus we're sorry we're arguing about who was the greatest but instead they didn't want to talk about it to me church it's like a lot of the silence coming out of jeffersonville and other preachers who don't have time to answer simple questions yet the bible says they're supposed to answer questions right now look they like the financial benefits of the commission but they don't like the laboring in the word aspect of the commission i like some of the parts of the job but not all the parts of the job god doesn't ask you to like part of the job god asks you to like all the part of the job if he's called let me say if he's called you the job he's called you to the whole job amen not half he's if he's called you he's equipped you he'll strength he'll give you grace to do the whole job amen mark 9 and he sat down so right after this he sits down calls the 12. does it look familiar sound familiar if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all so church we all want to we all i'll say like this we all want to receive a full reward from jesus no i'm sure nobody here wants to lose any of their reward i'm sure no one here wants to disappoint jesus so jesus says if you don't want to disappoint me make yourself last of all make yourself the servant of all and what does he do to these big name preachers he takes a child and sets him in the midst oh my even took him up in his arms even hug this little child whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me so look they're arguing amongst himself who's the greater one who's the greater one jesus says which one of you will come get a child and just minister to a child dory come here come here victory come sit on my lap victoria go see my left hand the preacher is like i i'm the greater preacher i'm the greatest preacher and jesus said who's the one that'll take the child right here say honey can i teach you about jesus today hallelujah what questions you have about jesus see jesus just takes a little child and takes him up in his arms right takes him up in his arms he's a preacher arguing about who's greater he said the one who's great cares about every single soul they care about the least of them we'd say the least no no she's not least but as far as like she's a child she can't do that much she can't work her job right she can't she can't drive a car right they're arguing about who's greater jesus like this is what you should do you should we should look at people that you can help who can humble themselves and meet the needs of a little one do you do you need to order some chipotle today let's get round bob thank you honey yeah thank you they're stuffing out their shirts sin it's me no he gave me the keys to the kingdom and no no i did this and i cast out this many devils and jesus is just holding a little child whoever receives one of these receives me and then not only do you receive me you receive him that set me amen the heavenly father the eternal spirit amen the holy ghost amen they're worried about all these adults and yet they're neglecting just the simple children in the services the simple people that uh they need love too they need attention too yeah that's what i love about brother amen and you know hua and austin and everybody naomi everybody they all play with the kids i love that when they play with the kids i love that humbling themselves right i mean you all do it y'all do it to some degree but i love that because they're not so they're not rallying around the preachers and when we have guest preachers you know they're not yeah you want to say hi to them but you're still able to go look and minister to other people's needs we'd say the least esteem well what can a child do a child can't preach a child can't play piano a child can't song lead but yet jesus is interested in ministering to the children because that's the example he gives with humility that's why brother brahma said he said i actually feel more love if you love my children rather than loving me he said i'd rather have you give a gift to my children than me he says and then i feel more loved because that child came out of him right a child just the least esteemed person just humble you know nobody read say well that's really important right you never see a child elected to be president of the united states although it might be a good choice at this time i got a couple good examples i i could i could nominate a few good people i know a couple good children that could do that remember uh james and john's mother came to jesus and said jesus said what do you want what wilt thou grant that my two sons sent one in the right hand one the left and jesus said can you drink this baptism can you drink of this cup they said yes he said surely you will he said but it it's not mine to give who sits on my right hand and left but given to them for whom it's prepared of my father and the ten the other ten that included judas two judas is scared heard that and they removed indignation against the two brethren no i deserve to sit by jesus i did more i did it and they got angry amongst themselves at church you would think that they would remember i was a fisherman before jesus called me i i was a i was a tax collector i couldn't cast out devils i couldn't walk on water i could do nothing before jesus came i'm nothing but they'd forgotten how nothing they were they thought they were something like the power they had was theirs like somehow hidden inside of them and now they just bring out this power no jesus gave them the power remember this verse i love this verse only by pride comes contention in other words whenever there's strife and arguments and fusses there's only one reason it comes pride look what jesus said i'm sorry look what brother brahm said about this the disciples even walking with jesus they didn't have no oneness they didn't have any unity no they argued who's going to be the bishop after this church that's where you see a lot of churches that's when their pride rises up once an old pastor gets old and he's going off the scene all these guys are lining up who's going to be the next pastor who's going to get all that money that's what they think that's what they think it is most of them it's not about service it's about glory and power who's going to be bishop who's the greatest among us they couldn't even believe jesus they couldn't understand him thou speakest and riddles tell us plainly what you mean there was no unity between jesus and the disciples or just disciples of jesus and disciples among one another until the holy ghost fell amen hallelujah but it says then came pentecost god made them one again amen oh my then they put then they had oneness with god god was in them acts if you want to put it down in acts 4 verse 32 the bible said they were one heart one soul and one mind amen why they've been restored back to the original again hallelujah amen the only thing that they had left to be disposed of was an old city or they lived in there an old body called a city or temple that they lived here and that had to rot because it was to die and corrupt but in spirit and life and in purpose and envision everything they were one with god amen see that's how church we know we're united together because we all have one heart one mind and one soul we all want the same thing we all want to see people saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and then find your position in the body of christ amen amen that's what i want for every person now a lot of churches you'd be surprised they want a bigger building right that's really what they want that's the main thing to get we'll see if some people want that but other people just want to see soul save well then now we don't have the same vision that's why people there's a lot of division in churches too right that's just one example there could be many examples right there could be all kinds of examples popularity or other things tv shows and podcasts and you know youtube channels you know anything can divide a church but see we have one heart one soul one mind that's what the holy ghost does brings real unity so your unity comes by humility hallelujah amen that's the only way we're united is by humility pride will always separate us you can stop the livestream everybody take a deep breath here
