[51:26] more than all the dwellings of
[51:30] Jacob glorious things are spoken of thee
[51:34] Oh city of God
[51:36] sayah I will make mention of Rahab and
[51:39] Babylon to them that know me behold

[52:27] instrument shall be there all my Springs
[52:29] are amen thank you brother appreciate
[52:32] that right says a song or song for the
[52:34] sons of Kora to the chief musician upon
[52:39] mahatha lean M of hean the E
[52:45] ezrahite praise God so this was a song
[52:48] specifically for the sons of Kora
[52:51] remember the sons of Kora they were not
[52:54] uh the keepers of uh they they were not
[52:56] the the high priests right they were not
[52:57] the house of Levi we'd say that were
[53:00] actual priests but they just carried all
[53:02] the burdens They Carried all the pieces
[53:04] of furniture and so this song was for
[53:07] them they were to sing and they were to
[53:09] remember in verse two and I hope we can
[53:11] let's just read that again verse two
[53:12] let's remember this the Lord loveth the
[53:14] gates of Zion more than all the
[53:17] dwellings of Jacob so of all the land of
[53:20] Israel God loved it but God loved more
[53:23] the gates of Zion meaning the gates that
[53:25] come into His City for worship let's bow
[53:28] our heads if you have he on your heart
[53:29] just make it known to
[53:31] god let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[53:34] you for tonight we thank you for your
[53:35] love and your mercy your compassion Lord
[53:37] God we just pray Lord you speak to us
[53:39] here tonight Lord we just want to do
[53:40] what you would do say what you would say
[53:42] Lord let us come in the power of the
[53:44] Resurrection The Power of the spoken
[53:46] word Lord preaching Lord God that will
[53:48] save and heal Lord and strengthen Lord
[53:50] God and perfect the Bride of Jesus
[53:53] Christ I have no ability of my own I'm
[53:55] only trusting in the Holy Spirit here
[53:57] tonight Lord take my mind away Lord and
[53:59] fill with your mind and your thoughts
[54:01] dear God thank you for the anointing of
[54:03] the holy spirit thank you for these
[54:05] inspired scriptures we can read to know
[54:07] your mind we thank you for your grace in
[54:09] Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen
[54:12] amen God bless you being seated praise
[54:15] God so I'd like to look at this the lord
[54:17] loves the house of God he loves his own
[54:19] house amen so let's look at this here I
[54:22] think it'll be important to you um it
[54:25] keeps getting more important to be in
[54:26] the house of the Lord as time goes on
[54:29] recently I preached that message on
[54:31] scarcely saved scarcely lost remember
[54:33] the Bible said that First Peter chapter
[54:35] 4 that those in the house of God right
[54:39] will be saved but what about those who
[54:40] don't obey the truth and are outside of
[54:42] the house of God judgment must begin at
[54:45] the house of God Amen so we think it's
[54:48] uh critical in this hour to be in the
[54:50] house of the Lord I want to lay down
[54:52] some scriptures I think we'll start with
[54:53] the numerous scriptures here and then
[54:55] we'll work our way uh to some quotations
[54:58] brother brandom uh I think you'd be
[55:00] blessed to hear these things here
[55:02] tonight by God's
[55:04] grace so let's if we can let's get our
[55:06] Bibles ready um let's go to Psalm 78 now
[55:10] we start at 87 let's go to Psalms 78
[55:15] now verse 67 Psalms
[55:24] 7867 we're digging real deep in the
[55:26] Bible here to find these thank God for
[55:28] his Mercy thank God for these golden
[55:29] nuggets 7867 and
[55:33] 68 now look at this here moreover he
[55:36] refused the Tabernacle of Joseph and
[55:38] chose not the tribe of Ephraim but chose
[55:42] the tribe of Judah the Mount
[55:45] Zion which he loved amen what did God
[55:49] love God Lov Mount Zion now physically
[55:52] speaking Mount Zion is right next to
[55:54] mount Mariah praise God it's right next
[55:56] to it Mount Zion is the bigger Mountain
[55:59] physically but as you see in scripture
[56:02] God is talking about uh the place of
[56:04] worship at this point this is where
[56:07] Israel worshiped in the days of of
[56:08] course uh Joshua and then you have the
[56:12] days of David and Solomon and all these
[56:14] days and days of Ezra they reestablish
[56:16] worship here the days of Jesus they
[56:19] worship there they had the Temple of
[56:20] Herod Herod built this beautiful Temple
[56:22] we preached on a few months ago the
[56:24] middle wall partition and so forth but
[56:27] this was God's place where he dwelt amen
[56:30] and God chose Judah and Judah means
[56:33] praise amen he chose David of the tribe
[56:36] of Judah as ruler and King he chose a
[56:38] place within the limits of Judah so
[56:40] Israel I'm sorry Jerusalem was in the
[56:42] midst of the the land of Judah praise
[56:44] God so God dwells in the midst of Praise
[56:48] we ought to enjoy a song service because
[56:50] that's what God dwells in amen
[56:52] hallelujah so God physically dwelt in
[56:54] Judah because all that land was given of
[56:57] course to the the tribe of Judah and
[56:59] Caleb was one of those from Judah amen
[57:01] hallelujah amen so he had he had the
[57:03] Bible said he had another spirit in him
[57:05] a man like Cale that wasn't scared to
[57:07] fight the demons he had a different kind
[57:09] of spirit he's a different kind of a
[57:11] person amen that's what we need to be by
[57:13] God's grace not scared of demons not
[57:15] scared of scoffers not scared of sin not
[57:18] scared of those things but to cast it
[57:19] down in Jesus name amen do not fear God
[57:22] doesn't give a spirit of fear if you're
[57:24] scared about something God didn't give
[57:26] you that amen God don't give the spirit
[57:28] of fear God gives the spirit of power
[57:30] love and a sound mind
[57:33] amen so God chose Mount Zion or
[57:35] Jerusalem because many times Zion is
[57:37] called Jerusalem as the place where his
[57:40] worship was to be celebrated amen so you
[57:43] had Mount Zion if you're looking North
[57:45] at at at the Jerusalem you have Mount
[57:48] Zion the biggest mountain and you have
[57:50] Mount Mariah that's where Christ was
[57:51] crucified that's also where the Temple
[57:53] Mount was as well and and then you have
[57:55] the Mount of Olives praise God so Jesus
[57:57] went out the Mount of Olives of course
[57:59] to pray before he was crucified and then
[58:01] he was also uh crucified there on galtha
[58:05] which was a hill not on uh Mariah
[58:08] because remember he was killed outside
[58:09] the gates we went on that recently when
[58:10] we preaching on the red heer he was
[58:12] crucified outside the the Temple Gates
[58:15] he had to be because he was unclean amen
[58:18] so we see that now I want to read uh
[58:20] some more scripture here uh let's go to
[58:23] Psalms 48 1 and 2 Psalms 481
[58:27] and2 try to lay a background here 481
[58:31] and2 great is the Lord and greatly to be
[58:33] praised in the city of our God in the
[58:36] mountain of his Holiness beautiful for
[58:39] situation the joy of the whole earth is
[58:42] Mount Zion on the sides of the north the
[58:46] city of the great king amen this is the
[58:49] joy of the whole earth God calls
[58:52] Jerusalem the joy of all the Earth why
[58:55] because that's where he dwelt amen
[58:58] inside that Temple was of course the
[59:00] holy place and you have the Hol of
[59:02] holies praise God the holiest of holies
[59:05] uh contained the Ark of the Covenant
[59:07] inside of the Ark at the beginning was
[59:09] the rod of Aaron right uh was a table of
[59:13] of the two tables of stone of The
[59:15] Commandments and then a pot of om right
[59:17] pot of om that had Mana in it amen
[59:19] that's what it had the beginning in the
[59:21] days of Moses now by the days of Jesus
[59:24] it had nothing in it from what I've read
[59:25] through history it was just a box it
[59:27] just a they had I'm sorry they don't
[59:29] have the Arc of the Covenant they was
[59:30] just an empty room in there they had
[59:31] nothing in there so it was just an empty
[59:34] place and why was that because God the
[59:37] real Ark was walking around outside amen
[59:39] he was out in Solomon's courts teaching
[59:41] the people praise God Amen God they
[59:44] didn't let God in his own Temple my
[59:46] that's how much they shut him out that's
[59:47] what they do today the Luke the lukewarm
[59:50] lyan church right he's knocking on the
[59:52] door trying to get in but they won't let
[59:53] him in they kicked him out because they
[59:55] don't want the gospel amen they don't
[59:57] want the true word of God same thing
[59:59] today it repeats my What a Sad thing but
[1:00:02] this is a beautiful situation to have
[1:00:04] God dwelling on the mountain God
[1:00:06] dwelling with the people remember God
[1:00:08] told Moses I will meet you there I will
[1:00:11] speak to you Above The Mercy Seat praise
[1:00:14] God Amen and now we today we often hear
[1:00:18] this that that your heart is like the
[1:00:19] ark today and that's a good type because
[1:00:22] the Bible said the holy spirit will
[1:00:24] write the word upon your heart and the
[1:00:26] Word was placed in the ark right of the
[1:00:29] Covenant the word that the law the
[1:00:31] Commandments given to Moses was written
[1:00:34] and and placed inside of the Ark so and
[1:00:37] God dwells by the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:39] Ghost in the soul of the believer praise
[1:00:41] God so with the picture of the Ark of
[1:00:43] the Covenant we have a picture of the
[1:00:46] soul of the believer amen where God
[1:00:48] writes his word there where God lives
[1:00:50] there and God speaks to us amen he
[1:00:53] speaks to us from the Soul because
[1:00:55] that's the where his spirit is and his
[1:00:57] Spirit of course speaks to us so that's
[1:00:59] where God dwells
[1:01:01] amen now this is also called The Beloved
[1:01:04] City Revelation 20:9 so God loves this
[1:01:08] city remember this is the type of God's
[1:01:10] Dwelling Place Revelation
[1:01:14] 20:9 let's read that by God's grace so
[1:01:16] you're familiar Revelation 20
[1:01:20] ver9 I know I'm just kind of going slow
[1:01:22] with these Lamey scriptures but I
[1:01:24] believe they're important Revelation
[1:01:25] 20:9 and they went up upon the breath of
[1:01:28] the earth and compassed the camp of the
[1:01:30] Saints about and the Beloved City and
[1:01:33] fire came down from God out of heaven
[1:01:34] and devoured them now of course this is
[1:01:37] God and may God at the end of the
[1:01:39] Thousand Years but this is when Satan
[1:01:41] gathers all the nations now remember we
[1:01:43] preached on that in the Millennium we
[1:01:44] don't know exactly who they are we don't
[1:01:46] know if they'll be raised up people who
[1:01:47] never heard the message or somehow
[1:01:49] people made it through the fires of
[1:01:50] Armageddon we're not quite sure who it
[1:01:52] is we're not exactly told but one
[1:01:54] thing's for sure they will come against
[1:01:56] God's people and they will be
[1:01:58] burned so we don't want to be the
[1:02:00] Nations outside of the city we want to
[1:02:02] dwell with Christ right in the city amen
[1:02:05] hallelujah he's got to come in the
[1:02:06] Millennium and anoint that Temple again
[1:02:09] amen the the Millennium Temple and we
[1:02:11] must be there with him amen so the Bible
[1:02:14] calls it a beloved
[1:02:16] City now I'm going to go back here let's
[1:02:18] go back to uh Psalms 87 here verse
[1:02:23] two
[1:02:27] now I want to go back here because I I
[1:02:28] left off a quotation I want to read this
[1:02:30] quotation by God's
[1:02:33] grace I want you to see what God Said
[1:02:36] again about the gates 87 verse1 his
[1:02:39] foundation is the holy mountains the
[1:02:41] Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than
[1:02:44] all the dwellings of Jacob
[1:02:49] amen now I want to read this here this
[1:02:52] illustration of gates deals with the
[1:02:55] gates that lead into the Temple of
[1:02:57] worship amen so let's read about that
[1:03:00] this is from a commentary I found here
[1:03:02] and I think you'll like it by God's
[1:03:03] grace I want you to get the picture now
[1:03:05] how many knows how many times how many
[1:03:06] times did God say every male must be
[1:03:08] appear before me how many knows in the
[1:03:10] Old Testament three times three times
[1:03:14] there were seven feasts but they had to
[1:03:15] appear three times and if they appeared
[1:03:18] three times and brought their tithes and
[1:03:19] offerings God would receive them if they
[1:03:22] appeared those three times they would
[1:03:23] actually stay for all seven feasts if
[1:03:26] you know the the history behind that
[1:03:28] they'd actually have to stay there and
[1:03:29] they could attend all seven feasts but
[1:03:31] God said three times a year remember it
[1:03:34] was in the spring uh twice in the spring
[1:03:36] and then once in the fall they had these
[1:03:37] feasts and these three feasts had little
[1:03:39] Feast with inside of them but God said
[1:03:41] three times a year you'll come and be
[1:03:44] gathered praise God for the Passover the
[1:03:46] Feast of Weeks and then for the Feast of
[1:03:48] trumpets amen glory you must gather for
[1:03:51] those and they're of course all close
[1:03:52] together except for the Beast and Feast
[1:03:54] of Tabernacles is you know in the
[1:03:56] seventh month the all the other feasts
[1:03:58] were in the first month and the third
[1:03:59] month so I want you to get this picture
[1:04:01] here the gates of a city were the places
[1:04:04] of concourse where business transacted
[1:04:07] where courts were
[1:04:09] held this illusion seems to be of the
[1:04:12] thronging multitudes pressing into the
[1:04:14] city for public worship the numbers that
[1:04:17] gathered together at the great feasts
[1:04:19] and festivals of the nation and the
[1:04:21] meaning is that God looked with more
[1:04:23] pleasure on such multitudes as they
[1:04:26] throng the gates pressing in the city
[1:04:29] that they might worship him than any
[1:04:31] other scene in all Israel amen don't you
[1:04:34] like that Hallelujah so God loved this
[1:04:38] God loved the gates of Zion God love the
[1:04:40] gates that led into the city of of David
[1:04:43] we' say the place of worship God Loved
[1:04:45] These Gates more than any other Gates
[1:04:47] can you imagine millions of people let's
[1:04:49] say hundreds of thousands of people
[1:04:50] flooding into the gates for Passover
[1:04:52] Amen to offer their lambs to worship God
[1:04:55] to sing the songs to feel that they were
[1:04:58] forgiven amen hallelujah or uh once a
[1:05:02] year on the day of atonement right in
[1:05:04] the seventh month the 10th day of the
[1:05:05] seventh month all of Israel could stand
[1:05:07] there when the Two Goats were killed the
[1:05:10] goat for sacrifice and the scapegoat
[1:05:12] when that scape of course that first
[1:05:14] goat was killed for Aaron and all the
[1:05:16] people and Anointed The Tabernacle and
[1:05:18] so forth but that second goat that
[1:05:20] second goat was called the scapegoat and
[1:05:23] that goat would be LED out of the city
[1:05:25] and they would be led so far away and
[1:05:27] all of Israel's sins was upon that goat
[1:05:30] amen Aon laid his hands and Aaron made
[1:05:33] the transfer of all his sins and all
[1:05:35] Israel all the sins were transferred to
[1:05:37] the scapegoat and a strong man led the
[1:05:40] goat away and they led him out of the
[1:05:42] city they leted him out of the uh out of
[1:05:45] the the the city uh limits and so forth
[1:05:48] and they led him to a cliff and they
[1:05:49] push him over the cliff and that
[1:05:51] represented that God took your C sins
[1:05:54] away as far as the East is from the West
[1:05:56] praise God and that your sin would die
[1:05:59] how many thankful that your sin's dead
[1:06:00] tonight amen and church can you imagine
[1:06:03] the feeling of the people when they were
[1:06:05] sincere that when they're just going
[1:06:07] through the motions okay can we get this
[1:06:08] over the goats got to leave come on can
[1:06:10] we Hur up and end end the service and
[1:06:13] they're all trying to get done but the
[1:06:14] people who really believed it and loved
[1:06:16] God as soon as the goat was the away
[1:06:18] they could rejoice and say my sins are
[1:06:21] gone amen you ask me why I'm happy let

[1:07:59] amen because it was his place of worship
[1:08:02] where his name was praised where he is
[1:08:05] exalted on high
[1:08:07] amen I'm not going to go over this
[1:08:09] because I already went over this but God
[1:08:11] loved Zion because it's our future home
[1:08:14] as well so God physically loved
[1:08:16] Jerusalem because that's where the
[1:08:18] future home is going to come down that's
[1:08:20] that's his uh that's his mansion uh
[1:08:24] that's his real estate that's his

[1:08:32] Holy Land praise God and that's also
[1:08:34] called of course the New Jerusalem
[1:08:36] praise the
[1:08:37] Lord now let's go to Deuteronomy 125 if
[1:08:41] we can Deuteronomy
[1:08:49] 125 this is a scripture I want to
[1:08:52] read I never preached this and I wanted
[1:08:55] to Austin and Benjamin I don't know if
[1:08:56] they've heard this and some of the new
[1:08:58] Saints uh not sure any other new ones
[1:09:00] are here tonight but uh I want them to
[1:09:02] hear this by God's grace brother BR
[1:09:03] preached a message called God's one
[1:09:06] provided place of worship how many know
[1:09:08] that message I think the first time I
[1:09:10] preached it was in' 65 if I'm not
[1:09:11] mistaken maybe 64 I know he preached it
[1:09:13] right or right before he preached the
[1:09:14] marriage and
[1:09:15] divorce now can somebody read that for
[1:09:17] me Deuteronomy 12 uh it's five and six
[1:09:20] can somebody read that for me for the
[1:09:23] place which the Lord your God has chose
[1:09:24] out of all your tries to put his name
[1:09:26] there even until his habitation shall
[1:09:28] you seek and thou sht come and ye shall
[1:09:32] bring your burnt offerings your
[1:09:34] sacrifices and your TI and he offerings
[1:09:37] of your hand and your vow and your free
[1:09:40] will offerings and first things of yours
[1:09:42] and of your flock amen praise God thank
[1:09:45] you brother so where where are they
[1:09:46] supposed to bring all their offerings to
[1:09:48] the place where God chose to place his
[1:09:51] name praise God now that's old test
[1:09:54] we're not required to go to Jerusalem
[1:09:56] right but God still plac his name
[1:09:59] somewhere that's the whole point of
[1:10:00] brother Ram's sermon God said I I'm only
[1:10:03] going to take Worship in one
[1:10:06] spot and you have to come to that spot
[1:10:08] that's why God required the men to come
[1:10:10] the men had to come because they're
[1:10:11] going to answer they're the leaders
[1:10:13] right they're the heads and they're
[1:10:14] going to answer right so God required
[1:10:17] the men to come but in the New Testament
[1:10:19] let's go to Hebrews 2:12 Hebrews 2:12
[1:10:22] then Malachi Malachi you get John 543
[1:10:25] now Hebrews
[1:10:28] 2:12 in the New Testament now it's not a
[1:10:31] physical
[1:10:32] location but it's Christ
[1:10:35] amen Hebrews
[1:10:41] 2:12 all right I got this here it
[1:10:44] is saying I will declare thy name unto
[1:10:48] my brethren in the midst of the church
[1:10:50] will I sing praise unto thee amen now
[1:10:53] this is a scripture David wrote but here
[1:10:56] Paul is quoting it in the New Testament
[1:10:59] that who fulfilled it who fulfilled it
[1:11:00] Church Christ Christ did this Christ
[1:11:04] declared God's name unto the Brethren
[1:11:08] and in the midst of the church he's
[1:11:09] saying praise amen so Christ was in the
[1:11:12] church amen hallelujah and see he
[1:11:15] declared the name of God now Mali read
[1:11:18] John 543 got
[1:11:22] it you receive back if another shall
[1:11:27] come in his own name will
[1:11:29] receive amen praise God he said I'm come
[1:11:33] in my father's name right I come in my
[1:11:35] father's name so Jesus came in God's
[1:11:38] name so brother said where does he place
[1:11:40] his name B said he did not place his
[1:11:42] name in Braham Tabernacle Glory he did
[1:11:45] not place his name in Jerusalem anymore
[1:11:47] he doesn't place his name in any
[1:11:49] denomination thank God for that amen he
[1:11:51] said he plac his name in in Jesus Christ
[1:11:55] amen and so today if the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:58] with us Jesus Christ spirit is with us
[1:12:01] and that's why we're saying that he will
[1:12:03] be glorified here if we are still LED of
[1:12:05] the Holy Ghost amen glory and so we
[1:12:09] would say he placed his name here
[1:12:11] because his people are here that have
[1:12:13] his Spirit praise God but as soon as his
[1:12:15] people leave that have a spirit that
[1:12:18] he's not here anymore right his name's
[1:12:20] not here anymore so it's not so so much
[1:12:23] the pro
[1:12:24] as is the people on the property amen or
[1:12:26] The God in the people on the property
[1:12:29] Hallelujah that's what it's really about
[1:12:31] amen God's name is in Christ and we must
[1:12:34] be baptized into Christ and then we bear
[1:12:36] forth the name of Jesus Christ
[1:12:40] Hallelujah
[1:12:42] wonderful now I want to uh go to Psalms
[1:12:49] 37 because we preach on it already how
[1:12:51] judgment begins in the house of God
[1:12:53] here's the reason people don't like
[1:12:55] coming to church because they know
[1:12:56] they're going to be told they're wrong
[1:12:58] right that's why a lot of people hang
[1:12:59] out of church they know they're wrong
[1:13:00] they know they're living wrong and they
[1:13:02] don't want to be judged right but look
[1:13:04] what God Said judgment must be the house
[1:13:06] of God but in Psalms
[1:13:09] 37 uh it's going to be verses 27-
[1:13:12] 31 37 27- 31 let's look what the
[1:13:16] scripture says depart from Evil and do
[1:13:19] good and dwell forever more for the Lord
[1:13:21] loveth what what does God love
[1:13:24] judgment God loves to tell you right and
[1:13:27] wrong praise
[1:13:29] God we don't like it so much especially
[1:13:31] when we're wrong but God loves it and
[1:13:34] this is the house of judgment judgment
[1:13:37] begins where at the house of God so God
[1:13:40] has to love this house because this is
[1:13:42] where his judgment's going forth he has
[1:13:45] to and forsaketh not of saints he loves
[1:13:48] judgment and forsakes not his Saints AR
[1:13:50] you glad amen they are preserved forever
[1:13:53] but the the seed of the wicked shall be
[1:13:54] cut off the righteous shall inherit the
[1:13:55] land and dwell therein forever the mouth
[1:13:57] of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his
[1:13:59] tongue tth of judgment see when you
[1:14:03] really love God and you go to church you
[1:14:04] talk about what was said at church
[1:14:07] because it was God's judgment right and
[1:14:09] the Bible said his tongue talketh of
[1:14:11] judgment God loves judgment and God
[1:14:14] loves his word so when you really love
[1:14:16] God you talk about what was preached you
[1:14:19] talk about the Judgment that came during
[1:14:21] the word of God during the preaching of
[1:14:23] the word
[1:14:24] look at verse 31 the law of his God is
[1:14:26] in his heart none of his steps shall
[1:14:29] slide
[1:14:30] Hallelujah so see when you talk about
[1:14:32] judgments God is this right is that
[1:14:34] wrong and I I'll say like this some
[1:14:37] people you know hammer on this you know
[1:14:38] Christianity is not a do and don't
[1:14:40] religion now I understand that I
[1:14:42] understand what they're saying it's not
[1:14:44] like a to-do list I understand that but
[1:14:46] at the same time God loves right and
[1:14:48] wrong God loves to tell you right and
[1:14:50] wrong are you with me church he loves
[1:14:52] judgment he loves loves to tell you to
[1:14:53] do this don't do
[1:14:55] that so understand you know Christianity
[1:14:57] is more than just a to-do list
[1:15:00] Christianity is a a life that's lived
[1:15:03] based upon the Commandments of God Amen
[1:15:06] and it has to have a list of do this and
[1:15:08] don't do that amen amen you can't
[1:15:11] separate to do and not to do because he
[1:15:13] that loves God keeps all the commands of
[1:15:15] God Amen they do the commands of God so
[1:15:18] we got to be careful you when people say
[1:15:19] oh we're not legalist yeah we're not
[1:15:21] legalists because legalists take words
[1:15:24] they they add to the word of God they go
[1:15:26] ex legalism actually means excessive
[1:15:29] adherence to the Bible right or so they
[1:15:32] basically create things that are
[1:15:33] excessive in the word and are not needed
[1:15:35] anymore and that's legalism but strict
[1:15:38] obedience is
[1:15:40] love I'll say it again strict obedience
[1:15:43] to the word of God is love because
[1:15:46] that's what Jesus did Jesus said I
[1:15:49] always do that which please the father
[1:15:52] are you with with me so can you see that
[1:15:55] God loves judgment God loves to judge a
[1:15:57] matter and say this is right this is
[1:15:59] wrong he loves that because he had he's
[1:16:02] the spirit of what truth and he hates
[1:16:04] iniquity he hates sin he separates that
[1:16:07] from himself he cannot be he cannot
[1:16:09] dwell with that he must separate from it
[1:16:11] he loves truth he loves the spirit of
[1:16:13] Truth amen all right now go to Isaiah
[1:16:17] 61 Isaiah 61 you see this all over the
[1:16:19] scripture these are just too beautiful
[1:16:21] to pass up you go to we got to see these
[1:16:23] and God give us time to do it so let's
[1:16:25] do
[1:16:26] it Isaiah 618
[1:16:32] and10
[1:16:36] glory for I the Lord love what judgment
[1:16:41] God loves judgment I hate robbery for
[1:16:44] burnt offering and I'll direct their
[1:16:45] work in truth and I'll make an
[1:16:46] Everlasting Covenant with them and their
[1:16:48] seed should be known among the Gentiles
[1:16:50] and their offspring among the people all
[1:16:52] that see them shall ackowledge them that
[1:16:53] they are the seed which the Lord hath
[1:16:55] blessed amen I will greatly rejoice in
[1:16:58] the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my
[1:17:00] God he ha clothed me with the garments
[1:17:03] of Salvation amen glory he ha covered me
[1:17:07] with a robe of righteous as a bridegroom
[1:17:09] deck deth himself with ornaments and as
[1:17:11] a bride adorned herself with her
[1:17:14] Jewels what's he saying when you really
[1:17:17] love God the word of God clothes you
[1:17:20] because keeping the word of God is the
[1:17:23] righteousness of saints the bride is
[1:17:25] clothed with fine linen and fine linen
[1:17:27] is what the righteousness The Obedience
[1:17:30] of saints
[1:17:32] Hallelujah God loves judgment and when
[1:17:35] the Bible says I rejoice when I keep the
[1:17:37] word because I'm decked out like a bride
[1:17:39] who's ready to be married who doesn't
[1:17:41] like watching a wedding remember we
[1:17:42] talked about who doesn't like to see a
[1:17:43] beautiful bride walk down the aisle who
[1:17:45] don't like to see the Purity on the day
[1:17:46] of wedding amen who don't like to see
[1:17:48] that everybody likes everybody stands
[1:17:49] and they just can't we want to get a
[1:17:51] look at the bride by look at her she's
[1:17:53] all beautiful and pure well how much
[1:17:55] more the Bride of Jesus Christ by the
[1:17:57] blood of Jesus Christ when she keeps the
[1:17:59] word she stands there 100 times pure
[1:18:01] than a natural woman because she's pure
[1:18:03] by the blood the spirit makes her pure
[1:18:05] she's dressed in the righteousness of
[1:18:07] Jesus Christ amen
[1:18:09] amen
[1:18:11] glory go to Psalms
[1:18:16] 84 Psalms 84 we're going to stay in
[1:18:19] Psalms just for a few more minutes here
[1:18:20] by God's grace I don't know if I'll be
[1:18:22] able to finish tonight
[1:18:23] uh maybe Sunday by God's grace and I
[1:18:25] told you I felt led to do a series on
[1:18:27] Holy Ghost baptism so I'm going to Lord
[1:18:28] willing start that on Sunday if God's
[1:18:30] willing Psalms
[1:18:39] 84 this is a scripture you know it's
[1:18:41] quoted quite often verse one how amiable
[1:18:45] that means lovely how lovely are the
[1:18:47] Tabernacles of the Lord of
[1:18:49] hosts so that's the outer Court inner
[1:18:51] Court h of holies my soul longth yet
[1:18:54] even faints for the courts of the of the
[1:18:56] Lord my heart and flesh crith out for
[1:18:58] the Living
[1:19:01] God so that's what our that's how we
[1:19:04] should feel about church this is how I
[1:19:06] feel about church now for me I gotta
[1:19:08] Minister and I gotta make sure my
[1:19:10] heart's ready for service every service
[1:19:12] so that's why I'm desperate for for
[1:19:14] every service right that's why I cry out
[1:19:16] to God God speak to us God deal with us
[1:19:18] God strengthen us God forgive us God
[1:19:20] help us because I know I've got a
[1:19:22] minister there
[1:19:23] but it's different when more than one
[1:19:25] person or many people come with this
[1:19:27] kind of expectation or this kind of a
[1:19:29] hunger because those who come hungry and
[1:19:31] thirsting will be filled praise God it's
[1:19:34] hard to find that but it exists in this
[1:19:35] hour because God never leaves himself
[1:19:37] without a witness
[1:19:40] Hallelujah yay the spare I found in
[1:19:42] house and lay her young even thine
[1:19:44] altars oh lord of hosts my king and my
[1:19:47] God so even the Birds rest in the house
[1:19:49] of God they let them rest there
[1:19:51] Hallelujah less are they that dwell in
[1:19:53] thy house they will be still praising
[1:19:56] thee that means constant praising that
[1:19:58] don't mean stand still like a dead
[1:19:59] statue and not sing and clap and turn
[1:20:01] all around and look all around and jump
[1:20:03] all around and hop all around that means
[1:20:05] they'll be constantly praising thee
[1:20:08] praise God they that dwell in the house
[1:20:10] of God constantly praise the Lord am yes
[1:20:14] sir and they're blessed sometimes we
[1:20:17] wonder where's the blessings well are we
[1:20:18] in the house of God and are we coming to
[1:20:20] God's house like he said crying out of
[1:20:22] the Living God are we coming with the
[1:20:24] right attitude that's what it produces
[1:20:26] it produces a
[1:20:27] blessing now verse six who passing
[1:20:30] through I'm sorry verse five blessed is
[1:20:33] the man whose strength is in thee in
[1:20:34] whose heart are the ways of them amen
[1:20:38] who passing through the valley of baka
[1:20:39] make it a well the rain also fill the
[1:20:42] pools they go from strength to strength
[1:20:45] every one of them in Zion appear before
[1:20:46] God now I remember I preached on this
[1:20:48] years ago I'm just going to go for
[1:20:50] memory people that live far from
[1:20:53] Jerusalem had to travel quite a ways to
[1:20:55] get to Jerusalem in order for the feast
[1:20:58] and they travel you know in Harvest Time
[1:20:59] where there wouldn't be much rain but on
[1:21:01] their travel there they might get a rain
[1:21:03] so they would dig holes they would dig
[1:21:05] like the Bible said here they would dig
[1:21:07] in order to catch some of the water they
[1:21:09] would dig a well and then rain would
[1:21:11] pull their pool fill their pool in other
[1:21:13] words when they're on their way to God's
[1:21:15] house it'd be dry but because they're
[1:21:17] going to God's house God would send them
[1:21:19] rain amen and they just had to dig up
[1:21:22] whole and and they knew if I just keep
[1:21:25] going to church God's going to send a
[1:21:26] rainen in other words God will provide
[1:21:29] if I do my part and obey the word and go
[1:21:32] to God's house God will give me the rest
[1:21:34] amen oh but it's so hard to find that
[1:21:37] these days isn't it people that go that
[1:21:39] kind of attitude I know even though it's
[1:21:41] dry on my way somehow God will meet my
[1:21:44] need if I just go to his house
[1:21:47] amen because they know they have to
[1:21:49] appear before God they know church every
[1:21:51] church service is opportunity to come
[1:21:53] before God and ask for Grace because we
[1:21:55] know we're going to stand before him one
[1:21:57] day but we can stand before him now and
[1:21:59] receive Grace so that when we stand
[1:22:01] before him at the Judgment seat of
[1:22:02] Christ we have nothing to worry about
[1:22:04] because we've already made it right
[1:22:06] right here praise God amen amen we've
[1:22:09] already seen the judge I've already
[1:22:10] heard what the judge said I already know
[1:22:12] his forgiveness for me I already know
[1:22:14] his Mercy for me I know he's living in
[1:22:16] me and I know what he's going to say
[1:22:18] when I meet the judge amen there's no
[1:22:20] doubt because he already told me amen
[1:22:22] amen oh my church hallelujah what a
[1:22:26] desire for a Christian this hour to
[1:22:28] appear before
[1:22:29] God he's our Advocate he's our lawyer
[1:22:31] he's also our judge amen he's our jury
[1:22:34] as well because he's he said these three
[1:22:35] bear witness in heaven the Father the
[1:22:37] word and the Holy
[1:22:39] Ghost each each of those manifestations
[1:22:42] is a witness is that right isn't the
[1:22:45] even isn't the invisible Spirit a
[1:22:46] witness for you doesn't the invisible
[1:22:49] Spirit know all things amen okay how
[1:22:52] about the the word the Bible said these
[1:22:53] three witness or the one witness how
[1:22:55] about the word isn't the written word
[1:22:57] right here a witness for you amen praise
[1:23:00] God that you kept the word you Ser the
[1:23:01] the word and how about the Holy Ghost
[1:23:03] the Holy Ghost inside of you isn't that
[1:23:05] a witness to go before God Amen that you
[1:23:08] kept the word and the Holy Ghost won't
[1:23:10] lie amen hallelujah so these three are
[1:23:13] witnesses they're three manifestations
[1:23:15] of the same God but they all give
[1:23:17] witness to your life amen look at verse
[1:23:21] seven so when they get this rain what do
[1:23:23] they do they get stronger and stronger
[1:23:26] every one of them in his Z appear before
[1:23:27] God so as they would have let's say they
[1:23:29] had a weak a weak travel by uh by by
[1:23:33] horse or by donkey or by walking they
[1:23:35] would get stronger as they got closer to
[1:23:37] God's house that's what I feel too don't
[1:23:39] you praise God as soon as I'm pulling
[1:23:41] the parking lot I'm feeling so much
[1:23:42] better Glory but if you had a hard week
[1:23:46] you feel so far from God just coming to
[1:23:48] God's house you get stronger and
[1:23:51] stronger as you come amen
[1:23:53] amen if you're coming with the right
[1:23:54] attitude that's exactly that's what the
[1:23:56] Bible says now these are Eternal words
[1:23:59] amen not my words God's
[1:24:01] words the Lord God of hosts hear my
[1:24:04] prayer give ear oh god of Jacob say loud
[1:24:06] behold oh God our shield and look upon
[1:24:08] the face of that anointed see look he
[1:24:10] comes to God's house and he's
[1:24:12] anointed is it that's how we should come
[1:24:14] too right come to God's house and get
[1:24:15] anointed how do you get anointed we get
[1:24:17] all the sin off your life confess all
[1:24:20] your sins and then God can anoint you
[1:24:21] God can't anoint a heart that's
[1:24:24] condemned because we have no confidence
[1:24:27] with God if our hearts condemn us so we
[1:24:29] must confess all the sin that's on our
[1:24:31] heart and then he can anoint us praise
[1:24:34] God that's the only way the Bible said
[1:24:37] though they That Walk In the Flesh uh
[1:24:39] I'm sorry the Bible said that when you
[1:24:40] crucify the the lust and the affections
[1:24:43] thereof of the flesh then you walk in
[1:24:45] the spirit that's the only way to know
[1:24:47] you're walk in the spirit I don't care
[1:24:49] if I don't feel one power or one emotion
[1:24:51] for God if I have overcome sin all day
[1:24:55] brother sister I know I'm walking the
[1:24:57] Holy Ghost amen amen as long as I
[1:25:00] confess my sin I don't have to feel
[1:25:02] nothing because God's word said I am
[1:25:04] anointed amen when I confess my sin when
[1:25:07] I say I'm wrong when I ask God to
[1:25:09] forgive me for thinking that thought or
[1:25:10] looking at that or saying that I know
[1:25:12] I'm walk in the spirit because the flesh
[1:25:14] won't lead you to repentance the Holy
[1:25:16] Ghost will lead you to repentance the
[1:25:18] kindness of God leads you to
[1:25:21] repentance
[1:25:24] Hallelujah I want to get to
[1:25:26] verse 10 for a day in thy courts is
[1:25:30] better than a thousand than a thousand
[1:25:33] so one day in church is better than over
[1:25:36] three years outside of church anybody
[1:25:38] say Amen to
[1:25:40] that one day in God's house is better
[1:25:42] than three years anywhere else praise
[1:25:46] God I wonder why I just don't understand
[1:25:48] why people wouldn't want to come to
[1:25:49] God's house then I had rather a be a
[1:25:52] doorkeeper in the house of my God than
[1:25:55] to dwell in the tents of the wicked so
[1:25:57] if your only job was to open the doors
[1:26:01] for people and let them into
[1:26:04] worship that the Bible said that's more
[1:26:06] enjoyable right that's more enjoyable
[1:26:08] than to dwell with sinners in wickedness
[1:26:11] so if you're the one that gets pushed oh
[1:26:13] come on I'm trying to get in come on
[1:26:14] open the doors I need to get in if
[1:26:16] you're the one get no brother BR called
[1:26:18] it a doormat too you rather be a doormat
[1:26:21] in the house of God but the Bible
[1:26:22] actually says a doorkeeper so we'll just
[1:26:24] say it's like the same thing you
[1:26:26] understand it's the people who are the
[1:26:28] furthest away from the worship the very
[1:26:30] lowest of the servants I'd rather be the
[1:26:32] lowest of the servant of God than be a
[1:26:34] wicked sinner amen glory I'd rather be
[1:26:38] in church one day than three years
[1:26:40] anywhere else
[1:26:42] amen the blessings are so much greater
[1:26:45] and this is under the Old Testament this
[1:26:48] is under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:26:50] amen not the blood of Jesus that
[1:26:53] thoroughly wipes away all your sin even
[1:26:56] the conscience of sin it takes away amen
[1:26:59] that awareness remember your conscious
[1:27:00] is your awareness your awareness that
[1:27:02] you've sinned only the holy ghost in the
[1:27:04] New Testament can take away your
[1:27:06] awareness that you're a sinner and now
[1:27:09] you don't think that anymore now you
[1:27:10] know you're a son or daughter of God I'm
[1:27:12] not thinking about my sin I'm not a
[1:27:14] sinner I'm a believer I'm a Christian My
[1:27:17] Flesh sins but I'm not amen glory he
[1:27:21] that's born of God does not commit what
[1:27:24] he don't commit he and she don't commit
[1:27:25] sin because they're born again of the
[1:27:27] seed of God within them amen that's what
[1:27:30] we look at as a Christian yes we look at
[1:27:32] our flesh we say God forgive us we
[1:27:34] confess our wrongs but when it comes
[1:27:36] down to are we gods are we forgiven or
[1:27:38] not we say we cannot sin anymore because
[1:27:41] we got God in the soul we're born again
[1:27:44] amen and that seed cannot sin that life
[1:27:48] that nature that Soul cannot
[1:27:51] sin
[1:27:52] verse 11 for the Lord God is a son in
[1:27:54] the shield the Lord will give Grace and
[1:27:56] Glory no good thing will he withhold
[1:27:58] from them that walk
[1:28:00] uprightly oh lord of hosts blessed is a
[1:28:02] man that trusts in
[1:28:04] thee no good thing will he withhold from
[1:28:07] someone that walks honestly uprightly
[1:28:09] before God he'll give you all the good
[1:28:12] things you need what a promise that is
[1:28:14] my
[1:28:15] goodness look at Psalms 147 let's go to
[1:28:18] Psalms 147 towards the end of the
[1:28:21] book
[1:28:25] Psalms
[1:28:28] 147 this is all old test
[1:28:31] M now I want to read 1 to seven but I
[1:28:33] want to kind of get moving on here um
[1:28:36] we'll start verse
[1:28:38] one Praise You the Lord for it is good
[1:28:41] to sing praise unto our God for it is
[1:28:43] pleasant and it is
[1:28:45] calmly the Lord do build up Jerusalem he
[1:28:48] gathered together the outcast of Israel
[1:28:51] he healed the broken and heart and
[1:28:52] bindeth up their wounds CH what's he
[1:28:55] saying it's a pleasant thing to worship
[1:28:56] God
[1:28:58] Amen the church was a gathering of
[1:29:00] brokenhearted people that are not
[1:29:02] brokenheart anymore now they're healed
[1:29:05] amen amen they used to be outcasts but
[1:29:08] now they're accepted now they're Sons
[1:29:10] and Daughters amen the world made them
[1:29:13] Outcast but God makes us family amen
[1:29:16] that's why I don't care if I lost all my
[1:29:18] friends I gain God I gain Christ I gain
[1:29:22] brother amen Christ is our brother
[1:29:24] amen let me lose all that let me gain
[1:29:27] Christ amen that's my
[1:29:30] life this is the word of the
[1:29:33] Lord although we used to be out it's
[1:29:35] just like David's Mighty Men remember
[1:29:36] they were all outcasts but when they saw
[1:29:38] a man that could take uh the word of God
[1:29:41] and live it and cast down Goliath they
[1:29:43] said I can support a man like that glory
[1:29:46] and that's what we did when we seen the
[1:29:47] Holy Ghost right that's what we seen
[1:29:49] when we seen brother Bram that's what we
[1:29:50] seen we said will follow a man who's got
[1:29:53] the leadership of the Holy Ghost and I
[1:29:55] want my life to look like that as a
[1:29:57] local Minister that you see the Holy
[1:29:59] Ghost healing in the ministry that's
[1:30:01] what we desire praise God
[1:30:05] Amen that's what God always had a
[1:30:07] witness on the earth and he had he's
[1:30:09] always had a bunch of Mighty Men praise
[1:30:12] God wonder if he's got any mighty men
[1:30:14] that can that can judge the right the
[1:30:15] right situation he needs mighty men that
[1:30:18] can judge this is the right thing to do
[1:30:20] this is the wrong thing to do praise God
[1:30:22] this is the right direction for your
[1:30:24] life that's the wrong direction for your
[1:30:25] life God loves judgment praise God he
[1:30:29] loves the house of God for that's where
[1:30:30] judgment Goes Forth like I told some of
[1:30:33] these brothers lately you know they're
[1:30:35] giving their hearts to God and following
[1:30:36] God I said if you don't know the
[1:30:37] decision to make I said listen to me
[1:30:40] follow me as I follow Christ that's
[1:30:42] quite a statement to say but it's Bible
[1:30:44] amen praise the Lord that's exactly the
[1:30:47] scripture the Bible said follow them
[1:30:49] whose Faith uh has been tried and tested
[1:30:52] amen I've been walking this way since
[1:30:55] 2001 I've been walking the message amen
[1:30:57] so I got a few years behind me but the
[1:30:59] point is follow my faith the Bible said
[1:31:01] God gives us pastors so that you follow
[1:31:04] their example in other words live like
[1:31:06] them have faith like them amen because
[1:31:09] they're following God Amen said there's
[1:31:11] no higher order in the whole church than
[1:31:13] the local Pastor as far as to that
[1:31:16] assembly praise God how you believe that
[1:31:19] now the highest preaching gift is the
[1:31:21] apostle know that but the highest office
[1:31:24] locally is a pastor even an apostle
[1:31:27] cannot walk in and change the church the
[1:31:29] church as a whole must vote to remove a
[1:31:32] pastor the church as a whole must vote
[1:31:34] to remove remove deacons and soth I'm
[1:31:37] sorry I believe brother said a pastor
[1:31:38] can remove a deacon but to to change the
[1:31:41] leadership in the local assembly one man
[1:31:43] can't do it it's the body that must do
[1:31:45] it amen because that's the highest
[1:31:48] office the shepherd has the highest
[1:31:50] office in the local assembly but but not
[1:31:52] of course the highest preaching office
[1:31:53] that's Apostle then Prophet
[1:31:56] amen now what is worship worship is
[1:31:59] Pleasant to God Worship Is cely God
[1:32:01] loves to be worshiped amen when did
[1:32:04] Jesus ever stop anybody from kissing his
[1:32:06] feet can anybody show me that anybody
[1:32:08] ever show me where Jesus stopped
[1:32:09] somebody from worshiping him he never
[1:32:12] did he let him just stand right there
[1:32:14] and say my Lord and my God he let him
[1:32:16] kiss his feet he let him cry on his feet
[1:32:19] he loved to be worshiped he never
[1:32:21] stopped any body from worshiping him
[1:32:23] amen and God won't stop you from
[1:32:25] worshiping him tonight amen he'll accept
[1:32:27] your worship it's Pleasant you'll be
[1:32:30] blessed as you bless him because he
[1:32:32] dwells in the Praises of his people all
[1:32:36] right Psalm
[1:32:38] 63 verse
[1:32:45] one after this I'm after this I'm going
[1:32:47] to try to make a little pivot
[1:32:49] here and go a little different Direction
[1:32:52] kind of bring this down on the home

[1:33:00] grace verse one 63 verse one oh God Thou
[1:33:03] Art my God early will I seek thee my
[1:33:05] soul thirst for thee my flesh longth for
[1:33:06] thee and a dry and thirsty land where no
[1:33:08] water is look at this you got brother
[1:33:10] said you got to have a desperation for
[1:33:11] God he said if you don't have a
[1:33:13] desperation for God God won't answer
[1:33:15] your prayer praise God listen to
[1:33:17] desperation 1963 you got to be desperate
[1:33:19] for God and then God will come on the
[1:33:21] seene you got to thirst for it to see
[1:33:24] thy power and thy Glory so have I have
[1:33:26] seen the thee in the
[1:33:27] sanctuary because thy loving kindness is
[1:33:30] better than life my lips shall praise

[1:33:33] amen thus will I bless thee while I live
[1:33:36] I will lift up my hands to thy name my
[1:33:38] soul shall be satisfied as with tomorrow
[1:33:40] and fatness and my mouth shall praise
[1:33:41] thee with joyful lips when I remember
[1:33:43] thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in
[1:33:46] the night
[1:33:47] watches because thou has been my help
[1:33:50] therefore in the shadow of thy Wings
[1:33:51] will I Rejoice my soul fth hard after
[1:33:54] thee thy right hand upholdeth
[1:33:57] me now church I just want to share this
[1:33:59] recently I was holding Victoria at night
[1:34:01] trying to get her to
[1:34:04] bed and I you know I had I had a few
[1:34:06] things I struggle with that day and I
[1:34:08] said I propped up a few pillows so I
[1:34:10] could you know not lean flat because she
[1:34:11] don't like to lay flat she likes me to
[1:34:13] lay at an
[1:34:14] angle and church as I sat there I I was
[1:34:16] on my phone I started reading the
[1:34:18] scripture or something like that and I
[1:34:20] started confessing my sin I made a
[1:34:22] mistake that day I said God forgive
[1:34:25] me I said Lord I want to serve you
[1:34:28] better and as I after I got done
[1:34:30] confessing I started thinking about how
[1:34:32] God showed me this message I started
[1:34:34] thinking about this scripture right here
[1:34:36] where the Bible said when I remember
[1:34:38] thee on my bed and meditate on thee in
[1:34:40] the night watches I started crying God's
[1:34:43] my witness I started crying there right
[1:34:44] there on my bed thanking God and I
[1:34:47] started thinking that song I Feel the
[1:34:48] pull because the Bible said or that I'm
[1:34:51] sorry the song says I lay on my bed and
[1:34:53] I begin to cry and I don't know wonder
[1:34:55] and I wonder why but church I didn't
[1:34:57] wonder why because I knew I was crying
[1:34:58] because I was thankful God forgave me
[1:35:00] and that God loves me amen and that God
[1:35:03] would think of me sister brother to
[1:35:05] bring me into the greatest message uh in
[1:35:07] our day praise the Lord there's a lot of
[1:35:09] messages out there but we've got the the
[1:35:11] message from God we have thus say the
[1:35:13] Lord from God we have the revelation of
[1:35:15] the hour the light of the hour that God
[1:35:18] would Place me in that instead of some
[1:35:20] sinful sin loving church or something
[1:35:22] like that that made me cry and the Bible
[1:35:24] said we should meditate on our beds in
[1:35:27] the night watches amen glory let's make
[1:35:31] our beds a place to cry and praise God
[1:35:34] amen amen and not a place to look at the
[1:35:36] wrong thing right or say the wrong thing
[1:35:38] that's where the devil got into people's
[1:35:40] lives first brother said first he got go
[1:35:42] to picture shows and then he tricked
[1:35:44] them and brought TVs in their house
[1:35:46] right and then he brought in the bedroom
[1:35:48] and now the bedroom is not even a place
[1:35:49] to pray anymore now it's just an
[1:35:51] entertain spot God don't want us have
[1:35:53] entertainment God wants us to have life
[1:35:55] God wants us to have joy God wants us to
[1:35:57] have love God wants us to have a reality
[1:35:59] of his word in our lives a living
[1:36:02] reality not the American dream but a
[1:36:04] Christian reality that's what we're
[1:36:05] after amen a reality of Christ's
[1:36:08] presence in our life
[1:36:11] amen now like I said I want to start
[1:36:14] bringing this down here those are some
[1:36:15] of the most important scriptures uh I
[1:36:18] think that that would be good for us
[1:36:20] here tonight
[1:36:23] uh everybody love the Lord amen I'm
[1:36:26] going to try to make I might read maybe
[1:36:27] just a few more
[1:36:28] scriptures I'm just going to be
[1:36:30] referencing a few okay now let's go to
[1:36:32] Hebrews 10 I want end with this one as
[1:36:34] far as just maybe reading scriptures and
[1:36:36] I just wrote down a whole bunch of
[1:36:37] burdens on my heart I like to share with
[1:36:38] the
[1:36:41] Saints now I want you to understand as
[1:36:43] we turn to Hebrews chapter 10 that as
[1:36:45] pastor of the church I know what brother
[1:36:46] man said I'm the ax of the team the ax
[1:36:49] of the team carries the most burden
[1:36:51] right right you have an ax and you they
[1:36:54] carry the burd that's why you got an ax
[1:36:55] that can work do so I understand I
[1:36:57] should have the greatest burden for this
[1:37:00] ministry right I should that
[1:37:03] burden um and I I try to have that by
[1:37:06] God's grace to keep my life pure to
[1:37:07] preach and study and pray and go visit
[1:37:10] people and do what I can and and be a
[1:37:12] Ser real servant to Christ I should have
[1:37:15] the greatest burden I really
[1:37:17] should now let's read uh Hebrews 10
[1:37:23] because after we read this this is the
[1:37:24] scripture where brother R often quotes
[1:37:26] that we should not skip church we should
[1:37:29] attend every time the doors are open how
[1:37:32] many you believe that amen we should do
[1:37:35] that every time the doors are open
[1:37:39] uh so let's uh let's look at this here
[1:37:42] by God's grace Hebrews 10:24 now and let
[1:37:46] us consider one another to revoke unto
[1:37:48] love and to Good Works so let's stop
[1:37:52] right there we should consider people
[1:37:54] and we should provoke them to love and
[1:37:57] to Good Works provoke of course what you
[1:37:59] would say means to inspire or motivate
[1:38:01] them right we should live such a a life
[1:38:04] that we should motivate each other to
[1:38:05] live closer to
[1:38:07] Christ now that's manifested in many
[1:38:09] ways you could sing a song you could
[1:38:12] text somebody you could pray for
[1:38:13] somebody you could give somebody
[1:38:14] something they need right you visit
[1:38:16] somebody there's all kinds of ways to
[1:38:18] encourage but look this is and then
[1:38:21] there's a a colon after that which means
[1:38:23] it's going to keep going on it's going
[1:38:24] to list how you do this so how do you
[1:38:27] provoke love and good works in the body
[1:38:30] of
[1:38:32] Christ you do this by not forsaking that
[1:38:35] means
[1:38:36] abandoning the assembling of ourselves
[1:38:39] together as the manner of sum is I don't
[1:38:42] want to be the sum in this
[1:38:44] scripture I don't want to be the son I
[1:38:47] want be those that gather I want to be a
[1:38:49] gatherer praise God not the some that
[1:38:51] abandon the house of God but those who
[1:38:54] are faithful to the house of God
[1:38:57] Amen but exhorting one another so
[1:39:00] instead of forsaking because remember uh
[1:39:03] that's what I'm sorry instead of
[1:39:05] abandoning which forsaken instead of
[1:39:07] abandoning church and the Saints you
[1:39:10] should exort one
[1:39:12] another and so much the more as you see
[1:39:16] that day
[1:39:17] approaching now exort means to
[1:39:20] strengthen
[1:39:22] so let me start looking at this a little
[1:39:24] bit here I want to just get into a few
[1:39:25] thoughts
[1:39:28] here the Bible says that we exhort one
[1:39:32] another we should provoke one another
[1:39:35] that's quite quite plain there by God's
[1:39:39] grace and how do you do that how do you
[1:39:42] strengthen brother Austin how do you
[1:39:44] strengthen brother Benjamin how do you
[1:39:45] strike the brother Jose how do you do
[1:39:47] that the Bible said you gather together
[1:39:51] and you edify
[1:39:53] them okay you love them the Bible said
[1:39:56] you love them so you find out how does
[1:39:58] this brother or sister need love and
[1:40:00] that's what you give them
[1:40:02] amen so if they need time with you or if
[1:40:05] they need a gift from you they need a
[1:40:07] hug from you if they need encouraging
[1:40:08] word from you uh they need a visit from
[1:40:11] you you give them what they need to feel
[1:40:14] love praise God if there's a work that
[1:40:16] they have need of then you help them
[1:40:18] with their work that's the way a real
[1:40:20] Christian Church uh
[1:40:22] response praise
[1:40:25] God so let me start here I told I
[1:40:28] emailed everybody I said I'm gonna give
[1:40:29] some warnings for those who Miss
[1:40:32] services for the I'm talking about for
[1:40:34] the wrong reasons now everybody bear
[1:40:36] with me on live stre I've got out for
[1:40:37] the the wrong reasons if you're sick and
[1:40:39] you can't make it to church I understand
[1:40:41] that if your boss forces you to work I
[1:40:43] understand that but if you voluntarily
[1:40:46] miss church to work off of volunteering
[1:40:50] uh you should EX examine your life at
[1:40:51] that
[1:40:52] point right or if you just don't be like
[1:40:55] going or if you put anything else above
[1:40:58] Church you really should examine your
[1:41:00] life because you're missing God's
[1:41:02] judgment you're missing what God loves
[1:41:05] and then
[1:41:06] also if you don't attend what the now
[1:41:09] what the Bible says here you lose
[1:41:12] influence with other
[1:41:14] Christians because the only way to edify
[1:41:17] them is to see
[1:41:19] them a text is not
[1:41:22] enough God said Gather and assemble and
[1:41:26] be with them don't abandon Gathering as
[1:41:29] you see that day approaching and he said
[1:41:31] gather more as you see that day
[1:41:33] approaching so let me give you a warning
[1:41:35] you start losing your influence with
[1:41:38] people because you don't you're not
[1:41:40] there to love
[1:41:41] them you're not there to help them
[1:41:43] you're not there to encourage them so
[1:41:45] people start they don't receive your
[1:41:47] influence as much anymore because you're
[1:41:49] not loving them like you ought
[1:41:51] to I've told this to people before just
[1:41:54] you coming to church raises my faith
[1:41:57] tremendously when I wonder where so and
[1:41:59] so and somebody come to church it just
[1:42:01] puts a huge and some of you probably
[1:42:03] seen it puts a huge smile on my face it
[1:42:06] it just lifts my face so much to see
[1:42:08] God's people come to God's house that in
[1:42:11] itself makes me want to serve God more
[1:42:13] when when people come to the house of
[1:42:15] God now of course it works that way with
[1:42:17] each other too right doesn't encourage
[1:42:20] you you get to talk to people out the
[1:42:21] parking lot or get to pray for people up
[1:42:23] here aren't you glad that people come
[1:42:25] and pray for you here doesn't that
[1:42:27] encourage you do that strengthen you
[1:42:30] well if you miss church here's a warning
[1:42:32] you start losing
[1:42:33] influence and you can't influence people
[1:42:36] like you ought to in other words you
[1:42:38] stop living you're really stopping
[1:42:40] living for other people you should be
[1:42:42] living for the PE the family of God the
[1:42:44] Bible said do good to all man but
[1:42:46] especially those of the household of
[1:42:49] faith
[1:42:51] now I couldn't find a scripture on the
[1:42:52] word confidence so I'm not going to say
[1:42:54] confidence because people might not lose
[1:42:56] confidence in you uh if you don't come
[1:42:58] to church I don't want to say that
[1:42:59] because I couldn't find a scripture on
[1:43:01] that and if you find one let me know but
[1:43:03] your influence you can't if you miss
[1:43:06] church for the wrong reasons people will
[1:43:08] not receive your influence your
[1:43:10] testimony doesn't mean as much as it
[1:43:13] could you could have more impact upon
[1:43:15] people now that's what the Bible said
[1:43:17] you provoke one another to good works
[1:43:20] and exhorting more as you see that day
[1:43:23] approaching so when you miss church even
[1:43:25] physically and you could be there you
[1:43:27] miss a chance to strengthen the rest of
[1:43:29] the body of Christ how many believe the
[1:43:31] Bible's
[1:43:32] true that's one
[1:43:36] warning that's a reality and brother
[1:43:39] baram said this if you miss the word of
[1:43:42] God in the small manners he said the
[1:43:44] rest of it will go right over your head
[1:43:46] my goodness brother said those who have
[1:43:49] obeyed in these small things will catch
[1:43:51] it and there's other things if they have
[1:43:53] it it'll go over the top of their head
[1:43:56] as far as the East is from the West if
[1:43:58] we can't even obey the simple command of
[1:44:01] gathering more and not abandoning the
[1:44:03] church how how are we going to get the
[1:44:06] Deep things of God if we can't even
[1:44:07] catch the simple things of God praise
[1:44:11] God Amen how are we gonna get rapture in
[1:44:13] faith when we can't even obey gather
[1:44:15] more as you see that day
[1:44:17] approaching oh my church that that's why
[1:44:20] start doing Sunday night services
[1:44:22] because Church the Bible said we got to
[1:44:24] gather together
[1:44:25] more how are you doing it if we're so
[1:44:27] busy when do we gather with Saints on
[1:44:29] Monday through Saturday when very little
[1:44:31] don't
[1:44:33] we so your pastor just felt l a few
[1:44:35] years ago let's do Sunday night services
[1:44:37] and then God sent a man Nam named amen
[1:44:40] Lee on the Sunday night and he got saved
[1:44:41] and come in the message Hallelujah and
[1:44:45] Le is fill with the Holy Ghost now why
[1:44:47] because we had a Sunday night
[1:44:49] service praise God
[1:44:51] he couldn't come in the morning because
[1:44:52] he was at the Mong church he couldn't
[1:44:54] come in the morning he could come in the
[1:44:55] evening time praise
[1:44:58] God when people start missing Church
[1:45:01] they lose opportunities to influence
[1:45:03] others and they can't influence others
[1:45:05] as well as they
[1:45:07] could and I'll say like this like I just
[1:45:09] said if we if we can't obey these simple
[1:45:11] things about just coming to church
[1:45:12] paying ties loving God singing worship
[1:45:14] and praising God with a humble heart how
[1:45:16] are we going to catch the deeper things
[1:45:19] brother Braham said do the ABCs first
[1:45:21] and then you'll get spiritual
[1:45:23] algebra Hallelujah is that what he said
[1:45:26] they said brother you ought to teach
[1:45:27] these women to gifts and spiritual
[1:45:29] things he said how can I teach them
[1:45:31] algebra gifts when they won't even obey
[1:45:33] cutting their hair coming to church not
[1:45:35] wearing makeup not smoking and drinking
[1:45:37] amen if you can't obey the ABCs How You
[1:45:40] Gonna Be Ready for
[1:45:44] algebra now remember a Holy Ghost Church
[1:45:46] gives warnings how many you know that
[1:45:49] Colossians one let's read that just
[1:45:50] briefly that's why I feel L of the Lord
[1:45:53] just to give a warning
[1:45:54] tonight if we say we're Christians and
[1:45:57] brother said if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:45:58] you can say Amen to every word of God if
[1:46:00] I'm preaching God's word and you got the
[1:46:01] Holy Ghost you should be able to say
[1:46:03] Amen to
[1:46:04] it that's right Colossians one the very
[1:46:08] last few
[1:46:12] scriptures now
[1:46:14] verse
[1:46:17] 20 27 is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:46:20] what is that that's the baptism of the
[1:46:21] Holy Ghost how many you know that amen
[1:46:23] now look at the very next scripture whom
[1:46:25] we preach so we preach Christ warning
[1:46:27] every man and teaching every man in all
[1:46:29] wisdom that we may present every man
[1:46:31] perfect in Christ Jesus that's what I'm
[1:46:32] doing tonight I'm trying to warn people
[1:46:34] that don't come to church as much as
[1:46:36] they used to right I'm trying to warn
[1:46:38] those that do come to church like we'll
[1:46:39] said we'll balance it out because just
[1:46:41] because we come to church don't mean
[1:46:42] we're right Pharisees came to church a
[1:46:44] lot too is that right denomination
[1:46:47] people can go more Church than some of
[1:46:49] us sometimes
[1:46:52] but it's the condition in which you come
[1:46:54] amen it's the condition once you get
[1:46:57] here so there's a warning for all of us
[1:46:58] I'm not just pointing fingers at people
[1:47:00] that you know aren't coming to church
[1:47:01] all the time I'm well I'm warning
[1:47:03] everybody I got to make sure my heart
[1:47:05] doesn't get hard because the Bible said
[1:47:07] uh the minister must give the meat and
[1:47:08] due season if not he'll start get
[1:47:10] drunken with his own lust and start
[1:47:12] beating the people and I don't want to
[1:47:13] hurt the people because I've seen
[1:47:15] preachers that hurt the people praise
[1:47:17] God they put too much on them that they
[1:47:20] themselves don't even do but church I
[1:47:22] try to I I try not to ask anybody to do
[1:47:24] anything that I'm not doing I won't ask
[1:47:27] you to fast unless I'm fasting myself
[1:47:29] amen I would ask you to come to church
[1:47:31] unless I'm coming to church myself amen
[1:47:34] amen and that's why we have to live we
[1:47:36] have to live that right that way before
[1:47:38] all men amen
[1:47:41] now the second
[1:47:43] thing is that as parents I want to get
[1:47:46] to the parents there's a warning for
[1:47:49] parents when we don't come to the house
[1:47:51] of God it's sending a message to our
[1:47:53] children I'm not saying it like I said
[1:47:55] there's reasons that you miss if there's
[1:47:57] real Reasons I'm talking about if
[1:47:58] there's not a reason if there's not a
[1:48:01] real reason to this church it sends the
[1:48:03] message that God's house is not the most
[1:48:06] important thing it always sends that
[1:48:08] message it says it's well church is just
[1:48:11] optional word did God say that in all
[1:48:13] those scripture we just read he said Joy
[1:48:16] was there he said love was there he said
[1:48:18] he loved judgment he said he loved that
[1:48:20] place more than any other place you
[1:48:21] could go
[1:48:24] hallelujah amen it sends the message
[1:48:27] that God is really not number one
[1:48:29] serving God is
[1:48:33] optional praise
[1:48:35] God the Bible said Jesus in Luke 4:16 as
[1:48:40] his custom was he went into the Sabbath
[1:48:42] on the Sabbath day custom means habit
[1:48:45] Jesus's habit was he was in church every
[1:48:48] Saturday because he said I always to
[1:48:50] those things that please the father so
[1:48:52] it pleased God that Jesus never missed
[1:48:53] church he was always in the always in
[1:48:56] the the synagogue or temple on the
[1:48:58] Sabbath day yeah praise
[1:49:01] God so Jesus's example is that we obey
[1:49:05] the Lord
[1:49:06] amen
[1:49:09] now let me go down to some more quotes
[1:49:12] from brother Brandon that we can see
[1:49:13] these I want I want to lay a few more
[1:49:15] warnings that will be done here by God's
[1:49:19] grace
[1:49:22] brother says this and God keeps his word
[1:49:24] 1957 you say you have to love the Lord
[1:49:28] you ought to go to church brother BR
[1:49:29] said you don't have to tell them people
[1:49:31] that they go anyhow so brother says you
[1:49:34] don't have to tell people that they
[1:49:35] should go to church he said the real
[1:49:38] Christians will do it
[1:49:39] anyhow they'll walk through rain to go
[1:49:42] to church he
[1:49:43] says hallelujah they'll go through death
[1:49:46] to go to church sure they love it they
[1:49:49] just got to get there that's all there
[1:49:51] is to it it's their life if they don't
[1:49:54] they feel like they're perishing now all
[1:49:57] of us can remember when the times we
[1:49:59] love God the most where we felt bad when
[1:50:02] we missed Church anybody say Amen to
[1:50:05] that that's what brother says a real
[1:50:08] Christian feels like they're perishing
[1:50:10] if they can't hear the preaching of the
[1:50:11] word because Jesus said when he ascended
[1:50:14] I'm sending five gifts to preach and
[1:50:16] these gifts will preach and they will
[1:50:17] edify they will perfect will complete
[1:50:21] the Bride of Jesus Christ they will
[1:50:23] bring her to a Unity of the faith and
[1:50:25] the bride wants to be a part of that
[1:50:27] because that's why Jesus gave the gifts
[1:50:29] so she could be
[1:50:30] perfect
[1:50:32] amen right without without with with
[1:50:36] missing Church you feel like your Soul's
[1:50:39] perishing because it hasn't fed on the
[1:50:41] word of God
[1:50:43] lately
[1:50:48] amen okay even said this he said when
[1:50:51] people complain say he says this you say
[1:50:53] well I well I got to get up and get the
[1:50:55] kitties ready to go to church this
[1:50:56] morning brother said oh my you've never
[1:50:58] touched the resurrection brother when
[1:51:00] the resurrection has come into your
[1:51:01] heart you long to go to church there's
[1:51:05] something that you just can't keep away
[1:51:06] from it something
[1:51:09] inside praise
[1:51:11] God
[1:51:13] Amen brother B
[1:51:16] says for if you love God you couldn't
[1:51:19] wire you away from church they couldn't
[1:51:21] chain you away from it they can't hide a
[1:51:24] Believer from
[1:51:26] God people can't bind you and chain you
[1:51:29] up at your house you'll break loose just
[1:51:31] to come to church now I thought
[1:51:33] everybody said they believe God sent a
[1:51:35] prophet right how do you believe every
[1:51:37] word brother R
[1:51:38] said
[1:51:40] amen well then let's live like it praise
[1:51:42] God if God sent a Propet let's do what
[1:51:45] he said amen amen I just happen to
[1:51:47] believe that brother Ram was right if
[1:51:49] you you got the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:51:51] born again nobody can keep you out of
[1:51:53] the house of God you'll go to church
[1:51:55] because you feel like you're dying if
[1:51:56] you
[1:51:57] don't amen amen amen
[1:52:02] hallelujah brother said I'll go to
[1:52:04] church he said even if I can't get a
[1:52:05] wholeo I'll take a slice I'll go listen
[1:52:09] and show him that I'm doing my part I
[1:52:12] want everyone to know which side I'm on
[1:52:14] so when you miss church people wonder
[1:52:16] which side is brother so and so on huh
[1:52:19] what side his sister so and so on if
[1:52:21] they don't come to church when they
[1:52:22] ought to see it gives a spirit of
[1:52:25] confusion is God the author of confusion
[1:52:28] no sir God is not the author of
[1:52:32] confusion praise
[1:52:38] God now I want to find the quote about
[1:52:41] um yeah here it is brother said Christ
[1:52:44] the mystery this is a very familiar one
[1:52:45] but listen brother said don't stay home
[1:52:49] if God is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:52:51] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:52:54] to get in there to fellowship with your
[1:52:56] brothers
[1:52:59] amen if you don't feel that way I tell
[1:53:01] you it's time you got praying because
[1:53:03] we're in the last days and the Bible
[1:53:04] exort us to much more as we see that day
[1:53:07] approaching to love one another and
[1:53:09] assemble ourselves together in Heavenly
[1:53:11] places so your motivation to come to
[1:53:14] church is to see the people you love the
[1:53:16] most amen I like a lot of people but the
[1:53:19] people I love the most are sitting here
[1:53:21] tonight and live streaming by God's
[1:53:23] grace who do I spend my free time with
[1:53:26] I'm looking at them praise God who do I
[1:53:30] love and try to help out I'm looking at
[1:53:32] him amen praise the Lord the people you
[1:53:36] love the most should be church people
[1:53:38] amen your church family amen it ought to
[1:53:41] be if not brother says time you got the
[1:53:43] praying and this even ties you with the
[1:53:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[1:53:47] brother R said if God's in your heart
[1:53:48] you can't wait for somebody to open
[1:53:50] those doors out there or door the door
[1:53:53] there's only one door for this church
[1:53:55] coming the door Christ is the door amen
[1:53:58] you understand what I'm
[1:53:59] saying so this to me Church attendance
[1:54:03] ties in with the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:05] Ghost because if they were saying how my
[1:54:07] if David was saying how my soul Longs
[1:54:10] for the house of God in the Old
[1:54:11] Testament when the Holy Ghost could not
[1:54:13] be given what about here where we got
[1:54:15] the Holy Ghost and we can't wait to get
[1:54:17] with our family that we're going to
[1:54:18] spend eternity with
[1:54:23] Hallelujah so the warning is you lose
[1:54:25] your influence people don't they don't
[1:54:28] they can't feel that you love them now
[1:54:29] they might know as a Christian but they
[1:54:31] can't feel it praise
[1:54:33] God they can't feel your love because
[1:54:36] that's why you come said to love one
[1:54:38] another when brother Jose sings a
[1:54:40] special he's shown his love for God but
[1:54:43] also Us Praise the
[1:54:45] Lord when you come to church and help
[1:54:47] somebody out or give somebody ride to
[1:54:49] church or you know help them out with
[1:54:51] some money or help them out with some
[1:54:52] clothes or whatever you're loving them
[1:54:55] we ought to love each other better than
[1:54:56] everybody else I tell you it's a shame
[1:54:59] if you love Sinners more than you love
[1:55:01] this group this wonderful group right
[1:55:02] here because those Sinners were turning
[1:55:04] their back on you real fast and you
[1:55:05] start talking about God Amen and God's
[1:55:08] your real father a God's your real
[1:55:10] family amen these are the people we all
[1:55:12] love right here praise the
[1:55:15] Lord no doubt about that said you got
[1:55:18] God in your heart you can't hardly wait
[1:55:20] till church to start so let me say to
[1:55:22] our live streamers if God's in their
[1:55:23] heart and they can't come to church they
[1:55:25] can't wait to turn on the computer to
[1:55:27] live
[1:55:28] stream glory glory
[1:55:31] glory amen I believe that brother ra
[1:55:35] said if you don't have a church home
[1:55:36] you'll die of course we know a church
[1:55:38] home we know
[1:55:41] that brother R said once you get saved
[1:55:44] he said remain faithful at your post of
[1:55:46] Duty until you until you
[1:55:48] die
[1:55:50] let me read this quote some of us forget
[1:55:51] about
[1:55:54] this where is it here it
[1:55:58] is brother Brandon when he ordained
[1:56:00] Perry green as a a Pastor said this what
[1:56:03] house will you build me November 21st
[1:56:06] 1965 he said we ought to be very
[1:56:08] grateful to God that they open up a
[1:56:11] church like this and he said and attend
[1:56:15] every
[1:56:16] service I'm going to read that again we
[1:56:19] to be very grateful to God and attend
[1:56:23] every
[1:56:25] service that's why that's a warning to
[1:56:27] to the people and everyone everyone
[1:56:29] that's a warning to people that aren't
[1:56:31] here brother brand said attend every
[1:56:34] service and the church said am that's
[1:56:37] what the message says that's what Jesus
[1:56:40] did amen he was his customed to go to
[1:56:43] God's house he declared God's name to
[1:56:45] his
[1:56:47] Brethren brother said take every place
[1:56:50] that we can and if we're asked now look
[1:56:52] if we're asked to call on to pray to
[1:56:55] seek to do let's be soldiers just
[1:56:58] anxious to do it that's what brother
[1:56:59] brandom
[1:57:00] said now let me share this for last
[1:57:03] Saturday I asked people to come to the
[1:57:04] church and pray and fast two people
[1:57:07] came I'm not upset and I'm not gonna I'm
[1:57:10] not going to bash anybody but I I hope
[1:57:12] if you weren't here I hope you at least
[1:57:13] praying for Christopher and and Samuel
[1:57:16] that's what I sent the email about
[1:57:18] brother B said if some somebody asked
[1:57:19] you to pray he said be anxious to do it
[1:57:23] if somebody asked you to do something he
[1:57:24] said be anxious to do it if you didn't
[1:57:26] fast for Christopher would you do it I
[1:57:29] hope you I hope you will I just missed
[1:57:32] two meals on Saturday I ate Saturday
[1:57:34] after service so I ate about you know 8
[1:57:35] o'clock every service that's I didn't
[1:57:37] eat the food all day if I'm gonna fast
[1:57:40] I'm gonna fast and I invited everybody
[1:57:42] to fast with me is that right here's
[1:57:45] what I did church I read this quote uh
[1:57:47] in a Sunday night service recently and I
[1:57:49] got convicted so let me read it to
[1:57:51] you brother R said this and I showed
[1:57:53] this to the other person that was here
[1:57:54] on Saturday when we were fasting and
[1:57:57] praying brother B said when we bring the
[1:57:59] sick up before us and they fail to be
[1:58:02] healed we need to call a solemn fast and
[1:58:05] call assembly something's wrong
[1:58:07] somewhere God made the promise God's got
[1:58:09] to stick to that promise and he'll do it
[1:58:12] I read that quote on a Sunday night
[1:58:13] recently not many people are here well
[1:58:15] God knows where everyone is at I don't
[1:58:16] know where at I love everybody but I
[1:58:18] love God's house so I'm going to come to
[1:58:20] church I wasn't sick so I'm going to
[1:58:21] come to church all right so that's I'm
[1:58:23] just saying I come I believe I believe
[1:58:25] what brother said I come to church but
[1:58:28] Christopher we brought him up here
[1:58:29] numerous times and he hasn't been healed
[1:58:32] and last or two Wednesdays ago I saw
[1:58:34] Jose there crying about Christopher I
[1:58:36] said let's fast and pray I just be led
[1:58:38] let's fast and pray I gave everybody
[1:58:39] nine days notice and two people showed
[1:58:41] up fine that's fine that's between you
[1:58:43] and the Lord but I want you to know I
[1:58:46] read what brother R said and I believed
[1:58:48] it I called a f asked and brother said
[1:58:51] we should be anxious to do something if
[1:58:53] you're asked to do
[1:58:56] it that's for the live streamers that's
[1:58:58] for here and that's for those who are
[1:58:59] not streaming that hopefully will stream
[1:59:01] later the
[1:59:03] archive I felt that was let of the Lord
[1:59:05] to fast and pray when people don't get
[1:59:07] healed something's wrong we need to fast
[1:59:09] and say what's wrong am I sinting is
[1:59:11] there sin in the church is somebody
[1:59:13] lusting is somebody breaking the law is
[1:59:15] somebody stealing what's wrong the sick
[1:59:18] should be healed amen
[1:59:20] amen and I did and God knows I did what
[1:59:23] brother random said I called a fast and
[1:59:26] I invited the whole church to come now
[1:59:28] here's where I made a mistake I
[1:59:29] challenged you remember I said I
[1:59:30] challenged you last Wednesday so forgive
[1:59:33] me I need to apologize for that I feel
[1:59:34] like I just went a little bit too far in
[1:59:36] my flesh so forgive me I did challenge
[1:59:39] the church I need to repent of that I
[1:59:41] I'll try to apologize on Sunday if I
[1:59:42] don't forget if I forget somebody remind
[1:59:44] me say brother just you need to
[1:59:45] apologize so church I'm sorry I got a
[1:59:48] little bit overboard I challenge people
[1:59:49] to
[1:59:50] come but now in the light of what
[1:59:53] brother Ram said attend every service
[1:59:54] and when the sick don't get healed I
[1:59:56] gave everybody nine days notice to come
[1:59:57] pray and fast I hope somebody was
[1:59:59] praying and fasting at their house if
[2:00:01] not I'll call another
[2:00:02] one and I expect you to if you believe
[2:00:05] God God said a prophet I expect you to
[2:00:06] do what the prophet
[2:00:08] said if not get right with God get on
[2:00:11] your knees get on your face and
[2:00:13] pray if not you're lukewarm I'll just
[2:00:15] say like that lukewarm is everybody with
[2:00:17] me amen I want to read
[2:00:20] that how many believe that by God's
[2:00:22] grace I'll be with all my heart and
[2:00:25] here's some wisdom I want to give
[2:00:27] because here are some reasons where even
[2:00:29] I've been tempted not to T tend church
[2:00:31] and I'm the pastor I I get tempted like
[2:00:34] everybody else here's one reason now
[2:00:36] work
[2:00:38] constraints like we said if it's
[2:00:41] something mandatory yes but if that
[2:00:44] keeps up for a long time let me say like
[2:00:46] this and everybody listen it's time you
[2:00:47] got praying for another job because
[2:00:49] you're missing the anointing of the Holy
[2:00:51] Ghost to church and you're losing
[2:00:53] influence with the Believers not able to
[2:00:55] love them and build them up like you
[2:00:57] ought to how many can say Amen to that
[2:01:00] it's time you got praying for a
[2:01:01] different job I pray for those brothers
[2:01:03] that work second shift I pray for them
[2:01:05] often God give them a new job God give
[2:01:07] them a new job so they can come on
[2:01:08] Wednesday night because we need God on
[2:01:10] Wednesday
[2:01:11] night God's heal people on Wednesday
[2:01:13] night sister H God's heal me on
[2:01:16] Wednesday night amen we need God every
[2:01:20] hour praise the Lord what if it's every
[2:01:22] now and then like Jose you know
[2:01:24] different brothers that got to work on
[2:01:25] you amen but I'm still praying that God
[2:01:28] will give these brothers Jobs first
[2:01:30] shift or third then you can attend
[2:01:33] service you understand what I'm saying
[2:01:36] so see you need to have a solution if
[2:01:37] you're missing Church ask God for a
[2:01:40] solution is God is work greater than God
[2:01:44] is anything too hard for
[2:01:47] God nothing is too hard for God brother
[2:01:51] man said all too little time is spent on
[2:01:53] laboring for the Eternal rewards of God
[2:01:56] there's rewards we can get here at
[2:01:57] church if we pray for
[2:01:59] people amen and we brother man said we
[2:02:03] do not spend enough time laboring for
[2:02:05] the rewards of God that's why we have
[2:02:07] more services so we can have more
[2:02:09] chances to pray and try to do things for
[2:02:12] the Lord try to manifest his love
[2:02:14] towards
[2:02:16] people here's another one we're too
[2:02:18] tired on Sunday church if anyone knows
[2:02:20] about being tired on Sunday it's my
[2:02:21] family night I got six kids amen my wife
[2:02:24] gets them all up while I'm studying she
[2:02:25] gets them all gets them dress gets them
[2:02:26] fat all these things like that Mal kind
[2:02:28] l or great help but if anybody
[2:02:30] understands tired on a Sunday I
[2:02:32] sometimes I teach Sunday school on
[2:02:34] Sunday I lead songs on Sunday both
[2:02:36] services and preach both
[2:02:40] services and you want to see who's tired
[2:02:42] on
[2:02:43] Monday you understand what I'm saying if
[2:02:45] anybody knows tired it's me but
[2:02:48] tiredness is not excuse to not come to
[2:02:49] God's
[2:02:51] house and here's a big here's a good
[2:02:53] some good advice if you know Sunday's
[2:02:55] going to be long what should you do on
[2:02:57] Saturday Church rest go to bed early yes
[2:03:01] go to bed early and make Saturday your
[2:03:03] day of
[2:03:04] rest because Sunday is your spiritual
[2:03:07] rest where you get the rest for your
[2:03:08] soul and you can feel good in your
[2:03:11] soul every time almost every time I walk
[2:03:13] out those doors on Sunday night I'm
[2:03:14] tired of My Flesh but my soul feels like
[2:03:16] I'm a million miles high in Heavenly
[2:03:18] places
[2:03:20] hallelujah amen so it's an excuse
[2:03:23] tiredness is an
[2:03:25] excuse if you're tired on Sunday then
[2:03:28] you better relax Saturday don't drive
[2:03:30] all around and go all kind of places and
[2:03:31] run yourself ragged on Saturday rest
[2:03:33] Saturday so you can give God your day
[2:03:36] Sunday that's my advice to the
[2:03:38] church for all those who feel led to do
[2:03:42] what brother Bram said and attend every
[2:03:44] service like I said there's different
[2:03:46] reasons talk to me you know there's
[2:03:47] different reasons sure well we'll talk
[2:03:49] about it but the Bible said we must
[2:03:52] gather more brother ra said I just read
[2:03:53] it must gather more as we see that day
[2:03:56] approaching if you're not doing it now
[2:03:57] when you gonna do it when's your plan to
[2:03:59] do it let's make a plan to do it by
[2:04:00] God's grace well say just don't talk
[2:04:02] about it if it's something good do
[2:04:05] it Hallelujah everybody love the
[2:04:09] Lord and people just say there's not
[2:04:11] enough time well how much time do you
[2:04:12] spend on your phone that could be time
[2:04:15] could be redeemed
[2:04:16] right there's a there's a way you can go
[2:04:19] on your phone and figure out how much
[2:04:19] time you spend on those apps did you
[2:04:21] know that we should do that we should do
[2:04:24] that one time during service let's
[2:04:25] examine ourselves and see whether we're
[2:04:27] good managers of our
[2:04:29] time or if you know it's going to be a
[2:04:31] special weekend rest during the week if
[2:04:33] you possibly can I know the enemy comes
[2:04:36] in like a flood but then you if he comes
[2:04:37] in tired then just rest try to rest up
[2:04:40] as much you can and come to God's house
[2:04:42] and give him
[2:04:43] praise give him praise how do you know
[2:04:45] that's not the service where God's going
[2:04:46] to pour out the blessing I've been
[2:04:48] healed twice instantly in church brother
[2:04:50] Austin twice instantly I was healed
[2:04:54] Glory what if I would have said I'm too
[2:04:56] tired to go to church that day I have
[2:04:58] missed out on the healing how many
[2:04:59] people have I seen healed in Services
[2:05:01] well that' probably go into like few
[2:05:03] dozen just because they came to God's
[2:05:06] house amen and what about the wisdom
[2:05:09] that you receive in
[2:05:10] Services just to live your life and make
[2:05:13] this decision do this instead don't do
[2:05:15] that follow God's Will and worship feel
[2:05:19] close to God when do you feel that any
[2:05:21] other place yeah in your prayer closet
[2:05:22] but what other time throughout the week
[2:05:24] it's time to go to God's house it's time
[2:05:27] to do
[2:05:28] that
[2:05:30] now let me go through a few more and now
[2:05:32] I got to give the warnings for those who
[2:05:33] do
[2:05:35] attend oh here's another one we got to
[2:05:38] be careful here's a warning the leot
[2:05:40] toan spirit is the spirit of I have need
[2:05:43] of nothing how many you know that the
[2:05:44] rich increas in blind and have need of
[2:05:46] nothing so the attitude of Le is I have
[2:05:49] enough of God I don't need any more of
[2:05:50] God I don't need any more church
[2:05:52] services because I have enough that's
[2:05:53] the attitude of Le
[2:05:55] oia so I want to stay a million miles
[2:05:58] away from
[2:05:59] that praise
[2:06:02] God sometimes church we ought look at
[2:06:04] ourselves and we all we ask some of
[2:06:06] these Saints who been around longer even
[2:06:09] when I was growing up in Pentecostal we
[2:06:11] would have uh we would have Revival
[2:06:13] Services Monday through
[2:06:15] Sunday every night I've never done that
[2:06:17] the most I've done is Wednesday Sunday
[2:06:19] so I'm like two days
[2:06:22] behind that was in P that was in
[2:06:25] denomination they were trying to get
[2:06:26] closer to God what about us now how many
[2:06:29] would come if I called a Revival for a
[2:06:31] whole week how many well I don't
[2:06:34] know but brother Bram said you ought to
[2:06:36] have a when those doors are open you
[2:06:37] ought to H if you're born again you
[2:06:39] can't wait for those that door to open
[2:06:42] that's a prophet of
[2:06:43] God
[2:06:45] Amen another thing Jesus said this is
[2:06:49] the House of Prayer so the warning is if
[2:06:51] you don't come to church you're probably
[2:06:52] going to pray
[2:06:54] less amen if you if you can come to
[2:06:57] church but rather live stream when you
[2:07:00] could come to church there's danger in
[2:07:02] that too you got to be careful in that
[2:07:03] there's warnings for that because at
[2:07:05] home it's a lot easier to get distracted
[2:07:06] from the
[2:07:08] word I I I I don't like live streaming
[2:07:10] at all I get distracted too much I just
[2:07:13] can't sit there and stare at the
[2:07:14] computer screen I got I I feel like I
[2:07:16] got to do something that's why that's
[2:07:17] another reason why I love to come to
[2:07:18] church so much
[2:07:19] it keeps my attention praise God I know
[2:07:21] there's jobs at home there's there's
[2:07:23] spirits that are try to battle me you
[2:07:24] know different things like that you got
[2:07:25] to working this and work and do that
[2:07:27] gota do that I love coming to the house
[2:07:28] of God because God takes up all my
[2:07:30] thinking he takes up all my attention we
[2:07:33] got to give him all of our attention
[2:07:35] praise
[2:07:39] God
[2:07:41] now brother BR said it's a dishonor to
[2:07:44] not come to church on Sunday morning or
[2:07:46] Sunday because you dishonor the
[2:07:47] resurrection
[2:07:49] so actually dishonor God say I'm not
[2:07:51] coming on the Resurrection Day it's a
[2:07:53] dishonor to Christ brother said and
[2:07:55] brother BR said uh he said I'm not man
[2:07:58] said I'm not a legalist brother BR about
[2:07:59] church service brother BR said you ought
[2:08:01] to be a legalist for a while about
[2:08:02] church
[2:08:03] service until you really fall in love
[2:08:06] with God is what he's saying you ought
[2:08:08] to have a legalistic attitude well I
[2:08:09] gotta be there gotta be there gotta be
[2:08:11] there you ought to have that attitude
[2:08:12] until you develop the right habits and
[2:08:15] the real love for
[2:08:17] God
[2:08:21] amen here's one my wife was listening to
[2:08:24] the radio and heard a man uh just and it
[2:08:26] tied in too because he was talking about
[2:08:28] church attendance and brother Jose might
[2:08:31] know this too and other sister beatric
[2:08:33] in other countries where there's
[2:08:35] persecution it is life or death when
[2:08:38] they go to church sometimes some of them
[2:08:40] are risking their lives to go to church
[2:08:42] right because of government persecution
[2:08:44] or Muslims or something like that
[2:08:46] violent Muslims you understand what I'm
[2:08:48] saying
[2:08:49] they would they risk their lives to go
[2:08:50] to church and church becomes so so
[2:08:53] optional for us don't feel like going I
[2:08:56] don't feel like traveling I don't feel
[2:08:57] like going there I don't feel like
[2:08:58] getting dressed I don't feel like I need
[2:09:00] to go I'm too
[2:09:01] tired and we get so sometimes I'll say
[2:09:04] like this don't the people get
[2:09:06] spoiled is that right sometimes we got
[2:09:09] so good over here we get lazy on God
[2:09:12] when people in other countries are they
[2:09:14] know they might die if they go to church
[2:09:16] one night because it's life or death
[2:09:18] they'll risk life or death remember
[2:09:20] brother Clement and brother Keith Randol
[2:09:22] from Columbus they went to Pakistan a
[2:09:24] few years ago and they their church was
[2:09:26] right next door in a house that had a
[2:09:28] big room it was right next door to some
[2:09:30] violent Muslims that killed Christians
[2:09:32] they're known for killing Christians but
[2:09:33] they still had church right next door
[2:09:35] but they whispered and they s and they
[2:09:38] God's presence still fell they said
[2:09:40] people got saved and baptized and
[2:09:42] they're Whispering oh they believe oh
[2:09:46] they believe all things are possible and
[2:09:49] God honors Whispering Pakistani
[2:09:52] Christians and helps them win souls and
[2:09:55] get people Sav and they have Miracles
[2:09:57] and healings when they're willing to put
[2:09:59] their lives on the line to go to church
[2:10:01] we need rugged Faith Like
[2:10:03] That amen we need some uh Christians
[2:10:07] with faith like that to care so much
[2:10:10] about God's house you'll put your life
[2:10:12] on the line to do it amen
[2:10:17] Church
[2:10:18] so we must we must come to God's house
[2:10:22] remember brother uh brother Dale preach
[2:10:26] this uh brother R said when you got the
[2:10:28] Holy Ghost you're in the word all the
[2:10:29] way you're in the things of God all the
[2:10:31] way well is it a Sunday night service in
[2:10:33] the plans of God isn't that a part of
[2:10:35] the plans of God well if you got the
[2:10:37] Holy Ghost you want to be a part of all
[2:10:39] the things of God even on a Wednesday
[2:10:42] night praise God see I'm applying that
[2:10:45] to anything that's about God anything
[2:10:47] that's about the the message of the hour
[2:10:49] you want to be a part of it because
[2:10:50] you're born
[2:10:51] again and you love all the things of
[2:10:55] God praise the Lord that's exactly right
[2:11:02] church and ultimately no matter how much
[2:11:05] you might say it when you don't
[2:11:06] fellowship with Believers you become
[2:11:08] disconnected to the body and you become
[2:11:10] connected to other things and most of
[2:11:12] the time it ain't right things most of
[2:11:15] the time for most people it's work and
[2:11:17] money right for others it's
[2:11:19] relationships and temptations and things
[2:11:21] like that or worldly lust and pleasures
[2:11:24] and and pleasure seekers in Hollywood
[2:11:26] and internet but if you're not connected
[2:11:28] here you're going to get connected to
[2:11:30] something else amen it's very very
[2:11:33] challenging there's something about
[2:11:35] physically Gathering when Paul wrote
[2:11:37] that in Hebrews 10 there was no internet
[2:11:38] right there's no phone hook up there's
[2:11:41] nothing there's no live stream it was a
[2:11:43] physical meeting with God and God's
[2:11:46] people it was appearing before God
[2:11:48] Almighty amen
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:53] amen praise the Lord I want to say this
[2:11:56] I said this last Sunday I'm sorry I said
[2:11:58] this last Wednesday night if you've got
[2:12:00] children in sports and things like that
[2:12:02] you should never miss church for that I
[2:12:04] said this last Wednesday
[2:12:06] night look at said look at me as example
[2:12:09] my son and I do Taekwondo we get to wear
[2:12:11] holy clothes they look holy at least our
[2:12:15] practices are on Tuesday and Thursday
[2:12:16] night we never church for our extra
[2:12:19] extracurricular events ever never and we
[2:12:22] always pray don't we Malachi before we
[2:12:24] go into practice that's my example to
[2:12:27] you praise
[2:12:30] God and there's many times I skip
[2:12:32] Taekwondo to help out God's people on
[2:12:35] Tuesday nights and Thursday nights
[2:12:37] because it's not it's just exercise for
[2:12:39] me it's also a mission field I try to
[2:12:41] witness invite people to church I've
[2:12:42] invited people they haven't come yet but
[2:12:44] they said they would but they don't but
[2:12:45] it's a mission field for me too but I
[2:12:47] need to keep take care of my body
[2:12:48] because there's there's a little profit
[2:12:50] in exercising a little I I want that
[2:12:52] little by God's
[2:12:53] grace so I want to make sure I say that
[2:12:57] birthday parties are not more important
[2:12:58] than God's house praise God Sports
[2:13:03] Taekwondo football you name it none of
[2:13:06] those things are more important than
[2:13:07] God's house show me where brother
[2:13:09] Brandon did that and I'll take back all
[2:13:11] this I'll take this preaching back but
[2:13:13] brother Bram always went to two Services
[2:13:15] right every Sunday that's what the
[2:13:17] church did
[2:13:19] and you got the faith of brother Bram
[2:13:20] let's live like it by God's grace
[2:13:24] amen now let me give a warning to us
[2:13:26] that do come uh Ecclesiastes let's go
[2:13:35] here Ecclesiastes
[2:13:38] [Music]
[2:13:39] chapter
[2:13:42] five here's the danger for us or for
[2:13:45] those who come to every service here's
[2:13:47] the danger
[2:13:49] eclesiastes 5 vers1 keep thy foot when
[2:13:52] thou goest to the house of God and be
[2:13:54] more ready to hear than to give the
[2:13:57] sacrifice of
[2:13:58] fools for they consider not that they do
[2:14:01] evil all right did you catch that keep
[2:14:04] your foot so don't stumble when you come
[2:14:06] to God's house and this is spiritually
[2:14:08] you see that you must be ready to hear
[2:14:12] and not just give a sacrifice and say
[2:14:14] well I came to church I'm better than
[2:14:15] the live streamers or I'm better than
[2:14:17] anyone that skip church tonight no that
[2:14:20] that's just that's being that's giv a
[2:14:21] sacrifice as a
[2:14:23] fool we come to church ready to hear
[2:14:26] God's word how many can say Amen to
[2:14:28] that and we come here to consider that
[2:14:32] we've done evil sometime this week we
[2:14:35] don't come thinking well I'm holier than
[2:14:36] everybody bless God I'm the pastor I'm
[2:14:38] better than everybody no we come here
[2:14:40] humble praise God become here humble
[2:14:43] ready to be corrected ready to remember
[2:14:45] that we sin too and we need God help
[2:14:48] every
[2:14:50] hour so see there's a self-righteous
[2:14:53] warning uh or Spirit we got to overcome
[2:14:55] when we come to God's house remember
[2:14:57] brother brand said he got a critical
[2:14:58] spirit and he went to church every time
[2:15:00] he preached hundreds of sermons a year
[2:15:03] and he developed the critical spirit see
[2:15:05] you can go to church and develop the
[2:15:07] wrong spirit so we must keep the right
[2:15:09] spirit and I've been guilty of this I'm
[2:15:11] going to repent of this too I've been
[2:15:12] guilty of being discouraged on Sunday
[2:15:14] nights when people don't show up for
[2:15:15] Wednesday night I've been guilty of that
[2:15:16] instead I should just Rejoice for the
[2:15:18] people that are here right because we
[2:15:21] get to get closer to God or those who
[2:15:23] are live streaming and are really
[2:15:24] pulling and really focusing on the word
[2:15:26] of God we get to get closer to God we
[2:15:28] can't force people to come we can take
[2:15:30] the horse to the water but can't make
[2:15:32] them drink but if we're here we can
[2:15:34] drink praise God so I've been guilty of
[2:15:36] having a pitiful attitude or feeling Sor
[2:15:39] for myself I should stop feeling sorry
[2:15:41] for myself and be thankful and be
[2:15:43] grateful that I can hear God's word I
[2:15:45] can preach God's word I can live God's
[2:15:48] word and God loves me and I love him
[2:15:50] amen I can express my love to him in his
[2:15:54] house I'm trying to close here pardon
[2:15:58] me so that's a warning for those of us
[2:16:00] who do came I just read that scripture
[2:16:02] recently in my prayer or my uh devotion
[2:16:04] time I thought well I think the church
[2:16:06] would like to read that one don't give a
[2:16:08] sacrifice of fools the Bible said
[2:16:10] remember Jesus said when you come to
[2:16:12] church don't give your offering if you
[2:16:14] know someone sinned against you or you
[2:16:15] sin against somebody that's a sacri of
[2:16:18] fools you give an offering and you know
[2:16:19] you got sin in your life you haven't
[2:16:21] taken care of that's a foolish offering
[2:16:24] you shouldn't come to church like that
[2:16:25] we should come to church with pure
[2:16:27] hearts praise God
[2:16:32] Amen and we must not make Church a
[2:16:35] tradition of men because if we do then
[2:16:37] we take out the leadership of the Holy
[2:16:38] Ghost I've been preaching on that lately
[2:16:40] and the Deeds of the nickol adans come
[2:16:42] in just their deeds and then pretty soon
[2:16:44] then it becomes a Doctrine and then the
[2:16:45] Antichrist spirit is here and there's no
[2:16:47] real heartfelt love of God here we need
[2:16:50] the love of God in this house don't we
[2:16:53] Church the Zeal of thine house has eaten
[2:16:55] me up why is it eat you up Jesus because
[2:16:58] there's sin in God's house and I've got
[2:17:00] Zeal to kick out the sin I got a Zeal to
[2:17:03] purify the house of God let's stand on
[2:17:05] our feet by God's
[2:17:10] grace brother Braham said a great burden
[2:17:14] of the last age is the pressure of
[2:17:16] riches soft living and nervous tensions
[2:17:19] those are the three things we battle
[2:17:22] soft living so see you got to be a
[2:17:24] remember brother Daniel preach it
[2:17:26] remember from we had a brother from
[2:17:27] Ghana last Wednesday night preach
[2:17:29] brother Daniel I forget his last name he
[2:17:31] was from Ghana brother Samuel brownie
[2:17:33] brought him down it was a special uh
[2:17:35] thing here I forgot to I apologize I
[2:17:37] forgot to let the church know he's from
[2:17:38] G and he preached on the assessment of
[2:17:41] the oil and I was just getting ready to
[2:17:43] preach on the Holy Ghost and here God
[2:17:45] sends a man all the way from God to
[2:17:47] preach on getting ready to be tested for
[2:17:49] oil I thought Hallelujah God is in this
[2:17:51] place I don't care what anybody says God
[2:17:53] is in this place
[2:17:55] amen but
[2:17:57] see he preached about brother R said a
[2:18:00] Christian's rugged you don't have to
[2:18:02] Baby them or beg them to come to church
[2:18:04] because it's in their heart to come to
[2:18:07] church so Satan wants us to live soft
[2:18:10] easy lives but God's people will labor
[2:18:13] for the kingdom of God they're rugged
[2:18:16] they know how to fight praise God they
[2:18:19] know how to cast down tiredness they
[2:18:21] know how to cast down fears they know I
[2:18:23] say like this they know how to get in
[2:18:24] the spirit amen that's it right there
[2:18:26] they know how to get the spirit amen get
[2:18:29] out of the human spirit and get into
[2:18:31] Christ spirit
[2:18:32] amen hallelujah
[2:18:34] Church
[2:18:36] Glory thank you
[2:18:39] Jesus you have a pressure to be rich but
[2:18:42] you got to overcome
[2:18:44] that don't ever let work or money become
[2:18:47] more important than God's house I plead
[2:18:50] with everybody live streaming here don't
[2:18:52] let money and work get you far from God
[2:18:55] cast that down and watch God provide for
[2:18:58] you stop worrying about it stop focusing
[2:19:00] on it put God first honor God and have
[2:19:03] the right spirit and repent before God
[2:19:06] and watch God provide every need I'm a
[2:19:09] witness
[2:19:11] amen I'm a witness I made this church my
[2:19:14] life I pour my heart and soul in this I
[2:19:16] pour myself so much in this lose my
[2:19:17] voice my hands bleed from clapping so
[2:19:20] much I pour my heart and soul into this
[2:19:22] church by God's grace and God has always
[2:19:24] provided for
[2:19:26] me and he can't treat me any better than
[2:19:29] he treats you because God is not a
[2:19:31] respector of preachers God's not a
[2:19:33] respector of any person amen God loves
[2:19:36] all his children yes
[2:19:39] amen praise God I think that's it let me
[2:19:42] stop right there because it's already
[2:19:43] 9:07 are you happy to be in the house of
[2:19:45] the Lord tonight amen this is all amen
[2:19:48] let's give Round of Applause praise God
[2:19:50] I know we heard
[2:19:52] before I know we heard some of these
[2:19:54] things before church but we're getting
[2:19:56] at a spot where it's coming down to the
[2:19:58] end we know
[2:19:59] it and we got to show which side we're
[2:20:01] standing on by God's grace there's so
[2:20:04] many things we missed brother said
[2:20:06] always stay in the blessings always stay
[2:20:07] where the spirit of God's being poured
[2:20:09] out when people don't come to Wednesday
[2:20:11] and they could or they don't stream when
[2:20:12] they could or they don't come to Sunday
[2:20:14] night when they really could they're
[2:20:16] missing out the pouring of the spirit
[2:20:18] upon them to live a closer life to
[2:20:20] Christ brother Bram said this he said uh
[2:20:24] well I I don't have to go to church I'll
[2:20:26] be just as fine if I don't and brother
[2:20:27] man said you cannot he said if you miss
[2:20:30] church you cannot be a good of a
[2:20:32] Christian as you would be if you went to
[2:20:35] church praise God it's impossible
[2:20:38] because you miss the word of God the
[2:20:40] spirit of God the justice of God the
[2:20:43] love of God you miss all of God because
[2:20:46] God's in his word amen that when you
[2:20:49] really could be there and you don't come
[2:20:52] and there's excuse and Excuse excuse and
[2:20:54] so forth like that you cannot be as
[2:20:57] close to Christ skipping or missing on
[2:21:00] purpose than you could if you just came
[2:21:02] let's bow our heads
[2:21:06] here Sunday Lord willing I'll share a
[2:21:08] little complex I had because I know it's
[2:21:09] going late I'll share a little complex I
[2:21:12] had I also share one of brother
[2:21:13] Brandon's complexes that uh he had to
[2:21:16] keep working on
[2:21:18] sometimes God allows the complex to come
[2:21:20] back and you've got to keep working on
[2:21:23] it but church as we bow our
[2:21:27] heads I encourage us let's get closer to
[2:21:31] Christ God delighted more in Zion than
[2:21:34] all or the gates of Zion than all the
[2:21:37] other property in Judah showing that God
[2:21:39] Delights the
[2:21:42] worship he loves the worship that he
[2:21:44] receives more than any other place and
[2:21:47] and that place is in Christ the baptism
[2:21:49] of the Holy Ghost it's true you can live
[2:21:51] stream and be so focused and God can
[2:21:53] Bless you that's true no no doubt about
[2:21:56] that but we're talking about people that
[2:21:58] don't come when they really
[2:22:01] could that maybe don't have maybe the
[2:22:04] wisdom yet to to to direct their lives
[2:22:07] and Order their lives the right way so
[2:22:09] they can have enough strength to be in
[2:22:11] church when they really
[2:22:14] could and a prophet that says every
[2:22:17] service be anxious to pray be anxious to
[2:22:20] fast be anxious to do anything anyone
[2:22:23] would ask you to
[2:22:24] do in a Bible that says you should
[2:22:27] gather more as the Rapture is
[2:22:29] approaching not less we should be
[2:22:31] physically together more as we see that
[2:22:32] day approaching how God loves when his
[2:22:34] people gather together dear Lord thank
[2:22:37] you for tonight thank you Lord that your
[2:22:38] people have gathered in this holy place
[2:22:42] because your holy spirit's here I've not
[2:22:44] preached my word I've preached the words
[2:22:46] of the Bible I preach the words of your
[2:22:49] Prophet so Lord I pray you just come
[2:22:50] vindicate your word Lord in our lives as
[2:22:53] I sent that email may we examine our
[2:22:55] hearts may we examine our motives and
[2:22:57] our objectives may we examine what's
[2:22:59] most important may we look at our lives
[2:23:02] compared to brother brandom compare it
[2:23:03] to the
[2:23:04] Bible are we truly living the revelation
[2:23:08] of church attendance and Gathering not
[2:23:11] forsaking or abandoning the Saints Lord
[2:23:14] help us to examine Our Lives Lord God
[2:23:18] this is a sermon that pastors or oxes
[2:23:21] have to sometimes have to preach because
[2:23:23] they're there the whole time they can't
[2:23:26] get up and leave they've got to stay
[2:23:27] there they got to labor for the people
[2:23:29] they got to pray for the people they got
[2:23:31] to love the people and Lord you know my
[2:23:33] heart I love the people I love these
[2:23:35] people more than anybody else because I
[2:23:37] sacrifice all my free time to give to
[2:23:40] these people and Lord I trust I believe
[2:23:43] many of them love me dear God Lord help
[2:23:46] us to love you though most of all Lord
[2:23:49] but as your Prophet said we can only see
[2:23:52] uh our love for God by how we love
[2:23:54] others so Lord if I do love them and if
[2:23:56] they do love me then surely we love you
[2:23:58] dear God thank you Lord Jesus for that
[2:24:01] promise bless us now Lord help us to
[2:24:05] fulfill the scripture of gathering more
[2:24:07] as we see that day
[2:24:09] approaching it will take the power of
[2:24:11] God to Humble Hearts it will take the
[2:24:13] power of God maybe to heal
[2:24:15] bodies to change Minds to transform
[2:24:18] thoughts Lord God but that's what the
[2:24:20] word of God is meant to do I pray for
[2:24:22] transformed Minds tonight in Jesus
[2:24:25] Christ's name that our CH Church could
[2:24:26] be United in Christ Jesus we could all
[2:24:29] be in one Accord and in one place dear
[2:24:31] God we could see why some people we
[2:24:33] prayed for haven't been healed Lord we
[2:24:35] need to know that your Prophet said it
[2:24:37] Lord God we need to be a united front
[2:24:41] against the enemy Lord we need to have
[2:24:43] influence with each other to edify one
[2:24:45] another to Pro provoke others to Good
