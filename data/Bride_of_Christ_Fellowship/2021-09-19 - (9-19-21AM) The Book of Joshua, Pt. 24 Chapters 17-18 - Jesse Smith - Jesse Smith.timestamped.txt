[0:34] prayer this morning and
[0:36] just thankful for god's amazing grace
[0:38] i'm just checking
[0:39] a few things here before we get started

[0:44] our memory verse from brother stephen
[0:46] praise god and then we'll have brother

[0:55] pull and enjoy the word and maybe sit
[0:57] through a two and a half hour sermon or
[0:58] something like that we'll see you know
[1:00] we'll see how it goes no i'm just joking
[1:02] uh
[1:03] just kind of funny because you all pull
[1:05] so well that it's easier to preach that
[1:06] long when you pull so well so
[1:08] thank you for pulling on the word of god
[1:10] and just creating such a beautiful
[1:11] atmosphere here
[1:14] we're going to read i did not get to
[1:15] this portion on wednesday i thought i
[1:17] would but the holy spirit seemed to
[1:19] direct me to the other thoughts that we
[1:21] were building
[1:22] upon with possessing all your land if
[1:26] you didn't listen to wednesday i'd
[1:27] encourage you to get a chance uh listen
[1:28] to that
[1:29] uh it just was to me it was just was a
[1:31] wonderful message there as we looked at
[1:33] all the land that you have to conquer
[1:34] praise god and i think i'll review a
[1:36] little bit here today
[1:38] but joshua 17
[1:42] since we read it wednesday i think i'll
[1:44] just go down to
[1:51] verse 16. why don't we just read 17
[1:53] verse 16. i'll just read that just as a
[1:55] brief
[1:56] summary and then we'll read our memory
[1:57] verse if you remember the story from
[1:59] wednesday i'll just brief it uh
[2:01] manasseh
[2:02] says they they're great people they grew
[2:04] by over 12 000 people within a matter of
[2:06] 30 some years and they said we need more
[2:09] land and joshua
[2:11] tells them well go go clear the land we
[2:12] gave you
[2:13] they were asking for another lot right
[2:16] but joshua says go clear and then they
[2:18] start making excuses
[2:20] look at verse 16 16 shows their excuses
[2:23] but then after that joshua encourages
[2:24] them
[2:26] you can do it praise god see when we
[2:28] when we make excuses god's going to say
[2:30] you can do it
[2:31] just forget your excuses just remember
[2:33] the power of god
[2:34] so that's why that's why this is such a
[2:36] great lesson praise god verse 16.
[2:39] uh and the children of joseph said the
[2:40] hill is not enough for us and all the
[2:42] canaanites that dwell in the land of the
[2:44] valley have chariots of iron well they
[2:46] who are bethleh i'm sorry are beth
[2:49] sheehan and her towns and they who are
[2:51] of the valley of jezreel
[2:54] all right let's go to philippians 2
[2:56] verses 2 and 3. this is our memory verse
[2:58] thank you both stephen appreciate that
[2:59] brother just a beautiful
[3:01] portion of scripture here
[3:03] how we can love one another
[3:06] and that's what we're known for right
[3:08] we're known for the love we have one for
[3:09] another
[3:10] praise god philippians 2 verses 2 and 3.
[3:17] let's read verses two and three ready
[3:19] one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye
[3:23] be like-minded having the same love
[3:26] being of one accord of one mind let
[3:30] nothing be done through strife or vain
[3:32] glory but in loneliness of mind let each
[3:36] esteem other better than themselves amen
[3:40] let's buy our heads brother william if
[3:41] you would just pray for the word brother
[3:42] and ask the holy spirit to have his way
[3:44] today
[3:46] but i would thank you for this beautiful
[3:48] morning yes jesus thank you god
[3:50] come to your house to stand with me yes
[3:53] lord
[3:56] hallelujah
[4:09] hallelujah father we are looking at you
[4:23] amen amen praise god thank you brother
[4:25] you god bless you all you may be seated
[4:27] by god's grace
[4:33] all right so i have some slides here
[4:34] we'll look at uh lord willing we'll try
[4:36] to get through chapter 17 and 18 and of
[4:38] course i'm not reading every verse
[4:40] because as you've seen with some of
[4:41] these chapters they go through the
[4:43] details of the borders and i don't i
[4:45] don't feel be a a good use of time to go
[4:47] through all the details you know from
[4:48] this stone to that stone into that river
[4:50] and that hill and i feel be better to
[4:52] give the spiritual application of some
[4:54] of these things uh so we've been working
[4:57] on that by the grace of the lord and i
[4:58] trust that's been a blessing to you
[5:01] uh so
[5:02] let's look at chapter 17 and 18
[5:05] today
[5:07] now we read our text here our text is
[5:09] joshua 17
[5:11] verses 13 to 18. so i'm going to turn
[5:14] back there
[5:16] and you're familiar as i mentioned on
[5:18] wednesday lord willing listening to the
[5:20] service got a chance to listen to that
[5:23] i'll just go ahead and read it you know
[5:24] i might as well read it now since we're
[5:25] starting here
[5:28] verse
[5:28] 13 and chapter 17.
[5:32] yet it came to pass when the children of
[5:33] israel were waxing strong that they put
[5:36] the canaanites to tribute but did not
[5:38] utterly drive them out now look at that
[5:40] they're strong
[5:41] but they just had a little compromise
[5:44] they couldn't drive them out now there
[5:46] could have been different reasons right
[5:48] maybe they were lukewarm maybe they were
[5:50] in their minds right
[5:51] right
[5:52] maybe they were just tired of war
[5:55] but they were strong they were waxing
[5:56] strong and they chose not to drive
[5:58] certain enemies out
[6:00] but i believe they did it as a type
[6:02] there was of course other natural
[6:03] reasons but as a spiritual type it shows
[6:05] us we won't drive out all the sin nature
[6:08] until we get a new body
[6:10] praise god and we saw that on wednesday
[6:12] when malachi read that out of romans 8
[6:14] 23 let's read it anyway romans 8 23
[6:16] since we're just starting out here
[6:18] uh
[6:19] church when you are born again you have
[6:21] the spirit of adoption amen you can say
[6:25] i'm in adoption
[6:27] because i've got the spirit and it cries
[6:30] out not old pastor o pastor doesn't cry
[6:33] oh mama oh mama
[6:34] it cries out father father abba father
[6:37] amen
[6:38] don't cry oh brother brandon oh brother
[6:40] branham
[6:41] they don't cry oh martin luther oh
[6:42] martin luther you see the ridiculousness
[6:44] of this
[6:45] when you got the holy ghost it looks to
[6:47] one person jesus christ amen amen
[6:51] because it cries out abba father amen
[6:54] it's a prayer to your heavenly father
[6:56] amen it's a connection to papa god when
[6:59] you're born again amen you are adopted
[7:03] into his family with a position and a
[7:05] purpose praise god but romans 8 23 is
[7:09] malachi read it to us
[7:11] uh i'm sorry
[7:12] i'm in yeah i'm in chapter
[7:14] seven so 8 23
[7:16] and not only they but ourselves also
[7:18] which have the first fruits of the
[7:20] spirit see when you're born again you
[7:21] have a first measure but there's more
[7:23] holy ghosts to come especially when you
[7:25] get those two new bodies amen theophany
[7:27] and glorified amen even we ourselves
[7:31] grow within ourselves waiting for the
[7:32] adoption to with the redemption of our
[7:34] body so now verse 15 says we've received
[7:38] the spirit of adoption so you have the
[7:39] spirit of it it's a first fruit it's a
[7:42] down payment on the rest that's going to
[7:45] come praise god you have the spirit you
[7:47] are adopted the family of god the rest
[7:49] is coming your adoption finishes when
[7:52] you get a new body
[7:54] to it means that is
[7:56] right so it means that is the redemption
[7:58] of our body
[7:59] adoption finishes when you get a new
[8:01] body and there's no more sin nature and
[8:03] you praise god there's no more falling
[8:06] in sin amen there's no more falling in
[8:08] disgrace or discouragement there's no
[8:10] more guilt there's no more uh a failure
[8:13] feeling you are completely whole you are
[8:16] just like christ amen
[8:19] the bible said when you see him you'll
[8:21] be like him amen
[8:22] hallelujah praise god but church we're
[8:25] adopted now praise god that's why you
[8:28] mothers if you're doctor with the holy
[8:29] ghost you can pray for those children
[8:31] command those demons to leave and they
[8:32] must obey amen amen unless it's god's
[8:35] will to prolong it right unless it's
[8:36] god's will right because we can't do
[8:37] anything of our own selves it's got to
[8:39] be god's will some of you brothers and
[8:40] you husbands you can pray the prayer of
[8:42] faith and you know god's going to answer
[8:44] because you're adopted in the kingdom of
[8:46] god amen
[8:48] hallelujah you have the spirit of
[8:50] adoption praise god
[8:52] hallelujah so we thank the lord for that
[8:54] now this is part of the adoption process
[8:56] we have the spirit of adoption
[8:59] now verse 14 and the children of joseph
[9:01] spain yeah joseph speaking to joshua
[9:02] saying why hast thou given me but one
[9:04] lot and one portion to inherit seeing
[9:06] i'm a great people for as much as the
[9:08] lord hath blessed me hitherto
[9:11] why you give me one lot when i'm so big
[9:13] and so great does that sound like a good
[9:15] question
[9:16] i'm so big and great why would you uh
[9:19] why would you give me this small portion
[9:21] now i'm going to skip ahead because i i
[9:23] i outlined all this here
[9:26] i'm going to skip ahead
[9:28] he said i'm so great why would you give
[9:29] me such a small portion of land in other
[9:32] words i need more joshua
[9:35] you haven't maybe done it the right way
[9:36] now look at this attitude towards the
[9:38] prophet of god
[9:39] i need another one
[9:41] now look at verse we read there 14. now
[9:43] notice his question seems legitimate
[9:46] because in one way they'd increased by
[9:48] 12 200. so if you you know we don't have
[9:51] time now but if i read this morning if
[9:53] you read your bible numbers 133 when
[9:55] they come out of the exodus and then at
[9:56] the end of numbers right before moses
[9:59] dies they had 52 700. so this was a
[10:02] pretty good increase for 38 years
[10:04] 12 500 this people was a blessed people
[10:07] they were a great people and so now he
[10:10] makes they're making the case we need
[10:11] more land
[10:13] and it also seems now by by what we see
[10:16] later it seems they were seeking favor
[10:18] from joshua who was kind of like their
[10:20] brother
[10:22] their real close brother from their
[10:23] their mother
[10:25] right because the jacob had four
[10:28] uh was it four wives if i'm not mistaken
[10:30] four wives yeah
[10:32] he had four wives leah rachel billa and
[10:36] i can't remember that last one
[10:38] was it
[10:39] zilpah yeah good yeah it's good
[10:42] i'm impressed
[10:44] four four four wives
[10:47] and so it seems like manasseh
[10:50] uh you know they're ephraim's brother
[10:51] from rachel
[10:53] it seems like they're trying to get a
[10:54] little bit of extra help because you
[10:55] know he's from our brother he's from our
[10:57] line he's from rachel he's not from leo
[11:00] or the bond women or anything like that
[11:03] uh
[11:04] but notice joshua like a real man of god
[11:06] doesn't show partiality
[11:09] and which we all we all aim to do right
[11:12] right we all aim to do that we don't and
[11:14] of course we're gonna have friends that
[11:15] are closer than others right like
[11:16] brother ram says we're gonna have some
[11:18] people that are easier to love than
[11:19] others but we don't want to be partial
[11:21] when it comes down to judgment
[11:24] right
[11:25] like well you know you need a home
[11:26] church but you don't need one
[11:29] well you can cut your hair sister but
[11:31] you shouldn't sister
[11:34] you don't give him partial judgments on
[11:36] the word of god
[11:38] and joshua stands strong amen
[11:41] whether it's a friend asking him for
[11:42] help or a brother from his own mother or
[11:45] no matter who it is he stayed true with
[11:47] the word of god
[11:49] now verse 15
[11:51] joshua picks it up and he retorts or
[11:54] corrects their argument look what he
[11:56] says in verse 15. and
[11:57] joshua answered and said if thou be a
[11:59] great people then get up to the wood
[12:01] country
[12:03] if you're so great manasseh go take the
[12:05] land
[12:07] see he's using his words against him
[12:10] i'm a great people i need more land well
[12:12] joshua said if you're so great
[12:14] then just possess what you got
[12:17] you're so great right aren't you so
[12:19] great aren't you you're so elected right
[12:21] brad you're so elected
[12:23] shouldn't you possess the promises or
[12:25] you mean you can't overcome covet you
[12:26] can't overcome a few fears and uh you
[12:29] you need more of something else no we've
[12:31] got exactly what we need christ has
[12:33] given us every spiritual blessing in
[12:35] christ jesus amen see they're
[12:38] complaining oh we're so great we're so
[12:41] holy yeah but we need more he says first
[12:43] possess what you got if you're so great
[12:47] amen this is one of those beautiful
[12:49] thoughts i was telling you about
[12:51] uh we're finally getting to this one
[12:53] see he uses their own description
[12:56] as a reason they need to cut down the
[12:58] trees themselves
[13:00] right
[13:01] and he mentions the giant see oh yeah
[13:03] this is the land of the giants too with
[13:05] all these trees so it's hard work giants
[13:08] and all these things great people should
[13:10] be able to do
[13:11] great people can cut down trees can't
[13:13] they
[13:14] this is before we had the
[13:15] machines we got today right
[13:17] chainsaws
[13:19] but a great people should be able to
[13:20] handle some you know some trees and some
[13:22] giants right
[13:23] so joshua corrects them by the holy
[13:26] spirit he picks up their deceptiveness
[13:28] in here
[13:31] now verse 16 and the children of joseph
[13:33] said the hill is not enough for us oh
[13:35] see again they go back to oh it's not
[13:37] enough
[13:39] and all the canaanites oh now we get now
[13:41] here we get to the real reason it wasn't
[13:43] the fact that there's trees there
[13:45] anybody can cut down a tree
[13:49] and all the canaanites that dwell on the
[13:52] land of the valley have chariots of iron
[13:56] oh okay okay now i see
[13:59] now i get the picture it's not really
[14:01] about the trees
[14:03] it's about the fact that you're afraid
[14:05] of the enemy
[14:09] if anybody had a
[14:11] a right to be unafraid amen it was
[14:15] joshua's people amen
[14:17] right
[14:18] if anybody had any reason
[14:21] to have great faith it should have been
[14:23] joshua's armies amen
[14:26] but somehow over the course of five or
[14:28] seven years this part this portion of
[14:30] the bride can say like this this portion
[14:32] of the church lost their real strong
[14:35] faith in god's word
[14:37] and now the obstacles look greater
[14:40] than the word of god looks greater to
[14:42] them the chariots of iron look greater
[14:46] uh uh than the promise of god that
[14:49] church how quickly we can forget about
[14:51] the walls of jericho that fell down
[14:54] before us amen
[14:55] like romans said how quickly we can
[14:57] forget that the blood of the lamb
[14:59] brought us out of egypt when we get to
[15:01] the red sea
[15:03] praise god how quickly that's human
[15:05] thinking that's why jesus said abide in
[15:07] me and my words abide in you and then
[15:10] ask what you will and it'll be done for
[15:12] you praise god
[15:14] see we must be careful to keep the word
[15:17] abiding in us and the testimonies
[15:20] abiding on our lips because then we know
[15:22] another battle is coming and it makes us
[15:25] ready for the battle
[15:26] amen
[15:27] rather than making excuses well i'll
[15:29] never possess this uh i i need to go
[15:32] somewhere else i need to go to some
[15:33] other church right that's kind of like
[15:35] that that's kind of like the thing here
[15:36] i need i need to listen to somebody else
[15:38] other than brother branham you know we
[15:39] need somebody else other than brother
[15:41] branham we need another prophet we need
[15:43] an eighth messenger
[15:44] oh this is nonsense praise god see how
[15:47] they make excuses they don't possess
[15:49] what god's already given to them for
[15:51] fear of fights and for fear of obstacles
[15:55] church where there's no fear in the army
[15:57] of god there's only perfect love amen
[16:01] hallelujah and that drives out all fear
[16:04] amen
[16:06] oh thank god amen
[16:08] so in the second complaint we get the
[16:10] real reason
[16:12] right they're afraid of chariots of iron
[16:14] and if you study the history i read the
[16:15] commentary this morning john gill a
[16:17] preacher from the 1800s he said the i
[16:19] the church really weren't made of iron
[16:21] they're made of wood
[16:24] and they just had like iron coverings on
[16:26] the wheels
[16:27] it wasn't even a total iron chariot
[16:30] so so they they created in their minds
[16:32] they created this well this obstacle is
[16:35] bigger than what we actually think it is
[16:36] in church isn't that what we do we make
[16:38] a problem bigger than what it actually
[16:40] is
[16:41] we imagine well if i say something then
[16:43] this is that's going to happen that's
[16:44] all this we create these major huge iron
[16:48] chariots when they're just wood and
[16:50] they'll burn amen
[16:52] and they're easily defeated when god's
[16:54] behind us amen and when the great
[16:56] almighty god is on our side nothing
[16:58] shall stand before him praise god
[17:01] and god already said every place where
[17:03] you put your feet it's yours amen they
[17:06] just had to go there and step on the
[17:09] ground say this is mine in jesus name
[17:13] glory that's what you must do too this
[17:15] is mine in jesus christ's name just
[17:18] approach it just go there just face the
[17:21] issue and deal with it and jesus will
[17:23] deliver you
[17:25] amen
[17:27] hallelujah
[17:30] and it also though proves the great ones
[17:32] among us sometimes lose a little bit of
[17:34] our faith
[17:36] because the anointing in our minds right
[17:40] think of all the testimonies we gave
[17:41] last remember last year everybody gave
[17:42] their testimonies now think about the
[17:44] trials you had this year when you felt a
[17:45] little afraid
[17:47] what about all those
[17:48] other great testimonies we had see we're
[17:51] all subject to it
[17:52] and we all need
[17:54] restoration the bible says the bible
[17:56] said we all need a daily reminding we
[17:59] all need a transformed mind that's why
[18:01] your time with god is so critical
[18:04] because that's the time where you'll get
[18:06] transformed and you'll be ready for the
[18:08] next battle
[18:13] see all of us can lose a little bit of
[18:15] faith
[18:16] and give into a little bit of fear
[18:18] i go back and forth on it right i i'm
[18:20] battling fear this year too with all
[18:22] these vaccine mandates and everything
[18:23] like that
[18:25] right losing my job sometimes i'll drive
[18:27] home thinking well if i lose my job i'll
[18:29] go to that place and look for a job and
[18:30] then i'm gonna
[18:32] yeah or maybe i'll just i'll say
[18:34] uh maybe uh can i have the vaccine next
[18:37] week and then i'll empty out my bank
[18:38] accounts and run run to texas with my
[18:40] family or something like that you know
[18:42] it's just you start thinking of things
[18:45] i'm laughing too as a man how do i gotta
[18:47] provide i gotta and see and i and as a
[18:49] man i think i've got control no sir
[18:52] jesus christ has control amen he's the
[18:55] one that opens the door that no man can
[18:57] shout amen he's the man that shuts every
[18:59] door that no man can open amen
[19:02] and i've got to put my faith in him i
[19:04] need a refresher of faith in him i need
[19:07] to get my mind realigned with the word
[19:09] of god amen
[19:12] praise god
[19:13] because fear has no place
[19:15] in the body of christ
[19:20] like this week i heard a sermon
[19:22] uh from a preacher
[19:24] he was a guest preacher
[19:26] and i was listening and i the more i
[19:28] listened the more i got grieved in my
[19:29] spirit
[19:31] and i'm like
[19:33] this is wrong i don't want that church
[19:35] affected by these false doctrines so i
[19:37] sat down and studied and i i in the
[19:39] first hour of the sermon i found seven
[19:41] false doctrines and i said i'm not
[19:43] afraid i'm going to reach out i just
[19:44] shared it right with the pastor
[19:47] because i'm not afraid
[19:49] i am not going to live in fear if i see
[19:52] something wrong then i should call it
[19:54] out praise god
[19:56] because the bible says if you rebuke a
[19:57] wise man he'll love you
[20:00] amen proverbs says that amen you correct
[20:02] the wise person they're going to care
[20:04] about you more amen and if not they are
[20:07] either backslidden they're never born
[20:08] again or they're the seed of the devil
[20:11] but see god corrects all the children
[20:13] amen
[20:14] hallelujah in years past i might have
[20:16] been a little afraid to send that but i
[20:17] was just like send
[20:20] i recorded a 10 minute video or audio
[20:22] and i just sent it out praise god
[20:24] because what have i got to be afraid of
[20:27] and let's say i'm wrong on one of those
[20:28] well and i still corrected the person on
[20:30] six wrongs they had
[20:32] and maybe i had one misunderstanding see
[20:34] that's the holy spirit church the holy
[20:36] spirit is the spirit of truth amen
[20:39] the holy spirit is a spirit of holiness
[20:42] praise god
[20:44] and so i'm learning that these last few
[20:46] years you know debating believe the sign
[20:47] and emailing joseph and billy paul
[20:50] i'm learning this i will not fear any
[20:52] man
[20:53] the man i fear the most is jesus christ
[20:56] that's the only one i'm going to fear
[20:57] praise god
[20:59] and we have to be able to say it like
[21:00] this if everyone leaves us we'll still
[21:02] serve jesus christ
[21:05] so for example if i left the church you
[21:06] still stand for jesus christ if you left
[21:09] the church i'd still stand for jesus
[21:10] christ amen because we're not submitting
[21:13] to man we're submitting to the holy
[21:15] spirit amen
[21:17] hallelujah
[21:20] see how we get in these spirits of fear
[21:22] we've got to be very careful
[21:24] we're all going to experience it right
[21:25] we're all going to feel that come on us
[21:27] but we've got to go to prayer
[21:28] yeah i said god give me the give me the
[21:30] wisdom to approach this situation
[21:32] that's the timing
[21:34] when to do it and how to do it
[21:36] we know the answer is here in the word
[21:37] we know the knowledge is in here right
[21:39] but we need the wisdom of when to do it
[21:41] and how to do it
[21:43] so i waited a week
[21:45] and i got some good good responses and
[21:46] hopefully they'll pray about it and
[21:47] things like that
[21:49] see even great even great giant or
[21:52] sometimes gets more giants
[21:55] hello
[21:57] giant killers these guys are ridiculous
[21:59] but yeah they are afraid of the giants a
[22:02] few years afterwards
[22:06] may god help us to restore our strength
[22:08] when we get discouraged
[22:10] right it doesn't mean we're not longer
[22:11] we're no longer born again it doesn't
[22:13] even mean we're not living in the land
[22:15] praise god we're still baptized with the
[22:17] holy ghost we're still living in a limb
[22:19] but sometimes we get a little afraid of
[22:21] that next giant we haven't seen them
[22:24] before we don't know how they live we
[22:25] don't know all about them and we just if
[22:27] we're not careful we get some carnal
[22:29] thinking and we've got to get that
[22:31] carnal thinking now we've got to wash
[22:33] those thoughts away we've got to let the
[22:35] light of god shine into there shine into
[22:38] the darkness and that will reveal the
[22:39] way to go
[22:43] don't forget church we're only
[22:46] only to be strong and courageous they
[22:49] must have forgotten the simple path to
[22:52] strong to strength
[22:54] right remember this what's the steps of
[22:57] strength corinthians says the way to be
[22:59] strong is to humble yourself and repent
[23:03] you have to start with humility and
[23:05] repentance and realize i don't have the
[23:07] strength and the reason i'm not strong
[23:09] is because i've sinned
[23:12] or i've got this distraction which would
[23:14] be a sin or i've got fearful forgive me
[23:16] my fear lord and now i'm going to
[23:18] remember that you promise you'll be
[23:21] faithful to me you never leave me you
[23:24] never forsake me and no man will stand
[23:26] before me all the days of my life amen
[23:30] and then after that then you just keep
[23:32] all the commands you constantly praise
[23:34] god you meditate upon them just like
[23:37] abraham we have a prayer life
[23:39] for
[23:43] men stood before joshua when aiken
[23:45] failed right those men of ai stood
[23:48] before joshua they got the victory the
[23:49] first time 36 men died now joshua wasn't
[23:52] there but the other men were there but
[23:53] see that's what we must remember yes no
[23:56] man will stand before us as long as we
[23:58] do these things amen
[24:00] does that help by god's grace
[24:02] manasseh had forgotten the simple
[24:04] directions repent remember and then keep
[24:08] praise god
[24:10] repent remember keep the word of god and
[24:13] no one will defeat you all the days of
[24:15] your life
[24:16] i just told you how to be undefeated i
[24:18] should have i should have heard some
[24:19] shouts out there
[24:21] amen
[24:22] hallelujah
[24:24] repent
[24:25] remember that god's with you and keep
[24:28] the word you can't be stopped amen
[24:31] hallelujah there's no devil that can
[24:33] stop you you're strong and courageous
[24:35] amen
[24:37] hallelujah
[24:39] never fail for joshua it ain't going to
[24:40] fail for you
[24:43] can anybody show me where it failed for
[24:44] joshua where this ever failed
[24:46] no as long as he kept this it always
[24:49] succeeded
[24:50] as long as you keep this church the
[24:52] victory's coming to you amen
[24:55] hallelujah
[24:57] oh i love the word of god don't you i'm
[24:59] laughing because i'm happy that's why
[25:00] i'm laughing
[25:02] because i've seen myself get victory all
[25:03] these year after year after year amen
[25:06] that's how i got it praise god
[25:11] verse 16.
[25:13] and all the children of josephus said
[25:15] the hill is not enough for us
[25:17] okay i already yeah i already did that
[25:18] one okay so church what is the lesson
[25:20] now here's the beautiful thought i want
[25:22] to share for the new testament
[25:23] the lesson is you must conquer your land
[25:26] first
[25:27] before seeking other land
[25:31] right
[25:32] stay in your position manasseh was
[25:34] basically saying i want a different
[25:35] position this this position is too hard
[25:37] for me
[25:39] i don't want to deal with some of these
[25:40] things so i need a different position
[25:43] right
[25:44] and a pastor is an excellent example of
[25:46] this
[25:48] right i must conquer the land of my home
[25:51] life
[25:52] before i can even be a pastor here which
[25:54] i already did
[25:55] but i've got to keep those enemies under
[25:57] subjection too
[25:58] right any any spirit that would come up
[26:00] in my house
[26:02] this is what we have we have preachers
[26:04] that go out and preach and then their
[26:05] houses are already in shambles to begin
[26:07] with they should not even be out
[26:09] preaching until they first win the
[26:11] battle at their home
[26:13] they've lost the battle and their own
[26:15] land but they're saying i'm no
[26:17] discontent i'd like to go somewhere else
[26:19] i want to run from the problem so i can
[26:21] go try to help somebody you can't help
[26:23] anybody the bible said you can't lead
[26:25] anybody you can't help anybody and first
[26:28] the holy ghost lives in your home amen
[26:31] you create an atmosphere in your home
[26:33] and now that you're led by the holy
[26:35] ghost there now you can be led by the
[26:36] holy ghost other places amen
[26:39] we got too many preachers that think
[26:40] they're helping people and they're not
[26:42] because they haven't let the holy ghost
[26:44] help them amen
[26:46] disobedient wives disobedient children
[26:48] sin uh child molestation adultery greed
[26:52] millionaires all these things they're
[26:54] all entrenched in sin they haven't even
[26:57] conquered the land god gave them amen
[27:00] and they're begging for more land
[27:02] shame on them
[27:04] hallelujah it's nothing but a manasseh
[27:06] move
[27:07] can i say like that
[27:09] oh glory amen
[27:11] it's nothing but a manasseh move
[27:14] oh give me more i don't like the church
[27:16] where i'm at give me a bigger church i'm
[27:18] very content at a small church
[27:23] power just shows what's in you right
[27:26] like they gave joe biden power it shows
[27:27] the characters in him he's a total liar
[27:30] a demon-possessed liar like kamala
[27:32] harris they're all demon-possessed liars
[27:33] they're murderers the spirit of murder
[27:35] is on them
[27:36] power just manifested what spirits in
[27:39] them glory
[27:40] and church when you get power and you
[27:42] get authority it manifests that the holy
[27:44] ghost the almighty god lives in you
[27:47] praise god
[27:49] amen
[27:50] land and possessions and materials just
[27:53] magnify what's in you like i probably
[27:56] told this before we had someone that
[27:57] used to come to church and i won't let
[27:59] her come back to church
[28:00] so she repents of something i did that
[28:02] with brother brooks so brother brooks
[28:03] was a witness
[28:09] and she had a lie oh and she always
[28:10] surely said well if i had a million
[28:12] dollars you know that was her excuse to
[28:13] use the lottery or play the lottery she
[28:14] said if i had two million dollars i'd
[28:16] give so much to church i said that's
[28:17] nonsense
[28:19] i said you would give whatever
[28:20] percentage you're giving right now
[28:22] which is very little
[28:25] right
[28:26] right
[28:29] you know well one if i had more money
[28:31] i'd be more faithful i'd do more for the
[28:33] kingdom of god no you would do exactly
[28:35] what you're doing now
[28:37] right
[28:39] it just disgusts me
[28:44] about jesus said be faithful little they
[28:46] don't make you
[28:47] amen
[28:49] conquer the land of your life your home
[28:52] your personal relationship with god
[28:53] conquer that land first and then we'll
[28:55] talk about some other things amen
[28:58] but first be faithful with the land that
[28:59] i give you
[29:02] she was trying to tell me this woman was
[29:04] trying to tell me she was in a delusion
[29:07] she was trying to tell me that the
[29:08] nurses around her were her daughters
[29:11] and she never even been married
[29:13] a black woman a white woman and these
[29:15] others racist they're all her daughters
[29:16] i'm like you're insane i said you're
[29:19] crazy
[29:20] and you're not going to bring that lie
[29:22] back to the churches and she said well
[29:23] you prophesied one time and said a
[29:24] baptist preacher is going to come to the
[29:25] church i said i never prophesied i said
[29:27] i was praying for him to come into the
[29:29] church and brother brooks is sitting
[29:30] right there
[29:31] he's my witness i never prophesied that
[29:34] i've never prophesied anything purposely
[29:37] it's just by accident or not my accent
[29:38] but it's by by leading of the lord i've
[29:40] only prophesied or my dreams
[29:42] amen
[29:44] hallelujah but see people want to argue
[29:46] and fuss like that that's fine let them
[29:47] be manasseh you be joshua
[29:50] you be joshua possess your land first
[29:53] amen
[29:54] be faithful with what god gave you first
[29:56] amen amen the bible said i gotta have my
[29:59] children in obedience if they don't obey
[30:01] me i can't be a pastor
[30:03] with all respect dignity and honor if my
[30:05] children don't honor me if they don't
[30:07] respect me i can't be a pastor i got to
[30:09] conquer their hearts first
[30:12] right and when they're born again then
[30:13] that it's all easy after that right but
[30:15] leading up to that you got to get them
[30:16] born again right
[30:18] for if a man doesn't know how to rule
[30:20] the land of his own house how shall he
[30:22] take care of the land of the church of
[30:25] god
[30:26] i didn't hear you
[30:27] yes
[30:28] it's impossible
[30:30] to say oh i deserve god i deserve more
[30:33] when you haven't been faithful with what
[30:34] god gave you first
[30:37] hallelujah
[30:39] how many issues we got with messed up
[30:41] homes
[30:42] right
[30:43] money like we said money women power all
[30:46] those things mixed up in there and
[30:47] they're trying to search for more land
[30:48] when they haven't even got victory over
[30:50] their land first
[30:54] there's two more examples
[30:57] take your land first take your time
[30:59] first if you can conquer your time
[31:02] then god will give you more
[31:04] seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[31:06] then all these things will be added to
[31:07] you so in other words you got to conquer
[31:08] the mourning first
[31:10] i preached on this all the time but it's
[31:11] true jesus prayed first david prayed
[31:14] first all these things if you don't give
[31:15] god the first there's going to be a
[31:16] little bit of hindrance all throughout
[31:18] the day
[31:19] you miss one day you might get a bad
[31:21] habit miss the second day you've got to
[31:23] redeem the time you've got to put christ
[31:25] first
[31:26] he said put me first amen and then
[31:29] everything else all the other land will
[31:30] be added but first conquer the land of
[31:33] communing with me first amen
[31:36] be faithful with your time focus in your
[31:38] life
[31:39] right and then god will add everything
[31:40] else
[31:44] another example jesus said
[31:46] well done good and faithful servant thou
[31:48] hast been faithful over a few things
[31:49] i'll make the ruler over many things so
[31:51] this person died because this is this
[31:53] represents jesus at the judgment throne
[31:55] right when we're all given rewards the
[31:57] judgment seat of christ some sometime
[31:59] around the marriage supper the lamb
[32:01] so this jesus only let this servant
[32:04] have a lit a few things on the earth
[32:08] oh so god didn't increase him and if he
[32:10] was faithful god would always make his
[32:12] church bigger and bigger and bigger not
[32:13] according to jesus
[32:15] that's that's a denominational thought
[32:18] oh if you're a good preacher your church
[32:20] is going to grow show me that in brother
[32:21] brahms ministry
[32:23] show me that in paul's ministry it's not
[32:25] there paul said they have all of asia's
[32:28] rejecting me i only got one coat left
[32:29] amen right at the end of jesus life the
[32:32] 70 had left him right yeah the 70
[32:34] preachers that left him you only had 11
[32:35] or 12 left well one of them was the
[32:37] devil
[32:38] right you just show you show me these
[32:39] things in the word of god it's very hard
[32:41] but that's the denominational spirit
[32:43] that's come upon the people but that's
[32:45] okay i don't want to be organized by man
[32:47] i want to be organized by the holy ghost
[32:50] amen
[32:51] jesus said if you're faithful with
[32:53] little i'll make you ruler over much
[32:57] see so it's possess your land first
[33:00] in other words brother amen be faithful
[33:01] that music gift and i'll reward you
[33:03] later now maybe in this life but maybe
[33:04] not maybe just in the next life
[33:07] right
[33:09] and i can name each of your gifts i see
[33:10] your prayer of faith and your songs
[33:12] singing and everything like that
[33:14] i go to each and every person witnessing
[33:16] uh boldness for witnessing all these
[33:18] things
[33:20] you can show with each and every person
[33:21] be faithful with the little things first
[33:24] and conquer that land first and then
[33:27] your feet will take more steps amen
[33:29] hallelujah if god wants you to take more
[33:31] he'll give you more
[33:34] so there's two examples
[33:36] be conquer your land first
[33:38] then go get other people's land don't
[33:40] make excuses
[33:42] well it's too hard to talk to my husband
[33:43] well it's too hard to talk to my wife
[33:45] it's too hard to train my children
[33:48] it's too hard to turn off the phone the
[33:50] first thing in the morning just get up
[33:51] just get an old-fashioned alarm clock
[33:54] just leave your phone off just try to
[33:56] conquer that one morning right and then
[33:57] the next morning it's easier
[33:59] right
[34:00] you it's your land
[34:02] right you've got to conquer it god's not
[34:04] looking for anybody else to do it god
[34:06] wants you to do it
[34:08] that's why i gave it to you
[34:10] hallelujah number 17-18 joshua reminds
[34:13] manasseh of their greatness and power
[34:17] hallelujah they say i'm so great i need
[34:19] more land joshua says you are great
[34:22] that that was there's some truth to that
[34:24] but you can't brag with that
[34:27] he says
[34:29] thou art a great people and you have
[34:31] great power
[34:34] he said thou shalt not have one lie only
[34:37] but look what he says
[34:39] but the mountain shall be dying
[34:43] so the lot they always wanted brother
[34:44] william
[34:46] was theirs the whole time
[34:48] hallelujah in other words the victories
[34:50] you wanted all this time they're already
[34:52] laying right there in your lap
[34:54] [Music]
[34:56] what you were longing for all these
[34:57] things they're not out there they're
[34:59] right here praise god he says yes i'm
[35:03] going to give you another lot it's a lot
[35:05] that you've been unfaithful with amen
[35:07] hallelujah church amen see when god
[35:09] gives you a new life if god gives you
[35:11] new strength or new power it's to
[35:13] possess what already belongs to you amen
[35:16] be faithful with your land you have now
[35:19] and then see if god wants to give you
[35:20] more
[35:25] but look at joshua he says you you're
[35:27] great
[35:29] you have power
[35:30] you'll have more than one lot but it's
[35:32] your mountain lot you got to get
[35:35] for it is wood
[35:37] and thou shalt cut it down and the
[35:39] outgoings of it shall be thine for thou
[35:41] shalt look he's prophesied
[35:44] you will drive out the canaanites though
[35:46] they have iron chairs and though they be
[35:49] strong these things you worried about
[35:51] they won't hinder you amen can i say it
[35:53] church this morning your fears and
[35:55] worries will not stop you amen
[35:58] i don't know
[35:59] you will conquer you will overcome those
[36:02] obstacles that look so great they will
[36:04] fall in jesus name
[36:08] it's the same result as the laws of
[36:10] jericho just a different obstacle praise
[36:13] god they both fall they're both
[36:15] destroyed and you're the conqueror amen
[36:19] hallelujah
[36:21] thank you jesus
[36:23] that was joshua then joshua says amen
[36:24] that's the end of the chapter
[36:27] no more conversation about that
[36:30] he's like you couldn't trick me you
[36:31] little you the devil
[36:35] not them but the spiritual wickedness in
[36:36] high places
[36:39] i imagine with amen he had the priest
[36:40] right there with the urine thumb and
[36:41] right there on his chest
[36:44] what did you say that again mr manasseh
[36:46] said say that again what you you can't
[36:48] defeat the chairs let me see if that
[36:49] flash is on the word of god
[36:52] okay let's ask the priest priests
[36:54] they can't they can't defeat the
[36:56] chariots of wood i'm sure the chariots
[36:58] of iron or wood it doesn't flash oh well
[37:00] let me ask the priests again priests can
[37:02] they defeat any man that stands before
[37:03] them even giants and all the lights
[37:05] start flashing it's like a it's like an
[37:07] array of light just shining all over and
[37:09] joshua said see the word says it the
[37:11] prophet says it the word the prophet or
[37:13] one you will overcome
[37:16] amen because the word said so the
[37:19] european says so this doesn't lie this
[37:22] flashes with the word of god
[37:25] amen the light of god
[37:28] flashes from the pages of the bible that
[37:30] we're more than conquerors amen you just
[37:33] aren't going to conquer you're more than
[37:35] a conqueror
[37:37] you're not just going to defeat the
[37:38] chairs then you're going to cut down the
[37:40] wood praise god
[37:41] amen
[37:43] that's how we are at church we're not
[37:45] going to get a couple victories we're
[37:46] going to get the full victory the full
[37:49] inheritance
[37:51] amen
[37:53] hallelujah
[37:55] i told you i was ready to preach this

[38:12] this is brazil so i'm not making any
[38:14] political boundaries i'm not
[38:15] gerrymandering this okay i don't even
[38:18] remember what that means but i know it
[38:19] deals with the boundaries
[38:22] but see
[38:22] i put in my book it's in chapter 11 in
[38:24] my book you have to have the perfect
[38:26] will of god for these five areas if not
[38:29] you'll feel like your life hasn't
[38:31] attained what it's supposed to attain
[38:34] everybody has relationships now paul
[38:36] like i should go with paul pogba maybe
[38:38] just got a quick victory like like
[38:40] jericho or something like that
[38:41] but then vocation he had to be a tet
[38:43] maker
[38:44] he had any other any other temptations
[38:47] maybe to go sell purple like lydia or
[38:48] you know i'm just making that up you
[38:50] know there's any temptation he had to
[38:51] kind of cast down i just got to make
[38:53] tense i just got to be content making
[38:55] tense
[38:56] and then location where should i live
[38:58] where do i need to go well thank god the
[38:59] holy spirit led him to all his
[39:00] missionary trips and kept saying but
[39:02] you're you're destined for rome
[39:04] no matter where he traveled the holy
[39:05] ghost said i'm you're going to rome but
[39:07] praise god i'm going to rome
[39:09] the holy ghost said again oh you're
[39:10] going to rome hallelujah thank god i
[39:12] know i'm on the right track praise god
[39:13] everywhere i'm going i know i'm going to
[39:14] live at least so i get to rome
[39:16] hallelujah he had to be patient he had
[39:19] to believe the word of god
[39:21] and they had ministries right he had all
[39:23] these ministries that he was doing bible
[39:25] writing
[39:26] praise god his bible riding it was all
[39:29] the needs of the saints came upon him
[39:30] daily he said
[39:32] right
[39:33] and then gifts he had all the five
[39:35] preaching gifts i proved that last
[39:36] sunday through all this remember that
[39:38] wednesday night proved it and he i
[39:40] imagine he had all nine gifts of the
[39:41] holy ghost too we can probably prove
[39:43] eight of those by the bible but i never
[39:45] saw him interpret an unknown tongue
[39:47] that'll be the only one i haven't seen
[39:48] paul do but church now let's wipe away
[39:51] paul here now let's put you in here
[39:54] you've got to by the holy ghost
[39:56] conquer your relationships that's just
[39:58] like this text right a pastor has to
[40:00] conquer his home first before it can
[40:02] move on to the church it's interesting i
[40:04] put in that order that was all god
[40:05] because i wasn't thinking about that
[40:06] when i did this
[40:09] you've got to conquer your home life
[40:10] first that's your jericho amen
[40:13] hallelujah that's your jericho conquer
[40:16] yourself first amen
[40:19] if you can't conquer yourself you ain't
[40:21] going to help anybody else you've got to
[40:23] conquer your sin nature then you can
[40:25] care about other people amen
[40:27] and then you can help them praise god
[40:30] conquer your own home and yourself first
[40:33] take that land
[40:35] and then every footstep where you go
[40:38] that's your possession amen then you can
[40:41] walk into church and say praise the lord
[40:42] god's gonna show me my ministries for my
[40:44] life
[40:45] i've conquered my home i got the victory
[40:48] at the house hallelujah i'm living
[40:50] living in the word of god with
[40:51] confidence amen
[40:54] lord show me where i'm supposed to live
[40:56] show location show me my home church
[40:58] right right you can say that too your
[40:59] location
[41:01] show my vocation what job should i have
[41:02] lord
[41:03] where do you want me to work i'll be
[41:04] happy to work there i want to be a real
[41:06] light for you jesus
[41:08] help me to get the victory on that one
[41:10] and then relationships
[41:12] oh yeah i put that one at the bottom and
[41:13] yeah gifts lord show me the gifts in my
[41:16] life remember we never put gifts above
[41:17] the giver we got to make sure we got the
[41:19] holy ghost first but then there's a time
[41:21] in your life where you have to focus on
[41:23] the gifts
[41:24] but you're following charity into there
[41:26] amen
[41:27] so see when you take this land you're
[41:29] only following the pillar of fires
[41:31] leading you in there amen
[41:33] follow charity and desire gifts amen
[41:36] so in other words the pillar of fire the
[41:38] love of god will lead you to know your
[41:40] nine gifts of the holy ghost
[41:45] hallelujah
[41:46] that's nothing but the truth
[41:49] because that's the word of god
[41:51] i challenge anybody amen to show me any
[41:53] different the word of god it says follow
[41:55] charity and desire the gifts of the holy
[41:57] ghost
[41:58] so if you're born again you will desire
[42:00] those gifts so i'll see if i get any
[42:03] takers for my challenge i'm not saying
[42:05] here i'm saying maybe up there
[42:08] on the live stream
[42:10] the archives
[42:12] like i got a man this week from africa
[42:14] he said he said i watched your video on
[42:15] joseph brandon he said you're being so
[42:16] carnal talking about 28 squirrels
[42:19] i said roll back i just was i just got
[42:21] done praying to read my bible i felt i
[42:22] was under the holy spirit i said let me
[42:24] correct you you're wrong
[42:26] you're the one being carnal
[42:28] i said i was showing in the video how
[42:30] carnal the tape people are they say
[42:32] every word is thus saith the lord and
[42:34] brother brahm said may joseph have
[42:35] double times double what's what's 2
[42:37] times 2 4.
[42:39] he said may he have double times double
[42:41] everything that i have everything i've
[42:43] done well that means he's got what's
[42:45] seven times four if he spoke seven
[42:47] squirrels then he have to do 28.
[42:50] if he went around the world seven times
[42:52] he's got to do double times double
[42:54] everything that's the word brother and
[42:55] said
[42:56] everything
[42:58] and i said you're the one being carnal
[43:00] and in his comment he said he said well
[43:04] he said may god help us to know the
[43:05] truth somehow i said dirty
[43:08] amen
[43:09] thus
[43:10] ephesians chapter 4
[43:12] these things fire me up so i'm sorry
[43:14] sometimes i got the whistle a little bit
[43:16] whoo
[43:18] fire me up
[43:19] god don't need to tell us nothing he
[43:22] already talks in the word of god amen
[43:24] regarding the subject you don't need to
[43:26] tell us anything else because god he
[43:28] gave it to us in the word
[43:29] now god can tell his prophecy
[43:32] you understand what i'm saying
[43:33] but relating to that topic god don't
[43:35] need to say
[43:37] he's already said it amen and thank god
[43:40] the prophet the broad and the priesthood
[43:43] will all be saying the same thing and
[43:45] it's already wrote in the bible amen
[43:47] ah hallelujah thank god amen
[43:51] hallelujah
[43:53] and he wrote me back the next day and
[43:54] said you're right i am being carnal
[43:57] i said hallelujah i knew i was under the
[43:58] anointing that day
[44:00] i usually don't call people cardinal
[44:02] i'm usually not a name caller but that
[44:04] time i it must have been the holy spirit
[44:06] discerning it
[44:10] chapter 18. see church this is the time
[44:12] of season we're under we're under the
[44:13] time of season where the message is
[44:15] getting attacked from inside
[44:18] before it was outside right
[44:20] and that's why they had to say brother
[44:21] is the prophet brother but now we got to
[44:23] say brother is not god
[44:26] right
[44:26] i mean you got to say brother not every
[44:28] word he says infallible now a prophet is
[44:31] only infallible with thus saith the lord
[44:34] we got to get on that praise god that's
[44:37] what we're battling now and that's what
[44:38] i've been battling so i'm just showing
[44:40] you some of my battles as i uh possess
[44:43] my land here
[44:45] my ministries
[44:47] i'm just sharing with you some of the
[44:48] battles i've had over the week in my
[44:50] ministry and over there you should have
[44:51] saw it came up against these giants out
[44:53] of here
[44:54] through the internet
[44:57] now sometimes it's face to face
[44:58] right sometimes it's face to face
[45:00] sometimes over the phone sometimes it's
[45:01] over a zoom call
[45:02] but that's still a battle are you going
[45:04] to stand or are you going to cower to
[45:06] the devil
[45:08] we're going to stand
[45:11] because no man will stand before me
[45:12] brother william
[45:14] all the days of my life are they as long
[45:15] as i keep those three steps humble
[45:18] myself remember
[45:20] and keep word of god
[45:23] it was worked for these 15 years so that
[45:25] means it's going to work for the next 15
[45:26] if the lord tarries
[45:28] chapter 18. here's the outline oh i
[45:30] didn't do the outline okay you don't
[45:31] have to worry about that
[45:32] the outline is verse one is the
[45:35] tabernacle set up in shiloh
[45:40] and then verses two through the end
[45:43] is joshua saying
[45:45] he's he's rebuking them why haven't you
[45:46] possessed the land yet and then he sends
[45:49] out men to investigate come back in and
[45:51] then he gives a lot to benjamin that's
[45:52] that's chapter 18. hopefully i can
[45:54] finish that here pretty soon
[45:56] i'm not going to tell you the time there
[45:58] i'm just going to see how it goes
[45:59] usually i say the time and then i go too
[46:01] long you know uh chapter
[46:03] 18 verse one
[46:05] and the whole congregation of the
[46:06] children of israel assembled together at
[46:08] shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the
[46:10] congregation there and the land was
[46:11] subdued before them yeah we already know
[46:13] right we already know
[46:15] some of the canines were still there
[46:17] but they were under tribute
[46:20] right they weren't there there's no more
[46:21] battles they were just under taxes
[46:24] or slavery was another one they did
[46:26] slavery
[46:27] right remember the give me nights they
[46:28] were slaves
[46:30] cut the wood cut the wood get the water
[46:31] for the house of god they're slaves
[46:35] but see they still have so they have to
[46:37] understand that statement the land is
[46:38] subdued well
[46:40] they're not fighting against them so so
[46:42] much
[46:43] they're under control
[46:47] so here in verse 1 they set up shiloh in
[46:49] 1444 bc
[46:52] in the very center of the land
[46:54] shiloh means place of rest uh hallelujah
[46:57] amen where's god's art gonna rest church
[47:01] in your soul in shiloh amen
[47:04] your soul is the shadow that god wants
[47:06] to rest in amen hallelujah praise god
[47:09] jesus said i've come to you to give you
[47:11] rest to your souls amen
[47:15] oh hallelujah
[47:16] i come to give you my spirit in your
[47:18] shiloh
[47:22] i've come to fill your empty place
[47:25] with my spirit
[47:26] now this is interesting shiloh is part
[47:28] of ephraim's inheritance
[47:30] which was joshua's tribe
[47:32] right
[47:34] shiloh was close to the ark's future
[47:36] home
[47:36] jerusalem which david established about
[47:38] 402 years later
[47:42] and now notice here's the lesson you get
[47:43] church the now notice where joshua
[47:45] places it it's in the land of the
[47:47] prophet
[47:48] right in the very center
[47:51] of the land
[47:53] and that means the word of god from the
[47:55] prophet must be always placed at the
[47:57] center of our lives
[48:00] hallelujah
[48:01] so there's the arrow pointing to shiloh
[48:03] and i'm going to zoom in so don't strain
[48:05] your eyes i'll zoom in
[48:08] so there's shiloh
[48:10] and there's jerusalem with the two black
[48:11] arrows can i see that
[48:14] so the holy spirit said i'm placing it
[48:16] in shiloh
[48:18] until i get a man after my own heart
[48:22] then when i get a man after my own heart
[48:25] i'm going to set up the ark where it
[48:26] really needs to go
[48:28] jerusalem
[48:30] the home of melchizedek the high priest
[48:36] heaven's priest amen hallelujah
[48:39] i'm just going to do it i'm just going
[48:40] to leave it there until i get that man
[48:42] after my own heart he's going to just be
[48:44] a pre-figure to my son jesus amen oh and
[48:48] then when the word comes in he's going
[48:50] to dance with all his might he's going
[48:52] to shout and scream and praise the lord
[48:55] he's going to give god all the glory
[48:57] with all of his heart because the word
[48:59] is in his home
[49:00] amen amen
[49:03] [Applause]
[49:04] hallelujah that's what god wants god
[49:06] wants somebody appreciating when the ark
[49:09] comes into your house amen
[49:12] hallelujah amen
[49:15] how hallelujah and davidson if you don't
[49:16] like that wait till you see tomorrow
[49:20] if you didn't like me dance when brother
[49:21] diggs is here wait till next time he
[49:23] comes back
[49:25] hallelujah thank god amen jesus loves
[49:29] freedom amen
[49:32] he loves people that have a heart for
[49:34] the word
[49:36] and i've been to churches where you
[49:38] can't even clap
[49:40] so i want to enjoy my freedom here
[49:41] praise god i just
[49:43] oh thank you lord i just want to obey my
[49:46] freedom here because the spirit of the
[49:48] lord is here
[49:50] amen
[49:52] we know it's not there praise god
[49:55] hallelujah
[50:02] verses three to six joshua lays out
[50:04] another review look at this guy he's
[50:05] rebuking people all the time
[50:09] he just got done rebuking the manasseh
[50:10] now he's rebuking
[50:12] the seven other tribes
[50:16] that's just like the prophet right he's
[50:18] always rebuking everybody rebuking billy
[50:20] graham
[50:21] rebuking oral roberts david dupless
[50:23] duplicitous
[50:24] marilyn monroe
[50:25] jackie kennedy
[50:27] hallelujah
[50:29] we could keep going on and on all the
[50:31] people that rebuke that's what the holy
[50:32] spirit does to bring correction
[50:35] and if you're a child of god you'll say
[50:36] i love that guy
[50:39] that's why i don't care if people leave
[50:40] if i if i if i rebuke them it was the
[50:42] holy spirit i don't care if they leave i
[50:43] just prove they're not a child of god
[50:45] yeah it hurts to see people go but it
[50:47] hurts more if i disobey the holy spirit
[50:49] and tell a lie
[50:50] and compromise on god's word
[50:53] i'd rather i'd rather make sure i treat
[50:54] jesus the right way
[50:56] i want to kiss his feet praise god
[50:58] kiss the son lest he be angry
[51:00] i don't want to cater to church members
[51:02] right we don't want to cater to church
[51:04] members and kiss their feet and keep
[51:06] coming back and keep coming back that's
[51:07] fine we want you to come back if you're
[51:09] feeding on the word of god if you're
[51:11] obeying the holy spirit but we want you
[51:13] to obey the holy spirit praise god we're
[51:15] here to please christ
[51:18] paul said if i'm a servant of man i
[51:20] can't be the servant of christ amen
[51:22] i'm not really a servant of man i'm a
[51:24] servant of christ hallelujah
[51:27] amen
[51:29] thank the lord
[51:31] so he says you know i'll send three from
[51:33] each of the seven tribes 21
[51:35] 21
[51:36] 21 was how many days it took for daniel
[51:38] to get that revelation
[51:40] 21.
[51:41] the answer came after 21.
[51:45] the answer for them came after 21 spies
[51:47] came back
[51:48] just a little bit of throw that in there
[51:53] he said go through the land
[51:55] describe it for me
[51:57] write it in a book so i can i can
[51:59] understand these these uh the land for
[52:02] the seven churches i mean seven tribes
[52:05] sorry
[52:09] did you catch that
[52:11] lord
[52:12] church write it in a book so i can
[52:14] understand how we can place these seven
[52:16] tribes there's seven tribes that don't
[52:19] have a place yet write in a book and
[52:21] tell me
[52:22] describe these seven different lands
[52:25] that way i can give to each each tribe
[52:28] their possession i can give them their
[52:31] inheritance
[52:32] well that sounds familiar
[52:35] writing a description of seven different
[52:38] locations in a book hmm
[52:41] maybe ephesus smyrna
[52:44] pergamos thyrotira
[52:48] sardis
[52:50] philadelphia and maybe laodicea maybe
[52:54] it fits sure take that if the shoe fits
[52:57] where praise god
[52:59] amen
[53:01] this was a type
[53:03] before the prophet dies
[53:06] he has to finish placing the seven final
[53:09] tribes
[53:11] in a book
[53:12] before he goes off the scene he dies at
[53:14] chapter 24 which we're almost there
[53:18] before he dies god has to have him place
[53:21] the seven last remaining tribes
[53:23] into their perfect conditions and it's
[53:25] got to be written in a book
[53:27] remember brother simon freesis
[53:30] years ago
[53:31] verse 3 and joshua said the children of
[53:33] israel how long
[53:36] [Music]
[53:37] you look
[53:38] another rebuke
[53:40] how long you relax you seven tribes how
[53:43] long are you going to be idle how long
[53:44] are you going to be disheartened to go
[53:46] to possess the land which the lord your
[53:48] god of the fathers hath given you it's
[53:49] already been seven years
[53:51] how long is how many more how many how
[53:53] many more years do you need
[53:55] right how many more years you need to
[53:56] get rid of uh those cigarettes
[54:00] right
[54:00] how many more years you need to get rid
[54:02] of that that alcohol
[54:04] or that lying spirit
[54:06] or how about that root of bitterness how
[54:07] many more years do you really get rid of
[54:09] that how long is it going to take for
[54:11] you to possess your home
[54:13] praise god
[54:14] how long is it going to take for you to
[54:15] really understand what god's called you
[54:17] do in your life
[54:18] amen
[54:22] and we're not told the reason why
[54:25] right we're not told why but he rebukes
[54:27] them for their relaxed attitude that
[54:29] ought to bring a little remembrance to
[54:31] your minds
[54:34] in the church age book brother branham
[54:35] says ephesus means aimed at and relaxed
[54:40] isn't that interesting
[54:44] now if you look in the hebrew it
[54:45] actually means the the word actually
[54:46] means permitted
[54:48] ephesus means permitted which is the
[54:49] same as aimed at
[54:51] right it's permitted it's aimed at
[54:54] and then larkin adds the synonymous
[54:55] phrase to relax see they permitted it or
[54:58] they're relaxing on it
[55:01] and this matches jesus's main concern
[55:03] for the first church age
[55:05] right
[55:06] this age started in great zeal but
[55:08] decades later they left their first love
[55:11] ah that's what we got right here
[55:13] right that's what he had to rebuke
[55:14] manasseh on how come you've left your
[55:17] first love and you can't have enough
[55:19] faith to defeat the chairs of iron we've
[55:21] been defeating giants and kings and
[55:24] nations and people all these years and
[55:26] where has your first love gone our
[55:28] church where is our first love gone for
[55:31] the word of god
[55:34] if we're there we might we might not be
[55:36] there you might have your first love
[55:37] right now i feel like i got it right now
[55:39] praise god
[55:40] but you know everybody's different you
[55:41] know y'all go through times and seasons
[55:42] other times it might not feel like that
[55:45] but see
[55:46] joshua catches that at a time where they
[55:48] left their first love of really
[55:50] believing the promises of god
[55:53] now it's partly my job to preach that to
[55:55] you it's also the evangelist jobs which
[55:57] thank god for brother diggs and all the
[55:59] evangelists that we have come in here
[56:00] they're supposed to stir us up
[56:02] and they stir me up they stir all of us
[56:04] up
[56:05] but all of us have a duty
[56:07] to get back to our first love if we've
[56:10] lost the love of praying and
[56:12] fellowshipping with god and hearing the
[56:14] word of god and reading the word if
[56:16] we've lost the love of that we've got to
[56:18] repent and go back and get it
[56:21] go back and get the land that you lost
[56:24] praise god
[56:25] go back and get it somebody's squatting
[56:27] on your land
[56:29] and the church said
[56:31] go back and get it that's what they had
[56:32] to do they had to go back and get their
[56:34] first love
[56:36] because they lost that zeal they lost
[56:38] that i want to fight i want to overcome
[56:40] i want to overcome in church we all go
[56:42] through it let's let's not kid ourselves
[56:43] here
[56:44] everybody needs this message this
[56:46] morning because all of you have been in
[56:47] the message for a while now
[56:49] none of that none of you are really you
[56:50] know uh
[56:52] just first time holy ghost and every
[56:54] every sermon you want to stand up and
[56:56] shout and praise god like you did at the
[56:58] beginning praise god
[57:00] we've all got to get back to that we've
[57:01] all got to get back to our first love
[57:03] and be ready to conquer we in other
[57:05] words we can't be weary in well-doing
[57:08] we've got to get our first love back and
[57:10] say if i drove them out before by god's
[57:13] help i'll drive them out again amen
[57:19] thank god amen
[57:24] and i wrote about this in my book on
[57:26] pages 42 i'm sorry 492 493
[57:31] and yes i used brother simon's name
[57:32] because it came fresh from him
[57:35] william branham's god-ordained church
[57:37] ages book was foretold in joshua number
[57:40] joshua chapters 18 19.
[57:42] note the sermons were preached though in
[57:43] december january 1661
[57:46] and the book version came out december
[57:47] 1965 i'm thankful the lord revealed the
[57:50] foretelling of the exposition book in
[57:52] joshua 18 1890 to my brother simon a
[57:54] faithful bible teacher
[57:56] a missionary
[57:58] so joshua 18 1-10 finds the promised
[58:01] land subdued before israel and joshua
[58:04] still needs seven tribes to possess
[58:05] their land inheritance
[58:07] he sends out men to the land to explore
[58:09] it and bring it back its descriptions to
[58:11] joshua so he can divide it the men come
[58:13] back with the book describing the lands
[58:15] cities and cities
[58:17] and divide them up into seven parts
[58:21] lots before the lord and assigns the
[58:23] seven lot plots to the seven tribes this
[58:26] assignment had to take place before the
[58:27] prophet joshua's death
[58:30] two applications
[58:32] are apparent
[58:34] first
[58:38] jesus joshua
[58:40] he placed his foreign overcomers in the
[58:42] church ages of his own choosing
[58:45] see josh had to choose where to place
[58:47] him so did jesus have to place them in
[58:49] the right land
[58:50] oh look where he placed you brother amen
[58:52] and laodicea
[58:54] amen he didn't place you in fire tear
[58:56] where there's no bible he didn't place
[58:58] you there now they had overcomers then
[58:59] but he placed you church and i in the
[59:02] spot where all the mysteries of god are
[59:04] finished amen amen
[59:06] i don't know where you could be hot you
[59:08] don't have to be lukewarm or cold you
[59:10] can burn with the boiling fervor of god
[59:13] almighty amen that's where he placed
[59:15] your brother he didn't put you in in
[59:17] smyrna
[59:18] where they started dying they made the
[59:20] three gods in smyrna
[59:22] ephesus submerged second church age did
[59:24] you catch that only the first and last
[59:26] ages had the one god
[59:29] paul and us amen paul and brother
[59:33] we're the only ones that know god as one
[59:35] person amen
[59:37] thank god amen
[59:39] and that's where he wanted to place you
[59:40] brother bank
[59:42] jesus says joshua place bang in the
[59:44] laocian church age
[59:47] he could have placed him in luther's age
[59:49] and bang you might have sat there you
[59:51] might you might have been luther's
[59:52] servant like you're my friend and my
[59:54] helper bang might have knocked on the
[59:55] door and said uh pastor uh luther would
[59:58] you like another beer
[1:00:01] when he said he asked me but jesse is
[1:00:03] there anything i do to help at the
[1:00:04] church
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:06] i mean he could have been placed there
[1:00:08] but jesus would have brother value in
[1:00:10] this age amen he wanted me in this age
[1:00:14] where i we focus on the wine of the holy
[1:00:16] ghost amen
[1:00:18] give me another drink of that spiritual
[1:00:20] wine amen
[1:00:22] yes
[1:00:23] give me another drink of the new one the
[1:00:26] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:28] hallelujah aren't you glad i'm glad
[1:00:30] brother bang god didn't place me in that
[1:00:32] age
[1:00:35] martin luther said i got the quote in
[1:00:37] the book i put in there i said martin
[1:00:38] luther said i'd be happy if 10 of my
[1:00:40] converts stayed
[1:00:44] right 10 percent
[1:00:45] they had people flocking in their
[1:00:47] services but then church after a few
[1:00:49] years they all flocked out
[1:00:52] proves they weren't doves
[1:00:54] because doves are homing birds
[1:00:56] amen when you get the holy ghost you
[1:00:59] find your home and even if you leave you
[1:01:01] know how to get back amen
[1:01:04] back to this place the house of god
[1:01:06] where the word of god is being preached
[1:01:08] hallelujah
[1:01:10] they must have been crows that flew in
[1:01:12] like the pastor last week his last name
[1:01:14] was crow you remember that brother not
[1:01:16] nothing on his name but he he didn't
[1:01:17] want nothing about it
[1:01:19] he want nothing about the message
[1:01:21] i texted myself and her back left in my
[1:01:24] car and everything like that isn't that
[1:01:25] interesting
[1:01:26] but we're homing pigeons brother
[1:01:29] we know where our home is
[1:01:32] despite all the trials and all the
[1:01:34] storms of life may knock you off course
[1:01:36] somehow god directs you back home
[1:01:39] and you find it
[1:01:41] you fly in the church and you get fed
[1:01:44] and you get healed and you can fly out
[1:01:46] saying holy holy holy
[1:01:48] it's the lord
[1:01:50] oh my god amen
[1:01:53] oh hallelujah
[1:01:56] thank the lord church
[1:01:58] you're doves not crows
[1:02:02] glory
[1:02:06] see
[1:02:07] the seven part book symbolizes g listen
[1:02:09] jesus's seven letters in revelation so
[1:02:12] there's two types here
[1:02:14] you can either use
[1:02:16] revelation two and three this can be the
[1:02:19] type
[1:02:20] or if maokai would go get me the church
[1:02:22] age book
[1:02:23] the church age book could be the type
[1:02:25] could you get it thank you
[1:02:28] so this is the time jesus as joshua
[1:02:30] placing all of us
[1:02:32] in that last revelation chapter 3 14 to
[1:02:35] 22.
[1:02:36] i think i'll place sister naomi there i
[1:02:39] think i'll put sister beatrice there in
[1:02:40] that that last church age
[1:02:42] joshua looked at it and he said i'm
[1:02:44] going to place them right there in that
[1:02:45] last age where they can be hot on fire
[1:02:47] for the holy ghost
[1:02:49] thank you sir love you buddy
[1:02:52] so that's one application
[1:02:57] how many want to be hot and execute hot
[1:02:59] fervent works for the lord
[1:03:02] you have to zealously repent
[1:03:04] remember simon read that quote if
[1:03:06] denominations have to zealously repent
[1:03:08] what about us
[1:03:10] and so if you want to re if you want a
[1:03:11] revival in your in your mind you've got
[1:03:13] to repent the same way that you did the
[1:03:14] beginning praise god
[1:03:17] yes we have to
[1:03:20] so the second application is brother
[1:03:22] branham as joshua
[1:03:24] the seven part book represents his seven
[1:03:26] sermons on the church
[1:03:28] ages having received the revelation of
[1:03:31] the seven cities the seven church ages
[1:03:33] brother ram could place the believers of
[1:03:35] church history
[1:03:37] in their matching respective ages and
[1:03:39] write his exposition
[1:03:41] their historical placement had to come
[1:03:43] while the prophet was yet alive
[1:03:45] as his book was published just a few
[1:03:47] weeks before he went home to be with the
[1:03:49] lord
[1:03:50] and joshua finishes his book a few
[1:03:52] chapters before he goes home to me with
[1:03:54] the lord and the church said
[1:03:56] hallelujah
[1:03:58] so brother and got back uh got back the
[1:04:00] word and he was in a place oh see yeah
[1:04:03] luther was in the sardis age because
[1:04:05] they had a name but they were dead
[1:04:09] hallelujah he said i'll place luther uh
[1:04:11] and i'm sorry i placed wesley in the
[1:04:14] open door because it was the greatest
[1:04:16] age of missionary open door work in the
[1:04:19] history of the world amen
[1:04:21] he could place it because he heard the
[1:04:23] descriptions and you know just remember
[1:04:25] remember he said how he figured out the
[1:04:27] names of the or who the messengers were
[1:04:30] he said i looked at all the descriptions
[1:04:32] of their life and which one matched paul
[1:04:34] the most hey amen like like joshua oh
[1:04:38] which of these lands
[1:04:39] matches dan the most which of these
[1:04:41] lands hallelujah matches zebulun the
[1:04:44] most and i'll place them right where
[1:04:46] they need to go amen and brother into
[1:04:48] the same way i see elijah in that seven
[1:04:51] church age because he's restoring all
[1:04:53] things just like jesus said i'm placing
[1:04:56] him there
[1:04:57] and that's last in seven city praise god
[1:05:00] that's where i'm placing him and then he
[1:05:02] said it's thus saith the lord amen
[1:05:04] hallelujah praise god
[1:05:07] i'm about as free as a dove today praise
[1:05:08] god
[1:05:10] thank the lord i didn't mean to throw
[1:05:11] that forgive me
[1:05:13] let me try it again
[1:05:14] okay thank you
[1:05:16] you know how sometimes i get a little
[1:05:17] bit of to zealous
[1:05:19] forgive me lord
[1:05:22] i should throw down my phone like that's
[1:05:23] something i should turn out
[1:05:25] forgive me
[1:05:28] verses 7-10
[1:05:32] joshua
[1:05:34] 18
[1:05:35] ten i i don't think we have time to read
[1:05:37] it
[1:05:39] so again joshua says levi gets no
[1:05:41] portion because god is their portion
[1:05:43] i like that song you were singing
[1:05:44] brother keep working on that one buddy
[1:05:46] he was singing this song called my
[1:05:48] portion it's one of my favorite songs
[1:05:50] right now
[1:05:52] and then joshua says so levi doesn't get
[1:05:54] any
[1:05:56] the two and half tribes though they're
[1:05:58] gonna get their land on the east of
[1:05:59] jordan
[1:06:00] so that's stuff we already knew
[1:06:02] but then in verses 10 to 7 to 10 the men
[1:06:05] rise up they go write the book they
[1:06:07] bring it back to joshua and he cast lots
[1:06:10] before the lord he's got the urem there
[1:06:12] and lord lord jesus lord god where do
[1:06:15] you want uh
[1:06:16] uh where where do you where do you want
[1:06:18] martin to go saint mark where do you
[1:06:19] want martin to go
[1:06:21] and the lord jesus chose him
[1:06:23] i want martin
[1:06:24] in the pergamone church agent
[1:06:26] lord jesus where do you want i iranius
[1:06:29] iranis he's the second church he's
[1:06:30] messenger place them right there
[1:06:33] how many places all the church age
[1:06:35] messages right exactly where they need
[1:06:37] to go
[1:06:39] and joshua divides the seven parts out
[1:06:41] to the people
[1:06:44] now look at this church at the end of
[1:06:46] the chapter benjamin receives the first
[1:06:48] inheritance of the last seven
[1:06:51] now some of you that really love the
[1:06:52] bible
[1:06:54] might want to see this this is
[1:06:55] benjamin's area very small benjamin was
[1:06:57] the least of the tribes right
[1:07:00] but paul was a benjamite
[1:07:02] so was saul
[1:07:04] so see sometimes great things can come
[1:07:05] out of little people
[1:07:07] that i'll encourage you in a small
[1:07:08] church
[1:07:10] right i had a couple brothers this week
[1:07:11] just text me and tell me you have this
[1:07:13] you have the sweetest people that we
[1:07:15] know in the message
[1:07:17] yeah
[1:07:18] so be encouraged praise god
[1:07:20] i'm sorry i just had one this week but
[1:07:21] i've had people in the past tell me that
[1:07:23] you've got some of the sweetest people
[1:07:24] in the church you just got gems in there
[1:07:28] that's true thank god
[1:07:30] see because that's because the gems
[1:07:31] cutting you right you're just a part of
[1:07:32] that same gen
[1:07:34] the gem rather right
[1:07:36] because that's what it takes it takes a
[1:07:37] diamond to cut a diamond is that right
[1:07:39] right so see the diamond christ is
[1:07:41] cutting you he's cutting you into
[1:07:42] diamonds so you shine and show the glory
[1:07:45] of god right here in the church
[1:07:47] he's cutting you a little bit service
[1:07:48] after service keeps cutting you i can
[1:07:50] make this a little bit sharper i can cut
[1:07:52] off some of these rough edges
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:55] so they can shine out there with their
[1:07:57] family and friends and co-workers that
[1:07:59] can shine the real reflection of christ
[1:08:02] amen
[1:08:05] benjamin's got this real small lot
[1:08:08] and it's really interesting it takes
[1:08:10] what was it it takes like
[1:08:13] 17 verses to describe this area right
[1:08:15] here can you imagine that like 17 verses
[1:08:17] this guy this little area but joshua
[1:08:20] does it because joshua knew exactly what
[1:08:22] god wanted i know exactly where these
[1:08:25] churches i know where they're going to
[1:08:26] start and i know when they're going to
[1:08:27] end
[1:08:30] i hear you praise god i know where these
[1:08:32] borders start and i know where they end
[1:08:34] praise god amen
[1:08:36] [Music]
[1:08:37] hallelujah
[1:08:40] so this sermon is about three years in
[1:08:41] the making since simon preached that
[1:08:42] message here
[1:08:44] this sermon today is about three years
[1:08:45] the making and probably next sunday too
[1:08:49] now let's look at this just briefly i'll
[1:08:50] just get started on this and i'll try to
[1:08:52] i've already been preaching over an hour
[1:08:54] so let me try to usually give me an hour
[1:08:55] and a half and everybody's everybody's
[1:08:56] pretty good with hour and a half you
[1:08:57] know by god's grace and i'm pretty good
[1:08:59] with hour and a half too so
[1:09:00] so let's look at the fulfillment of
[1:09:02] jacob and moses's prophecies of the 12
[1:09:05] tribes now what now just a note here
[1:09:07] before we start brother branham if you
[1:09:09] listen to him he talks about these
[1:09:11] fulfilled prophecies at least six times
[1:09:14] twice in 1960 twice in 1961 once in 63
[1:09:17] 164. now let's read them and show how we
[1:09:21] must look in the bible to best
[1:09:22] understand this
[1:09:25] bible said joshua and caleb they were
[1:09:27] going on to the promise they moved over
[1:09:29] the land they took the land settled down
[1:09:31] the land as a possession we never stop
[1:09:33] at justification same vacation let's go
[1:09:35] on to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:39] let's not stop at believing on the lord
[1:09:40] jesus being baptized let's not stop
[1:09:42] because he cleaned us up from a life of
[1:09:43] sin but now we press on into the
[1:09:46] position to a promise of the baptism of
[1:09:49] the holy ghost and then he quotes acts 2
[1:09:51] 38 39.
[1:09:53] so brother man switching back from
[1:09:54] natural to spiritual right natural to
[1:09:56] spiritual
[1:09:57] so ephesus here sets us like joshua
[1:09:59] positionally you notice joshua after
[1:10:01] crossing the land taking land he divided
[1:10:03] up the land from here manasseh here dad
[1:10:05] here benjamin here he divided the land
[1:10:07] and notice oh this burns in our hearts
[1:10:09] each one of those hebrew mothers giving
[1:10:11] birth to those children she spoke the
[1:10:13] very place in her labor pains where they
[1:10:15] would be positioned in the promised land
[1:10:18] oh it's a great study if we could only
[1:10:19] go into details which would take hours
[1:10:21] after hours
[1:10:23] someday when we get our church fixed i
[1:10:25] just like to come and take a solid month
[1:10:26] or two and i've been preaching on this
[1:10:28] for february march april may june july
[1:10:32] august september i've been preaching on
[1:10:33] joshua for eight months
[1:10:35] and i'm still just scratching the
[1:10:36] surface
[1:10:37] i'm sure there's so many things going
[1:10:38] over my head aren't you glad what we
[1:10:40] have received from god
[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:43] someday we get okay watch when they each
[1:10:46] one of those mothers when she called out
[1:10:47] ephraim when she was in labor but
[1:10:49] positionally placed them where his feet
[1:10:51] were setting in the oil just exactly
[1:10:52] every one of them where they were at and
[1:10:54] joshua not knowing this but by
[1:10:55] inspiration led to the holy spirit after
[1:10:57] being in the promised land give each man
[1:10:59] his promise exactly what the holy spirit
[1:11:02] promised through the birth back there
[1:11:04] how that god is set in the church
[1:11:06] through labor pains oh they get
[1:11:08] tremendous now he goes back to spiritual
[1:11:10] the women natural birth pains now he
[1:11:12] goes to spiritual birth pains oh they
[1:11:14] get tremendous sometimes when a church
[1:11:16] is groaning under the persecution of the
[1:11:18] outside world so see all these vaccine
[1:11:20] mandates bang they're all bringing out
[1:11:22] more prayers in us
[1:11:24] they're birth pains
[1:11:26] hallelujah
[1:11:28] the threat of them canceling us and
[1:11:29] shutting our doors and no more free
[1:11:31] speech and no more freedom uh gun rights
[1:11:34] and all these things all these things
[1:11:36] are persecutions that are driving us
[1:11:38] closer to god all the time
[1:11:42] believing on the lord jesus the promise
[1:11:44] of the holy ghost is just as real to us
[1:11:46] as it was at pentecost how they groan
[1:11:48] and cry under the labor pains but when
[1:11:50] they're born and positionally born in
[1:11:52] the kingdom of god the holy ghost has
[1:11:54] set in the church some apostles prophets
[1:11:56] teachers pastors evangelists
[1:11:58] then he's give into their speaking with
[1:12:00] tongues interpretation tongues knowledge
[1:12:02] he quotes the the five gifts and the
[1:12:03] nine gifts
[1:12:06] where the church is now this is my
[1:12:07] purpose of doing this the church is
[1:12:08] always trying to take somebody else's
[1:12:10] corner now isn't that just like manasseh
[1:12:13] manasseh said give me somebody else's
[1:12:15] corner josh says i'm going to give you a
[1:12:16] corner your corner
[1:12:18] but brother adam said this is the lesson
[1:12:20] we can get from joshua don't try to be
[1:12:22] other people something somebody else's
[1:12:25] be what god made you praise god
[1:12:28] hallelujah
[1:12:31] don't do that you can never raise corn
[1:12:32] in ephraim's corner
[1:12:35] if you're manasseh you've got to take
[1:12:36] your place in christ positionally take
[1:12:38] it
[1:12:39] oh it gets deep and rich when we get in
[1:12:42] here
[1:12:43] it's been pretty deep and rich these
[1:12:44] last eight months or so
[1:12:46] praise god how god puts one in the
[1:12:48] church to speak with tongues another now
[1:12:51] we've been taught many times we often
[1:12:52] speak in tongues that's wrong we all got
[1:12:54] to do it no we don't they didn't all do
[1:12:56] one thing each one was
[1:12:57] the land was provided and divvied up by
[1:13:00] inspiration
[1:13:02] i could take the scriptures and show it
[1:13:03] to you exactly that he put them in the
[1:13:05] place where they were supposed to be
[1:13:06] positionally how that the two half
[1:13:08] tribes was to stay across the river how
[1:13:11] that their mothers cried that in their
[1:13:12] birth and how that each place was
[1:13:14] supposed to be
[1:13:17] and now after you are in that don't mean
[1:13:19] you're out free from war
[1:13:21] like i heard a preacher say last week it
[1:13:23] was wrong he said you don't have to
[1:13:24] fight for anything god just gives it to
[1:13:26] you and i thought what about this quote
[1:13:29] but you don't you don't have to fight
[1:13:31] when you're out there so much right like
[1:13:32] just like justification or saying
[1:13:33] vacation right the the
[1:13:35] the bread
[1:13:37] just falls from heaven to you you're
[1:13:39] babied you just gotta go outside your
[1:13:41] tent you just gotta squeeze outside your
[1:13:42] tent and grab something and come back in
[1:13:44] that's what a baby has to do right
[1:13:46] but a real man's got to go plant and dig
[1:13:48] and pray for rain and weed and water and
[1:13:51] plant some more praise god and keep
[1:13:53] trusting god and then the blessing comes
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] after many months of labor praise god
[1:13:59] after many hard seasons then all the
[1:14:01] blessings and the real mature food comes
[1:14:04] amen
[1:14:05] that's what god wants you to be a real
[1:14:06] mature christian
[1:14:08] not a baby
[1:14:09] we got to baby them to come to church
[1:14:11] well if you come to church for six
[1:14:12] months or if you come to church for one
[1:14:14] year if you come to church for three
[1:14:15] years i'll do this for you that's a baby
[1:14:19] right
[1:14:23] you still have to fight for every inch
[1:14:25] of ground you stand on
[1:14:26] so see canaan did not represent the
[1:14:28] great heaven because it's war and
[1:14:30] troubles and killings and fightings but
[1:14:32] it did represent this it must
[1:14:35] be a perfect vlog
[1:14:36] in other words we must remain under the
[1:14:38] blood
[1:14:39] lord jesus forgive me for my sins today
[1:14:41] and you better say the same thing
[1:14:42] tomorrow lord jesus on monday forgive me
[1:14:44] my failures on monday
[1:14:47] then it's a perfect walk
[1:14:49] yes
[1:14:50] because i'm walking in the light as he
[1:14:52] is in the light and the blood of jesus
[1:14:54] cleanses me and you and i from all
[1:14:57] unrighteousness don't let that become
[1:14:59] tired to you if you love god you'll love
[1:15:01] that word amen
[1:15:03] that's my walk that's my perfect walk is
[1:15:05] john 1
[1:15:07] verses 8 and 9 praise god
[1:15:09] that i confess my sins and i stay in the
[1:15:11] light as christ is in the light
[1:15:15] now i want to say this
[1:15:16] and church i'm always open to correction
[1:15:21] after searching scripture numerous times
[1:15:23] for over 15 years of my pastoring i
[1:15:25] cannot find the hebrew mothers
[1:15:27] prophesied
[1:15:30] of their son's positions in the land
[1:15:33] i only find jacob and moses
[1:15:36] doing the prophesyings
[1:15:38] so before we get real deep and rich in
[1:15:40] this next week
[1:15:41] i just want to start with this thought
[1:15:43] and then i'm going to close i'm going to
[1:15:44] start with a thought and then close
[1:15:46] starting close
[1:15:50] so remember when brother ram preached on
[1:15:51] uh the feast of the trumpets he made a
[1:15:52] mistake
[1:15:54] he said like the other day i got
[1:15:55] something mixed up i happened to hear
[1:15:56] it's it's caught right in here it's on
[1:15:58] the tape i'll probably hear from it when
[1:16:00] i was talking about the seven trumpets i
[1:16:01] said it was the seven trumpets
[1:16:04] okay so brother i was saying the feast
[1:16:06] of weeks
[1:16:07] uh
[1:16:07] uh brother i was saying this the feast
[1:16:09] of weeks pentecost was seven weeks after
[1:16:13] uh seven weeks out after the first
[1:16:15] fruits
[1:16:16] okay
[1:16:18] no i'm not now i'm getting mixed up i'm
[1:16:20] sorry
[1:16:21] uh there's a mix up there there's a
[1:16:22] mix-up
[1:16:23] oh no oh yeah brother ram said the seven
[1:16:26] trumpets the the trump the feast of
[1:16:28] trumpets was in the seventh month and
[1:16:29] brother adam said that type the seven
[1:16:30] church ages well that does it
[1:16:33] right because the feast of weeks types
[1:16:34] the seven church ages
[1:16:36] okay that's where it is that's where i
[1:16:37] got it mixed up and brother he corrects
[1:16:39] it you can listen to it he cracks it on
[1:16:40] the tape
[1:16:42] but at the end of this he said if you
[1:16:43] happen to catch it on your tape remember
[1:16:45] look in the bike
[1:16:48] so when you press play
[1:16:50] jeffersonville and all these churches
[1:16:52] when you press play you better have your
[1:16:54] bible handy there to make sure if you
[1:16:56] hear something and you don't remember it
[1:16:58] you better look in the bible
[1:17:02] right
[1:17:03] that's what they need to remember push
[1:17:04] play and open the bible and and push
[1:17:08] play and open the bible way right can i
[1:17:10] make a rhyme out of that push play and
[1:17:12] always obey and open up your bible
[1:17:14] something like that he said if ever
[1:17:16] you're not sure about something look in
[1:17:18] the bible praise god how do you believe
[1:17:20] that
[1:17:22] he makes a mistake about the seventh
[1:17:25] the seventh feast and says the type
[1:17:26] seven church ages it doesn't
[1:17:28] it doesn't it types god returning to
[1:17:30] israel
[1:17:31] and the prophets coming out and
[1:17:33] preaching to israel it doesn't type the
[1:17:34] seven church ages
[1:17:36] the feast of weeks types of seven church
[1:17:38] ages which brother ram says in the
[1:17:39] sermon he actually says it in the sermon
[1:17:40] too
[1:17:42] now let me explain let me give you two
[1:17:44] examples that i'm going to close
[1:17:46] genesis 40 ephraim genesis 41 verse 52
[1:17:50] is the only recording of the birth of
[1:17:52] ephraim's birth from azinath
[1:17:54] because ephraim is joseph's
[1:17:56] son ephram and manasseh were joseph's
[1:17:59] two sons
[1:18:00] right
[1:18:01] ephraim was older manasseh was younger
[1:18:04] but then remember he the eat master got
[1:18:05] the blessing
[1:18:07] right
[1:18:08] through the cross that's that's a
[1:18:10] beautiful sermon
[1:18:11] right
[1:18:12] and now notice as an ass the bible never
[1:18:15] mentions that as an f mentions oil
[1:18:19] and the hebrew lexicon
[1:18:21] has no meaning for ephraim but it's
[1:18:24] likely related to her fruitfulness
[1:18:26] despite her afflictions
[1:18:28] because every name
[1:18:30] given by the mother was related to the
[1:18:32] circumstances they were going in at the
[1:18:34] time
[1:18:36] and i'm going to prove it to you
[1:18:39] okay now here's what brother said watch
[1:18:41] when they what this is brother adam's
[1:18:42] quote now i'm just showing you how this
[1:18:44] quote we need to look in the bible to
[1:18:45] make sure this quote is exactly right
[1:18:48] because i'm trying to i as i study this
[1:18:50] for 15 years i have church these are
[1:18:52] notes i've had since i started pastoring
[1:18:54] in 2006. i've had a question about this
[1:18:56] subject i've warned about this for 15
[1:18:59] years but it's taken me 15 years to
[1:19:00] learn i've got to rightly divide every
[1:19:02] word of brother branham too
[1:19:05] and i don't care if people call me a
[1:19:06] hypocrite or anything like that i don't
[1:19:08] care what they call me you have to do it
[1:19:09] or else you're going to be an idolater
[1:19:11] you're going to worship brother branham
[1:19:13] i don't care what they say i don't care
[1:19:14] what anybody says all i care is what
[1:19:16] jesus says
[1:19:17] right
[1:19:18] amen i know that's rough but that's true
[1:19:20] so brother man said when ephraim's mom
[1:19:23] had him she cried out he's going to be
[1:19:25] placed in oil well that's not what
[1:19:26] happened in the bible
[1:19:28] as far as i know now it might have
[1:19:29] happened and it's not recorded in the
[1:19:31] bible
[1:19:32] but that's not in the bible
[1:19:34] here's the bible
[1:19:36] and joseph
[1:19:37] under joseph were born two sons before
[1:19:39] the years of famine which azanath the
[1:19:40] daughter of uh potiphara priests of on
[1:19:43] bear unto him and joseph called the name
[1:19:45] of the firstborn manasseh for god said
[1:19:48] he hath made me forget all my toil and
[1:19:50] all my father's house oh i'm sorry in
[1:19:52] this case azanath didn't even name the
[1:19:54] children joseph named him
[1:19:56] so that's a mistake i've got to fix
[1:19:59] see so brother ram said ephraim's mom
[1:20:01] asanath called out he's going to live in
[1:20:03] oil when he was born but that bible
[1:20:04] don't record that
[1:20:07] for god hath caused me to be fruitful in
[1:20:09] the land of my affliction
[1:20:11] so if manasseh if manasseh means here
[1:20:14] let me get to
[1:20:16] manasseh means causing to forget that's
[1:20:18] with the hebrew lexicon
[1:20:20] so joseph was saying look manasseh means
[1:20:22] he's made me forget all my father's
[1:20:24] house does that make sense
[1:20:27] joseph gave the meaning of manasseh
[1:20:29] based upon what he was going through at
[1:20:30] that time
[1:20:32] so when ephraim was born it must mean
[1:20:34] something like this
[1:20:35] fruitful in my affliction it must mean
[1:20:38] something like that because that's what
[1:20:39] the bible says
[1:20:43] here's a second example reuben
[1:20:46] brother ram said that reuben now brother
[1:20:49] let's let's read this
[1:20:50] brother man says i don't have it all
[1:20:52] wrote down here but let's say or let's
[1:20:54] pretend
[1:20:56] or let's presume reuben met sheep herder
[1:20:58] now some people brother william will die
[1:21:00] the death
[1:21:01] reuben means sheep herder brother graham
[1:21:03] said it the prophet said it
[1:21:05] it's absolutely true you're a heretic if
[1:21:07] you don't believe it
[1:21:09] you're a heretic if you don't take every
[1:21:10] word back to the word of god
[1:21:12] because you're an idolater you're the
[1:21:14] heretic like joshua said you you're so
[1:21:16] big and strong right
[1:21:18] put it back on him you're the heretic
[1:21:24] oh yeah look at this said e ferment
[1:21:26] cornraiser i just showed you ephraim
[1:21:28] don't don't even have a definition right
[1:21:33] now look he says
[1:21:36] reuben does not mean sheep herder
[1:21:38] although later he's connected to sheep
[1:21:39] we're going to preach this lord willing
[1:21:40] next week i'm going to show you all the
[1:21:42] 12 sons and all that jose all that jacob
[1:21:45] prophesied about them and moses and show
[1:21:47] them how some of them placed them in the
[1:21:49] land some of them didn't
[1:21:52] some of them just cursed their sons
[1:21:54] like reuben he was cursed
[1:21:57] some of them did get positionally placed
[1:21:59] in the land
[1:22:01] and got lots of blessings in the land
[1:22:04] like zebulun
[1:22:05] the holy ghost told zebulun right where
[1:22:06] he's going to live
[1:22:08] so see
[1:22:09] everything from brother bam we we
[1:22:11] respect it but we got to take it through
[1:22:12] the filter of god's word which is
[1:22:15] exactly what he taught us amen
[1:22:17] a thinking man's filter is the word of
[1:22:20] god amen and it produces a holy ghost
[1:22:22] filled man's taste amen
[1:22:25] just look in your bible
[1:22:26] right if there's any questions just look
[1:22:28] in your bible
[1:22:30] it's so simple remember i said if
[1:22:31] there's a mistake on the tape look in
[1:22:32] the bible
[1:22:34] but i've heard that i've heard brother
[1:22:35] and son say you don't even have to look
[1:22:37] in the bible you can just say amen to
[1:22:39] every word on tape that's a lie
[1:22:42] i challenge that
[1:22:44] by the word of god by the holy spirit
[1:22:47] that's a lie
[1:22:49] impossible every word must be taken back
[1:22:51] to the word of god amen
[1:22:53] amen
[1:22:55] and i stand here i'm still waiting these
[1:22:57] two years later brother amen i'm still
[1:22:58] waiting for the answers who's the real
[1:22:59] joseph billy paul are you i'm still
[1:23:01] waiting for the answers
[1:23:03] you know i guess i imagine i'll be keep
[1:23:04] waiting for a long time prior to the
[1:23:05] rapture
[1:23:06] i don't know i'm not sure if i get my
[1:23:07] answer there either but i already know
[1:23:09] the answer praise god the answer is
[1:23:11] joseph is the the promised joseph not
[1:23:13] billy paul is brother ram's opinion but
[1:23:15] they can't say that or else they're
[1:23:16] going to blast him somehow
[1:23:18] nonsense
[1:23:19] nonsense
[1:23:21] what dad doesn't want his children all
[1:23:22] to preach
[1:23:24] like i talk about malachi all the time
[1:23:26] preaching
[1:23:27] they might not be preachers no pressure
[1:23:29] son you got a real battle to overcome
[1:23:31] he's gonna possess the land praise god
[1:23:36] you know you just gotta live under
[1:23:37] things you know you gotta live i had to
[1:23:38] live under my dad he wasn't there much
[1:23:39] so he's gotta live under
[1:23:41] he's gotta overcome he can do it by the
[1:23:43] holy ghost
[1:23:45] but see
[1:23:47] brother ram says reuben means sheep
[1:23:48] herder it doesn't it means behold a son
[1:23:53] and there's the proof
[1:23:55] leah conceived now this is one where the
[1:23:57] mother did cry out but she didn't
[1:23:58] position replace him she just gave him a
[1:24:01] name
[1:24:03] she said she
[1:24:04] she called his name reuben for she said
[1:24:06] surely the lord had looked upon my
[1:24:08] affliction and now therefore my husband
[1:24:10] will love me and nothing to do with
[1:24:11] where reuben what he's going to
[1:24:13] he's going to have sheep or oil or corn
[1:24:15] it had nothing to do with that
[1:24:16] is it leo was saying remember the sermon
[1:24:18] uh leah loved the lord yeah you remember
[1:24:19] that one buddy that's a good one holy
[1:24:21] ghost gave us a good time that day
[1:24:23] it it wasn't leah it wasn't about where
[1:24:26] he's going it's about her
[1:24:28] it's about her i want to be loved by my
[1:24:30] husband
[1:24:31] right
[1:24:33] god saw me god saw me hurting through my
[1:24:35] pregnancy where my husband didn't love
[1:24:37] me and god gave me a son now my husband
[1:24:39] is going to love me did he not but not
[1:24:41] as far as we know he didn't he didn't
[1:24:45] it wasn't about sheep hurting
[1:24:47] it was about i wish my husband would
[1:24:48] love me
[1:24:51] so which one's right
[1:24:54] oh you blasphemer you better not say the
[1:24:55] tape was wrong but the bram said the
[1:24:57] tapes were wrong lebron said there's
[1:24:58] lots of things wrong on the tape
[1:25:00] he said i do that all the time now he
[1:25:02] said i'm such a dummy but he wasn't he
[1:25:03] was a smart man but he's just a tired
[1:25:05] man he makes mistakes he forgets he's a
[1:25:06] man like you he's a woman like you and
[1:25:08] the church said
[1:25:09] he was no dummy he was being humble but
[1:25:12] he said i make those kind of mistakes
[1:25:14] all the time he said
[1:25:17] seven hundred or seven thousand
[1:25:19] but there's gonna be seven hundred in
[1:25:21] the rapture of seven thousand which one
[1:25:23] is it
[1:25:24] is it the bible or your tape
[1:25:26] everybody said
[1:25:27] it's the bible praise god look in the
[1:25:29] bible amen
[1:25:31] let's all say look in the bible ready
[1:25:32] look in the bible let's say it again
[1:25:34] look in the bible let's say it three
[1:25:36] times ready look in the bible amen look
[1:25:38] in the bible don't be afraid you're
[1:25:40] supposed to listen to the tapes you're
[1:25:42] supposed to read the books i love
[1:25:43] reading the church book i love reading
[1:25:45] all these books i love listening to them
[1:25:46] but when it comes down to it you gotta
[1:25:48] look in the word amen
[1:25:51] those these false prophets are gonna
[1:25:52] deceive you
[1:25:54] because the word is the absolute not a
[1:25:56] man the word is the absolute jesus
[1:25:58] christ is the absolute amen amen
[1:26:01] hallelujah and i've been raised up to
[1:26:03] preach that by the way for such a time
[1:26:05] as this
[1:26:06] amen i hate it some of you you've been
[1:26:10] raised up to stand with it amen
[1:26:12] despite the reproach and the making fun
[1:26:14] and all the nonsense you've been raised
[1:26:16] to stand up for it praise god
[1:26:20] what does reuben mean does it mean sheep
[1:26:22] razor
[1:26:23] no but he was just remembering he said
[1:26:25] let's say he was just you just making
[1:26:26] just making a hypothetical situation
[1:26:29] it doesn't mean that it means behold a
[1:26:31] son
[1:26:38] now i hope you appreciate me for taking
[1:26:39] things back to the word of god
[1:26:41] if you leave because i preached that
[1:26:43] well bye
[1:26:44] see you later
[1:26:46] but if you but if you if you really love
[1:26:47] the word you should say amen i
[1:26:49] appreciate a preacher that will take it
[1:26:50] back to the word
[1:26:52] i appreciate a preacher that will
[1:26:53] actually study the bible
[1:26:56] because that's what paul said
[1:27:00] he said study yourself approved unto god
[1:27:02] give yourself to reading
[1:27:05] right and exhortation
[1:27:08] to save you and them that hear you
[1:27:10] that's right i'm trying to save your
[1:27:12] souls church praise god i'm trying to
[1:27:14] keep you away from this denominational
[1:27:15] beast system that they're all going to
[1:27:17] unite with
[1:27:18] i'm trying to save you and me from that
[1:27:20] and together we'll make it by the grace
[1:27:22] of god
[1:27:24] in closing this shows fear and idolatry
[1:27:28] among preachers
[1:27:30] and it's disguised like manasseh it's
[1:27:32] just disguised
[1:27:33] as respect and honor well i'm so great
[1:27:36] and powerful and i i just need more
[1:27:40] see just like that's a disguise they
[1:27:42] have this this this disguise that that
[1:27:44] can't even say something's wrong on the
[1:27:46] tapes
[1:27:47] you'd be surprised i've heard preachers
[1:27:49] preach this you're trying to correct
[1:27:51] god's prophet
[1:27:52] now that sounds good but that's a lie
[1:27:56] that's a lie
[1:27:57] right
[1:27:59] they i've heard maneuvers say that over
[1:28:01] the years like they're standing up for
[1:28:03] brother branham
[1:28:05] no
[1:28:06] they're just they're they're they're
[1:28:08] just admitting they haven't studied it
[1:28:10] praise god
[1:28:11] they're just admitting they haven't
[1:28:13] obeyed paul's commission to you go study
[1:28:16] you labor you're a workman laboring the
[1:28:18] doctrine of the word of god
[1:28:21] they're just admitting well i didn't
[1:28:22] study that one out so i'm just going to
[1:28:23] say what the tapes say
[1:28:25] well it's your job to study it out
[1:28:27] that's what you get paid the tithes for
[1:28:30] right
[1:28:31] that's what you get paid the offerings
[1:28:32] for evangelists right and teachers
[1:28:35] that's what you get paid for to go labor
[1:28:37] and study and get the truth and bring it
[1:28:39] to the people don't hide behind the lie
[1:28:41] conquer the land amen
[1:28:44] be a workman cut down those trees amen
[1:28:47] cut down the lies coming out of
[1:28:48] jeffersonville hallelujah cut down the
[1:28:51] lies coming out of these false fivefold
[1:28:53] sermons these return ministry people cut
[1:28:55] down those lies and possess the land
[1:28:57] amen
[1:28:59] work for it praise god give yourself
[1:29:01] holy to starting and preaching the word
[1:29:03] of god amen
[1:29:07] they exalt
[1:29:08] themselves oh who are you the correct
[1:29:11] brother
[1:29:12] or who are you to correct god's prophet
[1:29:14] but the fact is they're too scared and
[1:29:16] lazy to study the bible
[1:29:19] that's the fact brother william he's
[1:29:20] laughing because he knows it
[1:29:22] he's seen it preachers come and preach
[1:29:24] the same thing they already preached
[1:29:25] well
[1:29:25] how come you can't give us something new
[1:29:28] because they're not studying like they
[1:29:29] need to
[1:29:30] just press and play looking for a
[1:29:32] paycheck
[1:29:36] that's nothing but the truth
[1:29:39] jose knows what i'm talking about he's
[1:29:41] seen it too
[1:29:42] not thank god some of you haven't seen
[1:29:44] it
[1:29:45] but some of us have seen it
[1:29:48] church every single person outside of
[1:29:50] jesus christ needs corrected
[1:29:53] uh let's look in your bible can we can
[1:29:55] you look in your bible
[1:29:56] i'm just saying that you know like
[1:29:58] brother brahm said
[1:30:00] hebrews 12.
[1:30:02] does everybody need correction or or do
[1:30:04] prophets not need correction
[1:30:06] the only thing that doesn't need
[1:30:07] correction is thus saith the lord
[1:30:09] everything else we've got to be really
[1:30:10] careful with yes
[1:30:12] and i showed it to you a few months ago
[1:30:13] even the words right after thus saith
[1:30:15] the lord you've got to be careful with
[1:30:18] because brother brahm said if a woman
[1:30:19] cuts her hair she's dead that's thus
[1:30:21] saith the lord and then he says first
[1:30:22] corinthians 14.
[1:30:24] that's the wrong chapter
[1:30:26] hair is not in the 14th chapter of
[1:30:28] corinthians hair is in the 11th chapter
[1:30:32] and the church said amen i know you're
[1:30:34] getting quiet yeah i know you're getting
[1:30:35] tired too i'm trying to finish here but
[1:30:36] this is so good i just gotta just let me
[1:30:38] enjoy this moment i've been i've been
[1:30:39] dreaming about this moment for months by
[1:30:41] the way that's one preacher so hard
[1:30:43] oh my thank god
[1:30:45] hebrews 12.
[1:30:48] verse six
[1:30:50] i'm sorry verse five and you've you've
[1:30:51] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:30:53] unto you as in the children my son
[1:30:54] despise not the chastening of the lord
[1:30:56] now that's actually whipping and
[1:30:57] spanking it's whipping
[1:31:00] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
[1:31:03] see a real man don't a real man a woman
[1:31:05] of god they don't mind being rebuked as
[1:31:06] long as they're getting corrected the
[1:31:07] right way
[1:31:09] verse six for whom the lord loveth he
[1:31:12] chasteneth and scourgeth every son
[1:31:15] except prophets whom he receiveth wait
[1:31:17] did i did i read that right
[1:31:19] no i added the words and prophets
[1:31:22] he
[1:31:24] let me read it again
[1:31:25] and he scourges every son whom he
[1:31:28] receiveth
[1:31:29] everybody needs correction
[1:31:33] and if you endure chasing in verse 7 god
[1:31:35] dealt with you as sons for what son is
[1:31:37] he whom the father chasteneth not
[1:31:40] if not you're a bastard child
[1:31:42] let's stand to our feet
[1:31:44] as the musicians come let me read this
[1:31:46] church
[1:31:47] they say who are you god's prophet
[1:31:50] brother branham said his wife was his
[1:31:52] correction too
[1:31:56] so you're saying a preacher can't
[1:31:58] correct by the brahman only his wife can
[1:32:00] well that means sister media ought to
[1:32:01] take a text and preach if she can
[1:32:03] correct the prophet of god
[1:32:05] huh
[1:32:07] you see how ridiculous these people are
[1:32:09] they are so self-satisfying brother
[1:32:11] william they're so scared to study and
[1:32:13] they're scared to pray they're scared to
[1:32:15] look in the bible that'll be the best
[1:32:17] thing we do every day amen
[1:32:19] is look in the bible praise god
[1:32:23] instead of hiding behind what who are
[1:32:24] you to protect god's prophet i'm so holy
[1:32:27] i don't i don't got to read my bible i
[1:32:29] just got to press play what a liar
[1:32:32] that's your job
[1:32:34] you're neglecting your job you're
[1:32:36] supposed to read the bible
[1:32:38] hallelujah whom the lord loves he
[1:32:41] rebukes and chastens
[1:32:43] he chastens every son
[1:32:47] hallelujah
[1:32:48] every son
[1:32:51] he corrects them all
[1:32:53] because we all need to possess the land
[1:32:55] amen we all need to get back up after a
[1:32:58] ai defeat
[1:33:00] hallelujah and clear out any gold wedges
[1:33:03] in our lives right
[1:33:05] any silver coins in our lives and the
[1:33:07] church said
[1:33:08] any babylonian garment right i read that
[1:33:11] this morning that was my scripture
[1:33:12] reading this morning anything that we've
[1:33:13] kept in our house is not pure god's got
[1:33:16] to clean it out and then we're marching
[1:33:17] on the victory
[1:33:21] the only thing you don't need correction
[1:33:22] on is thus saith the lord
[1:33:27] and even on those brother bang people
[1:33:29] wonder
[1:33:30] the brown bear was thus saith the lord
