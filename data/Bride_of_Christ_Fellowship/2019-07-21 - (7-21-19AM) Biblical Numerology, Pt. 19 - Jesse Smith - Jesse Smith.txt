for these blessings Lord God and minister to us today by the word open it to us that we can understand and believe it Lord God applied to our lives Lord speak the word Lord God live the word and we'll give you the glory in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise God let's take our Bibles this morning I like to go to Luke chapter 10 verse 1 Luke chapter 10 verse 1 greet you on the name of the Lord Jesus and we had a good time last night went to Albion Pennsylvania for a little youth banquet and got home at midnight but it was well worth it Lydia had a great time and got to hear some good preaching and they did a nice job just kind of ministering to the youth there and really enjoyed it by God's grace so Luke chapter 10 verse 1 as our children get older you know my mind is filled with thoughts about well what should we do for our youth and and that was a good example last night but I also want to have prayer for the youth you know I think I think it's good to have hot dog roasts it's good to have banquets but the main thing we need all of us is prayer so we got to have a time of Prayer and consecration as the Lord leads you know we'll see what the Lord leads us but excited about that by God's grace Luke chapter 10 verse 1 I like to speak to you on biblical numerology this morning and there's a lot of you know thoughts that I know the Holy Spirit will help us with this is part 19 I think it will finish hopefully with the the series all buds been an enlightening series for you it's been a tremendous series for me to see all the the numbers and their meanings in Scripture but also what they mean to me in my life and hopefully in your life as well by God's grace Luke chapter 10 we'll just read verse 1 and 2 we're going to start with the number 60 and then work our way up to 70 and we'll work our way up to 200 million today by God's grace so that's at least at least in my notes so we'll see what the Lord has for us here Luke chapter 10 I'll read verse 1 and then we'll all read verse 2 so I'll read verse 1 alone after these things the Lord appointed other seventy also so he had twelve that he sent out and then other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city in place whither he himself would come so the disciples would be the first pole right or the we say the former rain and then Jesus Christ would come and be the latter rain verse two let's read it together on three one two three therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he may send forth laborers into his harvest amen I'm going to be a laborer in the harvest of Christ everybody is a laborer some our missionary Labor's like this but there's mothers and our laborers there's father's and Labor's grandparents their singles adults you know there's all children can be laborers in the kingdom of God so may God as blessings the reading of his word may be seated here I do have quite a few slides here this is the I have this sermon ready all week just kind of ready to preach it so thankful to the Lord for giving us grace today how many happy to be in the house the Lord today raise it or not I've seen this before Sir Anthony Antony well let's give Andy around pause a little s yes sir we've seen you before correct yeah I thought you look familiar phrase the Lord oh no really it's your first time okay I'm sorry then forgive me I'm sorry my fault you look familiar but God is good praise the Lord well hope you enjoy the worship today and then we had a really good song service this morning thank you musicians for that and we're happy to be in the house of Lord today nor willing tonight though I think I want to look at the kingdom of God in the kingdom of heaven tonight I was doing some studies on that yesterday and just pulling up a bunch of scriptures I've seen some things I just never really looked looked and seen it that way before now we'll preach on that unless we have our visitors like we had last week and then they requested how to know the voice of God and how to hear from God so if our visitors come I'll preach that way and we'll look at you know he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says we'll look at that and how the Spirit always sends a prophet it was always point to the word sow nor willing we can look at that if our guests show up tonight so we'll see we're just happy when people come and want to join us you know and we're just I just get excited you know whether no matter who's here I'm excited to serve the Lord Amen let's look at part 19 and and God will speak to us I'm sure through these numbers so we read our text and we read the text of 70 because I have a lot of 70 scriptures and as the numbers have gotten bigger you know I'm not able really to pinpoint down exactly what that number represents but perhaps a later time you know one thing is for sure an eternity God will show us what each one meant but the little ones you know the smaller numbers we can we can clearly see what they all mean as we get to even up to 20 you know in 21 expectation and you can see all those clearly marked in Scripture but as you get bigger there's there's fewer examples and it's a bit more difficult but let's start at 60 you know and from 60 up I don't have a whole lot of meanings but we can at least show the scripture and you can you can start to see maybe what God is saying through some of these numbers so 60 you know Nebuchadnezzar's image was 60 cubits tall in Daniel chapter 3 verse 1 Ezra's latter house was 60 cubits high and 60 wide and of course we know remember the glory of the the the latter would be greater than the former right because the the latter would have Jesus Christ amen it was speaking of that Christ would come to the Jews eventually praise God and that would be a greater house than the houses even Solomon built praise God so God was trying to show them don't be so excited about the house because a greater greater house is coming in fact the Bible says in the in the New Jerusalem there will be no temple because Jesus Christ is the temple amen I'll say like this every one of us will be a temple in the head God will eternally abide in you and I hallelujah and so you see you know we're just we just seeing numbers here and let's look at them Solomon this is interesting Solomon had 60 mighty men of valor rather than thirty David at 30 Salman had 60 behold his bed which is Solomon's threescore valiant men are about it of the value of Israel of course again showing David and Solomon of course you know Solomon representing the millennia and how great how much greater the Millennium will be than these earthly dwellings praise God these earthly than even the kingdom of God here on earth it'll be so much greater song Song of Solomon 3:8 they all hold swords being expert in war every man had this sword upon his thigh because of fear and the night amen so we see numbers of 60 60 was the second highest yield of the seed in Jesus's parable of 60 fold here remember this these are the bride members foolish merging camp bringing forth fruit unto God because they're not fully quickened by the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God they can be saved but they don't have the incorruptible seed Word of God and that because of the cares of the world they're foolish and their lives get choked out by the cares of the world and they don't bring forth real fruit unto God but 60-fold is also 3/5 which 3 and 5 are good numbers there I don't have the understanding I don't want to presume either I want to wait too I really know something or see a pattern so people's lives will Holy Ghost filled saints lives will do thirtyfold sixtyfold a hundredfold upon what they were given praise God and my messages and my heart's been on lately - for you and I to find our purpose in life and don't let anything distract us from our purpose devote ourselves fully in the purpose of God for our lives until we see fruit brought forth and sometimes it'll be a year five years ten years in fact I was talking to the missionary no I'm sorry something - the Evangelist yesterday brother Nathan and he just got back from Uganda and he said for years the the small message churches in Uganda were doing a radio ministry of just publishing brother brands you know just having talking about brother brand playing brother branham in Uganda and for years I think he said 10 or 15 years they got really no response and they were almost ready to give up and then brother Nathan said all of a sudden the Holy Ghost struck the country of Uganda and he said the pastures are coming in from the conference saying we are having churches by the hundreds Pentecostal Uganda churches receiving the water baptism in the Lord Jesus Christ and receiving God's prophet amen and now there he said their radio ministry is so great they can hardly maintain and keep up with all the calls but it just sat dormant for years and years and years and years until the time God said now I'm gonna bring forth fruit see man waters and man plants and man waters and plants and then God gives the increase amen that's what we've got to do you know our churches here 13 years and we just got to keep watering and laboring and planting and even if God doesn't give us a great number I tell you we got great quality here because it's more about the quality not the quantity praise God because you can go down this road 77 and I promise you you'll pass numerous mega churches on the way and they got a lot more quak quak quantity but they don't got the quality of the Holy Ghost amen had to live the real life of Jesus Christ amen so I just want to encourage you with that that was such a blessing to me like mine I just got to keep on the fire lines keep investing keep focus on your calling keep dedicating yourself to that and suit it and soon you'll see the increase and let me even say like this the Bible said those in the Old Testament many of those died and didn't see the fruits of their labors so some of us may not see the fruits of our labors so the thing to do is have a revelation of your purpose in life and dedicate yourself to that and know there's some day there'll be a payday praise God amen there'll be a payday at some point whether on this side or that side amen invest in in the talents God's given you praise God you know I just reminded me of a scripture here let me see if I can pull it up real quick I was just this week where the Bible says some men's sins go before them that's Paul you know st. Paul yeah so right there it is okay Gloria kind of fits right here first Timothy 5 I'm gonna turn there you don't have to turn there unless you want to in your Bible I got to read it straight from my scripture here first Timothy 5 now Paul ends this chapter here first Timothy 5 24 it's not this slide but it is that same chapter but first Timothy 5:20 for some men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment like you go is use Adolf Hitler ever example and Judas some of the some men's sins are just so obvious and some men they follow after some men and women are not so obvious which side they're on right because my man said there be a lot of surprises at the Day of Judgment a lot of especially right is this applies especially to preachers and in either message churches our denominational they can act all holy like the Pharisees but jesus said you're of your father the devil right they hide their city so you look beautiful on the outside but inward you're full of dead men's bones but some man you know women you can see right away which side there are they're there under the devil's side and and they bring forth all kind of incorruptible fruit but Paul says not all are like that some men we won't see their sins until the day of judgment well verse 25 likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand glory sometimes God lets you see people's Labor's and their fruits of their labors on this side praise God but there's the part here and they that are otherwise cannot be hid okay so it's the same thing just as some people's sins are so obvious and yet some are hidden so it is with rewards and fruit some men see their fruit on this side and other men see it won't see it on this side they'll see it on the other side how many can say praise the Lord that's right let's go to Hebrews 11 since we're there I just want to pull that scripture up so you can see it again many men died without receiving the promise look at verse 38 I just love reading this is one of my favorite verses in the Bible I think of whom the world was not working you know Church some of the people's testimonies of serving Jesus Christ are so powerful they're full of such sacrifice that the world is not even worthy to be with them they're just so they're just so sacrificial they they give up so much for the kingdom of God that the world isn't even worthy to be around them that's what the Bible said these were the ones that were stoned like Stephen those Pharisees weren't even worthy to be around a man like that amen he was so filled with Jesus Christ that the angels of God the Angels glory shone on his face amen hallelujah a man that could stand in the midst of criticism amen in the midst of rejection in the midst of hatred he could stand there and offer them the circumcision of the Holy Ghost but he says your hearts are uncircumcised and the Bible said they were stoned and they were sawed asunder and they wandered around in sheepskins and goatskins and the wave wasn't even worthy of men and women like that amen they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth think of Elisha the world wasn't even Jezebel they had won even worthy to be around him right he wandered off to a cave all by himself they weren't even worthy he was such a godly man Amen see sometimes you know sin will cause you the sin of other people will cause you to separate yourself and you'll feel sorry about it but all reality God's saying they're not worthy to be around you amen and I'm not talking pride I'm talking humility praise God you're such an assignment it's separate a purse for your loan but you're really not alone because Christ is with you Amen Alleluia and the wave is not even wave and it was God doesn't want you to be the foul God doesn't want them to try to stain you and tempt you know those things they says I'm going to separate you and we'll have some fellowship alone amen I'm going to separate you into myself hallelujah amen dens and caves where Elijah here that still small voice in the cave Church all by himself God said I wasn't in the earthquake I was in the fire I was in the wind I was in the still small voice I was in that voice when you overload that strengthen your heart I was in that voice amen you thought I wasn't oh the noise and all the chatter and all that but I was actually in that secret place with you a man like the holy of holies Amen very house Elijah's little holiest of holies aren't you glad for those times of the Lord verse 39 and these are having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise their whole lives they were saying I'm gonna reach the promise some day I'll reach the promise some day I'll reach a promise and they get down to the last few minutes and realize I didn't receive the promise but God must have whisper in their ear but you will one day you will see it on this side you'll see it on the other side Oh hallelujah they died not seeing the promise but the Bible said verse 40 but God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen they were going to see their promise when we're all gathered together amen well that marriage supper of the Lamb amen they're gonna see that promises then hallelujah that's where they are going to see it hallelujah like we know with Cornelius his memorials were before God his prayer arms and passing that was a memorial before God maybe he didn't see that reward but the angel saw it I wonder which angels of walk around heaven same I look at sister Connie's vow of prayers and good deeds in alms amen and we're like we gotta ever done anything for you but God seen every prayer you prayed amen not seen every person you helped out financially that you hardly hang up there but dad seen everyone Amen if the Angels can witness to us this morning they would tell us don't meet a scourge there's a reward up there amen God sees everything you did and whether you see the promise now later heaven doesn't miss a thing amen hallelujah God doesn't miss a thing although everybody else you may fire to the radar but in God's eyes in fact you're more important than all the preachers even the ladies even more important than the preachers you say prove that by the Bible I love to 1st Corinthians chapter 12 proves it the Bible says those that we see outwardly we give them more honor two and he's talking about the hand and the body but the Bible says God gives more honor to the inward parts who's the real heart and soul of the church is it just the preacher the outward one that everybody sees or is it the laity who's the inside who's the real heart of the church yeah amen who's the real so who's the one that God really really sees who's the real part the most important part is the laity is that right remember what does the Antichrist spirit do but America the Antichrist spirit tries to take all the Holy Ghost up and put it in the priest well the cats in the Catholic Church or the preachers are with me Church which board is more important which part is is it the preacher the ad the loyalty amen is the preacher yes we have an important part but we are not alone everybody must have anointing everybody must serve God everybody must be alive everybody must do their part well Barney praise God you can live without your finger if you get your finger amputated you can live without your arm but you'll not live without your heart amen you'll not live without your lungs you'll not live with out the inward parts of you church you might not see your rewards and your fruit on this side but God sees it amen hallelujah you might not even see in this life you might die in it like your life might look like a disgrace to the world but if you serve God and you invest in the kingdom of God thank God has a great reward for you so the thing to do is invest in the kingdom of God well I didn't plan on preaching that so I thank the Lord for the Hetzer verse 6 see Paul taught a widow is admitted to the distinction at 60 years old and not before that's a real strict requirements to be a widow in the Bible and then he rebuked the women that left the faith just to get married so God God had his prophets say listen you got to be faithful he said you got to wash the Saints feet if you want to be a widow and get daily helping all these things you got to meet all these requirements I don't quite understand that myself but that's what the word says now 66 I'm not sure but there's 66 in the Bible books rather Isaiah has 66 chapters program said Isaiah is a small mini Bible I just got done reading that this year jacob 66 people in the egypt just from his family a mother was purified after giving birth to a baby girl 66 days afterward interesting so I really get I can't see all of it you know a Bible the full testimony of God it's interesting so just thought I'd share that with you makes you think as your bridge your gears turning out there 7 now it looks to me like 70 represents laborers or workers that's what it looks like to me from the scripture because Joe Jacobs Souls and and Joseph Souls totaled 70 in Egypt the Bible says and what they go down here they go down there and they got in slavery God put and this is sure God put Moses's spirit on 70 elders that help them bear his burden to work oh god I need help God said I'll send you 70 workers to bear your burden and we know Jesus that God did the same thing for Jesus right he gave him 12 but then he said I'm gonna give you 7 I'm gonna send out 70 more hey now you know this group actually became what the Pharisees called the Sanhedrin Council right you know that probably if not now you know it but you know the Jews looked at that you know all those years after Moses and well we should have a saying he we should have a council they called the Sanhedrin Council so 70 was the number of labor the Bible says were given 70 years of lengths of years to labor the days of our years are threescore years and ten and if my reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away so david says praise the Lord you got seventy years if you're a little stronger the labor you'll get eighty ah holiday yeah I met third I'm almost at 40 church of almost halfway this is 280 oh my life is managing so I want to be serious I want to be devoted I want to be dead yet I want to invest because I know God was Labour's and this kingdom Amen so I've got to take care of my body but I got to eat healthier I got an exercise I got to take care of this body in order to make sure this body can serve Christ 70 years of captivity the Bible said or labor for Israel Babylon because Israel had neglected the Sabbath years so God said because you didn't let the land rest now you're gonna work for seven years as a slave mine that's striking and then that escape from the sword carried he away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia you have a reading in Jenna Maya Jeremiah prophesied of those seventy years you know that right church he was he was so many times thrown in jail so he was thrown in a miry pit I wonder if that's where we get the song he brought me out of the miry clay I just read that this week gentlemen Jeremiah was thrown in a miry pit and somebody had to say hey he's gonna die he's sinking in the mire if we don't save him to the King Zedekiah said fine go pull him out he threw him in there because his prophesying that Nebuchadnezzar was going to overtake Jerusalem and so they went off and got some old rag rusty rented rags wrapped it together throw him down they put him under his armpits and they pull him up out of the pit that's God's prophet right and preachers thing today well I gotta have a million dollars or God's not with me unless I I'm blessed and notion and not stress I'm stressed and not blessed or whatever they say foolishness whenever you take a stand for God's word you're gonna be rejected amen you're gonna suffer amen he was a real man of God and it was after the first time that he was incarcerated he said God I'm not going to talk for you anymore and he said all of a sudden there was a fire that come up not in the prison cell he was in a prison cell but amen but the fire wasn't in the prison cell he said the fire was shut up in my bones amen yet he's in the middle of a prison getting Starr getting one piece of bread every day amen the fire wasn't in the prison the followers in his soul hallelujah let persecution happen to you like that and me and then then let's get some fire in our souls then let's talk about fire in our souls but now you just have one little trial or then fire I feel the fire in my bones well that might be true but listen the real fire comes when you have a real trial amen these were real men of God these saints that law was not worthy of them how to do you suffered hated beaten locked up they were real men of God and women of God amen our lives pale in comparison as far as the physical this but we got the got the speed of the mind our mind battles are harder but our physical is not harder obviously and the church said so lets god help us or not to complain amen to fulfill the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her Sabbath for as long as she lay down so she kept sabbath to fulfill threescore and ten years my every year the priest would blow the trumpet through it's the seventh year gertrude give the land rest and they leave the church and say yeah right and the next monday morning they get out there around so actually sunday morning they get out there and they go plant and the priests are like I just told you you got a rest he's like well I'm gonna have food next year and the priest would be like but God promised amen trust is the promise of God and they did that for all those years and finally said that's fine God said this land needs rest and if you don't let it rest I'm sending you away for 70 years so this land can rest see how much God appreciates you and I to rest you have got to rest your body and mind you've got to take a vacation amen and spend it with Jesus Christ amen and the church don't leave the church because when people leave a church they get in big trouble now we know the real rest is the baptism the Holy Ghost that's the one we ought to be but Church most of us are born again here and if that's true then you need to rest your your body and not get overworked and stressed out so you can actually come to church and enjoy it [Music] hallelujah praise God program said this is an int do you realize I'm trying to realize this more MORE this is an insane age will go crazy if we don't rest our minds and bodies and shut down the Wi-Fi and shut down the notifications and just spend time meditating on the things of God go crazy the guy was showing this with the land you've got to let that land rest you've got to honor my word amen Jesus Jesus Christ had God in the flesh he was God in the flesh and the Bible said he would take time to leave and leave the multitudes and go up to pray Jesus Christ he had the greatest anointing on him right no man could have a greater 90 and he realized this anointing is great but my body's getting worn out hallelujah and I've got to give my body some rest and I've got to pray to my father and I've got to get a loan now it works best when you're in the prayer closet because that's where Jesus said go pray there to get in a place where you can pray and see God but don't neglect the house of God amen rest your body rest your mind 70 weeks the prophecy of Daniel which was actually 490 years until the culmination of Israel in the Millennium you know this the Bible said seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sin so see what's happening there's a lot of work going on here seventy weeks of work make an end of sin make a reconciliation all he's doing all these things and the last thing is annoying to the most holy and program said that's Jesus getting anointed or being the anointed priests in the new Millennial temple amen in Ezekiel 43 if you ever read I read this week that's Jesus being the anointed son of God the Son of David a man taking his position in the new Millennial temple to reign over all the earth for a thousand years amen at the end of the work of God amen that's the end of the 70 weeks of Daniel praise God that's where Israel finally is completed and now God's gonna have his one day with his bride his honeymoon well Jewish and Gentile bride honeymoon amen because Christ is now finished Christ is anointed most holy in the temple praise God we this from our text Jesus sends out 70 additional what were they Labour's and he said my there's so many souls out there the harvest is great but the laborers are few remember the Bible said God will not lose one if you feel the pole to be a laborers do something then you better make sure it's God right there's a scripture I want to bring out to get your Bibles here handy look look at this it's in the New Testament let me look it up this was so striking to me I just sat there and stare at the computer Luke chapter 9 jesus' window of ministry church was so small that when he invited people to join his preaching team will say like that or his church they had to make a decision on the spot and church every times maybe God will may give that decision to you we're so urgent you have to do the will of God right luke 9:62 but actually let's go to 57 that's where we want to go and it came to pass and as they went in the way a certain man went said unto Him Lord I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest now Jesus had not sent out the 70 yet so these men he's gonna call he's inviting them to be a part of the 70 labors oh my goodness and this man says I'll go wherever you go you go Jesus because he saw the miracles he thought prosperity prosperity so how does Jesus humble him and make him realize this ain't all about miracles boy verse 50 and Jesus said unto him you're gonna raise the dead cast out devils be a millionaire the member he's always the word right he's always discerning people's motives and objectives amen he's like I'll do whatever you want we got to be careful Church when we say that I'll do whatever you want Jesus huh sacrifice anything you want you better be careful what you say because he's going to prove it to you the Bible said he proves all the hearts look at that foxes have holes so this man was thinking about palaces and that's what the Pentecostals thought about brother branham will take your message to the big up-and-up so oh my goodness he's there the big nerve centers number lookup nerve centers let's go to big panic elitism sins embracing Jesus though it's not the castile pearls before swine he said well that's a tough one right there see brother Manu many of those organizations were only interested in money and when it came down to the word water baptism so fancied women now preach it holiness modesty all these things but a man knew that these were poles and they would just step on them so why does Jesus correct this young man has got all this now you would think this and for me this would be the kind of person I want to come to our church well Jesse I'll do anything you ask me to do I kind of get excited things about that right now what have you come up every Church to say brother well I'll do anything you told me what to do I'll do it and what does Jesus say foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head see he's discerning spirits here listen if you follow me you ain't gonna have a home it ain't gonna be easy it's the hard road see the way of miracles we want to see more miracles we got to get more dedicated to God we have to be more dedicated it's a hard road it's more it's more sacrifice right it's more dedication verse 59 and he said another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father but Jesus has already said seek ye first the kingdom of God amen haha he said let me first do this and Jesus said no no there's a short little window here amen now he knew jesus knew seventy we're going to leave him eventually too in John chapter 6 when he started preaching about you know my body is bread and my brother's wine they all walked away and said this guy's this message is just too much I can't handle this sir fancy talk what do you mean serpent Apple it wasn't an apple what do you mean it was a sex act that's exactly right and geez didn't even turn around explain it he just said go if you get it if you've seen all these miracles if you've seen me live a godly life amen and if there's enough to convince her than faith there's a no he turns around say you twelve want to go to but he knew those that were ordained he knew from the beginning who would believe in who wouldn't believe he knew there's a little flock that would stay with him because they loved and that's you and I today amen follow me sinto you see he put he put his family he put a funeral before the kingdom now don't get confused I went to a funeral this week funerals are part of the kingdom sometimes robe and did many funerals but Jesus saying you got a chance to be one of these seventy preachers now look Jesus must have known that this guy once he got home and had the funeral let's say it was his dad that passed away yeah well then who's gonna take care of the mom the son is that right so jesus knew with you go back you ain't gonna go out and preach with me and he might thought what Jesus is he's so mean who's gonna take care of my mom and Jesus said my Heavenly Father if God so clothe the grass of the field amen if God feeds the birds that don't even play how much more will God give you your needs oh ye of little faith they met oh my I wasn't expected to preachers today the Holy Spirit's here praise God that's not even my notes really that's that see he knew once he gets home he's gonna be pressured to stay there and he won't go out and be one of my preachers in my ministry and look he'd given a straight direction he didn't say consider following me he said follow me he didn't say pray about following me we got it's good we almost everything we knew we got do pray first right but here's the son of God saying follow me got one chance and they know was gonna be three and a half years or the short amount of time and so he says let the dead bury the dead he must have known they weren't spiritually alive to his message in his ministry I wonder if his guy was at when the Pharisee family they were spiritually dead right let the spiritually dead bury their physically dead amen Church it goes to show there's only life in the message of the hour amen glory the rest of them are dead but the current ministry we say like this the fivefold ministry there's only live in the message of the or the ministries of Jesus Christ is personally speaking through amen let the dead bury their dead the priests and the Pharisees and the Sadducees let them bury their dead follow me glory but go down reach the kingdom of God I don't think we're gonna get to the end of this message verse 61 another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first see that's the trouble we got with first everybody wants to be first above the kingdom of God and the church said you and I gotta make sure nothing comes before the kingdom of God being first that's why this church needs to be your first not me the church because this church is the ministry and it's extension of Jesus Christ body that's why you put the church before everything else only if you're a missionary you put other churches in front of this church hello that's what he says here that's he said first see there's a trouble at first everybody wants something else to be first my family's funeral in this case he said let me go say goodbye and so Jesus must have known when he went to say goodbye they were gonna plead with him and beg him to stay Jesus must have known he didn't have faith like Rebecca hahaha I got one chance and she said I'm out of here right I'm going to see my husband I feel the poor but Jesus must have known this guy could have been persuaded to stay around I can't leave my little brother can't leave my little sister I'll preach when I'm older no this was the time where this was done see God visited him in a personal visitation and let me say like this when God visits you in a personal visitation that's the time you just surrender all right so you know which are at home at my house sees my is his house is more important in God's house let me first go to my house and say goodbye see God's house has got to be number one it isn't my house praise God Wednesday Sunday is the highlights of my week of my life come in the house of God being with the body of Jesus Christ feeding the body of Jesus Christ and to find the body of Jesus Christ amen that's we're all here to edify one another praise God verse 62 and Jesus and him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God oh my goodness see how imported is and church you know you don't know it you'll know the the moment when God's asking you to surrender all you'll know it they would have had to known because remember Jesus of the certain thoughts intents of the heart so this man must have been having a mind battle here it's just my time to follow Christ sir he must been deal with that and then Jesus says no you got a you've got a work hard and you got to follow me and don't look back you must then have him battles about should I go back and Jesus must have discerned exactly his thoughts and so he known my art was discern I've got to go with Christ and that's what happens to you when you got a question in your heart and the Word of God comes and you're here sincerely you confess all your sin and the Word of God discerns your situation you and I need to obey the Word of God we know bei what the word says you and I should know if it's discerning our hearts if you can say well there's a greater than Jesse Smith here and there always is when Christ is here because I'm nothing amen no preachers anything bender on or cam Smith there's there's no other greater you and I should know when Jesus Christ is dealing with our hearts amen we should be able to say this is the time what if that I'm a so member and Konica falls in 2006 when I was praying God show me if I we should start a church and I thought should be the pastor I was praying I was just sitting on the toilet I think I just you know gave Lydia bath and she was there and uh you know she sees there in a bath I'm just sitting there reading my Bible and she's all playing in her towel I think Malachi was on the way I said God have been praying about this for so long should we start a church am i and I asked God Lord of mine mature enough to be a pastor and I just my Bibles - one time I did the Bible roulette and I went like this and I open it up it was first Timothy let me go there real quick so I can quote it and that's not the way it works for everybody but yes first Timothy 4:12 my eyes weren't right - that it was oh it wasn't in this Bibles in a different Bible it was the only thing highlighted on the page my eyes aren't right - that let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in Word in conversation in charity in spirit and faith and purity till i come give attendance to reading exhortation to doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery amen and I base this whole thing on that scripture praise God now to me but here that was the moment Jesus saying come follow me I could have said well let me move back home first and start a church I could've made all of these excuses wait till we get more than just seven people you know bang was one of the seven well you're one of the original seven praise God sevens completion he's one of the original pillars and he's still a pillar praise God start a church with seven people that's what the Word of God said Amen that's what God's Way and led us to do and that was my moment like either turn back or I could follow Christ and so I decided to follow Jesus Christ now the reason I say that it's not to prop me up or this church but to let you know there will be times in your life when you know God is speaking to you and he'll give you a choice either this or that and I say surrender Amen neighbor for the kingdom of God seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these other things will be added that has been my story God has added everything I needed since I've done that have I had all times sure but nothing too hard that the Holy Ghost can't give me victory in hey glory now if the Bible the next yeah so we read Luke nine that's how the chapter ends Jesus saying that he's calling people to the seventy they're saying no I can't go I can't go making all these excuses and then finally invert chapter 10 he finds 70 that he can send out so I'm letting you know there's times in your life where you'll know God's dealing with you and you have to surrender and you won't have time to go to your funeral because you're doing the will of God praise God you won't have time to go back and say goodbye because God's got a work for you and he's testing your faith listen Church you don't know one of the reasons Peter got the keys to the kingdom God knew he was gonna he was gonna deny him God knew all these things but one of the reasons God saw fit to give Peter the keys to the kingdom because when Jesus walked by he said Peter follow me you know what he did he didn't take his nets and say oh let me put these in my backpack and I'll go with you the Bible said he was in the middle of fixing the Nets was he not and the Bible said he dropped it like a bad habit and his dad was sitting right there amen and John's dad Zebedee was sitting right there James and John and they literally walk away and said I just feel anointed to follow that guy and godly look so he's gonna have mistakes he's going to be a little kind at times but wants to get the Holy Ghost he's gonna have the keys to the king baby because he lost oh he turned and he didn't look back amen he saw his face to the prow did he stumble sometimes a bird on the ground and make a fool of himself yes sometimes you will too but never look back never give up surrender and follow Jesus Christ very men are some anointing here today amen the vagueness wasn't in any of my notes some anointing here today these are my notes I don't have any other notes you know Saint imitated 70 know that remember this zqa God said Ezekiel I'm going to show you the abominations in Israel they start at the outer gate on the second step they go into the image chambers of imagery this is the second out of four step because remember there's four horse riders there's four stages to the Antichrist spirit there was the same thing in the Old Testament just like by man so there's seven church age in the Old Testament I got to study on that I've never studied on that but I'm starting to see mind there's so many parallels here there's 70 ancients of Israel that burn incense and the chambers of imagery as the second out of four abominations it seemed to impersonate the 70 elders of Moses and the Bible said there was there in the chamber there was images abominable images all over the walls and the 70 men they're worshipping see it's Satan imitating 70 70 looks good its Labour's but see they were laboring for selfish gain labor late labor they were laboring for the pleasures of sin remember Hebrews 11 said Moses chose not to take the pleasures of sin for season so these 70 must have been benefiting money-wise or maybe pride or popularity wise they must been benefiting from having all these abominations in their church that sounds preachers today they let abominations go in their church as long as they're making the big bucks as long as they're being popular I say God keep us small keep us little do whatever you have to do let the Holy Ghost be here that always be filled with grace and mercy amen the halls that be covered with sin and debauchery and evil abominations they'll ever be covered with the bread of Jesus Christ amen see there were 70 workers but they were working for abominable purposes abominable just remember the last one was Sun worship and moon worship idolatry and that's a lot a lot what we got today people idolized brother branham so you got we got apply it to today how is it today we can't really idolize Jesus really so they got to idolize something that's close to Christ they idolized something right there so there are lies on something that she shouldn't be idolizing now in the book I've been reading Bellinger skips all the way from 70 to 120 but there's numbers in here I just want to lay in here okay bear with me I'm just gonna go through here God called Abram at 75 the church if you haven't got your calling yet just wait on God sweet right he knows the right time to call you some reason God wanted to him to be 75 and then giving a call Moses was let older he was Haiti when he finally got the call to come down and deliver Egypt just you stay at your post of duty just keep waiting on the Lord you'll know when he's calling you they got a TI like this they got 80 years of rest after Eva delivered them 80 years of rest praise God I'll say like this church I honestly feel people have been asking me as I go to different place like cams Church and Pennsylvania last night they're like how's everything going and like I don't really like their asking how's it going at the church and what's come to me is just we've had a period of rest haven't had like major battles right like in the church and I think thank the Lord because you might not have seen it but last year had some major battles it was verified by dreams amen and by the word and so I look at it as God's giving us some time of rest so during the time of rest what you do pray enjoy the word hear the word feast on the word grow up because there's coming to battle church that always days we know we don't know where but we got to be ready and we got to be strong we gotta be solid we gotta gather more together we gotta be closer together we got to be real solid Christians amen this program said God got program even told the tabernacle God or Saint won't let you stay that sweet group he'll send somebody he'll inject somebody with some poison and send him into you so we better watch who joins a church in the next few months and maybe he'll never said if Satan can't inject somebody already in the church you'll inject somebody with the poison and send them in remember he said 80 years of your life if you're strong Moses called to 80 and that's in there some 80 years of rest Anna was 84 the prophetess when she gave thanks at Jesus circumcision along with Simeon I don't know how old Simeon was though the own the Bible and tells us she was 84 and she was a real widow to imagine that 84 years but a man she waited and finally at 84 she gets the hold the Son of God she gets to hold God in flesh my 84 years old all those and the Bible said what was her ministry church she served the God with what prayers and fasting what's my purpose in life sometimes we wonder maybe it's come to the church and praying fast when nobody's here read your Bible that maybe for a day but let's not say that we don't need to do that we need to do that maybe that's some of your ministry to come here to church you got a day off are you something like that you come to church you pray and fast you shut in with God and you make that your ministry your reward will come gory just like Anna's reward came your reward will come might be when you're 84 Caleb was 85 when he took his Mountain amen and he said I'm just as strong now as I was then Moses called me Amen hallelujah he had to wait 45 years you know he was 45 when they called him now 80 six Abrams age when Ishmael was born blares at eleven there's that 11 because 11 can be good loving can be the last call 11 can be confusion there was confusion right there 11 11 years after he was called I don't have time to write that down all right Jesus left the 99 to get the other one and Abraham was 99 when God discerned Sarah's heart I'm not I don't know how those go together 100 Abraham's age when Isaac was born a hundred Isaac was blessed a hundred fold in career sewing in that land can you imagine you put a hundred plants in the ground and now you got a thousand one hundred fold a hundred fold you multiply that our God is great church I don't know if those plants multiply like that or if God just supernaturally planted a hundred times more but that's what the Bible says amen 100 we'll give this a hundred Israelis would put ten thousand to flight in the promised land as long as they kept out idols that's wrong it's not on it's out idols one hundred shekels of silver paid a father for bringing evil name upon a virgin so if a man a young man came around and spoke evil about a virgin and they finally lied you had to pay a hundred shekels of silver to redeem that name 104 skin saw requested of David to marry ICO but we know he brought two hundred a hundred prophets that Obadiah hid from Jezebel well what about him what a man of God right there he saved a hundred Souls from being slain by Jezebel that's how I'm gonna I'm gonna hide people away from that Jezebel system a sorry under the total number of sheep before one left one hundred reward for those who've left out for Christ in this world in the world to come that's what Jesus Peter said Lord at the Richard ruler he said Lord we've left all what about us and he said you'll receive a hundredfold in this life and the life to come praise God one hundred fulness of the seed that fell in the ground see how hundreds teams represent fruitfulness maybe I don't know there's something with that because Isaac was 100 percent or 100 fold fruitless or fruitfulness hundredfold reward 100 fruitfulness of the seed a hundred pounds of myrrh and aloes that Nicodemus brought for Jesus body to be buried oh I know he's going to get 100 full reward anytime you honor the word God's gonna honor you amen glory now I skip right up because after 100 them near so I could find is 120 there's 120 souls up in the upper room on day of Pentecost there's 120 is the full length of a human life God told that to Manila in Genesis 6 144 the wall in the future home is 144 cubits high just the wall and a cubit is a man's distance a Israelite man from his elbow to his middle finger 144 those tall that's just the wall 200 David his men brought back 200 foreskins 276 souls were in the ship with Paul all escaped to land 153 fish caught by Peter and the Apostles after Jesus resurrection now this is interesting 153 is 17 times 9 9 can mean fruitfulness because there's nine fruits of the spirit that's interesting 17 is the bride's number we showed that by the scripture for 17 nations there on the day of Pentecost 17 that's when God birthed its bride and Bollinger nodded and I didn't go through all hundred he listed all hundred 53 in his book he said there's a 153 people that directly interacted with Jesus Christ that received blessings from him in the four Gospels like if he went and he listed everyone I wasn't gonna have all the time to read all that but that's what he says that would make sense because it's it's like the people are coming to him you know the bride stands before his face you know they interact with him they're part of the body that would that would seem to be spiritual 300 is the size of Gideon's army after the final deduction remember they went down from 23,000 to 300 and they got stronger as they got smaller that's how the bride's gonna be Church she's gonna be smaller and smaller smaller but she's gonna get stronger and stronger and stronger right because that will give God glory big numbers will but a small minority that's trusting in the Living God allows God to get the glory 300 is the length of the measurement of Noah's Ark lengthwise 400 years Israel was an Egyptian Monday slavery I don't know what that's all about sorry about that that's not that would be awful Monday 400 years in Monday that'd be an awful Monday I hope that's not what tomorrow feels like for you 430 years after going into Egypt God gave the law to Moses remember that a little extra time because they wouldn't accept Moses 450 years Israelite judges until Samuel the Prophet came over 50 years mine 490 times to forgive your brother according to Jesus 490 years God was giving Israel to the consummation 500 one creditor owed five hundred pence the other owed 50 though and that's the unprofitable servant he was forgiven five hundred but he couldn't forgive somebody at 50 Church if anybody's sinned against you please forgive them that's tonight forgive if that brother doesn't that friend doesn't come tonight we'll look at that this is one of the parables of the kingdom of heaven this is why people won't be in the bride because the bride is for the kingdom of heaven is for the bride right you have to be a bride member to be a part of the kingdom and fill with the Holy Ghost people don't receive the Holy Ghost many times because they won't forgive other people the Bible said that's roots of bitterness see that's a weed and that's the third heart condition amen where the weeds choke up the plant and it can't bring forth fruit this is a parable of the Kingdom of Heaven 500 you're forgiving 500 miles pray and I started crying I was praying up here now as we were praying for service and the scripture came to me she that's forgiving much love much why do you love Jesus so much does he forgave Mia so much I just got a little bit of forgiving to do but he forgave me of everything oh yeah that's a tenth right that's a tenth all right guys I'm asking you forgive he's got to given you a parallel you just got to forgive a tenth of the amount that I got to forgive and you won't even forgive somebody a tenth of what I forgave you know Jesus was seen above five hundred men at one time after his resurrection interesting Noah was 600 years old when the flood started 666 is the number of a man that Antichrist be careful a day it's the Pope's title 666 john 6:66 70 of jesus disciples left him solomon received 666 go towns in one year and look what it did to him Church look what it did to him he backs that he married all those women the Bible said his women turned his heart away from God and the wrath of God rested on him he built a temple to every Idol that there was Church we got to be careful that we don't give an hour to this idol an hour to that Idol and three hours to the the New England Patriots Idol hallelujah right or all of our money to the fashion store they have the latest fashions you must not give it away we must build the kingdom of God amen see it's it's connected they're the Antichrist spirit got in Solomon's ministry now just know with Goliath these numbers do not add up to 666 you just have three sixes everyone understand this doesn't add up to 666 so don't try oh you'll be embarrassed like I was he had six years height was six cubits six pieces of armor and his spear head was 600 so it only adds up to 612 if you count the numbers but we're just sliding the six here and the six there and you can see okay Goliath kind of represents the Antichrist spirit David represents Christ he slays Antichrist spirit Nebuchadnezzar again this does not add up to 666 but you see three sixes their height was 66 cubits broad and six musical instruments mentioned and that of course is a type of the Antichrist spirit we know that because it's the last one of the it was in the Gentile kingdoms right they're gonna make an image to a man pry the Pope could be brother branham right they're gonna make a holy man they got a bow down and worship him a thousand years of peace in the Millennium a thousand women Salman had a hundred women who turned away his heart a thousand a day with God as as a thousand years with man one thousand five Salman had this many songs the Bible says 1260 days this is the same as forty two months or three and a half years this is the length of time with a Ministry of the two prophets and it's also the length of time of Israel's time in the wilderness now this is interesting I preached us years ago but it seems like after the ministry of the prophets of Israel after that raptured there's more time for Israel to receive Jesus Christ as Messiah because the Bible says right after this in Daniel 12 there's a hundred twelve oh sorry 1290 days instead of 60 and setup so there's like there's like another month from the time that daily sacrifices to be taken away unto the abomination that makes desolate set up so seems like Israel be sacrificing animals in their temple for three and a half years but after the prophets are taken away Rome will break the Covenant cut off the daily sacrifice and then a month later the abomination desolation that must be when the Pope walks in there I don't know I'm just that's based upon quotes I know whether Bram said he calls it the Roman domination desolation look at a Roman so Rome has to be Pope and the Pope's gonna send the temple of God saying he is God right so that's just my guess I'm just putting together I'm not trying to prophesy I'm just trying to put it together as a teacher you didn't hear me say they'll say at the Lord it's not insane now there's look there's even a longer time after this forty five more days after the abomination is set up the Bible said blessed is the man who for this number of days I wonder if that's the day they get borned again yeah yeah is the Bible said our nation will be born in one day hallelujah but they got to weep and more from house to house first and that's it we've been more than they receive Jesus Christ and the nations born in one day amen three thousand souls baptized this is beautiful on the day of Pentecost when the spiritual law was given oh you're under a law hey man I am under the law of the Holy Ghost you go to the church that's under the law of the Holy Ghost three thousand souls were saved on the day of Pentecost when the spiritual law was given up three hundred souls died when the natural law was being brought down from the mountain and Moses caught him worshiping a golden calf now there's a revelation in there calf represents a pastor because no man said a pastor as a ox that's interesting thought they exalted this golden calf interesting something in there just like there's something there's those two sevens the seven years of feasts the seven years of planning the seven years of famine I think that's Israel I think in their Old Testament church age God give them seven years or seven church age the great things but then when got when they rejected it now these seven Gentile year ages they've been having a famine because they're blinded to the gospel I could be wrong I'm just sharing that with you because first what do I know I've been praying for more revelation lately I know about you but I've been praying for more revelation because I want to know the things of God amen so 3,000 died when the natural laws coming down 3,000 were born again when the spiritual law came glory 3,000 prior spoken by Solomon 3,000 Kota mail weighed 5000 shekels of brass 5000 men were fed by Jesus America besides women and children just met 5,000 was the number of believers in the early church after the gate of beautiful miracles went from 3,000 to 5,000 after one miracle nah-ha goodness five thousand men Joshua set to ambush I remember he started battle at the gates and they chased him he started running away like he's like he's a coward and then after all the soldiers got out he blew the horn and the five thousand went in there in ambush I say hey man would have met what a mighty strategic warrior ten thousand five unknown words are better than ten thousand unknown now you go to penny penny Pentecostal church today you're gonna hear ten thousand unknown words but the sermon where they heard a thousand is better than those ten thousand there's more than there's ten thousand groups of ten thousand the Bible said ten thousands upon thousands Christ returned with ten thousands of his Saints at Armageddon thousands so groups of ten thousands come with Jesus Christ when he comes back at Armageddon 10,000 11,000 Joe owns seven thousand sheep three hundred three thousand cattles five hundred ox and five hundred female donkeys eleven thousand twelve thousand Jews sealed in each of the twelve tribes forty-four thousand that's the Jew sealed a hundred million on top of thousands of thousands of angels around the heavenly throne and the Bible says a hundred million thousand thousand and then on top of the thousands of thousands of angels round about the throne oh man this is the loneliest place we're ever going to be hundred million angels amen pres thousands of thousands of more hallelujah and they're all men they're all male angels messengers glory I can't wait to go open thank him thank you for protecting me when I travel last night almost fell asleep thank you for the angels of God protected me I wonder forget a chance to thank them 200 million the number of horsemen under the sixth trumpet two hundred thousand thousand who kill a third of the men by fire smoke and brimstone now I showed a few months ago if you put the quotes of other band together I don't think these these demons are already loose that's just my personal opinion some people think they are but if you put all the quotes together Bram said these trumpets can't even blow until the sixth seal so I don't know I could be wrong but I'm just saying that's just my opinion I don't think those two hundred million million or those tur million are actually loose yet but they could be they could be all right let's close with this oh my god playing time huh praise the Lord amen let's look at this if you wanna come my statutes and keep my commands and do them and you chase your enemies I'm sorry you shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword of the word now this is all natural I'm I just want to try to bring it to a spiritual there's so much power by the word that you and I speak and I said this earlier like I said last week you wouldn't have to be careful before we pronounce someone's healing but we don't have to be careful when we speak against sin in our lives because it is always God's will for you to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God it's never against perfect will for you and I to compromise and Sid and enjoy the lust of the flesh raise God but you better be careful like before I pray for other Brian last night he's got that degenerate condition his hips I stopped them they're about ready bow their heads I said brothers hold on I said mother Brian is there anything you need to confess because I got a lot of respect for brother Graham's words you can cast a demon off someone but if they're not life's not right you'll get in trouble with God you don't come back on him and go Jim said oh thank you Brian said oh yes thank you too he said I believe that quote he said my life's right with God so I said praise the Lord I'm expecting God answer Lord willing I'm not saying thus saith the Lord I'm saying Lord willing but that's the kind of respect for God that we have to have how many want that kind of respect I want it see five of you will chase a hundred I'm how many 117 people in here that's been baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ glory now there's some over there too yeah 17 is a good number in here but we got some over there we can't leave them out there bride to the is Joshua 23 now this is when they're in the land that you come out among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor calls to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them but Cleveland the Lord your God as you have done this day for the Lord I've driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you know that's better able to stand before you unto this day Joshua is dying and this is what he's saying no man has similar for our church because we've stayed with the word amen praise God what enemy are you facing today maybe you're a sold piece and the enemy's not great but if we're in obedience if our church and if your life is right with God who can stand before us and we know where the Joshua anti-type or the he was the type where the anti-type the Joshua army the ones were born again that have crossed over in the promised land of the basses of the Holy Ghost we're supposed to be at a for that Amen or anti type of that one man of you shall chase a thousand so now the number goes up right Leviticus was you know this 505 500 now it's one of you will chase a thousand for the Lord your God he it is that fight it for you as he hath promised for you amen remember we said it last week there's times God fights for you and there's times that God wants you to fight a little bit right there's times gotta knock down every foe in front yeah well thank you lord thank you lord thank you look I was all prepared for this battle this fight and God just knocked it out now I think but there's times God wants you to pick up the sword too you want you to stand up for the word quote the word believe the word so let's look at the equate or the ratios here it was 20 times the amount right then it was a hundred times the amount and now Joshua says it's a thousand times from 2200 to a thousand times in other words the power gets greater glory your power if I'm trying to bring this down just is your power to speak against temptations in your daily life amen we all have to come to church defeated or discourage or colder than God we can come to church on fire because God promised if you if you live clean if you obey the Word of God he said when these enemies come against you you just take out your Amen and one sister Connie can go out you can drive out 1,000 even scriptural church that look once they got in the land Sampson actually achieved the highest amount remember he's a type of the bride the glory he's through a thousand a dino slew eight hundred at one time a buyer killed three hundred at one time to see all these promises God was with them at the right time in season God anointed those who were obeying the Word of God to drive out the enemies if they would just obey the Word of God and here's the best one of all Jesus I love this jesus got all the Holy Ghost and he gets in the promised land and he comes to a Legion and the lexicon says there was a Legion was six thousand under 226 men amen so there's almost seven there's old almost 7,000 demons and all he says is go talk about anything go just sometimes Neil realize the power of just saying Satan get behind me in the name of Jesus Christ amen now the kingdom is about ready it's switch it over to spiritual Kingdom right God doesn't want us to go out and drive out you know a hundred Muslims in our neighborhood although we'd like to in our flesh if they're if they're if they're worshipping demons right but listen for us they were switching over but Jesus is showing us the spiritual application for sickness for demon-possessed people but also for daily temptations amen so the highest amount recorded that I could find was you'll drive out a thousand more with just one but Jesus ups to Andy he said it's almost one drives out seven thousand and let me you know he could've drove out seven thousand praise God he could've drove out a hundred thousand because he was God amen yeah the anointing he was always working in pure obedience but God is trying to show us the power of using this sword of the word against your daily temptations we don't have to be discouraged we're not to feel lost we have to feel we don't feel sorry for ourselves we can drive all those feelings out in the name of Jesus because the Bible said if God be for us who can be against us you got seven thousand demons and one Jesus Christ how can seven thousand be a they're not hard for God if God for me these seven thousand are really not against me they're against God and God will give me victory over them that's why these young people don't have to be discouraged I've heard people say well we're not gonna have kids because they're to see us so hard what a shame it's like they don't even know what the Bible says they don't even know what the Bible says this is our land amen this is not a demon's land this is all an amen this land is God's land this is the promised land whether we are afraid of children today have access to more power because there's more on religion there's more there's more maturity the photo particles will be in this world and that's the saith the Lord according to your prophet amen there's most of me afraid of the thing to do is get obedient to the Word of God and believe the promises of God and drive out the enemies before you I don't know how people can sit still preaching like this where they men I don't know when we got the word and we see what Christ did what can we do with it I've cast out demons out I think seven or eight people eight people but shirts most people are not going to be like that most people are like that don't want to be delivered so you're not going to catch the devil out of them anyway the thing to do is get the devil out of your mind amen we've got to get the devil out of our thinking because the Bible said neither give place to the Ephesians 4:23 don't give a place to the devil in your mind I'm trying to close most beautiful chapters in the Bible we know that so here's my conclusion I stay on our feet here's my conclusion I didn't think I'd make it through but I made it through praise to the heart I've been wanting to finish this series here have you enjoyed it as we're closed and think of those thoughts on the numbers earlier about investing in our our calling in life that would seem to be really led of the Holy Spirit there if you hear the call from Christ seek first the kingdom of God you might not see your reward by the way I'm on this side but if you pray you dedicate your life to God do what Jesus said pray in the closet fast like Ana you give alms like corneas oh you know there's going to be a reward in heaven someday praise God now my conclusion I just thought these numbers just speak to the greatness of God brother Brad said God is known through his numbers in other words we get to know God more and better as we look at numbers in the scripture and here I'm just closing with this thought on the greatness of God God is so great the Bible said the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way God's got a certain order you walked through of your life and God delights in your way if you walk in his way now look Church God even blesses the foolish virgin if she'll walk at least a virgin life she never walked up to Pentecost but at least she didn't walk with the wicked praise God David said better is one day in your courts than a thousand attend to the wicked Jesus this is after white throne judgment Jesus even say call me blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world remember they won't have leadership in the kingdom of God but they'll be a part of the kingdom the Bible said the foolish version will bring their glory and honor into the kingdom of God but because there again they don't have the degrees they don't have the fullness which can't make them earn rewards and it's not that we're trying to get rewards but listen Church we are trying to be faithful we are trying to do the will of the Father remember Jesus prayed that God pray that your godless and Labor's into his kingdom he wants us the labor amen glory he want so many that were labor and seek first the kingdom of God and that's the burden that we have keep laboring keep seeking God's kingdom first the Holy Ghost baptism the preaching of the word the message the hour put that first it's the Holy Ghost amen but God still blesses the foolish version for not dwelling in wicked places I'm not gonna read all this I kind of quote it earlier not one bird falls to the ground without your father we we've seen a couple of birds our cats been killing birds you know I thought of this Scripture I see the little bird bodies all around there God knows each one of those how much more does he know you and I but the very hairs of your head are numbered science says you have anywhere from ninety thousand to one hundred fifty thousand hairs and he's got each one of those numbered and each one you'll get back brothers or sisters usually its brothers 40% of men lose their hair each one you'll get back by God's grace doesn't this tell you the greatness of God's knowledge if he knows how many hairs each one has here there so nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days will I fulfill see God will fulfill your numbers of days on this earth if you obey and keep God's word God let you fulfill he won't take you early right like he did some he won't let you stay late either he liked Hezekiah he won't take your early likes all right he'll let you fulfill but you got to obey God's Word so teach us how many 1 only 1 this teach us to number our days how many want wisdom to number your days I was saying that I'm almost 40 I'm almost there I'm past the half mark ii ii ii i'm i've just got i'm looking like this man i got half my life left to give it all to Jesus Christ I just got half left I've given him a portion of my first half I got saved at 19 from 19 to 35 I gave him all those years I got half left to do all I can for Jesus Christ to meditate on his word to fulfill these scriptures and to preach and to teach and do everything I can I got half my life he left to do it a little less in half and if my strength I get 80 praise the Lord we already looked at that one remember church the Lord will perfect that which concerns me that means finished perfect means to finish God will finish everything that's concerning your life if he knows that hairs your head he knows the steps your order David he knows everything about you he'll feel perfected and it's the last one musicians if you'll come let's go to sing god of wonders let's sing that because that's what it reminds me of the Bible said praise you the Lord for it is good to sing praising our God for it is pleasant and his praise is calmly the Lord doth build up Jerusalem he gathered together two outcasts of Israel he heareth the broken and how many would say at some point your life gods healed your broken heart amen and by 'no thought their wounds anyone ever been healed we should praise the lord for that he binds up our wounds he tells the number of the stars and he calls them by name each hairs got a number you could examine that hair right they find like DNA on that hair okay it's got a number it's got a code god's put a stamp on that one so does every star got a name stamped on every star and he's talking about how he heals your hearts he heals your wounds he knows every star he cares about every detail of our lives he has ordered your steps in the gospel of jesus christ the Milky Way galaxy has one hundred thousand million stars ten to the twelfth power just in our little galaxy and Church then there's man's upon million of galaxies NASA this is NASA's best guests I believe it was NASA the number of stars is 10 to the 24th power remember the Bible said God is stretching out the heavens it's always expanding so that I mean our little machines can you imagine our little machines in our little maybe maybe 10 to the 24th powers part like 10 to the 115 million power but each one where the Amen has a name that God called Alston how much does God know your name - it's the greatness of God because the Bible said graters our Lord and of great power his understanding is infinite he understands what you're going through church he understands what you desire in your life he understands your name the hairs on your head the direction of your life he understands everything the thing we got to do is talk to him so he can help us understand our lives I say God give me your understanding I'm not gonna lean upon my own understanding I'm gonna seek the Lord because his understanding is infinite and Churchill do this today if you let him he'll lift you up you're discouraged he'll lift you up out of discouragement into encouragement praise God he'll lift you up he cast the wicked to the ground praise the Lord I could keep going up top stop right there let's sing God a Wunderlist thing about those stars praise now that was saying he knows my name praise God he knows the stars church she knows the hairs he knows the sparrow that falls he knows everything this is supposed to help us see the

Mary Magdalene he had that power he was in the promised land seven thousand or seven he can cast them all out Church how many did how many temptations can do have you passed down or cast down this past week how many times you've been tempted to do this or that but you've cast it down by the word how many have you cast down this month how many have you cast down this year you start thinking about all the power of the word to cast down temptation to steal or temptation to lie temptation don't think about how many times you cast out the enemy there's so much power in this word church he's made us more than conquerors our weapons are mighty to God to the pulling down of strongholds Eamon let's not leave here captive let's not leave here unsure let's not leave here weak sick let's leave here with power praise done because we're part of a kingdom of power amen that's one thing God once always wants you to do Jesus said I always do that which please the father God always wants you to cast down temptations and not give in to it so if you desire prayer you're welcome to come up here blessing that he knows my name praise God he knows the stars by name he's got to know your name to
