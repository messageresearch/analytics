[27:37] i've just got tons to preach we just
[27:39] have to let the holy spirit guide us
[27:40] here
[27:41] because we got plenty to preach just not
[27:44] enough time i guess
[27:47] but god is good i love this message
[27:48] that's one thing i love this word is
[27:50] right church
[27:51] it's thus saith the lord it's right amen
[27:54] so we got confidence in that
[27:56] i got one thing i want to share about
[27:57] the coronavirus in just a moment but
[27:58] let's uh
[27:59] let's uh take our scriptures here we'll
[28:01] go to that
[28:03] second peter one and if you're listening
[28:06] brother stephen go ahead and text me
[28:07] your memory verse if not
[28:09] i'll try to remind you later i know you
[28:11] think he works second but
[28:12] i know brother banks sometimes can
[28:14] listen and live stream i don't know if
[28:15] they can do it anymore
[28:16] but they did it for a while second peter
[28:18] one
[28:24] let's just read verse eight because i
[28:28] just want to look at just some
[28:29] general thoughts about
[28:33] godliness tonight by god's grace let's
[28:44] read verse 8 on three
[28:45] one two three for if these things be
[28:49] in you and abound they make you that ye
[28:52] shall neither be
[28:53] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[28:56] of our lord jesus
[28:58] christ may god add his blessings to the
[29:00] ring of his word may be seated praise
[29:01] god amen
[29:04] um just about the coronavirus i just had
[29:06] two thoughts i just want to share with
[29:07] you real quick
[29:09] um i checked the wet the john hopkins
[29:12] university website
[29:13] so far 619 000 global deaths
[29:17] that's awful every death is awful but
[29:20] that pales in comparison to other
[29:22] plagues
[29:23] and other pestilences so now that's the
[29:25] ones that's recorded
[29:27] and then i saw a church a few weeks ago
[29:30] the governor of illinois had some of his
[29:32] government workers come up and they
[29:34] admitted on live tv
[29:36] that they were grouping a lot of deaths
[29:38] into the cova desk that should not have
[29:40] been went in there
[29:42] so just know there's just some
[29:44] corruption you know that
[29:46] that you know you and i know uh
[29:49] the sinners are trying to use this to
[29:51] take away people's rights
[29:52] we know that to cause fear
[29:55] because satan loves fear it's to steal
[29:58] kill and destroy
[29:59] but god's word gives us faith amen in
[30:02] the midst of pandemics
[30:03] we don't fear because god is with us
[30:05] amen and if we do get sick well our god
[30:07] is our healer
[30:08] amen god can overcome cancer god can
[30:11] heal from any plague or pestilence
[30:13] so i just want to update you on that 619
[30:16] thousand
[30:16] that's about the number of abortions
[30:18] done every year and that awful
[30:21] it's it's just awful um it's it's half
[30:23] of how many people die in a car accident
[30:25] every year in the united states 1
[30:26] million 200
[30:27] 000 die from car accidents it's more
[30:30] dangerous to get in your car
[30:31] than anything else i think in america so
[30:34] just keeping that
[30:35] in i just want to keep that in
[30:37] perspective the other thing is i was
[30:38] watching a video this week
[30:40] a preaching video and the brother i
[30:42] don't remember who it was
[30:43] and he talked about the generations and
[30:45] i thought he was talking about
[30:47] coronavirus and
[30:47] the generation i thought who is being
[30:50] impacted the most by the coronavirus
[30:52] it's the people that are 65 and older
[30:57] and i thought let's go back 65 years
[30:59] what's 2020
[31:01] minus 65.
[31:06] what happened in 1956 brother branham
[31:08] said thus saith the lord
[31:10] america will either repent and serve
[31:14] christ
[31:14] or fall away thus saith the lord in
[31:17] 1956.
[31:19] that was the year brother i don't know
[31:21] if he knows about amen elvis got
[31:23] hugely popular in 1956
[31:26] because it was 50 years after the holy
[31:28] ghost fell out in california in 1906 as
[31:31] azusa street
[31:33] so brother ram said thus say the lord
[31:34] this is the jubilee 1956 was the jubilee
[31:38] and they turned it down the church it
[31:40] could be i'm not saying it is
[31:42] but it sure looks like a judgment upon
[31:44] the generation that turned down the lord
[31:46] jesus christ
[31:47] and also i went back and listened to
[31:48] what i preached on coronavirus
[31:50] also in numbers i don't remember the
[31:53] chapter now
[31:55] but also david david and the book of
[31:58] numbers
[31:58] there's two times when god when the
[32:01] people were
[32:02] numbered israel was numbered twice the
[32:04] first time they weren't plagued because
[32:06] god made them pay a shekel
[32:08] of silver and so they weren't plagued
[32:11] the second time david was deceived by
[32:14] satan remember that
[32:15] and i think 72 000 died
[32:19] because david numbered the people and
[32:21] satan tricked him and i just saw that
[32:23] saw that pattern whenever men try to
[32:26] number
[32:27] and build up their numbers god sends a
[32:29] plague
[32:30] remember i told you i hate to say like
[32:32] this but the white house before this
[32:34] pandemic hit we're building up
[32:35] their numbers we're so great we have all
[32:38] this
[32:39] remember that and who has taken the
[32:40] credit i think the president was taking
[32:42] the credit
[32:42] i pray for that man more than i prayed
[32:44] for any president
[32:46] i don't think he's saved but i'm going
[32:47] to keep praying for him
[32:49] anyways the point i was making every
[32:51] time god's people exalted numbers
[32:54] god sent a plague so i just saw two
[32:56] things i thought were very striking
[32:58] numbers again
[32:59] and then also 65 years ago
[33:02] america had her last chance and she
[33:04] turned it down so
[33:06] i don't know i just thought it was
[33:07] interesting i thought i'd share that
[33:08] with you
[33:09] just something to keep in mind by the
[33:10] grace of the lord
[33:15] because to me church it looked like and
[33:16] it isn't interesting brother branham
[33:17] said judas was a modern-day
[33:19] judas iscariot isn't that interesting
[33:22] they chose
[33:22] judas over christ and then brother
[33:25] random in 1963 indicted the generation
[33:28] in the name of the lord jesus christ for
[33:30] crucifying
[33:31] christ again so they chose their judas
[33:35] and then they're indicted by a prophet
[33:36] of god for crucifying the lord
[33:39] thank god that we don't crucify him
[33:41] thank god we crucify our wills
[33:44] amen i'll say like this i'm crucified
[33:47] with christ
[33:47] praise god i no longer live but christ
[33:50] lives in me amen
[33:52] amen that's our testimony let me set my
[33:54] timer here i almost forgot
[33:56] praise the lord all right that's the
[33:59] wrong one how do we do that i don't know
[34:00] what happens
[34:01] okay so let's lord willing finish here i
[34:04] thought that would be a blessing to you
[34:06] i just thought that would that really
[34:07] helped me
[34:07] i thought my no wonder no wonder this
[34:10] virus strikes at this time
[34:14] and just recall you know it looks like
[34:15] it's just it's a it's to me it's like a
[34:18] foreshadowing it's a pestilence right
[34:20] it's a birth pain
[34:21] and the and the world is there they're
[34:23] getting ready to do the one world order
[34:26] it may happen in our life time it may
[34:28] happen the next lifetime
[34:29] next one but you can see how they're
[34:32] using this as a worldwide
[34:34] ability to take away people's rights and
[34:37] to force people
[34:38] to take the mark of the beast but thank
[34:40] god we're already marked by jesus christ
[34:42] amen
[34:43] i marked to the day of my redemption i
[34:45] got nothing to worry about
[34:48] you're born again you got you don't
[34:49] gotta worry about that mark i'm already
[34:51] marked amen
[34:52] amen it's a one-time thing praise god
[34:53] and i'm already marked by the spirit of
[34:55] jesus christ
[34:56] by god's grace i believe that with all
[34:58] my heart by god's grace
[35:00] so let's look to the word here tonight
[35:01] now if you've got your bibles go to
[35:02] deuteronomy 8
[35:05] verses 2 and 3 i'll have some of the
[35:06] readers
[35:09] my ready readers i'll just call them
[35:10] like that i just want to bring out this
[35:12] thought brother branham says in the
[35:13] church age book
[35:14] you can know where you stand with god at
[35:16] any time
[35:17] in other words you can know your
[35:19] spiritual location any time with god
[35:23] so on the statueman if you're not born
[35:25] again or if you just got saved i love
[35:27] how my girls asked me about it a few
[35:28] months ago
[35:29] they said daddy do you think i got
[35:30] patience daddy do you think i got virtue
[35:34] i thought that was great i love that um
[35:37] you can look and see where you stand
[35:39] with god
[35:41] and if you're born again you can see
[35:42] what fruits are lacking in my life
[35:44] in other words where is god going to
[35:46] prove me yeah if you're born again
[35:49] there's probably pruning that you need
[35:51] amen
[35:52] right brother ram says you're either
[35:53] going into a trial or just coming out of
[35:55] one
[35:56] getting ready to go into another one so
[35:58] if you're born again that means you're
[36:00] you just come out of a pruning time
[36:02] you're probably gonna get pruned again
[36:03] remember there's nine fruits of the holy
[36:05] spirit right yeah so
[36:07] nine of those areas god's constantly
[36:09] dealing with us on
[36:10] helping us to grow now i want to bring
[36:13] this scripture up because
[36:15] israel when for their exodus they left
[36:19] egypt and then they had to cross i think
[36:21] three
[36:22] uh wildernesses i think there was three
[36:24] different wildernesses in the sinai
[36:25] palencino
[36:26] peninsula right so from egypt to israel
[36:29] was the sinai peninsula
[36:31] it's like a like a triangle land right
[36:33] and it's connected by a strip of land
[36:35] you had the wilderness of sure the
[36:37] wilderness of sinai and the wilderness
[36:38] of paran
[36:40] so you had this great wilderness area
[36:42] between egypt
[36:44] and their promised land praise god amen
[36:47] and god told them why he took them
[36:49] through the wilderness
[36:51] and he humbled thee i'm sorry can you go
[36:53] to verse 200 i'm sorry
[36:55] case you're my fault and thou shalt
[36:58] remember all the way which the lord thy
[36:59] god led thee these forty years of orders
[37:01] to humble thee
[37:02] and to prove thee and to know what was
[37:04] in thine heart whether thou knowest
[37:06] i'm sorry whether thou what is keep his
[37:08] commandments or no
[37:10] look at that i just called that
[37:14] he said remember all the way all these
[37:16] 40 years
[37:19] now for us it's remember all the steps
[37:21] of a statue of perfect man
[37:24] because peter said that
[37:27] in verse uh i'm don't you have to read
[37:29] it but peter said i will endeavor that
[37:31] you may be able after my decease
[37:33] to have these things always in
[37:35] remembrance amen amen
[37:36] glory so peter said always remember
[37:39] where god has brought you the statue of
[37:41] a perfect man
[37:42] amen glory and then god
[37:45] told moses tell them to always remember
[37:48] their path
[37:49] from egypt to the promised land amen ah
[37:52] that's beautiful
[37:53] glory these things get more and more
[37:55] proven all the time
[37:57] so it was a three-stage process
[38:00] justification
[38:01] going through the red sea of the water
[38:02] baptism sanctification was the
[38:04] wilderness
[38:06] uh the statue of man there and then the
[38:08] promised land was the baptism of the
[38:09] holy ghost praise god
[38:11] and church they could know at all times
[38:13] where they were they just had to look
[38:15] they said look they just had to open
[38:16] their eyes and church inside this we
[38:18] just got to get our eyes off the world
[38:20] get our eyes on the bible and we can
[38:22] tell right where we are with god
[38:24] amen praise god
[38:28] you know i'm just trying to think about
[38:29] my life which fruit he was working on
[38:31] but i have to look at the fruit
[38:32] list again real quick see which i've
[38:34] been uh which fruits i've been dealing
[38:35] with lately
[38:36] i have to look at it i don't have it in
[38:37] front of me so see church you can always
[38:39] know
[38:41] we can always know just as israel could
[38:42] always know god gave us the path
[38:45] from justification from egypt all the
[38:47] way to the baptism of the holy ghost
[38:49] praise god now i'm sorry verse three i'm
[38:51] sorry deuteronomy 8 3.
[38:54] i forgot to read that one
[38:58] and he humbled me so see what does
[38:59] sanctification do to humble you
[39:02] now church it's not easy wednesday and
[39:04] sunday after sunday i've got to preach
[39:06] sermons about being sanctified right
[39:08] humbling and dying out you probably get
[39:10] tired of it right
[39:11] just like they got tired of the
[39:12] wilderness
[39:14] but it's why what has it done is to
[39:16] humble us is to show us that we can't do
[39:18] it on our own
[39:19] we need god amen we need god's strength
[39:22] we need
[39:23] god's uh knowledge god's virtue god's
[39:26] readily kindness
[39:27] we've got to humble ourselves we can't
[39:28] do it on our own
[39:30] the denominations are trying to get
[39:31] there by works but we know it can't be
[39:33] our works it can't be our strength
[39:35] it's got to be god's strength and so
[39:38] it's a matter of humility
[39:40] and so a sermon after a sermon i've just
[39:42] got to keep preaching so we'll humble
[39:43] ourselves and learn to die
[39:45] out so that christ can be magnified so
[39:47] we finally give
[39:48] christ the preeminence amen amen that's
[39:51] what the purpose of it is and that same
[39:53] thing in my life too i've got a daily
[39:55] exam in my life and make sure i'm
[39:56] humbling myself not exalting myself
[39:59] that's only way god can work with me to
[40:01] humble us
[40:03] right humble suffer thee to hunger see
[40:05] sometimes we've got to get really really
[40:07] hungry
[40:08] bendy with manna which thou knowest not
[40:10] neither did thy fathers know that he
[40:11] might make thee know
[40:12] that man does not live by bread alone
[40:16] but by every word that proceeds out of
[40:18] the mouth of the lord
[40:19] thus man live amen what did this message
[40:22] come to do
[40:23] to help to point us to the word the word
[40:25] we're supposed to eat and then
[40:27] speak amen we're to eat that word in the
[40:30] morning and speak it throughout the day
[40:32] praise god
[40:33] that's that's exactly what the
[40:35] wilderness was those three wildernesses
[40:38] uh paran and and sinai and and
[40:41] shusha was that probably saying that
[40:43] wrong
[40:44] i don't know that one memorized there
[40:46] sure sorry
[40:48] not even close it was to humble them and
[40:51] to keep them
[40:52] on the word live by the word live by the
[40:54] word live by the word and you'll possess
[40:56] the promised land
[40:58] hallelujah so see it's a great uh
[41:01] understanding it's a great type from
[41:03] egypt uh all the way to the promised
[41:06] land
[41:08] now remember church few there be how
[41:09] many know the few there be that find the
[41:11] way to the promised land
[41:13] remember church out of that original two
[41:14] million two made it over
[41:17] two one in a million praise god
[41:20] that's about what we got in the message
[41:22] right yeah all these
[41:24] millions of message believers i say one
[41:27] out of a million
[41:29] maybe more than that i don't know we'll
[41:31] see
[41:32] but sea church is a very small group how
[41:34] do you know because they don't show
[41:35] those
[41:36] attributes that the bible says we should
[41:38] have praise god
[41:42] like just today i was looking at the
[41:43] preach one of these preachers i left the
[41:44] message i went on his facebook
[41:46] page i'm not his friend him i just every
[41:47] now and then like this i want to see if
[41:49] he
[41:49] had a full-time preaching position yet i
[41:51] couldn't find it but he's on there with
[41:53] shorts just on his birthday
[41:54] he's got shorts on his wife's got uh
[41:58] pants on cut her hair and they're in
[42:00] their 60s
[42:02] got big old earrings on oh oh my
[42:05] goodness
[42:06] it just looked awful it just looked
[42:08] awful to see the people that used to
[42:10] honor
[42:11] uh was almost a pastor 40 years in the
[42:13] message
[42:14] uh they used to honor god and then it
[42:17] just shows they never
[42:18] made it up or if they made it up they
[42:20] forsook it and they never took the
[42:22] promised land
[42:23] few church people can serve god 40 years
[42:26] and still not go in the promised land my
[42:28] there it is right there
[42:29] just like they did 40 years in the
[42:30] winter so they never entered in
[42:32] but there was two that had a different
[42:34] spirit on them and they can make it
[42:36] through praise god
[42:37] let that be us that we've got the holy
[42:39] spirit on us amen
[42:41] not the spirit of egypt but the holy
[42:43] spirit that will give us courage to take
[42:45] the promised land
[42:46] amen ah there's not a
[42:50] five of my being that wants to put a a
[42:52] tattoo on my body or a
[42:56] nose ring or something like that there's
[42:57] not a fiber in my being that would want
[42:59] to strip myself and present myself to
[43:01] the public
[43:02] i want to promote christ amen amen i
[43:05] want the world to see christ through my
[43:06] life
[43:07] not the world
[43:11] but see they still got that desire see
[43:12] because they never really left
[43:14] egypt or i said egypt never left them
[43:17] i'll say like that
[43:18] they might have walked out but egypt
[43:20] stayed in their hearts they never really
[43:22] died up to self
[43:23] they never really crucified self
[43:26] remember jude 1 5 put up jude 1 5 up
[43:29] there if you got it sweetie
[43:30] i will therefore put you in remembrance
[43:32] though he once knew this
[43:34] i'm sorry though ye once knew this how
[43:36] that the lord having saved the people
[43:38] out of the land of egypt afterward
[43:40] destroyed them
[43:41] that believe not he brought them out by
[43:44] grace but when they turned down grace
[43:46] god had to destroy them because they
[43:48] asked for it
[43:49] right they complained ten times about
[43:52] all the miracles why we
[43:54] god help us never to complain amen about
[43:57] a miracle
[43:58] let me say this god help us not to
[44:00] complain about the jobs he's given us
[44:03] praise god god help us not to complain
[44:07] about the government
[44:09] because they protect us god uses them
[44:12] god help us not to complain about the
[44:13] doctors
[44:16] all these blessings that god give us let
[44:18] us not be complainers but let us give
[44:20] thanks
[44:20] everything give thanks this is the will
[44:22] of god in christ jesus
[44:25] complaining about things god help us not
[44:27] to complain amen
[44:28] god help us to give praise to his great
[44:31] name
[44:33] see we don't have to wander around the
[44:35] wilderness church we've got to wander
[44:36] around
[44:37] in the sanctification we can possess the
[44:40] promised land amen
[44:42] if you're stranded if you're in a rut if
[44:44] you're wandering around from church to
[44:46] church or
[44:47] most people not here tonight thank god
[44:49] that's part of the book here
[44:50] i said get down to business with god
[44:53] look at your true character
[44:55] now pull up psalms 1 19 58 that's a big
[44:58] number there

[45:01] this is all we have to do and you know
[45:03] it i know it every service

[45:06] god and turn our eyes
[45:09] to the word of god and obey the word of
[45:11] god and everything will start turning
[45:13] out all right

[45:20] heart see we've got to come to church
[45:21] with our whole heart

[45:24] word next verse

[45:35] from just
[45:36] one thing to the next get your eyes on
[45:39] the lord we just got to get our eyes on
[45:40] the lord
[45:41] and think on god's ways and walk in

[45:45] victory praise god

[45:55] salvation be quick to repent

[46:00] to god's testimonies and it won't be
[46:02] long
[46:02] you'll possess the promised land praise
[46:04] god it wasn't long after they got all
[46:06] those unbelievers out there right
[46:08] was it what wasn't wrong they got them
[46:10] circumcised they crossed over
[46:12] because they turn their feet under god's
[46:14] testimonies
[46:17] see it's a beautiful type church of
[46:20] israel taking the prophet saying you
[46:21] know i know it but i just thought i'd
[46:23] bring out those scriptures does that
[46:24] help
[46:25] all right got a few amen thank the lord
[46:27] i thought i thought they'd help you out
[46:28] by god's grace
[46:30] now i'm going to review this briefly
[46:34] jesus 12 disciples you can see how they
[46:36] work their way up the statute for man
[46:38] then they fall away
[46:39] like i said i'm just going to try to
[46:40] finish this i got some other good
[46:41] examples in here
[46:43] and church they are like measuring
[46:44] sticks for our lives
[46:47] right 12 you can look at the 12
[46:49] disciples you can look at paul paul is a
[46:51] great measuring stick
[46:53] you can look at peter and we have so
[46:55] many details about these brothers lives
[46:57] david is a good example too he got the
[46:59] anointing oil poured on the spirit of
[47:01] god was on him from that day forth
[47:03] you can look at all these great examples
[47:05] in the scripture
[47:07] but let's look at the disciples briefly
[47:10] now they had
[47:11] faith when they believed on jesus and
[47:13] they forsook their family and careers to
[47:16] follow christ
[47:17] they had faith they chose the right way
[47:19] right they had to leave the fishing nets
[47:21] they'd leave the tax collection booth
[47:24] and leave that behind by faith they
[47:26] chose christ
[47:27] now next they got virtue because we
[47:29] preached on this recently
[47:31] do you know that they went into their
[47:32] own cities two by two
[47:34] and publicly preached and healed before
[47:38] jesus visited their cities and naomi
[47:41] think about your hometown i'll think
[47:42] about my hometown my wife and i can
[47:44] think about the same hometown
[47:45] which one of us would want to go in
[47:46] there now hopefully i believe we would
[47:48] right we want to go in our hometowns and
[47:50] preach christ amen
[47:52] and say does anybody need prayer anybody
[47:54] need healing
[47:55] sisters don't preach we know that but
[47:57] see that's the kind of virtue that they
[47:59] had
[48:00] they had virtue to go to their hometown
[48:01] amongst their high school friends and
[48:03] their own
[48:03] their own neighbors and everything and
[48:05] preach the lord jesus christ
[48:07] praise god now but remember they lost
[48:11] all their virtue the night of the rest
[48:14] because they all scattered so see how
[48:15] you can build your way up and then you
[48:17] can
[48:17] that anointing can leave you right
[48:19] you're going to be so anointed and fall
[48:20] away
[48:21] in your mind all right can we see that
[48:26] because the bible says jesus pray that
[48:29] their faith fail not
[48:32] hallelujah jesus prays that their faith
[48:34] now their virtue might have failed but
[48:36] their faith didn't fail praise god
[48:38] see see that's true you can run away
[48:40] we've all had times we've
[48:41] run away from from obstacles right
[48:43] instead of facing it we run away
[48:45] but our faith doesn't fail us praise god
[48:48] we never leave the faith
[48:50] now knowledge while most jews
[48:52] misunderstood jesus's parables and
[48:54] teachings
[48:55] the disciples assured jesus they
[48:57] understood them
[48:58] in matthew 13 51 can you pull that up
[49:01] there acacia
[49:03] jesus asked him do you understand these
[49:04] things they're like yeah i got we got
[49:05] knowledge
[49:06] we got knowledge matthew 13 51
[49:10] i think it's a nice scripture just to
[49:11] show how they they believed
[49:14] jesus and them have you understood all
[49:15] these things see now just understanding
[49:18] and they said unto him yay lord
[49:21] glory see they understood now they
[49:25] understood those things but they didn't
[49:26] understand other things right
[49:29] jesus said they didn't understand how
[49:30] men are defiled they thought man's
[49:32] defiled from the outside in
[49:34] but jesus said you're defiled from the
[49:36] inside out
[49:38] where do where do adulteries and murders
[49:41] where do they come from jesus said they
[49:42] come from the the heart
[49:45] that's right they didn't understand
[49:48] about the leaven of the doctrine the
[49:49] pharisees and sadducees
[49:51] they didn't understand jesus
[49:52] resurrection for sure none of us would
[49:54] have
[49:55] so see there was times they had a
[49:56] knowledge and then it decreased
[49:59] now temperance now this is interesting
[50:01] if anybody can find any examples of
[50:03] disciples
[50:04] with struggling with physical
[50:05] temperaments i couldn't
[50:08] um but they did become a
[50:11] indignant against james and john when
[50:13] their mother asked jesus if their two
[50:15] sons could sit on their right and left
[50:16] hand
[50:17] but they sure lost their self-control
[50:19] there didn't they they got piping hot
[50:22] oh what do you mean you two sit by jesus
[50:23] what about us
[50:25] what about us 10 other preachers and
[50:28] they really lost their their
[50:30] self-control there
[50:32] right patience now look they patiently
[50:35] stay with jesus after many disciples
[50:37] forsook him
[50:38] because they knew like peter said we
[50:40] know you've got the words to eternal
[50:42] life
[50:42] so they had patience at that point
[50:46] but they then they hastily asked jesus
[50:48] to send away the woman of canaan
[50:50] who repeatedly cried for jesus to heal
[50:52] her vex daughter
[50:53] but jesus uh met her request
[50:56] miraculously see there's times had
[50:59] patience there's times they struggle
[51:00] with it
[51:03] all right next one see godliness
[51:06] uh jesus extinguished james and john's
[51:10] ungodly desire to call fire down from
[51:13] heaven upon
[51:14] the christ rejecting samaritans that's
[51:16] not very good godliness is it
[51:20] and then peter violently cut off
[51:22] malcus's ear trying to defend jesus
[51:24] proving that he didn't have love for his
[51:26] enemies
[51:28] so see you can look at their lives
[51:30] church now which one of you have ever
[51:31] taken out a gun to shoot anybody
[51:34] or which one of you have gotten a fist
[51:35] fight right what's the equivalent of
[51:37] cutting off somebody's ear see see how
[51:40] they lack the anointing of the holy
[51:42] spirit against their enemies
[51:44] well see we need godliness how many
[51:46] godliness today amen
[51:48] see broadly kindness now multiple times
[51:51] they lack this
[51:52] they argued about who is the greatest
[51:54] they forbade a brother from casting out
[51:56] devils because he didn't follow the
[51:57] twelve
[51:59] not very kind to his brothers right shut
[52:01] down your ministry brother jesus said
[52:02] let him alone if he's not against me
[52:04] he's for me
[52:07] they forbade christian sisters from
[52:09] bringing their infants and toddlers to
[52:10] jesus can you imagine shut down the
[52:12] sisters
[52:13] uh brother jesse can you dedicate my
[52:15] baby no
[52:16] no i don't have time for that imagine
[52:18] the lacking of broadly kindness on that
[52:22] peter struggled with jesus requirement
[52:25] to forgive his brother
[52:26] 70 times more than he first estimated
[52:29] they struggle with broadly kindness
[52:32] now charity after the resurrection jesus
[52:35] breathed on them and urged them to
[52:37] receive charity
[52:40] he used 40 days right of staying with
[52:43] the disciples to raise their faith
[52:45] so the next 10 days they'd have enough
[52:48] strength to pray for 10 days
[52:51] praise god what would it take people to
[52:54] pray for 10 days jesus christ doing
[52:55] supernatural miracles
[52:57] amen for 40 days right that's beautiful
[53:01] he gave them many infallible proofs of
[53:04] his resurrection
[53:05] and then said pray for 10 days and they
[53:07] did and finally they got
[53:09] one accord and then love and charity
[53:11] fell into their souls
[53:12] and jesus paul said the love of god is
[53:15] shed abroad in your hearts by the holy
[53:16] ghost
[53:17] which is given unto us oh what
[53:19] encouragement church if we want to be
[53:20] united we've got to pray amen
[53:22] amen if we want unity in one accord
[53:25] let's pray for one another praise god
[53:27] let's forget our differences and let's
[53:29] be united in christ
[53:30] amen glory
[53:34] that's our prayer right god do do
[53:35] miracles do so many infattable americans
[53:38] and church that's what happens when
[53:39] people get born again
[53:40] amen like you heard on sunday god will
[53:42] give you two miracles right miracle
[53:44] after miracle
[53:45] lead you to the baptism of the holy
[53:46] ghost amen amen to get everybody in one
[53:49] accord praise god
[53:51] amen it gives us many infallible prayers
[53:54] amen
[53:54] to show us that this word is right these
[53:57] people are god's people
[53:58] they are the children of god amen spend
[54:00] your lives with god's children praise
[54:02] god
[54:04] see as you can see it's tight through
[54:07] israel
[54:08] three stages it's typed through the
[54:09] disciples you can clearly see
[54:11] he breathed on some you need to get the
[54:13] holy ghost
[54:15] cutting off people's ears and arguing
[54:17] about who's the greatest preacher
[54:19] you really need the holy ghost and so
[54:21] they did praise god amen i'm glad he
[54:23] sends it to us too we need it
[54:25] amen now the next one i'm not going to
[54:29] take a lot of time on this because i got
[54:30] uh
[54:30] well i got 20 minutes maybe joseph of
[54:34] the old testament you can see
[54:35] his life goes through the stature of a
[54:38] perfect man
[54:41] all right now you all know the types of
[54:42] christ uh christ
[54:44] and joseph was a definite type of christ
[54:48] i'm sorry joseph was the type of christ
[54:50] christ was the anti-type
[54:52] now let's look at the seven steps i just
[54:55] have to trust me here i'm not going to
[54:56] read all of them by god's grace but
[54:57] just trust me i studied these i went and
[54:59] searched these out last year
[55:02] joseph had faith when he trusted god's
[55:04] way for his life
[55:06] and he unashamedly shared his dreams
[55:08] with his family in genesis 37.
[55:10] see he just the first thing we have of
[55:12] joseph he has a dream and he trusts it
[55:14] he had faith
[55:16] right can you imagine you imagine as a
[55:19] young person
[55:20] you had a dream your parents are going
[55:21] to bow down to you all your older
[55:23] brothers are going to serve you
[55:24] and you got enough faith to go up and
[55:25] tell them about it sorry
[55:27] goodness that's faith
[55:30] he chose the right way he wasn't scared
[55:32] to share that dream
[55:34] because he knew it was from god he had
[55:36] faith
[55:38] then he had virtue or moral strength in
[55:40] slavery so i'm skipping ahead to when he
[55:42] got thrown in the dungeon
[55:44] in the prison he had virtue and
[55:47] to still live for god and he daily
[55:50] prospered in his work
[55:51] and then also i'm sorry slavery in
[55:53] potiphar's house not the not the jail
[55:55] i'm sorry
[55:55] potter first house he had virtue in
[55:57] other words everybody in potiphar's
[55:59] house knew he was a man of god
[56:02] because of the way he handled it he
[56:03] didn't compromise just because
[56:05] his brother oh dad's not around oh i can
[56:07] make i can do a deal here i can slip a
[56:09] few thousand dollars here
[56:11] i'll steal some money from potiphar no
[56:13] he was a man of virtue
[56:16] everybody in the house knew he was a man
[56:17] of god next he had knowledge or
[56:20] understanding and this understanding
[56:22] helped promote him to overseer of
[56:24] potiphar's possessions
[56:26] in his house and field that this this
[56:29] falls perfectly in line that's chapter
[56:30] 39
[56:32] verses 4 to 6.
[56:35] so see he has faith to believe the dream
[56:37] and then he's got virtue
[56:39] his daily work prospers and then he's
[56:41] promoted because of his knowledge
[56:45] oh my and then he has temperance because
[56:47] potiphar's wife begged him to sleep with
[56:49] him
[56:50] or her rather and he had temperance to
[56:52] turn her down praise god amen
[56:54] because he feared almighty god more than
[56:57] he feared anything
[56:58] else he had tempers that was 39 verses 7
[57:01] to 20. i mean it's perfect church is
[57:03] beautiful
[57:03] it just goes right in line i remember
[57:06] the holy spirit opened that up to me i
[57:07] said praise the lord i said now i can
[57:09] preach this
[57:10] amen patience he had patience or
[57:13] contentment
[57:15] as he waited in prison for two years
[57:17] even though they forgot about him
[57:19] he never threw up his hand and said i
[57:21] quit i give up this message nonsense
[57:23] i he didn't quit church he had patience
[57:26] to wait on god amen
[57:28] the same god that gave me the dream the
[57:29] same god that gave me favor and by
[57:31] this house the same god that has done
[57:34] all these things that's kept me alive
[57:36] these two years
[57:37] the same god that gave me an
[57:38] interpretation of the dream will be the
[57:40] same god that'll bring it to pass
[57:44] oh it's a good thing he was patient
[57:45] don't you agree church it's a good thing
[57:47] he had patience
[57:48] two years in prison
[57:52] sometimes you gotta wait through two
[57:53] years of prison at our job right
[57:56] right oh this situation's awful i feel
[57:58] like i'm a slave well
[58:00] welcome to joseph's world right we just
[58:02] sometimes we have to go through that
[58:03] right
[58:04] awful times long extended seas when is
[58:07] this season going to end
[58:10] it may be a long time but as long as
[58:13] you've got god's patience
[58:14] you'll come through now where'd he get
[58:17] godliness
[58:18] he had godliness he was so much like god
[58:21] that
[58:22] pharaoh knew god's spirit was in joseph
[58:24] and then gave him the interpretation of
[58:26] pharaoh's dream remember
[58:27] pharaoh said that the spirit of god is
[58:30] in this man
[58:32] he had godliness amen oh it's beautiful
[58:36] in church he had broadly kindness
[58:38] because he forgave his brothers amen
[58:40] hallelujah
[58:41] he revealed he said no don't be afraid
[58:43] he said i'm joseph
[58:44] and god sent me here don't be afraid i
[58:47] forgive you praise god
[58:49] amen lie it's absolutely perfect for the
[58:51] amen
[58:52] this type in shadow is perfect amen
[58:55] he's got temperance and brotherly
[58:57] kindness all these things
[58:58] and last but not least when is the when
[59:00] does joseph and the holy spirit meet
[59:03] when he embraced his father jacob when
[59:06] he
[59:06] his father came to abide with him in
[59:08] egypt
[59:09] and the bible said they met and wept and
[59:12] cried they boo-hooed
[59:14] they boo-hooed all over one another the
[59:17] son and the father
[59:18] that's like the holy ghost on you church
[59:21] the holy ghost on you
[59:22] is like the father on his daughter or
[59:24] the father on his son
[59:25] praise god amen that's inspired
[59:28] hallelujah
[59:30] thank you jesus and it's all perfectly
[59:32] chronological
[59:34] it's just one after another
[59:37] oh my joseph life his life was capped
[59:40] off
[59:41] when the father came to permanently
[59:42] dwell with him oh my
[59:45] i didn't know you praise god amen church
[59:49] that's me that's revelation that's like
[59:50] that one that's like that gideon
[59:52] revelation my sister is talking about
[59:54] or that hosea one remember that one oh
[59:56] my
[59:57] god's word keeps unfolding it keeps
[1:00:00] becoming unveiled to us
[1:00:02] so we can't deny it we never would want
[1:00:04] to deny it praise god
[1:00:05] it's god's revelation for us it's our
[1:00:07] spiritual food and due season
[1:00:09] amen if i keep clapping i'm gonna have
[1:00:11] bleeding pretty soon here praise god
[1:00:13] keep clapping like that thank the lord
[1:00:16] god is good church
[1:00:17] god is good
[1:00:21] all right i got uh 13 minutes so yeah
[1:00:23] let me
[1:00:24] yeah okay now the significance of number
[1:00:29] eight i'm just gonna blow through these
[1:00:30] because i got about 13 minutes
[1:00:31] i want to be cautious of the time i've
[1:00:33] been trying to do that even before you
[1:00:34] got the job so
[1:00:35] don't everybody say well brother jesse's
[1:00:36] just doing this for amen remember i was
[1:00:38] trying to do this for a long time
[1:00:40] i've been trying to shorten my my
[1:00:42] sermons
[1:00:44] church i believe you can get out if
[1:00:46] peter preached five minutes in the holy
[1:00:48] ghost film cornish's house i don't have
[1:00:49] to preach an hour and a half
[1:00:51] it's it's when the people are ready now
[1:00:54] if you're really hungry
[1:00:55] and you pull for an hour and a half i'll
[1:00:56] preach an hour and a half
[1:00:58] sometimes i just sometimes i fee i fill
[1:01:00] up so much i've got i just got to get it
[1:01:02] all out
[1:01:03] but i'm just making the point if people
[1:01:05] are hungry and people are pulling
[1:01:06] we can hear from god i believe we
[1:01:08] already have amen
[1:01:10] now the significance of number eight
[1:01:12] eight is a new beginning remember the
[1:01:13] numerology series
[1:01:14] see this i mean this book and everything
[1:01:16] it's just all fallen in god's line
[1:01:18] i mean i could not have done all this
[1:01:19] this book writing without all the
[1:01:21] previous sermons
[1:01:23] everything i've learned preaching the
[1:01:24] book of revelation 125 sermons
[1:01:26] it's all preparing me for this i could
[1:01:28] not have done it without it see because
[1:01:30] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:01:31] ordered of the lord amen
[1:01:33] that's right so see it's a is a new
[1:01:36] beginning
[1:01:38] there's eight steps right there's seven
[1:01:40] and then eight charity is a new
[1:01:42] beginning
[1:01:44] right joseph's dad was a new beginning
[1:01:47] the family's reunited amen
[1:01:50] see paul says any man who's in christ is
[1:01:53] a new creator
[1:01:54] amen all things have passed away behold
[1:01:56] all things are become new
[1:01:59] a holy ghost christian field christian
[1:02:01] is a new creature
[1:02:02] he's living a life of divine power so
[1:02:05] let's look at the numbers
[1:02:06] the hebrew boys were circumcised on the
[1:02:09] eighth day that means they're newly in
[1:02:10] the covenant
[1:02:13] praise god now without that remember
[1:02:15] abraham's abraham's covenant without
[1:02:17] that they were
[1:02:17] they were kicked out they could not have
[1:02:20] any fellowship forgiveness
[1:02:21] it was a new beginning
[1:02:24] uh when when aaron's priesthood
[1:02:27] officially began
[1:02:28] the holy ghost and fire fell on the
[1:02:31] eighth day
[1:02:33] see the uh in other words that
[1:02:35] priesthood the preachers
[1:02:37] had to wait till the fire fell on the
[1:02:38] eighth day and a preacher's got to meet
[1:02:40] the pillar of fire
[1:02:42] amen before he preaches the gospel
[1:02:45] ours didn't catch up to it right now
[1:02:46] praise god amen
[1:02:48] the priesthood has to have the firefly
[1:02:51] amen they must be born again
[1:02:53] in order to minister to god's people
[1:02:57] former lepers were experienced a new
[1:03:00] beginning and they were declared clean
[1:03:03] at the door of the congregation on the
[1:03:05] eighth day
[1:03:06] so when he really cleaned when the holy
[1:03:08] ghost falls
[1:03:09] praise god when charity seals you away
[1:03:12] now you're really clean before god
[1:03:14] see now you're sealed to the day of your
[1:03:16] redemption hallelujah
[1:03:18] see because you're all sanctified you're
[1:03:20] all cleaned out
[1:03:23] i appreciate everybody's attention
[1:03:25] praise the lord
[1:03:26] the eighth and final day of the feast of
[1:03:29] trumpets was a sabbath day a rest day
[1:03:31] rest
[1:03:32] rest on the eighth day rest
[1:03:35] uh israel and all the israelis return to
[1:03:38] their permanent homes
[1:03:39] oh it was the day they returned to their
[1:03:41] permanent homes it was a day of rest
[1:03:44] after spending seven days in booth so
[1:03:46] seven days in temporary boost
[1:03:48] and the eighth day permanent home praise
[1:03:51] god
[1:03:52] permanent rest
[1:03:53] [Applause]
[1:03:55] so you can wander around and boost a lot
[1:03:56] of message people wander around and boot
[1:03:58] to boot the booth
[1:03:59] but they gotta get to the eighth day
[1:04:01] praise god they gotta get to the
[1:04:03] permanent rest in christ jesus
[1:04:05] and people won't worry about them
[1:04:06] anymore they won't wonder well i wonder
[1:04:08] why they wandered around why they back
[1:04:09] and forth on these topics
[1:04:11] they're back and forth because they've
[1:04:12] got to get to the eighth day
[1:04:16] i i didn't have that that was fresh to
[1:04:18] me too i didn't i didn't have that like
[1:04:19] under
[1:04:20] the spiritual understanding of that
[1:04:22] until now that's why it's good to preach
[1:04:23] it praise god
[1:04:26] remember that was that was a reminder
[1:04:27] that they left exit or i'm sorry egypt
[1:04:30] in the exodus
[1:04:30] that was a reminder now they've got
[1:04:32] permanent homes
[1:04:34] glory god brought us out of the world
[1:04:37] the future millennial temple in
[1:04:38] jerusalem
[1:04:39] will be purged and purified seven days
[1:04:42] until god begins accepting israel and
[1:04:44] her offerings on the
[1:04:46] eighth day new beginning in the
[1:04:49] millennium praise god
[1:04:51] beautiful eighth day anais or aeneas a
[1:04:55] para
[1:04:55] paralyzed man from lyda was healed and
[1:04:57] given a new beginning through peter's
[1:04:59] ministry
[1:05:00] after suffering eight years he got a new
[1:05:03] beginning
[1:05:04] after the eighth year praise god and
[1:05:07] then lastly
[1:05:08] after the flood god used eight souls to
[1:05:11] begin repopulating the earth at her new
[1:05:13] beginning
[1:05:14] eight so you can see eight is a new
[1:05:16] beginning
[1:05:18] all right now at the end of the chapter
[1:05:20] i go through the rewards and
[1:05:21] consequences of rejecting this
[1:05:23] revelation
[1:05:25] so the rewards are was it was our text
[1:05:27] tonight if you
[1:05:28] if you receive this reward your life
[1:05:31] will abound
[1:05:32] in the fruit and then the knowledge of
[1:05:34] our lord jesus christ
[1:05:36] amen if you receive this revelation
[1:05:38] you'll see constantly fruit from your
[1:05:40] life
[1:05:40] amen amen you'll see in other words
[1:05:43] you'll see proof
[1:05:44] definite proof that you have the fruits
[1:05:46] of the holy spirit
[1:05:47] amen they'll be ripe in your life praise
[1:05:50] god
[1:05:51] amen also if you do these things you
[1:05:55] shall never fall
[1:05:56] amen another revelation is you'll never
[1:05:58] fall
[1:05:59] back into a worldly sinful life
[1:06:04] do what peter said do faith do virtue do
[1:06:06] knowledge do tempers
[1:06:07] do all these things and you'll never
[1:06:09] fall
[1:06:12] next you'll possess christ-like
[1:06:14] character
[1:06:15] and that's the only thing you're taking
[1:06:17] in the next life like brother brown says
[1:06:18] your character is your only thing you're
[1:06:20] taking with you paul says
[1:06:22] for we brought nothing in this world and
[1:06:24] it's certain we
[1:06:25] are carrying nothing out only you're
[1:06:28] not going to carry out what you're just
[1:06:30] going to be you're just gonna be the
[1:06:32] possession that comes you're gonna be
[1:06:33] the substance that comes out
[1:06:35] praise god not carrying it but you are
[1:06:37] it
[1:06:40] praise god your character produced good
[1:06:43] works will meet you at the judgment
[1:06:45] that's another another reward
[1:06:46] your uh your uh rewards will meet you at
[1:06:50] the judgment the bible says some men's
[1:06:52] sins
[1:06:53] will meet them uh at the judgment but
[1:06:55] see our sins won't meet us there
[1:06:57] but the fruits of our works will meet us
[1:06:59] there
[1:07:01] if we're constantly producing the fruit
[1:07:04] of the holy spirit
[1:07:07] okay so i just kind of really shorten
[1:07:09] that real real short now what are the
[1:07:11] consequences
[1:07:12] the first one is uh it'll lead to a life
[1:07:16] of
[1:07:16] ungodliness if you reject the revelation
[1:07:19] of god restoring godliness to man
[1:07:21] you're going to be ungodly
[1:07:25] and so the entrance into the kingdom of
[1:07:27] christ will not be granted to the
[1:07:29] ungodly
[1:07:30] now of course you can still be saved you
[1:07:32] know even if you reject the revelation
[1:07:34] because faith alone is required for
[1:07:36] salvation faith alone
[1:07:38] right you're saved by grace through
[1:07:39] faith you're justified by the blood
[1:07:41] justified by faith we looked at that on
[1:07:43] sunday
[1:07:45] another consequence is barrenness right
[1:07:47] you're not bringing forth any new
[1:07:49] any new fruit right no fruit no new
[1:07:52] believers you're not witnessing you're
[1:07:53] not saving souls
[1:07:56] these are all consequences of rejecting
[1:07:58] godliness
[1:08:00] in other words someone is inactive in
[1:08:02] the vineyard of god oh we don't want to
[1:08:04] be sa
[1:08:04] church we don't want to sit on the
[1:08:05] sidelines we want to be working the
[1:08:07] vineyard
[1:08:08] i'm going to be doing something for
[1:08:09] jesus when the savior calls i want to
[1:08:12] answer him
[1:08:12] but i want to answer him out in the
[1:08:14] vineyard praise god doing something for
[1:08:16] jesus working for his name amen
[1:08:18] i'll be somewhere working when he calls
[1:08:20] me
[1:08:22] see so someone without this revelation
[1:08:24] wastes their time
[1:08:25] they just waste all their time but see
[1:08:28] if we've got it
[1:08:29] we're fruitful they're barren we're
[1:08:32] fruitful
[1:08:34] we're active they're inactive not church
[1:08:37] you know that
[1:08:38] talk to any talk to any denominational
[1:08:40] person ask them what they've been
[1:08:42] hearing lately at church i mean they're
[1:08:43] not
[1:08:44] they're going to be talking about
[1:08:44] drinking beers right like brother amen
[1:08:46] saw
[1:08:47] they went to minnesota they went to
[1:08:48] their old church they're down in the
[1:08:49] basement drinking beers
[1:08:51] uh was that saturday night before
[1:08:52] service saturday before service drinking
[1:08:54] beers
[1:08:55] and then you want to go to church on
[1:08:57] sunday well i'll tell you i'll say well
[1:08:58] i'll say like this we have wine in our
[1:09:00] church
[1:09:00] natural wine but the best wine is
[1:09:02] spiritual that's the church that's the
[1:09:04] one we
[1:09:05] our church amen we got it here praise
[1:09:07] god amen
[1:09:08] that's what we got by god see it takes
[1:09:10] away all of our fears
[1:09:12] it takes me all of our inhibitions amen
[1:09:14] and we can just serve the lord and be
[1:09:16] happy and joyful and worship god amen
[1:09:19] and the reality of god's power and his
[1:09:21] resurrection
[1:09:24] thank god if it wasn't for god's grace
[1:09:27] we've been doing the same thing but amen
[1:09:28] we've been doing the same thing right
[1:09:30] it wasn't for god's grace but thank god
[1:09:31] for his grace amen
[1:09:34] see peter says without this you're blind
[1:09:38] you cannot see it far off you can't see
[1:09:39] the rapture
[1:09:40] thank god we can see the rapture coming
[1:09:42] we can see the persecution coming thank
[1:09:44] god we can see it far
[1:09:45] off they forgot and they were purged see
[1:09:49] this is one thing church
[1:09:50] a real holy ghost-filled saint is going
[1:09:51] to remember i'm forgiven
[1:09:54] i am under the blood of jesus christ see
[1:09:56] because they stay
[1:09:57] near the cross amen they said jesus keep
[1:10:00] me near the cross
[1:10:01] they're a precious fountain amen
[1:10:03] remember revelation 7
[1:10:05] the bride from every nation comes out
[1:10:07] and they say john who is it johnson i
[1:10:08] don't know
[1:10:09] and the angel says these are those who
[1:10:11] wash their garments white in the blood
[1:10:13] of jesus amen
[1:10:15] they stayed at the blood of jesus
[1:10:17] washing and washing and coming out of
[1:10:19] persecution and tribulation
[1:10:21] and struggle and temptation and they
[1:10:23] stayed there washing them praise god
[1:10:25] they didn't forget they were forgiven
[1:10:28] they knew they were forgiven amen
[1:10:30] glory i want to know i'm forgiven amen
[1:10:34] by washing in other words confessing my
[1:10:36] sins right
[1:10:37] service after service right week and
[1:10:39] year after year
[1:10:40] confessing our sins stay near to the
[1:10:43] cross
[1:10:44] amen the blood of jesus they don't they
[1:10:47] lack that
[1:10:48] they don't confess their sins constantly
[1:10:50] they they actually grow in sins
[1:10:52] it's called iniquity that's a whole
[1:10:53] nother mystery we'll get to that
[1:10:56] saints they they're spiritually blind
[1:10:58] and they're hardened to truth
[1:11:00] they refuse repentance and the healing
[1:11:03] benefits of the holy spirit
[1:11:05] now church we're not careful too we'll
[1:11:07] get roots of bitterness as well
[1:11:09] when we can't forgive people like we
[1:11:11] want to be forgiven we want jesus to
[1:11:13] forgive us right away right right
[1:11:14] but then we won't forgive people that
[1:11:16] shouldn't be
[1:11:18] if we're growing in the stats perfect
[1:11:19] man we should freely forgive
[1:11:22] right forgive us our debts lord each day
[1:11:24] as we forgive those
[1:11:26] who sin against us or who indebted to us
[1:11:31] let's not be blind let's set our
[1:11:33] affection on things above
[1:11:35] let's look under jesus the author and i
[1:11:37] like this the finisher of our faith
[1:11:39] we've all started
[1:11:40] but christ is going to finish our faith
[1:11:42] amen he's going to finish it with divine
[1:11:44] love
[1:11:46] hallelujah staying in the love of jesus
[1:11:48] christ
[1:11:49] they forget they were forgiven from
[1:11:52] their old sins
[1:11:58] see a confused mind doesn't know if the
[1:12:00] soul is saved
[1:12:01] because they constantly indulge in
[1:12:04] fleshly lust
[1:12:05] and they make them feel they make the
[1:12:07] flesh
[1:12:08] feel like the flesh is winning the war
[1:12:11] see when people are habitually caught in
[1:12:12] sin and they don't repent
[1:12:14] they the bible says that the fleshly
[1:12:16] lust war against the soul
[1:12:17] so that these people that don't grow up
[1:12:19] on the statue of man they constantly war
[1:12:21] am i saved or not
[1:12:24] am i right with god or not am i am i a
[1:12:26] child of god or not
[1:12:27] it's because they satisfy the flesh more
[1:12:30] they satisfy the holy spirit
[1:12:34] god help us to always remember
[1:12:37] that we're forgiven of our sins the only
[1:12:39] way to do that is to stay at the
[1:12:41] state of the fountain filled with blood
[1:12:42] stay there
[1:12:45] oh perfect one more minute praise god
[1:12:48] sometimes i go a little bit over here
[1:12:51] so what is what's up uh what's
[1:12:54] what's paul's suggestion about your
[1:12:56] salvation he said work out your
[1:12:58] salvation
[1:12:59] with fear and trembling nothing is more
[1:13:01] important than being assured of your
[1:13:03] salvation and of your spiritual location
[1:13:05] in christ
[1:13:06] nothing is more important than that
[1:13:11] and church let me share this a few years
[1:13:13] ago i had a minister's meeting with some
[1:13:14] ministers
[1:13:15] a small one but they asked me where i
[1:13:17] was and i told him i said i believe
[1:13:19] i am adopted i believe i'm born again
[1:13:21] and i'm adopted
[1:13:22] and they said how do you know i said
[1:13:23] because uh brother graham said when
[1:13:26] you're but when you're adopted
[1:13:27] your word is like the father's word in
[1:13:30] other words
[1:13:31] you speak god's word and god's speaking
[1:13:33] and not you
[1:13:35] and so at that moment i think that was
[1:13:36] in 2015 five years ago at that
[1:13:38] minister's meeting
[1:13:39] now i've been challenged since then
[1:13:40] don't get me wrong the devil has
[1:13:41] challenged me
[1:13:43] but that's my confession i'm going to
[1:13:44] keep confessing that because even like
[1:13:46] with sister who was dead you know
[1:13:48] uh just speaking the word like that was
[1:13:50] their testimony life came in after we
[1:13:52] prayed
[1:13:52] life right everybody else is praying for
[1:13:54] death
[1:13:55] we're praying for life amen amen that
[1:13:58] proves we
[1:13:59] we believe in jesus christ because he's
[1:14:01] the way the truth and the life amen amen
[1:14:04] see we're a different breed praise god
[1:14:06] they're praying for death we're praying
[1:14:07] for life
[1:14:08] nothing against people like that but
[1:14:10] just we're different we're a different
[1:14:11] breed
[1:14:13] and so when i i'm just saying that
[1:14:15] because
[1:14:16] when i confessed i was adopted and my
[1:14:18] word was the father's word
[1:14:20] i was tested on it but you know what
[1:14:23] it's my confession
[1:14:25] another another example i gave is when
[1:14:27] we were it was right when we were over
[1:14:29] there in that other sanctuary
[1:14:30] i was preaching sermons and people would
[1:14:32] come up to me and say
[1:14:34] that was exactly what we talked about on
[1:14:35] the drive to church
[1:14:37] i had to happen numerous times over
[1:14:38] there uh they said
[1:14:40] we had all these questions about the
[1:14:41] rapture and you answered every one with
[1:14:43] your servant today that was the saints
[1:14:44] from pennsylvania told me that
[1:14:48] and other times i'd spoken the word and
[1:14:50] in other words i was it was like god was
[1:14:52] speaking when i was preaching not me
[1:14:54] so i just had to look at my life and i
[1:14:56] just had to examine i said well where am
[1:14:57] i
[1:14:58] i see these attributes in my life and
[1:15:00] now i'm speaking god's word and people
[1:15:02] are hearing directly from god
[1:15:04] so i thought that's my confession
[1:15:08] now if i to fall away if i had to fall
[1:15:10] away uh
[1:15:14] to murder or if i would have thought
[1:15:15] fall away to you know adultery or
[1:15:18] trying to think of some other sins that
[1:15:20] would be idolatry worship brother
[1:15:22] brandon
[1:15:23] well then i would say well i'm not
[1:15:24] probably not born again
[1:15:26] but church after all these years if i'm
[1:15:28] still pressing on if i'm still believing
[1:15:30] god if i see god moving in my life then
[1:15:32] i'm going to keep confessing that's
[1:15:33] where i am
[1:15:34] amen praise god because i i'm not
[1:15:37] i'm not looking at it uh i mean i i'm
[1:15:39] trying to be honest with myself praise
[1:15:41] god i'm trying to be honest with myself
[1:15:42] looking at the word and we gotta
[1:15:45] constantly remain in prayers we said
[1:15:46] stay on our faces stay humble
[1:15:49] let god prove it and live by every word
[1:15:52] every day
[1:15:53] live by the word of god amen
[1:15:56] and when you see that over days and
[1:15:59] weeks and months and years and now
[1:16:00] decades praise god
[1:16:02] then that's the only conclusion we can
[1:16:04] come to praise god
[1:16:06] now if we don't see those things then
[1:16:07] let's come to a different conclusion
[1:16:08] praise god
[1:16:10] but if we see a life that resembles
[1:16:12] christ
[1:16:13] then we can thank god for that let's
[1:16:15] keep our confession amen
[1:16:18] stand to our feet i better do that
[1:16:19] because it's already past the 40 minutes
[1:16:20] all right
[1:16:22] and i'll look at my notes one more time
[1:16:23] to see if there's anything else now at
[1:16:25] the end of every chapter i always put
[1:16:27] action steps because some people just
[1:16:28] like list just give me a list what do i
[1:16:29] got to do
[1:16:31] so the first thing is make sure you got
[1:16:33] faith that's the first thing and then
[1:16:34] get baptized in water
[1:16:37] and then that's the first step make sure
[1:16:38] you're justified all right yeah
[1:16:41] most people aren't even baptized right
[1:16:42] away but you don't need to have the
[1:16:43] right way to be born again like
[1:16:45] cornelius but
[1:16:46] you will if you are born again you will
[1:16:47] go get re-baptized the right way
[1:16:50] and then second step is examine your
[1:16:51] daily actions and your habits do you
[1:16:53] have these clear character qualities
[1:16:55] do you see jesus's brotherly kindness
[1:16:57] living through you
[1:17:01] and then get the holy ghost jesus said
[1:17:03] ask if you want the holy ghost
[1:17:04] ask the heavenly father gives the holy
[1:17:06] spirit to them that ask for him
[1:17:08] and then so the third step is once
[1:17:10] you're born again live boldly
[1:17:12] faithfully for christ and you'll see the
[1:17:13] fruits of the spirit begin manifesting
[1:17:15] in your life
[1:17:17] right you stay faithful to god you'll
[1:17:19] see you'll always see
[1:17:20] yourself as fruitful remembering
[1:17:23] you were bought with a price remembering
[1:17:25] how jesus forgave you of all your sins
[1:17:27] you'll remember that you'll stay near
[1:17:29] the cross and you'll grow in grace and
[1:17:31] knowledge of the lord
[1:17:32] musicians if you'll come here praise god
[1:17:38] i hope that was a blessing tonight by
[1:17:39] god's grace i
[1:17:41] just mad it's so beautiful the word of
[1:17:43] god is so tremendous
[1:17:46] so tremendous remember church jesus
[1:17:48] looked at his disciples the night he was
[1:17:49] arrested
[1:17:50] beforehand he prayed lord sanctify them
[1:17:53] through thy truth
[1:17:54] thy word is true he knew they weren't
[1:17:56] born again
[1:17:58] after his resurrection he breathed on
[1:18:00] them in church that's that's what our
[1:18:02] prayers should be right
[1:18:03] lord sanctify us through your truth
[1:18:06] your word is truth
[1:18:10] how many want to be more sanctified
[1:18:11] praise god i do
[1:18:13] i believe i'm born again but remember
[1:18:15] the scripture also says
[1:18:16] i sanctify myself for their sakes
[1:18:20] praise god but amen you've got a song
[1:18:23] really like
[1:18:24] okay let's see jesus keep me near the
[1:18:26] cross

[1:20:35] received tonight
[1:20:36] will never be taken from us it'll become
[1:20:38] part of our character
