keep song service will be shorter here to get full amount of time for the word and if you come praying up then don't take don't take too many songs to get you ready for the word but of course we appreciate all the songs you understand so let's take a few prayer requests brother Jose having trouble with his teeth that's why I hasn't been coming to service so we will need to pray for him at the end of the service if I remember I'll try to come up and stand in prayer for him so that his teeth can be made well and he can come back to church by God's grace Brotherhood he's been a real faithful brother and has a tremendous testimony about the Lord just doing great things for him so we're thankful by God's grace for him let's pray for healing also brother Chandler from North Carolina he sent me a text and said what a great service it was last night he think brother cam and brother Brooks were there and all the Saints for their labor of love and he just said kind of like an unspoken request for his sister-in-law he said could you please pray for that I said yes we'll be happy to pray for that this morning that's all I have I just also I do want to thank all the Saints last night especially the sisters and the brothers for everybody getting in the spirit there was a you know multiple people crying you know that was probably the best atmosphere we've had in our church probably in five years as far as keeping that atmosphere going for I was almost a four-hour service so I want to thank all the sisters I mean I saw sisters praying I saw brothers crying tears streaming down their face raising their hands people were screaming at the Friends of the Lord people praying on their knees it was just a wonderful atmosphere so I want to thank everybody for creating that atmosphere you've got to yield to the Holy Spirit and last night was a wonderful time of yielding to the Holy Spirit so I want to thank everybody for yielding to the Holy Spirit praise God and it was hot in here and everything like that but nothing like the old meetings right the old meetings used to be real hot I was never in those old meetings I don't know we know before air-conditioning but here's a little testimony for my daughter havens if you want to say this about last night she said last night while I was praying I felt three winds hit me two of them are very strong the last one was more gentle than I got the Holy Ghost God was there as soon as I got in the van I said how was the service Haven she said daddy I got the Holy Ghost she said I don't have to pray for it anymore God gave it to me just so bold and excited and when we pray last night something eternal happened last night and if they if they received eternal life they'll have that forever eternally so thank the Lord for all your prayers all the polling all the everybody getting the spirit to let the Holy Spirit remember you notice it was like up and down in waves right brother Brooks would come over and he said he said get the sing him back up again you see that just you know cuz we get tired but then we need a fresh inspiration and then people would be praying and screaming and up and down that's how the Holy Spirit comes in waves by God's grace he's he just comes in like a flood praise God so we thank the Lord for His mercy any does anybody have any public needs they'd like to share by raising your hand anybody have any requests that we can pray for this morning okay well let's just remember those let's remember Jose's teeth Chandler's sister-in-law will pray for tithes and offerings as well and I do need to apologize I you know I always forget to pass the basket on Wednesday Friday Saturday and Sunday night I just never you know I just never passed the basket except Sunday morning so forgive me I know brother BAM says you're supposed to do it but I don't really think about money too much that's my failure I do get you know I get pressure about money Oh Lord are we gonna pay the bills but
