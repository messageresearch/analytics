[42:08] christ's name
[42:09] the saint said amen praise god god bless
[42:11] you as being seated there
[42:14] malachi can you do me a favor where is
[42:15] he leave okay lydia can do me a favor i
[42:17] left my ipad in there it's got my notes
[42:19] on it
[42:19] uh i forgot to get it out it's in my
[42:21] gray bag if you could just
[42:22] unzip it there so i'd like to start here
[42:25] with a few scriptures
[42:26] let's remind ourselves about uh the
[42:29] importance of the mysteries of god how
[42:31] many know they're really important
[42:32] praise god
[42:33] let's start in revelation 10. we'll go
[42:35] there and just good uh reminder for the
[42:37] children
[42:38] and for uh for us adults as well the
[42:40] importance
[42:41] of the mysteries of god revelation 10
[42:44] 7 when the days of the voice of the
[42:46] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[42:48] sound
[42:49] the mystery of god should be finished
[42:52] as he hath declared to his servants the
[42:54] prophets
[42:56] so god likens all the mysteries as just
[42:58] one one container or one
[43:00] one mystery uh but it's that we know
[43:02] it's a 12-fold revelation
[43:04] he said it's one mystery and it should
[43:06] be completed praise god
[43:08] and so we know and we know according to
[43:11] scripture then it has to be eaten
[43:13] and then it has to be taken around the
[43:14] world because in verse 8 the voice which
[43:17] i heard from heaven spake unto me again
[43:19] said go and take the little book
[43:21] which is open in the hand of the angel
[43:23] which standeth upon the sea
[43:24] and upon the earth and i went up under
[43:26] the angel and said unto him
[43:28] give me the little book oh i'm sorry
[43:31] thank you
[43:31] my bag's back there thank you and he
[43:33] said to me take it up and eat it up and
[43:35] it shall make thy belly bitter but it
[43:37] shall be
[43:38] in thy mouth sweet as honey and i just
[43:40] want to stop on there
[43:41] there's a little thought i had on that i
[43:43] looked up the word bitter
[43:45] you ever think about that how do the
[43:46] mysteries how are they sweet in your
[43:48] mouth
[43:48] but they're bitter in your tongue in
[43:50] your stomach right thank you
[43:53] well we know speaking the mysteries is
[43:55] uh
[43:56] is a is a beautiful thing right being
[43:58] able to share about the mysteries and
[44:00] talk about the mysteries
[44:01] you know we think about how uh we can
[44:03] talk about
[44:05] uh god is one person right and it just
[44:06] it's so wonderful to talk about
[44:08] right and so it's so great to talk about
[44:11] the raptures of revelation right
[44:13] shout voice trump and it is so great to
[44:15] talk about
[44:16] but some of these mysteries uh the bible
[44:19] says when you eat them the bible says
[44:20] that's bitter in your belly and i looked
[44:22] at the word bitter it means grieved
[44:25] and that should remind us of grieve not
[44:27] the holy spirit right whereby you're
[44:29] sealed to the day of your redemption
[44:30] but also should remind us of how the
[44:32] word of god
[44:34] if we don't accept it it grieves us
[44:37] right
[44:38] and if others don't accept it if others
[44:40] turn it down it grieves us
[44:42] so it's wonderful to talk about it's
[44:44] wonderful to share it but when it comes
[44:46] down
[44:47] uh and becomes a part of us right and we
[44:49] realize
[44:50] uh the brevity or the seriousness of
[44:53] god's word
[44:54] it can be a bitter thing because we
[44:56] think my people don't receive this
[44:58] if people don't see this they're turning
[45:01] down god
[45:02] right they're turning down what god has
[45:04] done in this hour
[45:06] god has sent his angel praise god uh the
[45:09] holy spirit right
[45:10] he's brought the word to a seventh angel
[45:13] the seventh angel on the earth has
[45:14] the mystery of god it sounds out and
[45:17] it's taken
[45:18] around the world but john says when i
[45:19] eat it i like to talk about it
[45:22] and testify about it but inside it can
[45:24] be a grieving thing
[45:26] i can be grieved by it how many know the
[45:29] bible says we groan
[45:31] waiting to be clothed with that new body
[45:33] praise god
[45:34] amen why do we groan because the mystery
[45:36] of god is within us
[45:37] but we don't always see ourselves living
[45:39] up to it
[45:41] praise god we see ourselves fall short
[45:43] of the glory of god
[45:44] sometimes we grieve the holy spirit how
[45:46] many can say amen to that
[45:48] sometimes we grieve the holy spirit
[45:50] because we know we've done
[45:51] contrary we've broken the commands of
[45:54] god
[45:55] to some degree so they're they're
[45:57] they're lovely to talk about
[45:58] they're so sweet to discuss but bringing
[46:01] them down and making them a part of you
[46:03] and
[46:04] and becoming one with them can be a
[46:05] difficult process
[46:07] right yeah and how many know sometimes
[46:09] you get roots of bitterness
[46:11] right and you got that that's the
[46:13] bitterness right and there's times we
[46:14] got to
[46:15] uproot those roots of bitterness brother
[46:17] branham calls them complexes
[46:19] right like standing in the gap brother
[46:21] bam says if they don't want to hear it
[46:22] they don't have to
[46:23] he said i'll just leave the field i'll
[46:24] just go uh i'll just go live up in the
[46:26] mountains right
[46:28] but he said he had to overcome that the
[46:30] holy spirit had to correct him
[46:32] from getting a hard heart from getting
[46:34] bitter right
[46:35] because we it's wonderful to talk about
[46:37] but when we see others
[46:39] rejecting it it makes us bitter right it
[46:41] makes it hard
[46:42] it's hard to be rejected but all who
[46:44] live godly in christ jesus
[46:46] will suffer persecution amen
[46:49] there'll be a small group a small number
[46:51] of believers all those who really accept
[46:53] it
[46:54] it'll be bitter in their in their beings
[46:58] because sometimes they transgress it but
[47:00] other times uh
[47:01] you know they're groaning for victory
[47:03] they're groaning for a different body
[47:04] and then they're also grieved by those
[47:06] who don't receive it
[47:08] how many remember paul says in romans 11
[47:10] let me know paul says i wish i was
[47:12] cursed for my brethren
[47:13] that they could see the gospel how many
[47:15] remember that
[47:16] he was so burdened that he would take
[47:19] upon a curse on him
[47:21] to see others would be saved how many
[47:24] grown for your
[47:25] your lost loved ones to be saved and you
[47:27] can relate to that to some degree my i
[47:29] wish
[47:30] i just do anything i would do anything
[47:32] to see my
[47:33] loved ones accept this message praise
[47:34] god and that's the reality
[47:37] of the love of god that paul had in his
[47:40] heart
[47:41] he wanted to see the uh the blinded ones
[47:44] receive the gospel praise god
[47:47] now let's look at another one go to uh
[47:49] deuteronomy 29
[47:50] 29. i wrote down numerous ones here
[47:54] i think it'll be a help to all of us
[47:56] here let's just review the value of
[47:59] mysteries
[48:00] we know uh that god can't finish the
[48:03] great commission
[48:04] until the mysteries have been taken
[48:06] around the world as
[48:07] revelation 10 shared and actually i
[48:09] didn't even read that part
[48:11] but go ahead and read go ahead and go to
[48:12] deuteronomy 29 11
[48:14] and i'll read revelation 10 11. and he
[48:16] said unto me thou
[48:17] must prophesy again before many peoples
[48:20] and nations and tongues
[48:21] and kings so this is a
[48:24] the open book goes to the gentile people
[48:28] every nation every people gets to hear
[48:30] the message before jesus returns praise
[48:32] god
[48:33] amen i'm glad to hear it by god's grace
[48:36] now deuteronomy 29 29
[48:40] why are these mysteries so great why
[48:42] would i spend time preaching on them and
[48:43] writing upon them
[48:44] writing on them and meditating upon them
[48:47] because the bible says
[48:48] the secret things belong unto the lord
[48:50] our god
[48:51] but those things which are revealed
[48:53] belong unto us and to our children
[48:55] forever
[48:55] that we may do all the words of this law
[48:59] see remember god chose israel of all the
[49:01] nations god chose one and he said i'm
[49:03] going to share my law
[49:05] i'm going to share my covenant with you
[49:06] and because you have the covenant you're
[49:08] blessed
[49:09] praise god amen you receive my secret
[49:12] you receive

[49:15] heaven praise god
[49:16] he saw he saw the altar of incest as he
[49:19] said on wednesday right
[49:20] he saw the holiest of holies he saw all
[49:23] these
[49:23] heavenly things and he saw the
[49:25] revelation and he and he created it down
[49:28] here on earth through the
[49:29] the wisdom and skill of the builders the
[49:31] carpenters praise god
[49:33] so these things were revealed from
[49:34] heaven that god's people
[49:37] might receive it that god's people might
[49:38] enjoy the secrets of god amen
[49:41] hallelujah praise god thank the lord
[49:44] that we can know his secrets
[49:46] amen go to uh psalm here
[49:49] uh psalms 25 please psalm 25 verse 14.

[50:01] this morning for the mysteries of god
[50:03] psalms 25 14 and we'll appreciate them
[50:08] for what the bible says they are psalms
[50:11] 25

[50:16] that fear him and he will show them
[50:20] his covenant amen praise god amen
[50:24] who gets the covenant who gets the
[50:26] promise who gets the oath
[50:27] it's them that fear god that receive the
[50:31] covenant
[50:32] that keep his commands those are the
[50:34] ones who get the revelation of the
[50:36] mysteries
[50:37] amen those that really fear god and know
[50:39] there's a creator right
[50:41] and worship the creator and honor the
[50:43] creator they build their lives upon the
[50:45] creator's word
[50:47] hallelujah thank the lord
[50:52] see that church you have the secret of
[50:53] god with you
[50:55] and so much and not just with you like a
[50:57] like a message book of brother branham
[50:59] or a bible
[51:00] but actually in your soul praise god
[51:03] hallelujah the mystery of god is in you
[51:06] praise god the secret of god is in your
[51:08] soul praise god amen
[51:11] thank the lord uh go to uh proverbs now
[51:17] proverbs 3 32 saints proverbs 3
[51:20] 32.
[51:26] just a reminder about the importance
[51:27] remember any every other nation
[51:29] outside of israel didn't have the
[51:31] secrets of god
[51:33] they could guess they could try to
[51:34] worship they knew they were supposed to
[51:35] worship the bible says
[51:37] but they couldn't have the secrets of
[51:38] god because they didn't fear god
[51:41] they didn't love god but only those who
[51:43] feared god and kept his commands
[51:45] those are the ones who got his secrets
[51:48] and brother madam said it's like a man
[51:49] who's engaged to his wife
[51:51] and he whispers all the secrets and
[51:53] tells her all of her his secrets and his
[51:55] future plans
[51:57] hallelujah thank the lord proverbs 3
[52:00] 32 for the
[52:04] fro word is abomination to the lord
[52:06] that's a perverse
[52:08] that means perverseness but his secret
[52:11] is with the righteous praise god so
[52:14] those who live a perverted life and
[52:16] and they they take chances with god and
[52:18] just guess and try to
[52:20] guess it god's will their abomination to
[52:22] god
[52:23] but god reveals his secrets to those who
[52:25] do what's right
[52:26] who are men and women of integrity
[52:28] praise god men and women of honesty
[52:31] men and women who have the character of
[52:33] jesus christ
[52:35] amen thank the lord
[52:38] now to top it all off now there's many
[52:41] more i could do
[52:42] but to top it off let's go to ephesians
[52:44] 3.
[52:46] and this kind of deals with the quote
[52:47] brother branham says about the husband
[52:49] whispering
[52:50] love secrets to his engaged wife or
[52:53] bride
[52:55] ephesians three let's read eight and
[52:58] nine
[53:06] actually let's do ephesians 3
[53:09] 4 ephesians 3 let's start in verse 4.
[53:12] whereby when we read you may
[53:13] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[53:16] of christ
[53:17] which in other ages was not made known
[53:19] unto the sons of men
[53:20] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[53:23] apostles and prophets
[53:24] by the spirit that the gentiles should
[53:26] be fellow heirs
[53:28] and of the same body and partakers of
[53:30] his promise
[53:31] in christ by the gospel amen
[53:34] church every promise you have need of
[53:36] whether it's healing right whether it's
[53:38] salvation
[53:39] whether it's more wisdom praise god
[53:41] whatever promise we have need of
[53:43] we have it through the gospel of jesus
[53:46] christ amen
[53:47] whatever you need of we are fellow heirs
[53:49] we inherit that
[53:51] it's part of our inheritance because
[53:53] we're children of god
[53:54] amen we and god uh god is
[53:58] his testament has been confirmed with
[54:00] the blood of jesus christ
[54:02] right the bible says the testament is
[54:04] confirmed after the death of the
[54:06] testator
[54:08] and jesus die he's the one that made the
[54:09] testament he died
[54:11] so his will is in effect his inheritance
[54:13] is in effect whatever we have need of
[54:15] it's available for us right now
[54:18] amen let's not make it just a future
[54:20] let's make it right now
[54:21] we can possess our inheritance
[54:25] thank the lord
[54:29] verse 7 wherefore i was made a minister
[54:31] according to the gift of the grace of
[54:32] god
[54:33] given unto me by the effectual working
[54:36] of his power so god's power
[54:38] is so great it made paul a minister of
[54:40] this grace
[54:41] before he was a minister of law but it
[54:44] made him fall in love with grace
[54:46] god's grace made him fall in love with
[54:48] grace verse 8
[54:50] unto me who am less than the least of
[54:53] all saints
[54:54] remember church look remember he said in
[54:56] other places
[54:58] remember he said i labored more than all
[55:00] the apostles
[55:01] but here he says i'm less than the least
[55:06] is his grace given that i should preach
[55:08] among the gentiles
[55:09] the unsearchable riches of christ so i
[55:12] guess there's times as
[55:13] a christian you can recognize the amount
[55:15] of labor you give to god
[55:18] but when it when it boils down to it and
[55:20] you look at god's grace for your life
[55:21] you'll always place yourself as lower
[55:24] than the least
[55:24] praise god amen that's why i know i'm
[55:27] the lowest of all the preachers right
[55:29] that's why i believe that amen because
[55:31] paul says i'm least
[55:32] i'm less than the least amen i'm lower
[55:36] than the low
[55:37] amen but yet he was saved by grace he
[55:40] was trusting in grace
[55:41] he was preaching by grace amen and so we
[55:44] do the same today we preach by grace
[55:46] we live by grace we consider ourselves
[55:49] the lowest of the low
[55:50] but we're still in that body we're still
[55:52] christians we're still filled with the
[55:53] holy ghost
[55:54] we still inherit every promise of our
[55:56] father
[56:01] i thank the lord for that praise god
[56:03] hallelujah
[56:07] and this is what i'm trying to get to
[56:08] right here oh it's unsearchable too
[56:10] you just you can never get to the bottom
[56:12] of it praise god
[56:13] year after year decade after decade you
[56:16] just can't you can't get all the way to
[56:17] the bottom
[56:18] of all the riches of jesus christ
[56:21] hallelujah
[56:22] now here it is that verse 9. this is the
[56:23] whole point of where i was going so this
[56:25] is the whole point of this
[56:26] quick review here and to make all men
[56:29] see what is the fellowship
[56:31] of the mystery which from the beginning
[56:34] of the world
[56:35] hath been hid in god who created all
[56:38] things
[56:39] by jesus christ so what is the what's
[56:42] the point of the mystery
[56:44] it's the fellowship that's in christ
[56:47] and what's fellowship intimacy so you
[56:50] got to go back to the picture of husband
[56:52] and wife
[56:54] this is a marriage so the blessing of
[56:56] the the revelation of the mysteries
[56:59] is it shows you have intimacy with your
[57:01] husband
[57:02] with jesus christ with god almighty god
[57:05] only reveals those mysteries to a
[57:07] an intimate person his wife the lord
[57:12] praise god
[57:13] hallelujah praise god thank you jesus
[57:15] amen
[57:16] this is the point of the mysteries to
[57:18] give us intimacy
[57:20] with jesus why do you respect god so
[57:22] much and your friends don't
[57:24] because you've got intimacy with christ
[57:27] how can they go to church but then when
[57:29] they leave they talk about all kinds of
[57:30] evil things
[57:31] they don't have intimacy like jesus said
[57:33] he never
[57:34] knew them right but you know him
[57:37] praise god amen all right amen
[57:42] like my man said if someone mistreat
[57:43] your husband or someone mistreat your
[57:45] wife you want to stand up for him you
[57:46] want to pray you
[57:47] pray for that person that mistreated him
[57:50] why because you know your husband
[57:51] you know your wife you know them there's
[57:54] intimacy there
[57:55] there's fellowship there and that's the
[57:57] evidence
[57:58] uh the evidence of having fellowship
[58:00] with christ is he reveals his secrets to
[58:03] you
[58:03] he reveals his will to you and you know
[58:05] what god likes
[58:06] and so you live the way to please god
[58:09] almighty
[58:12] all right that's a quick review by god's
[58:14] grace oh thank god
[58:16] jesus will say i knew you praise god i
[58:19] knew you were my child
[58:20] i knew you you knew me we knew each
[58:22] other we had intimacy
[58:24] we had fellowship we had a close
[58:26] relation while you were on earth
[58:27] so i came to rescue you off the earth in
[58:29] the rapture
[58:31] hallelujah thank the lord
[58:35] now let's just review real quick there's
[58:37] six reasons with israel now that god can
[58:40] save
[58:41] israel despite her being spiritually
[58:43] blinded
[58:45] okay so the first one is jesus's prayer
[58:47] for forgiveness
[58:50] he prayed father forgive them they don't
[58:53] know what they do
[58:54] i remember wednesday that struck me how
[58:56] jesus said i know that thou hearst me
[58:58] always father
[59:01] so jesus knew whenever he prayed god
[59:04] heard him
[59:06] so if jesus prayed father forgive that
[59:08] blinded group that's crucifying me
[59:10] we know god would have forgave them
[59:13] because jesus prayed for it
[59:14] and the father heard it praise god and
[59:17] jesus don't pray
[59:18] in vain you don't waste his time
[59:19] remember jesus said pray not for the
[59:21] world remember jesus said that
[59:23] right he said i i'm sorry jesus said i
[59:26] pray not for the world that's right
[59:28] i'm sorry jesus did jesus didn't pray
[59:30] for the world because he knew who was
[59:31] saved
[59:32] and who wasn't he said i pray not for
[59:34] the world i pray you keep those
[59:36] that have received my word amen
[59:40] now we are to pray the bible says god's
[59:42] long-suffering that all men might be
[59:44] saved
[59:44] so you and i don't know who's going to
[59:46] be saved so we pray for the lost
[59:49] we pray that god will send for laborers
[59:51] into the harvest we pray that god will
[59:53] send somebody to our families
[59:55] that god will send somebody to the
[59:57] overseas missions right
[59:59] we pray god sends somebody to save the
[1:00:01] lost because we don't know
[1:00:03] but jesus prayed only for the believers
[1:00:06] amen hallelujah so jesus prayed to
[1:00:10] forgive
[1:00:11] those who didn't know they were
[1:00:13] crucifying christ
[1:00:15] and so they would have been forgiven
[1:00:17] because they didn't know better
[1:00:18] right the second reason is paul's
[1:00:22] teaching in romans 11 he says they're
[1:00:25] not all
[1:00:26] he said they're not forsaken for all
[1:00:28] time god's saving the gentiles while
[1:00:31] israel is blinded
[1:00:33] it's a temporary blindness and then he
[1:00:35] says all israel
[1:00:36] shall be saved amen hallelujah
[1:00:40] oh israel all the true faithful
[1:00:43] diligent is israelis will be saved amen
[1:00:48] the third is the foreshadowing in the
[1:00:49] life of joseph
[1:00:53] joseph was good to the his brothers that
[1:00:55] were blinded to his identity
[1:00:56] he didn't starve them out he didn't
[1:00:58] rebuke them he was good to them praise
[1:01:00] god
[1:01:01] and he saved them and gave them a place
[1:01:03] in dostum praise god
[1:01:06] he didn't turn them down the very ones
[1:01:08] who sold him out he was
[1:01:10] good to them and he said don't hold it
[1:01:12] against you
[1:01:13] i don't hold it against you god sent me
[1:01:15] here praise god
[1:01:16] in other words when you were blinded and
[1:01:18] you threw me in the pit and you saw me
[1:01:20] when you were blinded
[1:01:21] god was behind it praise god amen god
[1:01:24] was behind it
[1:01:25] and god will be merciful praise god to
[1:01:28] those blinded jews
[1:01:30] that's the third reason the fourth is
[1:01:32] the fifth seal brother ram said thus
[1:01:34] saith the lord about the fist seal
[1:01:37] he said that the souls under the altar
[1:01:39] were the blinded jews
[1:01:42] right and they said how long lord
[1:01:44] they're crying out for revenge
[1:01:46] you know we know many of them six
[1:01:47] million of them were killed in the
[1:01:48] holocaust right
[1:01:50] but they say how long lord he said i'll
[1:01:51] avenge your blood he said but i'm going
[1:01:53] to give you a white robe as well praise
[1:01:55] god
[1:01:56] and they didn't have the testimony of
[1:01:57] jesus christ they just had the testimony
[1:01:59] of the word amen
[1:02:02] that's what we looked at on wednesday if
[1:02:03] you didn't hear that we looked at the
[1:02:04] heavenly altar of incense
[1:02:06] their souls under the altar right
[1:02:10] and then their souls above the altar
[1:02:12] right that's us
[1:02:13] the believers above the altar and nearly
[1:02:16] near the throne of god
[1:02:17] right the holies of holies but there's
[1:02:20] jewish souls
[1:02:21] under the altar crying how long
[1:02:24] so we know heaven has an altar of
[1:02:26] incense in other words heaven is hearing
[1:02:28] our prayers amen
[1:02:30] there's prayers at the that are going up
[1:02:32] before god almighty
[1:02:34] the high priest says we're hearing our
[1:02:35] prayers he's answering our prayers
[1:02:37] i'm glad he hears our prayers amen
[1:02:39] hallelujah
[1:02:41] so that's thus saith the lord so nobody
[1:02:42] can get beyond that and say well well i
[1:02:44] don't think god can save blinded people
[1:02:46] well he's blind he's blind to the jews
[1:02:48] and saves them praise god
[1:02:50] he promises them white robes
[1:02:53] all right now the sixth and final reason
[1:02:56] here
[1:02:57] is the one we'll look at today again uh
[1:03:00] by the grace of the lord
[1:03:02] okay so the sixth reason is god
[1:03:05] i'm sorry it's the fifth reason i'm
[1:03:06] sorry yeah we're on the fifth reason
[1:03:08] i'm sorry yeah fifth reason i jumped out
[1:03:11] of myself
[1:03:12] this is the fifth reason maybe we'll
[1:03:13] look at the fifth and sixth today if we
[1:03:14] have time
[1:03:15] the fifth reason is god judges every
[1:03:18] person
[1:03:19] based upon what they know so if they're
[1:03:22] blinded god takes
[1:03:23] into consideration they're blinded to
[1:03:25] this so i'll judge them by what they
[1:03:27] know
[1:03:28] that's scriptural so let's look at those
[1:03:30] scriptures here uh
[1:03:32] we'll go through them uh quickly by
[1:03:34] god's grace so see the fiscal jews
[1:03:37] are saved because god uh god help them
[1:03:40] have an overcoming testimony
[1:03:42] even believing uh the covenant of moses
[1:03:45] because they were blinded to the new
[1:03:47] testament
[1:03:48] so because they believed the old one
[1:03:51] god still saved them okay
[1:03:54] so let's but just briefly let's look at
[1:03:57] revelation 12 11. can you pull it up
[1:03:58] there
[1:03:59] revelation 12 11.
[1:04:02] now church this is the picture though of
[1:04:04] the 144 thousand
[1:04:06] but i just want to see i want you to see
[1:04:08] how they overcome
[1:04:10] okay we know this is this has to be the
[1:04:11] 144 000 because brother madam says
[1:04:13] revelation 12
[1:04:14] doesn't deal with the gentiles he said
[1:04:16] it's all jew
[1:04:18] okay so verse 11 and they the 144 000
[1:04:22] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:04:25] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:04:28] they love not their lives
[1:04:29] unto death now church think about this
[1:04:32] if the blind if the holocaust
[1:04:34] jews are saved
[1:04:38] they didn't overcome by the blood of
[1:04:39] jesus did they
[1:04:42] and church let me let me remind you this
[1:04:45] they didn't even overcome by the blood
[1:04:47] of a natural lamb
[1:04:49] because they don't have a nat they're
[1:04:50] not killing animals right now
[1:04:54] that's why they go to the western wall
[1:04:56] and they got those
[1:04:57] hats on i don't even know what they're
[1:04:58] gone but they go there and they have
[1:05:00] their prayers and they push their
[1:05:01] prayers in between the rocks
[1:05:03] and they pray because they know they
[1:05:05] can't sacrifice until
[1:05:06] the temple set up they know that
[1:05:10] so that means all those six million
[1:05:13] holocaust jews and all the blinded jews
[1:05:15] before that
[1:05:16] as they overcame not by the blood of the
[1:05:19] lamb
[1:05:20] because they didn't have a lamb nor the
[1:05:22] blood of jesus
[1:05:23] but they overcome by the word of their
[1:05:25] testimony praise god
[1:05:28] their testimony was we believe moses
[1:05:30] amen
[1:05:31] we believe god's going to send a messiah
[1:05:33] praise god
[1:05:35] and they overcame just by their
[1:05:36] testimony to the word of god and god
[1:05:39] said i'll still honor that
[1:05:41] even though the lamb of god was in
[1:05:43] heaven god says i know you're blind of
[1:05:45] that
[1:05:45] he said but i'll still help you to
[1:05:47] overcome by the word
[1:05:49] that's the power of the word amen
[1:05:52] think about that the power of you and i
[1:05:55] speaking god's word
[1:05:56] i'll not be afraid i'm not going to be
[1:05:59] sick praise god
[1:06:00] i'm not going to be tempted by that in
[1:06:03] the name of jesus
[1:06:04] just speaking the word of god that's
[1:06:06] overcoming power amen
[1:06:09] hallelujah it's overcoming power
[1:06:12] because the blind and jews don't even
[1:06:14] have blood
[1:06:15] to intercede for them all they've got is
[1:06:18] word promises
[1:06:20] and god still saves
[1:06:23] god's still saved based upon the old
[1:06:26] covenant
[1:06:26] and their testimony on overcoming the
[1:06:30] devil
[1:06:32] church that's powerful to me
[1:06:37] just like we've heard it before you want
[1:06:38] to get upset if a blind man's up here
[1:06:39] and he
[1:06:40] he steps on your toes right you want to
[1:06:43] get up if a blind man hit you with this
[1:06:44] cane
[1:06:45] because he didn't know what he was doing
[1:06:47] and god is the same gracious way with
[1:06:49] the jews
[1:06:50] they don't know what they're doing but
[1:06:52] he still saves them
[1:06:53] by amazing grace and as long as they
[1:06:55] receive faith in their heart
[1:06:58] and they overcome by that faith that's
[1:07:00] planted in their heart
[1:07:02] god said i'll save you and i'll give you
[1:07:04] a white robe i'll give you a theophany
[1:07:06] body praise god
[1:07:08] i know an eternal house in the heavens
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:12] god gives them eternal house just
[1:07:14] because they kept the written word
[1:07:16] without the blood because they kept the
[1:07:19] word and they
[1:07:20] they spoke the word they overcame by the
[1:07:22] word they overcame by moses said just
[1:07:25] like we're saying
[1:07:26] brother branham said right joel said
[1:07:28] we're saying jesus said paul said peter
[1:07:30] said
[1:07:30] we're overcoming by the word so are they
[1:07:33] overcoming by the word
[1:07:34] but we've got blood to forgive all of
[1:07:37] our sins so we can have his
[1:07:38] righteousness right now
[1:07:40] praise god and we don't cry out for
[1:07:42] revenge upon our enemies
[1:07:44] we cry out for blessings upon our
[1:07:45] enemies we bless them and not
[1:07:47] curse them because we've got christ's
[1:07:49] righteousness right now amen
[1:07:53] glory that's beautiful ah
[1:07:56] thank you jesus
[1:07:59] and so are saved by grace through faith
[1:08:02] right ephesians 2 5
[1:08:03] or 2 8 you are saved by grace through
[1:08:06] faith
[1:08:07] their faith in moses their faith in
[1:08:10] joshua their faith in that word
[1:08:12] saves them that old covenant praise god
[1:08:17] because god saves you by your personal
[1:08:20] choice he does not force anyone to
[1:08:22] accept grace or faith
[1:08:24] i know a lot of people say i'm
[1:08:25] predestinated to it so i have to do it
[1:08:27] that's not true
[1:08:29] if you're if you're i'm going to preach
[1:08:31] on that again tonight i was listening to
[1:08:33] soul thirst again uh thirst my brother
[1:08:36] branham
[1:08:37] brother graham lays it out plainly god
[1:08:38] cannot force someone to go to heaven
[1:08:41] because he said judas will rise up on
[1:08:42] that day and say well you didn't pick me
[1:08:44] to go to heaven and god would be guilty
[1:08:46] of having favorites
[1:08:48] but man teaches that plainly so it's not
[1:08:51] it's not god forcing us
[1:08:52] it's god uh predestinating and by
[1:08:55] foreign he knows we will receive it
[1:08:57] he knows we will want it then he
[1:08:59] predestinates the
[1:09:00] events of our lives that we can uh hear
[1:09:03] him
[1:09:03] and hear his word and be near to the
[1:09:06] word and love him and receive him and
[1:09:08] serve him all the days of our life
[1:09:12] that's right so each person brother man
[1:09:14] said free more agency
[1:09:16] is in the soul so each person's free
[1:09:19] more agency either accepts
[1:09:21] faith or rejects faith they're either
[1:09:23] saved or lost
[1:09:25] now in the case of the blind of jews
[1:09:27] church all they could do is understand
[1:09:29] the old testament
[1:09:30] and god will judge them accordingly
[1:09:34] if they accept faith in the covenant
[1:09:35] they'll be saved just like noah was
[1:09:37] just like abraham just like moses
[1:09:40] joshua zachariah right john the baptist
[1:09:43] they'll all be saved by their faith in
[1:09:46] the written word of god
[1:09:48] is everybody with me today okay now
[1:09:50] here's what i want to say too
[1:09:53] so that's just the jews now now if we go
[1:09:55] to all humanity so we are just focusing
[1:09:56] on israel
[1:09:57] now let's go to the rest of the world
[1:10:00] the bible says god judges all those
[1:10:03] uh and uh and they're all without excuse
[1:10:06] that's romans one we read it we've read
[1:10:08] it numerous times we're not going to
[1:10:10] read all that
[1:10:10] but let's go uh
[1:10:14] let's go to a scripture here i'd like to
[1:10:16] go to first timothy 4
[1:10:18] 14. let's look at this sin of neglect
[1:10:21] this is why people will be lost because
[1:10:23] they neglected
[1:10:24] to respond to god's word
[1:10:28] and god will judge each person based
[1:10:30] upon
[1:10:31] the inherent knowledge of god already in
[1:10:34] their soul
[1:10:35] already in their human spirit so let's
[1:10:38] go to first timothy 4 14.
[1:10:43] this is why people will be lost because
[1:10:46] they neglect
[1:10:47] they ignore the gift of god that he's
[1:10:50] placed in their life
[1:10:52] okay so this is with the preacher
[1:10:54] neglect not the gift that is in thee
[1:10:56] which was given thee by prophecy with
[1:10:58] the laying on of the hands of the
[1:11:00] presbytery so leave that up there
[1:11:02] so if a preacher doesn't invest in his
[1:11:04] gifts he can be
[1:11:06] guilty of neglecting the the gift of god
[1:11:10] now let's tie this in with the parable
[1:11:12] of the talents
[1:11:13] what did that one talent preacher do he
[1:11:15] went and buried his gift
[1:11:17] in the ground and what jesus said thou
[1:11:19] wicked and slothful servant
[1:11:22] right he said take him into outer
[1:11:24] darkness where there's weeping and
[1:11:25] gnashing of teeth
[1:11:26] church we must not neglect the gift of
[1:11:28] god that's in us amen
[1:11:31] our sisters our brothers our children
[1:11:33] our adults we must not
[1:11:34] neglect the gift of god we must respect
[1:11:37] it we must focus on it and we must use
[1:11:39] it for the kingdom of god
[1:11:41] in other words each day say god use me
[1:11:44] lord whenever if you can use me to pray
[1:11:45] for the sick if he didn't use me
[1:11:47] to win souls amen if you can give me a
[1:11:50] word of knowledge for somebody if you
[1:11:51] can give me a gift of faith if you can
[1:11:53] give me the
[1:11:54] the gift of miracles lord if you can use
[1:11:56] me for anything god
[1:11:57] use me let me be set aside so you can
[1:12:00] use me
[1:12:02] but there's a great sin it's a great sin
[1:12:04] to neglect the gift of god in our lives
[1:12:07] all right
[1:12:08] next one hebrews 2 3. can you pull that
[1:12:10] up hebrews 2 3
[1:12:18] so see all humanity will be judged by
[1:12:20] what they knew about god and how they
[1:12:22] reacted to it
[1:12:24] they'll also be judged by what they
[1:12:25] didn't know if they failed to seek god
[1:12:27] for it i know that's a that's a mouthful
[1:12:28] right there
[1:12:30] they'll be judged by what they didn't
[1:12:33] know if they failed to seek god for it
[1:12:37] we'll get to that in just a moment but
[1:12:39] look at this how shall we
[1:12:40] and paul's not writing to heathens here
[1:12:44] paul's writing to we us how shall we
[1:12:47] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[1:12:52] oh may god may god anoint us to believe
[1:12:54] for deliverance for the lost
[1:12:57] right may god anoint us to believe that
[1:12:59] all things are possible
[1:13:01] there's miracles in the making amen this
[1:13:04] is a great salvation
[1:13:05] god did a great thing when he saved me
[1:13:07] and god can do it in other people
[1:13:11] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:13:12] the lord and was confirmed unto us by
[1:13:15] them
[1:13:15] that heard them see what what great
[1:13:18] what great sin is on those who neglect
[1:13:20] the gospel of jesus christ
[1:13:23] us amongst believers right
[1:13:27] now go to luke 12 47. let's go there
[1:13:34] luke 12 47.
[1:13:42] now this is quite a scripture here
[1:13:45] jesus said they're go there be people
[1:13:48] who get punished
[1:13:50] because they didn't know god's will now
[1:13:53] how can god
[1:13:54] punish somebody who doesn't know his
[1:13:58] will
[1:14:00] and that sermon which knew not his
[1:14:02] lord's will and prepared not himself
[1:14:04] neither did according to his will shall
[1:14:06] be beaten with
[1:14:07] many stripes
[1:14:11] right how is it possible
[1:14:14] that someone who doesn't know the will
[1:14:16] of god gets beaten with many
[1:14:20] it's because they had the opportunity to
[1:14:22] know
[1:14:23] but never ask god to know his
[1:14:25] progressive will
[1:14:27] in other words they knew there was the
[1:14:28] knowledge out there but they didn't seek
[1:14:31] god for it oh aren't you glad you can
[1:14:34] seek god today
[1:14:35] to know more of his will aren't you glad
[1:14:38] you didn't stay at home or
[1:14:39] aren't you glad you didn't go and
[1:14:41] neglect the word of god
[1:14:43] aren't you glad you're seeking god to
[1:14:44] know more of his will that you might do
[1:14:46] more of his will
[1:14:51] praise god
[1:14:54] so see that's it just lines up with
[1:14:56] everything taught in the scripture
[1:15:00] see he's not going to punish i'm sorry
[1:15:02] he's going to punish those
[1:15:04] who didn't know his will because they
[1:15:05] cared so little
[1:15:07] they heard the invitation to the wedding
[1:15:09] supper right they heard the invitation
[1:15:10] of the supper
[1:15:11] they knew about the white robes being
[1:15:13] given out right they knew about the
[1:15:14] wedding garments being given out
[1:15:16] but they failed to look into it they
[1:15:18] failed to seek god
[1:15:20] they failed to consecrate and spend time
[1:15:22] with jesus christ
[1:15:24] that's right
[1:15:28] remember this is upon every continent
[1:15:29] church and
[1:15:31] every nation uh pull up luke 11
[1:15:36] 10.
[1:15:42] luke 11 10.
[1:15:54] all right for everyone that asketh
[1:15:56] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[1:15:59] and to him that knocketh
[1:16:00] it shall be open see so jesus guarantees
[1:16:05] anybody who knocks anybody who seeks
[1:16:08] anybody that asked he said you will
[1:16:11] receive amen
[1:16:12] that's what brother said the first thing
[1:16:14] with patience is not having patience
[1:16:16] with others
[1:16:17] it's having patience with god that if
[1:16:19] you have prayed
[1:16:20] if you've asked god you'll be patient
[1:16:23] for the time he wants to answer your
[1:16:25] request
[1:16:26] glory go to romans 2
[1:16:31] romans 2 verse 14.
[1:16:37] so this is the fifth reason the fifth
[1:16:39] reason is god
[1:16:41] he'll give righteous judgment based upon
[1:16:44] the knowledge that's already in the
[1:16:46] person
[1:16:47] right they know there's a god they they
[1:16:49] know there's right and wrong
[1:16:51] and they've got to make the free moral
[1:16:53] agency choice
[1:16:54] to act upon that and seek after god i
[1:16:57] like how those children are writing down
[1:16:58] notes there i like that praise god
[1:17:00] they're seeking god hopefully they go
[1:17:02] home and study those and look those over
[1:17:03] sometimes
[1:17:04] i took a picture of mine last sunday
[1:17:05] when brother uh big bride was here
[1:17:08] and i emailed it as myself so i didn't
[1:17:09] lose it and i was studying that looking
[1:17:11] okay that's right i gotta get that
[1:17:12] that thought that there you gotta you
[1:17:14] gotta review them
[1:17:15] we're just not gonna write them down and
[1:17:16] be scribed we gotta we gotta we gotta
[1:17:19] eat the book praise god we gotta eat
[1:17:20] them later on amen
[1:17:24] romans 2 14 for the gentiles which have
[1:17:27] not the law
[1:17:28] do by nature the things contained in the
[1:17:30] law these having not the law are a law
[1:17:33] unto themselves so leave that up there
[1:17:35] so any aborigine who doesn't know jesus
[1:17:37] christ the bible said they still have
[1:17:39] god's law
[1:17:40] in them right now preaches over the
[1:17:42] years here but i want to go over it
[1:17:43] again
[1:17:44] verse 15
[1:17:47] which show the work of the law written
[1:17:49] in their hearts
[1:17:50] see god has already written the word in
[1:17:53] their hearts
[1:17:54] their conscience also bearing witness
[1:17:57] and their thoughts the meanwhile
[1:17:59] accusing or else excusing one another
[1:18:04] okay so god sees the leaders in all in
[1:18:06] any nation
[1:18:08] they know they know there's the right
[1:18:09] and wrong and god sees if they uh if
[1:18:12] they accept it or reject it or if they
[1:18:14] let this person slide or they do justice
[1:18:16] here
[1:18:16] god is gonna hold everybody accountable
[1:18:19] for their actions
[1:18:22] amen let me say like this god is gonna
[1:18:24] hold our church accountable for our
[1:18:25] actions
[1:18:27] so we want to do what's right praise god
[1:18:29] and if we see our brother doing wrong
[1:18:31] we're to go to them with what the spirit
[1:18:32] of meekness
[1:18:34] right and correct them because we're all
[1:18:36] going to be held accountable praise god
[1:18:38] now in chapter one i'm sorry wait let's
[1:18:40] read 16. sorry
[1:18:42] this is one of the most beautiful
[1:18:43] scriptures
[1:18:45] in the day when god shall judge the
[1:18:48] secrets of men
[1:18:50] all men all their secrets will be judged
[1:18:52] by jesus christ according to this word
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:56] this message that's what you understand
[1:18:58] this revelation this message will judge
[1:19:00] everyone on the day of judgment praise
[1:19:02] god
[1:19:03] the godhead right the rapture the
[1:19:05] blindness of the jews right
[1:19:07] the one church composed of jew and
[1:19:08] gentile praise god
[1:19:10] all these mysteries all this word it
[1:19:12] will judge them all because
[1:19:14] they all had knowledge of god and they
[1:19:16] all could have heard it
[1:19:17] and got more of it if they just would
[1:19:20] have asked for it
[1:19:22] amen see god can save
[1:19:26] a jew who's faithful then even though
[1:19:29] they're blinded to they're blind to the
[1:19:31] new testament god will save the old one
[1:19:32] because they
[1:19:33] they they were obedient to the law of
[1:19:35] god that was in their heart
[1:19:38] that's why peter said god saves all men
[1:19:41] and any nation who fears god amen
[1:19:45] praise god that's acts chapter 10. peter
[1:19:48] said god
[1:19:48] is respects any man who fears the lord
[1:19:51] in any nation praise god
[1:19:53] hallelujah so it's jesus's unfailing
[1:19:57] promise
[1:19:58] romans 1 i just want to read it this one
[1:20:00] quickly
[1:20:03] romans 1 and this one i don't have yeah
[1:20:05] verse
[1:20:08] 19 and 20. i just want to nail this down
[1:20:11] here by god's grace
[1:20:15] so god's god's law is manifest in every
[1:20:18] person's
[1:20:19] being and the witness of creation
[1:20:23] is a witness against the person if they
[1:20:25] won't accept god
[1:20:26] verse 19 because that which may be known
[1:20:28] of god is manifest in them
[1:20:30] for god has shown it unto them you see
[1:20:33] so god is manifest inside every person's
[1:20:36] being
[1:20:37] and god showed them his power so you see
[1:20:40] the power of god when you wake up in the
[1:20:42] morning
[1:20:42] you see the power of god when you work
[1:20:44] with your hands right maokai and i cut
[1:20:46] some boards the other day we're not
[1:20:47] really big carpenters but
[1:20:49] we can see the power of god you know
[1:20:51] just giving us the ability to cut a boar
[1:20:52] with a scroll saw
[1:20:54] the power of god right the power it's
[1:20:57] just it's in us we got control and we
[1:20:58] can we can cut things
[1:21:00] and sand them down and nail things
[1:21:02] together you know
[1:21:03] the power of god the ability the
[1:21:05] understanding of god we see it in our
[1:21:07] bodies
[1:21:09] verse 20 for the invisible things of him
[1:21:11] from the creation of the world are
[1:21:12] clearly seen
[1:21:14] being understood by the things that are
[1:21:16] made even as a
[1:21:17] eternal power in godhead so that they
[1:21:20] are without excuse
[1:21:22] no excuses on the day of judgment
[1:21:24] because god showed his word it was
[1:21:26] in you and he showed you his word in all
[1:21:28] of nature
[1:21:29] oh my thank god that's why i'm glad i
[1:21:32] see god in the sunrise in the sunset
[1:21:35] and when we see the sun rise we can look
[1:21:37] out the window and say praise the lord
[1:21:38] his mercies to me are new this morning
[1:21:41] praise god
[1:21:42] because i see the sun because i see the
[1:21:45] sun rise and the warmth of it
[1:21:46] that tells me his mercies he's giving me
[1:21:49] a fresh start today
[1:21:50] he's going to be a fresh wine he's going
[1:21:52] to give me new line today praise god
[1:21:55] that's right hallelujah because it's
[1:21:57] understood by the creation of the world
[1:22:00] new heat a new season amen
[1:22:03] all these new things in nature they're
[1:22:05] pointing us to the reality of christ in
[1:22:07] our lives
[1:22:10] glory and each soul is without excuse
[1:22:15] so see blinded jews will be fairly
[1:22:17] judged by the law of moses they heard
[1:22:20] not by jesus's teaching because they
[1:22:23] were blinded to it
[1:22:25] they'll be judged by the law of moses
[1:22:29] because they were ignorant of the new
[1:22:30] testament
[1:22:32] and then each one will get a fair trial
[1:22:34] from the righteous one jesus christ
[1:22:36] hallelujah they'll be judged by their
[1:22:39] knowledge
[1:22:40] that god placed inside of them
[1:22:43] and did they choose to neglect that or
[1:22:46] did they choose
[1:22:47] to accept that praise god
[1:22:50] all right now the sixth reason i'm gonna
[1:22:52] finish up here give me a moment here
[1:22:54] give me ten more minutes let me try to
[1:22:55] finish up here by god's grace
[1:23:00] now the sixth reason the last reason so
[1:23:02] six is the number of anointed man right
[1:23:04] adam was anointed on the sixth day he
[1:23:06] was anointed with no sin
[1:23:09] he had a holy veil of power on him
[1:23:10] praise he could speak to trees right he
[1:23:12] could speak
[1:23:13] to everything number six is the number
[1:23:14] of anointed man but also a fallen man
[1:23:17] number of man
[1:23:20] bill braham said that he said when he
[1:23:21] spoke his sixth squirrel in existence he
[1:23:23] said look that's the number of man
[1:23:25] six anointed but god gave him one more
[1:23:27] seven completion
[1:23:29] but on the sixth one he said look it's
[1:23:31] the number of anointed men
[1:23:32] that wasn't spoken word i think his
[1:23:34] original seed
[1:23:36] now the sixth and final reason is god's
[1:23:39] covenant with
[1:23:39] israel through abraham i've been
[1:23:41] mentioning this over and over
[1:23:43] but let's just look at it by god's grace
[1:23:47] now genesis 12 1-9 we don't have time to
[1:23:50] read it all
[1:23:51] uh we're not going to read it all but
[1:23:53] you you're familiar this is where god
[1:23:55] calls abram
[1:23:56] and he says to separate yourself from
[1:23:58] your family
[1:24:00] and i'm taking you to a land you don't
[1:24:01] know and he says
[1:24:03] the blessings will be on every nation
[1:24:05] well let's just go ahead and turn there
[1:24:06] genesis 12.
[1:24:10] this is god's covenant to abraham
[1:24:18] genesis 12 verse one
[1:24:28] verse 1 genesis 12 1 now the lord had
[1:24:31] said unto abram get me out of that
[1:24:33] country and from thy kindred and from
[1:24:34] thy father's house unto a land that i
[1:24:36] will show thee
[1:24:37] and i'll make of thee a great nation
[1:24:39] i'll bless thee
[1:24:40] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[1:24:43] be a blessing
[1:24:44] and i will bless them that bless thee
[1:24:46] and curse them that curse thee
[1:24:47] and in thee shall all families of the
[1:24:51] earth be
[1:24:51] blessed amen hallelujah every gentile
[1:24:55] nation
[1:24:56] was going to be blessed through abraham
[1:24:58] praise god
[1:24:59] right through abraham everyone
[1:25:03] was going to be blessed so it was a
[1:25:05] worldwide blessing
[1:25:07] the covenant of abraham was going to
[1:25:08] impact the entire
[1:25:10] world but remember this was based upon
[1:25:13] conditions if the people
[1:25:17] followed the lord so go to genesis 18
[1:25:19] 19.
[1:25:21] it was offered to everybody but every
[1:25:23] covenant is based upon conditions
[1:25:29] genesis 18 19.
[1:25:35] so that's why brother brahm says if you
[1:25:37] want to possess a promise he said act
[1:25:38] upon the promise obey the word
[1:25:41] right do something show god you're
[1:25:43] obeying the word of god
[1:25:45] because all conditions have to be met if
[1:25:48] something's lacking
[1:25:50] do something obey the word of god show
[1:25:52] god you're trying to keep the
[1:25:53] commandments praise god
[1:25:57] genesis 18 19 for i know him this is god
[1:26:00] speaking of abraham
[1:26:02] that he will command his children and
[1:26:04] his household after him
[1:26:05] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[1:26:07] to do justice and judgment
[1:26:09] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[1:26:12] that which he hath
[1:26:13] spoken of him praise god amen see that
[1:26:18] see abraham's children after him must
[1:26:20] keep the way of the lord
[1:26:22] in order for god to bring abraham's
[1:26:25] blessings
[1:26:26] upon them you and i must keep the word
[1:26:28] of the lord
[1:26:30] if we want to see it upon our children
[1:26:32] we've got to keep the word lord
[1:26:33] it's accountable to us it's conditional
[1:26:35] to us and we must meet god's conditions
[1:26:38] right
[1:26:39] and he'll give us the strength to do it
[1:26:41] praise god
[1:26:43] amen jesus said come unto me all ye that
[1:26:47] we're in a heaven laden he said i'll
[1:26:49] give you rest for your souls
[1:26:51] but you've got to come if you want rest
[1:26:54] if you want freedom if you want victory
[1:26:56] you've got to come to jesus amen you've
[1:26:58] got to come to him
[1:27:00] it's conditional you got to come you've
[1:27:02] got to leave behind and lay aside every
[1:27:04] weight and sin that
[1:27:05] be every besetting sin that hinders you
[1:27:08] and you've got to come to jesus and run
[1:27:09] the race
[1:27:10] with grace
[1:27:13] genesis 18 19 as you saw abraham's
[1:27:16] children must keep the way of the lord
[1:27:20] go to deuteronomy 11 26.
[1:27:42] deuteronomy 11 26 behold i set before
[1:27:45] you this day
[1:27:46] a blessing and a curse 27 a blessing
[1:27:49] if if you obey
[1:27:53] the commandments of the lord your god
[1:27:54] which i command you this day
[1:27:56] and a curse if you will not obey the
[1:27:59] commandments of the lord your god
[1:28:01] but turn aside out of the way which i
[1:28:03] command you this day
[1:28:04] to go after other gods which ye have not
[1:28:06] known
[1:28:08] praise god
[1:28:14] now go to isaiah 49 13
[1:28:17] isaiah 49 13. i'm almost done here
[1:28:24] now here's here's i'll say like this uh
[1:28:29] here's the sinful attitude of many
[1:28:31] people today that say god is forsaking
[1:28:33] me
[1:28:33] or god doesn't care that's impossible
[1:28:37] that's impossible god would never do
[1:28:40] that
[1:28:40] god would as long as you have a desire
[1:28:42] to know god god wants to know you praise
[1:28:44] god
[1:28:46] now a thousand years after abraham
[1:28:50] israel had possessed the promised land
[1:28:52] but yet they corrupted themselves
[1:28:54] through idolatry and look what isaiah
[1:28:57] records
[1:28:58] israel sang
[1:29:01] he said sing o heavens and be joyful o
[1:29:04] earth and break forth and to sing you
[1:29:05] know mountains
[1:29:06] for the lord hath comforted his people
[1:29:08] and will have mercy
[1:29:10] upon his afflicted now let's just pause
[1:29:12] right there
[1:29:14] why should we break forth why should the
[1:29:15] earth sing because god is going to have
[1:29:18] mercy on you and i
[1:29:19] praise god i know and israel now we know
[1:29:22] this is the israel
[1:29:22] but which of you how many of you are
[1:29:24] trusting in god's mercy today
[1:29:27] you should rejoice then praise god
[1:29:29] that's
[1:29:30] what the bible says let all the heavens
[1:29:32] let all nature rejoice
[1:29:34] because god is going to be merciful to
[1:29:36] israel
[1:29:38] mercy rewrote my life
[1:29:43] i should have vanished my soul crashed
[1:29:45] down
[1:29:47] but mercy rewrote my life
[1:29:50] see next verse
[1:29:54] but zion said the lord has forsaken me
[1:29:58] and the lord hath forgotten me so see
[1:30:01] god is saying
[1:30:02] you must trust in mercy but god's people
[1:30:05] got so sinful and so defeated
[1:30:07] they'd say god doesn't love me anymore
[1:30:10] god doesn't care about me
[1:30:13] god god's not going to keep his promise
[1:30:17] can i say like that that's the loser's
[1:30:18] toolbox can i just say it like that
[1:30:20] and we had in football we had a winner's
[1:30:22] toolbox and we had a loser so much
[1:30:24] you can't use the tools that are losers
[1:30:26] tools right
[1:30:28] in other words that's a that's a bad
[1:30:29] confession can i say like that
[1:30:31] that's a box of rattlesnakes right
[1:30:34] oh nothing good nothing good will ever
[1:30:37] happen to me i'll never get well
[1:30:39] god will never answer his prayers god
[1:30:40] don't care about me stop confessing the
[1:30:43] devil's lies
[1:30:44] and accept the word of god amen
[1:30:46] hallelujah don't take a
[1:30:48] a negative confession speak the word be
[1:30:51] positive
[1:30:51] trust god's command because god is
[1:30:53] faithful
[1:30:55] now the next next verse explains why
[1:30:57] were they saying such foolish things
[1:31:00] look at verse 15. can a woman
[1:31:03] forget her suckling child that she
[1:31:06] should not have compassion on the son of
[1:31:08] a womb
[1:31:08] yay they may forget
[1:31:12] yet i will not forget thee
[1:31:15] keep that up there god was saying
[1:31:17] israel's like a little baby
[1:31:19] that thinks it's forsaken and is crying
[1:31:23] and complaining god doesn't care about
[1:31:25] me god doesn't love me
[1:31:27] and the whole time god's like you're
[1:31:29] like a crying little baby
[1:31:31] right how could god how could god a
[1:31:35] loving parent how could a loving parent
[1:31:36] ever forsake a suckling child
[1:31:39] a little baby child god said i won't
[1:31:41] forsake you praise god
[1:31:43] see god is so much higher he's so much
[1:31:45] greater he's a heavenly
[1:31:47] eternal parent he cares about his
[1:31:49] children praise god
[1:31:51] and when we feel like he doesn't care
[1:31:53] god just wants to sometimes promise that
[1:31:54] god just wants you to cry it out
[1:31:56] so he likes to hear your cries amen he
[1:31:59] likes to hear that you need him and you
[1:32:01] love him
[1:32:02] and he wants fellowship he wants
[1:32:04] intimacy with you praise god
[1:32:06] next verse he said i will not forget you
[1:32:10] behold i have graven thee upon
[1:32:12] the palms of my hands thy walls are
[1:32:15] continually before me praise god
[1:32:18] so jesus mother god says father mother
[1:32:21] jesus
[1:32:22] god almighty heavenly father papa god is
[1:32:25] holding israel and he's got nail scars
[1:32:28] behind there
[1:32:29] hallelujah jesus is holding israel said
[1:32:32] i won't forget you baby right i won't
[1:32:34] forget you little child
[1:32:35] because i've already purchased you with
[1:32:37] the scars in my hands praise god
[1:32:39] i love you so much i went to the cross
[1:32:41] and died for you praise god
[1:32:43] i'll never forsake you i'll never leave
[1:32:45] you i purchase you with my own blood
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:48] hallelujah i'm faithful hallelujah i'm a
[1:32:51] caring god
[1:32:52] my mercy's new you are held in my hands
[1:32:55] amen
[1:32:57] i've directed every step of your life
[1:32:59] and right now i'm holding you in my
[1:33:01] nail scarred hands i purchase you you're
[1:33:03] mine i will take care of you
[1:33:06] let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:33:08] hallelujah
[1:33:10] see when we say where's god and oh woe
[1:33:13] is me and
[1:33:13] my life is awful god don't care about me
[1:33:16] god says i do care
