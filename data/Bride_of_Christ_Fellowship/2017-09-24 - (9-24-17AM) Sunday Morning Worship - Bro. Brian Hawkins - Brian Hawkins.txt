you appreciate all that you do everything that you provide and Lord you see fit to meet each and every one of our needs like the brother said whether its financial or whether it's an encouragement whether it's a healing touch we have need up in our bodies is Lord we singing that song only believe that's all we need to do learn is to believe in that state in your word and faith into your promise of God faith that you are who you say you are oh God Gouri just our faith is anchored in what you've told us in your scriptures oh god there's something within us that just tells us that it makes a heart to say Amen oh God there's just something within us that telling us I know this is right I know that I can obtain it I know that there's something there there's something that I can receive from God there's there's an entity there and then all I had to do is reach out and touch them just think of that woman that all she wanted to do is reach out and it touched Jesus that hem of Jesus garment that she was made home didn't have that faith this morning just to reach out to Jesus Christ was born then we could touch him or he is a high priests of the feeling of our infirmities he knows what how we feel in our pain situation he knows how we feel in our in our needs are and whatever it might be he understands those because he came down into flesh as a man to experience those things because his God of the Spirit II didn't know how it was but Lord we just appreciate that the promises that you've given us and we thank you for lending us a better year here to hear our our petitions for bring it forth before you this morning Oh God Lord as we open up your scripture open up your word this morning we just pray the to it that you would bless the word the reading of the word and the administering of your word this one I just asked for your blessing spirit to cover though I think to speak to your children to speak to your people to speak to your bride here this morning Oh God there's nothing good with Timmy Lord there's there's no great skill that I have to come and preach the Word of God but lord I do believe that it's the calling that you've laid upon me this morning that's my life this morning I just pray the tuba company to get out of the way the Lord more importantly help to each and every one of us to get out of the way that we each one of us can hear the word coming forth to our hearts with smoke up Lord we love you and we appreciate you bless brother Jesse wherever he may be better straight and I believe it's in New York somewhere I'm not sure but when Lord you know exactly where your people are and then we just pray that you'd just be with him wherever he is just want to be with our pastor as he ministers today unless your bride all the way around the world Oh God how pray that you would speak something to somebody's heart this order of God that it's the condition of backsliding whatever it might might be the Lord I know that you could address the needs this corner for you have you've done it so many times before and I'm just counting on you this morning then Jesus Christ thing we ask if I don't get you some spices we don't want you falling asleep anyway he would turn to Matthew 25 usually if I get to more my kids pretty sleepy if I said still 5 and verse 1 it says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh thank you you may be seated for real this time but I just hope you don't think to yourself this morning as we read the scripture because this has being covered so many times it should be a very familiar scripture to everybody that though oh no here he goes on the on the five foolish and and the five wise virgins again you know but one thing we can't let this work do is just to become a commonplace to us but something I want you to pay institute is when the bridegroom came out that only five of these ten virgins were ready for the coming and five were not ready so what I'd like to speak on this morning is a day late and disappointed but as we read through this each of these virgins had a choice to make it wasn't something that was automatically the oil wasn't just later in their laps and say and take thy knees and just just wait for the call to come and when the call comes that you'll be ready it didn't happen that way there's a choice that had to be made five were wise that they already had the oil they were prepared the other five didn't have the oil they were unprepared so that's the differences one was ready one was not one group was ready one group was not but if I believe and we're anticipation to meet the bridegroom the other five were just sitting in the background procrastinating half expecting the bridegroom to be real and actually show up so that's the condition that they were in is they weren't exactly sure if that bright bird they heard about the bridegroom but they didn't know if he was real or not no I'm just kind of speculating I don't mean to add or take away but just kind of enter in the way that I think a little bit just kind of picture these virgins in the background they're just you ever get into that spot where you well I don't know if the Lord why why am i walking this walk is this is this really real and so you go to church service service after service and you're around people and you you might be pretending that you're that you're a believer I don't know the position that everybody's in I don't know your heart I don't know the type of life that you live my privilege is I get to come in and visit once in a while and say some things that if Lord hits your heart then then move on with it take it accept it and move on with the Lord and man but you get into that spot well I don't know if God is really real or not I don't know if I could really receive the healing or not it the promises laid laid here for me they say that I could be healed if I could just believe in the Lord Jesus but I'm not healed yet well you haven't given your whole self to God yet you haven't given that whole faith you haven't actually believed that he is who he is so therein lies that problem is you got the half half faith and a half doubt those times that you're up on the mound you've got the faith that you feel that you can conquer all but down in the valley you have that doubt well you got to have that same faith that's up on the mountaintop you gotta have that same faith down in the valley to get you out of the valley so these these five foolish words were procrastinating half expecting the bridegroom to be real and actually show up you know we've heard so many times that that the end is near get ready the the the end time is coming well the thing is is we don't know exactly when when it's going to be coming so we continue to make ourselves or try to get ourselves grooving and ready for that coming because we don't know when it's coming we don't know the hour we don't know the day and all these people that that that think that they have the revelation or I know the day it's going to be September 23rd of whatever year we're on I think I just heard another one I think it was September 23rd so all these people they say well it's going to be November oh it's going to be whatever it is it's a false prophecy it's a false revelation because even Jesus didn't know the day or the hour and he had a closer relationship with with the father than what we did so all these things we don't know but we have to be ready we must be fully persuaded in some cases this is okay but that you that you kind of have to expect some things but not this this is a matter of life and death a matter of where you're going to spend eternity is that right but Matthew 24 and verse 42 it says watch therefore for you know not what hour your Lord doth come but know this if the Goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched him would not have suffered his house to be broken up now you take a US citizen if he knew what time the thief was going to come into his house he'd be calling the National Guard he'd be calling Army Reserves he'd be calling the police state troopers whatever it might be at every window would be loaded with a firearm waiting for that thief to come but that's if he knew when that thief was going to be coming because he'd be prepared waiting for that thief to give that thief what he had come so the same thing we must be ready with the same of anticipation to keep to keep those that would try to influence us out of this rapture out of this this walk with the Lord out of this blessed gospel that we should hold so dear now because there are people they're going to try to talk you out of it I'm sure you've already encountered them already look at I don't have to tell you you can see what's happening in this day you just turn on the news a little bit and you can see what's happening they're trying to get rid of they're trying to get rid of us all together but in verse 44 says therefore be also ready from in such an hour as you think not the Son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord have made ruler over his household to give them meat and due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing that is a responsible servant that is a responsible disciple when he's contented continuing to make himself ready continuing to stay steadfast in the Word of God verily I say unto you that he shall make him a ruler over all his goods isn't it nice to know that we're gonna go somewhere he's got a mansion prepare for us and we're gonna rule and reign with him amen he was kind of laying out what he has in store for us those that follow his commandments those that follow into the way and the truth of the life the truth of the way but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth now you go in first forty nine it says it shall begin to smite his fellow servants and eat and drink with the drunken do we not see that in this hour that the people that used to go to church now they got tired of waiting they have fallen away they have left the faith they have left God and now they come and persecute those that are stayed and remain faithful they're starting to smite the service because their patience has run out they can't wait any longer amen but you might think there's messages for the unconverted but I'm trying to talk to those that have been once enlightened it still applies to the unconverted also I don't I don't know everybody in here but uh but you may think that you have time to get right but there's there's a it Ecclesiastes 3 says to everything there is a season any time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant at a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance now we know Jesus said those that weep now shall rejoice later amen so a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to Rend and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak die pay attention to that one we're going to try to get into that a little bit not not specifically but I hope you get it this morning but a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace now again I don't want to try to add or take anything away but there's a time of play and there's a time of work you kind of get that you kind of get that in Ecclesiastes it doesn't exactly say it that way but there's a time to play and there's a time to work by the time the play is passed now it's time to work and we must work diligently to get ourselves ready is that right but we should see in this day that that it's getting so close at play time we can't play time anymore we should be we should be entering into we're women that mature bride that he's looking for it's we've come too far to turn back now is that is that right you know who wants to turn back now after all that I've done and let's say I gave I was baptized in 2002 so 15 years I spent 15 years trying to come this far that the Lord has brought me why would I want to turn back now all the work that's gone into it all the trials although all the tribulation all the battles that I've faced was it in vain for me to turn back now but but you may say well what do you mean I must get ready I'm always told that I can't do anything for salvation that's right you can't do anything for salvation I'm not talking about salvation salvation is is deliverance to unpack the baggage of worldly things so you could get ready for rapture salvation is of deliverance you removed whether it's smoking drinking cussing riotous living whatever it might be that's salvation salvation is deliverance it's taking you it's taking that baggage off of you so you don't have to carry that weight anymore you can make the journey with other without on all that extra baggage is that right but when you get ready for supper you go in and clean yourself up you wash your hands or whatever you need to do to get yourself prepared to eat a meal now when you go somewhere special like a a wedding supper there's more involved to get ready it's not enough to say I spoke in tongues it's not enough to say I prophesied it's not enough to say I pray for so-and-so and they were healed it's not enough to say I spoke in tongues it's not enough for all that it's not enough to say that God sent a prophet because it's more than the Prophet and it's more than tongues and more than prophesying or even healing it's more than that the rapture is the brides revelation it's a revelation to the bride the rapture is our preparedness for revelations tells us the bride has made herself ready someone when some women have to get themselves all dull now I'm not going to try to knock women so don't think I'm going to do that but some women have to get themselves all dolled up before they go anywhere or the show their faces anyone if someone if the salesman was to come knocking on the door and they just the woman just gets out of bed they're not going to go run it to the door they gotta go make themselves ready to presentable amen so they're making themselves ready to face them the world that day but there are other women that are working on their character to face her Lord on that great day amen so there's a difference between a godly woman and a worldly woman a worldly woman is getting all dolled up too so she can uh I don't know make me make men desire after or make other people that sure is one pretty woman but you know I was just talking to some young girls I think it was yesterday just talking to him I asked them now it's a personal question when you talk to to the girls and I understand that when you ask them well do you have any do you have any desire to put on makeup and and stuff like that you know and out of not to be shamed into anything that they might they might fire off real quick no I I don't want to have that desire you know I you know how you get you get defensive because you don't want to admit to anything so I'm not saying this is what they were doing but I just told him I said you don't have to tell me if you don't want to but just to tell them my perspective before I was saved and you could ask my wife I didn't like makeup back then and I don't like makeup now and I told these young girls I said I'll tell you something about makeup it stinks I couldn't stay in the smell of it you'd ask my wife I'd always tell her cars but I think a woman looks more beautiful in her natural appearance and you know these women they try to put on all this makeup to look pretty because they think the men like it you talk to most men most men don't like makeup a lot of a lot of men don't like makeup I've talked to a lot of guys and they don't they don't like the makeup either so the women are putting it on in vain because a lot of men don't like it but there's a preparedness we're working on our character in this day we're not so much about it worried about our our natural appearance or at least we shouldn't be yeah you want to make yourself presentable you don't want to go out look at like a slob if you're going out for a job interview I'm not talking about that I mean there's a time to go out and make yourself presentable but there's a time when it become so vain to you that's all you think about is being so pretty and why you're trying to make yourself look pretty you know it's okay to to put on a suit and tie comb your hair because you want to make yourself presentable because you want a job it might be a banking job where you have to deal with people customer service or something it might be a Walmart greeter you know they don't want somebody with their you know looking shabby they want somebody that looks presentable the Lord Jesus isn't gonna want some shabby look a woman that is unkempt it doesn't take care of herself she hasn't worked on her character she's looking for somebody who's worked on that character a man her brother branham said that's the only thing we're gonna take with us I do believe but you can't sell or you can't share your character each person has to develop their own character so when he comes there's no time to develop it it has to be ready for when he comes as a thief in the night now I'm sure you I'm pretty sure I've said it here but back in when I was in the military we had where there were mobility bags you had to have all your all your uh your uniforms that you that you might have needed you had to have that in there all your toiletries your soap shampoo all that stuff you had to have some of that in your bag because as soon as they call you got to go you have 24 hours to respond and and when you're called to to go serve in a war you don't have time for all that other stuff so that's why you're supposed to have a mobility bag ready so all you have to do is grab that bag and you go get ready for your deployment same thing no you got to have you got to have your backpack you got to have everything ready in line for that time when he comes and says come with me now we know that the word rapture is not in the Bible everybody knows that because when you start arguing about why not argue when you have it discussion about Trinity with somebody they you might say well Trinity is not in the Bible well some of them shoot right back well rapture is not in the Bible either well yes it is the definition of it is in the in the Bible the actual word rapture is not in the scripture but first let alone ian's 4:17 it says then which we then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now what is the definition of a rapture this was out of the lexicon it means to sieze carry off by force to seize on claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out or away cut up your getting taken away this is the free dictionary so it could be unbeliever putting the making these definitions I don't know but we'll read what they have to say anyway the transporting of a person from one place to another especially to heaven by supernatural means rapture an event in the I'm not even going to be able to pronounce that name I'm not a scholar so es CH aetiology so assault eschatology I'm not sure what it is I should have looked it up I usually do but I'd I think I read at a time but of certain Christian groups in which believers in Christ will be taken up to heaven either prior to or at the Second Coming now I'm sure many of you have thought to yourselves you know especially new converts or even when we get stuck stuck in a rut we we tend to think why I mean Lord why did you choose me I'm so full of faults and failures I have nothing to bring how am I going to go in a rapture how is it that you would even be remotely interested in me anybody ever think that it's okay to be honest this morning I'm I'm honest with you all well you might say why me Lord I'm not worthy for you to choose me but I thank you for it I'm not worthy for you to come visit me just like the Centurion you know even the Centurion said Jesus told I'm come to your house he says oh no I'm not even worthy for you to even enter in through the the door of my house I'm not worthy of but see that's a humility it's just like we could relay - that that Centurion that said I'm not even worthy for you to come we could also relate to that man that was at the Pool of Bethesda is that right uh-uh all those people you know when when the Lord came up to me says well why aren't you here how come you're not going into the pool he says I have no man to help me but out of all those people Jesus chose that one man and of all those people in there to heal to even talk to and he even gives the privilege of healing so I could imagine in his mind why me why did you choose me I'm not worthy of it oh my but we truly are not worthy of his love for we or not we were not a people according to 1st Peter excuse me but we were not a people but now are we the sons and daughters of God which makes us worthy by His righteousness we were not his people in time past but since Jesus came into my heart I am his you are his you know I wasn't going to talk on this but I just came across something I just feel - to say just an experience that I've had talking to somebody not physically but I was on Facebook I wasn't being honest it was on Facebook and somebody had they were talking about tape ministry and and well something came up about revelations 23 and there's only 22 chapters in Revelations but I think they're their reference and I'm not trying to belittle anybody by any means I'm getting to something uh wherever they get this this doctor and I don't know for sure but talking you know just she was talking about brother Branham how he could how he could be revelation 23 and then she went on to say well he's Bible he's in the scripture and I set my reply but at the end I wanted to tell her I said you know I don't believe that brother Branham would be revelations 20 through 23 but I said you say that he is in the Bible because you believe that he's revelation 23 you know you also are scripture you also were in the Bible you know people want to try to put brother Brandon way up here and they say he's in the Bible he's in the Bible and and they just talk him up so much that I think they forget about themselves well well you're also in the Bible are you not the pearl of great price are you not the Bride of Christ when revelation 22 where it says the spirit and the bride say come are you not part of the bride if you if you don't feel that you're part of the bride and now sometimes I don't feel that I'm part of the bride because I make false but we've got to have that faith if we can't have enough faith to for a headache how are we gonna have enough faith to to go into a rapture amen so you're just as much Scripture as brother Brandon with Scripture as Jesus Christ as a scripture if you are grounded in faith in Jesus Christ you are just as much Scripture now she went on to say something about preachers I know about preachers and I haven't got a response back yet but but what do you know about preachers brother Branham was I know I'm treading on dangerous ground depending on who you talk to but brother Branham made mistakes just just like we as laity or ministry with it you know he made mistakes just as just as well as we did so what we ought to do is exalt Jesus Christ above any man of this land I don't I don't care what man it is I don't care if it's Donald Trump I don't care if it's Barack Obama I don't care if it's Putin over there and I don't care who it is hey Jesus Christ there's one that ought to be exalted more than anybody amen I know because she said something that probably won't leave me astray and uh well Jesus Christ won't lead me astray hey man so I have one that's a little bit well a lot more important then you understand what I'm saying is uh so brother branham even spoke about he exalted Jesus Christ he put Jesus Christ up here we ought to do the same now so we exalt ourselves no because he who exalts himself shall be abased amen so we don't want to have that pride and say well I'm better than so so no it's not like that is that okay this morning I'm sure bill Jesse feels the same way as I do I just think God that I'm one of his maybe we sing that song I'm one of them on one of them so if you're one of them you're in the scripture too but we as men we it is uh we think well I'm not worthy of that how can I say that well you know even even the Devils in the scripture yeah I mean why can't you place yourself in the scripture you know by His stripes Brian Hawkins is healed by his stripes brother John Graham is healed no so what was that young man he or he was talking about put yourself in this scripture you know because he is talked about you if that's a promising in your heart you could say Amen you can relate to it I can relate to that scripture that's for me well put your name in there and you repeat it over and over and over again and then that that's the way brother Brant Artie says if you want to if you want him you say I'm healed and you keep repeating it until you believe it amen because I'm here to tell you the adversary is going to be right there behind it and pound it you're not healed pounded you're not healed you're not healed so you have to combat it well yes I am yes I am God will provide for me he's Jehovah Jireh mr. Oliver Sharma his job all these different names are redemptive names of Jehovah God is still God just because somebody's telling you that he's not just because you say heaven isn't for real doesn't mean that it's not for real it says say you don't believe it I'm not I'm not entering his gates by someone else's opinion it has to be my experience amen but they when we read that blessed word our heart said Amen not everyone has that wonderful privilege no matter how much truth you set before them you can drown somebody in truth and they still might not see it but it won't make a difference if they won't accept it they must come God's provided way there are no shortcuts no cliffnotes no cheat sheets or any special treatment forgot not a respecter of persons he has sent his message now we must receive it or be left behind it's cut and dry there's no grayer Jesus told a parable about uh Moses in the prophets and I don't even know what time it was a contractor are y'all worried about time let's see we're in Luke chapter 16 and verse 22 it says and it came to pass that the that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus Lazarus and his bosom and he cried and said father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame but Abraham said son remember that thou in my lifetime receive a sight good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and now our tormented the tables have turned so and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from there then then he said I pray thee therefore father that that would have sent him to my father's house for I have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said nay father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto them if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead so no matter what miracles no matter what testimony that you try to tell these people no matter how it's truth you lay before them if they can't say it they're not going to say it if they can't see it they can't accept it so blessed are our eyes that we could see blessed is our spirit that has been renewed amen but the problem is is people don't believe what they say they believe so surely they don't live what they say they believe they will be sadly disappointed on that day this is what brother Branham says in Satan's Eden it says and again it is religious sin as at the beginning so deceitful watch it now it's not just purely old everyday sin committing adultery and getting drunk and using God's name in vain that's not it no you remember years ago many of you hear the old timers remember that sermon I preached on and I tried to find this where I can't find it unless it's a different title it says the disappointments at judgment the harlot she ain't gonna be she ain't going to be disappointed there she knows where she is going the drunkard ain't going to be disappointed there the bootlegger the gambler the liar the thief he is not going to be disappointed but the man who thinks he's right there's the disappointment that's the fella say come say Lord heaven I preached the gospel have not I cast out devils in thy name and Jesus said depart from me ye that work iniquity I never even knew you there's the disappointment see the deceitfulness that's uh he says that's where I'm so misunderstood it's not that I want to be different I don't want to be different but I've got to be honest I have a message and that must go to the people makes it very much misunderstood of much the people they think I'm against everybody they only know I'm for everybody and trying my best to bring them to what's the truth just as its laid on my heart and the way it's laid in the Bible here so people thought that he didn't like them and that he didn't like women that he didn't like them that he didn't like the people but he loved him he wanted to set them in the straight path amen he wanted to correct the errors and God proves that to be the truth so there is nothing else can be done about it so be they look at it or they don't you know a lot of times I worry about you know trying to to give a testimony or try to talk to somebody and then I'm thinking of my heart well well what if they don't see it you know how come I come I can't get people converted because no matter what you say like I said you could drown somebody in truth you can have you conceived a testimony after testimony after testimony what is it a prophet visit South Africa or some of the book is just full of testimonies and uh they could read that they could see that they could hear that but it doesn't mean that they're going to believe it which is sad because it's it's it's frustrating because you try to you try to persuade people but we don't want to talk people into a false birth you know so you got to be careful in that aspect that you don't push and push and push and push to where they get tired of okay I'll give in to what you're saying because we don't want false birth amen so you just continue to preach the truth you continue to stand firm or what you believe on your convictions you know I know I've said it before that I try to live by the the I can't even think of what they're called down I try to live by the the saying you better I know I've said it here before then if I'm a nice thirsty give him something to drink don't put a fire hose in his mouth you know you can lay off Scripture you could lay out truth you can just put it before you but if when you're trying to shove it down their throat and try to shove it and shove it shove it you got to believe this you got to believe this you got to believe this well I've heard it once said that preach the gospel use words if necessary you know the people are going to watch you to see if you actually believe and live it believe what you what you're trying to get them to believe amen so it's it's not just at all what you say it's all of what you do but like we said we we can't force anyone to believe it I'm gonna wind down here in a couple minutes probably everybody knows Eli in the scripture and Samuel I'm probably gonna say his sons names wrong huffner and you know some people say finna has or I say finance so however you want to pronounce him but but they still did wrong I don't care how you pronounce it but he'll I thought his sons would come around but God means business you know he said a man said your your boys are doing wrong you know you got to straighten him out well you didn't do anything about it so when somebody comes and says to you you're not doing right straighten up how do you respond to them you know I preach the message years ago about accepting accepting rebuke some people cannot accept rebuke because of the too much pride gets in the way they had that wall of pride up there where you're not going to tell me what to do but if it's scriptural and you know you're doing it get yourself right you got to get yourself right you got to get yourself ready nobody else could get you ready it's a personal thing I can't get you ready your mom and dad can't get you ready your brother your sister your your wife your husband they can't get you ready you have to get you ready the responsibility falls upon you but Allah I thought his sons would come around but God means business Eli told us us to quit living in their wickedness because they were causing the women too they were causing the people to sin no but there was no repercussions from Eli Eli just said hey stop doing it but he didn't there were no punishments there were no repercussions and just like in this day people are they're not responsible for their own actions you know they want to blame everybody else they want to blame this party they want to blame white people they want to blame black people they want to blame government they want to blame church they want to blame this I want to blame that well nobody told you to throw the brick through the window you did that on your own nobody told you to go in that house and steal things you did that on your own nobody told you to puncture somebody's tires you did that on your own but there's a time that if you do the crime you do the time that's how I grew up that's how I learned it you got to face up to your responsibilities you do something wrong you pay the price for it but isn't it nice not all of us could can do what Jesus did by going and paying the price for us amen I heard this this story one time about an Indian chief I can't I can't exactly remember what they were what the people were doing but he he laid down the law I think if they were caught stealing then they were going to whip him put him on a whipping post and whip him well there was a person that was caught stealing and they said well bring him to me well it turns out that it was his own mother so the people are just waiting to see what decision he was going to make because is he going to let her go because it's his mother well he was thinking when I can't do that because then the people get unruly you know that I won't be much of a leader if I back down on what I said I laid down the law this is what we're gonna have to follow no matter if it's my son daughter mother it doesn't matter so what he did he said tie her up so they were getting ready to whip her and what he did is he wrapped himself around her and took the whoopin for are we willing to do that for one another and then I'm it's not going to take away our responsibility of what what we've done wrong you know what I mean so can we not take the wrong instead of arguing a backbiting and and just tearing one and one another up like I said this this time is there's a time for play there's a time for work this is not a time for for playing around this is a time to unifying getting at one mind and one accord so if somebody says well well you did such-and-such that I didn't like it well you're you're right I'm sorry you know can't we suffer the wrong that's scriptural that's a Corinthians if you want to read it that you know why not suffer the wrong because you take away a lot of a lot of hardships by taking away contention you just ease the situation where you gonna get with argument and infighting I don't want to get too much into that right now but we say we say we want revival we want revival we want a refreshing of the Holy Ghost but we don't clean the house for it we just continue in the same way just like it Eli sons we just continue in the same way that we were going we don't want a clean house but when you do clean house when you finally some evangelist comes in and you get all scoured out and you know yeah everything's cleaned out you don't replace it with something of God that's that's where the problem says once you're cleaned out then fill it with something wholesome fill it with something godly or those Devils Devils that were cast out will come what 7 times greater for many times greater and you thought you had a battle before you just wait until you take on those other ones that are even stronger so once you're cleaned out fill it with something of the Lord amen fill it with godliness amen I just kind of think about that everybody knows that story uh I don't know if everybody I should have brought it out with me but I did about the that young man that I think it was the name was armor the armor and something else I can't remember the other name but he came and and they were having some some party or something and all the the women were dressing themselves up to try to get to marry this fellow I know I'm sorry I wish I could remember his name but I can't but all those all those women trying to impress trying to dress and impress and he wasn't interested in it but he found a wash woman what a cousin to all those or to the women there the the wash woman they didn't they didn't like her I guess her mother and father passed away and uh the aunt and uncle or whatever it was taking care of this woman while they through her kind of like a Cinderella ordeal they threw her that made her do all the washing all the Lord and all that well this is what that that man was interested in as somebody that was responsible in doing work somebody that was going to make a real good wife is what he was more that's what he was looking for not somebody that's going to be somebody that's high-maintenance looking all pretty and has to look pretty all the time and take care of me here take care of me there I want I want pedicures and manicures and all that take care of give me this give me that then don't want that you know some men want and they go after the beauty but after after that wears off after a while but you got to find somebody that that's going to be long-lasting somebody's going to stay there through thick and thin and I thank God for a godly wife that she stuck with me through sickness through pain through financial problems this was going to be 21 years that we've been married and I just thank God for a godly wife so I can understand what this man was looking for as I looking for a godly wife or a responsible wife somebody that's gonna be able to take care of herself and and not high-maintenance that he has to pamper her all the time somebody that has good character good wholesome character amen now if you now imagine so as everybody know that story so if you could imagine if this this woman came out and she's deliberating or she's debating within herself because he said from this day one year from now I'll be back to come and get you now through that whole year she she endured taunting it and uh just verbal abuse he's not coming for you he's not coming for you just just like the adversary tells you you're not God's child you're not saved he can't save you so just think of these cousins as a does a hammer and our hammer and a hammer on her trying to make her doubt so imagine debating within herself well is he going to come for me where is it he's got a compass should I get ready I'll make the dress just a case and and uh well the day comes what if the day came that she was still undecided to make that decision to go out and meet him well what about the next day she'll say well okay I decided I'll go ahead and marry him that wouldn't make any sense now wouldn't she'd be a day late and that she'd be disappointed because she wasn't ready at the time now she had the privilege privilege of knowing what day he was going to come of course this is natural so we don't know what day our Lord is coming so we must make that decision now it's not something that you can make later amen so make your decision to follow him now amen let's stand your feet huh that's about our heads most gracious Heavenly Father just appreciate your your word appreciate your spirits and again we thank you for all that you do for us we thank you for salvation that's so full and free the Lord we wasting way concern about worldly things and things that really don't matter the Lord I want to take today I want to take this time to make a check within myself and what really is priority and Lord I want to focus on that priority I know that you are the priority so I want to set my mind on you I want to focus on you I want to focus on on things that are righteous those things that are pure those things that are godly the lord help us to focus on those things help us to and camp ourselves surround ourselves with things of godly songs and godly preaching just reading into your word help us to surround ourselves with those things to tune out them and the the things of the world the temptations of the world the Lord be just nasty to me just help us at be with us continue to chip away the things that are unlike you lord I just thank you that you have given up on us just keep the owner work on us O Lord where our desire ought to be

presence but may we always keep you at our side o God and then keep you within us and not the cost so many disappointments were for you to be disappointed at us and lord help us to have that faith that rapturing faith that we will not be disappointed on that day thinking to ourselves our find of just been a little bit better with Lord maybe trying to do that better today and Lord put it in our minds and in our hearts and we would concentrate on those things Lord we ask your precious table I don't know what kedo going to start on wrong where the Lord's isn't here but Lord here with brother
