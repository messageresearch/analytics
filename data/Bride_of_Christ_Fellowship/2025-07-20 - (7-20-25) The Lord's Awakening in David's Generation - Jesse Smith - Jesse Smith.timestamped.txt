[0:00] look forward to that by the by the grace
[0:01] of God here. So, let's look at this
[0:03] thought here. The Lord awakenth in
[0:06] David's generation. I just was so
[0:08] inspired here. I felt like it was such a
[0:10] beautiful verse. You know, we know the
[0:12] Lord never slumbers nor sleeps. We're
[0:14] encouraged to remember that in the
[0:16] Bible. And you know, we know God allows
[0:18] us sometimes to go through testing
[0:20] times. We know God allowed Hezekiah to
[0:22] go through it where the Bible said God
[0:25] left Hezekiah for a season to try him.
[0:28] Now, we know the Bible says he'll never
[0:30] leave us nor forsake us. And that's
[0:32] true. He never will. But we see that
[0:34] there's times of testing where God will
[0:35] pull pull back his heavy anointing upon
[0:38] our lives and allow us to kind of
[0:41] maneuver life on our own a little bit
[0:44] without all of his help and influence.
[0:46] And in those moments, we kind of see as
[0:48] Hezekiah, we see what we're made out of.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, we see that we're flesh
[0:53] and dust. Hallelujah. Flesh and bone.
[0:56] And without God's constant powerful
[0:58] anointing, we'd all fall short of God's
[1:00] glory.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; We'd all make mistakes. We'd all do
[1:03] things that uh we wouldn't be proud of.
[1:05] We wouldn't want to tell our children
[1:06] about.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; We want to make mistakes.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; And so God did that uh in Hezekiah's
[1:11] life. He pulled off his anointing. Now,
[1:14] in the context here, it's speaking of in
[1:16] uh chapter 78, it's speaking of God
[1:19] dealing with Israel as they traveled uh
[1:22] through the wilderness out of Egypt all
[1:24] the way Egypt with Moses and then
[1:27] brought them into the promised land
[1:28] through Joshua. Hallelujah. And so,
[1:31] we're seeing this that uh God for some
[1:34] reason it was acting like he was
[1:36] sleeping.
[1:37] And in this context, we see it's because
[1:39] of the sins of the people.
[1:42] So very similar to what Hezekiah had
[1:44] happened there, God pulled himself back,
[1:46] right? And so Hezekiah w when he lost
[1:49] that great powerful anointing, he didn't
[1:52] wasn't living it daily in his life, we'd
[1:53] say he allowed the Babylon messengers to
[1:56] come in and check out all the vessels of
[1:58] the Lord. And that was a big mistake.
[2:00] Hallelujah. Because they'd make plans
[2:02] and they'd come back later to ransack
[2:04] the house of God. And Hezekiah repented
[2:06] of it. But see, it was uh Hezekiah's
[2:09] disobedience during that time. Uh and it
[2:11] seemed like God wasn't working. And
[2:13] that's exactly what happened here in the
[2:15] days of Israel here before that. Uh if
[2:18] we go back in Psalm 78:17, you'll see it
[2:21] just plainly here. I don't have time to
[2:23] read all this, but let's go back to
[2:25] verse 17. And they sinned yet more
[2:28] against him by provoking the most high
[2:30] in the wilderness. So God gives this
[2:33] picture here in his word of how the
[2:36] people kept sinning. You know they we
[2:37] know at least 10 times the Bible said
[2:39] they tempted the Lord in the wilderness.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Think about that after seeing so many
[2:44] miracles you know uh seeing the Red Sea
[2:47] part and then just days after that they
[2:50] would start doubting God.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; And church let's not get upset about
[2:53] them because we do the same thing.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; God will do a miracle. He'll provide
[2:56] there. He'll heal somebody. He'll do
[2:58] some great he'll make some great
[2:59] provision. And then a couple days later,
[3:01] we wonder, is God even in our lives?
[3:02] Right? Have we grieved the Lord? Have
[3:04] have we done something wrong? And so, we
[3:07] know our flesh is just like them, except
[3:09] we have more power. We have power to
[3:11] overcome sin, greater power, because we
[3:13] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[3:15] the soul. Hallelujah.
[3:17] Just kind of building a background here.
[3:18] I'm sure you're from, as you can tell
[3:19] here, by God's grace. Verse 18. And they
[3:22] tempted God in their heart by asking me
[3:24] for their lust. Yay, they spake against
[3:27] God. They said, "Can God furnish a table
[3:29] in the wilderness?" Now, what a
[3:31] question. If God could open the Red Sea,
[3:33] couldn't he furnish some food in the
[3:34] wilderness? If God made the way for them
[3:37] to get on the wilderness, couldn't God
[3:39] provide for them in the wilderness?
[3:41] &gt;&gt; In other words, if God brought you to a
[3:43] journey, is God going to uh fail you on
[3:45] your journey? Of course not.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; If God brought you out, he's going to
[3:49] bring you through. Hallelujah.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; There's no reason to doubt, but we know
[3:53] God allows us to go through testing
[3:54] times where we can build our faith.
[3:56] Hallelujah. And we can allow God to
[3:58] strengthen us and give us uh greater
[4:00] testimonies and and strengthen our
[4:02] faith. Hallelujah. Learn how to serve
[4:04] God in a pleasing manner. Hallelujah.
[4:06] And then you know if you go to down to
[4:08] verse 60 78 60
[4:15] it says and so that he forsook their
[4:18] tabernacle of Shiloh the tent which he
[4:20] placed among men and delivered his
[4:23] strength into captivity and his glory
[4:27] into the enemy's hands. Now I got the
[4:28] wrong verse. It's verse 58. Look at
[4:29] verse 58. For they provoked him to anger
[4:32] with their high places and moved him to
[4:34] jealousy with their graven images. So
[4:38] God is rehearsing them. They doubted me
[4:40] in the wilderness. They spake against me
[4:43] in the wilderness. Then when I brought
[4:44] them into the land, they were faithful
[4:45] for a while, but then they started up
[4:47] building idols in their lives.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:52] And so we see this uh uh repeated
[4:54] pattern of Israel. And we see a pattern
[4:57] in our lives of uh sinning and then
[4:59] repenting and getting our first love
[5:01] back. We see that pattern in our lives.
[5:03] Of course, our sins won't be as as deep
[5:05] as theirs were because we've got greater
[5:08] power. Hallelujah.
[5:09] The Holy Ghost is power to be a witness
[5:12] unto Christ. Hallelujah. That's what it
[5:14] is is. It's more power in the soul of
[5:16] the believer. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[5:19] But we all know, you know, there's times
[5:21] we let things become more important than
[5:23] serving God. Maybe it's children's
[5:25] extracurricular activities. Maybe for
[5:28] our brothers, it's work gets more
[5:29] important than God.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or maybe family
[5:33] relationships get more important than
[5:34] God. All kinds of things been can become
[5:37] between us and God. And God just testing
[5:39] us. God is proving us, right? He's
[5:41] proving our faith. He wants our faith to
[5:43] be more pure. Amen. For the pure in
[5:46] heart, they shall see God.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; God's molding us and shaping us. He's
[5:52] refining our faith. He's uh heating out
[5:55] and he's getting all the dross and the
[5:57] sin and unbelief out of our lives so
[5:59] that we can serve God with a pure heart.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; How many want to see God? Hallelujah.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; That should be our prayer today. God,
[6:06] give me a pure heart.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; I want to see you. I don't want to see
[6:09] the tribulation. Hallelujah. I don't
[6:11] want to see the white throne judgment as
[6:13] far as me getting judged. I want to be
[6:14] seated on the throne with Jesus in
[6:16] judgment. Hallelujah. And if he wants to
[6:18] raise up me and uh to be a witness on
[6:21] that day like he's going to do the Queen
[6:22] of the South, like he's going to do
[6:24] Jonah and all these individuals. Uh if
[6:26] he's going to do that, then praise God.
[6:28] I want to just have a testimony that he
[6:30] helped me through that he awakened me in
[6:33] my generation. Hallelujah.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because that's what we see
[6:37] in David's generation. It's as if God
[6:40] awakened out of his sleep and showed
[6:43] himself strong on David's behalf.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we see in verse 58,
[6:49] idolatry. So look at this church.
[6:51] Speaking against God, idolatry,
[6:55] forsaking the tabernacle. That was the
[6:57] ark of the covenant. Remember,
[7:00] forsaking. And the and the ark of the
[7:01] covenant represents the presence of God.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; It represents uh uh they would go to the
[7:07] the yurum thumbum. Of course, that was
[7:08] the breastplate. They would go there to
[7:10] find God's will. Uh the high priest
[7:12] would go to the ark of the covenant.
[7:14] Remember we saw it on Wednesday. looked
[7:15] to preach on the ark of the the thrones
[7:16] of God on Wednesday. They would go there
[7:18] and talk to God because God said, "I'll
[7:20] meet with you there.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; I won't meet you anywhere else. I'll
[7:24] meet you above the mercy seat where the
[7:26] blood's been shed and the blood's been
[7:27] sprinkled." Hallelujah. Where God's
[7:29] mercy has been expressed to man. And so,
[7:32] the ark of God represents God's presence
[7:35] where God gives you his perfect will.
[7:38] And so, Israel had drawn away from that.
[7:41] In other words, they started living
[7:42] where I don't really care so much. I
[7:44] really don't have to seek God about this
[7:45] decision. I'll just do what I feel like
[7:47] I want to do.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; Right. The decisions uh I'll say like
[7:52] this. The decisions of their lives, they
[7:53] weren't run by God and to see what God
[7:56] thinks about it.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; They just did what they wanted to do.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; And church, this I'll be probably
[8:02] emphasizing this more and more. In the
[8:04] biggest decisions of your life, really
[8:05] in every decision, but in the biggest
[8:07] decisions of your life, it's so
[8:09] important to have the word of the Lord.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to not make a decision
[8:15] unless you know you've got the lights of
[8:17] the urum shining. Hallelujah. If you got
[8:20] the lights of the Bible shining and oh,
[8:21] I know that's right. I see God's
[8:23] anointing on that decision. Hallelujah.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; And I'll say like this. If you're
[8:26] honest, you would have said, if it
[8:27] wasn't for God shining that, I would
[8:29] have made the wrong decision.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, you're thankful
[8:33] God showed up and gave you a vindication
[8:36] on the decision you were about to make.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[8:41] And so we see that the ark was captured.
[8:43] They lost the ability to find the
[8:46] perfect will of God for their lives.
[8:48] Hallelujah.
[8:51] And so this marked these were some of
[8:53] the marks upon this generation.
[8:57] And it really church it goes back to
[8:58] leadership really after Joshua died. We
