TRANSCRIPT
========================================
26 is our text. Now, tonight by God's grace, u for the kids Bible study, you of course we'll take questions and answers, but uh I like to go through the bride age. Sister Naomi and I were talking about that in the parking lot a couple months ago. I made a video on the bride age. You know, there's six quotes about uh the bride age from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. And so, I'd like to uh maybe teach on that tonight uh by God's grace. So, look forward to that uh by the grace of the Lord. And then I'll get back to angels maybe on uh Wednesday, Lord willing, by God's grace. Matthew 11:25 and 26. We're looking at God hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same. That's the full title from March uh of 1963. Brother Ram preached this series on the seven seals. Now last time we looked at the importance of uh teaching. Brother Ram said the greatest sermons he ever he ever had a part of was the sermons on the seven seals. He called it a great teaching. He told us not to add to it. Don't add our interpretation. Then he said if you got something different idea that doesn't pertain to salvation. He said that won't hurt a bit. You know he said uh a lot of your lot a lot of the questions came after u the rapture and so forth regarding the Jews and the tribulation and Daniel 70 weeks and so forth. So, we looked at that and saw the importance of teaching. It's so important uh to teach the word of God. Hallelujah. Just like think in your life, it's so important for you to learn your job or so important for you to learn how to be a good father or mother or a husband or a wife. Like we need constant teaching in order to be the people God's called us to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Jesus said, "Teach them." He said, "And I'll be with you all the way to the end of the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Teaching them to observe all their commands. Now friends, if we're honest, we've all got commands we can learn to obey. Hallelujah. Brother Jesse included. Hallelujah. All God's people included, but uh we're getting closer to the coming of the Lord. No man knows the day or the hour, but we'll keep pressing on by the grace of God. Hallelujah. Mark, I'm sorry. Matthew 11:25-26. I'll read 25, then we can all read 26. And at that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Hallelujah. So we can see how God sees us, right? God sees us as his young children. Let's read 26. One, two, three. Even so, father, for it seemed good in thy sight. I'm sorry. May God add his blessing to ring his word. You can be seated there. The word babe there in the Greek means an infant, a little child. Childish or unttaught, unskilled. Is that how you feel sometimes? Even as a Christian, I'm just I'm just like a child. I don't have the skills I'd like to have. I'm so immature. I wish I was more mature. But you're not alone because Jesus said all of his children are like that. Hallelujah. We're not the wise and the prudent. The wise means you're an expert. You're learned. You are a uh he said one you're a philosopher. You're a orator. You're a theologian. You've got the best plans and the best means for executing out all your plans. And God Jesus said God hides it from those wise people, right? Talking about worldly wisdom. Prudent means intelligent uh having understanding, wise and learn. So the worldly wise and the worldly prudent, God has hid it from them. Hallelujah. because they don't want it. They don't want the simplicity of God's word, but God reveals it to the babes such as would learn. Hallelujah. So, uh, let's look at this thought here. And I'm going to watch my time again. If we have two services, I think in the past I used to preach just an hour. So, we'll see that. And I prove that on Wednesday nights, I can preach just an hour, sometimes 45 minutes. Hallelujah. So, we can do it. All things are possible to them that believe in it. But uh remember we preach in this series through God I'm sorry recognizing your day in his message which brother Ram says our day is Leodysa it's the last church age we recognize God sent uh the seventh church age messenger the seventh angel brother Brandham is God's prophet to finish the mystery of God. Second was serpent seed where God originates this in Genesis 3:15 but now it's a spiritual seed. It started as a natural seed but now the two seeds are spiritual. Satan's seed and God's seed. Hallelujah. And the way you know God's seed is you take everything back to the word of God. If you're God's seed, you'll take everything back to the word &gt;&gt; because the word of God is a seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As Jesus said in the book of Luke, the word is a seed. Hallelujah. And then we looked at perfect faith, which is uh perfect faith is just revelation of the will of God. You know the will of God and you so you can have perfect faith in the will of God. Hallelujah. Then we looked at the breach. how Revelation 4 and 5 is the breach between the church ages, Revelations 1, 2, and 3, and the seven seals, Revelation 6, hallelujah, and then Revelation chapter 8. And so we see that the it is the lamb's redemption uh that happened, right? The lamb went and took the book and then the book was sent down in Revelation chapter 10 to a seventh angel and then we're to eat the book and prophesy it again. Now, uh that's what we see today, right? The Bible said the book is sweet in your mouth. So, it's wonderful to talk about and testify, but then it's bitter in your belly. It's hard to deal with the persecution. It's hard to even obey all of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you have this inner war. There's a constant war in your members, the Bible says. &gt;&gt; So, it's wonderful to sing about it. Great to sing about it. And it's so good to testify and praise God about it. But when it starts getting deeper part of you, it becomes bitter. There's challenges to obeying the word of God. Hallelujah. But God will give us grace. Amen. Every child, it's been like that for every single child of God. But we can overcome. We just got to keep eating the book. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We just got to deal with the digestion. Hallelujah. Amen. Then we looked at the message of grace. God's amazing grace for all of his children. Uh and then double grace at the end time. The Bible said the headstone comes with shouting, crying grace, grace unto it. So we see there's extra grace at the end time. And then we looked at the coming of the Lord, the the rapture mystery, the pre-tribulation rapture is scriptural and it's been more attacked recently. And I think it's because the foolish virgin or maybe even the makeelievers uh they feel bad they're going to be left behind, right? They they don't uh they're upset that Jesus is going to snatch away his bride and they they know in their conscious they know they're not ready for that. &gt;&gt; So they want to attack that. They want to get people to doubt that. And then that brings them into deception to not be ready to not watch and pray for the coming of the Lord because he comes like a thief in the night. No man knows the day or the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And then we looking at God hiding himself in simplicity for four services. We we've only got through the introduction, the first hour of the sermon by God's grace. But here we go. Um we'll get into the his main thoughts here in just a moment, but I'm going to read a couple paragraphs. Now after he reads his text he makes this uh and he he quotes Isaiah 35 and brother Ram says though a fool shall not heir therein. He says it's so simple and we know that God is so great till we expect it to be some great something and we miss the simple things we stumble over simplicity. That's how we miss God is by stumbling over simplicity. God is so simple until the scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles. So, Brother Ram says scholars in their ideas about God and the rapture are a million miles away. &gt;&gt; Right, church? That's why it's hard to have fellowship with denominational people sometimes if if they're so focused on their own thoughts and ideas. You can't have fellowship if our minds are a million miles away. We're thinking about the rapture. We're thinking about the Holy Ghost. We're thinking about Jesus coming. And they're thinking about trying to get the whole world to be Christians. Now, that's a nice thought, but that's a million miles away from the truth. The whole world is going to go into the Antichrist be system. That's the revival they're going to have. Now, we can pray for generational revivals like I have. Uh we could pray for like regional revivals, but there's going to be no national revival. I was even reading this week in the days of Hezekiah, even he even Hezekiah wrote all these letters out to Judah and northern Israel and most of the people laughed him to scorn. He wrote letters like he said, "Let's keep the feast. Let's have revival. Let's rededicate this house of God. Let's get our houses in order." And most of them laughed him to scorn. But the Bible said there was a small remnant that wanted to come back, get their lives cleaned out, wanted to destroy the altars. Hallelujah. wanted to take away the the grove places and the hive places where they worshiped and sacrificed children, all these things. But there was a small remnant. Thank God for that little remnant. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even, you know, even a great man like Hezekiah, people wouldn't humble themselves and follow him. So, we're nobody great. So, why do we think lots of people are going to follow us? Amen. It's going to be a small Jesus said it's a little flock. Hallelujah. And so, God, help us to be strong. Whether small, great. Some churches are greater in number. But God, help us to be faithful and realize that the reality of the gospel comes in simplicity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not something great and so far off with theology where he says they're a million miles away. Because in their intellects, they know that there's nothing like him so great, but in Revelation, he makes it so simple, they go plum over the top of it and miss it. Now, Brother Ram says this is right before he preaches the the seven seals. Remember he said, "Now study it all. And you people who are visiting here, when you go to your motel rooms, take these things and ponder over them. We don't have time to break it down as it should be broke down, but I want you to do it when you get to the hotel or wherever you're staying. Gather together and study over it." So, this is what I want you I mean, this is what this is my main theme over many, many years. The main thing, Brother Ram says, is get alone with God and study the sermons that you're hearing. So, brother Chris, I had a good question last week. You know, how many notes should I take? And I said, just take enough notes where you want to go and study that out further tomorrow, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because that's what brother said. Take what you're hearing today, go study in your hotel rooms, he said, and God will reveal something to you. &gt;&gt; So, when you see me take notes when Simon's here or Brother Diggs or whoever, that's what I'm doing. I I'm not taking notes on everything, but I if I feel if I feel something like that's a thought, oo, that's something I I need to study that out, I'll write it down and then I'll look it over the next day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Bam encourages that. Don't let these sermons just go in one ear and out the other. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If God is in me, if God's in you, then and God's in every pastor, church, if God's in every pastor, then God's giving them thoughts for the the the people of God. And we're supposed to benefit from those thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh like remember Ephesians 4 said it's for the equipping of the saints. So God sent brother Simon to equip you. And then Austin and Malachi were talking about how that helped them a couple weeks ago. Remember that it that's equipping you so you can be a better Christian. So brother Chris, that's my uh advice. Amen. My godly advice. Do like brother Brandham. Go write down what's most important and go study it in your room tonight. Hallelujah. Or tomorrow morning by God's grace. Study that out. Let that impact you. Take something from the scripture that God wants you to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's what brother Brandham said. He said, "Ponder over that." So church, when was the last time, so let me just ask humbly. When was the last last time you pondered over something from a service? Hallelujah. That's what we should do. We should ponder over what's been said, take it back and and and look at the word of God and say, "How does this apply to me? How can this relate to my life? What was God wanting me to see?" &gt;&gt; And then in that, you'll see something greater that God wants you to have. Hallelujah. That's supposed to be like the first the first step. And then you in your own studies, you go home and study that out and God will show you something. In other words, the idea, remember we preached on it last year. The idea is to meditate on the things of God. Actually, it might have been this year. I looked at all the meditation verses from David in the spring. That's what he wants us to do. Now, there's so many things that will take our attention, but God wants us to meditate on him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ram says, "Go study on this." Now, church, I've done this with the seven seals because I preached over 125, last time I counted sermons. Now, this is over the last 15 years. I think I started in 2010 preaching on this the re the book of Revelation. But for every one of those services, I'd sit in my study, think it over, pray about it. What does this mean here? Well, how can that fit in here? And you just ponder over it, and God will reveal more of it by his grace. And then we won't go off into some false idea or some false doctrine or something like that. We won't be led astray, but we'll be led further into the word of God. We don't want to miss him a million miles, &gt;&gt; right? And I don't know if you saw it. My wife shared it with me. The White House a couple weeks ago put out let's pray or let's have peace and safety. Now, does that sound familiar to anybody? &gt;&gt; That's 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. When the world is saying peace and safety, then come sudden destruction. That's speaking of the tribulation period. But look that that that phrase is already in use by the white house which is controlled by the mystery Babylon, right? The mother harlot, right? Because this is the beast out of the land. She's the beast out of the sea, right? But then that beast changes form or the same evil spirits in the beast out of the land. So they're already getting the wording of it. Now church, what we want is peace and safety in the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Yes, we appreciate natural peace and none of us want to go through trials and suffering or persecution, but our greatest desire should be that the will of God be done in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there are, just so you know, the beast is already picking up that language, peace and safety. I tried to find the actual post this morning. I couldn't find it on the drive to church, but uh maybe my wife if maybe I just got to go look in my text with my wife. I'll try to find that by God's grace just so you can see it. He says, 'Now study that.' He says, 'Y yeah, go to your hotel rooms, study it out. So think about that, church. The Catholic scholars and the Protestant scholars miss it by a million miles because who are they looking to unite with? The current Pope Leo. That that's who they think is going to help unite, &gt;&gt; you know, and God bless Charlie Kirk, but Charlie Kirk put the post out, you know, and I love Charlie Kirk, but he even him in his his understanding, he said, "We have a new pope to enter in a new era of Christianity." Now, I'm adding my own idea, but God rest his soul. I believe he's saved. But that was his thought. That that's as far as he'd been taught. And church, think about that. That's off a million miles, right? Think about that. And and think and think now, think about all the scholars and all these things. Think about all the denominations. They're off a million miles and church. And and look and think they're think spiritually now. They're driving still further away from the truth. They're further getting away while God has brought you to the truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, you're not millions of miles away. You're right here in the presence of God. Amen. With the Bible, with thus sayith the Lord. Hallelujah. With a modern day prophet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With tapes, sermons recorded pointing us to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Like, in other words, we're not looking for a woman president to rise up. We're looking for Christ to rise up in the bride. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're looking for the bride to rise up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They got the different ideas, church. &gt;&gt; But see, this ought to make us so thankful. And I'm thankful again, brother says, I'm thankful for every Catholic or Protestant who's saved. If any man or woman is trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ, they will be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Few there be that find the narrow road." &gt;&gt; Thank God, church, we're not a million miles away, but we're right in the middle of the road. I'm sorry. Not perfectly, but we're close to the middle of the road. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Ram said they miss him by the way that he reveals himself. Now, church, how's he going to reveal himself in the word? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he might use a dream, brother Chris, brother Jose, he might use something, a dream or vision, but that vision and dream will always line up with the word of God. &gt;&gt; When I was raised in Pentecostal church, how did he reveal himself to me when I went to the Bible studies? Because the truths I was taught are the same from Genesis to Revelation. He's one God. The water baptism, the serpent seed. That's what first struck my eyes. Oh, I can see that from Genesis. There's two seeds from Genesis to Revelation. That's the first thing that opened my How did he reveal himself? Through the word of God. &gt;&gt; Just a simple way. Like you can sit in a Bible study. You don't have to sit in a church uh with stained glass windows to hear God. You can meet God in a simple room like this with just painted walls and a couple pictures up on the wall. You can meet God in a simple place with this. Yes, that's how we always meet God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is in simplicity. Brother Ram says it over and over again in this series. He says, "Look at Jesus. Where did they have to receive him? In a stable. &gt;&gt; He was a baby in a stable." That's how simple God was. Amen. &gt;&gt; He put his own son. He put his own uh image, his own body, his own temple that he created. It wasn't revealed in some great mystical church or some great scene. It was humility in a baby. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And look how many people missed it. Almost everybody missed it. Amen. If it wasn't for the angels, the shepherds would have missed it. They all would have missed it. But God let the elect hear the word of God and have the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The same is true today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll find him in a little humble church in Akran, Ohio. Hallelujah. Or Napoleon, Ohio. Or Ankenne, Iowa. Hallelujah. Wherever it may be. Hallelujah. Up in Sheffield, Ohio. You'll find God hiding himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; He's so great, yet he hides himself to make himself known to the least. So remember church, always remember, we're not the greatest, we're the least. That's what Brother Ram says. He makes himself known to the least. But some people call themselves the greatest. We can see they're breaking this quote. He said, "Don't try to get the great because he goes over the top of it, but listen to the simplicity of God and then you find God right here in the simple way." Hallelujah. So God reveals himself to the least and he reveals himself to a simple group of people. &gt;&gt; In other words, simple like, "Brother Jesse, just show me that in the Bible. I'll believe it." That's simple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't have to give you a miracle. I don't have to prove this or do that. You don't have to do that. God revealed himself in the simplicity of the word of God. Hallelujah. Now, I want to get to this next thought. There's two more uh paragraphs here and then we'll get to where he starts preaching finally after about I think it's about 58 minutes or hour and some minutes here. The next thing brother said, "High polished worldly wisdom educated always misses him." He says, "And I know there's school teachers, two or three that I know sitting in here. And I'm not here to contradict school and education and try to support illiteratess. I'm not here for that." But what it is, the people have placed so much on that until even the seminaries, they're missing the very thing that God has put before them. &gt;&gt; So, Brother B is clear. You know, education is not bad. Education is only bad when they try to take you away from the word of God. Hallelujah. That's the only time it's bad. Like I said, I'm glad the doctors that saved my wife and Tulsi were educated. &gt;&gt; I will forever be grateful for their education. But when you go to college and they try to instill woke uh indoctrination and you try to tell you lies that there's no God and evolution, that's from hell. &gt;&gt; That's the education that's from the devil. &gt;&gt; I don't know how much you get in middle school, Anna. I don't know how much you y'all get in high school, but you should be able to tell if you got the spirit of God, you'll be able to sense that right away. That's wrong. They're trying to give me some lie. I'm only going to take the truth. Amen. I won't be educated in lies. I'm going to be educated by the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like Jesus said, "Come and learn of me." Learning is not a bad word. Learning is a good word because that's what happens when you get revelation. You learn the understanding of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, see, there's nothing wrong with education because he says there's two or three school teachers in Brandham Tabernacle. Well, we got one here today. Hallelujah. He's the one preaching. He said that that's why I'm not against the brethren who are the denominations. I'm against the system of denominations because it tries to magnify itself and educate its ministers to such a place till they don't have to have the proper until if they don't have the proper schooling education, they're ousted. They have to stand the psychiatrist test and so forth. I never think that was God's will to test a minister by psychiatry, but to test him by the word of God. &gt;&gt; So listen, church, that that's that's how we know who's called to preach. It's not how much education they have, it's how much revelation they have. &gt;&gt; Even like I've said, you know, all of our brothers in here, some of you may be called to preach in the future. The way we know you'd be called is because you stay with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because of how nice you can talk, how loud you can get, how emotional you can get. That has nothing to do with it. It has to do with your revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't add to the word of God. You don't take away. If there's an error you don't understand, you just say, "This is my opinion. This is why I think this. I could be wrong." You just humble yourself. Because the Bible said teachers offend in all many things. We looked at that, remember last time in James, &gt;&gt; teachers will be judged more harshly. I'm going to be judged more harshly. So, I want to be open to correction. You and I want to be open to correction. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says it tries to magnify itself. He says, "Test a preacher by the word." See? See, it's just the word would be God's way of testing his men that he sent out to have the word preach the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm thankful uh friends by God's grace. And remember, church, brother Brandham didn't bring Sister Ma, Joseph, Rebecca, and Becky, as far as I know. Sarah, I'm sorry, Sarah. Brother Ram left them in Arizona to get their what? Education. That's how much brother Random appreciated his children being educated. And and and children, we want you to be educated so you can read your Bible. &gt;&gt; And then you if you have children, you can teach your children the Bible. &gt;&gt; And then if you have a job where you have to read like I do, you can read. I got to read and follow these directions, right? At my job, things I got to teach. So at your job, you can do a good example as a Christian. You can read, you can write, you can uh you can have logic, right? You can understand right and wrong. You can defend what you believe. Amen. Hallelujah. That's the benefit of education. And brother Ram left his wife and children and they missed out on the revelation of the seven seals physically because brother so highly valued education. All right. Everybody can see that. Is that okay? By God's grace. Is that fine? I got 40 minutes left. Hallelujah. Now, now let's finally get brother takes this text. He finally starts preaching. Now, is anybody listening to this lately? Raise your hand if you listen to God hiding himself. Nobody's listening to it lately. Okay. All right. That's that's fine. Hopefully, you're in the church age book or something by God's grace. Stay in stay in the message somehow. The revelations God gave to brother Brandon. But the first character he brings up in God hiding himself in simplicity. Any guesses? He's going to start in Genesis, Noah. That surprise anybody? He says Noah lived in such a educated time. He said the pyramids proved it. &gt;&gt; The pyramids survived the flood. He said uh the embalming of ancient Egypt and their mummies. He said those are the two examples he gave. He said that technology showed they're further advanced than we were in some ways. I don't know in all the ways, but they were further advanced in numerous ways than we are. And brother Ram said there was hardly any illiteracy among them at all. Think about that. They're so smart to make the pyramids and embalm uh the bodies and make them last till they're still in pretty good shape today. He said there wasn't hardly any illiteracy at all. But yeah, church, what do we find? Only eight were actually saved. &gt;&gt; See, church, that's why you can never trust your wisdom to know that you're saved. You can only trust in the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Think of that. The Bible said the whole earth was filled, right? And God looked down from heaven and the Bible said it grieved him to actually see it. He knew what happened, but it grieved him and he said, "I regret that I even made man." It was such an awful time. And remember, that's to be repeated in this day. &gt;&gt; As it was the days of Noah, so shall be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man. So, how many people really are saved out there? Very few. Thank God you're one of the few. Hallelujah, church. Thank God you're not a million miles away from the truth, but you're right here near it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has driven you right to the truth. Hallelujah. And you can find it. That's what I see in my life. God led me here. Right. Just like Jesus, he went looking. He left the 99. He went looking and he brought me in. The Bible said he lifted me up, put me on his shoulders, and he carried me and brought me to the sheepfold. And the church said he did the same for you. He went looking for you until he found you. And then he carried you on his strongest part of his body. He brought you to him. It's God's strength that brought you to the truth. It's God looking for you that brought you here today. You're here because of the love of the good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. I did not go looking for him. He came looking for me. Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "God, searching through that great economy at their day in their systems could not find the right type of man until he found an illiterate maybe farmer by the name of Noah." So he bypassed all those wise engineers. My we can make this pyramid, that one, the Sphinx. We can embalm bodies like this. They had their laboratories, their modern day, I'm sorry, their modern day laboratories for their day. And brother Ram said, "God looked in there, couldn't find anybody to save. He finds Noah out here, and we'd say an illiterate farmer. He's just a farmer. He's just average. &gt;&gt; He's less than average. &gt;&gt; He ain't even mediocre. &gt;&gt; Does farming in any wise compare to pyramids as far as greatness?" Uh, what do you do? Uh, I just I just farm. I plant seeds and I harvest. Oh, mean you don't build pyramids. You don't build uh structures that are hundreds of feet tall and uh have these huge blocks of many many tons that take superpowers to move. You don't do that. No, I just take care of sheep. I just take care of animals. That's all I do. And I I plant things. Which one did God choose? The humble one. &gt;&gt; That's why we know, church, he's chosen you. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why we know we have confidence. He could have chose us because we're nothing. We're the least. He didn't go to the greatest. He went to the least. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. Amen. I thought this might encourage somebody today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it is. Hallelujah. He said he found a illiterate farmer, maybe Noah, a sheep herder, and gave him a message to preach to the people that was so simple to their scholarships of that day until the people stumbled over the simplicity of the message. You mean God's going to destroy all these cities we built? God's going to destroy all these instruments and God's going to kill all these animals and all we got to do is get into the ark to be saved. That's it. That's your message for today. And Noah's like, "Yes, that's thus sayaith the Lord. I mean, surely God's a loving God, Noah. Look at all these people. Look at all these children. Look at all these mothers. Look at all these beautiful animals. I mean, surely God's not going to do that. I mean surely we can just have our own civilization and we can just keep going on serving God the way we are. No, God had one way that was thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; A simple humble way. And church, there's one way out of the tribulation and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. There's only one way out of it. You must be born again. Jesus says, &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah. Thank God for the ark of Jesus Christ." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the way out. Hallelujah. He's our ark today. Praise God. He said the people stumbled over the simplicity. You mean we've got to all anyone who wants to be saved has to join your church? Now, we'll never get to that point, church, because we know it's a universal rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm never going to get to that and isolate myself or be elitist or anything like that. We know we're nothing. But if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we've got the token for the rapture. But in Noah's day, it was get in my church or you're not going to make it. For us, it's get in my savior, Jesus, or you're not going to make it. &gt;&gt; It's not about the church. It's not about a physical church. It's about the spiritual church. It's the body of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. It's the bride. It's those who are born again. It's those who are in Christ and Christ is in them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ram said, "Yet in the message yet his message in the face of science was radical." Isn't that the Isn't that the same as us today? We're going to go in a rapture. God's going to change people's molecules around the world, some daytime, some nighttime, in the moment, in the twink of an eye, and they're just going to vanish away. Brother Jesse, yes. Our message is radical &gt;&gt; because that's what First Thessalonians 4 says. Hallelujah. That's what First Corinthians 15 says. It's a shout, voice, trump. Hallelujah. The dead in Christ will rise first. They'll meet Christ in the air. And then we which are alive and remain shall be snatched up and meet the Lord in the air at the last trump. &gt;&gt; It's radical. It just doesn't sound like like it's possible. But yet it's the truth. He said, "How could there be rain in the skies in those day when there was no rain up there? It just it didn't make logical sense. How could people be raptured all around the world? Doesn't make any sense. And meet up in the sky. Which sky? Eastern? Western? Which sky? Northern? It just doesn't make sense to them. It don't have to make sense to us. We just believe it &gt;&gt; because the Bible says it. Hallelujah. It's a simple message of building an ark, constructing of something to get into that there's no water to float it. Okay? There's no water. There's no rain uh in the sky. There's there's no water. This doesn't make any sense. See, but he became a fanatic and become what we would call he said, excuse the expression, an oddball. See, the message will always make you an oddball to the smart, intelligent people. &gt;&gt; You're just going to be different, church. Just get used to being different, especially our sisters. And may God give them an extra great reward. I pray. Brother Ram has one quote about it. He doesn't doesn't give a scripture. He said because the women have to uh look so different from the women of today, he said they'll get a greater reward. I hope that's true. I'm still looking for that scripture, brother Mercy. Hallelujah. Because then I can encourage my wife and my girls and all the all the girls here. Uh I hope they get a greater reward if they sacrifice more. God knows hallelujah. God knows how to do it. &gt;&gt; It just looks so radical. And we and the the believer of every day becomes a fanatic to everybody else. An oddball. And nearly all God's people are oddballs. He says, "I'm glad to be one of them. They're different from the modern trend of civilization. So, they become odd and strange. Let me just say this. Brother Rod loves how uh we dress up here at our church. You ever see Rod? He's got that suit and tie on. He's from the old the old uh the old Pentecost way. &gt;&gt; He's like, "You should wear he's he's like, "Brother Jesse, I love how your people wear their best clothes. You should wear your best clothes to church." Praise God. &gt;&gt; It it's so different, right? Because now they go in jeans with holes in them and and uh shorts and hair all over the place. They don't even bother to comb their hair. Shirt just t-shirts, regular t-shirts and and flipflops on if they wear that. It just it's a total disgrace, right? It's not it's not the attitude like I'm coming where judgment is going to start. Judgment begins at the house of God. &gt;&gt; Think about church. How would you dress if the judge you're going to see a judge and he had your life in his hands? How would you dress? I would get I'd get everything in order to make it look like I cared, like I wanted mercy from that judge. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But see, that's just one example of how we'll always be the oddballs. We take church as, yes, it's a place of grace. It's also a place to be corrected. We're getting judgments from the judge, the Lord Jesus Christ, not me. I just preach the judgments he shows me, but I can't preach all of it. So, God's got to send four other gifts in here. Hallelujah. Now, we need some more apostles. I'll tell you that. Amen. And we need some minor prophets. We definitely need that. Hallelujah. But, uh, the Bible said there's there's different kinds of gifts, right? And there's different measures of gifts. Some people are greater, some some less. Hallelujah. So see all God's people, he said they're they're a peculiar people, he said, a spiritual priesthood, a royal nation offering spiritual sacrifices to God, the fruit of their lips, giving praise to a name. Uh if you got your Bibles, pick them up. First Peter 2:9, pardon me. So let's read these verses. Brother's laying a foundation with Noah. This is what we are. This is what we're called to do. Give God praise. Worship him. Pray. Center your life around the word of God. Don't let anything take you away from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And your office as a king and priest unto God. Don't let anything ever take you away from that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like over the years, like I said, over the years, you know, we we see when people fall away, the first thing they do is they stop coming Sunday night. Then they stop coming Wednesday night and then they're hardly there on Sunday. &gt;&gt; See, they've left. They've forgotten that God called us to be a royal priesthood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But be ye a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should shoe forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. All right. Now, this is making me think of a scripture here. So, just keep that up there, hun just a second. See, you're a chosen generation. So, God chose you to be a priesthood. And priests offer praise. Priests offer sacrifices. Yes, it's a sacrifice to come to House of God. Yes, it's a sacrifice to get cleaned up and dressed up. But that's what God called you to do. God called you to come here to intercede for the lost &gt;&gt; and also keep yourself lined up with the word of God. Amen. Hallelujah. To keep myself, all of us, we're called, that's our duty. &gt;&gt; That's our our purpose in life is to be a spiritual priesthood. If nobody else will come to the house of God, if nobody else will worship and take this serely, I will because I'm part of this priesthood. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If nobody else will lay at the altar, if nobody else will fast and pray or give arms, if nobody else will do that, I'll do it because I'm part of the royal priesthood of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we should show forth the praises of him. See, praising Jesus all the time who has called you. I'm thankful he called me out of darkness. I'm thankful to be a child of the light. I'm thankful to come to God's house. I'm thankful to praise his name. I'm thankful I can read the Bible. I'm thankful I can give God glory. I'm thankful that I'm walking in the light. &gt;&gt; I'm not walking in darkness. I'm not a child of darkness. I'm a child of light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a privilege of our lives to come to church and worship. Now, pull up um second 2 Chronicles 38. I just saw this yesterday and I highlighted these three steps. God just wants us to do three steps. Now, remember, I made a video and I preach on this about about King Ahaz abandoned the house of God. In other words, he shut the doors. Nobody went into worship. And I liken that unto Brennham Tabernacle, right? That was King Ahaz. I preached on abandoned. It was on a Wednesday night a couple months ago. It's got over 4,000 views, which kind of surprised me. Oh, yeah. And one preacher in South Africa even showed it to his entire church. He show and I I got the video of it if you want to see it. And everybody's clapping. and they're not clapping for me, but they're clapping because they're actually in church and they're not sitting home playing tapes. They weren't clapping for me. I'm nobody. But I was It was like a church of maybe four or 500. I was like, "Praise God, God knows how to get his word there, right? &gt;&gt; Think about it. Of all the preachers, God used a little preacher in Akran, Ohio to encourage them to keep coming to church. &gt;&gt; And I don't even go to their church. I don't even know them." So, a brother sent me that link. I was like, "Glory." Uh 2 Chronicles uh 30:8, hun, there's a three-step process. 2 Chronicles 30:8. There's a three-step process in here. So, remember Hezekiah, remember the first thing he did was open the doors of the house of God. And then they took, I think it was 16 days to clean out everything in the house of God. They destroyed all the temples. They took all the unholy things out. And once they got it set up, he sent all these letters out, but only a little group came in to worship God. That was the revival group. &gt;&gt; You're the revival group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what revival means? Made alive. How many are alive today in Christ Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not dead to Christ. I'm not dead uh to the Christ and loving the things of the world. No, I'm in love with Jesus. Amen. Am I fighting the good fight every day? Yes, I am. I'm fighting against the greatest battle ever fought in my mind. But I love Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the light. &gt;&gt; Now, look at these three three steps that Hezekiah or the Bible records. Now, be not stiff necked. In other words, sit at home as your fathers were, but yield. So, let's all say yield. Ready? Yield. &gt;&gt; Yield yourselves unto the Lord. And let's all say enter. Ready? Enter. So, first you got to yield yourself and say, God, I'm taking your way, not my way. &gt;&gt; And then he says, enter into his sanctuary. So, first you got to yield, God. I'll do what you want. I'll enter in the sanctuary which he has sanctified forever. And here's the last one. Let's say it together. Ready? Serve. &gt;&gt; Yield. enter the church and then serve God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord your God that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you. Now, you've read your Bible enough. We don't need to go to the book of Acts, but you know in the book of Acts, they had to gather more as they saw that day approaching, right? After they were baptized, Acts chapter 2, it said they stayed with the apostles, their fellowship, their doctrine, the breaking of bread, communion, like we had last week. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "That's that's what we're doing. That's why we're trying to be like the book of Acts." But man said that the the true church will always try and strive to be like that original book of acts church. &gt;&gt; But this was a prefigure this was a prophecy or a type of what we do as well. We enter into the house or sorry we yield to God. We enter in and then say God how can I serve you? Hallelujah. And that's part of the mystery of God. The mystery of God's will for your life. How do you serve God? Well, we know attend church, pray, fast, give alms, pay tithe. We know all those things. But even outside of that, you need to find your service for the ministry of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe it's prayer. Maybe it's fasting, right? More fasting. Maybe it's uh the gift of faith, the gift of wisdom, the gift of miracles, right? &gt;&gt; Uh the gift of tongues, the gift of interpretation. Maybe it's one of those. Gift of discernment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Gift of knowledge. And you got to find where are you called to serve. &gt;&gt; Yield, enter, serve. Brother Chris, &gt;&gt; it seems uh sometimes, brother, they catch it when they're young and sometimes they catch it when they're older. It kind of all depends God's time or season. Like for example, Moses when he was born, there was he was a goodly child. There was some anointing on him kind of like brother Bram there was a there was a pillar of fire when he was born but he didn't actually get into that until he was 80 years old and then Abraham was the father of our faith and he did not get into his calling until he was 75 right but then you got children like Solomon there was blessing on his life he was beloved of the Lord even from a child right uh I just saw Josiah started king when he was eight years old eight years old and yeah and but he was called for that so in other words. God has the mystery of your life and he'll manifest your gifts at just the right time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God had to manifest my gifts when I was about what 21. They saw me doing Bible studies and Tim is like, "You need to preach, Jesse. You need to preach." I said, "Wait till I'm done with football. I can't do both at the same time." And then I finally yielded and the it's been history since, you know. And then, like I said, those two people always knew I'd be a preacher before I even knew I was going to be a before I even thought about preaching really. So, uh, the gifts and callings of God are without repentance. That's what Romans 11 says. You remember that one? Okay, let's read that. Romans chapter 11. Uh, the gifts and callings of God are without repentance and they'll activate in the right time and season of your life. Now, let me just use some examples in the church. I hope this is okay. Um, Romans 11. Now, yeah, it's verse uh let's start at 28 so brother Chris can get a little background. This is talking about how Israel is yet to be saved as a nation. But remember, there's only going to be 144,000 of them saved. Verse 28, as concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes. So there's there's elected there's elected Jews, and that glorifies Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, right? Because they stayed faithful. They recognized the Messiah, right? That's what all they were Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, that's what all they're waiting for was the Messiah. Okay. Um verse 29, for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. In other words, there's gifts and there's and God there's gifts in Israel's life, right? Uh there's calling on their life and it's without repentance. Other words, God's not going to repent of it. And also another way you can take that is even with even if they don't repent those gifts are still in their lives and they're going to manifest at the right time. Like Judas is scar he was given all those gifts and the Bible said he was just as equal as all the other saints all all the other apostles because when they when he betrayed him Jesus said one of you is going to betray me. Everybody looked around and they looked is it me? Is it me? They didn't look at Judas and say I always knew it was that devil Judas right because he had his gifts were just as powerful as everybody else. Well, I don't know about that. That's a good question, buddy. I'll think about that one. I've never thought about that. Uh, he definitely had the gift of healing because he cast out devils. So, when when he was before he was possessed of Satan, he was filled in his mind with the spirit of God and he cast out devils. Yeah, good question, brother. Great question. Let's give him two claps. I get ready uh for our ninth service here. And I'm only preaching 40 minutes so far. Hallelujah. So, there you go, brother. Uh the gifts and calling of God, great question. Are without repentance. So there's there's gifts in every life here. Now, I always use Malachi and and Victoria and Lydia. If you're a musician, your gift is healing because David when he played it cast off evil spirits, &gt;&gt; right? It's healing. You heal through music. &gt;&gt; Okay? But that might not be all in Malachi's life or Lydia's life. Okay? Uh we're seeing uh discernment in our sister Lena's life. I believe brother Jose has a gift of either healing or faith or miracles because of those prayer cloths he sent out over the years. People have got testimonies that they've been healed. Um, Sister Karen Sanders said Zur has a special gift on her life. Now, I don't know what that is, but perhaps the Lord will show it to us. By God's grace, it'll manifest. One time I wrote it down. One time, uh, Zur walked by Sister Karen Sanders and she said, "There is something on that sister, some anointing of God." Hallelujah. So, we want to we want to be mindful of that. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, in Sister Nomi's life, we're seeing the gift of faith. Hallelujah. We're seeing that rise up by God's grace. In other words, when when God anoints her to pray, God comes down and answers it and responds. That's a gift of faith. I know it's going to happen. God showed it to me. Now, in my life, of course, I see teaching over the years. I've seen healings. I've seen a few miracles. Uh discernment to judge situations. I've seen that a little bit in my life. And I'm not saying I got all of them. I'm just saying like each one of us, you know, if we're yielded to the spirit of God, we'll see more of them in our life as we're yielded. &gt;&gt; We'll see. And remember, Brother Ram said God can pick you up. He can use you for tongues this day. He said he might never use you for tongues again. He might use your interpretation. He might use you for miracles. It's whatever God wants to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, it's the mystery of God's will for your life. And like I said, my wife, I've seen so much wisdom out of my wife's uh mind prayer for me. She cast out the demon when the demon was choking me. Um, she called on Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. And instantly that choking left. So, I've seen the power of God in my wife's life as well. Now, all that I don't know how I got to there by God's grace, but Hebrews 13:15, let's pull that up there. Hallelujah. This is the scripture Brother uses about how Noah was in simplicity. His message was simplicity. He was the oddball. He was the one. He was the one to be a worshipper. Remember how many know the Bible said, "What was he a preacher of?" Righteousness. Righteousness. Do what's right. That's what he preached. Was he a tape player of righteousness or a preacher? &gt;&gt; I thought I should throw that in there. Hebrews 13:15. By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually. That is the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name. So church, every day try to find a time where you can give God thanks &gt;&gt; because that's your priesthood. That's what God has called you to do. Think about that, church. Think about this. Everybody else is going to complain. You've got to give God thanks. &gt;&gt; Everybody else won't give. They'll praise the Cleveland Browns. They'll praise uh they'll praise beer and alcohol. and they'll praise the movie Hollywood stars, but you and I are to praise Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's our priesthood. Hallelujah. That's our calling. We're a royal priesthood. Hallelujah. We've got divine nature. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our lineage is in heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our father is in heaven. Hallelujah. He's a king of heaven and earth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's our priesthood. Praise God. That's what Noah was. Brother Ram said, "We are so smart and intellectual in our churches till we can build a million-doll building or $10 million building, but yet trying to build one better than the Methodists or the Baptists build one better than the Presbyterian." And the Pentecostals got in the rat race. So, we don't want to join the rat race. We just want to hang out with the doves. Hallelujah. Or we just want to hang out with the lambs. Amen. Let's not join the rat race. Now, we never could because we don't have enough money. So, thank God for keeping us from that the rat race. But, but the he said, "But the thing of this is we're so smart and so set on our ways until we fail to humble ourselves to realize that God's in the little mission on the corner." Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, if you just drove through Akran day, how many churches did you pass? I mean, big mega churches, right? Huge mega churches. We drove by Faith Family last night. The whole parking lot. I mean, the whole parking lot's full. Hundreds of cars. And if if some if you ask somebody, "Where's God today?" Do you think anybody would point to our church? But yet, where is God today? God's right here. &gt;&gt; God's here because he's provening it by his word. &gt;&gt; Now, we appreciate the truth that they have at Faith Family. I don't know what they preach lately, but but from what I've seen, you know, women preachers and and crossdressing and cutting hair and no modesty standards, right? And speaking in tongues might used to be the evidence because they used to speak in tongues on their live stream, then they took it off. So, I don't know what I think they're moving away from the Pentecostal to more like a general gospel, like a Joel Olstein type of thing. Now, I don't know. That's just my guess. I could be wrong. I'm open to correction. But see, we we've got to keep with the uh we got to keep with the full word of God. If there's a Bible command in here, then we're the priesthood. We're supposed to make sure you know it and you do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the priests were to do. Tell the people the word of God so you can live it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're the royal priesthood. We're not a million miles away from the truth. We know the truth. The truth has set us free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got 11 minutes. Can you bear with me? 11 more minutes. Amen, sir. &gt;&gt; You're all so kind. Hallelujah. So patient. Think of this. Years and years. I've been coming up. I'll be pastor 20 years in June. We're coming up on that. Unbelievable. And it's just it's just flown by. It's just like it's like I never get enough time to preach. I never get to where I want to go. It just seems like I just love the word of God more. I want to know more of God's word. It's a joy to preach the gospel to you because it transforms your lives. Hallelujah. Like it transformed mine. Amen. He said they failed to see God in the little mission on the corner. And again, we have three witnesses last few months, Adam, Brendan, Rod, all come in here and say, "It's different in here. The worship is different. The presence of God is here." In fact, Adam told me on the phone this week, he said, "God lives at your church." And I thought, well, only by his grace until we would grieve him. God, help us not to grieve your Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Remember, he said he felt the presence of God as soon as he got into Akran. And he kept he said uh when he left, he tried to buy uh chewing tobacco. He couldn't buy it. He got down the road, I'll buy it on the turnpike. He couldn't buy it there. He got home, he couldn't buy it there. And now he's free from chewing tobacco after almost 30 years, about 28 years. He said, "God took it from me at your church." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, thank you, church. Thank you for being a place where God can come down and take out people's addictions. Praise God. &gt;&gt; It didn't it didn't leave any other place. It left here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To show us to show us who's among us. It's the Lord Jesus Christ among us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What did I want to show? Okay, I think I'll go one more. If I got 10 minutes, I'll go one more here. Uh and then tonight we'll look at the bride age. U yeah, let me I want to I want to pull up a visual. Just bear with me just a second. This kind of came to me. Okay, now uh let's try to get done with I think I get done with Moses here. Let me look for this here. Look for this. Uh I wanted to show that visual. I updated the visual on the middle of the road. kind of wanted to show that again. Let me see. I think that might be okay. Now, with Moses, yeah, he just has a short section on Moses. Now, think about this church. Brother Brham mentions eight people in this sermon. I'm I just showed you Noah. He goes to Moses next. He ends with himself about God hiding in simplicity. But I could preach a sermon on every one of these, just a separate sermon on every character, could I not? And just show God was so simple. Look how God was simple in Noah. It wasn't some great big thing where it was, you know, more magnificent than the ancient Egypt. It was God hiding himself in simplicity. You had to be a part of, we'd say, uh, we a renegade oddball type of church, right? A renegade oddball type of church. Okay. So, let me plug this in and then uh, Kesha, let's see if it'll go. And I got 10 minutes here. Oh, you know what? I better take off Let me take off the uh the case. That way we can Let's see if it'll pull up. I just made an updated. Okay, now it's got downloads. Just give it give it a second here. So, Moses, let's look at Moses. Oh, there we go. Let's see if that'll work. We'll just give it a second here. coming up. That's okay if I don't. I can actually try on my laptop. I just want to give you a more updated on the uh middle of the road. Brother says we got to stay right in the middle of the road. No, come up. Okay, no problem. Let me try this other one now. So, let's uh finish with this here. Moses. So, let me go through these quotes and then we'll try to find it on here. Moses is the second example. This is at the hour and 28 minute mark. Remember, this is a three-hour sermon. Uh, Brother Bam says he said in Moses day, it was another time of deliverance when God is just about to do something to deliver his people. God sends a message to the people and it's so simple as we'll catch in the breaking of these seals. That was my purpose in bringing this. Okay. So, Brother Brham brings this this message, God hiding himself in simplicity because God's bringing a message to deliver his people from dark denominationalism. That's an actual quote from brother Brandham. He's bringing us out of the dark denominations into the light of the bride of Jesus Christ. So, God's got to send a message to bring us out. And it's the open book. Hallelujah. Praise God. The book, the seals have been broken. Now, we know the revelations. We have thus sayith the Lord on the mysteries of God. They're finished. And that brings us out of dark denominationalisms in order to get ready for the rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ. Okay, simple, right? Very simple. He says, we find out then the breaking those seals is so simple that the smart miss it a million miles. I hope that God anoints me for it. See, it just goes over the top. He says, now church, notice what do they miss? Just basically just some simple things. They miss the anointing of the four beasts. If you asked a Catholic, "Which anointing of the four beasts do you have?" What what do you think they'd say? They'd say, "I don't know. I just pray to Mary. I just pray to St. Michael, right? I just take the Eucharist." Right? Would Would they know? See, they don't even know what their anointing is for today. Now, church, if they're not careful, they're going to get the anointing of the beast system, the one world church, uniting with the government, right? That's the anointing they're going to be under. So they missed that. So this means they have no flying eagle anointing as we looked at on Wednesday. They're not getting renewed like the eagle, right? They're not around the fresh word. They're not watching and praying like they ought to be. They're they're looking for everyone to unite with Pope Leo. The bride's not going to unite with anything except thus say the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says uh they don't have the revelation of the Antichrist. They're missing that a million miles. They don't know the deeds of the nickels, the doctrines, the doctrine of Balum, the Jezebel religion. They don't know thus sayith the Lord from the prophet of God. They don't know that the voices of the seven thunders have uttered the revelations contained in the seven seals. They don't know any of this. They're missing all this. I'd say a million miles, maybe 10 million miles. He says, and notice what God done. He brought forth a child, Moses, a simple human being. He could have ordained the sun if he wanted to deliver them. He could have ordained the wind to deliver them. He could have ordained an angel to deliver them. Oh, hallelujah. God can do whatever he wants to do. Well, how do we know that, brother Brandham? God won't leave his program. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "How do we know God's going to send a prophet?" Well, because he did it in the previous days, he's got to do it again. He does not leave his program. That's the reason we know this day. It's got to be simple. Now, he always works in simplicity, but God in the beginning, he could have made the son to preach the gospel, the winds, an angel, but he ordained man for that purpose, and he never changes it. He never ordained denominations. Aren't you glad, church? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're not sitting in a denomination today? Because God didn't ordain it. God ordained to be just an organic holy ghost fil churches with no legalism over them with just bibleelving uh Christians preaching the gospel living the word of God not tied down to any man no headquarters the only headquarters is heaven &gt;&gt; that's what God ordained not a denomination &gt;&gt; think of that if we were ordained by a denomination someone could just make the decision I'm moving Jesse Smith now some of you might like that but they they could move me out of Akran and send me down there to Cincinnati or something like that &gt;&gt; just by the snap of a finger at headquarters. But you know, we have a greater headquarters. We have God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if God ordained me to be here, I want to be here as long as I can. Hallelujah. Doing God's will. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But think of that. A few men could get mad at me or they could just remove me right out. But if God's for me, who can be against me? Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every year, church, I'm sure you know this. Every year, the denominations have summer gatherings and they change some of their bylaws. Like this year, I think it was the Southern Baptist, they voted, some of them allowed to vote and have women preachers. Every year, they have these convent denominational conventions and they make suggestions on how they can improve the denomination and it creates a filthy, we'd say, spewed out system. The tables are full of vomit. Aren't you glad we had clean tables last week? Amen. Naturally, but also spiritually. See, we're not under the control of a denomination. So, if something's wrong here, pray God, give Brother Jesse a message. Give the preachers a message. Give a sister a gift in the church. God, we want something to change. We need the Holy Spirit to move. God, have your way. Praise God. We're not controlled by men and other men around here. We're controlled and moved by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've seen that in every situation. Uh when whenever there's trouble, just pray to God. Trust in God and stay with the word. God will work it out in time. &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. Don't get outside that word. You stay right with that word. Pray, &gt;&gt; fast, seek God's face. God knows how to work it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said he never ordained Hosea would like this one. He never ordained denominations. He never ordained groups of men. He ordained men to preach the gospel. Not machinery, not machinery, mechanical devices, or any angelic being. It was man. God didn't ordain machines to preach. Hallelujah. Like they do today. God doesn't ordain that. God ordained a living man who has the spirit of burning. Amen. Whose lips have been touched by the coal of fire from the altar. They've had a sealing angel seal their soul with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's who God's called to lead the church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God that's always been his program. Noah, Moses are his examples thus far. Now, I love this quote and let me just end with this before I get to the visual. I still can't believe that don't work. I don't I got a new phone because I gave Mali he needed a new phone. So, I got a new phone. There's some setting on here. Try it one more time. Just weird. Every other phone worked like that. I think it's just a setting. I probably got to try it again there. Unless Simon maybe Simon, you know how he he has to hook up. Maybe I didn't switch something back. You know, maybe something like that. All right. Not going to play very nicely. Okay. All right. Well, I'll still look it up in just a moment. Let me close with this here. Oh, yeah. I'm right at 1 hour right now. Okay. 20 seconds. Let me close with this quote. This beautiful quote. Now, God hid himself in simplicity in Noah and Moses. And the church said, &gt;&gt; now look at this. I want you to bring this out. This is a good this relates to brother Chris's question. When does the gift manifest? Look at this quote. I love this. God bringing deliverance through Moses had to train him in wisdom. Look, for 40 years, he trained him in wisdom &gt;&gt; to let him fall. &gt;&gt; Church, it looks like now it looks from our minds like that 40 years was just a waste. like he wasted. He wasted 40 years. It wasn't a waste. &gt;&gt; God built him up for 40 years just so he could fall. &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. We think, "Oh, I feel like I've wasted years of my life." Church, you haven't wasted nothing. If you're living for God, there's not been anything wasted in your life. And I'll say like this. Even if you got a call in the life for your future, you haven't wasted anything. Hallelujah. Praise God. For 40 years, brother, I said, "God, build him up in let him get built up with ancient Egypt wisdom just to let him fall to show Moses you cannot lean upon the arm of your own understanding or anybody else's understanding." &gt;&gt; In other words, God will let you fall. God will let you make mistakes just to just to prove to you that you cannot lean on your thoughts or anybody else's. You've got to lean on God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he let him do it for four decades, 40 years. &gt;&gt; Let him think, "Oh, I've got the training. I know how to run military. I can deliver these people. Yes, I can calculate how to get them out. I'll use this machine. I'll use that. I use that war tactic." And God let it fall to the ground just to show them, you cannot trust in other things. You cannot trust in the wise and prudent. You've got to be a baby in my sight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. You've got to be a child before God. If God if God's going to use you, church, you can't trust in how much you know, what you've been through, what you've learned naturally. You have to lean upon you cannot lean upon the arm of the flesh. You've got to lean upon God's arm. I forget which king it was. I think it was Asa. I've been reading through Chronicles and Asa had this awesome testimony. But then one time something came up with another king and he paid money so some king would back him up. And God sent a prophet with thus sayith the Lord. He said because you trusted in man. He said now you have enemies against you. I thought what a lesson for us when problems come up just we just try to throw money at it or do we say God help me out Lord God. Money could help but Lord what do you want done? God had to train him in wisdom to let him fall to show you cannot lean upon the arm of your own understanding or anybody else's. Let him fall to show his hand. So God will let you fall to show your hand can't bring deliverance. Only God's can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And church, do we know is Moses in the Hall of Fame of faith? Did he make it, church? Oh yeah, he made it. Praise God. You mean you can make it in the hall of fame of faith and have mistakes? Yes. That that's the only people that get put in there actually. They have to make mistakes first and realize I can't do anything for God. I've got to lean on God. &gt;&gt; I can't trust in flesh. I can't trust in men or women. I can only trust in the living God. And then God can use me. Are you hearing the word of God today? &gt;&gt; Let him fall. God let him fall to show his hand. Can you see it? Brother Bram says God's purpose in doing so was to display himself in humility. God raised him up and let him fall flat on his face as a murderer, let alone as a murderer &gt;&gt; to show him you can't trust in your muscles. You can't trust in your your wisdom. You can't trust in any of that. God cannot use any of that. He can only trust you as you trust him. Let's stand to our feet by God's grace. That was an hour and two minutes, church. How many enjoyed the word today? &gt;&gt; I'll show you that visual later. That's why we got two services by God's grace. Musicians could come. Amen. I think that thought fits very well for us today. Brother Chris asked, you know, when is God going to use your gifts? I say like this. God will use your gifts when you've fallen on your face and failed so many times that you finally make the decision, God, I'm going to do what you want me to do. I'm going to trust in you. Great, great question, brother. Hallelujah. God will let us go through all this, try human understanding, and that plan will fall, fail miserably, and then we'll say, "God, I need you to bring this to pass." Let's bow our heads. I'm sure, church, I don't have to I don't have to ask you to raise your hand. I'm sure all of us want God to bring something to pass in our lives. And we try. We can try with all of our might like Moses, but we got to become like a baby and God will reveal his plan of deliverance. Hallelujah. With our heads bowed, church, I trust the Holy Ghost spoke something to you. And I trust there's something in here that you can go and study tomorrow. Or maybe you've already got a leading of the Lord. Maybe you're already in the seals. Maybe you're already in the church ages. And so, yes, keep doing that wherever God's leading you. But you got to get alone and ponder the word of God. You've got to meditate on the things of God. And friends, as you know, it's the greatest time of the day when you get to think about God. No better thought than God. Hallelujah. Thou my best thought by day or by night. Be thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart. Hallelujah. Let me pray for you, church. And let's pray for one another if we could by God's grace. Father God, I'm so happy to be here today. Judgment begins right here at the house of God. Lord, the world, they don't want their lives judged. They don't want to know right from wrong. Lord, we want to know it right here, Lord God. I want to know right from wrong, Lord God. We are a royal priesthood. Simon preached on it. The priesthood shows the difference between holy and unholy. So Lord, today in my humble, simple way, I'm just trying to preach what you placed on my heart. These thoughts of I've studied. Oh God, help us to realize we're a royal priesthood. And deliverance will not come by our thinking, by our plans. Our plans will fail. Deliverance will come by God's simplicity. By doing what God said, by trusting in God. Lord, I trust in you today, Lord God. I want to say that aresh. I want to trust in you, Lord God. I don't just want to throw money or or throw words or something at a situation. I want to look to God. Lord, what is your will for this situation? [Music] I want to run to Jesus when I've got problems. I want to run to prayer. I want to run to the Lord. God, show me, Lord, the path. Grant it, Lord Jesus. Now Lord, I pray as brother Chris had mentioned about the gifts. Lord, I just pray each person can find their place. Lord God, Lord, sometimes you let us go so long to teach us that we're going to make mistakes and fail so we can trust in you. God, help every person to trust in you today. Lord God, we are oddball church. We're a little unknown, insignificant, radical church. So radical. But yet, Lord, as others have told us, your presence lives here, God. Oh Lord, just keep dwelling amongst us, Lord God. Please never leave us or forsake us. If that would happen, it would be the worst thing, Lord God. The worst thing that your presence couldn't dwell amongst us anymore. That people couldn't be delivered. People couldn't be saved. People couldn't get power in their lives by the Holy Ghost. That'd be the worst thing if you left and you forsook us, oh God. And that would only be because we forsook you, Lord God, because you are faithful. You are kind. You're gracious and loving. As many as you love, you rebuke and chasen, Lord God. [Music] Oh Lord, we thank you, Lord God, for your grace, Lord God. Thank you for raising us up so we could fall on our faces and realize only God can do it. And we've got to take your way, Lord God. Your ways are better than our ways, Lord God. Your thoughts are higher than our thoughts, Lord God. As high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are your mercies, Lord God. Extended to us, Lord God. So, Father, I pray you meet the people where they are, Lord. If they need prayer with me, I'll be happy to pray with them. if they need to talk it over with you, I pray they'll stay in the sanctuary and talk it over. May we be mindful if people are praying to exit quickly, Lord God. But Father, we want this time to be beneficial, Lord God. We don't want it to go in one ear and out the other and forget what we heard. We don't want to be hearers only. We want to be doers of the word of God. We're so thankful we're not a million miles away, Lord God. Thank you, Jesus. I didn't leave the chapel to keep going millions of miles more away. I left the chapel so I could come to the middle of the road. I could come right down the middle of the highway of holiness. Lord God, I don't want to go away from you, Lord. I want to draw to you, Lord God. Hallelujah. As you said, Lord Jesus, come unto me all ye weary and heavy laden, and I'll give you rest for your souls, Lord. My soul has rest in this place or any message church where there's the presence of Jesus Christ. Lord God, [Music] Lord, we all get weary. So we come to you, Lord. We come to yoke up with you to learn of you, Lord Jesus. Teach us, Lord God, that if we fall on our face, it's only an opportunity for us to trust you. Take your ways. Your ways are better. Hallelujah. Grant it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
