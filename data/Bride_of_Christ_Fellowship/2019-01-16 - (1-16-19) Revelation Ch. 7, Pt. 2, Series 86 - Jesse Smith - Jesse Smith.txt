thank you lord thank you Jesus praise now let's take our Bibles here tonight let's go to Revelation chapter 7 I like to now flip back to the revelation series I'm trying to balance about three three topics at the same time and I just really get inspired you know I'll study one topic and then I'll get excited about the other one and I'll try to jump back and study that one but it's going good I'm really thankful the progress you know on the numbers series and the revelation series and like there's one more oh the purpose one I've just done two on that one but it's been a real blessing praise God and they've all been timely so I'm very thankful for that by the grace of the Lord Revelation chapter 7 verse 9 I want to finish chapter 7 today and then Lord willing we'll look at chapter 8 next time no once you get past chapter 7 a lot of it deals with the Jews for a while of course till chapter 10 then we'll get back to the Jews on 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 and you get to the mother harlot in 17 and 18 and you finally get back to the bride in chapter 19 by God's grace so we're thankful for the Word of God praise God revelation 7 verse 9 the Bible says this after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and Kindred's and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb the prophet said this is the quietest place you ever gonna live a multitude crying salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb a multitude without number o gonna be a glorious day that day oh thank you Jesus and all the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their face and worship God saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving an honor and power and might be unto our God for ever and ever amen there's that Sevenfold worship yep that's right Sevenfold worship right there in verse 12 praise God seven I'm sorry verse thirteen and one of the elders answered and said unto me what are the arrayed in white robes and whence can they and I sent him Sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation not the Great Tribulation but they came out of Great Tribulation the Prophet emphasizes that and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb therefore are they before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither shall sorry neither thirst any more neither shall the Sun light on them nor any Heat let's read 17 together ready one two three four the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes let's have one more word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto God hear Heavenly Father we just come to you tonight Lord we're needy we need a fresh touch of fresh anointing Lord why pray Lord you just inspire us through these scriptures Lord God let this be our testimony Lord and if you grant him by your grace and by the blood of that lamb dear God may we be among this multitude dear God we ask it humbly reverently in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you being seated praise God okay you can flip over there I got just some quotes I'd like to share here tonight relations seven here like to look at this here and then we'll get to more willing Chapter eight and the future by God's grace so with Chapter seven this is part two of this chapter and then part 86 now last time we looked at the 144,000 a couple weeks ago that was a real blessing by the grace of Lord and I think it was just like two days after that when he sent me a link to an article about the hundred about the Jews and how they're working more on building their their there their steps up to an altar and I just seen the article last week two from the Temple Mount Institute they've got this altar built up there by the Wailing Wall and so they're getting closer they're wanting to practice now they're not going to sacrifice until they get their actual temple but they're so longing to have a temple that they're already building that platform and they have an altar and then they practice up there which is really striking and Wendy didn't know I preached on it you know because she was a I think of the other church on the Wednesday night so it was I saw two witnesses there so I was happy about that but let's look tonight at this Revelation chapter 7 so 1 through 8 was the 144,000 we looked at that as we said now verses 9 to 17 is the Gentile multitude so let's look at this tonight by God's grace now the main question and I preach us a little while ago the main question and message believers Minds is is this the bride or the foolish virgin now I don't know about you but I just found three more quotes today to make it six quotes about the being the bride and one about the foolish version I got more now I got we got some more ammunition here or just say we've got more proof that we feel it's the bride now as we'll get to this a little later if people want to believe this is the foolish version that's okay too it doesn't really matter to me it's not a point of argument or it's not a point of contention but it is interesting to look at it and I think if you look at the the evidence brother Branham says if you look at the evidence in the text it looks like it's the bride so let's go through these quotes now I'm going chronologically in order this is a new one because I made it in yellow I don't know if you can tell it's yellow or not can you tell that's yellow up there okay this is from January 3rd 1954 brother random reads revelation 7:15 therefore they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in the temple now where does mrs. Branham serve me at in the house that's the bride mrs. Neville that's where she stays in the house serving you that's where the bride's at not the servants the bride all right now it's interesting the Bible uses the word serve but then brother Branham says not the servants so you got to be real careful how you interpret brother branham's quotes because the Bible said then he says the bride is gonna serve him but he said not the servants the bride so just got to keep it straight and just you know got to keep it straight like I said this doesn't pertain to salvation this actually pertains to rewards right future events and like I said we're not going to spend many sermons on this chapter I think just two and then we'll move on you know to chapter eight now this is the the second quote this is from the seal of God four months later brother Graham reads revelation 7:14 these are they which come out of Great Tribulation he said they're called Holy Roller made fun of persecuted laughed at so see program says if you even get laughed at for what you believe you're getting persecuted if someone calls you a Holy Roller oh you just think you're so much holier than us or you're just some old legal s see when anytime you get made fun of it's great tribulation come out up out of Great Tribulation and watch their robes and made them white in the blood of lamb watch they are before the throne of God where does the wife stay says four months later where does the Queen stay that's the bride the Gentile bride and they serve Him day and night in the temple he said my wife serves me at the house day and night see that's the bride of Jesus that's the Gentile bride quote number two third one as a new one I found today from the Philadelphia Church age December 10th there's Lydia's birthday for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and lead them in the fountains of waters and God shall wipe all tears from their eyes there he is there's the bride oh my how beautiful the bride amens there's your three new ones they were all earlier than any ones I never heard before now number four is one I preached already bo-ram says now if you want to see the bride come up after that after the 144,000 to show this 144,000 it's not the bride just continue to read now on down from that that he says oh I mean from the seventh chapter let's start at the ninth verse because the eight verses the sealing of Benjamin the twelve thousand now like this he reads verse eight in Chapter seven he said I'm sorry this is verse nine and after this hello a great multitude which no man could number here comes the bride amen so verse nine in Chapter seven the prophet of God said here comes the bride and I wonder if Jesus would look out at you and tonight say here is the bride here comes the bride is the bride here tonight praise God this ought to be the bride here tonight praise the Lord what does your wife do she serves you in the house you sit down she give your food she fixes the clothing she serves you day night in the house and this one these of all nations the Gentiles which is the bride are before the throne of God with him day and night I'll remember what we said last night and talked on it all right now we're skipping a heads that was 1960s so we have we have four quotes before 1960 before the seals this one's after the seals will the prophet of Malachi 4 be the one to call the Gentile remnant of revelation 7:9 even though they go through the Tribulation Period no no after the revelation 7 is where we've seen the 144,000 sealed after that he saw coming up coming back was that great number which no man could number which was the bride the mouth then Malachi 4 we finished in the bride taken up and the group of the Elijah and Elijah returned back to the earth for the church to go through the Tribulation Period but Elijah and Elijah will not have anything to do with the sleeping bird they're Gentiles they'll be sent only to the Jews praise God now number six the sixth and final one so now I used to have three verse one now I've got six verse one if anyone really wants to search you to have praise God number six this is from the church age book whether random allowed this to be in print so I put a little bit more emphasis on the church age book because he had time and time to read it over and mother Jose has a article from sister Rebecca that says they she edited it I think five times brother I think that was five times I think brother Jose sent that to me so sister Rebecca testified that she and brother Branham read through this book five times so I just put a little bit more weight on that cuz he had time and time again to go over it but man said God is talking about the bride here do you want to see another picture of her it's over revelation 7 4 to 17 and I heard the number of them which were sealed okay so there's the six there's six of them now the only time he called revelation 7 the foolish version was in the seventh seal he said now we're in the age of the eagle the revelation to be revealed the whole thing now compare this with Revelation the tenth chapter verse 1 to 7 and we'll see here in this revelation 10 1 to 7 that in the days of the sounding of the seventh angels message was the finish of all the mysteries of God now we find now in the sixth seal now being open it was a three-fold purpose now here was the purposes the first thing was that the seeping versions had to go through the Tribulation Period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message so look she rejected the message and that's striking so that's interesting the foolish virgin hears the message but she rejects it now I think a lot of those people actually be in message churches because they had actually got to hear it or maybe they heard it on Facebook or maybe they heard it on YouTube right this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th chapter that she had been purged and she been given her robes shibam says the the foolish virgin we see her in the seventh chapter we in the six and seven chapter all right now this is an interesting thought brother kam and I were talking on this and I believe this is the bride but brother Brett kam and I was talking and we it kind of came out it could be both this could potentially be both the foolish virgin and the wise virgin it could be both not really sure but I believe it's the bride myself now here's the reason why brother Brandon says they asked for the RAM where are the foolish virgins during that thousand-year millennium and he says in the Millennium there in the grave the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years now this quote is a little mysterious because as far as I know there's only two options where a soul can go it can either go to prison the prison house in the heart of the earth or it goes to the sixth dimension under the altar because the Jews who are not born again where do they go they go to the sixth dimension under the altar and they're not born again they're not even trying to get to the blood they don't even know there is a blood of Jesus Christ for them so to me this quotes of the mysterious we don't understand this but to me I believe the foolish merchantmen she's got to go one or the other well she's she's justified as sanctified she just not filled with Holy Spirit so I believe if God lets the Jew who's don't even look to the blood if God lets the Jew the faithful Jew come up God will let the foolish virgin come up because at least she's burgeoned to the word that's my understanding I could be wrong because if the Jews without the Holy Ghost go to heaven the sixth dimension and not the prison when the foolish virgin without the holy ghosts have a similar waiting place now recall this remember there's no slow sleeping all foolish virgin are live somewhere and thank God for that praise God because brother an tells us there's no soul sleeping they can't go like and and have their souls resting in the in that casket their souls don't risk in the casket the Bible says every man lives and then the judgment right so the foolish version is going to be saved on on the white throne judgment then they if they're going to be saved then they've got to go to the same place because they're not going to be judged they're not going to go to hell right they're not going to be in the prison house they're not going to be waiting in prison they were just foolish so I believe they've got to go up to the sixth dimension somewhere now the fifth seal program says this now the Jews they had their blindness martyred their Messiah and now they were reaping it they realize it they recognize after it was going on they seen then when they come before the altar of God but now is now the grace of God is to them all right now look at that church they they martyred Jesus Christ they killed Jesus Christ but they're still grace for them and the church said Oh amazing grace amen oh thank God for Amazing Grace II then God gives grace to people that murdered his own son no no we know they were blind but God's grace extended to them because they made Jesus Christ a martyr blindly but I have said now watch they could not by no means be Saints because they would already be robed amen see a saint of God gets a roll right now praise God if you're a believer you've got a new robe on you might not see it on my outside we might not have the nicest clothes but if you're a saint of God you've got the shiniest white robes on you could possibly want praise God there's no Clorox so there's no department store Coles or anybody nobody can produce out a wider road than the right white robe you've got all by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen see there already rode but here they are now just souls under the altar for the word of God and the testimony they held for being God's people the Jews but now watch the grace of God comes to them and Jesus gives them each one a white robe watch plumb over after the church is gone raptured up because they were loyal to their cause and they were blinded and they didn't know it they didn't know it they didn't know it they were playing exactly the part of the God ordained for them to play and here John looks over and sees souls under the altar praise God Amen thank the Lord now look what he says see I believe he said this official proves the opening of this seal in the last day it takes soul sleeping plumb out of the way there see they're alive they're not dead so faithful Jews without the baptism of the Holy Ghost are living that I meant alive not live in the sixth dimension they're alive praise the Lord they're alive there's no soul sleeping the soldiers don't lay there in the casket they go somewhere and a church das ìitís you're attracted one way or the other let's be attracted to heaven praise God so that when when we drop this natural body of God terry's that our souls will be taken up praise God the angels of God will pack us to the presence of God amen let's be magnetized to heaven hallelujah like like that machine brother Aaron talked about the factory that had the magnet and I pulled up all the all the shavings of of the metal let's be shavings a metal that's me little licks of fire off the main fire and let's be raptured up hey man hallelujah glory I remember there's only seven dimensions light matter time science hell's the fifth dimension paradise and then God you've only got seven dimensions so the foolish virgin she's not going to be in these three or those four she's either going to be in five six or seven and if the Jews who's blinded doesn't go down here even though they were martyred Jesus or made Jesus a martyr how could God let the foolish virgin go here I don't think he would I think he would take him to paradise amen now only the only the real predestiny to get to go there that 24 the 24 elders and Moses and Elijah amen only they get to really go up there before the time they go to the seven dimension by the throat of God does that help by God's grace the foolish virgin has to go either five six or seven and it seems like she'd have to go to six I believe because there's no soul sleeping the souls don't go to sleep they have to they have to be alive somewhere now where are they I don't know that's why I said revelation seven could be the the foolish and the wise together it could be or there could be another place under the altar for the foolish virgin we don't know but there's a special place for the Jews those who don't have white robes on imagine there'd be a special place for the the first version who don't have white robes either because they're not born again not but I could be wrong now let's balance some of these quotes because what people have got upset with me on emails of course and not really in person but some people said oh how can you be a pastor when you don't take the clue in the in the seven seals where program said revelation seven is the foolish virgin he said don't you know the seals were the most inspired sermon brother Branham preached and I said well yeah they were but they weren't the only inspired one brother Bram preached right now here's what I'm gonna skip that now brother Ram did say if I ever preach anything that was inspired in my life it was the seals but you have to remember that was just one quote and he didn't say thus saith the Lord it was the most ever and every single word was thus saith the Lord he never said that but see people will hang on a quote and without proper balance they'll think they're right and they won't be open to receiving more of the Holy Spirit's revelation or they won't even be open to maybe thinking I'm wrong see that's pride pride has taken over rather than meek humility the learners attitude where God can teach you more about the word of God in souls that are in prison programs they remember the seven seals was finished when those seven revealed truths one of them he wouldn't permit us to know how many was here at the seven seals hurt all of you okay I guess the seventh seal you wouldn't permit it he stood right there in the room and revealed every one of them and if I ever preached anything in my life was inspired it was that and it ought to be true to you stand here and tell you that even it's going to happen and go right there and even science and everything else that scientific research and everything mystery to the people prove that it happened right there and come back and hear it unfold make every word exactly right what day are we living in where we at now remember not every word in the seals was thus saith the Lord brother I made a mistake right when he preached on the sixth seal and they asked him brother man did you mean to say 7000 who had not bowed their knee to Balaam or 700 seven thousand I meant to say forgive me for that so see he said something wrong he said forgive me for that it's just a matter of speech like I said awhile ago did you notice me stay here and they bear records seeing the lamb see the lamb was on earth see bear record seeing the Spirit of God coming upon the lamb now yes I'm at forgive me please and you brethren you on the tape out there friends listen I didn't mean to say that like that of a minister of the gospel many times as I preach that I know that was 7000 I just happen to say 700 I didn't I didn't mean just 700 I just didn't read it out of the scripture praise God so what's the absolute is brother Graham the absolute err is the scripture the absolute the scripture it just come to my mind while I was talking I just said 700 instead of 7,000 I make them mistakes all the time and if you listen to the tapes that's right but to us it doesn't really matter about those little mistakes because we know what he's talking about right and we're not trying to try to find some secret revelation that that's so mysterious that that makes us better than the other churches we're not trying to find that we're trying to be in one accord with the other churches we're not trying to exalt ourselves above other churches now look look how humble brother Branham says I sure am a dummy he says now that's that's really being humble because he's not so you forgive me I didn't mean to do that okay so there's this man that gets so upset at me and said oh you want to take the seven seals don't you know that's the most inspired one well yeah it was inspired it's very inspired but that doesn't mean every word is better than other sermons if that's the case let's just take the seven seals and just get rid of everything else you know because what about this quote church program says notice after them seven seals uniting of the people what United signs the red flashing light of the last days the sign of women getting prettier and man what they would do all these signs of the Holy Spirit leading up that come right back there to the capping off of all those messages since the seven seals it's capped off in this one thing the token that we are all right see just check ourselves and see if we're in the faith so the brother Adam says the seven seals all the service after the seven seals are capped off in the token the baptism of only ghosts so the token is a very important message as well the seals are important but the token is very important because the token says we're all right praise God and we are going in there after the token is our ticket in the rapture praise God hallelujah to see people exalt well the seals are higher than this now don't get me wrong there was great revelation the seals but you've got to take all of it and you've got to line it all up with the Word of God now I'm gonna do some Bible teaching here by the grace of Lord I want to preach about maybe half an hour more Lord willing and let's go through this chapter so if you got to Bob let's go through revelation 7 here and let's look at some evidence that proves this is the bride but like I said honestly it could be the foolish virgin and the bride it could be because the timing of it may be it may be after it may be after Armageddon and it may be in the Millennium now one thing's for sure it doesn't look like it's in the future home because the Bible said they're in a temple they're in a temple and in the future home there's no more temple because the Bible said the lamb is the temple are with me Church so this has either got to be at the marriage supper of the Lamb while the tribulation is going on or it's got to be in the Millennium it's either one or the other now we've been taught that the foolish version doesn't live in the Millennium that that's probably true but it could be we you know but it was never said thus saith the Lord so it could be that they live and serve somehow I don't know I've always taught that that the foolish virgin doesn't reign in the Millennium but then where would where would she have to be she have to be in that six dimension then right she can't be in the fifth she can't be in the one two three four right because there's no soul sleeping so there's either guys she's either got to be in the fifth six but maybe not the seventh right if that's the case all right so let's look at some scriptures so verse nine and after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and Kindred's and peoples and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands now did you notice if you go to Revelation 10 verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings so we have a little bit of an overlap with peoples and nations and tongues there okay see how there's a little bit of overlap revelation 10 of course deals with the bride because she receives the open book from the seventh angel who received it from Christ she eats the book and then she prophesize again to all Kindred's nations tongues and kings well now we see in heaven now we see that group is up in heaven amen so that proofs that the bride of Jesus Christ is going to take the message all around the world amen that's right praise God thank you lord so verse nine proves that in Revelation 7 verse 9 it proves it all right now let's look at a few scriptures about the multitude so if you got your Bible here now why don't I just do this one I just pull it up up here it might make it a little bit easier alright Galatians three seven I might just make it easier for everybody Galatians three seven eight nine all right know ye therefore that they which are faith the same of the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham praise God so here we see all nations remember revelation 7:9 said a number no man could number of all nations so here is the all nations that have the same faith of blessed Abraham praise God alright now let's go to Revelation 19 verse six [Music] six and seven and as I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as I heard the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent rain let us be glad rejoice and give honour for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready praise God everybody see the great multitude the voice of a great multitude so when Jesus gets ready to come back John hears a great multitude saying Alleluia the Lord God omnipotent reigneth area oh there's a there's a multitude in heaven and they know Jesus is going to come back and they say praise our God the Lord God omnipotent reigns Jesus is coming back to get his bride who's made herself ready ha ha ha hallelujah amen it's great multitude this voice of many waters that's Jesus's voice right the Bible said is that a voice of many waters hallelujah and they say hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigns oh my this is the quietest place we're ever going to be hallelujah thank the Lord amen now did you know the name Abraham from other scripture Abraham means father of a multitude so this great multitude is the scene of Abraham because Abraham means father of a multitude praise God all right now that's verse 9 revelation 7:9 I'm gonna go back there hello I heard a great I'm sorry a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and Kindred's peoples into this all nations kindred tongue and people we made a connection to Revelation 19 in Revelation 10 they have to be Gentiles with faith in Jesus Christ and they stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands now look Church there before the lamb so this either has to be at the marriage supper of the lamb or this has to be in the millennial reign because the Lambs they're right when the 144,000 get the Holy Ghost the Lambs with them praise God this has to be at the marriage supper of the lamb or after Armageddon after the atomic fire burns the earth and the Saints walk out on the ashes of the wicked and they they build houses and inhabit you know that happiness of the earth for a thousand years but this is before the lamb and notice Church they're clothed with white robes so these people had the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that's what right white robe represent amen Alleluia and they got palms in their hands praise the Lord they got palms in their hands what the praise our God hallelujah thank the Lord so we see it's got to be Holy Ghost field Saints now that's what I believe that's why I believe it's the bride if the Jews didn't have white robes yet remember there they say give us white robes you know they cry out for vengeance they don't have the baptism all the ghosts if they don't have them then I wouldn't think the foolish virgin would have white robes so that's why I do believe it is the bride but it could be both it's like I said it could be sometime after there could be some mystery that I don't understand yet alright verse 10 and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne amen and under the lamb so see God is the lamb right it's not a second person the lamb is God amen hallelujah that's right so we see the oneness of the Godhead in verse 10 all the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worship God so the elders of 24 elders and the four beasts mine can you imagine all the angels with the four cherubim with the twenty-four elders and they're the ones that fall down the great multitudes got their palms and they're waving their palms but then this special group right around the throne they fall down and church what does it show the closer you get to God the more humble you are hey hey man are you with a church are ya those closest to the throne are the ones that fell down and praise so the closer you get to God the more you love love you have for God the more humble you're gonna be and the more you're gonna fall down when you're in his presence Oh hallelujah that's good church that's real good see because you see a lot of people that come to our church or other churches and they never bow down they never humble themselves to the word they just warm up you right but where's the ones that are really humble really receiving the Word of God really wanna worship those are hard to find but the closer you get to God the more humble you are amen that's right that's true church the closer the more you pray the closer you get to God that's right so see the ones closest to Christ are the ones that fall down and worship that's good that's right verse 12 saying amen blessing glory wisdom Thanksgiving honor and power and might be unto our God for ever and ever amen there's that Sevenfold worship again right seven is the number of completion seven blessings they they bless on the Lord seven words of blessing starting with blessing and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they so who are they and how do you get a white robe amen this is what I kind of want to broan for a little bit here how many want to be in that multitude now how many want to be there well you're gonna find out how to get there if you want to get there you can find out tonight how to get there hey Laurie what are these and whence came they how did they get here who are they how'd they get here and I said sir down of us and he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb alright let's look at tribulation alright now in Matthew 13 21 remember there's four kinds of grounds four kinds of hearts let's just look at the scripture here the second kind where do they fall away for the Bible said they get offended when they get teased for being in the message or they get offended when when somebody makes a comment oh you're look at your wife and skirts oh I can't you you're just a why can't you come in and go to the party with us man be a real man but the Bible said he had no root in himself but dureth for a while this is the seed that falls on the stony ground for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he's offended alright so how do you how are you going to get there Church you have to endure persecution you have to be offended I'm sorry you cannot be offended by the Word of God you have to just stand with the Word of God amen that's the great test you can't get offended when people make fun of you you can't be offended when people leave you can't be offended when someone speaks evil about you or makes or makes you look like a fool you can't be offended you've got to just stand with the Word of God you've got to be more impressed with the Word of God then you are with your feelings you've got to care nothing for your feelings and you've got to think great things about Jesus Christ amen hallelujah glory thank you lord the trouble is today people get offended one little thing oh don't tell anybody what church I go to don't tell anybody what I believe this is a rugged coming out time for me how about you church I'm putting all this things I I just like about the Trinity on Facebook I'm putting all these things out my books about ready to come out Lord willing everyone's gonna know where I stand if if I haven't had a chance to talk to him yet they're gonna find out pretty soon we're gonna see how much offense I can give or how much offense I can take by the grace of God we must not be offended we've got to humbly say the word is on absolute I'm standing by Jesus because Jesus is the word of God glory see tribulation tribulation is gonna arise it's gonna rise up against you right when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise the standard against it amen ah don't you like that praise God look at that it's gonna rise there's the flood there's the enemy coming in like a flood it rises against you so God is gonna raise you up Church amen when if something comes again when your friends come against you or an adult comes against you or or somebody of a preacher comes against you when that rises against you God's gonna raise you up against that Amen can I say like this your wave is coming to say like that when that wave comes against you don't get discouraged there's gonna be a wave come to raise you up against it hallelujah God will raise a standard against the enemy that's right all right John 16:13 praise God John 16:33 the spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have no you might have you possibly may have in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world a man glory you shall have tribulation remember Jesus who are they who are the angel they are they which came out of Great Tribulation all Christians have to go through tribulation they in the world you shall have tribulation praise God it's not it's not an option if you're a real Christian you're gonna be persecuted you're gonna be rejected it's the Word of God all right acts 14 12 just gonna kind of want to build your faith here you know I know it's built in mind you like I said because with everything the book coming out everything I'm sure I'm gonna get a little bit of backlash but God's with me praise God confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God amen a little bit of tribulation or much much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God now look at the compromise Romans 5:8 preached on this recently I believe no 5/3 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience so we take courage when we go through trials because we know it's producing patience we glory in that oh thank you lord I know you're working it out I know I'm going through a great trial going through a going through a great battle but it's gonna produce patience in my life and the church said the Bible said we glory in it so we say Oh glory praise God God's using this to make me a patient person I don't want to be an impatient pastor I want to be a patient pastor you don't want to be an impatient father or mother or grandmother or grandfather you want to be a patient parent or grandparent well the only way that happens is to go through tribulation it's got to work in you trials got up working you thank God that patience works experience and experience gives you a real hope romans 8 one of the most encouraging chapters in the Bible who shall separate it from the love emulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword none of these things that we hardly know about the only that we could get close to it just be tribulation or maybe some distress we might go through a little maybe a little bit of persecution but famine nakedness peril or sword we none of us have probably gone through that but it's it's it's it's known to the scripture these things cannot separate you from the love of Christ in other words God loves you in the midst of persecution God loves you in the midst of tribulation in the midst of troubles in the midst of peril God loves you he's not going to easily did not pull his love away from you his love is with you amen that's right why because you're a sheep he loves his sheep as is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter amen nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us praise God so you know you see what the Bible says you were made to conquer your persecutions you got to conquer them you were made to conquer your tribulations it isn't it isn't although as me it isn't it self-pity why do I got to go through this that's not that's not the attitude the attitude is conquer it praise God the attitude is is cut off the enemy's armor cut down the enemy chop them down as brother Anderson chop down your enemy chop it down be a conqueror God wants you to be an overcomer we must overcome and tribulation and persecution these little persecutions go through it's made as our enemy so we can conquer by God's love amen hallelujah praise God through him that loved us amen how you gonna do it brother just how you gonna get through the persecution or trial I'll remember that he loves me amen I remember that he died for me I'll remember that while I was yet a sinner God loved me and sent Jesus to die for me while I was in my sins praise God for Paul was persuaded Paul made up his mind I'm persuaded neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come amen glory nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord amen there's nothing now that can separate you from God love there's nothing from your past that can separate you from God's love and there's nothing in the future that can separate you from God's love amen glory hallelujah thank you lord I'm starting to feel like I'm one of those great multitude Saints they've had I think yeah thank you hard because the persecutions in mind let's see 2000 or 99 I gave my heart to Lord so these twenty years I've served the Lord now it's already twenty years my goodness these twenty years I've served the Lord they've only helped me fall more in love with Jesus and they haven't been able to separate me from the love of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah nothing can separate me from the love of Christ persecution won't tribulation won't that's because God's love is shut down in my heart that's what the Bible says glory talked about powerful chapter that's a way to end it right there remember who is gonna lay any charge through the bride because the bride's the elect who's gonna put any sin on you where you're you're not gonna be justified before God who's gonna do that no one the Bible said no one can do that because his love separates you from all your sins amen is forgiveness the blood of Jesus Christ separates you from your sins praise God Oh church I hope it's not getting old to us I hope the blood of Jesus Christ is not getting old to us amen if that's the case troubles on the way because you'll start flirting with the things of the world you fall more in love with the world then you'll fall in love with Jesus Christ or let's not flirt with the world Church let's stay in love with Jesus Christ there's no persecution there's no tribulation can separate you from the love of Jesus Christ Romans 12:12 this group came through great tribulation it didn't say the three and a half year tribulation it just said Great Tribulation and all these scriptures Church we're seeing that the Saints have to deal with tribulation Paul says here not slothful in business we shouldn't be lazy workers or lazy working for the kingdom of God we should be fervent boiling in spirit serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer glory I thought you like that praise God synchrony ins 1 verse 4 let's read verse 3 blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ now look at that there's the invisible spirit father and the lord jesus christ is the son the body the temple the father of mercies and the God of all comfort who comforts us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort where we ourselves are comforted of God I don't know about you but my biggest tribulations have been amongst message people right people that you think love you and then they turn on you like I've had situations the church where I get so nervous I start shaking brother Jose because I think what did I do wrong how can people accuse me of this sir the greatest persecutions I've experienced is right here right now that's until the squeeze but the greatest trials and and the most awful accusations have been right here amongst message people but the Bible says comforts us in all our tribulation you see each trial that comes what do we do we keep coming back here we come we keep worshiping the Lord and what does God do he comforts us as we worship he comforts us as we stay faithful he comforts us as we keep continuing serving him despite opposition he always the God of all comfort amen any trouble well brother I've had some real big trouble well sister I've had some real big trouble the Bible said he comforts you in any trouble any any doesn't matter well brother Jesse you don't know my trouble well the Bible said any trouble so God is with you in any single trouble all right any trouble you know last night I was talking to a mother she's in her 60s and her husband died on their bed and they and she had to give her CPR for 30 minutes and that's the one we prayed for the god brought back to life I finally got to talk to him he was in the coma if I got to talk to him last night and I said well how did you get through that how'd you get through your husband dying and having to pump his chest for 30 minutes how did you get through that being in a coma for over was it four weeks or two it was it two weeks in a coma for two weeks how do you get through that and you know what you said I felt God's prayers I felt the prayers of God's people and I felt God all around me hey nice you know he's not even a message believer but the Bible said there with you in any trouble how do people get through hard times when they lose loved ones or are they're persecuted or physical pain and suffering Jesus Christ is with them right there amen he's in the midst of the fire with them praise God hallelujah God promises comfort in any single trouble what a consolation of the children thank God the children should be happy knowing that whatever troubles you face in your life children Jesus is gonna be with you in every trouble and don't feel bad don't feel bad when bad things happen just know that God's with me and he's gonna comfort you praise God look at this saint of God second Grilli and seven four look at this this is powerful singer than 7-1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God a church we don't want to coast in our walk with God we don't just want to relax and be lazy and just coast we want a perfect holiness we want to get better at being a Christian right we want to get better at praying we want to get better at preaching we were to get better at hearing the Word of God we want to perfect holiness we don't want to get relaxed and holiness we don't want to backslide and holiness we want to perfect it hey man uh-huh think about that church Paul says you know don't get lazy in holiness get better at it get more holy but what does that require it requires sacrifice it requires dedication but we know with a lot of people what happens as they get older they just get relaxed right they they they stop trying to do do their best and they just get they just get lazy I'll say like that they just get happy with just being lazy they don't want to learn anything they don't want to grow they don't want to sacrifice anything that's something we all have to battle right Church we off to battle that perfected look at Paul says in verse 4 great is my bonus of speech toward you great is my glorying of you I'm filled with comfort I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation all of it all right well I better finish here by God's grace it's almost been an hour all right let's go back to Revelation 7:14 we'll hit a few more things and we'll finish up here but I hope you can see if you are going to be there with the white robe you're gonna have to go through tribulation Great Tribulation what was brother branham's remember we looked at a few weeks ago he moved out well as he went on and he started preaching doctrine you know the Serpent's eat around 58 he started getting less and less invitations less and less letters and then once he moved to Arizona he didn't get any invitations except from the business The Full Gospel businessmen can you imagine getting all them invites being so popular and then by the end just a few 10 or 15 years nobody likes you anymore nobody cares about you anymore everybody talks evil about you everybody says well Hosea he fell away at the end of his life he was a good man but then he fell away everybody well this this this brother served God pretty good but that you know Iggy back said you know he don't have nothing to do with him the Bible said we must enter through great persecution if that was brother Brandon's persecution what about ours that's why I don't feel bad when I don't get as many calls anymore to go preach places or people you know people call me less or talk to me less I don't feel bad if I get rejected because I know as Jesus went through three poles as brother Branham went through his three poles they didn't get more popular they got more rejected so how is how is the world going to accept me am I gonna get more popular am I gonna be rejected I'm probably be more rejected I'd imagine that's okay whatever it takes to be like Jesus whatever suffering it takes to be like Jesus I know he's with me Church in any trouble he's with you this he's with you in any trouble all right great tribulation and they washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb all right acts 22:16 that's good a few washing scriptures this ought to encourage all of us here I remember what they told Paul when he got saved Paul finally got saved he said and now why tarriest thou arise in me baptized and wash away thy sins calling upon the name of the Lord how does washing happen washing comes by repenting calling on God God forgive me fill me with the Holy Ghost a the head hallelujah that's what our children need to learn that's why I bring my children up here to pray right children eventually children I want you to start praying for the Holy Ghost you got a call to God for the Holy Ghost you say I have to say God I want to be filled with the Holy Ghost that's the reason why a lot of people don't get it because they don't call on the Lord O Jesus fill me with the Holy Ghost oh Jesus they don't call on God they just say well I guess I got it and they don't get it you've got to call you got to really repent you got to be baptized you got to get sanctified and you've got the call on God and children you don't have to go to a special meeting get the Holy Ghost you get those it goes right here Amen said he got the Holy Ghost right here breaks God amen it's okay to go to meetings to get the Holy Ghost that's fine but if you get back from that meeting and you're not on fire with the baptism Holy Ghost after a few months you didn't get the Holy Ghost you just got emotional amen glory we all seen that right we all seen people go out the meetings and get excited but come back and and you've seen at other churches maybe our church too but after a few months where's the fire where's the zeal where's the love for God it's not there anymore well I doubt very much they got to seal the Holy Ghost you got a call on the name of the Lord amen you've got to be hungry they the hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be filled you have to be one to be filled with the Holy Ghost more than you want you to work on the iPad can I bring it down to my children you've got a one through hole you got a hunger for the Holy Ghost more than to read the next novel this might you to understand you've got a hunger for the Holy Ghost more than to play with your toy sets although those are okay right you've got a hunger for you got a call on God you've got a hunger and thirst for righteousness and you shall be filled amen I'm not going to bring the Holy Ghost down to your level I'm trying to bring you up to God's level that's what I said that's what slick preachers do that's what false preachers do they try to bring the Holy Ghost down to you and say well you probably got it you know you don't have to really get desperate you come to church you believe God sent a prophet you got you probably got it that's not true you've got to die you've got a rot and then you can be bored amen you've got us you got a seek out you've got a hunger and thirst for righteousness then you're filled with the Holy Ghost I wish my children gonna see me when I was a sinner right then I wish she would have saw me come to the altar and pray for the Holy Ghost and cry out to God for the Holy Ghost I've cried out for I've gone out for the Holy Ghost I know what I'm talking about but a lot of people don't they just go to message churches and they say they got it but they never called out for it if you want to be washed you got a call out for it you've got to be desperate if you want the Holy Ghost praise God and all won't be popular preaching that but that's the truth anyhow amen that's right glory man gets on it still if the pillar fire comes in your soul how in the world are you going to sit still and then how are you going to condemn another bride member who disagrees with you about revelation 7 whether it's the foolish version or the wise version how you going to get off set and badmouth somebody like that you're not going to the bride doesn't persecute the bride the bride's facie with the bride the bride's patient tribulation the bride's patient in trials and in discomforts we must be patient we must really be born-again Amen hallelujah thank the Lord oh I'm glad to be washed in the blood of Jesus Christ thank the Lord 1st Corinthians 6:11 now he says you used to be used to be liars used to be drunkards used to do evil things sexually and such were some of you but you're wash your sanctified you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God amen what washed these saints how did this multitude of saints get up there they got washed from their sins praise God God change their heart they no longer one to lie they no longer wanted to cheat or steal they no longer wanted to say evil words or be bitter or arrogant they no longer it wouldn't be that they wanted to be clean and so they called out to God said God forgive me God wash me and guess what God will wash any humble heart praise God amen but you got to want it you got to want it praise the Lord you got a hunger for it and children I'll tell you this too you know cuz Haven Haven and caris came down at 4:43 in the morning on Tuesday morning and what was I doing Haven for forty three in the morning what was that doing yeah and I had Christian music on right I love that when the children find me you know I get up at 4:30 because I'm hungry for the Word of God see that hunger just didn't last the first few years I came in the message it's growing praise God you must hunger and thirst righteous we must get lazy and holiness or we must perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord now they scared me out that they scared the daylights out of me when they when they tapped me on the shoulder at 4:43 in the morning but I thought it was good because they got to see what his daddy knew at 4:30 in the morning reads his Bible praise God see this what is gonna wash you how are you gonna get wash you gotta really want to be washed praise God and daddys not braggin I'm just telling you that's that's how you act when you get washed because everyone I know acts like that now Simon and Cameron are a little different they'll stay up all night till like 4:00 a.m. but I'll get up at 4:30 so they stay up all night to get in the wash I go to bed early I get it a bit early in the morning to get washed but the main thing to do is get what I say men because those are the only ones that'll be in that great multitude those who are lost those who are justified sanctified by the spirit of our God and filled with the Holy Ghost those are the ones that are going to be there hallelujah titus 3:5 they going to just be true it's gonna be though church members who really wanted to be washed by the Holy Ghost in other words Jesus I really want to be clean I'm tired of not being clean I'm tired of treating people this way I want to be wash I want to be clean all right I'm gonna try to move a little faster here now this says we were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived hateful hating one another but after that the kindness of God our Savior appeared and not by works of righteousness we have done but according to His mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost washes you until you're regenerated in other words you have a new life in you you realize and I'm sure that the older Saints realize this you realize I did not act like this before but I am regenerated now I am revived now I have new life now I can recognize I didn't have this life and now I've got life I'm regenerated praise God I used to not act like this but now I act like this because I'm washed amen praise God this is what the washing is like it's like a regeneration it's like a renew life and that's the washing of the Holy Spirit praise God all right so what does Gentile people do there are great multitude there Abraham seed they come through great persecution and tribulation their comfort and all the tribulation there wash in the blood of the Lamb praise God but they've got to call out for it call upon the name of Lord wash me Jesus wash me alright last one number 15 verse 15 therefore are they before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in his temple let me go there and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them alright so let's look at the temple who had these multitude serve Him day and night in his temple Ravana already tells us the wife serves the husband right now I want to show you too that there is no temple in the New Jerusalem let's go to Revelation 21 you got your Bible verse 21 21 21 and the 12 gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass and I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the Sun neither the moon is shining it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof even the lambs the light the lambs the temple Jesus is our all-in-all praise God he's all of it hallelujah alright sixteen they show how no more neither thirst gnome anymore neither shall the Sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes amen church any memories any sad memories any people we love that were lost and he hurts from our past Jesus is gonna wipe all the tears away from our eyes he's gonna bring healing there's anything sad about anything to cry about anything to be disappointed about anything at all Jesus is gonna be the one he's so comforting he's gonna wipe away all this multitudes tears can you imagine that's gonna take a little while as in the church he's gonna wipe away all tears from their eyes let's stand to our feet here now as you stand I'm gonna give you two more reasons why I think this is the bride and brother Jose might might catch this one I think we talked about this one if this is the foolish virgin how can they be washing the blood of Jesus when there was no blood on the mercy seat during the tribulation there was no spirit of God the Bible said the Spirit of God will will be there until the antichrist comes down the Bible said he will only let until Satan be brought down to earth and then he the letteth will ascend there's no Spirit of God there for washing I don't know I'm just saying I'm just telling you what I what I what I can see here and number two are these Saints before the throne of God day and night when they are not part of the bride of Jesus Christ so how could the foolish virgin be there day and night always before the lamb when they're not even a part of his wife right they weren't a wise wife they were a foolish woman they were foolish woman not the wise woman does everybody see that by God's grace how can they be washing the blood when there's no blood or spirit for them and then how can they be always with the lamb when they're not the bride they're not born again they're not baptized with the Holy Ghost now Church could I be wrong on some of these things sure I could be wrong but I think the the important thing for tonight is to know that God is with you in all of your trials right and then if you want more of God and if you want to be a more perfect Christian you got to cry out for it praise God it's Malachi there come to the piano sir all right I think that's playing don't you church I think it's pretty plain there I try to just pull everything I could to finish chapter seven that's all I have on that as far as I know I may have other things but Hosea there's something else you have let me know I see six quotes against one quote now I'm not trying to say they're fighting each other but I see evidence six evidence over here verse 1 then we have those other questions how can the Foo Spurgeon be washing the blood when there's no blood for her it looks like to me that this is the bride of Jesus Christ and if that's the case then we have to go through much tribulation how many willing to go through the fire with Jesus I'm willing because he promised he'd be with me in all my tribulation he would comfort me from any trouble he promised into it let's see no no song I'll go with him through the garden praise God I'll go with him through the judgment right amen patience and patience experience experience he will [Music] I'll go with into the judgement judgement I'll go [Music] [Music] just keep playing that think about that church it struck me as I was preaching that brother Branham had to go through Great Tribulation to be one of those Saints and his tribulation was being talked bad about being rejected no more friends calling them like they used to just because he took a stand on God's Word God considers that when you're alone when you're not liked anymore when the people that used to care don't care anymore God considers that persecution doctors here that tribulation but we must not give up we must not compromise we must become perfectly holy we must perfect holiness in the fear of God now see how much we can give up and still have the same friends or have more faith no see how not see what we can compromise on but see what we must sacrifice in order to love Christ more Neal Church that's one way I know I still I'm serving Christ is because I still hunger to know his word I still thirst to know his word but if you don't feel that way please tonight make a choice to feel that way I want to be more holy well if you do you got to make some sacrifice to get there you must perfect holiness in the fear of God but he said he'd come for me in any trouble that I go through praise God let's just have word of Prayer every father you know the hearts of the people here nor let our church grow in holiness dear God let me grow in holiness then each person here hunger and thirst for more righteousness may each of us think I can live a more righteous life by God's grace God wants me to live closer to her God doesn't want me to play Church now doesn't want me to drift along tossed to and fro by every wind and wave God wants me to have a purpose God has taken me somewhere God's with me and I might have to separate myself and make sacrifices in order to fall more in love with him but I'm willing to do it help us Jesus help us to be willing to do anything Lord to draw closer to you to sacrifice any relationship or any financial gain Lord whatever might be in order to know new law and the power your resurrection thank you Lord Lord leather not just be a just a just a Wednesday night service Lord may this be a Time Lord these next few moments where we can say yes Lord perfect holiness in my life in the fear of God granted Lord Jesus and thank you for your promises Lord God may you be with us in any trouble when persecution arises we would see our God arise higher than our persecution arises thank you Lord for such great precious promises the Lord for all those who want to be in that great multitude Lord let then be washed by your blood here they they call upon your name Lord God all those who want to be wrong and white love palms in their hands God I imagine I'll be in the back of the crowd so far from the throne but Lord as long as I'm there dear God that's what I want to be I want a white robe Lord on this side dear God I want to be washed on this side I want to overcome tribulation and persecution on this side while there's blood on the mercy seat Haman read it Lord Jesus or we want to be those the Gentile off the to death how did they get there they asked John how are they gonna get there through much persecution they got there because they washed their robes in the blood of the lake but every service may we wash our hearts Lord God may we have pure hearts dear Lord may these sermons impact us Lord more and more [Music] as we saw tonight those closest to the throne are the ones who fall down and give the most worship nor I think that's how it is your Lord the ones that love you the most they're the ones that give you the most worship Lord God because he that's forgiven much loveth much oh god help us to see how much we've been forgiven Lord God that will love you more dear God oh you're so great Jesus you're so sweet Lord Jesus I'll just wash us fresh tonight Lord I don't know who wants to be born again or maybe feels like they're not more to get dear God but may each person Lord that they're not just hunger and thirst for righteousness those who say they got it may they hunger and thirst for more righteousness because we're not called to get lazy and holiness we're called to perfect holiness in the fear of God Lord for those who need a fresh a fresh amount of fear may you give them a fresh holy fear dear God new tonight before we leave this place dear Thank You Lord God [Music] our life is but a vapor Lord the years pass the months pass may we make sure that our robes are washed by calling upon the name of Jesus oh Jesus wash my rooms in your blood dear God amen hallelujah sanctify each person justify each person fillings person with the baptism with all needles granite Jesus hallelujah Jesus thank you Lord God be with each person tonight Lord and premieres for this weekend she be Terry Lord do we descent your presence more and more do you God thank you in Jesus Christ's name the church said thank the Lord sing commune with me praise God [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] with your eyes closed can just think of one thing in this in your heart say lord help me to be more holy in this area of my life maybe it's the words you say maybe it's your thought life just in your own heart say lord help me to be more holy this is one air I can be more holy all right I know that what I'm saying in my heart help me Jesus wash me Jesus call upon you Jesus Heavenly Father sir Abba we want to be perfected in holiness we want white robes Lord you don't want there to be any question where we're gonna be at there's a bit of a question where does the foolish virgin go but without a doubt the bride's roads would be washed white we know that's got to be her because she endured the great persecution she adored Great Tribulation during her life she got less and less popular less and less friends as she served just like your prophet just as your son Jesus did dear God that didn't make her compromise it just washed her refined her and made her more holy Lord let that happen for Bride of Christ fellowship that we might be made more hopefully one day we'll take those palms morning I don't know how must be eternal palms or something we'll be able to wave them at the Lamb who sits on his throne say blessing honor glory power Thanksgiving in mind to our God who sits on the throne or I imagine then Lord you'll spend some time and you'll wipe away these tears from my eyes little trials we went through that seemed so big to us you'll just heal those old memories and wipe away all the tears from our eyes Lord then the best part is we'll be ever by your side we'll never have to leave the side of our safe then Lord you'll lead us to fountains of living waters we won't be hungry anymore what we thirsty take care of all of our needs - what a promise what a promise thank you Lord Jesus so we just say tonight washed our robes white with your blood then it's overcome by the Word of God testimony our testimonies and the blood of Jesus Christ bless your people now in Jesus Christ Church said Amen god bless you Oh [Music]
