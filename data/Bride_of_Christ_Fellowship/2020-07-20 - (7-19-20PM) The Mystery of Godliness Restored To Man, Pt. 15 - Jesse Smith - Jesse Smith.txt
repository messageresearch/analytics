praise god thank you jesus i like to look at the statue perfect man a little more tonight by the grace of the lord continue going there just checking to see if i got any other uh text or anything like that so ii peter chapter one get back there by god's grace i told the young ones my children if they'd like to read any scriptures just have your bibles handy sometimes in the evening i like to have the children read a little bit so kind of keep them involved then we have a test two testimonies tonight so we're gonna let amens uh be on the live stream because simon wanted to hear it um and then simon will go back and watch this service later right and then uh we'll shut it off after that so sister doesn't have to feel you know don't be nervous or anything like that you know unless you want it you want it on the live stream oh yeah think about it okay appreciate that but don't feel any pressure i just want everybody to be happy and comfortable by god's grace so second peter chapter one i think by god's grace we're looking i'll be looking more at just the three works of grace tonight lord willing and continuing on some of the uh other scriptures i mentioned this morning i'm getting close to the end of this chapter i'm preaching through the chapter and uh i hope this has been a blessing to you praise god i know i've really enjoyed it i love going back over these things and i'm sure your testimony is the same the longer you serve god the more you're convinced that we believe the truth and that is that has been my testimony that's been my song that's been my experience with god that the the longer i serve christ the more his word is proven true to me so let's read the let's read verse 8. yeah let's read 8 and 9 and then i'll just read 10 myself so let's read eight and nine together because we're kind of looking at more of the uh just the the principles of the statute of perfect man here tonight but let's read eight and nine together one two three for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins now i'll read verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall how many want to fulfill that one if i do all these things i'll never fall i'll have little stumbles but i'll never fall away from salvation i'll never be lost i'll be saved by god's grace let's pray let's bow our heads for word of prayer heavenly father we sing out we cry out we lift your voice jesus we love you lord jesus hallelujah thank you great mighty awesome god for saving our souls oh god making yourself so real to us saving us lord from the miry clay father we love you jesus we realize it's all by grace it's all by your blood all by your faith and each one of your attributes lord of your holy spirit so i pray father you speak to us tonight lord bless your people as we look to your word strengthen us god for the journey ahead and minister to us tonight each and every soul in jesus christ's name the church said amen god bless you being seated praise god i'll try to set a timer here i want to read a few things uh i didn't get to this morning so in case you can or switch over to my phone so i want to just read a few quotes i didn't get to this morning i think they'll be a blessing i just want to uh share a few things and make some comments about it um some various quotes brother branham made in this one uh brother branham is speaking here in arizona and i'll just read it there's two systems at work just as there was jacob and esau one after the spirit went after the flesh what was it esau and jacob was fighting in the wombs of the mother even to the time they were born and so is the denominationals and the word fighting one against the other and we're not fighting the people right we're fighting their false doctrine right they had been since luther first brought the first reformation i hope that's simple enough you can understand it see these men if they pick up this and goes out with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you would i just want to lay this seed then hope they make it come to life so brother branham realizes he's in a uneducated spot right and if you listen to i shared that testimony with uh i didn't share with you i shared with uh brother stephen brother perry green says brother branham told him he said i wish they wouldn't put out my sermons with all the dot dot dots and all he said i wish they would edit all my sermons he said that's his testimony because he doesn't want to look like he has no brain that's what brother branham told perry green now that's not on tape but that's what peregrine's testimony so in other words brother brahm realized he was limited in his his education his ability um so he was hoping that men would come and find the message right find these revelations and then um put some grammar to him right and uh clean it up a little bit you know and just shorten it right and summarize it and i say synthesize it maybe um and so i just want to bring this out that uh that's what i felt like i did with my book and that's why i feel like the church age book is the same thing right it's it's these revelations but they're kind of just grammarized and they're kind of just packed in a little tighter uh by god's grace without you know stories and like me i say by god's grace a hundred times in a sermon right like brother jim he always makes that he always says is that by god's grace brother jesse and i'm like yeah he says i say that all the time by god's grace because you say it all the time i'm kind of rubbing off on him man i hope that's a good thing but i always say by god's grace but anyways i just wanted i don't know if amen had ever seen this so i wanted to bring this out and children too that there's nothing wrong with you know uh taking what brother mahm said and then packaging it you know in a in a different a set like you know what i mean just in other words writing a book about brother ham's teachings there's nothing wrong with that like he was hoping these brothers could do it you know he's talking about jacob and esau he's talking about the promised seed versus denomination and he just wished somebody could bundle that up and and present it in a way that more people could receive it and so that's what he said he said that now i know brothers have taken this quote and they've totally twisted it and they brought their own false doctrines like polygamy right like perugia like we don't need no holy spirit we don't need to shout and pray and fast and they say he's already here we don't need that and that's nonsense uh and then the seven thunders movement right um you know the seven thunders movement made that uh they made that the seven thunders instead of what brother bam said it was brother man said it was the revelation of the seven seals well the seven thunders movement made faith a thunder and it made all those things thunders and they they basically tried to predict the rapture by the by the time when their founder would preach those that's what they were trying to do uh and they were saying you know our age is broadly kindness so we really need brotherly kindness and they were trying to predict the rapture through those um so you know we have to balance this quote out and not take it too far but i wanted to show that to you that brother branham realized this he was laying the seed and then he was hoping the brothers after him uh could make more sense in other words put a little grammar to it okay now things that are to be brother ram says this is one you're familiar with i'm very thankful for these open doors that i had to go into the inspiration it's given to young men like your pastor here that's caused them as i'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and know that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the lord if he doesn't come in my generation which i'm hoping to see him i look daily for my watch keeping myself prepared for that hour see so uh just another encouraging quote there that that brother branham was looking he realized i may not live to see him but i'm trusting that the brothers after me will be able to take the same message right and and bring it to the people uh and preach god's word and stay with it to get the people ready for the coming of the lord now here's one i want to share too the teacher but so my ministry's in teaching i believe so brother man says teaching is a special man he sits back under the anointing of the spirit and is able to take the words and put them together by the holy spirit that the pastor evangelists either one could not compare with him and then we find out the apostle's a special man he's a setter in order he's a man that's sent from god to set the things in order so i just want to make sure i say that you know there's people that don't believe in teaching they say oh all we need is preaching we don't need teaching and i admit there's been many false teachers come through the message no doubt about it but there's there has to be special men out there that can sit back under the anointing and bring out the scriptures and put them together that it brings victory to people there has to be somebody out there that has to do that i think the church has been preached now look at this quote look at this how come we never hear this one right you know i've never heard this one preached i think the church has been preached to death the thing it needs now is to come back to teaching and get in on the foundation so you'll know how to build yourself up in christ amen now church just to be fair there are quotes on the other side that say we have too much teaching right see so see brother brown would look at different churches he looked at different situations some needed more teaching some needed more preaching praise god some needed revival some needed correction you know so we got to be careful to balance out all the quotes with the word of god praise god so uh i just want to bring some of these out just to kind of uh share with you now bro man says teaching's a little treacherous because i've been teaching on that's what um the book is about it's about teaching the word of god the mysteries of god he says uh yeah so he said i want to preach at this time i think of a complete understanding positioning of what we are in christ jesus yeah he's preaching adoption now sometimes i think preaching is a wonderful thing but i believe sometimes brother be that teaching goes beyond that especially to the church so again brother brahms emphasizing just preaching like speak god's word and all these that's all good things that's all we all need that but he said teaching he says uh goes beyond that the preaching catches the sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are praise god so it's good to just preach that preaching you know supposed to convict us of sin but teaching is supposed to show you how to grow closer to christ amen amen so see there is a special place for teaching and uh each one you know teacher teacher pastor evangelist all those things uh and so i believe that my testimonies i believe i have multiple gifts i believe i have a gift to pastor i believe i have a gift to evangelize uh at times to teach as well i know my main focus is pastoring but if paul could be a prophet apostle pastor teacher to the gentiles if he can have multiple gifts we can have multiple gifts as well brother braham no doubt had all five gifts we can see it clearly in his life now next now here's one thing i want to add too with the stature perfect man or any mystery we have to be careful not to put a period in other words we can't be dogmatic and organized and become a denomination that's why a lot of people left the message and they follow believe the sign or these other guys because some of the churches they went to have denominated in fact some of their testimonies the reason they left the churches was because the leaders allowed sin to happen like child abuse in the churches and they didn't report it see they are so denominated that they allow sin to come into the church now that's wicked that's from hell right so see we have to be very careful just because our message is greater than denomination doesn't mean that we should denominate but brother adam says always be open to more revelation praise god amen now the original the revelation the new revelation we get won't take away from what we've already heard it will only add more to it okay but sincerely men do receive god and believe him if they would just then they pull themselves off saying that we got this and that's all there is to it see i never want to say there uh i have every revelation on the godhead i don't ever want to say that i have every revelation on the stretch perfect man right every revelation on the baptism holy ghost i never want to say that he says because that's when you denominate they separate themselves they won't take no new revelation they organize it this is it this is our doctrine end with the period he says if you'd have a denomination that'll end up and your doctrine with a comma we believe this plus as much as god will show us then that's all right i'll go for that but never with the period because god is god and time is moving on amen hallelujah see we got to be open to that now like i said a new revelation will never take away from previous revelation now let me say this a new revelation may correct some of your wrong thinking yeah yes right that's that's the kind of revelation i want new revelation oh my it's unveiled to me oh i realized where i had it wrong about the latter rain right we were talking about that i realized i may have it wrong about the rapture i may have this room thank god for revelation amen but see church automatically if we put a period and we think we got everything we got the wrong spirit already and that's when a lot of messed churches happen but the ram says how many know the church age but you cannot escape the cycle of revival and death how do you know what i'm talking about the ephesian church age he said you've left your first love brother said that this cycle never fails you start hot but then you got you go lukewarm and he says if not if you're not careful you'll go lukewarm and then you'll die and that's what happens every denomination now church the same things happen in the message praise god we have to but we have to keep ourselves when we hit that bachelor slim spot we got to come back to our first love amen we have to reverse the curse right we have to reverse the cycle how many believe that amen if you've been serving god long enough you know that's right you've got to get back to your first love which is doing your first works if not you'll denominate in your walk with the lord and you'll go into spiritual death and nobody can correct you see oh i'm just separating to myself i've got i know everything about it that's the wrong spirit it has to be the right spirit okay now that's the quotes i want to show there i'm going to pop another one here okay i want to leave that up there just for a little bit because now i want to go through here now got your bibles ready my children you got your bibles right anybody else want to read anybody got their bibles ready let's go through a few scriptures now since i'm i kind of in the book i kind of went on charity and then i i saved charity for the next the next chapter was christ in you the hope of glory so i saved most of the teaching on that for later um oh yeah i had a real quick question i'm gonna ask you a question um it's not gonna offend me if you say no okay does anybody want to go through all those scriptures that i showed earlier this morning about how god is love god is spirit raise your hand does anybody want me to go through those anybody okay i appreciate it okay yeah we can go through yeah that's fine i know the children need them too so i want to give that an opportunity uh to go through those but i got as you can see i got seven other things i like to preach on tonight so i got this chapter is over 60 pages single spaced it's 63 pages long his brother johnny once you start getting the word it just starts opening up brother branham was right brother and you know this i'm not calling you out or anything you know but ram said when you get the revelation it ties the whole bible together church i am an absolute witness of that when god took those seals off the whole bible fits together now you could you just preach forever and i don't want to do that tonight and it set the timer so let me set the timer 30 more minutes okay three more minutes all right so yeah let's go back i appreciate that if anyone needs to go through those i want to go through those um and you can see it it's beautiful i think it's just a i just came up with that this morning i should say i came up with it the holy spirit came up with it yeah here's what i was talking about now this is so beautiful to me because it takes away all the guests work out of it well is love the same as the holy ghost is the new birth the same as all this it's all the same thing praise god because if you put these scriptures together they're not multiple things they're the same thing all right so uh children get your bibles ready i'm calling on my oldest lydia you're always the first one first john 4 8 lydia malachi get first corinthians 13 but go to verse 3 buddy go to verse 3. and then acacia can you read too all right acacia john 4 24. okay lady go ahead man all right god is love amen i think we heard a preacher recently say god just doesn't have love for you god is love he is love one of the brothers said that recently i can't remember who it was something along those lines so see god is love now god is loving but and he's kind and he loves us but he actually is the spirit of love okay maokai first corinthians 13 3. can you read that buddy okay i'm sorry that's not the one i wanted to read i wanted you to read uh verse where's the one that says yeah verse eight sorry buddy that's one amen so look charity never fails love never fails now you and i we fail but god never fails this has to be charity has to be speaking of god because god is love see it has to be another good one oh yeah this is a good one too verse six charity rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth and what did jesus say the holy spirit is the spirit of truth amen see the holy spirit will always be happy in truth it always anoint you to do what's true praise god amen glory all right keisha john 4 24. amen god is a spirit a spirit so god is the holy spirit oh yeah there's another good scripture peter said be holy for i am holy so god said i am holy and jesus said god is a spirit he must be the holy spirit holy spirit he's holy and god jesus said god is a spirit okay um ephesians 1 13 sister wendy can you get that ephesians 1 13. sister huh could you get um well we read that one this morning right yeah i read that one this morning cereal can you get acts 1 5 please thank you i love seeing that bible all highlighted like that that reminds me of mine not everybody likes to do that but i sure like to color mine up praise god cover it with different highlighters so do i need if you can read that in whom he also trusts after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in him also after that amen sealed with that holy spirit of promise now we can almost all memorize this one right grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption right glory so you're with the seal of the holy spirit so the holy spirit's a seal all right we read that one jesus said the uh the holy ghost could not be given until jesus was glorified all right sister who can you read acts 1 5 for john truly baptized with water and ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days amen that's beautiful i i love pointing that one out who preached the baptism the holy ghost first christ amen jesus preaches it right there he said you shall be baptized with the holy ghost so a lot of churches don't like to talk about the baptism they just say i invited jesus in my heart but you need more than that praise god that means you just invited him into your mind you need a baptism praise god you need your soul immersed in god's spirit praise god where you hate sin where you hate iniquity but you rejoice in the truth amen amen now we read that one this morning the love of god hallelujah is shed abroad in your hearts by the holy ghost so how does love god's love get in your heart by the holy ghost so see it just comes off full circle can everybody see that oh i love that beautiful that's what i was hoping to show by the help of the holy spirit you can start here and it's just like a it's like a circle it just goes right back to itself now let's do the other one too because this is really good here um to show christ in you so uh lydia first one malachi second one acacia third one wendy why don't we do the fourth one and then can you do that one too okay she's not here okay i'll do that one john 14 i actually want to read 16 and 17. yeah these are beautiful scriptures praise god 14 okay 16 17. okay thank the lord praise god okay uh lydia go ahead secretions 13 5 i'm sorry that too small sorry about that that's a good one about examining yourself you see that that is scriptural we can take inventory how many believe that we should be able to look at that statue of man see where am i where am i doing well by your grace lord but where do i need strength where do i need help amen now church a reprobate is someone who's who's lost uh like judas right he was reprobate uh so let me say this a foolish virgin they have the spirit of christ in them up here but they they don't have it here because they're not sealed by the day uh by the holy spirit to the day of their redemption so see jesus christ is in them in their minds but they got to let it go a little bit deeper praise god got to go deeper in the love of god that's right okay malachi colossians 1 27 so jesus christ is in you now christ is in you amen praise god so are those two different no one in the same it's the holy spirit right it's the spirit of christ john 14 16 now here it is beautiful jesus calls the holy spirit the comforter and the spirit of truth and then he says i too in verse 18. glory and i will pray the father that he shall give you another comforter there's comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth so the comforter is now the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth them not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelt with you and shall be in you and then verse 18. now the holy spirit starts speaking through jesus's flesh and said i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you oh that's beautiful praise god amen brother said it was quite a paradox there was times jesus would speak and then there was flesh and then there was times god would speak hallelujah the bible said never spake a man like this man hallelujah he said before abraham was i am hallelujah uh is that sister when he's not yours thank you uh really not that yeah the temple of god then that the spirit of god dwells in you amen praise god the spirit god dwells in you that's that key word those two key words rather in you in you see it's the same thing the spirit of god spirit of truth spirit of jesus christ and uh who'd i say on that last one oh sisterhood can you read that of course what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which we have of god and we are not amen thank you praise god so it isn't that great to see all those scriptures i love seeing all those placed together because you'll you church you and i will find the bible's so amazing 66 books written over the course of almost 2000 years by i think there was over what 20 or 30 authors and none of them ever contradicted the other one now that's a divine book right there praise god and so see god has different synonyms you know jesus christ christ in you the comforter all these different things but it's all speaking of the one and same thing jesus christ spirit living in our souls glory all right so um that's good that's real good right there okay so let's is that held by god's grace is that helpful beautiful beautiful i love that i think i think before i publish the book lord willing if god tarries and if he gives me strength to do it i want to put that in there i want to make a chart of that and show how they're all synonyms and then get the scripture for it because it just takes all the guesswork out of it praise god okay let's go back to this one now the next section was just showing yeah i'm taking a picture of my master i try to make my wife laugh you know i really don't like wearing those things what can you do give the caesar what caesars okay so this is a figure showing how uh god always has three works right three works of grace and faith is the first work and then virtue up to broadly kindness is the second work and then the third work is love or charity the baptism of the holy ghost i believe that i believe that's the right way to understand it now let's uh show a few scriptures now let me say this the word work a lot of people don't like works of grace because they don't like the word work but church when you look at the bible the bible does use the word work and here's the thing it's not our works it's god working through us or another way the bible puts it is god working with us praise god because god can't do it alone like brother man said he can't push you through a pipe and say you did it he's got to have your will praise god amen he's got to have your desire your surrender praise god and then he can move by that then he can lead us and guide us into all truth so i want to i want to go through the scriptures that teach that so the first thing i'm going to read actually i'm going to read myself is romans 2 4 the goodness of god leads you to repentance i was asking sister uh sarah afterwards what age she got baptized eight years old you imagine that eight that's awesome what a testimony and that that repentance there when she was eight has has guided her to be justified sanctified and then filled with the holy ghost i think she said when she was 18 or 19 she got filled with the holy spirit isn't that beautiful i got baptized at 16 i really wanted to do it but then i as soon as i got in the car i turned on my rock and roll music it was over my repentance was over right there because i just went right back to that same old lifestyle but then after i uh uh became a christian i wasn't even baptized because i didn't even know about it at 19 and then simon brought me the word i got baptized and the man said jesus only and i thought oh i thought brother he was a oneness church up there in actor i said brother in my heart i thought so i just called simon i said simon tell brother brooks i need to be baptized the name of the lord jesus christ so i've been baptized three times by god's grace but it's awesome to see like our sister raising it and with the sincerity and seeing the sincerity in her family that that baptism at eight years old that can hold you that can be a typos praise god amen even to the devil when no matter when he comes is you could say no i was sincere i got baptized at eight years old i think some of my children are baptized at five if i'm not mistaken and i trust by god's grace that the sincere i trust they were sincere by the grace of the lord amen amen harris did you get baptized at 500 oh bless your heart praise god amen she had a good testimony because she we were up here praying for souls and she was crying in the nursery at the same time wanting to be baptized that was a great testimony praying for souls god save souls and then god gave us a soul [Laughter] i thank the lord god is merciful praise god he's gracious so uh romans 2 4 or despises thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering and knoweth and i'm sorry and not knowing that the goodness of god leads lead to repentance so before someone will turn from their evil life god will show them how good he is and at that moment the believer says god you are so good i love you i'm going to turn from my sinful ways and i'm going to follow your paths that's right the very first reason you want to be a christian is because of how good god is and then when you see how good god is then uh the scripture says after that you love god and then love causes your faith to work so love produces faith and faith works praise god because we went over that a few months or a few weeks ago that's galatians 5 6 faith works by love so you you see how good god is you fall in love with him you love him now you have faith in him and then you work for him praise god now let's go to i want to make sure i hit this scripture um lydia mark 16 the last two verses malachi first corinthians 15 10. is he in here no he's not here okay first corinthians 15 10. see they don't like that word work oh brother jesse you're putting works in there i've had people tell me that three works you're working for salvation no it's christ working in me praise god it's christ working with me praise god so lydia if you could get that go ahead amen amen so they they repent you know uh after jesus was crucified they all scattered they come back they repent jesus meets them he leaves and after that he works with them praise god oh that's my prayer every time i preach my name i say god work with me just work humble me right brother bank humble me lord work with me so that i can be a blessing to your people you know in every life right in our family life in our school life our work life we just want to we want to work with the lord praise god because brother baby says he can't work without you he needs your hands he needs your feet praise god he needs your voice he needs your eyes he needs your words so see he's working with us by the grace of the lord amen first corinthians 15 10 says beautiful scripture but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they are yet not i but the grace of god which was with me now notice that notice that the grace was with him and this grace caused him to work harder than peter can you imagine that harder than james harder than john the grace of god that was with paul remember why did he why did he love grace because christ had forgiven him for his awful sins you know standing there and holding the the the the coats of stephen's killers you know and and then breaking into christians homes and dragging them off to prison paul says because of god's grace it caused me i kept i kept remembering where i came from and it caused me to want to work more for jesus oh may god anoint us with that kind of labor praise god that's not me laboring but it's god's grace look what god has done in my life what more can i do than just serve and praise god out of my appreciation right work sir is what we do out of appreciation for god amen so see uh let's let's just keep that in our hearts that when we say three works of grace we're talking about us surrendering to the holy spirit and god working through our lives in other words surrendering say god increase my knowledge god increase help me work through me so that i can be temperate work through me that i can be more patient with the pastor right right now you have more kindness towards me even when i do you're wrong or if i mistreat somebody because that's what we are we're a family right and we need we need to have grace and kindness for each other amen even when especially when we fall short because it's easy to love everybody loves you jesus said so so god let me have that lord let your grace be with me that i can manifest your love to my church family brotherly kindness so see it's god grace is god's unmerited favor you don't deserve it but yet its grace must always be your motivation right how many believe that you're always motivated by god's grace okay now just for three works a man's birth water breaks bloody show breath of life man spiritual birth justification signification baptism holy ghost israel's exodus leaving egypt wilderness promised land tabernacles cleansing outer court holy place holies of holies earth's cleansing noah's flood jesus blood the fervent heat i like this one ezekiel's prophecy new heart new spirit god's spirit let's read that one ezekiel 36 26 and 27 it's been a while since i read that and i thought i was just encouraging ezekiel 36 26-27 now while i'm there malachi can you get mark 428 buddy you get mark 428 malcolm this last one was a fresh revelation i think i preached that recently kind of just off the off the cuff kind of now i'm going to read ezekiel 36 26. this is beautiful now ezekiel this was preached according to uh usher's history 587 bc so almost 600 years before christ this was preached and remember ezekiel was one prophesying them in babylon ezekiel wasn't in jerusalem right jeremiah was in jerusalem ezekiel was prophesying around the same time in babylon to the the jews in babylon remember he got carried by the vision by his hair he got carried back to jerusalem to see all the idols in the temple which was a type of our day right you can see all the idolatry in the house of god and judgment begins in the house of god but he got carried back the river chabar i believe it was not mistaken he says a new heart also will i give you amen and a new spirit will i put within you now take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you a heart of flesh amen amen remember amen i told you you're watching my testimony remember brother amen was so nice he came to record my testimony with me and i'm almost done i got maybe about halfway to go but brother sister i was so hardhearted toward god but when i was driving in cam's car and singing i just started hearing those songs one of these days i'm going to see the nails that uh i'm seeing sorry see the hands that took the nails from me i felt sister wendy my heart of stone i felt it breaking into pieces and and then i wanted to drive his car more brother bang so i can listen to more of that christian music see he was breaking my heart of stone he was breaking it into pieces until it became a heart of flesh praise god god used music to do that to show me his goodness amen hallelujah one day i want to see the hands that took the nails for you the man that died for me i want to see him and i want to see him and i wanted to accept me praise god music god used music to show me his goodness now that group that group isn't even a message group brother bank but god use them amen see how god can use a can i say like this god can use a penny right silver dollar nickel quarter aren't you glad guy can use all those denominations other denominations coin denominations right i think probably those people probably came out as nominations but see thank god that we got a new a new heart praise god that's what it is oh and then new spirit of course sanctification verse 27 and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them praise god see when you yield when you yield your your heart and then your mind and then jesus is the one working through you when you're born again he's causing me to say with the word amen because i invited him in and he's sealed in my soul now he's he's causing me to keep the commands of god right your flesh doesn't always want to come to church your flesh doesn't want to always worship and sing but what is it it's the holy spirit causing you to raise your hands and sing out and cry out and lift the name of the lord jesus high above everything else it's god causing you to keep the commands hallelujah oh that's so beautiful he's causing me to stay with the word he's keeping me praise god now i don't want to lose that my phone went to sleep okay there we go all right okay so you can see it everybody can see it now how can people deny this switch because they don't they just don't want it they don't want to believe it right they just don't want to remember the bible said there'll be no excuses on that day no but no excuse well it was too deep for me no this ain't deep this is very simple right everybody can see there's three stages to all these things the maokai read that mark 4 28 did i tell you 29 if i did i'm sorry mark 4 28. amen now this is beautiful jesus christ himself preaches there's three works of grace there's three stages to a little christian plant growing up a little christian wheat plant praise god jesus christ teaches this there's the blade first then the ear and then the full corn praise god now i put that in as far as the book i made a separate section of that that shows that's the three works of grace and i like what verse 27 says the bible said the man don't know how it grew up praise god that's what paul said paul says i planted apollos water but god gave the increase amen amen see no man can cause your own spiritual increase i remember telling the story about wendy i want to grow i want to grow i want to grow so see in other words you cannot add the character to yourself you've got to stay rooted and grounded in christ and in god's season he'll make you grow praise god he'll cause you to grow you must put your confidence in the growing process just like a farmer does your your job and my job is accept the promise of god and then water that seed with prayer praise and thanksgiving and then church will see the blade right the uh then the ear the blade of justification uh the ear of virtue knowledge temperance patience godness brother kindness and lastly the baptism holy ghost the full corn because the bible says he's made everything beautiful in his time amen oh i love that when i saw that last year by amen i said praise the lord jesus christ preached the three works of grace amen amen hallelujah let's just say brother branham this is god almighty amen he preached it through ezekiel he brings it through israel he preached it through his son jesus christ he preaches through the seven church age messenger and he's preaching it through his bride today amen i'm glad i'm one of them praise god i didn't mean to get this so excited praise god but that's true the lord jesus christ preached this three steps to becoming a real wheat plant for god hallelujah and this is a fresh one jesus said i'm the way the truth sanctify them through thy truth and the life oh it isn't that beautiful isn't it just beautiful church my i said the longer we go on the more blessings we see in god's word the more revelation sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth okay got five minutes here let me look at my which one can i get done in five minutes to be a blessing to god's people praise god has this been okay all right i hope it's been okay by the grace of the lord um well i got five minutes let's well let me take a vote i'll do another vote i'll give you two choices do you want to see some foolish version quotes that they're saved because i thought i could get that done in five minutes or do you want to see the significance of the number eight in the bible so let's vote take a second there think about it okay you had a second all right so who like do the foolish virgin quotes one two three four five five okay good five how many would like to do the significance of number eight one two three four okay we'll do foolish virgin quotes praise the lord it was a close one too my and i didn't vote in that one i should have voted no it's okay um i want to pull it up i think it'd be really good to see those like i said i preached this back in 2016. and again church i i you know i i don't like disagreeing with a great man like perry greene wonderful godly man don't get me wrong my ministry probably is if brother branham was a pebble on the beach what am i with man i'm like a cloud of dust or something like that what else what lower thing can you get a pebble on the beach uh that's okay i just want to show you that i really believe the foolish virgin is saved by the blood i believe that now they don't have the full effects of it they're like a blade right there like a blade they never really got to the uh the stalk and they never got to the full corn but at least they have some life in christ enough to be foolish virgin all right so um i got my slides here by number yeah i'm only 24. so this is uh 61. where the five virgins lost he said the five versions were not lost i don't you know i don't i wish brother green was here i could talk to him about some of these and and understand because you know the reason i preached this was because brother loris was sat under brother greene and but brother laura said the foolish virgin he didn't believe they were saved i said that's okay brother i said let me preach it sometime and then when i preach it i was loris i was gonna plan on talking to him and caring afterwards but then the snow storm came and they didn't get to hear i hope they live streamed it by god's grace but we never actually talked about it after that but uh there it is uh they were not lost there's one now there's a lot of reading in there but i'll skip that one um go to 26. no they were not lost but they never will be in the bride they were coming the second resurrection never being the bride now look george this is four years before the church age book four years so like some people think the church age book you know brother man just threw that in all the you know maybe maybe gamalia maybe nicodemus will be saved brother and believe this for years it wasn't just thrown in at the last minute by lee vale brother brandon had that in there praise god because he teached it the foolish virgin is going to be saved amen he said to be judged according to the way they treated the light that they received now that part will be up to christ they were not lost though look he says it three times not lost not lost not lost they're saved okay now you know this they're saved they ask him again in 61. uh brother and what happens to the people that are considered a sleeping virgin when they're judged at the judgment well the sleeping virgin will be saved of course i just don't know i wish i wish these brothers were here i could talk to them i don't know why people think the foolish burden is not safe well i do know there's a couple quotes that people uh they maybe they take the wrong way she'll be saved at the judgment she'll never be in the bride but she saved a group of people that will come in the judgment that will not be included in the bride but as long as they're virgins they're before god see they are to be saved he said they'll be the sheep on his right side and the unsaved will be the goats on his left at the great white throne judgment and the church said amen okay that's the scripture 62. i didn't have any quotes on it but brother man says in the seventh seal he said she comes up purged with white robes on anybody that knows the bible knows that white robes is the righteousness of jesus christ and the man says it's eternal life so let me do one more minute brother bishop how perfect how beautiful that is he was perfect it's scripturally right okay we also find out the sixth seal now being open it was the threefold purpose now here was the purpose the first thing was that the sleeping versions had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message oh i'm so glad i didn't reject it praise god i've received it amen this she was done in the tribulation we see they wind up over here in revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th chapter there that she had been purged and she'd been given her robes now she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that they didn't have the opportunity maybe look church there it is maybe but remember there's no excuses at the white throne judgment the bible says the eyes lord brother bank they go around the earth searching for anyone that will worship god in other words anybody that's hungry and thirsty for righteous god will manifest himself to him he's obligated he has to he said that's what the seven spirits are they're lamps before the lord and then the eyes of the lord run to and fro around the whole earth seeking who will worship the lord so there'll be no excuses but remember that's a maybe gotta be careful those maybes those mites perhaps like brother man said with joseph he said i hope he said that's my prayer anyhow that he's a prophet he never said he was thus saith the lord he said that's my prayer anyhow okay or in some way that they are blinded by these false prophets they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart and god knows their heart and hear their purge during this time aren't you glad god knows your heart amen now i'm skipping ahead and remember jesus said when the sleeping version the one that tried to live a good life within herself they was virgin but they didn't have any oil this version arises you know in the last day in the judgment the white throne judgment but not the bride okay 64. questions and answers like i said i'm going to skip some of these for time's sake brother branham said the bride to the gentile brides in heaven the sleeping virgin the gentile version is not saved during that time she's already been saved okay but has been rejected in the bride so the bullish virgin is definitely saved they're not going to be saved in the rapture because they didn't get the holy ghost they turned it down they rejected it but they are saved eternally he says it later they're eternally saved she only goes to the tribulation period for the time of purification because she's rejected christ the word for her purification she's not saved during that time she's saved now from eternal death so the foolish version those catholic methodists presbyterian baptists say this message they they're saved now even if they know the holy ghost if they believe and they're living a virgin life to god they're saved now because their names on the book of life now here's the two most misunderstood quotes later in the same sermon the prophet said the nominal believers are saved by fire okay yeah after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgin be saved or will it be lost no see everything will be finished for the gentile church so this is the quote a lot of people misunderstand but just look later will the foolish virgin be saved no whatever happens happens now after that time she's in the state now she have to go through the tribulation period but that brother talking about saved from the tribulation now i'm going to skip that there's never been a time in history where that the nominal church has become so hungry to find the baptism holy ghost uh yeah here i'm trying to hurry and look what brother bam says i'm trying to hurry i ought to do this i have to lay these back because there's a place you could stay on it for an hour just to tear it down i'll stop look the people are wanting to say that thinking that the church is going to hit the tribulation it won't it can't because it's already redeemed that's the bride but now the church here it is the church the nominal believers like lot he's going through the tribulation period see and be saved as it were by fire this is the same quote i'm sorry the same sermon but man said the foolish version won't be saved he's talking about save from destruction right save from death he said but they're already saved as it were by fire they're already saved the church the lukewarm that anything outside the elected bride will go through the tribulation period they will not raise in the first resurrection and here's what he says he'll separate the sheep from the goats say to the goats and the part and the sheep's come ye blessed in my father so here brother ram says the foolish virgins will hear jesus say that come ye blessed of my father the foolish virgins are blessed aren't you glad anyone that serves god sincerely are blessed amen they don't got to go to our church they don't got to believe what we believe all the way but they got to respect god they got to live true to the word and if they do that god blesses them amen our god is so great he's so faithful so merciful okay so this is one where uh it sounds like brother graham saying the foolish virgin takes the mark of the beast so this yeah this is this stumbles a little bit of people but remember he'd already said in that year that they were saved yeah he said mark of the beast yes indeed so let's give brother bram some grace right he was still working on his doctrine let's look at the whole picture of the word and anybody can see that the bullish virgin is saved right they're the sheep at the great white throne judgment in matthew 25 by scripture okay so the foolish version is eternally saved but not saved from the tribulation period okay so i appreciate that i tried to um shorten that as best as i could let's see how many portions i had there's more quotes from 64. if you want them i can email you this the church age book is full of it okay that's it all right now let's for stretching purposes let's stand to our feet before brother amen gives us testimony here and musicians musicians why don't you come and we'll sing a song here then my brother can give his testimony how many would say lord work through me and help me to grow as a wheat plant praise god that's my prayer i want god to work through me again i appreciate that email you know from that woman who read the book and everything that's that's what i want to see i want to see my life help other people i want to see it help people in the home church and people abroad and anyone that can be in the hearing of our preaching and our writing and our ministries that will help people we'll help them know jesus christ so let me pray church you pray for one another i'll pray for you god help us to grow and we'll work with the lord we'll give him our desires we'll give him our will we'll give him our time we'll give him our energy and he can work through us heavenly father we love you tonight lord god i'm trying to hurry lord so forgive me if i trust your people received it lord thank you for this opportunity to be in your house [Music] more than you saw the hands of a raise or the hearts that were raised [Music] thank you for sending your water our god holy spirit [Music] other people can look at our lives or encourage us in other ways [Music] let us [Music] if you remember your amazing grace i sought the lord and he answered me and delivered me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there'll never be [Music] [Applause] this poor man cry and the lord hurt me and save me [Music] he will [Music] the lord with me [Music] together with me [Music] forever [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] glorified [Music] let us [Applause] [Music] every day [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] is [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] the lord god bless you won't take too long yeah so uh my wife and i we were driving up to minnesota last week and uh we're like okay um darling why don't you give your testimony i'll listen to it i'm like and then we i see what ended up saying her testimony and it went almost to two hours long so so we ran over two hours we're like okay at least we got two hours of driving done you know so and she wasn't done yet so i'm like okay maybe you'll keep it to 20 minutes and we'll do 20 minutes um okay um the first time i ever encountered the lord was actually in fifth grade and uh this is when uh i used to live in wisconsin and my dad became a pastor and we went down to assemblies that got church so we belong to that church and he was a pastor there and uh the first time i encountered the lord was when we were walking like in that like it was like a hallway like this we were walking this hallway and then i heard some christian music playing and it was a song called at the cross i find life at the cross you suffered and died for me and that's the first time i ever felt the presence of god before and all i could see was a vision of a heavenly dove coming and flying down like how i fell on jesus i'm like oh wow and at that moment when i was fifth well in fifth grade i told myself i want to grow up and be a godly man that's what i told myself because i just love the presence of god i'm like what is this i never felt god like this before so um so we went to um you know we had the bible bible school and the first bible verse ivan rice was uh john b16 you know for god's love the world i guess one only son and uh that was such a blessing in my heart so in middle school uh they had this big wait maybe like a someone kind of like a revival at their at the assemblies of god church and that was the the time i decided to um at that time it was like you know accept jesus into your heart so at age i went and i wanted to accept jesus into my heart you know and all they did was give me a bag with some some pieces of paper in it that had like oh this is how you're saved and you know so the the pastor was supposed to come up and like you know talk to everyone who got who accepted christ in the heart but he didn't talk to me so but then we were all in this little group but they just gave us like this bag and okay you're christian now here you go so i'm like okay so i i grew up a christian like that so um so in high school my parents went and they got divorced and this um my parents uh my dad actually stopped going to church because he got kicked out because he didn't like what he was preaching so he got kicked out my dad didn't want to go to church anymore so that he took us to one church a cma church christian missionary alliance they believe in um the teachings of um what's his name billy graham they believe they're under his teaching so they believe what he preaches so um we went to that church only one time and then my parents didn't want to go church no more and my sisters didn't want to go church anymore but i wanted to go to church so um i would actually walk to church this is in high school i would actually walk to church every single time they had service friday nights sunday nights even when it was raining even when it was snowing outside even if the weather was terrible i just wanted to go to church because i just loved being with people that love god that's that was just my desire and um yeah i i i went to church and that's when in high school was when i started learning how to play music um yeah i started learning to play i taught myself uh the piano and the guitar by myself and you know because we didn't have any teachers to teach us so i taught myself all these instruments and i was in choir in school too so every time every year they always sing the same song over and over the battle him of the republic like i always got the boring part because it was the the baseline because i was i had a little voice of my teacher jose i gotta sing those songs but then i'm glad we come to church here i can sing the melody you know battlefield republic um okay so so after high school um my parent my dad got remarried and we moved down to akron ohio and uh i went to i decided to go to uh bible college was the school falls down in georgia and they made me sign this um what's it called yes pretty much a doctorate thing you uh say i believe this this i'm like oh okay i didn't know any better i did that and i went to uh the school there and boy did i learn a lot of weird things over there it's they say they're a christian college but it doesn't really feel christian like let's just say that way like we had uh we went to their um we call it chapel every like tuesday and thursday we went to a different church on sunday and we did that every week and then they always preach and yeah it wasn't it didn't feel like uh god was there you know it was just oh we all believe in god but the god wasn't there you know so um after i only went to one semester and then i decided to drop out of college and i came and i moved on i was in akron and from there i think i spent 2011 2014 three years working and i was not satisfied with my life i did not like the way life was going i'm like is this all life has to offer is this what my purpose on earth is just to work and just to go do this and this and 2014 was the time i went to my room and i prayed and i'm like god i know you're real but where are you where is the god of abraham where's the god of isaac where's the god of jacob why aren't you here with the church why aren't you here how come i don't see you where's you said you would heal and do miracles but where is all this and that was the same year actually met pastor jesse so god answered that prayer and uh so how i met pastor jesse was 2014 i prayed that prayer and then i um my wife's brother gu they said there was a testimony meeting pastor jesse was hosting we didn't go to that but we went after they were done because we were doing some other things so and as soon as i met pastor jesse oh man i just knew that man had god i knew that he had jesus christ something real i mean just the way he talked and the way he presented himself i'm like this man has god i know he's a christian and i'm gonna follow this man no matter what so um i think we got contact with i got in contact with pastor jesse and uh we decided to um this is the time that we decided to um talk a bit about you know why baptism and pastor jesse did baptize me the correct way and um this is pretty interesting so um so when i was back in my old church the cma church it's like a few miles down this this real right here um i was actually you know how uh the cma chairs is they have like offices like president vice president stuff like that i was supposedly the their vice president of the the youth thing so i'm like okay this then pastor jesse he has god you know what and our big theme over the big theme they had this year that year was um outreaching and go to different churches so i'm like okay let's take that literally let's go to pastor jesse's church so i took the whole entire youth we took the entire youth and we took everyone that we could and we went down to second service and pastor jesse preached a amazing sermon i remember it was um all the denominations and religions came from cain and he preached about a lot of things about like sin and stuff like that and after that service i'm like wow i'm going to go out for prayer because that's when you went and you said um anyone wants to give a prayer we'll pray for i'm like i want to go up i'm going to go up first and i went up first and uh i got prayed for i'm like after that we i took the youth group right after that we all went to burger king and we were all talking about the word we're like wow this is so amazing no one ever preaches against sin or um or how to live holy and we were just it just felt like we were all washed clean and had like white robes like wow it just felt so nice and clean and so that following week uh yeah that following week our our pastor at the cma church he came up to our our leader uh and he went and he told us that we're not allowed to go to any churches that are not cma because they preach false doctrines so we weren't allowed to come to your pastor jesse's church anymore so um during that time so uh during a little uh after that like maybe a few months um i went and i started talking to my wife and the first thing we did was actually there was an event we had and they invited a bunch of youth groups from out of state and we had this big event and we were at someone's house fellowshipping right and then my my wife who was sitting on the stairs i sat on the stairs next year and we were just talking and i was like i was talking like you know what pastor jesse baptized me in the name of the lord jesus christ and i don't feel the same anymore it just feels different and that you're like yeah he got he baptized me in the name of lord jesus christ and we're like no way and we started talking about the bible and that she started talking about serpenty i'm like what is serpent seed i don't know what that is but i'm gonna look in the website and see what google says about it you know so i didn't i didn't find much about it but i'm like okay it sounds like it can come come from the bible i'll believe it if it's preaching in the bible and that's the first uh thing my wife taught me was serpency about it so i'm praise the lord for that so um so after after that we had another youth event that we did and um this time um this time um we were doing devotion and i i wanted to lead devotion so i went and i started teaching them that the only way to be correctly baptized is in the name of the lord jesus christ and after that everyone was like shocked and like the the two uh supervisors that are watching us they came out right after after service and they were like why you preach that what are you talking about the holy ghost told me this and this is correct way i'm like and i was so upset i'm like why are you guys going against me this is the word of god this is right here in the bible and at that time i just knew it i'm like you know what i'm going to stop going to this church and i told my wife we weren't married yet but i told her you know i'm not going to go to that church anymore i don't go to pastor jesse church because that's the truth so that's what we did so we went to your church um 2014 at the end of the year 2015 and um we did a lot of bible studies every week i remember those those are amazing and then after that i i had to get a new job so i went to school for about four months for my current job and we stopped having bible studies but um during that time i did get a good job and i i i got that job and i went and i bought this new car which this is my car back home right now and uh my dad was really upset at me because i left the hmong church at first he was really um upset because i bought a new car i'm like okay but i'm a grown man i can buy a car you know so then i was telling my dad like what's the real reason why you're mad at me and he's like because you left our church to go to pastor jesse's church and i just told him i'm like no i i know that god's with pastor jesse and i'm following the truth no matter what and we got to this big argument and i was just telling and i just felt the whole time no matter what happens i'm going to follow jesus even though all my family betrayed me stabbed me in the back i'm still following jesus and that night my dad kicked me out of the house and i called pastor jesse and i'd really thank god for passage justin his wife for letting me save you guys for a whole month so thank you guys for that so um i stayed with them for a whole month and uh during that time i got an apartment and um when i got an apartment this was like 2015 in september um i started having a lot of dreams like this the devil was attacking me constantly every the whole month was like every time i closed my eyes even for like five minutes i was attacked every single night and pastor jesse was and we were praying constantly and um so pretty much i went to third shift 2015 and uh we went about three years in 2018 i was working third shift and during that whole time it was like um that's like how uh the israelites they came out of egypt right and then they went to the wilderness that's what it was for me those three years were like the wilderness for me going out in the wilderness i was like still in the world but i was still going to the message church and this is where my wife and i we were we were struggling like i knew that going to this church was the right way so i'm going to follow no matter what even if i can't live it now and my wife so many times he just wanted to quit so he's like no i can't do this anymore this is too hard i just told her just keep doing it you know we left our old church we're not going back there you know we're coming here and then we pressed on and then we prayed and i actually got a job i i still did my current job but actually got moved to second shift so that i wasn't missing service every week every other week so this was amazing but this was 2018 and 2018 was the year god really completely changed my life around um 2018 was um i got moved to second shift and then we had that flood that happened the church had that flood and then during that time we all went to the ymca and then um i i just felt let like i just want to sing some songs you know since we don't have any instruments i'll just come up and sing some songs and i started song leading at the ymca for a bit and then we had uh you were gone for a week to preach somewhere else and brother brian came and she preached the word to us and he preaches about finding your position in god and after he preached that sherman i just knew that i had to uh god wanted me to be here song leading and that's where i found my position right here so after that after that a few months after still in 2018 around october i was listening to a bunch of sermons from brother branham and i was at work listening to it and uh i was listening to as an ego stir as wings in the nest or something like that and um i just after it got done listening to it i'm like wow i know i'm an ego i'm not a chicken i'm an ego and i'm like i need the holy ghost at that time i was sick i was seeking the holy ghost for a while now but then at that specific time i wanted the holy ghost so that whole week i i constantly listened to a sherman every single day and i went through uh i think three different tests like the first test was like on a thursday night where i listened to a sermon from brother branham and he talked about the statute of the perfect man and he said you have to have a portion of everything right and i'm like i don't have a portion of anything of all those links i'm like the how am i gonna get the holy ghost if i don't have all these things and i didn't i just kept praying about it and then the following night i remember uh praying and god told god was telling me think about um remember peter and mary and all the disciples were all in the upper room and they all received the holy ghost after they prayed i'm like okay i have to wait and pray to god so the following day which was on a saturday we went to go visit a family member and they were very uh very critical towards our church and i was really upset but i i couldn't really say anything because i felt like i was being tested because you know you can't receive the holy ghost if you don't have brother you love you know so i i went i had got i got tested from that and i didn't say anything come out of line or anything and then the following day pastor jesse was out preaching somewhere else and brother simon came but then he came like five minutes late he came out 11 05 and we already and i was like one it was a really small service like and my sister connie was still here and oh sister nominee was here and sister wendy was here and it was only my brain was here it was that was it that was a very small group brother simon came in like very a bit late and he came in and we we did some songs and then he started preaching about you know the latter rain and you need to be filled with the holy ghost and be born again right so um after service i'm like okay i want to be prayed for for the holy ghost so i went up and i i sat up right there and i was looking at tv and i felt satan tell me oh you can get the holy ghost we can get it next week or next month you'll get a dollar uh you'll get it further down the road and i just told i just told myself and saying i'm like no i want the holy ghost now i'm gonna get it right now so so this was the time uh brother simon was going to go to thailand and uh i knocked at the door and he was praying and then i told him hey i want to be prayed for for the holy ghost so we were standing there and he was praying for me i'm like praise the lord and i don't i didn't really feel anything at the moment it's like okay now we're gonna go down and you're gonna we're gonna be on our knees and i'm gonna put my hand on your back and he started praying for me and i received the holy ghost then and i i still remember it i'm like all i could say was thank you jesus you're so merciful that's all i said like for like five ten minutes straight it was just uh just some amazing just to be filled with the holy ghost it's so different it just feels so amazing i guess honest i don't want to say it so uh after that uh after that um after that a few months passed and then i was starting to listen to a lot of prophecy videos from a lot of different other people like that are not in the message church but like are in denominations and stuff like that there's this website where they post like oh prophecies we got from god we hear from god and um there's this one prophecy that came forth was the three days of darkness and i didn't know what that was but then when i heard it i'm like wow this sounds really scary and like it it was uh i remember we were sleeping at night and i was listening to that and it shook me so bad that my wife woke up at four o'clock in the morning while i was still awake because i was still shook by the video cause i was i was scared nervous i'm like man if this three days of darkness is happening like very soon oh my gosh we're not ready for this and i was really shook and my wife was my wife was um woke up too and we were like oh my gosh and we both decided to call work the following day because we we were so nervous and so we didn't know how to process this thing and that at that time we were praying i started praying for my wife i'm like you know hon you're not even ready to go in the rapture what the rapture happened like instantly you know you won't be ready you know you need to get the holy ghost and i'm like at that time my wife was still uh wearing pants at work i'm like the only thing you're lacking is you gotta stop wearing pants at the church and i'm not pants at work and then you'll receive the holy ghost because that's the only thing she was lacking on and that night that following day uh we went to pastor jesse's house and we talked about the three days of darkness and how it's it doesn't really line up with scripture even though they i really learned that even though someone has like the holy ghost on them if it's not in the word then they're just it's not really from god you know and i really learned how to um divide it divide the word and make sure it's based off of scripture so um after that after that uh that following sunday i remember pastor jesse was praying here and he was praying i'll let the let the king come down here and come down and join us and and then after service i remember my sister went here lydia came up and my wife was here we all were around the circle right here and we were all praying for the holy ghost for lydia and for my wife and then my wife got the holy ghost right there too this was um april 2019 i believe it was it was a perfect birthday present you know so from god i gotta say so um so after that after that we my wife and i we went on this big um oh the rapture's coming the rapture's coming jesus is gonna take us away and we went through this big season of listening to a lot of uh things people were saying like the dreams they had the visions the the um prophecies they've been having you know even we got a few ones from ourselves that jesus told us she's coming this is the time of the rapture and we went and we talked to pastor jesse about it and we got that settled out you know praise the lord praise the lord with that so uh so um i still believe the rapture is still happening so um yeah so that's pretty much uh most of my testimony and we go all the way up to this year and we're just still watching and praying and you know look at the news look at the signs of the lord coming again yeah that's where we are so that's pretty much my testimony praise the lord thank you brother praise god yeah we sure appreciate you know we've really seen since amen and who are like you know some of the most recent converts i think everybody can see the huge change in their lives and the growth in their lives my wife and i talk about it from time to time and we're so thankful for their testimonies they're good examples of you know what you can what god can do just like pull you out of denominations and then as you feed on the word you grow in grace and knowledge of the lord and they've really taken position and you see them grow in power and understanding and we just really appreciate love them and appreciate their testimony by god's grace yeah i can say i have to live with brother amen you got to live with me and my wife for a month we're so grateful by god's grace it was a privilege to baptize both of them we surely loved them and thank god so can you pause the livestream now or just i'm sorry shut by god's grace we love you buddy thank you sister
