[6:01] the rapture is for me i believe thus
[6:03] saith the lord i've given my whole life
[6:05] to this message amen
[6:07] it's what my whole desire is is to see
[6:10] jesus and if we keep confessing god
[6:12] rewards us amen
[6:14] but he said any of these evil men that
[6:16] spoke evil against the promised land the
[6:18] baptism of the holy ghost they will not
[6:20] inherit the promises
[6:22] save
[6:23] caleb
[6:24] oh that one in a million
[6:27] that's what i was telling i think i was
[6:28] telling cam and randy that
[6:30] i can say to each one of you you are one
[6:31] in a million brother bang
[6:33] but stephen you're one in a million all
[6:35] you saints here you are one in a million
[6:37] because we've seen hundreds now we've
[6:38] seen hundreds we've seen hundreds right
[6:40] that can't receive all the truth or
[6:42] maybe don't know about it so we're
[6:43] trying to share it with them
[6:45] you can see millions on tv can see
[6:47] millions we know the population's
[6:48] billions almost 8 billion now
[6:50] you are one in a million for sure save
[6:53] caleb he'll see it and to him when i
[6:56] give the land that he's already tried
[6:58] upon
[6:59] to his children because he hath wholly
[7:02] followed the lord
[7:05] this is this is caleb's nickname
[7:08] the man who holy followed the lord talk
[7:12] about a nickname
[7:16] so
[7:17] 427 years later caleb stands in hebron
[7:21] and he says this day
[7:23] this scripture from abraham is fulfilled
[7:26] amen
[7:28] hallelujah
[7:30] because god told abraham i will bless
[7:32] you verse 17. in genesis 27 the angel
[7:36] the lord swore to him
[7:38] your seed
[7:39] will be as the stars of heaven as the
[7:41] sand upon the seashore and thy seed
[7:44] shall possess the gate of his enemy's
[7:46] church we're only you know 50 some years
[7:48] 57 years from brother branham let's take
[7:51] courage amen
[7:52] he had to wait 400 years to inherit some
[7:55] of these promises some of these promises
[7:57] may just be 10 years away maybe 20 years
[7:59] away maybe 30 years away maybe 40 years
[8:02] away we don't know but let's have faith
[8:04] let's know that every word of god spoken
[8:07] with us saith the lord it's got to come
[8:09] to pass it will not return void and
[8:12] let's believe it until it does come to
[8:14] pass
[8:17] 427 years later
[8:20] i'm fulfilling what abraham prophesied
[8:22] about me
[8:23] oh church with lord willing we're going
[8:25] to say i'm fulfilling what paul
[8:26] prophesied about me
[8:28] amen 2 000 years ago right with rapture
[8:32] we're talking rapture
[8:34] i'm going to fulfill what brother
[8:35] branham prophesied of 50 or 60 years ago
[8:39] see but we've got to stay true to the
[8:41] word and we've got to holy follow the
[8:43] lord in all that we do
[8:47] remember hebron was going to be
[8:48] important in the future
[8:50] god had to conquer right then
[8:52] because uh let me let me see second
[8:55] samuel two i'll give you the exact
[8:56] number of years if it means anything to
[8:58] you
[8:59] second samuel two
[9:02] because so many years later oh wow
[9:05] so oh wow almost 400 years later
[9:07] because this was a 1042
[9:09] bc
[9:10] over 400 more years later
[9:13] david becomes king
[9:15] and the first city he's king over is
[9:18] hebron like the bible said that time
[9:20] david was king in hebron over the house
[9:22] of judah was seven years and six months
[9:26] oh so look at what's going to come out
[9:28] of caleb see lion the g amen
[9:31] oh my what a what a family lineage amen
[9:34] this family is filled with overcomers
[9:36] amen how many want your family to be
[9:38] filled with overcomers hallelujah
[9:41] my grandpa overcame death right when my
[9:44] grandma died
[9:45] my mom overcame cancer when she had
[9:47] cancer hallelujah god's healed me god's
[9:50] helped me god's done great things for me
[9:52] god's doing great things for you church
[9:54] we're leaving a godly legacy for these
[9:56] young ones to see amen
[9:59] if it doesn't come in our days we said
[10:01] perhaps it'll come in their day but our
[10:03] desire is to live so dedicated to god
[10:05] that god can use us and the next
[10:07] generation can know exactly what they
[10:09] must do with the word
[10:12] the word is not meant to be denominated
[10:14] the word is meant to be taken out and
[10:16] lived amen how did it we've seen what
[10:19] denominations do with it praise god it
[10:21] does but with the believer it lives but
[10:24] it has to live every day of our lives
[10:26] amen
[10:28] glory
[10:31] so this
[10:33] this uh caleb's victory was a foreshadow
[10:36] of the future king that's coming right
[10:39] caleb was in other words god was saying
[10:41] there caleb's a mighty man but there's
[10:42] coming a greater one
[10:44] about 400 years down the road and then
[10:45] after david he said he could have said
[10:47] there's coming a greater one not solomon
[10:49] a thousand years the seed of david the
[10:51] messiah amen
