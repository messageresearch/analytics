feet and a unto my path you're the light you're the light unto my path one more time you're the light unto my amen praise God let's take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace like like to open up to Ephesians chapter 3 again we'll just read out of there I'd like to preach a part two on uh the Christian family Ephesians chapter 3 I believe it's verse 14 by God's grace bless you we'll read uh 14 15 and 16 as the the context here is speaking of the family of God being strengthened in the Inner Man by the Holy Spirit and surely that's what we desire right we desire to be strengthened here tonight by the Holy Spirit hallelujah how many how many would like more strength as you leave here tonight by God's good who how many want to be stronger tonight Hallelujah well we come to the right place hallelujah thank God for that Ephesians 31415 and 16 so let's read that we'll read 14 15 and 16 and let's begin on three 1 2 3 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man amen let's have one more word of prayer here father God we thank you again for tonight Lord God may we be strength ened with your spirit in the Inner Man Lord as we are the family of God hallelujah we're grateful Lord thinking of our family Lord God Moses is our brother my Enoch is our brother Elijah Elisha brother brandham Hallelujah Martin Luther John Wesley Lord God St Paul these are our brothers Hallelujah we have sisters like Sarah Rachel Lea we have this wonderful family Lord we're so grateful Lord that we have a family name a holy name a name that has no reproach the Lord Jesus Christ so father help us Lord to manifest the strength of God as only the family of Christ can dear God I know you will I know you'll help us Lord God in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God Hallelujah so we'll look at the Christian family here part two um you know just reviewing we looked at the father as the commander uh the blessed man who seeks God's God's face seeks God's will seeks God first and he seeks the right way for his family we looked at how a husband uh meets the wife's needs by love and then we looked at just briefly on the calling for children some more some less and then we looked at the responsibility of the children uh by God's grace so I want to pick up kind of right where I left off um by the grace of the Lord I want to uh look at Ephesians 613 says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand so I'm going to pick up on that scripture uh Isaiah 33:6 I'm going to pick up from there where the Bible said we must have the stability of the times praise God and so uh we we know these are Dark Times by God's grace the lean age is a age that's rich and increased with goods and says they don't need any more of God and we've got to battle that Spirit constantly right we need we need reminders that we need more of God hallelujah we can't trust in ourselves our bank accounts our jobs we can't trust in the economy right we can't trust certainly can't trust in our government or nor our leaders so we've got to remember uh that we're fighting a a battle we're fighting a war and we must do everything we can to stand for the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah especially in our homes and in our church by the grace of God the stability of our times as we said was wisdom and knowledge the scripture says of course we know that just generally it's the Holy Spirit anointing in our lives Hallelujah and then 1 Corinthians 15:58 says wherefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast so there we see that steadfast again uh unmovable right so we have stability we're stable Christians unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord hallelujah uh remember on Sunday we saw how Joshua said my house will serve the Lord your house your house is a business it's a spiritual business how many say business is good hallelujah amen I like that virtue I like that confidence amen hallelujah confidence in Christ we're we're to be be producing something we're to produce the love of God I'll say like this we're spiritual Gardens and we're supposed to produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit right we are a garden for Christ Hallelujah like in Song of Solomon the wife is the garden well we're a spiritual Garden we're supposed to bring forth the fruits of the Holy Spirit unto God Amen so he said be unmovable have stability in other words in these times the way you do that is always abound in the work of the lord always be fruitful in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord so do we know when we get to heaven there will be no regrets no person in heaven will ever regret any labor they've done for Christ right they'll never say well I wish I would have prayed less while I was on Earth or I wish I would have went to church less while I was on earth right they're never going to say that right because God is going to reward them they fell in love with God on Earth and and all the blessings on Earth was just the foretaste of Glory Divine Hallelujah it was always just a foraste Hallelujah and God sees all of our labor and God is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him so we are uh we are commanded be unmovable have stability in these times now I was just you know thinking how you know these last uh 12 years have been such a shaking time for the message 12 years ago the believe the sign I call it believe the slander website came out and it really sh shook a lot of people some of our dearest friends my wife and I some of our closest friends have fallen away from the message because of this website because they those people were able to be moved they didn't have the stability and I say that with all love and kindness they didn't have the stability of the scripture and you know as we reflect on some of the you know our friends we can see some of their character it really wasn't devoted to the word of God uh some of them were more uh prone to be drawn to popularity right or the lust of the eyes or the lust of the flesh uh they spoke more often about bank accounts and finances and business than they did the gospel of Christ and we can see that years later but when we're in the midst of you know growing up together you know in in Christ we maybe we didn't see that as uh maybe as plainly as we should or or maybe could by God's grace at that time we just all assumed everybody was 100% in the message but then we see how people can be so easily moved they they discover one thing about uh the message or they discover one thing and it just shakes them uh because they accept a seducing spirit and a doctrine of a devil but we're supposed to have stability in our times and what gives us stability is the wisdom of God it's the knowledge of God hallelujah and we stay abounding in the work of the Lord so people get distracted and families get distracted think of that families and some of these families that have fallen away either the father got distracted first or the wife I should say the husband or the wife uh it's not the children's responsibility it's the parents' responsibility so it proves the parents were uh they were they were instable they could be moved from the gospel uh and so church we are called to stand we are not called to stumble remember Jude 1:24 says unto him that's able to keep you from falling some of our closest friends and some of our Associates around the message have fallen they've stumbled at the word of God but the Bible said he's able to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy amen hallelujah just as Israel stumbled at The Stumbling Stone you know since 2012 many people have been stumbling at the Bible revelations of the message Hallelujah they stumble at it they say well that doesn't mean what it really mean what it says about hair it doesn't really mean that just like just like the devil told Eve it doesn't really mean that you won't really die sister you really won't lose the anointing when you cut your hair but yet the Bible says you do right and who's right the Bible or or some uh some half half converted preacher we'll say it like that you know who's right the Bible's right hallelujah amen see and the the word of God uh makes us faultless because we're washed By the Waters of the word you know we think about you know some of these preachers that Fallen uh their families and and what I what I've seen is that their family fell first before they fell one man in particular here in Ohio uh we heard it on the tapes Years brother Brooks and I heard this man preach and right there in Lima and he we heard him preach that he let his children listen to rock and roll as long as they had headphones on he let him listen to rap as long as they had headphones on but we knew brother brandom said don't let that trash in your home you can't stop it Bo you know about it in there you got to get it out as best as you can and then the the man let his wife and daughters cut their hair trim their hair just a you could always tell you know it's straight on the back you know you could always tell well so that don't grow like that normally that's not a normal hair growth and then he let him wear the foundation like we saw a few weeks ago with visitors you know teenagers there's they got foundational makeup on well the Bible don't say it's okay to wear makeup you know but their family fell first and the preacher would let his teenagers uh sit in his office during the service when when hard preachers came in to preach hard like you know obeying the Bible you know like like believing what the Bible says hallelujah so the family fell first and I've got it on tape I heard it because Z reminded me of it brother Brook said in 2007 that man is going to fall so that man had all those things wrong in his family and then he made fun of brother Brooks how he wept and shouted and danced and cried and he made fun of brother Brooks's worship and brother Brooks is on tape brother brother Brooks said that man is going to fall and he fell uh would have been let's see seven plus 12 would have been six years later he fell away from the message and now he totally condemns brother brandom and and us and everything like that you know as far as message Believers and nobody would have thought that years ago because he had videos about promoting brother br's Ministry and all these things but what happened the family fell first he let his guard down in the home first and then it just brought him to ruin H Allelujah in other words they set up Idols in their home an idol of uh makeup right or in other words an idol of of of worldly Beauty Hallelujah my they set up all these Idols in their home and pretty soon it brought destruction to their home my so it's also called leaven A little leaven Levens the whole lump right now see if and if they would have ever gotten the presence of God God's presence would have rebuke them for that just like Paul walked up to Peter and said you're to blame right God don't have to use somebody to rebuke us God's spirit can rebuke us itself Hallelujah but if a person rebukes us let's not say Well they're just too hard or they're rough if it's right it's right if we're wrong we're wrong let's be honest before God hallelujah let's clean out our homes let's clean out the church let's just have a clean life before Christ Hallelujah why do we want a dirty life if Christ offers a clean life amen Hallelujah but see there's so much uh unstability in this time there's so much wavering in this time but we've got to be called to stability Hallelujah the Bible said in 1 Peter 2:8 Christ is a stone of stumbling he's a rock of offense even them which stumble at the word and they stumbled at the makeup scriptures or the women not cutting their hair scriptures and the worldly pleasure scriptures they stumbled at these things they stumbled at real Holy Ghost worship and the Bible said they were being disobedient so when they disobey the the doctrine of the word of God they stumble Christ becomes an offense to them no matter how much they say how they love God or go to other churches if they disobey one word of that Bible they've stumbled at Christ the word because Christ is the word amen hallelujah where also they were appointed so in other words that now we go back Peter goes back well remember God the Potter he makes some to honor and some to dishonor thank God church we ought to be grateful that we've got stability in these times amen that means God has ordained us God has appointed us as vessels of mercy and not vessels of Dishonor Hallelujah so entire our entire lives are built upon Christ the word and of course 2015 was the tape worship movement of course we're not really affected by that too much uh thank God uh by the grace of God but you know uh the word of God when it's truly preached it becomes an offense to people and we have to admit too some some scriptures are harder for us to obey than others right because we all have human weaknesses right in each family each home if you're honest you're not perfect at always obeying the word of God right every home has its weakness how many remember a question and answer 64 what did Brother Braham say he said my daughters battle me on the the length of dresses he says all the time so if you and I could have stepped into brother bram's home on a just a Sunday morning you would have heard Sarah and Rebecca saying well this is long enough daddy or this is long enough Mama Mama's like no go change right brother R said I fuss at them all the time you would have heard brother R fussing a prophet of God fussing saying no that's too tight go get on something more loose and the church said Hallelujah he tells us on tape that's why I love the tapes we get a view into a prophet's life now thank God both of them repented right Hallelujah and his daughter's Faith one passed on sister Rebecca passed on but Sister Sarah has has been married to a preacher all these years I think she's got six children if I'm not mistaken I know that because brother Troy swy I don't know if you remember him Troy suy from well now he's from Michigan uh he talked to her numerous times on the phone and so he kind of got that insight into brother bram's personal life there from I like that perspective rather than the other perspective coming out of Jeffersonville and you know why Hallelujah I like that perspective by God's grace because she's married to a preacher and they just don't press play and Obey because they press play and disobey but um you know those are the the shaking movements now you and I you know those two might have not have shaken us so much I'll be honest that first one did it shake it shook me quite a bit you know I had to I had to dig down deep that's in fact that's one reason why I started the YouTube channel was to dig down and prove to myself and everybody I preach to that we believe the message messages the Bible scriptures God's fulfilling right now I had to nail it down I want to prove it to my family I want to prove it to me I want to prove it to all these deniers all the people stumbling I want to prove it to them that we received the Bible revelations that Paul preached amen hallelujah amen God has restored our hearts to the apostolic fathers amen and nothing's proven to me more than doing that searching the Scriptures Daily proving whether these things be so amen but you know what God is behind all of this because the Bible said there must come a falling away and the Bible said in Isaiah 1914 the Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst of them God allowed this perverted Spirit to come in there to test them just like he did uh as as he told Mah and Ahab God said I need somebody to fulfill the scripture where ahab's going to go up and die and the dogs are going to lick his blood who will go for me God said and all these spirits come up and finally a lying Spirit uh came up and God saidwhat are you going to do he said 'i'll be a lying spirit in the mouth of 450 prophets and God said go do what you got to do go I'm sending this lying Spirit to fulfill the word of my Prophet amen Church how many know that every promise to a prophet of God when thus say the Lord it shall be fulfilled Hallelujah God will send that God uh God will send that evil spirit remember the Bible said an evil spirit from the Lord troubl Saul God allowed that because God saw the desires of Saul's heart Hallelujah God mingled the perverse Spirit Hallelujah in other words God is allowing these vessels to manifest what they want to manifest how many want to manifest real Holiness in this hour well God's got a spirit for you too amen it's called the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen not a perverted Spirit which means a wayward or distorted spirit but it's the spirit of truth hallelujah amen we wrestle not against flesh and blood as much as my wife and I would have liked to see our friends come back to the message and I I tried to debate with them in in a Godly way so did Simon we tried we couldn't do it because we're not wrestling against them now I I just wanted to go up to the brother and just shake him and say hey do you remember you were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ remember IE witnessed to you you know remember the Bible remember what the Bible says about acts 238 right as much as I would have liked to done that that I'm not wrestling against flesh and blood it's against spiritual wickedness and in high places praise God right and we've got to let God fight some of these battles amen hallelujah it's not our it's not it's not our place to to to to to try to we can't fully convince somebody it's got to be God they've got to yield to the Holy Spirit just like we do praise God many of these things we just got to commit to God but I'll say like this for our houses we can't let perverse Spirits or spirits of idolatry or spirits of Doubt come into our house we've got to keep our house a house of worship Hallelujah a House of Prayer amen so I want to just that's that's just a few more scriptures on that idea of being stable in this time and I think you know Austin was sending me some good texts this week I think another thing people are trying to use is fear tactics in this time and I I've shared it with you you know I'm not a immune to it too sometimes I wonder is there going to be big trouble for this election in 2024 like last time and we got that eclipse coming that's what awesome was sharing with that's a good example some people are so fearful that an eclipse is coming but the research I've done said eclipses are pretty pretty common and if you look in the Bible the eclipses generally deal with Israel right Hallelujah just like we had the blood moods come in 2015 you know now that was a real that was a real kicker right there because we had the Pope visit and then the leader of China visited all within a span of two months I thought the Rapture was coming I'll be honest cuz the pope had never come before that's the first time he come to the United States Barack Obama was in there he sure looked a lot like the Antichrist now I know it wasn't going to be he wasn't going to be the Antichrist but you know uh the fact that he was so uh liberal and people loved him so much it looked like it was a prefigure to the Antichrist the pope of course we know that but you know that's another issue we got to overcome is fear we've got to be stable while everyone else is faltering and stumbling and struggling we've got to be stable on the word of God and it starts in the home hallelujah hallelujah like the Bible said we just got to cast it down if you feel fear coming in your home throw it down like what do you do when you find trash you throw it down in the trash can right you don't throw it up to the trash can cast it down don't don't let this come into your house cast it down the Bible said throw it down cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God and I believe this church if we do that I believe if we cast down all Temptations and evil spirits I believe God will give us the holy spirit in preparation for what's to come in other words I believe God will prepare us for any trials that God does allow right like God kind of prepared us for the uh uh the co thing because we knew we knew not to take the jab this video will probably get taken off of YouTube because of that but the VA a c c i n e is that how you do it is that how you get past all the Bots right can't even spell it let me just get a picture I'll put it up there on the screen so everybody can see it I don't see it's just ridiculous but people but so many people have suffered heart conditions because of the their their ways right but see the holy spirit gives us wisdom and understanding beforehand Hallelujah and you know the other the other thing was you know we'd had you know Church we've been in church long enough to know the Bible said gather more as you see that day approaching we weren't deceived when people stopped going to church we didn't quit going to church for two months we just stopped our Sunday night services and then we just started everything back up again brother cam never shut down any Services I was a little nervous I shut down the PM Services I didn't know what Co was flying around here I didn't know what it was doing they put all these pictures on there it was just a cold right but I don't know the way they were pumping it I didn't know what was going to happen but we were prepared in the sense that we're not going to stop going to church church attendance has fallen even further because of Co but see God had already prepared us for that if God called us to go to church then God's going to protect us at church hallelujah amen dear that is time to go home Hallelujah then we'll really be in church then hallelujah we'll be with the Saints in a really great church service an unending church service now I want to briefly look at the father's love a few more uh scriptures here before I move on to the next thought about creating peace in the home that's kind of what I felt led to look at here tonight now you just see the Father's Love in a few examples of course there's many examples but even with laan laan in Genesis 31:28 said and Hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou Hast now done foolishly in doing so so laan was upset with Jacob Jacob you know he snuck off because he knew Laban was probably gonna try to do something uh not nice to him not exactly sure which word I should say there but when lean finally caught up he said what do you mean you didn't let me kiss my children my daughters and so we see the Father's Love there he wanted to say goodbye now he turned out to be a pretty fair man there at the end but there we see a Father's Love I really wanted to say goodbye I really wanted to hug them and kiss them off right like a real dad or real father won't say just go I don't want to say goodbye you know I could do I do better without you right A real man has love for his family Hal that's right and Jacob uh when he didn't know about Joseph in Genesis 3735 he said for I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him so he was constantly weeping over what he thought was the loss of his son Joseph Now isn't that something Jacob was a prophet but God didn't tell him for all those years that his son was alive see church God like brother says God doesn't tell His prophets everything right God let him mourn the whole time yet his son wasn't dead cuz God was going to do something greater he was going to give him a real surprise amen a real joy unspeakable and full of Glory when he finally saw Joseph amen they wept on each other's neck they cried everybody could hear it what a reunion amen but God hid it from him but there we see the love of Jacob for his son Joseph even when David had committed the evil with basheba he still the Bible said in 2 Samuel 12:16 he still fasted and lay all night upon the earth now church when have you or I or how many people you know have fasted and laid awake not SLE slept been awake all night praying for something I'm talking about eight hours or more however long you sleep and this was this was his sincerity for a a newborn that's how sincere he was that's love how many believe that amen that's real love this is the kind of man David was and he didn't have the Holy Ghost in the soul either he wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost we'd say because the Holy Ghost could not be given until Jesus was glorified how about jarus in Mark 5:23 and jaras besought Jesus greatly saying my little daughter lith at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live so look he was like begging Jesus come lay hands on her she's at the point of death and Jesus was so merciful Hallelujah healing Jar's daughter amen this ought to encourage us to pray to plead with God to cry out to God when things go wrong you see the Father's Love in jarious and then I love of course the father The Prodigal this is typed to God Almighty Luke 15:20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kiss him this shows God is a god of compassion this this son did everything to disrespect his father this son was acting like his father was dead come on Church he's basically acting like my dad's dead I got my inheritance I don't care about my dad but yet he was still there looking from a long way off is there any hope he's got to come back someday I'll be ready when he comes back that's a real Father's Love Hallelujah just like God did for you and I Hallelujah is that right God was ready to welcome us with open arms hallelujah amen that's what I experienced when I became a Christian you know I fought against or just you know mocked Christians as I was growing up or as a teen but as soon as I became a Christian all the Christians I knew they just welcome me right in nobody was like oh I remember when you said that and I remember when you said that I don't no they just welcome me right in Hallelujah just like we welcome Austin right in right Hallelujah every saint that gets saved we just welcome you right in Hallelujah God's been looking forward to this day amen the father's been waiting Hallelujah with open arms amen no matter how much we've disrespected God or or done despite Grace the Bible said he's rich in Mercy Hallelujah he's ready to welcome his children home oh thank God Amen to the father's house Hallelujah now Church our responsibility now I want to get into the parents again and then I I'm going to end with the wives responsibilities remember I showed the the husband's five duties for the wife I want to end with the wives but before that you know we we must create peace in our home that's one uh great command that we must have uh Cas I like how you're so ready she got her eyes on me she's like Daddy tell me Daddy tell me I'm gonna put that I'm ready I'm ready I appreciate that uh Romans uh 1417 it's a pretty good book anybody ever heard A good sermon on Ro Romans before it's a great book Hallelujah you can highlight every verse in there like that Meme shows Romans 14:17 for the kingdom of God how many know the kingdom of God is actually within you it's not meat and drink as much as we want to have a good diet and things like that but it's righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost am and I want to apply this just to our home life remember uh we looked at wisdom and judgment right we looked at that on on Sunday so so a wisdom in judgment produces righteousness like we saw right if you judge every case the right way with the wisdom of God you'll have righteousness in your home right so when we have the Holy Ghost we should have righteousness we should do what's right we should have the character of Christ and we should have peace and joy in the Holy Ghost so these three attributes it's an interesting Paul brings them out it's kind of like faith hope and and joy right but in this case he uh similar to that but we have three of them we have uh righteousness peace and joy and I just want to you know focus on on on peace uh you know because in our homes uh we got a busy home with with eight children you know and there everybody's talking lots of times and having a good time and sometimes there's a lot of talking sometimes sounds like a lot of commotion uh you know what I'm saying there just a lot of talking a lot of noises and sometimes shouting screaming and crying you know sometimes there's like that and so sometimes you know uh if it's at the end of the day or there's a lot of noise it doesn't sound very peaceful right and uh I'm not saying that the you know every house just has to be quiet all the time there there's times of course for joy and laughing and teasing and as long as it's good teasing uh jokes and everything like that but I'm talking about the peace of God I mean peace between the siblings and the parents that's kind of peace I'm talking about so we should have the peace of God in our homes Hallelujah in other words we don't want anger between Fathers and Sons we don't want hurt feelings between fathers and daughters Hallelujah we don't want hurt feelings between husbands and wives we want to have peace amongst the family members right and the Holy Ghost produces this and this is one of the uh uh important scriptures of the Holy Ghost so in a person's life in their home they should be able to manifest righteousness I do what's right I have the peace of God in my home and I have the joy of the Holy Ghost I've told you this before but almost every visitor that comes to our church says wow I really feel the presence of God in your church I really feel the sweetness of the Holy Spirit there's something different about uh your singing and uh the people love to worship and the people really pull on the word of God what is that that's that's the effects of the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is here hallelujah kingdom is Dominion it's the rule the Holy Ghost rules our church hallelujah amen and it should also of course rule our homes so see if we judge like we saw on Sunday the scriptures if we have wisdom in judgment it'll produce this it's just this it's the holy spirit in another form right another more different fruits and attributes of the same Holy Spirit Hallelujah so and remember peace is one of the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit we're not going to read it but it's in Galatians 5 we're familiar with that it's one of the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit now I want to bring this out too in Zechariah 8 if you would uh Zechariah 8 verse 16 And1 17 you know Zechariah of course was remember he was a prophet along with Hagi as Israel was returning back to the promised land from Babylon right and Hagi and prophesy Hagi and Zechariah prophesied at the same time and it strengthened the people to finish building the house of God okay and then later Nehemiah came around and he finished the wall around the city okay but look what Zechariah says these are the things that ye shall do so when you get your church established when you get the city surrounded and you got protection here's what you need to do how many like that I like the Holy Spirit to tell me what to do I've always been that way like with my boss or anybody my wife or my children just tell me what you want me to do I I want to do it by God's grace uh don't don't don't don't be vague don't be General especially if I might work if I'm going to get graded on something or if my livelihood depends on this just tell me what you want I'll do whatever you want right in other words I don't want to fail I want to do what's right Hallelujah just tell me don't beat around the bush just tell me what you want me to do Hallelujah make it clear I'm sure you say the same way with preachers right preacher don't beat around the bush just tell me what the Bible says right just get to the point and these are the things that you shall do speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor see there's the Judgment right execute the Judgment of Truth and peace in your Gates okay so peace so he said have judge isn't it isn't it awesome to see the same attributes of the holy spirit in the Old Testament the New Testament that was na in the natural just judge things right and have peace and we see the holy ghost in the spiritual produces the same thing so we should have both we should have peace and righteousness joy in our hearts but also in our homes in our church praise God like I told you I'm very thankful these last five or some years since 2018 we've had lots of years of Peace by God's grace no nights where I've had very few nights where I'm up and I can't sleep because of the problems in the church that's been a blessing I like to sleep Hallelujah I don't sleep enough though brother Austin I gotta work on that sleep but you know before that there was lot there was numerous nights I couldn't sleep very good because of problems in the church so I'm thankful for peace I'm thankful for peace in the gates Hallelujah but the Holy Spirit saidd do that execute judgment and create peace in your Gates and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor in other words love your neighbor as yourself this is my commandment that you love one another that's why I say that tonight thinking about the love of God and love no false oath don't believe a lie for all these things that I have hate sayeth the Lord so the Lord hates us imagining evil in our hearts and being angry against our neighbors right unjustly and lies false Oaths so see I think it's just beautiful the Old Testament uh commands do this do peace keep peace in your cities keep peace in your home keep peace in the church and the Holy Ghost produces peace now what what's what's uh what's a what's our battle what our struggle is is that we're supposed to have peace but inside we have a constant war going on remember that from Romans 7 pull up Romans 7:23 Paul says I want to do right but then Evil's right there and I do things that I hate but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind I know what brother Jesse preaches I know what brother Brandon preaches I know uh what the Bible says but sometimes we have wars in our minds it's hard to do that it's hard to remember what what was preached on Sunday what what what what what what kind of atmosphere should I have in my house what's really important right now we're supposed to promote peace in our homes but then there's a war going on constantly inside of us hallelujah and that's why like the Bible like he says here we got to bring all those Wars into captivity we got to end the war and we got to create peace in our minds Hallelujah so if there's a war in your mind because of someone in the home you got to go talk to them about it and create peace we got to confess our wrongs and say qu okay can we start all over again by God's grace can we start over can we can we uh just forget about our our failures and our shortcomings I'll forgive you you forgive me right that's what I've had to do so many times I've had to say I'm sorry to my wife and can we start all over again forgive me I need God's grace right Hallelujah but see we're we're supposed to create peace but we have a constant war going on so we've got to win the war on the inside thank God the Bible says greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world hallelujah amen we've got greater power inside of us to get peace inside of ourselves that way we can create peace in our homes Hallelujah and we do that again by casting down imaginations I'm sure you feel it you know uh I feel all the time at school uh my children my family came into my classroom just last fall I think it was November uh and they were like wow daddy they actually got to watch how the class operates you know and I think they were saying like wow daddy you got you get a lot of questions you got a lot of interruptions and sometimes I literally feel like my head is on a wheel spinning sometimes I feel like my head is going to fall off right and so so I I get practice at this almost every day you know uh this person arguing against that person this one's crying that one's screaming that one's bleeding that one's picking their scabs and now there's blood all over the place that one spills their water bottle there's water all over the floor uh just all kinds of stuff and I I've just had to just many time many times we just have to breathe Lord Jesus help me to have peace and I I got to put on that pretend smile sister HOA all the time yes can I help you I don't feel very peaceful on the inside but I but I know I realized I got to put it on because I'm I'm fighting a war pretty soon I'm going to win this war because the day is going to end amen I'm going to go home and get some sleep Hallelujah and then they'll be more patient tomorrow right we'll have a better hopefully you have a better day tomorrow by God's grace but we got to be willing to fight the war Hallelujah we got to be willing to overcome Hallelujah and cast down the imaginations cast down the Temptations and we must create peace inside of our gates Hallelujah we must have a peaceful home cuz remember life and death is in the power of our tongue we can create that right we're many creators right brother said you're a a a messiah you're a miniature messiah messiah means anointed one right now we're not putting ourselves in the godhead like some people do that's wrong we were in we were in God's mind but that doesn't mean we're a member of the godhead like some people say what a bunch of nonsense but we were in God's mind right and we can in other words we can create we can cast down the wrong and we can create the right even if other people don't act right like sister Lena at the job right even if other people don't act right I'll act right right we talked about that hallelujah what a great victory that is amen I had to deal I I I had to deal with that a couple weeks ago we're were in a meeting and somebody made a joke it always happens I don't know if you guys see this at work you know at some point somebody's going to make a joke about drinking wine at home right so they were they were talking about this this mother who did I mean she did everything she was the volunteer on that committee that committee and they let her say a few words and she said well did you notice uh I forgot to put in there that I I drink wine on some of these nights and everybody laughs and I've got to go like I got to bite my tongue and be like everybody's laughing around me all these so-called Christians are laughing in other words like it's okay for me to go home and drink and get wasted because I've had such a hard day it's never okay to do that because you're giv place to the devil right but see I I get tested like that too and I just had to grip my teeth and say I'm not going to laugh at that that's not funny the real wine you need to drink is the Holy Ghost praise God like I do Hallelujah some days it's harder than others right but eventually I'll get to that good drink of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah all my sorrows will be gone hallelujah amen that's right so no matter what job we're on you know we've we've all got to overcome these evil spirits that come against us hallelujah God helps us hallelujah we have the war battling we we battle but we must overcome we must be committed to the battle praise God and not give up on the battle remember brother R said he when he sinned it was because he was weary and tired and don't you find that to be the same church the times we struggle the most is times we're tired physically not getting enough rest or we're sick or it's just the end of the day and we're just tired but remember we must wait upon the Lord in order to renew our strength hallelujah amen we must give God some time we must cry out to God we must call upon God hallelujah we got to give God some time to meet our needs and not just rush to the F the the thing that feels good right like that good memory verse the girls uh was it Eden said not to fulfill the lust of the flesh right was that that's right that was was that Romans anybody remember that verse where was that found what was it Haven bless your heart give her two class Hallelujah Romans 13:14 don't fulfill the lust of the flesh right make no provision for the flesh Hallelujah and that's where we need the help by the grace of God how many would say they need God's help that's what brother R said that's what I need to help that's when I struggle the most is when I'm tired and worn out we all need it praise God that's why I love what the Bible said Joy comes in the morning mercies are renewed every morning in the morning I feel refreshed I can get a clean start I'll get rededicated to God I'll get refocused on God hallelujah and we'll have a good day by God's grace amen so we must create peace Hallelujah now I'm coming down to 40 minutes all right now I want to put these up there like I did on um Satur or Sunday for the the men I want to put these quotes up here for our sisters Hallelujah also for our brothers amen so again I I I as I preach the different marriage Banquets you know I read this one book if you haven't read it for marriage I think I recommend it everybody it's called his needs her needs um it's a great book and it's based upon this one uh psychologist's thousands of interviews now I know any person that's in the message that hears me say that they'll say oh he needs a he's saying we need psychologist I'm not saying that right there used to be this big thing uh oh we the preachers rely on doct Dr Dobson instead of brother brandham and church I know what they're saying I know Dr Dobson is not a prophet I never studied Dr Dobson right but what I'm saying is that I read the book and then I found everything he said any truth in his book was already in the Bible if he said anything true if that psychologist had any truth it was already right in the Bible Hallelujah and so that's what I did is I read this book a friend re another pastor friend REM recommended that I read it and I read it and I saw wow the five needs of a woman that's in the Bible the five needs of the man that's in the Bible so it's true now I throw out I throw out all the the cherry pits right throw out all the cherry pits in there and you just take what's true to me it just shows science is just proving more that God's right I'm not saying go to the psychologist I'm saying get the Holy Ghost and then the Holy Ghost will be your psychologist now let me say this there are some people that suffer really bad things and they might need to go see a Christian psychologist I'm talking about really hard things like abuse and things really difficult things they might need somebody that can really talk to them and God can use that and if people don't understand that the shame on them you know they're just being judgmental they're just they just got a critical spirit by God's grace uh because remember the Bible said a wounded Spirit who can bear and church I know people who have been abused and they cannot be healed many of them haven't been healed because they haven't gone to get help and just what I mean is just sit down and talk with somebody about it they just keep it all bottled within it don't have to be a a counselor I just mean they got to sit down with somebody and just share it and then just request prayer because I know because I've sat with them as we wept and cried together and they won't go tell people they won't talk about it and I'm not saying anything any anything evil against them I'm just saying some people need that outlet some people just need somebody to listen now I I can be that too as a pastor I can do that I'll keep everything in confidence by God's Grace I'll try I'll try with all my heart to keep it in confidence I'm just saying there you know some people just they criticize anything that doesn't come from brother brandham and yet brother brandham got all these sermons from other places like Dr Scofield Dr Lin a Baptist preacher and the church said brother Ram got many parts of his sermons from a Baptist my goodness these people anyways haters are going to hate like they say so as we look at our sisters remember a Proverbs 31 Woman she has two things about her she fears God and she does good to her husband all the days of her life I preached on this year years ago and I preached that proverb series see she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life see if a remember a sister sisters are are we'd say on the bottom of responsibility right God Christ husbands wives right but the Bible said she will be praised the Bible said the children and the husband will praise her because she fears God she she respects all those in Authority she respects God's order of authority and then she's active she she ministers to the children of course I didn't put the whole chapter up here but she's always ready to get up and minister to the children she's always ready uh to help out financially you know she's able to do whatever the family needs she's there for it praise God and notice she does him good and not evil all the days of her life Hallelujah her children rise up and call her blessed as you skip forward some verses her husband also and he Praises her Hallelujah why because she always does him good she always treats him so well praise God many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all of course this speaking of the bride of Christ Hallelujah right favor is deceitful and beauty is vain because it'll fade but the woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised so we see two strong attributes about her she fears God and she does good to her husband all the days of her life Hallelujah she she respects God's order Hallelujah remember don't forget that hubby's got a love too he's got to lead with love he's got to be a loving man patient man now I brought this one out too uh 1 Corinthians 7:14 you're familiar with this for the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now they are holy so even if one spouse male or female even if the spouse isn't serving God they know that if God is anointing my life my life is making my spouse's life more clean my life is sanctifying my spouse's life Hallelujah that's the word of God that's thus say the scripture Hallelujah right in other words the power of a holy life in the home uh cannot be measured a Christian spouse influences the whole home and the Bible said makes the children holy right now that doesn't mean children don't have to repent but it means the presence of God in other words it's like job that mother or father whichever one's holy the they prayed and God is going to protect those family members amen just like job said job said per Adventure if my children sin I'll still make sacrifices so God will have mercy on them amen hallelujah but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or sister is not in bondage in such cases but God has called us to peace that doesn't mean they can go remarry somebody else the Bible explains that earlier in the chapter the Bible said if somebody leaves they either got to remain single or be reconciled so that's the devil uses that verse to make people a lot of people adulterers for what knowest thou oh wife whether Thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou oh man whether Thou shalt save thy wife you know I and I've met people on both sides when I first came in the message um there's some brothers we met up there in Sheffield and they were in the church but their wives weren't right and still to this day I don't know if their wives are converted um but I just love that Faith they'd keep coming to church they'd always pray for their wives now I know this one for sure I know this one for sure over in Lima there's a a mother who brought her three children to church when I first started going there and her husband wasn't even saved she kept praying kept believing now he died of cancer a couple years ago but he got saved and he went to a denominational church at least he never came in the message but he got saved and he respected brother brandom he respected the church as well because he saw the life that his wife and children children live by God's grace that's a good testimony of that see they were both they were both worldly but then she heard the message she grew out her hair she started wearing skirts took off all the makeup and she serves God today she goes to message church today by God's grace and God God you know what for what th what knowest thou oh wife whether thou sh whether Thou shalt save thy husband that woman is a fulfillment I'll just tell her name her name's sister Michelle praise God her Godly life won her husband over hallelujah amen what a beautiful testimony because this is what it's all about God calls us all to different situations but as God is distributed to every man as the Lord ha called everyone so let him walk and so ordain I in all churches right so whatever situation you find yourself in familywise God has ordained it right and remember the Bible said God will make all things praise him right all things will work together for your good hallelujah amen so I want to bring that out as well just the power of one spouse in the home now talk talk about the power of two spouses now now you got your children Hallelujah under the anointing of God even more by God's grace now here's a man's five needs for our sisters that are married Hallelujah see I preach on the brothers first right Brothers picked on them first I ain't picking on anybody by God's grace Hallelujah but I'm going to pick on somebody let's pick on me Hallelujah cuz I need it probably more than anybody so what the what the husband needs he needs respect and he needs submission he's always got to be respected and as long as he says what's what's right he needs submitted to that makes a man feel like a man he needs physical intimacy he needs a companion so when he wants to do something for fun as long as it's not sinful it's good for the wife to join him uh then he needs uh he needs a wife who's attractive right so our sisters got to keep themselves attractive by God's grace you know they got to stay healthy and that might that might be a need for a sister too I guess that wasn't on the list but I guess out of those 1,000 interviews it wasn't a big deal for the Sisters I don't know sisters you take it up with him I don't know but one thing as a man I don't want to see myself go I don't want to get a pot belly I'll say it like that I don't want love handles by God's grace you know because I guess I've seen my uncles do that you know they've drunk themselves to really bad Health diabetes my grandpa ate himself uh too many White House cheeseburgers what they call White Castle cheeseburgers my grandpa ate too many White Castle cheeseburgers till he got diabetes you know and died prematurely so I don't I don't want that by God's grace but uh a husband needs an attractive spouse so she has to take care of herself make herself attractive and uh he needs domestic support so while he's mainly doing breadwinning he needs a wife to take care of the home by God's grace take care of the children Hallelujah now there's lots of scriptures and quotes of course for this lots of scriptures uh you know so when I taught the marriage banquet I went through all these but we're pretty I would say we're a mature church I don't think we need to read those but I think it's helpful just to hear Brother brandom on some of these how many could say Amen to that for me nobody can really say like brother brandom right like whoop boy you ought to be ashamed of yourself you ought to love your wife you know no nobody can say it like brother Ram can say it he said you ought to be ashamed of yourself man always keep the honeymoon alive like people just can't say it like brother BR these modern psychologists and stuff they can't now remember brother R says this the the the woman has these sacred things she has to keep she needs sacred virtue there's our sister virtue there she in other words remember virtue is strength in public like it's strength to obey and obey the word of God in public that's what virtue is is it strength to uphold your testimony so a woman has to have a sacred virtue about her she has to stand for the truth and you always do when you wear those holy clothes right let your long hair down or whatever it may be that's a sacred virtue you're not ashamed of the Gospel he said you must have a sacred Womanhood and that's of course all these things like we're talking about and then a sacred motherhood Hallelujah right because most worldly women they don't want uh they don't want the the busyness of having children right they don't want that you know I heard I heard a stat recently I kind of rejoiced and they said within maybe 10 or 20 years the conservatives are going to outnumber the Liberals because liberals just don't have children they just want to have two incomes retire but naturally if God terries now I shouldn't cross my I'm not crossing my fingers but if God terries you know conservatives will will will take over the number now that's on the sad part Muslims do that in many other countries they move into other countries and they multiply because all these other countries like Europe they're not having lots of children so they know they can take over if they just populate and grow in numbers right become citizens so that's their way of overcoming but I just think it's interesting uh that conservatives know the Bible they know children are a reward Hallelujah they know the Bible says that Hallelujah and then she's supposed to have this sacred duty to honor her husband got to honor him and remember many times honor is just what we say about the person I heard a preacher use this illustration and he talked to a man who he he celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary now this is kind of for the brothers but I guess it could work for the Sisters too and the preacher went up and said how did you do 75 years of marriage you guys coming up on one right pretty soon here I'm coming up on my okay I I feel bad was it the 22nd now yeah 22nd yeah I think it's 22nd wedding anniversary now or is it 23rd I gotta do my math after this uh it's 21st 20 21st no I feel bad now sorry honey I'll do the math later 21st that thank you honey I thought it was 21st but I felt like I I thought we already celebrated our 21st but the the man said he said how P he said he said young man how did you get to 75 years and he said he said at my 25th wedding anniversary I got a gift on my watch and the watch said the watch had the time but then it said say something good about Ruth or whatever his wife's name was so it had a digital clock on it but then it had say nice things about your wife and he said that's how I made it through these 75 years that now of course we need more than that we need the Holy Ghost but I thought it was a good example of how words create an atmosphere right that creates honor the wife says good things about the husband right and the husband says good things about the wife right creating that atmosphere of respect Hallelujah so brother man tells us that's what we need the sacred attributes of a woman sacred sacred attributes of a man of course as well I was preaching the other night about women to obey their husband obey yes that went out of the marriage ritual a long time ago but they ain't going to do that no they live in America and they let you know so as well right how many women wear the pants in the family literally right and Also spiritually they wear the pants in the family he said they're not going to obey the women but as long as you don't do it you don't never try to call yourself a Christian brother brand says because you're not see how can a woman be a Christian how can she be Christlike if she's telling the man what to do she can't right she's supposed to submit to the man I don't care how much you dance and speak in tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God now that's a statement right there Hallelujah see nobody can say it quite like brother Brandon Hallelujah did you know I looked up today now I use chat GTP I don't know how reliable that is but I looked it up and I said what was the divorce rate in 1950 you know what chat GTP said three out of a thousand marriages had divorces that's way less than 1% way less you know what the divorce rate is now it fluctuates between 40 and 50% so the divorce rate has increased between 40 and 50% in these 70 years isn't that amazing three out of a thousand were divorced right what and what brother R say 1956 was the year America had to have the Revival again and they turned it down and that was your Elvis Presley went big right again Satan using music and rock and roll right get into the homes get into the teenagers Minds ain't that something divorce has increased 40 to 50% because of sin right because of Dishonor and of course men being immoral too I'm I'm not I'm I'm saying both of them right just it's just crazy that's that's a fact it's crazy now 500 out of a thousand marriages brother brother Austin they got a they got a coin flip 50% chance is going to last or not can you imagine and yet they go to the Altar and say I promise I'm going to marry you till death and they break their promises so easily they just flip a coin well is this going to work or not right I think a I heard a preacher say this too he said uh you know couples when they get married they have trouble and they then they say I wonder if you're the right one I wonder if I married the right one but God's word tells you if you got married that person's the right one Hallelujah right the very fact you got married and went through the courtship process and and and gave the vows that proves that was the right one what God has joined together let not man put us under Hallelujah right in other words if God allowed you to marry that person that person is the right one for you Hallelujah at least for this Earthly Journey brother ra said if you got the wrong one here you'll get the right one there I can't explain that I don't know how that works Hallelujah but at least for this Earthly Journey God ordered our steps amen God knew God knew all the events of our life God allowed all these events of Our Lives we got to trust God hallelujah God hates divorce amen my brother talks about how some sisters disrespect he said don't it make you feel kind of bad when men start talking and women come up and butt right in and being kind of rude now that doesn't happen among us but just you see it out there in the world right I have pretty respectful uh uh co-workers I can't say that's happened to me too many times maybe a couple times but not too much by God's grace I got a pretty good work work environment but here's a woman says I'm a Christian but my husband persecutes me in every way uh what should I do now listen you're supposed to obey your husband that's the word but if he tells you and refuses you to read your Bible and go to church something like that you don't have to obey that because he that won't forsake his father husband or wife is not worthy of Me Jesus says so here's the balance of it right if a man's being abusive or something like that or telling a woman uh to obey or disobey the word of God she don't have to obey that right so we just I want you to know see brother man balanced it out right God never wants anybody to be hurt or abused right God never wants that now I like here brother Ram says uh see that the women reverence her husband uh he says then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a Son of God if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is a reverent man reverent clean there's my hour with his wife before his family a real servant of God then the woman children all should respect that servant of God with reverence amen I think a good example is Abigail from the Bible right remember uh her husband was a foolish man nabal I think his name means foolish if I'm not mistaken or something like that what was it what was it snore that's what his name means no Kidd she's been doing some research on the Old Testament I appreciate that there's probably some other meanings too by God's grace yeah uh because I think even Abigail says he's a foolish man he's a foolish man he's a foolish man um but I think she's a great example my husband's a foolish man but she but when she saw David there she kept David from sinning right and when she saw the man of God remember she took meat she took cheeses she took bread wine and oil amen she took all these things out to the man of God hallelujah and then God blessed her and made him her husband right in other words God saw the plight of this woman right and God saw her real worship for God and God eventually L her out of this and got her into a better marriage that's something but he wasn't living a clean he wasn't a a very respectful man but she still respected him to a degree right and she still honored God's men Hallelujah she still honored David a man after God's Own Heart oh it's a beautiful scripture now brother Ram said uh Adam you shall rule over Eve right not to be a boss but to be a helpmate part of you she's sweet she's kind she's tender you should lead her around sweetly because she's part of you you go to mistreating her then you're mistreating yourself and a man mentally right won't do that okay so again brother B is showing how how the man must treat the woman in other words there's mutual respect so I I share this one because sister M went on brother brandham with hunting trip so that's that's the recreational companionship and church he even did it on their honeymoon that's just funny brother raham said A Woman's Place is a is a man's Queen at home he says outside of that she has nothing and we know that to be the truth I find that sound I know that sounds oldfashioned but I'm responsible I know that after my going away from this Earth them tapes and them books will be living on and many of you young children will find the days to come that's exactly the truth because I speak it in the name of the Lord now see that's what the that's what the society's trying to do right get women out of the home so they don't raise their children right they they don't spend time with their husbands and what does it produce all these divorces right brother BR says she's got uh no business in a defense plan A Woman's Place is at her home with her children now if her husband's sick and she has to work that's different but a woman's place is at home in the kitchen and when she leaves that she's out of her place let's go to uh Titus Chapter 2 where we can see that plainly Lydia brought that up to me that was a help Lydia by God's grace I need to yeah I need to close here while I kind of lost track of time having such a good time I lost track of time here Titus Chapter 2 after Timothy Titus verse three the aged women likewise that they been Behavior has becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands and to love their children so see how important it is for the Sisters to teach their children the right way to love their husbands to love their families to be discreet Chase keepers at homes that's why brother Ram mentions them about being home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed so look at the Christian character of this godly woman I'll say like this here's a new testament Proverbs 31 Woman and the church said amen look what she does she loves her children loves her husband keeps the home Hallelujah that the word of God be not blasphemed Hallelujah and like Lydia was telling me you know I as remember on Sunday nights asked the children you know what did you get out of the message you know and Lydia shared you know well I was I enjoyed how uh we're reminded that sisters golly Christian sisters are like cornerstones and Lydia correct me if I'm wrong here and Lydia's like well how you know uh I think this is what she was trying to say how can uh sisters in the message be cornerstones if they're out trying to date or if they're out trying to uh wear paint and wear sexy clothes they're supposed to have the character the P character of Titus Chapter 2 amen this is what our sisters should strive to be right here praise God not a painted up uh uh flirt at a youth banquet like we got today running around here Lord have mercy God help us ah Hallelujah I know he'll help our church by God's grace in other words if people want help they can be helped by God's grace see there's nothing that God could give a man outside of Salvation that's better than a nice wife and Austin and brother Jesse said amen there's no person that can a person when they're tired they won't confide in anyone like they do their own wife that's true I can't talk to anybody like I can talk to my wife what a fortunate thing you brothers are when you've got a nice little wife that's clean and upright and moral and you can come in when you're tired and weary sit down and she can talk to you she can do do more with you than anybody else that's right she's a jewel she's a queen amen she was you know God the greatest thing God gave man outside of Salvation was a wife she was to comfort him to help him to bless him to console him and be a real companion to him they asked brother brandom should a saved wife refuse herself to her husband if she's a sinner this is the man's physical need no sir that's your husband you'll drive him farther away from God than ever by doing that that's right see you're married to him he's yours and you're his that's the intimacy part remember we talked about the kitchen The Parlor and the bedroom right we talked about that a married couple but there's going to be peace in the home they got to have Fellowship in all three places Hallelujah that's right and then he says don't pay attention to these uh I say immoral things right related to the bedroom he said uh get that filthy stuff out of your mind treat that little lady like she's your sweetheart if she's 60 years old you just be the same you be that Gallant boyfriend remember you are that Gallant boyfriend you women live the right way to your husband you husbands live the right way to your wives be real nice respect one another with your family relations so forth let it just be as reverently Godly and greed with among you and everything as it can be don't never push or shove don't be dirty and vulgar brother Braham says understand talk to your wife if one nature is to you and another nature to her talk it with her and that's what I found you know if there's any problems in the marriage by God's grace they just need to talk about those things right pray about it have a humble attitude you know be willing to change be willing to uh willing to humble yourself try to bring peace to the home by God's grace amen he said always remember you're God's children you're from a royal family your Royal Blood there's no better blood in the world than yours and that's right a royal blood shows itself what it is it's Royal show what you are I'm a son of a king I'm a son of the king my wife's a daughter of a king how should I treat the King's Daughter how would you treat the King's son see what I mean be real genuine hallelujah how many want to be real Christians in the home by God's grace and he said wives you want to be uh pretty for your husbands he said if you're a woman you want to look pretty for your husband for your boyfriend or something like that I can't tell you about curling your hair or they call it tinting it or something like that I have nothing to say that's up to you just ask the Lord what to do he'll tell you that because I'm trying to explain things by scripture so brother mam basically saying it's okay for women to want to look nice for their husbands right just don't put anything in moral on don't attract other men right just be be as pretty as you can in a holy way for your husband by God's grace Hallelujah brother Ram said Eve was one of the most beautiful women the Earth's ever seen she was pretty to begin with pretty is as pretty does if you add a little acts to mix it up together in a little John 3:16 it'll be anything that Ma Max Factor or Maybelline right ever did try to fix it your husband will love you more everybody else will I'm sure God will as well how many know Acts 24 and John 3:16 is better than uh uh any makeup or any uh anything you could actually anything anything superficial anything man-made you could put on how many know the spiritual beauty is way better than uh the worldly Beauty by God's grace H I'm trying to say it the right way by God's grace all right so I think I'll just pause right there let's stand our feet we'll I'll pause right there by God's grace I'm way over an hour I'm an hour 15 so the musicians can come sorry about that I normally don't go that far on Wednesday sorry I just got caught up in Heavenly places by God's grace I want to finish those quotes how many enjoyed those quotes by God's grace amen great reminders you know I got just one comment on my sermon from Sunday somebody on YouTube said uh just what a blessing that was for the family there so I'm thankful for that I hope these are a blessing to you as well how many of our how many how many of our sisters want to really manifest Titus Chapter 2 praise God how many of our brothers I know Austin stepped out but how many of our brothers want to manifest Ephesians 5 husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church praise God we all want to do our best church we all want to grow and church really let's make our homes a place of the peace of God let's have peace with our spouses let's have peace with our children because that's a real attribute of the kingdom of God you know do you remember any of you you can play something uh let's say peace of God cover me play that I don't know uh you know some of us lived in sin longer longer than others but I remember walking into many homes and there wasn't peace in the in the the homes of my friends and I remember there wasn't always peace in my home either with my parents in fact rarely was there peace you know Church most of the days my dad would isolate himself in the basement he would smoke cigarettes and drink coffee all day and he would slip up at the end of the day we'd be in bed I'd hear him slip in and just go lay down and then early in the morning he slipped down there before we got up and isolate himself like that for most of the years of my life growing up that's the kind of man I saw now thank God my mom prayed for me what could I have become if I would have followed my dad's how about you with your stepdad what kind what could have what what man would you have become thank God for the Holy Ghost thank God for the scriptures of God thank God for the Holy Bible that we got church to make a real man out of us a real sister a real woman we are blessed God's been good to us hallelujah we're just thankful for God's Amazing Grace Grace praise God hallelujah you know these uh family messages maybe I don't preach on them very much because it's so deep inside me you sometimes the pain sometimes is so sometimes it's so real if I stop and think about it but uh but then the joy so real when I just go home Hallelujah you I told chrisan I you know I told you this too I said even before I was saved alls I wanted was a home that was happy that's all I wanted I just wanted somebody that would love me you I just wanted peace in the home and so I thank the Lord that he's done that for me and uh by God's grace I just want to have peace in my home let's pray tonight God will help us to have that peace in
