praise the Lord and praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah praise God take our Bibles stand this morning by the grace of the Lord appreciate all the saints good to see all the saints here in the house of the Lord this morning I'd like to open up to Hebrews chapter 12 I don't know if everybody saw the email Friday but I'd like to look at the three showdowns here this morning by God's grace Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews chapter 12 verse 22 I don't think I've ever preached this topic so maybe it'd be familiar I'm sorry or new to many of you by God's grace or if you've been reading in the church age book or spoken word Original Seed in 1962 might be kind of familiar to you by God's grace but we would like to look at this the three showdowns this morning by God's grace verse 22 if you're there amen amen but ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect now if you know the scripture earlier in the chapter he's talking about Moses how they had to come to Mount Si but he said we have a different Mountain that we come to praise God Mount Zion now verse 24 and we have a different mediator and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh God help us to obey all the word of God not refuse what his word say says for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven so the mountain we come to is not a physical Mountain it's a spiritual mountain and there's no speaking off a natural mountain today it's off a spiritual Mountain from Heaven is that right praise God let's read a few more of those verse 26 so what a what a a striking convicting passage of scripture here whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I will shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signified the removing of those things that are shaken as of the things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire amen let's just bow our heads if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto the Lord as we look at the three showdowns here this morning Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love dear God here we are Lord in your presence Lord humbly we come to you Jesus we ask Lord that Lord you speak to our hearts help us not to refuse the word that we hear from heaven and Lord your Prophet told us it's it's quite simple to know whether it's heaven or man speaking he he said if it's in the word of God for our day then it's Heaven speaking Lord God so help us Jesus to listen to that still Small Voice dear God help us to hear from Heaven Lord the Bible said we are come to that mountain Lord uh Lord spiritually dear God and we know that mountain will come sometime soon dear God whether in the next year five years 100 years we don't know no man knows the day or the hour but that mountain that city is coming Lord It's prepared Lord God and we're looking for it just Abraham looked for it all those years ago dear God speak to us now bless us dear God in thy presence in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen God bless you being there praise God so i' like to look at the three showdowns by the grace of the Lord [Music] um I'd like to uh I have a slideshow so I'm going to pull that up in just a moment here so sister man can you put on input HDMI number two there I like to just show some of these quotations by the grace of the Lord okay okay everybody you see that now I want to start with the Mount Zion so we can understand that by God's grace that's okay no problem my phone was ringing up here I were trying to get people to church and I forgot to silence my phone did everybody forgive me by God's grace I didn't mean to fall short there I just forgot to turn off the sounds we're trying to get Joseph here Joseph Candy by God's grace he wanted to come to church here so bang was going to pick him up on the way here so praise God I trust that they'll get here by God's grace so let's look at these three showdowns by the grace of the Lord how many know we're coming to a showdown praise God we're coming to a time when when God is going to prove who's God Amen aren't you glad my heart my heart bleeds every day because I see man exalting man right men wanting men to rule men thinking they can change things men thinking they can bring a time of Peace men thinking they can bring about uh you know food for everybody and solve all the Earth's problems and brother Ram plainly tells us that n none of the problems are going to stop or solve until Jesus Christ comes back amen he's the one who's coming back to solve all the problems so we want to uh uh look at that and uh Minister on that here this morning by the grace of the Lord so um let's look here I'm I'm pulling this thought here out of um the portion where brother brandom uh is told by the Lord he senses the holy spirit in his study and he senses the Lord tell them pick up your pen and write now how many have read that recently anyone read it recently at all or listen to it maybe nobody okay uh so I want to take a little bit and read some of that not all of it it might take about 15 minutes if I just read it straight but I want to read part of it and I think you'll be blessed by here this morning by God's grace but I want you to hear hear what brother Bram said here's what he said about this inspiration he said I'm going to read something now now if you know if you know spoken word Original Seed it's almost six or seven hours long there's two parts and you put them together I think the first one's like two and a half and the next one's like three and a half or four almost four brother R preaches almost six hours on the spoken word is original seat and it's very Elementary but it's very powerful because he goes back to the beginning to Genesis to show how God's power is in his spoken word that's how he starts everything that's how he does everything and it shows us the power of the spoken word in our lives as you progress and listen through the message what you'll find is that brother Bram said there was three seeds planted in the entire praise God there was a seed planted to the Evangelical Church just like there was three Messengers that went down to visit lot okay I'm sorry that went to visit Abraham sorry two went down to visit lot there's three Messengers right that went to see Abraham God himself in a fleshly uh uh Corporal body there I'm sorry theophany uh and then you had the two angels okay okay and brother B said the two angels represented the two Messengers to different types of churches he said one of the Angels represented Billy Graham to the evangelicals right and he said the other Angel represented all Roberts to the Pentecostals he said but I said there is another messenger he said it's God Among Us that is the third messenger amen it's God in flesh revealing the thoughts intents to our hearts so he doesn't specifically say it but his ministry was the third planting amen it was the third messenger was Christ in flesh planting the sea now church we can look back now that was 1962 we can look back now over 50 years later and we can see how what the fruits have produced right do you know any evangelicals that's what kind of fruit they produced you know any Pentecostals I got family that are Pentecostals I visited a Pentecostal Church in June I see what it's producing praise the Lord how about the third seed how about God look at churches that believe the message that really believe it what are they producing they're producing another book of Acts church amen hallelujah they are church we are amen we're a part of that amen we just must yield and be in the plan of God Amen it's this is what it's produced so look now 50 some years later look what each seed has produced we're longing and hungering I say like this we're hungering and thirsting for more righteousness amen that should be your desire to come to church you come here because you desire to be fed on the word of God desire toink of the Holy Spirit isn't that why you come we are hungering and thirsting for righteousness now most people are hungering and thirsty on Prosperity that's why they go to church to be more prosperous they think every Christian must be rich and that's not God's plan right that's what they think uh like I heard a friend of mine he's a t I have a friend of mine who's now a minor TBN preacher I got some of these friends we don't C we just talk on Facebook but he preached on Daniel and he said how every Christian today should strive for an excellent appearance because he talk he said all Christians Choice wear the best clothes they have and all these things and then and if you're not a millionaire dress like You're Gonna Be A Millionaire he said I see many CEOs out there in the audience I don't maybe see any CEOs out there I want to see people that are are are are are LED of God by the Holy Spirit I want to see adopted Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's what I want to see out in the crowd not necessarily CEOs but I want to see Sons and Daughters who know the word and that are literally hungry and thirsty for the spiritual food of God Amen they Hunger for More of the word they can't get enough of the word brother R said that's one way to know you got the Holy Ghost when you're in the word all the way amen Church let's be in the word all the way praise God and brother Gabe last week so inspired me I was so inspired uh you know because he said a few things and I thought my I really enjoyed that he said and i' I've said this before too um but he was talking about how we should not be scared of the Book of Revelation so that's why tonight I'm G to preach on the Book of Revelation I preached on over the last few months I preached on the Seven Seals the Thunders I preached on seven Thunders and some of the other things for Revelation uh oh the Legacy in church age I preached on that we should not be scared of that so if you're hungering for that tonight we'll preach on that uh so I really was inspired by that and he said also this he said shouldn't be scared of any two quotes we should expect as a man who would grow in understanding we should expect that he might have thought this one time but perhaps God will give him more Revelation at a later time okay we should expect a man to be able uh have to make not be able but just actually make a mistake or grow in Grace and we should able to look at those and not have it cause us to hate one another but love one another and just wait on God Amen and just wait for God to reveal his truth about those quotes and sometimes you know some people have disagreed with me I preach on you know ministers marriage requirements and different things where I've tried to bring the balance on quotes because you have quotes on both sides praise God there's how many topics like that and we just try to stand in between but the worst thing to do is get a chip on our shoulders and be arrogant about anything like we know all about it amen praise God it's not arrogance or things like that that's GNA bring us together it's divine love that's going to bring us together and let's let's keep the majors the majors and let's keep the minors the minors amen that's that's our like I said a few weeks ago uh we were preaching on the tongue a few Sundays ago that's the struggle with uh the message people God has revealed so much to us we got to be careful not to get a critical or arrogant spirit because Church honestly spiritually we know more than most churches praise God we honestly know much more than them and the critical spirit just looks to point out everybody's faults rather than bring them to repentance amen but if you but if you're just trying to correct somebody and you're actually help them along to learn more and gently the Bible said restore them in meekness and instruct them in meekness and all these things and and someone who's got a gift that's apt to do that instead of just pointing fingers at them we should point to the word right and show them how to get right with God Amen Hallelujah that's what we got to be careful in the message not make sure we're not as critical but we're more patient praise God and we should be more loving and that's what I struggle with that's what you struggle with many times sometimes you know the enemy will try to battle us with being critical of other people and I haven't got that message I have a whole message on the critical spirit I'll get to that sometime soon but I just felt impressed to preach this this morning so I want to just look at this here now he stops that paragraph now that's a lot of paragraphs 413 that's a lot of paragraphs I want you to listen real closely this here's what the spirit said pick up the pen I'd have to leave some of it go but I've got to bring some of it to you all right now next he says this now this is in the middle of him reading this statement about uh pick up your pen and write he stops here he says Now by waiting I'm sorry but the waiting was not by Moses for the people to get ready to receive Moses Moses thought the children would understand that he was sent brother man stops and says I never wrote it he did so it is now amen I just want to just get you to see that brother vom stops and says I never wrote this he wrote this praise God I want you to notice this even my brother I want to just State this if you read this portion of pick up your pen and write if you read this in the church age book there are some slight variations because brother Bram just made a few reading mistakes he just read the wrong words he injects some of his own thoughts so when it actually gets to the church age book there are some slight differences just so you know because I I read something I'm like huh I never read that so I went back and che check the church age book and there was a few different variations some different words like he switched up former and r a few times and different things like that you know he says a word over and over again and reads the wrong word in the text okay so let's let him be human praise God but notice where did he get this writing from he got it he said the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and WR amen now I want to read a portion of that the pickup in pen and write like I said it would probably take me about oh 15 minutes but I'm not going to take the full time on that because I want to get to the part about the showdowns okay so at the beginning brother BR begins laying uh Genesis 1:1 how there's a law of reproduction every seed will produce of its own kind praise God and he speaks about that and he talks about how Christ or Adam was a spoken word uh seed of God and he was given a bride speaking of Eve and how she fell by falling on the word of God okay then he goes into the harmony between Christ and the father amen uh and then he said talk then he gets into the bride he said those in the bride only do his will no one can persuade them different they have thus sayi the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete I'm sorry as he did complete in his days all right now next he goes to Joshua and Caleb I want you to hear this quote now brother Ram said the Holy Spirit wrote this look what he says about Joshua and Caleb now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end time leader to take the church over Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua amen so which one do we represent we represent Caleb praise God but brother man said Joshua represents the end time leader to take the church over into the pro proed land Hallelujah that's what he said there he said now notice God did not move Israel until his own appointed time Joshua waited for that time no matter how much people might have said God gave us the land the promise let us go now and take it they might have said Joshua you lost your commission you're all washed up why are you not doing something you used to know thus say the Lord in a moment and what the will of God was but the wise God said Prophet knew the promise of God but also knew to wait for that promise a clear-cut decision from God for this time and when the time come God gave it to Joshua and he stayed with him by the word for he could not trust others he could not trust him so will it repeat again amen now brother's typing this to himself because in this time they were saying brother brandom you know your meetings are getting smaller why are you what are you doing why you preaching against stop preaching against the women wearing makeup and the water bapt AP ISM in Jesus name so he's saying here that every Prophet has to wait upon thus sayith the Lord or they they're just silent and God help us to do the same praise God help us to wait upon the Lord until we know we've got a clear-cut decision from God Amen Hallelujah we'll go far than the Lord if we do that wait on his timing wait on his words now he goes into Moses and says the same thing he can only come at the right time then he goes into Joshua I'm sorry Elijah and says the same thing yeah to place everything back in order before the fire fell the 12 Stones then he goes into John the Baptist now I'm going to get to the part where he gets to our day now here's what I want to read so now everybody can read I'm sorry it's so small I thought I thought that thought would be good but anyway uh if you don't like it maybe just listen here okay now here's where it picks it up now he's coming down to where Elijah and Ahab typed out America today he saids says he has to be for that is history repeating itself from the time of Ahab he's speaking about how his ministry brother's Ministry would be here at the end time because Elijah was there when Ahab was there Israel's history under Ahab is happening right here in America where the prophet of Malachi appears praise God Amen as Israel left Egypt to Worship in Freedom pushed out the natives raised up a with great leaders like David Etc and put the and then put an Ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct so have we done the very same thing in America praise God I heard a quote I saw a quote this week brother Bram said I don't care if you put an Abraham Lincoln in the in the white house right praise God I don't care if you put another George Washington in he said this nation's gone you know sometimes church I know these are silly thoughts but I think maybe I should run for office because I'll Stand for the word and and then I read these things and I'm like you know because you're so you just want to see somebody stand up upon the word of God but brother said this he all his friends he knew that God the politics got corrupted by it right because it's all moneymaking system but you know in my like I said I love America I love freedom and all these things like that and I think well maybe I should run for office can you imagine me running for office but he says that he said he said it's going to fall now Israel coming out and taking over a land and kicking out the inhabit brother Bram said was a type of America doing the same today our forefathers left this land to worship and live in Freedom so our forefathers left Great Britain right and some of the other places uh to live in Freedom they came over here for Religious Freedom is that right they pushed back the natives and took over the land amen mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up but after a while other men of such poor caliber succeeded these worthy men that soon and Ahab was sat in the presidential chair with a jezebel behind him to direct him oh my now if you know the quotes what did Brother say who is our modern Ahab anybody know JFK right John vit Jerald Kennedy you know God have mercy on his soul you know he was our modern day Ahab because he claimed to be a believer but behind him was an influential woman named uh his wife right I hate to call names jacn Kennedy behind him now brother Brandon balls balls out uh jacn Kennedy and JFK many times because they're Catholic because they they they don't keep the word of God Jacqueline Kennedy because she started wearing really short skirts as the first lady she cut her hair and wore a lot of makeup as the first lady and brother ra said she's putting a sexy or she's wearing sexy sexy things and putting a spirit on all those women all the women in the nation because they know if the president's wife can do and I can do it that's what they think right but not a real true child of God Amen because we're not ruled by the White House necessarily we're ruled by m Zion is what we're ruled by amen the god of not Zion so that's the beautiful type there that the holy spirit gives to brother Brandon Israel kicking out uh the Hittites amorites was a a foretelling a type of America kicking out the Native Americans sad to say and I know they did some awful things right but not everybody was Godly in that early American people but them work but nevertheless they kicked them out but eventually an evil ruler came and now what did this allow if you know history the pilgrims left to escape uh the Ang angelican church if you know your history and they were just a offsho of the Catholic so in other words they left to get away from Catholicism or denominationalism or tradition worship amen or formalism or routine church services where someone told them what to do I shouldn't have to tell everybody to raise your hands right shouldn't have to tell everybody to clap shouldn't have to beg people to come to altar you should hear the voice of God and do what the voice of God tells you to do amen hallelujah it shouldn't be so formal shouldn't be so strict and routine it should be led of the holy spirit amen that's exactly right so the denominational Spirit comes by way of uh of just getting loose getting lukewarm and not following the leadership of the Holy Spirit I'm glad last Sunday we could pray up here for about 45 extra minutes I'm glad at lunch a little late by God's grace I'm glad we had that start second service at 5:00 P p.m. instead of 4 p.m. because we're praying crying and trying to get people to Christ amen hallelujah I appreciate all your flexibility for that by God's grace I know they're long services oh but church we got to be open to just having the spirit move as he wants to move amen hallelujah now next here's why I start using some color to kind of emphasize a few things now it is at such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come did he come yes he came he came and went but he came at the right time because that Ahab who was supposed to be a Christian right the leaders are supposed to be Christians all right but he brought in a jezebel a woman that was all painted up with and makeups condemned in the Bible we know that it's condemned but they brought in a loose Spirit towards the things of God they brought in h Catholic ideas they brought in the influence of well it doesn't matter but the whole reason our nation was started was to get away from that nonsense but then the nation backslides and lets it all back in there's no hope for America right as a whole there's only hope for individuals like you and I who can stand upon the word believe the Bible is that right not compromise believe exactly what the word of God says and keep standing like pillars in the church amen living for Jesus Christ amen now I want you to watch these words now I'm gonna put a I'm G to just show something after this just some something simple here then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel Showdown so brother R was supposed to come and then there would be a Mount Caramel Showdown now what it means is Mount Zion it just means another Showdown because Mount Caramel happened in Elijah's day right you later on the Holy Spirit identifies the three showdowns he's saying there must come a showdown watch this carefully now to see in the word this subject has been on my mind for about six months and I've just carefully tried to go back and read the scriptures that's I was waiting for the right time I believe this is the right time watch this carefully so if the Holy Spirit wrote this it's got to be in the word how many believe that if brother Brandon wrote there might be contradictions and things like that but if the Holy Spirit wrote it it's got to be in the word because brother said the Holy Ghost will only point you to the word only amen it won't point it won't point you to any man it'll only point you to the word of God Amen Hallelujah he said John was the Forerunner of Malachi for now we're getting some new language Lin forerunners we're getting some language you have to understand so John planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day all right Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown so John was the Forerunner for the former Reign and Jesus on Mount Transfiguration was the what anybody know lad rain he said now the second Forerunner of Christ will sew or plant for the latter Reign who is the second Forerunner of Christ does anybody know brother ramam right John the Baptist was the first Forerunner brother ramam was the second Forerunner of Christ second coming so brother ramam says he was supposed to plant for the latter rain he said he was gonna plant seeds for the latter rain that's exactly what he said church amen and now we can look back 50 some years we can see what the seed has produced we're a Bible preaching church we don't add denominations we don't add Creeds we don't give you a license to sin but we do give you freedom to worship and love God and if you love Christ you'll keep his commands amen that's what we give you Freedom at this church no one leads me no man on earth Isaiah Brooks or Craig Mo no man leads me the Holy Ghost leads me we're a sovereign church we should all be led by the Holy Ghost our headquarters is heaven amen exactly right Church but the second Forerunner will s for the latter Reign Jesus Will Be The Showdown and Jesus is the word so The Showdown is going to be who has the word who really has Jesus praise God that's going to be The Showdown for he will come back come to back up his word I'm so glad he backs up his word hallelujah and take is Bride In The Rapture so there might come a time while we're waiting for him to back us up okay Lord back us up here Lord was just waiting to back us up please back us up Lord things are changing politics are changing laws are changing Lord please back us up and church he going to back up his children he backed up Moses praise God he backed up Elijah he backed up all these men of God he backed up brother R he'll back up us we just got to stay with the word because God can only back up his promised word amen now look at the Holy Spirit writes the first Showdown was what Mount carel the second was the mount Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion will be hasn't happened yet it will be when will that Showdown be it will be in the latter rain in the latter the latter rain is a time period praise God brother said it'll be short he said but it'll be for the elect Hallelujah won't be a public show it'll be for the elect hallelujah amen now here's a little graphic there's no movement on it brother Gabe is real good at that he's got movements I thought I need to ask him for some advice on how to do this better but here's your three three mountains Mount Caramel which was a physical mountain now brother R never said anything about a 4Runner for that one I can't find a forerunner for the mount carel Showdown so I didn't put it up there because brother didn't say it okay but he said Elijah was the man at The Showdown and it was a showdown against Bale nalism that was actually in the Israel they were the head of Israel right so the capital the government had a baale worship a false worship right and Elijah condemned that he was the man of God to take that out okay now the second Mount Transfiguration now we got scriptures we'll go after this let me take off my jacket getting hot now I just to try to take what brother Ram said now look at the mount Transfiguration John the Baptist was the for Forerunner brother bam said he's the Forerunner and he and the former Reign fell during his ministry praise God to the first Reign what did he do he rebuked organizations that's what it said and pick up your pen and write that's what he said now the latter reign of this was Jesus himself on Mount Transfiguration brother M said and it was a showdown with the denominational spirit and we'll show that in the Bible we'll get our Bibles handy just a little bit by God's grace in other words it came to time where there's all this religious disturbance God has to show which side he's on praise God God's going to show which side we're on Amen is that right we'll either be on the right side or the wrong side the only way we'll be on the right side is if we keep the word of God Amen now this is the one we're coming to a Mount Zion Showdown it's not a physical Mountain yet right but this showdown will be a spiritual Mountain praise God and what what brother say what is the attraction on the mountain it's God fulfilling his word hallelujah so that will be God fulfilling his word right at the time of the Rapture right before the Rapture there will be a Mount Zion a spiritual Showdown where God is fulfilling his word what is he doing he's finishing the Gentile dispensation praise God the last names that are on the Lamb's Book of Life are realizing their names are written there before the foundation of the world and he God is getting ready to be finished and soon he'll turn to the Gentiles but he's got to show his mighty power one more time it is Gentile church and then the Rapture goes and then we'll ever be with the Lord Comfort Your Heart Church with those words let it comfort you this morning amen don't be discouraged be comforted the Rapture is a comfort not something to be scared about it's Comfort to the believer Glory Hallelujah he said Comfort one another with these words now this is where the Holy Spirit brought the parallel between forerunners and then the actual messenger or the one that was was to come so brother Ram was the former Reign or was the Forerunner to Jesus and then he rebuke organization if you don't know listen to indictment 1963 he said I condemn every one of you or I indict every one of you or ministers in the name of Jesus Christ for crucifying the word of God to your generation you see the water baptism you see Divine Healing and you say the days of Miracles has passed he said I indict you in the name of Jesus Christ that's a real man of God who knows what he's talking about now Jesus Will in the latter Reign Jesus will be there for the latter Reign and to show down with denominations and Creeds who is our Real Enemy Rome but who is Rome going to work with to try to destroy us the denominational churches and think about some of our friends right now that are in denominational churches if they don't leave that system they'll be the ones coming after us if God allows it in our day that's right the ones we love the ones we say are foolish virgin we better be careful how we right we want to hope everybody goes to heaven remember that message a few weeks ago scarcely saved and scarcely lost the foolish virgin is barely even saved like lot lot was barely saved by a matter of we'd say maybe yards or feet or something he's barely saved Noah was barely saved right Enoch went up way before he was scarcely saved that's exactly right now does that help does that help by God's grace does that help okay I don't know have you ever heard a sermon on the three showdowns I never even heard one did anybody ever hear one okay praise God because I was thinking well this might be kind of new to everybody I try to go slow but slow is a hard gear for me to get into okay now he keeps now this is more right after he talks about uh the three showdowns this is right next in the pick up your pen and write the last day Messenger will appear in God's appointed time it is the end time now as all know for Israel's in the Homeland talks about the Fig Tree putting forth its Bud right the Fig Tre is Israel Israel is putting forth more people it's putting forth a new generation right that's happening in Israel right now praise God any time now he will come according to Malachi when we see him he will not I'm sorry he will be dedicated to the word he will be indicated or pointed out in the word revelation 10:7 and God will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion show down praise God amen hallelujah now let's look at get your Bibles handy if you can I'm G to have some of you read some verses if some of the brothers are ever feels comfortable let's look at the Bible conditions of the last I'm sorry of the past two showdowns then we can kind of look at the conditions of our show doubt by the grace of the Lord hallelujah and now church I'm sure you feel the same way as I do my there's got to come a reckoning day there's got to come a showdown where we where where God shows that we are the true believers now God does in our daily lives we can see you know how God vindicates our lives keeps us holy Walk In The Word but there's got to come a showdown for that to prove that denominations if they keep going the way they're going Christ is not with them they put him outside the door and the church said right he is outside the door he's trying to get in but their Creeds and denominations and ways of man and worldliness will not let him in look at I'm just going to call one name one Ministry ever seen maybe I have call there's a very famous name uh Church in Australia and they're really popular with songs okay I'm not going to name the name I'm trying not to call name I know the holy spirit will sometimes but I'm trying not to okay and just about 10 years ago they started off with beautiful songs we sing some of them here and they're absolutely beautiful but last Christmas I don't know if you saw it was all over YouTube and all these things like that they did a Christmas special and they they sang uh was it away in the manger I don't know which I ask my wife yeah it might have been away in the manger and you know the sleep in Heavenly peace it's supposed to be a real sweet song church God we can you can see it on their website I went to their website you can see it on their website they dressed up men and women in the Roaring 20s uh kind of clothing which is short skirts and bobbed hair and painted them all up and they sped up the the pace of that song and danced around in sexual ways all around during that whole song A A Manger that was their Christmas celebration now you're tell and someone would try to tell us well God's in Hill song God's in Hill song God is not in Hill song right go call again forgive me God's not in that right now they might catch inspiration or anointing but the rain falls on the just and the unjust the gifts and callings of God are without repentance be careful what music we listen to make sure the songs are really humble and sweet that we download to our phones is that right because look where that spirit in advance in just 10 or 15 years that Spirit has gone to just real humble worship to now it's rock and roll and it's roaring 20s and it's uh hip hop and all kinds of things like this all this evil all this worldliness that they're coping and bringing it right into the church and the church smiles and snaps their fingers and STS their feet and they're blind and naked miserable wretched and don't even know it but the Church of God should have such a Holiness such a purity that we should feel the presence of God As we sing and have no connection to to worldliness no connection to denominationalism but only sincere love for Christ Jesus amen amen I'm sorry to call the name there but I guess sometimes the Lord does it sometimes and I didn't plan to do that all right now let's look at bible conditions now try to stay with me here now we see the following this is the mark Mount carel shown if you want to write that down you can read it in First Kings 18 17 to 46 I read through this and took some notes on it and the things that were inspired to me after reading pick up your pen and write I wanted to point these out by God's grace look at the conditions uh that were taking place at the first Showdown number one Elijah uses the I'm sorry issues the invitation for The Showdown later he said he did it at God's word or will so God called The Showdown praise the Lord and if you know the second one God called that Showdown God's inviting for a showdown does that remind you of God and Magog God calling a showdown where Satan tries to Encompass of fire Holy Fire comes down from heaven and vindicates God's people oh fire always vindicates God's people hallelujah Holy Ghost and Fire amen the power of God for Holiness and separation always vindicates God's people so God said I'm tired of this nonsense I'm gonna show who my Prophet is I'm gonna show who my people are let's have a showdown and see who's God Amen number two the 450 prophets of Bale were gathered okay so their denomination their system of worship was gathered against Elijah 450 verse one but they that's only if you count Elijah what about all those angels that were around him Hallelujah I imagine Elijah outnumbered the prophets amen Church Hallelujah now number three I put this in red because I want you to see this because the showdowns change a little bit the first one was a public Showdown right and they battled the denominational Spirit of the Bale prophets and it was forcing a choice amen had to make a choice but Elijah said choose you this day whom you will serve praise God if God be God serve him if ba be God serve him but God's GNA prove today who it is whether Jehovah or baale and it would be proven by fire God said I'm goingon to show now who it is by fire this reminds me of Aaron's Rod that bued doesn't it praise God cor and Dayan rise up and say we're all holy we can all be preachers we can all walk in there we can all Minister before for the spirit of God and the Bible said Moses and Aaron threw them on the ground their face on the ground because they knew this wasn't of they doing God called them to do this it's not a job you want to elect yourself for it's a job that God's got to call you for it's not a job you choose it's a it's a it's a unending call of God that God places on your heart and you just ha you just have to do it can I say it like that you just have to do it praise God and if God calls you to do it he'll give you Grace to do it amen verse four so I'm sorry not verse four point four fire fell that the people might know that God was the Lord okay now number five all the people acknowledg God as the Lord after the fire fell that's a little different too that's a because the Rapture is going to be a mystery it's going to be a showdown between denominations and Creeds and Jesus and we're with Jesus right but the Rapture is going to be a mystery and they're going to say peace and safety peace and safety Church they're not even going to hardly know that we're gone let's just say oh they're a bunch of Fanatics they went out to wherever or they just who cares they're all moved to somewhere else but this was uh known to everyone here and everybody answered on Israel's side and number the last one this all happened at the end of the three and a half years of famine and doesn't the Bible say in the last days there'll be a famine land for the hearing of the word of God how you know the Bible says that this is the time where people will fly all over the world trying to hear inspired preaching preaching that's right with the word and showing you the day and hour that you're living in and bringing you to to Christ and bringing you to Holiness but thank God we just got to drive down the road a little bit praise God let to fly all over the word now you could go to good message churches all around the world but God's given us one in all these cities we'll take advantage of that because this is a famine time but we're also hearing the word because God sent us spiritual food in due season amen glory amen now this is the one I want to read because some of these might be famili I'm sorry uh little maybe new to here but let's read more of these by God's grace this is the closer one now Mount Transfiguration Showdown was Matthew 17 1-9 now how many know this was the vision Jesus said tell this Vision to no man when you come down the mountain praise God and if you know the scripture God only called up three men to that Showdown Christ only called up Peter James and John everybody else missed it let's go to Luke chapter 9 let's read a little bit on Luke chapter 9 I was so blessed when I read this yesterday I thought oh my if feels like I never read this in the whole Bible isn't that how you are when you read the Bible you forget things and my pops out oh this is like it's brand new again glorious Luke 9 verse 27 but amen can you read 27 2829 but I tell you the truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God and it came to pass about an eight days after these saying he took Peter and John and jam James and went up unto the mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his rment was white and glister amen praise God you love that look Jesus foretold them he said some of you standing here are going to see the kingdom of God coming in power and about now the other one says after seven days so on the Eighth Day praise God the new beginning right eight is the new beginning the first day of the week on the eighth day he takes those three up and what are they going up on the mountain to do pray and as Jesus prays he's transformed oh if we could get a revelation of that church that as we pray we transform from the natural man into a supernatural one are you with me church that's why the Bible said be transform that word transform is the same Greek word for Transfiguration praise God you go from just regular to shining bright and Glory that's what the power of prayer does hallelujah it changes your spiritual garments if you're down in a scours it'll change you as you pray as you get in the spirit remember we did the Bible study where we build ourselves up on the Holy Ghost Brothers remember that we did the Bible study that's how you build your spiritual muscles up in Christ you pray the Holy Spirit and it builds up your faith and you become like Christ you become shining the glory of God to your family and to your workplace amen as he prayed the Transfiguration happens Hallelujah see the power of prayer so this was not a public Showdown this was a private Showdown I know stay with me here okay now it was foreshadowing the Rapture brother Ram said I'll show you the quotes on this because Jesus is glorified on this showdown Moses is glorified because he was uh he was resurrected and Moses represented the dead in Christ that rise first at the Rapture so this meeting of Moses Elijah and Jesus represents the rapture you have Jesus and you have the saints that are dead resurrected in perfect bodies and then Elijah represents the living who never died and they get glorified bodies as well oh Hallelujah and church all those years I went in the denominational churches and read the mount Transfiguration I never knew I was a part of that but brother brand said every one of us are a part of that scripture Hallelujah I'm a part of that word we must see ourselves in that word amen hallelujah it's a top of Mount Zion right type of Mount Zion so The Showdown was private and they battled the denominational Spirit of that day now let's first read in Finish reading Luke nine brother amen read those three okay anybody else want to read my children ready to read ma Mai can you read 30 31 [Music] 32 in of his he should were with him were heavy with sleep and then they were awake they saw his glory and the two menle with amen thank you now this is to help us here learn learn this as we pray in the spirit it transforms us does it not if not we better get back and pray again if our prayer is not transforming us humbling us making us more like Christ then we need to pray again we need to start all over right say Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed Be Your Name we need to start all over right but now after he prays and he's transfigured God sends these two prophets to him and they talk to him they reveal to him about the death he's about to accomplish they reveal these Messengers reveal more about the mystery of his life of his future going away time we'd say like that oh my Hallelujah but look Jesus isn't ready to receive it remember God ordains all things Jesus not ready to receive it till this time on his Mount Transfiguration Showdown God sends and look the spirit of Jesus Christ Christ is the spirit of what prophecy Jesus is being foretold you're going to have to go to the Cross you're going to have to go die in Jerusalem the The Messengers of God come to tell him about his future hasn't God done the same for us told us about our future praise God oh my we just got to stay with the word church stay with the word now thank you Malai for reading that Lydia Jeb yours okay D can you read 33 and 34 praise God you ever said something you don't didn't even know you said hello ever mutter something you're like oh did I just say that happens to me all the time I'm human right oh I didn't mean to say that Mercy I sometimes God is my witness even after the Holy Ghost people ask me questions and I'll tell a lie without even I didn't even know I told a lie that's wait no no no wait why did I say that for because there's sin in this body but thank God there's something to catch that sin when it comes out like I was just telling a wrong date like that was last week or oh that was yesterday oh why did I say that so Peter utters this he seeing all this happen Jesus changes as he prays my look at him change oh then Moses and Elijah can you imagine he's like Lord let's build three denominations here and he doesn't even know what he's saying sometimes we'll say some pretty strange things won't we but we should be saying the right thing he's in the presence of two uh two Messengers and Jesus Christ God himself he's in the presence of God and sometimes he says the wrong thing sometimes we say the wrong thing too don't we but isn't his grace there sufficient to help us praise God and church just so you know this was after he got the keys to the kingdom so look everybody falls everybody makes mistakes he doesn't even understand what he's saying let's build three Tabernacles let let's build three churches let's start an organization and verse 34 and while thus faake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud the Bible said they entered into the cloud you ever enter into a cloud before just if it's foggy that's it here they enter into a spiritual Cloud Glory a spiritual atmosphere hallelujah amen they actually enter into the cloud at the Mount Carmel Showdown they enter In This Cloud and then God starts said God starts speaking after that he said enough of you the Bible says in Matthew 17 that God interrupted Peter while he's talking so Peter's like uh three three denominations three denominations and God Thunders out this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him amen so God will shut us up God will interrupt us our foolish talking when we don't know what we're saying in order to get the word of cross don't worry that's not asking for your words God's word will be declared just wait on the Lord let me say like this just enter the cloud just pray with Jesus is that right just enter the cloud amen and people wonder well how that cloud out in Sunset M how could there be a cloud how could brother Brandon be caught up into that cloud it's scriptural hello Church oh how could brother brand be caught up in that cloud I don't know if the cloud he caught up to it or the cloud came down to him but he said he was caught up in a cloud and it's scriptural that prophets enter into clouds hallelujah amen Paul was I'm sorry Peter was a prophet was he not John was a prophet for telling the future prophets entered in the clouds Divine clouds of his holy presence God help us to enter in that kind of atmosphere this morning amen through prayer it'll be done through prayer it be done through believing the word hearing the word of God receiving the promises of God and who called this Mount Showdown or this uh Mount Transfiguration Showdown God himself called The Showdown now this was a private Showdown let's go to Matthew 17 here I'm doing pretty good on time this is more of a sermon on prophetic things that's good Bible teaching in there as well praise God let's be transformed when we pray praise God let's enter into that Holy Divine atmosphere of the Holy Spirit now I'm not going to read all these but we are going to read chapter 17 if you go back and read chapter 16 Jesus was constantly rebuking the Sadducees if you read that okay and also the Pharisees in fact the disciples Jesus rebukes them in those scriptures and and and Jesus says beware the the leav of the Pharisees and the disciples are so ambiguous to it they're not even aware it just goes over their head and they're like saying well don't eat their bread make sure you guys pack some unleavened bread all these things and Jesus come back and say it's not natural bread boys I'm not talking about about natural bread I'm talking about their false Doctrine right praise God we can be so we can be spiritual sometimes but sometimes we can be so carnal can't we church I gotta have this to make sure I feel better I gotta have that to make sure I feel better gotta have this to make sure I feel better sometimes we miss the very word of God go right over our head I gotta have this to make sure I can go in the Rapture gotta have this gota have this we need Christ Jesus is what we need and he'll bring us to it church he cannot fail if you leave all those if he didn't leave Enoch behind he won't leave you behind because you're ordained you're called This is the age of the rapture we must only believe now let's go to chapter 17 I just want to read that one 17 verse4 I want to make sure I quote get that one read by God's grace you have that scripture Austin you you got it oh it's okay that's good I'm on here oh 174 174 yeah thank you sir Matthew yes sir then answered Peter and said unto jesuslord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias praise God can you read verse five to you brother thank you while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him amen praise God so the battle here is between Jesus what's The Showdown who's the battle we saw the battling before Was Elijah against the Bale prophets what's the battle here well brother R tells us what the battle is here so I don't see any there's no Sadducees here there's no Pharisees here there's only three disciples Here with Jesus and two prophets what's the battle here look at what brother said right here we claim no glory for our own like on Mount Transfiguration where every one of us us is represented there so you were there you're rep you're you have a representation there someone at Mount Transfiguration represents you brother Benjamin Hallelujah Brother Scott somebody represents you brother Sunny somebody represents you on Mount Transfiguration it's Elijah amen and that's wonderful because we're we had Elijah Prophet for our day amen there was Moses the one that died and raised again there was Elijah the quickening Saints that'll be caught up in the last days oh they see them when they looked back they seen Jesus only now I'm going to skip past that's that's what I was showing brother said it's the Rapture now here now here's where he's saying what happened to you Pentecostals a few years ago you come out of that mess called denomination to make yourselves Pentecost so he's basically rebuking Pentecostalism right the very next quote he says now see Dayan if you now read number 16 at home if you never read that that's where they try to start the denomination Kora and daythan say oh we're all holy we can all go in the holies of holies you Moses and Aaron you have to do all the work and that's why they fall in their faces in humility uh desperation crying out for those men but the Bible said they got swallowed up in the Earth for trying to take a preacher's place right for trying to take a prophet's Place God help us to find our place and stay right there amen now Dayan had an idea that they could all make a great religion out of it you know even the Apostle Peter had that same idea on Mount Transfiguration what was the battle on Transfiguration the denominational spirit that was in The Bride right but yet not filled bride praise God it wasn't a public show it was a private Showdown but God had to interrupt Peter in the midst of his denominational thinking and say this is not gonna be a denomination this is going to be a living organism amen hallelujah so Peter had the same anointing that is that powerful Peter had the same denominational spirit that cor and Dayan had on him my goodness but God had mercy God didn't swallow up Peter in the earth God swallow up Peter with eternal life hallelujah what Grace Grace Grace God's grace more of Grace than know marvelous grace of our loving Lord amen Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt hallelujah thank you Jesus so can everybody see that now The Showdown was between the man who had the Keys of the Kingdom he had a denominational Fe on him and God had to rebuke him and cut him off and reveal his word right there so they would know and then Jesus said don't tell that vision of no man proving again it was a private Showdown all right praise God I'm coming up okay coming up now here's a few more things now I said this earlier jesus' body change took place during prayer praise God remember the prayer on the day of Pentecost while they're praying what happened the Holy Ghost fell they got a change on the inside now not not the physical body but they got a soul change during prayer the Bible said about the ninth hour that was The Hour of Prayer and sacrifice in Jerusalem where they blow the trumpets and start sacrificing that's the same hour the Holy Ghost fell amen oh my Hallelujah verse five the two prophets spake of Jesus death in Jerusalem with him okay now let's now let's go back if your Bible let's go back we read uh um we read uh Hebrews let's go back here if we can take scripture let's go to uh Galatians 4 now Galatians 4:25 let's read a few more scriptures about about Mount Zion I want to show you a few pictures of Mount Zion just you get an idea I always wonder where is Mount Zion I found out Israel has two really big mountains Mount Zion is the largest one and then Mount Mariah is the second one Mount Mariah is where the Temple Mount is that's where Jesus was crucified on Mount Mariah okay that's where Abraham took Isaac up there on Mount Mariah you can read that in Genesis that's in Genesis and that's why uh you know both Muslims and Jews and Christians all three of them claim that that's their holy place that's the H that's the Holy Mountain that's where God was dealing with Abraham which all three of them say they're they a father only Jews and Christians are right amen okay so L scripture now Galatians 4 now we read Hebrews 1222 I'm not going to read that again but we are come to Mount Zion how many know that's right and what is Mount Zion it's the Heavenly Jerusalem it's the city of the Living God which has an innumerable company of Angels the New Jerusalem Galatians 4 verse 25 for this AAR is Mount Si in Arabia and anth to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with their children so Mount Si represent the Jews under the law right but Grace is represented by the New Jerusalem verse 26 but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all praise God that new city is the mother of us all because we're going to live on that city right don't the babies live off their mother right that city is the mother of us all that's where same city Abraham was looking for Glory All God's Children are going to live off that City amen there's a tree of life in that City there's fruits every month in that City Hallelujah there's Rivers of Life flowing down there's mansions in that City Hallelujah that's the the mother of us all that's what's going to sustain us and keep us thank God for his Mercy thank God that we got a mother amen a New Jerusalem Mount Z amen hallelujah Glory now New Jerusalem is mentioned a few more times Hebrews 11 let's go to Hebrews 11 and let's look at verse I'm trying to limit I know where I'm going but I just kind of got to limit okay it's verse 14 Hebrews 11:14 for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country so just like Abraham we're seeking a country this is not our home Church don't let Aran Ohio wherever Pennsylvania wherever you live young down area don't let that really become your home let's let New Jerusalem be our home praise God because that's what we are come to the New Jerusalem that Heavenly City where Christ is the light and Christ uh there's no need of sun because Christ is the light thereof is that is that right where the Throne of God will sit verse 16 but now they desire a better country that is and Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for Heath prepared for them a city praise God this is Mount Zion the city that we're hearing from praise God the city that we've come to Hallelujah the C with innumerable Angels amen uh Revelation three let's go there Revelation 3 verse 12 Benjamin can you read that brother Revelation 3:12 okay not there okay I got it Revelation 3:12 him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God what Temple is that your mother New Jerusalem hallelujah amen and he shall go no more out and I write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I write upon him my new name Amen brother said ask what's that new name he said no man knows he said he knows he's lying only Jesus knows that name amen glory now go to Revelation 21 this now the whole chapter 21 is about the New Jerusalem if you never read it let's read verses 1 1 and two Revelation 211 and2 brother Sunny you got that I'm sorry brother I'm sorry I'm catching you guys off guard forgive me I'm just looking out there like who's got it who's got it let me guess do you have a sister Amy oh yeah 21 one and two yeah thank you brother sorry about that amen thank you sir sorry about that thank you okay so the new city is called a mother and it's also called a bride praise God see it so it's a city it's a it's a spiritual city of God where he's gonna place his bride in that City hallelujah amen that's beautiful praise God so that's the Mount Zion that's what we're coming to and brother and the Holy Spirit said we're coming to a Mount Zion Showdown to see who really is going to live in that City who really is the wife of Jesus Christ oh that's us amen it's those who believe the word amen who receive the prophet of the day if we receive the Forerunner then we'll receive the last one the real one who's to come that's Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so Jerusalem has both Mount Mariah now look at look at this naturally here's what the Bible dictionary says written in the 1800s of these two mountains that on the west Zion is higher and more massive I know Wendy's been there anyone else ever been there before nobody i' never been there either I'd sure like to be there okay I know I've come to Mount Zion because the Bible say I've come to Mount Zion I know I've been there Hallelujah spiritually on that which the city of Jerusalem now stands and in fact always stood the hill on the East Mariah is considered lower and smaller so that the to a spectator from the south the city appears to slope sharply towards the east so looks if you're looking North at jerusalm it kind of goes like this down okay so here's the picture a drawing of it Zion is the highest Mountain there and then it Mar a little bit lower and then it goes down and you have the Mount of Olives up here where Jesus you know went went up to pray up here on the Mount of ol now that's kind of a rough illustration here's a little bit better illustration and I'm sorry sorry if it's so hard to see yeah I'm sorry I should have made that bigger but Mount Zion's way over here new wall I don't even know what Jewish quarter is I'm not sure what the Armenian quarter is I know what the Temple Mount is that's where Solomon's Temple used to be praise God and on the Temple Mount here is the Dome of the Rock that's the shrine the MOs of Omar they call is that right MOS of Omar I get those mixed up okay so see how can everybody see how it's sloping down it's a little bit easy to see uh that's what that is so it's a little bit uh tricky if you're not quite sure because sometimes the word Zion refers to the that literal mountain of Zion right here the highest mountain there or other times in scripture Mount Zion refers to all Jerusalem and I had some examples but I don't have them I forgot to put them here but let's read this let's read psalms 243 who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord how many want to be in that uh New Jerusalem how many want to climb in that mountain oh my hallelujah amen I want to be translated in that mountain we don't have to climb it I like to be translated to the top of that mountain where Christ is who will go up to that mountain who shall stand in his holy place he that have clean hands and the Pure Heart who has not lifted up his soul unto vanity anybody think of some vain things in life video games can be vain praise God drinking cussing smoking movies can be vain meaningless the Bible says if you still cuss your religion is not real yet how many know that's in scripture we read that remember we read that on Monday morning because pure religion before before God is to visit the fatherless uh and and the widows remember that in scripture and to keep a man's tongue from evil praise God someone who doesn't lift up their soul into Advantage someone who invests their time in the right things Church invest your time in your you fathers invest your time in your children invest your time in your family is that right if you possibly can invest as much time in them because that's not a vain thing God loves family amen hallelujah put your time into things that matter like Jesus said labor not for the meat that perishes labor for the meat that's Eternal the word amen labor for that brothers that's what we need to labor for don't lift up our souls under vain things nor sworn to well I promise I'll do promise I'll do that and deceiving people the whole time if you don't mean it don't say it church right you're only as good as your word he so who the one that has Clean Hands and a pure heart he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from God of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face oh Jacob say you love that that's beautiful two more things as we close I just want to close the Bible conditions of the third and final showdown now turn to Revelation 1316 this is what we call around the message The Squeeze this is what we call around the message as the squeeze Revelation 13:16 now some of you that have been around I've read these quotes before I just want to read them again because this is all referring to the Mount Zion Showdown we've been through the Mount Caramel right we've been to the Mount Transfiguration now it's our turn Mount Zion Hallelujah to prove in a spiritual way who really is the Bride of Jesus Christ is denominations and Creeds the bride or someone who just loves the word the bride the one who loves the word hallelujah and the one that can live the word hallelujah that's right now Revelation 13:16 can anybody read that one for me Joseph okay sir he calls all both small and great rich and poor free and bond receive a mark in the amen praise to go praise God now how many know how many know that in the pick up your pen and right portion brother bam used this scripture to say that the bride would be forced to stop preaching how many know that let me read it to you I don't have it on the SL well maybe I do have it on the slide just bear with me here I didn't think I got to that I was woken at 3:30 a.m. by one of my children and couldn't go back to bed and then I fell back asleep and I got a pounding headache but I can be free from that in Jesus name right brother amen exactly right I thought I might had this in front of me okay this is the next one but let me let me uh let me read this this is not up here this is and pick up your pen after talking about Elijah Moses and John's Behavior I believe someday the real bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of God the Bible prophesies of it in Revelation 13:16 brother BR said well sorry the spirit of God says brother says he want to put that down denominations will force it to stop or take its Mark then when the lamb will take his bride and judge the for this praise God you love the Lord amen so that's one scripture that brother Ram says proves a squeeze here's where he says it right after preaching this now he gets done with a pick up your pen and right says do you believe why is this been have you a better understanding now that's why I ask everybody do you understand now because I want you to understand it's the word friends this has been about six hours right close five and half or six hours there is so much more could be said but surely the Holy Spirit by this time has sunk it so deep in you that you know what I'm talking about we are at the end time the seeds are SED now the latter rain is fixing to come forth praise God which is what the Mount Zion Showdown that will be in the latter ring where the power of the Holy Ghost Falls in a great way but say the third pole will be operating during that Mount Zion showdown in a greater way he said when the council begins to tighten up it'll be operating in a greater way at that time now look now this is immediately after remember there will be such a denominational Gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific and they will bring themselves together this Federation of churches and then this kind of a church will be put out of operation as far as they know I like that amen if they lock the doors on this church well they'll think they have us out of operation but the True Church of God will keep on operating whether we got emails or texts or not we'll keep operating why because we'll be in touch with Jesus Christ through prayer that transforms Our Lives it'll change our minds it'll get us in tune with Christ to make ready for the mount Z Showdown and he'll communicate that the dead in Christ are going to arise and then when we see them it's not long until our change is coming too amen will be operating church as far as they think they'll think they shut down the church a bride of Christ Fellowship but she keeps on moving on she's an eternal Church she's an eternal bride amen always be the Bride of Jesus Christ it's at that time brother brandom says that Jesus will appear and he will show which is his bride and which is not and remember Christian friends I a man I can make mistakes I like that some people say brother can't make mistakes said I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the word that's been written must be fulfilled Jesus said so so we got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boyot to come wow I I listened to this before I preached on this before and I read over yesterday I'm like oh my goodness he just said the boycott is scriptural and I went glory to God Amen I knew it was written pick up your pen right but here he says this is not something this is Boycott is actually in the scripture and he told us where it is Revelation 13:16 but there's another Revelation 3:10 let's turn there I'm trying to close Revelation 3:10 brother BR said it's scriptural the boycott is in the Bible he says and the Holy Spirit said it as well and pick up your pen and right okay Revelation 3:10 amen can you read that sir you got your Bible right there you're ready to go because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to them to try them that dwell upon the Earth amen praise God thank you brother now so Church it looks like through some of these script these two scriptures we have now remember in the mouth of what every two or three Witnesses right every word be established so to pick up your pen says Revelation 13:16 the quote we set up there said that's a boycott is in the scripture and Revelation 3:10 is another witness to us that because we've kept the word he's going to keep us from the hour of Temptation the hour temptation is when the Beast pushes the tries to push the mark of the beast out on everybody and they have to make a choice so they can take the mark of the beast or not right that's right to try them upon the the whole world the Bible says now here's what brother Ram said here this is in 1960 the Philadelphian Church age brother Ram reads this scripture and here's what he said because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour Temptation the church is going to come to a place where you're going to have to get in this organization or you're going to have or you're not going to have it all that's all you're either going to be organized or take the mark of the beast either gonna to organize it or go to denomination which is actually coming the mark of the beast because it's a boycott remember this is December 10 L his birthday 1960 he says that he said this shall come upon the whole world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold fast to that which thou Hast that no man take away thy Crown he say now this great Temptation the our Temptation that shall come to try the whole world goes into the tribulation he says we'll see it it goes on tribulation this tribulation not come in the days of Wesley so where are we at what's this door set before he said this is where the church is headed right now and already in to L see Church age but this little place right in here within the last 30 or 40 years has been an open door he talking about his his brandom Tabernacle this little church has been an Open Door sitting right there before the people to come in and God will take the remnant and seal it off amen and they'll just go into a lukewarm and he'll spurt them out of his mouth the work will be cut short up goes the church and here comes the Antichrist Spirit moving in for Destruction just perfect fits the whole Bible right on around you love the Lord let me close with this there so there's a possible brother ra puts this in the church age book there's a possible minor persecution because the minor persecution will just be something like trying to shut the doors forcing people to stop preaching right but the persecution can't be the Great Tribulation because God would never let his bride go through that is that right would you let your bride or your spouse go through awful like that no they already was they're already forgiven they're already Justified why would they have to go through such trials as that they don't have to but they got to come up to a showdown Hallelujah they got to come to a showdown and God's got to show who's who who's really the bride and who's not that's why we ought to be pressing in as hard as we possibly can you haven't prayed long in a while you better start praying long we better start praying right we haven't been feeding on the word like we ought to there's no better time like right now praise the Lord feasting on the word of of God here's what he saids in the church age book this may seem farfetched to some but actually it's very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics you know that churches are controlling our politics right now and at the opportune time we'll manifest exactly how great is that control this economical move will end up with Rome at the head even though the people did not Envision it that way this is so because Revelation 17 3-6 it states that the mystery Babylon is Seated on the Beast okay so what is the Beast the Beast is the spirit of Rome what's the image of the Beast the World Council of churches so the World Council churches is the visible image of the spirit of Rome that wants to swallow up divide and conquer and take over the whole world but the woman the Roman Catholic Church rides on top of that beast and who's the head of that woman the pope she's controlling the last or fourth Empire this Roman Church is doing that with the World Church system under her Rome I'm sorry under her Rome will be controlling and this image the church system will be Obed to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world thus all people have to belong to the World Church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the land hand or head here's what the mark of the beast is everyone wants to be talked about the bible study this week this Mark in the head means they'll have to take the doctrine of the world Church system which is trinitarianism ETC it's also universalism right everybody's going to be saved no matter what church you're in you're going to be saved now the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the World Church now it might come down to computer chip right might come down to something like that but it's a spiritual Mark Cain was marked spiritually right he was marked spiritually and so he get now they're going to get a mark in their head for the doctrine and a mark in the hand means to do the will of the church instead of the will of God's word with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride that's what brother R allowed to be written in his book he said he read it over all those years this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching Etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and Truth to the people who need it but before the Antichrist in person takes over this complete World System of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper the lamb let's stand to our feet Hallelujah there is a showdown coming Church let's bow our heads if we can there is a showdown coming God is going to show who's his bride and who's not his bride the way to be ready we've been preaching on Wednesdays the way to be ready is to love God with all your heart soul mind and strength Jesus said the one who loves me are the one who keeps my commands the ones who keep not my commands do not love me how many want to be ready for the Mount Zion Showdown and want to be in the bride God bless those hands praise God the Bible said the spear and the bride say come let us pray Heavenly Father Lord our hands Lord are up Lord this is such a striking thing Lord God the first Showdown was public the last to her private [Music] Lord it was Private there where Lord your great voice corrected the man with the Keys of the Kingdom show them that Christ will overcome and Conquer every denominational spirit for our day Lord we're told and it's it's prophesied Lord that the church systems will try to shut down the true preaching of the word of God first my prayers Lord help us to preach the true word of God help me to preach it dear God help me to stand like a soldier help me to stand with the full armor of God on the helmet of salvation the feet shy with preparation of the gospel of peace the belt of truth about my loins dear God

God if the people have needs may they bring them to you Lord God may they pray to you now Lord is Lord no doubt in the group of this many there's needs Lord God some of them need to repent Lord God
