TRANSCRIPT
========================================
back. You're just hearing things and you're you're seeing things and you're like, man, Lord, amen. So, keep on putting your passion behind worshiping and loving the Lord, loving the word, and uh God will finish the rest. Uh we I know this seems like to be a Smith tendency as far as Brother Jesse and I, maybe, Brother Simon. We don't we we've never really tried to be anything. We just want to be Christians and along the way we we make mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes. We we do some things right, too. [laughter] Uh but uh don't don't ever let the don't ever let the devil tell you that uh God is not in control. He's in control. And uh I believe we're we're very close to something uh tremendously powerful. And uh with the help of the Lord, it will live. It will live very soon. And uh I know this uh we had brother Jesse months ago there and we'd sure like to keep him and uh even if he came without his beautiful children but uh uh I know everyone was so blessed when he come and uh everyone uh has really enjoyed brother Jesse's gift over the years and it's done mighty things in our church. Uh I remember a lot of you came over and were dancing and having a good time. You youngans, don't lose that. and hold right on to it. And uh remember that dancing is a victory. So that's not necessarily uh you know your victory don't come by sight. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Your victory comes because of revelation, &gt;&gt; right? You get it. You know it. You believe it. [laughter] So uh we'll just try to do the best we can tonight. Uh we'll just bring a little thought forward here. And uh it looks like I am on there. Let's see if we can get that up. Uh I'm just preaching a few sermons that I've preached at home recently that have just uh been uh just really uh life-changing to me. Uh the whole series I feel like this series I've been on, I preached uh preached 28 sermons uh on the body of Jesus Christ. Uh trying to get the church all settled out and uh and uh you know to some aspect I'm uh it's beyond me what the Lord is doing. Uh just in the last several months I've had I Lord just gave me a vision and gave me some things like that. So I'm moving in some areas I'd like to be in. Uh but that's your area too. We're all part of that move of God because you're the body of Jesus Christ. Uh so whatever you can do, just keep on uh working and pushing towards the same goal. Amen. I I would love it. I would love it to see uh uh speakers in tongues, interpreters of tongues, that prophetic gift moving forward. Amen. And uh and that's part of this, isn't it? Amen. Uh so that's actually a big part of it. Uh uh but yet uh God is that in this season, but uh the first season is we just got to love God with everything we got. Amen. &gt;&gt; So uh just love the word as much as you love worship. And I'll tell you what, everything's going to be all right around here. Uh because you saints sure know how to worship. And I I really love that. Uh we're going to go to Joshua 1:10 and Romans 4:1. Uh greetings from the saints back at uh Napoleon there. Uh, I know you guys get to see Brother Simon a lot a lot more than you see Pastor Cam here. But, uh, I'm glad that I could be here. And, uh, we we did it years ago. We had a little a little, uh, uh, community church service together. So, uh, you guys come our way or however we can do. And we've actually talked about over the years, maybe finding a middle point somewhere and just, uh, just having a having a little group church. I like that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe we can work something around. not not much for memory, [laughter] not much for scheduling, but uh I know this I've spoken these words out to people who are perhaps more gifted much gifted and more gifted in that area than I am currently at the age of 46. [laughter] So let Lord let it be upon your hearts. Uh don't be afraid to talk to your pastor about those things if you desire it. And uh I know this we really need a revival and uh God's bringing that. He's absolutely going to bring that. Just hold on. Keep on holding on because it's going to happen. I I am convinced. Uh I'm seeing God answer my prayers. [laughter] And I don't know why or how. Uh because honestly, I don't see myself any different today than what I did 20 years ago. And that's what we're going to work with tonight. Joshua 11:0. And this morning I started working with your smile. I'm gonna keep working with that smile. Got girls got beautiful smiles. Somebody's got some beautiful smiles up in here. All right. Yeah, I got a big gap in my teeth. So, you got to be better than me. Anyway, some one time somebody's just looking for a way to rip on me and they couldn't even think of it. And they said, "Well, at least I don't got a big gap between my two teeth." And I'm like, "Amen. That's all you got? Hallelujah. Let it be." [laughter] But Joshua 1:10, it says here, it says, "Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, "Pass through the host and command the people, saying, prepare you vituals uh for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land uh which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it." Amen. Uh we're going to talk tonight about crossing through this Jordan. And I hope I can bring this at a different angle uh than perhaps that you've thought of or heard of. And I believe that this will be a blessing to you. Um I may give a testimony because there's a brother who has been uh participating our sermons and as far as he's far away, but he's been participating in that. But but there's been a revolutionary change in his life. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm seeing this individual like I've never seen before. And I'm strengthened by it. You can actually pull strength off other people by what God does for them. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, but but I'll tell you what, I'm seeing the change in me now. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Romans 4:1. I'm gonna talk about you message believers tonight. &gt;&gt; What is a message believer? What are we talking about? It's going to be a little bit way that a little different way that we might work with this, but I hope this is all right. &gt;&gt; Romans 4:1 says, "What shall we say then that Abraham our f our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found?" What are you going to find pertaining to your flesh? What are you looking for? For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. That glory would only be for himself. This thing is election, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; For what saith the scripture, Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. Did you get that? &gt;&gt; So if God sees you righteous right right now, how? Because you believe what? Are we in the right type of church here? &gt;&gt; Because we believe. &gt;&gt; Uh oh. Maybe I should change subjects real quick. Not to him that workketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. So when it becomes something you're working, is it going to be reckoned of grace or debt? Debt. Oh, looks like you need a release. &gt;&gt; I'll have to preach that. Oh, I already did. &gt;&gt; But to him that workketh not workketh not. Oh, this is getting difficult. But believeth on him that justifith the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. This evening we're going to work with crossing Jordan to Ephesians u with a topic of law to grace. Uh let's bow our heads for a word of prayer and I I I just want to just believe this with all my heart because I'm watching it change me. I want it to change you and perhaps you're already there. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we just love you. We're asking, oh God, that you just uh bless the reading of your word tonight. Lord, bring forth your spirit again just like it was here this morning. Lord, I I' I've come to a place, oh God, where I I just expect it. And I know, God, there's nothing I've done to earn any of it. It's election, Lord. We have received you because of election. You first loved us. And we're asking this evening, oh God, that you just allow this revelation to be great upon the people that they'd be able to move forward in a way, oh God, that perhaps an experience they've never really lived under. But we want to live under this, Lord. And we believe that we're ordained for it. So we're asking, oh God, that you just turn our hearts and our minds to the true revelation of Jesus Christ. Uh for the glory in your name, we just ask that you'd be in the midst as we say, "Amen." May be seated. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Got to get a little stuffy on that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, just a little while ago, a brother really got stirred up and he he was he was kind of working with that and he and he caught this revelation that changed him. And that that revelation was actually uh it was something God-given. Uh but I'll just rehearse just a little bit with you. uh he had always uh of course looked at the gospel through a message lens so to say as far as what is perceived, what is taught, what is received and uh one day the the Lord just kind of started working with him at Genesis 3 and he and he found that uh there was something there uh because what he seen was that the serpent would eat dust. the serpent when he went on his belly, he was going to eat dust. And he he also seen that Adam was formed from the dust. But the powerful little thought that that rolled of it uh which is so awesome is that when God brought the curse when man fell, did God place that on Adam, the curse? He didn't. He actually cursed the ground. He didn't curse Adam. Why? He couldn't curse Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam was a product of God. And this revelation so struck the brother because what it did was he constantly and you and I constantly look at this thing feeling like we can get this under control. feeling like we can tame it, &gt;&gt; you know, we can say it right, we can live it right. We are a bunch of message robots. &gt;&gt; We're all the same. We walk perfect, undefiled, no manner of folly in our midst ever. Because we are the chosen, we are the elect. We are the thoroughbreds. But what the revelation that this brother got, he got the revelation that God actually cursed the flesh. Meaning what? You can't tame it. You ever try to tame a wild animal? You can't. &gt;&gt; You can try, but that thing's going to kick in at some point in time. I've heard people have issues with them. They say, they said, "We told them they could never tame that thing because one day that animal just goes back to being wild." Look at people that get tigers and and lions, all these things like that and bears. Bears, it never works out very good for the most part, right? &gt;&gt; Because they're trying to tame something wild. &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD BROUGHT THIS REVELATION to him, he said, it just opened up that God isn't even looking at his flesh because he is NOT HIS FLESH. GOD IS ACTUALLY looking at who he really is. &gt;&gt; You know that which desires God. &gt;&gt; That seed that God placed inside that saw how it come from God &gt;&gt; and it will go back to God and it set him free in such a way that I haven't seen him the same since. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh I want to begin to work with this idea uh because uh I literally went to a brother's house after that and I I just mentioned that part and the Holy Spirit just fell on me. I felt the Holy Ghost just come on me and all of a sudden my mouth goes for like an hour and a half just rolling and it just kept on opening because brother, sister, let's hit this like we did this morning. Shouldn't we be really happy people? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shouldn't we be super excited to hear the word? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, if we're living by it, it ought to bring more smiles than Chipotle. I know. I know. I know. I know. Disclaimer. But this word that we eat, what should it do to us? &gt;&gt; RIGHT, BROTHER? &gt;&gt; SO, WHY AREN'T we happy as far as like we OUGHT TO BE? WHY AREN'T WE SATISFIED LIKE we ought to be? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? AS OUR BROTHER I HEARD HE'S PREACHING on first Corinthians FINISHING THAT UP. WHY ARE WE NOT SEEING the moving of the spirit like we ought to? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this is where we begin. Because even Israel dwelling in the wilderness, they had to come to an Ephesians. And tonight we want to work with crossing Jordan to Ephesians. And remember, Jordan is a death to self. But how do we inter interpret this? We've come to the place that we believe or we try to so constrain ourselves to being perfect. We want TO JUST BE DEAD ON EVERY TIME BECAUSE WE LOVE GOD. SO WE BEGIN THIS war and it literally becomes such a strain on us &gt;&gt; as we're trying to live for God and fail at the same time &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS THING IS ALWAYS GETTING AN EDGE ON US &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE PAUL WHEN HE SAID HE HE SAID OH OH THE THIS FLESH THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO DO I CAN'T DO RIGHT AND THE THINGS THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO THESE THINGS I DO SO EVEN THE FIRST church age messenger could not tame this thing &gt;&gt; AND AND GOD SO ANOINTED HIM IN A letter to the Romans that he would admit these things. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T TAME IT. YOU SEE, WE WE get this. What's your picture of Mo of the Apostle Paul? He's upright man, perfect in every every social statement, in every action that he does. But yet we see that the Corinthian church or brother Jesse went through that what they were actually blasting Paul because his presence was weak, timid. &gt;&gt; He wasn't this great asserting leader. Follow me. Open not thy mouth. HE WAS NOT THAT TYPE OF AN INDIVIDUAL. &gt;&gt; Instead he come in actually. Hi everybody. God bless you. Lord bless you, sister boy. Nice to see you. AND WE'RE THERE EXPECTING HIM AT EVERY TURN. DOMINATE. Dominate this con this conversation. Show me the word. &gt;&gt; Be the great leader we want. And they looked at him and they said, "What we this? Who is this clown?" &gt;&gt; So what is death to self? Here's Jordan River. Hey, there's some baptisms. That's nice. Now, watch this. We're going to begin to go through some things here. Now, watch this. In the breach, he works with it. He says, he says, "Another thing a seal signifies is ownership." The seal has a mark on it shows ownership. When you are bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost, you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world. Now, now, now let's catch this. When you are bought, he has to receive your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And notice what that produces. It takes you from belonging to the world, &gt;&gt; sir. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let's jump down. So, and the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken. You have all heard me say that. People said, "The devil made me do this." I've heard people SAY THAT. THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT. MY FLESH MADE ME DO IT. NOW WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. NO, NO, THE DEVIL DIDN'T do it. &gt;&gt; You just wasn't sealed in. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So then you see cuz when you're sealed in, he's sealed out. &gt;&gt; This is going TO BRING SOME SMILES TO YOUR FACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU WENT OUT TO HIM. HE COULDN'T GET INTO YOU because the only way he get into you is COME THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS that you'd have. &gt;&gt; You get into that promised land. &gt;&gt; He can't get to you. [laughter] &gt;&gt; BUT WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? &gt;&gt; You see how it's actually a revelation? &gt;&gt; Have you become unattached to this? This will live out. Brother, sister, God, help me. God help me to say it right. He'd have to be saved, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost, then he'd be your brother. Anybody want Satan as your brother? No. I think he's done. I think he's done. All your sins, everything, every sin you have, Brother Bram said, that's going to go back to the devil judgment day. &gt;&gt; Ain't that exciting? &gt;&gt; He ain't your brother. [laughter] You just went, now watch how he says this. You just went to the borderline and came back lusting for the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He never went all the way over into Canaan. YOU SEE, ACROSS JORDAN, the death to self, &gt;&gt; you're never going to be able to do what you want to do. We would like to think from a religious uh uh uh avenue that we would be able to control this thing how we'd like to. Brother sister, I [screaming] HAVE SPENT 20 ODD SOME YEARS now on this message trying to make be perfect. I want to be perfect. Now think about this. THE BIBLE SAYS I HAVE TO BE PERFECT. A a A BISHOP OR MUST be blameless. Just me and you, buddy. But we all want to do that because Jesus said in uh uh John 5:48, he said what? Be perfect AS YOUR FATHER IN HEAVEN ALSO IS PERFECT. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE MADE THAT TO MEAN IS I'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT. I'VE GOT TO BE PERFECT. I'VE GOT TO DO THIS. &gt;&gt; But isn't it something? The harder you try, the more I'm happy. You believe that, right? See, it went back to normal. See, I'm happy. And what? We try to mask something in an act when we're really not happy. Why aren't we happy? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it all comes to this Jordan is really what's going on. Let's let's spend a little time with this now. Watch. This is actually incredibly deep message. And I and I I obviously just going to touch it. But he says as I was speaking last night on the Ephesians how that the book of Joshua is the Ephesians of the Old Testament and how it was a book of redemption. And redemption has two parts. Come out of and entering into. All right. First you have to come out. Some people wants now see how he does this. Some people wants to bring the world in with them. But you got to come out of the world to enter into Christ. &gt;&gt; We see message believers like that. They want they want everything world, right? &gt;&gt; That's okay. There's going to be people LIKE THAT. GOD OPENED THEIR EYES, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But you know, sincere Christians, we don't want the world. &gt;&gt; I don't want the world. &gt;&gt; I SPENT 20OME YEARS JUST TRYING TO BE PERFECT. BUT I FOUND OUT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT DOESN'T MAKE PEOPLE like you. It doesn't make people accept you. It doesn't make you give you any great favor with God for him to give you gifts, visions, or whatever like that. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Then what is death to self? I'm gonna have fun with this. I hope you're having fun already. Oh, I'm smiling. Oh, I'm sm I didn't have to prop this one up. It just come. He says you have to come out of unbelief to enter into faith. faith. There cannot be one thing in your way. To really have genuine faith, you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of God behind to enter into faith. You have to come back to the word. Now, I don't know about you, we can interpret this that we have to have our flesh 100% perfect because we have to come out of uh everything that's contrary to the word. Well, what's we didn't he just say faith? &gt;&gt; Didn't he say I mean, shouldn't it say flesh? [laughter] &gt;&gt; This is powerful. Watch this. And that was the book of of the Ephesians of the Old Testament. Joshua where Moses represented the law could not save no one but grace could. And here Joshua is the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior. All right. Now I'm going to show this in just a minute. And now then we find out that we have come to another Ephesians when 65 the preaching of the ministry. Now notice uh did that HAPPEN IN 63 55 52 WHERE AT IN 65 he believed that they were coming to another Ephesians another Ephesians now where that in our intellectual denominations and so forth and all of our educational programs has come to its Jordan. THEN WE MUST HAVE AN EPHESIANS. AGAIN, WATCH THIS. WE MUST HAVE AN Exodus to come out and to go into for the rapture. So, where we're at, we're looking for an Ephesus. &gt;&gt; We want to come out of just just some sort of message system that we're part of. But notice TO COME BACK TO THE FULL WORD, YOU'VE GOT TO LEAVE your intellectual denominations, your educational programs. THEY THAT'S YOUR JORDAN. YOU HAVE TO die to the things that are contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Meaning what? YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR FAITH in that. It's what gets ME IN A LOT OF trouble because I've moved away from a lot of those things. I found out camp meetings are from the Presbyterian church. It's not in the Bible. VBS, it's it came from the Baptist or SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ALL OF THOSE ACTUALLY HAD A DENOMINATIONAL starting point. &gt;&gt; And sure, IT WORKS TO WHAT? TO DRAW PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. because people love those type of gatherings. &gt;&gt; BUT WHY IS IT NOT PRODUCING ACTS TWO? &gt;&gt; WHY DO THE PEOPLE I'VE HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE, MANY PEOPLE FROM MY from the church THAT I PASTOR GO TO ALL THOSE THINGS? THEY'LL GO AND TELL ME HOW GREAT OF A TIME IS AND THEY COME BACK and just like this. I &gt;&gt; I had a I had a young man come go to one of those things. He came back on fire for God. is the last time you ever come to church. He told me he told me he re he he was so uh had the anointing so much on him that he got the Holy Ghost and then left church has never went back to church since. Well, brother Cam, that's just one example. But honestly, what that is is it's a denominational program. &gt;&gt; What's coming back to the word do? said, "I'm not I'm not demonizing those things, but but you you hear a lot of people, oh, that's the me that's the marriage camp or that's this or that." See, everything has this positional placement where we in our system can can uh cohabitate with one another and make things work. But brother, sister, there's only one thing I want to see work. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine every young person here was filled with the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE. AMEN. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. AMEN. AND BROTHER, SISTER, YOU SEE, many times we think we have to do something to get something. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. I I' I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, I GO HERE BECAUSE THEY NEED FELLOWSHIP, RIGHT? MY CHILDREN NEED FELLOWSHIP." OR, "WELL, WELL, you know what? THERE'S NO ONE THERE THAT THAT I CAN MARRY. WHY DON'T WE MARRY JESUS CHRIST OR FIND CHRIST AND THEN LET CHRIST ADD ALL THOSE THINGS? OH, that's not the systematic approach, is it? &gt;&gt; And then we find out what it produces. And now it makes sense. But did you see that the true Jordan River? Moses represented law couldn't save, but grace could. And Joshua is the same word like Jesus, Jehovah Savior. Who took them over into the promised land? Joshua. Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost. And what? Wait, wait, wait. Joshua parallels Ephesians. So the Ephesians is actually the Holy Ghost taking us over. I want you to see this today. This has nothing to do with you. This is election. If anything, you better see election. [laughter] Hallelujah. Uh, children, there's a reason why God had you born in that family, [laughter] children, there's a reason that GOD GAVE YOU THE PARENTS HE GAVE YOU. AMEN. [laughter] HALLELUJAH. IT'S A WHAT? IT'S TO PRODUCE THE ELECTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 7:18. Now, watch this. Uh, let's just jump down here. Uh, no, let's start here. For there's a verily a disanoling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofit unprofitableness thereof. You're telling me that the commandment was what? The weakness and the profitess, right? What what did the law do? The Bible says the law made you know that you were a sinner. &gt;&gt; It completely took your freedom away. &gt;&gt; I'm hitting an approach tonight. I want you to see this because if you're looking for Christ, we've looked at it most of the time the wrong way. For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did. By the which we draw nigh unto God. This law, you follow this law, it can't, it ain't going to do anything. Can it make you perfect? No. That's why James came in and said, why? You offend in one point, you're guilty of the whole. &gt;&gt; Just one. It's all you need is one. Yeah, Lord did that today. But when we look at what the Lord does, he comes down here. This is a powerful spot in Ephesians and I got to hurry. It says, "And when we are dead in in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace are ye are saved." He said, "And hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." So that grace, that salvation grace should make us sit in heavenly places. Anybody ever read the adoption message? What's the heavenly places? That's all nine spiritual gifts and the power of God moving. &gt;&gt; That's heavenly places. &gt;&gt; True grace produces that. Hallelujah. That in the ages to come, he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Jesus Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith. God has to put something in you called faith. Hallelujah. AND THAT NOT OF YOURSELVES. It is the gift of God. YOU'RE ONLY SAVED BY FAITH. AND THAT EVEN IN ITSELF IS A GIFT. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHY DO I [screaming] BELIEVE? HE GAVE IT TO YOU to believe. HE CALLED YOU OUT. THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU HEAR THIS MESSAGE, you what? BROTHER BRAM SAID, AND YOU SEE THAT IT'S EAGLE'S FOOD. He said, "You've heard from your theophony." [laughter] The true revelation of the word reveals to you that YES, YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WHICH SHOULD BE WHAT? FAITH. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something how how many times especially when we when we think and da da and and what the devil brings? Oh, you're a serpent or yeah, you're a failure. You're never going to be more than that. Oh, you're a loser. Oh, oh, you've got all these problems you'll never overcome. And he wants to keep you in this spot where you're looking at this. &gt;&gt; Because if he can keep you there, then what can faith do? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Think about it. If our faith would have lined up with love for God this morning, what would have happened? Hallelujah. It's coming. It's coming. The word is opening it. It's going to work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he continues. He says, but then uh uh let's go to the 11th verse. He said, "But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God." It is evident. FOR THE JUST SHALL LIVE by faith. &gt;&gt; WE LIVE BY FAITH. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe that the Lord has healed our brother's a mother. I believe that. I BELIEVE GOD'S GOING TO SAVE THESE NEIGHBORS. AMEN. We believe that God is going to fulfill these things. Amen. But then uh uh it says uh but and the law is not of faith. See how contrary they are. The law is not of faith, but the man that doeth them shall live in them. Okay. Okay. I finally got my Armenianism in there. Hallelujah. Something I can do. But what does that actually mean? The man that doeth them shall live in them. Well, that's the first challenge that we must see is that what is that? Okay, one more faith one, then we'll get to it. Notice we have the Bible telling us how our father Abraham was accepted. He says, "For he is not a Jew, Romans 2:28, which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is out which is outward in the flesh, but he is a Jew which is one inwardly. And circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So notice circumcision availth nothing. that natural portion. [laughter] IT'S NOT WHAT OUTWARD IN THE FLESH. The real circumcision is that of the heart &gt;&gt; which works by faith. Thank you, pastor. &gt;&gt; Very good. Amen. Notice, blessed is a man whom the Lord will NOT IMPUTE SIN. &gt;&gt; HE WON'T EVEN IMPUTE SIN ON YOU. I CAN'T MAKE THIS PERFECT. IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER. HE'S NOT EVEN IMPUTING IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING WE WANT TO BE WICKED PEOPLE. DON'T GET ME WRONG. AMEN. I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY WE CAN JUST DO WHATEVER WE WANT. Uh uh let grace abound or let sin abound that grace may uh that grace could cover. Right? We're not looking for that. &gt;&gt; But let's try to get this lined up. Watch this. And he received, Abraham received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcision circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed unto them also. Isn't that something? Did you see that? SO HE actually was called RIGHTEOUS BEFORE HE GOT the seal. &gt;&gt; His righteousness WAS SEEN BY GOD. HOW? BY THE FLESH. [laughter] HALLELUJAH. His His what? HIS FAITH WAS VIEWED BY GOD AS HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SAY. LORD SIR, &gt;&gt; REVEAL YOUR WORD TO [screaming] ME. I BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT'S SHOWING. HALLELUJAH. UH, BAPTISM in the NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; He will fill ME WITH THE HOLY GHOST CUZ I DID IT. I BELIEVE IT. HE'LL DO IT. &gt;&gt; But just like Abraham, it doesn't mean he'll do it when you want. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes God lets that to see if you really believe. Just like that promised son that had to come forward. So when we look at actually the crossing over on Jordan, let me tell you this. HOW DID THEY actually cross Jordan? They're all really good swimmers. Sister, are you good swimmer? Maybe we can swim across this. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Was it was it BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE SO TALENTED? They're these great Christians. No, we actually find that when the transition went to Mo to to Joshua who was grace, Joshua actually brought them through. &gt;&gt; But notice what bridged them into the promised land. OUR PROPHET SAID IT WAS THE WILDERNESS WAS LAW, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GRACE WAS THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this? And notice, JORDAN WAS A DEATH TO SELF, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT BRIDGED THEM THROUGH? What bridged them through from law to grace? The word. Because watch, God sent the ark in the middle of the JORDAN AND SPREAD IT. And notice this experience WAS LITERALLY AS I WAS WITH MOSES, SO I'LL BE WITH YOU JOSHUA. &gt;&gt; GOD COULD SPLIT THE RED SEA WITH MOSES AND GOD SPLIT THE JORDAN River for the children of God. &gt;&gt; BUT WATCH THIS. THAT ARK WAS THE LIVING WORD. &gt;&gt; WHO'S GOING TO BRING YOU INTO THE EPHESIANS? &gt;&gt; Who's going to bring THIS LION ANOINTING UH MOVING ON YOU? FORMER AND LATTER RAIN, ALL OF IT PRODUCING SIR. IT IS GOD HIMSELF [screaming] THAT BROUGHT THEM TO DEATH TO SELF TO grace the promised land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what's the issue then brother Cam? It's what we perceive this to be death to self because we like to forget about this. We like law, grace. Did you get that? Did you see what I covered? I don't know if you know this. This is not you. This is God. &gt;&gt; What did they actually have to do? &gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you. Did they have to listen to the word and believe it? Absolutely they did. [laughter] JOSHUA SAID, "THREE DAYS SET UP BECAUSE WE'RE CROSSING JORDAN." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THEY DID. THEY BELIEVED IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And and and biblically, uh uh uh Joshua told THEM, "STAY STAY 2,000 CUBITS BEHIND THE ARK BECAUSE YOU YOU'VE never been this way and you NEED TO SEE WHICH WAY IT GOES." &gt;&gt; THEY HAD to let the word set the standard that they could walk through there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about this. Who is going to get YOU TO THE POSITIONAL PLACEMENT? WHO'S GOING TO get you TO TAKE THE WALLS OF JERICHO DOWN? WHO'S GOING TO GET YOU TO FIGHT AN INVINCIBLE BATTLE AGAINST THE DEVIL? &gt;&gt; IT IS THE ARK. THE LIVING WORD WILL SEE YOU THROUGH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; SO, what we do is we say, "Oh, I've got the Holy Ghost." and or oh God is God is getting me somewhere or God is doing this and we're judging everything by what we see on here. &gt;&gt; But isn't it funny? It's not funny. Isn't it odd that when we look into Acts two when the Holy Spirit fell on them in Acts five it says that what? It says that great grace was given to them. Said no man dur join themselves to them but great grace was given to them. Why did they need a great grace? because this thing still didn't look right. [laughter] &gt;&gt; What are we looking at? What do we perceive the baptism of the Holy Ghost is? Oh, well, I know so and so's got the Holy Ghost because they talk about the word and they do this and they're this, this, that, and the other. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Oh, you mean like the one that just left the message several years ago here who was more versed in the message than all of us probably combined almost. Had the biggest church. &gt;&gt; The other brother did the same thing. Had this great anointing, super gifted, and we found out they never had the Holy Ghost to begin with. &gt;&gt; I remember hearing of the second one. I remember hearing things where he was trying to show how perfect he was towards his flesh to to show the others what they ought to be and then within a year or two he leaves the word. I thought he had the Holy Ghost. Oh, he could live a perfect life to some extent, &gt;&gt; but he never crossed Jordan. &gt;&gt; And these are the people that are pastoring. And the people have no idea that the person they're following doesn't even have the Holy Ghost. Well, how would I judge that? Because they're perfect. Nope. No, no. I just hammered that one. &gt;&gt; We lost our smile. Why is there Who is our smile at? Now, I'm going to get into this. When you watch this type of where we're at, Joshua, parallels, Ephesians, we have Moses, brother Brandham, they brought us the word of the law, but then there had to be a Joshua come to this, which was grace, the Holy Spirit. We have the same thing. We have a Holy Ghost that wants to take us in. But how? What? Grace. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So it's all right that your parents want you to follow the word and live the word, but you better get the word. &gt;&gt; You look for the person. You said, "God, you come and live in me." &gt;&gt; That's the difference. Because if he That's what really living the word is is when you let him take you over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That Jordan was a natural Jordan here, but here it's actually a spiritual death. &gt;&gt; And who takes you through it? God does. Now, these messages are so powerful because they actually place you when you see how the prophet brought it out. Continuing the paradox message, uh um well, notice this. For he that has entered into his rest, Hebrews 4:10, hath he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his. Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest. He that has entered into his rest ceased from his own works. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; So for me to enter into rest, I have to cease from works. What does that mean? That's why the Bible says that you mortify the deeds through the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's something that being indwelled with the Holy Ghost is supposed to produce. And then you notice if you're not feeding the Holy Ghost, right, if you're not loving God right, what happens? You start getting worldly &gt;&gt; very quick. &gt;&gt; But it's not a law. Watch this. As God did for miss, let us labor therefore to enter into that rest. Oh, there we go. Okay, I do need to work for this. See how confusing God let this be. No wonder he could say to his elect, his disciples, blessed are your eyes, for they see. Right? &gt;&gt; Lest any man f fall after the same example of unbelief. Wait, wait. We read that this morning. And what did they do? They didn't mix faith with the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what this is really about. Now, watch, watch how brother Brandon brings this out. So is it with the individual. As long as there is any human injections, human ideas, then God's germ of life, the Holy Spirit, cannot work. My next my next slide's a big one, but hold on. Watch this. Human injections. Well, well, they'll get right or I'll get right when we do this or I see this. &gt;&gt; Come on. Well, well, I'll I'll have gifts when when when I yield. Well, what does that really mean? Is that something that, you know, Well, man, I've been trying to yield all day long. How do I do this? Nope. Still didn't do it. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? Don't you realize that even yielding is a gift from God that you have to you have to give over to any preacher will know that because that's what we see more gift more on the gift line than any others because things have not been positioned correctly because the gift that we do, we yield to it. I I was just telling sister Beatatric over there, I've had it happen a couple times this year and and God's doing things with me. I he needs to do stuff with you. Expect the same things that I'm seeing. &gt;&gt; I've had time I'll tell you what, even right now I I just I just kind of let go and let God. I'm not a speaker. I'm not I'm not gifted like that. I have I'm not intelligent. And and literally when I start ministering, something kind of starts moving me. But I've had it almost uh two times this year where I'll be preaching and all of a sudden I feel myself my mind is detached from my mouth. Some of you might have experienced this. But I'm literally I'm still preaching, but I'm so disconnected to what's speaking out of me that I become in awe and I say something is preaching from me and it's not me. &gt;&gt; Cuz usually with a gift, you're yielding to it and it's just right with you. It's you're just like in tune. But there are times that I've experienced THIS YEAR WHERE GOD LITERALLY takes my mouth and starts speaking and then he allowed me to pull OFF OF IT WHERE I'M LITERALLY hearing him speak and I'm like and it's AND IT'S A SCARY MOMENT. IT LITERALLY WAS A SCARY MOMENT CUZ I'M SITTING HERE. HE IS CONTROLLING me and and what WHAT'S GETTING SAID? WHAT'S WHAT AND I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY IN THE PICTURE BECAUSE I HAD YIELDED so much to God because of his grace. Amen. That he literally was speaking from my mouth. with no connection to my intellect. &gt;&gt; Does that sound crazy to you? Well, that's all people do and they yield to a demon. &gt;&gt; That's why many times after they do the things that they do, they say, "I have no recollection of any of that." But now watch this. Because if there's human injections, human ideas, then the Holy Spirit can't work. &gt;&gt; So whatever we judge this word to be or we we've got to die to all of it. &gt;&gt; Understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You cannot be healed as long as there's just a fraction somewhere. Why ain't divine healing working right? It's not God. It's our human intellect. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the things that we think because what? We're making it a law or making a cookie cutter. I've watched preachers say, "Oh, I got to do it this way every time because it worked back here." Oh, that don't mean that God can do it any way he wants, whenever he wants. He says, "If there's something it's not rotten yet, it's got all the human elements, all the scientific ideas, all the days of miracles has passed so-called, all that has to all not only die, but rot. and then from there grows the germ of life into a new life. That's the only way it can grow. That's the reason we don't get what we ask for. We try to take with us so much of our own ideas. &gt;&gt; We're not letting the Lord take our mind, but we're trying to make it something, &gt;&gt; right? Anybody ever thought that, well, I'll get healed or this will happen when I do this. Well, if I pray more, I'll get this. If I fast more, I'll get this. &gt;&gt; Well, it's worked for a lot of people. Sure, it works for Benny Hen. Works for a lot of these people. &gt;&gt; But what is that really in the mind of God? Is it something when you look at Brother Brammy most of the time he fasted twice a week for half a day? Oh, I don't know if I'll get there. But you see what it is? We try to make it a law. We try to make it something we can that that we can place in our own mind that this is it. Watch this. I'm going to go to John Wesley. You know, John Wesley was the sanctification guy. &gt;&gt; But John Wesley said something incredibly powerful. I'll get out of the way of it right now. John Wesley said, "And by this token may you surely know whether you seek it by faith or by works." If by works you want something to be done first before you are sanctified, you think I must first BE OR DO THUS or thus, then you are seeking it by works unto this day. Think about it. SHOULDN'T THE HOLY GHOST BE FALLING ALL THE TIME? &gt;&gt; SO, what have we taken as a perception of what this message is? &gt;&gt; I just told you two months ago, God just gave me my first vision that I know of. &gt;&gt; And what he told me was was absolutely phenomenal. [crying] But look at this. John Wesley could even recognize this. If you're seeking it by faith or works. Wait, where's your righteousness? Works or faith? Faith. Faith. You think I must be or do thus or thus. What's going to get you the gifts of the spirit? What's going to get the Holy Ghost falling here? Well, if I listen to the message more, I get more revelation. I do this. I'd be this. Well, if I can only be cleaner, then it'll happen. Oh, that's exactly why it's not happening. We're getting quiet. Good. Let's blast it. If you seek it by faith, you may expect it as you are. And if as you are, then expect it now. Faith will actually build an expectation. &gt;&gt; If you're hearing THIS WORD RIGHT NOW, LET FAITH BE ON IT. &gt;&gt; You have that. REMEMBER OUR PROPHET SAID, HE SAID, "RAPTURING FAITH IS ALREADY IN YOU. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALREADY THERE. IT'S JUST DORMANT AND it needs to be waken up." WELL, THAT'S WHEN THE DEVIL COMES ALONG and he says, "Well, in order for God to do anything for you, you got to do this or be thus." &gt;&gt; THEN WHERE'S YOUR SMILE AT? WHERE'S YOUR HAPPINESS YET? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR WHAT? Satan has tricked your mind that revival is only because you can be this or do this. Brother, sister, years ago, I probably told you this before, but years ago, I I I got really big into Isuza Street. And William Seymour was was praying literally for five to seven hours a day for years. &gt;&gt; And look at the revival they got. Well, you know what old Cam Smith tries to do? What' I try to do, Caris sister? I tried to do it, didn't I? I'm just going to say this. I got so into it, I put a peach basket on my head. It wasn't a peach basket. It was a box, but close enough. Well, that's why it didn't happen, Brother Cam, because it wasn't a peach basket. because I'm looking at what God did for other people based on what they did. And I thought that maybe God would give me what they had if I do what they do. &gt;&gt; But that WAS A DIFFERENT DAY WITH A DIFFERENT revelation with a different understanding and with something that God uh identified especially for those individuals in that time. Yes, sir. So, what do I got to do? What do I have to do? Brother, sister, I prayed for five hours for like a week and a half or something. And I got so depressed after five after a week and a half because I'm like, why ain't God doing anything? And then the devil's right over there. You got to go years, brother Cam. And I never tried it again after that because I was trying to attain it based on a work that I thought would get it to me &gt;&gt; instead of believing. &gt;&gt; Loving God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because notice faith has what? Expectation. Faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you see what real faith is that God's trying to bring out of you right now? &gt;&gt; Well, hold on, brother Cam. I I got to be more awake or I got to be this or No, you you see how the DEVIL HAS SO CAUGHT US INTO THIS. THAT'S WHY IN THAT DRAWING, BROTHER, SISTER, you have you have Ephesians and you have the wilderness. THAT'S WHAT OUR PROPHET SAID. THE LAST BIG MOVE was &gt;&gt; from law to grace. I'm just going to say this. That's what our message fathers have done. They've turned it into something we must be or do &gt;&gt; or we can't have it. And then notice we don't see it. &gt;&gt; I might see a miracle here or there. &gt;&gt; But we're talking into going into this revival. We're talking about a maturity that has given to us by this prophet. And look at the forefathers got some stuff too, don't they? Huh? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, if you want the Holy Ghost, believe &gt;&gt; expect. &gt;&gt; Expect it now. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, brother Cam, let's wait till the next service because this is the second service and I'm pretty tired. Why? WHY AIN'T I TIRED? &gt;&gt; WHY AIN'T I TIRED? CUZ YOU'RE YELLING, BROTHER CAM. You're doing this or YOU'RE DOING THAT. OH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? That means you got to yell and you got to move around, too. &gt;&gt; Because that's the only way it's going to work, right? &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOT FAITH. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU'RE SAYING, "WELL, YOU'RE NOT TIRED CUZ THIS." NO, BUT BROTHERS AND SISTER, IF YOU BELIEVE, GOD CAN RUN THAT DEVIL AWAY FROM YOU. IF YOU BELIEVE AND SAY, "I EXPECT THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE. I'M NOT HERE FOR A SERVICE. I'M HERE TO MEET THE LIVING GOD." AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEN YOU'RE MOVING WITH SOME FAITH AND SAYING, "WHAT? HE'S NOT EVEN LOOKING AT MY UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. CUZ MY RIGHTEOUSNESS, HE SEES IT AND IT IS MY FAITH." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Watch what a prophet says. He says, now he's working with Matthew 7. And he says, "Sheep on one side, one of them will say, well Lord, I did this and Lord, I did that." That's what he said. He said, "They'll come to him. Have we not done many mighty miracles? Have we not prophesied in your name?" And he said, "Ye workers of iniquity, I knew you not." Watch what he says. He said, "Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. I never even knew you. If the church can ever come to those fundamental facts that it's not something you try to do, you work yourself up to do. It's something that's born in you. [laughter] THINK ABOUT THIS. I WON'T GET THERE FAR TODAY BECAUSE I ALREADY TELL you because of the time, but but what I'M GOING TO TELL YOU IS this was the same thing with the Pharisees and Sadducees. Now, isn't it something? Well, THEY PROPHESIED. THEY CAST OUT DEVILS and did miracles. And that's all it was. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Forgive me, my Pentecostal friends. I'm Pentecostal, but my Pentecostal friends has got to a spot to where they there has to be a lot of fast music, beating up of some b bands or clapping hands or tambourines to bring up a shout. That's only emotions. They play the bands before they go to battle to get people in the emotion of the battle. I believe in music. I believe in clapping hands, but I believe in these things. That's exactly true. BUT WE OUGHT TO HAVE THAT. Can you imagine you you saying sing singing like you do? Did you realize you could take that right into the word? Why don't you? Oh no, brother Cam. Come on. Come on. It's second service. Come on. He said, "But you have left the great things undone." Is that self-sacrificed life that God lives in you automatic? Anybody that's INTO SPORTS, THEY'LL SAY, "OH, THAT GUY IS AUTOMATIC. He just gets it done. HE'S AUTOMATIC. AUTOMATIC HOME RUNS, WHATEVER." But wait a minute, that's just a perversion of what? The Holy Spirit. He's automatic. &gt;&gt; You get into his life and he lives it. Automatically doing that which is right because it's right. JUST GOING ON. Don't even think nothing about it. Just living it. &gt;&gt; You're not even thinking anything about it. &gt;&gt; You're just living it. I'm just a Christian because I'm born into it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Then watch. You see what's going on. You just you don't you're on the highway." That's what Calvary meant to you. On the highway open up that DAY FOR YOU. WHAT DID CALVARY DO? This Holy Ghost that wants accept you by your works, your faith. You mean you believe and he'll fill you? &gt;&gt; Well, brother Cam, the Bible says that that that gave the Holy Ghost like Abraham who obeyed. Okay. Well, then we just have to work it then, don't we? Or what is true obedience? Who gets you the Holy Ghost anyway? He does. He makes the way over in the Jordan. The living word does. But what? He wants your faith to line up. Because isn't this something? Have you ever looked and and we know this, right? But have you ever said, "I'm righteous." and said, "Because I believe." This is a game changer. I'm telling you, that brother was on to something. And this has opened up to me like never before. You know why? Because I've lived 20 odd some years right now in this message trying to be the most perfect human being that I could possibly be. And honestly, when I look at the way I was in the world, I was wild. But I was happy. I loved it. I love being worldly. My flesh, &gt;&gt; I know I'm the only one here that's been worldly, but I took pleasure in unrighteousness and I was happy doing it. I GOT INTO DENOMINATION. THEY DIDN'T TEACH ME ANY OF THE WORD AND I ACTED THE SAME WAY. I WAS I WAS A H I was happy IN THE CHURCH. AMEN. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING. I WAS HUGGING GUYS, HUGGING GIRLS, HUGGING ANYBODY. HALLELUJAH. YEAH, I'M A CHRISTIAN. I was happy. And then I come to the message. Now I know the word. Now I know the word. And it's something when I didn't know the word, I feel like I was expressing a greater deal of happiness than what I did when I come to the because I began to try to constrain myself to seek my approval from God. I've got to be this and I've got to do this and I'm going to try really hard. Right now, don't get me wrong. I had message people coming to me at the time I was shaving my head and they said, "You know, that's a sign of a Nazi." I said, "Oh, I better grow my hair out." And I did. I wore a suit one time with with sandals and the deacon came over. He said, "What are you doing?" And I said, "What?" Because I was a happy message believer at the beginning. And he said, "Let me show you, brother Cam." So he picked me, he grabbed me, and he took me over to this sister. And she says, and he says, "Sister, do you see anything odd about Brother Cam?" And she's looking at me. She's like, "Oh, Brother Cam looks good." AND SHE'S LIKE, [laughter] AND SHE LOOK AT MY sho my sandals. And she says, "See what I mean, brother?" And so I never wore sandals with a suit again. And why do I still remember that? Why do I still remember that? What if I would have said, "Oh, well, I'm glad you guys feel that way, but I don't care." But what I did, I allowed it to become a work that I have to do in order to be right. Don't miss this. Don't miss this. And maybe many of us have went these paths, especially with things off of the word. Where's it at camp? Where's it? I had I had a fellow come to me. I was working with him and he said, "Brother Cam," he said, or he said, "Cam," he said, "Tell me where your Bible tells me that I have to wear a suit to church. I'm just trying to show you what's in the word and what's in human injection. Everybody's going to show up for church next time and they're all going to be wearing raggedy clothes. It's all your fault, brother Cam, but just let me know. I get it. I I want to dress nice because I love my God. I I want to I want to show something to him and I have to do that. But I only do it because I love &gt;&gt; I don't do it because I have to. Come on. You see what I'm saying? You see what holds back the moving of the Holy Ghost? This is an in this is a powerful powerful quote. Notice same message. And Joshua could not at all become into his ministry until after Moses was gone. So you see the very first verse here, Moses, my servant is dead. Now arise, take this people into the promised land. Moses representing the law had served its time. It's the law had served its time. They started out really with grace to begin with before they had law. They had grace. While they were in Egypt without law, no one down there was just the priest and so forth. They didn't have any law. Uh the law had not yet been given. Grace provided them a prophet. Grace provided an atonement, the sacrificial lamb. We're getting into it this week on the sacrificed blood because there lays your healing. So the atonement had been provided before there was any law. Grace was before law, during law, after law. So there was Joshua representing grace was right along with law, but could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place. And so as a church world in this last day, it's come along. It's played its part. But there is coming a time where it must cease. Did you get that? There has got to be in Ephesians also this journey just as there was of these other journeys. There has to come to Ephesians of this journey. He ties it along and says again, oh my. So, just like you have the Jordan River, you have what? Didn't Jesus take the church from law to grace? &gt;&gt; Now, notice they were both in law, the disciples, the Pharisees and scribes, and he wanted to bring them to grace. This is where we're going to get pretty pretty powerful. I hope I hope we can see this. Now, I wonder what they both look like. First thing is let's find out what what brother Brandham said the Ephesians was. He says he's talking about Jesus said uh talking about Jesus he said but there's no prophet and then when he come on the scene to prove that he was that Ephesians made manifest. John announced it but Jesus was that he was the word manifested himself. So the Ephesians is actually the word made manifest. Hallelujah. 1 Timothy 3:16. Let's give it. But he was the mystery of godliness, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. Here's where I want to get. He said, so notice in a seed's birth, the old seed must die before the new one can be born. So therefore, death is hard any time. So it's painful. It's distressful. Think about that. &gt;&gt; Birth is the same because you're bringing life into the world. It's painful. So wait, the new birth is not something easy. &gt;&gt; We're talking about law and grace. So think about this. It's not easy to die to self, to grace. &gt;&gt; I just told you several things. A lot of you are probably thinking different of me now. [laughter] Humble enough to do it. Thank God. Help me. Watch this. And that's the reason it was so hard for those Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus Christ because they were under the law. Think about it. They couldn't understand who Jesus was because they were trying to live the law. &gt;&gt; And the law was the word of God in seed form. But when the word was made flesh and become not law but grace, now grace and law cannot exist at the same time. Oh my Because grace is so far above law. Law is not even in the picture. When I preach this at the church, I wrote grace right here. And I said, can anybody show me what else is written here? It's not even the same picture. Law's not even in the picture. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, BUT IT MUST GO. The two laws cannot exist at the same time. There cannot be a law that says that you can run this semi for and the other one says you can't. You can run it. Uh, one says you can, one says you can't. There it has to be one law at a time. Maybe one time you have went through it. Caution, go through it. He said, but this time it's read. Stop. See, and so there cannot be two laws exist at the same time. Now here we go. Now we notice that it always, my thought now to you, it takes pain and distress, discomfort. Look how them Pharisees died to that law. Uhoh. through pain, distress, discomfort, but it must be. Did you just get this? This is insoly ghost, Satan will bring a contrary move of the seed form word. And that's why the Pharisees couldn't understand Jesus because they were trying to die to the perfection of flesh that they could manage that they could do. &gt;&gt; But think about it. That was the very experience that crucified Christ. &gt;&gt; They died to law. Law killed Christ. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you see this. He died. The Pharisees had to die to law through pain, distress, and discomfort. Are we happy? Are are we just the happiest Christians you can think of? Or are we going through pain, distress, and discomfort because this message has revealed the full word to us? What what we should do, what we shouldn't do, &gt;&gt; and we're trying to find acceptance by dying to that law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Very quickly, watch this. God wants us all to do alms. But notice what he says. Take he do not alms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father. He's talking about the Pharisees and Sadducees. Notice they're both to do these things but one is doing it as a law. &gt;&gt; So he's saying don't do it like that for a law. &gt;&gt; Says it again when thou prayest. Don't be like those dying to the law. &gt;&gt; They want to be seen. They they they want to uh they want people to see how great they are. &gt;&gt; When you fast, &gt;&gt; be not as THE HYPOCRITES OF A SAD COUNTENANCE. OH, just fasting, right? That's what we do. just sitting at second service. Second service is a ch they're challenging. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good job. We still got smilers. We still got mean, man. You still got it going on. Glory. &gt;&gt; And isn't it something? He brings it a little bit farther. He says, he said, "Beware the leavenven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." It was the word that they were producing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm I'm trying to close because there's a lot here. This is where I want to hit. When we had our picture up there, I had the disciples right here and I had the Pharisees and Sadducees right here. Both of them were dying to something. But only one set of those people actually went into the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Those that died to a law, something they could be or do or try to prove that by flesh they were good enough. &gt;&gt; Think about it. They thought they had the spirit of God on them and they were the ones that killed the word. But watch this. Look at the ones that live by grace. The disciples they didn't understand his full plan in such a way Peter said he he said Lord you don't have to be crucified and Jesus looked at him and said Satan get behind thee [laughter] thou savest not the things of God you imagine THAT WAS THE ONE THAT THAT was moving into grace. &gt;&gt; He was yielding to Satan to try to get Jesus to go against his plan. That was the one that was living to move into grace. They were fighting for position. THEY WERE ARGUING WITH JESUS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. WHO'S GOING TO BE THE GREATEST? I'm going to be the greatest. Obviously, what I'm trying to do is to show you, did the Pharisees, were they really good at fasting and praying and doing alms? Were they really good at looking like good religious people all the time? They were able to die to that law in such a way they brought in the perfect counterfeit instead of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But these guys, oh boy, those guys didn't have the perfect lives, did they? These aren't much to brag about. But notice what they did do. They walked daily with him, right? They walked with Jesus. They forsook all, right? They knew his personality. Brother Simon had a powerful sermon about knowing the personality of Jesus Christ. They knew what he was like. While the PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES WANTED NOTHING TO do with him. They knew he was a Christ. They sold out, left their lives. They left their normal lives just to solely follow him. Yes, sir. Even with all these problems, they did this. They daily were listening to his word. They were daily in communion talking to him. Well, Jesus, what do you think about this? Jesus, what do you think about that? But mainly, they were predestinated and called by him. [laughter] God singlehandedly said, "Come follow me, Peter." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh my Simon Barjonas. That's a different one. But anyway, we're gonna stop right there. Just a little teaching. And I know took a little time, but I want us not to miss this where we're going with this. We're going into an Ephesians and we're leaving what is considered by God as our prophet sw to us 60 years ago that this has got to go from law to grace. The grace is the full Ephesians move. &gt;&gt; Very simply and very concisely, we are watching, brother, sister, that God is trying to get us to stop trying to be perfect. &gt;&gt; What we ought to be doing is saying, "God, I believe you. I'm righteous because your word says so and I believe it. You took my place. I believe it. You'll fill me with the Holy Ghost because you promised it. I'll see not I just won't say I've got the Holy Ghost. I'll see all of the vindication of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because you're actually speaking THE WORD. YOU'RE SAYING WHAT you are because faith shows by what's coming forth from here. That's why brother Brandon he said never be negative. He said it weakens faith all the time. But why are we being negative? Why are we being negative? Because we're not entering into faith. That's why it weakens faith. Because it's contrary. Oh, brother, sister. So what? So next time you hear the word, when you go home, you listen to whatever you're doing. Like I said, this is no excuse to not love God in his word and to want to be a Christian, but it changes the direction of how you were trying to do it and say, "Lord, I believe." It's so simple. It's so simple. Brother, sister, this is literally the transition where you're starting to watch God move through you. Isn't that what he said? You're not even trying. It's something automatic. I said, "If you're already there, hallelujah. Pray for me. because I want the full Ephesians. I want all of it. And the book of Joshua tells me what it is. The book of Ephesians tells me what it is. The adoption series tells me what it is. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that is who we are. &gt;&gt; Don't look at what you are. Look at what he says you are. &gt;&gt; Because what he sees is the word. Remember, ain't that what what he said? That's what he said in the adoption series. He says that God can't look at you any differently than what he did when he put your name on the book for the foundation of the world. So, you see how Satan wants us to look at this, our thought process, our issues. Well, maybe most of our issues would fall out if we could just believe &gt;&gt; because they're contrary. law has to cease. Don't worry. The word brings you through that. The the living word brings you through. That's why when you're hearing the word, you're like, "Yep, I get it. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm free." Why am I free? Because he said I'm free. I believed it. &gt;&gt; I'M FREE BECAUSE I live perfect THIS MORNING. NO, I'M FREE BECAUSE HE SAID I'M FREE. [laughter] HALLELUJAH. I'M FREE BECAUSE HE DIED ON A CROSS TO TAKE MY PLACE. I CAN LIVE THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE HE SAID HE'D COME IN ME AND LIVE THIS MESSAGE. AMEN. IT'S AUTOMATICALLY LIVED. LET'S STAND. &gt;&gt; That's a long grace one for you, brother sister. But wow, it's so phenomenal. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your patience. So, how many want to get away from the I've got to be this or do this? &gt;&gt; And just expect a living God by faith to come in and do it for you. &gt;&gt; You see what it is? It's really just believing that if he comes inside of me, it's exactly what Brother Bram said the whole time. If I had the spirit of Mosart, I'd be doing music. If I had the spirit of Michelangelo, I'd be making sculptures and stuff. But if I have the spirit of Christ, what's going to happen? It's going to live the word. &gt;&gt; But it's the spirit of Christ. We're yielding to it. We're happy. We're believing. We're feeding. &gt;&gt; We're doing what Christians do. Love God. &gt;&gt; Believe him. Amen. Very, very simple. A lot there. I hope we see it. And I I believe that God will continue to add to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When when that brother told me that, I'm sitting here, I'm like, man, why am I looking at this thing? &gt;&gt; But isn't it something that even while law was in existence, grace was always with it the whole time. &gt;&gt; Think about it. When when Moses was in the wilderness, the first battle, who fought the battle? Joshua. Who fought every battle? Joshua. Who was fighting the prophet's battles? Joshua. Grace was there the whole time. Hallelujah. How many want grace to rule your life? &gt;&gt; Okay, I didn't define it. Grace is unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; So what' you do? Nothing. It's unmmerited. He loves you because you're brother Jesse. Loves you because you're brother Jose. He loves you because you're brother Chris. [laughter] He loves you because he brought you forth. &gt;&gt; And he will complete that which lackth in you. He will. I believe that. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Think about all your failures. All all the things that you that you know is not like God. What are you going to do with it right now? &gt;&gt; I believe God's going to conquer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that the nature of Christ is going to so fill me that it's just automatic. Oh, there's dying to self right there. How many love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we make a prayer, why is God going to accept your prayer? Something you got to do, something you got to be? &gt;&gt; Because he loves you. He first loved you. &gt;&gt; You're here because he first loved you. &gt;&gt; So what does he want you to do? Believe. How many have a need? Let's believe. Hallelujah. Let's pray right now. Lord Jesus, we approach you, oh God, knowing I maybe went a little long again, Lord, but we're just asking this, Lord, that Lord, when we come to these ideas about where you're taking the church, what has to happen to get the word to be functional like it's supposed to be. We're finding, Lord, that just like every system, they started to make the gospel something it wasn't. It was supposed to be a good news. It was supposed to be a move by faith, a move by grace because that's even how we had salvation, Lord. But Lord, we look that what man does is it injects. But Lord, we don't want injection, man's injection. We want to live by faith in THIS WORD. THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH, GOD. And I'm PRAYING RIGHT NOW, LORD. We're agreeing in that prayer that Lord, you'll move on each individual, Lord. Oh God, may it be that you can pull us all away from our own doing, OUR OWN INJECTION OF THOUGHT THAT OF WHAT WE HAVE TO BE before you can make us what you want us to be. This is all about you. And we know that right now you're looking at our faith. Do we believe this? Are we the righteousness of God? We believe Lord. So we're asking with that Lord you'll come on the scene Lord and bring great change in our daily walk. BRING A HAPPINESS BECAUSE it's nothing WE EVER HAD TO WORK for Lord as far as to try to to to do some religious valor. OH GOD, IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT you by election drawing us to believe it and we're living by that. bridge the way over Jordan into this Ephesians so the fullness of the word can manifest in our midst. We're praying, oh God, that you be gracious unto us. And Lord, what you've started, Lord, we know you're going to fi finish, oh God, because it's your work. You are the wise master builder. You will accomplish what your word has set forth. It will not come back to you void. So I'm praying in the name of Jesus Christ, you give everyone what they have need of. And Lord, raise our faith up in thee for the glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Uh can we love
