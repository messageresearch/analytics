[39:44] fear of the Lord we come Lord asking you
[39:46] for grace and mercy Lord we know we'll
[39:48] receive wisdom because we come with fear

[40:41] Christ's name and the church said amen

[40:51] so well that's tonight Lord willing
[40:53] we'll look at part four if you can do
[40:57] switch over and we'll do some slides
[40:58] here I'd like to show a lot of quotes
[40:59] again tonight I normally don't preach a
[41:02] lot of quotes you know it depends
[41:04] what kind of message I'm preaching I
[41:07] guess in the revelation series I did use
[41:09] a lot of quotes so it kind of depends on
[41:11] the topic in this series of course there
[41:15] are a lot of quotes because I at this
[41:16] point I'm trying to prove the the
[41:19] jeffersonville side wrong and then we're
[41:22] winning after that we'll try to prove
[41:23] the other side wrong because we're right
[41:25] in the middle the road praise God
[41:27] Amen brother BAM said you should always
[41:28] be that way right in the middle of the
[41:30] road he said with enough enough warmth
[41:32] in your heart to be on fire be moved by
[41:34] the holy spirit but with using your mind
[41:36] enough that you just don't believe
[41:38] anything you nightly divide the word and
[41:40] you believe the truth of God's Word amen
[41:42] so right in the middle the road praise
[41:43] God so we did our memory verse our text
[41:46] now on Sunday we looked at a little bit
[41:49] more at all the biblical proof you know
[41:51] the requirements for a prophet we showed
[41:53] all the things all sorry parmi we showed
[41:57] all the truths here that brother Branham
[42:01] did as far as let me go back there all
[42:03] the mysteries all the revelations all
[42:07] the secrets that he made known praise
[42:08] God we know like even Paul didn't know
[42:11] the revelations of the book of
[42:13] Revelation because he wasn't alive to
[42:15] know about it and even John even John
[42:19] didn't know the thunders but my brother
[42:21] I'm sorry brother Graham tells us what
[42:23] the thunders are he says that the
[42:24] revelations contained in the seven seals
[42:27] glory so we know the truths that not
[42:30] even John knew praise the Lord now the
[42:32] question is what do we do with it
[42:34] amen that's all we're to do we're to
[42:36] live by it praise God
[42:37] we're to live by the revelations
[42:39] containing the seals right which is
[42:41] living by the anointing of the Holy
[42:43] Spirit the eagle anointing praise God
[42:45] that's what we're living by we're flying
[42:47] above denominations were flying above
[42:49] the world we're soaring up
[42:50] we're seated not on the earth were
[42:52] seated in heavenly places in Christ
[42:54] Jesus trusting in the word of God now
[42:57] addition to all that biblical proof I
[42:59] showed on Sunday I just want to refresh
[43:02] your mind I show this a few years ago
[43:04] you're probably gonna remember it once I
[43:07] get it up here the angel told brother
[43:10] Branham that he would pray for kings and
[43:12] monarchs and you know great people
[43:17] Daniel repented for Israel rejecting
[43:19] God's prophets remember Daniel is
[43:22] praying in Daniel 9 6 the prophets spoke
[43:25] in the in thy name to the kings Daniel
[43:28] notice that that prophets were used to
[43:31] speak to great people praise God even
[43:35] Paul got to stand before King Agrippa
[43:38] great men right great men of the earth
[43:40] he probably wasn't the greatest man of
[43:43] that day but he was a great man and so
[43:47] the angel the Lord told brother Branham
[43:50] that he would pray for kings and
[43:53] monarchs with a seventh grade education
[43:57] how could a man with a seventh grade
[44:00] education pray for kings and rulers and
[44:02] monarchs it would have to be the hand of
[44:04] God because it wasn't his education that
[44:06] did it
[44:07] praise God and so you remember the angel
[44:13] visited him in 1946 I'm gonna skip past
[44:16] that that's just a lot of reading but
[44:18] just again how the angel said you'll be
[44:20] praying for Kings potentates monarchs
[44:23] all over the world praise God and so we
[44:27] know most notably brother Ram prayed for
[44:30] King George the 6th of England now the
[44:33] the believe the sign side says likes to
[44:36] say there's no proof of that and I can't
[44:40] produce any proof of that myself now
[44:42] brother Branham said he had a
[44:43] photostatic copy of King George thanks
[44:46] for the prayer but do a voice of God has
[44:50] yet to produce that so we just we just
[44:53] take the Rams weren't at that because
[44:55] some of these other ones were clearly
[44:56] made manifest so we take it at his word
[45:00] he prayed for king gustaf the 6 of
[45:03] Sweden and he said that in 1957 so the
[45:09] the angel said you'll pray for Kings and
[45:11] he said and he showed how he did but Ram
[45:15] said he prayed for King Farouk of Egypt
[45:17] he said that in 1961 he met with King
[45:21] Farouk at Rome then he I'm sorry then he
[45:25] went to Rome then he went down into
[45:26] Cairo Egypt so the angel was right to
[45:29] praise God
[45:30] he said he prayed for the King Saud of
[45:32] Saudi Arabia that was from 1953 he said
[45:39] he prayed for the president of Portugal
[45:40] he said this in 1958 obviously we know
[45:51] he prayed for the congressman William up
[45:54] Shawn that audio is on tape I played
[45:56] that here before you can hear it from
[45:57] 1951 great congressman there he I think
[46:02] you tried to run for president but
[46:03] didn't get elected
[46:05] that's the audio I'm gonna skip past
[46:08] that but you can see the pamphlet after
[46:10] he got healed he comes up to brother
[46:11] branham it's on tape and he says I'm
[46:13] gonna I made this pamphlet and I'm gonna
[46:14] send it to Joseph Stalin he even says in
[46:18] the early 1950s and in this letter in
[46:22] this pamphlet he writes a poem about the
[46:24] night he got healed when ern Baxter was
[46:26] preaching and then brother Bram came out
[46:28] to pray for the sick as many times
[46:30] that's how they did it earlier in the
[46:31] ministry brother Branham wasn't as as
[46:34] comfortable preaching publicly so he
[46:36] would let ern Baxter preach cuz mo
[46:37] Graham felt a little shy you know wasn't
[46:39] this confident so Hearn Baxter would
[46:42] preach the word and brother Graham would
[46:43] come out and pray and he saw a vision
[46:45] and he pronounced it to the congressman
[46:47] and the congressman was healed and it's
[46:49] on tape as far as him coming up later
[46:50] and saying I was healed and now I'm
[46:52] gonna send one to Joseph Stalin the
[46:54] White House he said I'm gonna tell my
[46:55] testimony everywhere he said it's on
[46:58] tape but you can't deny that so because
[47:01] we have proof for this one we we believe
[47:03] the other ones cuz I don't have any
[47:05] proof of the other ones I showed the the
[47:07] Cairo one I don't have any proof of
[47:09] these other than just brother man's word
[47:11] but because these are true because this
[47:14] is true I believe the other ones because
[47:16] I don't believe brother Branham would
[47:17] lie about that
[47:19] he said he prayed for the Prime Minister
[47:21] rather of India that was in 1954 he
[47:25] prayed for Vice President Nixon in 1958
[47:29] and there's the picture there's brother
[47:31] Branham and there's Vice President Nixon
[47:33] and there's FF Bosworth so the angel
[47:37] said you're gonna be amongst great men
[47:38] and look what he was right there's a
[47:40] picture so congressman and vice
[47:43] president united states which
[47:44] it can be argued he was more powerful
[47:46] than all the other kings it could be
[47:47] argued that right politically right
[47:51] America was a superpower even the 50s
[47:53] yeah we just won world war two in the 45
[47:56] and 45 was the right man in 45 Milkha
[47:59] yeah so we are a superpower of the world
[48:02] so it could be argued that they were
[48:05] even greater
[48:06] he was even greater than the other ones
[48:09] so don't forget that you have all the
[48:11] mysteries you have all the the seals the
[48:13] church ages all of us say the Lord's we
[48:15] went through all the doctrine that was
[48:16] all of us saith the Lord and we also
[48:18] have this the angel said you'll pray for
[48:21] great men and he did he prayed for the
[48:24] general and medina of Mexico in 1960 and
[48:29] there he's with the head of the
[48:31] Pentecostal Church of Sweden Louis Paris
[48:33] that was in 1951 he prayed for ol
[48:39] Roberts in 1960 or Roberts of course was
[48:41] a greater man more popular we'd say than
[48:42] brother Branham because his doctrine
[48:45] wasn't as was it is true wasn't as
[48:48] faithful it has brother Rams and so the
[48:51] less true your word is the more popular
[48:52] you'll be right no doubt he prayed for
[48:56] the Archbishop of India and he almost
[49:00] met Pope Pius but they said you have to
[49:03] kisses his ring and he said he said I'll
[49:05] call him Reverend I'll come brother he
[49:07] said about how I gotta kiss his ring I'm
[49:09] out he said I will I'll give man his
[49:14] respect but I will worship no man so he
[49:17] said instead he got the tour of the
[49:18] Vatican and he saw the the three-tiered
[49:20] crown of the Pope right roots represents
[49:23] purgatory heaven and earth he's Lord of
[49:27] all three and I think he's got it on
[49:28] right there
[49:29] well there's at least three parts to it
[49:30] yeah one two three there's at least
[49:32] three layers to that one Pope Pius the
[49:34] the twelfth and then of course there was
[49:38] other ones dr. Reid head he talks about
[49:40] that Sydney Smith mayor of Durban the
[49:44] Dean of the Lutheran College all kinds
[49:46] of different great men state senators
[49:47] all kinds of great men now is that a
[49:51] helpful reminder there by God's grace
[49:53] there's pictures it's on tape you know
[49:55] some of them we have actual proof audio
[49:57] recording
[49:58] I just want to refresh that that these
[50:00] things were not doner in the corner
[50:01] right we hear it all the time that's
[50:02] true these things were not done in the
[50:04] corner now I'm still on this thought of
[50:07] dealing with the Jeffersonville false
[50:10] statements I have the the script done
[50:12] that I'm going to share with Billy Paul
[50:14] and Joseph on a private video I just got
[50:16] to record it Lord willing I'll record it
[50:18] on Saturday cuz I don't to preach on
[50:19] Sunday and then I'll work on it next
[50:21] week I'll probably done by the following
[50:22] week because it takes me about a week to
[50:24] edit a video I just do 30 minutes a day
[50:26] you know in the morning and I want to
[50:28] share it with them hopefully they'll
[50:30] respond if not well I tried you know I
[50:32] try to email I tried I'll try letter
[50:34] I'll try video whatever I can do to try
[50:36] to get the people to be correct but I
[50:38] believe Church its idolatry to say
[50:40] everything brother Ram said was thus
[50:42] saith the Lord I believe that's an evil
[50:44] spirit of idolatry I don't know what
[50:46] those brothers have I'm not saying they
[50:48] got evil spirit but I am saying they're
[50:50] wrong and it's not the Holy Spirit that
[50:53] would say William Branham is infallible
[50:55] it's not the Holy Spirit I would say
[50:56] that he was infallible when he said thus
[50:59] saith the Lord just like every other
[51:00] prophet but not every word on the tape
[51:03] is infallible not every word is thus say
[51:05] at the Lord we don't have any problems
[51:07] with that because we know the Bible says
[51:08] that right the Bible says that there's
[51:10] no one there's no one righteous no not
[51:13] one praise God and the Bible said all
[51:16] the lips of all men are as deadly asked
[51:20] the Bible says every lip see that's why
[51:23] even Isaiah a man
[51:26] 800 years before Christ said a virgin
[51:28] shall conceive even him when he got the
[51:31] Friends of God he said I'm a man of
[51:33] unclean lips praise God see a prophet
[51:35] had unclean lips because we just say
[51:37] foolish things sometimes off but thank
[51:40] God there's a God of heaven there's a
[51:42] fire of heaven that can cleanse our lips
[51:44] a name and help us to say the right
[51:46] thing at the right time amen how can it
[51:49] be done only by God's grace only by the
[51:52] fire of God amen
[51:53] it won't be by our ability we have no
[51:56] ability of our own praise God we need
[51:58] the cleansing power the Holy Spirit
[52:01] praise God amen I have nobility in my
[52:03] own the only way people are blessed is
[52:05] if the holy the Blessed Holy Spirit will
[52:07] come and use my lips for his glory
[52:09] praise God I've no
[52:10] ability of my own no man does there's
[52:12] only one preacher that's Jesus Christ
[52:14] amen
[52:14] we just have to yield ourselves to him
[52:17] now I'm gonna get through these tonight
[52:19] Lord willing and then I'll try to get to
[52:22] some more on Sunday we went through the
[52:25] the to the two statements where Miriam
[52:27] confesses that he sins like he tells
[52:30] about sinning on tape and so we know his
[52:32] lies that he told his lies when he
[52:34] specifically lied to the IRS man and he
[52:36] said I make thousands of mistakes every
[52:38] month he said we know that those cannot
[52:41] be thus saith the Lord because God
[52:43] doesn't lie so God is not the author of
[52:46] lie
[52:47] and we but we appreciate brother Branham
[52:48] being honest because he's a man and we
[52:51] can relate if brother Graham purposely
[52:52] lied that we can relate purposely when
[52:54] we purposely make a mistake right
[52:56] we can relate to that we had a moment of
[52:58] weakness my man said with all those is
[53:00] meetings he said he thought his head was
[53:02] gonna fly off his head was spinning he
[53:04] said you ever any ever felt pressure
[53:06] like that before if you like your heads
[53:08] gonna spin if I get one more email if I
[53:09] get one more text I got one more person
[53:11] questioning me you're asking me well I
[53:13] feel like that sometimes it's cool with
[53:15] all those kids running around asking me
[53:16] this that's me I got 22 kids running
[53:18] around asking me questions sometimes I
[53:19] feel like that sometimes I might have
[53:21] the bad attitude right
[53:23] and I might purposely sin I don't mean
[53:25] to but I do it but I got I have a high
[53:29] priest who's able to make intercession
[53:31] for my sins amen
[53:33] and so brother man can make mistakes but
[53:36] yet be forgiven and still be a prophet
[53:38] because he never made a mistake with
[53:39] thus saith the Lord now that's that's
[53:41] the side believe the sign is on the
[53:44] Jeffersonville side they say
[53:45] everything's I said Lord but believe the
[53:47] sign we'll get to that one
[53:48] and there's two major ones the brown
[53:49] bear and the prophecy of 300,000 people
[53:52] those are the two ones I oughta study
[53:54] one more out but the other one the ones
[53:56] plains the see the brown bear is plain
[53:58] to see milligram never said thus saith
[54:00] the Lord I'll hang it on my wall
[54:01] he just said thus saith the Lord it'll
[54:03] be and it was brother a I saw the bear
[54:05] he just didn't shoot it because but he
[54:07] never said thus said the Lord going to
[54:09] shoot it he never said that
[54:10] so it's just a misunderstanding they see
[54:12] thou stay at the Lord in the quote and
[54:14] they they make everything they'll say
[54:15] that the law in the quote well any
[54:16] person knows you can't do that you got
[54:19] to make sure what the Prophet what says
[54:21] it right around the words you got that's
[54:23] what's thus saith the Lord
[54:24] you got to be careful what you make thus
[54:26] saith the Lord you have to be very
[54:28] careful so we looked at those and then
[54:33] we looked at some doctrinal statements
[54:35] we looked at Jesus wasn't on the throne
[54:38] so in the church age series momentum
[54:40] said Jesus was not on the throne months
[54:43] later and then years later he prays and
[54:46] says God is on the throne right now
[54:48] Jesus on the throne right now so we
[54:50] showed how is it just a doctrinal
[54:52] mistake he thought he saw you know the
[54:54] three phases of the throne from heaven
[54:56] to Jesus to man's heart and he was
[54:59] saying Jesus is no longer in heaven on
[55:00] the throne he's in your heart well that
[55:02] wasn't right it's true he's on the
[55:04] throne in your heart but it's also true
[55:06] his bodies in heaven praise God so so
[55:08] both of those are true
[55:10] he's your throne is that your heart is a
[55:12] throne but Jesus is still on the throne
[55:14] in heaven praise God his spirits in your
[55:17] heart your soul but his bodies in heaven
[55:20] and the spirits in heaven to praise God
[55:22] because his spear so great it can divide
[55:24] itself and yet it never gets any less
[55:26] he's just so great he's you you can't
[55:28] he's infinite praise God there there's
[55:30] no end to him praising hard he doesn't
[55:33] run out of spirit when he sends the Holy
[55:34] Spirit down he doesn't run out he's got
[55:36] an infinite amount praise guy so it said
[55:39] so see brother man I just made a mistake
[55:41] he probably write it in a book
[55:42] we don't know you know he was studying
[55:44] out of books a lot during that time
[55:45] because he was doing the research for
[55:46] the church ages so he probably read in a
[55:48] book he just taught it didn't think
[55:50] about it too much just like I'll make a
[55:52] mistake every now and then I don't mean
[55:53] to write but we just try to correct it
[55:55] later by God's grace amen
[55:57] now tonight when Jose and Aaron and I
[56:01] were there jeffersonville I asked him
[56:04] about the white horse rider now I hadn't
[56:06] studied up on it in a while cuz you know
[56:08] he said any questions mr. Smith and I
[56:10] said yeah I said how can you say
[56:12] everywhere program said was the state
[56:13] the Lord and so he goes to tell me what
[56:16] he thinks he said I don't really I don't
[56:18] I don't want to make something that's
[56:19] not he said I don't want to make
[56:21] something not thus saith Lord that is
[56:24] thus saith the Lord in other words he
[56:25] doesn't want to make any word he doesn't
[56:27] take away from the word and I said well
[56:31] sir that's why we rightly divide the
[56:32] word of truth that's why I believe God
[56:33] gave preachers the gifts to rightly
[56:35] divide the word and he just went on
[56:38] I said I said did you know bro Ram said
[56:40] the white horse rider was the Holy
[56:42] Spirit and then the seals he said it's
[56:44] Antichrist thus saith the Lord and he
[56:47] said yo you know mr. Smith he said you
[56:49] know I went back and listening to mighty
[56:51] Conqueror and it's not on the tape well
[56:53] he was right it's not on mighty
[56:54] Conqueror it's in the church age series
[56:56] and I forgot that brother race I didn't
[56:59] have nothing to say so see God let me
[57:01] make a mistake in that I was just like
[57:03] well okay after I set out to go look
[57:05] that up I said I'm pretty sure he said
[57:06] that and I went looked it up and it
[57:09] wasn't in mighty conquer it was in the
[57:11] church a series so let's read it now so
[57:14] you can see it now this is in December
[57:17] 1960 he said say I just happened to
[57:19] think of something here he goes to
[57:20] Revelation 19 Jesus comes out of heaven
[57:22] he's on a white horse okay we don't know
[57:24] that I preached that recently vesture
[57:26] dipped in blood his name is called the
[57:27] Word of God he said now what went out of
[57:29] his mouth what went out the horse rider
[57:31] notice also 7 I believe 8 when the know
[57:35] at 6 so see he's thinking about a white
[57:38] horse of Revelation 19 is oh there's a
[57:40] white horse in Revelation chapter 6 -
[57:42] now that's the end of Christ but at this
[57:44] point real man thought it was the Holy
[57:46] Spirit when the white horse went rider
[57:48] went forth he was given a boat at
[57:50] conquering to conquer and a sore went
[57:51] out of his mouth what was he look
[57:53] Capital he H the white horse rider
[57:56] revelation notice the sword out of his
[57:58] mouth course was too sharp
[57:59] - to edge - I'm sorry sharp two-edged
[58:02] sword the word so there he says at one
[58:05] time he says see I know that's the same
[58:08] horse rider of Revelation six now he
[58:11] says that plane more plainly in the next
[58:12] quote a week later one week later he
[58:16] says the sixth chapter deals with the
[58:18] white horse which was the Holy Spirit
[58:20] went forth conquering and to conquer
[58:23] now that's plain his day that's plain as
[58:26] day men come the pale horse death found
[58:29] at each one the riders the he said not
[58:31] after these sayings out of the great
[58:32] discussion destruction first went forth
[58:35] the Holy Ghost across the earth
[58:37] conquering and to conquer take your
[58:39] Bible Church if you got one real quick
[58:41] here let's go to revelation 6 verse 3 I
[58:45] think it is or - you
[58:49] verse two and I saw behold a white horse
[58:51] and he sat on him at a bow and a crown
[58:53] was given on him and he went forth
[58:55] conquering in to conquer so Bodrum says
[58:58] the White Horse writer of chapter six is
[59:01] the holy spirit he said the Holy Spirit
[59:03] went across the earth conquering and to
[59:05] conquer but about let's see uh one two
[59:09] about three years later brother Ram is
[59:12] preaching the seals and he says the
[59:14] white horse rider went out who is he's a
[59:16] great fella you want me to tell you who
[59:18] he is he's the Antichrist that's exactly
[59:22] what he is now look even admits he said
[59:26] I would have made a whole a mistake on
[59:29] that if it hadn't been at 12 o'clock
[59:31] today when the Holy Spirit came in amen
[59:33] oh yeah and the room and corrected me on
[59:37] something I was riding down to say I was
[59:40] taking it from old context I had nothing
[59:43] on it I don't know what the second seal
[59:45] is no more than nothing praise God see
[59:48] he was going to revert back to his
[59:51] teaching that the white horse rider of
[59:53] revelation 6 was that was the Holy
[59:55] Spirit but then the Holy Spirit came to
[59:57] correct the word Amen hallelujah and the
[1:00:00] Holy Spirit said I'm not that one I'm
[1:00:03] not that one he said I'm the one that
[1:00:04] comes back in revelation 19:8 in
[1:00:06] revelation 6 is an impersonator I'm the
[1:00:09] real rider 19 praise God and you
[1:00:12] remember what brother Aaron said I think
[1:00:13] I've said this before many times but
[1:00:15] programs said the reason the white horse
[1:00:17] rider of revelation 6 cannot be the Holy
[1:00:20] Spirit is because Jesus is standing
[1:00:23] there with John showing him the vision
[1:00:25] so if you have Jesus showing John the
[1:00:28] white horse rider and the white horse
[1:00:30] riders the Holy Spirit now you got two
[1:00:31] persons you got Jesus by John and you
[1:00:34] got the white horse rider now you got
[1:00:36] two persons but God's not two persons
[1:00:38] he's one person hey hey man you see that
[1:00:41] phrase god that's his proof in the seals
[1:00:44] that's the proof that he uses see he's
[1:00:47] not two persons he's one amen now look
[1:00:52] he ends the Seventh Seal sermon by
[1:00:54] saying the interpretation according to
[1:00:57] the Word of God and the vision the
[1:01:00] revelation is thus saith the Lord now
[1:01:03] you gotta understand this I think you do
[1:01:05] but I'm just gonna say it maybe for the
[1:01:06] live stream people we got two people one
[1:01:08] from New York and the other one from
[1:01:11] Missouri listening attentively because
[1:01:12] they just come in the message and people
[1:01:14] are saying programs not a profit so
[1:01:15] they're really feeding on these sermons
[1:01:17] ladies so that's part of the reason why
[1:01:18] I'm going over it but also for us to
[1:01:20] know as well by God's grace I want the
[1:01:22] children to know too because one of the
[1:01:24] brothers from another church said you
[1:01:26] know what do you couldn't tell your
[1:01:27] children when they get older and they
[1:01:28] hear some of these things I'm gonna tell
[1:01:30] him well I talked you the Word of God I
[1:01:32] showed you that program was a man but
[1:01:34] when he was preaching with the word and
[1:01:36] though it was the word it was right and
[1:01:38] we're to follow that and to reveal the
[1:01:40] secrets to God through the power of the
[1:01:42] Holy Spirit and he taught us he restored
[1:01:44] the Apostolic Faith of the fathers amen
[1:01:46] and he was right with us saith the Lord
[1:01:49] even though they want to misunderstand
[1:01:50] it they want to misinterpret it they can
[1:01:52] do whatever they want but we know it was
[1:01:53] right praise God and you right have to
[1:01:55] rightly divide what he said just like
[1:01:58] any preacher just like anybody so see
[1:02:01] not every word and the seals that that
[1:02:03] book that I'm reading at home with my
[1:02:05] family not every word in there is thus
[1:02:07] saith the Lord but he says it's a the
[1:02:10] revelation of the word is thus saith the
[1:02:13] Lord now see but people like people in
[1:02:17] Indiana the kit they can't stomach that
[1:02:19] I don't know why like I said I think
[1:02:22] it's money or popular I don't know but
[1:02:24] for some reason they can't stomach that
[1:02:26] they can't handle that I don't know why
[1:02:28] well you know I know why brother man
[1:02:29] because the Bible said strong meat
[1:02:31] belongs to those who are mature age I
[1:02:33] don't know I praise God amen that's
[1:02:35] right they can't handle the strong meat
[1:02:38] because they haven't tasted the milk
[1:02:41] praise God they haven't grown up to
[1:02:44] where they're strong enough to handle
[1:02:45] the Word of God how to get strong the
[1:02:48] Bible says you got to exercise
[1:02:49] discernment you got to judge things the
[1:02:51] right way if they misjudge a preacher
[1:02:53] their pastor if they misjudge a preacher
[1:02:56] saying every word as I said the Lord and
[1:02:58] they say Amen it shows they they're not
[1:03:00] even feasting on the milk of God's Word
[1:03:02] because even a milk baby Christian can
[1:03:05] understand brother man was not God not
[1:03:07] every word was I say the Lord he wasn't
[1:03:09] infallible that's Moke teach and that's
[1:03:11] baby teaching because our faith doesn't
[1:03:13] rest in a man
[1:03:14] faith rests in Jesus Christ hey man
[1:03:17] that's why they can't understand the
[1:03:19] meat of God's work
[1:03:20] because they haven't even ever any
[1:03:22] handled the milk well I didn't plan to
[1:03:24] say that believe that's the Holy Spirit
[1:03:25] praise God I believe that so see it's
[1:03:30] not every word because I'm going to show
[1:03:31] you a little later church
[1:03:32] remember when brother Branham said that
[1:03:34] Elisha was all bent out of shape in the
[1:03:37] cave and God had a tongue you've got 700
[1:03:40] others that have not bowed the knee
[1:03:42] member one brother I made that mistake
[1:03:43] it was seven thousand seven thousand and
[1:03:47] not bothering each but brother man
[1:03:48] preaches it like there's seven hundred
[1:03:50] left he said he said it's kind of like
[1:03:52] there's seven hundred in jeffersonville
[1:03:53] that it's still not Bob Dinneen and
[1:03:55] everybody gets nervous there am did you
[1:03:58] mean to say only seven hundred gonna
[1:03:59] make the rapture he said Oh forgive me I
[1:04:01] mean that's a proof right there not
[1:04:04] every word in that sermon series is thus
[1:04:07] saith the lord if it is you got God
[1:04:10] making a mistake and God can't remember
[1:04:12] the numbers that he wrote if God wrote
[1:04:15] it he's gonna remember it praise God so
[1:04:18] see he even with this you have to
[1:04:20] understand he's not saying every word
[1:04:22] he's saying the revelations that were
[1:04:25] according to the word are thus saith the
[1:04:27] Lord
[1:04:28] well brother Jesse that makes it really
[1:04:30] hard well yeah then you got to pray you
[1:04:32] got to rightly divide the word you've
[1:04:34] got to meditate on the Lord you got to
[1:04:36] ask God for answers Amen you've got to
[1:04:38] study him pray you got to give yourself
[1:04:40] wholly to the Lord of God amen
[1:04:43] God doesn't want a surface level
[1:04:45] understanding he wants to go deeper the
[1:04:47] Bible said the spirit searches the deep
[1:04:49] things yea the deep things of God amen
[1:04:53] now I know I look like a fanatic
[1:04:55] preaching this but Ray but it's the
[1:04:56] truth
[1:04:57] I know because I look like an fanatic
[1:04:59] because we have such a small church and
[1:05:01] I'm yelling and screaming like I do but
[1:05:03] it don't matter cuz it's the truth
[1:05:04] anyway praise God and the proof of it is
[1:05:07] because their fruits by their fruits
[1:05:09] they're known praise God both camps both
[1:05:12] camp goes way too far and the fruits of
[1:05:16] their works prove they're wrong and the
[1:05:18] fruits of the other side that deny
[1:05:20] program prove e-r they're wrong as well
[1:05:22] because all their sinful works their
[1:05:25] lustful sinful desires that they
[1:05:27] joy now the other side they got
[1:05:29] different sins I've got to study more
[1:05:31] Annette I think a lot of it's like I
[1:05:33] said pride and popularity yeah cuz
[1:05:37] remember Jesus told that rich young
[1:05:39] ruler just one thing will keep you out
[1:05:40] of the kingdom he said I've done all
[1:05:41] this I've kept the word no adultery no
[1:05:44] murder I haven't stolen all these things
[1:05:46] he said go sell all that you have and
[1:05:48] give it to the poor and he said he
[1:05:50] walked away sorrowful one thing kept
[1:05:53] that man out of the kingdom of God and
[1:05:55] he knew he didn't have eternal life
[1:05:56] praise God
[1:05:59] now here's the one I was going to show
[1:06:01] you and this might you might want to put
[1:06:02] on your shot proof vest for this one
[1:06:03] okay but rather said the Holy Ghost was
[1:06:06] the third person of the Trinity he said
[1:06:08] it often there's probably eight to ten
[1:06:11] quotes I just think I put four up here
[1:06:12] in 1951 brother Rams
[1:06:14] he said now these are those sitting here
[1:06:17] her feeble this afternoon there's a need
[1:06:19] of physical healing and we have chosen
[1:06:21] these few words to read from nine and
[1:06:23] may the Holy Spirit the third person of
[1:06:27] the Trinity go ahead listen to it get on
[1:06:28] your Apple listen to it come in now the
[1:06:32] promise the comforter and you said you
[1:06:34] would send maybe I'll just play it right
[1:06:36] now can I just play it for you real
[1:06:37] quick so you can just to give you some
[1:06:39] proof I'm not making this up Church now
[1:06:42] the reason this one's so important is
[1:06:44] because later he says trinitarianism is
[1:06:46] thus saith the Lord it's wrong well not
[1:06:48] well now you got now if this is thus
[1:06:51] saith the lord of corn Jeffersonville
[1:06:52] he is the other person and later the
[1:06:54] Lord says he's not the third person now
[1:06:55] you got a really confused God because
[1:06:58] God saying he's the third person than
[1:07:00] God saying he's not the third person
[1:07:01] well now you've got a really cannot very
[1:07:04] smart in how because he's contradicting
[1:07:06] himself let me play it now may the Holy
[1:07:11] Spirit I just I don't really plan to do
[1:07:13] this but I just kind of had the
[1:07:15] leadership maybe I want you to hear
[1:07:19] that's the blessing of technology I
[1:07:21] found that we can use it you know to to
[1:07:25] understand these things yeah okay so
[1:07:28] I'll hold it this is what we do at home
[1:07:29] and we listen to the seven seals
[1:07:40] read from that and may the Holy Spirit
[1:07:43] the third person of the Trinity take the
[1:07:53] things of God he's praying he's praying
[1:07:56] and he's saying God may you send the
[1:07:58] third person of the towards the other to
[1:08:00] then the church that doesn't some of me
[1:08:04] because I know I know the Bible says the
[1:08:07] Godhead is a mystery and how can any man
[1:08:10] or woman know a mystery unless God
[1:08:13] reveals it hey I don't care if it's
[1:08:15] prophet or priest or anybody I don't
[1:08:17] care who it is you and I will not know
[1:08:20] any mystery unless God reveals it to a
[1:08:22] prophet praise God amen and it wasn't
[1:08:25] yet the time for the mystery to be
[1:08:28] revealed let me be honest if it wasn't
[1:08:30] for brother Graham I would be totally
[1:08:31] confused on all my doctrine I'd be the
[1:08:34] most confused preacher that ever walked
[1:08:37] the earth I probably even be a preacher
[1:08:38] could I be so confused because well a
[1:08:42] born-again or not winning when you get
[1:08:44] saved because I see it amongst my
[1:08:45] friends they go from this doctrine to
[1:08:48] that one and they're not sure here then
[1:08:50] they're just in other words they're
[1:08:51] tossed like a wave but a Christian has
[1:08:54] to anchor a mint he's anchored in heaven
[1:08:56] hallelujah his anchor rest behind the
[1:08:58] veil praise God hey man so he lives holy
[1:09:02] he lives modestly he keeps the sin out
[1:09:04] of his life he knows where he stands why
[1:09:06] cause he's anchored in heaven the Bible
[1:09:08] said well so the anchor is for your soul
[1:09:11] is the hope of God that rests behind the
[1:09:13] inner veil in heaven so I just played it
[1:09:17] for you because I want you to know I'm
[1:09:18] not making this up I'm not doctoring the
[1:09:19] quotes
[1:09:20] I'm not splicing the quotes truth surely
[1:09:25] we're not much in this world we're
[1:09:26] looked down upon but God we believe
[1:09:28] we're accepted in Christ Jesus and he
[1:09:30] and return has given us Holy Ghost we
[1:09:32] love him that great third person the
[1:09:34] Trinity who burns through our hearts and
[1:09:39] we love him
[1:09:40] o Holy Spirit I thank you for your
[1:09:43] divine leading and how you led me here
[1:09:45] to Hammond Indiana
[1:09:48] oh mercy
[1:09:52] we love the third person of the Holy
[1:09:54] Trinity that told you is gonna shock you
[1:09:58] I'm shocked every time I read this
[1:10:00] actually because I've been so hammered
[1:10:02] you know God's not three gods you know
[1:10:03] not three but that's true but program
[1:10:05] didn't know that right away until God
[1:10:07] showed it to him
[1:10:08] next one now if Jesus is the same
[1:10:13] yesterday today and forever now we're
[1:10:14] 1952 and we do believe the Holy Spirit
[1:10:17] on earth today
[1:10:17] how many believes that well the Holy
[1:10:19] Spirit is the third person of God is
[1:10:21] that right the third person the Trinity
[1:10:22] Jesus Christ now he says Jesus Christ is
[1:10:25] the third person the Trinity I thought
[1:10:30] Jesus was the second person see he's
[1:10:33] just doing his best church you know did
[1:10:37] he say thou saith the Lord
[1:10:38] no he's doing the best he can sometimes
[1:10:41] he makes he slips and says things he
[1:10:43] shouldn't say 19 and 58 let him open
[1:10:49] your eyes he's the Holy Spirit the third
[1:10:52] person the Trinity here tonight to
[1:10:54] grease up your eyes with God Sal open
[1:10:57] your eyes
[1:10:58] the third person of the Trinity oh man
[1:11:04] this is this is a quite a thing Church
[1:11:07] got a big night now five months later he
[1:11:12] says the Trinity is wrong but here's the
[1:11:14] last time I found that he says it five
[1:11:16] months before the church age series now
[1:11:19] that's a beautiful thing right there
[1:11:20] because God said you need to write the
[1:11:22] the church age book to war in the nation
[1:11:24] and actually warn the world he said
[1:11:26] write the church age book for that
[1:11:27] purpose and see God wouldn't let them
[1:11:29] write that book until first he had the
[1:11:31] right revelation on the Godhead the
[1:11:33] Haiti man hallelujah he said now they're
[1:11:36] only be one difference that would keep
[1:11:38] Jesus from being the same that walks in
[1:11:39] Galilee has to be here with us tonight
[1:11:42] now remember that Jesus I'm talking
[1:11:43] about is the third person which is the
[1:11:45] Holy Spirit which is in us God in us Oh
[1:11:53] five months later the third person is
[1:11:55] wrong but man says this oh I'm sorry
[1:12:01] oh yeah yeah right okay here it is
[1:12:03] revelation of the church revelation of
[1:12:05] Jesus Christ he quotes Timothy 3:16 he
[1:12:09] says God not a third person or a prophet
[1:12:11] but God himself made manifest in human
[1:12:13] form now this is the revelation remember
[1:12:15] so now how about revelation before was
[1:12:19] these third-person Jesus Christ third
[1:12:20] person Holy Spirit three reports nice
[1:12:22] time a revelation and then a year later
[1:12:28] he says I know this is on tape
[1:12:31] don't get excited let me say this with
[1:12:32] godly love the hours approach I can't
[1:12:34] hold still these things too close to the
[1:12:36] coming see trinitarianism is of the
[1:12:39] devil I say that thus saith the Lord
[1:12:43] okay wow so we just have a complete
[1:12:49] change right a complete complete
[1:12:51] complete flip-flop now there's nothing
[1:12:54] wrong with that because you and I would
[1:12:55] have done the same thing I was a
[1:12:56] Trinitarian when I first got saved
[1:12:57] because I didn't even know what it was I
[1:12:59] just sang the songs that I called I just
[1:13:01] went along with everybody else you know
[1:13:03] he did that or whatever they do you know
[1:13:04] they just do it
[1:13:06] he's look where it come from the Nicene
[1:13:08] Council the Catholic Church come and
[1:13:10] rulership the word Trinity is not even
[1:13:11] mentioned the entire book of the Bible
[1:13:13] so far as three God's that's from Hell
[1:13:15] there's one God now do you believe that
[1:13:18] all these people that Trinitarians are
[1:13:20] of hell no sir I believe they're
[1:13:21] Christians see they can be saved
[1:13:23] Trinitarians can be saved now I don't
[1:13:26] have this quote up here but there's a
[1:13:27] quote from anointed ones at the end time
[1:13:29] where the RAM said if you make him
[1:13:30] second or third person he said you're
[1:13:33] lost you're lost if you make him a
[1:13:38] second or third person now see now we've
[1:13:41] got two quotes and neither am i neither
[1:13:43] of them are thus saith the Lord
[1:13:45] so which one you're gonna take so you
[1:13:47] believe the sign takes that one really
[1:13:48] hard to say look brother I'm saying
[1:13:50] every Trinitarian is lost and then the
[1:13:53] other side's like it's not saith the
[1:13:55] Lord they are lost so which one you
[1:13:59] gonna stand on I'm gonna stand on what
[1:14:01] the Bible said the Bible says Jesus will
[1:14:04] save all those who call upon the name of
[1:14:06] the Lord
[1:14:07] god amen remember Jesus grants salvation
[1:14:12] not according to the baptism at the
[1:14:15] white throne judgment he grants
[1:14:17] salvation for doing one of those six
[1:14:18] things and of course some of them will
[1:14:20] be saved because of their their
[1:14:21] confession in Christ but he gives six
[1:14:24] acts he gives them eternal life for
[1:14:27] doing six things never feeding the poor
[1:14:29] say I feeding the poor closing the poor
[1:14:32] visiting the sick I can't name all of
[1:14:34] them I could forget him after a few
[1:14:35] weeks I forget him so see Church you
[1:14:38] know you got to rightly divide the word
[1:14:40] so you got to take a stance and where do
[1:14:42] we want to stand we want to stand right
[1:14:43] with the Word of God and let me say this
[1:14:47] too we got to have grace if I'm wrong
[1:14:49] this of the church I don't want to be
[1:14:51] arrogant about it I want to be humble
[1:14:52] enough to say God if I'm wrong correct
[1:14:54] me another one I don't want to get in
[1:14:57] fights with preachers and say well well
[1:14:58] I'm right because I've got this and
[1:15:00] you're of the devil and I'll you're not
[1:15:02] you're no good I don't want to be like
[1:15:03] that I just want to like like Rison I
[1:15:05] agree with the brother a wonderful
[1:15:07] brother a pastor he's cheating he didn't
[1:15:09] see eye to eye with me on this statue
[1:15:10] River man well I said that's okay we're
[1:15:12] still brothers I mean that's okay I
[1:15:14] can't see it the other way I can't see
[1:15:16] it the way they see it how can you they
[1:15:20] say you get the Holy Ghost at faith well
[1:15:22] how can you how can you have the Holy
[1:15:24] Ghost with faith but not have virtue yet
[1:15:26] and you don't even have knowledge or
[1:15:29] temperance or godliness how can you have
[1:15:32] the Holy Ghost and not I probably
[1:15:33] kindness amen
[1:15:35] I don't see that but it's not something
[1:15:37] we're gonna argue and fight about praise
[1:15:39] God we're taking it back to the word and
[1:15:41] we're let the Holy Spirit show love
[1:15:44] it'll show brotherly kindness and
[1:15:46] meekness through us we're not going to
[1:15:48] be arrogant about it and we're gonna let
[1:15:50] the spirit of truth deal with each and
[1:15:52] every heart and reveal God's Word to
[1:15:54] them in the season when they need it
[1:15:56] praise God because church what is your
[1:15:59] life all about seasons praise God
[1:16:03] brother Aaron could only get the
[1:16:04] revelation at a certain season of his
[1:16:06] life but RAM always knew he was gonna go
[1:16:09] out west but it took the right season
[1:16:12] and the church said it's season he wrote
[1:16:17] a
[1:16:17] the West is a boy want to go out west
[1:16:19] far away the lonesome West but it had to
[1:16:21] be the right season I said like this
[1:16:23] you'll get the right revelation in the
[1:16:25] right season amen
[1:16:26] just wait upon the Lord keep believing
[1:16:28] in God keep worshiping God keep yourself
[1:16:31] humble before God
[1:16:32] make yourself meek like the meek one and
[1:16:34] he'll be able to teach you and you'll
[1:16:36] learn it in due season that's right but
[1:16:41] see Satan wants us to get all arrogant
[1:16:43] and argue against one another he wants
[1:16:45] Brandon's fighting against Brandon's
[1:16:46] right he wants us fighting each other so
[1:16:49] we'll stop fighting the devil right
[1:16:56] after the seals the Holy Ghost today is
[1:16:59] not no third person well you really got
[1:17:02] a mess because he's just a few years ago
[1:17:04] he said he is the third person if every
[1:17:06] word is the sat the Lord he said then
[1:17:08] that life that was in Christ is the Holy
[1:17:10] Spirit not the third person but the same
[1:17:13] person in the form of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:16] coming upon you as a token that your
[1:17:19] life and your fare is paid you've been
[1:17:22] accepted in the beloved amen
[1:17:25] okay the next one motor that makes a
[1:17:28] clear mistake in feast of the trumpets
[1:17:31] 1963 and I'll just read you the quote so
[1:17:37] he says he said frankly from the feast
[1:17:41] of Pentecost which was remember in the
[1:17:43] third month unto the feast of atonement
[1:17:45] which was in the seventh month I'm gonna
[1:17:48] show you the picture in a minute was
[1:17:51] fifty days so brother I'm saying there's
[1:17:54] fifty days from the third month to the
[1:17:57] seventh month is that possible no cuz
[1:18:00] there's thirty days in a month and
[1:18:02] they're four months apart
[1:18:04] so four times 30 is at least 120
[1:18:08] programs saying there's only 50 days
[1:18:10] Church he made a mistake and he admits
[1:18:12] it in a few months the next month he
[1:18:14] admits it he makes a mistake well how
[1:18:16] can that be now saith the Lord it's not
[1:18:19] he made a mistake now he and this is
[1:18:26] questions and answer
[1:18:27] like the other day I got something mixed
[1:18:30] up I happen to hear it's caught it right
[1:18:32] here and it's on tape and I'll probably
[1:18:34] hear from it when I was talking about
[1:18:36] the seven trumpets I said it was seven
[1:18:38] trumpets I was referring to the
[1:18:39] Pentecostal feast from the Pentecostal
[1:18:41] feast until the trumpets there was seven
[1:18:44] Sabbath's and that was his heir seven
[1:18:47] Savas was between the feast of Passover
[1:18:49] Pentecost II which made the 50-day sea
[1:18:51] but I was referring to that I said that
[1:18:53] means the seven Church ages but man was
[1:18:56] trying to say the seventh month
[1:18:58] represent the seventh Church ages but he
[1:19:00] said it wrong so Church day if you can't
[1:19:03] look up here if he if you can Pentecost
[1:19:06] was in the third month
[1:19:07] trumpets was in the seventh month and
[1:19:10] brother man said there's only 50 days
[1:19:11] from Pentecost well this is 30 60 90 120
[1:19:17] there's not 50 days from Pentecost to
[1:19:21] trumpets there's 120 days and he admits
[1:19:26] I made mistakes now how can that be thus
[1:19:29] saith the Lord
[1:19:30] it can't be because he says I mix it up
[1:19:32] and I love his words here oh I forgot to
[1:19:37] put those quotes on there I'm sorry let
[1:19:39] me I'll just I guess I just have to do
[1:19:42] this I don't know if I can zoom in or
[1:19:45] now I don't know if it works here or not
[1:19:47] let me just show you the quote yeah okay
[1:19:53] that's about as good as I can get but Oh
[1:19:55] skipped I don't like this app forgive me
[1:19:58] but you own us understand here okay and
[1:20:01] I says it's not seven Sabbath's no he
[1:20:04] said but if you happen to catch that on
[1:20:06] your tape remember look in the Bible you
[1:20:08] see it's seven months after that cut off
[1:20:11] seven months Jan your February March 7
[1:20:13] months which represents the full seven
[1:20:14] church ages but Rams trying to say the
[1:20:16] feasts of the trumpets takes place in
[1:20:18] the seventh month which represents the
[1:20:20] end of the seven chart changes that's
[1:20:23] what he's trying to say but even here he
[1:20:25] said it a little off - yes you just got
[1:20:27] to give him grace just like you give me
[1:20:29] grace we're not making fun of brother
[1:20:31] Ram just like you want to make fun of me
[1:20:33] or any other preacher
[1:20:34] we just make mistakes this is one of
[1:20:38] them
[1:20:38] beautiful quotes you'll ever hear a
[1:20:40] prophet of God say because it shows
[1:20:45] brother branham's absolute sorry yeah
[1:20:48] just keep man
[1:20:49] it shows his absolute was the Word of
[1:20:52] God there it is right there
[1:20:55] but if you happen to catch up on your
[1:20:57] tape remember look in the Bible it's one
[1:21:01] of the most powerful statements a
[1:21:03] prophet can make I'm gonna make mistakes
[1:21:05] if I get it wrong
[1:21:06] forgive me look in your Bible praise God
[1:21:09] amen
[1:21:10] that's the proof that bro Graham's
[1:21:12] absolute was the Bible which he said it
[1:21:14] was he never said he was the absolute he
[1:21:17] even said God's absolute is the Word of
[1:21:19] God amen
[1:21:20] how can God's absolute be the word and
[1:21:24] not brother Brandon and brother for
[1:21:25] every word he said was thus saith the
[1:21:26] Lord now you've got now we have a
[1:21:30] different absolute than God if brother
[1:21:32] Branham is our absolute this message and
[1:21:34] every word on the tape if that's the
[1:21:36] absolute then we have a different
[1:21:37] absolute than God because brother Aaron
[1:21:38] said God's absolute is his word because
[1:21:41] heaven earth shall pass away but God's
[1:21:43] word will never pass away hey man that's
[1:21:47] crazy the people would believe that but
[1:21:49] they do that's why I'm preaching this
[1:21:52] and because I want you to see it because
[1:21:56] of all the chatter now church this is
[1:21:58] this the people I fellowship with
[1:21:59] there's all the chatter I got chatter on
[1:22:01] the believe the sign side who's leaving
[1:22:02] the message who's lean brother man they
[1:22:04] got chatter on the other side of a
[1:22:05] Jefferson bill and you know with our
[1:22:07] pressures by the air and things like
[1:22:08] that
[1:22:08] Jeffersonville we love him I love us to
[1:22:10] love him I still pray for him that was
[1:22:12] brothers in our church most even we love
[1:22:14] him but see we got we got both sides
[1:22:16] here and with those are spirits on both
[1:22:19] sides trying to pull us away from the
[1:22:21] true Holy Spirit praise God okay then
[1:22:24] and that's hard to say that for up to
[1:22:25] say but I'm under the anointing praise
[1:22:27] God and when I'm under the only thing
[1:22:29] you don't matter what I say I try to be
[1:22:31] a vessel for the Holy Spirit so God can
[1:22:33] say whatever he wants to say and he
[1:22:35] knows I can handle it afterwards
[1:22:37] although I might cry or get upset or
[1:22:38] frustrated or be discouraged or get get
[1:22:42] abused or get octa made fun of that's
[1:22:44] fine he knows I can put up with it
[1:22:45] because he's holding my hand anyway he
[1:22:49] promised never to leave me
[1:22:50] forsake me praise God hey man he's never
[1:22:52] left me yet amen
[1:22:54] thank God for His mercy so see Church we
[1:22:57] got all this we got all this waves moan
[1:22:59] around us but the Bible said they and I
[1:23:03] hear there's there this right there in
[1:23:05] pieces for they without the fivefold
[1:23:07] ministry the true fivefold ministry will
[1:23:10] be tossed around like a bunch of waves
[1:23:12] amen you and I are on this on a ship
[1:23:16] that's got an anchor and our anchors not
[1:23:18] going down as I already said our anchors
[1:23:20] up to heaven praise God but all the
[1:23:23] other ships all the other doctrines all
[1:23:25] the other camps outside of the original
[1:23:27] Apostolic Faith they're all getting
[1:23:29] tossed around from one belief to another
[1:23:31] from one sin to another but you and I
[1:23:34] are anchored on the rock of ages' amen
[1:23:36] our anchor is hooked into heaven and
[1:23:38] hooked right at Jesus vesture where it
[1:23:41] says the Word of God amen
[1:23:43] that's a little anchor praise God and we
[1:23:46] got to stand in the midst of all that
[1:23:47] praise the Lord and these sermons should
[1:23:50] raise your faith in God's Word and you
[1:23:54] should keep listening about the RAM like
[1:23:55] we do in our house every night except
[1:23:57] the nights were here yeah
[1:23:59] you should keep listen rub Ram but just
[1:24:01] make sure you take everything back to
[1:24:03] the word cuz that's what he said he said
[1:24:05] prove some things though he said prove
[1:24:07] all things make sure your absolute is
[1:24:11] God's word and not a man a man
[1:24:14] that's right Church now we had a
[1:24:18] wonderful brother recently preached this
[1:24:20] quote and then I had to come buy a new a
[1:24:22] correction on it which is okay I
[1:24:24] understand not all the brothers are
[1:24:26] gonna have what I think that revelation
[1:24:27] I understand they might disagree with me
[1:24:30] they might say I got the wrong
[1:24:31] revelation I expect that when I might
[1:24:34] ministers in like we have brother keep
[1:24:35] coming and brother Troy they may preach
[1:24:38] things I don't agree with but the best
[1:24:39] thing is I get to come back and correct
[1:24:41] it praise God that's I love about being
[1:24:42] a pastor I love that praise God yeah
[1:24:45] that yeah I know that you're not gonna
[1:24:47] get fed the wrong thing and start
[1:24:49] believing the wrong thing like I said on
[1:24:51] Sunday when that famous preacher
[1:24:52] preached at the camp said he said
[1:24:54] brother he I'm not making fun at all but
[1:24:57] he just said it was such bonus he said
[1:24:59] brother Jesus is in heaven Jesus is in
[1:25:02] you speak what you want well
[1:25:04] you need speaker right now now that may
[1:25:05] be God but I know for sure Jesus is
[1:25:09] still in heaven I know that the Bible
[1:25:12] says he must remain in heaven until the
[1:25:14] restitution of all things amen but yet
[1:25:18] see they take the one quote from brother
[1:25:19] Branham which he corrected later and
[1:25:22] they make it they put so much emphasis
[1:25:24] in it like God's in you basically like
[1:25:27] your God now we know we're minor
[1:25:29] creators but see with all the people
[1:25:32] around all the influence all the
[1:25:33] excitement all the enthusiasm and yet
[1:25:35] people go to those get excited come home
[1:25:38] and they backslide where are they at for
[1:25:42] church where's all their enthusiasm but
[1:25:45] see that's why I like I like the
[1:25:46] enthusiasm of the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:47] Ghost praise God there's my enthusiasm
[1:25:50] you know it may struggle a little bit
[1:25:51] you know I may have a little mind
[1:25:53] battles here and there but I've anchored
[1:25:55] praise God my brother and said we live
[1:25:57] the same way every day praise God
[1:25:59] we're strong in the faith every day we
[1:26:00] got struggles but we're not back sided
[1:26:02] in all the things of the world and
[1:26:04] things like that were anchored in Christ
[1:26:05] Jesus Satan sealed out amen and the Holy
[1:26:08] Ghost is sealed in praise the Lord Amen
[1:26:12] so I just thought I'd share that's why I
[1:26:14] love being a pastor no wonder God called
[1:26:16] me to be a pastor because I love for the
[1:26:17] people to know the truth
[1:26:19] I'd love to come back and tell you what
[1:26:21] the truth is not most of time off it's
[1:26:23] true but every now and then you get
[1:26:25] little thoughts that you know I don't
[1:26:27] think are helpful to you and I want I
[1:26:28] like to correct it so program in 1957
[1:26:32] said now you when you believe on the
[1:26:33] Lord Jesus Christ you have the new birth
[1:26:35] now that that's that's wrong later he
[1:26:37] corrected it when you believe on the
[1:26:40] Lord you receive a new thought a new
[1:26:41] life but it isn't the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:26:43] see you got the new birth when you
[1:26:47] believe you got eternal life so by man
[1:26:48] here saying the new birth is when you're
[1:26:50] saved and the baptism is when you're
[1:26:52] filled that's what he's saying because
[1:26:53] he says it later he said see but the new
[1:26:55] birth is not the baptism Holy Spirit the
[1:26:57] scripture doesn't support it I don't
[1:26:59] think see to my way of seeing it 19 this
[1:27:03] is 1962 this is right before the stature
[1:27:06] of a man and he even had it mixed up in
[1:27:07] the stage fervor man if you study the
[1:27:09] scriptures and the quotes now I am
[1:27:13] against organized religion I never
[1:27:14] thought there was a person believed like
[1:27:16] me to this morning
[1:27:17] I heard Charles fuller as I was going
[1:27:19] down he believes too that the new birth
[1:27:21] is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:27:25] new birth is being born the Holy Ghost
[1:27:27] is the baptism so Romero says when you
[1:27:31] come to the altar and you get saved and
[1:27:33] you weep and cry he was saying that's
[1:27:34] the new birth but then later you got to
[1:27:37] get filled that was the baptism but we
[1:27:39] know it's all the same thing getting
[1:27:41] saved is just getting saved I I get
[1:27:44] baptized but now you got to get
[1:27:46] sanctified you haven't had the new birth
[1:27:48] yet you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:27:49] baptism yet
[1:27:50] that's the third work of grace amen now
[1:27:56] he corrects it in 1963 after the seals
[1:27:59] in the token message when God do you
[1:28:02] though about true baptism Holy Spirit
[1:28:04] then the life of Jesus Christ is within
[1:28:06] you now that's true and everything
[1:28:08] allows you have to admit that to be yes
[1:28:09] so it's the new birth you are born to
[1:28:11] new of the Holy Ghost holiday yeah the
[1:28:16] baptism is the new birth but yet we had
[1:28:21] a preacher not long ago preset to us so
[1:28:22] that they're not the same for all
[1:28:23] confusion so what do we have to do bring
[1:28:26] bringing of the truth and they thank the
[1:28:29] Lord for that I mean like I said like I
[1:28:30] said I'm sure I don't have everything
[1:28:31] right I'm human I make mistakes but I
[1:28:34] want to rightly divide everything and I
[1:28:36] want the Holy Spirit to correct us so we
[1:28:37] can walk in truth now the church age
[1:28:41] book is the most plain thing he's
[1:28:44] talking about when he's calling sinners
[1:28:45] down to be saved he said in other words
[1:28:50] to be born of the Spirit is to be truly
[1:28:53] baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one
[1:28:55] and the same what is the baptism Holy
[1:28:58] Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you
[1:29:00] into the body of Christ it is the new
[1:29:03] burners and the church said so you can
[1:29:07] see it in the token of 63 and the church
[1:29:09] age book he's saying it's all the same
[1:29:11] thing the third work of grace is the new
[1:29:14] birth praise God in fact can I show you
[1:29:17] something real quick
[1:29:18] I'm Eva Paul I just had a thought here I
[1:29:20] just wrote I finished this chapter on
[1:29:22] Christ and use the hope of glory it's a
[1:29:24] mystery the Bible calls it a mystery
[1:29:25] you've probably known that if you've
[1:29:27] been around here long enough but you
[1:29:29] should see all the terminology for
[1:29:32] the baptism the Holy Ghost in church the
[1:29:34] beautiful thing is none of its even in
[1:29:36] the none of its even in the Old
[1:29:38] Testament now here's the thirty three
[1:29:40] works of grace I hope you can see that
[1:29:41] justification sanctification Batson oh
[1:29:43] he goes you have all three new heart new
[1:29:46] spirit my spirit from Ezekiel Jesus said
[1:29:49] get a blade a year than a full cord
[1:29:51] jesus prayed sanctify them what the
[1:29:54] night he was arrested he said sanctify
[1:29:56] them through thy truth thy Word is truth
[1:29:59] they walk within three deaf years
[1:30:01] brother a and he said they still need
[1:30:03] sanctified amen
[1:30:04] they'd seen miracles he'd walked on
[1:30:06] water they raised the dead all kinds of
[1:30:09] things but they weren't sanctified yet
[1:30:11] because they're arguing about who's
[1:30:12] greater like where we got a lot of got a
[1:30:15] preacher's doing that today - who's
[1:30:17] greater who's got the better revelation
[1:30:20] help us Jesus and then the Batson's only
[1:30:24] ghosts now look I went through the just
[1:30:26] a few church these are all speaking of
[1:30:30] the same thing oh when you're converted
[1:30:32] that's the Holy Ghost this is a new
[1:30:34] birth when you're in do with power from
[1:30:37] on high
[1:30:37] that's the Holy Ghost baptism when you
[1:30:40] get born again new birth that's the
[1:30:41] baptism when you receive eternal life
[1:30:43] that's the new birth when you have love
[1:30:46] or charity that's the new birth when you
[1:30:48] wave you have the spirit dwelling in you
[1:30:50] that's the Holy Ghost when you have the
[1:30:53] spirit of adoption that's the Holy Ghost
[1:30:54] can I go on when you've got the spirit
[1:30:59] of death when you have to file our
[1:31:00] dwelling and walk in you you got the new
[1:31:02] birth when you've got the seal you've
[1:31:04] got the new birth when you have Christ
[1:31:06] in you you're baptized with the Holy
[1:31:08] Ghost when your wash of regeneration and
[1:31:11] renewing as all the ghosts you're born
[1:31:12] again when your robes are washed and
[1:31:16] made white with the blood lamp you're
[1:31:18] born again amen how do you think all
[1:31:22] those phrases are not found in the Old
[1:31:25] Testament because the Bible said God hid
[1:31:27] it from the Old Testament he hid it from
[1:31:30] ages and from generations and Paul said
[1:31:32] it was hidden from all those 4,000 years
[1:31:34] but it's revealed now Christ not above
[1:31:37] you Christ not with you but Christ in
[1:31:40] you amen all these terminologies it's
[1:31:43] all one the same
[1:31:45] it's Christ in you the baptism with all
[1:31:47] he goes that new birth its Christ in you
[1:31:49] the hope of glory cleared up all that
[1:31:53] confusion now this is why I would have
[1:31:54] been I've been totally confused
[1:31:56] sister Naomi if I didn't have brother
[1:31:58] Brandon cuz he cleared it all up for me
[1:32:02] those quotes clear and all up for if not
[1:32:04] you got people say oh you can have faith
[1:32:06] on the stature and still be born again
[1:32:08] how can you be born again without the
[1:32:09] brotherly kindness how does God can let
[1:32:12] somebody in his family without brother
[1:32:15] kindness oh thank you Lord but see if
[1:32:20] you got the right revelation by the Ray
[1:32:22] charity is the Holy Ghost charity is the
[1:32:26] Holy Ghost so you got a brotherly
[1:32:27] kindness and then what comes next love
[1:32:29] or charity see when you rightly divide
[1:32:33] the right way you get the right doctrine
[1:32:34] if you don't you get the wrong doctrine
[1:32:36] you get a lot of confusion
[1:32:37] oh I'm filled with the Holy Ghost but I
[1:32:40] don't have patience yet are you are you
[1:32:41] serious you think God's gonna give
[1:32:43] somebody the Holy Ghost and you don't
[1:32:44] have patience yet but what kind of
[1:32:47] person would that be oh I got the Holy
[1:32:49] Ghost but I get mad at my husband or
[1:32:51] wife every day like I'm impatient oh
[1:32:53] come on
[1:32:55] see it clears up all the confusion all
[1:32:58] the misunderstanding but what does it
[1:32:59] take it does take the gift of the Holy
[1:33:01] Spirit to rightly divide the word that's
[1:33:04] my program said it's the most important
[1:33:06] thing of our day not to magnify the
[1:33:08] fivefold but so the fivefold ministry is
[1:33:10] fulfilled as Jesus wanted it to be glory
[1:33:17] now look at this church this is one
[1:33:19] chapter look at this I got thirty three
[1:33:21] thousand words on this one revelation I
[1:33:23] worked on this for five months on this
[1:33:26] one chapter I mean when Paul says it's
[1:33:30] was hidden from all those ages it was it
[1:33:32] was a great mystery and you can teach it
[1:33:35] you can just teach it from every angle
[1:33:37] there's just so much to be taught that's
[1:33:39] the thing ah no wonder the Bible said
[1:33:44] Jesus did so much you could write books
[1:33:45] about it and it would you wouldn't have
[1:33:47] room for it in the earth just like the
[1:33:49] Word of God it's so my dad said you
[1:33:51] could preach you said you could preach a
[1:33:52] month on just one seal never scratch the
[1:33:55] surface of it right
[1:33:56] that's true I can write 33,000 words
[1:33:59] about one mystery I don't even
[1:34:00] scratching the surface on that's true
[1:34:03] church 33,000 words now hope that's
[1:34:10] helping you now where am I on time I
[1:34:12] don't wanna get sick I need to stop here
[1:34:13] written just let me said time here I
[1:34:14] told my wife I said I forgot to set a
[1:34:16] timer give me ten more minutes
[1:34:19] what's that I meant 56 okay about an
[1:34:22] hour okay that's good
[1:34:23] now here we go let's finish with these
[1:34:26] thoughts see I feel I feel also bad like
[1:34:32] I'm getting sick and getting tired but
[1:34:34] then when the anointing gets on me I
[1:34:35] feel like I'm a new man okay now on the
[1:34:37] way home my wife will see I started to
[1:34:38] get come down again you know the kids
[1:34:41] will see me by the time I get home I'm
[1:34:43] all tired but while we're here
[1:34:45] worshiping you know we're under the
[1:34:46] anointing and we're rejoicing I'm
[1:34:49] sneezing you know at work
[1:34:51] he got already knows we're here I don't
[1:34:53] feel good I'm fine yeah he's good so
[1:34:56] about a I've said each person is three
[1:34:59] persons you know he said that do you
[1:35:02] know he said he was three persons what
[1:35:04] is it it's a slip of the tongue
[1:35:07] buh-bam said there's three people of you
[1:35:09] there's three people of you you're three
[1:35:11] people this is a night this is like a
[1:35:14] less than a month before he died he's
[1:35:16] just a slip of the tongue it's just like
[1:35:17] a you just said the wrong word he said
[1:35:21] what he means is there's three parts to
[1:35:22] you that's what he means but he says
[1:35:24] there's three people of you and then he
[1:35:27] says see you're a dual person that's two
[1:35:29] persons three people and one well what
[1:35:31] are you two or three which one are you
[1:35:33] do or try persons and this is 64c he
[1:35:40] just he means you just have three parts
[1:35:42] to you that's what he means but a church
[1:35:45] if you make this thus saith the Lord
[1:35:46] then you are two persons or three
[1:35:49] persons which one are you are you two or
[1:35:53] three or more are you more you can't
[1:35:56] make
[1:35:56] these things thus saith the Lord you got
[1:35:58] to take every word back every word of
[1:36:00] his back to the word and like he said if
[1:36:03] you find some no wonder brother have
[1:36:05] said this so much mother Rhea if I'm
[1:36:07] preaching and you catch a seed in the
[1:36:09] cherry pie spit it out why did he say
[1:36:11] that because he knew I'm a man I'll say
[1:36:13] things wrong
[1:36:14] just spit that part out and don't but
[1:36:16] don't spit out the cherries those
[1:36:19] without the Lord Jesus Christ water
[1:36:21] baptism amen don't spit out the white
[1:36:24] horse rider is the Antichrist don't spit
[1:36:26] that out you'll be all confused
[1:36:28] oh yes now look at this brother Ram said
[1:36:35] he's three persons now see just like I
[1:36:39] am three persons listen to a church if
[1:36:44] you won't listen I'll send you a PDF you
[1:36:46] this file PDF you can listen to yourself
[1:36:49] what's he saying he means he said I'm
[1:36:52] three I fulfill it what he means I
[1:36:54] fulfill three roles to my children in my
[1:36:56] wife and my grandchildren sciama I'm a
[1:37:00] I'm a husband I'm a father and I'm I'm a
[1:37:04] grandpa
[1:37:04] he doesn't mean he's three individual
[1:37:06] persons he means he threw fulfills three
[1:37:08] roles of one person but he says it wrong
[1:37:12] if he's now brother Rams main argument
[1:37:17] against the Trinity is this you cannot
[1:37:20] be a person without being a personality
[1:37:23] that's why he says God is not three
[1:37:25] persons because if he's three persons
[1:37:27] he's got three different personalities
[1:37:30] right you're a separate he said and if
[1:37:35] you're a personality you're one
[1:37:36] personality too and he just said you're
[1:37:38] a dual person
[1:37:41] see when I study I find these over the
[1:37:44] years sister Naomi all these twenty
[1:37:46] years of preaching and I just kind of
[1:37:48] store him up and say well he's a man
[1:37:49] he's a man but I never preached him to
[1:37:51] you because I I don't want you I don't
[1:37:53] feel like you had to know that but now
[1:37:55] God's not gonna allow program to get
[1:37:57] worship without calling his people out
[1:38:00] of their praise God
[1:38:01] so he's allowing all these things that
[1:38:03] happen right because it's gonna it's
[1:38:05] gonna bring the believer to the top the
[1:38:07] one who really loves the Lord and
[1:38:10] who really loves God's messenger and
[1:38:12] respects him the right way not worship
[1:38:14] him but respects him and takes
[1:38:18] everything he says back to the word
[1:38:20] I've had these lain here for almost 20
[1:38:22] years
[1:38:23] well what I didn't know I was gonna use
[1:38:26] them but now it's time to use them and
[1:38:29] say it's helping people praise the Lord
[1:38:31] some of these people that are just
[1:38:32] coming in and wondering is he is every
[1:38:35] word I'll say the order was he a false
[1:38:36] prophet he's a genuine prophet but he's
[1:38:40] subject to make mistakes in his humanity
[1:38:42] just like you and that's why you could
[1:38:45] appreciate him more now look a month
[1:38:51] before he dies he says it right remember
[1:38:53] you're in a cycle of three but you're
[1:38:57] one person he said it even wrong after
[1:39:01] that I just showed you he said it a
[1:39:02] month less than a month before he died
[1:39:04] pardon me in December before he died he
[1:39:07] said there's three people of you and
[1:39:08] then but a month before that he said
[1:39:11] you're one person but you're in a cycle
[1:39:13] of three so you know say it right I'll
[1:39:16] say it wrong go say it right let's say
[1:39:17] it wrong but that doesn't stumble us
[1:39:19] because we know what he means he's not
[1:39:21] saying thus saith the Lord you're three
[1:39:23] persons he didn't say that he's just
[1:39:26] making a mistake he's just being a man
[1:39:29] he's just being a Smith he's just being
[1:39:33] a Hernandez we make mistakes right
[1:39:35] he's just being human it's part of the
[1:39:38] human experience here's one church I
[1:39:42] literally about shuddered when I heard
[1:39:44] my man say this he said Rebecca went out
[1:39:47] to meet her bride brother ma'am he left
[1:39:52] out the word groom if you make this thus
[1:39:57] saith the Lord now you've got some real
[1:39:59] strange doctrine you got Rebecca
[1:40:01] marrying a woman or you're calling Isaac
[1:40:04] a woman which one is it it's the state
[1:40:07] the Lord I play this one over and over
[1:40:09] again I was driving the car right I was
[1:40:11] like I was like hey Siri yeah I was like
[1:40:16] remind 30 minutes I'm sorry 30 sec
[1:40:20] let me hear it again I'm like well he
[1:40:22] said Rebecca wrote it on the camel
[1:40:24] jumped off right between the house of
[1:40:26] Abraham out in the field she met her
[1:40:28] bride can you imagine Rebecca running to
[1:40:30] meet her wife my goodness well that
[1:40:35] would be homosexuality and that's not
[1:40:38] saith the Lord oh we got some real
[1:40:40] problems
[1:40:40] these Jeffersonville people if they
[1:40:42] believe that they got some real problems
[1:40:43] either they're ignorant or they got our
[1:40:45] evil spirit on them now if they're
[1:40:47] ignorant and you show them the word and
[1:40:48] they get corrected that proves they have
[1:40:50] the right heart but if you show them and
[1:40:52] they still remain in it they got a spear
[1:40:54] on they've got a demon spirit on them to
[1:40:57] believe these things what does it do it
[1:40:58] exalts a man just like Shadrach Meshach
[1:41:01] and Abednego had to bow down to a man
[1:41:04] but we don't bow to any man we bow to
[1:41:07] the Lord Jesus Christ he says it and
[1:41:10] then he says the church is gonna marry a
[1:41:12] bride that's me and the church will meet
[1:41:16] our bride in the air everybody listening
[1:41:20] tonight have I shocked you too many
[1:41:22] times and now you're just like totally
[1:41:24] shocked over and you get a handle
[1:41:26] anymore now look he corrects it he said
[1:41:31] he quotes first Thessalonians 5 I'm
[1:41:33] sorry first that's what it's for
[1:41:34] there's my man mistake again we'll be
[1:41:36] caught up together to meet the Lord in
[1:41:39] the air
[1:41:41] see he just leaves out groom leaves out
[1:41:44] groom that's all I didn't because he
[1:41:47] corrects it well a year later she wrote
[1:41:49] to meet her unseen bridegroom groom now
[1:41:53] he's got it he's got it
[1:41:54] a year later he's got it now it's bride
[1:41:57] groom yeah next time somebody tells you
[1:42:04] every word he said was I said oh okay
[1:42:06] well which woman didn't Rebecca marry
[1:42:08] then right or
[1:42:12] come there still tree stumps out here if
[1:42:15] 1977 Artie came to pass and we already
[1:42:17] were supposed to have total annihilation
[1:42:18] by 77 how come we got tree stumps I'm
[1:42:22] sorry full-grown trees how come the
[1:42:24] world systems are still going on if
[1:42:26] we've got the stay at the Lord on 1977
[1:42:29] because it wasn't the state alone that's
[1:42:31] why this was shocking to my wife on this
[1:42:36] one and I've heard it before I forgot
[1:42:38] about it but she reminded me of it
[1:42:39] brother branham said mary had the egg
[1:42:42] when Jesus was conceived and the germ
[1:42:45] came from God the crater who made it
[1:42:48] sibel Ram said it was half Mary which
[1:42:50] would have been sin nature and then half
[1:42:53] divine you see that then later he says
[1:42:59] God created the baby both egg and blood
[1:43:03] sea just made a mistake
[1:43:06] he thought Mary had a partner because he
[1:43:08] knew Jesus was fully human so at one
[1:43:11] point he thought well Mary must have
[1:43:12] gave her egg and God gave the germ then
[1:43:15] he corrects it says no God did both and
[1:43:19] then the egg wasn't Mary so he said here
[1:43:23] the egg Mary had the egg but here he
[1:43:26] said DANC wasn't married which one is it
[1:43:29] this one this one now here's one for our
[1:43:36] sister's boy this will really be a doozy
[1:43:39] here for our sisters in this servant
[1:43:44] brother Ram rebuke Jezebel and face
[1:43:47] makeup wearing about five or more times
[1:43:50] he just hammers a painted face Jezebel
[1:43:53] but look he says if you don't have any
[1:43:54] hair and you want to let some hair
[1:43:56] that's all right maybe wear one of those
[1:43:58] like look look like a human if you don't
[1:44:00] have any fingernails gonna get some
[1:44:02] fingernails don't get them like holes or
[1:44:04] navy beans and get real fingernails if
[1:44:06] you haven't got any of these things it's
[1:44:07] alright if you haven't got any teeth get
[1:44:09] you something to make you some get them
[1:44:11] but don't pull your god-given teeth out
[1:44:13] just because they're a little crooked
[1:44:14] and they're good teeth to get some don't
[1:44:18] dye your hair something like that look
[1:44:19] like something that come out of a mire
[1:44:21] somewhere don't now here's where people
[1:44:23] this is where a church in Ohio stumbled
[1:44:26] now God eventually moved the pastor out
[1:44:29] because of his false doctrine but look
[1:44:32] if you're colourless and you want to
[1:44:34] make yourself look like you got some
[1:44:35] color it's alright I might imagine but
[1:44:38] don't make yourself look like Jezebel
[1:44:40] like a barn somewhere being painted now
[1:44:45] this is an interesting quote he couldn't
[1:44:47] mean hair because he was talking about
[1:44:49] hair but a church in Ohio took this is
[1:44:53] painting the faces and the pastors are
[1:44:56] allowing the women to paint their faces
[1:44:57] that was one sign I knew that pastor was
[1:44:59] off the word another sign was that he
[1:45:01] let his children listen to rock and roll
[1:45:02] well about five years later he left a
[1:45:05] message he don't believe it he lets his
[1:45:08] girls cut their hair where show off
[1:45:11] their belly buttons and wears men's
[1:45:12] pants and all kinds of things now I know
[1:45:15] I can't explain this but all's I know is
[1:45:18] that the Bible names make up three times
[1:45:21] and condemns at all three times all
[1:45:24] three women that wore makeup Jezebel and
[1:45:26] Israel twice were condemned and then he
[1:45:31] says this he said I don't care where you
[1:45:33] have a birth it's a new birth it will
[1:45:35] make you and ball and wash all
[1:45:37] there's a rhyme squall ball all
[1:45:39] something dr. Seuss Baja and wash
[1:45:43] all that paint off your face it'll do
[1:45:45] things for you that you didn't think you
[1:45:47] do you carry on like that you never to
[1:45:49] do
[1:45:49] he said it's a mess how much makeup does
[1:45:53] the Holy Ghost take off all of it so I
[1:45:58] can't explain that quote I really even
[1:45:59] to this day I'm just a pair I'm just
[1:46:01] guessing I don't know
[1:46:01] but just like the other ones I'm just
[1:46:03] guessing I don't know why he said that I
[1:46:06] don't know why I said let's invite the
[1:46:08] third person in Trinity to come I don't
[1:46:09] know why I said that he says such a
[1:46:14] conglomeration of sin when they where
[1:46:16] painted faces shows there they're at war
[1:46:18] with God when they take it off shows
[1:46:20] they're at peace with God take it off
[1:46:23] take the makeup off he says the my
[1:46:27] brother have saw the preview of the
[1:46:28] bride how much makeup did she have on
[1:46:30] none all right let's say into our feet
[1:46:35] I've ever stopped right here I'll go all
[1:46:36] night and then I'll get sick and I don't
[1:46:40] wanna get sick I want to be healthy
[1:46:41] right like I said I got the other ones
[1:46:43] Lord willing next Wednesday but Ram said
[1:46:46] only 700 and bother knee our bodies are
[1:46:49] made up of 80 percent water and
[1:46:50] petroleum petroleum is crude oil it'll
[1:46:52] make you sick brother Ram there's times
[1:46:56] he makes it sound like when Jesus opens
[1:46:58] the seals there's no more redemption and
[1:47:00] people wondered and so they had to ask
[1:47:02] him yeah all right musicians if you'll
[1:47:06] come by God's grace praise God now can
[1:47:14] everybody see why this is important it's
[1:47:21] not you know it's not a sermon that
[1:47:23] should be boring it's not a sermon that
[1:47:25] is unnecessary it's necessary because
[1:47:29] the spirit searches all things yay the
[1:47:33] deep things of God and all these things
[1:47:37] on many of these doctrines people have
[1:47:39] taken them and gone off into sin
[1:47:41] especially that make up one especially
[1:47:44] that Jesus on the throne no more because
[1:47:46] it actually makes them God right and
[1:47:49] then we get that bride worship doctrine
[1:47:51] over in Philippines I heard about that
[1:47:52] years ago
[1:47:53] that's all I actually saw some people
[1:47:54] believe that we should worship the bride
[1:47:56] because the bride's one with Christ and
[1:48:01] see it's important to have the spirit of
[1:48:04] truth because it will direct you to the
[1:48:05] word and the word is a filter it'll
[1:48:08] filter out all the sin out of your life
[1:48:10] praise God hey mom
[1:48:12] thank the Lord yeah so none of these
[1:48:16] church
[1:48:16] none of these are new to me they might
[1:48:18] be new to you and if so may God help you
[1:48:20] to understand let me say this just be
[1:48:22] patient you don't understand something
[1:48:24] just just hang with the word it's okay
[1:48:28] to put things on the Shelf right at some
[1:48:32] point you have to bring it off the shelf
[1:48:34] and show what's right or wrong and we're
[1:48:37] not scared to do that in fact it looks
[1:48:39] like God's gonna make every word we take
[1:48:41] off the shelf every words gonna have to
[1:48:43] be proven to be the word and we're happy
[1:48:46] about that we're not scared about that
[1:48:47] grab it cuz we've got the faith of the
[1:48:51] Apostolic fathers it's being restored
[1:48:55] amen without leaning upon man we're
[1:48:58] leaning upon the Holy Spirit praise God
[1:49:01] let's just bow our heads here for a
[1:49:02] moment
[1:49:02] I appreciate you Church and I hope this
[1:49:10] was the help if you have any questions
[1:49:11] make sure you text me or email me or
[1:49:12] talk to me afterwards I'll do the very
[1:49:14] best I can like I said I'm going on the
[1:49:16] Jeffersonville side first attack that
[1:49:18] idolatry and then I'll attack that lust
[1:49:20] fear on the other side I said the
[1:49:22] program wasn't a prophet and then
[1:49:23] because that they get to throw off the
[1:49:24] Bible I don't have to be holy I'm so BAE
[1:49:28] I'll give you a free woman I can be a
[1:49:30] free man and all kinds of trash like
[1:49:32] that let's be real Holy Ghost filled
[1:49:36] Saints praise God let's believe every
[1:49:38] word let's prove all things by the word
[1:49:40] of God Heavenly Father Lord we're
[1:49:43] thankful for tonight we love you Lord
[1:49:45] we've come to this season and your Bible
[1:49:48] says a word and spoken season how sweet
[1:49:51] it is thank you Lord father baby we've
[1:49:55] wondered about these things for years I
[1:49:56] remember Jose told me on Sunday he'd
[1:49:59] wondered about that question for 20
[1:50:01] years and the Holy Spirit answered just
[1:50:03] last Sunday
[1:50:03] thank you Lord you're rich in mercy Lord
[1:50:06] you're gracious and you do everything
[1:50:08] according to your glory your season for
[1:50:12] purpose Lord we love you tonight nor let
[1:50:15] our confidence raise in the holy spirit
[1:50:17] that it raised in the Word of God then
[1:50:19] we keep listening your prophet and take
[1:50:21] every word back to the tapes and let the
[1:50:24] let us learn to discern by the power of
[1:50:27] the Holy Spirit let us grow in judgment
[1:50:30] grow in discernment Lord growing
[1:50:32] understanding for your wheel Lord God
[1:50:34] for your glory bless your people here
[1:50:36] tonight in Jesus Christ's name the
