[36:13] we learn from the in Jesus Christ's name
[36:15] Amen
[36:17] praise God let's say on our feet here
[36:18] let's take our Bibles here to go to
[36:20] Revelation chapter 19 let's continue on
[36:24] this revelation series kind of feeling
[36:27] led to do that so we'll look to the Lord
[36:29] here Revelation chapter 19 this ibly
[36:32] this is part 100 I think of this series
[36:35] we're kind of hitting a milestone there
[36:37] but let's ask the Lord to help us here
[36:40] as we read his word revelation 19
[36:44] I just want to choose a scripture later
[36:48] in the chapter to kind of build off of
[36:51] this thought as we look at revelation 19
[36:59] revelation 19 I like to just read verse
[37:01] 20 I want to start this chapter by
[37:04] looking at teaching on the beast and the
[37:08] mark of the beast I want to start there
[37:09] and then we'll look at the different
[37:13] topics and key revelations in this
[37:16] chapter so revelation 19 verse 20
[37:23] there's numerous themes in this chapter
[37:25] but let's look at verse 20 I like to
[37:28] look at the mark of the beast here to
[37:31] begin with tonight by God's grace first
[37:34] 20 let's read it together it's a long
[37:35] one but let's read it everybody gives a
[37:37] chance to read the Word of God verse
[37:39] twenty on three one two three and the
[37:42] Beast was taken and with him the false
[37:45] prophet that wrought miracles before him
[37:48] with which he deceived them that had
[37:51] received the mark of the beast and them
[37:54] that worshipped His image these both
[37:57] were cast alive into a lake of fire
[38:00] burning with brimstone quite a sobering
[38:03] scripture but it's in the scripture
[38:05] nonetheless and God's a God of justice
[38:08] God's a serious God God's a loving God
[38:10] but he's also a judge as well praise God
[38:14] so may God has blessing the reading of
[38:16] word you may be tonight we're beginning
[38:23] revelation 19 tonight we'll see how many
[38:25] sermons looks like maybe two or three
[38:27] we'll get from this as you probably
[38:30] noticed we spent the majority of the
[38:32] sermons on Revelation chapters 1 2 3 4 5
[38:44] afters and of course we had a lot we had
[38:47] numerous Bert or sermons I think we had
[38:49] five or six verse or sermons rather on
[38:51] revelation 17 and 18 so now we're
[38:54] getting toward the end hard to believe
[38:55] we're almost at the end of the book
[38:57] already preaching every verse but let's
[38:59] look at a few themes here now the themes
[39:02] in order are the first theme is heavens
[39:07] praise to God at the judgment of the
[39:10] great so we see that at the begin
[39:16] of the chapter verses 1 to 6 and then
[39:18] verses 7 to 10 is the second theme which
[39:20] is the marriage supper of the Lamb
[39:22] praise God
[39:23] how many want to be there how many know
[39:26] you've been invited there praise God
[39:28] thank God all you have to do church is
[39:30] receive the invitation receive the gift
[39:34] of the Holy Ghost praise God that's the
[39:36] invitation then you've got to see that
[39:38] that table praise God there's a lot of
[39:40] banquets going on a lot of parties going
[39:42] on this weekend especially tomorrow
[39:43] there's parties in Washington DC there's
[39:46] parties all over the place but the one
[39:48] main celebration I want to be a part of
[39:50] is the marriage supper of the Lamb
[39:51] praise God that's the one I do I'll give
[39:54] up everything to make sure I'm at that
[39:55] party but we know it's not a party we
[39:58] know it's it's a supper praise the Lord
[40:00] and then verses 11 to 21 is Christ's
[40:06] return to the earth a white horse at the
[40:11] Battle of Armageddon that's a sobering
[40:14] portion of Scripture and if we're real
[40:18] Holy Ghost field Christians will be
[40:19] there but we won't be on the earth we'll
[40:22] be with him in the sky praise God and so
[40:25] that's a great promise that we're given
[40:27] and we want to make sure we make
[40:29] ourselves ready for that which is of
[40:31] course is in this chapter where the
[40:32] bride makes herself ready but I would
[40:35] like to now look at the mark of the
[40:36] beast and in verse 20 of Revelation 19
[40:39] the Bible says that the the whole world
[40:45] was deceived by the miracles of the
[40:47] false prophet and the beast and they
[40:52] deceived them on the earth to receive
[40:55] the mark of the beast
[40:58] and to worship His image and be the
[41:04] consequence of taking the mark and
[41:06] worship the image was being cast alive
[41:09] in the lake of fire
[41:11] so there's few things that could be as
[41:13] serious as this topic here tonight my
[41:16] because the punishment for is being
[41:19] tossed in the lake of fire where the
[41:22] Bible said you'll burn forever now not
[41:24] eternally because you can't burn
[41:26] eternally unless you have eternal life
[41:28] and God is too merciful to let sinners
[41:32] burn eternally God is too merciful for
[41:36] that picture let's say someone's a 16
[41:38] year old
[41:39] you know a 16 year old high school
[41:41] student and they let's say they hear the
[41:43] gospel they're raised in church and all
[41:45] those years let's say you know they get
[41:47] to the age of accountability whether
[41:48] it's 8 or 12 or 10 you know the role or
[41:51] the the Mormon Church has it's I believe
[41:53] I believe they say that's what their
[41:55] prophet revealed to them that 8 is the
[41:58] age of accountability well we don't
[42:00] really understand year-old teenager was
[42:06] raised in church all those years and
[42:08] kept turning down the gospel turning
[42:10] around the gospel let's say they go out
[42:12] one night they get drunk they get in a
[42:13] car accident and they die and let's say
[42:16] they only lived you know eight years in
[42:18] disobedience or four years or six years
[42:20] in disobedience to the Holy Spirit and
[42:22] let's say they blaspheme the Holy Spirit
[42:25] and they made fun of people who spoke in
[42:26] tongues at church or prophesied or
[42:29] dancing the Holy Spirit of church or
[42:30] they made fun of them and their soul is
[42:33] lost now God as a merciful God is not
[42:36] going to let that person burn eternally
[42:39] because he's too merciful praise God now
[42:42] someone like Hitler who ordered you know
[42:44] the death of over six million Jews now
[42:46] of course we know he'll have the Bible
[42:48] set a greater condemnation he may burn
[42:52] for let's say 20 million years or he may
[42:55] burn to me tormented for let's say 15
[42:57] million years he'll Brees gonna burn a
[42:59] long time he's gonna burn a lot longer
[43:00] than that 16 year-old teenager who
[43:03] turned down the Holy Ghost and made fun
[43:05] of the Holy Ghost so we know that God is
[43:08] not going to let them burn eternally
[43:09] because God is too merciful for that
[43:12] in church we saw last week that the mark
[43:15] of the beast and the mark of God is
[43:17] available and it has been available ever
[43:20] since the Garden of Eden amen oh yeah
[43:23] we're able was marked with a mark of God
[43:25] amen and because he had the mark of God
[43:28] he gave the right sacrifice and it made
[43:31] Cain so upset that Cain of course had
[43:33] the mark of the beast and he slew his
[43:35] brother because his brother was
[43:37] righteous and his works were not
[43:39] righteous amen and Cain proved he had
[43:41] the mark of the beast
[43:42] because God offered him the perfect will
[43:45] of God and he turned it down he got
[43:47] upset with God and he didn't want to
[43:49] obey God's Word
[43:50] proving he had the mark of the beast but
[43:53] Church we know today the marks available
[43:55] today to us amen and we the way were
[43:58] marked is by obeying the Word of God hey
[44:01] man that's why we're here tonight t
[44:03] here's word and obey the word and leave
[44:05] out of here better Christians more
[44:07] obedient Christians and when we came in
[44:09] praise God amen that's why we're here
[44:12] tonight
[44:13] now if you have your Bibles let's go to
[44:16] Revelation 13 17 and let's see there's
[44:21] going to be three ways people will take
[44:24] the mark of the beast after the rapture
[44:26] after Jesus snatches away his New
[44:29] Testament Holy Ghost filled Church
[44:31] because that's what the word caught up
[44:32] means in the Greek is snatch away to
[44:35] seize away quickly
[44:36] Jesus gonna quickly seize away the
[44:39] church in the rapture take them away
[44:41] like a thief in the night praise God
[44:43] and those that remain will the entire
[44:47] Earth will be forced to take the mark of
[44:49] the beast at one particular time and
[44:51] there's three ways they can take it now
[44:55] like we said it may culminate in a
[44:57] computer chip or something in their palm
[45:00] or in their hand or their forehead but
[45:02] we know it has to start with something
[45:04] spiritual because the same spiritual
[45:06] mark has always been here right the
[45:08] choice has always been here to take the
[45:10] mark of God the spiritual mark of God or
[45:12] the spiritual mark of the devil right so
[45:16] revelation 13 17 says this it says and
[45:19] that no man might buy or sell save that
[45:22] he had the mark or the name of the beast
[45:24] or the number of his name
[45:26] so after the rapture of the church Satan
[45:30] is going to have such a power
[45:31] politically and such a power
[45:34] ecclesiastically over the church that
[45:36] he's going to be able to force everyone
[45:38] to take a mark to buy or sell so he will
[45:42] have control over the bank system he
[45:45] will have control over every nation that
[45:47] we know there'll be one where there will
[45:49] be one world church
[45:50] there'll be one world government in
[45:52] other words all the governments will
[45:53] agree to work together financially right
[45:56] so it's going to come to pass where
[46:00] everyone is going to have to either take
[46:01] them the mark or the name or the number
[46:06] of his name
[46:07] so each one is fully proven in the
[46:10] scripture so let's look at the first one
[46:12] the first one is that a mark and the
[46:15] Bible said it can be in the right hand
[46:17] or in the forehead so the right hand
[46:21] symbolized in the Bible one who has a
[46:24] promise or makes an oath of allegiance
[46:27] to do the works of the beasts under the
[46:32] disguise of peace and safety so after
[46:35] the rapture that the government's are
[46:37] going to say let's all have peace and
[46:38] safety
[46:38] that's all peace and safety everyone
[46:40] needs to take this mark if you don't
[46:43] take this mark you're terrorists right
[46:46] that's what they're going to say because
[46:48] they're going to be saying peace and
[46:49] safety and and forcing people to take
[46:52] this mark so they're going to call
[46:53] everyone who doesn't agree with their
[46:55] system they're gonna call them a
[46:57] terrorist and say oh you want to start
[46:58] Wars and you want to go against the
[47:00] world Church in the world government and
[47:03] so they'll force them to try to take a
[47:06] mark now if you have your Bibles this is
[47:09] quite a good thought here let's go to a
[47:12] scriptures go to Psalms 144 maybe you
[47:15] never seen this but it's kind of been
[47:16] opening up here recently as you look to
[47:19] the scripture now remember we set on
[47:20] Sunday with rightly dividing the word of
[47:23] truth that the way to interpret the
[47:25] Bible is by the Bible right you take one
[47:29] scripture the way you understand that
[47:31] scripture is by looking what all the
[47:32] other scriptures say so if you look up
[47:35] the word right hand in the Bible this
[47:37] scripture in Psalms 144
[47:39] helps you understand what the mark and
[47:41] the right hand means so Psalms 144
[47:45] verses 8 to 11
[47:48] whose mouth speaketh vanity in their
[47:50] right hand is the right hand of
[47:52] falsehood see that so what is the right
[47:57] hand represent a reprehensive so if they
[48:01] take a mark in the right hand it means
[48:03] they're taking an oath a false oath
[48:06] they're making a promise to be a part of
[48:09] this one world Church this one will
[48:12] govern they're making a promise to do
[48:13] the works of the Beast it's a right hand
[48:16] of falsehood honey remember the book of
[48:19] Galatians where Paul said when he came
[48:20] to Jerusalem he gave Peter and James the
[48:23] right hand of fellowship amen so see
[48:27] that in the right hand of their gonna
[48:29] obey the Word of God they're gonna have
[48:31] an oath a promise we're all going to
[48:33] keep God's Word but with the mark beasts
[48:36] they're taking a right hand of falsehood
[48:39] it's a false covenant right it's a false
[48:43] promise they promise all we're gonna
[48:46] you're going to have peace you're going
[48:47] to have safety but little do they know
[48:49] that those trumpets are going to begin
[48:51] sounding aim ahead huh little do they
[48:54] know a man named Moses and Elijah are
[48:56] gonna step out in Jerusalem and start
[48:58] interrupting nature amen hahaha and the
[49:02] peace and safety is going to be taken
[49:04] from the world so see it's a false false
[49:08] Union it's a false promise according to
[49:11] the scripture the right hand of
[49:13] falsehood and they'll be deceived that
[49:16] way now I'm gonna skip down to verse 11
[49:20] rid me and deliver me from the hand of
[49:23] strange children whose mouth speaketh
[49:25] vanity and their right hand is the right
[49:27] hand of falsehood so see it again it's
[49:30] in two portions of Scripture and that
[49:31] beautiful how the Bible interprets
[49:33] itself praise God
[49:35] it's a false covenant it's a false
[49:38] promise they say oh if you just worship
[49:40] on our world Church we're gonna take
[49:42] care of you financially we're gonna take
[49:44] care of you physically and they'll have
[49:46] no ability to do it because the wrath of
[49:48] God is going to be poured out on them
[49:50] that's right
[49:53] so the right hand represents a right
[49:56] hand of falsehood these works of these
[49:58] promises to do the works of the church
[50:00] in falsehood the the claim that they
[50:03] will take care of them
[50:05] but it's false it's not true right now
[50:09] the mark now also yeah let's read
[50:14] another scripture let's read Deuteronomy
[50:16] 16 5 because hand represents works so
[50:21] see this is where they will promise yes
[50:23] I'll do the works of your church system
[50:25] yes I'll do the works of the government
[50:27] so see they're there they're promising
[50:30] to please man and please churches rather
[50:34] than please Christ the word Amen but it
[50:37] look good it'll look like it is a
[50:38] Christian Church love the name of
[50:40] Christian churches but it'll be a right
[50:42] hand of falsehood so Deuteronomy 16 15
[50:47] is what I said Deuteronomy 16 15
[50:57] Deuteronomy 16 15 7 days shalt thou keep
[51:04] a solemn feast and the LORD thy God and
[51:06] the place which the Lord shall choose
[51:08] because the LORD thy God shall bless
[51:10] thee and all thine increase and in the
[51:13] works of thine hands
[51:15] therefore I'm sorry thou therefore thou
[51:18] shalt surely rejoice so hand represents
[51:22] the works of your hands if you're
[51:24] obedient got to bless the works of your
[51:26] hands so this is a mark in the right
[51:30] hand so it's a lying promise it's a
[51:34] lying safety it's a lying promise
[51:37] through the works of the wrong system
[51:40] they're making a lie and they're
[51:42] promising to do the works of the Beast
[51:46] now let's look at the forehead now the
[51:50] forehead is the bone of course that
[51:52] protects the area of the brain known as
[51:55] the frontal lobe and that's where
[51:57] decisions are made right behind this
[51:58] bone right here that's where you make
[52:00] all your decisions so if somebody says
[52:02] you got a real hard head
[52:04] what's that mean it means you made up
[52:07] your mind you're persuaded and there's
[52:09] no way you can change your mind so the
[52:12] Bible said that the these sinners that
[52:15] worship The Devil's church and The
[52:17] Devil's government will take a mark in
[52:19] the right hand the works or in their
[52:22] forehead now of course we know what this
[52:26] means let's go to another scripture
[52:28] let's go to Ezekiel 3-1 just to have
[52:30] some some backing here because the again
[52:33] the Bible has to interpret itself the
[52:36] Bible will not contradict itself praise
[52:39] God hallelujah now he's speaking to the
[52:45] house of Israel in Ezekiel 3 verse 1 I'm
[52:48] sorry did I say that if I didn't forgive
[52:50] me has he killed 3 verse 1 he said
[52:52] moreover he said unto me son a man eat
[52:54] that now finest eat this roll and go
[52:57] speak under the house of Israel isn't it
[52:59] awesome God always likens believing the
[53:02] word as eating his word he told he told
[53:05] his ikki I'll eat this scroll praise God
[53:07] and he didn't mean literally eat it he
[53:10] meant believe it he meant make it a part
[53:13] of you make this your heart's desire and
[53:15] that's what God told John eat the roll
[53:17] and then go prophesy again to every
[53:20] people nation and tongue and kindred
[53:22] amen see that's what God wants us to do
[53:24] eat the word believe it make it a part
[53:27] of us and then speak it to other people
[53:29] we can't be a Christian and withhold the
[53:31] truth from other people we've got to
[53:33] believe it make it a part of us and then
[53:35] share it with somebody else Amen
[53:37] hallelujah so he said eat the rule now
[53:40] verse 8
[53:41] Ezekiel 3 verse 8 behold I have made
[53:44] that very strong against their faces and
[53:46] I for had strong against their foreheads
[53:49] so Godzilla tqo I'm gonna make your
[53:52] forehead strong because your forehead is
[53:55] gonna smash against their forehead
[53:57] you ever have a you ever have a
[53:59] disagreement like that you just disagree
[54:01] so hard with somebody it's like your
[54:03] foreheads are smashing against one
[54:04] another like they say go beat your head
[54:06] up against the wall right you everybody
[54:08] say that I was trying to talk to brother
[54:10] Jesse but it was like beating my head up
[54:12] against the wall
[54:14] see what that means we don't agree we
[54:17] don't see how
[54:18] we have no agreement right look at verse
[54:22] the next verse verse 9 3 9
[54:25] as an admin it harder than flint have i
[54:29] made thy forehead fear them not neither
[54:33] be dismayed at their looks though they
[54:35] be a rebellious house amen everything
[54:38] Ezekiel was going to be saying there to
[54:40] say we don't like this preaching we're
[54:41] not believing that and God didn't say
[54:43] well it's okay Ezekiel for you to be
[54:46] afraid and he said no I'm gonna make you
[54:48] strong I'm gonna make your forehead hard
[54:51] as well I'm gonna make you a real solid
[54:53] believer Amen just that's what we need
[54:56] we need to be so firm we need fully
[54:59] persuaded that we're going to serve
[55:00] Jesus Christ live a holy life we're not
[55:03] going to live the things in the world
[55:05] we're only gonna love the things of God
[55:07] we have to be such so convinced of that
[55:10] that's it's as if our foreheads are
[55:12] smashing against the devil's forehead
[55:15] like the rams light like those rams got
[55:18] the big horns and they smash together
[55:19] well that's what's happening tonight
[55:20] praise God that's what's happening
[55:23] tonight except you're battling evil
[55:25] spirits you're wrestling against
[55:26] spiritual principalities and powers and
[55:30] the powers of the air but the Bible said
[55:32] you can overcome by praying and prayer
[55:35] and all kinds of Prayer
[55:37] praying for everyone and the Bible said
[55:39] you'll stand with the armour of God amen
[55:42] finally mud be strong in the Lord and
[55:44] the power of is my amen
[55:47] where's the power the powers in your
[55:49] mind you've made it up in your mind I'm
[55:51] going through with Jesus and I'm not
[55:53] turning back praise God see God told his
[55:57] Buffy I'm making your forehead firm like
[56:00] stone the hardest stone because their
[56:02] foreheads are going to be strong like
[56:04] stone as well so see a forehead
[56:08] represents your bold and unashamed and
[56:12] that's in the scripture too let's go
[56:14] let's go to Jeremiah three verse three
[56:16] Jeremiah three verse three Isaiah
[56:19] Jeremiah lamentations Ezekiel Jeremiah
[56:22] three verse three oho glory
[56:29] see when you when you are really marked
[56:32] in your forehead what that means is
[56:34] you're unashamed of the gospel of Christ
[56:37] you're unashamed zekiel is God so don't
[56:41] be ashamed you don't don't be moved by
[56:44] their faces if the people give you mean
[56:46] looks while you're preaching don't be
[56:47] ashamed just preach the word amen and
[56:50] most you give me smiles tonight I
[56:52] appreciate that I don't feel like I'm
[56:53] beating up against anybody's for it
[56:55] because you're all believers thank God
[56:56] for that but there's been a few services
[56:58] in the past where I felt like I've been
[57:00] beaten my forehead against other
[57:01] people's foreheads but that's the way it
[57:03] has to be Church because God's Word
[57:05] God's people have to stand they have to
[57:08] pass the test amen and then if you pass
[57:11] the test that Bible said your faith will
[57:13] be more precious than gold amen
[57:15] hallelujah and it's done through a
[57:18] forehead in other words a mine that's so
[57:21] convinced that Christ is them are your
[57:23] Lord and your Messiah that you're not
[57:25] turning back Jeremiah 3 verse 3
[57:29] therefore the showers have been with
[57:31] Holden and there have been no latter
[57:33] rain now hats off a horse for head now
[57:36] refuses to be ashamed so just like the
[57:42] prostitute on the street that refuses to
[57:45] be ashamed of her immoral life that's
[57:47] how Israel was they were refused to be
[57:51] ashamed no matter what the preachers
[57:52] preach no matter what the Word of God
[57:54] said they didn't care they were
[57:56] unashamed they just lived however they
[57:58] wanted so you and I ought to thank God
[58:00] if we feel ashamed when we sin we ought
[58:03] to say praise the Lord
[58:04] right because Israel's had a spot where
[58:07] they didn't even feel ashamed if you put
[58:10] something on Facebook that wasn't right
[58:11] you ought to be ashamed you ought to
[58:13] take it down if you text somebody the
[58:15] wrong thing you ought to be ashamed to
[58:17] yourself and say please forgive me right
[58:20] you and I need to feel the shame of the
[58:22] Holy Spirit in other words the Holy
[58:24] Spirit Jesus said we'll can when the
[58:26] Holy Spirit comes in your life he'll
[58:28] convict you of sin aim ahead you'll be
[58:32] convicted of sin when if you're really
[58:35] sensitive to the Holy Spirit so see
[58:39] the mark in the hand is a false it's a
[58:43] false works that you're gonna agree to
[58:46] do the work of the Swart world church
[58:48] system the mark in the forehead is you
[58:51] believe all of their doctrine
[58:53] unashamedly right so instead of crying
[59:00] out against all the sins in the world
[59:03] they just go along with it and say it's
[59:05] okay we're all going to be saved anyway
[59:07] right that universalism lie over - the
[59:11] Bible says in Ezekiel 9 the Bible says
[59:13] he tells that writer with the ink court
[59:16] he says go throughout the city of
[59:17] Jerusalem and put a mark on the
[59:20] foreheads of those inside cry against
[59:23] the abominations done in the city have
[59:26] praised God Amen God said take holy
[59:29] spirits and take that mark a Matt and
[59:31] Mark it on their forehead of those who
[59:34] are so brother William they were they
[59:37] were so then they tried everything they
[59:40] could to try to get people to stop
[59:42] sitting so their last hope was to come
[59:44] to church and cry out to God and say God
[59:46] have mercy it makes me cry makes me weep
[59:50] my favorite fans and family keep sitting
[59:52] they keep living in sin and they won't
[59:54] repent and so God said those people that
[59:57] are so burden for sin that they'll come
[1:00:00] to church and cry and plead with God
[1:00:02] one-on-one in prayer he said I love that
[1:00:05] so much put a mark in their forehead
[1:00:06] that they're unashamed of cry out to God
[1:00:09] Amen oh that's what we need to be
[1:00:12] tonight praise God
[1:00:13] unashamed of the gospel that we cry out
[1:00:16] when when people won't receive the word
[1:00:18] we still cry and pray that's God to
[1:00:20] forgive them see both God followers and
[1:00:26] beast followers are going to be marked
[1:00:28] one way or another right you're going to
[1:00:30] be marked one way or another now I just
[1:00:33] that just remind me I believe this is a
[1:00:35] little bit inspiration the Holy Spirit
[1:00:37] but if you have your Bibles go to Acts
[1:00:40] chapter three just for a moment I read
[1:00:43] the scripture today and it really
[1:00:45] inspired me I'll property
[1:00:49] a full sermon at some point I'm just
[1:00:51] gonna bring it out because it's fresh
[1:00:53] inspired me go to x3 let's go to verse
[1:01:04] 18 see both sides are gonna be marked
[1:01:10] God's followers and then Satan's
[1:01:12] followers they're both going to be
[1:01:13] marked we've got the mark of God they
[1:01:17] have the mark of the devil verse 18 but
[1:01:20] those things which God before has shown
[1:01:21] by the mouth of all his prophets that
[1:01:23] Christ should suffer he hath so
[1:01:26] fulfilled right Christ died on the cross
[1:01:29] he suffered he bought sins not verse 19
[1:01:32] swear I want to get to repent ye
[1:01:34] therefore and be converted that your
[1:01:37] sins may be blotted out when the times
[1:01:40] of refreshing shall come from the
[1:01:43] presence of the Lord amen now since
[1:01:46] we're here let me 2021 and he shall send
[1:01:49] Jesus Christ which before was preached
[1:01:51] unto you now look at verse 21 Jesus
[1:01:54] Christ cannot come back in the rapture
[1:01:57] until all things are restored so
[1:02:01] everything in this Bible that Satan is
[1:02:03] taking away down through the two
[1:02:05] thousand years all the teaching that's
[1:02:07] been lost it all has to be brought back
[1:02:09] and then Jesus will come back amen
[1:02:12] look that's what the scripture says whom
[1:02:14] the heaven must receive see heaven has
[1:02:17] got to keep Jesus until the times of
[1:02:20] restitution which means restoration of
[1:02:22] all things which God has spoken by the
[1:02:26] mouth of all his holy prophets in the
[1:02:27] world began amen so see all the truth
[1:02:32] that Satan is stole from the church God
[1:02:34] is going to give it back to the true
[1:02:36] church and once she's got all of it and
[1:02:38] once she's living on it then Jesus will
[1:02:40] come back and take her away he's going
[1:02:43] to come snatch away it say it's time for
[1:02:45] our marriage supper darling it's time
[1:02:48] for our wedding reception now well both
[1:02:52] have said the meeting in the air will be
[1:02:54] the wedding and it'll take his rod to
[1:02:57] the wedding reception amen oh yeah and
[1:03:00] then the Millennium they go their
[1:03:02] honeymoon
[1:03:02] for a thousand years amen oh that's
[1:03:05] right church praise God
[1:03:07] but the thought I wanted to pull out of
[1:03:09] there was verse 19 Revelation I'm sorry
[1:03:14] acts 3:19 repent that your sins and be
[1:03:17] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:03:19] out
[1:03:20] look at this it's beautiful it's not
[1:03:22] just struck me today but the bang God's
[1:03:25] gonna brought out one of two things
[1:03:26] either he's gonna blot out our sins or
[1:03:29] he's gonna blot our name off the book of
[1:03:31] life he's gonna do he's got that power
[1:03:33] that blood
[1:03:34] he's got them and that blood blots
[1:03:37] things out right that blood erases sin
[1:03:40] or
[1:03:41] if that blood is not appreciated it
[1:03:44] races names off the book of life praise
[1:03:48] God so let's read that Revelation
[1:03:50] chapter 2 that's a new thought that
[1:03:52] struck me I never knew this brother
[1:03:53] William till today God Christ is gonna
[1:03:55] blot blot something with you one way or
[1:03:57] another he's gonna blot your name off or
[1:04:01] he's gonna brought your sins off all
[1:04:02] blood off my sins Jesus a let have a
[1:04:05] normal name Amen let my name not be
[1:04:09] missing in heaven let the Angels confess
[1:04:12] my name amen hallelujah Revelation
[1:04:15] chapter 2 if I'm not mistaken was in the
[1:04:21] second church aid your third see it just
[1:04:24] kind of came to me today I'll have to
[1:04:26] find it maybe it's a Thyer
[1:04:32] your church age let me look it up real
[1:04:40] quick I thought I would find it easier
[1:04:42] than that yep
[1:04:49] I'm sorry around we're looking the wrong
[1:04:50] chapter sorry yeah Thank You Lydia
[1:04:52] revelation 3:5 appreciate that honey
[1:04:54] he's it overcometh the same shall be
[1:04:57] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[1:04:59] blot out his name out of the book of
[1:05:02] life and I will confess his name before
[1:05:04] my father and before his angels eh hey
[1:05:06] Matt hi glory he's either gonna blot out
[1:05:09] one or the other
[1:05:10] the Bible said you have a list like a
[1:05:12] paper of ordinances that you I'm sorry
[1:05:15] of sins you've done against the
[1:05:16] ordinance of God and Jesus either gonna
[1:05:18] blot out all that sin against you so you
[1:05:20] have you have no sin on your account or
[1:05:22] he's gonna go the book of life and blot
[1:05:25] out the people's names who don't repent
[1:05:27] of their sins see the power of
[1:05:30] repentance when you say I'm no longer
[1:05:32] gonna cuss I'm no longer gonna hate my
[1:05:34] mother or father an order to fornicate
[1:05:36] or commit adultery I'm no longer gonna
[1:05:38] steal I'm gonna change I'm going to
[1:05:41] repent there's so much power in that
[1:05:43] that Jesus takes his blood and he blacks
[1:05:45] out all the sins that are against him
[1:05:47] amen
[1:05:47] it's so powerful praise God but if
[1:05:50] people won't do that if they won't
[1:05:52] repent Jesus will take his blood and
[1:05:54] he'll brought their name off the book of
[1:05:55] life so he's going to block something
[1:05:58] that pertains to us one way or the other
[1:06:01] praise God see that was kind of fresh to
[1:06:04] me today I didn't realize that but he's
[1:06:05] broadening out something pertaining to
[1:06:07] you and I amen
[1:06:11] he's only gonna do it if you overcome
[1:06:13] praise God he only does it for the
[1:06:16] overcomers praise God she must overcome
[1:06:19] all the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:06:21] the eyes and the pride of life if we
[1:06:23] overcome that he said I'm not brought
[1:06:25] your name I'll let your name remain on
[1:06:27] the book of life oh thank you lord raise
[1:06:30] god thank you Jesus and then he said
[1:06:33] I'll confess your name before my father
[1:06:36] oh hi Lou you know Graham said there's
[1:06:38] nothing sweeter than for you to hear
[1:06:40] your own name Jesus will say Malachi
[1:06:42] Smith I confess your name you were not
[1:06:45] ashamed of me
[1:06:46] you overcame the B system on up so I'm
[1:06:49] not ashamed to call you son hey there's
[1:06:54] nothing better than hearing your name
[1:06:57] right who doesn't like to see your name
[1:06:59] in the newspaper anywhere not like that
[1:07:00] now for good reasons right you like to
[1:07:03] hear your name on the on the news I like
[1:07:06] that oh that's me well MA thank the Lord
[1:07:09] well there's nothing sweeter than
[1:07:10] hearing your name and there could be
[1:07:13] nothing sweeter than seeing the Son of
[1:07:14] God with the nail scars in his hands and
[1:07:17] the nail scars on his feet
[1:07:18] confess your name before his invisible
[1:07:22] father amen
[1:07:23] nothing sweeter than that where he said
[1:07:26] well done
[1:07:27] Lydia Smith good and faithful servant
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:30] and turn the Joy's the Lord you were not
[1:07:32] ashamed of me so I'm not ashamed to call
[1:07:34] you friend Illya I took a quite a little
[1:07:41] while there but I just want to show you
[1:07:42] now you know so once the rapture goes
[1:07:45] they'll either take a mark in the hand
[1:07:46] they'll promise through the works of the
[1:07:48] church and the government or they'll be
[1:07:51] unashamed of the church or government
[1:07:53] and they'll take all their beliefs in
[1:07:55] their mind and so I'm not
[1:07:56] I almost I'm on the shame of this I I
[1:07:58] believe what this one world church is
[1:08:00] teaching and they'll be marked in their
[1:08:03] mind either marked in their mind or
[1:08:05] marked by their works now next second
[1:08:13] the Bible said that they'll take the the
[1:08:17] name of the beast now this could be
[1:08:21] twofold let's go to Revelation 13 let's
[1:08:24] go back there
[1:08:31] revelation 13 17
[1:08:43] I don't mean to hurt anyone's feeling he
[1:08:45] was a Catholic who's either live
[1:08:46] streaming or here but the name of the
[1:08:49] beast is the Vicar of Christ that's the
[1:08:53] name of the beast that's right
[1:09:01] so I you know what I think I may be in a
[1:09:03] moment I'll put up here I'm not quite
[1:09:04] ready for yet but let's read revelation
[1:09:06] 13 17 and that no man might buy or sell
[1:09:11] save he that had the mark or than the
[1:09:14] name of the beast so we went over the
[1:09:15] mark the marks on the right hand oh that
[1:09:16] forehead or the name of the beast or the
[1:09:19] number of his name
[1:09:23] okay so let me show this so we got it
[1:09:27] Lydia can you switch over here I'm gonna
[1:09:39] try to go into this here so everybody
[1:09:41] can see if you don't know it the name of
[1:09:43] the beast is the Vicar of Christ the
[1:09:46] other it is okay so in the in Latin Vic
[1:09:53] eres filet de means The Vicar of the son
[1:09:57] of God and so the name of the beast is
[1:10:02] the Vicar of Christ or the vicar of the
[1:10:05] son of God and who has that title the
[1:10:09] Pope of Rome and the Bible
[1:10:13] in verse revelation 13:18 that his
[1:10:17] number is three hundred threescore and
[1:10:19] six
[1:10:20] 666 so Latin is the alphanumeric
[1:10:23] language if you take the number of the
[1:10:25] letter if you add them all up at 666 and
[1:10:29] it can be no one else because number we
[1:10:32] already preached there's eleven proofs
[1:10:34] that this woman is the Roman Catholic
[1:10:37] Church those eleven proofs and it can be
[1:10:40] no one else it can't be New York it
[1:10:42] can't be Jerusalem
[1:10:43] it can't be Istanbul Turkey it can't be
[1:10:45] any of those it can only be the Vatican
[1:10:49] in Rome there can only be that one so
[1:10:52] the name of the beast the name of the
[1:10:55] Antichrist will be the Vicar of Christ
[1:10:58] now look what it says in the Catholic
[1:11:01] Encyclopedia it says that Pope has full
[1:11:05] supreme universal power over the whole
[1:11:08] church a power which he can always
[1:11:10] exercise unhindered vicar means
[1:11:13] substitute that means substitute he's
[1:11:15] the substitute for the Son of God right
[1:11:19] now look here's some other official
[1:11:22] titles you probably didn't know the Pope
[1:11:23] as Bishop of Rome Vicar of Jesus Christ
[1:11:27] listen this one successor of the Prince
[1:11:30] of the Apostles they call him that
[1:11:32] supreme pontiff of the universal church
[1:11:36] patriarch of the West primate of Italy
[1:11:42] metropolitan Archbishop of the province
[1:11:44] of Rome sovereign of the state of
[1:11:48] Vatican City and servant of the servants
[1:11:51] of God he's the servant of the servants
[1:11:55] ah what is the name of the Beast it has
[1:12:00] to be the Vicar of the son of God he
[1:12:04] takes all these names and he exalts
[1:12:06] himself where the Bible said in them in
[1:12:08] the tribulation
[1:12:09] he'll exalt himself as God because he'll
[1:12:12] sit in the temple of God showing himself
[1:12:14] that He is God no one else on earth can
[1:12:18] take all these titles no one else even
[1:12:20] dares to take all these titles like the
[1:12:22] Pope of Rome
[1:12:25] so see they'll either take the name of
[1:12:29] the beast
[1:12:29] either the mark in the forehand I'm
[1:12:31] sorry forehead or right hand or they'll
[1:12:33] take the name so anyone that says yes
[1:12:36] dear Vicar of Christ and they call the
[1:12:38] Pope anyone that boughs to that name
[1:12:40] takes the mark of the beast and not only
[1:12:44] that church we go to revelation 17:3
[1:12:48] let's say someone isn't really you know
[1:12:52] really big on the Pope they can still
[1:12:55] take the name of the beast another way
[1:12:57] because the Bible said the Beast is full
[1:13:00] of names of blasphemy sin other words
[1:13:04] she has many blasphemous names she
[1:13:09] revelation 17:3 see how sly Satan is he
[1:13:17] can either get you to take the muck in
[1:13:19] the hand the works the forehead where
[1:13:21] you're unashamed over there their
[1:13:23] doctrine their teachings and their ways
[1:13:24] or you could just say the Pope is the
[1:13:27] Vicar he's the son of God he's this
[1:13:29] mighty and he's gonna be a mighty
[1:13:30] miracle worker he's a great man I submit
[1:13:33] to him how I believe he's a man of God
[1:13:34] you could take the mark that way or you
[1:13:37] can take the mark by another name of the
[1:13:39] beast which is the names of blasphemy
[1:13:41] revelation 17:3
[1:13:43] so he carried me in the way in the
[1:13:45] spirit and the weirdness and I saw a
[1:13:46] woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast
[1:13:48] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[1:13:53] heads and ten horns
[1:13:57] see anytime a person is trusting in the
[1:14:00] name of a church rather than the name of
[1:14:03] Jesus Christ for salvation they've
[1:14:05] already taken a name of blasphemy for
[1:14:08] example if somebody says oh you're a
[1:14:09] Christian what are you if you say if
[1:14:12] you're proud of the fact I'm a Catholic
[1:14:13] I'm a Methodist I'm a Pentecostal I'm a
[1:14:16] Presbyterian I'm a message I'm of this
[1:14:18] or that if we take any credit to the
[1:14:21] name outside the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:23] we're getting close to blasphemy because
[1:14:27] this woman is full of blasphemous names
[1:14:31] right so she takes all these blasphemous
[1:14:34] names which can be Catholic Lutheran
[1:14:35] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian you
[1:14:38] any any name someone's trusting in
[1:14:41] rather than Jesus Christ is a
[1:14:42] blasphemous name because we all know
[1:14:48] church members who cuss and they
[1:14:50] blaspheme the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:52] they'll literally say I've heard people
[1:14:54] say they go to church yet they'll say
[1:14:56] they will say the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:57] as a cuss word see they've taken a
[1:15:00] blasphemous name right they're more
[1:15:03] loyal to their church name than they are
[1:15:04] to the name of Christ because they'll
[1:15:06] cost in the name of Christ they'll get
[1:15:11] drunk though they belong to church
[1:15:12] drunken drunkards will not inherit the
[1:15:14] kingdom of God yet they claim while I'm
[1:15:15] a good Luther I'm a good Baptist yet I
[1:15:18] get drunk at a wedding reception well
[1:15:21] you might be good Baptist but you know
[1:15:22] it's not a good Christian right and you
[1:15:27] could go with many many more sins but
[1:15:30] see these are names of blasphemy you can
[1:15:33] either take the mark in the you can
[1:15:34] either take the mark in the forehead or
[1:15:36] the hand or you can take the name of the
[1:15:38] beast in order buy or sell so as long as
[1:15:42] you you express a loyalty in a church
[1:15:44] rather than a loyalty to Christ Jesus
[1:15:46] the word you can still take the mark of
[1:15:49] the beast all right now let me move on
[1:15:53] from that one wait I'm sorry let me go
[1:15:55] to one more now this will prove it right
[1:15:56] here Church this will prove it Maya this
[1:15:58] is good revelation three verse one
[1:16:00] go to revelation three and liddy you can
[1:16:02] now switch off this and I think I don't
[1:16:03] have any more slides of the show I just
[1:16:07] want everybody to see that case they
[1:16:08] never saw that before revelation three
[1:16:11] verse one
[1:16:33] all right wherever
[1:16:35] I'm looking up another scripture because
[1:16:36] I'm gonna find a scripture here there it
[1:16:43] is yeah sorry I was looking up another
[1:16:45] one while you're turning this one
[1:16:47] sorry revelation 3 verse 1 and unto the
[1:16:49] Angel of the church in Sardis write
[1:16:50] these things saith he that hath the
[1:16:52] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[1:16:54] I know thy works that thou has a name
[1:16:57] that thou livest
[1:16:59] see so Jesus recognized there's people
[1:17:02] and churches that are trying to live a
[1:17:05] name but they're dead spiritually amen
[1:17:08] see people say well I'm a Lutheran but
[1:17:11] yet they don't obey what Luther said so
[1:17:13] they're dead right people say well um
[1:17:17] I'm a Baptist but they don't live what
[1:17:19] the Bible says they should live right so
[1:17:22] they have a name they live but they're
[1:17:24] dead and this is common that's why the
[1:17:27] zombie movement is so popular right now
[1:17:29] brother William because that's what's
[1:17:31] it's like in the spiritual people are
[1:17:33] saying they're alive but they're really
[1:17:35] dead and that's Scripture anyone who
[1:17:39] claims to be a follower of Christ but is
[1:17:41] not born again is dead right that's what
[1:17:46] Jesus said you have a name that you live
[1:17:48] but you're dead I know this is pretty
[1:17:51] harsh preaching but it's nothing about
[1:17:53] the truth amen go to first Timothy 5
[1:17:56] verse 6 I'll prove it to you now in this
[1:17:59] case Paul's talking about widowed women
[1:18:01] that when their husbands died he tells
[1:18:06] Timothy they should have just stayed
[1:18:07] true to the to God but instead they went
[1:18:10] and married some sinner just for sexual
[1:18:13] pleasure he said they should have
[1:18:16] remained widows 1st Timothy 5 lega verse
[1:18:23] 3 what's first Timothy 5-3 honor widows
[1:18:26] and are widows indeed but if any window
[1:18:28] have children or nephews let them learn
[1:18:29] first to show piety at home and to
[1:18:31] requite their parents for that is good
[1:18:33] and acceptable in before God verse 5 but
[1:18:36] she there's a widow indeed in desolate
[1:18:38] trust in God and continue with in
[1:18:41] supplications and prayers day at night
[1:18:42] and day but she that liveth in pleasure
[1:18:45] is what dead while she liveth
[1:18:49] to see that's why zombies are so popular
[1:18:52] because that's what's happening now we
[1:18:54] got a lot of spiritual zombies they're
[1:18:56] dead but they say they're alive they're
[1:18:59] living in the flesh but they don't have
[1:19:01] the life of Jesus Christ well how do you
[1:19:03] know you got the life of Jesus Christ
[1:19:04] you live by every word in the Bible amen
[1:19:08] hallelujah the Holy Spirit's living in
[1:19:11] your life you obey the word you speak
[1:19:13] the word God has pot God has given you
[1:19:16] power in your life to overcome the
[1:19:18] wicked one amen hallelujah a church and
[1:19:24] that beautiful memory see that now
[1:19:25] either take his mark or his name and
[1:19:28] that beast has many names names of
[1:19:32] blasphemy the Pope has one name the
[1:19:35] Vicar of Christ that's the name of the
[1:19:36] Antichrist so they either say okay I'll
[1:19:40] obey the Catholic teaching room I'll be
[1:19:42] the Lutheran teacher as long as I can
[1:19:44] buy and sell as long as long as I can
[1:19:46] buy or sell yep I will I'll be a good
[1:19:47] Baptist I'll be a good Methodist and
[1:19:50] don't even know they're taking the mark
[1:19:52] of the beast see Satan has all these
[1:19:56] options people could take can do the
[1:19:58] works of the church take the doctrines
[1:20:00] of the church unashamed of their
[1:20:03] doctrine take the name of the Pope they
[1:20:05] can bow to the Pope's name you can bow
[1:20:07] to a church name and the Bible said
[1:20:09] they'll be dead claiming that they're
[1:20:11] alive does everybody understand my mercy
[1:20:18] so these are what these are unconverted
[1:20:21] sin loving church members but we got to
[1:20:24] be converted holiness loving church
[1:20:27] members
[1:20:28] amen holiness loving we have to hate sin
[1:20:32] but love the holiness of God amen
[1:20:37] thank the Lord because the Bible said if
[1:20:40] any man is in Christ he's a new creature
[1:20:43] amen how many know the the joy of a new
[1:20:45] life amen
[1:20:47] all things are passed away behold all
[1:20:50] things are become new amen hi they're
[1:20:53] coming to church is new because now you
[1:20:55] got a new heart you're a new creature
[1:20:57] amen when I was a teenager I dreaded
[1:21:00] coming to church but lift up my
[1:21:03] blanket and squirt me with vinegar to
[1:21:05] get me up to go to church she take a
[1:21:07] little plastic bat and hit me until I
[1:21:09] got to go to church but now I get up at
[1:21:11] 5:00 a.m. to go to church because I'm a
[1:21:13] new creature and my mom and my wife done
[1:21:16] that to squirt squirt me in the face he
[1:21:18] got me to go to church why cuz I love
[1:21:19] coming to church what cuz jesus is my
[1:21:22] Lord amen so a new creature oh you
[1:21:27] passed away the custom the dirty movies
[1:21:29] the sports
[1:21:30] that's all passed away praise God I'm a
[1:21:32] new creature in Christ but see that'll
[1:21:37] be the one way to tart to take the the
[1:21:39] mark of the beast now the last one is
[1:21:43] what I already showed you in fact yeah I
[1:21:44] already hit two while I was there sorry
[1:21:46] but back to Revelation 13 they can take
[1:21:50] them the mark of the number of his name
[1:21:53] now that yeah his name that was the name
[1:21:55] of the Pope okay can take the number of
[1:21:58] his name or I'm sorry you take his name
[1:22:01] or the number of his name
[1:22:03] so revelation 13 17 and that and that no
[1:22:09] man might buy or sell save he that had
[1:22:11] the mark or the name of the beast or the
[1:22:13] number of his name and that was that 666
[1:22:19] so people can either take the Pope's
[1:22:21] name or your godly Oh Holy Father right
[1:22:24] brought Barack Obama says that Trump
[1:22:26] says they all said a holy father that's
[1:22:28] a lie he's not a holy father he's an
[1:22:31] unholy father as what he is because of
[1:22:33] his doctrine his false doctrine so you
[1:22:37] can either take that name of the Pope
[1:22:39] the Holy Father or a name of a church oh
[1:22:41] blessed Baptist and blessed Church of
[1:22:43] the Brethren or you can take the works
[1:22:46] of the hand or you can take the
[1:22:49] unashamed lies of their doctrine up here
[1:22:51] I'll just I'll just believe everything
[1:22:53] they say just so I can buy or sell I'll
[1:22:55] do whatever they say that's fine
[1:22:56] I'm unashamed of it because I need to
[1:22:58] buy or sell and that's the same thing
[1:23:01] Esau did right Church he sold out his
[1:23:04] birthright for food see so in an East
[1:23:08] halls day he took the mark of the beast
[1:23:10] but Jacob took the mark of God amen he
[1:23:13] wrestled with God until he got a new
[1:23:15] Rock amen
[1:23:16] so we need to rest them with God and
[1:23:19] three change the walk and help the walk
[1:23:21] holding holiness into the Lord
[1:23:22] haha thank the Lord now the image so go
[1:23:31] to Revelation 13 14 revelation 13 14 I'm
[1:23:46] gonna look something up again here just
[1:23:48] give me a moment okay Lydia switch well
[1:24:01] yeah let's read this then we'll switch
[1:24:02] over here just a moment but let's read
[1:24:04] this first alright
[1:24:11] revelation 13 thanks for your patience
[1:24:13] I'm there now 13 14 and deceiveth them
[1:24:17] that dwell on the earth by the means of
[1:24:20] those miracles which he had power to do
[1:24:22] in the sight of the Beast saying to them
[1:24:23] that dwell the earth that they should
[1:24:24] make an image of the Beast which had the
[1:24:27] wound by the sword and did live now look
[1:24:31] at verse 15 and he had power to give
[1:24:33] life under the image of the Beast that
[1:24:35] an image of the Beast should both speak
[1:24:37] and cause that as many as would not
[1:24:39] worship the image of the Beast to be
[1:24:42] killed
[1:24:43] okay now switch over here Lydia what is
[1:24:47] the image of the Beast the image of the
[1:24:49] Beast is a visible unity of false
[1:24:52] Christian churches and the name of it is
[1:24:55] the World Council of Churches now this
[1:24:59] is no joke this is their website now
[1:25:01] look we just read that they said let's
[1:25:03] make an image to the church and they
[1:25:06] said this is a community of churches on
[1:25:08] the way to visible unity in the one
[1:25:13] faith one Eucharistic the other uniting
[1:25:16] with the Catholics fellowship and right
[1:25:21] now Church they represent over 500
[1:25:24] million is that on this page yes
[1:25:26] they represent Oh
[1:25:28] over half a billion Christians and at
[1:25:33] the right time the Bible said the Beast
[1:25:35] will give power to make this image speak
[1:25:38] and live and then if you speak against
[1:25:40] this image you die so this is the one
[1:25:44] world church it's going to be the World
[1:25:47] Council of Churches because they all
[1:25:49] want to be a part of this unity to unify
[1:25:53] with the Eucharist of the Catholic
[1:25:56] Church and what is the eucharist
[1:25:58] eucharist is the bread that they say
[1:26:01] turns in the literal body of christ and
[1:26:03] the wine that literally turns to the
[1:26:06] blood of Christ that's a lie that's not
[1:26:09] the literal blood that's not the literal
[1:26:11] body it's a symbol of it the literal
[1:26:14] life of Christ is the baptism of the
[1:26:16] Holy Ghost hey hey I praise God that's
[1:26:20] what we had got amen hallelujah
[1:26:22] but see this is the image see they can
[1:26:26] take the image of the beast as well they
[1:26:29] worship and bow down and say okay I'm
[1:26:31] part of this church where all the other
[1:26:32] churches are joining it for peace and
[1:26:34] safety I might as well join it for peace
[1:26:36] and safety
[1:26:37] listen you hurt you heard it here if you
[1:26:39] have order yet you heard her you heard
[1:26:41] it here first do not be a part of the
[1:26:43] World Council of Churches hey man
[1:26:45] because it's a compromise it's not the
[1:26:48] unity that God wants us to have praise
[1:26:53] God the unity that we have with Christ
[1:26:59] is the unity of obedience through the
[1:27:01] word this is a false unity they unify
[1:27:05] unify around the facts well we believe
[1:27:07] in having communion but it doesn't
[1:27:09] matter what what you what it means oh it
[1:27:11] does matter it does matter it does
[1:27:14] matter because one little sin one little
[1:27:17] piece of leaven leavens the whole lump
[1:27:18] if they get you to compromise on one
[1:27:20] little thing about communion they'll
[1:27:22] make you swallow the rest of their false
[1:27:23] doctrine pretty soon you be worshipping
[1:27:25] Mary and praying to dead Saints and all
[1:27:27] these things like that and giving Mary
[1:27:29] more honor than Christ
[1:27:30] right I'm pretty soon there'll be sexual
[1:27:33] sins like all this sexual sin in the
[1:27:35] Catholic Church pretty soon that will
[1:27:36] sweep into that church in the family and
[1:27:38] all that if you just if you compromise
[1:27:40] oh one little thing
[1:27:41] but the Bride of Christ will not
[1:27:42] compromise on anything she's washed by
[1:27:45] the water of the word amen
[1:27:47] she's got pure garments on she's washed
[1:27:50] right she's a real Christian no real
[1:27:51] believer Amen hallelujah now I want to
[1:28:01] read a scripture here let's go to 2nd
[1:28:03] John 1 now Lydia we can switch off again
[1:28:04] there 2nd John 1 verse 9 2nd John 1:9 11
[1:28:10] we'll put up here thank you honey
[1:28:11] well I'm really putting your work
[1:28:12] tonight and you're even finding
[1:28:13] scriptures for me bless your heart honey
[1:28:15] 2nd John 1:9 so see if someone says oh
[1:28:24] we just want to be one
[1:28:26] you know Jesus prayed that we should be
[1:28:28] one with every church he didn't mean
[1:28:29] that kind of oneness
[1:28:30] he didn't mean compromise in oneness
[1:28:32] that's a false oneness those are called
[1:28:36] doctrines of devils and seducing spirits
[1:28:38] oh we're all children of God well yeah
[1:28:41] we're all created by God but we're not
[1:28:43] all children of God until we're born
[1:28:44] again of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:47] now look look at John says about unity
[1:28:51] so Christian unity oh that's all let's
[1:28:54] all have a supper together oh just come
[1:28:56] over to my house we're all Christians
[1:28:58] are we whosoever transgresseth and
[1:29:02] abideth not in the doctrine of Christ so
[1:29:03] doctrine is instruction or teaching
[1:29:06] something does it live or abide in the
[1:29:09] instruction of Christ they do not have
[1:29:12] God they're not born again but he that
[1:29:16] abides in the doctrine of Christ he hath
[1:29:19] both the father and son ha ha ha
[1:29:22] see how doctrine is so closely
[1:29:24] associated with the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:26] Ghost if you've got the back if you've
[1:29:28] got the person of Christ you'll have the
[1:29:30] person's doctored amen
[1:29:32] oh yeah you can't have one without the
[1:29:35] other
[1:29:35] this scripture proves it if you are born
[1:29:38] again and you got the Holy Ghost as the
[1:29:40] seal of God the baptism only goes your
[1:29:43] doctrine will be right hey Laurie
[1:29:47] in other words if you've got the person
[1:29:49] of Christ you'll have that person's
[1:29:50] doctrine you'll believe exactly like
[1:29:53] Jesus Bible tells you to believe
[1:29:55] oh he had both the father the invisible
[1:29:59] spirit and the son the quick earner of
[1:30:01] the word well thank the Lord and the
[1:30:06] next verse now let's let's see one of
[1:30:12] your friends once you have a dinner all
[1:30:14] let's just talk about it you know you
[1:30:16] believe the communions just the symbol
[1:30:18] let's just talk about let's just have
[1:30:19] dinner about it look at the Bible says
[1:30:21] if there come any unto you and bring not
[1:30:25] this doctrine receive him not into your
[1:30:28] house neither bid him Godspeed don't
[1:30:32] bless him so if you know somebody's
[1:30:34] purposely perpetrating false doctrine
[1:30:37] you don't even say God bless you
[1:30:38] Oh God blesses your efforts you don't
[1:30:41] even say that that's something we all
[1:30:43] need help on I need help on that because
[1:30:45] I just I want to so I want to see so
[1:30:47] many people saved
[1:30:48] you know the Bible said bless those who
[1:30:49] persecute you do good to those who
[1:30:52] despise you pray for them who
[1:30:53] despitefully use you so I've got to be
[1:30:55] more careful on this I do I have to make
[1:30:58] sure that I only bless those who I know
[1:31:00] are doing it with the pure heart but if
[1:31:03] the Bible says if you know they're
[1:31:05] purposely transgressing the doctrine of
[1:31:07] Christ don't let them come in your house
[1:31:09] and don't even give him Godspeed next
[1:31:13] verse verse for he that biddeth him God
[1:31:16] speed is a partaker of his evil deeds
[1:31:20] that serious is it not church
[1:31:23] remember all those who take any of these
[1:31:26] forms of the mark where they all going
[1:31:28] to go to the lake of fire very serious
[1:31:32] thing see so this is the unity the unity
[1:31:36] is the true doctrine of Christ that's
[1:31:41] what we all must have now let's go back
[1:31:45] to revelation 19:20 where we started and
[1:31:47] now if we read that again we'll have a
[1:31:49] lot better understanding won't we
[1:31:51] was this helpful tonight Church was that
[1:31:53] good to go over all that see it was for
[1:31:56] me but man when I was studying because I
[1:31:57] didn't realize the mark can come in so
[1:31:59] many different forms everybody just
[1:32:02] thinks oh it's either the right hand or
[1:32:03] the forward but it actually you can take
[1:32:05] the name of the Beast right or just the
[1:32:07] Beast right itself
[1:32:09] I mean there's there's different ways
[1:32:11] you can take it because Satan is so sly
[1:32:13] he's so deceptive Satan knows that God's
[1:32:16] people are gonna read the Bible and
[1:32:18] they're gonna say don't take in the
[1:32:19] right hand and the he knows that so he's
[1:32:22] got to have more ways to deceive so back
[1:32:29] to our opening scripture and I'll go if
[1:32:31] you let me go a few more minutes here
[1:32:32] let me said time here and the Beast was
[1:32:35] taken it with him the false prophet so
[1:32:37] the Beast is that spirit of Rome brother
[1:32:39] Bram tells us the false prophet is the
[1:32:41] Pope and that wrought the miracles
[1:32:43] before him with which he deceived them
[1:32:45] that received the mark of the beast okay
[1:32:48] we know what the mark is now right hand
[1:32:50] for it and then that worshipped His
[1:32:52] image the images that world counsel
[1:32:54] churches it's a visible form of false
[1:32:57] unity that's the image and it speaks in
[1:33:00] other words the image is the false
[1:33:01] church system it's all the Protestants
[1:33:05] right it's all this basically the
[1:33:08] dissipation of the power Protestant
[1:33:09] churches when the Protestants unite
[1:33:12] that's the image unto the Beast these
[1:33:17] both were cast alive into a lake of fire
[1:33:20] burning with brimstone that's very
[1:33:24] serious Maya now let me find a place to
[1:33:29] close here by God's grace
[1:33:38] and with the can I end with the
[1:33:40] Antichrist let me end with the
[1:33:41] Antichrist here if that's okay
[1:33:44] let's go I guess the main scripture
[1:33:47] right now second Thessalonians 2 verse 3
[1:33:49] so liddy can you pull it up here this is
[1:33:51] the main one now as I'm writing this
[1:33:53] book my next book though you'll also
[1:33:56] find the Antichrist in Daniel 8 Daniel 9
[1:33:59] and Daniel 11 so as I've studied by the
[1:34:03] William it seems like those are the
[1:34:04] portions that have the most information
[1:34:06] on the person of the Antichrist yeah it
[1:34:10] looks like revelation I'm sorry 2nd 2nd
[1:34:13] Thessalonians and then a little bit of
[1:34:15] Revelation and then a lot in Daniel so
[1:34:18] 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 3 to
[1:34:22] 13 now let me give you an example the
[1:34:27] Bible calls the Pope were the false
[1:34:32] prophet right remember that we read that
[1:34:33] the false prophet what does the Pope
[1:34:36] prophesy or what did the prophet what
[1:34:38] did the Pope speak in the name of the
[1:34:40] Lord well here is something from 1915
[1:34:42] brother Brandon mentioned this in 1950
[1:34:44] Pope Pius the 12th announced that Mary
[1:34:49] the mother of Jesus was taken or assumed
[1:34:52] into heaven bodies and soul following
[1:34:55] the end of her life on earth there's
[1:34:59] absolutely no historical or New
[1:35:02] Testament proof of this and this is
[1:35:05] called the Assumption of Mary how many
[1:35:06] ever heard of that anyone ever heard
[1:35:08] that look it up it was it's a new dogma
[1:35:12] well fairly new now it's what almost 70
[1:35:14] years old but for history that's pretty
[1:35:17] fair that's fairly recent for history
[1:35:18] concerning the Catholic churches all
[1:35:20] over almost 2,000 old so in 1950 Pope
[1:35:25] Pius the 12th said I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:35:27] prophesy I'm gonna make a word in the
[1:35:29] name of the Lord right he made a new
[1:35:32] Dogma we believe Mary was taken up after
[1:35:35] death and her body and soul were
[1:35:38] completely preserved and she was taken
[1:35:39] straight to heaven now there's not even
[1:35:41] one fact of that in the Bible but see
[1:35:44] she's making a false assumption she's
[1:35:46] making a false declaration in the name
[1:35:48] of the Lord in other words she's lying
[1:35:50] she's a false prophet
[1:35:52] or kinda the Pope was a false prophet
[1:35:56] see that's called the Assumption of Mary
[1:35:58] you can look it up it's well-known 1950
[1:36:02] see falsely saying things in the name of
[1:36:04] the Lord and it's a lie so the false
[1:36:10] prophet in the book of Revelation is
[1:36:12] another name for the person of the
[1:36:14] Antichrist that we just generally called
[1:36:17] the Antichrist now let's go to 2nd
[1:36:19] Thessalonians 2:3 2:13 he's got a lot of
[1:36:24] detail on this one
[1:36:25] and we'll close with this I set my timer
[1:36:27] will close to this here and then maybe
[1:36:29] Lord willing next Wednesday we'll pick
[1:36:31] up actually I'm sorry next Wednesday we
[1:36:32] got brother Diggs coming back he's free
[1:36:35] he's going through up here at Noir in
[1:36:36] northern Ohio preaching so why brother
[1:36:38] Diggs next Wednesday night if we have to
[1:36:40] tell you that so praise the Lord
[1:36:42] so we'll enjoy that hallelujah love
[1:36:44] those evangelist amen so maybe in to
[1:36:49] Wednesdays we'll pick up Daniel now
[1:36:54] remember Daniel 8 9 and 11 but for now
[1:36:56] let's close the second Thessalonians 2
[1:36:59] verse 3 now let me turn there so I can
[1:37:02] read it myself thank you for your
[1:37:05] patience okay two three let no man
[1:37:14] deceive you by any means now listen
[1:37:16] Church don't even let me deceive you I'm
[1:37:19] not I don't believe I'm a deceiver but
[1:37:20] let's say I was don't let don't be to
[1:37:22] see by me don't take everything I say
[1:37:25] make sure it goes back to the Word of
[1:37:26] God now a lot of things you know and if
[1:37:30] you not already know it's in the Bible
[1:37:31] and of course believe your pastor I've
[1:37:33] been here for 13 years you should trust
[1:37:35] me but what I'm saying is if I say
[1:37:37] something you don't know you better go
[1:37:39] look it up in the Word of God if I don't
[1:37:41] live the life of Christ let's say God
[1:37:42] will using me as a - of something then
[1:37:44] don't follow me after that but if I live
[1:37:47] a godly life the Bible says follow them
[1:37:50] who have ruled over you and follow their
[1:37:52] faith if I live a godly life of faith
[1:37:54] and follow my faith that's what the
[1:37:55] Bible says but if I say something that
[1:37:59] you've never heard before not sure about
[1:38:00] it don't take my word for it don't let
[1:38:02] any man deceive you go search the
[1:38:04] scripture
[1:38:07] for that day shall not come except there
[1:38:10] come a falling away first and that man
[1:38:12] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[1:38:14] I remember Judas was called the son of
[1:38:16] perdition
[1:38:17] so before before the endtime there's
[1:38:20] going to another Judas rise up right
[1:38:24] another son of perdition and Judas was
[1:38:28] full of Satan so this man of sin is
[1:38:31] going to be full of Satan just like
[1:38:32] Judas was yet he's going to be a false
[1:38:35] prophet with lying wonders and miracles
[1:38:40] now a falling away and I remember we
[1:38:43] lived to this a few weeks ago remember
[1:38:44] someone can genuinely come to God but
[1:38:48] that fall away from that experience just
[1:38:51] like Judas and just like Hebrews 10 said
[1:38:54] the Bible said he and Eber said that
[1:38:57] someone can be sanctified by the blood
[1:38:59] of Jesus Christ but then cast it down
[1:39:01] and tried it down and smash it out under
[1:39:04] their foot someone can genuinely wash my
[1:39:09] by the the Spirit of God but then leave
[1:39:12] that washing and go back into a dirty
[1:39:14] filthy life
[1:39:16] that's quite a that's quite a teaching
[1:39:18] that's true the only way someone can
[1:39:22] fall away from the truth is that they're
[1:39:24] in the truth right that's the only way
[1:39:28] they can fall away so this Antichrist is
[1:39:32] called the son of perdition and the man
[1:39:35] of sin look at verse 4 who opposes and
[1:39:39] exalts himself above all that is called
[1:39:41] God or that's worship so that he as God
[1:39:44] sits in the temple of God showing
[1:39:46] himself that He is God so the temple of
[1:39:50] God is the Jerusalem Temple right
[1:39:53] there's no Christian Church that says
[1:39:55] we're the temple of God the only Church
[1:39:57] in the Bible the only place in the Bible
[1:39:59] that calls itself the temple of God is
[1:40:00] the Jewish temple so the Pope is going
[1:40:03] to sit in the temple they're going to
[1:40:05] build a temple right in Isreal gonna
[1:40:07] rebuild that corner of revelation 11
[1:40:08] they're gonna rebuild it he's gonna sit
[1:40:10] in the temple of God showing himself
[1:40:12] that He is God because he's gonna make a
[1:40:14] covenant with the Jews and then he's
[1:40:16] going to exalt himself above all that is
[1:40:18] called God he's gonna
[1:40:19] held himself above the buck ball he's
[1:40:22] going to be worshipped as God because he
[1:40:24] has these lying signs and wonders he
[1:40:26] didn't deceive everyone on the earth but
[1:40:28] not us because we're already gone amen
[1:40:30] ha ha if the Lord tarries right if we've
[1:40:34] if the Lord comes our lifetime will be
[1:40:37] raptured up and we'll escape the
[1:40:39] Tribulation Period by God's grace the
[1:40:42] Bible says that verse 5 remember you not
[1:40:47] that when I was yet with you I told you
[1:40:48] these things and now you know what
[1:40:50] withholdeth that he might revealed in
[1:40:53] his time so god's withholding this
[1:40:55] because there's a certain time the
[1:40:57] Antichrist is going to be revealed verse
[1:40:59] 7 for the Ministry of iniquity does only
[1:41:04] he who now letteth will let until he be
[1:41:06] taken out of the way so God is letting
[1:41:09] everything go on until the Holy Spirit
[1:41:12] is is is taken away from the earth right
[1:41:16] that's what that means so the Antichrist
[1:41:19] will not be revealed until he the Holy
[1:41:21] Spirit is taken away from the earth at
[1:41:24] the rapture so see teachers what is
[1:41:28] Satan Satan is the mystery of iniquity
[1:41:30] it's so innocent right the Catholic
[1:41:35] Church look it's so aren't they're
[1:41:36] building so beautiful they're the most I
[1:41:39] just saw on a friend of mine posted on
[1:41:40] Facebook yesterday they went to Catholic
[1:41:42] Church and Barberton or something
[1:41:44] Cleveland it was so beautiful and Church
[1:41:46] it is beautiful but it's a cage of
[1:41:49] unclean and hateful bird zey men because
[1:41:52] of all their false doctrine all their
[1:41:53] sexual sin and all their sex abuse it's
[1:41:55] a cage of unclean and hateful bird it's
[1:41:59] true it's a mister of iniquity it starts
[1:42:03] off small but they know they know by the
[1:42:06] Bible that what they're doing is wrong
[1:42:08] they know it's wrong it's iniquity they
[1:42:10] shouldn't be doing the things they're
[1:42:12] doing
[1:42:13] verse 8 and then so once he's taking all
[1:42:17] the way once the Holy Ghost is the other
[1:42:18] way and then should that wicked be
[1:42:21] revealed so now the Antichrist is called
[1:42:23] that wicked whom the Lord shall consume
[1:42:26] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[1:42:29] destroy with the brightness of his
[1:42:31] coming amen
[1:42:33] glory verse 9 even him whose coming is
[1:42:40] after the working of Satan says he Satan
[1:42:42] fills the Antichrist himself it's Satan
[1:42:45] working a man the man of sin the son of
[1:42:47] perdition just like Judas with all
[1:42:52] powers and sides and look lying wonders
[1:42:54] they're gonna be light their merit
[1:42:56] they're gonna say see me all over CNN
[1:42:57] it's gonna be all over Fox News but it's
[1:42:59] gonna be lying miracles they're a lie
[1:43:02] they're not real they're lies in order
[1:43:04] to deceive verse 10 and with all
[1:43:09] deceivableness of unrighteousness see
[1:43:12] they're going to deceive them into
[1:43:14] living a sinful life what is
[1:43:17] righteousness righteous is doing what's
[1:43:19] right
[1:43:19] what is unrighteous is doing what's
[1:43:21] wrong but they're deceived into doing
[1:43:24] wrong in other words they love the sin
[1:43:26] and the churches are going to give them
[1:43:28] a license to sin it's okay to smoke
[1:43:30] cigarettes it's okay to do drugs it's
[1:43:33] okay to be addicted to pornography
[1:43:34] that's okay God understands you're a
[1:43:36] sinner
[1:43:36] well no God gives you something to clean
[1:43:38] yourself from those type of things
[1:43:39] amen God gives you what's called
[1:43:41] salvation deliverance amen but see they
[1:43:47] deceive people with their
[1:43:48] unrighteousness
[1:43:50] it's okay to live a sinful life it's
[1:43:53] okay to enjoy those sins it's all right
[1:43:57] that's right that's right amen brother
[1:44:00] Yeah right yeah that's right that's good
[1:44:03] they confess it in their confessional
[1:44:05] box rather than to Christ hey glory and
[1:44:09] when you confess it to somebody else
[1:44:10] that's no good the only way to get those
[1:44:13] sins blotted out is to confess it to
[1:44:15] Christ amen
[1:44:16] there it is he'll brought your sins off
[1:44:18] of that record in heaven amen
[1:44:27] see first 10 with all to see
[1:44:31] of unrighteous and then that perish
[1:44:32] because this and here's why they're
[1:44:34] gonna hell they love not the they do not
[1:44:37] have the love of the truth that they
[1:44:39] might be saved so how do you be saved
[1:44:41] you have to so love the truth that you
[1:44:44] love the truth more than you love sin
[1:44:46] right you have to love even if it even
[1:44:49] if it tears you to pieces what the Bible
[1:44:52] says you still got to say I love truth
[1:44:54] god help me to believe it help me to
[1:44:56] live it help me not to compromise I love
[1:44:59] the truth but see all these people that
[1:45:02] worship the Pope and worship all the
[1:45:04] false churches they really love sin more
[1:45:06] than they love Christ they love sin more
[1:45:10] than they love the world because the
[1:45:11] Bible said the there's more than lovers
[1:45:17] of God they're right
[1:45:20] verse 11 and for this cause God shall
[1:45:23] send them a strong delusion that they
[1:45:24] should believe a lie see God's gonna
[1:45:27] mention just say okay fine believe your
[1:45:28] lie I'll let you believe the lie that
[1:45:30] this is a good thing this mark of the
[1:45:32] beast in this one-world church God's
[1:45:34] gonna let them believe the lie because
[1:45:36] they won't they won't accept the truth
[1:45:38] of God verse 12 that they all might be
[1:45:42] damned who believed not the truth but
[1:45:45] had pleasure in unrighteousness let's
[1:45:47] stand to our feet see Church what's your
[1:45:49] pleasure in life I hope you can say
[1:45:50] tonight my pleasure is coming in the
[1:45:52] house of God my pleasure is hearing the
[1:45:55] word of God that's true but see these
[1:45:57] sinners they want to come to church but
[1:46:00] their real pleasures and sin like that
[1:46:03] Widow woman her real pleasures that have
[1:46:05] sexual pleasure rather than serving God
[1:46:09] and don't want to be a widow today can
[1:46:12] be a woman who just marries for pleasure
[1:46:14] rather than marries according to will of
[1:46:16] God a man that does the same anyone that
[1:46:19] loves the pleasures of the world more
[1:46:20] than God they're in danger of taking the
[1:46:22] mark of the beast
