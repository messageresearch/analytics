[4:10] at church amen
[4:13] amen you have your bibles let's turn to
[4:15] matthew
[4:17] uh saint matthew chapter six
[4:20] by the grace of god i'm gonna go ahead
[4:22] and come out of this jacket
[4:26] amen matthew chapter six
[4:34] hallelujah
[4:36] matthew chapter six let's start reading
[4:39] at um
[4:40] verse
[4:41] 30.
[4:43] matthew 6 and verse 30. the bible says
[4:47] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[4:50] the field
[4:52] which the day is
[4:54] and tomorrow is cast into the oven
[4:57] shall he not much more clothe you
[5:00] o ye of little faith
[5:02] therefore
[5:04] take no thought
[5:06] saying what shall we eat
[5:08] or what shall we drink
[5:11] or
[5:12] whether will wherewith
[5:15] shall we be clothed
[5:17] for after all these things do the
[5:20] gentiles seek
[5:22] for
[5:23] your heavenly father knoweth
[5:26] that ye have need of all these things
[5:30] but this is the solution
[5:32] but seek ye first the kingdom of god
[5:35] and his righteousness and all these
[5:38] things shall be added unto you
[5:41] there take therefore no fault for
[5:45] tomorrow
[5:46] for the moral shall take thought of the
[5:49] things of itself sufficient
[5:53] until the day
[5:54] is the evil thereof
[5:57] let's go to second peter
[5:59] chapter one
[6:05] second peter chapter one
[6:09] and verse five
[6:15] let's let's let's back up to verse four
[6:19] second peter one and four the bible says
[6:22] whereby are we given unto us exceeding
[6:25] and great and precious promises
[6:27] that by these he might be partakers of
[6:30] the divine nature having escaped the
[6:33] corruption
[6:35] is that is in this world through lust
[6:39] and besides this giving all diligence
[6:41] add to your faith virtue and to your
[6:43] virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[6:46] temperance and to temperance patience
[6:48] and to patience godliness into godliness
[6:51] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[6:53] kindness charity for if these things be
[6:56] in you and abound they make you that ye
[7:00] shall neither be
[7:01] barren nor unfruitful
[7:04] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[7:07] christ
[7:09] amen may lord bless reading of his word
[7:11] you can have your seats
[7:16] amen
[7:18] you know by by the grace of god i want
[7:20] to use for a subject
[7:22] spiritual alignment
[7:24] spiritual
[7:26] alignment amen
[7:28] you know one one thing i i love about
[7:30] god
[7:32] god is obligated to his word
[7:36] you know he can't alter it
[7:38] he can't change it
[7:40] he once he give it he can't take it back
[7:43] and he has to confirm it amen
[7:46] so god is you know he's held he's
[7:50] handcuffed to the word of god amen
[7:53] so if we could find ourselves aligned
[7:56] with that word we'll get the results of
[7:58] what god said amen
[8:00] you know but when we think about
[8:02] alignment what is an alignment
[8:04] alignment is
[8:06] to be uh
[8:08] running in the same direction
[8:10] of something that that that that's
[8:12] working for your good amen but if i can
[8:14] let me start with a vehicle
[8:17] you know most of us have cars out here
[8:20] and you know your wheels have to be
[8:22] aligned amen
[8:24] you know it doesn't matter you could be
[8:26] driving a uh uh
[8:28] uh one of my favorite cars you could be
[8:31] driving a 2021 ghost rolls-royce
[8:35] amen or you could be driving a 2021 uh
[8:39] maserati
[8:41] but if your tires are not aligned you
[8:44] will still have a rough ride amen
[8:47] the tires have to be balanced
[8:49] and aligned amen no matter how expensive
[8:52] the car is no matter how good the luxury
[8:55] text and wood grain and all that things
[8:58] inside of it if your wheels are not
[9:01] balanced and aligned you're in for a
[9:04] rough ride amen
[9:06] it doesn't matter how good the warranty
[9:08] is on the car it doesn't matter how
[9:11] expensive it is
[9:12] if the tires and the wheels
[9:15] the foundation of that vehicle is not
[9:18] aligned and balanced you're in for a
[9:20] rough ride amen
[9:22] so for us as christians it be habit does
[9:25] it behold us to be aligned and balanced
[9:29] with the word of god
[9:32] you say brother jesus how do i know if
[9:35] i'm unbalanced how do i know if my tires
[9:38] are not aligned just look at your life
[9:40] amen
[9:41] look at your life and and pay attention
[9:44] whether you're listening to god amen
[9:47] because god on a daily basis is trying
[9:49] to light us up amen with his word
[9:52] because whether you believe it or not
[9:54] god wants to bless you more than you can
[9:57] imagine
[9:59] because when you
[10:01] get blessed it turns us into testimony
[10:05] mode
[10:07] and we start to lift up his name we
[10:10] start to exalt the lord holy and out of
[10:13] all that god gives glory amen
[10:16] so he knows when he allows us to be
[10:19] lined up and balanced amen we get
[10:21] blessed and he gets glory out of our
[10:23] life
[10:28] but how do you know when your car is not
[10:30] aligned hey man it's very easy just turn
[10:34] the steering wheel loose and it'll go
[10:36] into a certain direction that's off
[10:39] hallelujah now you look at yourself
[10:41] spiritually amen are you going into a
[10:43] direction that's off hallelujah it's
[10:46] your daily life moving you to a
[10:48] direction that's off the things that you
[10:50] read isn't off the thing that you listen
[10:53] to is it all the things that you look at
[10:56] is it off and if you're going to a
[10:58] direction that's not leading you to god
[11:01] that means you need to be spiritually
[11:03] alive
[11:08] it's very simple hallelujah without god
[11:11] your life will go into a direction that
[11:14] doesn't edify him
[11:16] but if you are lying right everywhere
[11:19] you look you see god
[11:24] hallelujah
[11:26] see sometimes in alignment amen
[11:29] you can buy some brand new tires but if
[11:32] that car is not a line those tires will
[11:34] wear down faster
[11:37] and if you're not aligned with god you
[11:40] will mentally be wear down faster you
[11:43] will spiritually wear it down faster
[11:46] amen but if you hallelujah get aligned
[11:49] with god you will realize that we have
[11:52] an advocate
[11:56] what is an advocate a advocate is
[11:58] someone who can do what you can't do
[12:02] hunger and god is our advocate we
[12:05] couldn't save ourselves we couldn't
[12:07] redeem ourselves we don't even know the
[12:09] direction we should go but because he's
[12:12] an advocate he leads us in the paths of
[12:15] righteousness
[12:21] oh my church
[12:22] let's get spiritually aligned
[12:24] because once you align yourself with the
[12:27] word of god then you have god hardly on
[12:30] your side
[12:34] think about it he said don't take no
[12:36] thought of your clothes don't take no
[12:38] thought of your eating or your drinking
[12:40] but
[12:41] seek ye first the kingdom
[12:43] and if you seek the kingdom now the
[12:45] bible says all these things
[12:52] church church i'm not boasting i'm not
[12:54] bragging but i've given my life
[12:56] hallelujah to to serve the lord so i
[13:00] ride to the neighborhood hallelujah of
[13:02] the house i want to build holly the
[13:04] place i want to stay and i'm looking for
[13:06] god to do something why because i'm
[13:08] already alive
[13:12] i'm already hallelujah lined up
[13:15] doing what god wants me to do so i'm
[13:17] looking for him to fulfill his word
[13:20] he said seek me first and all these
[13:23] other things to be added to you
[13:27] so i'm looking for god to bring
[13:28] something to my life
[13:35] the bankers say do you got the down
[13:36] payment no but god does
[13:41] [Applause]
[13:43] how many bedrooms at least four do you
[13:45] have enough furniture for foe no but god
[13:48] does
[13:54] let me give you an example
[13:56] let me give you an example
[13:58] sometimes we stop the lord from moving
[14:00] by what we speak out of our mouth
[14:04] spoken word is the original seed
[14:06] you know the greatest battle of a fault
[14:08] where in the mind
[14:10] but most of those battles are lost and
[14:12] worn by your mouth
[14:18] every battle is either won or lost by
[14:21] the way you speak about what's going on
[14:24] in your mind
[14:26] hallelujah so you know church what i
[14:28] would i like to do i like to a man speak
[14:32] positive things over myself
[14:34] but you know i i i have a real a friend
[14:38] who's a real estate broker and she went
[14:40] and bought this nice big massive house
[14:42] harley she comes she comes out of a
[14:45] prosperity church
[14:46] but you know it's it's that's why i
[14:48] commend what brother jesse is doing when
[14:51] we met she was going to a prosperity
[14:53] church but sweet person you can tell
[14:55] that she's really her and her husband
[14:57] they're really living to their
[14:59] conviction right here they may not
[15:02] understand the whole ins and outs about
[15:04] prosperity but what they believe they
[15:07] give their whole heart to it amen and
[15:09] you know we've become friends over the
[15:11] years real good friends me and her
[15:13] husband and her real good friends and
[15:16] when they bought this new house
[15:17] hallelujah one day i she they were
[15:20] showing me the house and she said kadri
[15:23] come on over i want you to see the new
[15:24] house and we were in there walking
[15:26] around church
[15:28] her basement this building can fit in
[15:30] her basement
[15:35] why because they believe god
[15:37] and you know church i was looking around
[15:39] leaving and i said i was leaving the
[15:41] house and i was like man this is nice
[15:43] this is a nice house i said but i don't
[15:46] need something this big she said who
[15:47] told you that that's right that's right
[15:51] she said who told you that she said
[15:53] we're supposed to be children of god and
[15:56] before god can give give us what he
[15:58] wants to give us we're already stopping
[16:00] him from doing it
[16:03] hallelujah if god wants to bless you
[16:05] honey according to how he wants to bless
[16:08] you who are you to tell him not to do it
[16:15] church the scripture says he can do
[16:18] exceedingly abundantly above
[16:21] all that you can ask or sing
[16:24] now i'm sitting there looking at this
[16:26] house and i'm thinking this is too big
[16:28] but the scripture says he's exceedingly
[16:31] [Music]
[16:33] he's
[16:34] exceedingly think about a blessing right
[16:37] now i want you to think about something
[16:39] you want god to do amen you got it are
[16:42] you thinking about it now i want you to
[16:44] know that he will do exceedingly
[16:57] no
[16:58] i don't need a 6 000 square feet house
[17:01] but if god give it to me i'm going to
[17:03] praise him all day long
[17:08] no
[17:09] i don't need a maserati but he give me
[17:11] one i'll drive it up here and preach in
[17:13] it
[17:18] because that's what it means to be
[17:20] spiritually aligned when you get
[17:22] spiritually aligned all the things that
[17:25] god promised you become yours
[17:27] [Music]
[17:28] but you have to line up with the word of
[17:30] god hallelujah
[17:32] not only just thinking of lining it up
[17:34] with the word of god but lining up with
[17:37] the purpose of his calling
[17:42] there's too many people in church not
[17:45] living by purpose
[17:47] but they're here just to relieve their
[17:49] conscience
[17:50] well they're here just to oh it's sunday
[17:53] i'm supposed to be here no god has a
[17:56] purpose for you
[18:06] you say brother dave
[18:08] i'm gonna show you how special you are
[18:11] if god
[18:13] had a purpose for judas and he was to be
[18:16] he was to be given over unto the devil
[18:18] why wouldn't he have a purpose for you
[18:23] if he's gonna let the devil walk with
[18:25] the church do all the supernatural
[18:27] things in the church hallelujah get so
[18:30] close to jesus he can betray him with a
[18:33] kiss you think he got a purpose for you
[18:36] hallelujah
[18:38] but are you spiritual you're lying see
[18:40] what we have to realize that god has
[18:42] laws hallelujah he has spiritual laws
[18:46] amen that he can't take away hallelujah
[18:49] he has natural laws that are still
[18:51] operating from the day of
[18:54] creation hallelujah
[18:57] just the natural laws are still
[18:59] operating the way god told them to
[19:01] operate hungary church by show up amen
[19:05] can a bird still fly
[19:08] i said by a short amends can a bird
[19:11] still fly
[19:13] you see that don't you
[19:14] don't you see that bird flying why is he
[19:17] flying because he's aligned
[19:20] with the law of god
[19:24] nothing can stop that
[19:26] that's what he was created for he was
[19:29] created to fly
[19:31] holy it doesn't matter how high the
[19:33] mountain is it doesn't matter how high
[19:36] the tree is there's a law in him that
[19:38] when he jumps off of it
[19:44] something
[19:46] kicks in by revelation and says fly
[19:54] he doesn't doubt it
[19:56] he doesn't reason with it it doesn't
[19:58] matter whether it's raining
[20:00] snowing
[20:01] a hurricane a tornado it doesn't change
[20:05] that love
[20:10] your child and tribulation doesn't
[20:12] change the law of god working inside of
[20:15] you
[20:23] you ever seen a bird
[20:25] jump off the cliff
[20:27] with his wings closed
[20:31] no those wings have a purpose so when
[20:34] they jump off
[20:35] they're already in motion
[20:38] it's
[20:39] it's like first nature
[20:42] they know that they've been given
[20:44] something
[20:45] for this particular purpose holly
[20:48] so when it jumps off it doesn't jump off
[20:51] in fear it jumps off knowing that
[20:54] it has an element of faith already built
[20:57] inside of it
[20:58] [Music]
[21:02] there's an element inside of it that
[21:05] just operates in the law of god
[21:07] harley and you know what you can do you
[21:10] can take that bird
[21:11] and put it in a zoo put it in the cage
[21:14] that doesn't change the law
[21:17] [Applause]
[21:21] why do you think when they capture
[21:22] eagles and different birds they put a
[21:25] chain on his ankle hollering because
[21:26] they know as soon as they open that cage
[21:30] let's go
[21:33] go
[21:34] why because it's not created to live
[21:38] down here on the ground it's creating to
[21:41] be in the heavens
[21:42] and the first opportunity it gets to
[21:45] show the world the law inside of it it's
[21:48] going to fly
[21:58] nothing can stop it
[22:01] he can be caged up for five years
[22:04] but it's just like riding the bike
[22:07] and sometimes it can be so caged up that
[22:09] it gets depressed
[22:11] remember the prophet talked about that
[22:12] bird right how long that had it was it
[22:15] was tied up so long
[22:17] that even when it got free
[22:19] he still thought it was tied up
[22:21] but you know what the man had to do
[22:23] he had to shoot it
[22:25] he had to run it hardly he had to push
[22:27] it into the law that it was already
[22:30] given earlier and sometimes god has to
[22:33] push us into the law that's already in
[22:36] us
[22:42] look brother branham didn't know he had
[22:44] spoken word authority
[22:46] god put him in positions where he had no
[22:49] choice but to speak
[22:54] hallelujah god put him on a mountain
[22:57] with a blizzard coming hallelujah and
[22:59] then god said hey can i walk with you
[23:03] and then the lord stopped walking with
[23:04] him in the midst of the blizzard and the

[31:35] know what i'll say to him show it to me
[31:40] [Applause]
[31:45] today my subtitle is i seen them do it
[31:51] [Applause]
[31:54] church i seen god do it
[31:58] a friend of mine was driving down the
[32:00] road and the police stopped him because
[32:02] he had a souped-up looking car and he
[32:04] had on the back of it no slow 84. so if

[32:18] the man said oh i wish i had another
[32:20] police officer here he says but you
[32:22] don't so show it to me
[32:28] what was he doing he was operating in
[32:30] the law
[32:34] amen
[32:35] i'm not talking about all these
[32:37] different movements we got i'm talking
[32:39] about right is right and rogue is wrong
[32:42] there's a truth and there's a lie
[32:47] but listen look
[32:49] right here in exodus
[32:50] the bible says
[32:53] he says and i appeared
[32:55] he's verse two let's go back he says and
[32:57] god speaking to moses and saying unto
[33:00] him i am the lord and i appeared unto
[33:02] abraham unto isaac holy
[33:05] and unto jacob
[33:07] by the name of god almighty but by my
[33:10] name jehovah was i not known see so
[33:14] church what i'm saying to you today is
[33:16] that we should look for increases of god
[33:19] in our life
[33:22] because right here he's going to do
[33:23] something with moses that he didn't do
[33:25] with abraham they didn't do what isaac
[33:28] that he didn't do with jacob hallelujah
[33:30] what he's going to do now he's going to
[33:32] conduct himself hallelujah as a father
[33:40] amen because jehovah means one who
[33:43] exists with his family
[33:46] and now he's gonna show moses hallelujah
[33:49] that i'm the father over this whole
[33:50] nation and i got everything under
[33:52] control hallelujah he said gather the
[33:55] people and y'all go and they were being
[33:57] led they would go out they made pharaoh
[34:00] chasing them then they got to the red
[34:01] sea but you know what he's still jehovah
[34:07] think about it church
[34:09] what does a father do amen amen we call
[34:12] him jehovah jairo he provides
[34:16] steve well he's showing moses right here
[34:18] every attribute of jehovah i'm feared to
[34:21] express in y'all right amen hallelujah
[34:24] as a provider he gave them food when
[34:26] there was no food
[34:28] as a provider he gave them healing when
[34:30] there was no need for healing right
[34:32] oh
[34:33] church the prophet of god say they
[34:35] traveled for 40 years in the desert
[34:37] without a red cross
[34:39] nobody ever got sick why because he
[34:42] acknowledged himself as jehovah
[34:47] he who exists with his family
[34:54] they couldn't be beat they couldn't be
[34:55] overcome why because he was a banner he
[34:58] was jehovah neeson he was
[35:01] wrong
[35:01] [Applause]
[35:06] hallelujah
[35:07] and you know when they when they got
[35:08] there to that to that red sea
[35:11] amen and it looked like oh moses brought
[35:13] us out here what we gonna do now see he
[35:16] was jehovah right hallelujah
[35:19] he was there existing with his family
[35:21] amen and now he had to do something amen
[35:25] why he had to come to the people to the
[35:27] rescue why because he was jehovah shalom
[35:31] he had to give the people peace
[35:34] because he introduced himself as jehovah
[35:36] so it wasn't their job to figure out how
[35:39] they gonna get through it was god's job
[35:45] think about it harley j if i can use
[35:48] jesse his kids are not worried about how
[35:50] they're going to eat
[35:51] that's his problem
[35:55] why because he's the jehovah of his
[35:58] house
[35:59] hallelujah he's the one existing with
[36:01] his family
[36:02] the kids are not worried about their
[36:03] protection that's his problem
[36:07] hallelujah they're not worried about a
[36:09] roof over their head that's his problem
[36:11] why because god exists with his family
[36:14] amen amen and that's who he was but i
[36:18] want you to understand god will lead you
[36:20] to a certain way
[36:22] just so his attributes can be manifest
[36:29] and even right now god's trying to get
[36:31] things out of us hallelujah that we're
[36:33] not willing to give him that's right
[36:36] right
[36:38] you know what he did he brought them to
[36:39] the red sea because he was trying to get
[36:41] something out of him
[36:44] brought him to the red sea amen and
[36:46] moses moses went back there and he
[36:48] started crying
[36:49] he started oh god what should i do oh
[36:52] god what should i do now mind you before
[36:55] that point moses created frogs
[36:59] moses created lies
[37:01] moses called down fire hallelujah
[37:04] moses was doing all these things that
[37:06] god did supernaturally but now how
[37:09] easily we forget
[37:12] moses should have stepped back and told
[37:14] the children of israel don't worry about
[37:16] this i've seen him do it already
[37:22] but you know what he does he leads them
[37:24] to the red sea just to try to get
[37:26] something out of him that they didn't
[37:27] know they had in him
[37:29] so he tells moses he said stop crying
[37:31] speak to it and move forward
[37:35] moses he didn't say anything to the sea
[37:39] the sea was not the problem
[37:46] what was the problem the enemy chasing
[37:49] him hallelujah so moses tell the
[37:51] egyptians he tells them he tells the
[37:53] israelites stay still see the salvation
[37:56] of the lord for the egyptians whom
[37:58] you've seen you shall see them no more
[38:01] forever
[38:02] and when he said that creation heard god
[38:06] speaking and the sea started rumbling
[38:09] the sea started quaking the sea started
[38:12] shaking
[38:18] they had to get in line with what they
[38:21] had to line up hallelujah the sea had to
[38:24] line up with what moses had spoke
[38:32] in the sea lined up hallelujah the sea
[38:35] got enlightenment hallelujah with the
[38:37] destroying power hallelujah to take care
[38:40] of the egyptians
[38:41] notice he didn't say see he didn't say
[38:43] see i want you to get out of the way he
[38:45] said no the egyptians who you see you
[38:48] should see them no more forever
[38:50] and the only way to destroy them in that
[38:52] moment was that all of them drown
[38:58] so to see
[38:59] heard the law of god speaking
[39:03] and the sea began to react
[39:05] to the voice of god
[39:07] and the sea started rumbling and the sea
[39:10] started shaking and the next thing you
[39:12] know the walls of the seat lifted up
[39:19] boom
[39:20] when you get in your position when you
[39:22] get in your place hallelujah the walls
[39:25] of your troubles will lift up
[39:29] and you can walk right through it
[39:35] church
[39:36] you say brothers how can you ask god to
[39:39] do something like that
[39:40] you know or for a house and you ride in
[39:42] the neighborhood and all this stuff
[39:44] because i seen them do it right
[39:48] some friends of mine
[39:50] they moved to carolina
[39:52] and they were renting a house
[39:55] because the lord was dealing with the
[39:56] father to move
[39:58] early
[39:59] so he obeyed god didn't know where he
[40:01] was moving he moved in a place
[40:03] but the place was really a little too
[40:04] small
[40:06] and his wife started praying
[40:08] she said lord i need something bigger
[40:11] and i want somewhere with it with a lot
[40:12] of space
[40:14] we need to be specific with god that's
[40:16] right that's right cause you're gonna
[40:17] get what you asked for
[40:20] four bedroom three thousand square feet
[40:22] two car garage

[41:19] somebody squatting on your land that
[41:22] means they got to get up

[41:33] but god told them go take the land that
[41:35] i've given you

[48:02] very exclusive group of people i think
[48:05] it was no more than four people that
[48:07] made it to this level hallelujah and
[48:09] they said out of this four you go to the
[48:11] next level so she was taking his test
[48:13] she looked at the test and she was like
[48:15] and i'm paraphrasing some of the
[48:16] testimony to get to the meet she said
[48:18] she was looking at the test and she was
[48:20] like i don't know none of this stuff
[48:22] she said but i know you god yeah
[48:27] how many ever did this in school
[48:31] i don't know what this is

[48:36] c b d a
[48:37] a b c d
[48:39] c b d e
[48:41] she's ridiculous ain't it
[48:44] but when you got god on your side
[48:46] he can make the impossible possible yeah
[48:49] she looked at that test
[48:52] and you know what she did
[48:53] she just took the answer sheet
[48:56] she didn't even look at the questions
[48:59] and she prayed she said lord i need you
[49:01] to guide my hand
[49:06] she wasn't even looking at the questions
[49:08] she said well okay i believe this one is
[49:11] a

[49:13] just going by the leadership of god what
[49:16] was she doing she was lining up with
[49:18] faith hallelujah church and she took the
[49:21] whole test like that not looking at any
[49:24] question right
[49:26] not solving any problem
[49:28] she put the whole test in god's hands
[49:31] so when it came back
[49:33] they called her and they told her okay
[49:35] you're going to the next level
[49:38] but then when she got to meeting with
[49:39] the people they told her they said
[49:41] you're the only one that made it to the
[49:43] next level
[49:44] she they said the reason why you're here
[49:46] because your test scores were higher
[49:49] than anybody we ever tested
[49:53] [Applause]
[49:58] worried about a job i've seen him do it
[50:01] i've seen him give jobs

[50:31] lose this job but you know what started
[50:33] to happen in hallelujah she didn't work
[50:35] one day on the job and every day she got
[50:38] a check

[51:00] i said wouldn't do it
[51:01] [Applause]
[51:06] hallelujah
[51:09] church all we have to do is line up with
[51:11] the law of god
[51:13] oh yeah
[51:14] there's a law in the fish
[51:16] hallelujah where you can swim down in
[51:19] the deeps of the ocean hallelujah and
[51:21] come back up again hallelujah there's
[51:23] something in it hallelujah that just
[51:26] allows it to happen that way nothing can
[51:28] stop it a bird can't do that but a fish
[51:30] can that's right
[51:32] it can dive up and go back down harder
[51:34] in this habitat and stay there for hours
[51:38] you know why because there's a law
[51:40] inside of it that it lines up with
[51:42] hollywood it doesn't matter hallelujah
[51:44] when storms come it doesn't change the
[51:46] law
[51:50] you know how hurricane starts
[51:52] it starts out there on the water right
[51:54] between high pressure and low pressure
[51:56] starts to spill and spinning and then it
[51:58] gets stronger and stronger you know what
[52:00] it doesn't change the law within the
[52:02] fish
[52:09] you say boy that hurricane tore up some
[52:11] stuff and that fish say but i'm still
[52:13] swimming
[52:22] church
[52:24] let me read you something and then i'm
[52:25] gonna get out your way
[52:27] but notice one thing about god hardly
[52:30] and you know i had to i had to
[52:33] get on board with us
[52:35] that god would allow things to happen in
[52:37] your life just to make you better right
[52:39] that's what it's all about
[52:41] you know when people will accuse they'll
[52:43] give false accusations and all these
[52:44] things and god has sit back saying it's
[52:47] exactly where i want them
[52:50] i want them exactly right here in this
[52:52] trial a line up spiritually hallelujah
[52:55] you know what church amen there were two
[52:57] brothers who were twins one name of
[52:59] jacob one name of esau hungary but they
[53:02] didn't know hallelujah god had already
[53:05] gave a promise
[53:06] hallelujah
[53:07] that they told uh what was jacob's wife
[53:10] um rachel rebecca mr rachel
[53:13] told rachel hurling you got two nations
[53:16] inside of you
[53:18] hallelujah
[53:19] two nations
[53:20] so he was already spoken of that these
[53:23] two boys are gonna fight right
[53:25] hallelujah so they come out one grab and
[53:28] the other one healed hallelujah and even
[53:29] while she was pregnant she was feeling
[53:31] the birth pains hallelujah why because
[53:34] there was a word spoken that you got two
[53:36] nations inside of you
[53:39] but you know those nations got to a
[53:41] place where they really had to fight
[53:43] amen now it comes down hallelujah that
[53:46] esau was like more like manly like his
[53:48] daddy he was a hunter he when i got
[53:51] venison and all these things he was
[53:53] rugged he was burning but jacob
[53:55] hallelujah seemed to be soft seemed to
[53:57] be a mama's boy
[53:59] but he had to be close to his mama
[54:01] because his mama was aligned with the
[54:03] promise that he can get the birthright
[54:07] [Applause]
[54:12] he didn't know why he was so close to
[54:14] his mama he had to be close to his mama
[54:17] because he couldn't trick his daddy by
[54:19] himself he needed his mama boy
[54:24] but you know what they were getting in
[54:25] line with god's promise and one day he
[54:28] saw went out to hunt holly it was all in
[54:30] god's alignment right holly he went out
[54:32] to hunt and he couldn't find no venison
[54:35] and jacob hardly because he was close to
[54:37] his mama he knew how to cook
[54:43] [Applause]
[54:46] see it's the alignment of god
[54:49] [Music]
[54:50] you know his friends his friends they
[54:52] might have come through the neighborhood
[54:54] and say jacob you going out to play ball
[54:55] today he said no i'm in the kitchen with
[54:57] my mama cooking
[55:00] if i say he ain't number a little
[55:01] boy
[55:02] little boy we out here shooting
[55:04] bowls and shooting guns and shooting
[55:06] arrows and all that stuff and you and
[55:08] they're talking about cooking
[55:10] he was right in line
[55:12] with god's promise
[55:15] right so there's one day hallelujah
[55:17] all that hanging around mama was going
[55:19] to come into play hey man esau said man
[55:22] i'm hungry i'm about to die hallelujah
[55:24] and jacob say
[55:26] smell that
[55:28] you're hungry
[55:29] smell that
[55:30] and you know what i ain't had to go hunt
[55:32] for it i made this in the kitchen
[55:35] you're hungry he's like yeah man i'm
[55:37] about to die he said hey the only way
[55:38] you can eat hardly jacob get in the line
[55:41] he said the only way you can eat if you
[55:43] give me the birthright and he saw not
[55:45] valuing it like jacob value hallelujah
[55:48] he wasn't willing to stay aligned church
[55:50] it was his
[55:52] the birthright was his but he wasn't
[55:55] able to stay in line with the word of
[55:57] god
[55:58] with the promise of god see church we
[56:00] have to stay in line because there are
[56:02] promises that it's yours
[56:05] but when you got it when you get out of
[56:07] line god will give your promise to
[56:09] somebody else
[56:10] that's right
[56:12] oh my hey esau said what good is this
[56:14] burn right to me man i'm about to die
[56:16] i'm hungry and taking
[56:18] whatever man do what you got to do
[56:22] but to get this right here you got to
[56:24] promise me the birthright he says okay
[56:26] man take the birthright jacob goes in
[56:28] there hallelujah started talking to his
[56:30] daddy started talking imitating he saw
[56:33] and all this look his mama hallelujah
[56:36] helped dress him hey man put hairs on
[56:38] his arms just like he saw and everything
[56:44] why didn't that why did once once they
[56:47] found out hallelujah what jacob and his
[56:50] mama did why didn't isaac get rid of
[56:52] them
[56:57] hallelujah
[56:58] hallelujah
[57:00] amen
[57:01] you cannot hardly judge somebody for
[57:04] doing the will of god
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:12] and that was a lesson for jacob
[57:14] hallelujah
[57:15] something that looked like it was wrong
[57:17] he was really right
[57:18] holly cause she was in position hey man
[57:20] and you know church hallelujah we know
[57:23] jacob tricked his father got the birth
[57:25] right esau comes in finds out he's like
[57:28] oh no father do you have a blessing for
[57:31] me he says my son i've given it all
[57:33] right
[57:34] then he saw you know what i'm gonna kill
[57:36] him
[57:37] i'm gonna kill him
[57:39] and jacob said i got to run i got to go
[57:42] hallelujah but you know what's happening
[57:44] god was lining them up again
[57:51] he got down to layman's house hallelujah
[57:54] he he saw a girl named rachel hallelujah
[57:57] and he said man i want to marry this
[57:59] girl hallelujah so he worked seven years
[58:01] hallelujah worked seven years only to
[58:04] get to the chamber and found out it was
[58:06] leah
[58:09] oh my
[58:11] and just like his mama
[58:13] he learned to push through it hallelujah
[58:16] why didn't he why didn't he get rid of
[58:18] her why because she had will in the
[58:20] chamber and saw his mystery
[58:25] whoa
[58:26] she had rid of the bad chain but
[58:27] hallelujah jacob had injected his seed
[58:30] and he couldn't get it back
[58:35] what was happening holly leah was a part
[58:38] of the alignment she had four boys of
[58:40] that promise
[58:42] hallelujah and did you notice rachel was
[58:44] barren she couldn't have no kids so you
[58:46] know what she said i'll give her my
[58:48] hands made she had two babies hallelujah
[58:50] right and then leo says you you gonna
[58:53] play like that i give him my hands man
[58:55] she has some babies hallelujah and now
[58:57] it looks like there's four women
[58:59] fighting over one man no that was the
[59:01] alignment of god
[59:03] hallelujah because it took those four
[59:05] women to bring forth the children of
[59:07] israel
[59:10] hallelujah
[59:14] what was it it was god spiritually
[59:16] enlightening jacob
[59:21] oh my
[59:22] church let me close
[59:24] let me say to you that
[59:26] when it comes to life there's nothing
[59:27] out of order
[59:30] god is in control
[59:33] he has us exactly where he wants us
[59:37] but what we have to learn how to do
[59:39] is to give god praise in all things
[59:44] paul said if our glory our glory the
[59:46] things are suffering
[59:48] and let's look at some of the things he
[59:49] suffered
[59:50] a night and day in the sea
[59:54] that that ain't talking about in a boat
[59:57] that's in the water
[59:59] a night and day hallelujah dog pedaling
[1:00:04] trying to survive
[1:00:05] hallelujah
[1:00:06] bit by viper
[1:00:09] whip with stripes at least five times
[1:00:12] stoned and thrown over the wall
[1:00:14] paul went through all these things and
[1:00:17] in one place he was in jail and he was
[1:00:19] cold he said and can y'all bring me a
[1:00:21] coat
[1:00:23] and he says if i glory i'll glory the
[1:00:25] things i suffer why because his
[1:00:27] sufferings align him with god
[1:00:32] hallelujah
[1:00:33] i want you to catch a church without the
[1:00:36] submarines he would have never lined up
[1:00:39] and without the alignment hallelujah we
[1:00:41] would have never got the book of the
[1:00:43] book of all ephesus we will not have got
[1:00:45] the book of philippians the book of
[1:00:47] corinthians
[1:00:48] first and second thessalonians the book
[1:00:51] of romans the book of hebrews
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:56] it took all that summary to keep paul
[1:00:59] alive because god said there's an
[1:01:02] abundance of revelation inside of you
[1:01:06] what brought it out suffering
[1:01:13] hallelujah
[1:01:17] oh my
[1:01:18] church
[1:01:19] you know i like to tell young men
[1:01:21] if you ever get to struggling hardly
[1:01:23] about your position go read about king
[1:01:26] david
[1:01:27] hallelujah because king david didn't
[1:01:29] have a spotless life hallelujah but he
[1:01:32] had a life that was worthy to be called
[1:01:34] a man after god's very own heart
[1:01:38] hallelujah
[1:01:39] david had ups david had downs david even
[1:01:43] committed adultery and premeditated
[1:01:44] murder but god said he's a man after my
[1:01:47] very own heart
[1:01:49] hallelujah and as long as david stayed
[1:01:52] aligned with god god always gave him
[1:01:55] mercy
[1:01:58] what was david alignment his alignment
[1:02:00] was repentance
[1:02:07] because no matter what he did
[1:02:09] david fell on his knees and said lord i
[1:02:12] have seen
[1:02:13] father forgive me
[1:02:15] that's why god hallelujah could step out
[1:02:17] there and let him kill a lion let him
[1:02:20] kill a bear then look at goliath and say
[1:02:22] you're going to be just like that lying
[1:02:24] in bed
[1:02:25] why because he was aligned with god's
[1:02:27] word
[1:02:29] hallelujah you read about king david
[1:02:32] david was a man who knew how to wait on
[1:02:34] god
[1:02:36] hallelujah david went out to battle one
[1:02:38] time came back his whole family was gone
[1:02:41] his wives were gone the children was
[1:02:42] gold and the whole camp turned their
[1:02:44] back on david but david knew how to wait
[1:02:46] on god he said lord shall i sit still or
[1:02:50] shall i pursue hallelujah you say lord
[1:02:53] if i see the wind blowing in the marbury
[1:02:55] trees that's when i'll go and david's
[1:02:57] sitting still but he's watching those
[1:02:59] trees because we know god asks us prayer
[1:03:03] what are you looking at
[1:03:05] what are you looking at david had a sign
[1:03:07] pulse and david sodom trees glory david
[1:03:10] told everybody let's go get what belongs
[1:03:12] to us
[1:03:16] that's what you need to tell the devil
[1:03:18] i'm here to get what belongs to me
[1:03:22] i want my family back i want my children
[1:03:25] back i want my health back
[1:03:30] oh my church in the in in the
[1:03:33] restoration of the bride tree the
[1:03:34] prophet of god say we got the right to
[1:03:36] enforce the law
[1:03:40] restoration means we got a right for it
[1:03:42] to be restored back to his original
[1:03:45] condition
[1:03:47] that's why when you get sick and you
[1:03:49] believe the blood of jesus christ you're
[1:03:51] enforcing the devil to let go that's
[1:03:53] right that's right
[1:03:56] amen what he gonna do what are you gonna
[1:03:57] say
[1:03:58] he can't say that
[1:04:00] he can't do it he can't hold on
[1:04:02] once you proclaim the blood of jesus
[1:04:04] christ he got to let go
[1:04:07] hallelujah
[1:04:08] once you confess the lord jesus christ
[1:04:11] as your savior you've got to let go
[1:04:14] but the problem is we forget so often
[1:04:17] what god has done
[1:04:19] what i love what david did when he
[1:04:21] killed goliath
[1:04:22] david tucked the head right
[1:04:29] david took the head of the enemy
[1:04:31] and i can imagine
[1:04:33] they went to the next battle
[1:04:35] and they started talking they gnaws and
[1:04:37] all this and that and david probably
[1:04:39] stood up in front of everybody and he
[1:04:41] probably got out there in front of the
[1:04:42] whole armies of all the different armies
[1:04:44] of the hittites and and philistines he
[1:04:47] said hey y'all show y'all want to do
[1:04:48] this
[1:04:50] y'all so y'all want to fight me and my
[1:04:51] army
[1:04:53] before y'all think about fighting us
[1:04:57] he pulled the head of the light out and
[1:04:58] say
[1:04:59] do you all remember this guy
[1:05:02] right y'all remember
[1:05:03] how he how he made havoc all over the
[1:05:06] world
[1:05:06] how you make habit from kingdom to
[1:05:08] kingdom do y'all remember him
[1:05:11] my god has delivered him into my hands
[1:05:18] church you need to pull hallelujah your
[1:05:21] testimonies back out

[1:05:27] and say look what god has done i've seen
[1:05:29] them do it

[1:05:37] your life
[1:05:44] oh my church i'm a close
[1:05:46] look seek ye first the kingdom
[1:05:49] and all these things are gone
[1:05:51] the prophet god said you don't have to
[1:05:53] do nothing special
[1:05:55] it says and these signs
[1:05:57] shall follow them that belief
[1:06:00] church even right now while i'm

[1:06:38] you thought you thought it was an
[1:06:41] unspoken request
[1:06:42] but god knows all things
[1:06:52] [Music]
[1:06:54] babies
[1:07:07] church i've seen god do so many great
[1:07:09] things
[1:07:11] this ain't a time to be discouraged
[1:07:14] church he got us right where he want us
[1:07:17] you know what makes the the the battle
[1:07:19] at that at the red sea so powerful
[1:07:22] god wanted to pull something out of them
[1:07:24] they didn't even know they had in them
[1:07:26] so once they got through the sea holly
[1:07:28] the bible says miriam took a a
[1:07:31] tambourine
[1:07:32] hallelujah and she started the dancing
[1:07:36] what i want you to understand earlier
[1:07:38] that tambourine was created in bondage
[1:07:47] so even while she was in bondage
[1:07:50] she still had a praise
[1:07:52] hallelujah
[1:07:54] when she got through the red sea holly
[1:07:56] another brother saying why did they
[1:07:58] dance because they look behind them and
[1:08:00] all of their heartaches all their pain
[1:08:03] all they distress all their misery oh
[1:08:06] they start coming all the things that
[1:08:08] the devil would do was washed up in the
[1:08:11] sea
[1:08:13] [Applause]
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:16] and they started to dance in hallelujah
[1:08:19] and the bible says
[1:08:21] moses sung a new
[1:08:51] he started a new song why because a new
[1:08:54] song is a new inspiration
[1:08:56] and a new song is a new victory
[1:09:04] come on musicians
[1:09:06] church
[1:09:07] don't get tired
[1:09:10] praise god now was our time
[1:09:12] yeah amen
[1:09:13] now it's time for us to see things that
[1:09:15] we've been praying about
[1:09:18] hallelujah
[1:09:19] we're in the season
[1:09:22] if we can see solomon gomorrah on the
[1:09:24] earth we ought to be seeing our prayers
[1:09:27] come to pass
[1:09:31] solomon gomorrah is here
[1:09:33] they mean they have they have uh uh uh
[1:09:35] uh gay month honestly
[1:09:38] when they run around they perverted the
[1:09:39] covenant making the rainbow day symbol
[1:09:42] bunch of liars
[1:09:46] hallelujah
[1:09:47] but you know what i don't get mad when i
[1:09:48] see that
[1:09:49] that just let me know that god has to
[1:09:51] answer my prayer
[1:09:53] because if i see noah's day
[1:09:56] if i see lot's day hallelujah right here
[1:09:58] where i'm at god said in that day
[1:10:00] hallelujah he would restore
[1:10:03] [Applause]
[1:10:06] everything that the devil has taken
[1:10:10] why
[1:10:11] because it's the law
[1:10:13] look
[1:10:14] when a baby cub a lion
[1:10:16] is born
[1:10:18] there's a law already in him
[1:10:21] there's a law inside of him that that
[1:10:23] little that little roar that you go
[1:10:28] as a cub that's how it sounds
[1:10:31] there's a law inside of him that one day
[1:10:34] that look
[1:10:35] is going to be heard for five miles
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:44] all he has to do is grow
[1:10:49] he don't have to do nothing special
[1:10:51] all he got to do is eat and push out
[1:10:54] drink and push out
[1:10:56] and then one day he'll be in the
[1:10:58] wilderness and he'll go
[1:11:00] and everybody will see how much he has
[1:11:03] matured
[1:11:10] and there'll be there'll be other people
[1:11:13] in the jungle there'll be other animals
[1:11:15] in the jungle that grew right up with
[1:11:17] him but when he was a cub they didn't
[1:11:19] fear him hallelujah but now he's an
[1:11:22] adult
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:25] they didn't even challenge him
[1:11:28] just by the sound coming out of his
[1:11:30] mouth
[1:11:31] what about you church
[1:11:33] sometimes satan would dare to challenge
[1:11:35] you by what's coming out of your mouth
[1:11:38] speak the spoken word
[1:11:45] let's stay in line with god
[1:11:48] and god will continue to do his part
[1:11:51] hallelujah we have a right to enforce
[1:11:53] these laws
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:56] because it says seek ye first the
[1:11:57] kingdom
[1:11:58] and all these things
[1:12:00] will follow you
[1:12:01] [Music]

[1:15:07] your faith will put it there
[1:15:09] right you know abraham abraham was was
[1:15:11] was was believing god that isaac was the

[1:16:01] i seen him do it
[1:16:04] [Applause]
[1:16:08] let me tell you what i'm operating let
[1:16:10] me tell you what i'm lining myself up
[1:16:12] i'm aligning myself with malachi
[1:16:14] hallelujah where it says bring the
[1:16:16] master house first hallelujah and he
[1:16:19] said hallelujah that you'll be blessed
[1:16:21] and you say see if i will open the

[1:16:37] those of you who ain't paying your
[1:16:39] tithes you know you curse

[1:16:53] surplus of money sitting in the bank no
[1:16:56] everything god sent me allowed to happen
[1:16:58] these testimonies is what i needed in

[1:17:40] all god's trying to do is get that
[1:17:42] praise out of you
[1:17:45] that's what the red sea was all about
[1:17:48] the red sea was about some praise
[1:17:50] the last she was about some dancing
[1:17:53] hallelujah and after they went through
[1:17:55] that red team
[1:17:56] hallelujah there were two million people
[1:17:59] on the bank dancing and singing and
[1:18:02] shouting
[1:18:04] god trying to get some praise out of you
[1:18:12] let's pray
[1:18:13] let's pray
[1:18:15] lord we love you jesus
[1:18:19] lord we worship you
[1:18:22] you're such a great god
