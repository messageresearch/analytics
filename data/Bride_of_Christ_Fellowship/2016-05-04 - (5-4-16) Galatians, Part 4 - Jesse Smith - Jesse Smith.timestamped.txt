[45:50] 5 verse one like to start there we left
[45:53] off at the end of chapter 4
[45:57] I've got a little bit of feedback that
[45:59] these uh Galatians messages are really
[46:01] helping understanding of the word so I'm
[46:03] thankful for that got a lot of feedback
[46:05] on Sunday morning service thank God for
[46:07] that and some feedback on the evening so
[46:09] really appreciate all the feedback about
[46:11] the grace of the Lord helps us know

[46:15] Lord so we just want to stay in the
[46:16] right channel by the grace of the Lord
[46:18] Galatians chapter
[46:21] five and my hope tonight I said that's
[46:23] my hope is to get done with chapter five
[46:25] tonight and then we have one more to go
[46:27] so I thought there's probably two more
[46:29] messages maybe three depending on some
[46:31] of these texts I've been reading into
[46:33] Ephesians I'm aring to Ephesians 4 and
[46:35] taking notes and quotes and history uh
[46:38] to try to teach in Ephesians brother
[46:41] Braham preached quite a bit on Ephesians
[46:43] as a parallel to Christian maturity and
[46:46] the adoption and the uh Israel taking
[46:49] the Promise Land he typed that quite
[46:51] often so uh trying to pull out the the
[46:54] quotations that are blessing there by
[46:56] the grace of the Lord so Galatians
[46:58] chapter 5 verse
[47:01] one we'll just
[47:03] read uh one
[47:05] through uh let's one through five by
[47:09] God's grace Galatians 5 1-5 there say

[47:15] in the Liberty where with Christ hath
[47:17] made us free be not entangled again with
[47:19] the Yoke of bondage behold I Paul say
[47:22] unto you that if you be circumcised
[47:24] Christ shall profit you nothing for I
[47:28] testify again to every man that is
[47:29] circumcised that he is a deor to do the
[47:31] whole law Christ has become of no effect
[47:34] unto you whosoever of you are justified
[47:37] by the law you are fallen from grace for
[47:40] we through the spirit wait for the hope
[47:42] of
[47:43] righteousness by faith amen father let's
[47:47] bow our heads if you have a word on or

[48:17] a help and a strength God so I pray you
[48:19] speak again to us tonight for your glory
[48:22] in Jesus Christ's name everybody said
[48:23] amen amen God bless you being and SE
[48:25] there praise
[48:35] praise the lord we would like to uh go
[48:37] through this here tonight by the grace
[48:38] of the
[48:41] Lord and uh ask the Lord to help us here
[48:44] as we have and I trust he will uh before
[48:47] we uh jump into chapter 5 I just want to
[48:49] share a few things here U you know
[48:52] brother bradam
[48:53] said brother Bram used two significant
[48:56] portions of Galatians to preach some
[48:58] important messages in 1965 I just was
[49:01] looking and found some of these and uh
[49:03] brother RAM used Galatians 1 to preach
[49:06] the God of this evil age in
[49:08] 1965 so that's a great quote there and
[49:12] uh also you use Galatians 4 uh the text
[49:16] about ishmail and Isaac to preach the
[49:18] message the seed shall not be air with
[49:20] the shook that's an important message
[49:22] because the seed people are the promised
[49:24] people not the not the bondage people
[49:27] not the law people not the Ishmael
[49:30] people of you know Sarah trying to bring
[49:32] it the promise to pass through her own
[49:34] thinking but it's those who waited upon
[49:36] the promise of God that's who God
[49:38] blesses amen that's the perfect will of
[49:40] God so we thank the Lord for that so I
[49:42] just thought I'd share those those are
[49:43] important texts right out of Galatians
[49:46] uh there's other numerous sermons where
[49:49] brother brand would hit many scriptures
[49:50] in here um the one I found often was
[49:53] Galatians 1 where Paul said you preach
[49:55] any other gospel than what I preach he's
[49:57] cursed brother BR would bring that to
[49:59] the godhead he'd bring that to the water
[50:01] baptism amen and just use that that's a
[50:04] great course for us that uh for us
[50:06] that's studied it it's very familiar but
[50:09] it's important part now we've been
[50:10] looking at this more on a on a not not
[50:13] not a broad level but a very specific
[50:15] level we've been looking at the book of
[50:17] Galatians and I believe if we look at it
[50:19] the right way it'll continue to bless us
[50:21] here uh as we saw the major problem with
[50:24] the galatian church was legal ISM okay
[50:27] they they were taking Commandments that
[50:29] God wasn't requiring anymore that they
[50:31] they came in we'll say like this they
[50:32] came in the message and it wasn't part
[50:35] of the the the Commandments of God and
[50:37] then some false preachers brought in
[50:38] some legalism and said well you got to
[50:40] do this to be saved and they're like
[50:42] what do you mean the spirit just fell
[50:44] you know but then they started believing
[50:46] it and Paul said you're foolish right
[50:48] you called him foolish and he said I
[50:50] doubt he said I doubt where you stand
[50:52] with God need need to travail in birth
[50:53] again until your uh really born again so
[50:56] we know that legalism doesn't produce a
[50:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost experience so
[51:01] we know that and so we've just got to
[51:03] understand that the difference between
[51:05] legalism and obedience obedience is just
[51:07] love uh love keep love keeping the
[51:10] Commandments of God whereas legalism is
[51:12] excessive strictness uh an obedience
[51:15] that is based upon fear and not by love
[51:17] it's a obedience based upon even things
[51:19] that are not commanded of the people
[51:21] it's something excessive so if Jesus
[51:24] said I always do that which please the
[51:26] father so we so we can and we can do it
[51:28] with the right attitude not legalism but
[51:31] based upon love and that's where we
[51:32] always get confused well you're a bunch
[51:34] of legalists with your women with long
[51:35] skirts and men with short hair and all
[51:38] these things and they make us legalist
[51:40] but we're not legalists we're just
[51:41] simply obeying we're doing what pleases
[51:43] our Lord amen so we have to make that
[51:46] important uh distinction and listen
[51:48] Church uh if the Bible talks about
[51:51] legalism then we need to use examples
[51:52] from the Bible right so if the Bible
[51:55] gives these examples observing days and
[51:57] times and years and uh circumcision as
[52:00] legalism well then we got to we got to
[52:01] believe that and we got to apply that to
[52:03] our church and make sure we're not
[52:05] injecting anything that would be
[52:07] legalism uh that's not required in this
[52:09] hour all right now I want to read this
[52:12] let's go to Second Peter 3 this is kind
[52:14] of a little off the off the uh maybe the
[52:17] thought but I just want to remind you
[52:18] this this came to my memory uh as I Was
[52:21] preparing last time so let's go to
[52:23] Second Peter 3
[52:28] and verse
[52:33] 14 and I just want to before I I read
[52:35] this here I just want to tell you that
[52:37] as I read the letters of Paul I'm doing
[52:39] my best to rightly divide it because
[52:42] every preacher has to rightly divide it
[52:44] and every preacher will answer how they
[52:46] build upon the foundation of the
[52:47] Apostles everyone Paul said every
[52:49] preacher will answer for that and so uh
[52:53] based upon that you know sometimes you
[52:55] might said well brother Jess why don't
[52:56] you stop and preach this verse well
[52:58] that's probably because I didn't
[52:59] understand it and I wasn't the only
[53:01] one right because we're going to read
[53:03] right here where Peter didn't always
[53:05] even understand Paul's writings praise
[53:08] the Lord Paul's writings were so deep
[53:11] sometimes Peter said even I don't
[53:13] understand them sometimes so what do we
[53:15] need to do if we don't understand on
[53:16] something wait upon the Lord on it amen
[53:18] all right this verse 14 second Peter
[53:21] 3:14 wherefore beloved seeing that you
[53:24] look for such things be diligent that
[53:26] you may be found of him in peace without
[53:27] spot and blameless and account that the
[53:30] longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation
[53:32] so see as time goes on we don't get
[53:34] upset and say where's the Rapture where
[53:36] come on Lord we don't get discouraged
[53:38] come on church it's your fault no Peter
[53:40] said count it as a fact that God is
[53:42] having more longsuffering and saving
[53:44] more Souls praise God don't get
[53:46] discouraged if it's not on your
[53:47] timetable let's try to get our thoughts
[53:49] on God's timetable yes
[53:52] Glory even as our brother beloved now
[53:55] beloved brother Paul here's a man that
[53:57] rebuked him into his face and he still
[53:58] says you're my beloved
[54:00] brother look at that love in the early
[54:02] church by our beloved brother Paul also
[54:05] according to the wisdom given him given
[54:07] unto him hath written unto you verse 16
[54:12] as also in all his Epistles all his
[54:15] letters look at this all his letters
[54:17] speaking in them of these things in
[54:19] which are some things hard to be
[54:22] understood praise God so he said some
[54:25] these letters you write Paul they're
[54:26] really hard to
[54:28] understand and he is a man that had the
[54:31] keys to the kingdom praise the Lord so
[54:35] as we go through this you know as we go
[54:36] through you know Ephesians well
[54:38] Galatians Ephesians Colossians
[54:39] Philippians and Lord willing if we go to
[54:41] Corinthians things like that keep this
[54:43] in mind there's some things that are
[54:44] real deep here that even Apostle Paul
[54:46] could or even Apostle Peter could
[54:48] understand and that's okay um so here he
[54:52] goes he keeps going here hard to be
[54:54] understood let's finish verse 16 right
[54:55] in the middle which they that are
[54:58] unlearned and unstable rest now that
[55:00] means to
[55:02] twist so if someone's unstable they'll
[55:05] twist what Paul said but yet really they
[55:07] don't understand it and they twist it to
[55:09] make it say something that it doesn't
[55:11] say as they also do the other scriptures
[55:15] so see these false preachers they just
[55:17] don't twist one scripture they twist a
[55:18] lot of
[55:19] scriptures so as you see as I told you I
[55:21] want to preach a message on uh when Mo
[55:24] when many of the preachers left the
[55:25] message I've been wanting to preach that
[55:26] I didn't have time to do it lately but I
[55:28] want to preach that and show you some of
[55:30] our Believers and friends that have left
[55:32] the message if you look back on what
[55:34] they taught you can see TW rest after
[55:36] rest after rest after twist after twist
[55:39] after breaking of the word time and time
[55:41] again and I I wonder who caught up on it
[55:44] right right so what do we need to do we
[55:46] need to rightly divide the word and ask
[55:48] the Lord to help discern the truth to us
[55:51] can say can you say Amen to that am
[55:53] that's what we're going to that's why I
[55:54] preach out before I want to bring out I
[55:55] want to show I know at least four or
[55:56] five preachers left the message but as
[55:58] you go through and as I I went back and
[56:00] listened to some of their messages and
[56:01] thought about what they preached there
[56:03] was many times they Twisted the
[56:04] scripture and made it say something that
[56:06] it didn't say all right so we want to
[56:08] get to that but look they they did this
[56:11] to other scriptures finishing verse 16
[56:13] unto their own
[56:14] destruction I don't know if that's
[56:16] physical destruction like in 1
[56:18] Corinthians 5 remember where Paul said I
[56:20] turn them over to the uh to the devil
[56:22] that their flesh might be destroyed that
[56:23] their soul might be saved
[56:25] I don't know if it's that destruction or
[56:27] if it's Soul destruction only God knows
[56:30] ye therefore beloved seeing you know
[56:32] that these things before beware lest ye
[56:34] also being led away with the heir of the
[56:36] wicked well if it's wicked then it's
[56:38] lost soul in context fall from your own
[56:42] steadfastness okay so erors help make
[56:45] you fall from your own steadfastness but
[56:47] I like Verse 18 here's what we need to
[56:48] do we need to what grow in the grace and
[56:52] in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
[56:54] Jesus Christ to him be glory both down
[56:56] forever amen all right so let's go back
[56:58] to Galatians 5 so you see Paul wrote a
[57:01] lot of hard things and maybe some things
[57:03] were hard to understand but instead of
[57:05] trying to interpret them let's leave
[57:07] them alone until we understand and not
[57:09] try to twist them uh to get off into any
[57:12] air of any wickedness or lust but help
[57:15] us God to stay with the word grow in
[57:17] Grace and a knowledge of the Lord and
[57:18] Savior praise God so I just want to
[57:21] bring that to your mind that as we study
[57:23] Paul Paul's not an easy one to study
[57:26] if if a if a prophet of God who had the
[57:27] Keys of the Kingdom admitted some of
[57:29] these things are hard to understand uh
[57:31] then I hope youall have grace and mercy
[57:33] on me okay but the fact is we need to
[57:35] read them and we need to apply them to
[57:36] our lives that's the fact we need to
[57:38] read through the Bible praise the Lord
[57:40] so how many of us are reading our Bibles
[57:42] like we ought to I'm not asking you
[57:43] raise your hands right but we should be
[57:45] amen and these scriptures uh are very
[57:47] helpful to us of
[57:49] course okay now let's start at verse one
[57:52] Galatians 5 verse1 stand Stand Fast
[57:55] therefore in the Liberty where with
[57:57] Christ has made us free and be not
[57:59] entangled again with the Yoke of bondage
[58:01] that song comes to my mind to rise uh
[58:04] possess your
[58:05] inheritance amen okay now how many you
[58:08] know what the word Liberty means it
[58:09] means to Omit things that have no
[58:12] relation to Salvation that's really a
[58:15] striking definition so if you're
[58:17] standing in the liberty of Christ then
[58:20] you omit or get rid of anything that's
[58:22] outside of Salvation in other words you
[58:25] have so much Liberty that you get rid of
[58:27] everything I'm so free I'm free from all
[58:29] sin and all I do is stand in the
[58:31] salvation of Jesus Christ that's Liberty
[58:34] it's not enjoy sin it's actually avoid
[58:36] all sin and I'm free in Christ because
[58:39] I'm only dwelling in the word that's
[58:41] what Liberty means okay it also means
[58:45] true Liberty is living as we ought to
[58:47] and not as we please other words true
[58:49] Liberty is living the word loving the
[58:51] word and not living to the flesh Okay so
[58:54] somebody can't say well we're so Liberty
[58:56] we have so much freedom in Christ that
[58:58] we can do whatever we want no a real
[59:01] Christian does whatever they want but uh
[59:03] whatever they do is the word of God
[59:04] whatever they want is the word of God
[59:06] they only want the word in other words
[59:08] all right good now so in other words
[59:12] Church it will be a battle to remain
[59:15] free in Christ so he said Stand Fast uh
[59:19] that we be not entangled again with the
[59:21] Yoke of
[59:22] bondage so we don't want to be tempted
[59:24] or Tangled into legalism or living by
[59:27] works or living by fear we want to live
[59:28] by
[59:29] love okay that's very important for us
[59:32] verse two and here's what he's talking
[59:34] about so here's the context behold I
[59:37] Paul say unto you that if you be
[59:38] circumcised Christ shall profit you
[59:41] nothing now think about this he didn't
[59:43] say circumcision will profit you a
[59:45] little bit he said nothing praise the
[59:49] Lord now remember remember Timothy was
[59:51] circumcised so that didn't profit him
[59:53] nothing as far as with Christ
[59:55] but it did profit him fellowship with
[59:56] the Christian Jews is everybody with me
[1:00:00] so that act of itself did nothing for
[1:00:02] Paul in Jesus's eyes as far as you know
[1:00:05] anything for salvation but it did give
[1:00:07] him a little more Fellowship amen glory
[1:00:10] and that they might receive him so see
[1:00:13] this this lawke keeping doesn't profit
[1:00:15] anything nothing at all now verse four
[1:00:18] three for I testify again to every man
[1:00:21] that is circumcised he's a deader to do
[1:00:23] the whole law and that's something he
[1:00:25] said my if you're going to bring this
[1:00:26] legalism back in then you better keep
[1:00:28] all of it praise God that's what we
[1:00:31] don't want to do we don't want to inject
[1:00:32] anything back in that's already been
[1:00:34] fulfilled and done away with that's
[1:00:36] right now look at verse four Christ has
[1:00:39] become of no effect unto you whosoever
[1:00:41] of you are Fallen I'm sorry are
[1:00:43] justified by the law you're fallen from
[1:00:45] Grace now Paul's getting real serious
[1:00:47] now because the fall means to lose it if
[1:00:49] you look in the Greek to lose Grace so
[1:00:52] as soon as someone starts really
[1:00:54] hammered on this and as we see these are
[1:00:55] false preachers right this not somebody
[1:00:57] who made a mistake and repented these
[1:00:59] false preachers were were uh evil okay
[1:01:02] and so when they started getting people
[1:01:04] to believe that and when they themselves
[1:01:06] were uh believing in legalism they lost
[1:01:09] the effects of Grace the blessings of
[1:01:11] Grace
[1:01:13] okay now remember the scripture says
[1:01:16] that about Grace uh Grace will never let
[1:01:19] anyone down but the Bible said a person
[1:01:21] can fail
[1:01:22] Grace Esau failed the grace of God he
[1:01:26] casts it away so instead of saying well
[1:01:27] I'll take the grace he cast it away and
[1:01:29] we rather have a life of fornication and
[1:01:31] a profane
[1:01:33] life okay so see grace is free like that
[1:01:36] seed of the four grounds remember the
[1:01:38] seed is free for anybody it depends what
[1:01:40] kind of ground you have it depends what
[1:01:41] you do with that seed okay so they fall
[1:01:45] from grace or lose Grace when they take
[1:01:48] law they lose it so they're not under
[1:01:51] grace
[1:01:53] okay now that's pretty rough he Paul
[1:01:56] just he just Paul don't he he just tears
[1:01:59] it up he just takes the ax to the root
[1:02:01] of the tree right like a real Prophet
[1:02:03] amen verse five for we through the
[1:02:05] spirit wait for the hope of
[1:02:06] righteousness by Jesus Christ so Paul's
[1:02:08] saying by the Holy Ghost we're waiting
[1:02:10] for his righteousness we're not trying
[1:02:11] to establish it by lawke keeping but
[1:02:14] we're trusting that right his
[1:02:15] righteousness will come okay so we're
[1:02:17] waiting by faith but they're trying to
[1:02:19] physically produce righteousness
[1:02:21] themselves by their lawke keeping but he
[1:02:23] said we're not that we're trusting in
[1:02:25] the righteousness that is to Come Oh
[1:02:28] Glory all right verse
[1:02:32] six for in Christ Jesus neither
[1:02:34] circumcision availeth anything nor
[1:02:37] uncircumcision but Faith which worketh
[1:02:40] by love amen so what what avails now
[1:02:43] Avail means to have
[1:02:45] power so what has
[1:02:47] power in Christ Jesus the Bible said
[1:02:51] it's faith that operates by love what's
[1:02:54] faith a
[1:02:55] substance of a promise of God received
[1:02:58] right so that's what avails that's what
[1:03:01] has power with God when your love moves
[1:03:03] you to believe the promise you receive
[1:03:05] the promise and now you've got power
[1:03:07] with God youve got power of God's
[1:03:09] promises to come to pass in your life
[1:03:12] that's what avails that's what has power
[1:03:15] with God when you love God so much you
[1:03:17] just believe his word oh Hallelujah
[1:03:20] church amen I just love God so much I
[1:03:23] believe he's going to do it because he
[1:03:24] loves me and I love him
[1:03:27] amen all right that's what that's the
[1:03:29] kind of faith we need faith that works
[1:03:30] by love not faith that works by
[1:03:33] scaredness okay or fear being lost but
[1:03:36] Faith which works by love I know he
[1:03:38] loves me I know he'll keep his word to
[1:03:40] me amen all right verse seven now look
[1:03:43] they started well you did run
[1:03:46] well he said who did hinder you that you
[1:03:49] should not obey the the truth now the
[1:03:51] Run means to exert all your efforts so
[1:03:53] they were exerting all the effort in
[1:03:54] Grace see grace makes you work right
[1:03:57] Grace makes you want to do something for
[1:03:58] Jesus yeah so see they were running well
[1:04:01] but something hindered them which means
[1:04:04] persuaded them or to beat them back so
[1:04:06] they're running well they're running for
[1:04:08] the gospel and something gets in their
[1:04:09] way and starts beat them back no don't
[1:04:11] go forward with the gospel don't go
[1:04:12] forward with the gospel and it starts
[1:04:15] hindering their run or their walk with
[1:04:17] the Lord and what did it
[1:04:19] legalism well I'm holier than this
[1:04:21] brother or sister because I do this and
[1:04:24] and they inject it into the gospel
[1:04:26] that's right oh my so he says you did
[1:04:30] you ran where you started off good see
[1:04:31] it's not how you start is the fact that
[1:04:33] you got to finish praise the Lord
[1:04:35] remember the Bible said you must receive
[1:04:36] the end of your faith so anybody can
[1:04:39] have a beginning of Faith but it's those
[1:04:41] who have the end of their faith it's
[1:04:43] those who never quit it's those who
[1:04:44] never Cast Away the faith it's those who
[1:04:46] continue in the promises of God they are
[1:04:48] the ones blessed of the Lord how many
[1:04:50] going to continue in Christ all the days
[1:04:51] of your life amen Lord I'll never turn
[1:04:54] away there's no turning back I have
[1:04:56] decide to follow Jesus amen the cross
[1:04:58] before me the World Behind Me amen oh
[1:05:01] yes Glory I started with Jesus and I'm
[1:05:04] going through praise God verse eight
[1:05:06] this persuasion cometh not of him that
[1:05:08] calls you so God didn't persuade them to
[1:05:10] do legalism and God won't persuade us to
[1:05:13] do
[1:05:14] legalism God did not do that Paul did
[1:05:17] not persuade them for legalism this is
[1:05:19] someone outside of the original Bringers
[1:05:21] of the message here the word of God
[1:05:23] someone outside injected this thought in
[1:05:25] there that's right God don't persuade us
[1:05:27] to be legalists to try to earn our own
[1:05:30] righteousness all right now verse nine a
[1:05:33] little leav loving the whole love that
[1:05:35] ought to be familiar to us remember 1
[1:05:37] Corinthians 5 remember that man was
[1:05:38] sleeping with his stepmom and Paul said
[1:05:41] you haven't mourned about it he said a
[1:05:43] little leevan makes the whole CH Church
[1:05:46] sinful okay same thing here so now now
[1:05:49] you start to see how each church is
[1:05:51] different you see that they the
[1:05:54] Corinthians church and the galatian
[1:05:55] church both had leaven one was a sexual
[1:05:58] sin one was a
[1:06:00] legalistic and one couldn't say well
[1:06:02] you're I'm more holier than you they
[1:06:04] couldn't because Paul said they're it's
[1:06:06] both sin so whether it's a sexual sin
[1:06:08] the church or a legalistic type of a
[1:06:10] self-righteousness in the church it's
[1:06:12] still leav it's still sin God help us to
[1:06:14] keep the leaven out of our churches amen
[1:06:17] see that that's why these letters are
[1:06:19] important it don't matter what sin it is
[1:06:21] any sin unbelief or lust or Pride or
[1:06:24] anything like that anything will keep
[1:06:26] the move of God hindered but we must
[1:06:29] remember God didn't persuade us to do
[1:06:31] those things praise God God persuaded us
[1:06:33] to love him so much that our faith casts
[1:06:36] down all
[1:06:37] temptation amen
[1:06:42] glory oh I love the word verse 10 I have
[1:06:45] confidence in you through the Lord that
[1:06:48] you will not be none otherwise mine now
[1:06:51] this is a statement too look at this
[1:06:52] statement before he said I stand in
[1:06:54] doubt of you right before he sent you
[1:06:56] foolish Galatians and now he tries he
[1:06:58] rebukes him now he tries to encourage
[1:07:00] him I have confidence in you through the
[1:07:02] Lord so see our confidence if you trust
[1:07:04] in the
[1:07:05] Lord that you will be none you'll be the
[1:07:08] same mind as me that you will understand
[1:07:10] a little leav makes your whole church uh
[1:07:14] stop moving in the Lord makes you sinful
[1:07:17] look at this but he that troubleth you
[1:07:19] shall bear his judgment whosoever be now
[1:07:21] look at that Paul says whoever troubled
[1:07:24] whoever preaches false Doctrine they're
[1:07:26] the ones that can to be judged that
[1:07:29] right remember that says in James
[1:07:31] chapter 3 the Bible said be not Desiring
[1:07:33] many preachers or many Masters because
[1:07:35] they'll receive the greater
[1:07:37] condemnation there's levels of Jud
[1:07:39] judgment right just like there's levels
[1:07:41] of blessings there's also levels of
[1:07:45] condemnation so Paul says it's going to
[1:07:47] come down to this whoever was the false
[1:07:48] preachers they're the ones are going to
[1:07:50] pay the most that's right whoever he be
[1:07:53] you don't name them uh I would say like
[1:07:56] this they're pretty fortunate he didn't
[1:07:57] call their names because Paul lik to
[1:07:59] call names
[1:08:01] right oh yeah he would call names right
[1:08:03] there right in his letters and these are
[1:08:05] your Eternal letters right Eternal Word
[1:08:07] of God verse
[1:08:10] 11 this will help us out here as we move
[1:08:14] on and I Brethren if I yet preach
[1:08:16] circumcision why do I yet suffer
[1:08:18] persecution that is the offense of the
[1:08:21] Cross
[1:08:22] ceased okay so the cross offends the
[1:08:25] Jews because it takes away the necessity
[1:08:27] of circumcision and that was why Paul
[1:08:30] was being persecuted okay here's what
[1:08:33] the ESV says but if I Brothers still
[1:08:35] preach circumcision why am I still being
[1:08:38] persecuted in that case the offense of
[1:08:40] the Cross has been removed so Paul said
[1:08:42] the cross is offensive because Jesus
[1:08:45] paid for all the sins and fulfilled all
[1:08:46] these things because he did that it's an
[1:08:48] offense to those
[1:08:50] legalists okay that's what he says it's
[1:08:53] an offense
[1:08:54] he said so that's why I don't preach it
[1:08:57] because but that's why you're offended
[1:08:58] is because the cross did away with this
[1:09:00] and you're offended because you still
[1:09:01] want to keep it you still want to have
[1:09:03] your own righteousness instead of the
[1:09:04] word of God all right right verse 12 now
[1:09:08] here's a statement too look at this guy
[1:09:10] look at this man of God look at this
[1:09:11] prophet of God he don't pull any punches
[1:09:14] verse 12 I would that they were even cut
[1:09:16] off which trouble you you know what cut
[1:09:19] off means
[1:09:21] amputated you ever seen anybody with
[1:09:23] amputation
[1:09:25] yeah I've seen them missing legs and
[1:09:26] missing fingers and whatever more it's
[1:09:28] just like it's like something should be
[1:09:30] there but it's not and they have to
[1:09:33] relearn how to live their lives because
[1:09:34] they're missing this part and Paul said
[1:09:37] I wish I wish the Holy Ghost would come
[1:09:39] in and amputate these false preachers
[1:09:40] out of the
[1:09:42] church praise God why because false
[1:09:45] preaching brings in
[1:09:47] canorous disease right that's what he
[1:09:50] said in first
[1:09:51] Timothy so see I wish these preachers
[1:09:53] were were uh
[1:09:56] amputated see doesn't play around verse
[1:09:58] 13 for Brethren ye have been called unto
[1:10:00] Liberty remember just stand in Salvation
[1:10:02] stand in Christ stand in just holy
[1:10:04] things just live how the Bible said you
[1:10:06] should live not how man's false
[1:10:08] interpretation tell you
[1:10:10] live he said use only use not Liberty
[1:10:13] for an occasion to the flesh but by love
[1:10:17] serve one another okay that's quite a
[1:10:20] scripture here so you've been called to
[1:10:22] Liberty so serve others so you're called
[1:10:25] to live in just salvation doctrines just
[1:10:27] the Bible doctrines here and so now that
[1:10:30] you're called to the Bible truth God
[1:10:32] truth th serve others not the flesh the
[1:10:35] law is fulfilled in one word love
[1:10:37] remember Jesus said that what's the law
[1:10:39] fulfilled in one word love not works but
[1:10:42] love not legalism
[1:10:44] love okay so if we're really in Christ
[1:10:48] Jesus we should desire to serve others
[1:10:50] to love others praise God
[1:10:54] okay so don't lose use your Liberty for
[1:10:56] an occasion for the flesh now occasion
[1:10:58] means to make a plan don't saywell
[1:11:01] because I'm a Christian I can still sin
[1:11:02] and God will forgive me he said don't do
[1:11:04] that don't make plans to sin try to make
[1:11:06] plans to avoid
[1:11:08] sin yes
[1:11:10] amen so use your Liberty to love and
[1:11:13] serve one another praise God verse 14 I
[1:11:16] love this amen for all the laws
[1:11:19] fulfilled in one word even in this Thou
[1:11:22] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but
[1:11:26] if ye bite and devour one another take
[1:11:28] heed that you be not consumed of one
[1:11:31] another now bite means to bite with the
[1:11:32] teeth to cut or lacerate to Ren with
[1:11:36] reproaches so this could be done people
[1:11:38] can bite each other by just saying evil
[1:11:39] words to one
[1:11:41] another by wounding their here it says
[1:11:43] to wound their soul which is probably
[1:11:45] their Spirit Christians should not bite
[1:11:47] or devour devour means to consume to
[1:11:50] squander or waste someone to strip
[1:11:53] somebody of their goods to utterly
[1:11:56] destroy them okay so we see that the law
[1:12:00] is fulfilled in love and we should not
[1:12:02] destroy one another and then take heed
[1:12:04] if you're going to fight take heed that
[1:12:06] you don't consume one another don't
[1:12:08] destroy each
[1:12:10] other okay verse 16 this I say then walk
[1:12:15] in the spirit and you shall not fulfill
[1:12:17] the lust of the flesh so the only way to
[1:12:20] walk in the spirit is deny the Flesh and
[1:12:22] its lust so these are contrary to one
[1:12:24] another the lust of the flesh is
[1:12:26] contrary totally opposite to the moving
[1:12:28] of the Holy Spirit the spirit is
[1:12:30] opposite of the flesh this is the battle
[1:12:33] uh this battle is the reason why we
[1:12:34] cannot do the things that we would do if
[1:12:37] we wanted if we're led by the spirit
[1:12:39] we're not under the
[1:12:40] law okay that's verse 17 let's read that
[1:12:43] for the flesh lust is against the spirit
[1:12:45] and the spirit against the Flesh and
[1:12:47] these are contrary the one to the other
[1:12:49] that you cannot do the things that you
[1:12:52] would all
[1:12:56] right but if you be led of the spirit
[1:12:58] you're not under the law praise the Lord
[1:13:02] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[1:13:03] now remember when brother digs was here
[1:13:05] that Friday night I read through this
[1:13:06] list you remember that I'm going to read
[1:13:08] it again tonight to remind you okay
[1:13:11] these are the works of the flesh are
[1:13:12] manifest which are these adultery
[1:13:14] fornication uncleanness
[1:13:16] lasciviousness so adultery is sexual
[1:13:19] acts of married people with someone
[1:13:20] they're not married to fornication or
[1:13:23] sexual acts before two people are
[1:13:25] married uncleanness is luxurious living
[1:13:28] or living based upon your lusts
[1:13:30] lasciviousness is lawlessness having no
[1:13:34] sense of Shame all right now verse 20
[1:13:37] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[1:13:39] emulations wrath strife seditions and
[1:13:41] heresies idolatry is giving anything
[1:13:43] worship or reverence other than the Lord
[1:13:46] witchcraft is sorcery magical satanic
[1:13:49] Arts administering of
[1:13:51] drugs hatred is is intense ill will or
[1:13:55] dislike variance is Con heated arguments
[1:13:58] so we got to make sure we don't argue
[1:14:00] right Church make sure we don't argue
[1:14:02] that's probably one that would uh apply
[1:14:04] most to our lives most of by God's grace
[1:14:06] we're I don't know anyone in witchcraft
[1:14:08] thank God for that I don't know anyone
[1:14:09] that's tempted by witchcraft I know
[1:14:11] brothers that have been pulled out of it
[1:14:12] thank God for that like brother uh uh
[1:14:16] brother Brian Hawkins is preacher before
[1:14:18] he was into witchcraft before coming to
[1:14:20] the message and and God delivered him
[1:14:22] from all that got of all his books
[1:14:24] reminds me of Acts 19 remember in Acts
[1:14:25] 19 they went into Ephesus and and
[1:14:27] preached and the Holy Ghost was healing
[1:14:29] and saving people so much that all these
[1:14:31] magicians threw all their books together
[1:14:33] and burned them Remember That Glory I
[1:14:36] like that real book burning amen that's
[1:14:38] the kind of books that need to be burned
[1:14:40] amen glory is books of sin and
[1:14:42] Witchcraft and nonsense now here's
[1:14:45] another one that's in the message
[1:14:46] ulation is jealousy or rivalry rivalry
[1:14:49] between this preacher that one rival
[1:14:51] between that sister and this sister and
[1:14:53] all things rivalries I'm goingon to do
[1:14:54] better I'm gonna I'm going to get more
[1:14:56] than you and all these things like that
[1:14:58] wrath is boiling anger boing up
[1:15:02] passionate anger Strife is a desire to
[1:15:04] put oneself forward electioneering for
[1:15:07] some position just trying to get a
[1:15:08] position that's a Strife I deserve to be
[1:15:12] this I need to be the next officer in
[1:15:14] this area I'm gonna try to push my way
[1:15:16] into that or some other position now
[1:15:20] seditions are divisions we see a lot of
[1:15:22] that around our ranks don't we Satan
[1:15:23] will get into a group and divide them
[1:15:26] and you have a church split right
[1:15:29] anybody ever seen that sure seen that
[1:15:32] that's a division I'm sorry that's a
[1:15:35] sedition but it's also a division heresy
[1:15:37] is teaching your own tenants or opinions
[1:15:39] for followers so instead of teaching
[1:15:41] what the Bible says you teach your own
[1:15:43] opinions praise the Lord that's right
[1:15:46] that's why here like I said we try to
[1:15:47] give it two or three scriptures for
[1:15:48] everything we believe because Jesus said
[1:15:50] that's how you build a Doctrine two or
[1:15:52] three scriptures
[1:15:54] like I said if I'm not doing that and
[1:15:55] somebody help me out by God's grace help
[1:15:57] me out because I want to be right I
[1:15:59] don't want to be a her or heretic right
[1:16:01] I don't I don't want to be Jesse the
[1:16:03] heretic I want to be Jesse the faithful
[1:16:05] witness to Christ amen all right now
[1:16:08] envying is the same as covetousness just
[1:16:10] so you know at least in these Greek
[1:16:12] definitions that's greedy of game eager
[1:16:14] to have more what belongs to others why
[1:16:16] just got to have the house like that or
[1:16:18] the car like that or the wife like that
[1:16:20] or the husband like that it's coveting
[1:16:22] something that person has murderers is
[1:16:25] ending someone's life or just hating
[1:16:27] them because of something they did
[1:16:28] Without a Cause Jesus said drunkards
[1:16:31] becoming intoxicated any form of alcohol
[1:16:33] and revelings is late night parting so
[1:16:36] party okay now let's finish verse 21 of
[1:16:39] the which I tell you before as I have
[1:16:41] also told you in times past they which
[1:16:43] do these things shall what not inherit
[1:16:46] the kingdom of
[1:16:47] God all right is everybody clear on that
[1:16:50] now I love the Bible because look how
[1:16:52] specific pause he he dealing with
[1:16:53] legalists and he said well let me show
[1:16:55] you if you're legalist let me show you
[1:16:56] exactly what sin is and he listed out
[1:16:59] for them to see it amen I'm glad he did
[1:17:00] it praise the Lord I'm glad he did it
[1:17:04] now what would their battles be with
[1:17:07] Heretics because they're bringing their
[1:17:09] own circumcision doctrines in their
[1:17:12] observations of days and years and
[1:17:13] months right they're bringing their own
[1:17:15] tenants in and they're guilty of a
[1:17:18] heresy and he said I he said they're
[1:17:20] going to be destroyed and God will judge
[1:17:22] them if they don't make it right
[1:17:24] this is serious church it's
[1:17:26] serious because these things affect
[1:17:28] Modern Day message churches that's the
[1:17:30] message Church of their day they receive
[1:17:31] the word of the hour We're a message
[1:17:33] Church of our day we receive the word of
[1:17:34] the
[1:17:35] hour yes but the fruit of the spirit
[1:17:39] verse 22 is love joy peace longsuffering
[1:17:42] gentleness goodness Faith I'll go
[1:17:43] through these briefly just like I did
[1:17:45] the others because I just preached on
[1:17:46] the fruit of the spirit a few weeks ago
[1:17:48] meekness Temperance against such there's
[1:17:50] no law I love that there's no law
[1:17:51] against living like this amen so this is
[1:17:54] the Liberty Church this is the Liberty
[1:17:56] where Christ makes us free when we do
[1:17:58] these things right here amen this is the
[1:18:01] Liberty the other one is sin and W
[1:18:03] inherit the kingdom of God but this is
[1:18:05] Liberty in Christ Jesus that's why it's
[1:18:08] better to avoid arguments it's better to
[1:18:09] avoid heresies it's better to avoid any
[1:18:12] parties better to avoid all that because
[1:18:15] uh the real fruit of the spirit will be
[1:18:16] n will be nothing with that it'll be
[1:18:18] totally contrary to it and and you can't
[1:18:21] you can't walk both at the same time
[1:18:22] here walking in the spirit in obedience
[1:18:24] or you're walking in legalism or sin
[1:18:27] that's
[1:18:27] right okay so there's no law against
[1:18:30] love which is good will or Brotherly
[1:18:32] Love or Gabe love you want good for your
[1:18:35] brother or sister you don't want evil
[1:18:36] for them you want good no matter if
[1:18:39] they've done evil to
[1:18:40] you right that's
[1:18:43] love joy is
[1:18:45] gladness I'm just glad all the time I
[1:18:47] just love all the time God help us to
[1:18:49] have that fruit now this is something I
[1:18:51] me didn't mention when I preached on
[1:18:53] fruit of the spirit but remember Jesus
[1:18:55] said you either have genuine fruit or
[1:18:57] crup
[1:18:59] fruit okay so everybody understand that
[1:19:01] so everybody's producing some fruit let
[1:19:03] me say like that that's what I didn't
[1:19:05] preach I didn't get to that that fruit
[1:19:06] is a deep fruit is a deep message as
[1:19:08] well there's a lot of scriptures on it
[1:19:11] but everybody's producing fruit and
[1:19:13] that's what the story brother Brandon
[1:19:14] gave he said if you have an orange tree
[1:19:16] and you cut off the branch and engraft a
[1:19:17] peach it'll produce peaches because it's
[1:19:19] living off the life but it's not the
[1:19:21] original life of the original
[1:19:23] tree and so he said a real Christian
[1:19:25] will produce
[1:19:28] oranges because that's the original life
[1:19:30] of the tree praise God but see the peach
[1:19:33] still produces fruit it's just not the
[1:19:35] right fruit praise God and let me say
[1:19:37] like this foolish virgin produces fruit
[1:19:39] but it's not fruit from the soul it's
[1:19:41] fruit from the human spirit and it'll
[1:19:43] corrupt it'll
[1:19:45] end but real Holy Ghost fruit from the
[1:19:47] soul will be good fruit and it will be
[1:19:50] fruit unto eternal life amen because
[1:19:53] it's from the soul it's Eternal and
[1:19:55] that's where fruits come from the soul
[1:19:56] the seed because the soul is the
[1:19:59] seed so the foolish version has fruits
[1:20:01] from the spirit and they corrupt after a
[1:20:04] while just do something contrary to them
[1:20:06] one time you're going to see some
[1:20:07] corrupt
[1:20:09] fruit
[1:20:10] right that's exactly right but do
[1:20:14] something wrong to a real Holy Ghost
[1:20:15] feel believer they might have to pray
[1:20:16] and struggle but pretty soon they'll be
[1:20:18] praying for you on their
[1:20:20] knees yes amen with long suffering amen
[1:20:24] with
[1:20:26] patience even if it's totally contrary
[1:20:29] to what you think or or say that's right
[1:20:32] that's real fruit how many want real
[1:20:34] Fruit of the Spirit Well I do church I
[1:20:36] really God help me no I got a email
[1:20:40] today or email yesterday from somebody
[1:20:41] who left the message and you know trying
[1:20:44] to convince me uh to reexamine Malachi
[1:20:47] 45
[1:20:50] and6 and uh they were kind in it and so
[1:20:53] forth uh but it's really you know it's
[1:20:56] really good because this is really
[1:20:57] bringing out a lot of good fruits in my
[1:20:59] life am in other words brother Enoch
[1:21:01] I've seen what I'm made of when people
[1:21:03] say you're wrong and you're off the word
[1:21:05] and all these things like that and
[1:21:06] you're know you're you're preaching
[1:21:08] Paul's doctor you're following a man all
[1:21:09] these things like that it's wonderful to
[1:21:11] see the Holy Ghost take over when your
[1:21:14] flesh once in
[1:21:16] fight I got it yesterday and uh you know
[1:21:19] the flesh wants to go fight the Mind
[1:21:20] wants to fight right back but just pray
[1:21:23] and God's my witness God's God's helped
[1:21:26] me instead of being upset when I read it
[1:21:28] the flesh rise up but I just close my
[1:21:30] eyes I'll just pray or laugh or or you
[1:21:32] know with joy and it all that will just
[1:21:35] leave me and I don't feel anything
[1:21:37] toward that person amen glory amen
[1:21:42] because no matter what happens you're
[1:21:43] going to have a fruit you're going to
[1:21:44] produce a fruit based upon that action
[1:21:46] that happened to you so what are you
[1:21:48] going to give him corrupt fruit we don't
[1:21:49] want to do that we're going to give him
[1:21:51] genuine Holy Ghost fruit
[1:21:54] fruit you know saying we're preaching
[1:21:56] heresy and things like that
[1:21:59] not like I said when we preach that
[1:22:01] message everything we believe is right
[1:22:02] out of here that's right everything I
[1:22:04] believe I point you right out of here I
[1:22:07] spend many minutes and maybe hours on
[1:22:09] the YouTube and every everybody that
[1:22:10] emails me saying this is just what we
[1:22:12] believe just the word of God Amen that's
[1:22:15] right now the next fruit is peace
[1:22:18] tranquility safety security Prosperity
[1:22:20] Harmony that's what peace is
[1:22:23] longsuffering is patience endurance
[1:22:25] steadfast slowness to avenge when you've
[1:22:27] been wronged gentleness is moral
[1:22:30] goodness Integrity I like that Integrity
[1:22:32] gentleness is being having integrity and
[1:22:36] kindness goodness is upright of hearten
[1:22:39] life it's upright it's not walking low
[1:22:41] in deception it's upright it's truthful
[1:22:44] faith is of course the substance of
[1:22:45] Faith meekness is the mildness you're
[1:22:48] mild instead of instead of uh hot you're
[1:22:51] mild
[1:22:53] hot with the temper you're mild with the
[1:22:55] sweetness of the Holy
[1:22:57] Spirit and temperate means you have
[1:23:00] self-control the virtue of one who
[1:23:02] Masters his desires and passions
[1:23:05] especially his sensual appetites is't
[1:23:07] that beautiful ah my that's beautiful
[1:23:10] praise the Lord so now you know what
[1:23:12] legalists will struggle with legalists
[1:23:13] will struggle with those real fruits
[1:23:15] right there right they because they're
[1:23:18] Heretics and if they're if they're off
[1:23:20] the word they can't produce if you're
[1:23:21] walking the flesh you cannot walk in the
[1:23:23] spirit praise the
[1:23:26] Lord so you see that I hope that's
[1:23:28] understandable now there's no law
[1:23:30] against those fruits now verse 24 and
[1:23:32] they that are Christ have crucified the
[1:23:34] flesh with the affections and lusts
[1:23:37] remember we preached that right before
[1:23:38] on Good Friday Christ's crucifixion and
[1:23:41] our crucifixion amen and we must daily
[1:23:45] crucify the lust of the flesh since I
[1:23:47] preached that church I've had many times
[1:23:49] I've been praying recently on my knees
[1:23:51] and that's been my prayer Lord this
[1:23:52] morning I Crucify My
[1:23:54] will anybody else praying that I hope
[1:23:56] you are it's good to crucify it right
[1:23:58] away in the morning so he's dead when
[1:24:01] you go to work or when you go see your
[1:24:02] friends or whatever you're doing when
[1:24:03] you you go to work or school or whatever
[1:24:05] more it's good to be already dead right
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:09] amen crucify with the affection and lust
[1:24:12] thereof verse 25 if we live in the
[1:24:13] spirit let us also walk in the spirit
[1:24:17] let us not be desirous of vain
[1:24:19] Glory okay uh Pro provoking one another
[1:24:23] envying one another okay so let's look
[1:24:24] at these words what's vain glory mean
[1:24:27] eager for Glory or to be
[1:24:29] conceited so we don't want to be
[1:24:31] conceited the legalists will be
[1:24:33] conceited always talking about
[1:24:35] themselves always uh bragging on
[1:24:38] themselves and eager somebody to give
[1:24:40] them Glory provoking others is to
[1:24:43] challenge or irritate or contest or
[1:24:47] combat with somebody so we don't want to
[1:24:50] be glory looking for Glory be conceited
[1:24:52] we don't don't want to be provoke others
[1:24:53] to want to combat them I'll I'll argue
[1:24:55] to the death about this with
[1:24:58] you we don't want to do that church but
[1:25:01] that's what legalists
[1:25:03] do and we don't want to uh Envy one
[1:25:06] another right which is we don't want to
[1:25:09] uh try to compare ourselves to be like
[1:25:13] others
[1:25:14] okay all right let's go to chapter six
[1:25:16] look like we're doing pretty good on
[1:25:17] time here by the grace of the Lord
[1:25:20] praise God yeah maybe we'll finish
[1:25:21] tonight by the grace the
[1:25:24] Lord we'll see chapter
[1:25:27] 6 now I hope this is starting to come
[1:25:30] together for you like it's coming
[1:25:31] together for me to really understand why
[1:25:33] was this letter written who's it for
[1:25:36] what's it really mean for the local
[1:25:38] church everybody see how it means
[1:25:40] something to us now as a local church we
[1:25:42] got to keep all the all the fleshly
[1:25:44] things out all the divisions all the
[1:25:47] lust all the fornication adultery
[1:25:50] everything it must be kept out out we
[1:25:53] must not inject anything to the word
[1:25:55] just say what the word says all
[1:25:58] right okay verse one chapter 6 verse
[1:26:03] one all right
[1:26:06] Brethren now look this is quite a
[1:26:08] statement to tell a bunch of people that
[1:26:09] were struggling with legalism Brethren
[1:26:11] if a man be overtaken in a fault ye
[1:26:14] which are spiritual restore such and one
[1:26:16] in the spirit of meekness considering
[1:26:19] thyself lest thou be tempted
[1:26:23] all right so he just told this this
[1:26:25] church you know that was caught in
[1:26:28] legalism he just told the fruits of the
[1:26:29] spirit The Works of the Flesh and now he
[1:26:32] says if you see someone overtaken try to
[1:26:35] restore them in the spirit of meekness
[1:26:37] now one who is spiritual look at verse
[1:26:40] one ye which are spiritual now spiritual
[1:26:42] means one who's filled or governed by
[1:26:45] the spirit of God Amen so don't send
[1:26:47] somebody who don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:49] send somebody who's got the Holy Ghost
[1:26:51] amen we're going to try to wi somebody
[1:26:52] back to the Lord send somebody who's
[1:26:54] born
[1:26:55] again yes somebody who's spiritual
[1:26:57] they're filled with the Holy Spirit and
[1:27:00] what are they doing then then they're
[1:27:01] Meek then they're gentle then they're
[1:27:03] longsuffering right like all those
[1:27:05] fruits said if they're filled and
[1:27:07] they're producing those
[1:27:10] fruits so you can't send a carnal person
[1:27:12] you got to send a spiritual person now
[1:27:14] restore means to repair or put in order
[1:27:18] how many you ever seen somebody's life
[1:27:19] out of order if you see their life is
[1:27:22] out of order it's not found the order of
[1:27:24] the word someone spiritual is supposed
[1:27:26] to go correct them notice he didn't say
[1:27:28] the pastor every time praise the Lord
[1:27:31] Brother that's why brother brother says
[1:27:32] that that's why I said it say said don't
[1:27:35] make your pastor do it every time you go
[1:27:38] to that person if they're out of
[1:27:42] order now don't get me wrong everybody
[1:27:44] expects the pastor to do it and I do do
[1:27:45] it sometimes when I need
[1:27:48] to but it's for everybody anyone who's
[1:27:50] spiritual can go to try to help somebody
[1:27:52] get back in order with the word I still
[1:27:55] email people that left the the message
[1:27:57] in our church I just added some names to
[1:27:59] that list because if I love them I'm GNA
[1:28:02] email every month I do I do it every
[1:28:03] month I ask them to come back to the
[1:28:04] church and come back to the word if I
[1:28:06] did anything wrong come ask me or come
[1:28:08] let me know about it I'll repent because
[1:28:10] the real Shepherd goes after the Sheep
[1:28:12] amen praise God I keep begging if I had
[1:28:16] their numbers I might call them I don't
[1:28:17] have their
[1:28:19] numbers now I might get to the spot
[1:28:21] where annoying and I told him I said if
[1:28:23] you don't want these anymore let me know
[1:28:24] they never email me back saying no if
[1:28:27] they would I would stop but if they
[1:28:29] don't stop I'm gonna keep going because
[1:28:32] who knows because remember remember I
[1:28:33] told you that testimony we had a
[1:28:34] preacher who left the message a few
[1:28:35] years
[1:28:36] ago and I called them I kept trying to
[1:28:39] call them my brother kept trying to call
[1:28:41] remember that
[1:28:42] I
[1:28:44] sorry anyways wouldn't hear wouldn't
[1:28:46] return the call wouldn't return the call
[1:28:48] all of a sudden Simon put something on
[1:28:49] Facebook about a revival going on in
[1:28:51] Napoleon where cam brother Cam's
[1:28:53] churches and the brother got so
[1:28:54] convicted by the Holy Spirit he repented
[1:28:56] of his backsliding after three years of
[1:28:58] not contacting anybody came back and the
[1:29:00] first thing he told me he said I want to
[1:29:02] thank you for leaving voicemails on my
[1:29:04] phone and ever since I heard that
[1:29:06] brother Enoch I'm always going to email
[1:29:07] call people
[1:29:09] religiously until they come back if they
[1:29:11] can come back amen because all the
[1:29:13] fathers give me will come to me praise
[1:29:15] God Amen and now he's back in the face
[1:29:19] faith walking in the faith living a Pure
[1:29:21] Life
[1:29:23] sometimes people just struggle church
[1:29:25] and we got to be patient so you who are
[1:29:28] spiritual any spiritual people out there
[1:29:30] we only got a few
[1:29:31] tonight I trust you are I trust you're
[1:29:34] filled with the Holy Ghost sisters you
[1:29:35] can go after people right just you're
[1:29:38] not preaching but you're going back
[1:29:40] persuading and
[1:29:42] testifying
[1:29:45] amen so you want somebody to take the
[1:29:47] word you got to get a preacher preachers
[1:29:49] handle the word but sisters can go back
[1:29:51] and pray pray and and testify and try to
[1:29:53] be alive right sisters that's right
[1:29:56] that's
[1:29:57] amen so send someone who's spiritual
[1:30:00] restore put one back in order with the
[1:30:02] spirit of meekness now meekness remember
[1:30:05] we just read over that meekness is
[1:30:07] gentleness or mildness you got to be
[1:30:09] mild with people that leave the
[1:30:11] message have you ever seen anybody walk
[1:30:13] up to somebody and ball them out and say
[1:30:15] how could you leave the message how
[1:30:17] could you leave Christ you ought to come
[1:30:18] back and then they come back you ever
[1:30:20] seen that I've never seen that it might
[1:30:23] happen but the Bible says use what
[1:30:25] mildness
[1:30:27] meekness now if people want to ball them
[1:30:29] out that's up to them but for me if I'm
[1:30:32] not a prophet I'm GNA stay with this
[1:30:34] right here right and I've seen this I've
[1:30:38] seen people restored by meekness like I
[1:30:41] just told you I've seen people fall away
[1:30:43] and just meekly tell them you pray for
[1:30:45] them tell you love them contact them
[1:30:47] every now and then and they'll come back
[1:30:48] if it's God's will for them to come back
[1:30:51] either way guess what you're your
[1:30:52] brother's keeper aren't you amen praise
[1:30:56] God now he said be be meek because of
[1:30:59] this consider yourself lest you be
[1:31:01] tempted so see if you don't go mildly
[1:31:03] and you go hot or you go whatever you
[1:31:06] might get tempted right you might go too
[1:31:08] much into the flesh so you got to have
[1:31:11] what self-control
[1:31:13] amen amen all right that's verse one
[1:31:16] praise the
[1:31:20] Lord so Paul says to this church of
[1:31:23] legalist he said there's some of you
[1:31:25] that have fallen away so those of you
[1:31:27] who are filled with the spirit go try to
[1:31:29] draw back with
[1:31:32] meekness use meekness use mildness here
[1:31:36] all right now ver pardon me verse Two
[1:31:38] Bear ye one another's burdens and so
[1:31:41] fulfill the law of Christ now look at
[1:31:42] that when someone's backsliding it's a
[1:31:44] burden that's on them and we've got to
[1:31:47] go bear it they got some burden they
[1:31:50] just can't handle so it's keep keeping
[1:31:51] them it's so heavy it's keeping them
[1:31:53] from
[1:31:53] church right it's keeping them from
[1:31:56] fellowship it's keeping them from the
[1:31:58] word they have such a heavy burden a
[1:32:00] spiritual burden probably just carrying
[1:32:02] this burden around it's probably maybe
[1:32:04] it's depression maybe it's lust who
[1:32:07] knows what the burden is but it's a
[1:32:09] burden and you've got to be able to bear
[1:32:11] that burden and help them get over that
[1:32:15] burden and when you do that you fulfill
[1:32:17] the law of who
[1:32:19] Christ so obviously Christ must have
[1:32:22] come and bore someone's burdens I think
[1:32:25] he did it on Calvary glory amen I think
[1:32:28] he carried up calvary's hill amen are
[1:32:30] you with me Church carried all of our
[1:32:32] burdens he carried our sins right he
[1:32:35] carried them up the hill carried them
[1:32:37] for our burdens and then took our
[1:32:39] burdens amen hallelujah and that's your
[1:32:43] way your way to Bear someone's burden is
[1:32:45] to come by and try to talk them back
[1:32:47] into the
[1:32:49] faith praise the Lord
[1:32:53] raise your hand if you could who knows
[1:32:54] somebody who's Fallen away from the
[1:32:56] message is anybody can anybody raise
[1:32:58] your hand all right good hands up now
[1:33:02] ask yourself I'm not going to ask you
[1:33:03] raise your hands down but ask yourself
[1:33:04] if you ever thought you might be led to
[1:33:06] go after
[1:33:08] them think about that because that's
[1:33:11] what the law of Christ
[1:33:13] is praise the Lord not the law of Bri of
[1:33:16] Christ Fellowship or Bible Believers the
[1:33:19] law of Christ it's the see someone who's
[1:33:22] got a burden they just can't handle it
[1:33:25] and go to them and try to put them back
[1:33:26] in
[1:33:28] order let's think long and hard on
[1:33:31] that because eternal life is living for
[1:33:34] others Paul tells the legalistic church
[1:33:37] get your now look think about this get
[1:33:39] your mind off your fleshly circumstan
[1:33:40] get your mind off your calendar I got to
[1:33:42] keep this day I got to keep that day and
[1:33:44] get your mind on restoring people back
[1:33:46] to the
[1:33:47] faith what a what a statement to tell a
[1:33:49] bunch of legalists get your mind off
[1:33:51] your your calar and get your mind off
[1:33:53] your flesh get your mind on bringing
[1:33:55] people back to the faith God help me God
[1:33:57] help all of us praise the Lord that's
[1:34:00] the word of God Church word of
[1:34:04] God verse three for if a man think
[1:34:08] himself to be something when he's
[1:34:09] nothing he deceives
[1:34:13] himself see if we think we're something
[1:34:15] we think we're we're too good for them
[1:34:17] they fell away we're too good for them
[1:34:18] we're not going to go after them right
[1:34:23] I think I'm something and really we're
[1:34:25] nothing if we're not interested in
[1:34:27] helping other people who Fall
[1:34:30] Away praise
[1:34:33] God remember when the Sheep go after the
[1:34:35] one that left or the shepherd went after
[1:34:37] the one sheep that left sorry the 99 who
[1:34:40] thought they're righteous he left there
[1:34:41] he went to go after the one that was
[1:34:44] lost and that was you amen Jesus went
[1:34:48] after you Jesus came after me praise the
[1:34:50] Lord amen I hope you're thinking about
[1:34:52] people that you can talk to but you
[1:34:55] better be
[1:34:57] spiritual better know where you stand
[1:35:00] you better pray you better be
[1:35:03] mild I've experienced that the last six
[1:35:06] months pretty good and I imagine it's
[1:35:09] going to keep going as time goes on we
[1:35:12] be real spiritual brother amen but you
[1:35:14] not a real spiritual belt Titan belt of
[1:35:17] Truth and hel of Salvation oh my sword
[1:35:20] of the spirit I'd be real mild to
[1:35:22] restore people back to the
[1:35:24] faith you know I saw somebody recently
[1:35:26] that left the message and they come
[1:35:28] right out of their car and hug me I
[1:35:29] about fell over I was so
[1:35:32] shocked I thought hey thank you sir so I
[1:35:34] went hugg them real hard too you
[1:35:37] know and uh I like that praise the Lord
[1:35:40] I like that I'm hoping they're missing
[1:35:44] me I believe it because if we're salty
[1:35:47] they got to be thirsty yeah if we got
[1:35:49] real Salt unless they you know unless
[1:35:51] they're unless someone goes past the
[1:35:53] line of Mercy judgment they got to be
[1:35:55] thirsty for some God help us be
[1:35:59] thirsty all right verse four now look at
[1:36:01] this so he tells them you got to go
[1:36:03] after the the Fallen go after those who
[1:36:05] are Fallen away don't worry about your
[1:36:07] flesh don't worry about all these right
[1:36:08] self-righteousness don't worry about
[1:36:10] calendar dates and all these things
[1:36:11] worry about people that have fallen
[1:36:15] away but let every man prove his own
[1:36:17] work and then shall he have rejoicing in
[1:36:19] himself alone and not in
[1:36:22] another okay so now Paul's looking into
[1:36:25] their
[1:36:26] works okay you must have the right works
[1:36:29] in your life you must be doing what
[1:36:30] you're supposed to be doing so faith and
[1:36:33] love will cause you to go after
[1:36:35] others restore others legalism will
[1:36:38] cause you just to set up camp and just
[1:36:40] make your own religious uh righteousness
[1:36:43] that's where we got to be careful in the
[1:36:44] message that's where every denomination
[1:36:47] failed they got comfortable with what
[1:36:49] they believed and didn't move on and
[1:36:51] didn't follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:36:52] Spirit we've got to follow the
[1:36:54] leadership of the Holy Spirit be
[1:36:56] interested in others but let every man
[1:36:58] prove his work then you have rejoicing
[1:37:00] in yourself alone and not in
[1:37:02] another
[1:37:07] okay for every man shall bear his own
[1:37:09] burden okay now here it gives a two
[1:37:11] burdens you must see others who are
[1:37:13] burdened and Fallen away and then you
[1:37:15] must go minister to them but then
[1:37:17] everybody has their own work Paul says
[1:37:20] so you get there's two burdens in your
[1:37:21] life there's burdens you seeing Oh
[1:37:23] Brother so and so Amen brother amen we
[1:37:25] know this brother he fell away we got a
[1:37:27] burden we got to go bring him back but
[1:37:28] then there's also the burden of am I
[1:37:30] doing what I'm supposed to do so Paul
[1:37:33] not me Paul laid it out there's two
[1:37:35] burdens Glory the burden you have for
[1:37:39] people that fall away and the burden
[1:37:40] that you have to do the will of God for
[1:37:42] your life is that is that okay with
[1:37:45] everybody every man bear your own
[1:37:48] burden okay
[1:37:52] so we are Brother's Keeper can you say
[1:37:54] Amen to that so when we don't see people
[1:37:56] after a while we should say where's
[1:37:58] brother so and so where's sister so and
[1:38:00] so how is he doing how's she doing some
[1:38:03] of you if you haven't contacted some of
[1:38:05] the people that left or uh if you don't
[1:38:07] want someone else who left a long time
[1:38:08] ago you might want to pray about that
[1:38:11] because being your brother Sister's
[1:38:12] Keeper means reaching out to them at
[1:38:14] least I'm not saying L sit and listen to
[1:38:17] them destroy brother brandom or trying
[1:38:20] to do something like that okay or trying
[1:38:22] to talk you out of that I'm just saying
[1:38:23] say
[1:38:25] hi tell them you love them you're
[1:38:28] praying for them that's all I'm
[1:38:31] saying because I've I've heard that I've
[1:38:33] read that too people say well it shows
[1:38:36] they don't have any love in the message
[1:38:37] when people leave the message they never
[1:38:38] go after them so that that could be true
[1:38:40] it could be wrong it kind of depends you
[1:38:42] know it can go either way if God's
[1:38:44] leading us to go after we should go
[1:38:45] after but if God's tell us keep away
[1:38:47] because whatever Spirits are strong that
[1:38:49] could be it too yeah
[1:38:51] but I'm just saying if you've got a
[1:38:53] leading of the Lord that's the law of
[1:38:55] Christ to try to win somebody
[1:38:57] back and be your brother's keep where's
[1:39:00] Brother s he's usually here he hasn't
[1:39:02] been in the church there's some people
[1:39:04] that recently started coming I've been
[1:39:05] texting them almost every day where you
[1:39:07] at how you doing praying for you and
[1:39:09] they still don't come back they don't
[1:39:11] reply to me but guess what I'm GNA Be My
[1:39:12] Brother's Keeper yeah because on that
[1:39:15] day we're going to see who our Brother's
[1:39:17] Keeper was and I want to make sure my
[1:39:18] works are the right works
[1:39:23] all
[1:39:24] right so this is what a prophet would
[1:39:26] tell a church drenched in legalism be
[1:39:29] concerned about other people stop trying
[1:39:31] to make your own self-righteous be
[1:39:33] concerned about other people all quite a
[1:39:36] statement is it quite a statement okay
[1:39:39] we'll try to go on here praise the Lord
[1:39:41] verse uh verse
[1:39:43] six actually you know let's go to Romans
[1:39:45] 15 just a moment can we just this is a
[1:39:47] parallel passage it's the same Prophet
[1:39:49] writing the same thing here in Romans
[1:39:51] 15:1 maybe one of our brothers can read
[1:39:53] this for us here or sister if you like
[1:39:56] or maybe one of my children Romans
[1:39:59] 15:1 there's the same man under the same
[1:40:01] anointing of the Holy Ghost writing
[1:40:03] almost exactly the same
[1:40:05] thing but amen could you read that can
[1:40:07] you read uh 1512 and three brother we
[1:40:11] then that are strong ought to Bear the
[1:40:12] infirmities of the weak and not to
[1:40:15] please ourselves let every one of us
[1:40:17] please his neighbor for his good to
[1:40:19] edification for even Christ pleases not
[1:40:22] himself but as it is written the
[1:40:25] reproaches of them that reproach he fell
[1:40:27] on me amen so Paul gives a scripture
[1:40:30] here of the Old
[1:40:31] Testament when you reach out to the lost
[1:40:34] here your the the reproaches are falling
[1:40:36] on you it's like you're going to
[1:40:38] somebody who's in in sin you're trying
[1:40:40] to help them out and that reproach kind
[1:40:42] of falls on you you gota in other words
[1:40:44] you got to deal with their sin and
[1:40:46] you're around that sin and it kind of
[1:40:48] you're kind of connected to it it makes
[1:40:49] you feel awful doesn't it
[1:40:57] but and look is it how many believe the
[1:41:01] Bible everybody believe the Bible I'm
[1:41:02] about to say something
[1:41:05] here if you're not pleasing or if you're
[1:41:08] pleasing yourself you won't go after
[1:41:10] people many times because you're protect
[1:41:12] you're fine you're just you're thinking
[1:41:14] you're somebody you're not worried about
[1:41:16] other people but what does the Bible say
[1:41:18] not to please yourself when you bear
[1:41:21] someone's bird and go after them and
[1:41:22] pray for them you're not pleasing
[1:41:23] yourself you're not interested in me me
[1:41:25] me or I I I it's
[1:41:28] them everybody see that in verse one
[1:41:30] that's verse one that's plain that's
[1:41:31] straight out of the Bible I don't need
[1:41:33] interpretation that's that's what the
[1:41:35] word
[1:41:36] says when you go after others you're not
[1:41:38] pleasing yourself you're not selfish so
[1:41:40] see selfishness only focuses on me me
[1:41:43] and my this is mine but the spirit of
[1:41:46] Christ focuses on helping others it
[1:41:49] reaches out to others
[1:41:52] okay thank you sir okay let's go back to
[1:41:54] Galatians or yeah five Galatians 6 I'm
[1:41:57] sorry
[1:42:01] Gans this is good tonight I hope you're
[1:42:03] being blessed praise God hope hope God's
[1:42:05] speaking to your heart about maybe
[1:42:06] somebody you can go after but you got to
[1:42:08] be spiritual gota be filled with the
[1:42:10] spirit and Mild you got to be mild and
[1:42:14] meek
[1:42:16] okay now verse six yeah that's
[1:42:19] where
[1:42:21] actually no I'm sorry let's go to verse
[1:42:24] U I'll go back to verse four because I
[1:42:26] got some quotes from Brother Bram said
[1:42:30] here and I want to bring a few
[1:42:32] scriptures in this is quite a statement
[1:42:33] verse four but let every man prove his
[1:42:35] own work and then shall he have
[1:42:36] rejoicing in himself
[1:42:40] alone and not in any and not in another
[1:42:43] now look at that look at that statement
[1:42:47] rejoicing in himself I thought we're
[1:42:50] only supposed to rejoice in Christ
[1:42:51] brother
[1:42:52] Jess there's a balance to this when
[1:42:55] you're rejoicing in yourself listen
[1:42:57] you're rejoicing in the Christ you see
[1:42:59] flowing through you amen you're not
[1:43:02] saying oh my flesh is so wonderful I'm
[1:43:05] such a fantastic person no it's
[1:43:08] rejoicing in the Christ that you see in
[1:43:11] you look at brother Revelation 4 1961 oh
[1:43:15] praise be to God I guess it's
[1:43:16] appropriate for a minister to worship
[1:43:18] God from the pulpit with Thanksgiving
[1:43:20] and praise and honor my oh how real how
[1:43:22] it just Thrills my soul till I feel like
[1:43:25] I could scream and Run and Jump as high
[1:43:26] as I could because there's something in
[1:43:28] me that's changed me from what I was
[1:43:31] amen amen that's rejoicing in yourself
[1:43:34] amen thank God I'm not what I used to be
[1:43:37] praise God I'm not what I want to be but
[1:43:38] I'm not what I used to be that's
[1:43:40] rejoicing and thanking God in
[1:43:44] yourself you never see that I'm not what
[1:43:47] I ought to be not what I want to be but
[1:43:49] I know I've been changed from what I
[1:43:50] used used to be something has happened
[1:43:52] something has taken
[1:43:54] place
[1:43:56] Hallelujah so we we we can Rejoice here
[1:43:59] the Bible said after you prove your work
[1:44:01] now prove means to examine your work
[1:44:04] listen every one of you are doing a work
[1:44:05] for the Lord you're doing a work for the
[1:44:07] Lord in your family witnessing to them
[1:44:09] you're do to work for the Lord in your
[1:44:10] job you're do to work for the Lord here
[1:44:12] at the church you must examine what
[1:44:14] works am I doing examine your work Paul
[1:44:17] said prove your own work prove and work
[1:44:18] means business prove your business
[1:44:21] so your conscience is clear and you're
[1:44:23] do doing the work that God gave us to do
[1:44:25] well brother Jess I just sit in the
[1:44:26] chair no you don't you do more than that
[1:44:29] you're receiving the Eternal words of
[1:44:30] life
[1:44:31] amen you're helping the Holy Spirit to
[1:44:34] operate in the local church by pulling
[1:44:35] on the gift and other people get blessed
[1:44:37] because you're pulling on the spirit
[1:44:39] amen you everybody plays a part in here
[1:44:42] praise the Lord everybody that's a work
[1:44:45] amen it's a lot easier can disagree with
[1:44:49] me if you want but I believe you agree
[1:44:52] it's a lot easier to sit there and just
[1:44:53] say okay come on get through this sermon
[1:44:56] it's a lot easier to sit back and relax
[1:44:57] and and be uh and not have an active
[1:45:00] part in the service but it takes a
[1:45:02] pressing through it takes a sacrifice it
[1:45:05] takes a left for God to get into the
[1:45:06] spirit of the service and get something
[1:45:08] out of it can anybody agree with me on
[1:45:10] that it's easy to sit back and say uhhuh
[1:45:12] uhhuh uhhuh uhuh but it takes the real
[1:45:14] spirit of God the love of God to pull
[1:45:17] something out of God Amen and that way
[1:45:20] people get blessed and when they leave
[1:45:21] here they're closer to God Amen that's a
[1:45:23] work that's not easy that's a work
[1:45:26] amen that's a work that you and I have
[1:45:28] that we all should
[1:45:31] do Glory we've had such polers in here
[1:45:34] lately and it don't matter how loud you
[1:45:36] are we've had such polers in here lately
[1:45:38] I've had people tell me the all we
[1:45:40] talking about on the way to church you
[1:45:43] preached on I got an email the other day
[1:45:45] I said uh on Saturday last Saturday
[1:45:49] certain people were talking about
[1:45:50] certain things and I come and preach it
[1:45:52] on Sunday morning exactly what they were
[1:45:54] talking
[1:45:56] about so see I can't base it upon how
[1:45:58] loud it is or if people are shouting or
[1:46:00] crying or smiling or whatever more I got
[1:46:03] to just preach what the word says and be
[1:46:04] led by the spirit but if you're pulling
[1:46:06] you're G to get something from God God
[1:46:08] you think God's Gonna invite somebody to
[1:46:10] eat at his table and not bring them good
[1:46:12] food it's our attitude to the food if we
[1:46:15] have the right attitude God will serve
[1:46:16] us some great things praise the Lord but
[1:46:19] it's got to be our attit itude amen it's
[1:46:22] your approach to God brother says the
[1:46:23] Bible says that it's your approach to
[1:46:25] Christ amen that brings the results
[1:46:28] hallelujah it's important you have a
[1:46:31] work it's not just sitting in a chair
[1:46:33] it's communicating with God while
[1:46:34] they're preaching going yes Lord help
[1:46:36] the church bless those help me speak to
[1:46:38] me guide me I want to hear more of your
[1:46:40] word I want to receive your promises
[1:46:43] that's a work of
[1:46:45] God Amen to that see brother's rejoicing
[1:46:50] in
[1:46:51] I'm see I'm changed I'm not what I used
[1:46:52] to
[1:46:53] be I'm not what I want to be but thank
[1:46:56] God I'm not what I used to be okay now
[1:47:00] every man's work will be manifested one
[1:47:02] day the Bible said that every man should
[1:47:03] bear his own
[1:47:05] burden and uh let's go to that let's go
[1:47:08] to 1 Corinthians
[1:47:11] 3 you you and I will receive a reward
[1:47:13] according to our labor that's what I'm
[1:47:15] saying if you labor hard sisters or
[1:47:17] brothers in church and you're not a
[1:47:18] preacher but you labor hard to pull on
[1:47:20] the word word God will reward you for
[1:47:21] that because that's what you're called
[1:47:23] to
[1:47:24] do and I'm called to preach if I
[1:47:26] Faithfully preach and labor and preach
[1:47:28] and try to pray study the Bible but R
[1:47:30] said a pastor's not supposed to tell you
[1:47:32] what's not in the Bible he's supposed to
[1:47:33] tell you what's in the Bible I thought
[1:47:36] what a good job because I don't have
[1:47:37] anything outside the Bible that's the
[1:47:39] perfect job for me
[1:47:41] amen it's the speakers in tongues and
[1:47:43] the prophesy and the word of wisdom and
[1:47:45] knowledge they're the ones that're
[1:47:47] supposed to get anointed to tell you
[1:47:48] things outside the word I'm supposed to
[1:47:50] tell you what's in the
[1:47:52] word thank you Jesus amen 1 Corinthians
[1:47:55] 3 Oh Glory well we're finally feeling
[1:47:58] good tonight amen thank you Jesus First
[1:48:01] Corinthians
[1:48:02] 3 got to press through and labor tonight
[1:48:04] amen all right verse five 35 who then is
[1:48:09] Paul and who is Apollos but but
[1:48:10] ministers by whom you believed even as
[1:48:12] the lord gave to every man I have
[1:48:14] planted poish water but God gave the
[1:48:16] increase can any man give any increase
[1:48:17] in your life no so don't give any glory
[1:48:19] to any man
[1:48:21] they can just plant in water but they
[1:48:23] can't make it grow who makes it grow God
[1:48:27] that's the next verse so then neither is
[1:48:30] he that planteth anything neither he
[1:48:31] that WTH but God that gives the increase
[1:48:36] amen praise God we got to be careful not
[1:48:39] to exalt certain preachers right or
[1:48:41] certain people in our lives if they got
[1:48:43] gifts whatever not to exalt them they're
[1:48:45] just instruments God's the one who give
[1:48:47] us an area of growth God's the one that
[1:48:49] will make our spirit spiritual life grow
[1:48:51] again if it's dead he gives the
[1:48:54] increase now look at verse eight now he
[1:48:57] that planted and he that WTH are one so
[1:48:59] see all those preatures we're all one
[1:49:01] we're not divided we're all one and
[1:49:04] every man shall receive his own reward
[1:49:05] according to his own labor so however
[1:49:08] much you work however much you labor
[1:49:09] that's how much reward you get for we
[1:49:12] are laborers together with God see we
[1:49:14] work with God we work with the Holy
[1:49:15] Spirit you're are God's husbandry we you
[1:49:17] are God's Building according to the
[1:49:19] grace of God which is given to me as a
[1:49:21] wise master builder look he's a wise
[1:49:22] master builder he's so wise Peter said I
[1:49:24] don't understand him all the
[1:49:26] time I've laid the foundation another
[1:49:28] man build it there on that every man
[1:49:30] take heed how he build it there upon
[1:49:32] that's why I try to build everything
[1:49:33] upon the word of God this is the word
[1:49:35] this the word this the
[1:49:37] word that's right verse 11 for other
[1:49:41] Foundation can no man lay than that is
[1:49:43] laid which is Jesus Christ so Jesus
[1:49:44] Christ is the Cornerstone the very
[1:49:46] Cornerstone of the foundation now if any
[1:49:48] man build upon this Foundation gold
[1:49:50] silver precious stones wood hay double
[1:49:52] every man's work shall be made manifest
[1:49:55] look God's going to show all these
[1:49:57] preachers God's going to show all of us
[1:49:59] what we're made of God's going to reveal
[1:50:01] what everybody what everybody's work
[1:50:03] really is and I want my work to be find
[1:50:05] be found in humility and Holiness and
[1:50:08] godliness and
[1:50:09] sincerity that's why the numbers don't
[1:50:11] move me on Wednesday night I can preach
[1:50:12] to one two three four five adults and I
[1:50:15] don't care because I preached less than
[1:50:17] that before because you know what I know
[1:50:20] you might be watching me but I know
[1:50:21] somebody else is watching
[1:50:23] me he's watching me yes he'll judge
[1:50:26] every one of my Works he'll judge all my
[1:50:28] labors he's watching I'm not that
[1:50:30] picture but you know what I'm talking
[1:50:31] about the holy spirit's watching me and
[1:50:34] at the end of the day I got to go home I
[1:50:36] got say Lord was I faithful I believe I
[1:50:38] was faithful my heart's right before you
[1:50:39] I tried to stay with the word and I'll
[1:50:41] be rewarded or judged based upon how I
[1:50:45] did I want to build the right things
[1:50:48] okay every man's work shall be made
[1:50:50] manifest for the day shall declare
[1:50:52] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[1:50:55] the fire shall try every man's work of
[1:50:57] what sort it is every man is Tried by
[1:50:58] fire so the trials you go through is the
[1:51:01] fire that you got to go through and it
[1:51:03] will try the ministry it'll try uh the
[1:51:06] gift in your life trials try you they're
[1:51:10] fire that's right so we know we've had
[1:51:14] we've had pretty good honeymoon time
[1:51:15] here at the church you know right every
[1:51:17] church has it but guess what there's
[1:51:19] fire coming yeah you've had a good honey
[1:51:22] anyone have a good honeymoon or Mountain
[1:51:23] toop experience lately guess what you've
[1:51:25] been all been on the mountain top for a
[1:51:26] few years guess what here comes a fiery
[1:51:28] trial coming pretty soon it's going to
[1:51:30] try and see what you're made out
[1:51:34] of yes if any man's work abide which
[1:51:38] Heath built upon he shall receive a
[1:51:40] reward see if your Works hold up to that
[1:51:43] fire and they remain your faith remains
[1:51:45] strong you'll get a reward if any man's
[1:51:48] work should be burned he shall suffer
[1:51:49] were lost but he himself should be saved
[1:51:51] yet so as by fire all right a statement
[1:51:55] there know ye not that ye are the temple
[1:51:57] of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:51:58] you if any man defile the temple of God
[1:52:00] him shall God destroy for the temple of
[1:52:02] God is Holy which Temple ye are okay
[1:52:06] pause right there by God's grace how
[1:52:08] many like that by the grace of the Lord
[1:52:10] Every Man's work that means every man
[1:52:12] here not just preachers but every man
[1:52:14] every woman everybody has the work to do
[1:52:17] and we have to answer for our works what
[1:52:19] we did
[1:52:21] yes all right I want to let's go to 1
[1:52:24] Timothy 1 this is another scripture here
[1:52:25] we're good on
[1:52:27] time 1 Timothy 1
[1:52:30] verse2 I want to show you a time where
[1:52:32] Paul rejoices in
[1:52:35] himself I know it sounds really hard to
[1:52:37] say that but um if you understand it
[1:52:40] you're really thanking God for what you
[1:52:41] see God doing in your life and I'm going
[1:52:44] to show you the opposite of
[1:52:46] it and then we'll probably stop in just
[1:52:49] a little bit here
[1:52:50] okay 1 Timothy 1:12
[1:52:53] to16 Mal are you there buddy are you
[1:52:57] there 1 Timothy
[1:52:59] 1:12 can you read that 12-
[1:53:03] 16 and that than Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:53:06] who has enabled me but that he counted
[1:53:09] me faithful putting me into the ministry
[1:53:12] who was before blasphemer and a
[1:53:14] persecutor and urious but I obtained
[1:53:18] Mercy because I did
[1:53:20] in unbelief and the grace of our Lord
[1:53:23] was exceed abundant with faith and love
[1:53:25] which is in Christ Jesus this is a
[1:53:28] faithful saying and worthy of all
[1:53:31] acceptation that Christ Jesus came into
[1:53:34] the world to save Sinners of whom I am
[1:53:36] chief how be it for this cause I obtain
[1:53:39] Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ
[1:53:43] might show forth all on suffering for
[1:53:46] pattern to them which should Hereafter
[1:53:48] believe on him to life everas amen thank
[1:53:52] you buddy appreciate that here is Paul
[1:53:54] thanking God for what that God has
[1:53:56] strengthened me and put me in the
[1:53:58] ministry so see don't don't get it
[1:54:00] confused if I if somebody comes up here
[1:54:01] and says I want to thank the Lord for
[1:54:03] helping me be a preacher let me sing a
[1:54:05] song special or playing the piano or let
[1:54:07] me we got to make sure it's the right
[1:54:10] kind of
[1:54:11] Glory because Paul said I thank God that
[1:54:14] he strengthened me and put me in the
[1:54:16] ministry because before I was injured
[1:54:20] I was a
[1:54:21] blasphemer and God had mercy upon my
[1:54:24] life so when you say oh I want to thank
[1:54:26] the Lord he's made me what I am today
[1:54:28] because God had mercy on me that's the
[1:54:29] right kind of Thanksgiving that's the
[1:54:31] right kind of rejoicing in in
[1:54:33] yourself because it's really not
[1:54:35] yourself it's the victory God gave you
[1:54:38] over your flesh that's what we're
[1:54:40] talking about and notice he's I'm
[1:54:42] thankful for the grace of the exceeding
[1:54:43] Abundant Faith and love in Christ Jesus
[1:54:46] now notice in verse 16 Paul is a pattern
[1:54:49] how it for this cause I obtain Mercy
[1:54:51] that in me first look at this in me
[1:54:52] first Jesus Christ might show forth all
[1:54:54] longsuffering for a pattern to them
[1:54:56] which should Hereafter believe on him to
[1:54:58] life Everlasting Glory that's awesome
[1:55:02] Amen Paul said I'm the first
[1:55:04] example and God's going to show a
[1:55:06] pattern what's a pattern it repeats you
[1:55:09] ever see AB pattern ab ab ab ab that's
[1:55:12] AB pattern ever seen a ABC pattern ABC
[1:55:15] ABC you ever seen the AABB pattern yeah
[1:55:18] that's first grade that okay but Paul
[1:55:22] said I'm the pattern so see Paul's
[1:55:24] pattern was this I was lost I was a
[1:55:27] blasphemer I hated Jesus but now I love
[1:55:30] him that's the pattern of all those who
[1:55:33] come after amen so if you hated the word
[1:55:35] or hated that before you're not alone
[1:55:37] that's the right pattern because now you
[1:55:39] love him amen the pattern is you despise
[1:55:41] it you don't love the word and now you
[1:55:43] love it that's the right AB pattern amen
[1:55:46] are you with me church he said I am the
[1:55:49] first of a
[1:55:50] pattern I fought the message I hated the
[1:55:53] message I hated the word and now I love
[1:55:55] it and now I labor for it and now God's
[1:55:57] G me strength to obey it that's glory in
[1:56:00] yourself amen thank you
[1:56:03] Jesus so it's it's wonderful to thank
[1:56:06] God for your overcoming your past life
[1:56:09] now let's look at the prideful part go
[1:56:11] to Luke 18 we're going to close this
[1:56:12] with my last scripture we're going to
[1:56:15] stop right there I'm even going to put
[1:56:16] stoping place right there in my notes so
[1:56:18] we'll just stop right there
[1:56:20] give you my word by the grace of the
[1:56:22] Lord trust you've enjoyed the word here
[1:56:24] tonight amen came out different than I
[1:56:26] thought you know as I study and pray I
[1:56:27] just put it down there and then holy
[1:56:29] Springs Holy Spirit brings it out a
[1:56:30] different way and I thought it would
[1:56:31] come amen Luke 18 verse
[1:56:35] 9 so we want to be thankful in ourselves
[1:56:38] in a humble way seeing the strength of
[1:56:41] God change our lives not in a prideful
[1:56:44] way so this is a beautiful example of
[1:56:47] someone who's humble and then someone
[1:56:49] who is thanking God in themselves in a
[1:56:51] prideful way there is a
[1:56:54] difference there is a great
[1:56:57] difference okay let's read this here by
[1:57:00] God's grace okay I'll read it Luke
[1:57:04] 889 and he spake this Parable unto
[1:57:06] certain which trusted in themselves that
[1:57:09] they were righteous and despised
[1:57:12] others let's just stop right there we
[1:57:15] know what's going to happen here right a
[1:57:16] Pharisee so a Pharisee is trusting in
[1:57:19] own righteousness and he's despising
[1:57:22] other we'll say it like this message
[1:57:26] Believers
[1:57:28] right because he's going to walk into
[1:57:30] the church he's going to go into the
[1:57:31] court of the men in the temple of Herod
[1:57:34] it's past the court of Gentiles past the
[1:57:36] court of women actually the court of
[1:57:37] women was the second level in the court
[1:57:39] of Herod they couldn't go down to the
[1:57:41] floor because this was for the court of
[1:57:42] men we're going to show that when we get
[1:57:43] to
[1:57:44] Ephesians but here's these men here in
[1:57:46] the they're in the the court of the men
[1:57:48] the Jewish men
[1:57:50] there's a Pharisee and there's a sinner
[1:57:52] but listen they're both
[1:57:54] Sinners right our flesh is all
[1:57:58] Sinners and he felt he was righteous and
[1:58:01] he despised other people in the
[1:58:03] church be careful God help us to love
[1:58:06] everybody in the
[1:58:07] church verse eight verse 10 two men went
[1:58:10] up into the temple to pray the one a
[1:58:12] Pharisee and the other a
[1:58:14] Publican Publican was in the I'm sorry
[1:58:17] Pharisees was in the religious realm
[1:58:18] Publican was in the Public Service realm
[1:58:21] a public service job something like a
[1:58:23] tax collector something along those type
[1:58:25] of jobs thater public serving the public
[1:58:28] verse 8 verse 11 chapter 18 verse 11 now
[1:58:32] the Pharisees stood and prayed within
[1:58:34] himself God I thank thee we just stop
[1:58:37] right there well so far he's got a good
[1:58:40] prayer God I thank you sounds pretty
[1:58:43] good so
[1:58:45] far but the rest of his words show
[1:58:49] what's really in his
[1:58:50] heart I thank you Jesus in other words
[1:58:53] we say today I thank you Lord that I am
[1:58:55] not as other men
[1:58:58] are thank you Lord I'm not like brother
[1:59:00] so and so thank you Lord I'm not like
[1:59:03] sister so and
[1:59:04] so extortioners unjust adulterers or
[1:59:08] even as this Publican over here look at
[1:59:11] this man he's so
[1:59:13] critical he knows this Publican
[1:59:15] struggling he can see he's struggling he
[1:59:16] knows adulterers are struggling and he
[1:59:18] says oh I thank you Lord that I'm not
[1:59:20] like these vile
[1:59:23] people that's different than what Paul
[1:59:25] said what did Paul say I thank you Lord
[1:59:28] that I'm not like
[1:59:30] Paul amen you be church amen the
[1:59:34] Pharisees saying I'm thankful I'm not
[1:59:36] like them Paul said I'm thankful I'm not
[1:59:38] like I used to be yeah see that where's
[1:59:41] the righteous see he the Pharisees
[1:59:43] getting righteous by comparing himself
[1:59:45] to somebody else Paul's getting his
[1:59:47] righteous by comparing himself to Christ
[1:59:50] amen Christ took away my blasphemy
[1:59:52] Christ took away my sins injures Oh by
[1:59:57] Blas and he took away all that see how
[2:00:00] the see how they're both thankful but
[2:00:02] they're thankful for different things
[2:00:04] and they're thankful about and they're
[2:00:05] comparing themselves to different things
[2:00:08] they're both thankful they both come to
[2:00:10] church and say I thank the Lord tonight
[2:00:12] sister H amen I thank the Lord tonight
[2:00:14] sister Priscilla I surely thank the Lord
[2:00:16] tonight but what' you thank him
[2:00:18] for
[2:00:19] you thank him for not being like other
[2:00:21] people or did you thank him for saving
[2:00:24] you from yourself that's the right kind
[2:00:26] of
[2:00:27] thankfulness that's how a person glories
[2:00:30] in themselves the right way Lord I thank
[2:00:34] you I'm not like I used to be thank you
[2:00:36] for giving me the strength to overcome
[2:00:38] my
[2:00:39] errors now look at verse 12 he starts
[2:00:41] listing off his legalistic righteous
[2:00:44] duties I don't commit adultery I fast
[2:00:47] twice a week I give tith of everything I
[2:00:50] possess it's good to pay ties but it's
[2:00:52] bad to be prideful about it well I pay
[2:00:55] more ties than brother so and so I pay
[2:00:57] more ties than sister so and so that's
[2:01:00] sin that's
[2:01:04] pride and the Publican standing a far
[2:01:06] off look this Pharisee when he go over
[2:01:08] he's such a sinner he's such a evil man
[2:01:11] he's so holy I'm so much better than all
[2:01:13] these people at the church and the
[2:01:15] Publican standing a far off would not so
[2:01:17] much as as it lift up his eyes unto
[2:01:20] heaven so now we can see how this
[2:01:22] Pharisees praying he's like he's like oh
[2:01:24] thank you Lord thank you Lord I'm not
[2:01:27] like these oh thank you Lord I'm better
[2:01:29] than all these
[2:01:30] people but the humble the real humble
[2:01:33] person the one who's really in touch
[2:01:34] with God has got his face hidden from
[2:01:36] everybody praying in silence praying in
[2:01:39] in humility bowing Before the Throne of
[2:01:46] God standing AAR would not so much as
[2:01:48] lift his eyes into heaven was smoted
[2:01:50] upon his breast the pain was look look
[2:01:53] Church the pain was so sharp about his
[2:01:55] sins that he had to hit himself why do
[2:01:57] you keep doing this why do you keep
[2:01:59] falling short of the glory of God look
[2:02:01] how much uh pain sin caused him he would
[2:02:05] hit himself and say how can I do this
[2:02:08] again he smokes his breast saying God be
[2:02:12] merciful to me a
[2:02:15] sinner so one thanking God thank God
[2:02:18] I've got all these holy things have done
[2:02:20] my life and I'm not like everybody else
[2:02:21] in the church so much
[2:02:24] better another one saying God just be
[2:02:26] merciful to me I failed you this week
[2:02:30] and what does Jesus say I tell you this
[2:02:32] man went down to his house
[2:02:35] Justified Justified means what declared
[2:02:39] righteous so the one who said I am a
[2:02:42] sinner be merciful god will make that
[2:02:45] person righteous but the person that
[2:02:47] says well look at All I Do Lord I'm I'm
[2:02:49] so glad I'm not like brother so and so
[2:02:50] or sister so and so that person leaves
[2:02:53] still in unrighteousness they're not
[2:02:56] justified for everyone that exalts
[2:02:58] himself shall be abased and he that
[2:02:59] humble himself shall be exalted let's
[2:03:01] stand to our feet praise
[2:03:04] God thank the Lord for the word of God
[2:03:07] Amen Lord willing we'll pick up at verse
[2:03:10] six next Wednesday or we'll see maybe
[2:03:13] Sunday night by God's
[2:03:15] grace praise
[2:03:17] God
[2:03:21] hallelujah how me love the Lord
[2:03:23] tonight praise God I certainly do I hope
[2:03:27] this was helpful this is what a prophet
[2:03:30] has to bring to people that struggle
[2:03:31] with
[2:03:33] legalism a church is taken you know just
[2:03:35] as a pastor from my view I haven't read
[2:03:37] through all these
[2:03:38] books but if if if and think about it
[2:03:41] you what would you say our church
[2:03:43] struggle just you know don't say it out
[2:03:44] loud but what would our church struggle
[2:03:45] with sexual lust passionate things
[2:03:48] smoking
[2:03:50] drinking
[2:03:52] legalism what would what would we think
[2:03:54] well I don't know everybody's life but
[2:03:58] listen the every Church battles
[2:04:00] something if Satan's not battling you
[2:04:02] then you're not the real
[2:04:04] church right brother M said that is that
[2:04:07] right you're not battling Satan then
[2:04:09] you're not the real Church everybody's
[2:04:12] going to battle so think about which
[2:04:14] which sins we're most susceptible
[2:04:17] to I'll be honest I think in the message
[2:04:19] I think most of us are susceptible to
[2:04:22] legalism trying to earn our way trying
[2:04:25] to feel like we're good enough comparing
[2:04:27] ourself well thank God I'm not like that
[2:04:28] prer thank God I'm better than that
[2:04:30] Pastor I got we I got a batt everybody's
[2:04:33] got a ballot right of course there are
[2:04:36] churches that struggle with these you
[2:04:38] know sexual passions and things like
[2:04:40] that but let's bow our heads tonight by
[2:04:42] God's grace I want to try to talk to the
[2:04:44] Lord a little bit
[2:04:47] here
[2:04:49] sister you just PR that song Thank you
[2:04:51] Lord for saving my soul with the right
[2:04:53] kind of gratitude
[2:04:54] tonight Heavenly Father Lord we love you
[2:04:58] tonight Lord it is so refreshing to me
[2:05:02] to read over these words slowly normally
[2:05:05] Lord I preach from Genesis to Revelation
[2:05:07] and back to Psalms and back to the
[2:05:10] gospels and over to
[2:05:12] Isaiah lot of preachers do that Lord
[2:05:15] that's fine Lord I've felt led to go
[2:05:19] this way Lord it is so wonderful to see
[2:05:21] these things you've spoken tonight Lord
[2:05:24] through your word you promis to speak
[2:05:26] through teachers and pastors and
[2:05:28] evangelists and apostles and Prophets
[2:05:31] you promised to do it we believe you did
[2:05:33] it
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:37] tonight Lord I think about many of the
[2:05:39] major points
[2:05:41] Lord we must fulfill the law of Christ
[2:05:45] and bear someone's burden bear the
[2:05:47] infirmities of of the weak see someone
[2:05:50] who's weak see someone who's struggling
[2:05:52] and go with meekness and a holy ghost
[2:05:55] filled life try to put that back in
[2:06:00] order Lord that's a hard thing to do
[2:06:03] it's easy to say Lord I'll be the first
[2:06:05] ad minute it's easy to preach it's easy
[2:06:06] to say but it's a hard thing to do
[2:06:09] because we got our schedules we got our
[2:06:12] fears Lord many times the fears of our
[2:06:14] flesh come in fears in our minds well
[2:06:17] what do they think of me well they think
[2:06:18] of being judgmental but Lord if we go in
[2:06:20] the spirit of mildness or
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:24] meekness the Bible said we can be
[2:06:26] receive that way we won't be
[2:06:29] tempted to partake in the person's
[2:06:34] sin perhaps Lord
[2:06:36] [Music]
[2:06:37] uh Lord you're helping us Lord to learn
[2:06:40] how to say thank you the right
[2:06:43] way you shouldn't say thank you that I'm
[2:06:45] not like this person to church but thank
[2:06:47] you that I'm not like I used to
[2:06:51] be and Lord These Are Holy Bible words
[2:06:55] these words are thus sayeth the Lord to
[2:06:56] the Christian Lord God they mean
[2:06:59] something to us Lord help us to not take
[2:07:01] it lightly
[2:07:04] Lord I'm going to pray for the people
[2:07:06] Lord as I pray may you Minister Lord God
[2:07:09] if anyone needs repentance Lord if
[2:07:11] anyone needs restoration may you lead us
[2:07:13] to repent lead us to go find someone who
[2:07:16] can be restored Dear God
[2:07:21] [Music]
[2:07:23] Father in heaven we again Ask Lord God
[2:07:25] you take these words may they be planted
[2:07:27] in our hearts and Lord I'll just say
[2:07:29] like this I receive them tonight and I
[2:07:32] believe people in the church receive
[2:07:33] some seeds some promises tonight dear
[2:07:36] God may we water it Lord with Prayer by
[2:07:40] saying Lord you're going to help me
[2:07:41] fulfill the law of Christ you're going
[2:07:43] to help me bring forth the fruit of the
[2:07:45] spirit and I thank you for enabling me
[2:07:48] to do the the work you've called me to

[2:08:08] Lord to live for others

[2:08:13] ourselves like well we don't have time
[2:08:15] for people that fall we don't have time
[2:08:16] for the week Lord we should make time
