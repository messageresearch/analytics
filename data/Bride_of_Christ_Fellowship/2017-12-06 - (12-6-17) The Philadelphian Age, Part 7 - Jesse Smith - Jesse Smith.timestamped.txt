[39:43] Revelation chapter 3 Thank You Malachi
[39:47] he's got some new songs too I just
[39:49] didn't get him up here so that's my
[39:50] fault he's really been practicing by
[39:52] God's grace so I'm gonna appreciate his
[39:55] willingness to step in and serve so
[39:58] while you're turned uh we're gonna do
[39:59] Revelation 3 verse 7 we just like to
[40:01] look at that one verse tonight we're
[40:04] just gonna look at that thought that I
[40:05] mentioned a few weeks ago about the
[40:08] gospel versus the word so we look at
[40:12] that thought tonight by God's grace real
[40:15] beautiful thought I just was really
[40:17] blessed by that thought and then we'll
[40:20] get into a few other things like I said
[40:23] the Deacon requirements and church
[40:25] voting everything like that
[40:28] praise the Lord
[40:30] so this all deals with the open door so
[40:33] we'll look at this here let's read that
[40:35] we'll just read this together by God's
[40:37] grace on three one two three and to the
[40:40] angel of the church in Philadelphia
[40:41] write these things saith he that is holy
[40:44] either that's true either had the key of
[40:48] David either openeth and no man shutteth
[40:50] and shutteth and no man openeth amen
[40:54] let's have one more word of Prayer

[40:58] were grateful for this opportunity to be
[41:00] in your house Lord God thank you for the
[41:02] songs we can sing Lord we worship Your
[41:04] Majesty tonight we remember how powerful
[41:07] you are you're the king of kings lord of
[41:09] lords and father we sing this song Lord
[41:12] what will it be when we can be there
[41:14] with multitudes of angels with
[41:17] multitudes of believers and we crown you
[41:20] Lord of all what will it be like that my
[41:22] father what a wonderful thought that is
[41:25] for us here tonight Lord God we're small
[41:27] in number here but just like Eli she
[41:29] found out or his serving a haze' found
[41:32] out there's more with us angels and
[41:36] there are with the sinners so God we're
[41:38] so grateful Lord Jesus for the heavenly
[41:40] company and for the heavenly
[41:42] family the heavenly support that we have
[41:44] the heavenly hosts that's with us here
[41:46] tonight we're grateful for your mercy
[41:49] love Jesus teach us tonight through thy
[41:51] war and Lord as we look more at this
[41:52] open door and I pray your spirit will be
[41:55] with us in a special way in Jesus
[41:57] Christ's name the church said amen god
[42:00] bless you me and see the praise God
[42:10] alright so Malachi can switch over
[42:12] whenever you're ready by God's grace or
[42:13] Lydia whoever's back there sorry
[42:15] one more announcement here before we
[42:17] start I received some really good
[42:20] instrumental music from brother of on
[42:22] carrion in New York his daughters and
[42:26] some of the sisters in the church there
[42:28] have some beautiful absolutely beautiful
[42:30] instrumental music you've been listening
[42:32] to it at home it's just I mean as soon
[42:34] as we play it just kind of creates this
[42:35] beautiful atmosphere at the home so I
[42:39] have I think I have 10 copies of this
[42:43] one now 15 copies of this one 10 of this
[42:45] one so brother Vaughn said they'll send
[42:46] me some more of this one but I have in
[42:49] my office so if I forget I'm sorry I
[42:52] don't have my office I'm right here so
[42:55] I'm gonna set it right here hope I don't
[42:56] forget to give them to you after service
[42:57] by God's grace but every family an
[43:00] individual can get both you're gonna
[43:02] love them they are just beautiful so and
[43:06] I said can I pay you for mother Ron's
[43:08] like no this is just a Ministry of our
[43:09] church you know he's just a servant of
[43:11] the Lord you know he he's probably I
[43:13] mean imagine the money these costs are
[43:14] professionally made you know probably
[43:16] costs thousands and thousands of dollars
[43:17] but that's the kind of brother he is
[43:19] he's just a real gracious and giving
[43:22] brother and that's just quite a
[43:24] testimony there brother Vaughn so if I
[43:28] forget you know pardon me is that not
[43:32] coming sorry about that
[43:35] let me try it again so I just want to
[43:39] remind you about that by God's grace
[43:40] [Music]
[43:43] okay thank you so we're on the
[43:47] Philadelphia Church H all this were
[43:49] getting married from airwest but this is
[43:51] part 7 and part 47 in the series so
[43:54] we're happy about that we're almost if
[43:55] 50 which is a Jubilee and I guarantee I
[43:58] have a Jubilee when we get to 50 by
[43:59] God's grace whether in my house or here
[44:02] I'm gonna have a Jubilee because God is
[44:04] so good to us and we're very thankful we
[44:07] read our text here now we'll just look
[44:08] at our summary tonight well the Braja
[44:11] brother Adam summarized this portion of
[44:13] Scripture and I'm gonna just turn there
[44:15] real briefly we look a little bit more
[44:17] at the open door like I said I'd
[44:19] probably take half the sermon I'll just
[44:21] set my timer for an hour I'll probably
[44:23] take half the sermon look at the open
[44:25] door and I'll take the other half to
[44:27] look at deacon requirements by the grace
[44:30] of God
[44:30] how many do that brother branham said
[44:32] the deacon office is more strict than
[44:34] any other office in the church how many
[44:36] knew that the deacon office is more
[44:39] strict than the pastor that's what
[44:41] brother Brahim says so brother Adams
[44:43] looking to be a deacon and I'm I'm
[44:45] already a deacon so I've got the
[44:47] strictest office plus other offices so I
[44:50] got to make sure out real strict with
[44:51] that office and you'll see why you know
[44:53] in the scripture you'll see why it's
[44:56] because he's guarding the word he's got
[44:59] to guard the word anyways we'll get to
[45:02] that so let's look at the summary
[45:03] brother Graham says now this is the age
[45:05] the Philadelphia church age is the age
[45:06] of brotherly love the great missionary
[45:09] age of the open door and the reward was
[45:12] a pillar being made a pillar and the
[45:15] revelation of three names the name of
[45:17] God aren't you glad you know the name of
[45:19] God today Lord Jesus Christ the name of
[45:23] the City of God New Jerusalem and God's
[45:25] new name which brother Graham tells us
[45:27] we won't know until the new heavens the
[45:30] new earth when he reveals his new name
[45:32] people like the guest today and say it's
[45:34] William Mary and Branham or Branham
[45:36] Christ and all this false doctrine it's
[45:38] just awful
[45:40] but brother Graham tells us it won't be
[45:42] revealed until the future home so I'm
[45:45] willing to wait if you are
[45:46] Amen I don't want to inject anything
[45:47] into God's plan I'll just wait until God
[45:50] reveals it praise God and brother have
[45:54] said is the revelation that was given to
[45:56] this church so I want to bring out now
[45:58] some quotes I mentioned it about two N's
[46:00] days ago brother Ram said there's
[46:03] missionaries with the gospel of paper
[46:05] and tonight I've got the gospel of paper
[46:08] tonight
[46:09] we have these tracks out there this is
[46:12] the gospel of paper passing out tracts
[46:15] here but I have nothing here this is the
[46:18] gospel of paper and the missionary age
[46:21] the Philadelphia church age was big on
[46:24] this just like many people are today
[46:27] brother Graham is gonna say over and
[46:29] over as we go through these quotes he
[46:31] said nothing against this nothing
[46:32] against passing tracts that's part of
[46:36] he's that's part of the gospel you have
[46:38] to have the gospel in the word form he
[46:40] calls this the word form where he says
[46:42] the gospel on paper you've got to have
[46:45] Bibles how many appreciate your Bible I
[46:47] do right in fact the age where they
[46:50] didn't have any Bibles was the darkest
[46:53] church in time to know that Thyatira it
[46:56] was the darkest church age because they
[46:57] didn't have the gospel on paper so you
[46:59] and I should say Amen that we've got the
[47:00] gospel on paper because now we can check
[47:03] is that preacher tell me the truth
[47:05] or do I need to bring correction now you
[47:08] can no but see they it's important but
[47:12] this is actually not the most important
[47:14] part of the gospel we know the gospel
[47:17] with power is the most important part so
[47:20] look what he says here brotherly love
[47:22] the RAM said it was a great age of
[47:25] missionaries and missions the world has
[47:28] never seen a time it even goes over into
[47:30] our time now seen the time I'm sorry now
[47:33] when the world ever seen such a time of
[47:35] missionaries everywhere oh I'd say the
[47:37] last hundred 50 years it's been one of
[47:38] the most outstanding times of world
[47:40] history for missionaries getting into
[47:42] all parts of the world with the gospel
[47:46] as far as I look at this point now he
[47:48] starts breaking in this thought now pay
[47:50] attention I hope those colors yeah those
[47:52] look okay they look really bright on my
[47:53] screen but they look really good there I
[47:54] think hopefully that's okay so I just
[47:58] want you be able to read it he said now
[47:59] as far as literally just going sending
[48:01] the gospel on paper don't you appreciate
[48:04] a voice of God for making these I don't
[48:06] agree with all their doctrine because
[48:07] now they got doctrine but I do
[48:10] appreciate how they make the gospel on
[48:12] paper and they do a fine job they do a
[48:14] high quality job he says and tracts and
[48:18] books and so forth the gospel has long
[48:20] ago went to
[48:23] every nation under the heavens long ago
[48:26] so the world every nation has already
[48:29] received the gospel on paper but how
[48:33] come the end of the world hasn't come
[48:34] yet or the Rams gonna tell us it's
[48:36] because the power of God has not been
[48:38] preached in every nation and this is our
[48:41] job now this is what Americans should be
[48:42] doing sending missionaries to every
[48:45] country to preach the power of God
[48:47] now just send paper there but take take
[48:51] the written epistles there praise God
[48:53] take somebody who's a written epistle
[48:55] who's a living epistle who's has the
[48:58] Word of God written upon the tables of
[49:00] fleshly hearts and I'm gonna list about
[49:03] four missionaries I know that have
[49:05] supernatural vindication so God does
[49:07] have some but you know we need some more
[49:10] by God's grace need some more so you see
[49:13] that goes to prove that that wasn't what
[49:16] Jesus was talking about he never said go
[49:18] into the world now look that never he
[49:21] never said go in the world and build a
[49:22] Bible School
[49:24] he never said that well Graham and
[49:27] neither did he say go into all the world
[49:29] and pass out literature right he never
[49:33] said that
[49:34] those things are what do you say fine
[49:37] now some people there are some quotes
[49:39] her brother Bram he kind of gets a
[49:40] little harsh on people that do this but
[49:42] what he's just trying to make a point
[49:44] like this is not all we should do we
[49:46] should have preaching we should pray for
[49:47] the sick we should preach to divine
[49:49] healing we should see miracles amongst
[49:51] the believers aren't you glad we see him
[49:53] from time to time do we want to see more
[49:55] absolutely I feel like we should see
[49:57] more but we're glad for what we see but
[50:00] he said Jesus never said actually to do
[50:02] this he said to girl go and preach amen
[50:05] now here's the scripture where it's this
[50:08] one hasn't been fulfilled because the
[50:11] word preached he's going to tell us
[50:12] later means to demonstrate the
[50:14] supernatural power of so bro I'm sorry
[50:17] Jesus says this in Matthew 24:14 and
[50:19] this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[50:22] preached into all the world for a
[50:25] witness unto all nations and then shall
[50:27] the end come praise God
[50:31] so see we are not going to see the end
[50:33] of the world until the Holy Ghost gospel
[50:36] with supernatural vindication is
[50:39] preached to every nation and we've got
[50:42] some merry we've got some very violent
[50:44] nations don't we North Korea right use
[50:47] our name in Saudi Arabia Iraq Iran where
[50:51] they will literally kill you if you go
[50:53] there and preach so what are we waiting
[50:55] we're waiting for the leadership of the
[50:57] Holy Spirit to get in there you said
[50:59] brother Jess they should be in there by
[51:00] now well not necessarily it all depends
[51:03] on the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[51:05] because remember the Holy Spirit drove
[51:07] the Christians out of Jerusalem remember
[51:10] that in the book of Acts Holy Spirit
[51:12] drove them away in order to scatter the
[51:13] gospel so there might be a time and
[51:16] season we're waiting for for God to send
[51:20] the messengers and the preachers
[51:22] apostles into certain nations we're
[51:25] waiting for the times it sees it right
[51:27] because remember brother Adam said don't
[51:29] get off set if the rapture has taken
[51:31] place he said there's nothing wrong with
[51:33] God God's right on time tonight don't
[51:36] get all upset nerves like oh it's our
[51:38] fault you can't lay any charge to the
[51:40] God's elect you can't say for the
[51:42] bride's fault you can't lay any charge
[51:44] to the bride of Jesus Christ amen
[51:46] she's doing all she can do she's waiting
[51:49] for God to open the door to Iran amen to
[51:52] open the door to Japan in fact it's just
[51:55] being open right now amen
[51:57] Vietnam right now Simon's get ready to
[51:59] go in there by God's grace they'll kill
[52:01] Christians and he's going in there and
[52:03] may by the grace of Lord that's his plan
[52:04] right now you're talking about we need
[52:07] men of faith don't we but more than that
[52:10] church what Abraham say is the the
[52:13] reason for all his success the prayers
[52:15] of the saints that's why you and I have
[52:17] to pray for brother Simon praise God
[52:20] that's why you and I had to pray for all
[52:22] the missionaries amen if I felt a burden
[52:25] to go I would go I feel burdened a
[52:27] pastor aren't you glad you have a pastor
[52:29] as soon as I feel that leadership to go
[52:31] I'm gonna go one now God does raise up
[52:34] another pastor so I can go amen
[52:36] but I gotta have the time and ability
[52:38] but right now I feel led to pass through
[52:40] this church amen and I have for the last
[52:43] 11 years and you get the decide if I get
[52:45] to do it one more year on Sunday so you
[52:48] get to decide if I'm going to Pastor and
[52:50] the year by God's grace it's the
[52:52] leadership of the Holy Spirit so see
[52:54] buh-bam saying the word has already gone
[52:57] to every nation the gospel and paper
[52:59] form it's already been gone it's gone to
[53:02] every nation now with the internet now
[53:04] the word in digital form the preaching
[53:07] in digital form can go to every nation
[53:09] but we need preachers there that will
[53:12] preach the power and demonstration of
[53:14] the Holy Spirit and it's going to happen
[53:17] now let's look more of this thought he
[53:20] keeps going back to this song now we
[53:21] have taken this age right here where we
[53:24] are tonight on the Philadelphia Church
[53:26] age in that age there evangelize and as
[53:29] missionary all the complete world with
[53:32] literature
[53:33] it's our in that age of John Wesley it
[53:35] reached every nation with literature
[53:38] Jesus said when this gospel is preached
[53:40] all the world for a witness unto me then
[53:43] the end shall be well then if that what
[53:45] was he was talking about spreading out
[53:47] literature sending out missionaries with
[53:49] reading writing arithmetic and passing
[53:51] out tracts and making people shake hands
[53:53] and believe that there's a God if that
[53:55] was all was that he's far past his
[53:59] coming he says uh-huh so it shows that
[54:02] the gospel he said Paul said the gospel
[54:04] didn't come in word only but through
[54:07] power and manifestations of the Holy
[54:09] Ghost we're waiting for apostles to get
[54:14] so anointed with the Holy Ghost that
[54:16] they're not scared of machine guns at
[54:18] the airport when they land on in a
[54:20] foreign country and the church said
[54:22] we're waiting for missionaries filled
[54:24] with the Holy Ghost that don't care if
[54:26] the population is Muslim and they kill
[54:28] Christians but they walk in here and
[54:30] walk through the gates we'd say at the
[54:33] airport they walk through there and say
[54:34] I haven't come here by my power I've
[54:37] come here in the name of Jesus Christ
[54:39] that's already boy that's the gospel and
[54:42] power right now you have a lot of gospel
[54:45] literature which like I said we're
[54:46] grateful for that but what we're waiting
[54:48] for we are we should be praying for is
[54:50] for God to anoint somebody who's
[54:52] fearless now how about us now we should
[54:56] be fairly fearless at our jobs
[54:58] I should be fearless right we should be
[55:00] fearless at the grocery store we should
[55:02] be fearless everywhere
[55:04] we must have that same desire amen he
[55:09] said that when Jesus said go into all
[55:10] the world and preach the gospel he said
[55:12] go into all the world and demonstrate he
[55:15] said oh I like that
[55:16] demonstrate the power of the gospel
[55:17] taking the word he said that what it
[55:21] says and show the people when it says
[55:23] and then make it manifest to them oh
[55:25] that's the way that proves it so we have
[55:29] this idea of other Ram said that word
[55:30] preached Jesus had preached all nations
[55:32] that word preached means demonstrate the
[55:35] power of God and of course you can't do
[55:38] that without a gift of God you have to
[55:40] know your gifts you have to know what
[55:41] God has called you to do and then you
[55:43] get in the channel of that and then God
[55:45] will bless your gift amen
[55:47] now this is the scripture boat program
[55:49] is quoting I'm sorry it's so small but I
[55:51] want to fit it all on one slide and
[55:52] brethren this is first pertains to one
[55:55] brother and when I came in to you I came
[55:56] not with excellency of speech or wisdom
[55:59] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[56:01] so see Paul was not a fine-toothed
[56:04] scholar Paul was not a eloquent speaker
[56:07] Apollo's was how many number that
[56:10] Apollo's was very fine he was just like
[56:13] so articulate and he was so wonderful to
[56:15] listen to but Paul said I didn't come
[56:17] like that so what does that show Church
[56:20] that shows God has all kinds of
[56:22] preachers some are very perfect and
[56:24] eloquent they never spit on you
[56:28] they never raise their voice they're
[56:30] just so eloquent and so just so now they
[56:33] look like an archangel up there then you
[56:35] got others up there that look like the
[56:37] Rams that they got bulldog faith he look
[56:39] like a bulldog
[56:41] they got bulldog faith and they stand
[56:44] there with the gospel and they take God
[56:46] at His Word because God is a God of
[56:48] variety I've always thank God for the
[56:52] riot e we have here just of
[56:53] nationalities you know I just love that
[56:55] you know Asian African American what
[57:00] else Chinese yeah a man thank you
[57:03] we got I just love the variety with the
[57:06] same and true with preaching Paul said I
[57:08] wasn't the most eloquent man he said but
[57:11] one thing I had he said I tremble look
[57:13] at that he said I trembled at the Word
[57:15] of God now we're gonna get to right here
[57:17] for I determined not to know anything
[57:19] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[57:22] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[57:24] and in fear and much trembling so Paul
[57:27] was voice he was trembling before God
[57:29] saying God guide me by the Holy Spirit
[57:31] help me not to get caught up with wisdom
[57:33] help me to get caught up with the power
[57:35] of God and that's a missionary now
[57:39] remember he's a prophet he's a
[57:40] missionary and my speech and my
[57:43] preaching was not with enticing words of
[57:46] man's wisdom but in the demonstration of
[57:48] the Spirit and the power Amen that your
[57:52] faith should not stand the wisdom of men
[57:54] but in the power of God so that's what
[57:58] brother Adam says this is what Jesus
[57:59] meant when Jesus had go preach to all
[58:01] nations he was talking about
[58:03] demonstrating the spirit and
[58:05] demonstrating the power amen
[58:09] thank you Jesus hallelujah now now let's
[58:15] look at the gospel of power brother
[58:16] Graham brings it out just a little
[58:18] differently he said they opened up many
[58:21] doors during that age the Philadelphia
[58:23] Church age the door of the gospel the
[58:25] door to the mission fields the door back
[58:27] to Christ and everything was opened
[58:29] during that age and you can see what
[58:31] they did the brethren done a great job
[58:33] out of it so although it was just the
[58:36] word the gospel in paper form at least
[58:39] they did a good job with it
[58:40] praise God whatever you're called to you
[58:43] whatever I'm called to let us at least
[58:45] do a good job of what we're called to do
[58:47] like brother Branham said you know
[58:49] whatever you're called you'd be the very
[58:50] best at it be the best father you can be
[58:54] but be the best teacher you can meet be
[58:56] the best student you can be whatever you
[58:58] are be the best you can be he's sending
[59:02] from John Wesley the star after the
[59:04] Sardis age after he come over waking him
[59:07] up from the Sardis a teachin from the
[59:08] past 150 years he said great
[59:11] missionaries like of no other time or
[59:13] age before has covered the entire earth
[59:16] think of that every nation on the
[59:18] heavens has heard the word it completed
[59:21] many many years ago see but not the
[59:25] gospel just the word the letter killeth
[59:29] but the spear
[59:31] giveth life so now he calls he call it
[59:34] first the gospel paper and now he calls
[59:36] it just the word if we just have the
[59:39] work if you just have a Bible like I
[59:41] said having a Bible is wonderful but we
[59:43] want to see the Bible live grace God
[59:46] want to see this Bible whatever God said
[59:49] we want to see God live it out right
[59:52] that's the power and demonstration of
[59:54] the Holy Spirit now brother Graham told
[59:59] a story about three people that went
[1:00:01] overseas and did missionary work a young
[1:00:04] boy and two young girls and then he
[1:00:06] makes this statement afterwards so I'll
[1:00:10] just I'll just sorry I was listening to
[1:00:11] the story this morning on the way to
[1:00:13] work so I'll just rehearse it brother
[1:00:16] Graham said he was boarding I think he
[1:00:17] was going to Rhodesia I think if I
[1:00:19] remember right he was getting on a plane
[1:00:21] he saw some Americans and he looked at
[1:00:23] their passports he said you American yes
[1:00:25] he said where you from he said over from
[1:00:28] Kentucky perhaps no you're just in my
[1:00:29] backyard I'm from Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:00:31] and he said you wouldn't be that brother
[1:00:34] branham he said yes I am that brother
[1:00:35] branham and he said that cured him right
[1:00:38] there so in other words I didn't want to
[1:00:39] talk to him anymore and he said the guy
[1:00:42] brother I said can I talk to you about
[1:00:43] some principles of the gospel and they
[1:00:46] said sure he said he said he said we're
[1:00:49] missionaries he said we're both
[1:00:51] missionaries he said can you in the name
[1:00:53] of the Lord Jesus put your finger on one
[1:00:55] soul that you won to Christ in three
[1:00:57] years and they said no no but Ram said I
[1:01:00] hate to discourage you he said I
[1:01:02] appreciate what you're doing he said
[1:01:03] about you two ladies should be helping
[1:01:05] your mommy in the kitchen at home
[1:01:07] because a woman is not to go out and
[1:01:09] preach right and he said he and then he
[1:01:14] gets into the story of how they hadn't
[1:01:16] won a soul in three years and yet how he
[1:01:19] went there and he said we say hundreds
[1:01:21] or thousands gave their life to Christ
[1:01:23] amen and though now he tells his story
[1:01:25] afterwards because he was saying how
[1:01:27] they were Methodist and they weren't
[1:01:29] born again they didn't believe in
[1:01:30] holiness that believin supernatural and
[1:01:32] so see they're trying to do God a
[1:01:34] service but not doing it according to
[1:01:36] the Word of God nobody's got a business
[1:01:39] going in the fields unless they receive
[1:01:41] the Holy Ghost and the preaching the
[1:01:43] power
[1:01:44] demonstrations because it's the only
[1:01:46] thing that'll move those people and look
[1:01:52] what uprisings you got now and
[1:01:53] everything it's because that the true
[1:01:55] gospel has been preached to them been
[1:01:57] given to them in the word form well see
[1:02:01] what that is that's the continuation of
[1:02:04] the escape one of the Luther's age where
[1:02:06] give the world the free press that's
[1:02:08] right or the free Bibles you see that
[1:02:10] church that idea that Luther had where
[1:02:13] they were having the printing press and
[1:02:15] their print out the bibles that just
[1:02:17] carried over to the philadelphia church
[1:02:18] age which it was a good thing but jesus
[1:02:21] one of them to have the open door of the
[1:02:24] name of jesus christ the power of the
[1:02:27] baptism right the power of the deity of
[1:02:30] of the supreme deity of jesus christ and
[1:02:33] the supernatural power of the name of
[1:02:35] jesus so see they hadn't really gone on
[1:02:38] into the power they were carrying over
[1:02:41] the idea from from from Luther's age of
[1:02:45] the gospel and paper form
[1:02:51] now watch the time coming after the
[1:02:53] great missionary move that swept across
[1:02:55] the nations a brotherly love to what
[1:02:58] they had nothing against it seen he's
[1:03:01] not saying it's ok it's ok to have it
[1:03:03] it's ok nothing against this of
[1:03:06] literature whatever more in the
[1:03:08] different parts of the world now the
[1:03:09] church denomination has gone back to
[1:03:11] education and works again they've gone
[1:03:14] back so see most churches when they go
[1:03:16] overseas they just do this or they just
[1:03:19] build a hospital or which is good like I
[1:03:22] have a friend who is the part of World
[1:03:23] Vision I'm gonna hurt a World Vision
[1:03:25] they you know so my friend I I was
[1:03:28] talking to him a few weeks ago on the
[1:03:29] text I love this guy he runs marathons
[1:03:33] and they raised money so they can take
[1:03:35] that money over to Africa and then dig
[1:03:37] wells that's a wonderful thing I mean
[1:03:40] it's a better than I made a donation
[1:03:43] well I wanted to support him I think
[1:03:45] that's if you're willing to run 26.2
[1:03:47] miles
[1:03:48] the give people water and hygiene that
[1:03:52] might die otherwise I'll support that
[1:03:54] there's nothing wrong with that that's
[1:03:56] part that's
[1:03:58] part of the gospel but if that's all
[1:04:02] they're doing they're leaving out the
[1:04:03] other part of it
[1:04:05] praise God they have that literature or
[1:04:08] they have schools or they have hospitals
[1:04:10] that's fine but the main part of it but
[1:04:13] most of them won't even preach the other
[1:04:15] part the part of Paulo
[1:04:17] baby the part of the Holy Spirit coming
[1:04:20] upon the people getting them to repent
[1:04:22] come to Christ and see God for miracles
[1:04:25] they have they don't breach that part
[1:04:27] this is just part of it it's a good part
[1:04:31] that wasn't what Jesus said though Jesus
[1:04:34] said you must preach and he said these
[1:04:36] signs will follow them that believe amen
[1:04:41] so here's the four missionaries I know
[1:04:43] that supernatural vindication brother
[1:04:47] Maxwell Lee I preached for him four
[1:04:49] times in South America American he
[1:04:51] pre-shared one time back in 2014 he was
[1:04:55] here 2014 i always remember because it
[1:04:57] was one year before we moved into our
[1:04:58] thirds right here we moved in here in
[1:05:01] the fall of 2015 so maxwell Utley he
[1:05:05] said some of the most supernatural cases
[1:05:07] I've ever seen when they've done been
[1:05:09] doing missionary work he walked into a
[1:05:11] house that had demons in at one time and
[1:05:13] a demon-possessed person was running at
[1:05:16] him and when he got there the Holy
[1:05:18] Spirit on brother Maxwell flew through
[1:05:21] the man up against the wall and then
[1:05:24] fell down and then he walked into room
[1:05:26] where a woman was levitating laying on a
[1:05:29] bed and instantly she fell down under
[1:05:33] the bed and woke up revived the Holy
[1:05:36] Ghost was casting out demons just by him
[1:05:38] walking into the room what is he Church
[1:05:42] he's a missionary he goes all over South
[1:05:45] America preaching and sharing this
[1:05:48] message you know you don't have to ask
[1:05:50] him about the power behind this message
[1:05:52] this message has power and in a pen he
[1:05:56] said another time they were preaching
[1:05:57] one time in a park I think I told you
[1:05:59] this but I'll share it again for
[1:06:01] Sierra's sake you know for my children
[1:06:03] too we can't forget these testimonies in
[1:06:06] the book of Judges they forgot the Bible
[1:06:09] said they didn't tell the next
[1:06:10] generation
[1:06:11] all about God and so the next generation
[1:06:14] grew up and didn't know the testimonies
[1:06:16] so you and I have to tell the
[1:06:18] testimonies of Christ or else these
[1:06:20] children aren't going to know about the
[1:06:22] power of God until they experience it
[1:06:25] themselves he said they're on a park and
[1:06:27] they were preaching they're having
[1:06:28] service and there's a big crowd of
[1:06:30] believers you know none believers and a
[1:06:32] man walked up to the crowd a big old
[1:06:35] muscle man I said where's the pastor and
[1:06:38] all the people in the church got scared
[1:06:40] and said there is any and it was just
[1:06:43] like the maniac that came up to brother
[1:06:45] Branham and he said you need to stop
[1:06:47] preaching all these things and brother
[1:06:49] Maximo said the man pulled his fists
[1:06:51] back to punch him and Maxwell he said in
[1:06:53] his mind he reverted back to his tighter
[1:06:56] his martial arts training and he was
[1:06:58] going to do a sidestep trip him and
[1:07:00] throw him down because that's what he's
[1:07:01] trained to do
[1:07:02] he was like he was into martial arts his
[1:07:04] whole childhood he said in before he
[1:07:07] could even move he said the Holy Spirit
[1:07:10] threw the man down at his feet and held
[1:07:11] on to his feet and he was pleading for
[1:07:13] forgiveness just like brother happened
[1:07:16] to brother branham and he's telling me
[1:07:19] this with tears coming down his eyes
[1:07:20] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:07:24] and forever
[1:07:27] most recently he said oh I'm seeing our
[1:07:29] testimony and he gave me a voicemail my
[1:07:32] whatsapp my whatsapp app he's sheriffs
[1:07:35] testimony they went into Jonesboro no
[1:07:37] that's not Jonesboro it's that I'm sorry
[1:07:42] it's that city where they had that mass
[1:07:45] killing in Guyana who members that
[1:07:47] remember Jim Jones remember that where
[1:07:50] they Jane where they drank the kool-aid

[1:07:54] city in Guyana many ways they went to
[1:07:56] that City last year preach the gospel
[1:07:58] and brother Maxwell said a whole gang of
[1:08:03] sinners repented and all got baptized in
[1:08:06] Jesus Christ's name and he said they
[1:08:08] went back this year and built a church
[1:08:09] therefore and I think there was a
[1:08:12] thousand people that died in that mass
[1:08:13] killing in 1977 remember that well I
[1:08:16] mean we must some of us weren't live I
[1:08:18] wasn't alive but I remember reading
[1:08:19] about it okay and we just passed the
[1:08:22] anniversary a few weeks ago I remember I
[1:08:24] saw it on Facebook
[1:08:25] and they were trying to encourage people
[1:08:26] to stay away from cults I'll say amen to
[1:08:28] that stay away from any call where a man
[1:08:30] will tell you to kill yourself and your
[1:08:33] there's going to be a an alien rapture
[1:08:35] or something like that you know that's
[1:08:37] awful it's he's evil anyway so see

[1:09:49] them into prisons all the time
[1:09:52] Craig Brewer of course most of us know
[1:09:55] brother Craig he's going to Japan right
[1:09:56] now and he was telling testimonies of
[1:09:58] people that were sick with headaches or
[1:10:00] different I forget the healed illnesses
[1:10:02] but he was telling testimonies they
[1:10:04] prayed for them and they were instantly
[1:10:05] healed right there in Japan just this
[1:10:07] year about the grace of God brother
[1:10:10] Jason to Mars he's goes into I'm sorry
[1:10:12] he goes into Turkey I believe it is and
[1:10:13] has done some work in Iran and he wrote
[1:10:16] a whole book about how God is moving in
[1:10:19] Persia ancient Persia which is
[1:10:21] modern-day Turkey modern-day Iran and
[1:10:24] there's numerous miracles of them
[1:10:25] receiving healings of having dreams and
[1:10:28] prophecies come to pass
[1:10:30] proving that our God is alive and well
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:33] now those are missionaries I know of
[1:10:35] course I don't know many people there's
[1:10:37] probably hundreds more
[1:10:39] going around the world now I put this up
[1:10:42] here but let's not forget the the quotes
[1:10:44] of brother Branham here if we want to
[1:10:47] see more power and accurate we've got to
[1:10:48] be more sincere because mother have said
[1:10:50] sincerity brings power we must consent
[1:10:53] confess our sins because that will bring
[1:10:56] faith and then faith works by love and
[1:10:59] then if we've got love it will cast out
[1:11:02] all fear so we can have faith right and
[1:11:06] then we must pray we must pray down the
[1:11:09] blessings of God brother Branham said we
[1:11:10] must pray first and then we'll receive a
[1:11:13] revelation of healing or revelation of a
[1:11:15] prophecy the trouble is most people
[1:11:17] don't want to pray you can say men then
[1:11:20] they get about a man most people don't
[1:11:22] want to pray most people don't most
[1:11:25] people hardly you want to come to church
[1:11:26] on a Wednesday night let's say they
[1:11:28] believe the message right I many do they
[1:11:31] just can't maybe travel with you know
[1:11:33] schedules or whatever more but at least
[1:11:35] they should be live-streaming right and
[1:11:38] then brother Branham said if you got the
[1:11:41] Holy Ghost you you're in the word all
[1:11:43] the way you're gonna be in the preaching
[1:11:44] your love all the preaching of the word
[1:11:46] of God that's the evidence that you got
[1:11:49] the Holy Ghost that you want to hear all
[1:11:52] the word that's being preached by the
[1:11:54] Holy Ghost today let me close with this
[1:11:59] here for this half of the sermon Hicks
[1:12:02] I'm at 32 minutes I got that was worked
[1:12:04] out really good not half way Jesus first
[1:12:07] Commission to the Apostles was for
[1:12:09] Supernatural Jesus's last Commission and
[1:12:12] the Apostles was for Supernatural this
[1:12:17] is his last words he said when he left
[1:12:19] the earth he said these signs shall
[1:12:21] follow them that believe his first
[1:12:24] Commission to the church what was it
[1:12:26] Matthew 10 heal the sick cleanse the
[1:12:28] lepers raise the dead freely you receive
[1:12:30] freely give
[1:12:31] or as God shows you you do what he said
[1:12:34] do the last Commission of the church was
[1:12:37] the same thing the last words that fell
[1:12:40] from his sake her lips as he was going
[1:12:41] up going to the all the world and preach
[1:12:43] the gospel to every creature he that
[1:12:45] believeth in his baptized shall be saved
[1:12:47] he that believeth not shall be damned
[1:12:49] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:12:51] believe in mine
[1:12:52] they shall cast out Devils now look at
[1:12:57] this next stop here look at this next
[1:12:59] word he said oh here's the sign of a
[1:13:02] believer we said we say this or Chris or
[1:13:05] Church members say this oh here's a sign
[1:13:07] of Leever he goes at the church he's a
[1:13:08] good man he pays his debts
[1:13:10] well the RAM said that's fine are
[1:13:12] nothing to say about that he has a
[1:13:14] educators children that's Danny I have
[1:13:17] nothing to say about that he said but
[1:13:20] that's not the sign of a believer even
[1:13:23] to preach the gospel is not a sign of a
[1:13:26] believer jesus said these signs follow
[1:13:28] the believer amen so you must do all
[1:13:32] these other things but on top of doing
[1:13:34] all that on top of all that you must
[1:13:37] have the supernatural power of God in
[1:13:39] your life that's the sign of a believer
[1:13:41] see you've got all the word operating in
[1:13:44] your life hey Laurie in my name they
[1:13:50] shall cast out devils they speak with
[1:13:52] new tongues they take up serpents they
[1:13:54] drink deadly things will not harm them
[1:13:56] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[1:13:58] shall recover
[1:13:59] hey I don't you love that amen that's
[1:14:04] Jesus first Commission in Matthew 10
[1:14:06] it's his last Commission in mark chapter
[1:14:08] 16 that these signs follow them that
[1:14:12] believe amen now we've been over that
[1:14:16] numerous times so I want to go to this
[1:14:19] thought and then I'll go to the Deacon
[1:14:20] thought I said this on Sunday night
[1:14:22] after brother Simon for each how many
[1:14:23] enjoyed his serve services wow that was
[1:14:26] beautiful that was such a wonderful day
[1:14:28] of sermons you know if you didn't listen
[1:14:32] that you you really would like that by
[1:14:33] God I think everybody here maybe you did
[1:14:35] most people here did you'll really be
[1:14:37] blessed by those sermons there by God's
[1:14:40] grace now here's the endtime condition
[1:14:43] let me go back to that when I was trying
[1:14:45] to do I was trying to string together a
[1:14:47] chain of scriptures to show how awful
[1:14:51] the conditions are spiritually in this
[1:14:53] age and you and I have got to overcome
[1:14:56] them and we will only by the Holy Ghost
[1:14:59] because the Holy Ghost will turn our
[1:15:01] hearts back to Paul
[1:15:04] Peter back to st. John the Holy Ghost
[1:15:07] will turn our hearts back to the
[1:15:09] Apostolic fathers but look how wicked
[1:15:13] look at this string of scriptures I got
[1:15:15] about seven scriptures look how wicked
[1:15:18] this hour is that we live in the first
[1:15:21] one Jesus said because the Nick WA T
[1:15:23] shall bound the love of many shall wax
[1:15:26] cold so in other words there'll be many
[1:15:29] that will have no real love how many
[1:15:33] ever I may see it on a daily basis
[1:15:35] there's no real Christian love right and
[1:15:39] why is that why is there a lack of love
[1:15:41] if you see people in the church center
[1:15:43] that don't reach out and love anymore or
[1:15:45] they're not really active in the church
[1:15:47] or they don't when you shake your hand
[1:15:49] don't really feel out of love why is
[1:15:50] that there's a Nick WA T in their lives
[1:15:53] how many understand that because of
[1:15:56] iniquity the love of many shall wax cold
[1:16:01] when you don't feel like coming to shake
[1:16:03] brother Jesse's hand at church
[1:16:05] something's wrong you got some iniquity
[1:16:07] in your life right when I don't feel
[1:16:09] like coming to shake your hand or give
[1:16:12] you a hug if you're a brother if we
[1:16:14] don't feel that love it's because
[1:16:16] iniquity got in somewhere right you were
[1:16:19] enticed you were drawn away by your own
[1:16:21] lust and now you can't even love the
[1:16:23] very people that are the body of Jesus
[1:16:25] Christ how could you not love the body
[1:16:27] of Jesus Christ because you've got sin
[1:16:29] in your life that's exactly right
[1:16:32] that's what Jesus said because iniquity
[1:16:36] of boughs because people just get more
[1:16:38] and more bound in their sins they don't
[1:16:42] love anymore they don't have the real
[1:16:44] love of Jesus Christ now tie this in
[1:16:47] let's do a chain let's chain that up
[1:16:49] with this scripture start seeing this
[1:16:51] link of truth this this chain of truth
[1:16:54] all through the scripture and except
[1:16:56] those days should be shortened now look
[1:16:58] at this church can you get can we wrap
[1:17:00] our minds around this there shall be no
[1:17:02] flesh even saved so in other words
[1:17:06] there's going to be less people say as
[1:17:09] we draw closer to the end we're gonna
[1:17:11] see less people saying now I'm not
[1:17:14] trying to create I hope you understand
[1:17:16] this church I'm not trying to create an
[1:17:18] humbly I not in other words I don't want
[1:17:22] you to come and say well I guess
[1:17:23] nobody's gonna get saved today I don't
[1:17:25] want you to have that attitude I want
[1:17:27] you to have an attitude of eight and you
[1:17:29] will have your bread but we have to
[1:17:32] understand as time goes on where it's
[1:17:34] less and less people actually get saved
[1:17:37] because Jesus said I've got a short in
[1:17:39] two days or else no one will be safe
[1:17:42] because it's gonna get last and less and
[1:17:45] less two years harder brother daughters
[1:17:47] say they had ten days of meetings in it
[1:17:50] South Africa he said an eight souls got
[1:17:53] saved I mean we're talking in we're
[1:17:57] talking about where the field is
[1:17:58] supposed to be right with harvesters
[1:18:00] that eight people he said he had all
[1:18:04] these are the preachers he named that
[1:18:05] went in through and very coffee all
[1:18:07] these brothers you know that we've heard
[1:18:09] all that we love their ministries ten
[1:18:12] days of services and eight people got
[1:18:15] sick 8 and Jesus said I've got to
[1:18:18] shorten it or else Nolan will be saved
[1:18:22] how many understand we're living in a
[1:18:23] dangerous time because Jesus said
[1:18:29] because the Strait is the gate and
[1:18:30] narrow is the way which leadeth unto
[1:18:32] life and few there be that find it jesus
[1:18:36] said this 2000 years ago few would find
[1:18:38] it well what is it gonna be today with
[1:18:39] Adam if it was few and in 2,000 years
[1:18:43] ago what's it gonna be today now sring
[1:18:46] these three got you you see the chain
[1:18:48] Milton here I'm building a chain I'm
[1:18:50] tying these thoughts together so you
[1:18:52] understand how awful this time is and
[1:18:56] nobody you see and I want you to think
[1:18:57] well it must be Jessie's fault I don't
[1:18:59] want you to think that well must be the
[1:19:01] piano players father unless we must not
[1:19:03] blame other people it's Satan's fault
[1:19:05] and it's the fault of the people letting
[1:19:09] sin abound in their lives without
[1:19:11] repenting Amen show me where I'm wrong
[1:19:13] or show me where these churches where
[1:19:16] the best show me whether message
[1:19:17] churches are wrong in their preaching
[1:19:18] they're not wrong they're right the
[1:19:20] problem is people are loving sin more
[1:19:23] than they're loving God amen that's the
[1:19:25] problem because Nick witty abound the
[1:19:29] love of many shall wax cold
[1:19:32] in wax it's increasing more and more
[1:19:34] there's less real love for God
[1:19:37] they lose their love for the church so
[1:19:39] they don't come to church they lose the
[1:19:40] love for you so can't even call me on
[1:19:42] your birthday or you don't just sit on
[1:19:43] me they don't love you they can t put a
[1:19:46] little happy birthday on Facebook or
[1:19:48] something you understand what I'm saying
[1:19:49] the church can't even say happy birthday
[1:19:52] just that's the little thing now what
[1:19:54] about if somebody's poor don't have any
[1:19:55] money and nobody will give them any
[1:19:57] money we're supposed to be a family if I
[1:20:01] know you would ever need I'm gonna help
[1:20:03] you if I don't either I don't know about
[1:20:05] it I forgot or I got sinned in my life
[1:20:08] and that can only I couldn't be the only
[1:20:09] choices right
[1:20:12] the Bible said in James chapter 2 if you
[1:20:15] see someone destitute of food and
[1:20:17] clothing and you don't help them and say
[1:20:19] oh I have a warm night and you don't
[1:20:21] give them a coat your faith is dead pead
[1:20:25] dead and the church said if you see
[1:20:31] somebody that don't have a car you can
[1:20:32] go to church if you don't help them to
[1:20:34] get their car fixed or you don't offer
[1:20:35] them a ride to church I might imagine
[1:20:38] and say your faith is really weak I
[1:20:40] won't say dead but I would say it's
[1:20:42] getting pretty weak
[1:20:44] now you can't force somebody to come to
[1:20:46] church but did we try to meet the needs
[1:20:50] of the church how can we say we love the
[1:20:53] body how can we say we love Jesus if we
[1:20:54] don't love who Jesus created oh yeah
[1:20:57] James said you can't you can't love
[1:21:00] Jesus who you can't see you can't love
[1:21:02] him without loving those he created
[1:21:07] glory I don't really have that in my
[1:21:09] notes Oh hallelujah amen that must be
[1:21:12] for us now now here's number 4 we're
[1:21:15] making a change let no man deceive you
[1:21:17] by any means so don't let even me if I
[1:21:19] fight to preach a false doctrine and I
[1:21:21] need corrected don't let anyone deceive
[1:21:23] you for that day shall not come except
[1:21:26] there come up falling away first
[1:21:28] remember jesus said that tears must be
[1:21:31] bowed what first before the rapture
[1:21:35] first the tears must unite in their
[1:21:38] ecumenical council and they must all
[1:21:41] fall away into apostasy first
[1:21:45] buying the tears first then gather the
[1:21:48] wheat to my garner hey then have a met
[1:21:51] have a meet up in the air the dead in
[1:21:53] Christ will rise first then we which are
[1:21:55] alive and remain shall go with them to
[1:21:57] meet the Lord in the air
[1:21:59] but first gather the tears and let them
[1:22:03] be fallen away into apostasy 'he's
[1:22:07] exactly right do you see the picture
[1:22:11] that the bible is painting about the end
[1:22:12] times I think that's another video I
[1:22:13] want to do I want to do a video about
[1:22:14] the end times and if people can't see
[1:22:17] that's today they're totally blind
[1:22:19] they're on their way to hell I hate to
[1:22:20] say that but if they can't see this is
[1:22:22] the condition of churches I'm not
[1:22:24] talking about sinners I'm talking about
[1:22:26] churches churches that say they're the
[1:22:30] mouthpiece of God but if they're
[1:22:32] lukewarm Jesus has already spewed them
[1:22:34] out and they're no longer talking for
[1:22:36] Christ
[1:22:36] I'm glad we can talk for Christ tonight
[1:22:38] amen and if he loves us he'll rebuke us
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:44] it's not fun and I got a quote from this
[1:22:47] sermon and Philadelphia sermon 1960
[1:22:48] where brother have said woe to me if I
[1:22:50] don't rebuke denomination woe to me if I
[1:22:53] don't bother the churches he said if I
[1:22:55] did it he said Jesus would he said I
[1:22:59] hate to do that he said I hate to feel
[1:23:01] like I'm picking against women not
[1:23:03] immoral women not good me or immoral
[1:23:07] men's I'm picking on men's immoral men
[1:23:09] right it's immoral churches he said it
[1:23:12] but if I didn't preach them woe unto me
[1:23:14] Paul said right how many know the book
[1:23:17] of Revelation there's three woes we know
[1:23:19] that so in other words Paul's saying woe
[1:23:22] unto me the woes the judgments of God
[1:23:24] are going to come upon me if I don't
[1:23:26] tell people the truth of the gospel woe
[1:23:30] unto me if I don't bring some basketball
[1:23:32] program said Jesus will send me to hell
[1:23:34] I don't preach against those
[1:23:35] denominations there has to be a
[1:23:39] defection there has to be an apostasy
[1:23:42] where people literally turn from the
[1:23:45] truth of the scripture just to believe
[1:23:46] whatever they want I'll just believe
[1:23:49] whatever I want
[1:23:50] they've totally turned their backs
[1:23:52] they've defected from the faith they
[1:23:54] turn their backs and the Bible said they
[1:23:56] trample underfoot the Son
[1:23:57] and fresh that they were what sanctifies
[1:24:00] how many know that Scripture
[1:24:03] okay scripture number five on the chain
[1:24:06] I mean oh brother have said every soul
[1:24:09] hangs on a chain over hell and every
[1:24:12] chain is only strong as its weakest link
[1:24:14] there are no weak links in God's Word so
[1:24:18] you and I might feel the heat sometimes
[1:24:20] the trials and the fiery trials of our
[1:24:23] faith but one thing we know our chain
[1:24:25] will never break amen
[1:24:28] because we don't preach any half-baked
[1:24:30] biblical doctrine all of our doctrine is
[1:24:32] straight from the Word of God amen
[1:24:34] hallelujah and this NOSSA than the last
[1:24:39] days perilous times shall come
[1:24:42] which means hard to bear dangerous
[1:24:44] savage I mean I always say it's hard to
[1:24:46] bear some of these trials that we face
[1:24:48] they're savage trials it's savage people
[1:24:53] are savage right
[1:24:54] they've know no regard they can't
[1:24:56] recognize the presence of the holy ghost
[1:24:57] get recognized when they need to repent
[1:24:59] can't recognize the Word of God
[1:25:01] it's a savage time number six now look
[1:25:06] at this this is what I was saying less
[1:25:08] and less people saved because the
[1:25:10] preachers are getting worse and worse
[1:25:12] and more seductive and more tricky but
[1:25:17] evil men and seducers shall wa increase
[1:25:19] or wax worse and worse deceiving and
[1:25:25] being deceived
[1:25:30] jesus said I've got a short in the days
[1:25:32] that there are left before Armageddon
[1:25:34] right or the tribulation I have to
[1:25:37] shorten these days or else no flesh can
[1:25:39] even be saved that's the awful condition
[1:25:43] that we're living in right now and
[1:25:48] that's why I as a pastor I got to stand
[1:25:50] here and when you have been and all the
[1:25:53] faithful church members all the ones
[1:25:55] that really love the word have to hear
[1:25:57] me continually ball out the same sins
[1:26:00] that people the church do and I'm sorry
[1:26:03] you have to sit through it we just pray
[1:26:04] for them
[1:26:05] but if I let that go on and don't tell
[1:26:08] them it's wrong guess what God's gonna
[1:26:10] make me and
[1:26:11] the day judgment and then I'll be a
[1:26:12] foolish virgin or Allah or worse but if
[1:26:15] I preach the word and brother and said
[1:26:17] you preach the word and live what you
[1:26:19] preach then there's a great reward for
[1:26:21] all those that do that amen
[1:26:24] I'm sorry I have to sit through that
[1:26:25] sometimes but I've got to deal with
[1:26:27] that's my job that's my job
[1:26:29] the Bible said rebuke them that sin and
[1:26:32] I hate to do it but woe to me if I don't
[1:26:37] it's gonna get worse and worse more
[1:26:40] deceptive they think they're save
[1:26:42] they're think they're in the message
[1:26:43] they think they're going the rapture and
[1:26:44] they're not and how will you know the
[1:26:48] word this Bible Church will tell us if
[1:26:52] we're right with God or not this
[1:26:55] wonderful gospel of word gospel on paper
[1:26:59] right but the Holy Spirit will direct us
[1:27:02] to the parts of the paper that will set
[1:27:05] us free
[1:27:05] okay that's six now here it's go to
[1:27:07] seven okay I just added this in because
[1:27:09] this is the condition that we have to
[1:27:11] battle today Jesus said I know your
[1:27:13] works in Laodicea
[1:27:14] thou art neither hot nor cold I would
[1:27:16] thou wert cold or hot so then because
[1:27:18] thou art lukewarm now lukewarm means
[1:27:20] sometimes hot sometimes cold sometimes
[1:27:22] up sometimes cool sometimes really
[1:27:25] excited sometimes not because out
[1:27:31] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:27:33] spew thee out of my mouth so you can't
[1:27:36] go dancing you can't be the mouthpiece
[1:27:37] of God you can't talk for God anymore
[1:27:39] now look at this this is the hard part
[1:27:41] this is where brother Adam preached a
[1:27:43] sermon and knoweth it not and he said
[1:27:45] this is the most awful condition of
[1:27:47] being in the entire Bible is this
[1:27:50] because you say I'm rich I'm increased
[1:27:53] with Goods and I have no more need of
[1:27:55] the Holy Ghost preaching I'm just
[1:27:58] paraphrasing I'm so rich enough I'm so
[1:28:02] strong spiritually I'm so close to God
[1:28:05] and I don't have any more devotion to
[1:28:07] Christ you can't either preach at me you
[1:28:09] can't help me by your preaching because
[1:28:11] I don't need anything I'm good I've
[1:28:16] already made a bow just amazing I'm
[1:28:19] already the message I made it I can just
[1:28:21] I don't have a need of anything my
[1:28:24] brother Graham said that is
[1:28:25] so different than the book of Acts
[1:28:27] chapter 4 after they got the Holy Ghost
[1:28:29] and seen miracles they got in jail for
[1:28:31] one night he said they went into upper
[1:28:32] room and prayed and God shook the place
[1:28:34] and they said God make us more bold and
[1:28:37] he said those who have the Holy Ghost
[1:28:39] were crying out for the Holy Ghost like
[1:28:41] they didn't have anything that's how you
[1:28:43] know a true believer today they're
[1:28:45] crying out for more the Holy Ghost even
[1:28:47] though they got it amen glory amen
[1:28:51] that's the scripture amen but see people
[1:28:55] come to message churches and thank God
[1:28:57] for the faithful Saints you know to me
[1:28:59] they say that you know they say they
[1:29:00] believe the message but they don't cry
[1:29:02] out for more of God well isn't that the
[1:29:05] same thing that we see here I don't have
[1:29:09] any need of it brother Jess I don't ever
[1:29:11] really need to repent brother Jess I
[1:29:13] never need to come up for prayer brother
[1:29:14] Jess I don't really need to pray more
[1:29:17] come to church more we don't need
[1:29:19] special meetings there yeah we got
[1:29:22] enough look at the attitude and see it's
[1:29:26] deceptive right it's more and more
[1:29:28] deceived more and more not less and less
[1:29:31] more and more deception and Jesus says
[1:29:34] you don't even know that your wretched
[1:29:37] miserable poor blind and naked so let's
[1:29:46] summarize the stay that we live in few
[1:29:49] people will be saved and find the path
[1:29:52] of life the number will continue to
[1:29:54] decrease and I'm not preaching this to
[1:29:57] discourage you I'm not trying to be
[1:29:58] negative I'm just showing you what the
[1:30:01] prophecy is of the last days how many
[1:30:03] can understand and weak understand I
[1:30:05] said I showed you about six seven eight
[1:30:07] nine I showed you a string of nine
[1:30:08] scriptures nine now I'll say this few
[1:30:15] people will love with Christ love how do
[1:30:20] you remember what pure religion is you
[1:30:22] got your Bible or let's go there let's
[1:30:24] go to a James chapter one I'll just put
[1:30:26] it up here I think I can switch over
[1:30:27] quick I don't remember what pure
[1:30:30] religion is the word religion is not bad
[1:30:32] as long as it is pure every understand
[1:30:34] that you know as people say oh you just
[1:30:37] got a man-made religion well yeah
[1:30:39] domination you've got man-made covering
[1:30:41] but the Bible said there's such a thing
[1:30:43] as pure religion if any man among you
[1:30:47] seem to be religious and can't bridle
[1:30:49] his tongue he deceives his own heart
[1:30:52] this man's religion is in vain and I
[1:30:56] share this with the brother he asked me
[1:30:57] where's the scripture that says there's
[1:30:59] no custom so I shared this with you if
[1:31:02] you're still cussing and your religion
[1:31:04] hasn't taken effect yet praise God or
[1:31:09] let's say cursing people well you're not
[1:31:16] the judge we're to judge their fruits
[1:31:18] let me know that you can judge fruits
[1:31:20] how you agree to serve on this by the
[1:31:21] way we can judge their fruits but we
[1:31:25] can't judge their eternal destination
[1:31:29] unless here's the exception unless
[1:31:31] you're right Paul and the Holy Ghost
[1:31:33] comes on you and you'll get you - and
[1:31:35] say holy - you son of the devil
[1:31:39] the only exception went right the Holy
[1:31:42] Ghost no part of this that you so the
[1:31:44] devil may you be blind for a season to
[1:31:46] cause blindness now that's the exception
[1:31:48] if not we cannot judge people's eternal
[1:31:51] destination but jesus said you will know
[1:31:53] them by their fruits understand that's
[1:31:59] the difference but if a man or woman
[1:32:02] can't bridle their tongue and does all
[1:32:04] and hates without a cause like Jesus
[1:32:06] said it's the same as murder and they
[1:32:07] can't do it their religion hasn't even
[1:32:09] taken effect the guy cry Christianity
[1:32:11] hasn't even had a real effect in their
[1:32:13] lives now here's what I want to say pure
[1:32:16] religion and let's get down to some of
[1:32:19] this especially this holiday season
[1:32:20] let's get down to some more of this God
[1:32:22] has opened up some doors where I've been
[1:32:24] able to do live into this here good
[1:32:26] let's pray to God open up for all of us
[1:32:29] pure religion and undefiled before God
[1:32:31] and the father is this to visit the
[1:32:36] fatherless how many know of any children
[1:32:37] that don't have a father home that's
[1:32:41] people we should pray about visiting now
[1:32:45] I'm not going to ask for hands but how
[1:32:46] many have done that in the last six
[1:32:47] months if not let's pray about it
[1:32:51] this
[1:32:52] is pure and undefiled religion you visit
[1:32:55] the father's and the widow follow us and
[1:32:57] the widows in the midst of their
[1:32:59] affliction so when you see people
[1:33:01] hurting children that don't have a dad
[1:33:03] or mom could be either one or you see
[1:33:06] women that don't have husbands in their
[1:33:08] dirt poor
[1:33:09] whatever more if you don't visit them
[1:33:12] then our religions not really taking
[1:33:15] effect when we see people struggling and
[1:33:18] we don't help out
[1:33:19] something's wrong with us does everybody
[1:33:22] understand it that's the condition we're
[1:33:24] living in Jesus said the love of many
[1:33:26] shall wax cold they're gonna be cold
[1:33:29] towards the father's well let them deal
[1:33:30] with it they've got food stamps let them
[1:33:32] deal with it themselves
[1:33:33] no you and I are to be their food stamps
[1:33:36] you and I are to be their help see and
[1:33:42] this is what I love too so there's three
[1:33:43] parts to it and to keep himself
[1:33:45] unspotted from the world don't have
[1:33:48] anything to do with the world something
[1:33:52] we can all ask God for help with don't
[1:33:56] let me get tied to this app on my phone
[1:33:58] and too much worldliness and too much
[1:34:00] worldliness don't let me get tied to the
[1:34:02] things in the world I'll keep myself
[1:34:04] unspotted from the things in the world I
[1:34:06] keep all the worldly things off me
[1:34:08] I'll just live pure I won't join in that
[1:34:10] worldly Association I won't join up with
[1:34:12] worldly things I'll just remain over
[1:34:14] here clean and white in the eyes of
[1:34:16] Christ now we have some pure religion
[1:34:20] now we're walking pure before God when
[1:34:24] we care so much about children that
[1:34:25] don't have dads when we care so much
[1:34:28] about widows that don't have husbands
[1:34:29] and we all we want to do is keep the
[1:34:33] devil office
[1:34:35] now we're getting pure religion before
[1:34:37] God how many can say men I just thought
[1:34:41] I'd need to put that in there that's
[1:34:44] Christ's love that's pure that's pure
[1:34:46] religion and this is going to get
[1:34:48] smaller and less and less and less as we
[1:34:52] see that Day approaching few people will
[1:34:57] be hot with Christian works I guess
[1:34:58] those two can go together I'll put those
[1:35:00] together few people escape the seducing
[1:35:02] teachers who's teaching will only grow
[1:35:05] more
[1:35:05] inductive and remember how it operates
[1:35:08] it lets you enjoy fleshly lusts that's
[1:35:11] what the Bible says they are teachers of
[1:35:14] unrighteousness so false teacher will
[1:35:17] let you live in sin without rebuking it
[1:35:21] will give you a license for immorality
[1:35:24] that's called lasciviousness in the King
[1:35:25] James Version a license to sin there is
[1:35:29] no license that crowd a Christ
[1:35:30] fellowship to sin if you're in sin
[1:35:32] repent of your sin and if you're a real
[1:35:35] Christian you probably I do it every day
[1:35:38] right I mean you God forgive me I didn't
[1:35:41] mean to say that I didn't mean to do
[1:35:42] that have mercy Jesus forgive me help me
[1:35:45] to overcome that next time you see few
[1:35:49] people will recognize their need for
[1:35:50] more of God and repent because the
[1:35:54] lukewarm spirit says I don't have any
[1:35:56] need of that brother just I'll have to
[1:35:57] fast on Saturday you understand you have
[1:36:00] to be led but I feel led to fast not
[1:36:02] about you but I feel that the fast
[1:36:03] I don't need to do that I don't need to
[1:36:07] help out any children that don't have
[1:36:09] dads I have to help out any widows you
[1:36:13] see the love of God will constrain you
[1:36:15] to do it if you're real Christian I'll
[1:36:19] say like this if your Holy Ghost still
[1:36:21] Christian you give me a real Christian
[1:36:22] me foolish virgin I'm talk about a Holy
[1:36:23] Ghost feel Christian that's what I'm
[1:36:26] talking about okay let me close a deacon
[1:36:27] requirements has that been OK by God's
[1:36:29] grace we went a little deeper in the
[1:36:32] word of paper verses the word with power
[1:36:35] and I wanted to show that string of
[1:36:38] scriptures that show the endtime
[1:36:40] conditions that we have to overcome we
[1:36:43] have to overcome that now let's take
[1:36:45] your Bibles here let's go to Acts
[1:36:46] chapter 6 verse 1 to 7 I think we just
[1:36:49] have time to read these and then we'll
[1:36:51] go through a quote and I think we'll be
[1:36:52] okay now as I said I'm already a deacon
[1:36:57] if I could I would sit in the back
[1:37:00] because that's where the Deacon needs to
[1:37:02] be program so that nikka needs to see
[1:37:03] everybody who walks in the door but many
[1:37:06] times I'm preaching in solidness I can't
[1:37:08] sit out there huh let's go through some
[1:37:12] Deacon requirements I do a lot of deacon
[1:37:14] requirements want to help people with
[1:37:16] food or bills or things things like that
[1:37:19] let's look at some of the deccan
[1:37:21] requirements Acts chapter six verse one
[1:37:27] sorry it's taking me so long mercy and
[1:37:30] those days when the number of disciples
[1:37:32] was multiplied there arose a murmuring
[1:37:33] among the Grecians against the Hebrews
[1:37:36] because their widows were neglected in
[1:37:39] the daily administration so look there's
[1:37:40] a little bit of murmuring complaining in
[1:37:41] the early church I'm gonna believe
[1:37:44] that's about how many believe this is a
[1:37:45] book of Acts church do that church
[1:37:49] sometimes there's murmuring in a real
[1:37:51] book of Acts church well why they don't
[1:37:54] help us out and how come they don't do
[1:37:55] this her see sometimes we murmur don't
[1:38:00] we but there was a murmuring here Oh
[1:38:02] somebody's there not getting food every
[1:38:04] day see Christians should help people
[1:38:07] that don't have food then the twelve
[1:38:11] called the multitude the disciples under
[1:38:12] them and said there's not reason that we
[1:38:14] should leave the Word of God and serve
[1:38:15] tables now this is what I would love to
[1:38:16] do I would love at some point to have so
[1:38:18] many deacons that I could don't have to
[1:38:19] worry about Deacon work and I can just
[1:38:21] be a preacher and a preacher and a
[1:38:23] prayer warrior that's what I'd like to
[1:38:25] be but brother Branham was pastor Deacon
[1:38:28] trusty solid leader for seventeen years
[1:38:30] I can do it for a few more years until
[1:38:32] God raised up some more deacons
[1:38:35] wherefore brethren look ye out among you
[1:38:37] seven men of honest report full the Holy
[1:38:40] Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint
[1:38:41] over this business so giving people food
[1:38:44] every day is a business and that's what
[1:38:47] a deacon office is it's for business but
[1:38:51] we will give ourselves continually to
[1:38:52] the work to prayer and to the Ministry
[1:38:54] of the word so see I want to get the
[1:38:57] spot where I can just give myself to
[1:38:58] prayer and preaching that's all I have
[1:38:59] to do pray and preach pray and preach
[1:39:02] right now I've got a lot more but I'm
[1:39:05] hoping God trusting God will send me
[1:39:07] more deacons and the sang please the
[1:39:10] whole multitude and they chose stephen a
[1:39:12] man full of faith in the Holy Ghost and
[1:39:13] Philip and pro chorus and a mic our and
[1:39:16] timon and parmenas and nicolas a
[1:39:20] proselyte of enik whom they set before
[1:39:22] the apostles when they had prayed they
[1:39:23] laid their hands on them and the Word of
[1:39:24] God increased the number of disciples
[1:39:26] multiplied and Juicin greatly and a
[1:39:28] great company of the priests were
[1:39:29] obedient unto the faith so do
[1:39:31] Ekans arose from the need of people just
[1:39:35] needing food everyday and the preachers
[1:39:37] like well I can't do this I've got to
[1:39:38] study and pray I need to give myself to
[1:39:40] the ministry so they said oh let's let's
[1:39:43] create an office of a deacon
[1:39:45] let's have men that are devoted to the
[1:39:47] business of God now go to first Timothy
[1:39:50] 3 8 through 13 this is what it rose from
[1:40:01] and if we're Christians and we see
[1:40:03] people don't have food and we don't help
[1:40:05] them then we are backslidden Christians
[1:40:07] because these book of Acts Christians
[1:40:09] made a special office just to make sure
[1:40:12] all the believers had food every day
[1:40:14] amen
[1:40:15] you cannot love someone without meeting
[1:40:18] their daily needs I'm gonna say it again
[1:40:21] we cannot love people we cannot be real
[1:40:24] Christians without caring about do they
[1:40:26] have their needs met you can't be a
[1:40:29] Christian without caring about people's
[1:40:31] daily needs I'm sorry I'm in Corinthians
[1:40:36] 1st Timothy 3 8 through 13 sorry about
[1:40:43] that
[1:40:46] likewise must the Deacons be grave not
[1:40:50] double-tongued not given to much wine
[1:40:51] not greedy of filthy lucre holding the
[1:40:55] mystery of the faith in a pure
[1:40:56] conscience and let these also first be
[1:41:00] proved see you gotta watch that Deacon
[1:41:02] for a while I watch that person's this
[1:41:03] one this person worthy to be a deacon
[1:41:06] then let them use the office of a deacon
[1:41:09] being found blameless have to be a
[1:41:11] blameless Christian to be a deacon
[1:41:15] alright I lost my spot verse 11 even so
[1:41:19] must their wives be grave not slanderers
[1:41:21] sober faithful in all things just like a
[1:41:24] pastor a pastor his wife have to be
[1:41:26] faithful so do a deacon and his wife
[1:41:29] have to be faithful let the Deacons be
[1:41:33] the husbands of one wife ruling their
[1:41:35] children and their own house as well so
[1:41:37] deacons at some point have to desire
[1:41:39] children just like brother Brandon
[1:41:42] brother Branham was a pastor before he
[1:41:43] was even married how many know that
[1:41:45] okay now the Bible says a pastor has to
[1:41:48] have children well so we see if brother
[1:41:50] bran was allowed to be a pastor we have
[1:41:52] to apply that to us as well so a person
[1:41:54] can be a pastor or a deacon as long as
[1:41:56] they have plans or a desire to have
[1:41:59] children okay so that's what we said so
[1:42:02] we say for Deacons it's like in the case
[1:42:04] of with Adam and sister both they don't
[1:42:05] have children yet but they desire
[1:42:06] children right they would like to have a
[1:42:08] family just like was the brother cams
[1:42:10] you know brother cam was a pastor before
[1:42:12] he had children he was married but they
[1:42:15] didn't have children yet and then after
[1:42:17] he became pastor then he started having
[1:42:18] children so just so you know just like
[1:42:20] brother Brandon alright verse 13 for
[1:42:24] they that have used the office of a
[1:42:26] deacon well purchased to themselves of a
[1:42:28] good degree and a great boldness in the
[1:42:31] faith which is in Christ Jesus so
[1:42:32] deacons need to be bold which we're
[1:42:35] gonna see why they need to be bold in a
[1:42:36] little bit because they got a guard the
[1:42:39] house of God they're God's policemen for
[1:42:41] the house of God and brother BAM said
[1:42:43] anybody that will get upset with the
[1:42:45] Gauley Deacon has the wrong spirit on
[1:42:46] them in other words if you can't take
[1:42:49] correction from a deacon shame on you
[1:42:51] you got the wrong spirit on you see cuz
[1:42:56] they got to be bold they got to be
[1:42:58] looking out to protect the Spirit of God
[1:42:59] that's in the church these things are
[1:43:04] right unto thee hoping to come under
[1:43:05] these shortly alright
[1:43:07] oh yeah well let's read verse 15 but if
[1:43:10] I tarry long that thou mayest know how
[1:43:11] thou oughtest to behave thyself in the
[1:43:13] house of God which is the Church of the
[1:43:16] Living God the pillar and ground of the
[1:43:18] truth see we need to learn how to behave
[1:43:21] in the house of God that's why God has
[1:43:24] pastors that's why God has deacons the
[1:43:26] deacons gonna help us learn how to
[1:43:27] behave in the house of God all right now
[1:43:31] they asked well around this question now
[1:43:32] before I do that let me go this is our
[1:43:35] bylaws this is a mystery brother Adam I
[1:43:37] thought I emailed it to you okay this is
[1:43:41] what our bylaws say because we have to
[1:43:42] have bylaws according to the government
[1:43:44] the office of a deacon will consistent
[1:43:47] maintain the spiritual and natural wear
[1:43:48] welfare the assembly they shall assist
[1:43:51] the president that's what the government
[1:43:53] calls the pastor they call the pastor
[1:43:54] the president whoever is the head of the
[1:43:56] group is called the president like the
[1:43:57] president and CEO of you know
[1:43:59] Microsoft or whatever they just had that
[1:44:01] title so I'm the present here but I
[1:44:03] don't walk around saying oh I'm the
[1:44:04] president you know yippie or you know I
[1:44:07] don't do that they show sis the
[1:44:08] president and all the duties required
[1:44:10] they shall police the church keeping
[1:44:12] this assembly in accordance to the Word
[1:44:14] of God in reverence that's one of their
[1:44:16] main jobs to keep it reverent in here
[1:44:17] they must fulfil the qualification
[1:44:20] scripturally outlined and what we just
[1:44:21] read there is a minimum one-year
[1:44:24] membership at the Assembly to re-review
[1:44:26] qualified they must also assist in
[1:44:28] serving communion to act as asurs at all
[1:44:30] services so communion of course is
[1:44:33] helping you know with the the wine the
[1:44:36] bread and also if someone needs a seat
[1:44:38] the deacon has to help them find their
[1:44:39] seat they show okay we're yeah okay yeah
[1:44:45] they should be ready anytime to assist
[1:44:47] the need of every saint whose burden and
[1:44:49] a need of spiritual consultation or
[1:44:51] general welfare they have no authority
[1:44:55] to spend church funds except for food
[1:44:58] clothing and financial help to the needy
[1:45:00] so they're not to pay the bills the
[1:45:02] treasurer is supposed to pay the bills
[1:45:04] they shall be voted on once per year by
[1:45:07] the congregation to remain in their
[1:45:08] service they shall hold offices until
[1:45:10] their successors are duly elected and
[1:45:12] qualified if there is a replacement now
[1:45:15] listen this is during the absence or
[1:45:17] disability of the president or pastor
[1:45:18] the deacons should exercise all the
[1:45:21] powers and discharge all the duties of
[1:45:24] the President so if I get sick or I go
[1:45:28] down the Deacon runs the church they
[1:45:32] exercise all the authority of the
[1:45:35] president if I'm sick and I can't
[1:45:36] exercise that authority or I can't you
[1:45:39] know I'm in a coma or something like
[1:45:40] that they have to take over because
[1:45:43] they're the next high office behind the
[1:45:45] pastor never understand that alright so
[1:45:49] let's look at that question how far
[1:45:51] brother Branham can or should a deacon
[1:45:53] go to keep order in the church should we
[1:45:56] keep the order or wait until brother
[1:45:58] Nevel tells us what we should do so I
[1:46:00] might exceed this answer and then we'll
[1:46:02] close of this oops sorry wrong
[1:46:12] I was looking at another scripture just
[1:46:17] a moment Carmy
[1:46:25] okay I know it's really small
[1:46:30] you don't strain your eyes I don't think
[1:46:31] I can make that any bigger can I know um
[1:46:35] so that's brother brand that should we
[1:46:37] wait for the brother brother Nevel to
[1:46:38] tell us what to do and he said that
[1:46:40] isn't brother Neville's job that's your
[1:46:42] job
[1:46:43] see you don't tell brother Neville what
[1:46:45] to preach on how to preach see that's
[1:46:47] your job you deacons you're supposed to
[1:46:48] do that you take care of that that's
[1:46:50] nothing - brother Neville that's your
[1:46:51] job now he gives a nice illustration if
[1:46:55] a policeman's out here on the street and
[1:46:57] he sees a man stealing property out of
[1:46:58] the back of a car should he call the
[1:47:00] mayor and say now mayor your honor sir
[1:47:02] I'm working out here for you on the
[1:47:04] police force now I find a man up on the
[1:47:06] street he's stealing some of the tires
[1:47:08] off a car last night now I just wonder
[1:47:10] what's your opinion of that huh he said
[1:47:14] see that wouldn't be sensible would it
[1:47:17] no sir if he's doing something wrong
[1:47:20] arrest him see a deacon has to sense
[1:47:24] when someone's doing wrong and breaking
[1:47:27] the reference of the church I've had to
[1:47:31] do in the last few years I've had to go
[1:47:33] to people children playing with toys you
[1:47:36] know I love the children but if they're
[1:47:38] playing with toys I'm the one that's got
[1:47:39] to say I've had to do that right and
[1:47:47] then ask people to move seats from time
[1:47:48] to time you know if we come in there
[1:47:51] there's more people there's lack of
[1:47:52] seats or something like that to ask
[1:47:54] people to move if a child is being
[1:47:59] really loud sometimes I'll walk over you
[1:48:01] know to somebody with the child whether
[1:48:02] it's a man or woman I'll say can I help
[1:48:04] you with the child
[1:48:05] well if they're really loud I anticipate
[1:48:08] where they're gonna need to leave and
[1:48:09] then I'll be ready to open the door so
[1:48:11] they can walk out without without having
[1:48:13] opened the door just to save them a step
[1:48:16] if people are dropped you know if
[1:48:19] children drop things or something like
[1:48:20] that or children are running I'll try to
[1:48:21] whisper say
[1:48:22] running here please don't run here so as
[1:48:27] a deacon you have to be sensitive to the
[1:48:29] move of the Holy Spirit those are just
[1:48:31] some small examples now if a man's doing
[1:48:35] some wrong in the church here or anybody
[1:48:37] stop them and talk to them don't be
[1:48:41] arrogant but if they won't listen speak
[1:48:43] in a way that they know what you're
[1:48:45] saying see like you tell a child walk
[1:48:48] back there walk back there and he's
[1:48:51] misbehaving
[1:48:52] Deacon's nature place there's four of
[1:48:55] you now programs talking the Deacons he
[1:48:56] said there's two of you in the front and
[1:48:58] there's two in the back he's sitting on
[1:49:01] the corners or something like that watch
[1:49:03] real clothes for renegades and
[1:49:05] everything else coming like this you see
[1:49:07] and you be on the guard you just get
[1:49:09] your post to duty stay there that's your
[1:49:10] seat or stand right there beside the
[1:49:12] wall and watch everybody who comes in
[1:49:14] now especially in this day when people
[1:49:16] are walking to churches with guns and
[1:49:18] just murdering people how many
[1:49:21] understand we need deacons today we need
[1:49:23] deacons that will stand the door and try
[1:49:25] to stop somebody in case they come in we
[1:49:30] need deacons to protect the people now
[1:49:34] he said have two in the front two in the
[1:49:35] back well if we have just Adam and I you
[1:49:38] know and I'm preaching now I want Adam
[1:49:40] sent right back at the back door case
[1:49:43] anybody comes in or case of child is
[1:49:44] running in or in case he needs to help
[1:49:46] somebody leave or something like that
[1:49:47] and in our church and other churches you
[1:49:50] have to watch the hallway you know when
[1:49:52] little children leave sometimes they get
[1:49:53] distracted or sometimes we've had in the
[1:49:55] past where children have left out and
[1:49:57] we're not sure which ones but they leave
[1:49:59] out and they do little tricks and little
[1:50:01] stunts and they do things out there they
[1:50:04] mess around and you know just mess up
[1:50:06] things and they're just playing around
[1:50:08] because they don't want to come in here
[1:50:09] to church well Deacon needs to take care
[1:50:11] and find out who's doing that and chase
[1:50:13] them down
[1:50:14] and make sure they're and make sure the
[1:50:16] people aren't talking the bathroom you
[1:50:18] know we're talking too loud or just not
[1:50:21] there not being reverent well the band
[1:50:23] said if you want a fellowship he said go
[1:50:25] out to your home he said this is the
[1:50:27] place where we fellowship with God you
[1:50:30] have little conversations but keep your
[1:50:32] conversation short out there we're here
[1:50:34] to talk to God
[1:50:36] and this is actually in this sermon but
[1:50:38] I don't have time to get to it a deacon
[1:50:41] takes care of the house of God someone
[1:50:42] to come in speak to them be there to
[1:50:44] greet them so like a chef feel they have
[1:50:46] deacons right at the door to shake your
[1:50:47] hand when you come in gonna take your
[1:50:49] coat know but Adam if he gets elected
[1:50:51] all right I can't do that if I'm elected
[1:50:52] usually I'm up here praying or in the
[1:50:54] songs ready I wish we had more deacons
[1:50:56] to do that we could use more deacons he
[1:50:59] said see you're the policemen can I show
[1:51:01] you to the cloakroom
[1:51:03] would you be seated could could we hand
[1:51:06] you a songbook or something now we like
[1:51:08] for you to enjoy yourself and pray we're
[1:51:10] happy you're here with us tonight lead
[1:51:12] them down to a place and would you like
[1:51:14] to be closer would you like to be back
[1:51:15] there whatever more that's hospitality a
[1:51:19] policeman is a military police to the
[1:51:22] Army courtesy yet with authority see you
[1:51:27] know what a military police is actually
[1:51:29] if he carries out his rights I think
[1:51:31] he's like our chaplain you see it's
[1:51:32] courtesy and everything but yet he has
[1:51:35] an authority you must mind him these
[1:51:37] rookies they get out there and get drunk
[1:51:38] why he puts them in their place and so
[1:51:40] as a deacon to put them in their place
[1:51:43] now remember the Deacon is a policeman
[1:51:45] and a deacons office is actually more
[1:51:48] strict than any office in the church he
[1:51:51] says there it is I don't know of any
[1:51:53] office any more stricter than the
[1:51:55] Deacons office so a deacon is supposed
[1:51:59] to be nitpicky and the church said off
[1:52:03] to repeat that on Sunday to make sure I
[1:52:04] hear everybody say Amen
[1:52:06] a deacon is actually more strict and
[1:52:09] picky about reverence than even the
[1:52:10] pastor's see why because he's got a real
[1:52:18] job he's God's man he's God's man just
[1:52:23] as much as the pastor is God's man
[1:52:28] certainly he is God's servant now he
[1:52:33] just goes through and he says you don't
[1:52:34] ask brother Nevel you know if you have
[1:52:36] to ask brother Nevel how to do a deacon
[1:52:38] work you should know and he can work his
[1:52:39] and so brother Adam does get elected on
[1:52:42] Sunday then I'll probably take next
[1:52:43] Wednesday and go over some more deacon
[1:52:44] concerns because we could really
[1:52:49] some help by God's grace okay let's stay
[1:52:53] on our feet by God's grace I'm gonna
[1:52:57] pass these out and then you can look up
[1:53:00] here if you like up I'm going to pass
[1:53:01] these out this is just the rough draft
[1:53:06] in the ballot I'm just gonna give them
[1:53:08] to the people vote on Sunday I guess I'm
[1:53:27] an email list everybody and that it
[1:53:28] can't be here I will give one week to
[1:53:30] get it in they can email it to brother
[1:53:31] van or myself so the first one is pastor
[1:53:34] you can either check for myself I'm the
[1:53:36] current officer or you can check pray
[1:53:38] and wait for another different pastor
[1:53:40] for that crow ministry or can check and
[1:53:42] write something else in like I think
[1:53:44] so-and-so should be pastor you can do
[1:53:45] that you can write whatever you want a
[1:53:47] deacons I swear it's different this year
[1:53:49] I'm the first name I'm a current
[1:53:51] officers a deacon brother Adams name is
[1:53:54] up there and yeah it has to get 2/3 of
[1:53:57] the vote to be a deacon so I know how
[1:54:00] many people would pay ties so I'll take
[1:54:02] that number and to find the percentage
[1:54:05] what's what's 2/3 percentage of that he
[1:54:09] gets two thirds of the vote then he
[1:54:10] you'd be a deacon for us for a year the
[1:54:14] next one this is where my format gets
[1:54:15] really awful right here it should be it
[1:54:18] should be on the left not centered but
[1:54:20] trustee we just have to right now we
[1:54:22] could use in another of course we could
[1:54:24] use we will use more deacons we can use
[1:54:26] more trustees but brother van and I are
[1:54:28] current trustees you can turn the page
[1:54:34] treasurer I really don't want to be the
[1:54:36] treasurer but no one else wants to be
[1:54:38] the treasurer so I have to it doesn't
[1:54:40] the taxman said that doesn't look good
[1:54:42] so I hope I don't get audited but I'm
[1:54:44] the only one that wants to do it
[1:54:45] which I understand I understand there's
[1:54:48] a lot involved with money you know then
[1:54:49] you know everybody's giving and it kind
[1:54:51] of got a battle you know in your mind
[1:54:52] you huh but I'm glad people give you
[1:54:55] know we're glad people get but if
[1:54:57] anybody wants to be a treasurer
[1:54:58] I'll write their name and no one's let
[1:55:00] me know that they want to be treasurer
[1:55:01] but any man that's qualified is open
[1:55:03] to do that and sunday-school burn Sunday
[1:55:06] School Superintendent that's me as well
[1:55:08] now we haven't had Sunday school since
[1:55:10] the beginning of I think it was May
[1:55:17] because we didn't have families bringing
[1:55:19] their children for like a month or five
[1:55:21] weeks so I said dude I'm just gonna stop
[1:55:23] Sunday school because people aren't
[1:55:25] coming and I understand if they've you
[1:55:27] know they've had you know new children
[1:55:30] or they live two hours away or something
[1:55:33] like that you know I understand but it's
[1:55:36] got to be a burden of the people if the
[1:55:37] bird if the people have a burden to come
[1:55:39] to Sunday school which I hope we do this
[1:55:42] coming year I'm willing to teach it
[1:55:44] again by God's grace but the people have
[1:55:47] to be willing to make a sacrifice I
[1:55:49] can't force anybody to come you know
[1:55:51] what I mean I can I can beg them I can
[1:55:53] preach about it but I can't force
[1:55:55] anybody to come they have to make an
[1:55:56] active sacrifice they have to put Christ
[1:55:59] as a higher priority than anything else
[1:56:03] and then lastly there's four options
[1:56:06] there if you want to request a personal
[1:56:09] interview with me if your sister I've
[1:56:11] got my wife sit in and you want to
[1:56:13] discuss questions or concerns I'll sit
[1:56:15] down with anybody just let me know the
[1:56:18] second one if you feel someone's not
[1:56:19] qualified you want to talk to me about
[1:56:22] it check that I'll talk to you bout it
[1:56:23] if you feel someone new might might be
[1:56:26] qualified and want to recommend them and
[1:56:28] want to talk to me about it let me know
[1:56:29] and then I want everybody check that
[1:56:32] last one if you completed this with
[1:56:34] sincerity based on your leadership of
[1:56:36] the Holy Ghost and then just sign your
[1:56:38] name you give this to bang or I but not
[1:56:41] this I'm gonna give you a different
[1:56:42] sheet this is just the rough draft you
[1:56:43] know I'm gonna make it look better I
[1:56:45] said that much time you know before
[1:56:47] church okay there's any questions about
[1:56:50] that just yes sister Connie yeah
[1:57:10] no yeah I know what you mean yeah no
[1:57:13] that won't take away because I still
[1:57:15] know the total number of people voting
[1:57:17] as long as yet but he asked to have two
[1:57:19] thirds just like I have to have two
[1:57:20] thirds to know when we divide it
[1:57:27] everybody has an individual vote ever
[1:57:30] have an individual so yeah yeah I
[1:57:34] appreciate that it's good question if it
[1:57:36] has an individual opportunity how many
[1:57:42] know the Deacon is God's man he's just
[1:57:46] as much God's man as the pastor is God's
[1:57:49] man unappreciated godly deacon I
[1:57:52] appreciate a godly pastor I'd appreciate
[1:57:55] a galley treasure and Sunday School
[1:57:57] Superintendent that's what we want we
[1:58:00] just want godly people in the officers
[1:58:03] of God and I tell you I could use the
[1:58:04] help I've said it you know off and on
[1:58:06] over last couple years I don't want to
[1:58:08] fill all these offices other than pastor
[1:58:10] I don't actually I actually I do want to
[1:58:13] be a trustee I do wanna be a trustee is
[1:58:15] then I have a say in the direction of
[1:58:16] the church if I see like something's
[1:58:18] wrong or you know voting and different
[1:58:21] things like that should we do this
[1:58:22] should we rent this buy this or whatever
