[2:21] uh in Psalms
[2:25] 23 God laid on my heart this morning it
[2:27] says in Psalms 23 the Lord is my
[2:30] shepherd I shall not
[2:32] want isn't that ever true The Lord Is
[2:35] Our Shepherd and we shall not want if we
[2:39] he will take care of us if we trust him
[2:41] it says seek ye first the kingdom of God
[2:43] in his righteousness and all things
[2:45] shall be added unto
[2:47] you we're serving the wonderful
[2:51] God in verse two he says he maketh me to
[2:54] lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me
[2:56] beside Still Waters he restoreth my soul
[3:00] he leadth me in the paths of
[3:02] righteousness for his name's
[3:05] sake yeay though I walk through the
[3:07] valley of the shadow of death I will
[3:09] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[3:11] rod and thy staff they comfort me amen
[3:14] isn't that ever true
[3:18] amen I like to be on the Mountaintop I
[3:20] like the Mountaintop
[3:22] experiences but you know
[3:24] what I think I grow more if he takes me
[3:28] through the valley amen
[3:30] yes that we need to trust him if we're
[3:32] on the Mountaintop we might not be
[3:35] trusting him like we do if we go through
[3:37] trials and
[3:38] tribulations but God wants us to trust
[3:41] to truly trust him in all things and he
[3:44] will take care of us yes
[3:49] Lord it says Thou preparest a table
[3:52] before me in the presence of my enemies
[3:54] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[3:57] run us over surely goodness and mercy
[4:00] shall follow me all the days of my life
[4:02] and I will dwell in the house of the
[4:04] Lord forever
[4:07] amen the word of God is true it's sure
[4:10] we can stand on it it it will it's just
[4:14] so wonderful to just believe the word
[4:17] and Trust the word of God it says in
[4:20] beginning was the word and the Word was
[4:22] with God and God was the
[4:24] word isn't that true if God is the word
[4:28] why why don't we want want to eat the
[4:32] word amen it it says Us in in the Book
[4:35] of Revelation says us eat the little
[4:37] book yes that's open for us thank God
[4:42] thank you
[4:47] Lord I didn't know Jesse was keeping
[4:50] track how many times he came to preach
[4:52] for
[4:53] us but that's okay he said 17 times and
[4:57] I I remember one evening he came and
[4:59] down and he baptized 17 people that
[5:02] evening isn't that
[5:09] something glory
[5:14] amen it was hard for
[5:19] me to
[5:21] stop and think the things that we were
[5:24] taught a lot of them were wrong that's
[5:27] right
[5:34] but praise the
[5:36] Lord God sees our hearts yes if we truly
[5:40] want him yes he will make a way
[5:44] Hallelujah he did for the children of
[5:46] Israel he brought the children of Israel
[5:48] out of Egypt out of bondage and that's
[5:51] what he's doing today he's leading
[5:52] people to himself he's leading people
[5:55] out of bondage out of denominations
[6:01] right
[6:03] Hallelujah we can truly trust the word
[6:06] once I started see in that that we can
[6:08] truly trust trust the word and that's
[6:11] the only thing I want to trust it's the
[6:13] word trust God he's going
[6:17] to he knows his sheep and his sheep hear
[6:20] his voice and they follow him amen yes
[6:24] sir
[6:26] yes
[6:28] GL so who is here that's trying to
[6:31] distract us from that it is Satan the
[6:34] Old Devil that's trying to get us away
[6:36] from the word and just to mix if he can
[6:39] get us to believe one lie he's got us
[6:43] that's what happened back in the Garden
[6:45] of Eden yes sir the trees he he said we
[6:48] may freely eat of the trees all except
[6:50] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[6:52] don't eat of this
[6:55] tree brothers and sister isn't that tree
[6:58] still available today that's right amen
[7:01] it is that tree is still available for
[7:03] us to eat today the tree of what the
[7:06] tree of knowledge right and what does
[7:10] the Bible say about knowledge it says
[7:12] knowledge puffers
[7:13] up amen we're not supposed to eat of
[7:16] that
[7:16] tree this is one thing that that we're
[7:19] learning we can we can memorize this
[7:22] whole book every word in
[7:26] here we can believe every story yes
[7:29] right up in our heads in knowledge
[7:34] right but it's not going to do us any
[7:41] good we're meeting
[7:44] people they're people struggling with us
[7:46] they think we're on the wrong path right
[7:50] after we receive true Freedom after we
[7:53] received the true word of
[7:54] God but brothers and sisters that's
[7:57] exactly how it was with Jesus when Jesus
[7:59] was walking here on Earth how many
[8:01] people received
[8:03] him very few that's right very few some
[8:06] said
[8:08] he's castes out uh Devils by Bells
[8:12] didn't they yeah they said they they
[8:14] mocked him on the cross they spit on
[8:20] him we can be very thankful if God
[8:24] opened our eyes if we're truly following
[8:26] him Hallelujah
[8:32] I'm going to turn
[8:33] to something that we're just realizing
[8:36] lately that was more uh precious and
[8:39] more powerful than we thought it was and
[8:42] this was before just before we uh
[8:46] received
[8:48] the the pro the books about the book
[8:50] about the prophet or thing two years ago
[8:53] I didn't know anything about that God
[8:55] send a
[8:57] prophet I didn't know anything about
[8:59] about that we never heard anything about
[9:01] this
[9:04] man but I'm going to read here in
[9:06] Matthew 16 I think that this is a in a
[9:09] scripture that is very important to us
[9:12] when in Matthew 16 I'm going to start in
[9:15] verse
[9:17] 14 it says and they said some say thou
[9:20] art John the Baptist some Elias and
[9:22] Jeremiah well I should read verse 13
[9:26] when Jesus came into the coast of
[9:27] cesaria Philippi they asked he asked his
[9:30] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[9:34] the son of man
[9:37] am and they said some say thou art John
[9:40] the Baptist some Elias and others
[9:42] Jeremiah or one of the
[9:44] prophets isn't that how it is
[9:47] today we can ask people questions and
[9:50] we'll get different
[9:52] answers but brothers and
[9:57] sisters I think one of the most
[9:59] important things to pray for is that we
[10:01] get
[10:03] Revelation from God what this word
[10:05] actually means siru because this word is
[10:08] not going to
[10:11] change who's got to
[10:13] change we have to change we have to
[10:16] align ourselves with the word of
[10:19] God amen amen that's right
[10:22] brother so then Jesus asks the question
[10:25] he says unto them but whom say ye that I
[10:27] am
[10:29] we all need to ask us that question who
[10:33] do we say that Jesus
[10:37] is amen do we know him Hallelujah
[10:40] brothers and sisters
[10:42] I we can say we believe the message but
[10:45] that doesn't say we're a Christian
[10:47] that's right that's right amen that can
[10:49] be just another denomination yes sir but
[10:53] do we see that we are special people
[10:57] that he created us that he loves us
[10:59] that he cares for
[11:01] us and can we see that he's working in
[11:05] our lives yes brothers and sisters
[11:07] that's why we need that's what I'm
[11:09] seeing if we believe the word the word
[11:12] starts to clean us hallelujah we cannot
[11:15] clean
[11:15] ourself that's right sir how many people
[11:18] tried I did I've tried to do
[11:22] better did it work no it didn't work
[11:33] it's like an old oak
[11:37] tree we all know Falls here Falls
[11:41] coming the old oak tree hangs through
[11:44] its Leaf a lot of leaves will be hanging
[11:46] there maybe towards
[11:48] Spring that's
[11:50] right we don't need to go out and pull
[11:53] them
[11:54] off they'll probably go through a lot of
[11:57] wind and storms this winter they're cold
[11:59] but there's still going to be something
[12:00] hanging on there till next spring and
[12:02] what's going to bring them
[12:05] off the
[12:08] springtime Springtime isn't that what we
[12:11] need in our lives we need more
[12:13] Springtime in our lives when the the
[12:16] life comes out of the ground comes up
[12:18] the new leaves start to grow and the old
[12:21] fall off that's the way it is if we get
[12:24] the Holy Spirit into our lives and
[12:25] starts working it'll clean us from the
[12:28] inside out Our Lives will be
[12:30] changing and who gets the credit for it
[12:34] God
[12:37] Amen it says our works are as filthy
[12:41] rags praise the Lord
[12:47] hallelujah Jesus answered and said unto
[12:49] them and and he asked Peter who do you
[12:52] say that I am and Simon Peter answered
[12:55] and said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[12:57] the Living God now listen what Jesus
[13:00] said and Jesus answered and said unto
[13:02] him blessed art thou Simon bonah for
[13:06] flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[13:08] thee but my Father which is in
[13:11] heaven that's for us hallelujah BL and
[13:15] sisters we're seeing this and then Jesus
[13:21] said and I see unto thee that thou art
[13:24] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[13:28] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[13:30] Prevail against
[13:33] it I think it was January a year ago
[13:36] January 23 one morning I was having
[13:40] devotions and God gave me that
[13:42] Revelation and brothers and sisters
[13:44] that's a wonderful Revelation to have
[13:47] Hallelujah God
[13:50] Amen we can talk to people we can share
[13:53] the gospel but if people don't have the
[13:56] Revelation what God is building his
[13:59] church
[14:02] on we can't tell them that's right they
[14:05] cannot understand the scripture the
[14:07] natural mind cannot understand it we can
[14:11] try to read the word and read and study
[14:15] it let's pray for Revelation to reveal
[14:19] to reveal the mystery what's laying in
[14:21] the
[14:22] word doesn't the Bible say it's hid from
[14:26] people yes it is
[14:31] amen my thinking of the word of God is
[14:35] different than it was two years
[14:41] ago I was born
[14:43] again I became born again when I 36
[14:46] years
[14:47] old but I stayed in denominations I
[14:50] didn't know
[14:52] better and it seems to
[14:56] me that that Veil
[14:59] kept the Holy Spirit from truly working
[15:02] in my
[15:07] life because once I got this Revelation
[15:10] things started to change and God God
[15:13] gave us more Revelation
[15:17] amen sometimes it keeps coming and
[15:19] coming on the way up
[15:23] um God gave me a new thought on
[15:25] something that I never realized before
[15:28] in the Bible
[15:30] it was when
[15:32] David the little boy David when came in
[15:36] and said he will go fight this big
[15:41] Philistine you know what Saul
[15:43] did he put his armor and Stu on David
[15:47] his shield and stuff and David wasn't
[15:49] comfortable with it right
[15:52] right David didn't trust in
[15:55] that isn't that exactly what it is in a
[15:58] denom where Creeds and dogmas are formed
[16:02] I never thought of that till this
[16:03] morning I just always thought well David
[16:05] wasn't comfortable in this he wasn't
[16:06] used to this but isn't that exactly what
[16:09] what it does if we add Creeds and dog
[16:12] rules and regulations to our lives and
[16:15] try to make us bit it didn't work where
[16:19] did David have his
[16:20] trust in the Lord amen so he picked up
[16:25] five Stones he took his staff and he
[16:28] went out
[16:29] and the Philistine giant he mocked him
[16:32] didn't he yeah but what
[16:35] happened David said I come to you in the
[16:39] name of the Lord of
[16:41] hosts
[16:43] amen that's where our power is brothers
[16:46] and sisters Amen in the name of the Lord
[16:49] Jesus Christ that's where the power is
[16:52] not stoping thing of this where did that
[16:54] stone
[16:55] hit it hit Goliath right up here in the
[16:58] head
[16:59] where the knowledge
[17:01] is
[17:05] amen he lost his
[17:09] life we can take a lesson to that yes
[17:13] yes sir this is one thing when I used to
[17:15] read the
[17:16] Bible and I think many people
[17:19] do and it was stories it was just one
[17:23] story after another but brothers and
[17:25] sisters the Bible is written for me amen
[17:28] the Bible is written for
[17:30] you can we see
[17:32] ourselves yes right can we see ourselves
[17:35] in every story in the
[17:38] Bible it's written to help us to lead
[17:41] and to guide and to direct usen in the
[17:44] next verse he says and I will give unto
[17:45] thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[17:48] and whatsoever you shall bind on Earth
[17:50] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[17:52] you shall lose on Earth shall be loose
[17:53] on Heaven the verse before that it says
[17:55] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[17:57] against it God is building his church
[18:00] Upon This Rock The Rock is the
[18:02] revelation of the word so that's where
[18:04] he's building his church on so our faith
[18:07] will be in that and the gates of hell
[18:09] and nobody's going to be able to take it
[18:11] away once God reveals something to us
[18:14] nobody can take it away not even the
[18:16] gates the demons from hell cannot even
[18:18] take that away That's How Strong a rock
[18:21] is that's what he's talking about and
[18:24] how important it is to stand on that and
[18:27] we will start believing even that yes
[18:30] what is the number one
[18:32] sin
[18:34] unbelief that's why the children of
[18:36] israels a lot of them didn't enter only
[18:38] Josh and Caleb and the young people
[18:40] entered the land of Canaan because of
[18:43] unbelief
[18:51] yes there's a lot of things lessons to
[18:54] be taken out of the children of Israel's
[18:56] story
[19:02] when they came to the Red
[19:04] Sea what
[19:07] happened do we have Red Seas sometime in
[19:09] our lives yeah things look impossible
[19:16] right but God was with them amen Moses
[19:21] held his staff out over the waters and
[19:23] the waters P separated yes and they
[19:26] could walk through on dry land isn't
[19:29] that something did everybody make it
[19:32] through
[19:34] right the enemy didn't make it right
[19:37] because they didn't believe amen
[19:43] sir so one thing we
[19:45] noticed fast forward as Josh and Caleb
[19:49] it
[19:50] says when the 12 Spies were sent over to
[19:54] inspect the land
[19:58] 10 of them came back with a negative
[20:00] report yes sir didn't they all see the
[20:04] same same thing the same land yes isn't
[20:07] that exactly how it is but Josh and
[20:09] Caleb said if God is with us we can
[20:11] overtake
[20:13] them but the Bible says according to
[20:16] their
[20:17] words this what happened right yes let's
[20:22] remember that our words are powerful
[20:24] amen
[20:26] negative and positive Hallelujah the
[20:29] power
[20:31] is lies in our tongue right death and
[20:34] life
[20:37] yes but the other thing I want to bring
[20:39] out of that it says there was a
[20:40] different there was a different spirit
[20:43] in Josh and KB
[20:46] Hallelujah so I hope that spirit is in
[20:48] each one of us
[20:50] today amen we need that Spirit yeah
[20:54] it'll give us a different Outlook in
[20:56] life how we look at things how we read
[20:59] the Bible
[21:04] Hallelujah so they could enter because
[21:08] they
[21:12] believe so we're struggling life if
[21:14] we're if we're in disbelief we're
[21:16] probably going around in desert like the
[21:18] children of Israel did around and around
[21:21] and we we can't grow we can't move
[21:24] forward so sometimes we got to stop and
[21:27] take inventory why am I doing
[21:30] this what's wrong in my
[21:32] life we've had that happen in our lives
[21:35] already even since we started believing
[21:37] the true word that Satan comes and tries
[21:40] to get us to doubt he brings
[21:42] discouragement or something like that
[21:44] and if you receive it there's only one
[21:46] way to
[21:47] go and that's down maybe you're
[21:51] discouraged maybe you get depressed and
[21:53] then it starts to time to start
[21:56] searching where am I going why am I
[21:58] going down the road like this am I not
[22:01] trusting my
[22:04] maker did I believe a lie somewhere in
[22:07] my
[22:09] life Satan can be so tricky he can get
[22:12] us to to believe a
[22:14] lie I know a brother that he he got
[22:17] freedom and he was doing a lot better
[22:20] than then a person came to him and he
[22:22] said oh you can be careful that you
[22:24] don't be
[22:25] deceived and he believed that lie
[22:29] right but you know what the devil
[22:32] did he didn't put his mind on what he
[22:36] believed he his mind went on other
[22:38] things that he struggled with like with
[22:41] sexual problems and things like that his
[22:43] mind was focused on
[22:45] there and the devil had him trapped
[22:50] yes till one day a person came and
[22:52] prayed for him and helped him and in
[22:55] other words they prayed and God revealed
[22:56] to him what happened where the door was
[22:58] that he believed a liee so he repented
[23:01] the lie and that took care of the other
[23:03] things went
[23:04] away praise the
[23:14] Lord so that's for all of
[23:18] us am we're on a
[23:24] journey one thing I noticed the enemy
[23:27] doesn't have to do
[23:29] anything in our lives if he has
[23:32] us but once we receive the truth the
[23:36] truth will make us
[23:38] free once we receive the truth then he's
[23:41] going to try to stumble us
[23:49] right so what I want to bring out here
[23:52] and and about the Revelation on Upon
[23:54] This Rock I'll build my
[23:57] church we we've noticed already that
[23:59] people that know the scriptures a whole
[24:01] lot better than I
[24:04] do they they TR they know the scriptures
[24:07] they but then they AR they ask question
[24:09] well why this why
[24:11] that and we came to the conclusion that
[24:13] there's no use
[24:15] trying to even tell
[24:18] somebody if they don't want it that's
[24:21] right that's right it says if the only
[24:25] way that we can come to God is if he
[24:28] us so I think the most important
[24:32] important part for me is to pray for
[24:34] people that God will open their eyes
[24:37] open their heart and draw them to
[24:39] him and if he wants us to speak a word
[24:42] let's be available to speak a word or
[24:44] share but let's not be arguing or de
[24:48] debating about the word of God because
[24:50] unless God opens her eyes we cannot see
[24:53] itall
[25:09] how many people are glad this morning
[25:11] that he came to seek and save those that
[25:13] are
[25:15] lost
[25:17] amen I
[25:21] am
[25:22] God's church or bride doesn't look the
[25:26] way I thought it would look years
[25:30] ago yes
[25:32] sir it's
[25:35] sad but if you stop and think when Jesus
[25:38] was here walking on
[25:42] Earth talking to people healing
[25:47] people he was right there in their midst
[25:50] and a lot of people couldn't see it a
[25:53] lot of people couldn't see it but they
[25:55] were going to church they're trying to
[25:57] keep the law yes sir does the law free
[26:03] us absolutely not what's the law good
[26:08] for to reveal to us what sin is yes sir
[26:12] yes sir isn't it yes sir that's what
[26:15] Paul said if it wouldn't been for the
[26:18] law I would have known
[26:19] that covetousness or lust whatever he
[26:22] said is sin that's right so the
[26:25] law is a mirror we can look into the law
[26:28] and the law condemns us but if that's
[26:30] all we see we're still condemned that's
[26:33] right so we need to turn to Jesus amen
[26:35] did Jesus pay for every sin
[26:39] amen isn't that a lie from the devil to
[26:42] try to get us to believe that we have
[26:44] sinned so much we've failed so much that
[26:46] we cannot be
[26:48] forgiven brother that's from the enemy
[26:50] brothers and sisters yes sir
[26:53] good he paid for all sin when Jesus said
[26:57] it is finished
[26:58] it was finished his blood thank you
[27:01] Jesus
[27:08] Hallelujah is that what the Bible says
[27:11] is that true how do we know unless we
[27:14] look into the Bible yes sir it says here
[27:17] in Luke
[27:18] 7 I'll start in verse 36 it said and
[27:21] want the Pharisees writed him that he
[27:23] would eat with him and he went into the
[27:26] Pharisees house and sat down to meet
[27:29] and behold a woman in the city which was
[27:32] a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at
[27:35] meat in the Pharisees house brought an
[27:37] Alam box of ointment and stood At His
[27:40] Feet behind him weeping and began to
[27:42] wash his
[27:45] feet with
[27:46] tears and that wipe them with the hair
[27:50] of her head and kissed his feet and
[27:54] anointed them with ointment
[28:01] two different Spirits right yes sir good
[28:05] a Pharisee spirit and a person that seen
[28:08] I'm a sinner I'm lost and I need
[28:11] jesusall she fell at his feet started
[28:14] weeping and washing jesus' feet
[28:22] Hallelujah doesn't the Bible say we all
[28:24] have sinned and fallen short of the
[28:26] glory of God hallelujah
[28:28] amen it does
[28:35] yes and when the
[28:37] Pharisees which were bitten saw it he
[28:41] spake within himself saying this man if
[28:43] he were a prophet would have known who
[28:46] and what manner of woman this is that
[28:50] touched him for she is a sinner and
[28:53] Jesus answering said unto him Simon I
[28:57] have somewhat to say against
[28:59] thee and he says Master say
[29:02] on and then he said there were certain
[29:05] creditor which had two dectors and one
[29:07] owed 500 pens and the other 50 and when
[29:11] he had nothing to pay he frankly forgave
[29:13] them both tell me therefore which of
[29:16] them will love the
[29:18] most Simon answered and said I suppose
[29:22] that he to whom he forgave the most and
[29:25] he said unto him thou H has judged right
[29:28] L isn't that true yes
[29:34] sir if we're in debt if we buy a house
[29:38] or a farm and we go in debt a million
[29:42] dollars or if we're in debt
[29:44] $50,000 and Jesus came and forgave both
[29:47] of them which one will love the most yes
[29:50] sir probably the one that was a million
[29:53] dollars in debt right yes sir but there
[29:56] wasn't much hope for that to get out
[29:57] right unless you had a real good
[30:00] income but take that spiritually and
[30:03] that's who we
[30:05] are
[30:07] Hallelujah without
[30:10] Jesus yes but if we turn to him can we
[30:13] be
[30:15] Saints amen can we be
[30:19] free if Jesus will set us free we will
[30:22] be free indeed
[30:24] right and it says in Hebrews there is a
[30:27] rest for the people of God brothers and
[30:30] sisters that rest can start right
[30:34] today we can
[30:36] rest I think a lot of people in the
[30:39] world today are suffering from
[30:45] sicknesses from back AES from a lot of
[30:47] things because they're not resting in
[30:50] the
[30:52] Lord I truly believe and we've
[30:54] experienced things like that once we
[30:56] started trusting God and rest ing in in
[30:59] God even our bodies start relaxing and
[31:02] things start to change
[31:04] Hallelujah that's
[31:06] right there's so many things there's so
[31:09] many types and stuff in the Bible it
[31:11] just it's just the way it
[31:23] is there's another story I want to touch
[31:28] on that I think is a very important
[31:30] story that will tie into this and that's
[31:32] in John 4 about the
[31:39] woman in John 4:8 it says for his
[31:42] disciples were going away unto the city
[31:44] to buy me then sayith the woman of
[31:46] Samaria unto him how is how is it that
[31:49] thou being a Jew ask a string of me
[31:52] which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews
[31:54] have no dealings with the Samaritans
[32:00] does that sound
[32:04] familiar isn't that how it is
[32:07] today with all these different church
[32:09] group we have no dealings with this
[32:11] church or that church is that the way
[32:13] God wants it to be how many churches
[32:16] does God
[32:21] have
[32:23] amen we've talked about
[32:25] that many times are there going to be
[32:29] different rooms up in
[32:32] heaven for this group or that group
[32:34] because we can't get along with each
[32:36] other down here brothers and sisters I
[32:39] think it's important that we love
[32:41] everybody that we care for everybody yes
[32:48] Hallelujah even if they are our enemies
[32:50] we pray for them yes
[32:52] Hallelujah we love them like God loved
[32:56] them that's a sign that the the love of
[32:58] God is in us we need the Holy Spirit In
[33:01] Our Lives to love our
[33:04] enemies
[33:10] Hallelujah I used to read this as a
[33:12] story Jesus answered and said unto her
[33:15] if thou knewest the gift of God and who
[33:17] it is that sayest to thee give me to
[33:21] drink thou wouldest have asked of him
[33:24] and he would have given thee Living
[33:26] Water so the woman didn't know who she
[33:29] was talking
[33:31] to isn't that the way it was it's the
[33:35] way it was with me I don't know who how
[33:38] it was with you
[33:43] yes maybe the word of God is living
[33:46] water it refreshes us if we drink of it
[33:49] right if we eat it if we take it
[33:52] in and it says if he that believeth as
[33:56] the scripture says out of his belly
[33:58] shall flow rivers of Living Water amen
[34:03] so if we believe the true word of God
[34:05] there will be flowing rivers of Living
[34:07] Water from our
[34:09] lives amen
[34:14] yes but whosoever drinketh of the water
[34:17] that I shall give him shall never
[34:20] thirst but the water that I shall give
[34:22] him shall be in him a well of water
[34:25] spring up into Eternal WI the woman says
[34:28] unto him sir give me this water that I
[34:32] thirst not neither come hither to draw
[34:34] Jesus says unto her go call thy husband
[34:37] and come
[34:40] hither the woman answered and said I
[34:43] have no husband Jesus said unto her thou
[34:46] Hast well said I have no husbands for
[34:49] thou H has had five husbands and the one
[34:51] that you now has is not the
[34:53] husband does Jesus know
[34:56] everything am amen we cannot hide
[34:59] anything from him that's right she she
[35:03] was on her sixth husband did Jesus
[35:04] condemn her doesn't the Bible say we're
[35:08] not supposed to do that that's
[35:18] right he didn't condemn her he came to
[35:21] save people that were lost hallu
[35:28] I hope we can all think that way we're
[35:30] here to try to help people come to
[35:33] Christ we're not here to condemn
[35:37] people if we got true freedom in our
[35:39] lives I think that's what's going to be
[35:41] coming out of our
[35:49] Lives the woman saith unto him sir I
[35:52] perceive that thou are a prophet our
[35:54] fathers worshiped in the mountain and ye
[35:56] say that in Jerusalem place where men
[35:58] ought to worship Jesus says unto her
[36:00] woman believe me the hour cometh when ye
[36:05] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[36:07] Jerusalem worship the father ye worship
[36:10] ye know not what we know that we worship
[36:14] for salvation of the Jews the hour
[36:16] cometh and is now when the true
[36:19] worshippers shall worship the father in
[36:23] spirit and in truth for the father
[36:25] seeketh such to worship Him and then he
[36:28] says God is a spirit and they that
[36:30] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[36:34] and in truth am brothers and sisters
[36:36] that's for us we need to worship Him in
[36:39] spirit and in
[36:42] truth and let's not depend on going to
[36:45] church on Sunday and listening to a
[36:47] sermon and Wednesday evening that
[36:49] that'll be enough we got to be in the
[36:52] word of God every day hallelujah amen we
[36:56] like to eat every day right physical
[36:59] body so we better be eating the word of
[37:01] God every
[37:03] day what will happen if we
[37:06] don't what will happen if we don't stay
[37:10] in the word stay in the
[37:13] spirit I can tell you what's going to
[37:18] happen this is what's going to
[37:25] happen in Revelation
[37:28] chapter 3 it
[37:30] says verse 14 and unto the angel of the
[37:34] Church of the leans right the things
[37:37] sayest the amen and the faithful and the
[37:39] true witness beginning of creation of
[37:41] God I Know Thy works that thou art
[37:44] neither cold nor hot I would that thou
[37:47] were cold or hot so then because Thou
[37:50] Art loot
[37:53] wararmored thee out of my mouth
[37:57] so let's not get into that stage that's
[38:01] right God wants people that are on fire
[38:04] for him amen I think we're we're living
[38:08] in a time like never before there's a
[38:12] lot of evil happening a lot of things
[38:14] are happening in the world a lot of
[38:16] things are happening in churches but
[38:17] brothers and
[38:20] sisters I think one secret is he that
[38:23] forsaketh not all that he has cannot be
[38:26] my disciples we got to forsake
[38:28] everything that we have to follow him
[38:32] and brothers and sisters that's a very
[38:34] important thing that we see in our
[38:36] lives once the holy spirit is working in
[38:39] our lives is living within us our
[38:42] desires for Earthly things will start to
[38:44] demish Hallelujah and the spiritual
[38:46] things will start to grow we want more
[38:49] spiritual things we want more spiritual
[38:51] food it is not so important to make
[38:53] another dollar anymore than it used to
[38:55] be amen amen do we want to sit around
[38:59] maybe we got to make this very clear we
[39:01] don't sit around we don't work the Bible
[39:04] says we're supposed to work so we have
[39:05] something to give the needy so we can
[39:08] eat support our families let's not be
[39:10] lazy but brothers and sisters let's not
[39:12] be greedy also yes brother
[39:16] good there's a right way to do there's
[39:18] people that don't want to work but the
[39:20] Bible says if you don't want to work
[39:22] don't eat yes
[39:28] so there is a right way Hallelujah and
[39:31] God knows our hearts
[39:38] yes but I think this in in the Lea H
[39:42] this is what's going to happen a lot of
[39:44] people are going to be loot
[39:51] wararmed say the things uh uh the way
[39:54] the world things are going things are
[39:56] going
[39:59] it's not good that's right but brothers
[40:01] and sisters there's more light there's
[40:04] more light here on the word of God than
[40:06] there ever was before in any age isn't
[40:08] there so that's how where we want to
[40:11] look on the word of God there's light
[40:13] here and Jesus will not lose one of his
[40:16] hallelujah
[40:18] hallelujah there's nobody it says
[40:20] nobody's going to pluck them out of his
[40:22] hand so let's stay with Jesus that's the
[40:25] only place I can encourage you to stay
[40:27] with stay in the word stay with Jesus
[40:30] and it's going to lead you home where we
[40:32] all want to
[40:33] be
[40:39] amen we might have to go through trials
[40:42] through tribulations but let's keep a
[40:44] hold of the Master's
[40:46] Hand it says as many as I love I rebuke
[40:49] and Chase and beel us there for and
[40:51] repent it says behold I stand at the
[40:54] door and knock If any man hear my voice
[40:56] and open the door I will come into him
[40:59] and S with him and he with me and that's
[41:02] exactly true if we truly want him Jesus
[41:05] will come in what do we need to do we
[41:06] need to believe and we need to
[41:09] repent it
[41:11] says and be baptized in the name of
[41:15] Jesus Christ yes and ye shall receive
[41:18] the gift of the Holy Ghost how many
[41:21] people want that amen I think we all
[41:24] want that gift of the Holy Spirit
[41:28] yes and it says to him that overcometh
[41:33] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[41:35] even as I also overcame and am sat down
[41:38] with my father in his throne he that has
[41:40] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[41:44] says unto the churches
[41:47] Hallelujah Glory we can read I think
[41:50] it's in Matthew 13 we can read that
[41:52] people have
[41:53] ears and they can't hear that's right
[41:58] they have eyes but they can't see true
[42:01] who does God reveal his secrets to who
[42:04] does he give
[42:06] Revelation doesn't it say I think it's
[42:08] in Matthew 11 he said he reveals it to
[42:10] the babes yeah that's right to the
[42:14] people that can humble themsel and
[42:16] become little as children Hallelujah
[42:19] that's who he reveals himself to he's
[42:21] not here for the high educated people he
[42:24] can't help them Hallelujah
[42:28] they're trying to figure out their way
[42:29] they're trying to make their own
[42:32] way
[42:35] right I think it Peter says and I think
[42:38] James says humble yourself in the sight
[42:40] of God I
[42:43] think we need to Humble ourself and come
[42:46] to jesus'
[42:48] feet
[42:51] amen something I wanted to point out in
[42:54] John 4 about this woman at the well
[42:58] when she recognized that this was the
[43:01] Savior Jesus what did you do she had
[43:05] water pots alone didn't she her water
[43:08] pots and it says she left her water
[43:12] pots
[43:14] yeah that's something that's not easy to
[43:16] do once you're 60 years
[43:18] old leave your old traditions your old
[43:22] the water pots that you used to draw
[43:25] water with to leave that
[43:33] right so this is what I'm
[43:36] seeing once we start believing the word
[43:40] the word starts tearing down the
[43:43] veils in our lives
[43:46] yes the word is more powerful than any
[43:50] Creeds and traditions it starts to take
[43:53] them away so some of the things that we
[43:55] did some of the things we believe were
[43:57] true and some of them weren't true so we
[43:59] need the Holy
[44:00] Spirit the word of
[44:04] God to reveal it Hallelujah what's true
[44:08] and what's false praise God what to get
[44:11] rid of in our lives yes the word of God
[44:17] will do it GL the Holy Spirit if we let
[44:20] it
[44:40] I'm going to go back to U First Kings
[44:44] 17 there's a story here that I've read
[44:47] many
[44:49] times but I didn't realize what it the
[44:54] meaning of everything in here I probably
[44:56] still don't but I got more
[45:01] Revelation it's about the Widow
[45:11] Anala I think we're living in a time
[45:14] when there's
[45:17] spiritual famine in the
[45:20] land there's a spiritual famine in the
[45:22] land brothers and
[45:24] sisters but on the other hand there's a
[45:27] living
[45:29] well there's a living well in this land
[45:33] thank you Lord so we got to search it
[45:36] and see where where is the well who is
[45:38] the
[45:39] well but here in First Kings 17:12 it
[45:43] says and she said as the Lord thy God
[45:46] liveth I have a little cake and a
[45:48] handful of meal in a barrel and a little
[45:51] oil in a cruise and behold I am
[45:54] Gathering two sticks that I may go in
[45:57] and dress it for me and my son that we
[46:00] may eat and
[46:07] die a widow so her husband had
[46:15] died and the only food she had left was
[46:18] a little bit of
[46:21] meal and here comes the
[46:24] prophet and talks to her and Elijah said
[46:28] unto her fear not go and do as thou Hast
[46:31] said make me therefore a little cake
[46:34] first and bring it unto me and after
[46:37] make for thee for thy and for thy
[46:45] son is that a
[46:47] picture of the church today yes yes
[46:55] sir there's not much life
[46:58] left that's
[47:00] right I didn't see this till just in the
[47:03] last week or
[47:05] two God revealed this to
[47:08] me the husband was dead right
[47:11] died so the Widow and her little
[47:17] son and here comes a
[47:20] man doesn't this look very
[47:23] selfish here comes a man
[47:27] and tells this Widow doesn't the Bible
[47:29] say we're to help widows we're to give
[47:32] to them and here comes a man and tells
[47:35] this woman do as you said make a meal
[47:38] what you have left but give to me
[47:43] first so what are we getting out of here
[47:47] there's a serious lesson in
[47:50] here so we got to realize this is a man
[47:53] from God right Elijah is a prophet
[47:56] that's
[47:59] right so she gave him first
[48:03] right we're to have God first in our
[48:05] lives
[48:08] Hallelujah and what
[48:11] happened for thus says the Lord God of
[48:16] Israel the barrel of meal shall not
[48:19] waste neither shall the Cru of oil
[48:22] fail until the day that the Lord sent
[48:26] this rain upon the
[48:29] Earth and she went and did according to
[48:31] the saying of
[48:33] Elijah and she and he and her house did
[48:37] eat many
[48:39] days and the barrel of meal wasted not
[48:43] neither did the Cru of oil fail
[48:49] according to the word
[48:51] of the Lord yes do we get it
[48:57] according to the word of the
[49:00] Lord so we're going through trials
[49:05] struggles if there's a famine in our
[49:10] life let's do what the word says
[49:13] hallelujah let's believe the word and do
[49:16] what the word says it says which he
[49:18] spake by
[49:23] Elijah and it came to pass after these
[49:26] things that the son of the woman and the
[49:29] Mistress of the house fell sick and his
[49:32] sickness was so
[49:34] sore that there was no breath left in
[49:45] him I don't know what God is trying to
[49:48] tell us here in a this
[49:52] year where we live we had a drought that
[49:55] was serious
[49:58] grass quit
[50:00] growing the good thing is we always have
[50:02] water to
[50:04] drink some people had to ha water we had
[50:07] to feed hay to our cows so they have
[50:10] something to
[50:12] eat and the Harvest is not going to be
[50:15] like it usually
[50:17] is in some of the fields the way it
[50:19] looks we might not be harvesting
[50:24] anything so God is
[50:27] trying to get our attention
[50:32] right maybe to trust
[50:35] him that everything will work out okay
[50:38] he'll take care of us if we seek Him
[50:40] First
[50:48] amen we got a lot of rain in the last
[50:52] two weeks we probably got four or five
[50:54] inches it was so wet
[50:57] we were so dry and then it was so wet
[51:00] that our beans soy beans started
[51:03] sprouting on the
[51:05] plant so they're ruined isn't that
[51:16] something maybe we don't need him very
[51:18] long
[51:20] anymore maybe he's coming back
[51:23] soon we don't know
[51:27] but we want to be
[51:28] ready
[51:37] Amen in verse 22 it says and the Lord
[51:39] heard the voice of Elijah and the soul
[51:42] of the child came into him again and he
[51:46] revived and Elijah took the child and
[51:49] brought him down out of the chamber into
[51:51] the house and delivered him unto his
[51:54] mother and Elijah said thy son
[51:59] liveth and the woman said to
[52:04] Elijah now by this I know that thou art
[52:07] a man of God and that the word of the
[52:10] Lord is in thy mouth is truth yes so she
[52:14] recognized what Elijah the prophet said
[52:18] was the
[52:21] truth do we
[52:24] believe I think it's wonderful to live
[52:26] in a time when the veil when the
[52:31] Mysteries were revealed in this book
[52:34] Hallelujah it says in the Book of Daniel
[52:37] things were sealed until the end so it
[52:40] all says is it in Amos or Hosea says
[52:44] that the mistress cannot be revealed
[52:46] unless through a prophet so God sent a
[52:48] prophet to reveal things to
[52:51] us and it's
[52:54] wonderful there were a lot of debate
[52:56] Ates already in in the Book of
[52:58] Revelations what this means and what
[53:00] that
[53:01] means and this is a book that we can
[53:05] read it we can study it every day but
[53:07] unless God reveals it and he revealed a
[53:10] lot of things through the prophet that
[53:12] men tried to figure out by themselves
[53:15] but they were wrong
[53:21] yes so it says here in uh
[53:25] Revelation 10 verse 8 it says the voice
[53:28] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[53:30] again and said go and take the little
[53:33] book which is open in the hand of the
[53:36] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[53:38] upon the
[53:39] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[53:42] unto him give me the little book and he
[53:45] said unto me take it and eat it up and
[53:47] it shall be bitter
[53:50] it and it shall make thy belly bitter
[53:54] but in it be in thy mouth sweet as
[54:02] honey and I took the little book out of
[54:04] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[54:07] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[54:11] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[54:14] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[54:17] prophesy again before many people
[54:20] Nations towns and
[54:22] Kings yes so what is he saying
[54:27] I believe what he's saying we are to eat
[54:30] the word of
[54:32] God
[54:33] yes it brings truth it brings
[54:37] life it's sweet we love it if God gives
[54:41] us revelation we love it it's
[54:45] like a revelation is I heard one
[54:49] preacher say one time it's just like a
[54:50] fresh
[54:52] kill of meat an animal we get something
[54:56] to eat it's not something that the
[54:58] vultures eat it's what we want to eat we
[55:02] like to eat good meat right and that's
[55:05] if God reveals gives us a revelation of
[55:08] the word it's some good meat to eat it's
[55:11] not milk it's
[55:12] meatl and sometimes we can eat on a
[55:16] revelation maybe for a week or so before
[55:18] he gives us another one it's it's good
[55:21] stuff good to eat on
[55:27] but what does he mean when he says it's
[55:30] going to be bitter in thy
[55:33] belly so to live it to live the
[55:37] Christian Life sometimes it's bitter
[55:41] right right
[55:43] amen we might have to go through some
[55:47] rejection some
[55:49] suffering does that line up with the
[55:51] word of God it sure does it say Jesus
[55:55] came
[55:59] and
[56:00] he I would think in my mind he came to
[56:03] bring peace in families and everything
[56:07] but this is one thing we see even in in
[56:11] our immediate family it causes divisions
[56:15] when one accepts the truth and the
[56:17] others
[56:18] don't it brings
[56:21] divisions but that's what he said if we
[56:24] don't forsake all that we have father
[56:26] mother son or daughter whoever it is
[56:28] we're supposed to have him first in our
[56:30] life hallelujah amen
[56:37] yes and I think it's
[56:40] like
[56:43] um like it was when the angel came to
[56:50] Mary in Luke 2 I think it is
[57:10] we know that Mary was the chosen virgin
[57:14] to bring Jesus into the world when the
[57:17] angel came to her and said you're going
[57:19] to be with
[57:21] child she didn't know how this is going
[57:23] to happen but the angel said well the
[57:24] Holy Ghost is going to come upon you
[57:27] you and Jesus is going to be born you're
[57:31] going to be the one and what did you do
[57:34] she did she
[57:35] surrendered yes Hallelujah so that's
[57:38] what we are to do in our life we're
[57:40] supposed to surrender and once the Holy
[57:43] Spirit comes into us it's it's a good
[57:45] thing but Mary as the child was growing
[57:50] she started to walk a different life
[57:52] right and that's the way it is with us
[57:54] if we receive the spirit in our Liv
[57:56] lives if we believe the word we're it's
[57:59] going to change us we're going to have a
[58:00] different walk Hallelujah it makes me
[58:03] think of
[58:04] Jacob stop and think all the things that
[58:06] Jacob did he
[58:09] was the elected one right
[58:12] yes but look what all he did he he was a
[58:16] deceiver right yes sir he
[58:20] lied he did all those things yes
[58:26] did we do everything right in our lives
[58:28] absolutely
[58:31] not but the day came when he wrestled
[58:35] with a
[58:37] man didn't he say he was
[58:42] Esau but that night he wrestled he said
[58:45] I won't let you go unless you bless me
[58:46] and then he asked him who art thou and
[58:49] he said I am
[58:51] Jacob
[58:54] yeah so he
[58:57] he told God who he was he was Jacob
[59:01] Hallelujah he wasn't Esau amen so his
[59:05] life changed from that day forward
[59:08] Hallelujah and I think that's how it is
[59:09] in our lives we got to we wrestle with
[59:12] God and we got to surrender we got to
[59:15] repent of things in our
[59:18] lives and this is a wonderful picture
[59:20] here as Mary as she walked it was bitter
[59:23] in her
[59:24] belly but that's the way it is with us
[59:27] this life is is is actually it's a good
[59:29] life it's not
[59:31] always roses flowers maybe but it's the
[59:35] only life the word of God lives in US
[59:39] Jesus the Holy Spirit and this is
[59:42] something that I
[59:46] see if we try to live a Godly life by
[59:51] rules and regulations
[1:00:01] we're going to be walking blind in
[1:00:08] darkness it says in 2 Corinthians
[1:00:10] chapter
[1:00:13] 3 it says for ye in verse two ye are our
[1:00:18] Epistles written in our hearts known and
[1:00:21] read of all men for as much as ye are
[1:00:24] manifested declared to be the Epistle of
[1:00:26] Christ ministered by us un written not
[1:00:29] with ink but with the spirit of the
[1:00:32] Living God not in tles of stone but in
[1:00:34] fleshly taplet of the heart and trust
[1:00:37] and such trust have we through Christ to
[1:00:39] God word not that we are sufficient
[1:00:42] ourselves seeing anything of ourself but
[1:00:44] our sufficiency is of
[1:00:46] God who also has made us able Ministers
[1:00:49] of the New Testament not of the letter
[1:00:52] but of the spirit for the letter kill us
[1:00:54] but the spirit give us life amen amen
[1:00:57] isn't that true
[1:01:03] Hallelujah I just love
[1:01:06] to experience the freedom in Christ I
[1:01:09] love to go to church and not have any
[1:01:12] rules and regulations
[1:01:16] except the
[1:01:19] spirit I think it's like a
[1:01:22] tree sometimes a tree is hollow on the
[1:01:25] inside
[1:01:27] you can walk up to it and it might look
[1:01:29] okay on the outside but on the inside it
[1:01:32] is
[1:01:33] hollow so if we don't have the spirit of
[1:01:35] God on the living on the inside we're
[1:01:38] just Hollow like a tree yes but once the
[1:01:42] spirit is on the inside it will start
[1:01:44] producing and give true life so the word
[1:01:49] the law just keeps us
[1:01:52] Hollow the spirit can't
[1:01:54] work it that was with Moses as in verse
[1:01:58] 13 it says and not as Moses which put a
[1:02:01] veil over his face that the children of
[1:02:03] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[1:02:07] end of that which is abolished but their
[1:02:09] minds were blinded for until this day
[1:02:12] remainest the
[1:02:14] veil untaken away in the reading of the
[1:02:17] Old Testament which which the veil is
[1:02:20] done away in Christ for even unto this
[1:02:23] day when Moses read the veil us upon
[1:02:25] their heart
[1:02:26] nevertheless listen what he says
[1:02:28] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[1:02:30] Lord the veil shall be taken away amen
[1:02:34] amenallah that's so
[1:02:36] true now the spirit now the Lord of that
[1:02:39] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:02:42] is there is Liberty yes isn't that true
[1:02:46] Hallelujah so what I want to bring out
[1:02:48] if the true spirit of God is within us
[1:02:50] we're not going to go and live like the
[1:02:53] world and live like the devil that's
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:56] Amen in Galatians 5 I think it says we
[1:03:00] if we are set free don't use your
[1:03:02] Liberty as an occasion to the flesh but
[1:03:05] by love serve one another amen and I
[1:03:08] love to go to church with people that
[1:03:10] are in love in tune with god with the
[1:03:14] Holy Spirit and that are here to help
[1:03:16] each other if a brother or sister is
[1:03:18] struggling or Falls in sin we're here
[1:03:21] here to pray for the person to help him
[1:03:24] up lift him to Christ and not to condemn
[1:03:26] the person or to talk about the person
[1:03:28] behind his back stabing stabbing a knife
[1:03:31] in her back or anything like backbiting
[1:03:33] doesn't the Bible talk about backbiting
[1:03:36] sure does we don't need to live in a
[1:03:38] world like that we're here to help each
[1:03:44] other that's the love of God in our
[1:03:47] lives
[1:03:51] amen now where the spirit now now the
[1:03:54] Lord is that spirit and where the spirit
[1:03:56] of the Lord is there is Liberty but we
[1:03:58] all with an open face beholding as in a
[1:04:01] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[1:04:03] into the same image from glory to
[1:04:06] glory even as by the spirit of the Lord
[1:04:11] so what changes
[1:04:13] us amen the spirit of God changes us so
[1:04:18] who gets the
[1:04:19] honor God does hallelujah amen there's
[1:04:23] no room for pride in our life no
[1:04:30] room because God does the work in our
[1:04:33] life he cleans
[1:04:35] us praise the
[1:04:41] Lord another example is
[1:04:45] Rahab the Bible says Rahab was a
[1:04:49] harlot her house was on the
[1:04:53] wall when the spies came to inspect the
[1:04:57] land she received them right The
[1:05:00] Messengers she received the
[1:05:03] word a lot of people today aren't
[1:05:05] receiving the message what the message
[1:05:07] had to
[1:05:11] say I've been accused of following a
[1:05:15] man
[1:05:19] right I did that in my life
[1:05:22] earlier yes but not now that's right am
[1:05:27] amen you know what I tell people about
[1:05:29] this
[1:05:34] Prophet God talks through a prophet
[1:05:38] right his Spirit yes we can see it in
[1:05:41] Paul we can see it in
[1:05:45] Elijah I tell people the
[1:05:48] prophet to
[1:05:50] me came to shine a flashlight a light on
[1:05:55] the word of God God amen amen I'm not
[1:05:59] following the prophet that's right I'm
[1:06:02] following the
[1:06:03] spirit but it was God's way to reveal it
[1:06:06] to us that's right
[1:06:09] Hallelujah but you know who's going to
[1:06:11] receive
[1:06:14] it the true
[1:06:17] seedall the true
[1:06:19] seed the True Believers will receive it
[1:06:22] thank you Lord
[1:06:28] it's just like it
[1:06:31] was and all the way back some people
[1:06:34] received the word and some
[1:06:38] didn't so thank God that he put a
[1:06:42] seed in our hearts hallu thank God
[1:06:49] Hallelujah it's like Brother Kyle shared
[1:06:52] already like a pine tree if you have a
[1:06:54] pine tree with all the branches down low
[1:06:58] nothing's growing underneath it
[1:07:00] why cut off the lower branches and let
[1:07:04] the sun shine in
[1:07:07] there things start to grow right yes sir
[1:07:11] yes grass weeds whatever start to grow
[1:07:14] who put the seat
[1:07:17] there it was there all the
[1:07:20] time isn't that the way it is with us
[1:07:23] once the light strikes once the Holy
[1:07:26] Spirit touches our heart if we respond
[1:07:29] things start to grow in our
[1:07:31] lives amen that's the way it
[1:07:35] is thank you Jesus thank
[1:07:39] you so brothers and sisters I encourage
[1:07:41] you all stay in the word amen let the
[1:07:45] spirit of God lead you
[1:07:49] am we're not to worry about what people
[1:07:51] think what people
[1:07:53] say but what God
[1:07:57] says
[1:08:00] amen let's align ourselves with the word
[1:08:02] of God and let's pray that he'll give us
[1:08:05] Revelation let's seek him we need to die
[1:08:08] to
[1:08:08] self and keep walking with
[1:08:23] him there's another story in Genesis 24
[1:08:27] about Isaac wanted a wife so he sent
[1:08:32] aaser to get a wife for
[1:08:34] him so he went over and I'm just going
[1:08:37] to make this short but there's a lot in
[1:08:39] here there's a lot in here isn't that
[1:08:42] what Jesus wants he wants a bride yes
[1:08:45] Hallelujah so he sent a
[1:08:48] messenger to get the
[1:08:50] bride so when when the aler came over
[1:08:54] there to the well he he prayed if a
[1:08:56] woman would come out to the well to give
[1:08:59] him
[1:08:59] water and she did Rebecca came out and
[1:09:03] she gave him water and she said not just
[1:09:05] him but she gave water she Drew water
[1:09:07] for the 10

[1:09:15] surrendered to draw water how much water
[1:09:18] did she draw for all these camels I've
[1:09:21] been told a camel can drink up to 25 50
[1:09:24] gallons of water and she she Drew water
[1:09:27] for 10 of
[1:09:29] them so this woman was girl was
