a round frog praise the Lord sir I'm glad to you how you doing what a blessing hallelujah let's see one more song here I kind of want to preach my heart on Sunday both services and lost my voice and my strength so I'm gonna try to preach no shorter tonight by God's grace unless you pull so hard did I forget about it I was really exhausted this week but it was good the Holy Ghost found such a anyway and we're so thankful for that but I'm letting you know my human intentions okay try to watch the time tonight but praise the Lillis let's stand and sing one more song here let's uh the blood that gives me strength let's sing that by God's grace I sure I need the blood to give me strength tonight I know you do too I know you do too we all need the blood of Jesus Christ amen I start with the course therefore reaches to the highest mountain praise God oh it reaches [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank God let's stand and take our Bibles here tonight by the grace of the Lord praise God thank you Jesus let's take a scripture here I like to one scripture I kind of want to focus on tonight I think I may close well maybe not close let's go to Acts chapter 1 verse 3 I like to just look at the number 40 again tonight we're looking at biblical numerology again I believe this is part 16 we've been going right down through the numbers here and trust you've been blessed by it after what God did on Sunday I know God likes this message I know this wasn't my thought it was his thought the Holy Ghost could fall like that and feel somebody with the Holy Ghost and then you know meet these other people's needs then I know it's his word and of course not mine you and I can take credit for nothing and so God must God above I am said to God always vindicates his word so we're thankful for that so Acts chapter 1 thank the Lord I want to continue look at the number 40 we we we didn't get through 40 on Sunday there was such a tremendous poll we thank the Lord for that but I thought I thought I'd get all the way to 50 on Sunday but you all were pulling so much we couldn't get off that 40 so that showed us where we were all at seemed like we all needed help with temptations and tests praise the Lord so it seemed like the Lord was really dealing with us on that so thank the Lord for His mercy verse 3 let's read this together just verse 3 let's read on three one two three to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God that's of our heads one more time in a word of Prayer let's ask the Lord to bless the word of God tonight Heavenly Father this is your word not our word Lord God it's inspired Lord it's eternal Lord and father we ask that the Eternal Spirit would come and anoint your Eternal Word Lord God surely we need your grace surely we need your mercy Lord God Lord to help us tonight help us to dwell upon these things help us to meditate upon your word may we feel your presence fill this room Lord God and may a minister to every need in every soul Lord God surely your presence is in this place Lord God help us learn not to be distracted by anything of the world but help us Lord God to be anointed O God help us Lord God or be filled with your presence tonight Lord God or the Huichol Iver sang our hearts burn and not only that but our hearts will continue to burn and we'll take this anointing home Lord God and as we sang earlier let it start on us that the revival start in us we pray we love you Lord God bless each and every heart and soul bless those who have pressed their way out to the house of God and our visitor brother ray blessing and his home church their Sheffield Lord God ministered to them Lord God tomorrow night and and father were so grateful of their testimonies father just ministered by the Holy Spirit pray in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless she's been seated praise the Lord so again we're thankful to be here again in the house of Lord tonight I do have the scriptures Lydia if we could pull that up here and I have some quotes Lord willing you know I just try to just try to preach you know what's inspired here so we're looking at part 16 here by the grace of the Lord now I like to just review these real quick I'm gonna skip back a few weeks to when we looked at the numbers now through the prophets quotes and the Bible I found the meanings of the numbers and I hope they've been a blessing to you by God's grace I was real blessing to me last week when we're looking at how 21 was then the the number of the arrival of the word you know Daniels message came on the 21st day from the angel right hagee I received the message on the 21st day of the month and I received a message when I was 21 years old amens I love how God speaks to us through his numbers praise the Lord so what is preeminence and primacy also unity they're all in one place in one Accord and not division difference testimony and then friendship and unity as well two fellows in one ship three is divine perfection bruh have said he's also said three is life well Aram tells us four is deliverance buh-bam says specifically it's also a double confirmation program also called it an earthly number five is grace or favor and also laboring grace buh-bam says and also Redemption six his fall man and beast and as brother Graham said he's six times he had had the spoken word he said this squirrel six times he said that's the number of man he says so six is an anointed man Adam was anointed on the sixth day he was anointed on that day of course he fell but he started out anointed and six measures time as well seven is completion eight is eternity first day again also new creation new beginning and means abundance in the Hebrew eight means abundance in Hebrew nine is fruit or consummation also can mean closure or judgment ten is divine order or worldliness is the opposite I think seems to be there's a couple of scriptures like the ten virgins seems like can be a faithful remnant two of the twelve tribes got their names removed off off under heaven right under heaven not in heaven under heaven according to the the seals taught us that the seven seals out is that so 10 were faithful 11 is disorder or the last call were the eleventh hour' workers how many eleven our workers we got out there thank the Lord for that twelve is a number of government or rule also of worship 13 means rebellion it can also mean victory or Revelation it seems like because there are scriptures Joshua went around Jericho thirteen times six times and then seven times thirteen fourteen could be a double seven or relates to generations I'm not quite sure on this one that's why I put the question marks 15 was triple five could be or relates to the fee sirs I don't have a whole lot on fifteen sixteen looks like maybe a double eight not quite sure read that one a few weeks ago seventeen certainly means Christ bride certainly I could probably take away the question mark on that one I think we thoroughly proved it through the scripture seventeen seems to be Christ's bride eighteen not quite sure on that one nineteen not sure those are all the ones from last week twenty seems that certain Leiby expectancy twenty years you wait and then something seems to happen we prove that from the scripture okay so that's must been where we picked up the other week yeah that's where I picked up 21 was arrived of the word 22 seemed to be like double disorder but not a whole lot on that not much on 23 24 was definitely worship brother band taught us 24 was worship no doubt about that I didn't have much for 25 to 29 other than brother or than Abraham waiting 25 years for Isaac there's 27 New Testament books 30 was certainly leadership we saw plainly saw that from the scripture Jesus started at 30 years old David started at 30 years old the Levite started at 30 years old thirty is certainly leadership no doubt about that 31 to 39 were unsure I just had different examples I'm just kind of gonna skip through those and let's go back to 40 okay let's just I just kind of want to run through those and I think it's good Church to have those in mind don't you because as you have those in mind you can start seeing how God can be moving in your life now not to mate not to make every single thing like okay oh there's there's 12 ants over there something like that not to make everything spiritual but obviously when God was talking to people in the Bible it's obvious he used numbers to do it in all these 15 sermons hopefully you've seen that God uses numbers to talk to people praise God and so he does it to us as well now let's pick up here with 40 it could mean temptation or test we kind of focused on that on Sunday and persecution now we're gonna see tonight 40 can be a good number as well 40 can mean rest amen and 40 can mean generation now I don't I don't have much on generation tonight so I'm gonna spend most of my time I think maybe I have a few to finish up on these Lord willing so we start off just by Jonah gave ninna 40 days to repent so they had a 40 day little period there in which they had to repent and Jonah cried he said yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown now can you imagine how he preached this he probably preached this church with the wrong spirit because he wanted them to die and sometimes as preachers or even as witnesses right sometimes we say the right thing but we got the wrong spirit behind is that right we've all done it I've said the right thing to my mom but it was the wrong spirit I just say I'm sorry write about something about brother Branham or or something from the scripture and we all do it but Jonah came in there and blasted you've got 40 days to repent and you're gonna be overthrown now what's interesting though when I looked at all the quotes from brother Branham on this I just basically come to this one I like Jonah I'm picking up here if this is from Christ identified the same in all generations like Jonah when he was delivered from the belly of the whale that was his side then his voice was repent or in 40 days you'll perish so there's always the voice going with the sign so beau Graham didn't labor much on the 40 at least what I could find cuz I typed in 40 in Jonah and this was the the most interesting quote I could find other than him just referring to the 40 days and he says the voice goes with the sign so the sign was a prophet being spitted out of a whale right and then the whale worshipers see that mine here comes a man he should not have lived but he comes out and they didn't know it but they were gonna say it years later that was a pre figure of Jesus Christ amen Christ coming out of the belly of a beast right Christ coming out from the from the depths of hell we'd say amen and that's what Jonah said he said that whale took me down to the depths of hell he said that and he said I was down there forever so three days can feel like forever you ever had three real days of hard trial you're not alone if it feels like forever Jonah did the same thing but if God's grace was sufficient to help him amongst whale vomit among seaweed wrapped around his face all because he turned his face and prayed to a human temple a man built temple how much more will God give you and I grace if we pray to the true heavenly temple amen but the thing is we've got to turn it right we got to turn from our attitude we got to turn from our our unbelief our excuses for our mistakes we got to turn from that and we got to look to Jesus Christ for he is God's provide a place of worship amen hallelujah so no doubt that was the sign a prophet coming out but you had to follow the voice of the side you know it's common I think you know it too you know we see it all the time you know people like Benny Hinn or or Marilyn Hickey different people they can all recognize brother Branham had a ministry that was from God but to save their congregations and to to fill their pocketbooks they all say he got off on his doctrine at the end of his ministry see they can all recognize this side but they don't like the voice that follows may God help us to be able to receive all the word that the voice is saying that followed the side and that's what we're seeing today we're seeing groups either drawing closer to the voice or they're drawing away from the voice we have to be a group that draws closer to the voice when brother Branham says we it's the will of God and we must do a certain thing you and I have to be the ones that say amen to the voice not try to silence the voice but try to draw close to the voice and obey the voice of God that's right praise God that's our desire is to hear the voice that follows the sign amen even brothers that have left the message I'll just call a name real quick I don't think he'd mind Geoff Jenkins even he can recognize still even though he doesn't believe the message even he still says after he left that it's still he's still a gifted prop a gifted man with him with a gift even they even he can recognize the sign right hey almost anybody can recognize that they're genuine side that's a genuine gift but it takes a special kind of believer to listen those sermons before the gift operates at the end of the sermon right and hear the voice of what's being preached before that and take it back to the word that's what you and I have to do by the grace of God amen take what he said back to the word and that's been my whole life that's been on my whole ministry I hope it's been your life as well your whole life is to hear the word that's on the tape and take that back to to the word and then apply it to your life praise God that's our whole duty is to hear the voice of the side now let's move to Moses Moses waited 40 years until God appeared to him in a burning bush right and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai angel the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush so remember this was he was 80 years old which was two-thirds of his life right God couldn't use him until two thirds of his life was over but God used them in a great way now Church how thankful should you and I be if God got ahold of our lives before two-thirds of the way done right does how thankful should we be because because of Moses's mistake brother Graham said the second 40 years of his life was God beating his disobedience out of him let me share something real personal humbly that's what God has done to my father my father got right with God in 1983 but then he back slid and since 1983 he has he's had nothing but trouble 83 93 2003 2013 and he still tells me like I seen him last time he still tells me he's struggling and we know he's struggling think about that if God Tarrasch to 2023 he's had 40 years of struggle for what he told me was disobeying the Lord think about that a church you and I have a choice now you're in the best place you could be in the house of God judgment begins in the house of God it doesn't begin in our homes although we love our homes don't we doesn't begin in our jobs although I thank God for my job judgment begin their judgment begins right here in the house of God and if judgment begins with us right then how many scarcely will be saved out there who don't come to the house of God Oh advantage we have Church in other words how close are we to God's presence amen how close are we to God's heart to God's heartbeat we can hear it can't you hear on services when the Word of God is breached can't you feel God's heartbeat can't you hear it can't you skate you hear what God is saying for you and I to do to get closer to the Lord you ought to be able to hear that but because he disobeyed at the wrong time spent 40 years of wasted time but our God is the great Redeemer amen and use that last 40 better than the previous 80 amen right now that's all I want to read out of that quote cuz I preached this recently when we talked to showed how brother Branham didn't know everything you know some groups like voice of God are saying he knows everything every word he says thus saith the Lord but I've never said that and so they're there they're off the beam path but we pray for them and we thank God for what they do most of what they do but just spit out the seeds I guess right enjoy the cherry pies spit out the seeds that's the program dollars to do so I'm just gonna stop right there now I want to look at this church look at this this is so interesting then think about your life in judges 3 verse 9 the Bible says 2 when the children crying the Lord the Lord raised up to deliver to the church of Israel who delivered them even after yo look what his name means line of God what an anointed name usnea look it up in the Hebrew Lion of God reminds me of Ashland right reminds you the Lion of the tribe of Judah the son of caen as Caleb's younger brother ma look how faith ran in the family I thank God for the faith in my brother cam then the faith of my brother Simon amen the faith of my sister Betsy amen to count everything that they had before the message as done and to serve crux with all their hearts I appreciate that faith it was not only in Calum but it was in Caleb's younger brother the Lion of God came upon him and he does Israel went out to war and the Lord delivered shoosh shoosh on rish a theme saying that one king of Mesopotamia in his hand and his hand prevailed against I'm not gonna say that verse 11 and the lad had one Church rest for how many years 40 is 40 or is a bad number no 40 can be a number God used mops is for 40 years that wasn't a bad time that was a good time praise or in this case God blesses the line of God on earth and his generation after him with 40 years of rest from being under slavery hey man in church that's under the blood of bulls and goats amen amen under the blood of Jesus Christ when we know there's generational curses but thank god there's generation of blessings hallelujah amen think about that rose and goats but we're under the lamb of god who takes away all the sin of the world I started doing some math here before service I was in here prayer on my face crying praying and our nation is now 243 years old and we all know that program said that we know this my history our founders were real men of God and they went out and fought literal battles right there like the modern-day Israel they went out and fought litter battles and God has given us so much grace over the 243 years of our nation are you with me now you know though that in 1956 brother Graham said thus saith the Lord it was their last call is that right for revival and they turned it down is that right and that was at the 180 year mark now I don't have any further revelation beyond those numbers I'm just giving numbers but I thought was so interesting that with 243 years we've already had over 6 sets of 40 groups or 40 years over 6 sets and think about all those generations brother ray most of those generations have not had to endure war there's been a few World War 1 World War 2 some of the Korean War you know we know that Vietnam Civil War obviously a huge one but think about all the year all the years of rest and I wonder where it came from there's rest from the devil or distress come from God Almighty what I'm saying is that these songs that we've son God shed His grace on America that's exactly right let me say like this God shed His grace on you God shed His grace on your family amen and you've got a right to clean that grace amen Lord I've taken your way amen and I've drove it out all the inhabitants of this land amen I knew you every enemy everything in my life that exalts itself against the message I'm defeated by the Word of God and if you gave them rest lord give us rest amen in other words let us not be enslaved let us not be addicted to less let us not be a slave to depression amen let's not be a slave to money and greed and prosperity does not be enslaved in there it leaves me free service living in peace and power of Almighty God through the baptism of the Holy hey man that's what I feel like when I read these scriptures because I'm taking land to brother ray we've taken this land Akron Ohio praise God we've had to fight for every inch for 13 years but we're finally getting somewhere praise of the heart are you understand we've gotten somewhere all alone I'm just saying I feel like we're getting we're getting momentum praise God if we can have a good move of the Holy Spirit like Sunday with no guest preacher it shows a little bit a lot of maturity in the church doesn't it that means you and I were able to look past the veil and recognize there's somebody greater that your pastor here there's somebody greater then your soul leader here there's somebody greater than your mom or your dad your birth sister here and that greater person is the Lord Jesus Christ and I've always said that that's the sign of a true mature Christian faithful church attendance full dedication to the house of God and being able to pull on the Word of God and receive revelation from God no matter who's preaching that's a real sign of maturity because Satan wants you to law you to sleep by all just the pastor we're not going to hear from God tonight I'm not going to receive any revelation we're just going through the acts that's the demonic lukewarm spirit that right and we need to tell that devil get behind me in the name of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter who's here as far as the physical people as long as Christ comes we'll have a glorious time you see 40 is a number of rest as well it's a good number now I just made a video about this it just I just uploaded it to YouTube on Sunday morning so it's gone to the 10 commandments apply to Christian so I this freshly on my heart of course they do because those same commands are found in the New Testament and that's how you know that's how you know if though if the law the moral or another the ceremonial law was fulfilled the Bible said we now have a new priest not Aaron but we have milk as a decrease in it that's how we know all those ceremonial laws are done away with but God's moral law it's the same because God is the same he said I'm the same and I change not and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen so I want to just go back and show you that when someone gets born again they enter in to rest and it's not just one day of the week like my Saturday Sabbath friends through email and text have told me it's that I would much rather rest every day of the week from my sins my sins slaving habits amen I remember this all seven days than just Saturday hallelujah that's what I put my book right there as you can get if you don't get a copy all right I think everybody got a copy if you didn't get a copy that's in Chapter two I'd much rather rest from sin every day of my life than just one day a week that's right Church so let's prove it now get your Bible I just want to prove this to you go real slow so you got this you never have to wonder about this again go to Hebrews four nine this scripture proves there's a rest that remains for the people of God see Church if the Saturday Sabbath was what God wanted then Paul would not have wrote this he would have said well the rest is already here it's just Saturday just just go to state stay in your house from sunset on Friday you know to sunrise on Sunday we're sorry sunset on Saturday night Yeah right Friday to Saturday night sunrise sunset right that's a day yeah that's what he said but he didn't say that now Hebrews 4 verse 9 there therefore remaineth a rest to the people of God for he that is entered see they remain there's still a rest the people of God that remains for he that has entered in his rest he has also ceased from his old works as God did from him Oh amen if you are really resting in Christ you cease from your sinful works praise God the custom I used to do the smoking the drink in the women shakes in the lesson to cut all of them evil movies and the sports addictions all those less than I used to do those were my works that I could do but if I've entered into the rest of Jesus Christ I cease from those and I do the works that the Holy Ghost wants me to do verse 11 let us labor so see you're gonna have to get out that laboring grace that number five you got the labor to enter in this grace which is mean sanctification you need God's grace to give you power to labor to enter therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall for the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the joints of the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts in tents of the harp so he's not talking about a Saturday rest he's talking about it comes by the Word of God amen and that word divides your soul from your human spirit so we are not like the Pentecostals that they just try to get the Holy Ghost in your spirit speak in tongues come on speak in tongues come on speaking to see the Holy Ghost says see a divided spirit and soul and so now as we know the real baptism the Holy Ghost if you speak in tongues that's a great thing but that's not the sign of it the sign of is it is that the Holy Ghost is in your soul and your whole life is working for God's purpose because Jesus said in John 16:13 he said when the Holy Spirit comes he will guide you into denominational truth no I miss Corder that he said I'll guide you into all truth and Jesus said thy Word is truth so in other words it'll guide you into all the Word of God but we where where we see people stopped today in the message they after God sent a prophet and they don't go any further they they really don't study well what does the Bible say about modesty but what are actually the scriptures that God says about the nothing gifts to the holy spirit all right with me they they they just know that they they they they're to just content well we're out of their system and so we're fine but no if you got if you got to get born again you got the labor to enter into the rest and when you're resting you no longer live to the lusts of the way you live your whole life to the things of God through the Holy Spirit's power that's right so see the rest is connected to the word dividing your soul and spirit amen now go to Matthew 11:28 29 oso simple when the Holy Ghost shows these things my child could see it thank the Lord that we must become like a child to enter the kingdom of God Matthew 11:28 29 I'm trying to show you a 40 this is a good 40 hey man this is what we want to enter into the rest the spiritual rest praise God now look at 28 come unto me all you that labor or heavy laden and I will give you rest well I thought the Old Testament gave you rest I thought it's just Saturday Jesus take my yoke upon you and learn of me right why did you say oh just do the fifth commandment right or forth come I'm sorry fourth commandment support command fifth is the children so you take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart you shall find rest unto your what so this is different the Saturday rest was rest for your body but Jesus is introducing a new covenant and he's saying there's a new rest it's not for your flesh it's not even for your mind because Satan still has access to your minds and there's hardly any rest for your minds right oh but there is rest for your soul the nature of your soul it can go from unbelief and it can turn into faith hallelujah and then it can rest and no longer disbelieves it always believes God's presence is sealing there and it's a real child of God from now on that's the latest that would be a part of amen that no matter of the struggles out here or in here if I just sit down long enough and start praying long enough pretty soon I'll get it I'll get a message from the soul man hey Matt the nature of God will tell me this is right or this is wrong I'm gonna go with the ride amen yeah I'm gonna rest in that I'm not gonna let myself be worried up here I'm gonna rest and what the nature in my soul tells me to rest it tell you with me see why this is important Church this is extremely important people think well I shouted or I danced in this beer or like Sunday people could say well I cried at the altar well that that's good but now watch your life afterwards and make sure your life lines up with this holy book right here and then make sure you you start resting from sin you're not a participant in it you're not active in sin you're resting from sin then you'll see pretty good what you brought like Marisa then you'll see which win hit you he said I got hit I got smacked my winning Church I'm born again my parents said well let's find out where that wind came from and the way we find out is watching how you live after you got hit by that wind glory good isaiah 28:11 isaiah 28:11 now paul Quotes this next we'll read it next but let's just look at this scripture briefly actually I start at verse started verse seven okay I didn't plan to read all this but I think we'll just take our time tonight but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink our out of the way the priest and the Prophet have erred through strong drink now he's talking about if you look at verse one he's talking about the drunkards of Ephraim okay so he's basically rebuking Israel they have a brother in verse three says they have a crown of pride so they've crowned themselves with pride instead of letting God crown them with humility right they've erred through strong drink they're swelled up of wine they're out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment so they were actually getting drunk with literal wine and then trying to get in the spirit I'm glad we don't have to worry about that praise God I'm glad you and I can get drunk on the spirit just by confessing our sins worshiping saying Amen getting in the spirit praising God hearing the word and agreeing with everything God's Word says we get the spirit just doing that yes verse eight I look this is denominations program said this verse refers to denominations today for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness said there is no place clean so they cannot go to any service and really have a real church service in Israel it was awful in other words spiritual vomit like Jesus said it made him sick and so he vomited them out of his mouth they were lukewarm so they went through part of the motions but not all the motions Church the same thing can happen here if we just go through the motions and come to church and we don't live what's being preached at home our church will turn into a lukewarm table and the only thing that left is Jesus can't speak how to speak to us anymore but if we keep our lives clean we keep on altar clean we keep our altar on clean when we come to church we can expect to have a table that's clean and hear from God and feasts on his holy word but if not we'll have a lot of awful smells here I have a lot of awful condition we've got to live a Pure Life before God they couldn't find one clean place well I wonder if I wonder if the the brazen altar is clean no that's that's full of vomit I wonder if the brazen Laver is clean no that's full of can you imagine the brazen Laver full of vomit it's supposed to be filled with clean water and this is what God sees when people live half hearted lukewarm lies and they put cried said well I'm in the message I don't have to fast and pray anymore I'll have to draw closer to God have to read my Bible I'll have to do what the preacher says they've crown themselves with a crowd of bride lukewarm it shows they're not hungry and thirsty for Rice's it shows they're hungry and thirsty for our righteousness they go in the holy place the breads moldy there's alter their vomit on the key imagine bread vomit on it Molden command the candlesticks gone out the altar of incense I'm an owner I mean that's the picture God's giving if we don't live sincerely before God it becomes a disgrace oh but if we live holy and clean before God it becomes that the chosen place of God's worship amen all right so we won't have Church amen no matter if there's two people in the church or two hundred what does it matter it's got to be clean so let it start at me praise God let's start in you you're the only one that gives you you're the only one that's in charge of your life you can't make me live holy I can't make Univ only we got let the Holy Ghost help us live holy we got to yield to him now look at verse 9 whom should I teach knowledge whom should I make to understand doctrine then that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts so see there they're busy getting drunk on natural drink and God says you've got a nurse from L shoddy eye for except or commandment must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little so that's exactly that's exactly what Jesus tells us in the Bible and it's exactly what we see Paul doing Paul what he will tell a doctrine and he'll start pulling scriptures from all over the Old Testament can I show you a quick example this just kind of came to my mind I have this video saved on here and maybe it's still on here I hope it's still on here I wasn't planning this so forgive me here it is so let's look what I found this in a book a few years ago let's look at what the prophets said about Jesus and look how look how all these prophecies about Jesus first coming were scattered all over the only way you would have known Jesus coming for sure is to take a line here from Micah and then a line from Malachi a line from Isaiah but a line from Jeremiah a line from Hosea alive from Zechariah and a bunch of lines from Isaiah a man but line upon line upon line here a little day a little and pretty soon you've got the doctrine of God she has to do that for those a because he hides it from the eyes of the wise and prudent ha ha ha and he revealed and the birds such as will search the scripture and let me play this video I don't know if I got my volume up here I try to always turn it down in case I get a ping or something like that forgive me came and went there's numerous scriptures scatter all over the Old Testament and they were not all in one chapter the Bible nor were they in chronological order and so just like it wasn't the first coming be that way the second coming where the scriptures would be from all over the place and it won't be just a straight an order chronologically like a lot of now I'm gonna stop it right there look at that they're not in any order they're just all over the Bible it's not like God made it like okay well here's the first thing that's going to happen then the second thing then the next God's scattered all over and here Isaiah gets an by the Holy Spirit and he said if you want to learn from God you've gotta learn line upon line here a little there little you've got to search the whole Bible little nuggets from all over the place you put a bunch of little nuggets together you've got a bunch of gold nuggets amen but the nuggets are spread out all over and you gotta bring them to one place and I got something real valuable praise God see and if Jesus first coming was like that that's how the rapture is gonna be like as well because he's the same yesterday today and forever ha ha ha that's right so can everybody see that that's Isaiah 28 thank you I hope that was okay was that okay now verse 11 and 12 is when we're looking at with the 44 rest look at verse 11 12 and with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people he's prophesied on the day of Pentecost to whom he said this is the rest wherewith he may cause the weary to rest Isaiah how are the Jews finding an arrest when they get the Holy Ghost so much that their lips are severs have stammered are they going to get rest are you finally gonna rest from sin get so full of God as you can that's what the Almighty God wanted to tell you this is how you rest not seeing how smart you can mean I guess how much spit you can keep from flying but they get so full of God that you only have any words say and so God has to give you another language Oh glory I've never spoke in tongues but I felt like many times I could have and I've asked God to help me so maybe one of these days I will but to me it don't matter because I know my lips have stammered like Hannah I prayed and I haven't been able to bring words I've just been we've been in cried rejoicing so I know I've had experiences like that amen so I know I've had it like that but it doesn't matter I mean once you have a great but now you got to live with that inoculation that you received let's live with that amen let's prove to everybody you got the right inoculation look at that that's and look at verse 12 this is what blew me away and last year I was reading the scripture to whom he said this is the rest like like there's no debate about what the rest is is it Saturday or is it getting so full so filled with the Holy Ghost you can hardly form sentences which one is a church is it is it saturday or stammering stammering that is the rest that's when you're really rest from sin when you fall so unleavened God he fills you up you're gonna only talk and then you want to tell everybody about it won't you come down from that mountain that's exactly right don't you love God's Word oh thank you Jesus with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people whom he said this is the rest wherever you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear so though the world Lord was under them precept upon precept line upon precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there know that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken all right let's go to first Corinthians 14 now this is the chapter if you are Bible reader or you got good memory with the Bible this is the chapter on tongues how many know that you know about tongues really read first Corinthians 14 you know all about tongues 13 is all about love 12 is all about the gifts in general 14 is all about tongues and rightly so God used these stammering tongues to give everybody rest on the day of Pentecost God thought so much of this stammering blabbering experience booth who experienced God's Optimo so much of it he had to write a whole chapter on it in chapter 14 all right now verse 21 22 actually let's let's go back to 18 I thank my god I speak tongues with tongues more than y'all yet in church says he yet into the church so he must have spoken tongues a lot in his prayer closet yet in the church I'd rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue brethren be not children understanding how be it malice be children but an understanding be men in the law it is written I look here it is with men of other tongues and other lips will I speak in this people and yet for all that they will not hear saith the Lord how many know that's quoting Isaiah 28 if you look in your Scofield reference there and it quotes it right there it's letter e isaiah 28:11 and 12 paul is directly quoting he's talking about tongues and so he goes back as a 28 11 and 12 he quotes that in order to prove that that was the rest that God's rest came was with stammering lips and another tongue glory verse 22 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe so see but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe praise the Lord so it doesn't take to speak in unknown tongues to get me but to believe because I'm already a believer right but I want to see somebody speak in tongues whoever it is and then a prophecy right that's why we pray after somebody speaks in tongues right yeah because that is for me thanks God oh yeah I wouldn't know what that voice said because God might be talking to me and that's why I Church Dodd I've asked you many times I'm going to continue asking with all the love my heart we should come either you should pray it for half an hour before you come to church or come here and pray half an hour before church because that's how brother Branham said that's how you want to come if you want to see the gifts operate that's what he said over and over again over Oh from 58 all the way to 63 I can show you that if you want to see the power of God you've got to make a way for God praise the Lord you've got to do that like I was telling her the Amen on Sunday morning after that movie the Holy Ghost I said with Amen before service I was at the altar here for 30 minutes and I prayed this I said Jesus when you came on Palm Sunday first the palms were laid and then you came in your glory and I said Lord I'm laying my palms right here and let the Lord come and glory in church he came hallelujah thank the Lord not prayed that many times before died maybe I don't feel like he came it is great glory what I'm saying is that there's some there's a way there's an approach to getting what we need from God and it's through prayer all right so that's why I've always preached that that's how I've always asked that that's why I continue to ask that that's why I continue to model it before the church that's the way we get in touch with God is by prayer and by sacrificing and preparing for the word to come that's right so can everybody see that forty years can be a good thing how many can see that and then the rest is a type that rests after getting the victory is a type when you get the victory you'll finally die out to yourself because my dad said when you surrender not fully he'll come in fully yes they met when you finally slay your will when you file like bourbon ever says that veil of self-will before the holiest of all when you finally tear that thing all the way and you say let to me for me to live is Christ to die it is my gain when you can finally rent that balance in my whole life is for Jesus Christ then you'll get in the prints of God you'll be born again ha ha ha that's right bleh now if you want to watch that like I said I can send you the link or you can just go on our our page there but that's that what I just taught there was on that video to try to show that they apply to Christians the only one that's different is the fourth commandment Saturday sabbath-keeping is not done away with but it has a new application now go to acts 20 verse 7 that just kind of came to my mind here and every Saturday Sabbath person I've had 4 or 5 the last year that comes to me I go they say well that's not in the Bible worshiping on Sunday it's not in the Bible and I have to say well did you eat acts 20 verse 7 I don't say that arrogantly but with patience in my heart have you ever read acts 20 verse 7 this is when Paul preaches all night and eutychus was it fell out the window and God raised him up by the power of God and all night preaching that's a real a night preacher right now they could do that church because he wasn't going to be back right I missed the last time they may heard him preach so they'd say preach preach on we may do that sometime brother if you keep saying Amen like that we may do that some night hopefully snot on the work night but we'll see if we didn't preach all night we probably such anointing we could work the next day but you see they had such a burden for the word they could preach all night yes they could sit up and say praise the Lord Paul and member brother Graham said he was filled with the Holy Ghost but he was scholarly like remember he said that he said Peter was the firebrand he said Andrew was the pray lawyer and Paul was the scholarly one so Paul would come in there and he'd preach he say he get out as scrolls as they see this is where he said it right here in Isaiah right here look look it say okay now let me hold well on this one this is where he said I hear in Genesis look at this imagine you know cleave to his wife and this is a mystery about him speaking concerning Christ in the church you see God has all different kinds of gifts to meet all of the needs of the body everybody before I forget if you don't have one of my books and you want to pass them out I got a bunch out there on the shelf you can take them with you no cost it's just to get the word out and your pastors already read it he loved it so so it's okay and I just got word back today from Tim Pruitt Tim fruits read it and he wants to buy one for everybody in his church that was a real blessed that really blessed my heart so we'll see you know but those who are hungry and thirsty will be filled because it's God's Word it's not our word you and I have no good word except he gives us the word now look Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel and that land had rests how many fourscore that's 80 years so not 40 but a double portion 80 right like I told you our land has America's had rests for all these years where we've had rest I wonder why that rest came is because of real Christian soldiers that are willing to shed their blood for this type of lifestyle freedom freedom to worship worship however you want but Jesus Christ reigns amen not tyranny not dictatorship but freedom freedom of religion God's bless this nation more than any other nation that's why I'm proud to be an American in one way one way am i ashamed of her sins of course but I'm proud of her past and I want to live closer to God like those men amen now of course we know she and garbs after that now he who'd or a HUD was the deliverer up here so he lives such a godly life he lives such a victorious life before God God ended his muscle Authority I said I'm he said I'm giving you 80 80 years of rest because of your faithful service to God oh my our God is so loving is he not look at that church that's the Word of God that's the God word you know what God wants you and I to be he wants you and I to raise up and be delivers in our families deliver people from sin yeah witness to people pray for them save them God wants you and I to be delivers as well now I'm give me 15 more minutes I want to try to finish up here so I don't wear a canary tell have already preacher real hard tonight yeah it's just did I forget about haha so God gave me grace that the blood reach to the lowest Valley Amen so that all that enemies perish Oh Lord but let them that love him be as a son when he goeth forth and his mind oh that's how I want to be and the land had rest forty years this was after Deborah Deborah member Deborah got the anointing never got the prophesy and then she went and shared with barrack but did you notice in Hebrews 7 who did point out it point out barrack because he was the leader that day he's the one who had to decide is this spirit on his sister of this judge remember she's in politics she wasn't in the Levitical priesthood and that was a backs to the nation right right and so he had he's the one had to decide as this the Lord or not he said yes but then look Frasor he said I'm only going if you go with me but the Bible gives credit to barrack in Hebrews 11 because he's the Lord had to make the decision now is this a time and season I'm the leader of the hour is this the right anointing so he too went to God and he must God must have showed him this is the hour of victory and after he took that woman's jointing it and took her word of prophecy they had forty years of no slavery to any evil person Amen hallelujah imagine Aaron by the hose a they got to raise their children and they'd have to tell me well this is why we're in slavery because you know your dad is addicted to porn right that right they have to say well this is what you know we're slaves today because you know your grandpa was a murderer your grandmother was a gossiper and broke up family she's a prostitute that's why we're in slavery day wearing these chains know they could walk out for and say we're free the godly men obeyed the Word of God and now you're free enjoy the fruits of freedom because God has blessed all of our efforts to please a man one day I would tell my children all the testimony all my testimony the reason you guys are free the children the reason you have a good life the reason you're not being abused and hurt all these things is because God's grace has shined upon our family amen now Matt guys been in some houses right Malachi has been in some houses when I've done some witnessing and he's seen some pretty dirty houses right up there in Akron he's seen some houses that do not have the blessing of God on them are you worth you write Milka you've seen him drugs prostitution he's been in some places I didn't even know I was taking him there of course I would not have taken in their head and known it was going on evil and he's seen a cursed house how much more should we be grateful for the blessings of God upon our homes amen you ought to thank your mom and dad and grandpa whoever prayed for you you ought to thank them for praying for you I called my mom off last month I said thank you mom she said for what I said for praying for my wretched soul because now I see all the blessings of your prayers right upon my life what is it God honors those who honor him hallelujah Gideon had great victories and so God gave them quietness for 40 years in the days of Gideon 40 years me a good number of rest candidate you may struggle for 40 years you may struggle for 40 days the one that applies to us mostly will be 40 days right for the race you hadn't you've had battles that lasts more this has been a hard month right all right when is April going to get over this has been an awful month I've had a few months like that lately a couple not goodness and I wonder if we go back and count I wonder if we'd see it maybe was 40 days or so you know give or take a few because God allows tests in 40s wants to see how we're gonna respond but because of God's grace to Gideon had 40 years of a quiet quiet life now did you know the Bible said this you know all the time Church I think I mentioned this a few times in the last years all the time you know we think well a book of Acts church has got to have all kinds of persecution and all kinds if we're really the true church will have miracles and and we'll have such persecution but look what Paul tells the Saints at that solonian I'm not saying we should have miracles we should have miracles but there's gonna be a time I believe and I think we've lived it I know I feel like I've lived it we're all I should have a peaceful quietness to them because of God's blessing upon our lives look what the Bible says as touching brotherly love you need not that I riding you for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another and indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are all Macedonia to see Macedonia was a local city we should have love to the Saints in Sheffield right we should have love to the Saints in Lorraine and I'm glad we do we have love you know you guys do - we should have love for any church that's local right any church we shouldn't have any bitterness against any message Church we should be filled with love toward them that if anyone that walked in here and disbelieved or disagrees what we said we can still shake their head and say God bless you may may Lord be with you sir and he said I beseech your brother that you increase more and more and that you study to be what study to be obnoxious and arrogant to be abusive on no social media and badger people study to be quiet and do your own business now this words quiet means to not be into other people's personal business let people's dirty laundry write people's problems that you don't want people to know about like my mistakes I don't want my mistakes hanging out in social media well brother Jesse made a mistake let's all bash him and that's all yeah ridicule him I don't want there that's why I don't even criticize politicians on social media I don't because I know there's a law that if I attack them God might allow me God might allow me to be attacked right so I'm very careful what I put on social media study be quiet do your own business and work with your own hands see you never have to tell Christian could you just get a job and stop having to rely upon brother so-and-so all the time right like we've had in this church for the last few years people that just want to sit around and do nothing and won't even go get a job when there's a where there's a restaurant right down the street they can go bus tables right you don't have to tell Christian to work because if there are son of Adam Adam was charged at work if you're a son or daughter of Adam and Eve you'll work to see as we command you that you may walk honestly toward them with it or without and that you may have lack of nothing so see this means not being in a gossip not not getting into people's business that you shouldn't be a part of now as a pastor I often have to get involved with people's business that's my job qualification but see I don't put your business out on social media do I Jose I've ever put any your troubles out on social media have you ever put any of my troubles out on social media brother Jose see why because we have brotherly love for each other cuz he knows I'm a man I make mistakes and I know he's a man he makes we all make mistakes see let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness see we always see how little we are that each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things now look we're supposed to look every man I'm thinking we should look at other people but not get into their business in the wrong way so we should try to help them out and constantly who can I help do you need food do you need help you need a new shirt you know do you need a new Bible you need a book you need a message whip you know write need a new computer right we should look to the help their needs but not get into their personal lives and try to gossip about it every understand and Paul says that's a quiet life that's the kind of quiet life he said you should study to be quiet and I appreciate that I know there's people in this church that have reached out to others and say can I help you with something do you need help with this do you need help with that and I appreciate that don't you but you because that's that's what we're fulfilling every man is supposed to look upon the needs of others that's a real Christian Church when we care and love each other so much here that we actually reach out and say can we help you with anything that's real Christianity because you don't look at your own self well I got everything I need who I can forget about everybody else now I can go watch Netflix or something like that you're gonna get caught in the Satan's Netflix that's for sure isn't that right yeah your God isn't that that's for sure yeah and with all the younger to speak in the younger widows learned to be idle wandering about from house to house see this is what he's talking about he says study to be quiet don't wander from a hospice and not only idle but tattlers also well did you know brother Jesse does this in his home he shouldn't do that he's a bastard and preacher you see I'm saying there busybodies tattlers you should have seen what Jose did the other week goodness after jerk he went out said someone do you even think he's got the Holy Ghost see Church we gotta be very careful what we say busybodies speaking things which they ought not to say all right let me I got five minutes let me close I'll try to finish this thought and Dave was thirty years old he beginner and he reigned 40 years Solomon reigned 40 years see 40 can be a good number a man after God's own heart he reigned 40 years glory joash remember he was a seven year old king right he reigned how long 40 years and he did that which was right in the side of the Lord in the seventh year jay who reigned 40 years reign he injures and I'm sorry Jay go ash Jihu ash he reign 40 years and Jihu ash Jehu ash did that which was right in the side Lord in all the ways all the days wearing Jahoda of the high priests instructed him but the high places were not taken away so he was kind of like did a pretty good job but not all the way now I want to close with this this is what I started on this one when I close with know some of these things are very familiar but I just want to close to this Jesus was seen 40 days the disciples before he sent it and led them captive now Church was this a hard time for the sciples or is this a glorious time so disciples glorious this was not a bad forward this is not like oh this is so awful seeing Jesus all over the place brother Ram said at any turn of the corner they were looking I can see Jesus over here every turn a quarter is Christ around here or under great expectation the Lord Jesus is alive Haven this was in 40 days of class or trials this is 40 days of God proving that they can rest from the noise the crutch was not amen oh but he had a greater rest coming about ten days after that brother a ha ha ha the baptismal all the games amen which came the truth yes but he called that Pentecost he called that Jubilee a man with the stammering lips and another tongue eats big and give them rest in their souls for 40 days I'm gonna prove to you infallibly that Jesus Christ is alive now I'm gonna skip this program I'm talking about in every Church age he said Jesus was put out of the age and every Church age there was a messenger he spoke the word and then the people after that after he died they kicked him out wish I could hear about two or three weeks on Bible teaching or prophecy see where we were living friends what's the matter with people can't you see we're at the end time it's all over the next thing will be a sweep with that little group together in a month or so she'll be gone as soon as she's gathered together as soon as we're gathered under the ladder head in right because that's what's got to gather us together the Holy Spirit has to gather us together right a fresh anointing whether that's enough refilling the Holy Ghost for those who already got it and a fresh feeling for those who haven't got it yet hey man million he says about a month or so and Perry Green said this is where bo-ram he was talking to him afterwards you can hear on Peregrine's testimony out of any business church he said this Ribera said 'that's the 40 days he was later talking with him after the service this was in 1962 the next thing will be that little group gathering together well we're at the end there's no hopes of nowhere run to Christ people run to Christ that's what you did tonight run to Christ now you probably owe this one the greatest battle greatest news flash in history he says I'm mom those great outstanding glorious 40 days were they awful days but ma'am said glorious that our Lord was on earth appearing to disciples and others after his resurrection I have stood a many time and thought what if I could have been there you magic walking just walking and Jesus a walk out from behind a car something like for our day somebody just join you start walking with you hey what are you guys talking about oh you're talking about a rapture Oh tell me what do you know about the rapture oh you mean Christ is going to come back and there's a ladder rain and all these things tell me about that what other scriptures now hopefully this time we will he won't cause fools so to believe hopefully you'll say oh you faithful wise virgin a fool today men oh you know the scriptures and Here I am praise God a man you're getting ready for the rapture amen that I met I never thought about that that's how it should go we instead of being fool sorta believe we should be wise already believin that's fresh for you craz alone there that great expectation that how that every mend the road you might meet with him face to face that resurrected Lord Jesus what a thrill would have been to have met him and know that that was he every bend in the road on your drive home tonight every curve turning the corner and maybe there's a man standing there that could be Jesus then you turn another another one well maybe that man's Jesus he's about 5 foot 3 5 foot 2 ugly looking guy you know he's not do handsome right ya know Beauty we desire not a real handsome man but that could be the Lord Jesus con between God and Satan look at this he said filming he said the spirit don't have flesh and bones got let he said like you got to eat so I've got something eat he had fish and bread and he was with them for days proving like Joshua that the land was there all the church can you believe that Taemin is your face strong enough for that is my faith that we start seeing the dead Saints Rick it will prove to us again because we already know by the Holy Spirit but it'll prove to us that that sixth dimension that seventh dimension is there it'll prove that that land exists he's the evidence of the land there Joshua and Caleb were evidence they'd been there and they came back when we say in the Dead come back it's evidence there is a land there it's proof I know the rapture is coming soon by the Jess I've seen them you know you might come to church maybe maybe Aaron sees them first brother Jesse the rapture is gonna be soon well that's great brother I believe that too maybe in the next year so no brother Jesse this I've seen I've seen my grandpa I've seen brother Branham it's gonna be very soon now you and I couldn't argue with that now he would not as much as happy as he is now think think about how happy he'd be if he saw brother Branham we know brother Aaron is a pretty happy guy pretty joyful guy comes a man and but think about how he act if he saw Saint Paul the great st. Paul or how about John the Divine the apostle of love I'm at one of us would act whoever saw of his where we walk in here a little differently to church right Aaron would walk in here to open the door he'd go around the corner of the prayer request table just thought maybe Mary would be there open the sanctuary door peek in there order for Andrew the prayer warriors up at the altar there right it would be such expectation he would have proof supernatural proof and he'd have nothing to pray he couldn't show it to us we'd have to see it on him and then his spirit would bear witness with our spirit yeah is that right that's why God give you the Holy Ghost so your Holy Ghost can give witness that somebody else has got the Holy Ghost amen proof that that land is their number ten quotes are first Corinthians I'm sorry 1st Thessalonians 4 about the rapture look at the order see God knows that we long to see our loved ones and if we got there to meet him first we've been looking around to see if mother dad and the rest one was there but see how the wisdom of the Holy Spirit they meet one another first and then we get there and sing amazing grace that's when they're going to be a time of worship you think I act funny now Church watch me up there do you think we're exiting now or crazy now or the night when we get to the heavenly sky what a good one I better get to the meeting in the air oh I think we'll just when we saw beyond ourselves but before that God wants to take out all the questions if this person made the rapture or that one he's gonna let us see all those that are going to be there so when we get up to the sky we're not looking like well there's Jesus but where is dad where's mom Tiberium said that's the reason we're going to see the resurrected ones first so we know who's already in it there's no wonder about a so then we all get the body change we'll only let the Jesus oh the wisdom of God praise the Lord and to think of us standing in modes we can die when the world won't know what's going on but all of a sudden you'll see up here before you your loved one that's gone on has come to unite with you again and we'll be changing a moment twinkling of an eye and be caught up together to meet our Lord in the air and the unite with him to be there forever and never to be out of his presence again if Jesus let the Old Testament Saints rise and be seen 40 days for his first coming don't you think he'll do it on a second coming don't you think he's the same yesterday today and forever don't you think God wants us to have that same faith that they had that same expectation that same desire to have no worries about the rapture to have no question about the rapture because we'll be having supernatural experiences happening to us he said all that at that the trumpet sound you happen to stand look and well there's a brother and you know it ain't long in a few minutes we'll be changed in a moment wink of an eye and together with them be missing on earth and caught up to meet the Lord in the air oh thank you lord oh won't that be a time just walk along someday and here appears somebody who is it mother amen it ain't going to be long now just in a few minutes your changed now look brother branham starts naming people that died in the tabernacle here's brother sewer that old brother that used to be in the church here why there's brother de Ark he's that first black brother that brother man met at the Pentecostal meetings brother dark he stayed at his house that those verse meetings so why looky here they're all around me can you imagine not just one brother Ray but you're just surrounded by saints one two three four five six seven I imagine sevens completes it imagine you're surrounded by these before you ain't gonna be long now it's gonna be changed now just in a moment oh yes and the morning breaks eternal bright and fair let's send our feet and now if the coming of the Lord Jesus those who are really loving is coming that's living for how many living for it you're not living for money you're not living for worldly pleasures or sexual pleasures or not living for drug pleasures you're living for Christ that's really living for when he appears in the sky the church that's dead in Christ sure eyes and those will be changed in a moment the rest of them will know nothing about it remember appear to those in the city see the rapture be like that we'll see each other we'll see them the rest of the world won't see them and it'd be caught away as a seeker going waiting for that time now I'm gonna stop right there I have up to 49 but I'm going to stop right there for time sake by God's grace how many love the Lord tonight oh let's just thank the Lord can we just thank the Lord thank you for your word Jesus thank you for your word Lord God how do you thank you lord praise the Lord if God was so certain to let the Saints know that this was rapture time at the bit at the first coming of Christ you know he'll do it for us as well he'll do it for us if he gave him fallible proofs of his resurrection after the first resurrection what about the second what about the rapture certainly God is rich in mercy Church and he put these in numbers and numbered it 40 so we know he gave us a number now think about I just thought about this think of all the church services you can have in 40 days let me pull this up here real quick let me pull my calendar 40 days maybe seven seven or eight services can you imagine the anointing that would be in the church during those services the whole world would know nothing about it but we would be seeing people surrounding us that have died and gone on and they're not old and they don't have scholars on them they're 21 years old again I just saw my grandpa on Saturday night and now I'm coming to church Sunday morning what is your worship gonna look like when we sing hallelujah we shall rise and you just saw your bill Paul raised last night amen think about that and this is not a fairytale Church this is thus saith the Word of God forty days he did it I'm not saying this is the said the Lord program didn't say that that but I'm saying what he did for forty days was thus saith the Lord his first coming and he's likely he's as a pattern a God who works in patterns he's likely to do it again David ah what a glory it is how glorious it is to be alive in this day where we could be the ones all right the only group in history that will ever defeat death and bypass death as a whole group now [Music] individuals have done it but it's never been done by a group before we would be part of the first and only group the Bride of Christ his wife that would bypass death and not have to die and walk into a glorified eternal condition because of his grace in His mercy because we chose the walk in the light such a beautiful light oh let's just bow our heads for a moment and pray here tonight how many want to be a part of that special time if that don't you come let's raise our hands to god let's pray ask God to help us to be prepared for that time Emily father we love you tonight lord thank you for your word thank you for your prophet or your prophet seems to say this over and over again this forty not the forty of persecution but the forty of rest where Lord you'll give us forty days perhaps to rest in the fact that we know we'll be a part of the rapture you'll take all the questions out about well as this family member going to be there that Pastor dog is that family member is that friend from the church you're gonna take all the questions out so we won't be looking for them because we already have seen them amen Oh all's we'll be looking for is you Jesus amen god help us those who are desiring this law help us to love your appearing more now than ever before and lo let us come to church every service with that expectation Lord God that you could come in a moment of Twinkie of and I help us to make ready in our homes help us to make lady in our services Lord God for the King of glory to come down in each service Lord I know that each and every year that passes on each and every month but we can be more sure that we will be at the meeting in the air Lord God and we can have that rest that because we've entered into your spiritual rest the baptism of the Holy Ghost if anyone here is not born again Lord I pray in Jesus Christ's name they'll get serious about their walk with you and have a time of cleaning out their houses cleaning out their lives and seek your face that they might be mourned again and have this stammering lips experience everybody which I believe we saw on Sunday after first service Lord God I believe we saw someone standing there Lord God smiling and crying and shouting and screaming and praising God hallelujah I believe we've seen that Lord God and we're grateful but Lord all those in the hearing of my voice are livestreamer present God made should everyone make ready Lord God pnow at the house as your puppet said to apply the token clean out all the trash out of your house or life granite Lord Jesus help us Lord to rest and cease from sin and do the works of the Holy Ghost show us Lord if we're not pleasing you in some area please show us Lord God so we can make that weak spot Lord a strong spot as we said on Sunday Lord Gandhi say he got Moses in his weak spot where when he came to Christ Christ had no weak spots hallelujah because he knew the word he was filled with the Holy Ghost help us Lord God to overcome our weak spots by the Word of God we thank you for this Lord in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen thank the Lord first mercy thank you Jesus praise God hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord praise God I seen that little hymn there that what you were quoting
