========================================

that as we looked at that on Wednesday by God's grace I'd like to preach on uh the breach between part four I'd like to try to finish this this morning uh I usually have my hour and a half hopefully I can do that by God's grace we'll see how it goes Revelation chapter 5 if you turn in your Bibles Revelation chapter 5 so read here by God's grace let's see I'm sorry let's read rather uh verses 8 n and 10 I'll read eight and N then we can just read 10 together there by God's grace and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayer of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation verse 10 let's read that together ready one two three and H has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth may God add his Blessing to ring of his word you can be SE so we'll take a little thought on this here part four uh the breach between I just want to get a quick definition of sublime brother brother Brandon mentioned Sublime so we'll look to that here by God's grace sorry about that so we'll look here part four and we're going to pick up here here uh where we kind of left off there on Wednesday night sorry how many thankful for the eight covenants praise God everybody thankful for that Hallelujah I've been thankful for that thank God for Amazing Grace the blood of Jesus Christ uh to redeem us back to what we read here to be Kings and Priests unto God hallelujah so uh we we'll look at here uh this first part of the of the the the chapter uh we looked at verses 1 through seven the last three services here last time we ended with uh last last two Wednesdays ago rather with the line of the tribe of Judah Jesus is the lion of the tribe of Judah Hallelujah he's the root of David uh this speaks of course of the godhead that speaks of someone who came before David and this person is still alive Hallelujah and the Bible said no man was worthy so uh this can't be a man a natural man a natural descendant of David it's got to be the god before David Hallelujah the God who created David it's got to be the root of all men it's got to be God Almighty Hallelujah so we see the godhead uh plainly in this uh scripture here in verses uh five and six and seven Hallelujah and we ended with how brother random talked about when he was out in Africa hunting he'd hear all the animals the elephants and uh the Beatles and everything he said but when that lion would Roar everything was quiet Hallelujah brother Ram said that's a type he said of right here he said of this Bible when the Bible speaks he said every doubt is quietened hallelujah every denomination is silence brother Ram says when the Bible speaks hallelujah amen and so we're thankful Hallelujah that we're not denominated Hallelujah but we're free in Christ Jesus uh brother Ram said we're not an organization he said we're an organism we are a living organism Hallelujah Lord we are part of the body of Christ aren't you gladen hallelujah amen uh we are the body of Jesus Christ and Paul says that some might be the nose and the ear and the finger and the thumb he said one member can't say to the other I don't have a need of you because in a natural body you have need of all your members Amen in fact you only feel normal when your whole body is in one Accord Hallelujah if one thing gets thrown off uh the rest Everything feels like it's awful right every you get one major injury or one major uh sickness and it feels like the world's going to end right uh is this the end you might ask yourself and that's how it is in the body of Christ we have to be uh uh fully aware of one another the Bible said one member must care for the other each and every member must feel one for the other praise God when one weeps we must all weep when one rejoices we must all Rejoice Hallelujah and so we're a body we're a living organism Hallelujah we see it mainly from the scripture as we said from 1 Corinthians 12 and other places but I want to look here back in Revelation 5 here I'm going to read uh some of these quotes starting uh paragraph 151 from the breach if you haven't listened to that I really encourage you to do that listen to uh the second half of it yesterday beautiful beautiful ending to The Sermon Hallelujah and brother man said now we go when we go into breaking these seals you're going to see it goes Plum back in the scripture all the way back for each one of those seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals see every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals brother knocks on the pulpit five times and the seals cannot be broken until that time I prove it here in just a minute he says remember the book is sealed here's one here it is this seal then another one is wrapped another seal another one's wrapped a seal it's a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book it's seal with Seven Seals he says and the seal mystery is on the inside it only says white horse rider or black horse rider and what more on the on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in them seals from Genesis to Revelation the complete Plan of Redemption is revealed in these Seven Seals and oh it's an important time God help us he says to get it Hallelujah so I just want to uh share this in case if you can switch over here I just want to share this little visual uh by God's grace I kind of made a I made a video the other just the other day about this but I just want to bring this out you know that uh I haven't spent maybe just maybe one hour maybe less looking at this idea but brother Ram said the whole mystery lays in those seals I thought my that's just quite a statement to make isn't it the whole mystery of the Bible and Redemption lays in the seals well what's the word redemption mean it means purchase out of a slave market purchase and now you become the property of the person who purchased you actually it literally means a slave market if you look in the Greek there the word Redemption so somehow in the seals we see uh the purchase of the whole Plan of Redemption so the whole world must be somehow redeemed in the seals glory amen and what became a revelation to me as I made a put a video out yesterday was Revelation 5 is where we see that in Revelation 5 we see a lamb steps forth and John of course is crying uh because uh no man is worthy to look at the book and this is a very important book in heaven Hallelujah but then a lamb steps forth the voice says it's a lion but when John looks it's a lamb Hallelujah and it's bloody as it had been slain glory amen and so here uh we see a lamb comes forth and then the the voice says don't weep stop crying There's Hope Hallelujah the lamb has given us hope amen and then the voices say the lamb hath already redeemed us hallelujah and so we and then the Bible says uh they've been redeemed in verse n we've been redeemed out of every Kindred tongue people and Nation well every Kindred represents the Gentiles not just the Jews but in Revelation five we see the Gentiles are also Redeemed by the Lamb of God oh my and brother the whole plan the whole secret of of the Plan of Redemption is in the seals Hallelujah well that means everything you know from the Genesis all the way down everything in the Old Testament was foreshadowing who Jesus Christ brother said if you don't see Jesus in the Old Testament verse go back and read it again in amen because everything was pointing to Jesus Christ so 4,000 years of human history all uh accumulated in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ the death burial and Resurrection Hallelujah and we can see the whole Plan of Redemption fulfilled in these seals brother Ram tells us amen hallelujah now this is a little out of order but Revelation five we see the godhead because he's the root of David the LI of the tribe of Judah he's not like any other man Hallelujah he wasn't born in sin David said in in sin my mother conceived me but but David's mom wasn't in fornication and what what it means is the sin nature passed from David's parents to him Hallelujah and so a lamb had to come who is not born of sin he came by the Virgin birth God had to bypass the way sin came into the world through adultery right God had to bypass that and bring forth a lamb a worthy sacrifice who was virgin born in order to redeem every Kindred tribe tongue and Nation hallelujah amen hallelujah and so that shows us this is the secret of the whole Plan of Redemption Hallelujah because of Adam and Eve it it plunged all of humanity into sin and the only way to get them out was a redeemer Hallelujah a a price that could be paid and it had to be a virgin born Redeemer brother said a kinsman redeemer rer Hallelujah someone who is near to us hallelujah a relative oh that ought to make you happy you've got a relative in heaven and his name is Jesus Hallelujah he's your kidsman amen he's a part of the family of God your family Hallelujah I just read this morning in Acts 17 you are The Offspring of God you are God's Offspring you are God's children and remember the Bible said he's determined the times therefore appointed so God determined you live in the seven Church age and he determined the bounds of your habitation where you'd live amen hallelujah it was all in the mind of God it was all in the plan of God brother said nothing is out of cater amen the Rapture will be right on time hallelujah amen nothing's out of cater Hallelujah everything's going right according to the plan of God hallelujah amen he said the Rapture won't be one minute late Hallelujah so that means there's nothing we can do to speed it up there's nothing we can do to slow it down it's going to be right on time Hallelujah all you've got to do church is make yourself ready for the bride has made herself ready hallelujah amen each time you hear the voice of God you just got to accept what the word of God says apply it to your life Hallelujah and God will make you ready for his coming hallelujah how many believe we're getting the word in due season Hallelujah I believe it I believe it I believe we're a church that has unleavened bread Hallelujah brother man said all the the leavens got to be cleaned out Paul says that in 1 Corinthians 5 all the leavens got to be cleaned out and then you feel like a new lump a new church hallelujah praise God a church without sin a church without guilt a church without condemnation that's the Blood Bought Church that's the Church of the Living God hallelujah amen glory now but said the whole Plan of Redemption so here we already see the redemptions by the lamb God God brother said God became kin folks unto us hallelujah God became a man Hallelujah CU his own law required a kinsman redeemer his own law required an innocent substitute an innocent sacrifice and no one could provide it so God had to provide it himself Jehovah Gyra God provided himself a sacrifice hallelujah oh my glory but in the first seal we see at least two Mysteries the mystery of iniquity and you see the the first Beast right the first Beast tells John about this and the first Beast of course was the lion the lion anointing and brother said thus say the Lord those four beasts are the anointings of the Holy Spirit upon the seven Church ages so now we see the revelation of the church ages in the seals because you have to have the anointing for the church ages hallelujah amen oh it's beautiful and and so there's at least I think there's seven Mysteries here one that are actually called Mysteries the mystery of iniquity of course is the white horse rider it's the Antichrist Spirit he always starts remember he's got a foret process he starts as a false teacher right and then he goes to Red a bloody red and we know today if it's not we know today they are killing Christians in Nigeria all kinds of places I think 880,000 they said Christians have been killed in Nigeria within the last decade or something it's just awful it it turns bloody red and then it turns black the Blackness of uh of uh the the Blackness of of a kingdom right it sets up the kingdom it's a money Kingdom with a balance and they take over it's the Dark Ages it darkens out the whole body it darkens out their whole false church and the last step is the pale death death sets in spiritual death sets in and they basically uh cross the line of line between mercy and judgment we're talking about false churches brother calls that Jezebel religion right and so that's the mystery of iniquity it starts with it's just a false it starts with a saying and then it turns to a Doctrine and then it becomes the unbending way Hallelujah that's right so we see that now I don't really have any Revelations for the second seal but the third seal we see the oil and wine and the oil is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and the wine brother says the stimulation of Revelation remember Ephesians 17 says we should be under the spirit of wisdom and Revelation amen hallelujah and so we must be under the spear John said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day amen so we when we come to church or when we We Gather with the Saints we can't be under our our spirit we got to be under God's spirit Hallelujah and then the Revelation comes amen hallelujah and then I have nothing really on the four seal but the fifth seal and of course the beasts are in each one of these but then the fifth seal is the Bible calls it Israel's blindness that is a mystery they were you know in the Old Testament Israel was grafted into the holy tree but they were cut off yet God still saves the people as long as they keep the testimony of the the word of God they don't have the testimony of Jesus Christ because they're blinded to it but God will save them because they're blinded and we see them under the altar saying how long to you avenge our blood how long how long Lord holy and true amen hallelujah I love it I love it God is talking to them in heaven even though they didn't know Jesus Jesus is merciful even though Jesus blinded them he's talking to them amen my what a mighty God we serve amen what a god of Mercy what a God of Grace hallelujah amen and then I love this six seal this one just exploded it felt like it exploded in my thoughts yesterday The Sixth Seal brother BR calls it the tribulation seal right and I just started thinking about that well that ties in Daniel 70 weeks right and Daniel 70 weeks has the Everlasting uh righteousness which is the Millennium right Gabriel's six-fold purpose of vising the last one was bringing Everlasting ing righteousness right so we know once uh once Israel is redeemed it'll bring in the Millennium no wonder brother said the whole Plan of Redemption is in these seals hallelujah oh we can go back to the beginning we can go back to the beginning and see it was adultery was the fruit the forbidden fruit right we can go back to the beginning and then we can see how God uh grafted in the Gentiles he had to cut off the Jews but he's bringing both Jew and Gentile back back Hallelujah he's taking two folds and he's going to make one fold Hallelujah so all the Sheep of God can be in the fold of God the fold of the great Shepherd Hallelujah no wonder brother says the whole Plan of Redemption is seen in those seals hallelujah amen oh my thank you Lord amen you even have mystery Babylon in there because that's that's where she gets judged during the the six seal another mystery how Hallelujah then you get the 144,000 SE with the Holy Ghost that's their Redemption that's when they recognize we've been purchased we've been bought by the blood of the lamb and we confess our sins and a spe and a fountain is open in the House of David think of it all these let let me just just dramatize it all these think about all the 145 44,000 they're blinded they're garments are still kind of dirty think of that you and I look at each other our gu we really have spiritual garments of white on if I looked at William he's got a nice blue and black there like me huh blue and black but really it's a white garment Hallelujah and if you looked at me the right way you'd see a white garment Hallelujah but in Israel the 144,000 now they're growing to that number spiritually they might look they're they're really rich or they really look really nice you know but really they got garments that are dirty and they got blindfolds on they're walking around stumbling through the darkness think about that but we're and and now the whole world around us is doing the same right but they're totally actually the Bible says they don't even have garments they're naked spiritually they don't even have they're just in sin blinded right but we've got white garments on but when Jesus reveals himself he shows them where'd you get those I got those in the house of my friends Hallelujah and when he shows it the Bible said they'll mourn they'll weep and then in one day 144,000 will'll get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and the blinders will come off and the the garments they'll wash their garments in the fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins hallelujah oh the whole Plan of Redemption Hallelujah is in these seals thank God we're Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah now I'm going to come back to that so I'm going to pull it off just because then your eyes don't hurt Hallelujah so I love what brother Ram says that's the first point I want to bring and that that comes out of this sermon the whole Plan of Redemption is in those seals oh my see I could take a whole another sermon on that because what's our anointing the eagle anointing right where where uh I was listening yesterday to a preacher Eagles actually conceive their children mating in the air they're actually conceived in Heavenly places and you were chosen in Christ in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world no wonder the Bible says you and I are already accepted in the Beloved hallelujah amen that's where our Eagle children are made that that's where they're formed Hallelujah in Heavenly places Hallelujah and then the Bible says if you need strength wait on the Lord and God will renew your strength like the eagle praise God so you can soar You Can Fly Above All these Earthbound elements get your eyes off of the things of the world and get Your Eyes On Christ to give you a Heavenly perspective of things hallelujah oh my that's part of redemption Hallelujah that's part of our Redemption amen now we can see it plainly hallelujah what a beautiful message there brother Ram gives us now I want to read this one too brother R said the Angel's call was for the kinsman redeemer to appear God said I have a law a kinsman redeemer can be a substitute where's that kinsman redeemer who's able to take it and it come from Adam all the way down through the apostles and Prophets and everything else and nobody was found now what about it nobody in heaven nobody on Earth nobody that ever lived brother said Elijah was standing there so Adam Elijah Moses was standing there now here's an interesting thought before I forget here you've got Old Testament Saints now if this is true I'm just saying if it's a if Old Testament Saints in the seventh dimension that's a quote okay now we know at least 24 are there in the seventh Dimension praise God right now we know brother man went beyond the curtain of time here's why I'm sharing this he said that voice said you can't see him yet because he's higher well the only way higher you could go is the seventh Dimension right okay so just thought I'd lay that in there just for your thoughts okay I don't know if this is dramatized or what but we know we have at least 24 that are in that seventh dimension the souls on the altar would be in the sixth Dimension the altar of incense right where the Bible says they're under the altar crying how long that's where the Jews are Hallelujah I believe also the foolish virgin are there as well that's what I believe they got to have a place where they can go Hallelujah where there's not torment where there's uh Sublime life Hallelujah where there's eternal life amen hallelujah he said all the apostles were standing there or all the ones that had died all the holy men job and the Sages so you got Moses Adam Elijah job standing there everyone standing there and nobody was even worthy to look at the book let alone to take it and break the seals now brother says this now where is the pope and all these at they call him Holy Father Heaven said no man is Holy Hallelujah where is these message preachers that are the greatest of all time where's their Hool that's right I'm just I'm just sharing that you know just a thought where's the pope where's Mary brother said where's Mary Mother of God Mother of God we know it's not true God don't have a mother right brother said where is your Bishop now we're not we don't have a bishop where he says where is our worthiness ah he says we're nothing that's right Hallelujah he asked for the kinsman redeemer to step forward if he could but said no man is worthy all right now switch back here here we go now our precious brother Paul how many enjoyed his sermon last Sunday morning oh was a masterpiece I I probably say that too much but but I'll say like this we got the Holy Ghost lots of sermons are going to be masterpieces because the man has yielded to God right Hallelujah now we went to this church I've been there twice right I preached twice there my family went once malach has been twice I think he's got this hanging up by the pastor's office anybody recognize any pictures in there he said that's Moses because there's a statue of Moses I think Michelangelo did it or some famous he's got those horns coming up you know because they thought in those days uh they had horns I forget why they had horns oh his mistranslation of the Bible okay now this is Elijah now look brother Paul put the pillar of fire there because our Elijah had a pillar of fire and the pillar of fire would had to guide Elijah and Elisha because the spirit of God right Hallelujah the Bible said John the Baptist Spirit of Elijah was a burning and Shining Light hallelujah amen and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove amen so the pillar of fire always accompanies the spirit of Elijah now look brother Paul and let let's just just read what he said here now that's the verse here here this is the same thing I just made it larger so y'all could read it don't have to strain your eyes the seven seal book was so sacred that even all the great sages of the Bible cannot even look at it only the Lamb of God Jesus Christ could take the book and open it for our Redemption so here's the pictures that brother Paul felt led to uh draw we got Moses Noah Daniel job and Elijah brother R mentioned now brother doesn't mention Daniel at least what I remember or Noah but he mentions Moses job and Elijah so look again but I just love this so this is the picture of our brother it had that he had in his mind right this is a manifestation of what he had in his mind Hallelujah John's crying no man's worthy and look the Bible said no no man can even look at the books everybody has turned away from the Throne of God no one's even worthy to look at it you know we know Moses wasn't worthy he murdered a man he didn't circumcise his boys and the angel was going to kill him right he he got angry he smoked the rock instead of speaking to the Rock You bunch of rebels that's real awful preacher talk isn't it right there right Noah got drunk you know right afterwards uh we don't have any bad on Daniel but he wasn't worthy right how about the grace of God that you live such a life God don't record that about you Daniel lives such a life Joseph's like that too Joseph just one time said you should lie because you're not Shepherds right uh who's that one job of course we know job we we preached through job pretty thoroughly a little bit and enjoyed that by God's grace Elijah we don't see much of him although when he when the anointing left him he ran away from the threat of Jezebel wanted to die he prayed that he would die he thought I'm the only one left God said I've got 7,000 that haven't bowed the knee Hallelujah just a beautiful picture and only one person's worthy Hallelujah the lamb who's bloody Hallelujah he's got seven eyes seven horns Hallelujah he's the only one worthy to take this book and remember this is a book of your Redemption this is a book of the rights and Dominion that Adam forfeited in the garden brother R said this is also the book of dominion he said eternal life amen Hallelujah and only one person was worthy to come and open this it was Jesus Christ Hallelujah so no matter how famous you are in heaven glory amen no matter what you've done no matter what your Works do nothing is greater than Jesus Christ Hallelujah because it was Jesus Christ that gave you the strength to do it hallelujah it's Jesus Christ that gave you the grace to do what you do hallelujah amen there'll be no boasting in heaven none of these guys could boast Hallelujah only one was worthy hallelujah oh I'm so glad that Jesus Christ is worthy Hallelujah and we know him Hallelujah brother said this is the most Sublime thing in scripture let me read you what Webster calls it sublim means lofty or grand exalted in thought expression or manner outstanding spiritual or intellectual or moral worth it means tending to Inspire awe or like this is awesome or uh usually because of elevated quality maybe beauty or nobility or Grandeur or Transcendent Excellence so Excellence Beyond Excellence brother Ram said Sublime Beyond Sublime in other words this is so high and lofty we can't really express it Hallelujah brother said this chapter is the most Sublime thing in the whole Bible Hallelujah because everyone was unworthy we weren't going to get eternal life we weren't going to get the rights back we weren't going to get Dominion back we weren't going to be able to live upon the Earth in the Millennium unless somebody came and took the book and opened it and revealed it to us and then sent it down to the seventh angel so that every he can preach it and then we can eat the book and take it to every Kindred tuong and Nation oh my oh it just it was impossible Hallelujah oh ah it's amazing Hallelujah another one is supreme complete or utter oh my how many enjoy that praise God just it's amazing so I thought I'd share that with you how many appreciate that I texted the brother the other day I'm like brother can you please send me that picture I want to show that to the Saints Hallelujah as such as soon as I saw I'm like that's inspired something struck me like that's of God that man's quite artist is he I appreciate how go he's using his talents for the Lord hallelujah amen so bam said Elijah Moses job all the sages were standing there no one had any Holiness he said we're nothing remember John 155 apart from him we can do nothing my life accomplishes nothing unless Christ is in it hallelujah how do I let him in it seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness amen that's how I let him in it Hallelujah I seek him I yield to him Hallelujah now I want to lay this in here this is a more of a message uh uh a message topic you know there's some message churches that say intercession is over now they're a very small group right uh and they say nobody else is getting saved I've had people tell that to different people I know and they've told me that that they believe no one else is getting saved now that's the extreme of it now the minor part is you can only get saved in a message church that's a false Doctrine it's still but still it's a minor form of what this other form is nobody's getting saved right now now see what does that do it stops people from having hope and praying for others it stops missionary work it stops Outreach you see how it shut no no it shuts down the faith of the people no wonder we looked at that uh heus and fitus I think it was Paul said they said the resurrection is already passed and their word eats as a canker see if you start believeing the wrong thing it's going to eat away the spiritual life that you have it's going to take away uh the Outreach of the church the hope of the church and the Bible said it destroys the faith of many oh we have we have we have the Bible said we have a hope that reaches Beyond the Veil in heaven Hallelujah see how these false doctrines they create this this uh uh this sick spiritual condition I'll say it like that now but here's why you know even brother Braham grew in his understanding so I want you to listen to this brother BR said now here comes a lamb now his intercessory days is over the M uh the mediatorial days okay so just bear with me on this he said that's when the angel is going to stand there you wait and we get them seals and time shall be no more uh case you put up Revelation 10 six boy I've been around a lot of preachers and you be interested I think every preacher has a little different thought on this here Revelation 10:6 so of course brother man's Ministry is revelation 10:7 right but Revelation 106 says and swear by him that liveth forever and ever this when the mighty Angel comes down with the open book The Seven Seals are broken Glory Allelujah and then he says uh that there shall be time no longer now you'd be surprised I'm sure brother Williams Heard lots of interpretations of this over the years too so this is this is the verse many false teachers misinterpret they say see when when brother Braham got the open book when brother preached the seals uh time was no more now we're in the Millennium there's some people that believe that nonsense because they misinterpret this right the only way that this makes sense is the right way that that it means there was no more time to wait wa for the seals to be open because the next verse says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished with he which he had declared to his servants the prophets amen got that one memorized hallelujah amen amen so see time will be no longer there's no more weight in other words this is when God is opening the book He's bringing it down he's revealing it to a seventh angel and everybody else has got to eat the book Hallelujah that's what your job is that's what my job is to eat the book The revelation of the Seven Seals Hallelujah but that that means the whole revelation of the entire Bible everybody understand so I'm not saying you just got to go listen to the seven seal sermons I'm saying you got to eat the whole book hallelujah amen you got to eat the whole Old Testament and New Testament Hallelujah so see so brother says here comes the lamb his intercession days are over he's talking about Revelation 5 the lamb comes forth out of the throne to take the book and brother said look his days of intercession are over that's why some people think there's no more intercession he says and you wait till we get to those seals and time shall be no more that half hour silence watch what takes place in that half hour of Silence when that seventh seal next Sunday night the Lord willing now pull up Revelation 81 I'm going to give you my I preached this before but I'm just going to lay these two out these are two of the most misunderstood scriptures in the whole message time shall be no longer people think oh uh there's no more time nonsense you just got to keep listening to brother brandom Hallelujah that's the problem they just don't listen to brother Ram enough uh and then this one when the Seven Seals broken there's uh silence in heaven about the space of half hour now I've heard all kinds of interpretations on this the only way that makes sense is what brother Ram said even before the seals in the church ages brother bam said the only way s Heaven would be silent is if the lamb left because all those cherubim are crying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty the Bible say they don't cease day and night so the only reason they'd stop praising Jesus is if Jesus left right but you you'd be surprised you know people said this half hour silence was in March of 63 right after brother R preached that and then half an hour after the service there was silence in heaven what what did that what would that accomplish nothing you know it doesn't make any sense the only way this makes sense is that at the Rapture when Jesus leaves heaven to meet us in the air Heaven is silent because the mediator left the lamb left but as soon as he gets back I'm GNA I'm I'm going to assume they're going to hit resume on their worship and as soon as Jesus gets back they're going to say holy holy holy it's the Lord God Almighty amen just takes a little bit of time for Jesus to leave Heaven snatch his bride away and bring her out bring her back to the wedding reception in heaven and the marriage suffer the lamb Hallelujah that's the only thing that makes sense now these false doctrines and false ideas get some sense to you preacher is what I want to say you know in a nice way you know get on your knees pray about it hallelujah look at what's happened over these last 60 years almost since brother Ram's been off the scene it's 59 years since brother Ram's been off the scene look what's happened people like you and me we weren't even looking for the message and God came looking for us that's proof enough that there's still time to be saved amen there's proof enough that Jesus is still in heaven making intercession Hallelujah that he could save a Wretch like Me Hallelujah I wasn't looking for him he came looking for me Hallelujah I was lost but now I'm found hallelujah amen I was blind but now I see the word amen that's proof enough all their false doctrines are false it's just ridiculous they asked brother brandom in questions and answers part three uh 64 brother brandom some say Mercy's over and no one can be saved now again let me say this I understand why people could think that because brother Ram said when the lamb came forth to break the seals there's no more intercession brother ramam said that numerous times in this sermon right I've talked to cam about it Simon I've talked to all kinds of preachers about it brother mam thought that's what it meant brother man thought at one time the lamb would come he break the seals and then the Rapture would happen that's what that's kind of what he thought thought there right but they ask him a year later a year and five months later so 17 months later they ask him is Mercy over some say Mercy's over no one can be saved we watch the prayer lines and it seems some are still finding Mercy how many found Mercy out here today thank you God it's still rewriting my life Hallelujah God's Mercy is still rewriting my life amen is Mercy over don't never think that don't never think that now what it be interesting to you if you remember I preached U Souls that are in prison now and brother R based upon his vision he saw JC Penney remember he saw these women coming up with the blue and the green on their faces and in the vision it's like he it's like heaven was showing him this is their sole condition they're just grunting like uh kind of like zombies or something I don't that's not the word he uses but it just looks like dead Souls you know just brother sees them coming up and brother says it's like hell was opened up and all these uh demons are coming out and brother R was so impacted by that he's like honey are you done shopping I need to leave here and he goes back to Jeffersonville and he didn't even tell me about it he said ma is waiting on this tape so he was so moved by that vision of hell that you know he preaches Souls that are in prison now and I never finished that that that sermon I need to finish that maybe this summer by God's grace but brother B ends a sermon by saying he said maybe Mercy's over he said because i' by the vision I'm starting to see these demonic forces coming up maybe Mercy's over let's pray for those uh that they're not saved he said I've got family I've got children that are not in the Holy Ghost and they spend the last 15 or 20 minutes praying and brother man ends that sermon by saying no Smiles as we leave this place now what if I did he said this is a solemn hour now that was the morning service they come back and now they're happy in the evening because they realize that Mercy's not over my brother ad said Shake one other's hand not even a smile he says because just because the impact of that Vision he said maybe Mercy's over yeah he said I'm he said this whole sermon was presuming he said I normally don't do that and so see church I can understand why some people might think Mercy's over but you got to keep reading you got to to keep listening Hallelujah you got to take all those thoughts back to the Bible praise God don't never think that just keep right on doing everything you can until you're taken away amen we notice in the prayer lines you find Mercy sure mercies the doors are open I think where you got this this thought might lay between I don't have time to to give to each one of these scriptures in the right place but each one of their things they in the prayer line you find Mercy certainly if I know Jesus was coming this afternoon I'd be doing just the thing I'm doing right now just continuing right on if we knew Jesus was coming tonight your job would be to be right here stay in line with the fivefold ministry right because that's Christ's body that's Christ's gifts he sent gifts unto men Hallelujah he said sure the mercies of doors are open he said Mercy is always open see now where I think you get it is about the finishing of the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals being loosed the Seven Seals it manifested what takes place or what has took place the seven Church age were at the end of the seven Church age when I say the end that doesn't mean it's the very hour this very minute you remember the Bible said back in the times of the Lord Jesus Paul said for the time is at hand how many know that Paul said we're living in the last days and that was to 2,000 years ago imagine getting that letter right you got Paul's letter it's the last days what does that tell us God wants us on high alert God wants us to be ready for his coming Hallelujah in other words God doesn't want us to be slothful God doesn't want us to be just you know relaxing God wants us to keep our first love Hallelujah imagine getting a letter from Paul and you live your whole life it's the end time end time and you don't see the end time that ought not to discourage you praise God but it's to let you know these are the end times of the church ages and even the last days I know you know this but just bear with me the last days right what is a day a thousand years right and so if Paul wrote the last days we've had two days see if you look at the spiritual as aspect of it these are the last days the last 2,000 years before the Millennium that one holy sacred day the seventh day hallelujah amen and then the future home is the Eighth Day Hallelujah the Eternal day L said do you realize how long that was in God's time that was yesterday brother say yesterday was Paul's day according see we talking about the thousands of years my time it's been 2,000 years see the time's at hand what God calls at hand is not what we call at hand see so just Just Keep On Believing just keep on praying brother baham says God still got Mercy open just keep flowing into it as fast as you can God will do the stopping when it's time to stop that's the end of the answer the church said Glory now John looked all around and he looked over all the Earth he looked beneath the Earth and there was nobody there creation and everybody was lost Lo of course John wept everything was lost his crying didn't last but just a minute because there stood one of the elders said don't weep John oh my his crying didn't last but just a minute Hallelujah John thought oh my where is this man I want a man to do it he he wasn't found so John broke out brother said everything was lost and he wept bitterly and he was sad because everything the whole creation everything was gone if they couldn't find somebody glory to God if they couldn't find somebody that can meet that requirements there every human being the whole world of creation was gone everything had fallen the rights of redemption the rights of eternal life the light all these things had been forfeited and there was nobody who could pay the price but the voice said don't weep John he says for the L of the tribe of Judah the root and offspring of David has prevailed brother said Prevail means to wrestle with and and overcome hallelujah oh my so Jesus didn't get this Victory easy he had to wrestle with it and overcome for you and I Hallelujah I'm fighting a battle that's already won hallelujah amen we have to sing that after service amen remind me buddy remind me Hallelujah he said Prevail means a wrestle with an overcome oh my the guarden of Gethsemane so now we get now we get a picture where did you overcome in prayer in private prayer when his three closest friends fell asleep and wouldn't pray with him that's the power of individual prayer Hallelujah the Bible said the spirit's willing but the flesh is weak Hallelujah and then he says you couldn't even pray one hour he said but go and sleep now because this is you need some rest for what's going to happen right but here we see where did he overcome he over came by saying not my will but thy will be done think of it the greatest Victory ever came through prayer Joshua had some great victories he spoke to the sun right they marched around Jericho all these great victories Moses had some great victories he held up the staff and all these trillions of gallons all held back by the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen but none of those victories could compare to Jesus simply in prayer Hallelujah he just prayed say said I'm not going to do my will I'm going to do thy will Hallelujah and as he rose he was already Victorious because he conquered his will God help us to conquer our will Hallelujah and then we'll get some victory in our lives amen if we can just conquer our will I don't want to suffer or I don't want have to give this up I don't want to have to Die daily all these all these battles we go through church we got to go go through the battles we got to surrender if we want to overcome Hallelujah cuz that's the way to overcome Hallelujah surrendering thy will I'm sorry surrendering my will so God's will thy will can be done when the blood dropped down on his face and he was overcoming woo The Lion and the root of David has prevailed and overcome where did Moses ever pray like that where did Jo ever prayed like that prayed until the blood came out of his head no one ever prayed like that Hallelujah no one ever lived like Jesus no one did ever ever Miracles like Jesus and no one ever prayed like Jesus hallelujah praise God Amen nobody could do it Hallelujah except the Virgin born son of God he was overcoming see the lion the root of David has prevailed and overcome and brother B Compares a small example it's like Jacob he was a supplanter a deceiver but when he got in contact with the angel he held on and the angel tried to pull away he said I'm just not going to let you go he held on until he got what he wanted his name would change from supplanter deceiver to a prince with God he prevailed amen and this line of the tribe of Judah prevailed he said don't weep John for the lon of tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed he's already overcome he's done it it's over John oh the battle's over amen the search in Heaven and Earth is over we found the worthy one we found the one that prevailed Hallelujah we found the one that can give us redemption's claims Hallelujah redemption's right amen we found the one who can give back to the people of God what Adam and Eve lost Hallelujah brother man said he produced a bleach that sends sin back to the greasy hands that defiled the human beings he sent it back to Satan Hallelujah right all the punishment will go back on Satan Hallelujah now brother said where did this lamb come from okay she pull up Hebrews 61 19 and 20 brother said where did he come from from the father's Throne the Bible said Jesus sat down at the right hand of the Majesty of God ever living to make intercession the Bible says which hope we have as an anchor for the soul both sure and steadfast F which entereth into that within the veil now look church you've got hope inside you but I preached this before but just remember your hope doesn't stop here your hope actually connects up to heaven your Hope Is Anchored In Heaven thank God your hope isn't anchored on the economy of America thank God for that your hope isn't anchored on the White House Glory Hallelujah your hope isn't anchored on your mom or your dad or your brother or your sister or something like that or your car your vehicle or your job you don't anchor your you don't anchor your soul on your job well as long as this building standing then I I've got hope the Bible said you've got hope that reaches up to heaven in other words you are connected you are tied into heaven Hallelujah your soul is tied into heaven Hallelujah it enters into the veil I'm sorry be within the veil so there is the Throne of God and brother man said it must be behind the throne he said there's an intercessory box I'm waiting for somebody draw a picture of this brother where you got the throne you got the rainbow around it you got the four beasts the seven spirits of God you got the 24 Elders what a picture I don't think paper has enough room for that but then behind that Throne is an intercessor intercessory Booth the Bible says so there's a veil there's a veil in heaven verse 20 wither the Forerunner is entered for us even Jesus made a high priest after the order of mzc church you've got a high priest in heaven and the Bible said he's enter there for us he's there for me Hallelujah I've got somebody in heaven that cares for me Hallelujah I've got somebody who can stand in for me when I need help when I'm sick when I'm tired when I feel threatened when I feel afraid I've got somebody that's entered in to the intercessor place the holiest of holies I've got somebody that's not Aaron it's not Moses it's not elaser it's Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my the most Sublime thing in scripture amen oh my Hebrews 9:3 and after the second Veil The Tabernacle is called the holiest of all the Holy Ghost verse 8 yeah Hebrews 98 the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while the first Tabernacle was yet standing verse 19 Hebrews 10 I'm sorry Hebrews 10:19 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus Christ now look at this not only does Jesus go in there you and I get to go in there through prayer Hallelujah is that is that what the Bible says pull up verse 20 having boldness to enter in by a New and Living Way which ha Heath consecrated for us through the veil that say is that us to say his flesh go to verse 21 and having a high priest over the house of God verse 22 there it is let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith or trust or Assurance or Revelation having a heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our B and our bodies wash with pure water so see before we can go for prayer we got to confess our sins because we have to have a pure conscience in other words we got to remember Jesus forgives me when I confess it Hallelujah and that allows me by prayer to enter into the holiest of holies in heaven I tell you I say like this Jesus loves us greatly with his great love wherewith he loved us Ephesians chapter 2 says brother Bram said when John was there in heaven he he hadn't noticed this lamb before it hadn't been mentioned before nowhere had it been mentioned John didn't see it all over the heavens as he was looking but here it come forth where did it come from it come from the father's Throne where it been he'd been seated since he'd been slain and raised again he raised up and sat on the right hand of God ever living to make intercession brother Braham said intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people brother said now that's the one I'm depending on brother Raam are you depending on your Visions are you depending on your status as a prophet no I'm depending on Heaven's lamb I'm depending on the kinsman redeemer so is Moses so is job so is Elijah so is Daniel so is Mary so is every person so are we Hallelujah that's who I'm depending on Hallelujah Jesus Christ Hallelujah depending on the bloody lamb brother R says I'm depending on him that's the one I'm depending on he was covered with bleach the bleach of the Forgiveness of sins Hallelujah brother R said now look he says oh God he said J John hadn't seen because he'd been way back in the eternities making intercession so did you catch that that holiest of all that chamber there's no time there brother R said it's eternities Church there's no time there that means God can do whatever he wants and it's not tracked by time he's not limited by time so that's how he can pray for Lena he can pray for brother William he can pray for Malcolm because there's no time passing there he gets to go back and forth from time to talk about a time traveler amen hallelujah he goes in in time out of time in time he's got plenty of time to pray for your needs Church don't think God ever gets tired of your prayers he's not even on a time schedule hallelujah amen there's no there's no time that limits him he wants to hear from you Hallelujah he wants your faith to enter into that Holy Place hallelujah oh thank you Jesus my Hallelujah he said all those in the Old Testament they believed in it to Jesus it pointed to him as the Savior the blood of Jesus had not been shed yet so he was there to clear them he was there to clear you and I he said and oh God I hope he's there tonight making intercession for me so brother R said I'm depending on him and I hope he's there tonight making intercession for every sinner the lamb has been slain how can Jehovah see anything but the bloody lamb standing there so brother man said the lamb came forth John's crying but then the voice says the Lamb's prevailed and John didn't see him because he come forth out of the intercession Booth to the throne and then he comes and takes the book Hallelujah isn't it beautiful he says now look brother man said it's the lamb advancing out of Eternity so when the people when the people had no hope when there was no way for when John's weeping and crying think about this church think about When You Weep and cry I don't know why I'm so stirred up today Hallelujah I just feel like slapping things amen hallelujah glory amen when John's crying in his hour of greatest crying when the hour of no hope he cries and the lamb comes forth to stop his tears glory amen when there's no hope Jesus shows up hallelujah oh look there's no hope and nobody can help themselves amen Moses can't help you Enoch can't help you nobody can help you when there's no hope Jesus comes forth brother said he comes forth out of Eternity he comes forth to help all of creation he comes forth to redeem everyone that was lost and brother M says this he said oh would it be a glor glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept him and he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to any of you Hallelujah is that beautiful praise God when John needed him he came forth he Advanced forth out of Eternity that's what he did to the three Hebrew children he Advanced forth out of Eternity Hallelujah when they need needed him the most and they said I don't even know if he'll come but I won't disobey his word ah Jesus said that's a kind of one I'm GNA rescue hallelujah oh my and brother man said we could just lay aside all our evil conscience the Bible says we just lay aside our mistakes we can lay aside all of our evil thoughts and plans and if we can lay aside our past if we just lay this aside brother said don't you know Jesus will come forth out of eternity and make himself known to you oh my he'll do it today Church Hallelujah he'll make himself known to us hallelujah the lamb advancing from glory for intercessions for his people oh my brother kind of makes a little uh crack not like a joke but maybe like a a wise crack on on the Catholics he said John never saw 1,000 saints come forth to mediate because Catholics pray to patron saints and stuff like that to make intercession brother man cracks a little joke he says John never saw a thousand come forth he said he saw a lamb Hallelujah a lamb he's the only man that was worthy Hallelujah now I'm just going to hit a few highlights brother said notice the lamb had seven horns brother Ram said look those horns represent the seven Church ages he said that's the Lamb's protection so see church that proves we have to defend the gospel I've had people tell me online you don't got to defend the message the message defends itself well that's in one way but Paul said I stand in defense of the gospel and then of course if they if they follow brother R they go against that quote the Lamb's protection is the seven Church ages the Believers in all seven Church ages amen do you believe that you're a horn of God the power of God is moving in your life I didn't hear too many amens on that the power of God is in your life Hallelujah you are the Lamb's protection you keep the word going you're the one driving back the enemy with your horns right you're the one driving the enemy out of your life amen see it's Christ in you is what I'm saying Christ Christ is using you the church the body Believers as the power to defend the truth of God's word hallelujah and then he goes through seven eyes he and he goes to Zechariah 3 and Zechariah 4 to show those seven eyes of the seven spirits of God brother Ram said notice seven eyes seers he says those were seven prophets now don't let there some of you but the next night brother R said the only Prophet was Paul and brother brandom amongst the seven Church age Messengers don't let that stumble you it doesn't stumble me right doesn't St with me because it doesn't really matter the Bible calls them eyes so they got to see something they see the Revelation for their hour hallelujah it's another proof not every word is thus say I mean I got over 90 Now by God's grace but just don't let it some you Hallelujah but see church the church are the seven horns the seven Church ages he says now brother bam says now Jesus has the book and now he's given the book down to earth and they have a right to everything that was lost in the fall because Jesus Paid the price I've died for them and brother man said who is waiting there for me tonight it's the kinsman redeemer Hallelujah this is why we have the rights of the gifts of the holy spirit we have the rights of the supernatural move of the Holy Spirit glory amen because he's purchased it back and now he's brought he's opened the book we have the understanding of redemption and he's brought the book down to earth so we'll eat it Hallelujah that's what we got to do more of eat the book Hallelujah we got to really as Eagles you really got to watch your diet right or as Lambs right whatever one you want it we're both we're called both in the Bible we have to make sure we're feeding on the word of God hallelujah and then we'll be able to eat the book Hallelujah and then prophesy again hallelujah amen brother man said brother this is the most Sublime thing in the Bible he says he said I feel like a young man again Hallelujah when I see what God has done for me he said I feel like I could speak in tongues he said because I don't have enough languages to praise him with Hallelujah preaching this sermon amen the breach now one point I just want to lay this into here brother R says when he leads the Throne of intercession he's bringing the world to judgment and then he says when the blood's off The Mercy Seat it becomes a judgment seat and then he goes to Daniel 7 where the Judgment was set the books were open he goes to the white Throne judgment and then he reads this uh poem it's called The Cowboy meditation how many remember that I'm GNA read not many people okay well then you got listen to this message if you don't remember it here's the here's the poem last night as I lay on the Prairie I gazed to the stars in the sky and I wondered if ever a cowboy could drift to that sweet by and by talking about Cowboy could I ever go to heaven there's a road to that bright happy region but it's dim there a trail so they say but the broad one that leads to bition is posted and blazed all the way they speak of another great owner brother said he's speaking in terms of cattle life if you ever was in a Roundup of cattle you can see it plain they speak of another great owner and he'll never be Overstock so they say he'll always make room for a sinner that'll drift on that straight narrow Ray in other words God's got to fill up the table all the seats at the banquet got to be filled up and God's Got A Chair for you don't think there's not room for you oh there's room for you Hallelujah he's going to make room for you Hallelujah you're a part of him they say he will never forsake you and he knows every action and look for safety we better get branded talking about the Seal of the Holy Ghost have our name on his great tally book for they say there will be a great Roundup when Cowboys men like dogies will stand to be might I'm sorry to be marked by the writers of judgment he says them prophets and seers that's posted and knows every brand Hallelujah and that last verse is I guess I will be a stray yearling just a man that's condemned to die that'll be cut in the bunch with the rusties when the boss of the Riders comes by so this poem is a man who's lost his hope oh he needs a prayer meeting is what he needs amen because if he gets a prayer meeting he can go reach up into the heavens Hallelujah and his hope can be anchored in heaven hallelujah amen so this sermon is famous for that brother man reads that cowboy meditation he says see who it is who's the boss of the riters that's the lamb to the seven Messengers who's posted and knows every brand Hallelujah The Messengers of God know the brand of the Holy Ghost they know the Seal of the Holy Ghost when they see it right Glory he's brother man said he's King now Mercy still on the throne don't you reject his offer the riters know just who you are he said I can I can and he said the boss say I can do with them what I want I still have them he's back there making intercessions for them now but someday he said I'll put them in the grave I'm sorry no he's talking about Satan Satan says oh but someday I'll put them in the grave but Jesus told the church I'll bring you out so you see there's nothing to fear Satan will tell you oh you're going to die you're going to go to the Grave that that's that's fine he can say whatever he wants Jesus said I'll bring you out of the Grave I'll resurrect you Hallelujah he says but first I've got to be an intercessor all right now brother Bram said when when time's no more he says tonight this lays in the future Jesus is still me mediator tonight Hallelujah and so brother is telling us we've got a mediator tonight now I want to go back to the verse I read here verse n Revelation 59 and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation now look when the lamb advances forward and gives you a revelation and gave them a revelation that they were redeemed look what it caused a brand new PSAL that's why the Bible says Sing a new song Amen but in order to sing a new song you got to have a fresh Revelation Hallelujah you got to have a revelation of God's word of God's Will and It produced a new song Hallelujah and notice what they sang about verse 10 and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and brother man said why were they shouting why were they rejoicing why were they singing a new song he said they wanted to come back to the Earth they're all waiting there in heaven brother man said all the celebrity why are they so happy why are they singing Because God's redeemed us he said they want to come back and here they are they're going to be Kings and Priests most of these men were rejected during their lives Elijah was hunted down right or threatened hunting down Moses was against uh uh the greatest army of his day Egypt Pharaoh a lot of Daniel stood we just saw it at the theater Daniel was against the whole empire of Babylon most of these men were rejected and suffered and and battled through temptation all these things in other words their life on Earth wasn't so pretty now see Church we're so blessed in this loran church age we got to be careful the riches and goodness doesn't blind us we got to stay seeking God we got to say God stir me up amen like the Bible said as an eagle stir her nest God stir us up Hallelujah so we don't get comfortable in this life Hallelujah see their lives on Earth were not so great remember the Bible said they wandered about in tents sheep skins and goat skins David in caves right 13 years are running from Saul life wasn't so great all the time and but when they see Jesus come forth and take this book now they're ready now they want to come back and now they want to see the kingdom of God lived and expressed upon the Earth Hallelujah in other words they're saying I can't wait to go back down to earth I can't wait to have another shot at this life amen they're G to get another chance Hallelujah another time to live on this Earth Hallelujah he said we're going back to be Kings and Priests glory to God he he said I feel good enough to speak in tongues he says because it seems like I don't have enough language I could praise him with I need one that I don't even know oh my just now think about that they're in heaven and they're longing for Earth We're on Earth longing for heaven Hallelujah GL so what does it show we won't be content until we have perfect bodies and the Bible said they without us cannot be perfected Hallelujah will never feel perfect until the Old Testament Saints the New Testament Saints are ruling on this Earth in the righteousness of Christ Hallelujah all because we've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb oh my hallelujah praise God I feel like I'm finally ready to preach Hallelujah Glory brother B said now let's read on down here verse 11 I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the Elders the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands that's a lot of angels sang with a loud voice they're all saying Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power riches wisdom strength honor and glory and blessing all because of the Cross brother William all this was possible because of the cross of Jesus Christ how many know why it's called Good Friday now we wouldn't have the Dominion back we wouldn't have the rights we wouldn't have a promise to come back to earth unless the lamb prevailed because he could take the book break the seals show the whole mystery of God reveal to us and then he show our place in this plan hallelujah our promise our hope for a future our promise of eternal life Hallelujah only possible through the bloody lamb Hallelujah and every creature which is in heaven on the earth and under the Earth and such as in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four Beast said amen and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down and worship him that liveth forever and ever church if we ever get in the real Spirit of worship that's what's going to happen we're going to pray God we're going to talk about Jesus's merits the worthiness of Jesus not of our own oh some of us will fall down some of us will shout John shouted so loud everybody could hear him Hallelujah I believe God was giving a witness that that Jesus had overcome and taken the book so God let John's shout heard by everybody in the sea the Earth and Heaven Hallelujah God let them hear that Jesus Christ had prevailed hallelujah amen every every Dimension uh every realm Heaven and Earth under the water had to hear John rejoiced that Jesus overcame for us hallelujah we've got hope for the future amen oh my brother said talk about a happy time when those seals broke John must have looked in and seen a past the curtain of time and said there's John did you catch that John's having a vision of the four 20 elders and John sees I'm one of those 12 I'm I see I made it I see I'm redeemed I see I have a I have a place by the Throne of Jesus I've got a future I've got hope John was so happy that all Heaven and Earth heard him praise God oh my and church I said I just we just got to believe we got to know that our name is written in heaven Hallelujah Jesus said don't Rejoice that Spirits are subject into you you can cast out Devils or do these things Rejoice that your names are written in heaven Hallelujah because John was happy when Jesus overcame and he see Jesus overcame and I will be there when the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there oh my I'm closing with this hopefully the loudest part of this sermon if you go and listen to it now there's like a half hour altar call at the end but the loudest part of the sermon is right here brother said talk about a jubilee the angels are shouting the 24 Elders are singing a new song John's screaming everybody's hearing him when the seals when Jesus came to open the seals they weren't even broken yet he just came to get the book Hallelujah talk about a jubilee when the lamb walked forth the books even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are say is brother Bram says say is your name there brother Braham I don't know I hope it is look what he says I hope my name he said Visions upon visions and look how humble brother Ram is I hope my name is there church I hope my name's there too brother ra said I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that Redemption came the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book opened the book tore off the seals and here's the loudest part of the sermon and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people and you can't even hear Brother Ram say these words because the people are so happy Hallelujah now I've said this for years you probably don't remember it but I told you this I said I believe Revelation five was fulfilled around March of 1963 most people don't believe that that's what I believe because Jesus had to come forth take the book open it and bring it down to earth so brother Ram could reveal it you'd be surprised a lot of people don't believe that but that's what I believe right can believe whatever you want right but how many believe the book is open if the book is open how many believe Revelation 10:7 is history as brother R said and what is the attraction on the mount 196 if that's history well then the book already had to open Hallelujah and we have the open book Hallelujah we see the whole Plan of Redemption and we're we're privileged to experience the Heavenly rights of the open book we're experiencing eternal life we're experiencing the Dominion of the Holy Spirit I love what David said I'm going to bring that up again David said I know God favors me because he doesn't let my enemies triumph over me oh Hallelujah I know God's favored me I know I've got the rights of the book because my enemies don't triumph over me hallelujah it's going to tie into this evening when I talk about people that fall in the message the reason they fall is because they don't have God's favor because they rejected God's favor right in other words rejecting the word means you're you reject God's favor if you don't stay humble behind the word of God you lose God's favor and he won't stand for you Hallelujah but if you stand for him he'll stand for you Hallelujah he says there you are he broke it he brought it down to his seventh angel there you are what happened the screams the shouts the Hallelujah the anointing the power and the glory and he said oh John had been standing there crying why he said everything in Heaven and Earth and everything in the sea heard me H amen blessing honor that lives forever talk about it happen time when those seals broke oh my why he says when the Revelation come that the lamb the Redeemer our Kinsman had come back from the Throne of mediatorial and he' worked and I'm sorry he walked out there to take his possession how many glad Jesus Christ has walked out taken the book and sent it down to the Earth let's stand to our feet musicians can come I know Malachi just walked out but amen you can start us on that they asked brother Bram this I just left this quote on here again questions answers part 4 64 he said the church age has the church age ended in blacked out oh this this just struck me the bride is called and we have already entered the tribulation period no no no no no the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease do you notice the blackened out part people say brother BR had a vision and after 1977 it was blacked out if there ever would have been a time to mention that that this would have been the time this don't really pertain to what I've been preaching but um just an interesting point there there's always going to be Mercy until the bride is snatched away and church how's it going to be in the moment the twinkling of an eye you w have time to get ready you got to be ready how do we get ready by the mercy of God hallelujah let's bow our hearts here to the Lord father
