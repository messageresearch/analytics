[21:39] 6 let me get the verse I want to read
[21:42] here God's
[21:45] gra Daniel chapter 6 I'd like to
[21:49] read I want to start at verse
[21:52] 10 read 10 and
[21:57] 11 Danel 6 10 and
[22:00] 11 now when Daniel knew that the writing
[22:03] was signed he went into his house and
[22:05] his windows being open in his chamber
[22:07] toward
[22:08] Jerusalem he kneel down upon his knees
[22:11] three times a day prayed gave thanks
[22:15] before his God as he did a four
[22:18] time then these men assembled and found
[22:21] Daniel praying and making supplication
[22:23] before his God that's i' like to read
[22:25] there let's that word of prayer have KN
[22:26] on your heart just make a know unto God
[22:28] as we

[23:27] God Sor if there's ever a distraction
[23:29] let me know this was up a little bit
[23:31] higher I can see how you know everybody
[23:33] that drives past I can see how that
[23:35] might be a distraction let me know if
[23:36] there's anything we can do to help out
[23:38] like God I know what that's I know it's
[23:40] like it could be distracting you know
[23:42] things back here for me can be
[23:45] distracting I do want to thank brother
[23:46] bang he got the video up that work okay
[23:49] on Wednesday the live stream yeah except
[23:51] for when you were
[23:53] playing sorry that's my fault let's
[23:55] thank brother bang for that thank you
[23:58] [Applause]
[24:00] you thank you brother I really
[24:01] appreciate that you're such a good
[24:03] faithful Soldier brother thank you sir I
[24:06] want to show a few quotes by God's
[24:09] grace yeah personal computer in so let's
[24:12] look at this here tonight I just want to
[24:14] look at the power of a prayer life this
[24:17] part six chapter six uh the next few
[24:19] chapters are all prophetic if you look
[24:22] at chapter seven a lot of prophetic
[24:24] things chapter eight a lot of Visions uh
[24:27] chapter nine is the Great uh chapter of
[24:29] Daniel 70 weeks so we'll revisit that
[24:32] and uh I'll never forget when brother
[24:33] Kevin after I preached that over at the
[24:35] other Church brother Kevin walked up and
[24:36] he he said we've heard preaching for
[24:39] these decades and that was the best
[24:40] teaching I ever heard on that so I said
[24:42] thank you sir I appreciate that uh but
[24:46] we want it to be clear we want all the
[24:48] teachings to be clear by God's grace
[24:50] because we want we think brother BR the
[24:52] holy spirit makes it simple so we want
[24:54] it to be simple by God's grace and so I
[24:56] want to review that a little later and
[24:58] then chapter 10 11 and 12 there's only a
[25:00] few more chapters after that a lot of
[25:02] them are prophetic I think the most
[25:06] um maybe the most prophetic ones would
[25:09] be the ones about the King of the North
[25:11] you know uh with Russia brother Russia
[25:13] was the King of the North and the King
[25:15] of the South not sure who that is yet I
[25:17] think it's Egypt I have to go back and
[25:19] check the quotes and make sure my memory
[25:20] is right but there's a lot of there's a
[25:23] lot of uh prophecy in those books so
[25:26] I'll be real careful about that if I
[25:27] don't know if I don't have a quote from
[25:29] Brother brand I won't interpret it you
[25:31] know I just well maybe just have to skip
[25:33] it but I just want to let you know
[25:35] there's a lot in there chapter 11
[25:37] remember there's a lot about the
[25:38] Antichrist in chapter
[25:39] 11 about taking the Covenant by flatter
[25:42] flatteries you he comes in peely all
[25:44] these things we heard brother Ram say
[25:46] Well they're laying right there in
[25:47] chapter 11 as well so a lot of them get
[25:49] prophetic and we'll just try to gather
[25:51] all those quotes you know and bring them
[25:53] together and to see the the best picture
[25:56] we can and I think hopefully helped on
[25:59] Wednesday night to hear that again how
[26:00] brother brandom said I believe the bride
[26:03] will be forced to stop preaching right
[26:05] remember brother said that according to
[26:06] Revelation
[26:08] 13:16 um so again seeing the the rising
[26:11] of the of the denominations will have to
[26:13] rise in change the laws right in order
[26:16] to bring a squeeze upon the bride but
[26:17] brother said before that happens
[26:19] there'll be a Jesus Will Be The Showdown
[26:20] he'll be the Mount Zion Showdown and
[26:22] he'll come and Rapture his bride away so
[26:25] that's what we're taught by God's grace
[26:27] and so when people ask me that's I told
[26:28] Austin you that's why I told Benjamin
[26:30] you know I tell them that that's that's
[26:32] what we have as far as prophecy for for
[26:35] before the
[26:37] Rapture okay so Daniel chapter 6 again a
[26:40] very familiar chapter um let me set the
[26:43] timer I don't think I'll go over but if
[26:44] I do forgive me but I'm not going to try
[26:46] to go
[26:47] over now what awesome was here I would
[26:50] slow down a little bit but I think I'm
[26:51] just gonna U get to the main points by
[26:54] God's grace and maybe make it a little
[26:55] shorter so I wanted I wanted to kind of
[26:57] teach him through you know the word of
[26:58] God I know he's never read this before
[27:00] but since he's not here I'll just hit
[27:02] the highlights okay all right so chapter
[27:04] six um little background here scoffield
[27:07] says this is 537 BC so one year after
[27:11] know Bazar fell this is one year after
[27:14] it and remember brother Ram said when
[27:16] Daniel came before Bazar he was an old
[27:18] man with a big beard and white beard on
[27:20] and an old rugged Preacher Brother ra
[27:22] said he would preach a little bit there
[27:23] babyon he's an old man now uh this is
[27:26] under the rule of Darius which is true
[27:29] you know that I'm saying I got that from
[27:30] the scripture uh in scoffield that's
[27:33] five uh chapter
[27:35] 5:31 Darius the me so when the mees and
[27:39] Persians remember they took over Bel
[27:40] shazar they didn't have to fight
[27:41] remember that and people get so prideful
[27:44] and puffed up Satan hard has to fight
[27:46] them you know they're just already T
[27:47] overtaken by the demons you know the
[27:48] previous demons and all kinds of all
[27:51] kinds of evil
[27:52] influences but now Daniel is seeing the
[27:56] the chest and arms of silver now
[27:59] Daniel's a part of that he's seeing his
[28:01] vision now he's walking in the vision
[28:04] he's he's walking he's uh the modern
[28:06] events were made clear by prophecy can
[28:08] you say Amen to that he's walking said
[28:10] wow this is what I've seen the needs and
[28:12] perss are ruling this is what I saw this
[28:14] is the silver uh he's walking in the
[28:16] vision right he's walking and the vision
[28:18] of God has made plain before him so it's
[28:20] just a very striking thing to see now
[28:23] verses 1 through3 it explains how Daniel
[28:25] was over he was one of the presidents
[28:27] who was over groups of
[28:29] 120 okay and then the King was thinking
[28:31] to make him above everybody else in
[28:33] verse three he supposed to be over he
[28:35] was going to make him above the whole
[28:37] realm now verse four uh you start seeing
[28:40] a real good type of Daniel typing Christ
[28:44] because in verse four then the
[28:45] presidents and princes sought to find
[28:47] occasion against Daniel concerning the
[28:49] kingdom but they could find none
[28:51] occasion nor fault for as much as he was
[28:53] faithful neither was there any he or
[28:57] fault found in him
[28:59] so these Sinners hate the holy man right
[29:03] they don't like this guy so they want to
[29:05] find fault with him and that's all they
[29:07] did with Jesus they just try to find
[29:08] fault with Jesus that's the what they'll
[29:10] try to do to us they'll try to find
[29:12] fault with us we've got to live pure
[29:14] before the
[29:15] Lord now uh it's just like Christ and
[29:19] you'll see here in verses 8 and N the
[29:21] laws had to be change in order to find
[29:23] fault with
[29:24] Daniel that's how the you know right now
[29:26] in America don't you enjoy the freedom
[29:28] that we have butam said that they'll
[29:30] close our doors close our doors thinking
[29:33] they're doing God of service he
[29:35] said but they have to change the laws in
[29:38] order to persecute the true church
[29:40] that's talking about the false church so
[29:43] they change the laws right they change
[29:44] the laws this is a beautiful type of the
[29:48] the crucifixion but also of the end time
[29:50] as well it's a beautiful uh types of
[29:53] both of these now in verse 10 and 11
[29:55] what we read despite the law Daniel kept
[29:58] his fellowship with God that's what
[30:01] we've got a purpose in our hearts
[30:02] because that's what brother Bram said
[30:04] brother Bram said we have we must have
[30:05] unbroken fellowship with God no matter
[30:08] what Trials come no matter what laws
[30:11] change no matter how we
[30:14] suffer and uh no matter if we even feel
[30:16] like Heaven's closed to us we must still
[30:19] have unbroken Fellowship because listen
[30:21] we're going to have fellowship with
[30:22] somebody right if you don't have if you
[30:24] stop if we stop praying if we stop
[30:25] coming to church you're going to be
[30:27] fellowshiping with somebody it's going
[30:28] to be demons so we must keep the
[30:30] fellowship and God allows these Hard
[30:32] Times brother says of course to test us
[30:34] I listened to a sermon what was
[30:37] that I can't remember last week and
[30:39] brother so blessed me oh was the one
[30:42] about Easter yeah living yeah living
[30:44] dying buried and raised from 57 and
[30:47] brother man said the disciples were
[30:48] discouraged on that Saturday when after
[30:50] Jesus was crucified and brother said
[30:53] sometimes God will let us be discouraged
[30:55] but it's just to test us he said because
[30:57] every son and daughter must be tried
[30:59] amen so that's what I'm saying like if
[31:01] you feel like Heaven's closed if you
[31:03] feel like the prayers have been answered
[31:06] we keep our fellowship with God Almighty
[31:08] because we know God is just testing us
[31:10] and we've got to make our calling
[31:11] election sure amen that's exactly right
[31:13] let's look at this quote I pulled out
[31:15] just this one quote there was a couple I
[31:16] wanted to pull out but I think I'll just
[31:18] I just pulled this one up don't never
[31:20] never try to get to God under anything
[31:22] other than the fellowship the fellowship
[31:24] with God under the blood that's why I
[31:26] love that song Through the blood I
[31:28] really appreciate that that's the only
[31:30] way God knows that's the only way God
[31:32] will
[31:33] recognize you must first be Washed by
[31:35] the Water of the word then cleanse
[31:37] through the blood and enter the sh of
[31:39] Glory go into there into Fellowship then
[31:41] you know where you're standing at amen
[31:43] how many know where they're standing at
[31:44] tonight you've been you've been through
[31:46] justification sanctification baptism of
[31:49] the Holy Ghost you know where you stand
[31:51] with fellowship with God Daniel another
[31:54] one who had purpose in his heart he
[31:56] wouldn't defile himself with the king's
[31:58] meat when he had taken down into Babylon
[32:02] he maintained his Fellowship in the
[32:04] presence of lions that was ready to kill
[32:08] him oh my remember Satan's like a
[32:11] roaring
[32:12] lion right he maintained his Fellowship
[32:16] in the presence of lions that was ready
[32:18] to kill and yet Daniel held his
[32:22] fellowship and God sent angel and stood
[32:24] by him that night and blinded his eyes
[32:26] and shut the mouth of the lion because
[32:29] Daniel had fellowship with the
[32:31] supernatural Glory Daniel had fellowship
[32:34] with the god of Heaven because he was
[32:36] under the blood that's how he maintained
[32:39] his stand amen the Bible says we must do
[32:42] all we can do to stand right put on the
[32:44] full armor of God that you be able to
[32:46] withstand against the Ws of the devil
[32:49] right and having done all he said stand
[32:52] Hallelujah so what we see the power of
[32:54] prayer the power of prayer helps us to
[32:56] stand when everything else falls apart
[32:59] we must keep our prayer life strong how
[33:01] many how many believe that by God's
[33:02] grace we must keep the prayer life
[33:04] strong as we'll get to some quotes at
[33:06] the end here but I just want to read
[33:07] through
[33:08] this the Hebrew children we preached on
[33:10] this a few weeks ago right in the middle
[33:12] of the fire furnace no matter what you
[33:13] do to them you can't Scorch that
[33:16] Fellowship away from them Hallelujah you
[33:19] can throw them under enough trials I'm
[33:22] sry you can't throw them under enough
[33:23] trials to make them deny it praise God
[33:26] see that Fellowship St with you right
[33:28] it's like that white stone we talked
[33:29] about it's that revelation of who you
[33:31] are I'm a Child of God Daniel knew he
[33:33] was a child of God and remember just one
[33:35] chapter later the Bible said the angel
[33:38] Gabriel came to him and said you're
[33:39] greatly beloved in heaven see look what
[33:42] see look at his Decades of I think of
[33:43] you know Loris and Karen look at the
[33:45] decades and years of Daniel's life and
[33:47] finally at the end of his life the Holy
[33:49] Spirit through the angel comes and says
[33:51] you're greatly beloved Heaven loves you
[33:53] amen hallelujah you might not have heard
[33:56] that before but Heaven came down and
[33:58] tell him you're greatly beloved Daniel
[34:00] because you love the things of God
[34:03] Amen said a man that's ever been under
[34:06] the blood of Jesus Christ and become
[34:08] filled with the Holy Ghost all the
[34:09] devils in Hell couldn't rooted out of
[34:11] him he knows where he stands man I know
[34:15] you think I'm crazy swinging my hands
[34:16] but if you felt like I did you'd jump up
[34:18] in your seat and do the same thing amen
[34:21] so can you
[34:22] imagine oh my if you felt like I see how
[34:24] this raises people's Faith here keep
[34:26] your fellowship with God go keep your
[34:28] prayer life with God hallelujah it's the
[34:30] power of the prayer life
[34:32] amen glory I just want to bring this
[34:34] scripture to your mind I mentioned it
[34:36] when I was praying because it was just
[34:37] been so dear to me God loves our
[34:41] prayers as long as our hearts are right
[34:44] the sacrifice of the wicked is
[34:45] abomination to the Lord but the prayer
[34:47] of the upright is his Delight amen one
[34:51] thing there's there's one thing we know
[34:53] God what God loves is somebody who prays
[34:55] with a pure heart amen not for my I mean
[34:58] yes we need we have needs we can ask for
[35:01] needs but like brother B said if we can
[35:03] be
[35:04] uh if we can just pray and be in the
[35:07] middle of the road and not tell God what
[35:09] to do but and be okay if God doesn't
[35:11] answer our prayer we can just be right
[35:13] in the middle of the road God Delights
[35:15] in that God Delights in somebody that
[35:17] will be humble and submissive and say
[35:19] let your will be done but not my will be
[35:21] done amen the prayer of the upright is
[35:25] his Delight so he loves to hear your
[35:27] pray in the morning doesn't he he loves
[35:29] to hear you pray at noon and he loves to
[35:30] hear you pray at night time amen because
[35:32] that's Daniel's
[35:33] testimony as we read in our scripture he
[35:36] kneeled upon his knees three times a
[35:39] day now I didn't put this in my notes
[35:41] because it just kind of came to
[35:43] me but he did the same thing Jonah did
[35:47] Jonah turned brother said he turned
[35:49] somehow in the belly of the way he must
[35:51] have had like a spiritual Compass he
[35:53] turned to pray to Jerusalem and God
[35:55] uttered his prayer because solom had
[35:58] written that Lord May the whoever prays
[36:00] this Temple May and they they if they
[36:02] pray repenting may you hear from heaven
[36:05] and hear them and answer their prayer so
[36:08] just as Jonah prayed toward Jerusalem he
[36:10] Daniel but Daniel with a pure heart
[36:12] right Daniel wasn't a runaway Prophet
[36:14] right so God hears a runaway prophet and
[36:17] God hears a faithful Prophet God hears
[36:19] anybody who cries with a sincere heart
[36:22] amen I just thought I'd put that in
[36:24] there there it's his Delight he
[36:26] delighted that that Jonah would turn and
[36:28] look to he to heaven or turn and look to
[36:30] the Heavenly Temple there on Earth and
[36:32] he delighted that Daniel would turn and
[36:33] face the temple God just loves people
[36:36] that look up to him amen amen PR praise
[36:39] God I'm G just share a quick testimony
[36:41] can I I hope sister Kristen Walker is
[36:42] okay with this she shared a testimony
[36:44] with me this week uh or yesterday or I'm

[37:47] person came back to their normal mind
[37:49] and it happened again she said the name
[37:50] of Jesus Christ again and the person
[37:53] came back to themselves and ended up
[37:55] leaving the house
[37:57] praise God doesn't God Delight doesn't
[37:59] God back up his word think about that
[38:01] the demon said I'm going to take over
[38:03] this home I'm going to torment and do

[38:43] know some some of us might get our tawan
[38:45] do moves ready you know or something
[38:47] like that some people might do that but
[38:49] alls we need is the name of
[38:51] Jesus that is enough Hallelujah more
[38:55] than enough amen so this all share that
[38:57] by God's
[38:59] grace stay in that channel stay with
[39:02] that word keep his name always on your
[39:04] lips to praise His name that's just this
[39:06] week the power of Jesus Christ rebuking
[39:09] demons amen don't you appreciate that
[39:11] testimony if you see her tell her tell
[39:12] her thanks for that hope it was okay
[39:14] that I shared that I try to keep out all
[39:15] the details you know by God's grace I
[39:17] just thought my that's just
[39:19] wonderful praise the Lord now my next
[39:24] one is verse 17 and a stone was brought
[39:27] and of course we know the story the the
[39:29] the the the the workers there you know
[39:31] change the laws Daniel gets caught
[39:34] praying uh and
[39:36] then uh the Bible said this that a stone
[39:38] was brought he he's cast into the uh the
[39:42] den and uh laid upon the mouth of the
[39:45] den and the King sealed it with his own
[39:47] signate and with the signate of the
[39:48] Lords and the per that the purpose might
[39:50] not be Chang concerning Daniel now this
[39:53] is a beautiful type of Christ isn't it
[39:55] remember when Christ died they put his
[39:57] body in there and the Bible said the uh
[40:00] the Bible said that pilate sealed it it
[40:02] was sealed what a beautiful
[40:05] type I I wonder if Daniel knew that
[40:07] brother bang that he was going to be a
[40:08] type of Jesus Christ I'm going to be I'm
[40:11] G to be unlawfully uh uh put on
[40:15] trial I have no fault but they're
[40:17] goingon to they're going to condemn me
[40:18] and they're going to throw me down into
[40:20] a
[40:20] pit and they're going to roll a stone
[40:23] over the pit and they're going to seal
[40:25] it with the king's seal that's exactly
[40:27] what the the Bible said about Pilate
[40:28] pilate sealed it and then he put
[40:30] prisoners there but little did he know
[40:32] it is not wasn't going to be three days
[40:33] it just going to be one day so Daniel
[40:35] had to endure one night but the angel of
[40:38] God was there amen God's angel comes to
[40:41] shut the the lion's mouth how many can
[40:44] see Christ in that is that beautiful
[40:46] that's beautiful there's a trial he's
[40:48] not guilty but they make him guilty by
[40:51] changing the lost and God comes God's
[40:54] angel comes and helps out Daniel praise
[40:57] the Lord
[40:58] I think that's a beautiful type you can
[40:59] see there verse 22 the angel of the Lord
[41:02] shuts uh the Lion's
[41:04] mouths I'll never forget that when
[41:06] brother Tim McKinny preached here and he
[41:07] he preached Your Den of Lions remember
[41:09] that I don't know if bang might remember
[41:10] that Bo might remember that that was one
[41:12] of my favorite Servants of all time well
[41:15] I shouldn't say favorite but one of my
[41:17] most impactful sermons that I've ever
[41:18] heard preach because he brought it down
[41:20] to uh we we get in our trials and all
[41:23] these Lions all of our trials surround
[41:25] us like lions Satan comes from this this
[41:27] angle Satan comes from that angle uh but
[41:30] God's able to Deliver Us from all of our
[41:31] Lives amen he's able to Deliver Us from
[41:33] every time Satan comes like a roaring
[41:35] Lon uh the Bible said that we can
[41:38] overcome him the Bible said that we'll
[41:40] overcome him by the blood of the Lamb
[41:42] amen so when Satan comes in like a lion
[41:45] the Bible said cast your cares upon the
[41:46] Lord amen for he carth for you I
[41:49] remember after that sermon I wrote down
[41:51] five or six things I struggled with and
[41:53] I prayed about them and God gave me
[41:54] victory over all like I wasn't you know
[41:56] give my wife wife attention I was eating
[41:58] too much food I was being really
[42:00] gluttonous you know uh was watching uh
[42:02] sport too much Sports on my on my phone
[42:05] and stuff like that and God gave me
[42:07] victory over all those by God's grace so
[42:09] I know if we go sincere before God and
[42:12] we say God deliver me from these lines
[42:14] deliver me from Satan's Temptations God
[42:16] is the deliverer amen he's mighty to
[42:18] save as we sing that song Hallelujah
[42:21] Christ is mighty to save
[42:23] amen and it's also good to think about
[42:26] this he'll shut the mouth of your
[42:27] accusers oh brother brother's saying
[42:30] this about you the sister saying this
[42:32] about you your cooworker saying this
[42:34] about you your grandma grandpa your dad
[42:36] saying evil things about you he'll close
[42:38] their mouths so you don't hear it amen
[42:40] he'll close their mouths so you can
[42:43] stand there and worship God stand there
[42:46] and be in the right standing have your
[42:48] fellowship with God Almighty I like that
[42:51] look at verse 23 we'll skip ahead we
[42:53] know the story The King was up all night
[42:55] can you imagine having a heathen King
[42:56] praying and fasting for you God will
[42:59] make everybody witness amen of his power
[43:01] and His glory amen see the king even
[43:04] this needs a pers he could tell Daniel
[43:06] was a man of God why because he was
[43:07] always faithful at work he saw how Godly
[43:10] he was he saw what a faithful man he was
[43:12] fair he was honest and so that will make
[43:15] even a Godly life will make a sinner
[43:17] I'll say like that praying fast for you
[43:19] he spent the night prayer fasting could
[43:21] hardly get to bed my
[43:24] goodness look at verse 23
[43:30] it says actually let me read 22 my God
[43:33] ha sent his Angel has shut the Lion's
[43:35] mouths that they have not hurt me for as
[43:38] much as before him innocency was found
[43:40] in me and also before thee okay have I
[43:43] done no hurt isn't this something now
[43:46] just uh think about this too God saved
[43:50] uh Daniel because he was innocent but
[43:52] God didn't save Stephen from being
[43:54] stoed so see every life has a Purp
[43:57] purpose on this Earth can you say Amen
[43:58] to that am amen they're both innocent
[44:01] they both done nothing wrong they're
[44:02] both falsely accused God Saves one and
[44:05] God brings another one right to
[44:07] Heaven amen know it's like the I heard a
[44:11] denomination they say God has a great
[44:13] plan for your life what about Stephen's
[44:15] life you know see they're talking about
[44:17] oh riches money big churches Fame that's
[44:21] what they mean God has a great plan for
[44:22] your life but God did have a great plan
[44:24] for even martyr's lives right because
[44:27] they receive a martyr's
[44:29] crown amen they receive a different
[44:32] Crown it's a martyr's crown but it's
[44:34] still eternal life attached to it amen
[44:37] remember uh uh brother BR said we went
[44:40] on this quote a few weeks ago brother
[44:41] saids some lives are given and some
[44:43] lives are striven right some lives are
[44:45] given as Martyrs and we must strive
[44:47] daily uh in order to win our Crown right
[44:50] now we don't have persecution so our
[44:52] crown comes by striving daily pressing
[44:55] on every day keeping our fellowship with
[44:56] God God Amen brother said the same faith
[44:59] that makes a man give his life like
[45:00] Stephen is the same faith it takes to
[45:02] daily serve God and pray and St the
[45:05] channel of Fellowship all the days of
[45:06] your life amen it's the same Faith
[45:09] exactly
[45:11] right so see because he believed yeah
[45:14] verse 23 I never got that then was the
[45:16] king exceedingly glad for him and
[45:18] commanded that they should take Daniel
[45:19] up out of the den So Daniel was taken up
[45:22] out of the dead and no matter hurt was
[45:23] found on him why because he believed in
[45:26] his God go so this time God came down to
[45:29] show I'm going to show everybody there
[45:32] that I'm going to protect an innocent
[45:35] man now he didn't have to do that he
[45:37] didn't he didn't do that with Stephen
[45:38] although he did put him to bed early you
[45:39] know before Bible say he went to sleep
[45:41] before he got Stone remember that in the
[45:43] face of an Angel so God did keep him
[45:44] from some of the pain but he never kept
[45:47] Christ from the pain right so in this
[45:49] situation God come out and said the
[45:51] reason I saved you was because you were
[45:54] innocent because you believed in God
[45:57] amen so that's that that that's our
[45:59] desire church is to believe God if the
[46:01] laws change we'll still believe God's
[46:03] word praise God whether he sends an
[46:06] angel or not whether he send comes as a
[46:08] fourth man in the fire or not no matter
[46:10] what he allows we must believe God and
[46:13] be innocent before God right and live
[46:16] according to the word of God
[46:19] Amen so that's a good a good type there
[46:22] for us to
[46:24] see now I want to read that the verse 26
[46:27] and then we'll I'm kind of be done with
[46:28] this and I want to just end with the
[46:29] quotes so I'm going to end with the
[46:30] quotes but in verse
[46:33] 26 uh after he is brought up out of the
[46:36] pit Darius writes a letter unto all
[46:40] nations peoples the languages that dwell
[46:42] upon Earth now remember Nebuchadnezzar
[46:44] did the same thing right after God uh
[46:48] after God changed Nebuchadnezzar's heart
[46:50] for seven years and brought him back
[46:51] what Nebuchadnezzar do he wrote a letter
[46:53] to everybody on the earth so can you
[46:54] imagine Daniel's testimony so strong he
[46:57] had two kings send letters all around
[46:59] the world to glorify God Amen The Power
[47:03] of One testimony what did he do all the
[47:04] time he just prayed all the time he
[47:07] worked hard all the time he gave God all
[47:09] the glory he's a man greatly beloved of
[47:12] God and so God makes two kings uh tell
[47:15] all the world that he is the Living God
[47:19] Amen what a testimony my goodness
[47:24] Glory Mercy verse 25
[47:27] then King darus wrote unto all people
[47:29] Nations and languages that dwell in all
[47:31] the Earth peace be multiplied unto you I
[47:33] make a decree that in every Dominion of
[47:35] my kingdom men tremble in fear before
[47:37] the god of Daniel for he is the Living
[47:40] God and steadfast forever and his
[47:43] kingdom that which shall not be
[47:45] destroyed and his Dominion shall be even
[47:47] unto the end you see how there's a time
[47:49] that you need to tremble before God can
[47:52] you see that he's darus is telling them
[47:54] you need to tremble in fear before God
[47:55] almighty
[47:57] now usually our trembling in fear comes
[47:59] when at the beginning of our
[48:00] conversion right because the Bible tells
[48:03] us that we should serve god with fear
[48:05] and trembling I many remember that
[48:07] demons believe but the demons believe
[48:09] and tremble don't they so we should have
[48:12] a point in our Christian life where
[48:14] we're such uh we have such a holy
[48:16] reverence for God we fear and tremble
[48:18] God's word because this is what this is
[48:20] what he learned this is what Darius
[48:21] learned a me right a me he's not even a
[48:24] a Hebrew he learns we must fear and
[48:27] tremble before God don't play games with
[48:30] God be as sincere as you possibly can
[48:32] with God Almighty fear and tremble
[48:34] before
[48:36] him right now verse
[48:39] 20 y read
[48:43] that verse 27 he delivereth and rescue
[48:46] and he worketh signs and wonders in
[48:48] heaven and in Earth who have delivered
[48:50] Daniel from the power of the lion so
[48:52] this Daniel prospered in the reign of
[48:54] Darius in the reign of Cyrus the verion
[48:58] now just a minut here let me look up
[48:59] that scripture fear and Trum think it's
[49:02] like right on my tongue here anybody
[49:04] remember that New Testament scripture
[49:05] about fear and
[49:25] trembling okay well there's actually
[49:28] numerous scriptures in here oh yeah yeah
[49:30] there it is Ephesians 2:12 let me switch
[49:33] over here Ephesians sorry Philippians
[49:35] 2:12
[49:36] pardon that's the one I was thinking of
[49:38] Philippians
[49:42] 2:12 haven't studied that one lately so
[49:45] I couldn't recall it very good Ephesians
[49:47] I'm sorry Philippians
[49:49] 2:12 wherefore my beloved as you have
[49:52] always obeyed not as in my presence only
[49:55] but now much more in my absence
[49:57] work out your own salvation with what
[50:00] fear and trembling so fear and trembling
[50:02] is required in the Old Testament and
[50:03] guess what church it's required in the
[50:05] New Testament too you must fear and
[50:07] tremble before God so there's times in
[50:09] prayer when we're just we're like that I
[50:11] don't know about you but I've had many
[50:12] times like when I'm praying I'm
[50:13] trembling asking God for Mercy or asking
[50:15] God for Grace or giving me God God give
[50:17] me direction or Lord I love you I will
[50:19] worship you this is a requirement in the
[50:22] old and the new how believe Daniel had
[50:24] fear and trembling in his life no doubt
[50:27] all those prayers all those faithful uh
[50:29] requests made before God God honored it
[50:32] and said because you're innocent I'm
[50:33] going to protect you from those lies
[50:35] amen glory let's here let's try to
[50:38] finish up here by God's grace one been
[50:40] preaching about 20 24 minutes so this
[50:43] GNA be a real record here my wife's
[50:45] gonna be real proud of me here by God's
[50:49] grace but the reason I say that just a
[50:51] joke she doesn't give me a hard time I'm
[50:54] saying I gotta I just don't want to lose
[50:56] my voice okay so I did a little search
[50:58] on just the words prayer life and
[51:00] there's eight
[51:02] hits and I'm not going to read that I
[51:04] don't have I don't have that ready I was
[51:05] going to play that but I don't have that
[51:06] ready but said having a prayer life is
[51:09] an old fashion fashioned experience so
[51:12] when you're constantly in prayer with
[51:14] God then you know you're one of them I'm
[51:17] one of them I'm one of them it's
[51:19] oldfashioned because people don't stay
[51:21] in prayer like they ought to now I'm
[51:22] going to go down to paragraph 52 this is
[51:25] uh believe this and if you want this I
[51:27] can just email to you I'd rather have a
[51:29] man that didn't know split peas from
[51:31] coffee split beans from coffee and know
[51:34] God in his heart to deal with my people
[51:36] then I would some man with enough
[51:38] education to choke a mule and know
[51:40] nothing about God that's right bless
[51:42] your heart brother an oldfashioned sassr
[51:45] experience what we need today we don't
[51:48] want to know genealogy you need a little
[51:52] neology that's what man needs today amen
[51:57] back to God back to the prayer life
[51:59] where speaking out praying hold on to
[52:02] God till it comes to pass God will do it
[52:05] amen amen what are we holding on for
[52:08] church well the Rapture our loved ones
[52:11] gifts of the spear Miracles whatever
[52:14] whatever you're holding on for God to do
[52:16] hang on to it that shows you're a real
[52:17] saint of God Abraham did it 25 years how
[52:20] many can do it longer by God's gra I can
[52:22] go longer Hallelujah I'm looking for
[52:24] Joel chapter 2 brother B I'm looking
[52:26] looking for that to be fulfilled in our
[52:28] day Hallelujah the former and the latter
[52:31] Reign Glory I'm hanging over that with
[52:33] all my
[52:34] heart now brother gets all excited he
[52:36] said oh don't be scared with that
[52:37] Hallelujah that means praise our God
[52:39] he's worthy of it amen you won't scare
[52:42] me when you say it
[52:44] either oh I love this brother testimony
[52:48] in Cleveland Ohio let everything else be
[52:51] secondarily but your prayer
[52:54] life now my Christian friends
[52:57] if you believe me to be set from God you
[52:58] seek the kingdom of God just as quick as
[53:00] you can get into it that's the only
[53:01] safety we have today the world's at the
[53:03] End of the Age only in Christ are you
[53:04] saved I'm not saying this is scary I'm
[53:06] saying it just as sely as I know how to
[53:08] stand here in the platform and say it
[53:10] but my heart's been stirred for a time
[53:12] and I know that we're ready for
[53:13] something and you Christians don't stay
[53:16] in that lukewarm condition any longer
[53:18] lay aside everything to get just get as
[53:21] close to God as you can walk with him
[53:24] talk with him let everything else be
[53:26] secondary but your prayer life stay
[53:28] right with him all the time am I don't
[53:32] know why I stopped in my speech to say
[53:33] that but I could prove that I'd be
[53:35] willing to say that that's the spirit of
[53:37] God that's speaking right now a warning
[53:39] to you that's right remember I'm saying
[53:41] that under the anointing of the spirit
[53:42] of God is that
[53:44] beautiful that's in Cleveland Ohio in
[53:46] 1950 brother Ram gives them a warning by
[53:48] the spirit of
[53:49] God don't St in luk or condition walk
[53:52] with him and talk with him put prayer
[53:55] life before for everything by God's
[54:00] grace the prophet
[54:07] Elisha I'm going to skip down
[54:12] here watch when a Believer gets out of
[54:14] contact with his maker they fixed up
[54:17] their compass for seven days and went
[54:18] out to Wilderness taking the king of
[54:20] Edom with them to meet this great
[54:22] company and the mobites out
[54:24] there now when they went off such a
[54:26] hurry without even considering God he
[54:29] tells the story of Israel not praying
[54:31] I'm sorry with Joseph Jehosaphat and
[54:33] Ahab not even considering God when they
[54:35] found out seven days was up well their
[54:37] water supply was cut off they didn't
[54:39] have any water to drink and there they
[54:41] was out there with their cattle with
[54:42] their animals and water supply cut off
[54:45] and looks like it was just about the end
[54:48] for them now that's what we do sometimes
[54:50] we go up on a tantrum somewhere and not
[54:53] think about God not pray over it ask the
[54:56] Lord whether we should do it or not and
[54:58] we find out that our supply of blessings
[55:00] is cut off then we wonder sometimes well
[55:03] wonder why I can't have no more
[55:05] blessings if you don't watch you let
[55:07] down your prayer life you say well I'm
[55:09] MC Christian well that's the more sign
[55:11] you should pray than ever read the Bible
[55:13] every day pray every day don't make any
[55:15] decision too harshly or too quickly
[55:17] without first considering God about it
[55:20] ask him father shall I do this
[55:22] father ask him is it your will for me to
[55:25] do this
[55:27] then see what the holy spirit will speak
[55:28] to you he might not give you a vision
[55:30] but he will speak to you in some way to
[55:33] let you know if you'll be sincere and
[55:35] ask you amen
[55:38] beautiful see sometimes you get little
[55:40] TR Tantrums he said why does this happen
[55:42] why does that happen but man says pray
[55:44] about it pray about it don't let down in
[55:48] your prayer
[55:50] life I'm many want a more active prayer
[55:52] life praise God I
[55:55] do I guess he keeps going here let me
[55:57] read this if I underline it it must been
[55:58] important well if a nation or Army
[56:01] should consult the Lord in a time of
[56:02] trouble what about when a cancer has got
[56:04] you in a corner when TV's got you in a
[56:06] corner when afflictions got you in a
[56:09] corner don't give up let's consult the
[56:11] Lord about it and see what he' have to
[56:12] say maybe say well I'm a drunker I'm a
[56:14] harder I'm cursed all my life don't give
[56:16] up let's consult the Lord about it now
[56:18] and let's see what he'd say about it say
[56:20] well brother BR I've tried for six years
[56:21] to be born again the spirit of God to
[56:23] receive the Holy Spirit he never yet
[56:25] come to me well well let's try again
[56:27] tonight and see what the Lord will say
[56:30] for you always willing if we'll just get
[56:32] everything out of the way amen praise
[56:36] God when Satan Cuts your prayer life he
[56:39] says you're
[56:40] gone now what gone from the blessings
[56:43] right if you're a True Believer gone
[56:44] from the
[56:47] blessings all right now he gives a
[56:48] statement about uh if you love the world
[56:51] or things of the world the love of God's
[56:52] not even in you it's satisfying portion
[56:54] of God he has for each of you it's for
[56:56] whosoever
[56:57] will David he said as the heart thirst
[57:01] for the water Brook so my soul thirst
[57:02] after thee oh god oh when I think of
[57:04] that David being a Woodsman I've been
[57:06] through that part of the country you
[57:08] find out a lot of times there's been a
[57:09] lot of deers at Rome the heart is a deer
[57:11] and if you watch nature you'll see God
[57:13] and they'll have wild dogs in that
[57:15] country and they eat the deer they would
[57:17] come in packs and they overtook the
[57:20] deers and one of the things they do is
[57:23] cut the little what we call hamstring in
[57:25] the back the leader and just cut out a
[57:27] whole pack then they can't run those
[57:29] dogs will eat as much as they can then
[57:31] the others can't pull away very much and
[57:33] then they're easier prey than to run
[57:35] right back and get them he said that's
[57:38] the way the devil does he will cut you
[57:41] off from prayer
[57:43] meetings right he's done cut the
[57:46] hamstrings right then so he he types
[57:48] hamstring as your prayer
[57:51] life and the Bible said we're supposed
[57:53] to run the race with perseverance so
[57:55] where's your strength come from running
[57:57] being persevering prayer helps your
[57:59] perseverance prayer helps you keep
[58:01] pressing on why because you start
[58:03] talking to God about it God gives you
[58:05] peace or God gives you hope or you renew
[58:07] your strength when you talk to God God
[58:10] gives you back he pours something back
[58:12] into your heart and it gives you the
[58:14] perseverance you need to press
[58:16] on he said you'll be you'll pull around
[58:19] from this church to that you'll run from
[58:20] here to there but anytime the devil
[58:22] wants to go you up he's got you under
[58:23] his control when he cut your pray life
[58:25] brother you're gone that's right when he
[58:28] cuts that thirst off of you and perverts
[58:30] it in the things of the world he's got
[58:32] you where he wants you he will let you
[58:34] gobble on here till you get to a certain
[58:36] place then crash your life without God
[58:38] right there true he's talking about
[58:39] Sinners there
[58:41] right but we all know there's power in
[58:43] prayer we all know there's power in
[58:45] prayer and that's your hamstring right
[58:47] you don't want to get your prayer life
[58:49] cut off because there goes your
[58:50] hamstring I injured my hamstring a few
[58:52] times in football guess what I didn't
[58:53] play I wasn't running I do a lot out of
[58:56] rehab to get my hamstring back or my
[58:58] groin muscle all these muscles right
[59:00] brother Likens that unto prayer you
[59:03] can't run the race without a prayer life
[59:06] amen where's your strength gone Samson I
[59:09] don't underline anything in
[59:16] there all right I'm just going to go to
[59:18] this one where's our strength gone
[59:20] Samson I'm sorry neglecting the Holy
[59:23] Ghost not moving up with God Grieves the
[59:25] spirit shaving of Samson was getting
[59:27] away from prayer life and the Holy Ghost
[59:29] wow that's what the hair represented
[59:31] right his prayer life and the Holy Ghost
[59:33] brother a secret so what's our secret
[59:36] prayer time with God and the move of the
[59:39] Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's our
[59:41] secret praise God we must not give that
[59:44] away we must not give away our prayer
[59:45] life this is from
[59:53] 1959 all right he talks about sinners
[59:56] the Sinners will start to the altar to
[59:57] get right with God and the Christians
[59:59] will sit and pop chewing gum looking at
[1:00:01] them that's the truth when he used to be
[1:00:03] in the Baptist Church when I come out
[1:00:04] the Old Kentucky Baptist why old cner
[1:00:07] boy would start to the altar would be
[1:00:08] every mam in there around his neck he'd
[1:00:11] come through before he got to the
[1:00:13] altar so brother saw women mothers that
[1:00:16] would see their children come to the
[1:00:17] altar intercept them before they could
[1:00:19] even get here and already start praying
[1:00:21] for them my a that something church that
[1:00:23] sounds like Revival to me
[1:00:26] [Applause]
[1:00:27] what's the
[1:00:29] matter he said they shaved off the
[1:00:31] secret they got away from paralyzed they
[1:00:34] got away from the Holy
[1:00:36] Ghost crowing roosters educated canaries
[1:00:39] with canary bird brain trying to explain
[1:00:41] to you all the ins outs of God you don't
[1:00:43] know God that way you know him when
[1:00:45] you're born again that's the only way
[1:00:47] you'll ever be able to know him God is
[1:00:49] still God he's just as much God today as
[1:00:51] ever was he's the God that was on the
[1:00:52] mount with Elijah he's a God that was in
[1:00:54] the Dead with Daniel amen he's the god
[1:00:57] of Pentecost he's the god of the church
[1:01:00] amen get back to all night prayer
[1:01:02] meetings as you had down there last
[1:01:04] night he says he said I'm seeing the
[1:01:06] world coming into the Pentecost I'm
[1:01:08] zealous and when I see the church begin
[1:01:10] to flirt with the world it rises
[1:01:12] something in within me I can't set still
[1:01:14] I've got to say something can call me
[1:01:17] what you want to I just got to let it
[1:01:18] out I'm jealous of the church I don't
[1:01:20] want her entangled with the world God
[1:01:22] forbid that she'll ever get entangled
[1:01:24] with the world let her stay free if she
[1:01:26] even has to Worship in a Tin Pan Alley
[1:01:30] Tin Pan
[1:01:32] Alley she don't need no seminaries no
[1:01:35] cemeteries whatever goes with it what
[1:01:37] she needs is a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:39] and a renewing praise God renew my
[1:01:41] salvation restore the joy of my
[1:01:43] salvation I like that see the power of
[1:01:46] God doesn't shake the church anymore
[1:01:47] just becomes so common to them and they
[1:01:50] go down and say well that's pretty good
[1:01:51] uh huh going off my it ought to drive us
[1:01:53] to our knees to repentance it ought to
[1:01:55] bring us to teardrops it ought to bring
[1:01:57] Salvation And Soul winning the coming
[1:01:59] Lord ought to press us so hard till we
[1:02:01] be in every street corner trying to tell
[1:02:04] somebody do something about it it'll be
[1:02:06] too late to do it after a while amen
[1:02:09] look at that sounds like Zeal for the
[1:02:11] Lord does it
[1:02:14] hallelujah what is quite a quote I
[1:02:16] didn't know it this long here
[1:02:19] I okay he said I'm closing saying this
[1:02:22] one hope we have while they had Samson
[1:02:24] bound there was a new shock grow out I'm
[1:02:27] praying God that he'll grow out of here
[1:02:29] somewhere a new shock that'll shake the
[1:02:31] Philistines like they' never been shook
[1:02:32] before I believe God will have it if he
[1:02:35] won't do it through the churches he'll
[1:02:36] take a Christian Christian businessman
[1:02:38] he'll do something another but there
[1:02:40] will be a shock of power a secret power
[1:02:42] of the Holy Ghost grow out again just as
[1:02:45] certain as anything and it'll do the job
[1:02:47] in the last days God grant that we'll
[1:02:49] all be numbered with that shock when it
[1:02:52] comes amen
[1:02:58] all right I'm going to keep going here
[1:03:00] because I want to finish here all quite
[1:03:02] a
[1:03:04] quotation so how's this new shock of
[1:03:06] Samson going to brought through prayer
[1:03:08] and the Holy
[1:03:10] Ghost so brother says the reason people
[1:03:13] can't get the Holy Ghost is because
[1:03:14] their prayer life is too loose they have
[1:03:16] a loose prayer life I I need to pray
[1:03:18] today I have to pray tonight not to pray
[1:03:22] at any time he said they get loose
[1:03:26] and he says the inspector will not seal
[1:03:29] the train car until the car is so
[1:03:31] completely packed until it's so packed
[1:03:33] down so an order that the shaking of the
[1:03:35] ride won't bother the product that's on
[1:03:37] the inside that's what's the matter
[1:03:39] don't get sealed so much we're too loose
[1:03:41] about things when the inspector goes
[1:03:43] through to inspect your life to see if
[1:03:45] you're not just a little loose about
[1:03:46] things a little loose about your prayer
[1:03:50] life little loose about that temper
[1:03:52] little loose about that tongue to talk
[1:03:54] to others he'll never seal the
[1:03:57] car see some dirty habits some vile
[1:04:00] things some vulgarity mind he can't seal
[1:04:02] the car but when he's found everything
[1:04:04] in his place then he seals it amen
[1:04:07] glory amen see that church we can't get
[1:04:10] loose if we get loose on sin or I mean
[1:04:13] if we get loose on sin that's another
[1:04:14] thing but if we just get loose on our
[1:04:16] prayer lives we shouldn't even be loose
[1:04:17] on prayer lives right Sinners are loose
[1:04:20] you know are lukewarm people are loose
[1:04:22] on worldly things but the Christian the
[1:04:24] real spirit filled Christian can't be
[1:04:26] loose on spiritual things we can't be
[1:04:28] loose on prayer life and reading the
[1:04:29] Bible and listening to sermons all week
[1:04:31] and and enjoying brother R's Ministry
[1:04:33] you know we can't get loose on those
[1:04:35] things how many want to how how you want
[1:04:36] to stay tight on those things by God's
[1:04:38] gra you don't want to loose up loosen up
[1:04:40] that you want to stay focused on
[1:04:42] that
[1:04:47] Hallelujah but R said not going on with
[1:04:49] God kept Israel out of the promised
[1:04:51] land he said younger men look to the
[1:04:53] older men like our older brother here
[1:04:56] just because Mana falls from heaven
[1:04:58] doesn't mean God is well pleased with us
[1:04:59] God is calling us back to prayer life so
[1:05:01] let me just find that that's I just try
[1:05:03] to summarize it with the red up
[1:05:07] there and here to you older Christians
[1:05:09] and to the younger the younger women
[1:05:11] look at the older women the younger men
[1:05:12] look to the older men and see the way
[1:05:14] you conduct yourself to see what you do
[1:05:16] and they presume that they're all right
[1:05:17] is
[1:05:18] because you do the way you
[1:05:21] do see that's why we that's why we have
[1:05:23] to all live a Godly example right we
[1:05:26] have to all live a Godly
[1:05:27] example we should all have prayer lives
[1:05:29] we should all be an example to others
[1:05:32] exactly
[1:05:37] right let me go to the prayer line
[1:05:41] here now it's almost a impossible thing
[1:05:44] to get people praying fasting and
[1:05:47] calling on the
[1:05:49] Lord seems like the church has got so
[1:05:51] drowsy lazy in the last days so pitiful
[1:05:56] and I hate to come and just keep
[1:05:57] stirring and preaching and saying these
[1:05:58] things but brother sister that's the
[1:05:59] truth I just can't hold it it's the
[1:06:01] gospel and it must be preached it's got
[1:06:03] to be preach as a witness it's true so I
[1:06:05] think that we just presuming too much
[1:06:08] can you say Amen to that amen we've got
[1:06:11] the battle the spiritual drowsy Spirit
[1:06:14] that's right we've got to battle that
[1:06:15] lukewarm spirit and we got that church
[1:06:18] I'll just be honest as a pastor it is
[1:06:21] difficult to get people praying and
[1:06:22] fasting and calling on God right every
[1:06:25] Church of God want to how many people in
[1:06:27] that church you really think are praying
[1:06:29] fasting and call upon
[1:06:31] God and are you are we praying and
[1:06:34] fasting and calling upon God giving a
[1:06:37] sincere prayers offering sincere prayers
[1:06:40] calling on God missing meals in order to
[1:06:43] have fellowship with God have The
[1:06:45] Unbroken

[1:07:16] one so if there's no prayer life in the
[1:07:20] family that explains the condition of a
[1:07:22] worldly
[1:07:23] family right

[1:07:33] that that's
[1:07:36] right all right I'm gonna um yeah let's
[1:07:39] go on this you think of the modern
[1:07:40] American people what is it well Dad's
[1:07:42] out at the pool room mother's out with
[1:07:44] some Pet Society somewhere on the beach
[1:07:45] stretched out daughter's down at the
[1:07:47] canteen or down at the rock and roll
[1:07:49] Junior's got his hot rod there you are
[1:07:51] one he said one get a hamburger there's
[1:07:54] no home life no prayer life I've always
[1:07:58] say this if you straighten up when we
[1:08:00] break the backbone of America is when
[1:08:02] Womanhood is broken and I say this with
[1:08:04] Godly respects for my sisters this
[1:08:05] morning I met some of the finest women
[1:08:08] over there but what's happened to our
[1:08:09] women what's the matter with them let's
[1:08:11] s to our feet by God's
[1:08:13] grace how many appreciate those prayer
[1:08:15] life quotes we don't have that power's
[1:08:18] gone can't run home life's all out of
[1:08:21] order prayer is the most important thing
[1:08:24] I just want to remind of that you know
[1:08:25] as I studied and I was looking at Daniel
[1:08:28] that's what kind of came to me
[1:08:30] Church having that prayer Life by God's
[1:08:33] grace let's just have a time of prayer
[1:08:35] here if we can just bow our heads here
[1:08:37] let's ask God to keep our prayer life
[1:08:40] strong or if it's gotten weak if it's
[1:08:41] got drowsy wake my prayer life up
[1:08:45] because remember it's his Delight when
[1:08:46] we pray with a pure
[1:08:48] heart Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[1:08:51] for this
[1:08:52] word father let this never become common
[1:08:55] Lord
[1:08:57] God Daniel showed us the power of a
[1:09:00] prayer life three times a day you get on
[1:09:03] his knees now Lord we know we can pray
[1:09:05] without ceasing we don't have to get on
[1:09:07] our knees but Lord many times it humbles
[1:09:09] us Lord
[1:09:11] God I heard brother brandom say also
[1:09:13] that there's something about standing up
[1:09:14] and praying there's something about
[1:09:17] kneeling and praying because it's in the
[1:09:18] scripture all these Saints did it at
[1:09:20] different times
[1:09:26] when Solomon delegated the temple he
[1:09:28] fell on his knees the Bible said he
[1:09:30] raised His Hands to
[1:09:32] Heaven Daniel here knowing that the law
[1:09:36] would try to persecute him oh has the
[1:09:38] windows open anyway he's not ashamed he
[1:09:40] goes and gets on his knees and offers up
[1:09:42] prayers supplications and
[1:09:49] thanksgivings Lord I just pray you'd
[1:09:50] bring our prayer lives to a spot where
[1:09:52] we can be Lord if we could be privileged
[1:09:54] to be called
[1:09:56] prayer
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:00] orders Lord I'll be honest I don't feel
[1:10:03] like one yet I feel like I want to press
[1:10:06] in with more prayer dear
[1:10:09] God not to time myself not to Pat myself

[1:10:50] could hurt him because of his fellowship

[1:10:56] or we know that's not the case as we
[1:10:57] said with Stephen but Lord it may be the
[1:10:59] case with some of our Lives we'll be
[1:11:01] like a Daniel you'll protect us from
