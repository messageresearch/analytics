[25:10] one two three and he is the head of the
[25:14] body the church who is the beginning the
[25:18] firstborn from the dead that in all
[25:20] things he might have the preeminence
[25:22] let's have a prayer and ask him to have
[25:24] preeminence here through the Word of God
[25:26] Heavenly Father we bow our heads humbly
[25:28] lord god we recognize Lord that your
[25:31] angels are here Lord God they're your
[25:33] prophets said they're here too to write
[25:35] down Lord the prayer request Lord and to
[25:37] record what's going on
[25:39] so Lord in Jesus Christ's name help us
[25:41] to give you preeminence tonight Lord God
[25:43] we know you're watching Lord God
[25:46] organize I heard this week Lord we know
[25:48] character is what we do when we're alone
[25:50] dear God and when we think no one's
[25:52] watching
[25:53] but Nord I want to live a life where I
[25:55] feel like you're watching me all the
[25:56] time because you are though the
[25:59] scripture says the eyes of the Lord run
[26:01] to and fro upon the whole earth and Lord
[26:04] you're seeking men and women that will
[26:06] serve you and want to please you so lord
[26:08] maybe we just feel that your spiritual
[26:10] eyes are here tonight the Holy Spirit's
[26:13] here tonight watching our behavior
[26:15] watching our attitudes Lord God and
[26:17] Father knowing that may we give you
[26:19] preeminence Lord God you're always
[26:21] watching us and or thank you for always
[26:23] watching us Lord it's comforting to know
[26:26] that our father cares so much that he
[26:28] watches us every hour Lord we give you
[26:31] glory speak to us through this thy word
[26:33] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saint
[26:35] said Amen god bless just being seated
[26:37] praise the Lord so I'm hoping to work my
[26:42] way up to the the part of this sermon
[26:44] where brother Branham talks about
[26:45] predestination I like to end with
[26:46] predestination a few thoughts on that
[26:50] wonderful wonderful doctrine by the
[26:53] grace of the Lord
[26:54] so again happy Thanksgiving to all those
[26:56] livestreaming and Everett everybody here
[26:58] by the grace the Lord hope everybody has
[27:00] a wonderful Thanksgiving I know I'm
[27:02] going to by God's grace if the Lord
[27:04] tarries I'll hopefully I'll take a nap
[27:06] or something and feel good and and get
[27:08] everybody healed up that's what we want
[27:09] to do we want to get the family healed
[27:11] up so we thank the Lord for Thanksgiving
[27:14] and Thanksgiving will always be a
[27:15] special time for me it was I looked it
[27:18] up today it was actually the same day it
[27:21] was November 22nd 2001 when I first
[27:24] heard the message and the tomorrow's a
[27:26] 22nd as well so it lines up perfectly 17
[27:29] years ago tomorrow I heard that serpent
[27:30] seed for the first time I got pictures
[27:33] from that night I'm gonna try to post it
[27:34] on Facebook if I can remember to do that
[27:36] and just thank the Lord but Thanksgiving
[27:38] is always a special time because that's
[27:40] when I received the message so it always
[27:42] means so much and we can always be
[27:44] thankful for God's Word and and it'll
[27:46] always just direct our lives
[27:48] praise the Lord now I want to just
[27:51] recall this statement that brother
[27:53] Branham made but the man said by
[27:55] preaching this message
[27:56] he said if God will help me and reveal
[27:59] to your in
[28:00] to your mind all these things that I've
[28:02] talked about all through the days of the
[28:03] tabernacle wife said what I've said why
[28:06] I've done what I've done this is why now
[28:09] I want to just rephrase the title it
[28:11] kind of turned this title around its
[28:13] Christ as the mystery of God revealed I
[28:14] kind of want to just turn it around so
[28:16] it makes a little more sense to the
[28:17] children God's mystery revealed is Jesus
[28:23] Christ so in other words God's mystery
[28:25] is Christ if we could just say it
[28:27] another way
[28:28] God had this mystery in his mind and
[28:30] what was the mystery to bring forth
[28:33] Jesus Christ so I just want to simplify
[28:35] you know I don't want to sound confusing
[28:37] Christ as the mystery of God revealed in
[28:40] other words God's mystery was Jesus
[28:42] Christ amen
[28:43] and so today God's mystery is Jesus
[28:46] Christ which is the form ease in today
[28:48] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[28:51] that's what we're looking at tonight and
[28:52] that's what this whole sermon is about
[28:53] it's showing how God was above us and
[28:57] then God as the Father God with us as
[29:00] the son Jesus Christ and now God in us
[29:03] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[29:06] I want to just simplify that hopefully
[29:08] even the youngest Karras you know and I
[29:10] don't think Victoria could but maybe
[29:11] Karras could understand it I'm not sure
[29:13] of victory is do much spiritual thinking
[29:15] tonight but maybe so I want to just
[29:20] catch that day Karras can you understand
[29:22] that that God had a mystery one day but
[29:25] his mystery was Jesus Christ can you
[29:28] understand that
[29:29] it's like God had this secret he said
[29:31] I'm gonna show everybody my secret and
[29:33] then finally the secret was that baby
[29:35] Jesus that was God's secret and it was
[29:39] so gorgeous when he that baby was born
[29:42] all the angels filled the sky and saying
[29:44] glory to God in the highest as we were
[29:46] listening on the way to church amen
[29:49] glory so I want to pick it up right
[29:51] there God's great mystery was that
[29:54] beautiful baby the Lord Jesus Christ of
[29:56] course he became a wonderful man we say
[29:59] a common looking man but not he was
[30:02] uncommon in power Aim head he was
[30:04] uncommon in spiritual beauty and
[30:06] strength he had no physical beauty we
[30:08] desire him but he was sure beautiful
[30:10] spiritually amen
[30:12] what a character there's never been a
[30:13] character like him now he ended last
[30:16] week was showing how Jesus Christ is the
[30:18] principal theme of the Bible and because
[30:21] of that he should be the principal theme
[30:23] of our lives now brother Branham says he
[30:26] says now think about this he said God
[30:28] made him the head of all things the
[30:30] Colossians said so here he said he's the
[30:32] head of all things to us for he was for
[30:35] us which we considered all things you
[30:38] say what about the sinner he was made to
[30:42] be judge of the sinner if he won't
[30:44] accept it sure brother man is breaking
[30:46] in this thought of he's the head of all
[30:47] things
[30:47] he's even the head of all sinners can
[30:50] you say amen to that
[30:51] Jesus Christ is the head of the believer
[30:53] the Saints but he's also the head of
[30:56] every sinner he was made the glory for
[31:00] the believer who does accept it so there
[31:03] all things were made by him and for him
[31:08] program said it takes the night to
[31:11] express the glory of the day how many
[31:13] like looking outside and seeing the
[31:14] night the cold night I mean like that
[31:15] how many like though the beauty of the
[31:17] morning better that's her brother have
[31:20] says he's he said this is what God did
[31:22] he's the head of all things and he says
[31:25] it takes the night to express the glory
[31:28] of the day now if you're really tired
[31:30] you might see the glory of the night
[31:32] because you can't wait to go to bed but
[31:34] brother ham says usually it's the glory
[31:36] of the day that we look forward to it
[31:38] takes the vessel of dishonor to express
[31:42] the love and care for the vessel of the
[31:44] honored in other words it takes a Judas
[31:47] or a Pharaoh and awful Pharaoh or
[31:50] betrayer like Judas it takes the the
[31:55] contrast of that the wickedness of that
[31:57] to show the beauty of a faithful servant
[32:00] of a Peter praise God of a Moses Amen it
[32:03] takes one to express the glory of the
[32:05] other he says it takes the evil woman
[32:08] that would wear immoral clothes and sell
[32:11] her morals to express the virtue of a
[32:13] decent genuine lady see it takes a crook
[32:17] and a thief in a man to express the
[32:19] genuine of a real believer a real
[32:21] Christian it takes a hypocrite to show
[32:23] up the believer what he is
[32:26] and brother have said see so all things
[32:29] were made by him and since he's made all
[32:31] things he said all things was he said
[32:33] then since that's true we should we
[32:35] should make our identification with him
[32:37] we should be identified ourselves with
[32:40] him because he has identified himself
[32:42] with us we should be identified with him
[32:45] he says how by living for him not just a
[32:49] confession Amen so because he made us we
[32:53] should live for him and not just have a
[32:55] confession the Rebbe said so many take
[32:59] the so many people take a confession
[33:02] well are you a Christian a Methodist he
[33:05] said that's a long way from being making
[33:06] yourself known as a Christian he says
[33:08] look what the Methodist does I'm a
[33:10] Baptist well look what the Baptist does
[33:12] he says I'm a Catholic look what they do
[33:15] see but the only way you can actually be
[33:18] a Christian is for Christ to identify
[33:21] himself in you he says how we get a
[33:25] stinger there that's that that should
[33:27] have been a stinger to us I should have
[33:30] stung us I hope everybody on the tape
[33:32] gets that seat now what's he talking
[33:35] about he's talking about God's got to
[33:36] come down and identify by the Holy
[33:38] Spirit each of our lives and and and
[33:41] show to everybody that we are his
[33:44] children and the Bible teaches us
[33:46] plainly in mark 16:20 so they do you
[33:49] want to pull that up here mark 16:20 so
[33:53] again sorry par me forgive me mark 16:20
[33:58] and they went forth and preached
[34:00] everywhere the Lord working with them
[34:02] and confirming the word with signs
[34:05] following amen so see the Lord will work
[34:08] with you and the Lord will confirm his
[34:11] word that you preach oh how many times
[34:13] have we seen it got a preacher word and
[34:16] it's just the word that confirms our
[34:19] prayer or confirms our desire or it's
[34:23] the Holy Spirit that confirms our prayer
[34:25] answers our prayer heal someone or save
[34:28] someone it's God working with us amen he
[34:32] said that's the only way to be a
[34:34] Christian is when God identifies you in
[34:36] other words God says this is my son or
[34:38] this is my daughter
[34:40] and I'm gonna vindicate them and prove
[34:42] that they're my daughter by manifesting
[34:45] my spirit in them praise God
[34:48] acts 1413 that he might pull that one up
[34:50] there so see this is the only way you
[34:53] can be a Christian it's not and in
[34:55] church even when people ask me what are
[34:56] you I just say I'm a Holy Ghost field
[34:58] Christian I don't always say well you
[35:00] know I'm a message believer I'd only say
[35:02] that I always say I'm a Holy Ghost field
[35:04] Christian who follows the message of
[35:06] William Brannen I'll say something like
[35:07] that but the main confession we should
[35:09] have is a Christian and then not just
[35:12] have a confession but pshhh people
[35:14] should be able to see that Christ is
[35:15] living in us hallelujah x4 13 now when
[35:21] they saw the boldness of Peter and John
[35:22] and perceived they were unlearned and
[35:25] ignorant men they marveled and they took
[35:27] knowledge of them that they had been
[35:28] with Jesus amen so see being bold about
[35:32] Jesus and then having Jesus do miracles
[35:36] in our lives
[35:37] makes people know that Jesus is with us
[35:40] amen Loretta says well you say I'm
[35:44] Pentecostal he says that doesn't mean a
[35:46] thing
[35:46] it's got to be Christ identified in you
[35:49] that's when he's recognized you you say
[35:51] I spoke with tongues he said Devils does
[35:53] too you say I shouted he said the
[35:55] muhammadans Buddhas and everything
[35:57] shouts the Indians scream at the snake
[36:00] dance sure they all do cults clans and
[36:02] everything else screaming holler
[36:03] they holler and shout at a baseball game
[36:06] so just shouting tonight doesn't prove
[36:09] anything because they can shouting in
[36:11] Cleveland you know they're at the
[36:13] basketball game they're shouting in
[36:16] Golden's in in California at the
[36:18] basketball game
[36:20] he says that's not the evidence but when
[36:23] Christ is identified in you identifying
[36:25] himself then you are christ-like which
[36:28] the word Christian means to be
[36:30] christ-like there is your identification
[36:33] amen
[36:34] how many want to be like Christ praise
[36:37] God that's that's what brother Han says
[36:39] this is what God is trying to do God is
[36:43] the head of you when he lives through
[36:47] you and manifests his sphere through you
[36:49] and proves other people that there's
[36:51] real Christians alive today
[36:54] amen hallelujah now brother and now
[36:59] breaks in the three fold purpose of the
[37:01] mystery of God which I don't I don't
[37:04] think I got to this last week so now in
[37:07] paragraph 140 finally breaks in this
[37:09] mystery that he says was hid back in the
[37:12] mind of God God had three purposes in
[37:14] this mystery
[37:16] now notice God has a three full purpose
[37:19] in this great mystery secret in this
[37:23] secret he had before the world began he
[37:25] has a three full purpose and we want to
[37:30] find out what this three full purpose
[37:32] was the first thing God wanted to reveal
[37:35] himself to the people that's the first
[37:38] purpose God wanted to reveal himself to
[37:40] the people he couldn't do it as great
[37:43] Jehovah God who covered all space-time
[37:45] an eternity could not he's too great to
[37:48] have her be revealed to people because
[37:50] it would be too mysterious he says how
[37:56] could that great being that after you
[37:58] went beyond the cycle of hundreds of
[38:00] billions and trillions and trillions of
[38:02] years of light space and out into the
[38:04] infinite into the eternity and a great
[38:06] creature that was all that and still is
[38:09] so how could someone as great as God who
[38:11] could live trillions and trains of years
[38:13] and never change how could even begin to
[38:16] manifest himself to us but brother Han
[38:20] said but that's what he wanted to do he
[38:22] loved fatherhood for he was a father and
[38:26] he the only way he could express it was
[38:29] to become a son a man hey I let hear you
[38:33] so god I said oh I love me too father I
[38:36] just want to be a father the only way
[38:39] you could express that was to become a
[38:40] son a man that's the reason Jesus kept
[38:44] saying the son of man they didn't know
[38:46] what he was talking about many of them
[38:48] he said now do you get it he wanted to
[38:50] express himself that he that that was
[38:54] his one of his great threefold purposes
[38:56] was to express himself identify himself
[38:58] with human beings to reveal himself in
[39:01] Christ so what was God's first purpose
[39:05] he wanted to reveal himself as a
[39:07] father and reveal himself also in Christ
[39:13] now secondly he wants to have the
[39:16] preeminence in this body of believers
[39:18] his bride that he might live in other
[39:22] people so first he wanted to live in His
[39:25] Son and anyone to live in his people
[39:30] now he could do that in Adam and Eve but
[39:32] sins separated them so now there had to
[39:35] be some way to get back in again he says
[39:38] this is rich to me to even think of it
[39:40] you see what God's purpose was why he
[39:43] didn't just keep I'm sorry now why did
[39:46] he just keep Adam and Eve like that he
[39:48] would never been able to express his
[39:50] fullness his full attribute you see that
[39:53] if God would have if God would have had
[39:56] Adam and Eve never sinned never would
[39:59] have had to dwell in people amen
[40:01] right because remember God couldn't
[40:04] dwell in people until the baptism of the
[40:06] Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost
[40:07] that's when they received the Holy
[40:10] Spirit to dwell in their souls so see
[40:13] God had to make up a plan where he you
[40:16] know Adam and Eve would be anointed with
[40:18] the spear but not living not having the
[40:20] spirit live in them they could fall and
[40:22] then God could start working to redeem
[40:25] them and pretty soon after about four
[40:27] thousand years God could live in there
[40:30] may have which member was just four days
[40:32] to God because a thousand years like
[40:35] it's like a day unto God it's only been
[40:37] two days since Jesus walked the earth in
[40:39] God's eyes amen so what was two days ago
[40:42] Monday what did you do on Monday well
[40:44] yeah dance class right that was you know
[40:47] hide at school that's just a couple days
[40:49] ago well that's what it feels like to
[40:51] God with Jesus being there Jesus was
[40:53] here two days ago
[40:55] and now we know he's coming very soon
[40:57] praise God so in God's mind
[40:59] he's coming very very soon but for us it
[41:01] might seem like a while I might get old
[41:04] on my hair or get gray maybe fall out
[41:06] but in God's eyes it's nothing it's
[41:08] nothing to see god never could have
[41:12] expressed himself if Adam and Eve never
[41:14] never would have fallen into sin he
[41:17] never could have experienced dwelling in
[41:19] someone
[41:21] I'm sure Malachi Lydia feel like that
[41:23] with their Legos maybe they make
[41:25] something so great they wish they could
[41:26] give it life don't you don't you wish
[41:28] that battering ram you could just give
[41:30] it life and just make it you know work
[41:32] and then that Lydia school that she had
[41:35] in the Lego school don't you wish you
[41:37] could make something and give it what
[41:39] God did God made Adam and Eve but but
[41:41] but he wouldn't actually live inside of
[41:43] them he wanted to dwell in them and and
[41:46] so you know when Adam and Eve fell he
[41:50] had that great place at all well one day
[41:52] he said they lost they they fell one day
[41:55] I'm coming myself amen one day I'll come
[41:59] myself and I'll redeem them and after I
[42:02] pay for other since then I can dwell in
[42:04] their souls amen
[42:06] then I can live in the very being I
[42:08] created
[42:09] amen I'm glad to say tonight that Jesus
[42:11] Christ is living in me tonight amen
[42:14] hallelujah he's living in his own
[42:16] creation how do you know because I don't
[42:18] do what I want to do I do what the word
[42:20] says amen that's how we know that we're
[42:24] fulfilling God's second purpose that God
[42:27] wants to live in people that will give
[42:29] him preeminence amen so the first thing
[42:32] is God would reveal himself to the
[42:34] people in Jesus Christ that was his
[42:36] first purpose the second purpose is to
[42:39] live in his people he says amen now how
[42:43] could he do it brother Graham says he
[42:46] said now he says because he he could
[42:49] have never sorry could have been a
[42:50] father there but that's true but he's
[42:52] also a savior so see just being a father
[42:54] to Adam and Eve wasn't enough he wanted
[42:57] to be a savior and he said you say well
[42:59] how do you know he is brother and said
[43:01] he is because I've had the experience a
[43:04] man hardly been saved out there amen
[43:07] you had the experience I was lost but
[43:10] now I'm saying they men God wanted to
[43:12] express that he wanted to save people
[43:14] and he couldn't express that if Adam and
[43:17] Eve never fell he's a savior he hadn't
[43:21] expressed that now how can he do it only
[43:23] through Christ how could he be a son
[43:25] only through Christ
[43:27] how can it be healer only through Christ
[43:29] see all things are wound up in that one
[43:31] person Jesus Christ amen
[43:34] he said by Madison when I think of it
[43:36] all the denomination's pass away he says
[43:41] everything else when I see God's great
[43:43] purpose he says God having first to
[43:47] reveal himself in Christ the fullness of
[43:48] the Godhead bodily and then to bring
[43:50] that fullness of the Godhead bodily into
[43:52] a people that could have the preeminence
[43:54] is the oversight the leading amen
[43:58] you know I was thinking about that today
[44:00] I thought I don't feel so bad as the
[44:02] pastor you know like sometimes I I just
[44:04] feel you know like well Lord am I doing
[44:07] what you have me to do it something
[44:08] struck me today when I I got up at like
[44:10] 5 o'clock this morning to study and pray
[44:12] and everything and something just struck
[44:14] me in a sin it said God thinks so much
[44:17] of pastors in the fivefold ministry he's
[44:19] been using them for 2,000 years I just
[44:23] thought well that was a real
[44:23] encouragement to me I know that's a
[44:25] pretty simple thought but I'm doing the
[44:27] same thing
[44:28] pastors did 2,000 years ago after the
[44:31] Holy Ghost fell they didn't travel all
[44:33] around and spend their time traveling
[44:34] they faithfully fed the sheep the Word
[44:36] of God and the people grew by that word
[44:39] of God amen
[44:40] and that was Jesus playing 2,000 years
[44:43] ago that still is planned tonight amen
[44:45] so that just gave me a bit of
[44:47] encouragement I said well thank you Lord
[44:49] I'm happy to do what that you've been
[44:50] doing for the last 2,000 years
[44:53] amen now brother Aaron breaks into a
[44:55] little thought here about giving God the
[44:58] preeminence but man said oh you remember
[45:01] if you didn't get the tape I preached
[45:03] here one night on a prisoner of Jesus
[45:06] Christ remember brother Ram preached a
[45:07] sermon called the prisoner
[45:10] Paul a prisoner see when God gets you to
[45:14] be his prisoner then you can't do
[45:16] nothing but what the Spirit says do Paul
[45:21] with all his great intellects he was
[45:23] taught by the mayor to be a great priest
[45:25] or rabbi someday he had high ambitions
[45:27] he was intellectually a great man great
[45:29] authority great man in the nation but he
[45:31] had to sacrifice every bit of it see to
[45:33] become part of the word to express Jesus
[45:36] Christ he knowed what it was to say he
[45:40] counted all things as dung help me
[45:42] remember that scripture that's a pretty
[45:44] pretty straightforward scripture Aikau
[45:47] all
[45:48] previous teachings as dung that I might
[45:51] win Christ program said he had to become
[45:54] a prisoner now Paul said he was a
[45:56] prisoner of three times he said in
[45:59] Ephesians what three verse one for this
[46:01] guy because I Paul the prisoner of jesus
[46:04] christ for you gentiles
[46:07] so paul was a prisoner in other words he
[46:10] couldn't go preach to the Jews God had
[46:12] imprisoned him or kept him as a preacher
[46:15] to the Gentiles that's what I feel like
[46:17] I'm a prisoner as a pastor to the Bride
[46:20] of Christ fellowship amen I'm a prisoner
[46:22] to my family I'm a prisoner to the Word
[46:25] of God
[46:26] I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ that's
[46:28] all we must be we must find what God has
[46:30] called us to be and then be a prisoner
[46:33] to that now it's not by it's not and
[46:35] it's not against our will it's with our
[46:37] will it's it's a prisoner of love as
[46:40] that song says I'm a prisoner of love
[46:43] I'm a slave to the master aim head I
[46:46] willingly toil in the heat in the cold I
[46:49] seek no reward in this world but I think
[46:53] the song says but there come a payday oh
[46:55] yes mother come a payday when the pearly
[46:58] gates unfold amen
[47:01] hey man how do you want to be a prisoner
[47:02] of love amen
[47:04] now you're it's your love that keeps you
[47:06] locked up in the commands of God that
[47:09] Superman tells us
[47:13] so in Philemon chapter 1 verse 1 and
[47:17] verse 9 Paul says the same thing Paul a
[47:19] prisoner of Jesus Christ and then he
[47:22] says and now also a prisoner of Jesus
[47:26] Christ he says it three times I am a
[47:28] prisoner of Jesus Christ now Paul gives
[47:33] two examples of Paul being a prisoner so
[47:36] let's read them liddie let's go to acts
[47:38] 16 verse 5 if you got that here's one
[47:43] way as proof that Paul was a prisoner
[47:48] now brother Branham says like this
[47:51] Paul had a notion to go to some other
[47:53] place and some rather had called him but
[47:56] he was forbidden by the Spirit to do his
[47:58] own will oh if people 1/2 spiritual can
[48:01] pick that up
[48:02] he was forbidden to do his own will he
[48:05] could only do with the spirit said he
[48:07] said the spirit forbade me he was a
[48:09] prisoner to Christ amen so Church as
[48:14] Christians we should feel the Holy
[48:16] Spirit either forbid us to do things or
[48:19] give us the permission to do things
[48:22] that's what a prisoner is you know you
[48:25] might just say well you know I had I
[48:27] guess I had a little decision I had to
[48:29] make this week kind of like be a
[48:30] prisoner but it's going on here I'm
[48:35] putting this on this airplane mode I'm
[48:37] just gonna shut it off I don't even know
[48:39] what's going on here that's twice that
[48:40] happens I think prisoner I think it's I
[48:42] think it's thought I said Siri or
[48:44] something like that but I just shut it
[48:45] off I'm gonna take it off that's strange
[48:48] yeah I've never had that happen before
[48:49] but even this week I had a little I just
[48:52] kind of felt like the Lord was testing
[48:55] me a little bit and with I don't want to
[48:59] give too many details but I kind of was
[49:03] a test a little bit and it was kind of
[49:07] like a decision with with someone that
[49:11] one to come to our church and I had to
[49:13] make a decision and and I kind of felt
[49:15] like it was the Holy Spirit was telling
[49:18] me no don't allow this person to be a
[49:20] part of our church although it was a
[49:24] temptation now Church I'll be honest
[49:25] it's a temptation to have more people
[49:27] come because you can have more ties and
[49:30] you can you can do more things you know
[49:31] you could you can get preachers more
[49:33] money consent more offerings and things
[49:34] like that although I felt it was a
[49:36] little bit of a temptation for me I felt
[49:38] it was God testing me the conviction on
[49:41] my heart said no don't allow this
[49:44] individual to do that and I thought and
[49:47] that I think that's a good idea here
[49:48] although you know we're small we'd like
[49:51] to see more people in the church I kind
[49:53] of had to tell an individual no you're
[49:55] not welcome to the church because I have
[49:57] to be a prisoner to what the Holy Spirit
[49:59] tells me
[50:01] amen and so I just you know without
[50:05] giving too many details you know I just
[50:07] had to say that and I felt like a
[50:10] temptation from Satan you know not from
[50:13] the individual but from Satan like Satan
[50:15] say well you're
[50:16] can finally grow it and all these things
[50:18] I felt a little bit of a temptation but
[50:20] I felt the Holy Spirit my heart that
[50:22] said a conviction I said I just can't do
[50:25] that now there's other reasons of course
[50:26] but I felt the Holy Spirit saying no
[50:29] don't allow this person to come amen now
[50:33] program said that's a prisoner when the
[50:36] Holy Spirit forbids you from doing
[50:38] something now I know the children have
[50:40] done that I know if some of my children
[50:41] told me this week when your flesh your
[50:43] flesh wants that take something your
[50:46] flesh wants to steal something right
[50:48] children or your flesh wants to say
[50:51] something but when you stop for that you
[50:55] become a prisoner to the Holy Spirit
[50:57] amen you want to lie you want to steal
[51:01] or you want to do something you
[51:02] shouldn't do when you stop from doing
[51:05] that and you actually obey the Holy
[51:07] Spirit now you know what it's like to be
[51:09] a prisoner a man God has kept you from
[51:12] leaving the protection of his word God's
[51:15] kept you from going out sinning and he's
[51:17] kept you in his divine presence he's
[51:19] kept you in His perfect will and now you
[51:21] know what it feels like oh I'm a
[51:23] prisoner to Jesus I don't even want to
[51:25] do what Jesus wants me to do hey man
[51:28] holiday oh yeah glory not sure and
[51:32] that's how you can experience it now
[51:35] you're not making decisions about who
[51:37] can come to church and and who can take
[51:39] communion and you're not making
[51:41] decisions about who to pray for maybe
[51:43] all the time or who to help financially
[51:45] or should you go should you travel to
[51:47] this place or that place but you can
[51:51] experience it in those ways with
[51:53] overcoming the flesh does that help
[51:55] children can you understand that when
[51:57] you turn down sin and you obey the word
[51:58] of God now you know what it's like to be
[52:01] a prisoner to Christ amen now brother
[52:05] have said this is one time Paul was a
[52:07] prisoner verse 5 and so were the
[52:10] churches established in the faith and
[52:11] increase in number daily now when
[52:13] they've gone throughout Phrygia which is
[52:16] west turkey and the region of Galatia
[52:19] which was east turkey and were four
[52:24] the Holy Ghost to preach the word in
[52:26] Asia which is further east so they were
[52:30] traveling west because the Holy Spirit
[52:33] said don't go east so they kept going
[52:36] they were in Galatia which was there in
[52:39] central Turkey and then free Gio was
[52:42] further west now look at verse seven
[52:46] after they were come to my show West
[52:49] Turkey so they kept coming west
[52:51] so from Galatia to Phrygia to my Xia
[52:54] they assay to go into by finial which
[52:57] was I'm sorry further west now notice
[53:01] the next part but the spirit suffered
[53:03] them not now by thinny I'm sorry by
[53:06] tenia was north Turkey so Church don't
[53:09] you want to be that sensitive that
[53:11] you're so sensitive to the Holy Spirit
[53:13] you know which direction to go amen
[53:16] so the Holy Spirit said don't go east
[53:19] and don't go north go west and that's
[53:23] how sensitive we want to be as
[53:25] Christians that will only go where God
[53:28] has called us to go and it might be
[53:31] something as simple as this you know
[53:32] we've had numerous people that have left
[53:35] the church that used to go to special
[53:36] meetings and different places and just
[53:38] going all over the place and and and I
[53:42] saw it was like a detriment to their
[53:44] their their spiritual growth and their
[53:47] attitude toward our church it kind of
[53:49] you know when they got to go to other
[53:50] churches that made them not enjoy our
[53:52] church so much and so see I wonder if
[53:55] that was a leadership with the Holy
[53:57] Spirit I wonder if they're following the
[53:59] actual leadership of the Holy Spirit and
[54:01] I thought because you know brother
[54:04] Branham says your home church is your
[54:06] post of duty and you just don't you know
[54:08] just don't go well I'll just go - I feel
[54:10] like go to other churches won't be nice
[54:12] to visit that church be nice to visit
[54:14] so-and-so that might seem nice but in
[54:17] reality we've got to have a leading of
[54:20] the Holy Spirit we've got to be a
[54:22] prisoner unto Christ amen
[54:25] and he was such a prisoner he knew the
[54:29] Holy Spirit said don't go east and don't
[54:31] go north I'm going west yeah under your
[54:37] verse 8
[54:39] see that the holy spirit said don't go
[54:42] north the Holy Spirit said go west verse
[54:46] 9 I'm sorry verse 8 and they passing by
[54:49] meisje came down to choice which was
[54:51] even further west Turkey and a vision
[54:54] appeared to paw in the night and there's
[54:57] a man of Macedonia which was across a
[55:00] body of water and even further west
[55:03] which is near Greece so they're in
[55:06] Turkey and Paul sees a vision of a man
[55:08] that's in Macedonia which is a huge trip
[55:11] further west and the man prayed and said
[55:15] come over into Macedonian help us and
[55:17] after he'd seen the vision immediately
[55:19] he endeavoured to go into Macedonia
[55:21] surely gathering that the Lord had
[55:23] called for us to preach the gospel to
[55:25] them amen
[55:26] aren't you glad that God will give you
[55:28] dreams to direct you amen
[55:31] aren't you glad God will speak through
[55:33] preachers right to you
[55:35] God will use whatever method necessary
[55:38] in order to speak to you so Paul took
[55:41] this vision took this dream he said mine
[55:44] the Holy Spirit said no north no East
[55:47] I'm going west and then I have a dream
[55:50] of something the West saying come West
[55:51] and then so he says yes I'm following
[55:55] the leadership of Lord see the Lord will
[55:57] give you many different vindications
[55:59] right when you want to know God's will
[56:01] sure and you've got to say God give me
[56:03] two or three witnesses amen can I just
[56:06] tell a good testimony remember we talked
[56:08] about Hospital Simon was remember
[56:10] children are brothers Simon paid some
[56:12] money to get some people out of prison
[56:15] the this last week last couple weeks
[56:18] brother Simon paid some of his own money
[56:19] now he's entirely right now so you can't
[56:21] hear me preaching this I'm not I'm not
[56:23] preaching it to get his approval but it
[56:25] was a great testimony but a Simon paid a
[56:27] lot of money to get some people out of
[56:29] prison out of his own pocket he said I
[56:31] just felt let the Lord do that I said
[56:32] praise the Lord two weeks later somebody
[56:35] from another Church just felt led to the
[56:38] Lord they didn't know about it they felt
[56:39] letter Lord to send him a check
[56:41] for a lot of money and it fully covered
[56:43] all the money that he paid and this
[56:46] person has never sent him one set in his
[56:48] entire life and most taemin was
[56:51] rejoicing telling me that
[56:52] Simoni on the phone and he was saying I
[56:55] was led to the Lord to get those people
[56:57] out of prison he sacrificed his own
[57:00] money and got these people out of prison
[57:02] and then some pastor that never sent him
[57:05] any money before in the mail sent him
[57:07] all this money plus more to cover all
[57:09] the money that he paid to get them out
[57:10] of there
[57:11] amen a church that's a prisoner to the
[57:14] Lord Hey
[57:15] because there's getting the prisoners
[57:17] out of jail amen so they can serve Jesus
[57:19] Christ I just heard that testimony today
[57:22] so it's fresh on my heart that's what I
[57:24] want to share it with you if God leads
[57:26] you to do something God's going to give
[57:27] you numerous witnesses and then when you
[57:29] act on it God will bless you to do that
[57:32] because see you obeyed him you were a
[57:34] prisoner to him now the second example
[57:38] is in acts 16 Lydia verse 18 and but the
[57:42] RAM shows how Paul was again a prisoner
[57:47] but madam said this little
[57:49] fortune-teller one day Paul knowed he
[57:51] had power to cast the devil off the girl
[57:53] but he could only do it as God willed it
[57:55] day after day she found him crying out
[57:58] after him but one day the spirit gave
[58:00] him permission then he rebuked her the
[58:02] spear that was in her he know what it
[58:04] was to be a prisoner now this is real
[58:07] maturity right here verse 8
[58:09] I'm sorry verse 16 Lydia 16 16 okay now
[58:15] that's the that's the woman with the
[58:17] spirit verse 17 the same followed Paul
[58:19] and us and cried saying these men are
[58:21] servants of the Most High God which
[58:23] showed unto us the way of salvation
[58:24] verse 18 and this did she many days now
[58:28] that's what brother day I'm showing why
[58:30] didn't Paul just cast the demon off for
[58:32] the first day it's because he was
[58:35] waiting on God to do it but Paul being
[58:39] grieved turned and said to the spirit I
[58:41] command thee in the name of Jesus Christ
[58:42] to come out of her and he came out the
[58:45] same hour hey man
[58:47] so bono said and see he had to be a
[58:50] prisoner he had to wait until God told
[58:53] him to do it praise God now brother him
[58:58] said the same thing about Moses now he
[59:00] jumped into Moses but man said Moses was
[59:03] a complete prisoner in the
[59:05] chains of God's Word he was bound up
[59:08] only to thus sayeth the Lord amen
[59:12] hallelujah programs and Moses had to
[59:15] lose his intellectuals in order to find
[59:19] Christ to be a prisoner and when God got
[59:21] all the world beat out of him and all
[59:24] the mighty man that he was and stand the
[59:26] friends of that pillar of fire that day
[59:27] he was found just speechless didn't even
[59:30] couldn't even talk he said God had a
[59:33] prisoner then Amen I lead our church now
[59:36] you and I will be prisoners of Christ
[59:39] when we feel like we have nothing to say
[59:41] we only want to say what God wants us to
[59:43] say for children you'll be a prisoner
[59:46] when you only talk to your brothers and
[59:48] sisters as what would be the Word of God
[59:50] you won't you wouldn't tease your
[59:52] brothers and sisters right you wouldn't
[59:54] say anything ridiculous what but you're
[59:56] a prisoner when you only want to say
[59:58] pleasing things in the sight of God
[1:00:00] praise God so Moses was finally a
[1:00:05] prisoner when he said Lord I can't talk
[1:00:07] what about my stuttering see he was
[1:00:09] finally a prisoner and God said I'll
[1:00:12] speak for you
[1:00:13] he said Aaron will be your prophet and
[1:00:15] you'll be God to Pharaoh ha ha ha Amen
[1:00:18] hallelujah praise the Lord but I said oh
[1:00:22] if God can get him some prisoners like
[1:00:25] that that's when he can express the
[1:00:28] preeminence as you see he's got the man
[1:00:30] of the persons that he knows nothing but
[1:00:32] Christ amen
[1:00:35] Superman now reviews the first two
[1:00:38] purposes of God's mystery first to
[1:00:41] express himself completely God in Christ
[1:00:43] second to have preeminence 'as in his
[1:00:47] church which is his body the bride till
[1:00:49] he can have the preeminence to express
[1:00:51] himself through them and now third
[1:00:54] restore the kingdom back to Eden
[1:00:57] conditions so first has expressed
[1:01:00] himself in Jesus Christ second have
[1:01:02] preeminence in them in this bride the
[1:01:04] church and third bring everything back
[1:01:07] to eating conditions praise God that's
[1:01:10] right now I
[1:01:14] get here to this thought here okay I'm
[1:01:17] almost there
[1:01:19] now brother handbrakes to this thought
[1:01:21] about the Trinity
[1:01:22] what about have said therefore if any
[1:01:25] Trinitarian would just let yourself
[1:01:26] loose for a minute you can see the
[1:01:28] Father Son Holy Ghost is not three gods
[1:01:31] it's just three attributes of the same
[1:01:34] God its expression father he was wanted
[1:01:38] to be a father he was a father he was a
[1:01:40] son and he's the Holy Ghost and the
[1:01:43] father and the Holy Ghost is the same
[1:01:44] spirit don't you see it he said don't
[1:01:46] you get it not three gods the devil has
[1:01:49] told you them things to make an idolatry
[1:01:51] out of you
[1:01:52] amen see it's God expressed in three
[1:01:56] attributes to me Father
[1:01:57] to be Savior to be son to be healer is
[1:02:00] his expressions God expressed sin Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ who has both father son Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:02:10] now brother have says all that God was
[1:02:13] he poured into the Christ and all that
[1:02:16] was Christ he poured into the church the
[1:02:19] believers now he goes back to his first
[1:02:25] purpose let's read this here what's his
[1:02:27] first purpose now express himself as a
[1:02:30] son see that in him might draw the
[1:02:32] fullness of the Godhead bodily see all
[1:02:36] through the scripture that was his
[1:02:37] purpose then through the life of his son
[1:02:40] his cross the blood it says here of his
[1:02:43] cross that he might reconcile to himself
[1:02:46] a ride which is Eve ii ii they meant huh
[1:02:51] me know that were ii Eve the first Eve
[1:02:54] fell right but the second Eve won't fall
[1:02:58] praise God
[1:02:59] amen because her Adam won't be slothful
[1:03:02] the first Adam brother Graham said was
[1:03:05] slothful but the second Adam won't be
[1:03:07] because the second Adam is Jesus Christ
[1:03:09] amen that's right
[1:03:13] he says in God given a type like he gave
[1:03:15] Moses the same thing you didn't Adam and
[1:03:18] Eve and that those Christ and the bride
[1:03:20] he's the second Adam and the church is
[1:03:23] the second II but as long as the second
[1:03:25] Eve compromises against the
[1:03:27] isn't she doing the same thing the first
[1:03:29] evening so right that's why that's what
[1:03:32] the nominal churches are doing they're
[1:03:33] compromising on the word they'll they'll
[1:03:36] say anything like I had somebody emailed
[1:03:38] me this week and said said well you know
[1:03:40] I was we were emailing about women and
[1:03:42] preachers and they said well brother
[1:03:43] Jesse you know you know she said really
[1:03:47] nicely she said well you know some
[1:03:48] people have women preachers some don't
[1:03:50] and she said we just leave this up to
[1:03:52] the father and then the father will tell
[1:03:54] us what to do and I haven't written back
[1:03:57] yet because I'm at the time but I'm you
[1:03:59] know but I did write back to the people
[1:04:01] that voice of God so the voice of God
[1:04:03] people emailed me back and said we don't
[1:04:04] want to argue about it and I said well
[1:04:06] I'm not arguing about it I said I was
[1:04:08] just trying to start a discussion a nice
[1:04:10] discussion I said because it's dangerous
[1:04:13] to make brother branham every word he
[1:04:15] said thus saith the Lord I said that's
[1:04:17] idolatry
[1:04:18] brother Graham called it tommyrot and
[1:04:21] one of the most awfulest things that you
[1:04:23] can possibly do to see Christians we
[1:04:26] can't make excuses like well we don't
[1:04:28] want to argue but see that's an excuse
[1:04:32] to people I don't want to argue either
[1:04:34] but it's an excuse people are hiding
[1:04:36] behind the excuse if I don't want to
[1:04:38] argue what's hiding behind that is I
[1:04:40] don't want to admit that I'm wrong and
[1:04:43] that's what that woman did that's where
[1:04:45] I believe the other voice of God emails
[1:04:47] are doing they're hiding behind the
[1:04:48] excuse well we'll just pray about it and
[1:04:50] see what God says well we know what God
[1:04:53] says about women preachers God don't
[1:04:54] allow it and we know what the Bible says
[1:04:57] there's no one infallible except Jesus
[1:04:59] Christ amen but see they'll hide behind
[1:05:02] these things but we'll just pray about
[1:05:03] it or we don't want to argue what
[1:05:05] they're saying is they're scared to look
[1:05:07] at the truth
[1:05:08] but if they're born again they would
[1:05:10] know that though the Bible says the Holy
[1:05:12] Ghost leads you into all truth amen so
[1:05:14] you have to wonder what's the truth all
[1:05:16] women preachers or what's the truth on
[1:05:17] his every word brother Ram said thus
[1:05:19] saith the Lord
[1:05:20] you know if they'll wonder about it
[1:05:21] because the Bible said God will tell you
[1:05:23] all the truth hey man that's exactly
[1:05:26] right
[1:05:27] see but churches will compromise well
[1:05:30] they can have more time so they can have
[1:05:32] more members if they let women preach or
[1:05:34] they can have more money if they say
[1:05:36] every word brother Adam said was thus
[1:05:38] saith the Lord see they compromise
[1:05:40] on things like that and that's why our
[1:05:43] church is probably very small tonight
[1:05:44] it's because we don't want to compromise
[1:05:46] on anything we just want to keep all the
[1:05:49] work of God that's right I believe that
[1:05:53] now huh me know the Bible says the cross
[1:05:56] reconciled you to god it was the cross
[1:06:00] that brought you back to God let's go to
[1:06:02] Ephesians to Lydia verse 16 so in God's
[1:06:10] first purpose his son Jesus Christ
[1:06:13] he reconciled you back he bought you
[1:06:17] back amen hallelujah that he might
[1:06:21] reconcile both under God in one body by
[1:06:24] the cross let's say by the Cross ready
[1:06:26] by the cross the only way you can feel
[1:06:29] like a part of God the only way you feel
[1:06:32] like you can have peace with God is
[1:06:33] through the cross of Jesus Christ that's
[1:06:36] why I'm going to keep preaching that all
[1:06:38] the days that God will allow me to
[1:06:39] preach I'm going to keep reaching the
[1:06:42] cross and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:44] because it's only through the cross that
[1:06:47] you have peace with God it's only
[1:06:49] through the cross that you'll feel the
[1:06:50] love of God it's only through the cross
[1:06:52] that you'll know you're a child of God
[1:06:55] amen the only way is to remember that
[1:06:59] old rugged cross haha thank the Lord
[1:07:03] brother and said that was God's first
[1:07:05] purpose to manifest himself in Jesus
[1:07:09] Christ to reconcile all of us unto Him
[1:07:13] praise God now program said he goes to
[1:07:20] this thought he said old now let's get
[1:07:22] to the closing thought here I'll try to
[1:07:23] close in the next 20 minutes or so
[1:07:28] better have said God has purpose that he
[1:07:31] hid the mystery from the eyes of the
[1:07:33] wise and the prudent and revealed it to
[1:07:36] the predestinated babes who were
[1:07:38] predestinated to receive it but RAM said
[1:07:42] that's the reason watch down through the
[1:07:44] age when the light hits some they turn
[1:07:46] away and it flashed away he said the
[1:07:49] great intellectuals and then priest
[1:07:51] standing there there was rabbis and
[1:07:53] great teachers
[1:07:54] authority like the different ones like
[1:07:55] Nicodemus was brother Ben preached on
[1:07:58] Sunday which is so beautiful and
[1:07:59] Nicodemus and them and the man polish
[1:08:02] and scholarship and he couldn't even
[1:08:04] understand it so the Bible says that God
[1:08:08] hid it from the Sanhedrin God hid it
[1:08:12] from them because they didn't want to
[1:08:14] see it they wouldn't believe it anyway
[1:08:16] in other words they wouldn't obey it
[1:08:18] that's right
[1:08:21] only the predestinated would believe the
[1:08:24] Word of God now I want to read to me
[1:08:28] what so far has been the most powerful
[1:08:30] quote in this sermon so far to me
[1:08:33] because it's helped me to understand
[1:08:35] predestination better so let me read
[1:08:42] this quote he says oh oh the great
[1:08:45] revelation now now to restore back his
[1:08:48] kinship or his children to bring them
[1:08:51] back now he had to let them get lost you
[1:08:54] understand it he had to let them sin put
[1:08:57] them on free more agency now here's the
[1:09:00] here's the statement right here God
[1:09:02] could not make them sin and remain God
[1:09:05] and then punished them for something he
[1:09:10] made them do all right so the words God
[1:09:16] cannot make someone sin God has not ever
[1:09:20] made anyone sin because if he has then
[1:09:24] he's going to punish them for something
[1:09:26] he made them do alright this means sin
[1:09:31] is a choice praise God
[1:09:34] and then this means salvation is a
[1:09:37] choice now to me church this brings a
[1:09:40] huge and necessary imbalance on
[1:09:43] predestination because a lot of times
[1:09:46] you know we hear so much about chosen
[1:09:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:50] chosen before the foundation world God
[1:09:52] chose me God chose me but church it's a
[1:09:55] balance it's a balance if God just chose
[1:10:00] you and didn't choose your neighbor
[1:10:02] right our neighbors that don't believe
[1:10:03] in God
[1:10:04] we have neighbors I invited them to over
[1:10:06] but they don't believe in God
[1:10:08] if God chose our house and not their
[1:10:11] house then God and God made them God
[1:10:15] made that choice that God's gonna punish
[1:10:17] them and send them to hell because he
[1:10:19] made them that way do you understand
[1:10:22] what I'm saying I wish I had the
[1:10:24] education to do it although I've got a
[1:10:26] master's degree but I said I don't have
[1:10:28] the education to do it because maybe my
[1:10:30] degree wasn't in public speaking or
[1:10:32] something like that so our neighbors
[1:10:35] that don't believe in other words God
[1:10:37] can't punish them and send them to hell
[1:10:40] if he made them go to hell
[1:10:44] so see what am I saying
[1:10:46] I'm saying this God could only
[1:10:48] predestinate by by looking and
[1:10:52] foreseeing what you would decide in
[1:10:56] other words God didn't make you choose
[1:10:58] him and God didn't make the sinner
[1:11:02] reject him are you with me now to me
[1:11:06] Church this brings the balance of
[1:11:08] predestination so many times it's I felt
[1:11:11] like many times I've heard a preach it's
[1:11:13] like well you didn't have a choice you
[1:11:14] didn't have a choice no it's all about
[1:11:17] choice are you with me it is all about
[1:11:20] choice predestination is all about your
[1:11:23] choice if it's not then God's going to
[1:11:26] punish people that he made to sin and
[1:11:29] that's not fair that's not just are you
[1:11:33] with me predestination is all about your
[1:11:37] choice right now amen hallelujah God
[1:11:44] cannot make the sinner sin and remain
[1:11:47] God and then punish them for something
[1:11:49] he made them do it's all about choice I
[1:11:55] know Jesus said you know I have you've
[1:11:58] not chosen me I've chosen you that's
[1:11:59] true but he chose based upon your what
[1:12:04] what he knew for knew your decision if
[1:12:07] not that he's choosing you just because
[1:12:09] he likes you better than the sinner and
[1:12:11] then God becomes a respecter of persons
[1:12:14] but how many no he's not
[1:12:16] God is not a respecter of persons and
[1:12:19] the
[1:12:20] Apple says after I read it to you again
[1:12:21] if you forgot it but the Bible said God
[1:12:24] would that all men be saved let me know
[1:12:29] that God would that all men be saved so
[1:12:35] this is the thought was so powerful when
[1:12:36] I heard I said oh praise the Lord this
[1:12:39] brings us the balance of predestination
[1:12:41] now why is this so important I'll tell
[1:12:43] you why because it makes your behavior
[1:12:46] tonight so important in other words
[1:12:50] whatever you choose tonight whatever you
[1:12:53] choose tomorrow God already knew you
[1:12:56] we're gonna prove it your choices in
[1:12:59] other words prove what you are Amen
[1:13:01] hallelujah you can't just say well God
[1:13:04] made me do this God made me backslider
[1:13:06] or God made me love sin no he didn't
[1:13:08] he gave everybody a fair chance and what
[1:13:11] you choose and if you overcome or not
[1:13:14] proves that God foresaw and you know he
[1:13:18] know you'd made that choice before the
[1:13:20] foundation of the world
[1:13:24] hallelujah so it's it makes this is why
[1:13:30] the balance on predestination is so
[1:13:32] important because it doesn't allow
[1:13:35] people to say well if I'm if I was meant
[1:13:38] to be in the rapture I guess I'll just
[1:13:39] go in the rapture it doesn't let you say
[1:13:41] that well if I was ordained to be bride
[1:13:44] I guess I God will make me bride and
[1:13:46] what are you doing they're just making
[1:13:47] excuse to be lazy instead of doing what
[1:13:51] the Bible says give diligence give all
[1:13:54] diligence to make your calling and
[1:13:56] election sure or amen
[1:13:59] see people in America don't want to be
[1:14:02] told you need to pray more or you need
[1:14:03] to read your Bible more or you need to
[1:14:05] come to church more they don't want to
[1:14:07] be told that but that's really what the
[1:14:09] Bible's saying if you are the elect of
[1:14:12] God then make it sure prove it to
[1:14:14] everybody show which side you're on
[1:14:16] amen let your faith not be dead but let
[1:14:20] your faith make your works glorify God
[1:14:23] because faith without works is dead
[1:14:26] anyone who says well I believe the
[1:14:28] message but doesn't live the life and
[1:14:30] isn't following more love of Jesus they
[1:14:32] don't believe the message
[1:14:34] because their works their lack of work
[1:14:37] shows that their faith is dead Amen
[1:14:39] hallelujah praise God amen
[1:14:45] that's nothing but the truth and
[1:14:48] children you're seeing it with some
[1:14:51] things that happen today people that
[1:14:53] choose to walk away from the word are
[1:14:56] just manifesting what God foresaw before
[1:15:00] the foundation of the world God is not
[1:15:03] ever going to lead anyone into sin God
[1:15:06] like Balaam he'll let you sin if you
[1:15:08] under sin but God is not going to lead
[1:15:10] you there praise the Lord
[1:15:14] see this is the balance God does not
[1:15:20] punish sinners for something he makes
[1:15:23] them knew you'd be unjust God does not
[1:15:28] make anybody sinned now look what the
[1:15:34] Bible says here let's go to 1st Peter 1
[1:15:36] to Lydia first Peter 1:2 I've preached
[1:15:39] this over and over again over the years
[1:15:40] but I want to bring it to your attention
[1:15:41] again this is completely scriptural how
[1:15:48] many are elect elect means chosen how
[1:15:49] many are elect chosen you're elect
[1:15:52] according to what the foreknowledge of
[1:15:54] God the Father so the reason God has
[1:15:57] elected us to receive the message is
[1:15:59] because God's foreknowledge knew we
[1:16:02] would receive it praise God it's not God
[1:16:07] saying well I liked Naomi's family and
[1:16:10] the Smith family I like them but I don't
[1:16:12] like their neighbors I just hate them no
[1:16:15] that's that's not what it was God is
[1:16:18] loving heart he looked out at Akron in
[1:16:20] 2018 he thought who who would love me
[1:16:22] and he realized okay these people will
[1:16:24] love me so those are going to be my
[1:16:26] elect and because I know that I can
[1:16:28] orchestrate the events of their lives to
[1:16:30] receive the message to have a home
[1:16:32] church to glorify the Lord to obey more
[1:16:34] of the word of the Lord to manifest my
[1:16:36] presence to express myself what does a
[1:16:39] Christian look like in 2018 God will
[1:16:41] orchestrate all the events of our lives
[1:16:43] to show the world in Akron what a
[1:16:45] Christian looks like in 2018 amen
[1:16:48] hallelujah praise God but God wanted
[1:16:50] everybody to do that he wanted everybody
[1:16:55] to manifest the word but he knew he
[1:16:58] foreknew who would and who would not
[1:17:02] that's exactly right
[1:17:08] now here's a quote from other random
[1:17:11] when God I'm sorry but when he put man
[1:17:14] on partnership with him let's say that
[1:17:16] can we all say partnership partnership
[1:17:17] other man have said God put man on
[1:17:20] partner we're partners with him that
[1:17:22] means we have something to do remember
[1:17:25] that quote brother Branham says God is
[1:17:26] not gonna push you through a pike
[1:17:28] remember that quote children from years
[1:17:30] ago I haven't preached it for a while
[1:17:32] but I said God is not gonna push you
[1:17:34] through a pipe and then say hey you
[1:17:35] overcame because it was all God God just
[1:17:42] pushed you through
[1:17:42] oh you're an overcomer what God does is
[1:17:46] God but man said God wants us to receive
[1:17:48] the power of God to sit and let that
[1:17:50] power of God in us move us and direct us
[1:17:54] but we've got to make the decision to do
[1:17:56] it God's not gonna force us to be
[1:18:00] Christians because God's not the God of
[1:18:02] force God but Satan is the god of force
[1:18:05] Satan tries to force people to do things
[1:18:07] but God is not that God is gentle got a
[1:18:09] sweet got his kind got his patient God
[1:18:11] is loving God is long-suffering but he's
[1:18:14] not gonna force you to serve him he
[1:18:16] wants you to submit and when you submit
[1:18:18] then he'll take control praise God
[1:18:19] because you asked him to take control
[1:18:22] hallelujah that's why not pushing us
[1:18:26] through a pipe like God's forcing us
[1:18:28] through well I guess I'll believe the
[1:18:30] message I guess I'll go to church God
[1:18:31] didn't have to push you to go to church
[1:18:33] tonight yeah you wanted to come to
[1:18:35] church because you surrendered so many
[1:18:37] years ago you surrender said I want to
[1:18:39] go to church now I'm I took the Holy
[1:18:40] Spirit to lead you and help you to
[1:18:42] crucify your flesh but all those years
[1:18:44] ago when you surrendered God took
[1:18:46] control and God saw your choice and God
[1:18:49] honored your choice and now God is
[1:18:51] helping you keep your choice Amen
[1:18:53] hallelujah
[1:18:57] he put me
[1:18:58] in partnership with him then let the man
[1:19:01] act as a free more agency the same thing
[1:19:04] he's got you on today but Manston see
[1:19:07] you act any way you want to you're a
[1:19:10] free agent
[1:19:12] so therefore if he put the first like
[1:19:14] that he has to put the second like that
[1:19:16] he has to put everyone like that or he
[1:19:17] acted wrong in the first place
[1:19:19] see but everybody is on that same basis
[1:19:21] all right and the church says Lydia
[1:19:26] first Timothy 2:4 I'm gonna prove it to
[1:19:27] you
[1:19:28] God wants all men to be saved who will
[1:19:36] have all men to be saved and come to the
[1:19:39] knowledge of the truth did God want
[1:19:41] Judas saved or not yes God wanted you to
[1:19:45] save but did Judas want to be saved
[1:19:47] no Judas chose money over Christ he
[1:19:52] would rather have money rather serve
[1:19:53] money than serve Christ
[1:19:56] Lydia second Peter 3:9 this one says it
[1:19:58] even more plain God doesn't want anyone
[1:20:03] to perish God's not God's not like a
[1:20:08] Potter saying oil
[1:20:09] I'll make this Judas pot and I can't
[1:20:11] wait to burn this God is not would you
[1:20:14] do that if you had the power to make
[1:20:16] ceramic clay would you make something
[1:20:18] just so you can say oh I can't wait to
[1:20:20] break this it would do that if you're
[1:20:25] not like that
[1:20:26] how much more God's not like that the
[1:20:30] Lord is not slack concerning his promise
[1:20:31] as some men count slackness but is
[1:20:33] long-suffering to us-ward listen Church
[1:20:35] not willing that any God doesn't want
[1:20:40] anyone to perish but that all should
[1:20:43] come - that was a sermon from Sunday
[1:20:45] morning God wants everybody God doesn't
[1:20:51] want that God didn't see Judas God
[1:20:53] didn't want to hate he saw but God had
[1:20:56] to hate he saw because he foreknew what
[1:20:58] he was going to choose he foreknew it
[1:21:01] but God was not willing he God didn't
[1:21:04] want to work out that way but because of
[1:21:06] God's foreknowledge he had to do that go
[1:21:10] to Ezekiel 33 11
[1:21:16] now is it this has struck me right now
[1:21:18] the Holy Spirit just struck this thought
[1:21:19] to me look what the Bible says
[1:21:21] Ezekiel 33 11 Biggio 33 11 saying to
[1:21:33] them as I live saith the Lord God I have
[1:21:36] no pleasure in the death of the wicked
[1:21:41] but that the wicked turn from his way
[1:21:45] and live turn the attorney from your
[1:21:47] evil ways for why will you die o house
[1:21:50] of Israel do you need help spelling it
[1:21:52] hunt okay alright ever look up there if
[1:21:55] you get I have no pleasure God thus
[1:21:57] saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the
[1:21:59] death of the wicked God did not say oh
[1:22:01] I'm really happy that Judas just hang
[1:22:02] himself I'm really happy about that
[1:22:07] God was not saying I'm really glad
[1:22:09] Pharaoh drowned in the in the sea God
[1:22:13] did it because he was fair and just and
[1:22:15] he gave judgment but God does not
[1:22:18] delight in that did he believe the Bible
[1:22:21] yeah God has no pleasure but you know
[1:22:27] what it just struck me about the Holy
[1:22:28] Spirit go to Isaiah 53 the Bible said it
[1:22:32] pleased the Lord to bruise him in that
[1:22:34] striking God wasn't pleased when the
[1:22:38] wicked died but God was pleased when
[1:22:40] Jesus died
[1:22:43] amen now that's divine love right there
[1:22:45] church as to my love it pleased the
[1:22:49] father to bruise him let's go to Isaiah
[1:22:51] 53 I just struck me there amen now
[1:22:54] that's to me that is a fresh
[1:22:55] understanding right there a fresh
[1:22:57] revelation verse 10 isaiah 53:10 you got
[1:23:06] it
[1:23:06] yeah that pleased the Lord to bruise him
[1:23:08] so it did not pleased God to see Judas
[1:23:12] commit suicide that did not please him
[1:23:15] but it did pleased him when Jesus Christ
[1:23:18] gave his life for all the sinners amen
[1:23:22] praise the Lord
[1:23:27] give me ten more minutes here so a
[1:23:32] church I hope you can see that we are on
[1:23:34] partnership with God God is not forcing
[1:23:37] you to be a Christian and I'm not gonna
[1:23:40] force my children either I mean I want
[1:23:42] them to be Christians but they've got to
[1:23:43] make the choice they've got to serve God
[1:23:46] when they get old enough the children
[1:23:48] can walk out just like we've seen other
[1:23:49] people walk out hey that's your choice
[1:23:52] God's not gonna force you to do it but I
[1:23:55] recommend with all my heart children
[1:23:57] give God make him your first choice amen
[1:24:00] serve God with all your heart save
[1:24:02] yourself from evil and sin and heartache
[1:24:05] and scars and regret and living with a
[1:24:08] broken heart save yourself from that and
[1:24:10] live holy unto God in other words live a
[1:24:13] happy life
[1:24:14] praise God right remember we saw that
[1:24:16] happy is the man who what loves pleasure
[1:24:21] or fears the Lord fears the Lord look at
[1:24:24] Austin Church or children look at Austin
[1:24:26] look how look how sad he was remember
[1:24:28] when I was sad he was he wasn't fearing
[1:24:31] the Lord now look look at us what should
[1:24:33] we do we should fear the Lord and you'll
[1:24:35] be happy if you fear the Lord amen look
[1:24:39] at Benjamin look at these ones we differ
[1:24:40] I'm not calling names on purpose but
[1:24:42] just that's coming to me look how look
[1:24:45] how they're not happy but if you fear
[1:24:47] God you'll be happy Hey amen
[1:24:50] but God's not gonna force you God God's
[1:24:54] not gonna force anybody because he's on
[1:24:57] partnership in other words man you've
[1:24:59] got a choice to make
[1:25:00] daughter you got a choice to make I'm
[1:25:02] not gonna force you to serve me but
[1:25:04] because I know what you've chosen I can
[1:25:06] mold and predestinate I can shape and I
[1:25:08] can plan and the Bible said God says I
[1:25:11] know the plans that I have for you amen
[1:25:13] these are good plans plans the prosper
[1:25:15] playing it plans to bless you well I
[1:25:18] didn't know that because he knew that
[1:25:19] Israel would seek God with all their
[1:25:22] hearts amen hallelujah since that I know
[1:25:24] the plans I have for you in Jeremiah 33
[1:25:27] they're good plans plans of peace and
[1:25:30] plans of joy amen but he can't plan
[1:25:33] without partnership you've got a partner
[1:25:36] with him you got a place you got to
[1:25:38] shake God's hand you got
[1:25:39] partner yes Lord I will serve you
[1:25:41] yesterday I agree
[1:25:42] I'll give you all my all my life
[1:25:44] children I hope you do that the youngest
[1:25:46] age I'll give you give God all my life
[1:25:49] I'm gonna be happy giving God my whole
[1:25:50] life and say it was just wants to kill
[1:25:53] me I don't want to give anything to say
[1:25:54] it I want to give all the days of my
[1:25:55] life to Jesus Christ amen
[1:26:01] now program says this the Bible said
[1:26:04] gifts and callings are without
[1:26:05] repentance it's something that God by
[1:26:08] Sovereign Grace put into the church God
[1:26:10] does that himself it's in work and an
[1:26:12] act of God and by for knowledge he
[1:26:14] predestinate these things to happen see
[1:26:16] by foreknowledge because he has
[1:26:19] foreknowledge he can predetermine events
[1:26:23] now here's Beltran now as I say God is
[1:26:26] not willing that any one should perish
[1:26:28] but in the very beginning God knew who
[1:26:31] would be saved and who would perish for
[1:26:33] knowledge let him know that if he's the
[1:26:36] infinite God he's not willing that any
[1:26:39] should perish but he knew from the
[1:26:42] beginning he knew every fly flee every
[1:26:45] person that would ever be on the earth
[1:26:46] he knew them before the foundation of
[1:26:48] world because he's uh because he's
[1:26:50] infinite amen so can everyone understand
[1:26:53] that brother man I'm saying God is not
[1:26:56] forcing anybody be saved but he has
[1:26:58] foreknowledge of who's going to be saved
[1:27:02] alright now let me find this next one
[1:27:06] here this is mark of the beast 1961 and
[1:27:10] if he's infinite he knowed all things
[1:27:13] from the beginning and so therefore he
[1:27:15] could elect not because he wanted to but
[1:27:18] because his foreknowledge let him know
[1:27:20] who would be and who would not be an
[1:27:23] even heaven
[1:27:24] hallelujah did you catch that let me
[1:27:28] read it again
[1:27:35] let me make
[1:27:36] this year God could elect not because he
[1:27:41] wanted to but because as for now let's
[1:27:44] let him know who would and who would not
[1:27:46] be does that help
[1:27:49] God did not choose and say well I like
[1:27:51] brother so-and-so
[1:27:53] I like sister so-and-so I don't like
[1:27:55] them so much so I'm gonna choose them
[1:27:57] and not them go dad said God did not
[1:28:01] choose based upon what he wanted
[1:28:03] God chose based upon who he knew would
[1:28:07] choose him I hope that helps somebody
[1:28:12] and what it does as I said earlier what
[1:28:15] it does is it magnifies your choice
[1:28:17] tonight it magnifies the choice that
[1:28:21] you're gonna make tomorrow about serving
[1:28:23] God God is not going to force you but
[1:28:28] the choices you make tonight the choices
[1:28:29] you make the choices Lord willing if God
[1:28:32] tells you make next year in 2019 the
[1:28:34] choices you make are just going to
[1:28:36] reveal what God already saw before the
[1:28:39] foundation of the world God's not
[1:28:42] choosing because oh I want this person I
[1:28:44] like their hairstyle or like I like
[1:28:46] their broad shoulders or like I like
[1:28:47] that woman's smile you know I like that
[1:28:50] more than the other woman no he's not
[1:28:53] choosing because he wants to he's
[1:28:55] choosing based upon what he for knows
[1:28:57] you're gonna choose that's right he said
[1:29:05] Jesus came by the foreknowledge of God
[1:29:07] that knowing that Jesus came to redeem
[1:29:10] to buy back the church but the preachers
[1:29:12] like going to the pond and throwing the
[1:29:15] net and pulling it in the kingdom of God
[1:29:18] is like an ax man that take a net and
[1:29:19] went to the seashore when he pulled in
[1:29:21] he had water spiders snakes serpent
[1:29:23] frogs and everything else but he had to
[1:29:28] fish amen so preachers we don't we just
[1:29:31] throw the net out and whoever comes
[1:29:33] comes God knows what's in the net amen
[1:29:36] huh me know that parable that's the
[1:29:38] seventh and final parable that Jesus
[1:29:40] told the seventh parable is the dragnet
[1:29:42] the Bible says that they throw out the
[1:29:45] net they pull it in and then the angels
[1:29:47] on the shore are separating the differ
[1:29:50] kind some get burned and some get kept
[1:29:53] the Angels know many times we don't know
[1:29:56] right but the Angels the Bible says will
[1:30:00] separate just like the wheat and tares
[1:30:02] members said Jesus says let them both go
[1:30:04] together until harvest lest you uproot
[1:30:07] the tares with the wheat or the wheat
[1:30:10] with the tears rather same thing God's
[1:30:13] gonna let both grow together and God
[1:30:16] will determine God will show and prove
[1:30:19] who is on which side I'm gonna be on the
[1:30:21] Lord's side hallelujah alright now let
[1:30:40] me read him one more quote here because
[1:30:41] I'm finishing up y'all watch oh this is
[1:30:44] 1961 Abraham and his seed after him
[1:30:49] jesus said no man could come to the
[1:30:51] Father except my father draws him and
[1:30:53] all the father's give me will come
[1:30:54] that's the reason you just preach the
[1:30:56] gospel it's plainness yet the elected
[1:30:58] sheep of God would hear that and catch
[1:31:00] it real quick and they'll believe the
[1:31:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost where others
[1:31:04] will walk away and make fun of it
[1:31:06] because they were elected to hear it
[1:31:07] that's all see so you see now why the
[1:31:10] church itself is an elected and
[1:31:12] predestinated by God now he says this he
[1:31:18] says he said the preet he said the word
[1:31:22] predestination isn't good for the people
[1:31:24] so here's what he says now to us church
[1:31:27] it doesn't stumble us I hope I hope the
[1:31:29] word predestinate doesn't stumble you
[1:31:30] because you've got you you've got the
[1:31:33] word god predestinate after he for knows
[1:31:36] so because god foreknows then he
[1:31:39] predestinate not the other way around
[1:31:43] but rancidity better if we use it like
[1:31:46] this that it was bye for now as God by
[1:31:48] his foreknowledge could predestinate to
[1:31:51] his own glory now here's our man
[1:31:56] says God didn't say now I'm gonna choose
[1:31:58] you but I'm gonna send you to hell and
[1:32:00] I'm gonna choose you and send you to
[1:32:02] hell brother said that wasn't God's idea
[1:32:05] amen hallelujah that was not God's idea
[1:32:10] well I'm gonna choose Jesse but I'm
[1:32:12] gonna send his neighbor to hell because
[1:32:13] I like Jesse and I don't like the
[1:32:14] neighbor that was not God's idea he said
[1:32:19] that wasn't God's idea he wanted all of
[1:32:21] us to come to heaven but being God he
[1:32:24] foreknew who would come and who would
[1:32:26] not come
[1:32:27] he said that clears up Romans 9 with
[1:32:30] Jacob and Esau God knew Jacob would want
[1:32:33] to wrestle with the angel and he would
[1:32:35] want to walk differently amen hallelujah
[1:32:38] God also for knew that Esau we want to
[1:32:41] marry different women right and Esau
[1:32:43] would want to make his parents mad and
[1:32:46] marry us a sinner outside of the faith
[1:32:49] God foreknew that and so God could
[1:32:52] predestinate based upon those things
[1:32:54] that he knew in the harvest time 1964
[1:33:01] brother Branham says this he says God
[1:33:03] being omniscient knowing all things that
[1:33:04] he can be present everywhere because
[1:33:07] that's the way he predestination us by
[1:33:09] foreknowledge not because he desired
[1:33:12] that this person should be saving this
[1:33:13] one should be lost but he knew who would
[1:33:16] be lost and who would be saved
[1:33:18] Amen hallelujah amen
[1:33:22] thank you Lord the church this is why it
[1:33:25] makes me so so thankful that we keep
[1:33:28] choosing God over and over again as the
[1:33:31] years go by we should not choose the
[1:33:33] back side on God and give God less we
[1:33:36] should choose to give God more because
[1:33:39] whatever we choose will prove what God
[1:33:42] knew about us before the foundation of
[1:33:44] the world God doesn't like I said God
[1:33:48] doesn't want to see God doesn't want to
[1:33:51] see our church save more than he does
[1:33:53] the Pentecostal church does everyone
[1:33:56] understand it's not that God loves us
[1:33:59] more than the Catholic Church down the
[1:34:02] street that's not it
[1:34:04] God didn't choose it like that God
[1:34:09] based upon who would want to really live
[1:34:11] the truth who would want to know a real
[1:34:13] living God amen
[1:34:15] who would really want to believe the
[1:34:16] Bible who would want to know the truth
[1:34:18] of the word of God and God knew who
[1:34:21] would want that and so then God
[1:34:22] delivered the truth to them God
[1:34:24] delivered the truth to you ha ha ha hey
[1:34:28] man praise God in that beautiful church
[1:34:33] now that's beautiful let's say into our
[1:34:35] feet here then I'll just close with that
[1:34:38] God predestinate sus by foreknowledge
[1:34:42] not because he desired that this person
[1:34:44] should be saved or this one should be
[1:34:46] lost but he knew who would be lost and
[1:34:49] who would be saved I'm gonna stop right
[1:34:52] there Lord willing next time maybe
[1:34:55] Sunday we'll see what the Lord has for
[1:34:56] us or just way the way I feel led but
[1:34:59] lord willing on Sunday I want to really
[1:35:03] preach that thought about I want to
[1:35:10] preach about the thought where you came
[1:35:11] from you came from the mind of God and
[1:35:16] brother Branham said but let me just
[1:35:18] give you a little preview so that huh
[1:35:20] this will help stir up your minds and as
[1:35:22] you listen to brother Branham these next
[1:35:23] few days maybe you'll catch something
[1:35:26] brother Branham said the the doctrine of
[1:35:30] the pre-existence of souls was wrong how
[1:35:32] many know that brother have said the
[1:35:36] Mormon doctrine they believe that your
[1:35:38] soul pre-existed like as a separate body
[1:35:41] before you came to earth brother man
[1:35:43] said that's wrong brother man also said
[1:35:47] it was wrong that so after you die your
[1:35:50] souls go to sleep and you're just you're
[1:35:52] just your soul just stays than the grave
[1:35:55] so brother I'm cleared up both both
[1:35:58] false doctrines the one about before
[1:36:00] this life and the one after your life
[1:36:02] amen
[1:36:02] hallelujah he cleared up the before and
[1:36:05] the after
[1:36:06] praise God so what are you trying to say
[1:36:10] brother yes I'm trying to say this you
[1:36:12] did not exist as a person before you
[1:36:14] were in this life you existed in the
[1:36:17] mind of God you were a thought of God
[1:36:20] and that thought was expressed herein
[1:36:23] the 18 crazy or whenever you came on the
[1:36:25] scene right or Genevieve OHS 2018 for me
[1:36:29] it was 1980 2004 2006 2009 when you come
[1:36:36] on the scene
[1:36:38] you were not and I know this will go
[1:36:41] against some people's doctrine well I
[1:36:44] better not get there but I just better
[1:36:47] wait on that but Church you you were in
[1:36:49] the mind of God brother Ram said you
[1:36:51] went from a thought to a flesh body now
[1:36:54] after this should go to theophany and
[1:36:56] then glorified body her brother have
[1:36:58] said Jesus was thought theophany flesh
[1:37:02] then glorified body amen so I just want
[1:37:08] to lay that in there because this all
[1:37:09] ties in together with predestination you
[1:37:13] were in the thoughts of God and God
[1:37:15] manifested you on this on this earth at
[1:37:19] this time now come now hope tonight
[1:37:26] Church that wasn't too deep or anything
[1:37:27] like that
[1:37:28] I'm just had a burden you know to preach
[1:37:33] the truth about predestination I think
[1:37:34] many times it's it's misrepresented like
[1:37:38] they put it all on God like well God
[1:37:41] just he just he just called me to be
[1:37:44] this way I guess I always be this way
[1:37:46] because God called me to be this way who
[1:37:50] was I talking to this week I'm starting
[1:37:52] to somebody this week and they told me
[1:37:53] that their that's what their their
[1:37:54] friend who knows the message that's what
[1:37:56] they say well I guess how if God wants
[1:37:58] me to go in the rapture I'll go in the
[1:38:00] rapture and that's the wrong attitude
[1:38:04] the Bible says whosoever wants to drink
[1:38:07] a living water let him come and drink I
[1:38:10] don't know yeah amen and what is the
[1:38:13] living water the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:14] Ghost and what is the baptism of the
[1:38:16] Holy Ghost
[1:38:16] it's the token for the rapture amen so
[1:38:19] God's inviting everybody to come and
[1:38:22] drink of the Living Waters God's
[1:38:23] inviting everybody the rapture and only
[1:38:25] those that want to go are the ones that
[1:38:27] are gonna go amen there's not going to
[1:38:31] be one person left behind that really
[1:38:33] wants to go in the rapture
[1:38:36] because all that wanna go can go praise
[1:38:40] the Lord
[1:38:41] how many want to go in the rapture huh
[1:38:44] then you make the choice tonight and say
[1:38:46] Lord I'll lay everything aside let me
[1:38:49] just be a prisoner to do the will of God
[1:38:51] so I can go in the rapture praise the
[1:38:53] Lord let's just pray together father in
[1:38:56] heaven we thank you for your word
[1:38:57] tonight Lord God or I trusted in and go
[1:39:01] too high over the heads or hope it
[1:39:04] wasn't too simple Lord God and it just
[1:39:07] was it moving enough Florida I hope it
[1:39:10] stirred the people's hearts Lord so that
[1:39:13] they can see their partnership with you
[1:39:15] God you didn't choose us because you
[1:39:20] liked us more or you want us to go to
[1:39:22] heaven but you want to send
[1:39:24] denominations to hell that's not what
[1:39:26] you did Lord God you don't rejoice when
[1:39:30] anyone's alone as we saw from the
[1:39:32] scripture you're not willing that any
[1:39:39] should perish can go to hell yet
[1:39:41] millions and billions do go to hell
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:51] you didn't say I'm going to choose you
[1:39:54] Lord in fact what you did you said I'm
[1:39:57] gonna see who would choose me amen amen
[1:40:02] thank you Jesus thank you Lord I'm so
[1:40:06] glad Lord I chose you father you're so
[1:40:12] glad Lord I chose you Lord those many
[1:40:15] years ago what an amazing choice Lord
[1:40:22] God what a eternal choice it was Lord
[1:40:26] you wanted to partner with me and you
[1:40:31] would ordained it that the gospel would
[1:40:33] come to me and each one of us and you
[1:40:37] knew that I'd received the Lord Lord
[1:40:43] thank you Lord for letting us choose you
[1:40:45] dear God hallelujah
[1:40:55] lord help us to really see this truth
[1:40:58] Lord God Lord as I said that it will
[1:41:01] motivate us to be diligent not be lazy
[1:41:05] lukewarm Christians nor because those
[1:41:09] are the kind you spew out of your mouth
[1:41:11] a half-hearted message believer makes
[1:41:15] you want to throw up Lord it makes you
[1:41:17] sick someone that will choose you
[1:41:23] sometimes but not every time some
[1:41:26] services but not every service some days
[1:41:29] but not every day it just makes you sick
[1:41:31] or we don't want to make you sick we
[1:41:33] want to make you rejoice we want to make
[1:41:36] you happy Lord God we want to please
[1:41:39] your Shepards heart we want to please
[1:41:42] your husband's heart by choosing you
[1:41:46] every day we're done thank you Lord as
[1:41:53] Joshua told the people as he died was
[1:41:55] getting close to dying off the scene he
[1:41:57] said choose you this day whom you will
[1:41:59] serve
[1:42:02] Elisha said the same thing choose which
[1:42:05] side you're gonna be on who's on the
[1:42:06] Lord's side or it's a choice and if you
[1:42:12] knew we'd make that choice more than you
[1:42:14] would ordained and predestinated
[1:42:15] everything Lord to work out for your
[1:42:20] glory if you do not delight in people
[1:42:24] parachute you do not make a vessel just
[1:42:27] to destroy it and get pleasure you do
[1:42:33] not force people to worship you as your
[1:42:36] Provost said Lord if we raise our hands
[1:42:38] we break all the gravity laws that's
[1:42:39] holding our hands down we did it
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:43] because we have a partnership with you
[1:42:46] we have something we can do we can get
[1:42:49] on our knees we can choose to crucify
[1:42:51] the flesh mortify the deeds of the flesh
[1:42:55] and bring these bodies in this objection
[1:43:00] that's something we can do Lord God and
[1:43:05] the Lord it's because that one day many
[1:43:08] years ago we said we surrender fully we
[1:43:11] want to be a prisoner take control I
[1:43:15] make Jesus Christ my choice Lord you've
[1:43:19] been faithful to lead us and guide us
[1:43:22] ever since we made that choice for God

[1:43:29] our prayers and helping us to be
[1:43:31] overcomers you're not pushing us through
[1:43:35] this Lord God where it's you're forcing
[1:43:37] us but Lord we're allowing you to do it
[1:43:40] because we love you we trust you
[1:43:41] you're our Creator you're our God our
[1:43:43] husband you're the lover of our souls
[1:43:50] thank you lord help us to make the
[1:43:53] choice tonight I must make the choice
[1:43:55] every day to serve you Lord God and to
[1:44:01] be a prisoner for Jesus Christ but I
[1:44:04] pray for everyone here I don't have to
[1:44:05] ask them to raise their hands tonight
[1:44:06] but Lord for all those who want to be
[1:44:08] prisoners I pray you help with more God
[1:44:10] if they don't want to be lord I just
[1:44:12] pray that they feel ashamed themselves
[1:44:15] they want to be a prisoner Lord God and

[1:44:21] Christians Lord God
