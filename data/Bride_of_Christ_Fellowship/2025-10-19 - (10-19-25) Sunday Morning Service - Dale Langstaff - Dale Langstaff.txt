========================================

And I said, you know, I have to have that brother minister for us. Amen. And uh but God knows everything. Amen. And we just love him. Amen. We're just a a small church in the same area. I'm very comfortable. Amen. Here. Amen. We started in a house with our family and one couple. Amen. And and God bless us with a church building and we might be 40 or 50 now. 50 if we were really full. and and uh Amen. God's not in numbers, he's in character. Amen. Every place God preached was character. Amen. God preached in the houses. Amen. In the New Testament. Amen. And we just love him for that. Amen. And we we're uh we're parents of six children, six grandchildren, some on the way. Half over half our children are married. And and so life goes by fast. Amen. Amen. But we love him and and we're just privileged to to get the greatest thrill you'll have outside of salvation is get to meet the rest of the body of Christ here. Here here because we're going to be over there for all of eternity. Amen. And if you get to meet your brothers and sisters here, you're greatly blessed. That's the greatest one of the greatest blessings of going to the mission field. Get to meet the brothers and sisters that you'll spend all of eternity &gt;&gt; with. Amen. Get to meet them. Let's stand as we read the word of God. It's just a great privilege. We had amazing fellowship with you, pastor. We're going to turn to Revelations 1:1. Amen. We're going to read one scripture out of Revelations and one out of Job. The revelation of the Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass. and he signified it by his angel unto his servant John. And let's turn over to Job 1 and6. Amen. By God's grace, we're going to talk about Job some today. And if God don't change it, we're going to talk about David this afternoon. Amen. Job 1:6. And now and there there was a day when the sons of God came in the presence themselves before the Lord and Satan was amongst them. Lord Jesus, we pray that you'll come and Lord, we're we're here to serve you and to bless your bride. Lord God, there's no other motive in our heart. And Lord, we pray that you will bless and encourage the pastor and this local assembly. And Lord, may we grow in a relationship that will last for all of eternity. For we know that we were always together in you, Lord God. And this is just a reuniting on this earth until we meet again on the other side, Lord God. And so I pray that you will be blessed and we welcome you and this beautiful place, Lord God. We welcome your Holy Spirit. Take complete control of everything that's said and done, Lord God. And may you bless your bride here. Not be with the home church back home and bless them, Lord Jesus. also as junior ministers to them and be with your bride around the world. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I want to just share something with you. You know our prophet said that Satan can imitate every gift of God. He can imitate every manifestations of God. And Satan also believes the word &gt;&gt; and trembles. But Satan can't do one thing and that's love. That's the only thing Satan cannot do. So if you want to see the manifestations of God in a believer's life, can they love? &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that Satan can't do. Satan loves this. Sorry. Satan understands and believes this message but trembles at it. He can't believe it &gt;&gt; but he can't love. Amen. And we want to look into this. You know, you know, Brother Bram said that the greatest thing that Satan hates is revelation. And you need to understand where who you are. You need to understand your placing. We're going to talk about placing an election this morning. And if you ever come to who you are in Christ, you you're going to not only lose your mind, but you'll leave this place. Amen. Because of what God sees in yourself, the bride. Amen. And and so sat the greatest thing that Satan hates. Here the prophet says the true revelation of the true church, that's what she stands on. And she can do the greater works. And Satan is trying to do everything he can to hide it from you. He's showing you badger skin. He's showing you flesh. The prophet said, "Don't look at the clay. Look at the message. Look at the spirit and the message." The clay will fail all the time. &gt;&gt; But look at the spirit. Look at the message. Amen. And so Satan's trying to get us to stumble because we see the badger skin here. The prophet said in just laying a foundation, he said, "I've always said you don't know who you are. A man is sitting beside you is the son of God." Amen. The woman sitting beside you is the daughter of God. And if you recognize when you come into this fellowship that you are going to meet Jehovah sitting on your pew this morning, I wonder if you would have dressed differently. I wonder if you would have came on time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wonder if we would act different if we catch the revelation in our day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's sitting beside you and we're sitting in heavenly places &gt;&gt; right now. We don't have to wait till we get to the millennium. &gt;&gt; We're already in those places in Christ Jesus. You know, it takes the same power to believe in faith as it does fear because they're both on scene. &gt;&gt; But what you choose will identify who you are. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That we look in this scripture here and this amazing part that we see in Job that the sons of God came before the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; and Satan came there with them. &gt;&gt; Now that that that's amazing and peculiar to me. That's actually twice in Job. It's actually in the second chapter also. And here we see you know the story of Job here where God Satan came and he said, "Well, have you ever considered my bride here?" in this area. Have you ever considered my servant Job? And he said, "Oh my God, God, you're not playing fair. &gt;&gt; These children came out of you. They're controlled by you. You built a hedge about them. You've given them their Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But if you'd ever let me get in their inner part, I would tear him apart." &gt;&gt; And God says, "Okay." Can you imagine the confidence God had in Job? Imagine the confidence God has in his &gt;&gt; bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God, you know the story, God sent all these uh discouragements to Job and took everything he had and and all these things. Amen. And Job had some friends. Now, with friends like that, you wouldn't need many enemies. &gt;&gt; But you know, they came to uh you know, so many people, you know, I want to show you something here. You know, when the woman was caught in the very act of adultery and they brought her to Christ, the believers there, the Pharisees were looking at her faults and they said, "The very Bible that we're reading requires you to stone her." &gt;&gt; But Jesus was looking at election. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he was looking at election when he looked at me. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was looking at election. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we see these friends came of Job and they were condemning Job and their wrath was kindled against Job because Job in their in their eyes was was was making himself self-righteous. And they said, "Oh, you've had to have sinned. You've had to have fall because there's no way that God would choose and give you this plate to the bride. There's no way." They never understood God. Amen. &gt;&gt; They never understood him at all. And even his wife said, "You should curse God and die." And Job said, "You speak like a foolish woman." And all these people, you know, there's many voices today. We're living in a world that's just rather voices. &gt;&gt; Be careful with those voices. &gt;&gt; Be very careful. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look who look who is behind those voices. Look who was behind technology. &gt;&gt; Those voices. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was Satan. that most technology is to make the bride fall. &gt;&gt; Even our prophet said television, God could have used it for great glory, but Satan took it and twisted it &gt;&gt; and much more today. Oh boy, that's the internet. But to be so careful, but we see God let the church, he let Job's friends have their say. And then let's turn to Job 38 here. Everybody's had their opinion of the bride of Christ. Everybody's had their opinion of the church. Everybody's been looking at you and say, "Who is worried about this little bride here gathered today? Why they're so so insignificant? God, let everybody have their say." And then God came on the scene in Job 38. And let's just read that a few verses here. 1-6. And the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind. And said, "Who is this that darkened counsel by words without knowledge?" &gt;&gt; God had a very low opinion of Job's friends. Gird up now your loins like a man. This is God. Make this personal this morning. Gird up your loins as a man. I'm trying to place you where you belong. For I will, here's God demanding of Job. He said, now I will demand of you and answer thou ye me. Where's thou when I laid the foundation of the world? God's demanding that answer of Job. And I want to tell you this morning, God's demanding that of every one of us. He said, "Declare it unto me if thou has understanding. Who hast laid the foundations thereof, if thou knowest, and who has stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations there on facet? Here God was demanding of Job, who are you? &gt;&gt; I believe this morning that God's demanding of us, who are you? You need to recognize who you are. And when you recognize your position in Christ, Satan will have absolutely zero zero power over you. &gt;&gt; If you don't think so, how much power does Satan have over God? None. If you recognize where you came from, see, we're not we're not worshiping as a church this morning. Even though we're gathered as a fellowship, and we're not in a denomination, &gt;&gt; but we're in a family. &gt;&gt; And in a family, everyone's related. &gt;&gt; Spiritually, we're related. &gt;&gt; Me and your pastor, we were together before the foundation of the world. We were together with you before. You say, "But I don't remember." But God says, "I'm declaring of you." &gt;&gt; Where were you? Watch what our prophet says about this. He says, "One of the saddest and most illegitimate things that was ever created." And the most ungodly thing is a mule. He don't know where he come from. He don't know who his daddy is, his father. He don't know. He'll wait his whole life to kick you. That's what the prophet says. &gt;&gt; But they are great workers. If you want to have soup suppers, basketball team and a volleyball team and a baseball team, they're great workers. If you want to have programs and agendas, oh, they'll build churches, put gold on the steeple. &gt;&gt; They'll give everything they got because they know how to work, &gt;&gt; but they don't know where they came from. &gt;&gt; They don't know who their daddy is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then there's something else. Is a son or daughter of God who's living a million miles below the recognized privileges &gt;&gt; because they're in a cage at the zoo like the eagle that the prophet went with his family. And he said he was born a heavenly bird. He was born to be in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But because of men. Watch that church. But because of men, there is no fear in love. &gt;&gt; This ain't a law that we're worshiping. We're worshiping a person &gt;&gt; of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; This ain't about dues and the letter kleth, but the spirit give life. This is a body. This is a person. This is a family. This is a relationship. This is my husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A zoo where you're locked up in a cage and you were made to be a heavenly bird. And here he said, "Sons and daughters of God that live below their privileges is the worst thing you'll ever see. Sons and daughters of God walk in the streets. They're born to soar in the heavenlies. They're born to be in the side. They're born for the great pleasure and power of God, &gt;&gt; but they're confined and in torment. A man of God that's living below his privileges, his soul is bound in a cage, tormented by Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. We We don't want to We don't want to be in that. Freedom is everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Freedom is everything. I mean, freedom in the flesh is everything. But think about the soul. &gt;&gt; It's freedom, &gt;&gt; man. We want our churches, we want our families free that God can move. The footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Watch this. He said, "Now I'll be with here." He says he gave a great blessing and promise to the church that I'll be with you and even in you to the end of the age and whatsoever you bind on earth I'll bind in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth I'll loose in heaven you know the power in belief only believe the angel of the Lord loved that song only believe you know he's already paid the price for it All you have to do is take it. &gt;&gt; We, you know, you know, begging is, you know, we we portray this this God sometimes as we go to prayer and we beg you to heal me. Beg? That's not the God I serve. He's already healed me. &gt;&gt; I don't have to beg him. He's already given it to me. He said, "Just take it. It's already there." He said to to Moses, "Speak. Go forward. Why are you crying to me? I've already given to I've already placed you in authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet said that deity does not abide alone and just in heaven but it's walking in the bride that's adopted and recognizes place. But you have to know your beginning to know your end. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it's amazing when you recognize. Take the promises and believe them. So we see here in Genesis 1:26 and this is hands down my favorite scripture that when God said he said let us make man in our image. Now here in the beginning I was in God and I was a part of God and God God was was so considerate of his himself. He was omnipotent. He was all these things that he's asking me for permission to make me separate from him. God said let us who was the us. God was a self-existing one. Before there was God was only God because of worship. So before there was God was he was a self-existing spirit. &gt;&gt; So here's the spirit say let us. But who's he talking to? There's nobody around. He was talking to you and he was talking to me. He said let us make man in in our image and let him have dominion over the sea and the fowls of the air and the cattle and over all the fish of the sea. Uh, sorry. And all the earth and over every creeping thing on the earth. And God created man in his own image. That was you, brother and sister. Amen. If you're eternal this morning, if you're going to live in heaven, if you're going to have eternal life, you always were eternal. Anything that has no end never had a beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to recognize your place. You know, it will almost get I don't mean in a way of arrogancy, but you know, you you don't have to. It's a It's knowing who you are. You're confident in your stand. Amen. So, God created man in his image. Now, this is a key part. I want to just step out of this. Forgive me, pastor. You know, if I if I happen to say something off of what your pastor, he has full authority. Amen. Your pastor, Brother Bram said, your pastor is ordained of God to lead you through. And he also said the pastor holds a doctrine for the church. I'm not here to fight your pastor. Not at all. But here, watch this. I want you to see this. He said, "And the image of God created he him." &gt;&gt; This is important. Very important. Male and female created he them. &gt;&gt; I want to just show you something and we're going to finish on this by God's grace. And we get there. We're going to get there. It's the best part. But I want to show you something that some people have taught in the message which is disgusting to me. And I I I I believe that we're of the same spirit with your pastor. But sisters, I want to show you something. You are no different than a brother &gt;&gt; in the image of God. &gt;&gt; You have a different calling &gt;&gt; or placing. But when Christ hung on the cross, it took exactly the same blood to forgive the sisters as it did the brothers. and you came out of the exact same spot of God that the brothers came out of. &gt;&gt; So it's impossible for a Holy Ghost fililled brother to treat a sister as second class. &gt;&gt; That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; That'd be like That would be like treating God second class. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The feminine spirit came out of God. &gt;&gt; And God blessed them. &gt;&gt; I could never cook like my wife. And she's not supposed to preach, but she can preach to her children. &gt;&gt; Different places. &gt;&gt; See, know we need to know our place. But God's no respector of person. Sisters are not going to be in a lower spot in heaven. You know, my prophet said, I love this. You know, yeah, I want to show you something. The prophet said, "When we get to the millennium, you'll be with your wife." And he says, this exact quote from memory. I memorized the good ones. He said, "If you get the wrong wife here, you'll have the right one there because all wrongs are made right in the millennium. &gt;&gt; My wife is my rip. Amen. &gt;&gt; To tell me that my wife wouldn't be in the millennium, I'd say I wouldn't even want to be there myself because see, she came from God also. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; We're not running a racist campaign against sisters and brothers. &gt;&gt; We are the children of God made in the image of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's only one type of eternal life and that life came from God. And if anything had a beginning, then it has an end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if you're believing that you're coming to church and you've accepted this glorious revelation of this message for our day and you're going to you're planning and expecting and believing that you're going to heaven. You're going to have eternal life. I want to tell you something. You never had a beginning. &gt;&gt; You never had a beginning. You need to understand this. You are not going to get to heaven by per chance. &gt;&gt; You There's not a piece of the bride that's going to get in by the skin of their teeth. &gt;&gt; I will be there. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; Because God will not be complete without you. &gt;&gt; He would still have a hole in his heart and his side because we come out of the heart of God. He would not be complete without you. So you don't have to worry about what Satan's telling you. Remember, remember the woman that was caught in the act? God was looking at election, &gt;&gt; but the believers, the broader was looking at her imperfections. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, this is, you know, who was the accuser of the brethren in the Bible? How come he comes to church? It's a It's a brethren that he Well, I couldn't do that. My church wouldn't do that. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Notice those who have tonight eternal life. This is prophet laying this down was with him and was in him. This is who is this mazedc. This is right before he died 65. and was in him and in his thinking and before there was even an angel or a star or cherubim or anything else that's eternal. If you have eternal life, you always was. &gt;&gt; Now, I not I'm not preaching that you would be arrogant. But God's not marrying a bride that's all beat up and bandaged up and bruised and walking around like, "Oh, I'm barely I hope God don't keep me. Amen. Amen. I want to look at some characters. This is a very long quote, but I'm just touching on the highlights of this quote. He says, "A real genuine Christian was in him before the foundation of the world. Before the morning stars sang together for joy, the sons of God shouted for joy. I was right there. When God had the thought of making the earth, I was right there. I gave him my advice on how Amen. I was a part of God. I'm still a part of God. But you are too. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're identified in the im the moral realms here 10,000 years before there ever was a world form. I was back there before him. This is our prophet. Now here he starts out. He said, you know, when God called Abraham as a really old man, I was there. I think I was the fingernail when he pointed to Abraham. He said, "Leave your land and go somewhere where I'll show you." I wasn't born yet. So, I was still in God, right? That means I was there when he formed the earth. I wasn't on the earth. So, that I was right there when he said it, "Let there be. I heard his voice." You heard his voice this day. You know how you heard his voice? because you recognize his voice. That's what John says. My sheep know my voice. The sheep that come out of him and another they will not follow. &gt;&gt; This ain't by per chance. &gt;&gt; When Abraham was made and he said, "Go at 75 and Sarah was 65 and I'm going to give you a promise." Shout Isaac, I was there. I was there to see Abraham when his faith wavered not. I was right there. I was with just Joseph when he was rejected of his brothers. They thought he was a goody to choose. He was too good for them and they didn't like this dreamer and this brother that thought that he was something special. The rest of them were carnal. You know, Joseph never picked that life. He was called. You know, prophets are called. They're born. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're born. It's It's not by pretend. You don't go to school to become a minister. You're born with that gift. &gt;&gt; Man, I was there. I was there when Joseph was sold and left for dad and and sold into slavery. I was there when Joseph revealed himself unto his unto his brethren. I was right there. I was there. You know, a type of election was, you know, when the brethren was coming to Joseph in Egypt. And that's so beautiful. Shows how we'll be gone before the tribulation. and his bride was in the castle before he revealed himself to his brethren. But you know, even before that happened, when the brethren were coming, they didn't know who they were seeing. Do you know the one that was kin to him, he left a little gold thing in his bag? That's election. &gt;&gt; Because they were the same blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was with Jacob the night that he wrestled with the angel. Amen. I was right there when that was happening. See, you were there. You have to identify. This is what our prophet said. You have to identify with God &gt;&gt; to recognize your position. We're going to get into that. Your position in Christ. &gt;&gt; I was there. I was with Moses when he thought he would take over Egypt by his own strength. And and when his people turned against him and he fled for his life, I was right there. Will you kill me like you killed the other Egyptian? I was there when God came down in the pillar of fire in the burning bush and said, "Moses, take your shoes off. You're getting the ground dirty." I was there because I was still in God. &gt;&gt; But I declare unto you, where were you? That's what God's asking Job. Where were you when I laid the foundations of the world? See, if you know your beginning, you'll have no problem at the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you you have to know your beginning, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; to understand your end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christians, believers, every believer now is identified in Christ. The same person you must be identified. I was with Elijah in the days of Ahab when they made the choice between God and Balam the false prophet. I was there when he called down fire. I was right there. I was there when they poured the water on the altar and said, "Choose you this day." Who's God? &gt;&gt; I was right there. Amen. Help us, Lord Jesus, to recognize I was with David when he was rejected. You know, I want to just stop here a bit and we're going to talk about David this afternoon, but you know, David was rejected by his brothers. You know, watch watch this. You know, when you're in the the body of Christ, the Bible will show us this. Be careful the emphasis. You know, you need approval from one person. That's Jehovah. If your heart does condemn you not, Amen. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David was rejected by his brethren. You know, when David was just under obedience of his dad and took a sandwich out to see his his brothers that were fighting in the war against the Philistines and Goliath, his brethren said, "What are you doing here showing off?" No. You know what? David wasn't showing off. David recognized who he was &gt;&gt; and he recognized that there was an uncircumcised Philistine that was blaspheing his family. &gt;&gt; He recognized his brothers didn't recognize who he was. Even his daddy, you know, even the prophet, even the prophet, you know, prophets are humans. Yes. &gt;&gt; When he was sent down to the house of Jesse and here the first one come up. He was big and stature and strong and educated and smart and he said, "Well, he had a hund 700 people in his church. A thousand maybe 2,000. Oh, he's he's God's anointed. That's a man of God." Really? And God had tapped the prophet on the shoulder. Samuel, I don't look like you. See? I look at the heart. &gt;&gt; And so, watch this. Watch this. David's own dad through all his brothers and almost to the point of insinuating a lie. Okay, that's it. Well, you mean to tell me there ain't no more? Well, there's just this little scrawny bride. He's out watching a bunch of smelly sheep. Yes, sir. Prophet said, "We will not sit down until you bring this little scr." The Bible says scrawny, runty, no beauty. &gt;&gt; Until you bring them, we won't have peace. See, I was right there. You know, many times in this day, the world's looking at a religious huge show that's become a big business. And they'll look at the bride of Christ and they say, "What's this little elect lady?" Well, she has no real effect on the world. Oh, they don't know where they came from. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was there when the Hebrew children I've experienced this. I shared this to your pastor. I've experienced twice what the Hebrew children went. You know, I they they I want to I want to just slow down here and show you something. The Hebrew children were slaves. And when they had been taken as slaves, the the king in war had took the best believers of the Jewish people, the smartest, the most anointed, the most skilled of all the watch this all the message believers. &gt;&gt; The Jews were the message believers of the day. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the king loved Daniel so much he brought him a seam and you know the whole story and they were jealous and all that. But the king built the our prophet said that the statue was of Daniel &gt;&gt; and it types the worship of the prophet because it typed perfectly our prophet. See Daniel was so trusted by the king. He was sent to a far away province. &gt;&gt; He would have never allowed that worship. &gt;&gt; But he wasn't present. And the king was doing it because he of the honor and dignity and honesty that only comes in a bride, a child of God. &gt;&gt; Daniel was off the scene and they built a statue of him. &gt;&gt; And then the king passed a decree. He said, "When you hear the trumpet blow, fall down and worship the prophet." And what I want to show you something is out of all those message believers, there was only three that had a backbone. &gt;&gt; There was only three. &gt;&gt; Only three. &gt;&gt; And the king was a wroth when he heard of the Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. And you know the story type seven times hotter with types of seven ages and all this thing. The men that threw them in was killed. And do you know that those men never even smelt like fire? &gt;&gt; They did not just burn. They didn't even smell like smoke. &gt;&gt; But watch the dignity that they had. And see I I told you I don't mean this out of arrogancy but when you know who you are you know when I was never affected and and if you are I I'll pray with you but I was never affected by low self-esteem. I had good parents. I never struggled with anything in high school. I knew who I was &gt;&gt; not just in my flesh and my parent but I knew who I was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and and you could offer me anything. And I just &gt;&gt; you need to know who you are &gt;&gt; in Christ. You need to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Religion won't keep you, &gt;&gt; but ownership will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Family will. Ownership will. And they here these three Hebrew children, they gave the king, they said, "We will not even be careful &gt;&gt; when we answer you. Whoa. &gt;&gt; They said, "We know that our God is more than able to deliver us. But if he chooses not to, it makes no difference to us. If God chooses to send me, to call me, to stop me, or go me, makes no difference to me. We'll go down servant &gt;&gt; our God." &gt;&gt; They never even smell it. You know, I was right there. And here, a pagan king that was was was trying to kill God's elect and never seen God before in his life. The Bible says no man has ever seen God at a time. Lived. He looked in that furnace and he said, "I thought we put three, but I count four. I ain't never seen him before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, I ain't never seen you before that I knew of in the flesh, &gt;&gt; but I'm seeing a fourth. And it looks like I'm going somewhere with this. &gt;&gt; You know, when John seen the bride, when John seen Christ and the church age and revelation in the church ages, &gt;&gt; you know who he seen? I'm jumping way ahead. I'll just give you. He's seen you and he's seen me. He says, watch it. I'm going to finish on this scripture. He says, "I see one like unto the son of man, but it wasn't a man." &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham said it was because his bride, his wife, I love that, his wife was in him &gt;&gt; and he was covered as a lady, but it looked like a man. That's that's beautiful. That's Bible. &gt;&gt; That's the message we're getting there. &gt;&gt; Daniel, I was telling you the Hebrew church I was telling them was twice we've had fire on our property that wouldn't burn. Wouldn't burn. And both times the devil testified of it. The firefighters said, "We've never went and seen a fire like this and not burn down everything. Never went to a hay barn that wouldn't burn. I can send pictures of your pastor of the post scarred 8 by8 post like 16 feet high completely charcoal never replace it fire but it wouldn't burn. We come home from church. My kid had wore my oldest son had wore I believe it was my son. You know, the fire was burning right around the tires and the machinery had hay on one side, machinery on the other. And I was telling I said, "Put it out. Put it out." It was it was it was burning on the carpet like the rug. It was it was all straw and hay. And he said, "Dad, I'm in my bare feet." I said, "Put it out. Put it out. Fire that wouldn't burn." &gt;&gt; And then the firefighters leave and they say, "Oh, we don't come to a hay fire. We don't come to a barnfire that don't burn down. &gt;&gt; We don't put people in the fiery furnace that don't burn up. &gt;&gt; You can't burn up theophony. &gt;&gt; You can't burn up theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was with Daniel. I was right there when out of jealousy. Jealousy. They were jealous because Daniel recognized the spirit of God. A pagan king recognized the spirit of God on Daniel. &gt;&gt; You want to tell if you got the spirit of the baptism of the Holy Spirit before you leave this place, a pagan people will recognize when you go to the grocery store or you go to the doughnut shop that there's something I don't know what it is, but when he comes in and pays for his coffee, it just feels different. &gt;&gt; Satan will testify of God's presence. He always did in the Bible. Sometimes it took him a while, but he always did. You know, when they came to Jesus, they said, "We know you're a man sent from God, &gt;&gt; but we're not worshiping you. It's the same as today." Oh, they won't do it publicly. They They'll come at night. Do &gt;&gt; you know I have people in the world that will watch my services, but they would never show up because they know there's something there that they don't have. &gt;&gt; But it's like when they sin online, they'll watch it in their corner and they say, "I don't want none of the other believers in my church." Because, you know, like the blind man in the Bible, I I wasn't born with that kind of fear. when the blind man Jesus healed the blind man and he went to his parents and the church people were disgusted and they and and the parents feared because they'd be kicked out of the synagogue. &gt;&gt; I said, "God never gave me that kind of fear." &gt;&gt; He went back to the blind man. He said, "Well," and and he said, "You know, you're supposed to be the spiritual leaders of the day." And he said, "All I know is that that I was blind yesterday. Today I'm I can see." And whether he's Amen. I was with Daniel. You know the prophet said what kept the lions off of Daniel was love. You know what God is? Love. You know what? All in every example that the prophet gave of the evidence of the Holy Spirit, it was love. &gt;&gt; He said it different ways, &gt;&gt; but it was always love. &gt;&gt; The definition of God is love. He loves so loved the world that he came. Love. Brother Bram's first example of the bapt evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost was love. His second one was that you would believe the revealed word for the day. In John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. So that was love. And then he said that it was the nature of God would be the evidence of the Holy Spirit and that was love. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to know where you come from, you must be identified with him on Calvary. You know, I was in him when he paid the price for me. I'm identified. If you didn't die with him, the prophet said, then how can you know his life? I died with him on Calvary. It was him that paid the price for sin, but I was in him. And he said, 'Now I am sealed and I'm sitting with him in heavenly places &gt;&gt; and I have all powers over hell to conquer through him. And every Christian believer that sitted the same way because you have to be identified with your Lord the same yesterday, today and forever identified in his ministry. Do you find yourself that way? He said, watch this. He said, "Now I find myself in these last days that many believer Christians identify with his ministries, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. But I find myself in this day identifying." Do you find yourself that way? Believing it, walking with it. Notice that the works he did, the believers will do the exact same. &gt;&gt; Amen. The works that God did, he's still doing today. the exact same works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Identifying identified with them. But what side are you on? Are you just in the present state now? Where would have you been? Would have you been on the side of Christ when these believers were serving them? Or would have you been on the side of Satan? Would you been the one that threw the Hebrew children into the furnace? Or would have you been the fourth man in the furnace? It's what the prophet asks at the end of this quote. Jehovah Gyra 64. He says, "Now, let's take a look at yourself in God's mirror." He said, "Just see where you can identify yourself here tonight, living, if you had been living in Noah's day, the time of the flood, what side would have you been on? &gt;&gt; What have you got in the ark? If you were living in Moses day, what side would even on?" &gt;&gt; I I want to just show you something. Egypt controlled the world. It was no small thing that Moses, not only did it seem like Moses had lost his mind when he said, "I'm going. Where are you going, Moses? I'm going to Egypt. Take over." And he did. And he did. Amen. What side road have you been on? And if you lived in the days of Christ when all the church came against him, watch this. And you had to stand there alone. And all the things he did, the only thing was God and him. The only thing. And even all his disciples nearly walked away from him. But what side if you had have been present in that state? &gt;&gt; Where would have you been? &gt;&gt; Where would you be? What side would you be on &gt;&gt; now? What side are you on right now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know where you come from? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, he said many things here. We have a man here that can turn on the light. He said, "What we need tonight is men and women." I was talking about this, our position. What we need tonight is men and women who know their position in Jesus Christ. You, Here's another one. He says in Christianity versus adultery, he said, "You got to know your position. You got to know your place. That's right. He said, "I know my positions in Christ." Another example quote, "Because I got an inheritance." &gt;&gt; Amen. I have an inheritance, a spiritual inheritance. &gt;&gt; It's eternal life. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that was in Jehovah is in the bride &gt;&gt; because they're a part of him &gt;&gt; because they came out of him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. So, we must recognize our position in the scriptures as believers. You got to recognize your position. The lack of power and the lack of authority in the bride of Christ because you don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I know we can just roll that bride thing off our tongue really perfectly. But you know down in heart. You know down in deep who you are. It's you're a part of the family. &gt;&gt; Nobody can take the blood from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was born a Brandham. So the prophet said it. &gt;&gt; And I'll die a brand. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were born a child of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And nobody can take that from you. It's your birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just wrap this up here and we won't be too long here. We look in Ephesians 2. He said here here go here here he said in Ephesians 2 five he said and let this mind be in you which is also in Christ whom being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; equal with God. I want to show you something this morning. Everything that God's doing today, he's doing through you. You're God's hands. &gt;&gt; You're God's mouth. You're God's eyes. You're God's hearing. Everything God's doing, he's commanding through his five-fold ministry and his bride. &gt;&gt; Everything. You're looking for a big man to come. No, no, no. It's already here. The big man's already here. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit. He's already here. You're looking for a big person. He's already here. Jehovah. &gt;&gt; He's in a many member bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. John 1:3, "Behold, what manner of love is bestowed onto us that we should be called the sons of God? Wherefore the world knoweth us not because he knew him not?" Verse two, beloved, now that we are the sons of God, it does not yet appear. It does Oh, it does not yet appear. Oh boy. Most people don't recognize that at all. It does not yet appear &gt;&gt; what we shall be. But we shall But we know that when he shall appear. Now wait a minute. He's already here. He's already come down in the cloud in our day. That was the deity, the headship, the authority of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; He took the scales off your eyes to show you this is who your husband is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. never before. &gt;&gt; Seal it up, John, because it's not time. But we're here. It's time. That time's passed. &gt;&gt; This day, this scripture is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B said, "It's not just that we're going in a rapture, but we're already in a rapture." A raptures inside of you, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. There will be an actual taking away. &gt;&gt; But people are always guilty of looking. Oh, look at what God did back there. Oh, look at what God's going to do over there. &gt;&gt; But they miss what God's doing today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is here. Now I I want to close on some of this here. This is amazing. He said, now notice the harmony between the father. This is the prophet here speaking in in the permanent church age. He said, "Notice the harmony between God, the father and his son. He never did anything till first he showed him by the father." John 5:19 he says, "A harmony now exists between the groom and his bride &gt;&gt; and she shows him his word and she receives it and she never doubts it and there's nothing that can bring harmony. Even even death can harm her. Even death for it's a seed planted, the water that raise it up." And here's the secret to it that the word is in the bride as it was in Mary. And the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what she wants done with it and she performs it. &gt;&gt; See, you are Christ &gt;&gt; today. What's the definition of Christ? &gt;&gt; Anointed one. &gt;&gt; What is the bride with the Holy Spirit? The anointed one. &gt;&gt; The anointed one is in your presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We get so caught up with the clay. Be careful, it's going to go pass away. &gt;&gt; It's the inner man. God is a spirit. And those that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. The anointed one is present here. &gt;&gt; He said, "I must go away and prepare a place for you, but when I'm gone, I will send back the comforter, the &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in our day and she has thus saith the Lord. You know, I want to show you something here. Many people have this wrong in that, you know, brother Brandham clearly taught us, you know, marriage is a fantastic thing &gt;&gt; because before the foundation of the world, you were one in the beginning &gt;&gt; if you get your soulmate. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, there's times now lately, and I I I love this much more. I I I me and my wife are one. That's just it's just the reality. If she wanted to go and buy a moon, it wouldn't make no difference to me. She wouldn't have to ask me because she knows who I am. &gt;&gt; When I go to the mission field, I was telling them in Africa, I go to the mission field, I don't have to tell my wife to pay the bills. I don't have to sign the checks before I go. &gt;&gt; She don't call me and get permission &gt;&gt; because she is me. You know, look at the woman in the well, the the virtuous woman. She sees a field and she buys it and the the people in the in the gate call her blessed &gt;&gt; and her family honor her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's like it is supposed to be spiritually. &gt;&gt; You have the mind of Christ. You know what God wants done with it. The greatest value is souls. &gt;&gt; How will you get people? you you'll win souls to Christ because they'll want what you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't give them a prophet book. &gt;&gt; Give them something that you got that they don't have a life. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with the book. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; But but maybe they can't read. &gt;&gt; The first Bible. We are written epistles read of all men. &gt;&gt; Don't have to pass out message books. Don't have to go to the grocery store. Pass out Bibles. You are the New Testament walking in the grocery store. When I open the door, the New Testament walks in. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When I go to the tiller, there's Acts and Luke, and I'm &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't insult God by not recognizing who you are. if my children never came to me when they were in need. &gt;&gt; I'd be insulted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you think about our heavenly father? &gt;&gt; You know, if he if you being evil now how to give good gifts to your children, how much him being holy and pure? and &gt;&gt; how to give great things to them that were a part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must know who you are &gt;&gt; positionally placed in Christ. Watch this. Let's finish this out here. He said, "They have thus sayith you have thus sayaith the Lord." And watch this. I want to jump down here. He said he never completed his work in his earthly ministry. &gt;&gt; You're you're looking for what can I do for Christ? I just come here and I'm supporting a pastor and I go to work five days a week and I don't really know where I fit in. Maybe I go here, maybe I go there. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Jesus did not have complete his earthly ministry when he was here. So now he works through the bride. &gt;&gt; So you thought I was making that up. I always like the message because I have a backup plan. I know what the prophet said before I say it. &gt;&gt; He's working through the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And she knows that. But how do you know that if you don't know who you are? But she knows that for it is not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do. But he will know he will now fulfill those through the bride. And he'll do that work that's left for this specific time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this specific time and this specific place. Every single one of you will touch souls that the rest of us in here may never see or never touch. &gt;&gt; For this specific time and for your specific place. &gt;&gt; Don't matter if you're in grade one in school or grade five or at the job site or at your apartment or at work or in the store or in the ministry. at this specific time and at this specific place, the Holy Spirit is working through everyone &gt;&gt; that's his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations 1:1 and I I want to close with this. This is just if this don't make you happy, your wood's wet. Amen. Revelations 11:11 saying, "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last." What seeest thou? Write in a book. And he sent it to the seventh age, the seven churches which are and he names the churches 78. Let's go to verse 12, you know, Asia and Ephesians. He names all the church ages. And he says, "And I turned." Here's John verse 12 of Revelation 11. And I turned and saw a voice that spake unto me. And being turned, I seen seven gold candlesticks. And in the midst of the candlesticks was one like like unto the son of man, clothed in a garment down around his feet. Now, I want to show you the scripture is perfect. Now, if I had more time, I'd go back in Luke and the New Testament and show you. And I could give them to the pastor if he asked me, but there's the garment was girded around his feet and it was girded about the paps. That word in the scripture is breast. It's replied to it multiple times. It's in Revelations 15:6 is one. It's also in Luke because it was the bride of Christ that was right inside of Christ in the church ages. They weren't like together. They were one. Watch what the prophet says. And now, if you'll notice in Revelations 1, we find Jesus standing in the seven church ages and the golden candlesticks. And he turned and he seen one like unto the son of man standing there clothed. And how was it? It was his bride standing there in the candlesticks drawn out. That's in why we are not a denomination. That quote is mentioned 16 times. Brother Brandham also again he said we find here stand in the church a beauty Christ molded into it. Watch this. Christ in the church the bride molded into it. Christ molded. It's Christ. It's not the name of the church. It's Christ. Everything is Christ. &gt;&gt; And the church had a white garment on. And do you notice it was a woman? Wait a minute. That was Christ. That was God. He's a man. The prophet says, "And did you notice that was the mark of the beast?" And he said, "Do you notice it was a woman and about the breast? And the garment was covering over her shame and it had was a golden cord that was pulled around it and it held around the breast white, speaking of the righteousness of Christ." And the golden card represented the go. The golden cord represented the gospel. The preaching of the gospel brings the Holy Spirit over the church. And the righteousness of Christ holds it there and it's tied with the string girded with the string. And then he's standing up and his feet are brass as they had been burned in the furnace. Brass speaks of deity or divine judgment, I'm sorry. And God in this great oath he took and he set Christ and Christ paid the divine payment. You know the Bible says that you were justified because you never did it. Not the real you. &gt;&gt; Oh your flesh did it. &gt;&gt; Oh the the people really have trouble with that in the church. This did it but not Dale. &gt;&gt; Justified as you never did it. Not the real Dale because I'm a lot better looking in my theophony. I'll be 19. Amen. &gt;&gt; Divine judgment. God, sorry. And when the church based this divine judgment, J Christ was standing there. What a beautiful picture standing in the golden candle. Six. Let's just go on to my one more here. And here's the foundation of every good thing. Therefore, he represents it in like unto the son of man, and was clothed in a white hanging over his hair. This is in the permanent uh permanent vision. And Daniel saw him there many hundreds of years, and said he was the ancient of days, one like unto the son of man, coming in power, united in the ancient of days. Judgment is set. Now, watch this. I want this is who you are. And now I want to just ask you something. I'm just speaking to you lukewarm church. There was 10 visions that went out to meet the Lord and five of them were wise and five were foolish. And we took that this morning and crafted into the tree. And now he said remember that. He said they went out to meet God and watch. He said the Bible said that the books were open. Daniel 79 and the books were open in the book of the sinner and another book was open. And here's the prophet says, "And he said, who came with him? Who came with him?" Who? Who? I want to just tell you who that hymn was. Christ Jehovah. &gt;&gt; The church from the rapture. Oh, tens of thousands times thousands came with him ministering with them. Now, I like this part. I just I like this part. It was his wife, the bride. Oh, glory. His wife came with them in the church. His wife. Who are you? Let us make man. Do I have your permission to make you in my image? This is God speaking to prove to a world that there's a Jehovah the same yesterday, today, and forever. Would that be okay with you? I'll send you I'll bring you right back to myself and then we'll be all whole again. and he made them male and female. Great he them. If you continue reading there, it also says that he blessed the men. No, no, says he blessed them. &gt;&gt; I I'm sorry for doing that, but you know, you know what I mean? Don't get God is no respector of person. I am the least of you. I am a sinner saved by amazing grace. &gt;&gt; I'm just a little ant in the pilgrim of God's great economy. You might be a jack rabbit. Amen. Don't underestimate who you are. &gt;&gt; The wife. I want to show you something. I want to close with this. The prophet said, and this is not in my notes. I'm folding this up, that the marriage happens here and we're going over there for a supper. &gt;&gt; Now, some people have trouble with that. And I say, you know, if the marriage happened over there, you might turn down the uniting and God would have to kick you out of heaven. But God already knows who she's marrying &gt;&gt; before you end up there. &gt;&gt; You see, you were a part of him. The bride came out of the rib. Under the heart was the heart of God. The marriage and the two shall be one. It's a beautiful and I speak during a great mystery. Did you catch it? &gt;&gt; A great mystery. &gt;&gt; The world's missed it. But there's a little person. There's little groups around the world like this. &gt;&gt; You know, do you know the spirit of God is the same in every country? &gt;&gt; You know, I've never once I've been in many airports by God's grace. I've never once had to hold up a sign to say who the bride was or hold up my name. I've seen them. I've seen hundreds of signs up. People have never met people come from other countries where I'm looking for this person. I've never had to do that because it's it's a it's a mystery. &gt;&gt; It's just it's an atmosphere. You are a creator &gt;&gt; of your atmosphere. &gt;&gt; The presence around people. Brother Ram said the people that people love to be around is because you have created something supernatural and I speak concerning oh he's done all these marriage things man love his wife and wife should honor and love her husband all the honor but it's but but I speak during a great mystery and church order and doctrine and all this I speak all this but then a great mystery Christ and his church &gt;&gt; to spirit. It's an anointing &gt;&gt; around. I said that in other countries, you know, you could walk in people just like here. You never seen me before, but you did. You just don't remember it. Wasn't exactly in this form. You see what I mean? This is amazing. You are a part of something. A lot bigger than you thought. &gt;&gt; A lot bigger than you thought. &gt;&gt; This is This is a kingdom of Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; He's everything to us. &gt;&gt; He's everything. &gt;&gt; And you know, all around the world, there's little elect ladies. I've been in places, gatherings this small where everything was muddy. Not in the one. It was a tin roof. I preached in some that were straw huts. It was mud. And about the size of this platform was the concrete so you didn't stir up the dust. But it was the exact same. A great mystery. &gt;&gt; Christ and his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to tell you something this morning. He's listened to all these voices and he's coming to Job. He's coming to you. And he said, "I demand of you. Where were you? Where were you? Let me help you remember." And God goes and lays that all out before Job. Amen. God loves you. &gt;&gt; You are his heart. You are the heart of God. He would bankrupt heaven. He would bankrupt everything. You know, no man come to the father except he dro you. you Satan's telling you know you know in Genesis when Adam and Eve fell in the garden he said who told you that you know if you have ever I want I want just like I want to give Satan a black eye you give him black eye we're g turn to if you have ever ever felt the tug of God in your heart and Satan tells you you're not good enough you just you just line Satan up and say you liar you liar &gt;&gt; because There's people on this earth that have never ever ever ever, it's hard for me to comprehend this, ever felt that tug, that just that slightest little tug. You ain't here because you woke up in time. &gt;&gt; And that tug, this what? Now, this is Bible came from Jehovah. And he said he wouldn't lose you &gt;&gt; because all was in his hand. He went, "You can come, pastor. &gt;&gt; You can come, Pastor Ch." It's amazing. This is not a religion. This is a family. &gt;&gt; This is a great mystery. And Satan's trying to tell you, "Oh, you might be lost, or you're not worthy, or you're not important, or there's a lot more bigger Jesus than you." No, that's a lie. &gt;&gt; God is no respector of person. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a part of God. You're as equal with God as the biggest most important person you will walk before kings and priests and deities around the world. &gt;&gt; And declare unto him that we are not careful what we say unto you. &gt;&gt; Because I know where I came from. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jehovah Gyra. God bless you, Pastor Jesse. God bless you. Amen. God bless you. Cut [Applause]
