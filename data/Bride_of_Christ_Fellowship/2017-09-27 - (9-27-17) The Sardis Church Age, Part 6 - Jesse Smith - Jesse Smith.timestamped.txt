[25:41] the sake of I was the standard tonight
[25:43] let's go to Revelation chapter 3 I like
[25:48] to look at our sixth of the Sardis
[25:49] Church age here I'd read verses five and
[25:51] six revelation 3:5 and 6 we had a
[25:54] wonderful time out up just after have
[25:56] you seen I'll just give a little brief
[25:57] testimony about the meetings out of New
[25:59] York there was a wonderful time anymore
[26:06] Revelation chapter three verses five and
[26:10] six
[26:19] so we'll probably not finish tonight on
[26:21] this artist church age because I'm I
[26:23] just didn't feel like I'd get done but
[26:26] maybe in about two or three more
[26:27] services I want to spend a little bit of
[26:29] time on the book of life by God's grace
[26:32] and then we'll go to the Philadelphia
[26:34] and after Philadelphia I've actually
[26:35] preached all of them but I'll probably
[26:36] do a little review on Laodicea hope
[26:39] you're enjoying it by God's grace I
[26:40] would so enjoy going through this Church
[26:41] age book it's a renewal and I think I'm
[26:43] up to almost page 300 in the book so I
[26:45] haven't read a whole book in a long time
[26:47] so it feels really good
[26:48] to work on that by God's grace
[26:50] revelation 3 verse 4
[26:54] let's read if we can I'm sorry yeah I'm
[26:58] sorry verse 5 I'm sorry did I say 4 I
[27:00] meant 5 thank you verse 5 let's read
[27:03] this one together 1 2 3 he that
[27:06] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[27:09] white raiment and I will not blot out
[27:12] his name out of the book of life but I
[27:15] will confess his name before my father
[27:17] and before his angels let's have a word
[27:20] of Prayer everything on your heart just
[27:22] make it on into God tonight
[27:23] let's pray tonight Heavenly Father Lord
[27:26] we bow our heads Lord to you Heavenly
[27:28] Father we reverence you Lord God or we
[27:32] realize you're the great one among us
[27:33] Lord none of us are great here father
[27:35] we're just trusting in the great one
[27:37] Lord who lives inside of our souls dear
[27:39] God we love you tonight
[27:41] father take this word that we've read
[27:43] bless it to our hearts teach us and
[27:45] train us Lord speak to us here Lord we
[27:47] know wherever anyone comes who's hungry
[27:51] and thirsting for you Lord they shall be
[27:53] filled Lord God it's a promise Lord God
[27:56] we know if we went to our homes tonight
[27:58] and we were hungry there'd be somebody
[28:00] there that could put a meal on the table
[28:03] to feed us but Lord how much more if we
[28:06] come to your house and your table how
[28:08] much more would you feed us your word if
[28:10] we come hungry and thirsty dear God so
[28:13] we come that way tonight speak to our
[28:14] hearts Lord Jesus minister now by your
[28:17] Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ lovely name
[28:19] amen god bless you maybe see you there
[28:22] by God's grace
[28:27] so now Caillou can switch over I do have
[28:28] some quotes here tonight wonderful time
[28:36] we flew out Friday morning I took a
[28:38] personal day off of scores three days I
[28:40] can take for any reason I want so I use
[28:42] one of those reat days to travel and I'm
[28:46] really glad I did because it was just I
[28:47] want to get out there as soon as
[28:49] possible and brother Brooks preached
[28:51] Friday night and there was about a
[28:52] hundred twenty sisters there and they
[28:54] just kind of rented out this resort it
[28:57] was really nice and there's about 20
[28:59] brothers there so it was really nice and
[29:02] my roommate was a the associate pastor
[29:06] at the church in New York he's been an
[29:08] associate pastor almost 16 years so he's
[29:10] in the ministry longer than I have
[29:12] he's about 45 years old a real good
[29:14] brother and then brother Berg's preach
[29:16] Friday night and read a really wonderful
[29:19] time in the Lord
[29:21] the sisters try to stay up as long as
[29:23] they can on those retreats and pray into
[29:25] the night so I I was told they were
[29:26] praying to like one or two in the
[29:28] morning service start at 7:00 so weeding
[29:30] it out to like 10:15 and they kept
[29:33] praying late into the night and then I
[29:34] preached Sunday more Saturday morning I
[29:36] preached on the rapture and the family
[29:38] and just kind of hit some burdens that
[29:41] were on my heart you know to keep the
[29:43] family clean and staying in the Word of
[29:45] God and keeping the family pure and had
[29:49] a really good time in the Lord and and
[29:53] then there was a little break in there I
[29:54] took a nap you know to kind of rest up
[29:56] and then brother Brooks preached
[29:57] Saturday night and that was probably the
[29:58] best service because at the end all
[30:02] these sisters flooded the altar and they
[30:05] prayed and and there was a grill move of
[30:07] the Holy Spirit and the next day Seven
[30:09] Sisters raised their hands that they got
[30:10] the Holy Ghost so it's a wonderful time
[30:13] of the Lord it was just powerful to hear
[30:14] them crying out to God and hearing the
[30:16] crying and the weeping and seeing the
[30:18] sisters go and pray for one another and
[30:19] they were screaming and worshiping it
[30:22] was just wonderful wonderful move of the
[30:24] Holy Spirit
[30:25] people were really dying out to
[30:27] themselves and Sunday morning I preached
[30:30] on driving out all the enemies so that
[30:32] little series on Joshua I kind of
[30:34] condensed it into one service and it was
[30:36] a real wonderful meeting I was really
[30:38] blessed and the sisters were really
[30:41] that and and the brothers there so it
[30:44] was a wonderful time in Lourdes and
[30:45] Sunday night we left that campgrounds
[30:47] and we went back into New York it's the
[30:49] first time I was in New York in the
[30:50] Bronx I Ted it's pretty dirty into the
[30:52] Bronx I never been there before
[30:54] a lot of beggar's on the streets it was
[30:57] different it was a culture shock to me
[30:59] to see New York and crossover you know
[31:02] from Jersey and a New York there and it
[31:04] was just really something you know I've
[31:05] never been to New York like that but the
[31:07] church was really wonderful at about 150
[31:10] people there and they squeezed in this
[31:12] narrow Church in New York it's really
[31:13] narrow it's probably like this this this
[31:16] narrow but it's really long and and it
[31:21] just was encouraging to me you know they
[31:23] sing in Spanish it's mostly the
[31:24] spanish-speaking church but I was just
[31:27] encouraged because their bathroom is
[31:28] right up front by the pulpit so all
[31:31] through the service there's children
[31:33] women men using the bath shutting the
[31:35] door brother Brooks is up there
[31:36] preaching and and and it gets so hot
[31:38] there they had three people faint last
[31:40] year so it's just an encourage but you
[31:42] know every Church has battles you know I
[31:44] thought how blessed we are we don't have
[31:47] a door opening up over here you know
[31:48] what people using the bathroom and I
[31:50] mean hundred fifty people you know and
[31:52] just constant flow using the restroom
[31:54] and nobody passes out at our church for
[31:56] you know heat exhaustion or anything so
[31:58] I'll just really encourage you know and
[32:00] and the pastor has had a lot of good
[32:02] thing to say about the preaching and it
[32:03] was really great and just a one just a
[32:05] refreshing time in the Lord I felt
[32:07] really thankful to have a part of that
[32:10] and I look forward to going back and and
[32:13] one of the sisters got up on Sunday
[32:14] morning and she wanted to give a
[32:15] testimony and she thanked the Lord for
[32:17] how my wife watched the children so I
[32:20] could come and preach and how sister
[32:23] Ruby watch you know her grandchildren so
[32:24] brother Brooks and his daughter could
[32:26] come and she's a mother of seven
[32:28] children a pastor's wife so very similar
[32:31] to my wife you know we have six kids and
[32:32] and she just want to thank my wife and
[32:34] rubus it was really neat to see that
[32:36] that they cared they were so mindful and
[32:38] they sent gifts for my wife and you know
[32:40] a little notebook and journaling it was
[32:42] just really sweet to be a part of that
[32:44] kind of fellowship so we're very
[32:46] thankful one of the sisters got healed
[32:48] in the meeting she couldn't lift her
[32:49] left arm and then the Holy Spirit
[32:51] touched her on Friday night and she had
[32:53] she was showing her arm she had full
[32:54] Theresa God was certainly moving there
[32:57] and blessing the Saints it was just a
[32:59] wonderful wonderful time in the Lord
[33:01] amen so I guess we'll stop there
[33:04] and well I like to do is I'd like to
[33:08] switch over here cuz I have a ok you'd
[33:12] have to do nothing that's just me
[33:13] I just want to switch over to this use
[33:17] my phone if that's ok that might be a
[33:18] little bit better ok yeah that's better
[33:23] ok so let's look at part 6 tonight by
[33:25] God's grace I'll try to be an hour but I
[33:27] know last week I went a little late so
[33:29] forgive me I just got caught up in the
[33:30] sermon but I'll try to go about an hour
[33:32] today by the grace of Lord so for this
[33:35] church age we preached all that the aged
[33:36] messenger salutation denunciation
[33:39] warning judgment and eulogy and so
[33:41] tonight we're going to start the promise
[33:44] to the overcomer which is the section on
[33:47] the book of life I want to read a
[33:52] portion of the church age book after we
[33:53] read this he's overcometh the same shall
[33:55] be clothed in white raiment so there's a
[33:57] little portion on the white raiment I
[33:59] like to read to you is anybody reading
[34:03] the church age book right now with us
[34:04] Lydia and oh brother Adam was anyone
[34:07] else ok so if I read this it might feel
[34:09] fresh to you by the grace of Lord I
[34:11] thought it might help to you I know as I
[34:15] read it I thought I've got it I got to
[34:17] read this this is a blessing here so he
[34:19] quotes that he that overcomes shall be
[34:20] clothed in white raiment the Prophet
[34:23] says this we used to have a saying years
[34:26] ago that no doubt was taken from this
[34:28] verse it was keep your skirts clean it
[34:32] meant don't get involved in questionable
[34:34] things others will be involved and you
[34:37] might be tempted to be involved or
[34:38] someone might even try to involve you
[34:41] but stay clear of it all by steering a
[34:44] clear course away from it and now God is
[34:48] going to reward those who follow this
[34:50] advice they're going to be clothed in
[34:52] white even as he is clothed in white
[34:54] Peter James and John saw him on Mount
[34:56] Transfiguration and his clothes were
[34:59] white as light that is how the Saints
[35:02] are going to be clothed their garments
[35:04] will be shining exceeding light
[35:07] hallelujah
[35:08] he said we know we're living in the end
[35:10] time I'm gonna skip ahead more to the
[35:12] white you can't walk in the Spotted
[35:14] garments of the world holding hands with
[35:17] the devil here and then expect to be
[35:19] with God it's time to wake up and hear
[35:22] the voice of God cry and come out of her
[35:23] organized religion my people that you be
[35:27] not partakers of her sins that you
[35:29] receive not of her plagues God is
[35:32] speaking shun the religions of the world
[35:34] like you shun the plague leave off
[35:37] walking with the world and make your
[35:39] garments white by repentance and the
[35:41] blood of the Lamb but do it now for
[35:44] tomorrow may be too late like that aim
[35:47] ahead keep yourselves keep your skirts
[35:50] clean stay out of anything that's
[35:52] questionable staying something that's
[35:55] solid with the Word of God I thought
[35:56] you'd like that by the grace of God so
[35:58] that's the inspiration the Prophet had
[35:59] on this scripture too to share those
[36:03] thoughts now let's move on here
[36:06] diversify the underlined part and I will
[36:09] not blot out his name out of the book of
[36:11] life so those who walk with Christ and
[36:14] white will not have their names blotted
[36:17] out that's a reward I want you to see
[36:19] this I'm not sure if you caught this but
[36:21] brother Branham calls this portion of
[36:23] the scripture the book of life he calls
[36:26] this a most difficult portion of the
[36:29] word how many could say men in the head
[36:31] as I've studied the book of life it's
[36:33] gone from really really confusing to
[36:36] more understandable but I can't say I
[36:39] understand everything about it but I can
[36:41] say it started very very confusing so I
[36:45] agree with the prophet of God it was a
[36:46] very difficult portion of the word to
[36:49] understand specifically the part where
[36:52] he says the book of life in the Lamb's
[36:54] Book of Life
[36:55] he said they look like they're two books
[36:57] he said but they're one but then he says
[36:59] they are like two books he says so he
[37:02] says both he says it's like they're two
[37:04] books but it's like they're one book and
[37:06] so it is a very sort of difficult
[37:09] portion of the word and he says this
[37:14] possibility of a name removed from the
[37:17] book requires more than a casual study
[37:22] and so I preached five sermons on this
[37:25] in 2014 is anybody remember that I think
[37:27] maybe our sister might be the only one
[37:29] that remembers that and my wife maybe I
[37:30] don't know but I preached five sermons
[37:32] on I remember the Rolf's remember
[37:34] because Karen this is a Karen Delores
[37:37] would asking me different questions
[37:38] after I was preaching on it so I do
[37:39] remember that part of it and they might
[37:41] have forgot on that but that's okay the
[37:44] church age book has about 20 pages
[37:45] dedicated to this teaching which is the
[37:48] most pages dedicated to one doctrine in
[37:50] the entire book so the next few services
[37:53] were just reviewing some of these things
[37:55] and remember it's a most difficult
[37:57] portion of the word for someone who's
[38:00] brand-new to the Word of God all right
[38:04] at the very start of our study let it be
[38:07] known that there's not one scripture
[38:08] that teaches that God is presently
[38:11] compiling a record of names this was all
[38:15] done before the foundation of the world
[38:16] as will point out shortly also it's not
[38:19] a question of simply involving ourselves
[38:22] with two groups of people both of whom
[38:24] had opportunity to receive eternal life
[38:26] we're in one group received it and had
[38:29] their names placed on record while the
[38:30] others who refused it did not have their
[38:32] name so place isn't that quite a
[38:35] statement it's not even that simple like
[38:38] it's not even while these people receive
[38:39] eternal life and these didn't so they're
[38:41] going to hell
[38:42] romance there's not even that simple
[38:43] it's more it's more different than that
[38:47] because we'll show by scripture that
[38:49] multitudes who are not even born again
[38:52] will go into eternal life as strange as
[38:55] this may sound it is certainly true amen
[38:58] so let's review so let me put that a
[39:00] little more layman's terms okay
[39:03] I'm sorry my fault up I didn't even I am
[39:07] tapping the wrong one forgive me I got a
[39:09] I pad let me scoot these over here God
[39:13] is not presently compiling a list of
[39:15] names okay he's not presently writing
[39:18] names down he already did that before
[39:20] the foundation of the world according to
[39:21] those scriptures which for familiar with
[39:23] and also one group will receive eternal
[39:26] life even though they did not receive it
[39:29] while on earth so that's why it's a
[39:31] little bit more deep than what most
[39:33] people think well you know this person
[39:35] didn't receive it
[39:36] life they're definitely going to hell
[39:37] well you can't exactly say that if they
[39:39] did something nice to one of Jesus
[39:41] brethren then Jesus will give them
[39:43] eternal life we know that so it's not
[39:47] even that simple so it's a very deep
[39:48] study in the Word of God so I want to
[39:51] look at this now where the Prophet says
[39:52] this we will show that there's a group
[39:55] of people whose names have been placed
[39:57] on that record before the foundation of
[39:59] the world and cannot under any
[40:01] circumstance have those names removed
[40:04] amen but will also show that another
[40:06] group whose names were on that record
[40:08] before the foundation world will have
[40:10] their names removed so see there's a
[40:14] group that cannot have their names
[40:16] removed but there is a group that even
[40:18] though their names were written before
[40:19] the foundation of the world they can
[40:21] have them removed like Judas all right
[40:25] now I I did this a while ago I want to
[40:29] bring it back and just bring in I
[40:31] brought it just brought in these down
[40:32] here so this is the group that make
[40:34] believers a group that could have their
[40:36] names written on the book of life before
[40:39] the foundation of the world but then
[40:41] have it removed because of transgression
[40:43] but the the wise virgin or the the
[40:47] highest quality of the believer their
[40:49] names cannot in any way be removed
[40:52] praise God because they're written in
[40:54] the Lamb's Book of Life so remember this
[40:57] there's two destinies but then you have
[40:59] three kinds of believers but the program
[41:01] said there's a fourth class there's
[41:03] another class of believer that's the
[41:05] foolish virgin and this is totally
[41:07] scriptural as we know all down through
[41:09] the Bible I preached at numerous times
[41:11] so that should be kind of familiar to us
[41:16] to begin with there's no basis for the
[41:19] claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is
[41:21] not the same as the book of life the
[41:23] book of life might be called the Lamb's
[41:25] Book of Life or Christ's book of life or
[41:28] even thy book and the book of the living
[41:30] only names are written therein this is
[41:34] what revelation 13:8 says all that dwell
[41:35] upon the earth shall worship Him the
[41:38] beasts whose names are not written in
[41:40] the book of life of the lamb slain from
[41:43] the foundation of the world revelation
[41:46] 17:8 this is the most clear of all the
[41:48] scriptures I think we're
[41:49] says it and they they draw on the earth
[41:51] shall wonder whose names were not
[41:53] written in the book of life from the
[41:56] foundation of the world see so see if
[41:59] your names if you if people wonder and
[42:01] admire the beasts and the Pope and the
[42:03] Antichrist system and the if they wonder
[42:06] and if they love that system it shows
[42:08] their names were not written in the book
[42:09] of life before the foundation world now
[42:12] is it possible they could do something
[42:14] nice for God's people and be saved yes
[42:16] it's very possible but they cannot
[42:18] worship the Beast system now it says
[42:22] when they behold the Beast that was and
[42:23] is not and yet is all right now I'm just
[42:27] going through a lot of America
[42:27] scriptures here but bear with me I'll
[42:29] get to some new things in in a moment
[42:31] here by the grace of Lord now revelation
[42:34] 20 verse 12 and I saw the dead small and
[42:36] great stand before God and the books
[42:39] were opened and another book was opened
[42:41] which is the book of life and the dead
[42:43] were judged out of those things which
[42:44] are written in the books according to
[42:46] their works skipping down to verse 15
[42:48] and who suffers not found written in the
[42:51] book of life was cast into the lake of
[42:53] fire all right
[42:56] now you can see that though there are
[42:59] other books mentioned there is always
[43:01] the reference to one book containing
[43:03] names in the revelation that is called
[43:06] the Lamb's Book of Life or the book of
[43:08] life praise God
[43:11] where's this book located Jesus tells us
[43:14] he said rejoice because your names are
[43:17] written in heaven amen this book is in
[43:20] heaven praise God he says the book of
[43:23] life is definitely located in heaven and
[43:25] will appear at the great white throne
[43:26] judgment in these verses jesus said that
[43:29] their names are written in heaven they
[43:31] were written in the book of life for
[43:33] that is where names are placed Jesus was
[43:37] speaking to the seventy so let's go
[43:38] there if you got your Bible as you can
[43:41] see this here I thought this was really
[43:42] wonderful observation by the Prophet as
[43:46] he's discerning and teaching the word
[43:48] for us this is Luke 10 if you got your
[43:54] Bible Luke chapter 10 I like to see this
[43:57] because it improves it pretty plainly
[43:59] Luke 10 17 says and the seventy returned
[44:03] again
[44:03] Jois there's the 70 in this portion now
[44:06] in verse 23 he's still talking Luke 10
[44:10] 23 and he turned unto him and I'm sorry
[44:13] turned him unto his disciples and said
[44:16] privately blessed it are the eyes which
[44:18] see the things that you see praise God
[44:22] so he has 70 plus 12 he's got at least
[44:25] 82 people around him right he's got a
[44:28] big group around him and he's talking
[44:30] about don't rejoice that demons move
[44:32] rejoice that your names are written in
[44:34] heaven praise God that's the biggest
[44:36] blessing is to be saved these had all
[44:39] been rejoicing the Devils were subject
[44:41] to them in Jesus name Christ rejoinder
[44:43] was rejoice now spirits are subject to
[44:46] you but rather your names are written in
[44:48] the book of life now here's how you
[44:50] teach Judas his name was removed from
[44:53] the book of life this is how the Prophet
[44:55] teaches it here
[44:58] he reads these scriptures these
[45:00] scriptures prove Judas was the son of
[45:03] perdition and he was a devil we're not
[45:06] going to take time to read those because
[45:07] I want to get to where I'm going I want
[45:09] to end with idolatry I want to end with
[45:11] idolatry tonight that's where I'm going
[45:13] here so those scriptures just prove
[45:15] Judas was the son of perdition and the
[45:18] perdition means destruction he was the
[45:21] son of destruction he was going to be
[45:23] destroyed
[45:24] now if language means anything at all we
[45:28] must admit that Judas was chosen by
[45:30] Jesus that's in John 13 18 I'm gonna
[45:33] read these john 13 18
[45:41] John 1318 I speak not of you all I know
[45:49] whom I have chosen but that the
[45:51] scripture may be fulfilled he that
[45:53] eateth the bread with me hath lifted up
[45:56] his heel against me do you remember when
[45:59] Jesus chose his disciples church
[46:01] remember before he chose them he stayed
[46:03] up all night praying remember that part
[46:07] of me wonders I just wonder is that
[46:09] because he was no II knew he had to face
[46:11] Judas face to face this one that was
[46:13] gonna cause him to be arrested and
[46:15] betray him and basically blaspheme the
[46:18] Holy Ghost that's what he was gonna do
[46:19] he's gonna blasting the word for his
[46:20] hour so we had to pray through and have
[46:24] enough courage I imagined to call him as
[46:27] one of his disciples and brother Branham
[46:30] said he was so religious nobody picked
[46:32] up that he was a devil okay so he was
[46:36] chosen Judas was chosen we must admit
[46:39] that yet he was not clean verses 10 and
[46:41] 11 because the Bible said he that's
[46:44] washed needeth not safe to wash his feet
[46:46] but his clean everywhere and you're
[46:48] clean but not all for he knew who should
[46:53] betray him therefore he said he are not
[46:55] all clean and this is striking to Jesus
[47:00] was I'm sorry yeah Jesus from the father
[47:05] was given Judas as one of the servants
[47:07] that's in John 17 12 John 17 12 remember
[47:12] this is how you prove that somebody can
[47:14] have their name on the book of life
[47:15] before the foundation of world but then
[47:17] have it removed because there's no
[47:19] scripture of God presently writing down
[47:21] names where people got saved did you
[47:24] know there's quotes or brother Branham
[47:25] said your God will write your name on
[47:26] the Lamb's Book of Life tonight if you
[47:28] get saved did you know that so he had to
[47:30] grow in understanding it was in the late
[47:32] 50s I preached it when I preached it
[47:34] back in 2014 so I didn't want to bring
[47:36] it up you know but he even grew an
[47:38] understanding he thought well people got
[47:40] saved or now God wrote your name on the
[47:42] book but everybody that was going to
[47:44] claim to have life already had their
[47:45] name on the book before the foundation
[47:47] of the world
[47:48] okay so 1712 while I was with them in
[47:52] the world I kept them in thy name
[47:54] those that thou gave us me I've kept and
[47:57] none of them is lost but the son of
[47:59] perdition that the scripture might be
[48:02] fulfilled so see those that thou gave us
[48:05] me so Judas was given to Jesus by the
[48:07] father the father chosen Judas and said
[48:11] you need to be an apostle you need to be
[48:12] a missionary and he stayed at it real
[48:14] good for a while right but then at the
[48:16] end he sold it out and proved he was not
[48:18] of the right seed now he said let it be
[48:22] noted here that the choosing and giving
[48:23] is the exact parallel as the
[48:26] illustration of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob
[48:28] and Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh
[48:30] were both far known they were
[48:32] predestinated to wrath while the end of
[48:35] Moses and Jacob was glorification so see
[48:38] you can put Pharaoh and Esau in Judas in
[48:41] the same group they were all for known
[48:43] but they were far known to be destroyed
[48:46] because God knew what they choose
[48:48] already that's why God could
[48:50] predestinate them to that wrath he knew
[48:52] what they choose now let's read this
[48:55] here let's go to first Peter two eight
[48:57] and nine let's read that that'll be good
[48:59] refresher for us first Peter two eight
[49:02] and nine remember this is a deep study
[49:11] you got to be careful in the book of
[49:12] life you got to be very careful because
[49:16] there are so many scriptures about it
[49:20] first Peter 2:8 and 9 we'll just read it
[49:26] because that talks about how people are
[49:28] appointed to destruction and a stone of
[49:31] stumbling in a rock of offense even to
[49:33] them which stumble at the word being
[49:35] disobedient where and two also they were
[49:38] appointed so some people were appointed
[49:40] to disobedience aren't you glad if you
[49:43] can obey the word of God he could not he
[49:46] could not obey the word at the end in
[49:47] fact we know he was stealing from Jesus
[49:49] the whole time because the Bible said he
[49:51] was a thief he was stealing money out of
[49:54] the bag the whole time and nobody knew
[49:56] it see how the devil can hide even the
[49:58] Church of Jesus did the devil can hide
[50:00] from those 11 apostles of course didn't
[50:02] have the Holy Ghost but they were living
[50:05] sanctified at times right they go from
[50:07] sanctification
[50:08] then they lose a little bit their
[50:09] strength you remember like Peter we
[50:11] preach on that with sanctification they
[50:13] were up and down up and down up and down
[50:16] now but ye are a chosen generation
[50:18] praise God amen
[50:20] now Judas was numbered with the twelve
[50:23] and actually had a part with them in the
[50:25] ministry previous the Pentecost we just
[50:30] obtained amongst the twelve listen this
[50:32] and then loss was neither inferior
[50:36] Judas's ministry wasn't any less than
[50:38] Peters can you say amen to that he had a
[50:41] part he had a faithful part in the
[50:43] ministry his ministering was just as
[50:46] wonderful as Peters when he's under the
[50:48] Holy Spirit it wasn't inferior that's
[50:50] why they didn't know to the ministries
[50:53] of the other eleven nor was it a
[50:55] devilish foreign ministry interjected
[50:57] amongst the ministries of the others now
[51:01] let me say this I know five message
[51:03] ministers that have walked away from the
[51:05] message and I'm not I'm not saying
[51:07] they're Judas I'm not saying that but
[51:08] listen they've walked away and some of
[51:11] them have told testimonies of the Dead
[51:13] being raised one of them saw a dead
[51:16] person after God we're getting run over
[51:17] by a vehicle prayed for them and they
[51:19] came back to life and then left the
[51:22] message so what you see what I'm saying
[51:25] like Judas didn't when he was under the
[51:27] anointing it wasn't inferior it was just
[51:30] as great as everybody else
[51:31] and God is so good so glorified in those
[51:36] works for the believers right and Judas
[51:40] could have had a reward but the Bible
[51:42] said when you disobey you lose your
[51:43] reward so he lost any reward because he
[51:47] sold it out but the RAM said he was
[51:49] fooled but the elect meet a fool they
[51:52] not in who yeah they let cannot meet a
[51:55] fool with organization and blasphemy and
[51:57] things like that why cuz they fear God
[52:00] in their hearts they love God in their
[52:02] hearts hallelujah and see it wasn't nor
[52:05] nor it was not a devilish foreign
[52:08] ministry so Judas was not out there you
[52:10] know trying to pull a witchcraft like
[52:14] you know like an exorcism you know like
[52:16] you'd see on a movie or I never really
[52:18] seen those on movies but you hear about
[52:19] him he wasn't trying to use demon powers
[52:22] you know to conjure up and he wasn't
[52:24] saying Oh Hail Mary Mother of grace and
[52:26] you know rubbing things together and he
[52:28] wasn't he wasn't doing witchcraft Church
[52:31] he was saying in the name of Jesus and
[52:33] he was believing it just like everybody
[52:35] else believed but inside of him inside
[52:40] of his heart was a heart that was never
[52:42] really sold out to God Amen brother
[52:45] Graham said this in the seat of the
[52:47] scrumpet see he said Judas never had
[52:48] faith to begin with a genuine faith can
[52:52] you imagine that he said he never had
[52:54] genuine faith to begin with so the
[52:56] anointing could come on him just like
[52:58] the anointing in the water can fall on a
[53:00] thorn bush right just like the water can
[53:04] fall on a thorn bush it's still a thorn
[53:05] Judas was like a thorn but the jointing
[53:08] still fell on him and he still did
[53:11] miracles my Judas a devil lost listeners
[53:17] a god-given Holy Ghost ministry that's
[53:23] an amazing statement in one sentence
[53:25] Judas lost a god-given Holy Ghost
[53:29] ministry his ministry was nothing less
[53:32] than the man who had the keys of the
[53:34] kingdom I know you're James or John John
[53:38] the Beloved Disciple right who lean in
[53:40] Jesus bosom Judas is just as many
[53:42] miracles as him it was a non-inferior it
[53:46] wasn't devilish it was a Holy Ghost
[53:48] ministry that's why we appreciate all
[53:51] you know men of God or even sisters we
[53:53] have gifts of miracles but we better
[53:55] watch their lives and not exalt them
[53:57] because they might turn away from Christ
[53:59] though it's not the miracles that prove
[54:02] it's your life that proves amen because
[54:06] he had a he had a equal ministry as any
[54:09] of the disciples Judas did so he went
[54:13] and killed himself sadly and went to his
[54:15] own place the Bible says his name wasn't
[54:18] even in the book of life but his name
[54:20] was blotted out all right now here's one
[54:26] more point on Judas I wanted to bring
[54:28] out and I loved this point so get your
[54:31] behind us I said I love it for the
[54:33] believer now go to John chapter 12
[54:36] this is what I was saying earlier about
[54:38] gratitude how many feel gratitude in
[54:40] your heart for God let me let me show
[54:43] you how much God loves that in church I
[54:51] just want to express a little gratitude
[54:52] you know just for the thankfulness of
[54:55] the word that we've received and how my
[54:57] wife and I especially my wife trains the
[54:59] children at home we went to the dentist
[55:01] yesterday and just a little testimony
[55:07] the woman who cleans my teeth when we
[55:10] first met her she was really really
[55:11] upset with us for some numerous reasons
[55:13] she did not like us she really my wife
[55:16] could tell you she really didn't think
[55:17] much of us there was nothing we did it
[55:20] was like scheduling problems or
[55:21] something like that but yesterday after
[55:24] a year or two of going to her she said
[55:27] can I tell you something I got my mouth
[55:28] oh man okay you know he's up she said if
[55:33] I come back to Earth in another life she
[55:36] said I want to be born in your family
[55:38] and I start laughing like what are you
[55:40] talking about she said he said I don't
[55:44] believe she says she kind of giggles cuz
[55:45] she knows I'm a pastor she's gotta go
[55:47] see it now I don't believe in
[55:48] reincarnation she said but I just think
[55:50] your family is so sweet and you have
[55:53] such a godly family you know cuz they
[55:54] watch the girls and maokai come in like
[55:56] that and church that just makes me
[55:58] grateful that a woman who's at the end
[56:00] of their life her dad's 90 and a half so
[56:02] she's got to be 65 you know 70 something
[56:06] like that it just really makes me
[56:08] thankful that if we just eat this book
[56:11] we become the book and we have to and
[56:15] when we first met her we have to brag
[56:17] and say hey we're pastors and we're a
[56:19] pastor we have a patent or the little
[56:21] over the head of a church we're nothing
[56:23] we just walk in there and when we faced
[56:26] with adversity you just try to shine the
[56:28] light back you just try to cast down the
[56:31] spirit that's dominating them you just
[56:33] try to change the atmosphere praise God
[56:35] and let the light of Christ shine so I
[56:38] just want to share that that was just an
[56:40] encouragement to my heart and I am
[56:42] thankful for that tonight that's why
[56:43] that's why I can come and preach even if
[56:45] there's just two people here I don't
[56:47] mind coming preaching because I'm paying
[56:49] for what this
[56:50] bird has done for my life praise God I
[56:51] know what it's done to my life I know
[56:53] the sinner I was before I got saved I
[56:55] know what I used to be I don't want the
[56:57] desires of my heart I know what I used
[56:58] to think and say and do and hide out new
[57:01] kinds of evil things I know what Christ
[57:03] has done in my life amen and I'm
[57:05] grateful for the grace of God tonight
[57:07] amen
[57:08] John 12:1 God is so good to us
[57:14] if you know this story
[57:16] this is Lazarus sister Martha and let me
[57:23] let's read the story verse 1 then Jesus
[57:25] six days before the Passover came to
[57:27] Bethany where Lazarus was which had been
[57:30] dead whom he raised from the dead and
[57:32] there they made him a supper and Martha
[57:34] served but Lazarus I'm sorry I got a
[57:36] mixed up this no I got right this is
[57:38] Mary yeah but Lazarus one of them that
[57:40] sat at the table with him then took Mary
[57:42] a pound of ointment of spikenard very
[57:44] costly and anointed the feet of Jesus
[57:47] and wiped his feet with her hair now you
[57:51] know brother BAM said that I told many
[57:53] people that how could womanish or hair
[57:55] wash Jesus feet she have to she have to
[57:57] do a headstand right she have to stand
[57:59] on her head she have to balance like a
[58:00] gymnast and stand on her head in order
[58:03] to wash his feet with Erics you don't
[58:04] have any hair it so proves God and God
[58:07] never asked the godly woman to cut her
[58:09] hair in the entire Bible there's one
[58:12] time God asked women to cut their hair
[58:13] in the Bible you know what it was it was
[58:14] Israel when God was gonna have him taken
[58:17] out by Nebuchadnezzar he said cut your
[58:19] hair make yourselves bald for the day of
[58:21] judgment has come so people have women
[58:25] want to cut their hair that's fine but
[58:26] judgments coming on you say what I'm
[58:29] saying that's the only time God ever
[58:31] asked anybody to cut their hair was when
[58:33] it was time for judgment to happen and
[58:35] how many under mercy that how many under
[58:38] mercy tonight by God's grace I'm not
[58:39] under God's judgment I'm under God's
[58:41] mercy praise God now look at this here
[58:45] verse 4 then says one of his disciples
[58:47] Judas Iscariot Simon's son which should
[58:49] betray him why was not this ointment
[58:52] sold for three hundred Pence and given
[58:53] to the poor this he said not that he
[58:57] cared for the poor but because he was a
[58:59] thief and had the bag and bear that
[59:01] which was put there aim
[59:03] and now Church be careful how you read
[59:06] this don't get it in your mind like
[59:08] Judas was like this like you know he's
[59:10] smoking a cigarette saying oh that
[59:12] should have been given to the park and
[59:14] he's got his bag of change over here
[59:17] brother branham said he was so religious
[59:20] he said it with the most sincerity so
[59:24] picture that he would have said I ran
[59:39] across some windows it wasn't the
[59:47] scruffy man you know with the torn
[59:49] clothes like we think you know like with
[59:51] money falling out of his pocket and he's
[59:53] got drool and tobacco juice on the side
[59:55] of his mouth like and messed up hair he
[59:58] was religious satan's excites himself in
[1:00:02] beauty he was the best-looking of those
[1:00:04] disciples if anybody looked like they
[1:00:07] had it together my eye was Judas you
[1:00:09] know he had everything together
[1:00:11] he was so religious he was so deceptive
[1:00:16] and what did Jesus say leave her alone
[1:00:18] I imagine Jesus had the real humility
[1:00:20] and maybe Jesus had a little bit of a
[1:00:23] Ignatian we don't know but he said leave
[1:00:26] her alone
[1:00:26] right because he could discern it
[1:00:28] against the day of my bearing has she
[1:00:30] kept this for the poor always you have
[1:00:32] with you but me you not or don't have
[1:00:35] always turn to Matthew 26 verse 10 this
[1:00:44] is a parallel passage there's a parallel
[1:00:47] passage and let me show you how much God
[1:00:51] loves when you just come to church and
[1:00:54] you just come now yeah we always want to
[1:00:56] receive from God don't we but if there's
[1:00:59] times we just want to come and just give
[1:01:00] God thanks and that's why I appreciate
[1:01:03] when you when everybody puts like
[1:01:05] testimonies in that blesses my heart so
[1:01:07] much and you know if it blesses my heart
[1:01:09] how much more does a bless God's heart
[1:01:11] because God loved Mary's worship because
[1:01:15] there was no strings attached to it she
[1:01:17] just one to be grateful to Christ I'm
[1:01:20] gonna jump ahead to my point but this is
[1:01:22] what doctor Scofield noted in his Bible
[1:01:24] he said notice all the other women that
[1:01:26] came to touch him they came to get
[1:01:28] something from him but Mary was the only
[1:01:30] one who came just to show her gratitude
[1:01:33] right the one with the blood issue she
[1:01:36] came what to touch his feet so she could
[1:01:37] be healed the the harlot woman she came
[1:01:41] and noted in that Simon's house why so
[1:01:43] she could be forgiven but Mary was
[1:01:46] already saved Mary already recognized
[1:01:48] Christ the Messiah she just came to give
[1:01:51] him glory oh that's how we need to come
[1:01:53] to church sometimes amen
[1:01:54] I just came out to give God the glory
[1:01:56] ain't the head and or just go to your
[1:01:58] prayer closet I'm not gonna ask for
[1:02:00] anything I just want to ask that you
[1:02:02] receive my worship because I love you
[1:02:04] amen that's what Jesus loves and because
[1:02:07] Jesus loved me so much he said every
[1:02:09] preacher in every nation wherever this
[1:02:11] gospel is preached will preach about
[1:02:13] this woman Judas sat there and got
[1:02:15] jealous cuz he wondered that money he
[1:02:18] wanted that money but Jesus saw through
[1:02:20] that lie and he said this is a true act
[1:02:23] of gratitude and every preacher that is
[1:02:25] a preacher will preach about Mary amen
[1:02:28] go to Matthew 26 10 and when Jesus
[1:02:31] understood he said of my trouble you the
[1:02:33] woman for she hath wrought a good work
[1:02:34] upon me go down to verse 13 verily I say
[1:02:38] to you whoever some of this gospel shall
[1:02:40] be preached in the whole world there
[1:02:43] shall also this that this woman had done
[1:02:46] be told a memorial for her praise God
[1:02:50] hey man in that beautiful all because it
[1:02:55] was just gratitude I just came out to
[1:02:58] church to give God things I just come
[1:03:00] here to praise Jesus to pour my worship
[1:03:02] on Jesus that's all I came here to do is
[1:03:05] to sing a special or give a testimony or
[1:03:07] rejoice and thank God for the word
[1:03:09] that's all I came to do and Jesus said
[1:03:11] that is a memorial praise God heaven
[1:03:14] recognize this memorial so every
[1:03:16] preacher that is a preacher will preach
[1:03:18] about Mary bringing gratitude to anoint
[1:03:21] Christ amen hallelujah oh my thank you
[1:03:25] Jesus so that's what Judas pretend to be
[1:03:29] concern for the poor in
[1:03:30] steal the money but Scofield says Martha
[1:03:34] stands for service remember she was
[1:03:35] always what she said get up Mary come
[1:03:37] serve come help me
[1:03:39] Lazarus stands for communion so Mary
[1:03:42] shows the worship of a grateful heart
[1:03:44] Scofield set others before had come to
[1:03:47] his feet to have their needs met she
[1:03:49] came to give him his due to give him his
[1:03:52] worship although two of the van just
[1:03:55] recorded the act John alone gives her
[1:03:56] name that's just a side note isn't that
[1:03:59] beautiful
[1:03:59] my goodness I thought that's so powerful
[1:04:02] she only came to show her gratitude to
[1:04:05] the Lord praise God program says this
[1:04:10] he's talking about the wise men how they
[1:04:12] brought their best gifts they brought
[1:04:13] myrrh the best gift they could find we
[1:04:16] realize over in Saint John 12 this woman
[1:04:18] this woman brought the myrrh that
[1:04:19] anointed costly something to take the
[1:04:23] smell of death away and she broke the
[1:04:25] alabaster box important on the head of
[1:04:26] Jesus and Judas said why this ought have
[1:04:28] been given to the poor said not that he
[1:04:30] had respect for the poor but he was the
[1:04:32] thief to begin with he carried the money
[1:04:34] and said this all have been sold instead
[1:04:37] of put in and Jesus said let her alone
[1:04:39] for she did this she anointed him under
[1:04:42] his Barrow see this woman so grateful
[1:04:46] that her sins were forgiven so see she
[1:04:48] was already saved she wasn't like the
[1:04:51] woman at Simon's house the prostitute
[1:04:52] woman it wasn't like that
[1:04:54] she was already saved she just wanted to
[1:04:56] pour out blessings upon her Savior amen
[1:04:59] until she spent all of her money she had
[1:05:02] and took an alabaster box and broke it
[1:05:04] and poured the oil and just adored I'm
[1:05:07] sorry I'm so ordered the room with the
[1:05:10] fine smell of his myrrh that she had
[1:05:12] anointed him for his death now see she
[1:05:15] did the service not knowing what she was
[1:05:17] doing but she was so grateful to God
[1:05:20] amen hallelujah I love that there were
[1:05:24] scriptures where I read those alright so
[1:05:30] you see that's one more point about
[1:05:31] Judas he was criticizing women in the
[1:05:36] church for their Pentecostal worship can
[1:05:39] I say like that he was criticized by the
[1:05:42] RAM cause it spawned
[1:05:44] Dainius worship he was criticized in
[1:05:47] women that just wanted to shout and
[1:05:48] praise God and glorify God and scream
[1:05:51] and cry at the altar
[1:05:52] praise the Lord Judas criticized that
[1:05:55] but Jesus said let her do it let her do
[1:05:58] it because she's pouring out a blessing
[1:06:00] upon me amen hallelujah oh thank you
[1:06:05] lord
[1:06:05] Oh glory now just like Judas his name
[1:06:10] was removed and I'm gonna do it on time
[1:06:12] okay good
[1:06:13] 27 minutes God did the same thing in the
[1:06:17] Old Testament Dan and Ephraim
[1:06:20] now before we pursue this thought on
[1:06:23] Judas let us go back to the Old
[1:06:25] Testament and see where God did the same
[1:06:27] thing so that's why I love about brother
[1:06:29] Branham he he said memory of what he
[1:06:30] said the keystone of the Bible was
[1:06:32] what's the key story what's the
[1:06:34] foundation what's the cornerstone of the
[1:06:35] Bible Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the
[1:06:38] same yesterday today and forever so if
[1:06:41] God does something in the New Testament
[1:06:42] removes a name he already had to do it
[1:06:44] in the Old Testament and he did it with
[1:06:47] Dan and Ephraim thus when Israel left
[1:06:51] Egypt and God gave them the tabernacle
[1:06:53] of awareness we find the tribe of Levi
[1:06:55] ministering to the 12 tribes named
[1:06:57] Reuben Simeon it's the car Judah Zebulon
[1:07:01] Benjamin Dan Neftali GAD Asher Ephraim
[1:07:04] and Manasseh the order of the host names
[1:07:07] them thus in numbers 10 11 through 28
[1:07:11] there's no mention of Joseph or Levi but
[1:07:14] when we look in Revelation 7 4 to 8
[1:07:16] where it says they were sealed on once
[1:07:19] sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[1:07:21] children of Israel it names them thus
[1:07:24] Judah Reuben GAD Asher Naphtali Manasseh
[1:07:27] Simeon Levi it's a car Zebulon and
[1:07:30] Joseph Benjamin we are back to the 12
[1:07:33] tribes with Levi and Joseph named
[1:07:36] amongst them but with Dan and Ephraim
[1:07:38] missing okay so could everybody
[1:07:41] understand that Dan and Ephraim were
[1:07:44] mentioned the Old Testament when we get
[1:07:46] to the 144,000 which is at the end of
[1:07:49] Jacob's trouble or the end of the
[1:07:51] Tribulation Period dan and ephraim are
[1:07:54] missing they're not in the roll call all
[1:07:56] right because their names are removed
[1:07:58] the question now rises why are these two
[1:08:02] tribes deleted the answer lies in
[1:08:05] Deuteronomy 29 16 to 20 let's read that
[1:08:13] Deuteronomy 29 16 to 20 and we know why
[1:08:19] they're removed now because of idolatry
[1:08:21] not adultery but I guess it is spiritual
[1:08:25] adultery but it's actually idolatry with
[1:08:27] the I I you know idolatry Deuteronomy 29
[1:08:33] 16 I love the word of God that's one
[1:08:41] thing about love about the church age
[1:08:43] book it brought out so many scriptures I
[1:08:45] would I never heard during the preaching
[1:08:46] and I never read over oh it's like a
[1:08:49] it's like a treasure trove of scriptures
[1:08:51] and gold nuggets they I never oh I never
[1:08:53] even heard brother man preach that and
[1:08:55] you can just dig and dig and find all
[1:08:57] these wonderful treasures in the Word of
[1:08:58] God all right 29:16
[1:09:04] anyone want to read that for me verse 16
[1:09:06] but Adam do you read what can you read
[1:09:08] 16 and 17 but okay
[1:09:09] thank you thank you brother
[1:09:29] now look abominations and idols and now
[1:09:34] they're gonna get their names removed
[1:09:35] for abominations now what do we call
[1:09:37] dominations homosexuality bestiality
[1:09:39] cross-dressing right all these
[1:09:41] abominations drinking eating or eating
[1:09:43] blood drinking blood all these
[1:09:44] abominable things but it's abominations
[1:09:47] and idolatry so many times we think oh
[1:09:50] just idolatry but it's actually
[1:09:53] abominations - so that's a little
[1:09:55] interesting nugget there by God's grace
[1:09:57] okay so we read 16 17 Malachi can you
[1:10:00] read 18 and 19 would that be okay buddy

[1:11:31] under a deception they're deceived
[1:11:34] because see they sit there they bless
[1:11:37] their heart they turn away from what you
[1:11:39] told them they turn away from what they
[1:11:41] heard about Dena I'm sorry Bhama nations
[1:11:43] and idolatry they say all bless bless my
[1:11:46] soul God loves me anyway I'm on my way
[1:11:47] to heaven shout in the victory but if
[1:11:50] God knows their heart and they actually
[1:11:53] love sin more they love righteousness
[1:11:54] their names will be removed from the
[1:11:56] book of life that's right oh I'm gonna
[1:12:01] have peace Osia lome brother Shalom you
[1:12:04] know they shake your hand and say Shalom
[1:12:05] but their hearts turned away see that's
[1:12:08] why I lied you came to turn our hearts
[1:12:10] to God amen
[1:12:11] hallelujah that's why we got the Word of
[1:12:14] God for this day to turn our hearts
[1:12:15] toward right or back towards the
[1:12:18] Apostolic fathers amen but they're hard
[1:12:20] to turn away from the Apostolic fathers
[1:12:22] and they want to walk in abominations
[1:12:25] and idolatry and say that's okay bless
[1:12:28] my soul I have peace with God I know
[1:12:29] where I'm going and they're most likely
[1:12:31] deceived I thought I hope you caught
[1:12:36] that that was really striking see
[1:12:40] imagination they're just imagining or
[1:12:41] imagining they ever walk with God
[1:12:43] they're imagining they're obeying the
[1:12:44] Lord but they're not obeying the Lord if
[1:12:46] they're enjoying abominations and
[1:12:48] idolatry Church they cannot you cannot
[1:12:52] assert you cannot serve or walk
[1:12:53] with the devil's hand on the earth and
[1:12:55] expect to hold God's hand in the
[1:12:57] afterlife if you walk with the devil's
[1:12:59] and you're gonna be with the devil right
[1:13:02] and the evil spirits and all that
[1:13:04] judgment look at that now verse 20 the
[1:13:07] Lord will not spare him so see he's the
[1:13:10] same yesterday today forever that's not
[1:13:12] gonna spare someone who willingly walks
[1:13:14] in sin like that Lord will not spare him
[1:13:17] but then the anger of the Lord and his
[1:13:18] jealousy shall smoke against that man
[1:13:20] and all the curses that are written this
[1:13:21] book shall lie upon him and the Lord
[1:13:24] shall blot out his name from under
[1:13:27] heaven you see how this is a very
[1:13:29] serious thing especially when you get to
[1:13:32] idolatry and you get to abominations and
[1:13:36] I'm gonna get to a few those in a few
[1:13:38] minutes here and I'm not trying to be
[1:13:40] critical of anybody Church I hope you
[1:13:41] understand that you know not trying to
[1:13:43] criticize other people I'm just trying
[1:13:44] to show you that we must run from sin we
[1:13:47] must flee from sin right we must stay as
[1:13:49] far away from sin as we possibly can so
[1:13:53] we read that thank you for the reading
[1:13:56] help I appreciate that brothers thank
[1:13:57] you here it is pronounced the curse
[1:13:59] against idolatry or spiritual
[1:14:01] fornication the tribe that turned to
[1:14:04] idolatry was to have its name blotted
[1:14:06] out and the history of the two tribes
[1:14:08] whose names were blotted out because of
[1:14:10] idolatry is found in first Kings 12 25
[1:14:14] to 30 so can we read that adam in
[1:14:17] malachi you're gonna get ready I'll read
[1:14:18] some - that's okay because this is a
[1:14:22] type and I added this it's not in the
[1:14:24] church age book I added this right here
[1:14:26] those are my notes when I put those
[1:14:28] those bars Africa of their calling this
[1:14:32] is a type of God's only provided place
[1:14:35] of worship
[1:14:38] first Kings 1225 now stay with me here
[1:14:44] this is a really good thought I think
[1:14:46] brother Bram places in here for a reason
[1:14:47] I I believe it'll be a blessing to you
[1:14:50] first Kings 1225 alright brother Adam
[1:14:56] Geary 25 and 26 again thank you sir
[1:15:15] alright remember this point these two
[1:15:17] are the sons of Solomon remember Rahab
[1:15:20] ohm and Jeroboam remember that okay
[1:15:23] Jeremiah Jeroboam and you know they did
[1:15:26] they have the kingdom divided now and
[1:15:27] he's got his people and he's like my
[1:15:30] we're gonna lose some of our church
[1:15:31] members right we're gonna lose some of
[1:15:34] our kingdom well look what he says
[1:15:37] Malachi can you read verse 27 look at
[1:15:39] this idolatry alright so do you catch
[1:15:59] that do you remember what the division
[1:16:02] was it was 11 tribes against Judah
[1:16:04] remember that so when they broke off
[1:16:07] it was Judah against the world in other
[1:16:09] words it was Judah against the 11 tribes
[1:16:11] right that's what it was
[1:16:13] there's northern Israel against Judah
[1:16:15] that's what it was and so Rayo boom here
[1:16:18] yeah Jeroboam is getting all nervous
[1:16:20] like my if I let these people go to
[1:16:23] church or go to the temple their hearts
[1:16:26] are gonna get turned there because
[1:16:27] they're obeying God's Word right that's
[1:16:29] where the that was God's only provided
[1:16:30] place of worship was the house of God
[1:16:32] right that's where the Ark was right if
[1:16:35] I let my people participate in worship
[1:16:39] the true worship their hearts are gonna
[1:16:41] turn back to God and they're gonna want
[1:16:43] to serve God if I let them go back to
[1:16:46] Jerusalem go hurry look at this he's all
[1:16:51] nervous he's in loose Church members so
[1:16:54] what does he try to do he tries to keep
[1:16:56] them out of God's house and no wonder I
[1:17:00] always preach on how important it is to
[1:17:02] come to church no wonder brother Branham
[1:17:04] preached so much on you must come to the
[1:17:07] house of God ray of balm gets an
[1:17:09] antichrist
[1:17:10] Jeroboam gets an antichrist spirit all
[1:17:12] I'm saying oh I don't wanna lose any
[1:17:14] church members if they go to God's
[1:17:16] provided place if they go to the temple
[1:17:17] Solomon's Temple I'm gonna lose church
[1:17:20] members because that's where lives are
[1:17:21] transformed
[1:17:23] the house of God amen because that's
[1:17:25] where the word of God is preached that's
[1:17:27] where people are healed amen that's
[1:17:29] where the people are saved that's where
[1:17:31] they're filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:17:32] if I let them get the gods provided
[1:17:35] place I'm gonna lose church members so
[1:17:38] he says I'll build idols and I'll keep
[1:17:41] them from coming to church and you and I
[1:17:43] know the same thing is happening today
[1:17:46] anything that can keep God's people out
[1:17:49] of the house of God many times is an
[1:17:51] idol right
[1:17:54] now I'm not talking about faithful live
[1:17:56] streamers or people that really hunger
[1:17:57] and would do they'd do anything to come
[1:17:59] to church on Wednesday night that those
[1:18:01] are the true Christians I'm talking
[1:18:03] about people that will first say the
[1:18:05] live streaming pretty soon they don't
[1:18:07] even watch the service pretty soon they
[1:18:09] don't even care pretty soon one service
[1:18:11] is enough and pretty soon even that's a
[1:18:12] burden are you with me because a real
[1:18:17] Christian hungers and thirsts for more
[1:18:18] of God and the Holy Ghost doesn't lead
[1:18:20] you away from the truth that leads you
[1:18:22] into more truth you see and I know I
[1:18:26] preach that a lot church but it's such
[1:18:27] an indicator of people's spirits that
[1:18:30] they have on them and brother Graham
[1:18:32] said this this is his example I did not
[1:18:34] put this in the church page book God put
[1:18:37] in the church page book hey man God did
[1:18:40] look at verse 28 whereupon the King took
[1:18:43] counsel and made two calves of gold and
[1:18:46] said to them it is too much for you to
[1:18:47] go to Jerusalem it's too hard to drive
[1:18:50] to church it's too far to go to church
[1:18:53] can you see that it's God's provided
[1:18:56] please oh don't go with those holy
[1:18:57] rollers you don't have to make all that
[1:18:59] sacrifice you know it's too far to drive
[1:19:01] the church is too much money you know
[1:19:03] your family is too big your children
[1:19:06] can't handle it you know your grandma
[1:19:08] can't handle it or your your husband or
[1:19:10] wife can't handle it you don't have
[1:19:12] enough money to do that you see they'll
[1:19:14] make any excuse not to go to God's house
[1:19:17] because that's God's house that's where
[1:19:19] judgment begins is the house of God Amen
[1:19:21] you see that this is this is the Old
[1:19:25] Testament foreshadowing the new I'll do
[1:19:28] anything to keep them out of God's house
[1:19:31] so I can keep my church members or my
[1:19:33] most say idol worshippers
[1:19:35] so I'll build a big fancy idol out of
[1:19:38] gold and I'll place it in a spot where
[1:19:41] they don't have to go to church anymore
[1:19:45] behold thy God's o Israel which brought
[1:19:47] thee up out of the land of Egypt and he
[1:19:48] set one in Bethel and the other he put
[1:19:51] in Dan and the thing became a sin for
[1:19:53] the people went to worship before the
[1:19:55] one even unto Dan can you see that I'll
[1:19:59] do anything to keep them out of the
[1:20:01] religious center of the of the church
[1:20:03] and what's the religious center today
[1:20:05] the fivefold ministry because you get
[1:20:07] perfected through the preaching of the
[1:20:08] word it's foolish to everybody else but
[1:20:10] to us it's the power of God unto
[1:20:12] salvation amen
[1:20:13] hallelujah so can everybody see that
[1:20:19] this is the star of Dan getting his name
[1:20:21] removed on the book of life what's this
[1:20:23] first thing he does he stops going to
[1:20:25] church hope everybody could understand
[1:20:29] that
[1:20:29] Jeroboam keeps them from going to church
[1:20:32] keeps them from doing their sacrifice
[1:20:33] remember God said I require every man to
[1:20:36] appear before me three times in
[1:20:38] Jerusalem and I've got scriptures where
[1:20:39] he says this God says if you can't go
[1:20:42] every if you can't go all the time no he
[1:20:44] said if you can't if the way he said the
[1:20:46] way be too far for the I'm not gonna cut
[1:20:48] up let me read it I'm just cutting it up
[1:20:50] he said the ways too far for you he said
[1:20:53] sell your animals that you're gonna come
[1:20:54] and sacrifice he said turn it into money
[1:20:57] take that money with you and then buy
[1:20:59] animals there and sacrifice the animals
[1:21:01] in Jerusalem praise God
[1:21:03] so the men had no excuse they had to go
[1:21:06] to God's house they had to give the
[1:21:08] sacrifice he made it easier said he said
[1:21:10] just hate change your money into animals
[1:21:12] and then change them back into animals
[1:21:13] you want to see it it's right in the
[1:21:15] scripture I want to show that to you
[1:21:17] because I'm not making that up that's
[1:21:18] the word of the Lord
[1:21:19] okay this Deuteronomy 14 verse 24 yes
[1:21:28] God required everybody in that nation to
[1:21:31] go to church men you got to go three
[1:21:33] times a year if you don't go I'm cutting
[1:21:36] you off hey men remember all the
[1:21:38] blessings they don't pay their tithes to
[1:21:40] pay their offerings their blessings are
[1:21:41] gonna get cut off as well oh it's such a
[1:21:44] simple system give God back to it you've
[1:21:46] got a little bit back to him and it'll
[1:21:48] bless you abundantly praise
[1:21:49] oh I've seen to be true over and over
[1:21:51] amen Jude Rodney 1424 if the way be too
[1:21:56] long for thee so that thou are not able
[1:21:58] to carry it or if the place be too far
[1:22:00] from thee which the LORD thy God shall
[1:22:02] choose a set is named there when the
[1:22:05] LORD thy God is blessed thee then stay
[1:22:07] at home and don't go to church is that
[1:22:08] what it says yeah I read that wrong
[1:22:10] didn't I every 25 if it's too hard if
[1:22:13] the animals are too heavy and it's too
[1:22:15] far stay home a church or say stay home
[1:22:18] from church no verse 25 then thou shalt
[1:22:21] turn it into money and bind up the money
[1:22:25] line hand and shout go into the place
[1:22:26] which the LORD thy God shall choose can
[1:22:31] you say amen to that
[1:22:32] and God placed his name in the temple
[1:22:36] where the where the Ark of the Covenant
[1:22:39] was because memory said I'll speak to
[1:22:41] you from above the mercy seat praise God
[1:22:43] oh my oh my this is so powerful this is
[1:22:47] to me this is my Wednesday nights are so
[1:22:48] powerful little nuggets like this get
[1:22:51] brought out brother branham brings us
[1:22:53] out this is how a name was removed
[1:22:55] Satan first got them away from church
[1:22:58] and then he set up false idols that they
[1:23:00] worshiped and then the Bible said
[1:23:03] ephraim is joined to idols as well let
[1:23:04] him alone
[1:23:05] so ephraim worshipped idols now they
[1:23:07] worship their own idols but Dan
[1:23:09] worshipped a gold calf instead of going
[1:23:12] to church my goodness so we all know
[1:23:16] there's modern-day idols don't we we all
[1:23:20] know there's modern-day Idol I saw this
[1:23:21] on Facebook and I thought this was
[1:23:23] pretty awesome I don't know about you
[1:23:24] but I'm like I'm gonna do a screen save
[1:23:27] on that picture I'm gonna say this
[1:23:28] screenshot education can be an idol
[1:23:30] right school can keep you from church
[1:23:33] your denomination this case you know
[1:23:38] anything against the donation your
[1:23:40] church can become an idol yeah our
[1:23:42] church scream anything and become an
[1:23:43] idol if you love it more than God spouse
[1:23:46] right husband or wife sports your job
[1:23:49] our job and money go together and then
[1:23:52] that wouldn't have a name but your car
[1:23:53] you know you can make any possession and
[1:23:55] I don't I just thought that was pretty
[1:23:57] good something we always think about but
[1:23:59] I just never really seen a good picture
[1:24:00] of it I thought I'd share that with you
[1:24:02] I like that very much
[1:24:05] so if they or if anyone claims to serve
[1:24:09] God but then falls away to idolatry the
[1:24:12] Bible said their names will be removed
[1:24:16] from the book of life this is a very
[1:24:17] serious thing
[1:24:18] very serious and the Bible showed the
[1:24:21] first thing was that kept them from the
[1:24:23] church and that's why we read last week
[1:24:25] where Peter said judgment begins at the
[1:24:27] house of God and if the righteous are
[1:24:30] scarcely saved who go to church how
[1:24:31] about them that don't go to church
[1:24:33] where are they going to end up that I
[1:24:34] remember we've been preaching on the
[1:24:36] fearful series the fearful unbelieving
[1:24:38] abominable see abominations again
[1:24:40] abominations and idolatry just like God
[1:24:42] said in Deuteronomy 29 murderers
[1:24:45] whoremongers the mongers just a
[1:24:47] lot of immoral sexual activity sorcerers
[1:24:52] now that's drug use too so all those all
[1:24:54] these people that are addicted to drugs
[1:24:55] that don't get the victory by the grace
[1:24:57] of God and involved in witchcraft
[1:25:00] they'll have their part of the lake of
[1:25:01] fire and idolaters and all Liars even
[1:25:04] people that lie that one thing they can
[1:25:08] lose their salvation shall have their
[1:25:10] part in the lake which burns with fire
[1:25:11] and brimstone which is the second death
[1:25:14] why did brother Branham say we need to
[1:25:15] check up every hour why would why do you
[1:25:17] think mother brand would say that every
[1:25:19] hour because of this because any Idol
[1:25:23] that enters it can expose a wrong spirit
[1:25:27] in somebody's life and could cause them
[1:25:30] to go off the same way Judas did right
[1:25:32] sell out the gospel and just for a few
[1:25:34] pennies or a few dollars south of gospel
[1:25:37] and would show that they lose all their
[1:25:39] award and actually lose eternal life not
[1:25:43] that they ever had it but they were
[1:25:44] claiming it they were claiming eternal
[1:25:46] life is that helpful by God's grace see
[1:25:50] idolatry New Testament this is the same
[1:25:52] thing God said in Deuteronomy 29
[1:25:54] abominations idolatry your name's
[1:25:56] removed it's cut out now we know this
[1:26:03] I'm getting here but but John the
[1:26:05] disciple of love he ends the book of
[1:26:07] first John by saying little children
[1:26:09] keep yourselves from idols why would he
[1:26:11] say that he said you would say that
[1:26:14] because he knew the Holy Spirit is
[1:26:16] grieved
[1:26:17] God is not number one God is not our
[1:26:19] center of worship we worship a car or he
[1:26:22] worship our education or he worship our
[1:26:24] spouse or family we love them more than
[1:26:27] we love Christ and he knew that this
[1:26:30] would be a danger and he knew their
[1:26:32] names would be removed from the book of
[1:26:33] life the same guy that did in the Old
[1:26:36] Testament he has to be the same
[1:26:38] yesterday today and forever removes it
[1:26:40] in the New Testament now go to Ephesians
[1:26:46] 5:5 I didn't have time to get all this
[1:26:52] down here and again Church I hope I hope
[1:26:57] I'm not sounding critical I'm just
[1:26:59] trying to be so sincere I'm just trying
[1:27:01] to show you how serious idolatry is the
[1:27:05] first thing that Dan did they got him
[1:27:08] away from church it's the first thing
[1:27:12] and so Ephesians 5:5 says the following
[1:27:22] alright I'm not there just give me a
[1:27:25] minute or not a minute just a few
[1:27:27] seconds okay I'm there now
[1:27:30] okay for this you know that no
[1:27:32] whoremonger nor unclean person nor
[1:27:34] covetous man who is an idolater hath any
[1:27:38] inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and
[1:27:40] of God no inheritance so see anyone who
[1:27:44] has an idol in their life they love this
[1:27:46] more than Christ they love that more
[1:27:47] than Christ they might say they love
[1:27:49] Christ but if their actions show they
[1:27:51] love that more than Christ they have no
[1:27:53] part no inheritance in heaven all right
[1:27:58] now let me close with this I got five
[1:28:01] minutes great perfect that's all I need
[1:28:03] is five minutes
[1:28:04] in 2008 I preached a sermon called
[1:28:06] dearly beloved flee from idolatry does
[1:28:09] anybody remember that anybody remember
[1:28:11] that at all alright that's nine years
[1:28:13] old
[1:28:14] well this thought came to me as I was
[1:28:15] preparing in this message I showed many
[1:28:19] brother Rams quotes about what idolatry
[1:28:21] is but never said anything that's
[1:28:27] between you and God is an idol it takes
[1:28:29] the place of God
[1:28:32] so think about our walks with God
[1:28:35] doesn't it feel awful when we feel like
[1:28:37] there's something between us and God
[1:28:38] doesn't is that an awful feeling so if
[1:28:41] that happens it means something's come
[1:28:43] between us and brother BAM calls it an
[1:28:44] idol like I just don't feel right
[1:28:47] between my walk with the Lord and the
[1:28:48] Lord and I something's come between us
[1:28:50] when Idol has come in and it could be a
[1:28:53] complex which is it could be pride it
[1:28:54] could be anything it could be the love
[1:28:56] of money it could be the love of family
[1:28:57] more than you love God like we talked
[1:28:59] about anything could come in there
[1:29:01] anything that takes the place of God is
[1:29:04] an idol the Prophet says this but Ram
[1:29:11] said God made you to be a worshiper how
[1:29:13] many know that you'll worship something
[1:29:15] regardless of what it is you'll worship
[1:29:17] your wife he said you'll worship your
[1:29:19] children you'll worship anything your
[1:29:20] automobile
[1:29:21] you'll worship your pleasure you'll
[1:29:23] worship something because it's in
[1:29:25] mankind to worship don't you know you
[1:29:28] just have to hang around people for a
[1:29:29] few minutes and you're gonna see what
[1:29:30] they worship oh my the pack I was at the
[1:29:33] airport and the Packers won the game on
[1:29:34] the last-second field goal
[1:29:40] what are they doing they're worshiping
[1:29:42] just a few hours earlier where a church
[1:29:44] we're going the same thing what were we
[1:29:47] doing worshiping amen it's the same
[1:29:50] thing it's both worship but ours was
[1:29:52] true worship you'll worship your
[1:29:56] pleasure
[1:29:59] well Graham said but when you make that
[1:30:01] your God he said that's what you're
[1:30:04] depending on he said now it's an idol
[1:30:07] when you depend on something for
[1:30:09] strength or for hope or for anything and
[1:30:11] it's not God it has to become an idol
[1:30:14] brother Graham said there's not much
[1:30:16] road on idolatry there's not many books
[1:30:18] about adultery but yet the world is full
[1:30:21] of it
[1:30:25] I gotta keep going sorry but the random
[1:30:28] said idolatry is worship placed on
[1:30:30] something other than God anything
[1:30:35] between you and God is the idol we
[1:30:37] should never do that he says okay I got
[1:30:42] one
[1:30:42] two minutes okay sorry I'm trying to
[1:30:47] finish him now the first one I always
[1:30:49] see a lot of sports because I was raised
[1:30:50] in sports but did you know this let me
[1:30:52] give you this so you can just just kind
[1:30:54] of try to try to wrap your mind around
[1:30:56] this I want to make sure I read this I
[1:31:00] haven't read this in a few years I think
[1:31:03] my wife or sister beau might be the only
[1:31:04] one that would remember this quote
[1:31:08] brother man talk about a man who loved
[1:31:10] baseball and he said he would jump up
[1:31:12] and shout at the baseball game he said
[1:31:14] he loved baseball he was a baseball
[1:31:16] fiend just like a cigarette fiend or a
[1:31:20] whiskey fiend so I just that's that's
[1:31:24] that's pretty powerful Church I know I
[1:31:26] know it's might be hard for us to
[1:31:27] understand but when you see somebody
[1:31:30] jump at a football game or basketball
[1:31:31] game they are just as much addicted to
[1:31:35] that demon power of competition or
[1:31:37] whatever pride whatever it is they're
[1:31:40] just as much addicted to that Idol as a
[1:31:43] drunk laying on the side of the street
[1:31:46] brother Ram said so they're both demons
[1:31:48] they both cause them to worship things
[1:31:51] that are not God and that's why I don't
[1:31:53] I you know I don't agree we should go to
[1:31:56] many sporting games if any at all unless
[1:31:58] it's like a little kids game we're not
[1:31:59] gonna have half-naked girls there you
[1:32:01] know and all kinds of stuff like that
[1:32:03] rock and roll playing the whole time how
[1:32:05] can the Spirit of God enjoy that it
[1:32:06] can't but he said they're just the same
[1:32:11] as a whiskey fiend or a cigarette fiend
[1:32:15] brother branham said you can make any
[1:32:17] preacher an idol did you know that and
[1:32:19] that's found in second kings 18:4
[1:32:23] okay I'm sorry I can't put up okay this
[1:32:27] is speaking of when Hezekiah remember
[1:32:31] Hezekiah he lived hundreds of years
[1:32:33] after Moses and he had to take the brass
[1:32:35] surf remember the brass serpent that
[1:32:37] Moses held up he had to take that and
[1:32:39] the
[1:32:39] Troi and smash it because the people
[1:32:41] were worshiping it though at one time
[1:32:44] people looked at this and got healed but
[1:32:46] now it became such an idol he had to
[1:32:48] destroy it is that striking something
[1:32:54] that used to be so reverent and so
[1:32:56] respectable now becomes an idol and a
[1:32:58] worship a piece of worship and he had to
[1:33:01] break it and he he said that he said
[1:33:03] Israel would take incense they would
[1:33:05] burn incense before this statue and they
[1:33:09] weren't supposed to do that but see this
[1:33:11] statue became an idol in church if we're
[1:33:14] not careful people will make brother
[1:33:15] Brandon's picture with the pillar of
[1:33:16] fire they'll make that idol they'll pray
[1:33:20] to that and though they'll think like
[1:33:22] there's some power you know from brother
[1:33:23] Branham or something like that like they
[1:33:26] exalt that above God that's the same
[1:33:30] thing that happened with the brass
[1:33:31] serpent brother BAM says the same thing
[1:33:35] and on time to get to it but let me read
[1:33:38] you how you should look at it here let
[1:33:40] me read this my time is up I just almost
[1:33:44] done I want to talk about the pillar
[1:33:47] five pillar of fire picture one more
[1:33:48] time because I've mentioned this I'm
[1:33:49] sure bows hurtness and my wife has heard
[1:33:51] this program told a story in 1954 a
[1:33:55] woman he said bought the picture of the
[1:33:57] pillar fire put it in a frame and went
[1:33:58] to a ten cent store and she had it at
[1:34:02] her desk at the hospital so she was in
[1:34:04] the hospital and she set this pillar
[1:34:06] fire picture on her desk and she was
[1:34:08] looking not at me of course but at the
[1:34:12] pillar of fire there so see she was just
[1:34:14] there at that pillar of fire in the
[1:34:16] picture not brother Branham the pillar
[1:34:18] of fire and she claims this is her
[1:34:21] testimony the doctor give her up to die
[1:34:23] she claimed the pillar of fire come out
[1:34:25] of the picture and hung over her can you
[1:34:27] imagine that tuition and two days later
[1:34:30] she was dismissed from the hospital and
[1:34:32] went home well praise God the Graham
[1:34:36] said see she just looked at that and
[1:34:38] believed now we know to look at that any
[1:34:42] other way would be idolatry brother
[1:34:44] Branham says so see even that picture we
[1:34:47] got to have such a balance if you just
[1:34:49] stare at that pillar of fire that's a
[1:34:50] good thing but if we stare a brother
[1:34:52] branham and make
[1:34:53] him the special thing about that picture
[1:34:55] then we missed the whole point we become
[1:34:57] idol worshippers a member I'm convinced
[1:35:00] Church I could be wrong in this but I'm
[1:35:01] convinced many people are gonna have
[1:35:03] their names removed from the book of
[1:35:04] life for worshiping brother Branham I'm
[1:35:07] convinced of that just like when they
[1:35:10] worship the brass serpent it just took a
[1:35:12] few generations a few generations later
[1:35:15] and now everybody's worshipping and
[1:35:17] incense to this it's an awful thing
[1:35:20] idolatry is an awful thing we don't want
[1:35:23] any idols we just want Christ as our
[1:35:26] said center of worship we don't even
[1:35:28] Christ to be an idol brother branham
[1:35:29] said you don't want to make him an idol
[1:35:31] you want to make him Lord let's stand to
[1:35:34] our feet hope that was a okay review I
[1:35:39] hope you enjoyed that by the grace of
[1:35:40] Lord I sure did and I think I'll close
[1:35:43] right there I think that was little
[1:35:55] children keep yourselves from idols and
[1:35:58] the grace of God be with you amen keep
[1:36:01] yourselves you know I look at my life
[1:36:07] and I've got to make sure that I make
[1:36:16] sure money doesn't become an idol I've
[1:36:18] got to make sure money doesn't become an
[1:36:19] idol my life like I just can't wait to
[1:36:23] the next paycheck you know I just get
[1:36:28] 5,000 saved or I get whatever safe
[1:36:30] oh that I'll be happy no money never if
[1:36:36] I was sitting father's who ever
[1:36:37] satisfied with money will not be
[1:36:38] satisfied with it it actually says that
[1:36:41] I think it's the word wealth he who must
[1:36:44] have her wealth will not be satisfied
[1:36:45] with it you'll never have enough money
[1:36:49] satisfied I've gotta watch this I've
[1:36:53] gotta watch and make sure I don't make
[1:36:55] services and ayah for example like if I
[1:36:58] don't see someone come from prayer if
[1:36:59] somebody if somebody doesn't tell me for
[1:37:00] the service they enjoy it sometimes I
[1:37:02] can I'm not careful I could make that
[1:37:04] Idol like oh I just had to hear that
[1:37:06] somebody was blessed I've got to trust
[1:37:08] Christ amen
[1:37:10] I gotta believe God I've got to make
[1:37:13] sure I'm pleasing Christ and I'm not
[1:37:15] just trying to please the people I got
[1:37:16] these crises no one's people to be happy
[1:37:20] of course I'll let them to be I want you
[1:37:21] to overcome our spiritual power houses
[1:37:23] brother right never said I would I want
[1:37:25] everybody here to be a spiritual
[1:37:26] powerhouse but I can't let fleshly
[1:37:30] things become more important than what
[1:37:32] Christ thinks I've got to care more
[1:37:35] about what Christ things than anything
[1:37:37] else I think it's something we all need
[1:37:40] to look at but I hope you can see
[1:37:42] tonight how important it is to stay away
[1:37:44] from idols the first thing the scripture
[1:37:47] records
[1:37:48] Jeroboam ascend is get them away from
[1:37:50] church get them away from God's provide
[1:37:54] a place of worship now humming oh
[1:37:55] brother have said they provide a place
[1:37:56] in worship was today he said it Jesus
[1:37:59] Christ because he said because that's
[1:38:01] where God placed his name hey man you
[1:38:04] see Jesus Christ is at the bride today
[1:38:06] right he's preaching through the bride
[1:38:08] because the spirit and the bride say
[1:38:11] come that the bride is the one inviting
[1:38:14] people to the Holy Spirit today so he
[1:38:16] can't separate really the bride from
[1:38:18] Christ in the spirit because they're all
[1:38:20] one by the spirit that's why it's so
[1:38:23] important to be in God's house I hope
[1:38:26] that's a blessing praise God let's bow
[1:38:28] our heads here as we worship in three
[1:38:30] how many father I love you tonight Lord
[1:38:33] I believe I've tried all that's within
[1:38:36] me to please you tonight I'm not trying
[1:38:38] to please the church although I want
[1:38:40] them to be happy with the word as I said
