[30:49] god
[30:58] okay so i want to spend a few minutes
[31:00] looking at a couple scriptures here
[31:04] uh there's a one thing i want to look up
[31:06] here
[31:13] i'd look at this up real quick i just
[31:14] want to get a greek okay
[31:17] great greek definition real quick
[31:22] all right
[31:23] so let's um
[31:24] look at verse five here i'm kind of
[31:27] heading back to five now i'm not gonna
[31:28] rehearse of course all chapter one
[31:31] uh but as we were looking this we saw
[31:33] how this book
[31:34] and this letter was written for the
[31:36] minds of the saints right to get in one
[31:38] accord
[31:39] uh to get in like-mindedness now
[31:41] remember they already had the baptism of
[31:43] the holy ghost
[31:44] paul was there for a short time people
[31:46] got saved born again the philippian
[31:48] jailer was saved god shook the whole
[31:51] earth i'm sorry god took the whole
[31:53] prison house and
[31:54] uh and then god cast devils out of uh
[31:57] women and and then god raised up lydia
[32:00] there in the church and they were they
[32:02] were a really holy ghost church praise
[32:04] god
[32:05] uh but they were born again and but yet
[32:08] 11 years later paul's
[32:10] you know letting them know the desire of
[32:12] the holy spirit is for everybody to be
[32:14] in one accord amen
[32:16] like-mindedness right as we saw from our
[32:19] visual this morning we need to have our
[32:21] minds constantly
[32:23] uh filled with god's word amen
[32:25] constantly if not we'll backslide away
[32:29] from the things of god we'll build up
[32:30] complexes in our lives and like with
[32:33] brother branham it almost got him out of
[32:34] position
[32:36] and that's why we'll see people that are
[32:37] born again in the message even and
[32:39] they'll actually go too far
[32:41] right they'll
[32:42] they'll they'll disobey the the gentle
[32:45] reminders of the lord the warnings of
[32:46] the lord and they'll actually get out of
[32:48] position at times
[32:50] that's true it does happen uh you see a
[32:53] in certain lives and people's situations
[32:56] where like for example a minister might
[32:58] stop preaching
[32:59] because of his own sin because of his
[33:01] own complexes right that's a very easy
[33:03] one to see
[33:05] you know where you might see like a
[33:07] person have mental trouble they call it
[33:08] mental health today but really it's just
[33:11] a mind that needs transformed
[33:13] they give it they give it the title
[33:15] mental health but really they just need
[33:17] a refilling of the holy spirit in their
[33:18] mind
[33:19] right
[33:20] it's all this mental health well i know
[33:22] how to get well in your mind
[33:24] fill your mind with god's word and
[33:26] confess all the sins so those demons
[33:28] have to leave amen that's that's how we
[33:30] deal with mental health of this church
[33:32] amen now don't get wrong counseling is
[33:34] good right yeah we all need counseling
[33:36] we have we all need to you know share
[33:38] our hearts and thoughts but really the
[33:40] problem is demons have camped out and
[33:42] set up fortresses in people's mind and
[33:45] they fail to confess them
[33:47] that's mental health
[33:48] that's that's the problem people have
[33:50] but i want to um
[33:53] remind us again paul said if there's any
[33:55] joy in christ
[33:57] i'm sorry if there's any comfort or
[33:58] consolation fulfill my joy that we be
[34:00] like-minded
[34:01] that's what i can see i can see it in
[34:03] all of our lives like we come to church
[34:05] to hear god's word we come to church
[34:07] because we're all thinking about the
[34:09] rapture amen right so i know in our
[34:11] church i feel like we're fulfilling this
[34:13] scripture people are like-minded you see
[34:15] more people coming to the evening
[34:17] service right most the time
[34:19] most the time now people get plans they
[34:21] get tired they get sick we understand
[34:23] that they get pregnant you know
[34:26] but the idea is when everybody's mind's
[34:28] in one accord it's all on christ right
[34:31] and then jesus can he can guide us he
[34:33] can help us to grow right he can he can
[34:35] unite us praise god so we can feel
[34:38] closer to him and closer to one another
[34:40] amen that's what he's trying to do he's
[34:42] trying to remember this is uniting time
[34:44] right remember brother ram said the
[34:45] fulfillment is right now he said that
[34:47] the fulfillment is the tears are binding
[34:50] in other words the tears are being
[34:51] united
[34:53] right that's that's what's
[34:54] that's fulfilled right now the tares are
[34:57] being bound they're bound first
[34:59] right but then the wheat is gathered out
[35:02] praise god
[35:03] and then the tares are burned later
[35:06] so see it's so it's it's it's their
[35:08] uniting time and it's our time to lay
[35:10] the prince of the sun waiting for that
[35:12] great uh
[35:14] the great harvester coming through
[35:16] praise god amen with this great rapture
[35:18] sickle to cut us out amen
[35:20] and take us to the heavens to meet up
[35:22] christ in the air amen but see the
[35:25] they're picking out the terrors you know
[35:26] they're binding them together right now
[35:29] but the wheat is maturing i'm so glad to
[35:31] mature in christ amen
[35:33] thank you lord and that's what's
[35:34] happening we're we're in one accord
[35:36] we're in one mind
[35:38] like i was telling sister who on
[35:39] wednesday night i was saying sister i
[35:41] look forward to seeing you on saturday
[35:43] and because i was thinking about on
[35:44] saturday but but she looked at me she
[35:46] said yeah but sunday i can't wait to see
[35:48] on sunday remember that
[35:50] i thought that's awesome like she's
[35:52] already thinking
[35:54] her mind is already on the service amen
[35:57] i thought that was a good testimony
[35:58] since i thought i kind of felt a little
[36:00] rebuked like oh help me lord
[36:03] that was great that's great that's what
[36:05] we want we all want to be thinking about
[36:06] oh the word of the lord amen the music
[36:09] of the lord the worship of the lord
[36:11] getting refreshed in his presence amen
[36:14] overcoming fear overcoming doubt and
[36:16] unbelief and being strengthened is in
[36:18] his presence praise god
[36:20] it's a one it's a unified
[36:23] spirit amongst the church praise god now
[36:26] i want to look at verse 5 let this mind
[36:28] mean you which was also in christ jesus
[36:31] now i found a good uh greek definition
[36:34] that's why i want to look look this up
[36:35] here real quick
[36:39] okay that's it
[36:43] all right now
[36:45] who being in the form of god now we know
[36:47] that's the word morphe right so he
[36:50] christ was in the form of god he thought
[36:53] it not robbery
[36:54] to be equal with god
[36:58] okay but made himself of no reputation
[37:01] and took upon him the form of a servant
[37:04] and was made in the likeness of men
[37:07] now here's the great
[37:09] understanding i think that i felt like
[37:12] well i believe it's right
[37:14] now robbery has two connotations this
[37:17] author says it could mean to grasp
[37:19] because of jesus deity it probably means
[37:22] to clutch or to hang on to at all costs
[37:26] so when we read it he thought it not
[37:28] robbery
[37:29] in other words jesus did not selfishly
[37:32] cling to equality with god
[37:34] but gave up his privileges to become
[37:37] human
[37:39] i thought that was great because let's
[37:41] go back a little bit
[37:42] he was the logos right he was the light
[37:44] that came out of the invisible god amen
[37:47] but he thought it not robbery let me
[37:49] read that again he did not just cling to
[37:52] his equality with god
[37:54] he humbled himself and the bible said he
[37:56] made himself of no reputation
[37:59] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[38:02] death even the death of the cross
[38:05] saints that light couldn't die amen how
[38:08] do you believe that amen the logos light
[38:11] couldn't die
[38:12] so he had to think it not robbery now
[38:15] this is a different we think rob like
[38:16] robbing a store but that's not what it
[38:18] means
[38:19] uh it means to clutch on to or grasp
[38:22] in other words jesus didn't grasp on to
[38:25] his equality with god
[38:27] as far as he took upon him flesh and so
[38:30] he had two parts to him brother brahm
[38:32] said he had divinity full holy ghost god
[38:36] deity supreme deity but he also took on
[38:39] humanity amen and that's what it means
[38:42] he didn't just hang on to the divinity
[38:44] he took upon humanity now that helps out
[38:47] a lot
[38:48] right that helps a lot because he he
[38:50] could have stayed and just play all
[38:52] deity all deity but he come down and he
[38:55] hid himself behind a man
[38:57] right hit himself behind a man and
[38:59] that's i thought that was such an
[39:01] important
[39:02] uh understanding
[39:05] because here's the here's the here's the
[39:07] reason i'm saying this is because and
[39:09] amen i don't know if you know this but i
[39:10] want to share this a few years ago
[39:12] brother cam i remember there was a
[39:14] little bit of a split at brother cam's
[39:15] church
[39:16] well one of the reasons why because one
[39:18] of the preachers who left took this text
[39:22] and he said see if we have the mind of
[39:25] christ then it's not robbery that we're
[39:27] equal with god
[39:29] and he said see you are equal with god
[39:33] and then he took it this far to say
[39:35] uh you're equal with god he said not
[39:38] only did god write the lamb's book of
[39:39] life he said the bride wrote the lamb's
[39:41] book of life he said you wrote the book
[39:43] of life
[39:45] and i got the sermon i still have the
[39:47] sermon on audio if you want to hear it
[39:49] and that you know
[39:51] and it it shook it shook up most of the
[39:54] people in the church
[39:55] now the the people that that
[39:57] uh the people that didn't uh i'm sorry
[40:00] the people that didn't accept it they
[40:01] stay with their camp
[40:02] but the people that agree with it most
[40:04] of them left
[40:06] and start another church
[40:07] now see how this see how this definition
[40:10] would totally do away with that
[40:12] it's not saying like uh it's not saying
[40:15] we are equal with god it's saying jesus
[40:18] chose not to just hold on to divinity he
[40:20] actually humbled that holy spirit
[40:22] humbled itself and came and lived down
[40:24] in a a body that could die
[40:28] it doesn't mean
[40:29] uh it doesn't mean robbery like we would
[40:32] say
[40:34] okay
[40:35] because yes we want the mind of christ
[40:36] how many with the mind of christ amen
[40:38] aren't you glad you got it praise god
[40:40] we need it every day we need more of the
[40:42] mind of christ right because satan's
[40:43] trials get harder but god raised up a
[40:45] standard
[40:46] harder
[40:47] harder and harder praise god all the way
[40:49] down to the end
[40:51] but see that's what happened he he made
[40:53] it he humbled himself
[40:55] so the all divine all divine one the son
[40:58] of god the logos he didn't he didn't
[41:00] hang on to all divinity he actually put
[41:02] on a part of humanity and humbled
[41:05] himself and came down
[41:07] so i hope that was a helpful thing by
[41:09] god's grace i just want to share that
[41:11] and that caused a big uh well there it
[41:14] calls the big church split and uh
[41:16] brother amen i even went and talked with
[41:17] the gentleman i sat down and i i sat
[41:19] with him uh we went to
[41:21] i think a wendy's or mcdonald's or
[41:22] something like that and i tried to talk
[41:24] him out of it and he wouldn't
[41:26] all he would admit was that uh perhaps i
[41:29] wouldn't preach it the same
[41:31] next time
[41:32] and i said brother you need to go and
[41:34] apologize to brother cam
[41:36] and so far to this day he hasn't
[41:39] uh and so you know taking those things
[41:41] church into account you know
[41:44] to me that's very close to
[41:46] that's very close to like almost uh
[41:48] blasphemy almost like
[41:50] where we say we're equal with god
[41:54] brother graham said the bible says jesus
[41:56] had the holy ghost without measure we
[41:58] have it with measure
[42:02] and so see how just see how just uh one
[42:04] little misunderstanding of the word can
[42:07] cause such confusion division
[42:10] uh and we might even say critical maybe
[42:13] a critical spirit
[42:15] now i'm just sharing that so you can see
[42:16] that that this scripture has been
[42:18] misunderstood many many times
[42:21] he was in the form of the logos but he
[42:24] thought not robbery to be equal he
[42:25] didn't hang on to that equality he
[42:27] actually took on humanity and he humbled
[42:30] himself and died right the bible said he
[42:33] was obedient unto death
[42:36] and because he did that god exalted him
[42:39] with the name above every name praise
[42:41] god hallelujah church if we can humble
[42:44] ourselves god will exalt us amen in due
[42:47] season praise the lord
[42:50] now
[42:54] we are not equal with god we have a
[42:56] portion of god but we are not equal with
[42:59] god with full
[43:01] the full eternal amount
[43:05] and as i said last week jeffersonville
[43:07] is saying brother branham was just like
[43:09] jesus in every way except the corporal
[43:11] body now that's that's almost blasphemy
[43:14] i would say
[43:15] uh it's such an awful thing to say
[43:18] uh if you have your bible uh keep your
[43:20] spot i'm gonna keep my spot but go to
[43:22] romans three just for a simple thing and
[43:24] on the same video i have it i shared it
[43:26] with brother jose this week
[43:27] um they're saying that uh
[43:30] every word's infallible they're saying
[43:32] every word of brother is infallible
[43:36] it's just impossible
[43:38] so let's just look at just a few
[43:39] scriptures here i just want to go to
[43:41] romans 3.
[43:46] and now i'm bringing this out because
[43:47] again the scripture talks about
[43:50] jesus thought it not robbery to be equal
[43:52] with god but that doesn't apply to us
[43:56] praise god
[43:57] where were you before you were here you
[43:59] were in the mind of god brother ram said
[44:01] you didn't have a soul you don't believe
[44:03] in pre-existence of souls you weren't
[44:05] like wandering or floating around in
[44:06] heaven no you were in the mind of god
[44:09] right
[44:10] and god wanted to have fellowship with
[44:11] you and when it came time you know he
[44:13] spoke the word and and sent your soul
[44:15] right from his thoughts and he sent his
[44:17] soul down when you got you were born you
[44:19] cried out and the soul entered into your
[44:21] body praise god that's how god does it
[44:24] now let me say this you do have a
[44:25] theophany in heaven
[44:28] praise god you know the bible says you
[44:29] have eternal bodies waiting in the
[44:31] heavenlies praise god but brother man
[44:33] said we didn't we weren't there we we we
[44:36] were thinking before we were here we
[44:38] weren't existing but there's a body
[44:40] waiting for us the bible says that
[44:41] there's a house waiting for us eternal
[44:43] in the heavens amen
[44:45] and paul said be sure that you'd be not
[44:47] found naked in other words don't be
[44:49] without a a theophany in other words
[44:52] live for jesus except jesus and there
[44:54] will be a theophany waiting for you
[44:56] praise god there'll be a home ready to
[44:58] receive you
[45:00] romans 3 praise god
[45:02] now i want to just read it here
[45:09] yes
[45:10] verse 12.
[45:12] well let's just read 10.
[45:14] as it is written there is none that
[45:15] righteous no not one there's none that
[45:18] understand that there's none that
[45:19] seeketh after god
[45:21] now can the bible be any more plain
[45:22] church
[45:23] there's none righteous there's none that
[45:25] seeketh after god
[45:28] they're all gone out of the way
[45:31] they're all become i'm sure they're all
[45:32] together become unprofitable there's
[45:35] none that do with good no not one praise
[45:37] god
[45:38] i know there'll be no bragging on the
[45:40] day of judgment right just bragging on
[45:42] jesus now look at verse 13 their throat
[45:44] is an open sepulcher
[45:46] that's like a open grave a stinking open
[45:49] grave as much as we hate to think about
[45:51] that that's what it's like
[45:53] like a rotting corpse with their tongues
[45:56] they have used deceit the poison of asp
[45:59] is under their lips
[46:00] whose mouth is full of cursing and
[46:02] bitterness their feet are swift to shed
[46:04] blood destruction and misery are in
[46:06] their ways and the way of peace have
[46:08] they not known
[46:10] there's no fear of god before their eyes
[46:12] now we know that that what things
[46:14] whatsoever the law saith they say to
[46:16] them who are under the law that every
[46:18] mouth look at this church every mouth
[46:20] may be stopped
[46:22] see brother brandon's not going to be
[46:23] able to paul's not going to be able to
[46:25] no one's going to be able to say that
[46:27] they were righteous of themselves amen
[46:29] god had to share it with us amen amen
[46:32] through substitutionary
[46:34] effects
[46:35] christ took our place so that we might
[46:37] receive his righteousness that every
[46:39] mouth may be stopped and all the world
[46:41] may become guilty before god see
[46:43] everybody is guilty before god
[46:45] therefore by the deeds of the law there
[46:46] shall no flesh be justified in his sight
[46:48] for by the law
[46:50] is the knowledge of sin
[46:54] and i'd love to just go down to verse 23
[46:56] being justified freely by his grace
[47:00] look at that it paints a picture we're
[47:02] all guilty we're all like dead open
[47:04] graves but by god's grace he justifies
[47:08] us freely and we're saved now
[47:11] oh there's no religion like christianity
[47:13] praise god
[47:14] where we're all like dead stinking
[47:15] corpse but then because of grace he
[47:17] makes us alive he brings us back to life
[47:20] and we take on his righteousness and his
[47:22] holiness amen
[47:25] praise god that's brother branham he
[47:26] said people are saying brother branham
[47:28] is more than a man he can create and
[47:30] jesus can look like brother branham
[47:32] he said now ever who said this i'm your
[47:34] brother jesus is your savior
[47:36] i cannot be your savior for he's already
[47:39] saved you
[47:40] now you're so close to being the truth
[47:42] there and yet so far from the truth
[47:49] brother branham could jesus look like
[47:50] you or you be jesus or something like
[47:52] that one sense of the word that's
[47:54] exactly truth another sense of the word
[47:56] is an antichrist
[47:59] that's the difference between right and
[48:00] wrong to make me the person of the lord
[48:03] jesus would be an antichrist
[48:05] for the that person the lord jesus is
[48:07] sitting at the right hand of the majesty
[48:09] on high
[48:10] and will come again in great power and
[48:12] glory but for his life that was in him
[48:15] being upon me and upon you
[48:18] you who have him it's exactly the truth
[48:20] and you become christ
[48:24] remember my message on messiah
[48:28] see the word messiah means the anointed
[48:30] one now you are if you have the holy
[48:32] spirit you become the anointed one see
[48:35] then there's all kinds of anointed ones
[48:39] praise god
[48:42] but to me as a person william branham or
[48:44] any other man or woman to be the lord
[48:46] jesus christ our savior that is an heir
[48:48] but to be anointed with his spirit which
[48:50] brings his own
[48:52] person of his life into you he said now
[48:55] you understand we are messiahs but not
[48:58] that jesus he is our father we're just
[49:00] anointed with the spirit and that's the
[49:02] reason his life
[49:04] that
[49:05] gets people see if you don't know look
[49:07] he says it right here just want to make
[49:08] it to you if you don't set and think it
[49:10] through
[49:12] it gets people to believe well this guy
[49:14] would be the messiah
[49:17] so see but i'm showing us all these
[49:19] false doctrines start with people who
[49:21] don't set and think it through they
[49:23] don't even think what they're going to
[49:25] say or preach praise god
[49:27] like brother man said why is there so
[49:29] much marriage in divorce trouble he said
[49:30] they didn't wait on god and they didn't
[49:32] read the scripture that's in marriage in
[49:34] divorce 65 february he said there's two
[49:37] reasons they don't study the scripture
[49:38] and they don't pray and wait on god amen
[49:45] so see brother abraham says he's the
[49:47] messiah and we're little messiahs
[49:50] aren't you glad to be anointed
[49:53] hallelujah
[49:55] now here's another one i want to get to
[49:56] now the bible says let me go pull up the
[49:58] scripture real quick with a scripture
[50:00] where it says we're shaped in iniquity
[50:03] let me pull it up here real quick
[50:06] oh it's psalms yeah psalms 51 5. i
[50:08] believe this is when david sinned with
[50:10] bathsheba that's right yeah verse 1 says
[50:13] it's bathsheba so
[50:15] he's repenting before god he said behold
[50:18] i was shapen in iniquity
[50:20] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[50:24] now the only way brother branham uh
[50:27] the only way he could be equal with god
[50:29] is if he'd have to be virgin born right
[50:33] so i said like this brother bran was
[50:34] different in all three ways than jesus
[50:36] christ
[50:38] praise god there's no way he was the
[50:41] same because jesus never sinned in his
[50:43] mind
[50:45] jesus never sinned in his flesh
[50:47] remember he read that uh they're swift
[50:49] to shed blood remember brother man was
[50:50] gonna go kill people
[50:52] when he was a teenager
[50:54] they're swept to go shed blood that's
[50:56] right
[50:57] but jesus never did that praise god he
[50:59] said father forgive them they don't know
[51:00] what they're doing
[51:02] praise god
[51:04] and so see the virgin birth makes jesus
[51:06] christ a new creation praise god totally
[51:10] different than anyone else who's ever
[51:12] lived on the earth amen amen
[51:14] adam was partly like him but not all the
[51:16] way
[51:20] so
[51:21] that's
[51:22] uh psalms 51 5. behold i was shaping in
[51:26] iniquity and in in sin did my mother
[51:29] conceive me now this word means uh to be
[51:32] twisted
[51:34] uh
[51:37] to be distressed
[51:39] yeah to be twisted together i guess so i
[51:42] was twisted in iniquity so like the
[51:43] bible talks about you were knit together
[51:45] in your mother's womb
[51:47] now look at that church isn't it isn't
[51:49] it striking with the other series we're
[51:50] on the mystery of iniquity
[51:54] satan is the mystery of iniquity
[51:57] and he and he tries to get into us who
[52:00] are shaped in iniquity
[52:02] but see even though we start now look
[52:04] but man said we come to the earth
[52:05] without a fighting chance
[52:08] we'd have a fighting chance on our own
[52:10] because the mystery of iniquity is
[52:12] already working in us he's already
[52:13] working iniquity in us and the iniquity
[52:15] is already in our members praise god
[52:18] we're creatures of iniquity in our flesh
[52:20] in our minds and satan's got a he's got
[52:22] a pretty easy job
[52:23] right to the unbeliever but god in his
[52:26] mercy reaches down and he gives us a
[52:29] portion of himself praise god amen he
[52:31] gives us a portion of godliness amen of
[52:34] faith and virtue and knowledge and he
[52:36] just fills us up and that empowers us to
[52:39] want to kick out all the iniquity praise
[52:41] god amen
[52:43] oh it's glorious
[52:45] so we start off our iniquities in our
[52:47] flesh right and our mind is often set on
[52:50] iniquity
[52:51] david said i was shaping iniquity and
[52:53] sin did my mother conceive me
[52:56] now brother adam reads this scripture
[52:57] from uh hebrews 6. we're not going to
[52:59] turn there but he says you'll probably
[53:01] remember it uh he says let us go on to
[53:03] perfection not laying again the
[53:05] foundations of laying on of hands and
[53:07] baptisms now i want to look at this word
[53:09] here
[53:13] uh i want to read this quote here now do
[53:15] you know there's only one way you'll
[53:17] stand the presence of god that's being
[53:19] perfect
[53:21] god cannot tolerate unholy things you
[53:24] know i so often think about that
[53:26] when i come here to church before to
[53:28] pray before service many times i cover
[53:30] my face because when i pray i remember
[53:33] brother branham said even the holy
[53:34] seraphims have two wings that cover
[53:37] their faces
[53:40] and brother says if they
[53:42] uh if they're so holy yet they have to
[53:45] humble themselves what about us
[53:48] right now i know the blood of jesus
[53:50] christ you know unites us back right and
[53:52] we have we have perfect forgiveness
[53:55] but we want to humble ourselves brother
[53:57] says we use those six wings to humble
[53:59] ourselves right
[54:00] two to cover your face two to work and
[54:03] then two to fly i can't remember all the
[54:04] three i can't remember the three now
[54:06] uh in service
[54:08] humility i can't remember the third one
[54:09] but you have two sets
[54:11] i'm sorry three sets of two wings and we
[54:14] learned from the seraphims that we've
[54:15] got to humble ourselves
[54:17] praise god
[54:19] and i think how can i think that i can
[54:20] just come into god's presence i need to
[54:23] humble myself if the holy angels who
[54:25] never sin have to humble themselves what
[54:27] about me and it helps me to humble
[54:29] myself
[54:31] bill graham said how are you going to
[54:32] stay in the presence of a holy god
[54:34] he says and you legalist how you ever
[54:37] perfect yourself when you have not one
[54:39] thing to perfect yourself with you were
[54:41] born in sin your very conception was in
[54:44] sin the very desire of you being here
[54:46] was sin you're born in sin shaken
[54:48] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[54:51] now where are you going to stand at
[54:55] he said where you sinner that said i'll
[54:56] quit smoking i'll go to heaven where are
[54:59] you lukewarm moss back so-called
[55:01] christian
[55:02] that goes around here with a long face
[55:04] saying well i belong to the church
[55:07] he said you sinner he said that's right
[55:09] unless you're born of the spirit of god
[55:11] you're lost now we know he changes that
[55:13] later
[55:14] right because he says you can be saved
[55:15] you can be justified and be saved right
[55:17] you can be sanctified and be saved see
[55:20] so he this is in 57 this is way before
[55:23] he got that revelation in 63.
[55:25] he said how are you going to heaven you
[55:26] say i never lied in my life
[55:28] oh the darling it was just an angel this
[55:31] was an angel to begin with he said
[55:33] that's a lie he said i don't care how
[55:35] good you are you're a sinner
[55:38] and you don't have one thing there's no
[55:40] priest no bishop no cardinal no pope no
[55:42] nothing else can save you because he's
[55:44] just the same boat that you're in
[55:46] we'll get into in a few minutes just the
[55:48] same he said whether he was the pope of
[55:51] rome he was born in sin shaped in
[55:52] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[55:54] born by sexual desire of a man and woman
[55:57] where are you going to get righteous out
[55:59] of that
[56:00] well his pop and mama were born the same
[56:02] way and his grandma and grandpa on back
[56:04] he said it's sin to begin with
[56:07] so probably i'm showing how we were born
[56:10] and shaped in iniquity and he says later
[56:12] we have no fighting chance
[56:15] in other words we need a deliverer we
[56:17] need someone to save us amen
[56:19] we cannot save ourselves so if you
[56:21] listen to the hebrew series i was
[56:22] listening to this morning brother madam
[56:24] is majoring on this
[56:25] this series is a major on salvation
[56:29] he just goes over more to show how there
[56:31] he goes every every uh thought he can
[56:34] bring across to show how we are not
[56:36] saved by our works we're saved by grace
[56:40] he says so you who say that this is holy
[56:43] and that is holy there's only one holy
[56:46] thing that's jesus christ the son of the
[56:47] living god who has been made perfect and
[56:50] our requirement is to be perfect now how
[56:53] are we going to be it try it yourself
[56:56] i'd hate to try to get to heaven on the
[56:58] merits of
[57:00] i was born five minutes ago and going
[57:02] out of the world right now he said i'd
[57:04] be lost
[57:05] if i never had an evil thought in my
[57:07] life if i never spoke a bad word in my
[57:09] life if i never looked at anything evil
[57:11] never thought anything evil or nothing
[57:12] i'm just as rank and black as the smutty
[57:15] walls of hell
[57:17] i'm a sinner
[57:19] now that's an interesting quote because
[57:20] later brother said all babies go to
[57:22] heaven
[57:23] right and we know he changed that
[57:24] doctrine right but brother is making the
[57:27] point here that without god's grace
[57:30] we're all destined for hell
[57:32] he said i might join the lutheran
[57:33] baptist pentecostal he said when i'm on
[57:36] the cradle role and live faithfully to
[57:37] that church until 100 years and my life
[57:40] is took and no man ever point their
[57:42] finger at me and say has he ever heard
[57:45] had as much as a bad thought i'll go to
[57:47] hell just as sure as i'm standing look
[57:49] what brother man says i'm a sinner
[57:51] that's correct i have nothing there's no
[57:53] way at all
[57:55] i could find any price to be paid
[57:58] god required death and if i gave my own
[58:01] life if i give my life then how can i
[58:03] repent because the debt has to be paid
[58:05] first and god was the only one who could
[58:08] lay his life down and take it up again
[58:11] so he could become sin and lay his life
[58:14] down and pick it up and i call it
[58:16] justice and the debt is paid there you
[58:19] are
[58:20] so i just read through that i know it's
[58:21] a long quote so bear with me but i just
[58:23] want you to show how brother ram said he
[58:25] was a sinner and he couldn't save
[58:27] himself and there's nothing he could do
[58:29] to save himself
[58:30] without god intervening to save him
[58:34] he would be lost so it takes him out of
[58:36] the way of he was not like
[58:38] jesus in any way jesus was all holy he
[58:42] was the word made flesh amen amen
[58:45] so i just want you to see that brother
[58:46] says without god's grace
[58:48] i'm a sinner and you know the quotes
[58:50] where he says i'm not infallible
[58:52] okay
[58:53] now i just want to uh start with that by
[58:55] god's grace
[58:57] now you know brother ham said he had a
[58:58] critical spirit many times remember the
[59:00] woman with the purple lipstick in ohio
[59:02] with the cops
[59:05] remember that story
[59:09] brother random walked in and there's two
[59:11] so there was two cops abusing the woman
[59:13] so flirting with her
[59:15] and brother man walked in the bathroom
[59:16] and said god how can you put up with
[59:18] this trash
[59:20] why does my rebecca and sarah have to
[59:22] grow up with all this trash
[59:27] and then remember how god showed brother
[59:28] branham a vision how do you remember
[59:29] what i'm talking about
[59:31] i'll read a little bit of it here
[59:34] he said oh god how can you look at such
[59:35] stuff as that my little sarah and
[59:37] rebecca have to grow up in a be in a
[59:39] world like that why don't you just
[59:41] destroy the whole thing and take it off
[59:42] i don't see how you can stand it to look
[59:44] as such as that and i was standing there
[59:46] criticizing her
[59:49] he said i went back he said and it kind
[59:52] of got dark in the corner and god gave
[59:54] me a vision and changed my mind
[59:57] he said i saw a world and around the
[1:00:00] world looked like a red streak just to
[1:00:01] spray
[1:00:03] and something said this is the blood of
[1:00:05] jesus who died to save sinners that's
[1:00:07] the reason that god can't destroy he
[1:00:09] can't see her now look at that he can't
[1:00:11] see her he can't every mortal being has
[1:00:15] a right has a right to accept their
[1:00:16] salvation until they die and go beyond
[1:00:19] that blood
[1:00:22] they don't have to stand the judgment
[1:00:23] they're already judged the day either of
[1:00:26] the day you die but as long as you're
[1:00:27] here you got a right to the tree of life
[1:00:29] if you if you'll accept it
[1:00:32] and then i looked above it there the
[1:00:34] blood the bro the blood ring and there's
[1:00:36] to the lord jesus and i've seen his
[1:00:38] thorns on his head and blood running
[1:00:40] down his face
[1:00:41] and big mockery spit over his precious
[1:00:44] beard now that's probably gross to think
[1:00:46] about tonight but remember try to
[1:00:47] picture that spit all over his beard
[1:00:53] and he was jerking his head like that
[1:00:54] every once in a while jumping like that
[1:00:57] i thought what is it my lord and he said
[1:00:59] that's your sin
[1:01:02] now brother branham your sin
[1:01:04] brother man's sin was jerking the head
[1:01:06] of jesus and he's got spit in his beard
[1:01:08] and he's got a crown of thorns on
[1:01:12] and then i seen the blood of the lord
[1:01:13] jesus to my own sins was acting like a
[1:01:16] bumper
[1:01:18] if i'd went beyond that stream of blood
[1:01:19] there and around the earth when he died
[1:01:22] to settle the same question if i went
[1:01:24] beyond that then god would have killed
[1:01:25] me just like a bumper to the car to keep
[1:01:28] your car from being hurt the bumper
[1:01:30] catches the lick the blood of jesus
[1:01:32] catches your sins amen
[1:01:35] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:01:36] they're doing he says
[1:01:38] and i looked there and my name was lying
[1:01:41] on an old book wrote with all kinds of
[1:01:43] things
[1:01:43] condemned
[1:01:45] so brother adam had a book and it was
[1:01:47] written condemned on it and i crawled up
[1:01:49] to his feet and i said lord jesus will
[1:01:51] you forgive me i didn't mean
[1:01:55] and i said you mean my sins hurt you
[1:01:57] like that and jesus said yes
[1:02:02] he took his hand and dipped it in his
[1:02:03] side took his fingers and wrote across
[1:02:06] the book and said pardoned put it behind
[1:02:09] him like that put his arms together
[1:02:11] looked at me and said i forgive you
[1:02:13] didn't i i said yes lord i love you for
[1:02:16] he said but why are you condemning her
[1:02:18] then you're willing to condemn someone
[1:02:22] else but look you was condemned once
[1:02:24] yourself and freely i pardoned you
[1:02:28] that changed my motive
[1:02:31] he said as soon as i came out of the
[1:02:32] vision he said lady i want to ask you
[1:02:34] will you forgive me for having such
[1:02:36] thoughts towards you
[1:02:38] now look are those words infallible when
[1:02:40] he was condemning them no no
[1:02:43] god was merciful
[1:02:48] she said certainly son will you pray for
[1:02:50] me that i'll be saved and i said we'll
[1:02:51] need will you kneel down here and she
[1:02:53] said i will we turn that place into a
[1:02:55] prayer meeting amen glory that's right
[1:02:58] the woman got saved see god will provide
[1:03:00] money god will provide he's already
[1:03:02] provided a way of escape for everyone
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] all right praise god i just want to
[1:03:08] bring that out by god's grace hope
[1:03:10] that's okay i just want to bring that as
[1:03:11] a little bit of reminder
[1:03:13] about being equal with god you know what
[1:03:16] like brother madam said they're going to
[1:03:17] try to make an image under the prophet
[1:03:19] in the last days but we will not bow to
[1:03:21] that praise god
[1:03:23] we'll bow to christ
[1:03:25] now let's go to verse
[1:03:27] uh 12
[1:03:29] philippians 2 12.
[1:03:36] so paul's talking about now let's get
[1:03:38] back to the humbling of christ christ
[1:03:40] humbled himself
[1:03:42] the greatest became the least and then
[1:03:44] he went back to the greatest a name
[1:03:45] that's given above every name
[1:03:49] verse 12 wherefore my beloved as you
[1:03:51] have always obeyed not in my presence
[1:03:53] only but now much more in my absence
[1:03:55] work out your own salvation with fear
[1:03:58] and trembling
[1:04:00] remember this is the church of lydia
[1:04:02] this is the church of the philippian
[1:04:03] jailer right
[1:04:05] it says work out your salvation with
[1:04:07] fear and trembling
[1:04:09] not that not to get saved right because
[1:04:11] we know they're already saved but to
[1:04:13] apply the salvation
[1:04:15] right to apply the word to your life
[1:04:18] you're already saved right but you say
[1:04:20] work it out for your full
[1:04:23] obedience to christ
[1:04:25] praise god
[1:04:27] see church that's why we got to come
[1:04:28] many times with fear and trembling to
[1:04:30] the house of god
[1:04:32] right
[1:04:33] that's why brother brown would say
[1:04:34] they're popping chewing gum they're
[1:04:35] drinking coffee they're
[1:04:37] they're not taking this as seriously as
[1:04:39] they need to take it
[1:04:42] he says work it out with fear and
[1:04:43] trembling verse 13 for it is god which
[1:04:46] worketh in you both to do
[1:04:48] well to will and to do
[1:04:50] of his good pleasure now look at that in
[1:04:52] other words god will work through you
[1:04:54] when you have the right attitude
[1:04:57] when you are in fear and troubling when
[1:04:59] you're sincere before the lord then god
[1:05:01] is going to work through you
[1:05:03] but he can't work through you unless you
[1:05:04] got the right attitude praise god
[1:05:08] verse 14 do all things without
[1:05:10] murmurings
[1:05:12] and disputings so god doesn't want to
[1:05:14] hear complaining and god doesn't want to
[1:05:16] hear criticizing of others
[1:05:19] you got to correct somebody that's
[1:05:20] different right if they need to be
[1:05:21] corrected
[1:05:23] but he says let's make sure we don't
[1:05:24] complain
[1:05:25] for our selfishness and then attack
[1:05:27] other people in the body of christ
[1:05:29] remember this is all about being in one
[1:05:31] mind
[1:05:32] like-minded how can everybody in our
[1:05:34] church be like-minded this is the way
[1:05:36] right here humble ourselves
[1:05:39] search it out with fear and trembling
[1:05:42] i like what he said take upon the form
[1:05:43] of a servant be come to church thinking
[1:05:46] how can i serve people
[1:05:47] who can i serve here
[1:05:51] praise god
[1:05:55] thank you lord
[1:05:57] next verse
[1:05:58] verse 15
[1:05:59] that ye may be blameless
[1:06:01] and harmless the sons of god without
[1:06:04] rebuke in the midst of a crooked and
[1:06:06] perverse nation
[1:06:08] among whom ye shine
[1:06:09] as light
[1:06:11] in the world church have you ever if we
[1:06:13] ever saw a cricket and perverse nation
[1:06:15] it's right now
[1:06:16] right have we ever seen it on this level
[1:06:19] no we've never seen it on this level the
[1:06:21] crookedness and the perverseness
[1:06:24] of all the rioters right many most
[1:06:26] politicians
[1:06:28] crooked and perverse lying as we saw
[1:06:31] this morning
[1:06:34] so we must stand out we must stand out
[1:06:36] as a light to the world
[1:06:39] in the midst of this crooked and
[1:06:40] perverse nation and we do that by
[1:06:43] refrain being thankful right not
[1:06:44] complaining and not disputing
[1:06:47] verse 16 holding forth the word of life
[1:06:52] that i may rejoice in the day of christ
[1:06:58] that i have not run in vain neither
[1:07:00] labored in vain
[1:07:03] look what he's saying he's like please
[1:07:04] don't waste my efforts
[1:07:06] please don't let my preaching be in vain
[1:07:09] remember church he hadn't seen him for
[1:07:11] 11 years
[1:07:12] it's been a while since he heard this
[1:07:14] prophet it's been a long time
[1:07:17] so look at the look at the uh look at
[1:07:20] the effect of one visit look what one
[1:07:22] visit a preacher can do
[1:07:24] like when cam or brother brooks will
[1:07:25] come or
[1:07:26] all of our other precious brothers look
[1:07:28] at the value of one visit to a local
[1:07:30] church
[1:07:34] that just shocked me right there
[1:07:36] the value of one time i remember i
[1:07:38] preached up in maine one time with amen
[1:07:40] uh
[1:07:42] brother mike chinister said i just feel
[1:07:43] led to fly up there i'm like okay
[1:07:44] brother let's go up there so we flew up
[1:07:46] there i preached on the saturday night
[1:07:48] boy there was a rough spirit on that
[1:07:50] sunday morning i was the people were
[1:07:51] free
[1:07:52] and afterwards we prayed for a few
[1:07:54] people i went in the office and the
[1:07:55] pastor's sister she was in her 60s she
[1:07:58] come up and weeping brother amen and she
[1:08:00] said thank you for coming i'll never be
[1:08:01] the same amen
[1:08:03] i didn't hear you praise god that's just
[1:08:06] one trip and that's why mike was led to
[1:08:08] the lord
[1:08:09] to go up there
[1:08:12] and now see to me that was totally worth
[1:08:14] it just leaving a whole weekend i barely
[1:08:16] got any sleep you know we got there late
[1:08:17] and then the planes were delayed in
[1:08:19] boston
[1:08:21] we had to rent a hotel for like four
[1:08:23] hours and wasted like 250 bucks on one
[1:08:25] hotel for one night it was a total waste
[1:08:27] of money
[1:08:28] as far as the world is concerned but
[1:08:29] it's a great sacrifice in god's eyes
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:32] but see one trip of one visit a one
[1:08:35] minister
[1:08:39] god is trusting that him sending that
[1:08:41] person to the church that the church
[1:08:44] will keep what was preached that many
[1:08:46] years ago
[1:08:47] in other words let's not forget what
[1:08:49] we've heard let's remember those great
[1:08:51] services let's not forget what was
[1:08:53] preached because what the answer for and
[1:08:55] we want to become what god was calling
[1:08:58] us to become back there amen amen
[1:09:02] now church for as a pastor that's my
[1:09:03] desire to i want everybody to hold forth
[1:09:05] the word of life that i haven't preached
[1:09:07] and pastored in vain
[1:09:10] right
[1:09:11] and we want to live so that brother
[1:09:13] graham's ministry wasn't in vain
[1:09:15] that there will be a bride who's ready
[1:09:18] there will be a bride who makes yourself
[1:09:19] ready for christ coming amen
[1:09:22] that it wasn't in vain here it was
[1:09:24] valuable here it was a real good
[1:09:26] investment here in akron ohio
[1:09:30] what do we do we hold forth the word of
[1:09:32] life
[1:09:35] i want to make brother brooks rejoice on
[1:09:37] that day
[1:09:38] i want my life to make brother branham
[1:09:40] rejoice on that day
[1:09:42] all the wonderful preachers we had come
[1:09:44] in i want to live in such a way that
[1:09:46] they rejoice on that day
[1:09:48] that god sent his word god sent the
[1:09:50] brother from indiana or god said the
[1:09:52] brother from louisiana uh like my wife's
[1:09:54] testimony right
[1:09:56] god said bro brother joe uh all the way
[1:09:59] from louisiana to lima to say sister
[1:10:02] that's the devil right
[1:10:04] so my wife could get victory over
[1:10:05] postpartum depression
[1:10:07] and now each time now she got a victory
[1:10:09] there and now each time she's able to
[1:10:11] take that and battle that because she
[1:10:12] knows what it is
[1:10:14] but god god thought so much of it he
[1:10:16] sent him up all the way from louisiana
[1:10:17] to iowa i'm sorry
[1:10:18] ohio
[1:10:20] that's how church that's how much god
[1:10:22] thinks of preachers praise god that's
[1:10:24] how much he thinks of the word of god
[1:10:26] he'll send somebody around the world
[1:10:27] praise god just to you amen you'll send
[1:10:30] someone across the country just to
[1:10:32] deliver you the word of god amen
[1:10:34] but then he expects you to live it
[1:10:36] right he expects you
[1:10:38] to make the most of it
[1:10:40] don't forget what was preached
[1:10:43] oh i love it
[1:10:44] praise god amen
[1:10:48] verse 17.
[1:10:51] in other words
[1:10:52] our lives
[1:10:54] validate the ministry that god sent us
[1:10:57] it proves it was the right ministry
[1:10:59] and we don't want anyone to lose their
[1:11:01] reward do we
[1:11:03] because we'll lose our rewards maybe we
[1:11:05] don't lose our souls of course but we
[1:11:07] want to live in such a godly way
[1:11:08] remember what was preached
[1:11:11] live it
[1:11:12] so that the preaching wasn't in vain
[1:11:19] church what what good would it have been
[1:11:21] for god to shake that prison house
[1:11:24] save the jailer do all these miracles
[1:11:27] and then they all go back into the world
[1:11:28] what good have that been no good
[1:11:30] right
[1:11:32] so again it places the salvation and the
[1:11:35] the baptism of the holy ghost in such a
[1:11:37] high esteem praise god
[1:11:39] now that the greatest miracle that can
[1:11:41] happen is someone to be fully committed
[1:11:43] permanently in the kingdom of god
[1:11:46] not temporary permanently i never set my
[1:11:48] timer
[1:11:50] you're good people nobody stood up to
[1:11:52] correct me on that one
[1:11:54] let me uh
[1:11:56] how long have i been preaching lydia
[1:12:00] okay okay give me five minutes
[1:12:06] see we don't want to lose our reward
[1:12:07] church
[1:12:09] and we can't help but people leave right
[1:12:11] we just can't help and we do all we all
[1:12:13] we can do we do all we can do to try to
[1:12:14] bring them back right
[1:12:16] but we are the ones who have to receive
[1:12:18] the word
[1:12:19] and run the race for christ verse 17 yay
[1:12:22] and i if i be offered upon the sacrifice
[1:12:25] and service of
[1:12:27] your faith
[1:12:30] paul's a sacrifice for who for their
[1:12:32] faith
[1:12:34] jesus was looking who can i make a
[1:12:36] sacrifice to raise their faith ah choose
[1:12:39] paul
[1:12:40] paul will be the sacrifice
[1:12:42] he will sacrifice everything he was
[1:12:44] doing he'll sacrifice his family right
[1:12:46] now he wasn't married but you know his
[1:12:48] regular family he'll sacrifice
[1:12:50] everything he loved and i will call him
[1:12:52] to go on missionary trips i'll make him
[1:12:54] the sacrifice that you yet your faith
[1:12:56] can be encouraged
[1:12:59] if i be offered upon the sacrifice and
[1:13:01] service of your faith i joy
[1:13:04] and rejoice with you all
[1:13:09] most of us have never seen an animal
[1:13:10] sacrifice have you now some of us have
[1:13:12] seen animals die right
[1:13:14] you ever see a joyful animal sacrifice
[1:13:17] you ever see an animal that likes to die
[1:13:19] no
[1:13:20] but see god's altar is different
[1:13:23] remember paul said present your bodies a
[1:13:25] living sacrifice
[1:13:28] and so paul says i jesus chose me to be
[1:13:31] on the altar of sacrifice for your faith
[1:13:35] and he says i do it with joy now that's
[1:13:38] that's quite a testimony
[1:13:40] in other words i've sacrificed my life
[1:13:42] but i have joy because i know jesus
[1:13:44] christ is strengthening you
[1:13:49] that's beautiful church you don't hear
[1:13:50] much preaching like that right we don't
[1:13:52] these these usually aren't the main
[1:13:53] texts right like
[1:13:55] revelation 10 7
[1:13:57] luke 17 30 malachi 4 5 and 6 which
[1:14:00] they're all great texts
[1:14:02] but here he's saying i am i become the
[1:14:04] sacrifice for your faith
[1:14:10] verse 18 the same cause also do you joy
[1:14:13] and rejoice with me
[1:14:15] so see they should rejoice thank god god
[1:14:17] gave us a sacrifice god gave us a
[1:14:19] minister to minister god's word and
[1:14:22] raise our faith amen
[1:14:24] praise god
[1:14:25] verse 19 but i trust in the lord jesus
[1:14:28] to send timotheus shortly unto you that
[1:14:30] i may be also or maybe of good comfort
[1:14:33] when i know
[1:14:34] your state
[1:14:37] now look at this again verse 20 for i
[1:14:39] have no man like minded
[1:14:43] who will naturally care
[1:14:45] for your state
[1:14:50] remember this was all about verse two
[1:14:51] five and seven in this chapter it's all
[1:14:54] about having the same mind
[1:14:57] so it's the revelation of being in one
[1:14:58] accord for service and ministry not just
[1:15:01] for receiving the holy ghost but for
[1:15:03] continued ministry in the holy ghost
[1:15:06] that i become a servant take the mind of
[1:15:08] christ humble yourself become a servant
[1:15:11] and that's the all the mindset that's
[1:15:12] the mindset each one of us have to
[1:15:14] receive
[1:15:16] humble myself so i can sacrifice my life
[1:15:19] to serve other people
[1:15:27] verse 21 for all seek their own not the
[1:15:30] things
[1:15:32] which are jesus christ well guess what
[1:15:33] you're the all right i'm the all how
[1:15:35] many are all
[1:15:37] we're all we're all in the all
[1:15:40] see we're all selfish right we all seek
[1:15:42] our own but paul's saying
[1:15:43] be a sacrifice
[1:15:46] think the same think like me think like
[1:15:48] timothy
[1:15:50] think on the things of what does jesus
[1:15:52] christ want done on this sunday
[1:15:54] what does jesus christ want done
[1:15:55] tomorrow
[1:15:56] praise god
[1:15:59] verse 22 but ye know the proof of him
[1:16:01] that as a son with the father he has
[1:16:03] served with me in the gospel
[1:16:06] let's look how malcolm's my son right
[1:16:08] look how he always does what i tell him
[1:16:09] to do
[1:16:10] always i'll say malcolm go get this say
[1:16:13] malcolm go get that mountain i type that
[1:16:14] in there right
[1:16:16] that's how that's how timothy was with
[1:16:17] paul whatever the prophet said let's do
[1:16:20] it praise god
[1:16:22] amen glory
[1:16:24] see he said they have this father-son
[1:16:27] relationship
[1:16:28] the preacher preached the word we
[1:16:30] believed it we acted upon it
[1:16:33] we did what he said
[1:16:36] that's the unity god wants for all of us
[1:16:38] church
[1:16:40] him therefore i hope to send presently
[1:16:42] so soon as i shall see how it will go
[1:16:45] with me remember he wasn't sure am i
[1:16:46] going to get out of prison or not
[1:16:48] now of course he did
[1:16:50] verse 24 but i trust in the lord that i
[1:16:52] also myself shall come shortly yet i
[1:16:54] suppose it necessary to send unto you
[1:16:57] epiphanitis now this is the one i want
[1:16:59] to look up here
[1:17:04] look at this man upper for eyes there's
[1:17:05] my five minutes
[1:17:07] epiphanies you know this means in the
[1:17:09] greek lovely
[1:17:11] his name means lovely
[1:17:13] yeah i thought it necessary to send to
[1:17:15] you lovely my brother
[1:17:19] and companion in labor and fellow
[1:17:22] soldier
[1:17:23] but your messenger
[1:17:26] so see paul was the prophet
[1:17:28] and he needed a messenger to get a
[1:17:30] message to the fl the church in philippi
[1:17:32] so he sent epiphanitis
[1:17:36] and he that ministered to my wants
[1:17:38] so he was taking care of the prophet's
[1:17:40] needs food clothing shell no not shelter
[1:17:43] that was a prison but any knees he could
[1:17:45] get into the prison that was
[1:17:46] epiphanist's job
[1:17:49] now look what he thought about the
[1:17:51] church
[1:17:52] for he longed after you all
[1:17:55] and was full of heaviness
[1:17:57] because that he had he had heard i'm
[1:17:59] sorry he had heard that he had been sick
[1:18:02] now look at that is that isn't that the
[1:18:04] love we have oh i longed to see brother
[1:18:06] cam right oh i longed to see brother joe
[1:18:09] see longing for saints in other churches
[1:18:13] you longed to be with them
[1:18:15] but then he heard i'm sorry but then
[1:18:17] they heard he was sick for indeed he was
[1:18:19] sick and i unto death but god look at
[1:18:22] this god had mercy on him
[1:18:25] see church when god heals you it's his
[1:18:27] mercy
[1:18:28] god healed sister who is dead that's
[1:18:30] god's mercy
[1:18:33] so epiphanist was going to die but paul
[1:18:35] said god had mercy on him
[1:18:40] not on him only but look on me also and
[1:18:43] i think from yesterday god had mercy on
[1:18:45] your mom sisterhood too
[1:18:47] right and she was uh crying and just
[1:18:49] saying how hard it was not to see her
[1:18:50] husband for two weeks because he
[1:18:52] because of covet
[1:18:54] god not only had mercy on him but god
[1:18:56] had mercy on his wife
[1:18:58] see when god heals somebody it's not
[1:19:00] just for that person it's for other
[1:19:02] believers as well
[1:19:05] but on me also lest i should have sorrow
[1:19:08] upon sorrow look at that god will heal
[1:19:10] somebody on the brink of death just so
[1:19:12] you're not so sad
[1:19:15] praise god
[1:19:16] i mean we all got to die eventually
[1:19:18] right unless we go in the rapture but if
[1:19:19] not we're all going to die eventually
[1:19:22] but yet god will postpone it just so
[1:19:24] you're not so sad
[1:19:26] oh isn't that god isn't that merciful
[1:19:28] god
[1:19:30] no he'll let somebody get right to the
[1:19:31] brink of death and then snatch him back
[1:19:34] just so you're not so sad for a while
[1:19:38] oh god is so gracious
[1:19:40] i set him therefore the more carefully
[1:19:42] that when you see him again you may
[1:19:44] rejoice that i may be the less sorrowful
[1:19:47] receive him therefore in the lord with
[1:19:50] all gladness
[1:19:52] and hold him
[1:19:53] such i'm sorry and hold such in
[1:19:56] reputation
[1:19:58] because for the work of christ he was
[1:20:00] dying to death
[1:20:01] not regarding his life to supply your
[1:20:05] lack of service toward me
[1:20:07] let's stand to our feet
[1:20:09] now you're going to see this later the
[1:20:11] church in philippi they missed a chance
[1:20:12] to help paul in prison
[1:20:14] but later when they got the second
[1:20:16] chance they took on that chance to help
[1:20:19] them out
[1:20:21] may god uh help us
[1:20:23] to learn a lesson from that oh wait i
[1:20:25] didn't get the chance to witness to that
[1:20:27] friend
[1:20:28] god give me another chance to witness to
[1:20:29] that friend i didn't get a chance to
[1:20:31] pray for the person god give me another
[1:20:33] chance to pray for the person that's
[1:20:35] what was happening here
[1:20:42] and church that's one thing i'm thankful
[1:20:43] for you as a church you receive god's
[1:20:46] preachers with gladness
