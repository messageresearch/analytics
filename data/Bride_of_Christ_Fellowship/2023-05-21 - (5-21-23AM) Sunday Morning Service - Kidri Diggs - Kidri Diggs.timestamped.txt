[38:30] verse
[38:33] verse 11.
[38:37] Jeremiah 29 and 11. the Bible says
[38:40] for I know the thoughts that I think
[38:43] toward you saith the Lord thoughts of
[38:45] peace and not of evil to give you an
[38:49] expected end
[38:51] then shall ye call upon me and ye shall
[38:55] and you shall go and pray unto me and I
[38:58] will hearken unto you and ye shall seek
[39:02] me and find me when ye shall search for
[39:06] me with all your hearts and I will be
[39:10] found of you save the Lord and I will
[39:13] turn away your captivity
[39:15] and I will give and I will gather you
[39:19] from all the nations and from the places
[39:22] where the
[39:23] I have driven you saith the Lord I will
[39:26] bring you
[39:28] again into the place once I cause you to
[39:31] be carried away
[39:34] amen let's let's go to um Romans I mean
[39:37] second Corinthians chapter 10.
[39:40] second Corinthians
[39:42] chapter 10
[39:59] um
[40:01] let's just read um
[40:06] let's read verse 5.
[40:08] let's start at verse four for the
[40:10] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[40:12] But Mighty through God through the
[40:15] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[40:18] imagination and every High thing that
[40:21] exalted itself
[40:24] against the knowledge of God and
[40:26] bringeth unto a captivity every thought
[40:30] to The Obedience of Christ may the Lord
[40:33] a blessed reading of his word you can
[40:34] have your seats
[40:37] amen
[40:43] you know and uh um as your sitting
[40:49] I just want I just want to kind of
[40:53] quote out of um
[40:57] um
[40:57] Genesis chapter 17.
[41:00] what God Said to Abraham
[41:04] he told Abraham in uh verse
[41:07] verse 6. he says I will make thee
[41:10] exceedingly fruitful and I will make
[41:12] nations of thee and King shall come out
[41:16] of thee and I will establish my Covenant
[41:18] between me and thee and thy seed after
[41:22] thee in their generations for an
[41:26] Everlasting Covenant to be a god
[41:30] unto thee and to thy seed after thee and
[41:34] I will give unto thee and to thy seed
[41:37] after thee the land where wherein thou
[41:41] art a stranger
[41:42] all the land of Canaan for
[41:45] an everlasting possession and I will be
[41:48] their God Amen praise the Lord look like
[41:51] a little like a powerful promise amen
[41:54] amen
[41:55] you know um by the grace of God I desire
[41:58] your prayers but today by by God's grace
[42:02] I want to use for a subject living in
[42:05] your reality
[42:06] living in your reality and you know if
[42:11] we just if we just take the word of God
[42:13] first things first
[42:15] you know in Jeremiah God says I know the
[42:18] plan I have for you
[42:20] see nobody can change that
[42:23] no circumstance no situation first
[42:26] things first
[42:27] we want to talk about our reality we
[42:30] want to talk about our situation our
[42:32] life you as an individual not us as a
[42:35] church you as an individual now if you
[42:38] ask yourself right now in this moment
[42:40] are you living in your reality
[42:43] amen amen you know in reality has to
[42:48] coincide with God's plan
[42:50] because when we deal reality it speaks
[42:53] of Truth amen so anything that doesn't
[42:56] reflect truth is not of God you don't
[43:00] look at your life right now you know you
[43:01] say well brother Jesus I'm going through
[43:03] a trial but is that the truth does that
[43:05] Define who you are or is that something
[43:08] God's using you to get you into your
[43:11] reality
[43:12] because our reality is the word of God
[43:15] Amen because that's our truth amen and
[43:19] you know when I when I when I look in
[43:20] the in the in the word of God
[43:22] you know and I begin to think about uh
[43:25] Jeremiah he says I know the plans that I
[43:27] have for you thoughts of peace
[43:30] that should be your reality this morning
[43:33] amen and you know uh these thoughts come
[43:37] by experience Hallelujah you know God
[43:40] had to deal with me and you know and you
[43:42] think about the things that you be
[43:43] worried about uh or kind of upsets you
[43:46] or you you're trying to put things in
[43:48] place to take care of us and take care
[43:50] of that but God's plan is the thoughts
[43:53] of Peace amen so what we ought to do we
[43:56] ought to put these things back on God
[43:58] Amen Hallelujah
[44:00] whatever's troubling you put it back on
[44:03] God
[44:04] whatever standing in your way put it
[44:07] back on God hallelujah because my life
[44:10] is according to his plan
[44:13] Hallelujah peace and not of evil
[44:18] so brother Dixon I don't pay this bill
[44:21] they gonna take my house evil is not a
[44:25] part of my plane amen hallelujah lack
[44:29] you know sickness poverty all these
[44:32] things is not a part of my plan that's
[44:35] not a part of my reality Hallelujah
[44:38] amen you know and you know as I look in
[44:42] you know and we we we we read the
[44:45] scripture let's go back to Jeremiah
[44:47] chapter 29.
[44:49] you know this this is a powerful
[44:52] um
[44:53] verse of scripture
[44:55] you know because it it deals with uh God
[44:59] distinctly you know uh it shows how God
[45:03] is Not wishy-washy
[45:06] you know we we we have to take him at
[45:09] his word
[45:10] you know he says for I know the thoughts
[45:13] I have concerning the thoughts of peace
[45:17] and not of evil to give you an expected
[45:21] ends see God already knows how things
[45:24] are supposed to end
[45:27] the problem is now we're God reality is
[45:31] not with God when we look at things and
[45:34] and what hinders our reality our
[45:37] imagination
[45:41] and your imagination can be something
[45:43] good or it could be something misplacing
[45:47] your reality all right and most of the
[45:50] time our reality our imagination stands
[45:53] in the way of our truth hallelujah and
[45:56] you know what we do is see how do we get
[45:58] sick or certain things happen and we
[46:00] start to imagine
[46:02] you know if I don't take care of this
[46:03] gonna happen the greatest detriment to
[46:06] our imagination is this thing called
[46:08] Google
[46:13] Hallelujah
[46:14] because as soon as something that's
[46:16] starting to happen we don't run to the
[46:18] word of God we run to Google
[46:22] what does Google say what does this say
[46:24] what does that say and what's happening
[46:26] it's activating your imagination to run
[46:30] away with your thoughts to run away or
[46:33] to run away from your reality
[46:37] Hallelujah Google is not the son of the
[46:40] law
[46:42] [Applause]
[46:44] so I don't make Google a part of my
[46:46] reality
[46:47] Hallelujah
[46:49] I I use Google as a MapQuest
[46:54] yeah
[46:55] but the reality of my travels is being
[46:58] here is accurate
[47:00] see there's something I have to do to
[47:02] get to that place amen I have to believe
[47:05] the truth of the matter
[47:07] but a lot of times your imagination
[47:09] that's why the Bible says casting down
[47:12] imagination Hallelujah casting down
[47:15] imagination in every High thing that
[47:18] exalt itself against the knowledge of
[47:21] God
[47:21] see what what is your what's hindering
[47:24] you from living in your imagination
[47:26] anything that comes against what God
[47:29] already said
[47:31] anything that comes against the
[47:34] knowledge of God and then the Bible says
[47:36] who's gonna give God knowledge
[47:39] who's gonna give God wisdom who's going
[47:41] to give God increase Hallelujah nobody
[47:45] nothing can give you knowledge
[47:48] amen so there's not anything out there
[47:51] that can stand against God's plan
[47:55] Hallelujah but what we have to do is
[47:57] cast down reasons
[48:00] amen and live in our reality Hallelujah
[48:04] when we think of uh uh the word that God
[48:07] has said he says and we keep going in
[48:09] Jeremiah he says uh to give you an
[48:13] expected end see God is expecting
[48:15] something amen
[48:17] amen see the whole journey down here is
[48:19] God trying to place us in our reality
[48:23] before we before we came into this
[48:25] message we were living a a life that was
[48:29] not according to God's plan
[48:32] and I'm not just talking about a group
[48:34] of people calling himself the message of
[48:36] the hour no I'm talking about the plan
[48:38] of God for your life
[48:40] Hallelujah and we all everyone in this
[48:43] room God has a plan for your life that's
[48:46] going to bring you to an expected end
[48:50] what is that expected in what God has
[48:54] already saw for you before the
[48:56] foundation of the world
[48:58] and nobody can change that again who's
[49:02] gonna give God knowledge
[49:04] who's gonna tell God which door should
[49:07] be open which door should be cold no God
[49:10] is the one bringing all of us to our own
[49:14] living reality
[49:17] Hallelujah
[49:21] despite what the enemy may do What the
[49:23] enemy may say amen God already knows
[49:26] that you know there's something a
[49:28] brother he loves to say in in my church
[49:31] and it's just so profound
[49:33] you know a lot of times when we preach
[49:34] he'll he'll throw us out there and he'll
[49:37] say God cannot have another thought
[49:43] think about that
[49:46] if God can have another thought that
[49:48] means in your life there was an error
[49:53] or he didn't he he's not a god of
[49:55] completion
[49:57] see that's why I always like to say you
[49:59] know the Bible says uh what we say all
[50:02] the time Lord you know give me more
[50:04] faith how can he when he gave you
[50:06] everything already
[50:09] amen
[50:11] Hallelujah when you will create it I
[50:13] love the example the prophet of God uses
[50:15] when he talks about an orange tree or
[50:17] apple tree he says when that bush is
[50:19] that high he says every seed everything
[50:23] it would ever produce is in it
[50:25] Hallelujah at that size honey you know
[50:29] one time I know you're about 18 19 now
[50:31] but once you about that size
[50:33] one-year-old two-year-old and everything
[50:36] you were turning out to be at 18 was
[50:38] already in you in that side hallelujah
[50:41] amen can you believe it you were once
[50:44] Hallelujah two foot now you're about six
[50:46] foot but everything in you when you were
[50:48] two foot is there in you right now while
[50:50] you're six feet
[50:53] hey
[50:55] [Applause]
[50:57] Hallelujah when you was running track he
[51:00] was already in here when you were
[51:01] playing football he was all
[51:04] this message was already in you oh God
[51:08] hallelujah why didn't you make it hardly
[51:10] to the NFL because that was not your
[51:13] reality why did you run hardly for gold
[51:16] medal because that was natural reality
[51:18] your reality was bursting out those
[51:21] children
[51:23] go to Hamilton of being a father of many
[51:26] Smiths

[51:31] passive Pride Church Hallelujah
[51:36] that was your reality
[51:38] [Applause]
[51:40] and we look at things
[51:42] that I hope Jesse don't mind Hallelujah
[51:44] well he said he said he's a real
[51:46] inspiration him him and his wife have
[51:48] reinspirations to me you know because
[51:49] you think about it you know in that
[51:51] moment maybe when you when you messed up
[51:54] your meniscus or or or whatever it was
[51:56] you know when you tore it you might as
[51:59] thinkers like man I was right there he
[52:02] played with some of the best of the best
[52:03] you know uh uh some of the some of the
[52:06] greatest of the greats and in that
[52:08] moment he may have had a thought like
[52:10] man I could have been this or I could
[52:12] have been mad see that's his imagination
[52:17] [Applause]
[52:20] and God don't wound our imagination
[52:22] Hallelujah he want the truth of the
[52:25] position of Christ that he called us to
[52:28] be in Hallelujah God wants us to live
[52:31] Our Truth

[52:56] that was not my reality

[53:25] by his fights I'm here
[53:30] see God's trying to get us beyond our
[53:32] imagination
[53:33] [Applause]
[53:35] because your imagination can be one of
[53:37] the biggest detriments to your walk in
[53:39] Christ
[53:41] that's why the scripture comes and come
[53:43] back and it says thank on these things
[53:46] what's up is honest whatsoever Spirit
[53:48] whatsoever is of a good report and you
[53:50] don't want to know like the scripture
[53:51] say amen God is trying to keep our
[53:53] thought process Hallelujah in Our Truth
[53:56] amen
[53:57] amen
[54:00] well you know and you have people in the
[54:02] world you know they'll be doing crazy
[54:05] stuff and they'll just say well I'm real
[54:07] I'm just I'm just real
[54:09] like no that ain't what he's talking
[54:10] about that's the real of this flesh
[54:12] the real of your own worldly desires no
[54:14] the real of the saith the Lord
[54:17] the real of God's plan for your life
[54:21] what God created you to be amen see
[54:25] there was a point Hallelujah when Man
[54:27] was created he was living in the reality
[54:30] of God's mind
[54:31] [Music]
[54:34] oh boy that's heavy
[54:36] That's Heavy right there huh think about
[54:39] the church when God saw Adam God was
[54:42] living his reality
[54:45] he said I'm gonna create something in my
[54:48] very own image in my likeness in my
[54:50] person think like me won't like me talk
[54:52] like me does everything like me
[54:53] Hallelujah he didn't do that see the
[54:56] animals wasn't his reality Hallelujah
[54:59] the fruit trees and all these things was
[55:01] not his reality but man what's his
[55:04] reality
[55:06] Hallelujah because man was not
[55:08] Hallelujah created just to be a part of
[55:11] the imagination of what God would be no
[55:14] he was the reality of who God is
[55:17] [Applause]
[55:19] [Music]
[55:20] are we
[55:22] [Applause]
[55:27] I just love going back to this casting
[55:29] down imagination and every High thought
[55:31] and every half thing that exalt itself
[55:33] above the knowledge of God and bringing
[55:36] into captivity every thought
[55:40] see that's our challenge
[55:42] amen anything that's not speaking truth
[55:45] about who you are in Christ bring it
[55:48] into captivity
[55:51] how do you bring it into the activity
[55:52] you passed it down
[55:54] you tell the devil I will not let you
[55:57] have the last word in my mind
[56:03] I will not let you speak my destiny
[56:06] earlier but I will live according to the
[56:10] reality of God's word
[56:12] you say Brothers what do you mean the
[56:14] word cannot be changed the altar amen
[56:17] hallelujah that's why the prophet of God
[56:19] will say when you're going through
[56:20] things find yourself identified in Bible
[56:23] characters
[56:24] [Music]
[56:25] [Applause]
[56:28] because that's the reality
[56:32] Hallelujah
[56:34] he says if you find it in here do what
[56:37] they did and you'll get the same results
[56:45] so we should be able to go through the
[56:47] scriptures and look and find hallelujah
[56:48] our placing our position in Christ
[56:52] Hallelujah and you know church as a as I
[56:55] as I think about the word of God and
[56:57] even Christ Jesus coming upon the Earth
[56:59] he was living out his reality
[57:04] as a lord as a savior as a Healer all
[57:08] these things pulled him out of Glory he
[57:10] allowed all these things to happen
[57:12] Hallelujah to show us that bondage is
[57:14] not our reality that's why he came all
[57:17] the way he sent Moses to be a deliverer
[57:19] of Hallelujah to bring the children out
[57:21] why to bring them into their reality
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:27] amen
[57:28] and he did that over and over and over
[57:31] throughout the scriptures Hallelujah all
[57:33] the way up to the birth of Jesus Christ
[57:34] to show the people amen that sickness
[57:37] and shame and even Holier doing it
[57:40] having your sin forgiving and going back
[57:42] through it because the desire is there
[57:44] Jesus came to break away that
[57:47] [Applause]
[57:48] he came to breaking away his show
[57:50] there's a greater reality you can live
[57:53] beyond Hallelujah sinful desires even
[57:57] and Beyond carnal desires I'm gonna
[58:00] bring you into a real reality
[58:03] what is it it's called The Holy Ghost
[58:08] Hallelujah
[58:10] and the Holy Ghost becomes the reality
[58:12] that we can live by
[58:15] but when you look at Christ and how he
[58:17] walked the Earth they said oh he's just
[58:19] a man no that wasn't his reality
[58:23] see they got it all mistaken amen they
[58:25] crucified Jesus because they say you
[58:27] being a man make yourself God see they
[58:30] was looking at it wrong they couldn't
[58:31] step into the reality they look at him
[58:34] and they saw a man they say how could it
[58:36] be God the real reality of Jesus Christ
[58:39] was not that he was a man Hallelujah
[58:42] calling himself God the real reality was
[58:45] he was God making himself a man
[58:47] [Music]
[58:54] they couldn't understand Hallelujah the
[58:57] reality of God God was so high he could
[59:00] form a body Hallelujah and put his
[59:02] spirit in just like he did in the Garden
[59:05] of Eden
[59:07] see look at God's reality look at his
[59:10] truth hallelujah what did he do he put
[59:12] his Spirit Hallelujah in a man called
[59:15] Adam did he made a body for Adam earlier
[59:17] that was the reality of who he was so if
[59:20] he did that before he had to do it again
[59:22] [Applause]
[59:26] so you allowed another body to be born
[59:29] of a virgin birth Hallelujah his name
[59:31] was called Emmanuel counselor Prince of
[59:34] Peace the mighty one known as Jesus
[59:37] Christ and God came down again and put
[59:39] his spirit in a body Hallelujah and live
[59:42] the reality
[59:43] yeah
[59:45] what was the reality
[59:47] the reality was not only Hallelujah to
[59:50] just take away sin Hallelujah but to
[59:53] become sin
[59:58] [Music]
[1:00:00] he who knew no sin became sin
[1:00:04] he never became our sins he couldn't
[1:00:07] take it away
[1:00:08] amen so you had to become Hallelujah the
[1:00:12] very thing that was hindering your walk
[1:00:14] Hallelujah let's look at the execution
[1:00:16] of it not because he was a sinner
[1:00:19] Hallelujah but he became sin earlier by
[1:00:23] the confession of all of us believing
[1:00:25] him as Lord and savior
[1:00:30] but that's heavy right there
[1:00:34] not that he was a sinner but you
[1:00:37] confessing him as Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:00:39] Christ pleading his blood your sins Came
[1:00:43] Upon him
[1:00:44] amen now that's my reality
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:49] I'm no longer a sinner
[1:00:51] but I confessed my sins unto Christ
[1:00:54] so every room everything I've ever done
[1:00:57] I've given it unto him and what did he
[1:01:00] do he's already crucified
[1:01:05] that's why the devil cannot hold
[1:01:08] anything to your child
[1:01:11] because it's already under the blood
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:15] Hallelujah
[1:01:18] see
[1:01:19] that's why we're so blessed
[1:01:21] to be able to go beyond just religion
[1:01:25] you know I was talking I was talking
[1:01:26] with a friend of mine
[1:01:28] and uh at one of the gyms I go to and
[1:01:32] she don't believe in God like we do
[1:01:36] and it's it's churches is is strange now
[1:01:40] the way people believe
[1:01:42] the things they believe in it doesn't
[1:01:43] even make sense you know this is why
[1:01:46] this is why it's very important to
[1:01:49] understand your truth
[1:01:50] amen hallelujah
[1:01:52] if I if I could tell the whole clan of
[1:01:55] the Smiths family this is not just your
[1:01:57] Mama and Daddy's uh gospel
[1:02:02] yo when you stand before God you're not
[1:02:06] going to stand there as their children
[1:02:07] you're going to stand there as a son or
[1:02:09] a daughter
[1:02:12] God
[1:02:13] Hallelujah you know churches is in this
[1:02:17] day people believe in anything and they
[1:02:19] try to they try to make it fit in their
[1:02:22] reality
[1:02:24] if you take the the the LBG D on TQ
[1:02:27] whatever you want to call it you take
[1:02:30] that Community they're not living in
[1:02:32] reality
[1:02:36] in a living reality you take a man and
[1:02:38] he said well I'm a woman and I can look
[1:02:40] at them and say you're a man amen
[1:02:41] everything about you speaks man Your
[1:02:44] Voice Hallelujah your statue amen your
[1:02:48] size 12 shoe everything about you speaks
[1:02:51] of a man I'm looking at the reality but
[1:02:53] his imagination
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:02:59] his imagination will allow him to live
[1:03:03] something sauce
[1:03:09] but if he or she just keep living it'll
[1:03:11] always bring them back to reality
[1:03:15] because there'll always be something to
[1:03:18] remind Hallelujah that that trans that
[1:03:21] you have been changed by the thoughts of
[1:03:23] your mind
[1:03:24] because there'll always be something
[1:03:26] there to come back I was telling Jesse
[1:03:28] yesterday I watched the interview with
[1:03:29] this man this woman this woman she said
[1:03:31] she said oh well what what is what is
[1:03:33] the definition of a woman he said an
[1:03:36] adult female she said well trans doesn't
[1:03:38] fit into that uh definition she says
[1:03:41] with all my friends see me they say that
[1:03:43] I am a woman he say of course they're
[1:03:45] your friends he said but I'm gonna tell
[1:03:47] you the truth every time when I look at
[1:03:49] you I see a man
[1:03:52] all right
[1:03:53] guys
[1:03:56] and you know they went on and on and on
[1:03:58] he says okay enough for this
[1:04:00] he said if you can just change the scope
[1:04:03] like that you could just say you are
[1:04:04] what you want to be or whatever however
[1:04:06] you feel like it and and all these
[1:04:07] things he say okay I'm I'm gonna I'm an
[1:04:10] adult black woman
[1:04:12] and he was a Caucasian man
[1:04:15] and she looked at him and she was like
[1:04:17] you just going too far he's like no if
[1:04:19] you can change it and for you to make
[1:04:22] for you to make it make sense in your
[1:04:24] mind why I can't change it and make it
[1:04:26] make sense in my mind
[1:04:27] and she was looking at him and saying
[1:04:29] what you're saying is crazy and he's
[1:04:31] looking at her and saying what you're
[1:04:33] saying is crazy
[1:04:36] see a person Hallelujah will only
[1:04:40] believe in something Hallelujah a lot of
[1:04:43] times if it fits into the scope of what
[1:04:45] they want to be
[1:04:48] but God didn't call us hallelujah
[1:04:51] through an imagination
[1:04:53] he called us through truth he called us
[1:04:57] holy through position and purpose
[1:04:59] Hallelujah
[1:05:00] every whole March or try to stop
[1:05:03] it try to do something all these
[1:05:05] things but every moment that trans woman
[1:05:07] that want to be a man every month it
[1:05:09] will remind her that she's a woman
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:18] Hallelujah that's why they got to take
[1:05:20] medicine and shoot this and hit this and
[1:05:22] pump this just to stop Hallelujah their
[1:05:25] reality
[1:05:28] but if we can just catch the reality of
[1:05:32] God
[1:05:33] amen we can live in such a place above
[1:05:35] all this foolishness
[1:05:37] [Applause]
[1:05:41] and that's who Jesus was
[1:05:44] Jesus could live beyond what was going
[1:05:46] on at that time honey think about the
[1:05:49] church Jesus the god of Glory he who was
[1:05:52] not born of a man Hallelujah
[1:05:54] but born through the inspiration of the
[1:05:57] spoken word
[1:05:58] amen the disciples look like so much of
[1:06:02] the word uh the Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:06:04] look like so much of the truth but when
[1:06:07] the truth came to them they couldn't
[1:06:09] even understand
[1:06:14] when the facts
[1:06:17] Christianity
[1:06:19] the fact of the word the facts of the
[1:06:23] Savior Lord holy the fact of real power
[1:06:26] the fact of life the fact of the door
[1:06:29] being opened or standing right in front
[1:06:31] of them and they couldn't even step into
[1:06:33] that reality
[1:06:37] why
[1:06:38] because they had their own precepts of
[1:06:40] how it should be
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:43] amen the worst thing we can do
[1:06:46] Hallelujah he's tried to orchestrate our
[1:06:49] own plan
[1:06:50] [Music]
[1:06:55] Amen in everything we do we should say
[1:06:57] if the Lord is willing amen
[1:07:01] [Applause]
[1:07:03] because say you go to the bank and you
[1:07:05] say I want fifty thousand dollars
[1:07:08] if the Lord is willing
[1:07:10] you go to the bank and you get that 50
[1:07:12] 50 000 you know why because the Lord was
[1:07:15] willing
[1:07:19] Hallelujah you go to whatever car
[1:07:22] dealership down here that has a 2023
[1:07:25] Corvette Hallelujah
[1:07:28] and you go down there you say man you
[1:07:29] know what I always wanted a Corvette I'm
[1:07:31] gonna go down here and get a Corvette if
[1:07:33] the Lord is willing amen
[1:07:36] amen and just some kind of way with no
[1:07:37] money down no nothing amen does a
[1:07:40] Salesman come out there he say I like
[1:07:41] you know what I'm gonna create a deal
[1:07:43] for you and you're gonna leave out here
[1:07:45] today with that Corvette if you leave
[1:07:46] with it you know what the Lord was
[1:07:48] willing
[1:07:52] now let's apply that to Joy
[1:07:55] let's apply that to peace
[1:07:58] let's apply that to love
[1:08:01] healing
[1:08:03] that's a financial case
[1:08:05] amen if the Lord is willing
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:12] if the Lord is willing I'll have what
[1:08:15] God wants me to have
[1:08:20] but we look at the Walk of Christ and
[1:08:21] how Christ walked Hallelujah he walked
[1:08:24] with an authority of knowing Hallelujah
[1:08:26] his reality
[1:08:28] Jesus amen you go back and read it Jesus
[1:08:31] didn't come out to get him and different
[1:08:33] things different things will happen
[1:08:34] Jesus will tell his disciples amen
[1:08:36] they're gonna come get me Hallelujah
[1:08:38] they're going to crucify me in three
[1:08:40] days I'm a rock
[1:08:45] oh
[1:08:48] he will speak in his reality
[1:08:51] no man has never spoken as death and
[1:08:53] ever risen Resurrection again
[1:08:57] but he knew he had a purpose Hallelujah
[1:09:00] so your reality will always lead you to
[1:09:03] your purpose
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:05] and you think about the church nobody
[1:09:07] could stop it nobody could do anything
[1:09:09] church he said nobody take my life but I
[1:09:12] lay it down
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:15] he lived that way throughout his whole
[1:09:17] time on the Earth
[1:09:19] look when they came when Jews betrayed
[1:09:21] him and everything when they when they
[1:09:23] betrayed him
[1:09:24] look they came back with with knives and
[1:09:27] stabs and all these things and Jesus was
[1:09:30] like y'all ain't come to get a criminal
[1:09:32] realize nobody can take my life amen
[1:09:39] nobody can take my life that's not the
[1:09:41] reality of who I am
[1:09:43] nobody can take my life I'm God I'm
[1:09:46] omniscient holder I'm all powerful
[1:09:50] nobody can take my life
[1:09:54] church and he proved that he proved that
[1:09:56] in Luke the fourth chapter amen Jesus
[1:09:58] was healing people and doing these
[1:10:00] different things and the Bible says that
[1:10:01] the crowd got angry with him then they
[1:10:05] led him a certain way on the side of a
[1:10:07] hill or a mountain or whatever seeking
[1:10:09] in their imagination that they're going
[1:10:11] to push them off the cliff that was
[1:10:13] their imagination we're gonna kill him
[1:10:15] we're gonna push him off a cliff but
[1:10:17] that wasn't God's reality he wasn't
[1:10:19] supposed to die of a cliff he was going
[1:10:21] to die giving his life on the cross
[1:10:25] so he knew his reality even death
[1:10:28] couldn't stop his purpose
[1:10:31] he even controlled how and when he was
[1:10:34] supposed to die
[1:10:37] [Applause]
[1:10:40] that's when you know who you are
[1:10:45] live in your reality
[1:10:47] it's like it's like Jesus see Jesus they
[1:10:51] pull they brought him to the side of the
[1:10:52] cliff and they ain't mine they thinking
[1:10:53] they said we're gonna throw him up a
[1:10:55] cliff while they think of them thoughts
[1:10:57] Jesus walking straight through
[1:10:59] nobody could touch him
[1:11:01] why because his reality wasn't to die
[1:11:03] off a cliff
[1:11:06] that's what we ought to tell Satan my
[1:11:08] reality is not cancer amen
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:12] amen my reality is not high blood
[1:11:14] pressure
[1:11:15] my reality is not diabetes
[1:11:17] that's not the way Hallelujah I was
[1:11:20] supposed to leave here I was supposed to
[1:11:22] leave you as a son and daughter of God
[1:11:24] [Applause]
[1:11:29] oh
[1:11:32] and he lived that way throughout his
[1:11:34] whole life upon the Earth
[1:11:36] many of the times they thought they'd
[1:11:38] kill him in different things but they
[1:11:39] couldn't do it
[1:11:40] why because that wasn't a part of who he
[1:11:43] was
[1:11:44] that wasn't a part of his Journey Church
[1:11:46] Jesus was so confident in his reality in
[1:11:49] his truth as coming Hallelujah to redeem
[1:11:53] us amen coming as a redeemer holy as a
[1:11:56] Healer and all these different things he
[1:11:58] was so confident in that Jesus could ask
[1:12:00] the devil whom you seek
[1:12:03] who you come after
[1:12:05] they said Jesus would never he said I'm
[1:12:07] he yeah
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:10] church he wasn't in hiding he was living
[1:12:13] his truth
[1:12:15] amen that's why this message doesn't put
[1:12:18] us in a corner where we had to know
[1:12:20] we're living out too
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:26] live my truth in front of my family
[1:12:29] live by truth in school live my truth on
[1:12:32] the job live my truth in church
[1:12:37] see Jesus wasn't hiding
[1:12:39] he says I am he and when he said that
[1:12:41] all of them fell down
[1:12:43] he waited till they get up he asked him
[1:12:45] again he said I said who do you seek
[1:12:47] they said Jesus name they fell down
[1:12:49] again see proving that nobody can change
[1:12:53] my reality hey man
[1:12:58] I've come
[1:13:00] to go to the Cross bear the sins of the
[1:13:02] world Hallelujah and make Sinners
[1:13:05] redeemable amen
[1:13:08] amen make Sinners righteous
[1:13:11] make Sinners faithful Hallelujah that
[1:13:15] was his purpose of coming Hallelujah
[1:13:17] that he would give us his life amen amen
[1:13:20] changing our reality amen amen because
[1:13:23] we were born in sin came into the world
[1:13:24] speaking lies but the confession of
[1:13:26] Jesus Christ changes all of that amen
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:30] Jesse what it does it destroys
[1:13:33] generational curses
[1:13:39] that's when the confession of Jesus
[1:13:40] Christ does
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:49] but we have to get beyond what we see
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:53] even what we hear
[1:13:55] that sometimes you can hear something
[1:13:56] and hear it wrong
[1:13:59] amen you ever you ever was telling your
[1:14:01] mom and dad somebody said don't you talk
[1:14:03] to me like that say mama
[1:14:05] I said this this oh okay oh okay all
[1:14:09] right
[1:14:10] all right
[1:14:11] you lucky
[1:14:14] because you said something but it was
[1:14:16] heard wrong so you had to clear it up
[1:14:17] amen that's why the Bible says be
[1:14:20] careful how you hear
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:24] [Applause]
[1:14:25] we're not listening to the word
[1:14:27] hallelujah of a man we listen to the
[1:14:28] words of God
[1:14:31] yes
[1:14:34] think about it Church
[1:14:35] there were many of people that heard the
[1:14:39] voice of God and could not step into
[1:14:41] that reality
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:43] amen they heard straight from God and
[1:14:46] couldn't live the reality of what they
[1:14:48] heard
[1:14:51] because something else was there
[1:14:55] think about it it blows me away every
[1:14:58] time I read the story of Balaam
[1:15:01] Balaam he goes straight to God to hear
[1:15:05] what God would say Amen now keep in mind
[1:15:07] this wasn't something strange for him
[1:15:10] he did this on several occasions but now
[1:15:14] he's coming into a place where who he is
[1:15:17] is really going to come out
[1:15:19] now he's going to come into the reality
[1:15:21] of who he is even though he's a prophet
[1:15:26] that he can hear from God walk with God
[1:15:28] and still have desire for things that's
[1:15:30] not of God Amen
[1:15:35] amen a dangerous place to be
[1:15:37] because his desire was going to get him
[1:15:40] killed even though he heard strength
[1:15:42] from God on what to do
[1:15:46] hey
[1:15:48] oh wow
[1:15:50] he heard the voice of God heard straight
[1:15:52] from God but his desire was Stronger
[1:15:55] amen his imagination of what he really
[1:15:57] wanted was Stronger
[1:15:59] than hearing straight from God
[1:16:03] and you think about how often we hear
[1:16:06] straight from God
[1:16:09] in our desires push away that reality
[1:16:14] you say ah come on bro these was it what
[1:16:16] did he really hear from God yes
[1:16:20] really he told balak he said look I'm
[1:16:23] gonna go get with God and see what he
[1:16:25] say
[1:16:26] first thing God says God is giving him a
[1:16:29] reality check
[1:16:30] God says who are those men you're with
[1:16:34] now he's all knowing he knows everything
[1:16:36] Hallelujah so that who are those men
[1:16:39] you're with is telling him you shouldn't
[1:16:41] be with those men
[1:16:44] [Applause]
[1:16:46] it's like a parent coming there saying
[1:16:48] who you on the phone with
[1:16:50] who you talking to who you on social
[1:16:52] media with they already saying to you
[1:16:55] that you shouldn't be talking to that
[1:16:56] person
[1:17:00] and Balaam goes into his whole Atkins
[1:17:03] holy spirit that this is they like it
[1:17:05] you know they want to curse the children
[1:17:06] of Israel and so forth is that and God
[1:17:08] says you can't change their reality amen
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:16] amen they like can't change their
[1:17:18] reality
[1:17:19] Balaam you can't change the reality
[1:17:22] because you can't curse what's blessed
[1:17:25] Hallelujah
[1:17:28] no matter what you see no matter what it
[1:17:30] looks like hallelujah what was God doing
[1:17:33] God was reminding Balaam of what he told
[1:17:36] Abraham
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:44] thank you
[1:17:46] no matter what it looked like 400 years
[1:17:49] later hallelujah or how many other years
[1:17:51] it was Hallelujah that real that was a
[1:17:54] reality check
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:58] he told him he said hey
[1:18:00] I told Abraham in blessings I Will Bless
[1:18:03] thee and multiplying our multiply the
[1:18:05] thy and thy seed shall be blessed
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:15] oh yeah
[1:18:17] and the journey through the Wilderness
[1:18:20] didn't change that blessing
[1:18:23] holy the murmuring ain't complaining
[1:18:25] didn't change that blessing
[1:18:27] all the unbelief didn't change that
[1:18:30] blessing
[1:18:31] the worship of a golden calf didn't
[1:18:34] change that blessing
[1:18:37] oh my
[1:18:40] God oh who got caught up with the gods
[1:18:42] of Baal and the Groves of bell didn't
[1:18:44] change that blessing
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:54] because he told Abraham in you they're
[1:18:57] going to be Nations
[1:19:01] and they're going to be blessed
[1:19:04] amen so here comes Balaam Hallelujah not
[1:19:07] realizing those people that he see
[1:19:09] already have a God sent reality amen
[1:19:13] he grows Bay Lake Hallelujah he's
[1:19:15] looking at the people and he's saying
[1:19:16] amen they don't they lick up the whole
[1:19:19] the whole country all the grass and
[1:19:21] everything Hallelujah church that wasn't
[1:19:23] the first time Hallelujah somebody had
[1:19:26] got a check like that honey lot had the
[1:19:29] same check hey man
[1:19:34] his husband and Abraham hers when they
[1:19:36] begin to argue and so forth and lot was
[1:19:38] like hey we need to do something about
[1:19:40] this
[1:19:42] so Abraham knowing his reality all this
[1:19:44] belongs to me you just chew you just
[1:19:47] choose and I go someplace else
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:52] Hallelujah
[1:19:54] see when you understand your reality
[1:19:56] you're not going to fight with unbelief
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:01] let them go go ahead
[1:20:04] hey you just be like Abraham go ahead
[1:20:07] and get what you want so I can save you
[1:20:08] later
[1:20:10] thank you
[1:20:16] cause my reality is blessings
[1:20:19] and not curses
[1:20:22] what what made light righteous it was
[1:20:25] the blessings of Abraham
[1:20:27] it was the prayers of Abraham
[1:20:30] it was just his connection with Abraham
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:36] and because Abraham had contact with God
[1:20:39] hallelujah Abraham became lot's savior
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:48] and just you holy think about it we was
[1:20:51] in yesterday think about it just you
[1:20:53] being a child of God
[1:20:55] somebody giving you a drink of water
[1:20:57] makes you their savior amen
[1:21:01] they can make it into the kingdom just
[1:21:03] because they treated you good
[1:21:05] they said something nice to you
[1:21:07] they help you uh up the stairs or they
[1:21:09] help you put Grocer in the car whatever
[1:21:11] it is some unconsciously knowing earlier
[1:21:15] that they're doing something for a child
[1:21:17] of God
[1:21:19] and they're going to be rewarded because
[1:21:21] of that
[1:21:24] that in my time of need maybe somebody
[1:21:27] pulled a hundred dollars out and say hey
[1:21:29] here you go brother James they did that
[1:21:31] unto the Lord
[1:21:36] helping me to remain in my reality
[1:21:45] oh my
[1:21:47] God I'm about to close but
[1:21:50] the reason why I'm ending with Abraham
[1:21:54] because Abraham going back to what we
[1:21:57] started with Abraham and Sarah they had
[1:22:00] to conquer their imagination
[1:22:04] to live out their reality
[1:22:07] in the whole life the whole part of
[1:22:09] their Journey first started out with a
[1:22:12] carnal imagination
[1:22:14] God comes again speaking to God
[1:22:18] listen Church Hallelujah unbelief is
[1:22:21] powerful don't give yourself over to
[1:22:23] doubt
[1:22:26] if at any time you have questions and
[1:22:28] you begin to doubt just know one thing
[1:22:31] don't doubt the word of God Amen
[1:22:33] [Applause]
[1:22:36] you can tell people all you want just
[1:22:39] don't doubt the word of God
[1:22:40] [Music]
[1:22:42] because every man all of us every man no
[1:22:46] matter how great you want to make
[1:22:48] himself be all of us have an element of
[1:22:50] failure inside
[1:22:54] and with that the grace of God we would
[1:22:58] project failure daily
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:04] so never put your eyes on a certain
[1:23:06] person and say I want to be like that no
[1:23:09] no because then you're setting that
[1:23:11] personal for failure and you're saying
[1:23:13] yourself up for failure amen because God
[1:23:15] will show you that that person needs the
[1:23:17] grace of God Amen
[1:23:19] amen just to get your eyes back on him
[1:23:26] Hallelujah
[1:23:27] he did it to Isaiah and uziah Hallelujah
[1:23:31] because you saw your Hallelujah he
[1:23:33] looked at me so lifted up and all these
[1:23:35] great things and everything and Isaiah
[1:23:37] being a young man up under him
[1:23:39] Hallelujah he looked at him he idolized
[1:23:41] him but God allowed certain events to
[1:23:44] take place to bring Isaiah back to his
[1:23:46] reality
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:52] but we look
[1:23:54] the greatest thing Abraham and Sarah had
[1:23:56] to deal with was their own imagination
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:02] having that face to face with God wasn't
[1:24:05] a problem
[1:24:07] All Through the Bible and and I'm a
[1:24:09] little jealous
[1:24:11] I'm a little jealous because you read
[1:24:12] the Bible you see people had one-on-ones
[1:24:15] With God all the time
[1:24:18] when they needed something from the Lord
[1:24:20] they'd go get into prayer and God will
[1:24:22] come and speak
[1:24:23] to him or God will send an angel and so
[1:24:25] forth and everything church God hasn't
[1:24:27] changed
[1:24:28] he's still the same what's the problem
[1:24:31] hallelujah it's
[1:24:33] it's up we're too connected to this
[1:24:35] world but we just lay everything aside
[1:24:38] and really get into the reality of God
[1:24:41] communicating with his people we will
[1:24:44] hear his voice
[1:24:45] and it'll be clear
[1:24:48] Hallelujah Church sin cannot stop you
[1:24:52] from hearing the voice of God
[1:25:00] I don't know about that church it has to
[1:25:04] be
[1:25:05] because if sin could stop it I'll ask
[1:25:08] you a question how could Adam hear God
[1:25:11] after they particularly
[1:25:15] [Applause]
[1:25:18] even after he's seeing even after he
[1:25:22] called all creation to fall he still
[1:25:24] heard God calling him
[1:25:28] as he always did
[1:25:33] through give me no excuses about the
[1:25:36] situation don't give me no excuses about
[1:25:39] what you did and what you think about if
[1:25:42] he couldn't stop Adam
[1:25:44] and he from hearing the voice of God
[1:25:48] it surely can't stop your situation
[1:25:55] but it's something
[1:25:56] that I'm just kind of taking know that
[1:25:58] that there's so many people in the Bible
[1:26:01] or in the word that we read that they
[1:26:04] have one-on-ones with God
[1:26:06] but who they were
[1:26:08] the voice of God still couldn't change
[1:26:11] them
[1:26:15] Cain himself
[1:26:16] bad
[1:26:18] having a one-on-one with God talking to
[1:26:20] God and My Brother's Keeper
[1:26:23] you know I don't know where he at and
[1:26:25] all these things and even getting
[1:26:27] instruction from God
[1:26:30] if you do as your brother you'll be
[1:26:32] accepted
[1:26:33] he's getting instruction from God but
[1:26:35] who he was his reality would let him be
[1:26:38] something he wasn't amen
[1:26:42] man
[1:26:44] and he could walk out of the presence of
[1:26:46] God
[1:26:48] and there's so many people like that you
[1:26:50] know if again if I go back to Balaam
[1:26:52] Balaam comes to God at least three times
[1:26:54] asking him about the same thing
[1:26:58] like God doesn't didn't know what he was
[1:27:00] saying the first time
[1:27:03] but what there was something inside of
[1:27:05] him that was craving something else
[1:27:08] and he kept trying to reason with God
[1:27:13] picture that honey God is only obligated
[1:27:16] to his word
[1:27:20] and he's obligated to what he said about
[1:27:22] you amen
[1:27:28] and all these things that God was saying
[1:27:31] they blessed and not curse I don't care
[1:27:34] what you show me they blessed they're
[1:27:37] not cursed
[1:27:39] okay Balaam go ahead just go ahead God
[1:27:43] didn't change his mind he told me to go
[1:27:45] ahead and God said now I got the key
[1:27:48] because you want that more than you want
[1:27:51] to obey me
[1:27:52] amen and it took a donkey
[1:27:55] to be anointed by God
[1:27:57] to speak to Baylor man look Church he's
[1:28:00] so blinded by what he wants he's so
[1:28:02] blinded about his imagination
[1:28:05] getting what he can get from balak he's
[1:28:07] so blinded by that he's not even
[1:28:09] realizing he's in a supernatural event
[1:28:12] right now a donkey is talking to me
[1:28:16] he couldn't even see he's so blinded he
[1:28:18] didn't even realize a donkey he's having
[1:28:20] a conversation with a donkey
[1:28:25] I don't know about y'all but if I'm
[1:28:27] sitting at the house
[1:28:29] I gotta I got a uh uh a dog
[1:28:33] named Bella
[1:28:35] and Bella
[1:28:37] is a a half pit bull
[1:28:41] and she's a pretty stocky dog
[1:28:45] but if we're sitting in the living room
[1:28:47] and I come home
[1:28:49] and I sit down I look at Bella and
[1:28:52] better look at me and she say how was
[1:28:54] your day
[1:28:58] I think I lose it
[1:29:02] or I call the news and say hey I got a
[1:29:04] talking dog
[1:29:07] that's not some ordinary
[1:29:10] but Balaam was so blinded by what he but
[1:29:13] but what he wanted and what he desired
[1:29:15] God opened the mouth of a donkey and
[1:29:19] started talking to him the donkey trying
[1:29:20] to save his life and he didn't even
[1:29:22] realize what's going on he getting mad
[1:29:23] at the Donkey
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:28] sometimes God will put things
[1:29:31] in place to keep you in your perspective
[1:29:34] reality
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:38] because you're going after something
[1:29:39] that he didn't ordain for you
[1:29:41] something that could cost you your life
[1:29:44] so you put something in the way to try
[1:29:46] to keep you in your reality
[1:29:49] and then balaam's case it took a talking
[1:29:52] donkey
[1:29:55] and he wasn't happy about that thing
[1:29:56] either he was mad at the Donkey
[1:29:59] he wanted to kill a donkey
[1:30:01] and then God opened his eyes
[1:30:04] and he saw the angel standing there with
[1:30:06] the sword ready to chop his head off
[1:30:10] be careful this is a whole other message
[1:30:12] man I'm about to quit be careful where
[1:30:14] your desires are pulling
[1:30:18] man because your desires can be pulling
[1:30:20] you completely out of the will of God
[1:30:23] completely out of your reality that God
[1:30:26] has for you
[1:30:27] but when we look at conquering and we
[1:30:29] see what Abraham and Sarah had to
[1:30:32] conquer first was their imagination
[1:30:34] God told him to say in your old age
[1:30:36] you're going to have a son you and Sarah
[1:30:38] out of your own vowels out of your own
[1:30:40] you you you're gonna have this Sarah and
[1:30:42] Sarah laughed
[1:30:44] Abraham laugh but that didn't change God
[1:30:47] one bit
[1:30:49] that didn't change their reality one bit
[1:30:54] Sarah says okay how can this be me being
[1:30:57] old my Lord being oh we haven't pleased
[1:30:59] you know what hey God that's how it's
[1:31:00] gonna happen still didn't change their
[1:31:02] reality
[1:31:05] Hallelujah
[1:31:07] Abraham having other kids still didn't
[1:31:09] change the reality
[1:31:11] earlier Abraham Hallelujah got out of
[1:31:14] the will of God began to walk down he
[1:31:16] said hey you're my sister now don't say
[1:31:18] you're my wife the king gonna come get
[1:31:19] you Keem come until Sarah still didn't
[1:31:21] change their reality
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:26] God is going to make sure you fulfill
[1:31:30] the plan he has for you
[1:31:32] [Applause]
[1:31:36] because if you don't that mean God has
[1:31:39] to change his plan
[1:31:44] whatever he's laid
[1:31:47] is once and for all
[1:31:49] [Applause]
[1:31:53] so what I love about God God
[1:31:56] protecting himself as well as protecting
[1:31:58] you God comes down tells the man give
[1:32:00] Abraham back Sarah or you're good as a
[1:32:03] dead man and better yet go down and let
[1:32:05] him pray for you
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:09] he goes down he prays for him he said
[1:32:11] why did you lie to me why do you do this
[1:32:12] this and that he's the house of free
[1:32:14] blah blah blah and the man was like oh
[1:32:16] my God you're about to get all of us
[1:32:17] killed
[1:32:19] and then the next thing you know
[1:32:21] Sarah has Isaac
[1:32:25] and that whole promise 25 years later
[1:32:28] became a reality
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:35] and now we're all living by faith the
[1:32:39] reality the promise that God has given
[1:32:41] to Abraham
[1:32:44] I see let me tell you this morning what
[1:32:46] is a part of our reality die seed shall
[1:32:49] possess the Gate of this enemy
[1:32:52] [Applause]
[1:32:55] that's my reality
[1:32:58] oh
[1:33:00] sickness is not my reality
[1:33:04] depression is not my reality
[1:33:06] Hallelujah
[1:33:08] the Bible says whatsoever you desire
[1:33:10] When you pray if you believe you shall
[1:33:12] have it that's my reality
[1:33:15] [Applause]
[1:33:17] because this walking in let's believe in
[1:33:19] that earlier because reality speaks of
[1:33:22] Truth speaks of facts Hallelujah so when
[1:33:24] you look at your life Hallelujah ask
[1:33:27] yourself the question before you do
[1:33:28] anything if anything is happening where
[1:33:30] you are right now ask yourself is this
[1:33:32] really who I am
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:35] is this really who I am what just you
[1:33:37] you'll be going through something you're
[1:33:38] going through the greatest child of your
[1:33:40] life and you have to ask yourself is
[1:33:42] this really who I am
