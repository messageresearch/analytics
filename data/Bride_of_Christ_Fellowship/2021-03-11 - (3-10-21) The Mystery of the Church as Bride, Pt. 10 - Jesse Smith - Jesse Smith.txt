brother bang ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. ephesians 5 32 this announcement we have brother brian hawkins will be here on sunday so looking forward to seeing our brother god's grace i think that's the only announcement i did put a little fellowship up there for the end of the month amen and i were talking about starting up those little fellowships we did last summer and so we'll try to get one lord willing at the end of the month no no we'll try to provide food for those and then we can do a little bible study then go to the park or something or just have some fun with the kids by god's case pardon me all right ephesians 5 32 are the children there can they say amen bless you ephesians 5 32. he's trying to say amen i know he is all right let's read ephesians 5 32. truth on three one two three this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church amen let's go to ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1. you know i got here a little earlier so i didn't have to pray at the beginning so that was uh i was just happy to get here a little bit early by god's grace please ask these 12 verse one so let's read this and then children may the lord grant this wonderful scripture to your lives that's our prayer let's read that on three one two three remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them amen let's have one more word of prayer let's bow our heads and you have a need on your heart let's just make it known to the lord by raising your hand or praying in your own heart here heavenly father we come here lord in all sincerity lord in all truth knowing lord you you told us to go into all the nations and make disciples of every nation lord and teaching them to observe whatsoever i commanded them lord and so we believe that we want to observe all your commands lord god father here at the end time where the bible says the mysteries of god will be finished as as you've declared to your servants the prophet saw we want to do our part in in uh prophesying those mysteries again lord god and so father just write these revelations on the on the hearts of the girls lord and and the saints here lord god we pray and lord jesus we just thank you for your spirit we we're happy to sing to you lord it's a it's a joy we feel your presence lord god we know you're we're your chosen seed because of all these lord attributes of the true bride of christ and we're grateful for that lord we have confidence in your word lord it's called us out of darkness into the marvelous light lord and it's washing us constantly week after week washed in the waters of the word so i give you thanks and praise for that i couldn't do it on my own lord none of us could it takes the washing of the holy spirit so we thank you and we give you praise in jesus christ's name remember he said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god that's my guy right there or me i just got a little runny nose here let's make sure i wash my hands before we shake hands after church okay everybody i need to wash my hands i need to i don't want to spread anything here all right so let's take a few minutes i'll set my timer here let's do about 40 minutes here by god's grace and we'll teach this we're almost done to the end of this revelation here i trust you've enjoyed it uh learning about and receiving the revelations of the church as the bride to me after studying all this is just it's more obvious uh more than ever and today i was uh doing a little bit more research on jehovah's witnesses and mormons and i have a couple friends that are one of each and just doing some more research just listening to what they believe i'll start with jehovah's witnesses they really don't believe in a torment in hell they just believe when a person dies they no longer exist uh what a what a false teaching that is and they don't really believe jesus is god they believe he's like michael he's like a lower being and i know there's a few quotes from brother branham on that but he never labored on that and i don't think it was a major doctrine of brother branham i never heard even one sermon on it so uh just seeing that they deny the deity of christ and remember they deny the holy ghost supernatural power of god so when i told the one about my my mother being healed of cancer they just said well maybe maybe she didn't have it maybe the doctors got it wrong you weren't there that's the thing you you know nothing about it and so see what uh what a discouragement that would be right to my mom's testimony right or even my faith but we know you know we know my mom had the bruises like just like she did for the skinny stone she said she had and that's what she was so scared a couple wednesday nights ago and i shared that she had bruises on her back uh and she said that's what i had when i had cancer so we i remember that remember that she had those bruises and when she had cancer and then they had of course they had the x-rays and all the data but you know jehovah's witnesses they'll deny that and say well that was that was that wasn't it or the doctors healed her but she had no she had no uh what they call chemo she had no chemo when does cancer just vanish so we're thankful for the living god amen and we know that kind of faith although they couldn't be nice people fine people that kind of faith is not the faith of jesus's bride because that's not fully obedient to every word of god they can be good churches some of them can be saved no doubt very few though the bible says few there be that find the narrow road few of them can be saved i was listening to the mormons you know the mormons uh i have a good friend that's a mormon well i said that good friend but he read my book malcolm knows him he's a good good man he said he liked my book of course his wife wears pants and cuts her hair still so i don't know how much he liked about it but uh mormons you know they believe uh there's three levels to heaven three levels to hell and they believe even someone like uh and they even said it someone like adolf hitler could be in the lowest heaven they think he could possibly be in heaven uh well i doubt it the way the way his life story tells that he basically committed suicide and uh and then of course you know uh they have other false doctrines they have added an entire testament onto the new testament and they actually teach that the king james version has heirs in it so they actually have five books right they actually have five books i'm sorry five sources four books uh including one of these so three other books one of them is the book of mormon and then uh they have two other influences their main influence is actually the leadership the president of the mormon church he's actually what they call like a living prophet and he can change anything the other prophet said and that's the highest revelation is actually their living prophet uh but we know there's no mistakes praise god there might be a little translation here there or something i've not studied that too deep but i know every word i've read it dovetails with all the others amen hallelujah and the god of this bible comes to make this bible live praise god and so we're thankful for that and they actually believed god was just a god over earth and they actually believed god uh was a man that kind of changed into a god and he has all these wives that produce all the children and all the people on the earth today they actually believe that god has uh spiritual wives in heaven that's what they actually believe and they believe a man that that's really godly gets to go to heaven and have lots of wives and produce more children kind of like that same thing and then he's the ruler over all these peoples in heaven now look at that that's just a bunch of crazy stuff you don't find that in the word of god amen so just uh you know just when and then think about that and then they say almost they say almost nobody goes to hell that's totally contrary to what jesus said jesus said few people find salvation they say few people miss salvation so who are we going to believe we're going to believe christ the word amen because he is the word hallelujah that's why we judge everything and joseph smith said he's a prophet well now he added to the word of god and he never prophesied anything that actually came to pass so we we look at each one of these groups and remember church these are some of the churches that are growing the most in protestantism the mormon church i've seen numerous articles over the years how the mormon church is expanding and getting bigger and because people like you know the solemnness of it and the seriousness of it and they want something more than what the dead denominations well that's just as dead it's just got a little different twist on it and so sea church you know uh the deception is rising right uh the deception is rising but but the revelation of god is still available to those who want to receive it it's it's out there for those who really want to be the bride who really want to obey jesus it's out there and it's for those who want those five aspects remember there's five aspects to the bride christ is her head not a creed second she submits to all the word third she's washed by jesus's washing method amen the water of the word fourth she's joined to christ and also christ's body because you can't separate the head from the body right and then last she's got reverence the bible said see that she reverence her husband amen and so we got reverence for jesus christ all five attributes we can see are with the bride and we believe we're part of that bride i wouldn't be here if i didn't believe that amen i believe i'm a part of the bride of jesus christ praise god now last week we finished with eve remember we looked at lessons we did eight women uh that specifically typed rapture women gentile women jew gentile women rather and then we close with eve's redemption story i got a few more women i like to go through uh and then eventually i want to end with the revelation i'm sorry the proverbs 31 woman so got your bibles young people get out your bibles if you can we'll have some ready readers by god's grace appreciate all the reading on sunday night everybody did a nice job reading there so thank you all right let's start with jochebed so we learned a great lesson from eve how she's uh the last eve right there's christ was the last adam uh and we the church are the last eve what a story she is of redemption praise god she was glorious she was perfect she fell but redeemed by the blood amen thank god for that now let's look at another one jacob but i tried to just you know as i wrote this last summer i just tried to sit under the anointing of the holy spirit and see which women i looked at all these lists of bible women and which ones really spoke to me as lessons we can learn eve is a great lesson of redemption praise god and we learn great lessons we learn not to add to the word and we learn that there's grace and there's mercy especially if you're one with the husband praise god and thank god we're one with christ amen now jacob what a great example now she and her husband are examples of trusting god in the face of governmental oppression and persecution right egypt was killing all the hebrew babies but jochebed's faith caused her to reject fear so let's read that it's uh hebrews 11 23 malachi can you get that for me hebrews 11 23 if you could read that i'd appreciate that look at this woman what an example of faith and notice the bible says jochebed she's the one that casts the uh the the ark upon the waters right or she had her daughter miriam do it but it was her it was the scripture specifically points out to her faith hebrews 11 23. let's read that or malcolm going to read that for us buddy hey man now look the church you know we got to put ourselves in her spot she didn't even have the baptism of the holy ghost but look at the faith that she had she's seeing all the hebrew babies dying around her so she hides her baby boy for what was it three months i think look at zion's six so half of that she hit that baby for three months and the bible said they were not afraid now what would it take for us to be not afraid of something like that where they come around and take every hebrew boy right every christian boy they take them it would take a lot of faith right but the bible says i just like i love what it says it says the same thing about abraham he staggered not at the promise of god amen ahead we know he did we know he did but the bible shows how god forgives that staggering god forgives those stumbling like brother adam said about moses and joshua he's not looking at our mistakes he's looking at the commission praise god he's looking at our office he's looking at our position in christ jesus so the same thing here no doubt jacob would have been afraid just like i would be afraid just like you'd be afraid if someone was going to come around and take a child right but the bible said by faith they were not afraid of the king's commandment amen praise god now look at this woman's faith so faith caused her to reject fear and she cast moses upon the waters in an ark rather than let him die in egypt's hands amen what a what an example of a woman there she said i'd rather take my chances with god's word amen right then just surrender my child over to the government amen i like that praise god in other words church she's an example of god honoring faith praise god in other words here's her example she goes to all lengths to love and protect and train the child that god gives her she'll do anything to keep satan's hands off her children amen what an example of faith that should speak to every every child of god right do everything in your power to obey the word of god never surrender an inch to the government right or an inch to the devil praise god amen see and god so honored that he eventually had the government pay her to raise this child they wanted to destroy [Laughter] i love that praise god and then he would later overthrow egypt praise god and destroy oh their entire army amen what a what a masterpiece of god's story that he writes praise god amen see now both of them look their trust in god they had such trust in god they said i'm not going to obey the government so i'll do everything in my power to preserve the life of this child amen what faith that is so see we learn from jochebed honor god's word despite persecution because peter said we ought to obey god rather than man praise god trust god with your children's destiny that's what she did right she said i don't know what's going to happen lebron said there was alligators swimming all over all around in their river right and she just she had faith that the angels would shoo them away praise god amen so see trust god with the children's destiny god will reward you in ways you cannot imagine amen hallelujah see go to every length to train and protect your children that's why uh there's some things i'm looking at for my family to try to train and protect them a little more by god's grace do everything i can to protect them especially online in other words i might be paying some money to get some software to just protect them even more i've never i did that in the past but then i kind of took that off but i may do that again i just want to go to any lengths to make sure satan can't get a grasp on my children praise god that god would be able to raise them up and help me to sharpen them and train them and do everything in my power to protect them because god has their destiny in his control praise god thank god and what a what an example church to train up a child in the way that he should go and when he's old he's not depart from it when did moses really start serving god at 80 years old wow that's really something 80 years old the mother that cast him in the waters little did you know 80 years later he's finally going to get in his place and he was going to be a murderer right think of all those years she had to struggle with my he left and he's gone but you know she just had to trust there's a purpose for this god's got the destiny of my son and daughters and sons right aaron god's got their destiny in his hand and the devil could have said they haven't done anything they're 60 they're 70 they're 75 they haven't done anything for god and she just had to believe god protected him for a reason god has a purpose for his life amen hallelujah church if that can be if that faith is done under the blood of bulls and goats our faith is stronger under the blood of christ amen that's what we need to believe i'm believing that for my children we got to believe it for all of our children we'll do everything to protect our children train them up and god will control their destiny he'll take them to their destiny and we we can have confidence that god is faithful amen train them up in the way they should go and when he's old like 80 moses won't debart from it oh i love that that's beautiful my goodness 80 years later oh what a testimony yeah we just had that remember i told you that story there's that that a man his name was herb or herb herb his name was herb up at brother samuel's church he just passed away last year right right uh right during cove but he passed away but i don't think it was from covid his daughter got cancer like 10 years before that and she was in her 60s the cancer drove her back to the message god healed her of cancer and she became a message believer in her 60s i got to shake her hand the last time i was there beautiful my that brother that brother just hung on service after service i never even heard him shout sister naomi i never heard him speak in tongues or prophesy or i never saw him stomp or dance in the spirit he just sat there service after service i'd see him cry and i didn't see that he'd amen he'd say hey man you know we gotta have that southern amen i think he's from kentucky or something like that but he just sat there service after service and finally all those prayers all that training they did uh god had a time and season god has a time and season for every baby to be born amen god will visit according to the time of life amen glory what a testimony god bless brother herb and there is god bless the soul there in heaven amen i can't pray for him but may god bless him what a servant of the lord amen so that's that's what we gain from jochebed trust god have faith pray until the fear leaves amen trust god with the destiny of our children have faith that's a great lesson for the bride of christ today amen do everything in your power to protect love and train them and god will fulfill his destiny for their lives all right next is deborah let's go another one here deborah that's actually the third one we did eve jochebed deborah i tried to go in you know the bible order deborah was the prophetess and wife of lapidoth he became a judge in israel during a period of spiritual decline when israel was without male prophetic leadership remember there was no prophets the bible said they did whatever they want during this time and she must have prophesied on a couple occasions because then god used her accurate prophecies to inspire barrick in his victorious attacks against the canaanites just like he used sarah to move abraham in sending away hagar and ishmael remember that god spoke to sarah and said cast out the bondwoman and abraham's like well i need god to tell me that and so abraham went prayed and god confirmed that that's what i told sarah cast out the bondwoman with the bond child because they are not heirs like the free woman right praise god and so prophecy here we see a prophecy can come through our sisters praise god see so the bride learns the power of prophecy from deborah's example amen the bible said the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy praise god you know some of the most outstanding prophecies i've seen have been through women right like our sister karen sanders from uh from lima she's the one that told sister lisa thus saith the lord whatever you pray for you're gonna get and she got it nine months later she got rebecca that was a prophecy thus saith the lord and i was there when it happened and then i was there uh when she kind of gave that discernment with brother brooks outside of the church and our dedication as back in 2007 that boy it's been a while or 2006 rather i was there when it was a total discernment with thus saith the lord and then my wife's even that my wife's dream a prophetic dream of warning to that sister uh that eventually cut her hair left the message and now divorced twice and is almost gone insane uh and she laughed and she scoffed kind of laughed and scoffed at my wife's dream but yet it was prophetic now ezra 6 14 lydia can you read that ezra 6 14 says we always prosper through prophecy so anything the lord prophesies it will make us grow more like christ praise god prophecy is not to make us prideful amen is to make us prosper in the things of god okay so lydia can you read that amen now we know some of the prophecies when we go to hegei right and zechariah the glory of the latter house will be greater than the glory of the farmer right there are certain prophecies that they gave zechariah talked about the oil not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord all these things all these prophecies were given and it encouraged them and they've come to pass some in their day some in nehemiah's day and ezra's day but others in jesus day praise god and some of them will be in the days of uh 144 000 jews praise god when they weep from house to house and said how could we do it we crucified our own messiah right uh so these these prophecies always make you prosper now church i believe this the reason we don't hear more prophecies is because we're not praying and seeking for it right so when was the last time we just had a prayer session god let's all pray for prophecy right so that's something we got to be we got to be open to that i've got to be i've got to be mindful of that you know we got to be the bible said desire spiritual gifts right covet after spiritual gifts that's what i was saying on sunday that's an area where we all can grow in that area right the reason we have not is because we ask that amen that's right that's the word of god we should expect prophetic things if we've got the holy ghost because the spirit of jesus is the spirit of prophecy praise god like i told you that one brother the denominational brother my friend uh he kind of noticed two prophecies about me the one time i prayed god uh remove this principle or change their heart and the next year the principle was removed i didn't even know they're going to retire another one i prayed i said god i said we need a break from bible club then the cronovirus came and we haven't done bible club for over a year now now i know my wife's really enjoyed that i've kind of enjoyed it too i kind of got worn out i prayed for those things and they just came to pass you know uh and god's grace is just god's grace so these things we must pray for and seek right we must seek prophecy they needed prophecy because they were having trouble finishing the wall right they got the temple bill but then they then they they stopped in the middle of building the wall so god sent prophets to stir them up with thus saith the lord praise god and it caused them to prosper and accomplish what god wanted them to accomplish how many want to accomplish god's will for your life amen well then you know i imagine we're going to need some prophecy to do that praise god we need some foretelling of the future tell us what to do or what to expect or what to happen my we can pray for that tonight when we're done remind me we'll pray if i forget remind me let's pray for prophecy at the end of this service here tonight let me write that down pray for prophecy if we've got the holy spirit we should expect the spirit of prophecy to speak to us amen know the few times there's been a few times i've really prayed hard remember i prayed a couple times uh jesus sent the holy spirit to akron for your sake jesus remember i prayed that a few times and a couple of people said they've got the holy ghost to me that's the spirit of prophecy i was burdened to see people born again and we prayed for it and then it happened by god's grace amen all right now see this also teaches us women cannot preach with authority due to eve's deception but they can and have all the rights of the nine spiritual gifts so they can be used in a very supernatural way praise god in other words the woman will never take the man's place can i say like this the bride will never take jesus's place right but at the same time we can do supernatural things if we're submitted to the husband praise god we'll never take his place but we can do little minor things compared to his great work if we're submitted and in tune with this holy spirit like this imagine this philip's four daughters that prophesied can you imagine having a church like that i where any of the four on a sunday will come up maybe once a year twice a year they come up and and they they tell dad they tell their dad philip phillip or daddy the lord gave me a prophecy it's thus saith the lord and then can you imagine it coming to pass four of them they knew these four sisters for sure let me name them out you know rebecca and sarah you know you can just give them names right they're for sure prophets as far as the gift of prophecy because these four sisters now think about their prayer lives these sisters must have been in prayer right that's why i encourage my little daughters right and all the little girls be in prayer if we're going back to the book of acts church we might have some prophetesses here tonight by god's grace amen but we got to pray for it praise god we've got to pray for that imagine a church where four of the little girls we knew were prophets they could they foretold things now for us it might be my dream right like i'm just talking with malachi a couple of dreams seem very prophetic especially the one about his will you know god's will for his life seems very prophetic i gotta go digging through my files i bet i can find some more of you guys dreams over the years we just wrote them down and i just forget about them but the spirit of the lord is the spirit of prophecy all right and we learned that from deborah deborah's an example that be faithful be faithful faithfully prophesy faithfully prophesy and the lord will use you to bring a great victory amen all right let's go next to macau i don't even know how to say this i know it's not michael dave or david's wife but macau lydia would you know how to pronounce that malachi have you heard how to pronounce that i'll just say macau because i can't be michael because michael has its own spelling macau the daughter of king saul wife of david she once saved david's life by helping him escape saul's wrath remember that i think she let him down by a basket right out the window when saul was after him or his men were after him but then church i don't know if you know the story but then she was given away after david fled macau was given away in marriage to another man and later when david got back into power he reclaimed her i don't know how that worked uh maybe they didn't have relations maybe he just married her i don't know how that would work because he couldn't take back a woman that had you know had already had another man's marriage another man had a relation with another man i'm not sure how that worked but he reclaimed her back after he gets on the throne and then david brings the ark back into jerusalem praise god and instead of rejoicing with david she criticizes him in other words that spirit that was on her daddy see how spirits sometimes live in families may god help our spirit our family to be free from evil spirits may our family be known for having the holy spirit praise god amen i don't want any critical spirits or or antichrist spirits or negative spirits we don't want any of those spirits on our family we want the holy spirit on our family but this spirit must have never left too far from that family oh yeah remember the bible said the iniquities of the fathers will be upon the children if they don't repent right so macau must have got a wrong spirit on her and that iniquity of saul came upon her remember the iniquity of salk remember it came upon the whole nation remember they had three years of famine you remember that preached on that on blessings and cursing a few months ago probably more than a few by now the iniquity of the fathers on the children and so david is dancing the bible said all his might now think about how high you could jump children think about think about all your might think about i do that at school sometimes yeah we we exercise think about how hot you can jump david was doing all of his might he probably had sweat on his face he probably had to get out that you know that holy holy cloth and he all of his might as high as he could jump imagine just shouting the bible said he was shouting jumping dancing and praising god he was so grateful that the ark of god which represent the presence of god the presence of god is going to have a permanent home amongst us amen oh my thank god that we can have that too praise god the friends of god can permanently dwell in our little church in our homes in our houses praise god and so david jumped with all of his might and macau stood out the window and brother brandon said he said she went like this just disk holy roller [Laughter] tis this disc holy roller that's what she said she called him a holy roller in her heart she despised all that freedom and all that joy and all that jumping and worshiping and god said because you've done that you're cursed your womb is cursed and you'll not bring forth children so that means she could have they could have had relations again right so he uh she must have not had any relations with that other husband so despising the holy ghost brings bareness right despising real worship brings barrenness now that was in the natural now i think that's a sad thing too but what's worse is spiritual barrenness that's worse because the bride the bride remember these are lessons we should learn as bride right bride members know the importance of inspired worship expressing in singing dancing shouting and more praise god amen paul said in first thessalonians 5 19 quench not the holy spirit so don't put a damper and a damper and say oh quiet down quiet down we should let our children shout and praise the lord amen we should let our adults praise the lord amen you don't want to quench that when uh when you feel like something's going to break inside of you let it out children when you feel like god wants you to cry or scream scream praise god let it out don't quench it let out that worship because god inhabits the praises of his people praise god amen now can i talk about that right remember when you were younger and you felt malachi was younger and he said he said a spirit came upon him and it was so powerful he had to stop singing that's what you're that's what you told me i've been going through the notes lately of our our old conversations and i've had that too i know if i keep singing i'm gonna cry happens to me quite a bit but i've realized it's for worship it's for me to express my love to god because that's what dave was doing he was just expressing his love for god god loves it when it were emotional for him right he in other words he loves sincere worship praise god he loves somebody who worships in the spirit and in truth and so when we feel that we've got to be willing to let that go and praise god and not stand there and say this what a holy oh man david knew david see david had already cast out devils amen david already cast out devils by music and he knew that when you worship god and you sing it's going to drive away the devils amen he knew they have liberty in the holy spirit and so that's why he was shouting dancing praising god he knew if god's presence was in the church if god's presence was in the camp god's people should be joyful god's people should be free god's people will be worshippers amen hallelujah but see churches that reject that like a lot of message churches they will go childless meaning they'll be cursed and nobody be born again by the holy ghost what a sad church that is just as natural babies are born noisily so are spiritual babies born with some noise and the church said there's got to be noise when the baby's born right there's got to be noise and that's what david's example was showing us and michael was here the example of what we shouldn't do we should learn not to uh criticize that but be thankful for that praise god now here's what i've seen overseas and other other services too one time i was preaching uh in south america and there's a girl in the back so just you know it was a really long it's about this wide this the congregation but it's really long there's maybe 100 people there maybe i'm probably exaggerating but anyways we were singing and there's this woman in the back and she started going like this and the women around her are like getting hit you know just trying to contain her and i thought later i thought that wasn't the holy ghost and it wasn't it was the devil because when the holy ghost is on you you won't hurt other people praise god and they we talked to that woman later she had some issues in her life i don't know of his divorce or abuse i don't remember what it was but that demon i just called the prayer line and i was praying for people in the prayer line so people were getting free god was answering prayer and that demon didn't like it right and i don't know if they brought it up for prayer i think they just escorted her out but the times i've seen that when people are just out of control hurting people it's the devil because it's trying to distract uh from deliverance right but the same time i've had a woman bite me i told you that bite me on the shoulder and she was but i held onto her hand and pretty soon she let out a scream fell down and she was set free praise god hallelujah and so david knew when the word is there people are going to be free they're going to get victory there's power demons will flee when there's freedom of the holy spirit that's what we need today freedom of the holy spirit praise god and let the let the ones that want to be filled with the holy ghost be filled with the holy ghost praise god no matter how much they sing or shout or pray or cry whatever let them be filled with the holy ghost that's what we're here for praise god we're not here to die and become a denomination we're here to rise and go to heaven praise god that's why we're here praise god i don't want a dead church you don't want a dead church we want a living church praise god so macau is best resembled by judas iscariot because judas degraded lazarus's sister mary when she had those costly spikenard and anointed jesus's feet with her long uncut hair the bible said right so we follow the example of the bride by getting in the spirit with fully loudly loudly worshiping god with bodies and emotions despite reproach from judas iscariot type mockers go to acts 4 here let's so sometimes church i just want to encourage the church hopefully i know all this well hopefully the saints are watching us if they're you know on archive or something here's what i like to see a little more too we talked about praying for gifts i like to see our church do this just feel free to pray loud when we pray out loud pray out loud you know when we pray at the end of the service just pray louder you know you don't have to be a whisper my voice don't have to be the loudest one right because when the holy ghost fell in acts 4 the bible said they they lifted up their voice to god so it wasn't he lifted up his voice can you put that up there hun it's acts 4 24. sometimes i feel like my voice is the only one that's loud and that's fine sometimes but when where when the holy spirit is really here you know and really moving and we've you know really created a good atmosphere i should hear more than just my voice loud right and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord see that's unity when when everybody can get in the holy spirit there's unity and everybody feels like they're talking to god amen oh that's what we need praise god amen not just me i get free up here i feel the holy spirit i feel liberty i feel joy and power and love and my eyes many times i'll lift my voice but here in the book of acts when the holy ghost fell in this prayer meeting everybody or lots of people were lifting up their voices to god amen so that's what we want to see we have you know young children and they're sensitive but we want our girls and our sons and our daughters we want to have them to know the freedom of the holy ghost that they can cry they can lift their voice they can praise god they can be free because jesus is the really really he's the one we're pleasing he's the one we're trying to contact he's the one we're trying to talk to and jesus loves to hear our voices amen hallelujah thank god but see judas and macau don't like that that antichrist spirit satan doesn't like that loud worship and praising god and worshiping god satan doesn't like that but god loves it amen david oh david was a man after god's own heart praise god and so he gave all of his emotion out of his body all of his self he gave it to god and god said that's the kind of man i like amen hallelujah i'd rather choose him he's better than saul thank god there we go well it's almost down to 40 minutes three more minutes apartment this is the real kind of church praise god the real kind of church loves this emotion holy ghost power uh go to verse 29 i'm just finished with this let's just finish with this now i'm not going to move on to next one was hannah i'll save that one for later that's our good friend hannah graham but the bible hannah by god's grace look at this prayer meeting it's a prayer meeting and church i want to be more loud and prayer too you know i gotta i gotta be open to this we gotta pray for this and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word now they're already lifting up their voices in verse 24 right they lift up their voice with one accord and they're praying to god and worshiping and then they're saying part of their prayer they're going to pray this and say lord we're being threatened but give us boldness to speak your word praise god in the midst of threats right just like with jochebed right in the midst of threats take away my fear give me faith what does this lesson teach us it means in prayer sometimes children you've got to get louder when the holy spirit comes upon you you got to follow with the holy spirit and that spirit will cast out fear it's god's love anointing you and that will cast out all fear praise god amen this wasn't a quiet prayer meeting this was a loud holy ghost meeting amen they're praying for boldness god give us boldness i need boldness they're threatening us and jail time and squeeze time they're threatening to squeeze my we need boldness so they they prayed sincerely they got sincere they got loud they didn't get quiet like a michael and or macau and judas kind of service and i'm not saying every servant you know me not every service has to be loud i'm just saying like when the holy ghost is there there's going to be some time so you need to be loud praise god we're because we're we're moved by god he's flowing through our our emotions praise god but ram said there's going to be emotions but don't focus on the emotion he said focus on the promise amen that's right lebron says you just keep quoting acts 2 38 and the holy ghost will come amen oh thank the lord praise god see they had loud voices they prayed to be more bold by the holy spirit praise god look at verse 30 30 by stretching forth on hand to heal so lord how are we going to be boldness how are we going to have this boldness we're going to stretch forth our hands and you're going to anoint our hands to heal the sick that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spoke the word of god with boldness amen may god grant us boldness and the church said amen let's stand to our feet praise god i'll stop right there i've been going longer because i've been getting here later i got here early today let's pray for that i got right there let's pray for prophecy church i believe the bible's true how many believe the bible is true you have not i have not because i ask not right and the bible says you ask not or brother man i made this song right you ask not because you believe not i believe in the power of prophecy okay you can stop the live stream god bless our live streamers love you hope to see you on sunday by god's grace
