lot for a man who knows God amen so I appreciate what the testimony Lords brought in my brother there and I'm looking forward to what the Lord is getting ready to do a man I know he's got great things

and then brother Malachi Andy yeah I got some real gifts around here so we appreciate everybody appreciate the poll appreciate the love for God and I know if we do these things we will find ourselves closer to the Lord we're looking for a mature word in this hour I'm this morning obviously for those who are here I preached on the hidden plan of the Messiah kine and by God's grace this evening I'm not going to continue that I could but I feel like this other area is a little bit more important to go if we can I got a PowerPoint I'll just let that be if we can and let's open up our Bibles to Ephesians 1 verse 2 love my brother I appreciate it and um like I said it's good to see these these youngsters Savior sister Lydia and all them just they got the sound booth they got taken care of amen so I think that's great and there it is this really helped out the church at home and it's been a real blessing I'll tell you what I'm how many grown in Christ I sure appreciate it amen and like I was just telling the brother the brothers a testimony back here even last week we had his name was Carlos Rico he's actually a fella who attends the church actually brother Joseph has his name called me said he said hey we got a baptism today so he he brought this Carlos Rico's but Rico buys as a Catholic and a 16 year old kid and and you know he comes out and anyway after service looked like they were he really enjoyed service and then in the back then he came in back after service to get baptized and you know he began to tell me that that you know God had shown him a dream of brother Joseph wearing that yellow tie they and brother Joseph like brother I just bought it yesterday and Carlos Rico had a dream that whenever it was a little bit before that of Joseph being with him with a yellow tie and he said he said and then I was I was around brother Mike he said I seen a guy in my dream with a wheelchair and I'm like well glory to God I said I think God's calling you for something so anyway I started going and preacher mode on him and I just started hitting him and I started nailing the Catholic Church and I was in back in my office nailing with the Catholicism and and just trying hitting some of those things and I looked at him and he was wearing a t-shirt and he had goosebumps all up and down his arms and you could tell him was on his neck and I I stopped him it's cold my office I said I said hey what's what's going on there I said it's kind of cold back I turn on some heat for you he said no he said I in my dream he said you were hitting me up with the Catholic Church so I said well it looks like this is a baptism that needs to happen so keeping their prayers name's Carlos this young young pleasant young man and I believe God's got a plan for him but like I said we've been watching Lord just do phenomenal things and and I believe it's gonna continue and I'll tell you what I'm gonna keep speaking like a son of God because I have we have two brother sister we have to ask for big things we have to be an expectation I'm not talking about Mercedes Benz and and mansions we're talking about Souls we're talking about growing spiritually in Christ and as we'll see tonight we're talking about growing as a church amen let's go to Ephesians 1 2 if we can like I said we appreciate your attentiveness and your desire to come back to the house of God certainly the word is true betters one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere amen Ephesians 1 verse 2 so if the pastor wants to finish things off from this morning they'll be his call and I know he'll do a he'll do a better job than anyway so we appreciate that and Ephesians 1 verse 2 says here says grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ oh my sweet I pray that be upon us today he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love all right by by God's grace notice that's third verse it says who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ all right so notice if you're in heavenly places with Christ you have all spiritual blessings let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer as we approach the author or most beloved Jesus Christ our Lord our Savior we're so thankful God for the revelation of this our Lord and as we now humbly come before you now each and every one of us Lord we just pray O God that you give us strength griffiths as he'll tonight as we enter and approach the Word of God you know Lord how just to get a couple services Lord and how the enemy will fight us with fatigue and and try to make us tired and so forth we're just asking Oh God you'd be upon us O God may this word O God may it be something to strike the hearts of the believers Oh God maybe something on God that would take them up higher oh god in their expectation in their understandings of their role in position Lord and may Oh God they see Oh God even their respective churches begin to grow higher and higher Oh God adieu to what you're doing in their lives Oh God we know God it's a it's a bride work in this our Lord so just take each and every one higher add your blessings to the reading of this word I pray Leah give me strength O God as I get ready to minister as well we just love you and ask you to have your way in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated keep me in prayer Here I am we ate and we went to eat a giant eagle and I think an eagle walked out there a giant I think it done ain't too much so by God's grace we appreciate the Lord and we'll just get into this thought tonight I think we'll be all right amen but notice here we want to focus on this verse here in Ephesians 1:3 tonight we want to bring this thought if we can the atmosphere of heavenly places all right it's certainly an hour that we're living in our expectation at the house of God amen we didn't come here for former fashion we didn't come here to be seen of men or or to even do a duty to a person or to an individual but we've actually come to join with one another in heavenly places the scripture would say Amen and I want you to begin to work with this heavenly place here and show you what our prophet said about this and tie it in with the word if we can because you know heavenly place it's an expectation you have to have and then God actually calls every individual to be in a place to operate these things and to help bring it forth alright but I want you to see here will take first a little look at atmosphere of that word atmosphere notice the atmosphere of heavenly places and atmospheres the pervading tone or a mood of a place situation or work of art right so notice even in your own life if you begin to delve into carnal things if you're if you're too much you know into work for this or maybe you're too much into a fellowship for your phone or or whatever entertain maybe you'll actually find that you will not have a Holy Ghost atmosphere around you as strong as it is supposed to be all right and the reason why an atmosphere was meant a lot to be pervading all right it was actually supposed to be something to dominate amen and I even this message our prophet brought us into a place that we he told us that each and every one of us we create an atmosphere in it you create an atmosphere that ushers falleth from your life amen people see it remember even brought into a place he said he said notice if you want to be around that people by the atmosphere they create a mitt so people are actually long to be liked or to be with you if you are creating that atmosphere of God a lot of times they meant and why is that you're putting forth the creator of heavens in Earth how could they not want to be in that atmosphere amen hallelujah so notice each one of us gives off an atmosphere whether it's a godly one whether it's a carnal one perhaps it's an atmosphere in this hour earlier to see an atmosphere high this kind of lukewarm this kind of hanging around Amen you know God no owners to be lukewarm he wants us to be hotter called amen and I don't want to be cold I would be hiding it so we can put forth an atmosphere in the house of God that is hot amen amen nice and warm why it's not you're yet you invited a preacher or that you're expecting here for a preacher you're expecting to hear from God himself working by a gift he placed in an individual limit so God will speak to but what he requires atmosphere and let's begin to work with this if we can Ephesians 1:18 here now you're gonna see a characteristic and I'm going to hit it in just a moment here but I want us to notice so we opened up with Ephesians 1 there and now we're moving a little bit further down in the chapter and Ephesians 1:18 I like this because remember you're supposed to pray for revelation more than anything else hallelujah we need revelation amen hallelujah not intellectual revelation we need a revelation of who we are right we need a revelation of the two spirits in the framework of the church in it we need to work with stand those and then allow the Holy Ghost to make us an invincible army right so if reasons 1:18 it says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened huh so we all have eyes but notice these eyes of your understanding okay what do you perceive the word to be and Paul says he says let the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that he may know what is the hope of his calling right what's his calling for us right and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints all right there's an inheritance that the church has amen we already know what the down payment of the inheritance is and that's pretty good to begin with in it he couldn't have gave us anything later than the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's what he called us to but notice here he said and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who beneath there is an exceeding greatness of power that is available to those who believe now according to our power no but according to the locking of his mighty power amen now notice he says which he wrought in Christ all right so he brought this fourth in Christ when he raised him from the dead so notice and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places so when Christ raised from the dead and was set at the right hand of God or the power and authority of God he went to air heavenly places but notice when he delivered to the church verse 19 the greatness of his power that came forth when Christ said what all power in heaven and earth is given to me amen so all that Christ is is now given to the church right it's over play with rotisserie times but yet so true all that the father was he poured into Christ and all those in Christ was poured into the church all right so here Christ is sitting in heavenly places it says far above all principality and power and might and Dominion oh don't you love him and every name that is named and not only in this world but also in that which is to come you realize he's far above every principality in power right now it's not just then oh I hope we get far enough I'm gonna show you some things that all right but notice he says and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church brother Jesse's not running this church he was given the position of stewardship as the pastor of this church but leading my brother here is the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah and that means that he that is all-powerful omnipotent risen from the dead and yes everything under his feet is leading this church ma he says he's given him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all and all the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all know that means his fullness is right here he's in our midst I like how your prophet would say said he said the Holy Ghost moving moving up and down the aisles wooing you realize by the sister this might sound a little bit much to you but it's not you realize if if that prophet was given a spiritual eye he could see a black shadow over someone there's black shadows today they don't leave and you realize that that same time it he could look and see a light that light is still here hallelujah are they about three years going to church huh I was just in the back I wouldn't even preaching at night and a brother was up there is preaching oh hey and I was and I was just worshippers at a bad house on my feet and I was having a good time in the house of God and all of a sudden I looked at that preacher and I'm like you got to be kidding me and I looked at Mike I must be dazed and I looked and there's a pillar fire right by him and I look at it me I had to do the double take I was in the back so I didn't nobody see me that's probably pretty good I look nice and I said well that's right over the preacher and I kind of this did it did kind of like my eyes to make sure I was seeing I'm saying and I said and it was right over it was right between the preacher and brother Dave and I was sitting in the back and I looked and I said God if that's there I should be able to move so I moved to my side and I looked and it was right above brother Dave's right shoulder but oh well so I told him I think I hope he feels good now but I seen that pillar of fire I thought of I said well you know what that same right that same pillar of fire that same Holy Ghost he comes in our myths hallelujah and tonight I want to get us into what that means all right so notice what is before us right now so we have to see the initial principle it was Christ our husband what now he's working in his bride but what he is sitting in heavenly places so I wonder if he's called his church to be in heavenly places what does that mean let's go so in 63 Christ is mystery of God revealed he says how do you get into Christ Jesus knows Christ mystery of God revealed here a very powerful message by joining church congregation says no they had that much we know better net Amen it says by a verse it says by one spirit first Corinthians 12 we're all baptized into one body see he said alright that's the one he's talking to that eight addressed to the outside world we can't talk to the sinner on this because he knows nothing about it Paul didn't address it to no sinners he said this is so that group that's that's in Christ Jesus he says grace be unto you and peace from the God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're about in heavenly places in Christ now look at this heavenly places oh how I wish I had time well I got time to take tonight today going what he said about it here I've got it marked right here my Bible about heavenly places what years heavenly places heavenly places just for a moment is the believers position in Christ in heavenly places according us here chosen us chose us in him before the foundation of the world so notice he works with the baptismal goes how were born in that body that way and then he says what he says heavenly places that is the believers in Christ you are position right now it doesn't change when you go from morning service the night service or from night service the wednesday service you are position being born again by the Holy Ghost is a position to dwell in heavenly places oma I wonder let's take a look but notice he ties it in with the Holy Ghost and let's find a good and a good place for this to be at so notice here a Holy Ghost atmosphere in acts 2:1 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled on a house where they were sitting and then appeared unto them cloven tongues like his a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance hmm Oh to have been there though we're here 63 remembering the Lord he says did he notice on the day of Pentecost what a great thing we have there that God who led the children of Israel through the wilderness he that great pillar of fire and on the day of Pentecost this great fire fell and then divided itself among his people all to think that he wants us to sit together in heavenly places each one of us enjoying that walks of the fire of the Holy Spirit amen that warmth is here right now cloven tongues set upon them like fire lips of fire God dividing his self amongst the church oh my he said all wouldn't that though just set a heart's burning notes that's when we can come together in heavenly places Oh mom so every time notice from the original in Christ's resurrection he said when we get together and the holy ghost is among us and that warmth that precious feeling of the Holy Ghost surround us he said there how many places is ma I got a little picture for you ain't gonna do it no justice but I want you to look at it heavenly places now let me ask you of course we see our four creatures here scripture says it remember they're around just around the throne just like just like they were around the ark and so forth and we got your elders and there's the throne heavenly places now let me ask you I want this to really soak in do you realize that you should be here right now now we're quiet he said that if we get like the original this is what some in our midst he said you've now what come into a heavenly place and understand this would it be heaven if it was just for beasts around you know would it be heaven if 24a elders or or perhaps just just some of the the Majesty's of the throne and everything was around you would that be heaven there's really only one heaven it's a person hallelujah there's only one place of rejoicing hallelujah and that is when God Himself seats himself in your midst amen you see a lot of times we come into this place and we say okay we're here at church but do you realize that the scripture said we're setting together in heavenly places now I'm gonna bring a couple little tidbits here in just a moment here because I want you to see this I want you to see this now now he begins to tell us about heavenly places and I want you to see this as beautiful 61 true Easter seal he says now we are sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said now we realized that Jesus the body of Jesus was up from the resurrection he's read that right he said now we know that the Bible speaks of three heavens we know it first heaven second heaven and third heaven I believe it was Paul caught away into the third heaven and seen things that wasn't expedient for him to speak of them Omaha now notice he said no the first heaven is called in the scripture like the clouds all right just like the atmosphere right in other words down below here on the earthling seal now notices when that atmosphere from above up in above clouds become down into into the church that's a heavenly place now notice then he of course what he's doing he denotes what the second and third are he said the second heavens is considered the solar system and the third heaven goes beyond that there's three heavens we were around one right somebody correct the preacher in our natural beings we're here in the clouds in the atmosphere around us there's your first heaven the second heaven is watch space and then the third heaven is what in the dimension of heaven itself now I want you to see this because you have to believe this and expect it your prophet says that you can actually get that atmosphere from up above the clouds and it comes down into the church he said that's a heavenly place do you realize how God position you as a believer he actually made a Christian a true Holy Ghost filled Christian to be able to transform God himself and bring down an atmosphere of the heavenlies right into the midst of a service he made you into a place where you can do that how we doing you see what our expectation how we change our expectation of the church because you notice how he talks about this he's always talking about the church we're sitting together sitting together see that's why your prophet said he said he said we have to make it count especially when we come to the house of God now I'll just go on mourn and I'll get to it but I want you to see here it's your choice it doesn't matter how service has been it doesn't matter when I was like last month or last week or what it was this morning you have the ability if you believe it to draw God out of the heavenlies and bring him right into your midst oh my why do you think they couldn't get away from church you know all these revivals that they have Church every single day why in the world do they have every church every day these because of some discipline or or what is it is it because it was boring when they got into that spirit of revival what they tapped into a resource of how to pull the heavenlies down in their myths oh ma that'll make Church put a smile on your face that'll make one that'll make demons run and in cancer free the building what because heaven is in the mess and Satan cannot dwell there you want to tell me the ideal that God has for Bride of Christ fellowship it's heavenly places he didn't make us so this guy over here has to be here he made you with all the potential do it even if there's three or four of you here memory of prophesied he said some of his greatest means was this a couple people for some true believers that go her to God we say well we don't know we're okay we don't need it that kind of atmosphere in our mess well your prophet says in 56 supernaturally says he said that's the reason sometimes a divine life that's been called and set aside has become a fanatic or crazy or I missed it or something to the eyes of the general public is because you're considered I'd say an Iraq an insane person hey you know I look like insane I look insane the message people sometimes you'll see some looks I get sometimes and I'm sitting here and I'm like man God have mercy help me come however I've seen God do stuff and I'm telling you what I'm gonna believe for more we have to this is the atmosphere he's called us to in one scripture I get I'm gonna hit you at the point okay so notice he said is because that you've changed your dwelling place and got into a different atmosphere and your own motive your one thoughts is to stay in that atmosphere brother Branham was living in an atmosphere where all his only thought was to stay in that atmosphere notice well it was just for the profit oh wait what about that hidden little plan of the Messiah any person that ever come into that atmosphere one time will never be satisfied nowhere else and that's why I believe that we should have our churches under control by the Holy Ghost that men and women in their work and wherever they should be should continually desire and they will I will force you to love God your preacher don't have to force you to come to church you come to church because you love God amen and he loves you he first loved you a men should continually desire they will if they've ever once come into you can't be satisfied out of that atmosphere of the Holy Ghost you see it's good when you live there with a personal feeling but I'll tell you what you get a group of believers with a personal feeling Fillie hallelujah that's like we're saying earlier that that that's when you get to a place that when you have to leave that a presence you have some tears well up because you're not just leaving individual you've even God hallelujah notice once again Ephesians 2 verse 4 are you noticing a familiar book that we're actually pulling from every time here glory hallelujah Ephesians too far he says but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us remember what mercy is there's no other word in the English language like mercy the closest word to Mercy is grace but grace is only unmerited favor mercy completely supersedes grace because mercy is actually when you hurt and injure someone and they still turn around and look at you and say I accept you rich in mercy why do you think could look at Paul after he's consenting to Christians death and he said knock him off he loved him enough that he brought a pillar of fire his way and knocked him off a horse ah I knew you and said I've called you to this work go down to Joppa holiday Riya I start feeling good I'll tell you if he since 2 5 so notice he loved you even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved so notice when you are dead in sin he quicken you he quickened us excuse me together with Christ what is moving into his perfect picture for the sister we're moving what to the plan of his election that's why you're in the right place that God ordains you to be that's why that these things don't happen by chance but God has a purpose and a mission and he will live it out amen notice 6 verse so by grace you're safe he quickened you together when you were dead and what and hath raised us up apart you go over here you go over here he's raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so what do you do he has brought you to the position that he's made you sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus no I want to stop here for a moment have you noticed three times we come twice out of Ephesians one heavenly places again heavenly places now we come to Ephesians two heavenly places you know what makes this distinct you realize the joining of heavenly places is only shown four times in the scriptures do you realize every single time that heavenly places is strong together it is in the book of Ephesians well what is Ephesians Ephesians is the mature church Ephesians it did not you realize your God could have placed that in Corinthians he did not put it in Corinthians but he placed it right in Ephesians they could handle the mature they are getting in line of the Holy Spirit and that's something all the gifts that are made known in Corinthians and here he couldn't even tell Corinthians he had to bring it out to a church that is sitting there in the maturity of the word remembering things in church shorter in 63 year prophets said he said that one he said Ephesians he said God didn't have to correct Ephesians about the gifts they already had them in order Corinthians was the one who have an issue with that but remember you go in the scripture you read about Corinthians and remember they come to Corinth and God told I believe as Paul he said I there's many souls that are in this place but you look at Ephesians it was just a lot of small pulling out I don't mind having a small church it's alright I'll take each man his own right not to do it in a small church of five people he can do it a thousand amen but it's our expectation and what we're dealing with the learned that is sown in our midst amen remember we're not just years of the world we're dealers of the word so to the mature church Christ could raise them up and make them sit together in heavenly places well could you tell me a little bit more about it sure will so 6312 one and absolutely says he says now you see we are not a divided people we got to be in unity because each one of us holding a part of God how many believe you're holding a part of God two of you board of God amen all right for haneda gotta feel good [Laughter] that's how we do a lot of times let's make sure we're all paying attention doesn't make sure our going forward amen hey you know I just read the quote your prophet was talking he said he said it's a devil that comes and tries to make you fall asleep in the service you getting tired yeah say no devil no go do I need to go back to that picture of the of the four beasts in the throne how many times you think I'm four beasts are falling asleep right there and get wore out see but here's the thing this is the revelation we're coming to you Satan is not allowed in our services I'll tell you what if if God could anoint Paul to preach all day and make tents at night there's enough God in this hour that we can go I know hey I am I am there right with you tell you I got my own strategy a lot of times I've if I start getting tired and I'm not preaching I got to stand up it helps a preacher to because I think they got an extra Amen Corner out there over the cod Alleluia but we all avoid then overcomers they met so notice you're holding a part of God right here he says we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in its in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sets together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power God is in his search what does it look like each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again oh my so when his church gets to that maturity and a nice sense of fire is coming in the gifts are coming in hallelujah don't worry the gifts ain't the stopping point to the sister we're not stopping we're not stopping there we're going back to Eden brother sister we'll go do the ritual the third poll takes us right back to the beginning okay so notice we'll just go to that third verse notice what he says he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ amen so now that you're together now that you're joined together that spiritual blessings all of them are right with us right now that's where we take our revelation to anybody need any spiritual blessings I'll take care of them I'll take them home you know sometimes makes you wonder we just got to be like be like that king I believe the lie should talk to me out you got to shoot those arrows or deliverance don't stop at three all Avena keep shooting them until the enemy is dead amen so we come down to the message of adoption and he says all he said less let's not just one more minute here in heavenly places he says now just not out anywhere but in heavenly places we are assembled in heavenly it means that the position of the believer who you read that before let's see what he says notice notice catch this sketch let's catch this that if I'm prayed up you're prayed up or the church sprayed up and we're all ready for the message and we have assembled ourselves together as Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called here that did set together in heavenly places now we are heavenlies in our souls all this is like heaven to me praise God our spirits has brought us into a heavenly atmosphere oh brother there you are he says a heavenly atmosphere all what could happen tonight what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a home in the atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated become a new creature in Christ Jesus see that now notice he's wanting that for the church said oh if we could just be there he says all sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God and a hearts lifted setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in the heavenly places he said did you ever set in one oh I've set two I would weep for joy and say God never let me leave here just heavenly places in Christ Jesus see how he distinguishes that see we can all say oh oh heavenly places hallelujah but your prophet said when you get in that heavenly atmosphere you see what his presence is so strong you know he's there but you know whether sister a lot of times it's just his presence is unrecognized because he said where two or more gathered there I am in the midst that means he has to be here so notice did he ever sit one like that let me ask you when was the last time you sat in the service and just weep for joy and say God never let me leave here Oh don't let these doors shut tonight just let me stay here all night I don't want to leave here what would make you want to do that see when you've brought down from that third atmosphere and brought the Lord down to such a place that he's dwelling right in the midst of you so god don't ever let me leave here some if he's in church here glory to God somebody else a going to God look what's here a man he's not done blessing us with what look what happens in heavenly places we everybody brought all in heavenly places heavenly places look at what happens in heavenly places divine healing for knowledge talk about the Messiah revelation visions power of songs interpretations wisdom knowledge all the heavenly places memory said all spiritual blessings and here he tells us what they are whoo how about this one he'll see we can get you some smiles around and joy unspeakable and full of glory you mean that joy can have a glory that manifests he says every heart filled with the spirit walking together sitting together in heavenly places not one evil thought among us now on cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or other not one evil thought nobody got anything against one of the everybody speaking in love in harmony everybody with one Accord in one place then suddenly look he brings it right back then sorry there came from heaven a sound of the rushing that it would there you are has blessed us with all spiritual blessings did you realize this is the ordained message church that right there I'm leaving the denominational message realms and I'm entering into heavenly places I should never denominator CH I don't have a right to I don't have a right to control my church do we all understand this no man has a right to bring humanism into the church hallelujah I just seen a quote verses in 54 your prophet said he said if it comes to a place that we have to draw our youth to church with ping-pong and was ill and bingo or something like that Bunco or something like that something like that he said if I had the drawl in the trench with Bunco and and ping-pong healthiest Bunco it's another thing but he said he said if it ever comes to a place like that he said we've got to get to the altar and get the fire-god and on this they met hallelujah cuz he said what should draw our children to charge the quickening spirit of the Holy Ghost that's personal that's why I did that I got church so what happens once heavenly places in your midst go sound pretty good already can you add to that he'll he did he said then the Holy Spirit might fall upon somebody and say thus saith the Lord wait a minute you mean just brother branham oh boy I return ministry scripture oh boy here's how close we've been looking for no he said it might fall on somebody that mean that might mean you who are you you you are you are you are you and say thus saith the Lord has that ever come out of your mouth sure prying regards to brother Branham but did you know God wants to put you in a heavenly place that he speaks from your mouth like that to the or the church has to keep things in order but we have to come to a place we have confidence in god we trust' the Lord hallelujah we just had the Holy Ghost for a couple weeks ago her brother stood up and never heard of do it for spoke in tongues and then interpreted it said glory to God kind of rough he said he said he said this church is gonna have a hard battle coming up all right oh let's do we're here to find storage tanks let's get out of here I'm tired of this world nothing awful so the Holy Spirit might fall on somebody and say thus saith the Lord go to a certain place and do a certain thing that's what happened to me this morning glory to God he said watch it he said happened just like that he said see thus saith the Lord do a certain thing in a certain place watch it happen like that blessed us together in all heavenly blesses blessings in heavenly places watch now before we close on that you see how he opened on that he said if all of us he said if the pastor's praying he said in your praying and the whole church is praying getting into the spirit letting the Holy Ghost have preeminence in his midst in our midst that's where we're at notice her last verse on Ephesians here talking about heavenly places it says Ephesians 3:8 he says unto me Who am less than the least of All Saints is this grace given oh so it will come to the least of us hallelujah amen and the church said hallelujah is this grace unit that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the mystery of this fellowship rather what is the Fellowship of miss of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things in Jesus Christ this has been hit and who's he speaking into Ephesians the mature church remember your prophet said he said there must come in Ephesians to this you realize the Ephesians word has to be sown but we have to become a doer of that word - that's why we say Messiah s you are a doer of that word so what are you waking up tomorrow as a messiah at what are you going home mass in just a few moments a Messiah at then what do you expect the anointing your God to dwell with you O God never let me leave you so if there's only an intensivist oh there is 10 verse to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be made may be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church heaven belongs to you holy people by how manifold wisdom of God you realize if you feel like you have no wisdom you feel like you're dumb you think you have a bad personality all you do is go to the James run and it says let every man ask liberally who has need of wisdom and God will give it to you look at my core scripture quoted perfectly there but here I am saying he said ask for wisdom because God will give it to you liberally realize that well now I thought I got a memorized offer or being a quote theologian no God said you asked him for wisdom a met in there while Solomon did he said God you just give me wisdom to rule your people and God said you asked for wisdom you've asked for a right thing I'll give you honor I'll give you power I'll be in your midst and I'll blast shame it okay I don't know where we've been out here geometry algebra let's take it a little bit further fifty-six divine love he says now notice this atmosphere you know that's in the midst of us right now how you feel you get the joy joy unspeakable folklore yet amen hallelujah he said you know you'll be crazy to the world when you do that because you've come out of that of the atmosphere you're in into this other atmosphere now look at this when you do that God lifts you right up from the world and you live in a heavenly atmosphere whoo you mean I don't have to live in this atmosphere right here you mean I can work a job and I can be in an atmosphere up here well you'll be down here with that atmosphere up there now look this is powerful don't miss this and then to the world you're just contrary to what that is and this is contrary to the world now what you want to do okay what do I want to do it says what you want to do is be lifted up by Christ into an atmosphere to where you are happy and peaceful and then in there you create a situation and now many times we in churches this may seem strange that if you watch this is for the church it's for the people so God wants you and I to live in an atmosphere that were happy and peaceful that's that heavenly atmosphere and he says when you get yourself out of the atmosphere down here that's the press of a press event and all the above and this carnality and when you get yourself into a home in the atmosphere they know what you gotta do is be happy and peaceful you realize peaceful means that you're not worried about anything near is peaceful means you're satisfied and content in your situation and then once you're there he said you can create situation wait a minute so you're a master of every circumstance then huh that sounds familiar I just make that up or is that in the message somewhere I'm sorry feel good he said the people get one another spirit in that something instead of getting the Holy Spirit you go into a group of people and you watch the way that a person acts and them kind of them kind people that come into that congregation the first thing you know they act the same way Shh that's something you take on a pastor spirit you take on oh well this is the brother in the church everybody wants to be around and then you watch out and everybody starts acting like him I've seen it I've seen it where where where where where that brother everybody's drawn Jimmy's a joker but he saw castigating sarcastically jokes on everybody hurts people's feelings and then you know people draw to that next you know this are cast you can that hurt everybody's feelings and then and then there's no way God in their myths cuz the first issues the first brother should have got right and got the foolish jesting out in the coarse jesting and just saw God in peace and happiness that's why I'm not much of a joker sorry used to be that's a sarcastic Joker but God told me it's better to not be jokey at all you can just be serious and talk about the word all right hallelujah I'll back to creating a situation he said you are he said you take a good woman and a bad man he will either he will either become a good man or her a bad woman in the atmosphere that you live in you project to your associates what you are at heavenly atmosphere heavenly places oh it's when we're together oh how we can go even to a workplace and have that atmosphere of the Lord right upon us you ever been there expected 7 5 6 7 years ago I went to work I'm gonna tell you this what was alright but I want to work and there's this guy there and everybody's electrician you could tell you was that he had done a lot of drugs absolutely done a lot of drugs and I was real nice to him you know I didn't see him a lot but I see me hey how you doing buddy you know this real buddy like and one day I was in this room working and this guy this crazy guy everybody called crazy he comes running in the room and he says he said man he said you are the real deal I said what he's like you are like Jesus in disguise he said there is like this crazy light all over you and I've been worshiping that day I just sitting there I was I was having a good time in the Lord and I could feel the anointing he said there's this crazy like light around you he said I knew you were the real deal he said you're like Jesus in flash and I said really he's like he's like he's like I'ma be honest with you I knew you were the real deal I said how'd you know that I said I'm a Christian I believe in Jesus Christ I believe I got the truth they said he said remember a couple of weeks ago he said we're all staying there circling you were there and they began telling all those dirty jokes he said I seen you walk away you didn't even laugh he said I knew there was something different about you he could call it a crazy light but I call it the Holy Ghost that's happened twice for the sister hallelujah others Tony test points you got to expect it we're all amateur God's people none of your brother a sister a little kid little kid anyway your little Oh hallelujah expect God in your midst worship him like he's eat your meals it's like David said I always put the Lord before my face don't you see where he wants to take us he says this is strange but it's for the church he wants to put you in an atmosphere that you can create situations see this this is not this is not once we're in the Millennium brother/sister oh oh okay I didn't realize what's next let's just go there Jaxson divine healing 54 he said the devil was just trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put something off somewhere else and say some of these days you'll be this this is what we've been living under we don't have to live under this he said no we are sons of God he said you are now he said he said now we're seated together in heavenly places I feel good he says now we have all powers in heaven and earth he said see now we have it what's sitting here right now draw him here see he moved by your desires remember he said if someone loves dancing he said they'll get in the spirit of dancing he said they're interested in those things and if you're interested in God and God is your number one interest and if you've ever been in an atmosphere I'm addicted to it I'm gonna be honest here I love the Holy Ghost being around me I wish I could be around him all the time and feel him I love feeling the Holy Ghost it's like a peace comes over you and any worry or doubt just when you get in the presence it's like ah but you see what the Pentecostals did your prophet said he said what they did which was wrong he said he said they blew all the steam out the whistle they turned it into just an emotional affair he said but if they would have put it to work it would have done great things he said but that's why I'm here with the Pentecostals oh if there's only some more Pentecostals you know by experience who might want God like that but notice it says he says now we have all powers in Heaven's on earth he says now we have it not in the Millenium we won't need it we got it now he said right now we are the sons of God he says what you are here or no he says it does not appear what we shall be but we know we'll be like him so we have all powers in heavens and earth right now now we are the sons of God he says what you are here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else remember your prophet said that he said he said start we is working with the theophany and he said he said if your evil hear that is what you are there he said but if you look like God he said it shows that you have a body waiting under so notice those who recall he justifies is that right those who justified his glorified already in the presence of the father we have a glorified body wasn't that deep I love his movies like that but that was - he said all right we'll find out whether it's right or not if there's earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting is that right that's right so right now and what we are here is a reflection here what we are here is a reflection of what we are somewhere else so if your deeds are evil I guess it would read it you know where it comes from you know where your other body's awaiting mmm so what do you look like over there well what's that doing over there see that's in a whole different time dimension for the sister a day is a thousand years and a thousand years as a day what's that like that's when we come into the complexities of the Lamb taking the book remember in the in the seals and your prophet brought it down and remember he almost went over and he said well answer he said that's not the bride in Revelations five and then what the Holy Ghost corrected him and said that is the bride well how are we going to work with us all the dimensions I don't know I ain't worried about it I'm just worried about getting the heavenly one right here how did you yeah Philippians 3:20 close pretty quick here he says flip is controlling who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorified body boy's body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself so notice he compares the change of your vile body that you're living in right now that what it's that it may be fashioned like his goof like unto his glorious body well how's he gonna do it the same power that he's exercising right now to subdue all things unto himself he is all-powerful at this moment and his whole plan realized and we said that this morning that not one thing is surprising God right now everything is happening just like he ordained it to happen your condition right now is just how he ordained it to happen your response to the word is what is ordained of God God seen that you were gonna do it it's gonna be alright yours bod yours body man it's going to finish right but we have to stick it out sometimes we got to dig in and find a little bit we're not sitting in this lazy boy predestination we believe they are but cry out God raised our faith they met little bit further we're gonna close 54 103 question answers he says just think the very Lord Jesus that was back there in the days of the Apostles is here now and it's just whining up the end of the Gentiles a great move is going amongst the supernatural believers because we believe that God is here wait a minute why is that great supernatural move among the believers because they believe that God is here what if Jesus Christ appeared right before you right here what would that do to you would you be sitting here like this we'd be sitting here like this it struck me as inspiration at home they sung that song I can only imagine what it will be like have heard that song right now but anyway he said the song goes what will we do in your presence what we're saying when we dance what are we gonna do in your presence and that's what's gonna be likely that when I'm in heaven rather imagine what's gonna be like in heaven cuz we're heavenly places right now that's why your promise said what you are here is what you will be over there if you love God here you're gonna act like you love God here if these are first up here you're gonna act like he's your first love here and then God is the primary object of worship for our hands for miles for our body for a fee for everything we are God is desiring to get the ultimate expression of worship from our bodies and I say Amen so look at this he says the supernatural move is here because we believe God is here huh that's all it takes just think you're glorified bodies right here at the Tabernacle now the present of the Holy Spirit which is your glorified condition see you're a part of him see it's all polling from what he is it can't be outside of him look at this your glorified in Christ right now this is your lovers those who he justified he glorified and your own glorified body is standing near you right now in Christ Jesus to give to you a strength like a charge going into a battery I thought we see a couple batteries charging you see the Holy Ghost was such a reality to this prophet that he said he's right here he likened it is the same essence of your glorified body he says right here and sister wedding knowing that the Holy Ghost is not not just in her but near her she's feel a little tired she said Lord I mean do we believe this or not is this some fictitious story so we got to come to a place that we believe this and by faith we activated and he likened that to your own glorified body the Holy Spirit be near you and he said it charges you like a battery he said the Holy Spirit's in you it's the charge your body to give you new strength to heal you from sickness sickness that you've got and to make you with but notice this is the problem right here God is here whether you can feel him or not he's here Millia prophesied he said the Holy Spirit is more real in this room than you and I are he said we are just a shadow here I'll watch it on YouTube aren't they oh so you see what it is whatever your need is you don't have to wonder I wonder if I can have that today well you have to believe you have to believe I was just telling I just preached it on Wednesday maybe it's Wednesday before there but brother Branham told him in perfect faith he said there's only one thing left to this generation he said and that's just to belief one thing left what is it to believe I believe it because what if you're low on strength the new strengths right next year you got to believe it I didn't tell you say all day long I can read this quote all day long but you have got to believe it you got to believe you're a child of God you've got to believe he loves you and you love him and what how could he stay away from you you are his bar one more after this Ephesians 3:20 he said now under him oh Jesus three again here we go it says now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think there's not one thing that you can think of that God cannot do it can't go above what his abilities are you can't even ask it you can't think it but if you ask it out of his will ain't gonna happen so I'm saying if God puts you in front of the water hole and you need to walk across you just do what he tells you to do according to the power oh boy oh boy he handlers under him let's read the whole thing under him that is able to do exceedingly abundant above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us you see that's why he can charge you like a battery that's why all things are possible that's what Christ told them why does the power that's working in you is greater than anything you could ask or think mature church and I'll tell you what if you got a revelation of that you'll live 3:21 out to you it says under him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages whoa without end amen close right here ever-present water from the rock he says when we die our souls will go under the altar of God where else privileged to see a few morning's ago as you know in the vision where the Bible speaks of our spirits we'll go to God who give it our bodies shall return to the dust of the earth but Sumner where the scripture is fulfilled our spirits will be released from God we'll pick up the soul and the soul to the body and the power that'll raise us up is right in us now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't or loyalty that sons and daughters of God would create them a world out here and don't live a private life on it and the church says Amen God knows you probably thought it 15 times - I'm honest you ha you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you a shadow of it to create another world go live a private life a little bit of shadow he said you got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a lot of the new existence and go live on a hallelujah there your that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments oh I wonder what's happened in the message it's a law of faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is your every place the soles of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law faith that opens it to you you see what I mean that that power is controlled by if you are a son or God or a you are a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there let Stan I appreciate your attentiveness the design the idea I feel like it's the Lord it's brought these things to me but how can we as believers in the true Word of God come to a place that we can show the world a living Jesus Christ these signs shall follow them that believe we will preach the gospel to every creature but God let it be spirit and truth be there I'll tell you about the system a lot of my motivation that's rolling by and I was telling this to them earlier is a brother showed me a he showed me a video I didn't watch all of it I watched some of it on YouTube but it's all about these modern musicians or magicians like David Blaine and Criss Angel and these guys are just openly working in in satanic Satanism and witchcraft and they're walking on water they're walking up walls they're doing all these things turning water into wine you can watch it you don't have to cuz they're just a bunch of impersonators but it comes right back to what brother Branham talked about the Messiah message he said he said how come that man with that mental perverted demon spirit on him can look at that glass and focus on it by telepathy and make it pop he said he said if he could get change into a new creature he said he'd resurrect the dead I don't want a mental faith I don't want no half God I don't want no okay oh look at what God did with William Branham I thank God for that but the movies on the bride and what really it just got the fire of righteous zeal rolling in me one of those magicians they said they said Jesus Christ they said see they said Jesus Christ wasn't nothing but a magician I said here we are anointed ones at the endtime Jannes and Jambres is coming out where there's a bogus dollar bill there's got to be a real and I'll tell you I cried at that altar and I said God how can we under emphasize who you are to this generation how can I sit here and say I believe in something and the fullness of what it is isn't there I'm crying out for I'm asking God for it I'm crying to get out of this layer to see it is is atmosphere and I want to go higher think about it there's enough power on the inside of you right now you could create a world gonna fire what should be in our churches right now what should be in our expectation you see somebody has to take the challenge of this word and be inspired and say God I'll pray more I'll do what I can but only God help me don't push me through a pipe but God draw me Lord let me see what you have for me open my eyes to this reveal we're like we read this morning God once men and women to be Messiah adds it's a body work we got to take it we're either gonna say okay I'll wait for next year go say okay God let's start me Rayette God wants heavenly places right here we think is going to transform this church my church at home up there for the brownies but what's going to transform all these places as many places God bring your maturity inside of me God that's what I look for God that's why I long see these quotes they'll just stir you right up but I don't want to just feel good from a quote I want my Lord and Savior - woo on me with love never be satisfied without him you love God let me say God I need more of you and I want that God Lord I see all that Lord I realize that is what you ordained me to do the prophets said this is for the church just with that simple defying of gravity maybe we could just take a little granite he sees the thoughts and says your hearts right now let's pray our most beloved Lord Jesus Christ how he comes all humbly before you know we love you we thank you for your where we thank you Lord for what you've sown in this age and God is you know it's just been a real stir to me Lord as we see Oh God the mockers of your life Oh God Allah impersonations Oh God of what Christianity is we know we're sitting here in this church tonight because we know that this message is the true representation of you of your life God we're asking tonight Oh God the Lord you would help us to mature in the world help us oh God to let all the bitterness off all the question marks all the unbelief let it go God and just help us to believe Oh help our unbelief Lord and the Lord as we begin the yield and let you control us no we ask oh god you just bring heavenly places let us be in a place oh God but we're gonna spoil you down from heaven that you might just dwell in our midst and do what you said you would do Oh God through this message and this Bible Lord and Lord we don't want anybody to miss that God set up fire blaze in our lives that we might get those last elected seed out Lord and then we might know God we pray tonight you we pray the lord of the harvest god it's send laborers in your harvest and god anoint us as believers gone to sow in tears to reap in joy and to bring in those precious sheaves Lord we just love

love you we're doing the best we can and we ask Oh God you don't know Anacin in a way ho God we'd be able to love you better we have forgive us for our wrongs or our complacency the distractions we've
