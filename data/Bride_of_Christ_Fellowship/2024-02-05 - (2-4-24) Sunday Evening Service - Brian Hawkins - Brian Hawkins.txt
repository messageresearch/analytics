before you just taking our time out of our day uh that we set aside to to come and and just to come into a worship service to to hear your word to sing praise and to get refilled and to shrug off the things of the world whatever is weighing us down this is a place that we could just come and find peace find rest from all the things that we battle from day to day Lord where we could bring our pressures and and we could just get relieved from that at least for a temporary amount of time and we just thank you for these times that we can come and and uh just look forward to coming to a church service that we can uh have a good time in the Lord even though the world they think it they might think that it's boring they might think that it's that there's nothing to it but Lord it means the world to us it means a lot to to be able to come and and sit in this presence and and I just appreciate that so much oh God and again as we read into the scriptures as we read your word tonight father we just pray that you would just uh bless your people tonight help me to uh bring out what you what you would want Lord Lord we want to give you the glory we want to give you the honor we want to give you the praise in all things father we pray that one more time that you would touch little Zion that you would touch him in his body Lord as they tell me that he wasn't feeling good that he wasn't able to keep food down lord we just pray that you would be with that little one just touch him in his body that he can uh be able to eat something tonight Lord and we thank you for work already done

just touch them today oh Lord that they would get better and better that they would give you praise oh God we thank you in all things in Jesus Christ's name we do pray amen and amen amen welcome to service one more time and uh if you would uh I that's kind of been of the the song that we've really enjoyed uh singing around our house lately is is uh gratitude do you know there's a lot of people that walk through and they're not grateful for a whole lot know but we're a people that we know we've been brought from we've been uh called from a life of sin unto a life of righteousness the things that we used to do we do them no more am so we have a lot to be grateful for we could be sitting in a in a hospital bed with whatever we could be in a crack house we could be in a bar we could be anywhere other than here but we just want to thank the Lord that we are are privileged people to be here this evening and where is here akan Ohio no not aan Ohio but in the presence of the Lord amen amen and you know with worship and praise and singing songs to him and giving him honor you're in the presence of the Lord because when we were talking this morning about demonology when you talk about demons when you talk about Witchcraft and that's like the whole conversation of it when you're talking about evil spirits you're inviting that's why I don't like talking about the subject because you are inviting those spirits but when you talk about God you are inviting the presence of God Amen so what do we want our conversation to be about God Amen and about all the good things if there's anything oh I can't even think of the scripture now I'm I'm terrible with this stuff I I don't have that great memory but all things that are uh pure all things that are holy uh and and you know what scripture I'm talking about but meditate upon these things all uh those that those things that are good those things that are holy those are the things that we want to fill our mind with amen uh so if you would turn with me to uh Second Timothy Chapter 2 and I apologize to my family but they're going to hear this again because we just spoke on this last last week but uh I I pray that it's a blessing to you I I I like this subject I hope you like it too so second Timothy starting in uh the first verse it says Thou therefore excuse me uh we'll turn to 1 Timothy 1 and18 uh after so first verse it says Thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou Hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier and in 1 Timothy uh 1:8 18 it says this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest War a good Warfare holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made a shipwreck so in verse 18 it says this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest War a good Warfare or you could say you may strongly engage in battle and verse 19 holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made a shipwreck for some have rejected these and they have suffered shipwreck of their faith this is what we're facing in this day you may be seated uh this is what we're facing and and also in this day is we're we're enduring we're we're faced with so many struggles we're faced with with an adversary which is a worthy adversary right because he's he's not some like we were talking this morning you're not going to be able to uh uh deceive the the adversary because he already knows so you can't you can't Bluff him you either have the Holy Spirit or you don't you know you've either got the goods or you don't have the goods right and he's going to know if you have the goods or not because uh uh taking the New Testament when they were trying to uh cast out devils and and the evil spirits were saying Paul I know Jesus I know but who are you so you're not going to be able to Bluff the enemy even though this is our Warfare so it behooves us to know what our enemy is and what enemy that we're we're fighting what we're engaged with and not giving into the enemy but overcoming the enemy amen so this this is we're we're we're pretty much going through these same type of of of things things that uh Timothy was talking about the book of Timothy Paul was telling Timothy to be prepared because you're going to have to fight you're going to have to engage in a mighty battle it's not just a a small little uh uh uh playground little fight little spat but this is a life and death battle amen spiritually spiritual versus carnal it is it it's a it's a battle that we are engaged in and what I like to speak on today is weapons of our Warfare worship worship is my weapon amen amen praise the Lord so if you would turn with me to John chapter 4 and I'm just going to read through some things and just kind of lay a foundation a little bit here and and by God's grace we'll get into something good if it's a word it's always good right so John chapter 4 and verse 21 we all like to worship right so Jesus saith unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews see he's telling this woman that you know the Samaritans and you know she has the expectation she she was looking for a messiah but they went through service through service through service but yet they didn't really know what they were worshiping but here Jesus is coming saying we know what we worship because we're it's of the Jews right we know the God we know the father of what we're worshiping because this is what we grew up on this is what we grew up knowing right so and we want to teach others as as well so ye worship you know not what how great it is is and what a privilege it is that we know what we worship amen we know the reason why we worship it's not just to hear the sound of our voice but is to give God praise amen amen to tell him that we love him to tell him to to have that sweet communion with our Lord amen so uh you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers how many true worshippers do we have but when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him see he's looking for that kind of a person he's looking for that kind of a Believer to worship him not worshiping something else but to worship him he's looking through the Earth who's going to worship me Amen in verse 24 it says God is a spirit we know that right God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth oh my in Luke Chapter 4:8 Jesus Is Telling Satan here because Satan's trying to tempt him trying to get him you know if if you if you accept all these things I I'll give you all these things only if you just Bow Down and Worship me that was only that was just a small price uh just give up on your beliefs just a little bit just give in a little bit just so you can get this one small pleasure this one small thing that you've been Desiring forget everything that you've lived for for the past however many years that you've been a Believer just give in that one little bit but Jesus says get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God in him only in him only shalt thou serve Ser so what is worship worship is a the reverent love and Devotion accorded to a deity an idol or a sacred object whether you've got a a totem pole or some some staff or some uh whatever it is craft that that people make out of a rock or piece of wood uh whatever it is that's what they worship because they have some kind of a a love and feel a feeling of devotion toward that item that's what they worship right some people have sports that they worship some people have uh other things uh movies movie stars celebrities these are also known as Idols because uh that's what people worship see then then you have uh uh the ceremonies of prayers or other religious forms by which uh this love is expressed which is what what we're doing here we are expressing our love unto our Lord in the form of worship in a form of religious worship uh it's also an Ardent admiration or love an adoration such as the worship of celebrities uh it also means as in a verb sense it means to honor and to love as a deity to feel an adoring reverence or adoring esteem or devotion to bow or give obeisance to uh to fall prostrate in reverence or Adoration of a deity person or thing so when we fall prostrate what does prostrate mean it means that we fall on our face we give ourselves over unto the Lord we put our face to the Earth from when from where we came from we show no Pride but we show humility to show that he is greater than us right and that's what worship is it's it's showing an admiration for some something that we feel is greater than us I'm sorry but celebrities are not greater than my Lord celebrities are not greater than I am they're just a person just just like I am and to me even if Chuck Norris walked into the door I would greet him just like I would anybody else hey I've seen a few of your movies you know Years Years Gone past or whatever hey it's nice to meet you but I'm not going to fall down and and worship him just because he's a celebrity yeah he's probably got millions of dollars so be it good for him right so I'm not going to be envious of him you know he's just a person just like I am right uh so we don't give uh that kind of an adoration to a man but we save that adoration for our husband for our Lord so praise as opposed to worship it it's synonymous I I don't want to say as as opposed to to worship but it is synonymous but praise differs uh from worship that worship is an action and praise is words right so when you give children praise you're saying good job or somebody at work you know hey good job uh something like that hey that was a great idea you know we were really successful from that you know that's giving somebody praise uh so praise is an offering of of words of hom homage as an act of worship such as when we sing uh songs of praise uh and in Psalms 22 starting in the third verse it says but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabit us the Praises of Israel you know we we uh if if you look I looked this up a little while back and and people were saying well that's not what the scripture means that's not uh it means something completely different you won't find because people that's one thing that we say a lot is uh the Lord inhabits the Praises of his people and there're why you can't find that in scripture well this is pretty much what it where it is but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabit us the Praises of Israel see God inhabits the praise of his people see when we give him praise when we talk about him when we have conversation with him he's we're showing him that he's important in our lives amen and then and in verse four that it says our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou did deliver them they Cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded see the fathers they trusted in the Lord they Cried unto him and they trusted him and they gave him worship so Hebrews 13- 15 it says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name see it says to give it uh to to give the sacrifice of of praise to God continually it's a continual thank you Lord Praise Your Name Lord hallelujah which is which is known to be the highest highest form of Praise right giving God a hallelujah hallelujah is is is is like the highest form right I don't know what else we could say but in men's words and men's terms that's all we know that's that's that's like the best thing that we could give him even though he's worthy of having more something better that's all we can comprehend to give him we know worship is a weapon okay well we're we're getting there but you'll find out worship is a weapon but you know what our greatest weapon is as a Believer prayer prayer is our great greatest weapon Right add the season of worship and the season of praise and faith is our Victory amen so so what is a weapon if we're going to worship and use it as a weapon what is a weapon so a weapon is an instrument of attack or defense and combat as a gun missile or sword or nunchuck staff whatever it is whatever you're used to uh whatever you could use as a weapon right and I I gave this illustration last week you know even if you think that you're the simple as a Christian and you think that you can't get anything oh I'm just a little believer I only have a little bit of understanding but you know a little bit of understanding goes a long way because uh and like us I was telling everybody last week you know I tried to go into the Social Security office this was a few years ago and I had a multi-tool on me you know which is pliers a screwdriver yeah it's got a knife blade on it and you know different things like that but he said whoa whoa whoa you can't go into the Social Security office with that you know that's a weapon like what do you mean to me that's a tool see and a and a knife to me is a tool I've never used a knife as a weapon I don't know if anybody else has used a knife as a weapon I have never used a knife as a weapon I've always used a knife as a tool right so I guess it's all on the perception of the the possibility of what could be of what could happen you know they go to Great Lengths to figure uh the worst case scenario right so if you have a knife yep you could you could hurt somebody but if I carry a straw from sweet tea from Wendy's I can't I can't help but think of brother Diggs uh every time I think about a straw and I talk about it sweet tea from Wendy's but everybody would think that a straw would be so innocent right would theyd probably let me have a whole shirt pocket full of straws and a straw could be very dangerous and you're probably think how in the world is a straw going to be dangerous well take a if you get a potato you hold the potato you take a straw you wouldn't think that a straw would go through it but it's strong enough to go through it and the things that you could do with a straw to somebody you could use a pen or a pencil or something else like that you give me something I'll use it as a weapon car keys whatever it is a spoon I don't care you'd be able to use something as a weapon what about a couch pillow don't go so far okay I combat sleep with a couch pillow I'll Attack it hard no but you you get the point that even even with even the weakest of Christians can can shake hell even just a an innocent looking straw can cause havoc on on a person now I'm not trying to I'm not trying to uh say go use weapons against people that's not what I'm saying because a weapon is used for offense and defense right so so zoology uh as a weapon can you think of uh different animals that that have weapons or on on on their bodies uh it's a a part or an organ such as a claw or a stinger used by an animal and attack or defense and we we read through the scripture that Satan was disarmed because the last thing to defeat was death oh death where is thy sting and oh grave where is thy Victory see he was he was rent harmless because now he is uh he has no weapon to use against us amen because that weapon his greatest weapon has been defeated on Calvary amen so you also have uh a weapon a means used to defend against or defeat another talking about logic logic was used as a weapon but what're we're talking here this this afternoon about uh worship being our weapon bear with me a few more minutes okay uh and then and then we'll get into uh something here uh 2 Corinthians chap 10: 3-6 should be very familiar scripture to every Bible reader excuse me getting ready to turn 49 still learning how to drink sorry wrong tube adversar is trying to use a bottle of water against me verse three it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds or Solomon would put it wisdom is better than weapons of war wisdom is better than weapons of war verse five he says casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself to exalt means to glorify praise and honor casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ every thought that goes through your mind you can't help the kind of thoughts that come into your mind but you can help them get out if they don't belong you can say get out of here you can't help the the thoughts that come into your mind but you can keep it from building a nest right so we want to cast down those imaginations or anything that exalts itself higher than God verse six and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled how many people want revenge how do you go to get get revenge you're going to take some weapon and sneak into somebody's house who did you wrong and and take care of him no we're not going to do that way right because the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of stronghold so if we have that sense of Revenge be obedient to God because he said vengeance is mine right so if we give it over to him the battle's not ours if we give it to him he will Revenge he will avenge us of all of our enemies amen so if you're wanting to have Revenge don't have malice about it have love about it and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled and in second Peter chapter 1 verse5 it says and beside this giving all diligence to add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and not just sitting in there dormant but if these things be in you and abound putting these things into practice to where these things abound in your life for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lackthe things is blind and cannot see a far off and ha forgotten that he was purged from his old sins but we remember that we were purged amen we don't we're not we have no lacking of that because we remember what the Lord has done for us amen so verse 10 it says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall your obedience is fulfilled when you have patience or when you have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness up to charity and we wonder what well how could I be more obedient to God through these things if we have these things and they abound in our lives we shall never fall we shall suffer through every Temptation that will come our way we shall suffer through or we shall be Victorious through every trial every tribulation because our God goes and fights for us amen when we entrust him with it all amen and and one more here uh well there's there's more but uh and then we'll get into the other stuff so Ephesians uh chapter 6 verse 10 how many was thinking this when we started this scripture you can't go without talking about this we talked about the offensive weapon now we're going to talk a little bit about the the defensive weapon so finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil and there are a lot of tricks that he tries to pull on us right in verse 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood no matter how much you like you uh uh MMA you know how much of those things but we wrestle not against flesh and blood that is not our Warfare in this day not to say that we can't defend ourselves our homes our loved ones our our Goods that we have right but our major war that we are uh going to engage in a mighty battle it's through it's it's through the spirituality spiritual versus carnal for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places we were talking this morning about how how the the kings of the Nations and how the the merchants were were so corrupt because they they they uh dined with it they they were part of it a part of the corruption and that's what we're fighting against is the corruption whether no matter where it is but you uh everywhere you look there there's corruption just about everywhere in churches in a place of of work hopefully not in this church I don't think it's in this church but you understand what I mean and uh in some Churches there's just corruption because they're so political and they want to keep the word of God from the people well just come and sing songs of worship and that'll be good that'll be it not hearing the word of God what kind of worship service is that you're worshiping something else yeah it might sound good singing singing gospel songs but that's not going to save you Clapping Your Hands to a gospel tune isn't going to save you playing a guitar playing a piano playing drums to a gospel song isn't going to save you praise the Lord verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand and we are in a wicked and adulterous generation are we not so stand therefore having your Lo your loins GED about with truth don't compromise on Truth for those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so we can't compromise there having your loins GED about with the truth having on the breastplate of righteousness protecting your heart protecting your vital organs so you maintain vitality and your feet shod with the preparation of the of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen because you're going to get buffeted and then after you're buffeted guess what you're going to be buffeted again and then after that second buffeting what's going to happen you're going to get buffeted again it's an endless cycle it seems until the day that we go home but that's just what we're ordained to that's just the way it's going to be so we must stand strong as a good soldier of Jesus Christ amen verse 17 it says and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God the helmet of salvation protecting yourself from from uh keeping yourself from mind battles because a lot of our mind battles happen because the the uh our eyes are the gate to our soul when we look at things we see things happening things come in and then you have mind battles right so you have to uh watch and protect what not only what we're taking in through our eyes but what our children are W watching looking at amen so we need to be good examples cuz they're looking at us right children are looking at parents siblings other family members [Music] friends they're looking at all kinds of influences so we must have the hel the helmet of salvation to protect ourselves from those mind battles amen and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the The Mystery of the Gospel see it's not an easy thing sometimes because how many times do you desire that you want to say something somewhere and then you present her with a situation and there's all these people that you uh uh that you there might be several people around that well if I say something uh they might not talk to me anymore they're going to think that I'm weird but see this is where holding the mystery of Faith amen and proclaiming it uh boldly speaking it boldly amen The Mystery of the Gospel not being ashamed not being afraid not being afraid of your convictions but being able to stand boldly with your convictions not compromising for which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak amen we doing okay today okay if you would turn with me to 2 Chronicles chapter 20 starting in the first verse I know everybody's tired especially after eating a meal and then you come to evening service and hurry up you love the Lord amen somebody give God praise 2 Chronicles chapter 20 I said starting in the first verse didn't I I'm not there I've only got a part of it in here might help if the preacher is there sorry bear with me chapter 20 verse 1 it says it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of of Ammon and with them uh other beside the ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle Then There came some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from Beyond the Sea on the side Syria on on this side Syria and behold they be in hazaz on Tamar which is inti and Jehoshaphat feared and set set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah he heard of trouble coming and what did he do he sought God first right he set his mind to seek the Lord and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord they didn't go to some other entity they didn't go to some other de deity they didn't didn't go see Buddha they didn't go see uh Muhammad they didn't go see anything else but they sought the Lord and then the king just didn't keep it to himself he says hey we want we need some help here so I'm proclaiming a fast you know if if the Devils could do it when when somebody's casting out Devils when a minister is casting out Devils or a Believer I should say what happens when when that demon is about to come out it knows that it's going to be defeated it is calling for help to another demon so they can't be defeated so why can't a Believer do the same thing hey I need some help over here amen verse five and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court and said oh Lord God of our fathers art art not thou God in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee kind of reminds me of the Lord's Prayer when we talk to the Lord you give him praise you talk to him you commune with him Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done talking to him it's not about you but you're talking to him you're making it about him right amen and then you go in and ask your supplication verse seven it says art not thou Our God who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gavest it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever verse eight and it says and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein therein for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon on us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our Affliction then thou will hear and help amen so when we when we he's a very an everpresent help in the time of trouble right amen so when we when we see ourselves when we recognize the spirit if a spirit's trying to inhibit us from getting closer to God we call out to the Lord that that shouldn't that that should be like our first response not call not calling the doctor not calling so and so not calling the pastor to see see what I should do about it but we should enter into prayer first thing that we call upon God for his help and then he could talk to somebody else use somebody to help us amen but we must make sure that he is first and this is what they're doing they're setting a great example for us Amen in verse 10 it says and now behold the children of Ammon and Moab and mount s whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold I say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou has given us uh given us to inherit excuse me let's read that again behold I say how they reward us see they've given them peace because the Lord told them leave them alone and now behold I say how they reward us to come and to cast us out of thy possession see a lot of things we want to say well this is mine that's mine but it's the Lord that gave it to you see this is saying trying to uh uh cast us out of thy possession out of God's possession amen that was the first mistake is the enemy is trying to go against God right verse 12 scriptures are going through my mind right now I'm trying to stay focused Uh Oh Our God wil thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee they openly confess I don't understand I I don't know what's going on but I know I can't defeat this enemy so calling out for the mightier than the mightiest amen verse 13 it says and all Judas stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children the whole household not just the father not just the mother but the children also they probably took the dog and the cat and everything in the household amen the whole everybody in the house then upon jesel the son of Zechariah the son of beniah the son of J J the son of maniah a levite of the sons of Asaf came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus sayeth the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dis nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's amen so you shouldn't have anything to worry about let God handle it amen verse 16 tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up uh behold they come up by the Cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Gerel ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves and stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed don't get disheartened just because you're going through a trial yeah it might one of the hardest that you've gone through but be patient for a little bit longer amen fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you amen Verse 18 and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground from when he came amen showing humility putting himself under the Lord and giving showing humility humility unto the Lord showing which one is greater before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of the coites and of the children of the kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high see with a loud voice on high not just a little quiet praise the Lord with a shame afraid to speak praise off our lips right you remember what happened to the walls of Jericho the first day they just walked around it's all they did no sound nobody was supposed to talk second day Third Day fourth day fifth day sixth day this is getting a little old I'm telling you what all these days we're not allowed to say anything we can't do anything and uh man what what's going to happen here I don't see anything happen and this and then just leaving before the before the salvation of the Lord happens you know because we get so impatient and then we feel that the Lord isn't working and then we take things upon ourselves and then we make a mess of it then well how did I get into this situation you weren't patient on God but what happened on the seventh day is in one mind one Accord One Voice one shout the walls of Jericho came falling down amen see that's what can happen when we are unified amen verse 20 it says' and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tooa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall ye be established believe His prophets so shall ye Prosper see the word of the Lord comes to the prophet when the word comes forth you believe amen so he's saying and you believe His prophets what he has spoken unto you have faith in that because I the Lord have spoken through him amen and so shall you prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord and that should and that should praise the beauty of his Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever amen verse 22 and when they began to sing and to praise the Lord s ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and the mount s which were come against Judah and they were smitten see when it's when they begin to sing it's when they begin to praise it's when they begin to worship that's when the Lord went to work and became Victorious amen it wasn't the people that fought the Battle because see when we get into worship the spirit of worship our mind is focused on him it's no longer on our symptoms it's no longer on our problems and then we don't get in the way when we worship we just get ourselves out of the way so God can move and we're not hindering the Lord see when we worship we are setting ourselves aside getting out of his way so if we would just stop and let God move amen I like that and when they began to sing and to praise the Lord s ambushments uh that's when the battle began amen verse 23 for the children of Ammon excuse me at 23 did I say 33 verse 23 for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount s utterly to slay and and Destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of s Everyone helped to destroy another see it shouldn't be that way in the Church of God a bunch Believers backbiting going against one another because this this is what happens this is what happens as you destroy one another see that's what the Lord did is he he put these these people at variance the the armies they put them at variance against against one another so they were fighting and and and and backbiting against one another and that's what took them down see A house divided against itself will bring itself down amen because they they wanted to call Jesus be elab right but there's one greater than be above verse 24 and when Judah came toward the Watchtower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies Fallen to the Earth and none escaped verse 25 and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much I'm not talking about a Prosperity theology but when we give ourselves when we step aside and let the Lord have his way of how much he gives us a blessing he won't give you more more troubles more Temptations than what you can handle but he'll sure sure give you blessings more than what you can handle amen to where blessings will be overflowing three days in gathering the spoil amen that there was so much verse 26 and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Baraka for there they blessed the Lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of Baraka which means blessing unto this day excuse me uh verse 27 then they returned every every man of Judah and Jerusalem and Jehoshaphat in the Forefront of them uh to go go again to Jerusalem with joy for the Lord had made them to Rejoice over their enemies and they came to Jerusalem with the suies and harps and trumpets unto the house of the Lord I'm sure there were some dancing going on because they had some victory amen they had the liberty of the of the spirit they had no more enemies to come against them they were free they didn't have anything else binding them amen they confess their sins they confess their faults so what else did they have nothing was there to bring them down and by golly they were singing praises unto God Amen see worship is a weapon when we set our minds to Worship the Lord goes and fights a battle for us amen that is our weapon praise the Lord but that's just pretty awesome right there through that whole story that the Lord just blessed them he said if you'll just let me do the work you just start singing you just start worshiping me I'll take care of the rest and then the blessings came to overflowing amen it's not a charismatic thing it's not a Pentecostal thing it's not a Baptist thing it's not a it's not a denominational thing whatever title people want to put on it it's not that kind of a thing amen it's a Bible thing it's a promise thing it's what the Lord has told us what he would do for us say I will worship him no matter what right I don't want to think of the worst scenario I don't want to go through that but I pray that I would stay right on with him amen just like job if if he took took everything from me like he did job I pray that I would just uh stay with him and not compromise on my faith just because the the riches that we have doesn't mean it's a blessing of God right uh whether we're rich or whether we're poor it doesn't mean that God is mad at you or happy with you right but what does please him oby obedience because Rebellion is as witchcraft right and we don't want to be a rebellious bride we don't want to be rebellious children but we want to be in his will we want to let him have his way right but there is a false worship like we spoke this morning Whenever there is a genuine there's going to be a a copycat so there was a false uh there is uh false worship which you know people that just come to church and well I did my duty on Sunday and won't show up wedes day they come one service a week H that's all I need to do is is go to service once a week you know any more than that that's just too much uh it it it'll become a common thing well if it becomes a common thing then something is wrong something is wrong let's say the the great enemies of our church of the church are the Heretics who will not wear the Yoke of obedience right the uh like it said in the scripture about the the Pharisees and the Sadducees where uh they would make broad the filteries and make doctrines of men and try and expect uh uh men to be obedient unto those things which it would be fine if you were if if it it there's nothing that says you can't go above and beyond what the word says to do right but don't go beneath the minimum standard so if there's anything extra sure why not but the problem came where it became a tradition to men and then uh they were expecting men to follow it when they wouldn't follow it themselves right that's where it comes to be a problem so it's the Heretics who won't wear the Yoke of true obedience see these are the ones that had the mark of the beast and will worship the Beast under the cloak of a believer of Christ but they have engrossed in idol worship Revelation 14-11 it says and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast in His image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name see we believe that Jesus Christ is our rest right the Sabbath day means rest and he is our Sabbath he is our rest but these people that worship the Beast those that give over they give themselves over unto the Beast they have no rest night or day so praise God that we have rest in this day amen so if you ever wonder well what could I be thankful for you could be thankful for rest night and day that you have a peace you ever see that I think it's a bumper sticker uh no Jesus uh no peace and o no Jesus if if you eliminate Jesus you have no peace but then it says no Jesus k n o w the knowledge of Jesus you know who Jesus is then you get to know you have knowledge of Peace you understand what peace is right so no Jesus no peace or no Jesus and know peace and have peace amen but see uh we we know the story when Jesus was born with uh uh King Herod when the wi wise men came to Herod and they said hey we saw the star in the east and we have come to worship him right so and they're explaining the whole thing of everything that was spoken of of Jesus to happen they said all these things are fulfilled here so we're here to worship uh we're here to worship the King right so and what did haris he got jealous he got envious what what do you mean another king I'm the only King people should be worshiping right uh the natural King I'm the highest in the land give me give me the props give give me the praise see that's that's what men uh typically want as they they try to steal praise from God just like King Nebuchadnezzar when he said did I not build this Kingdom myself not giving the Lord recognition for blessing him in his in his kingship right so what did Herod say to the to the wise men he said hey let me know where he is so that I may worship him too with something with a whole different agenda so I pray that none of us come to church with a different agenda other than you know wanting to come and worship and get something out of the Lord don't come we're not here to see what brother sisters wearing what kind of shoes they've got on their feet even though you got pretty nice shoes they're probably real comfortable but that's not why I came to church today to see what kind of we see what kind of sneakers you're wearing or kicks of what we used to call to see what kind of kicks you're sport we don't come for those things right right cuz if you came to see what kind of hairstyle I got you came for the wrong reason sorry you're sad going to be sadly disappointed right so we have we have those people that have false Worship in this day they come for the wrong reason and then you have those that come and worship and they don't know what they're worshiping amen see remember God is a jealous God he's not envious you know when when the scripture says you know God himself says that I a a jealous God people want to sayoh how can a how can a sinless God have this the the sinful nature of being jealous that's not what that means that that part of that's a whole another uh sermon by the way that's a whole another message is uh jealousy of God being a jealous God it means that he's zealous for you and he doesn't want to lose you so he's going to fight for you amen because you are his possession just like the levite we are his his portion he is our portion but we belong to him and and he'll not lose a one everyone that the father gave unto Jesus he will not lose one of them amen so but he is zealous for us and he doesn't share his glory with anybody else he doesn't want he doesn't want you to worship anything else he doesn't want you to worship anyone else but he wants to worship and he wants that all to himself right he doesn't share his glory with anybody he doesn't want us to worship football Stars basketball Stars whatever it is politicians musicians actors but you get the point he wants your worship he wants your worship he wants communion with you amen he doesn't want us to worship our problems we say my problem I don't worship my problems well you seem to give more attention to your problem than you do to God so if you're so focused on your problem and not talking to God about it then you're worshiping your problem oh I've got this issue I've got this isue and then everybody you see on the street oh hey got uh well was me I got this problem I got this problem I got that problem oh you can get over it you know through the power of the Lord you know we try to encourage people through the power of Christ you you oh yeah I believe that and then you tell oh I got this problem I got this problem how about confessing healing we were talking this this morning about having a vision of a well person and stepping into that that Vision part of that is positive speaking not talking about the problem but saying praise God I've got the victory what was that uh John Ryan I want to say he was he was blind and he went up for prayer and uh brother Brandon told him he says uh you're healed and then he went and then he couldn't see and then he went back to brother Brandon said hey you told me I was healed I'm still blind he says well you go you said you you said you believed right if you said you believe then you go confessing when you come up for prayer when you pray onto God you go confessing that you've received that thing no matter what comes no matter what goes no matter what your neighbor says well I still see you got those little bumps there I see you're not healed yet it doesn't matter what somebody else says it's got to be that Revelation to you and you say thank you Lord for the healing already I believe I'm going to have it I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe if you say you have faith and then you don't show forth and you don't have a a confession of Faith then you don't have faith if you're always worshiping your problem oh I'm down in the dumps this is happening that's happening this is happening and sometimes I get into that R I'll be honest with you and you probably do too you know because things just seem not to go right for me all the time anybody else ever get tired of that man would you just leave me alone give me 10 minutes of rest would you just stop it you know you trip over your feet or something's in the way or this doesn't happen this breaks in your hands when you're just trying to put it you understand what I mean it's everyday life things just happen you know but we're not going to be focused on those things we're going to focus on the one that gives salvation amen see we give them we give our problems over to the problem solver the dissolver of Doubt amen well see when you cling to your problems you're just showing that you that you like that evil spirit being in there that you're petting that evil spirit and you're and you're living it's something that you want to keep there and if you keep it there you're going to be in the same condition and that devil has every right to have Mastery over you amen but it's until you're willing to give that up and give it over unto God that's when you get the freedom amen I was just talking about it last week I I I had this thought of of of of a message about the page folders anybody read a book uh they read books and then if you see some book readers they they fold the pages over I like that spot or you're either marking the spot that's where it left off or you're marking the spot oh man I really like that part of the story I want to go back to that see sometimes I think people Harbor that in their lives and uh their page folders because they want to go back to that so you're you're supposed to forsake all those things because you've deliver you've been delivered from it so we're not going to return to that anymore the only thing that you return to it for us say the Lord delivered me from that yes that's what we want to remember we don't want to go back and and give entertainment back to that same old evil spirit because when a when a man sorry this is uh uh when a man is delivered from an evil spirit it's swept and garnished what should we do fill it with righteousness fill it with the things of God because if not he'll come back with seven other Devils worse than he was so therefore we got to uh fill that void with righteousness with things of God Amen see worship it kills the Enemy Inside of us right that's our our our greatest uh enemy is ourselves uh when we give God praise we no longer focus on our symptoms our problems or our trials we are so focused on him that everything everything else Fades out when we give praise when we give God praise we step aside worship kills the enemy in front of us just as we read in the story in 2 uh Chronicles uh chapter 20 of how when they started singing they started giving God worship and the Lord went and fought the Battle for them and defeated the enemy for them they didn't even have to fight all they had to do was stand still and watch the salvation of the Lord because they were giving God praise using worship as a weapon amen worship kills the enemy that binds us and everybody's familiar with the story of Paul and Silas acts 16 and verse 22 I probably won't be very much longer just a few more minutes bear with me okay are we doing okay praise God acts 16 and 22 it says and the multitude rose up together against them and and the magistrates ran off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them safely see that might happen sometime in the in in this in our near future is that they're coming against Christianity so hard and it it's it's just in the starting stages here in the States but it's in other countries where pastors uh ministers are being beaten Believers not just not just pastors uh and min ministers uh but just Believers in general are are are being beaten and killed in other countries and then we we think that we have it hard we don't have it hard we have it pretty easy yet I I think what we deal with mostly are are are mind battles you know or or our friends we're just ashamed to say that we love the Lord Jesus for some reason or another if we're ashamed to say that we love the Lord Jesus to to what we call our friends our co-workers or something I wonder if we really do love the Lord Jesus because I'm not ashamed to tell people that I love my wife and if I'm not ashamed to tell them that I love my wife dearly then I shouldn't be ashamed to tell them that I love my Lord Jesus more than I love my wife amen and I don't well yeah that's where I was going with that is that we're going to be uh I don't know if it'll be uh in my lifetime I might be off this Earth by the time that that starts happening but uh it it's going to start happening where they're going to shut the doors of churches and they're probably going to start jailing us because we we have Services which they were trying to do during Co they were trying to arrest people oh you can't have Services why is it that they were just trying to shut churches down I have an idea because evil doesn't like good right evil is trying to eliminate good so uh verse 24 who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stalks and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed and The Keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here so if y'all understand that scripture which uh uh I'm sure B Jesse's has has talked about it before uh this Jailer if if any of those inmates if any of those prisoners would have escaped then that man would have been killed because he is responsible for them so uh not that it's a great Revelation but I don't know maybe somebody didn't know that uh which it's self-explanatory in that but uh that's neither here nor there but the point is is Paul and Silas were in shackles they were beaten their clothes stripped put in shackles but yet they still maintain praise for God they still gave God gave God the praise amen the mus if the musicians want to come no that wasn't T but without him we are powerless right and we love to read that scripture that no weapon formed against the shall prosper and our enemies shall fall by our side talking about 10,000 right but we won't overcome anything without him because in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word is God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us and through that and through the death on Calvary but through the raising up through the grave he has given us the same power amen but wisdom let me try to find that because I uh Solomon said something uh I can't remember what it is now for some when I'm in front of people I can't remember hardly anything oh believe it or not I don't like talking in front of people uh wisdom is better than weapons of war so Proverbs 16-32 it says he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty see people want to look under the strong people oh look at look at his muscles look how strong a man of Valor and all that blah blah blah but he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty see wisdom is better than weapons of war and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh the city so if you could rule your spirit no matter how little you think you are you're mightier you're better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh the City amen see we worship through your worry we worship through our fears we worship through our stress we worship through our exhaustion we worship uh our our worship breaks down walls worship draws Us near to the father worship reminds of as our reminds us of our reason for living worship puts us in a Heavenly atmosphere amen worship red redirects our Focus what we focus on is what we feel in any given circumstance worship opens the door to peace when You Face an uncertain future amen worship makes the enemy scatter God instructed Jehoshaphat to put the worshippers out in front as they went into battle and to trust God to give the victory amen jehoshaphat's Victory began with worship our Victory will begin with worship Worship Is Our Testimony to the world that Paul and Silas had been beaten Chained and thrown into prison they had that testimony what we go through and what we're delivered from that is our testimony at midnight they worshiped God sent an earthquake Breaking Chains off every prisoner and opening the doors of all those inside the rest of the prisoners stayed because they were eyewitnesses to the suffering of these men who were still praising God second Timothy 4:18 and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom be glory forever and ever amen and one more scripture just bear with me a couple more minutes habac 3:17 it says although the Fig Tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the Stalls sounds pretty gloomy right everything kind of taken away but verse 18 yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will Joy and the god of my salvation so it doesn't matter your circumstance you give God praise you give God worship amen verse 19 the Lord God is my strength and he will make my feet like hindes feet and he will make me to walk upon my high places to the chief singer on my string instruments see I still have a choice see here in h habac saying that showed that this situation was so gloomy there was there were no herds for the Stalls there there no food here there was no food there there was uh no olive oil there was nothing but the choice was still there whatever you do you have a choice in it they could have chose whoo is me and just lay there and die but instead they chose I will still rejoice in the Lord amen you stand your feet with me this evening so you might not have a choice in your suu situation but you have a choice in your reaction you can Sul or you could worship you can be mad at everybody or you could worship you could throw things against the wall or you could worship you can call people names or give them the silent treatment or you could worship you can walk away and give up or you can worship it's your choice on how you respond amen worship the posture of surrender will always bring God into your Serv circumstances this is the very thing that attracts him and as you worship him he fights on your behalf and you get to partake in the victory amen can we sing that uh I worship you I don't know I don't know how many you know I worship you mighty God if anybody needs prayer be happy to pray with you before I forget because I don't like to dismiss and uh without offering prayer to anybody so as we sing songs that give God worship see all that you have a word I Alm Mighty God there is none like [Music] you I give you praise For You are my rightousness might are wor are h
