Lapine's to burst one or we're willing we'll try to get down to about verse seven we're willing today in the morning message by God's grace clip-ins to verse one I'll read the first few verses and then we'll read we'll read verses five six and seven together so let me read one two for myself and then we'll read five six and seven together if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfil ye my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let's read 5 6 & 7 ready one two three let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men let's have a word of Prayer you know in your heart just making known unto Lord let's pray together Heavenly Father we love you we love your word your truth is marching on Lord God and help us Lord to give our lives to make men spiritually free Lord we thank you for Lord this opportunity to be in your house thank you for all the sacrifices I think of the miles Wendy and the Bland's have driven dear God thank you for the great sacrifice father may you just give each person their portion of spiritual food in due season Lord God let it be a word Lord that's needed father for this hour just guide me lead me lead the people fill them God strengthened them Lord God and I just pray God that you'll be magnified and glorified in our bodies through this service as Paul tells us Lord God for father we want to be your true servants we want your light to shine through our lives and we bless your holy name in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen god best use being seated praise God so you have a few slide to your case you just show by God's grace so we want to look at this first portion here of chapter 2 it's a beautiful portion by God's grace we'll continue on this lesson I'm gonna pull I got a few notes I want to read too on the Godhead because it gets into the Godhead here I want to find my notes real quick on modalism maybe we'll get to that I don't know if we'll get to that but that's a good thought to kind of see how Paul uses the scripture yeah okay here we go all right so we're ready to go by God's grace everybody have a nice holiday weekend everybody have a nice Saturday because you get to fellowship with the line of saints okay praise the Lord you guys have a nice weekend but good go anywhere or just stay at home okay oh that's right yeah yeah witcher's you good you get to tend the church while you're down there in Tennessee okay right oh yeah I know it's tough yeah well praise God that you had a safe trip by God's grace was it your family sister down there in Tennessee okay oh it's Rach okay praise God yeah I thought all your families up here is that right but okay I thought so before I forget I've been reading this book a pilgrim church it's written by eh broad back I don't know much about him but if you like a copy let me know also I there's a map Oh history there just like the one we got out there in the fellowship room I'm gonna make an order of those if you want one let me know if you'll use it they're really nice I like to be able to give our church or small church so if I get books I like you I like to offer them to you so if you want a book let me know I only read the first two chapters it's beautiful just see in the history and they go right along with the anti Nicean council books that brother Graham used there they're very similar in their history they kind of they must pull from the same historians and so they're really really great I just finished yesterday the Pergamos chapter I physicists Myrna Pergamos and we're almost halfway through that chapter by God's grace so really really wonderful testimonies and just amazing to see how God protected the little seed the little bride the little flock he just protected her all down through the aged and thankful that we're part of them praise God hallelujah so let's look here at chapter 2 now as I was saying Lord willing I think on last Sunday if I'm not mistaken the whole book of Philippians can almost be summarized like a sermon for your mind like a message about keeping your mind in the things of God like burl Ram says the greatest battle ever fought and so we'll get to that Lord willing but in verse 1 I'm just gonna review this real quick Paul asked are there if there's five things in Christ are these five things in Christ and of course we all know the answer is yes and when they're defined we would say this is their encouragement in Christ is their refreshment I just got a text from a brother in North Carolina this morning's I just want to appreciate your me tell you I appreciate your ministry he said it's like refreshing Living Waters I said well thank you brother I said which sermons a particular because I just kind of want to know like which one was I mean to me they're all refreshing them and he said this mystery series we've been doing on all the mysteries and he said all the sermons about proving all things and showing how jeffersonville's too far off and leaning the sign is too far off yet we're right down the middle so I thank the Lord those are all sermons so it's encouraging when people just out of nowhere well text you to say thanks for being a refreshing blessing to me so I know there's consolation in Christ amen comfort is there any goodwill in Christ is there any joint participation where we get to participate with one another and encourage one another love each other back and forth is there any bowels of love of Christ intense feelings of love for each other is there any pity on each other for Christ of course there is he says if there's any of this then he said fulfill my joy or fill me up to the top provide me with some joy because all of this is available in Christ make me happy make my joy befall by doing this by all of us having the same mind right with the same love one Accord one month that should remind us of the day of Pentecost they had one cook one of course in other words Paul saying act like the day of Pentecost everybody have one passion of court means passion it means desire everybody has one desire one Accord if there's anything good in Christ which we know there everything good about Christ everything's good in Christ but if there's any of this in Christ he said make me joyful by keeping the same mind now how'd they get there they prayed together they worshiped together right they they fellowship in the upper room that's how they got their praise not by staying in one Accord right one mind that's how they got there by being with each other and notice there's just I just want to say that you know Paul sang to do it for his sake right in other words live for other people praise God it is and so we would live you know in this case they were living to make the prophet happy right living to provide him joy that's what all of it and that should make us happy how many know that when you serve other people it actually makes you happy to see a life of service a life of serving other people not only makes you them happy but you happy praise God hallelujah was he living for yourself doesn't make you happy it doesn't make doesn't bring any fulfillment all right there's no contentment right godliness without can I'm sorry godliness with contentment is great gain the Bible says so see when you find your place and your position in Christ you're content because you're happy see because you're serving other people you can see the you can see the encouragement praise God let's go back in you can see how you refresh other people other people refresh you right you can see how you participated you have good friendship and fellowship with people your happiest feelings are with the saints of God amen oh that's beautiful praise God you log the resin we long to be with one another to worship the Lord together we should long to do that oh how many like that by God's grace oh that's beautiful remember Paul is just church he's riding to this church of Lydia right this is the church eleven years later this is the Church of the jailer praise God this is the Church of the woman who had the demon cast offer the witchcraft demon this is the church he's writing to people that had seen multiple miracles and God has opened their heart and know tremendous things that these we haven't even seen as far as like a jail being shaken and broken up things maybe we haven't seen but yeah his goal for them was that everybody would be in one Accord we live to make each other happy praise God we live to build up each other's happiness and joy in this life amen it's a great value and this is what I come to see right now this is a great value just to have a peaceful life in this hour so go to first Timothy 2 in your Bibles I'm just reminded of this simple scripture it's just such a great blessing to have peace because so many people you see it through their you know their social media posts or you see it when you talk to them so many people do not have peace they're living in torment under demon torment because they fail to take the Word of God but to me I can see it's a great blessing that we as believer can live in the peace of God amen for the world can't have it jesus said I leave you my joy the world won't receive it but I'm leaving it for you amen so we are the people the one group on this earth that can live in the joy of the Lord first Timothy 2:1 I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth praise God so just a reminder here this was Paul's prayer that he told Timothy to pray in Ephesus remember Ephesus was a very filthy City as a Roman province they adopted all the same habits of Rome so wicked well yet he's telling them that pray for your leaders right pray for them so we can lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty oh what a we should be so happy searching if we can live a life of peace if we can live a life of honesty and godliness we should be the happiest people praise God because so many people do not have that peace there's political unrest right in many nations you're the leaders are so corrupt now of course many of ours are too but at least we can live quiet and peaceable lives at least they're not interrupting you know our income and our food supply and all these things now it may come down to that of course right before the rapture and the squeeze it may come down to that but at least right now church we can look in our lives and we should praying for our leaders and thank God that we have a quiet peaceful godly honest life because this is good and acceptable in the sight of God amen that's what I'm learning right now just learning you know John Graham I still talk once a month and he always asked me every month he's like what are you learning about that what a good man and you know some boats I have a hard time like you talking about doctrine or what am i learning in my life and and recently we're supposed to talk last night forget the holiday I'm gonna Lord willing share this with him I'm learning just the value of having a peace and quiet quiet life just living a godly life because think about that you know we sang Battle Hymn of the Republic but their life in that time was not a life of peace it was war it was civil unrest and civil war can you imagine going to war nor itself against her family it just that's a life I don't want to live right I wouldn't want have to kill my cousins right we wouldn't have to kill fellow Americans but yet they had to the men had to go unless they had some reason they couldn't go and can you imagine how that was the age of the Philadelphia age you know anything of a man right that was the age that they delivered well we find ourselves here and we and we got to be encouraged that God has blessed us and giving us the blessings of this life thank God it's good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior now say like this just as much as they fought against slavery physically we ought to fight against the slavery of sin spiritually Amen praise God we got to fight against getting in bad habits right we're gonna fight against temptations right we got to fight against greed and anger and lust and all these things we ought to fight against that just as fiercely because we have a greater anointing we have the Eagle anointing amen oh thank the Lord praise God thank the Lord amen see we're living to make others joyful praise God that's what Paul's teaching is here in the scripture now I'm gonna move back in my Bible to Philippians the church I pray more that prayed for President Trump more than I prayed for any other leader I think that's I think why I think it's because we're coming down to the end now you know I'm paying a little more attention in the politics because I brother Bram said watch and pray I still pray but then I'm watching I'm looking when one of these churches going to unite with the government because my dad tells this this is how the temptation comes now it may not come in our day we may all have to have funeral services for one another humanity pets but it may not come in our day it may come in the next generation after us but we want to watch and be ready praise God and we want to leave a testimony that we fought for righteousness we believed in holiness and so I found myself you know watching these things and I would just even think another day I'm just thankful that God had President Trump win the election can you imagine if Hillary Clinton was the president right now I really would have imagined that and you see her husband's uh his name's getting thrown around for maybe being arrested with that Feinstein guy what's his name I forget my there's just a lot of corruption there is a lot of corruption I'm sure there's a lot of corruption in every in every leader maybe but I just thank the Lord then at least I can turn on like I watched your President Trump speech on Friday night for a little bit at least he could said at least he said thank God and God bless america god bless the USA and at least he fights for a little bit of religious freedom and thank God he stands for Israel you know I think I'm just saying as the time goes on I look at that scripture and Timothy I'm just thankful for God's mercy for this country praise God I think the Lord for it how the new you down here we look in the scripture verse to fulfill my joy so make me joyful in other words live for me the prophet says live for me that everybody will have the same mind and one Accord now let's flip through some of these scriptures here I'm gonna pull up my Bible here on my computer I thought was so striking ten times Paul refers to the minds let's just read them quickly Paul focuses on the mind this is the the letter of the believers to keep their minds United around the gospel of Jesus only let your conversation 127 be has it become at the gospel of Christ that wherever I come and see you or else I be absent I may hear your affairs and you stand fast in one sphere with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel that means a content so it could be a sports contest it could be a battle so we can either see ourselves as a sports team or as a military assembly praise God with one mind or to fight together or work together for the faith of the gospel praise God now 2 verse 2 that was in our text fulfill my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love one Accord one mind amen praise God oh thank you lord verse 3 let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mine oh my the greatest battle ever fought hallelujah praise God and each esteem other better than themselves verse 5 let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus so Paul you know he knows they got the Holy Ghost into the soul but he said let this mind be in you get your minds united together you've got a church for 11 years right we've had ours for 14 they had their church when you wrote this for 11 years he said we you need to have your mind united a church will manifest the love of God best when their minds are all focused on the same thing the gospel of Jesus Christ now 3:15 is the next mind Scripture let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded then if any I'm sorry and if anything ye be otherwise minded God shall even reveal you praise God let's keep the mind that we have and if God's gonna reveal anything else to us he'll do it raise God in other words God will show us the next step what should we focus on right now and then once we got that once we get that then he says if there's anything else that we need to focus on he'll reveal that to us as well praise God I love the scripture verse 16 nevertheless we're - we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing just so you know I'll get there a little bit in a few weeks here but rule means Canon it means a measuring stick a carpenter's line so Paul said everybody should have the same ruler right everybody should judge things let's judge President Trump by the same ruler we judged Barack Obama Amen Church right let's judge our lives by the same ruler that we judge other churches by Amen let's judge our church just like we do the Catholics right let's all judge one another by the same word of God aim ahead cuz that's how it is we all have the same ruler right we can judge everything the same by God's Word because that's how Jesus is gonna judge it on the day of judgment he's all gonna judge us by the same rule the same measuring stick so we're there shouldn't be many surprises on that day now there may be some surprise to us but there should be no surprises about our own lives because we've got a great measuring stick laying right in front of us all the time amen on our tablets on our phones in our hands we've got the measuring stick right here we should be constantly looking and examining us am i measuring up to God's standard for my life don't you love this I love the Word of God man this is so contrary to most churches right most churches that oh you're making the gospel a clothesline gospel or you're making the gospel rules the Bible just said it right there its rules right it's rule you you have to have to have a standard judge everything by praise God it's holy rules and if you love God you want to obey the rules amen ah thank you lord thank you Jesus 3:19 whose end is destruction whose God is their belly whose glory is their shame who mind earthly things so we know how we know we know what this is the people Paul says their God is their own belly and they're enemies of the cross so how do you become an enemy of the cross you own to serve yourself all the time you don't take the mind of the church right the mind of God's bride now the Bride of Christ let's talk about the denominational Church I've talked about the Bride of Christ you take the mind of the bride of Jesus Christ and you try to serve everybody in the church glory he said but this the shame of the world is to mine and meditate on earthly things this mind just means to understand or to let your opinions direct your thoughts to the world that's what it means all's they think about is the world I don't think about the church right now next one we have 319 yep that's the sinners mind for two for two I beseech you you Dyess I'm not sure how if I said it right and beseech Cintiq II that they be of the same mind in the Lord so the last chapter of the fourth chapter he starts getting down to individuals imagine having your name called on the on the letter that they read and then it's gonna be there for all eternity well at least for the next 2,000 years right but it's on the record nice so deep Paul knew these two women never got a I've never got along too well I don't want that to be me I don't want my name to be on that letter praise God I would have the same thoughts I don't have the same thoughts as Christ I want to be in one accord with the Saints I don't want to be known for having a disagreement with another brother in the church right or sister he said be of the same mind in the Lord now of course this means one of them was probably in sin right or maybe both of them are in sin we all know there's people in churches right that have the wrong mind and so we'll never be in one accord with them right because they love the things of the world right we would never like a sinner is in our church we wouldn't have the same mind as them Paul's not saying oh it's okay to think like sinners you know or backslidden people in the church no he's talking about people that are in sin and they need to get their thoughts off worldly things and get them on the things of God amen ah thank the Lord now 7 for 7 just a nice isn't it nice to see this same thing it's beautiful to see themes as Paul's writing his theme of this church it wasn't like gifts write gifts was like Corinthians and get their lives cleaned up and get the leaven out of the church but their church struggle with being of the same mind yet they were probably more mature right they were probably more mature than the corinthian church because he doesn't have to deal with the gifts doesn't have to deal with you know you know sinful lusts like he did with the first corinthians or with the corinthians and the first two letters 4:7 and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus I like that church let's take our thoughts through Christ let's run our thoughts through Christ first before we think about them right before we meditate on let's run all of our thoughts through the word praise God and then we'll have peace amen see the peace of God will come as we take all of our thoughts through the word through the word that's why I believe there's grace for people today even think about this church I think I'm not too sure this before but the Jews the blinded Jews are going to be saved they're gonna be given white robes the fifth seal tells us that well are they accepting the blood of Jesus right now no no right that they're blinded to it so they are not they're not accepting the blood right now but when they die where do they go under the altar the martyrs altar where there's blood there's blood on the altar praise God so if they live if they just live true to everything that they know then the blood of Christ will make a way for them amen and yet if you ask them they deny Christ and say no he's got the Messiah they deny him but the Bible says if you say that he's not the Messiah you're Antichrist right is that what first John says first Johnson who is he that the Antichrist the man that says Christ has not come in the flesh oh my and that power that just struck me sister Wendy I didn't even think about that beforehand anybody who says Christ is not coming the flesh is Antichrist and yet the blood of Jesus Christ will pardon amen and a wink at that ignorant right it'll look past the ignorance because God has put a blinding on them and the blood of Christ will still speak for there may man oh my thank God that's why the same thing will happen on the day of judgement the sheep and the goats there will be some that will be surprised when did we see you Jesus they'll be Hindus Muslims of there are all kinds of people as long and all different religions some heathen some atheists that can still be saved by the blood of Jesus because they did good to those on earth who represented the blood of Jesus amen because they had the Holy Spirit which represents the light if the life it's the literal light of the blood of Jesus Christ so they're not under the blood but they respect the blood they do good to the blood Oh not sure where that came from I thank the Lord that's why I believe there's hope for like Donald Trump he still owns casino shirts where they're strippers and all these things he still owns those things but there's hope if he'll repent praise God if you'll do good there's hope right there's hope for the Jew that will deny Christ there's hope for them if they live all that they know I believe that with all my heart if those Jews can do it if they God will immerse one of them got to be merciful to anyone because he's not a respecter of persons praise God now we did seven the peace will keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus now go to 8 here's the last one oh yeah okay so finally brother once our things are true what sort of things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely what are things of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these [Music] this letter that he writes remember church don't forget chapter 1 he's saying had the same mind same month same month and he ends by this is how you do it there's eight different things on that page on that scripture that that scripture verse eight there's eight different things you can meditate upon and meditate on those and it will make you new it'll make you live in the peace of God how many one live in the peace of God Hey amen ever God wants us to live a life of peace honesty good report right godliness this is how we do it we choose to think about the right things the lovely things okay so is that helpful I hope you get to see how Paul he writes the letter to this this is Philippi in this mature church but his whole desire all aim is focused on the spirit the spirit of man the human spirit and as far as we know this is the last thing you ever said to them as far as I know by history now I could learn more later right in the read that book I might learn more later but his last words we're to have the same mind think about the same thing I have one Accord that means whatever you're thinking about so you should be the same thing I'm thinking about are you think about the same thing I am are you am I thinking about the same thing you are yeah if your thing about Christ right that's that's his that's his message his message is everybody needs to think about the same thing all all day every day Jesus how can I honor Jesus with my finances praise God how can I honor Jesus in every area right with my family with my friends on the job how can I honor Jesus how can I glorify it like Paul so how can I magnify Jesus with my body in this life he said I could magnify him through death or I could magnify him through life the way to do it is everybody thinks the same thing praise God so am i outside of scripture if I preach everybody needs to have the same mind in our church you need to think about the same thing I you in my own scripture by saying that no there's a long something about Christ ready mystify breeches said sister Wendy this week think about godliness or you think about the water baptism think about the God in well as long as it's director the Lord right did you know Church from George Washington to Lincoln the president's called for over a thousand days of prayer and fasting do you know that brother I read that in the book they can go back and look at the records of all the presents they would have a day instead of like a holiday it'd be like a day of mourning and they would pray and fast for their sins for a thousand days that doesn't that sounded like what I'm talking about every like the presidents are saying everybody needs the repent on this day think about repenting and confessing your sins and Paul he's saying the same thing everybody needs to think about the same thing the gospel hey the good news of Jesus Christ amen I'm convicted by that I need to call more fasting days I need to call more in my office robear says the highest office in the world is a preacher now I'm not exalting myself above a present because I I couldn't match their intelligence I'm just not very smart but it's the highest office because you hold the words of eternal life and so I need to look at my life and say mine we need to we're gonna get our minds together we need to all be thinking about the same thing and that will produce unity right that will produce godly lives that will produce the kind of church that Jesus once well how do you know that because that's what he says in the next few verses here and uh Philippians chapter 2 so let's go to verse 3 make me joyful by all things about the same thing I start doing that sister when you I might eat Sunday I say listen everybody listen to me you need to think about this this week I'm I started doing crazy things like that maybe but it's really not crazy right I should I should seek the Lord and see if I should do that you need to think about the Statue of riverman this week or you didn't think about the unveiling of God or the masterpiece of God cuz we all need to think about the same thing the Word of God see there's some truth behind this I there's truth around all wanting to be in one Accord and thinking about the same thing announce that it shouldn't go to the other legal side you know shouldn't go to the manmade organization side but if we really love God which probably we do then we should be interested in getting our thoughts all on the same thing if we're Christians because that's what Paul says that's what Paul says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory I have the Greek definitions up here but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves so strife is contention it's electioneering for office so like politics right like Biden versus Trump that's what they're there now it can be done in a good way right but it can be wrong too this is the simple way electioneering for office desires to put oneself forward so in other words I'm going to I'm going to campaign I'm gonna exalt myself Paul said let nothing be done through strife campaigning putting yourself forward or vainglory empty pride vain opinion or airs in other words don't have a great opinion of yourself right now remember in the first chapter Paul said some preachers they build their entire ministry on strife I don't want that to be my testimony he said some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife their whole ministry is that they use it to end the other people right and then have stripe against other people trying to make themselves like brother Graham said the Methodists are all trying to get the Baptist in their church right the Baptist's are all trying to get the Pentecostals and prevents the Pentecostals are trying to get them all their whole ministries are built upon strife that's why I don't I don't try to proselyte and draw anybody to our churches I just say go go whatever church you feel that of the Holy Spirit to go to right that's what we're not supposed to do that and some of good will we want to have a church we wanted to preach Christ of good will want to build our lives and our ministry on the good will of God I want to start showing you a few things here with the Greek see strife workers Paul tells us are not born again so anyone that's purposely trying to exalt themselves and you know compete in a local church or church versus church there it's impossible they can't be born again because the Bible said they that work strike do not inherit the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost jesus said the kingdom of God is within you see Paul is saying this is not the testimony of the bride of Jesus Christ this is not her testimony she doesn't work according to strife or vainglory pride electioneering but they esteem others better than themselves okay so see we got a look at all these words and see how Paul uses them all throughout his letters and then that brings us to this conclusion people that work stripe and vainglory that can't be born again now verse 3 Paul also pleads for no Paul please for no strike he said take a lowliness of mind mind set right he said but in lowliness of mine we own it if we all would have one Accord you must have lowliness of mind what's that mean now I want to start showing you some Greek here as well go forward now this is copied and pasted it from the lexicon on the table software now Church see they'll have one Greek word right this is a Greek word when it can be used in this case is used in three different ways well yeah well I'm sorry three times humility and then it's these are the three times and then it's loneliness of mind one time that's the authorized version there isn't it's usually translated as humility so loneliness or a humble mind right humble mind and then church as you see the lexicon it gives many different definitions now and I'll say like this you have to sift through the definitions to see which one fits the context okay so this means if you have a lowliness of mind you have a humble opinion of yourself you have a deep sense of your littleness right how many realized sometimes morally you're pretty little sometimes you disappoint yourself and you make decisions and you act in a way it's not pleasing to God how many could say amen to that amen yeah I have a I have a deep sense of how I will disobey God's Word of time at times I realize how morally little I am if I'm not constantly praying if I'm not constantly meditating on the word and studying I my moral ability is very little right if I don't study and pray and worship God in my house if I don't stay close to God I'll do things that will embarrass me so here this is what he calls a lowliness of mind he said be a one accord and in lowliness of mine in this humble attitude in other words like I better change my thinking because if not I'm gonna stumble and fall I better humble myself I need to have a humble mind because I know if I don't say close to God I'm gonna embarrass myself in other words I don't want to bring reproach upon Jesus Christ I realize if I'm not if I'm not actively thinking about it I'm gonna reproach the gospel that I claim to believe in other words I'm gonna bring shame on the message that I tell everybody I believe so you have to take a lowliness of mind say Oh God I realize I could stumble right here help me god help me it's a lowliness of mind that was verse 3 see don't let don't be don't do anything through strife vainglory but in lowliness of mind with this idea that I'm not careful I'm gonna fall short of God's glory he says esteem others better than yourselves here let me just give you an example here I thought I put up here here I want to show you that the lexicon is not the absolute real quick so if a preacher says now they might say sometimes it might be true they say see it's in the Greek that's the actual definition that may work on some of them and not all of them okay so the word spirit like Holy Spirit that's the Greek word church it has 12 different words or phrases that can be translated to 12 different ones plus it's got 21 miscellaneous you like they you know sometimes sometimes I'll use this fear word for like the mind like or evil spirit or the human spirit or the spirit of Christ it's got to be very careful how you interpret things right oh my people get in trouble sometimes using the wrong Greek definitions or Hebrew definitions they'll say I got it out of the Hebrew well which which one which definition of the Hebrew which one that doesn't just because you use one of the definitions doesn't mean it's the right one right here because here's an exact so yeah here's an example with spirit there's four definitions just for the word spirit like Holy Spirit and the last one says he's the third person of the Trinity so is the lexicon the absolute no the lexicon was written by a man as well right so there's a man took his ideas and said well one of these definitions are for him there's these 21 different words or phrases and here's four definitions that they often take and one of them says the Holy Spirit's the third person of the Trinity so see somebody could say see it didn't date Greek he's the third person but what is the rest of the Bible saying see Church that's why knowing books and intellectualism isn't enough you've got to have a revelation of God's truth about what is actually the truth they men so let's say like this you have to filter the Greek through the rest of the word amen you got to filter the Greek and Hebrew definitions through the word because there's no other word that says God is three persons not only says he's one person so see even as a minister I have to take every definition and make sure it filters through the filter I got a port through here and make sure filters through the Word of God as well verse three let nothing be done through strife or vainglory now what did I highlight here oh yeah let's look at this next part esteeming others better than himself see how program says this book is eternal I could preach all day on just one half of a verse I could just go down that thought of lowliness in mind I could just take that look how we need have a deep sense of our sinfulness in our flesh and our body and if we don't we'll exonerol think oh we can handle the temptation and will fall and embarrass ourselves you could take a whole sermon on that but see that's why the work thank God thank God the words eternal I preach now for what since 2000 for 16 years for 16 years I don't even feel like I scratch the surface of it I haven't but I want to go deeper I want to know God more praise God and the way to do that is through the word because the spirit will always been decayed the word amen so with this humble lowliness of mind and I think how important it is how many message churches do you know how many churches in general where they really have this lowliness of mind where they come to church and they they want to think like all the other believers they want to be united and they realize they got to be so careful how they live their lives they don't call it they don't cause somebody to stumble and they they don't bring reproach upon the message or Jesus Christ how many people come to church like that I don't think it's that many a church sometimes it's our fault right but that's why that's why we sing right that's to get our minds off those other things that's why we enjoy the specials and to get our minds off of our thoughts and and try to bring ourselves to a spot of humility where at that moment once we're humility then we can have the Holy Spirit bring us the directions for our lives and how to active the next step right what he's going to reveal next to us because we got to get all these other things out of our mind right and come down to a humble say let's have to humble ourselves in order to receive God's Word because the way up is down a lowliness of mind and so that's how God designed it come to the house of God leave your home right live streaming's good but it's not a permanent solution right you need to get a way out of your home because you're gonna find other jobs in your home or fall asleep on your comfortable couch we're gonna go get a smoothie or something like that or a popsicle during the service I hope they didn't do that [Laughter] they need food sometimes but I'm just you understanding we gotta we gotta leave our homes right Martha or Mary had to leave her cleaning job or dusting does this need dusted I haven't dusted it for a while it's actually pretty good leave your dusting job right and just drive somebody drive so far god unless you got reward you for that well justice he wants us to leave all of our home behind thinking Oh everything about that just for one day out of the week amen and that's just like a small portion of the day leave all that behind and come here and get our minds humbled instead of prideful I can do it I'm gonna provide for myself and I'll do this I'm gonna do it and get past that and and get down to a humble state you just meditate on the things of God how can I serve and love my local church family or if God's calling me to do mission work how can I do that but we got to get out of our car or work mindset and life or just busyness mindset business mindset home business or whatever business and get into the lowliness of mind of a Christian and when you do this you esteem others more important than yourselves that's why I church I like to offer you these books I bought myself a book I want to offer you one right I bought you those Perry green but remember that last year about you I've ever gave everybody those Jason to Mars books and everything like that I want to I want to remember if I'm doing this for myself I need to do that for the people who con to write I'm happy to do that I love do that but I gotta get the right mindset right I gotta have a lowliness of mind I'm not better than anybody I'm nothing I get weak I fail I fall short of God's glory how could I help God's people today that's not fair what can I do to strengthen Diane's faith today what can I do to raise Lydia's fate today what can I do that's a servant's attitude now look at the Greek here for a steam better steam better now there's a lot of definitions to have or hold over one yeah maybe so see I I'll show you how I made bold the ones that I felt fit the context of the scripture better esteeming others better than yourself to stand out to rise above over top now that that could be yeah you know you want people to rise above yourself that could be it too but to be above superior see what I think all that person such a their needs are way more important than mine they're such a wonderful servant to the Lord I want to serve them I'm the least of the like Paulsen I'm the least of the Apostles I'm the lowest of the Apostles yet he was probably the greatest but he called himself the least to excel to be severe that person excels me and their walk with the Lord their needs are so important they're those needs are better they're more important than my needs this is what the lowliness of mind is I I can fall short I can make all kinds of mistakes but I'm gonna cling to God on this Sunday morning this whole Sunday I'm going to cling to and try not to cause anybody stumble and then try to see how I can meet the needs of others who are more important than me Paul said that's the kind of mindset we want to have when we come to church mothers do it all the time mothers you got those children you always put the needs of the children above yourselves don't you right thank God for mothers I mean they're pretty good at their like pros ethic because you know as soon as the child needs something they go do it you know they don't really think about their own needs they go do it but it but it's something that we all need to do in our church right we all need to have a loneliness of mind and see how we can serve other people and make their needs more important than ours how many would say that's a pretty good challenge to every church I would say that's a great challenge for any message Church denominational huh my where everybody had one thought and the thought is how can I serve people that are more important than me most people come to church say I want something from God I want something I want something don't get me wrong he's going to be blessed right but most people come to church like that what am I going to get out give me something on but Paul says we have one Accord and how can I give to other people it's not done through strife or pride or vainglory something through a lowliness of mind first form well finally we're getting on verse 3 go that's it oh that's a tough verse right for our flesh right in our mind verse 4 look not every man on his own things so this is how you do it so if we want lowliness of mind this is how you do it you got to turn your eyes and when you do that Jesus will tell you now look at somebody else right first you gotta look on him and see oh look on I'm so lowly Wow I don't look at you I must humble but then he'll point you once you got that right mindset now he'll point you down to look at other people yes Lord I can go help sister so-and-so yeah Lord I'll be happy to see if I can try to encourage brother so-and-so he said look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others so just caring for people's general needs a member Wednesday night we looked at that on the statute perfect man brotherly kindness is all about how you treat your local church how do you treat your brother in Christ right forgive them 490 times in a day oh mercy lord help us Jesus Oh as far as I don't know once it against me 490 times in one day I don't think anybody ever has so hopefully I haven't done that to you but if I do I hope you have enough grace to forgive me this is the love of Jesus Christ how many need more that love absolutely this is this is the the best way he can try to help us to understand how great is his love will even 490 times in one day if you sit against me the love of God would still have grace to forgive you because you care about other people's needs once you get out of your si like this your high high mindedness there it is high mindedness about talk about high-minded Eddie hi - oh hi - you're thinking only about you but if God could just get us to low minded can you just get us to low lowliness of mind or we can start thinking about other people caring for their needs that's my turkey you know you can get a joy just by opening the door for somebody off right after church just open the door be nice for someone you see they drop something pick it up for them or if they look thirsty out in the parking lot go get a water for that's okay because brother a man wants to buy those for the church so just so you know thank you very mad if you're watching buddy praise God I just it's just a ministry he wants to do he wants to buy water for the church that's nice yeah amen - amen but you understand like that's just a simple thing caring for other people instead of thinking about me me me thinking about you you you and you and you holiness of mind and I'll say like this church lets you know even use your words just use your words to build somebody up just tell them something nice like oh I appreciate that song today or I appreciate oh yeah I appreciate your testimony you know or appreciate when you did this and thanks for doing that just try to lift people up praise God it's most time we just get torn down by the world right they just they try to make fun of us tear us down you know we should come here and trying to build each other up praise God comfort one another you don't strengthen one another it refreshed one another praise God build each other up care for them that's why you're not trying to clap when you you know when people make big sacrifices they drive three nap hours and they drive two hours let's clap for those people that's it let's encourage them cuz it's a sacrifice praise God uh-huh and we want to look on we want to get our minds off other people I'm sorry we want to get our minds off ourselves rather and look at other people we look to Christ looking unto Jesus the author of our finisher our faith he humbles us and gives us a low innocent mind that we can look at other people now a lot of churches since most people are lost a lot of churches will never achieve this I want our church to achieve this I'm resting on this I know you are too I'm resting I'm resting on Paul's gospel right this is what we're this is we anchor our souls on this this is what our church needs to become all the time it's easy to earn special meanings right but what you want we're gonna become every Sunday we want to be in this kind of church lowliness to mind so here's a good example with lowliness not sure here's gonna grab up looking Dex let me go to the next slide here no yeah army so looking so there's a you know there's two words I'm not sure oh yes mark is used twice and then there's three three times it's used like that and so look at he says therefore looking upon esteeming others looking on them having a regard for a thing so in other words caring for them when you look at someone looking to care how can I encourage them how can i strengthen them today looking unto every man on his own things I'm sorry I looking not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others so let's Regis review real quick these scriptures the first floor Oh all Christians need to be like minded now it's not an option right it wasn't an option did Paul say well some of you can think alike and others can think whatever they want to think about no the church should come under the leadership when we all come under leadership of the Holy Spirit we all think about the same things with the same love and what a core one mind thinking there are servants to the local church members is that what you got out of the first four verses that's what I got out because remember he's writing to a local church right a local church in Philippi eleven years after he started it he only got a few days maybe with that maybe a week not very long and he's just pleading with them everybody needs to think about the same thing serving one another in church you know I don't feel bad going slow on this you know what cuz I know this is the age of self-love Paul said they're gonna be lovers of their own selves and lovers of pleasures more than God we need to slow down on our busy lives amen and get our minds off of ourselves stop loving ourselves so much it's art eleven other people praise God that's my I see it in my life Church I'm sure you do too I want to get my eyes on other people on how I can be a half to them I do enough loving myself right I take care of myself and I do that I do enough of that we want to see how we can love other people praise God and I know that's one thing I need to grow in I need to grow and loving more having this lowliness of mind and constantly loving other people so in verse 6 now finding the verse 6 okay I'm about out of our good praise God that seems about right you know Wednesday's been going so fast but that this this seems about right about our now verse 6 who I'm sorry nice coupon yeah I'm sorry I skipped it I'm sorry yeah verse 5 sorry yeah yeah forgive me first time so I'm gonna give you a screenshot this is a screenshot of the Greek so each word as a line has a Greek word for it or words so verse 5 he said let this mind be in you so how do we all have the same mind how do we look on other people take the mind of Christ let us take the word of they take the word mind right take word thoughts in other words read your Bible praise God right that's that's the only way I know to get out of my thoughts and get them on to God's thoughts or listen to a sermon while I'm washing dishes or mowing or whatever I'm doing get the mind of the word praise God that's what I love this book this book says it shows how the first Church of Rome started all the corruption but they says ad anywhere just the plain Bible was whoever this Bible was it always started revivals Amen because just the plain word of God just laying there and somebody meditating on it and believing it will cause to come down and annoy and inspire that person to believe it and show that it's real praise God so no matter how many people they killed as long as somebody had a real copy of this and it was those actual words of God and decided and wanted to know if it was real and what did they believe it wasn't a serve god as long as somebody had the word God was there amen and God would start a revival and God would do great things as long as they had his word and Turkey you know as as they killed the 68 million right Smuckers glorious Reformation as they killed the 68 9oz it was doing was planting seeds praise God and they would die then those seeds would be brought forth right and it would produce more and more and more praise God in other words they couldn't stop the gospel just like Jesus died and the Bible said he would see his seed praise God amen he would see his offspring the same thing with Christianity the more they kill the more they kept growing amen and expanding because the life the family of God had to move on thank you Jesus how do you get this loneliness of mind how do you start looking at other people let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so we can't say well it's impossible for me to think like that it's impossible for me to have the mind of Christ no it's not because Christ did it he had a mind that thought about the word only the word because this mind first was in Christ Jesus meditating constantly on the Word of God and notice you have to let it you can't force I'm sorry guys that gonna force you you gotta let it you're free more agency you have to let this mind be in you you gotta let this scriptures these scriptural thoughts you gotta let them come into your mind open the door and let it come into your mind that's right okay so mine has all those definitions be minded mine regard all these definitions let this mine now here's the here's the definitions to have understanding be wise other words let the understanding of Christ that it be in you let the wisdom of Christ come come into you let the mind of Christ being you the same mind agree together cherish the same hues harmonious direct your mind to a thing so let this mind let your mind be directed to see to strive for to seek ones interest or advantage so let the interests of Christ's mind be in you what would Christ be interested in doing if he was in your life or if he was walking in your shoes what would he do that's what we must do let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus his interests his desires okay now I'm gonna go back I thought I was going back so verse six lost my spots I was using my Bible good example verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God so we get the first four verses so this is what the first four verses said all Christians need to think the same way to serve each other right so we get cert this mind of a servant by letting Christ mindset rule ours and Jesus modeled this for us so we're going to have to look at the life of Jesus Christ and see how he got his mind in the right position and then that will give us the right understanding that'll show us how to get our minds there right and this is the greatest battle ever fault this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus alright let's reverse is six to eight who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross this is the mind that was in Christ willing to die even though he didn't want to right willing to accept death and not just an easy death the most difficult cruel death imaginable this was the mind that was in Christ I'll suffer any legs to do God's will to give my life as a sacrifice for others he said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now Lord willing I think I'm gonna stop there cuz I want to get into the Godhead here tonight so let me stop there musicians if you'll come let's stand to our feet praise God and I was tell my wife to since I got a song me and preach I better or my sermons though so I can have some voice left for tonight praise God oh thank you Jesus praise God do you love that word church you love that word well I just I love I don't know something about it I love going verse by verse and trying to catch the same mind that Paul wrote it with it's beautiful I can see how the church in Philippi is very similar to our church since we're still here we must still need loneliness to mind since we're still here if we were perfect we'd be gone right if God was finished with us he would take us home but because he's not finished with us we still need to have one mind one Accord nothing through strife or vainglory the lowliness of mind esteeming others better than ourselves display that turn your eyes upon Jesus that's play that here [Music] there's something very beautiful about [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's art [Music] [Music]
