[27:21] but may we pick up and follow after the
[27:24] leadership of the holy spirit
[27:27] in jesus christ's name and the church
[27:29] said
[27:30] amen praise god let's take our bibles
[27:32] and stand here we'll do our memory burst
[27:46] so let's start with uh our text though
[27:48] for the the scripture here
[27:51] let's just go to second peter chapter
[27:53] one we like to look at
[27:55] the mystery of godliness restore to man
[27:57] part three
[28:01] second peter chapter one then we'll go
[28:03] to philippians four seven and eight and
[28:05] then lord willing i'll reach out to the
[28:07] next person to see
[28:09] what memory verse they'd like to do i'm
[28:10] not quite sure who was next but
[28:13] uh off to think about that
[28:15] this weekend by god's grace
[28:25] second peter chapter one
[28:36] praise god now we looked at uh last
[28:38] wednesday
[28:41] how peter said add which is supply so
[28:43] god wants to supply us with faith
[28:46] then we saw in romans that it's a
[28:48] measure god wants to give us a measure
[28:50] of each one of these spiritual
[28:52] attributes aren't you glad about it how
[28:54] do you get it by believing the promise
[28:57] it's a gift each one is a gift
[28:59] on this journey
[29:01] to the promised land praise god
[29:03] so let's read that actually i'll read
[29:05] first let's i'll read myself and then
[29:08] lord willing
[29:11] we'll do our memory verse after this
[29:13] i'm going to read verse 4. ii peter 1 4
[29:17] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[29:19] great and precious promises that by
[29:22] these you might be partakers
[29:24] of the divine nature so see each one is
[29:27] a promise faith is a problem if you
[29:29] believe it
[29:32] virtue is a promise if you believe it
[29:34] knowledge and so forth
[29:36] having escaped the corruption that is in
[29:38] the world through lust and beside this
[29:40] giving all diligence how much human
[29:42] effort is required
[29:44] all
[29:45] all diligence
[29:48] because jesus
[29:50] sold out all and poured out all his love
[29:53] to us so the least we can do
[29:55] is give all of our love to him
[29:58] giving all diligence add to your faith
[30:00] virtue and the virtue knowledge
[30:02] and to knowledge temperance of the
[30:03] temperance patience and the patience
[30:05] godliness and the godliness brotherly
[30:07] kindness
[30:08] and the burly kindness charity okay
[30:11] let's go to philippians 4 7 and 8.
[30:36] how many are thankful for god's peace
[30:38] tonight
[30:39] praise god it passes all understanding
[30:45] let's read verses uh seven and eight
[30:48] let's read it together on three one
[30:50] two three
[30:52] and the peace of god which passeth all
[30:55] understanding
[30:57] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[31:00] christ jesus
[31:01] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[31:04] true
[31:05] whatsoever things are honest
[31:08] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[31:12] things are pure
[31:14] whatsoever things are lovely
[31:16] whatsoever things are of good report
[31:19] if there be any virtue and if there be
[31:23] any praise
[31:24] think on these things amen may god add
[31:27] his blessings to the reading of his word
[31:29] may be seated
[31:34] [Music]
[31:44] it's a little bit warm so i'm going to
[31:45] take off my jacket here for god's grace
[31:55] so lord willing uh we'll preach part
[31:57] three tonight
[31:59] by the grace of the lord
[32:05] um
[32:07] i'll just
[32:08] real real quick review here uh we
[32:10] started with godliness and
[32:12] we saw it was loyalty it was reverence
[32:14] respect or loyalty to god it's a great
[32:16] mystery now it's not just a small
[32:18] mystery it's a great mystery you know
[32:20] looking at all the mysteries i would say
[32:22] the small mystery might be how jew and
[32:25] gentiles are one church
[32:27] if you're looking at as far as which one
[32:29] is maybe the easiest to grasp
[32:32] uh definitely that one and maybe the
[32:33] bride isn't as the i'm sorry the church
[32:36] rather as the bride those are pretty uh
[32:41] i'd say they're easier
[32:42] um
[32:44] mysteries to grasp but paul calls this
[32:46] one great mystery and that's why there's
[32:48] so much confusion in the message it's a
[32:50] great mystery
[32:52] uh but it's god manifest in the flesh
[32:55] the life of jesus christ
[32:58] revealed
[32:59] true godliness true loyalty
[33:02] uh
[33:03] true faithfulness and devotion to god
[33:05] and that's what we are invited to
[33:07] partake of by jesus be there for
[33:10] perfect
[33:11] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[33:14] so he made a way through it was through
[33:16] constant addition of more and more of
[33:19] god's anointing there's no shortcuts
[33:22] that's what the foolish virgin wants to
[33:24] do right they want to go find a shortcut
[33:25] well how can i quickly get the oil
[33:28] but it's not done through shortcuts it's
[33:29] through a daily life of sacrifice
[33:32] devotion loyalty
[33:34] uh
[33:36] and all these reverence all these
[33:38] uh diligence all these adjectives that
[33:41] describe a christian's daily walk of
[33:44] taking up his cross daily and following
[33:47] the leadership of the holy spirit
[33:49] just like jesus
[33:51] uh even by the age of 12 it was
[33:53] increasing in wisdom and understanding
[33:56] uh and knowledge of god
[34:00] then we saw the biblical proof we looked
[34:03] at
[34:04] jesus
[34:05] saying how much human effort is required
[34:07] all your strength all your love
[34:11] and that's because
[34:12] uh
[34:13] some human effort is required it takes
[34:16] the will of the human in order to be
[34:19] saved or else everyone will be saved
[34:21] the human has to surrender
[34:23] uh choose to hate the things of the
[34:25] world
[34:26] and love the things of god
[34:29] and we'll get a little bit more to that
[34:30] tonight by the grace of the lord
[34:34] then we saw there was two types of
[34:36] godliness there's one in sanctification
[34:38] before you're born again and then
[34:40] there's
[34:41] uh the maturity level of godliness after
[34:43] you're born again and we saw how peter
[34:46] and paul both taught on this paul was
[34:48] most extensive on this teaching paul
[34:50] said we can inherit all godliness or we
[34:53] can uh
[34:55] yeah we can receive it by god's gift
[34:57] through bringing our body into
[34:59] subjection
[35:00] to the word of god and remember it was
[35:03] so valuable
[35:04] he said uh great gain it's great gain to
[35:07] have the attribute of godliness
[35:10] fruitfulness christian maturity that's
[35:12] the stature of a perfect man the
[35:15] maturity
[35:16] of a perfect man in church that's what's
[35:18] burning on my heart that's what i want
[35:20] to grow into
[35:21] a more mature christian
[35:23] that can follow the leadership of god
[35:25] right in the spur of the moment
[35:30] and so we don't want a form of godliness
[35:32] we saw that was satan's tactic
[35:34] to
[35:35] trick people into a form like the
[35:37] pharisees now attending church and
[35:40] and memorizing things and
[35:42] paying tithes is good they all did that
[35:44] but remember it was the wrong thing they
[35:46] were memorizing the mishnah rather than
[35:49] god's commands and they made the
[35:50] commandments of men
[35:52] more important than the commandments of
[35:54] god now we should memorize god's word
[35:57] and quotes from the gods prophet when
[35:59] they line up with god's holy bible right
[36:01] here the absolute
[36:03] praise god
[36:04] uh
[36:05] and then if we do that then he'll give
[36:07] us the token the holy spirit praise god
[36:10] so we saw that and then now we looked
[36:12] and uh now we went to peter we looked at
[36:16] peter's teaching on godliness as part of
[36:18] sanctification
[36:20] so the first godliness you receive is
[36:22] sanctification
[36:24] all right
[36:26] and this uh this is what peter said he
[36:30] said it's adding he's gonna give us a
[36:32] supply
[36:33] so i love this god is gonna supply you
[36:36] and i with our fuel for the journey
[36:38] right he's going to give us the fuel
[36:40] that we need to make it all the way to
[36:43] the promised land praise god and we saw
[36:46] this of course comes through the
[36:47] preaching of the five full ministry i
[36:50] hope church every time you live stream
[36:52] you feel stronger you ought to because
[36:54] it's god's way to fuel your soul praise
[36:57] god
[36:58] uh so you'll receive the end of your
[37:00] faith a lot of people start start with
[37:02] faith right but then like jesus says it
[37:05] can be snatched off your ground if you
[37:07] don't take that seed and if you don't
[37:09] water it and clear out the ground
[37:12] and
[37:13] rid it of all those weeds
[37:15] it won't produce what it's supposed to
[37:19] but if you if you
[37:21] like i talked with that brother wesley
[37:23] you know after we got done off the phone
[37:24] you know he lives in texas i think
[37:26] he sent me a text the other day just
[37:28] saying i'm so strengthened and
[37:30] encouraged just by talking to you
[37:32] i thought praise the lord see virtue has
[37:35] to be able to flow out of us praise god
[37:37] we don't have virtue for a hungry soul
[37:38] we don't have nothing except maybe faith
[37:41] that might be all we have
[37:42] we should have virtue so that people
[37:44] come in contact with us and they can uh
[37:47] receive some blessing from god some
[37:49] strength from god and that's what we
[37:51] hope to do tonight as we preach god's
[37:53] word that you'll receive
[37:54] god's portion god's
[37:56] supply of his spirit for you tonight his
[37:59] word praise god
[38:01] through the five bowl ministry now we
[38:03] ended with that
[38:05] now starting tonight
[38:08] each of these character qualities that
[38:10] we read from peter
[38:11] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[38:13] patience goddess brother kindness and
[38:15] charity
[38:16] is a character quality god wants to give
[38:20] us
[38:21] and each one church and children is a
[38:23] spiritual crossroad
[38:26] you come to the intersection
[38:28] uh of faith
[38:30] right that's when you got saved
[38:32] each one is a spiritual crossroad or we
[38:34] can like it until like the uh each one
[38:37] is a stop
[38:38] when the pillar of fire is leading us on
[38:41] right just like the pillar of fire led
[38:43] israel out of egypt
[38:45] we have to follow the holy spirit to the
[38:47] first crossroad right theirs was the red
[38:49] sea baptism
[38:51] praise god that's very fitting amen
[38:54] and it's like a cross road we have to be
[38:56] able to go through that red sea go
[38:58] through the water baptism praise god
[39:00] thank god most of us were not ashamed to
[39:02] be baptized
[39:04] uh we called upon the name of the lord
[39:05] in the friends of a public people we're
[39:08] not ashamed to say i want the holy ghost
[39:10] i want to be forgiven i want to go to
[39:12] heaven you weren't ashamed at that
[39:14] crossroad to go through that road and
[39:17] keep following the leadership of the
[39:18] holy spirit praise god
[39:21] that's what it is it's a crossroad
[39:25] and so see believers must decide at each
[39:27] step to either continue growing or
[39:30] continue
[39:32] progressing in your walk with the lord
[39:33] perfecting holiness in the fear of god
[39:36] receiving god's strength to keep going
[39:38] or turn it down
[39:39] walk in obedience and keep going and
[39:41] growing or disobedience and stop
[39:45] and
[39:46] atrophy or fall back
[39:48] or like the bi like peter says like a a
[39:51] dog go back to its vomit or sow go back
[39:53] to the mud all these illustrations that
[39:56] they give us
[39:57] we must at each crossroad we must move
[39:59] on with the holy spirit and follow the
[40:02] right leadership of the lord
[40:04] praise god
[40:09] so at each crossroad god is going to
[40:11] have his his supply of anointing and
[40:13] then satan's going to have his bait
[40:15] right his trap
[40:17] and we've got to be able to choose god's
[40:19] anointing and god's supply and turn down
[40:22] the trap that satan wants to and snare
[40:25] us in
[40:26] okay
[40:27] life and death is set before every
[40:29] believer
[40:30] right at each stage
[40:33] just like adam and eve the choice
[40:35] knowledge of good and evil or life each
[40:37] one is set before us all throughout our
[40:39] journey just like israel they had a
[40:41] choice each step
[40:42] from red sea all the way at each step
[40:44] all the way to kadesh barnea to go in
[40:46] and possess the promised land they had a
[40:49] choice each time
[40:50] so i have i implore you i beseech you to
[40:55] obey the holy spirit at every spiritual
[40:57] crossroad of your life that's what i'm
[40:59] aiming to do i hope you're doing the
[41:01] same thing by the grace of the lord
[41:04] you'll either accept god's gift at the
[41:06] crossroad or you'll turn it down to
[41:08] accept something worldly
[41:12] all right
[41:13] so let's go through each and every one
[41:14] here
[41:15] the first one is faith faith is a
[41:17] substance needed to choose god's way
[41:21] so you either accept god's gift of faith
[41:24] or
[41:25] you'll
[41:26] reject it for unbelief you'd rather
[41:29] choose not to believe and because i
[41:31] don't believe i don't love it then i'll
[41:33] love the things of the world
[41:35] so that's the first choice you have to
[41:37] make
[41:38] do i want a substance of god's
[41:40] assurance his trust his faith because
[41:42] that's what faith is trust or revelation
[41:45] you trust you know god's will and you're
[41:48] trusting in god's will
[41:49] praise god or do you reject it and
[41:51] choose to disbelieve
[41:53] and live according to your your
[41:56] pleasures of your flesh or the lust of
[41:57] the eyes the pride of life lust of the
[41:59] flesh
[42:03] now in this series lord willing you know
[42:05] i felt
[42:06] i know i was anointed the holy spirit to
[42:08] write on each of these subjects
[42:10] and i felt led to do the same thing
[42:12] brother branham did when he taught the
[42:14] seals he would get the revelation and
[42:16] then search every time it was used in
[42:18] the concordance well that's what i've
[42:20] done is i wrote this book months and
[42:21] months ago i wrote this chapter
[42:23] by the i believe by leadership of the
[42:25] holy spirit so i take each word faith
[42:28] and trace it all through the bible
[42:29] though as a that was a big study right
[42:31] there faith i think it was over 200
[42:33] times just in the new testament
[42:36] uh
[42:37] and then what brother graham did like
[42:39] with oil and wine
[42:40] and then or the color white like white
[42:42] horse rider your
[42:44] your sins worst crimson but they'll be
[42:45] made white like snow you know from
[42:47] isaiah you got to take each one and
[42:49] rightly divide it and place it in the
[42:51] right category right so the white horse
[42:54] rider went into the antichrist category
[42:57] but the white horse rider of revelation
[42:58] 19 that's christ amen that's good white
[43:01] that has a a good spiritual
[43:03] representation isaiah you know your sins
[43:06] scarlet made white that's on the good
[43:08] side that's the holy spirit side right
[43:10] uh forgiveness
[43:12] because that matches in revelation 7
[43:15] that great multitude that no man could
[43:17] number he said where did these come from
[43:19] he said these have washed their robes
[43:20] white they've gone through great
[43:21] tribulation and they've washed their
[43:24] robes white in the blood of the lamb
[43:26] praise god amen thank god for the blood
[43:28] of the lamb today praise god that we can
[43:31] wash our robes white and it's fitting i
[43:33] got a white shirt on i didn't plan that
[43:34] but that's our garment should be white
[43:37] like the shirt
[43:38] uh free from sin stains praise god
[43:41] confess our sins of following the
[43:43] leadership of the holy spirit desiring
[43:45] to grow closer to god be more like him
[43:48] and get a fresh supply of his spirit
[43:51] amen
[43:53] so let's get our bibles here now we'll
[43:55] start looking at a few scriptures here
[43:59] kesha hebrews 11 1 and malachi hebrews
[44:01] 11 6.
[44:10] so let's have acacia read uh hebrews 11
[44:13] 1 so the first character quality that
[44:15] god wants to supply you with god has
[44:17] laid this before us right
[44:19] this measure god has laid it out and
[44:21] said it's a gift it's like a christmas
[44:23] present or a birthday present just hand
[44:25] it to you god is trying to hand it to
[44:27] you right satan wants to hand you that
[44:29] box of rattlesnakes unbelief but god's
[44:32] trying to hand you this divine gift of
[44:34] faith
[44:35] so uh can you read that hebrews 11 1
[44:39] now faith is the substance of things
[44:42] hoped for the evidence of things not
[44:44] seen okay malachi hebrews 11 6
[44:48] but without faith it is impossible to
[44:50] please him for he that cometh to god
[44:52] must believe that he is and that he is a
[44:54] reward of them that diligently seek him
[44:56] praise god so we see faith is the
[44:58] foundation and it is not just an
[45:00] imagination it's an actual substance
[45:03] it's a spiritual substance now we know
[45:05] it's not natural
[45:07] right it's spiritual substance
[45:09] so that means what other substance could
[45:11] it be it has to be the holy spirit right
[45:14] because there's only two kinds of
[45:15] spirits there's either
[45:17] holy or unholy so faith has to be a
[45:21] measure or characteristics of the holy
[45:23] spirit that god gives to us and you
[45:26] cannot please god without it
[45:28] see god would be unpleased god would be
[45:31] displeased rather if you turn down his
[45:33] gift how could you how could you and i
[45:34] turn down such a matchless gift the gift
[45:37] of faith eternal life praise god
[45:40] and so god cannot be pleased
[45:43] unless
[45:44] uh we accept that gift and then he lets
[45:47] us know there's more so we should
[45:49] diligently seek for more and then he'll
[45:52] reward us
[45:53] if we know this small portion is so
[45:55] great
[45:56] what faith can do in someone's life like
[45:58] zacchaeus or the woman the forgiven
[46:00] woman as we'll get to later look if it
[46:02] can do that if it can cause a man to
[46:04] give a fourth of his money away
[46:07] a four think about that a fourth of your
[46:09] bank account would you give it away
[46:11] a woman embarrass herself in front of
[46:13] everybody and wash and kiss a man's
[46:17] dirty feet
[46:19] uh uh and and and change her from a
[46:21] prostitute life to a life of a saint if
[46:25] if that power could do that how much
[46:27] more what greater rewards lay in store
[46:30] praise god and we know there are like on
[46:32] the day of pentecost right and
[46:33] afterwards when peter raised that
[46:35] paralyzed man from the dead hey i'm
[46:36] sorry not not from the dead but raise
[46:38] them up
[46:39] onto his feet praise god
[46:41] there's so much more and god rewards
[46:44] those who seek more of it we want more
[46:47] of god's spirit
[46:50] now faith is a gift salvation is a gift
[46:53] ephesians 2 8 by grace you're saved
[46:55] through faith that not of yourself it is
[46:58] the gift of god not by works lest any
[47:02] man should boast
[47:03] so faith your faith is not earned by
[47:06] human effort but rather it's freely
[47:08] given god's with open hands he's trying
[47:10] to give it to us right it's
[47:13] it's a good news
[47:14] now romans 8 32 he that spared not his
[47:17] son but delivered him up for us all
[47:21] how shall he not with him also freely
[47:23] give us all things amen so each one of
[47:26] these attributes are freely given
[47:30] now church the struggle is the struggle
[47:32] is not god's you know like we're waiting
[47:35] for god to give us something the
[47:36] struggle is us accepting it
[47:38] right just accepting the free gift
[47:40] because the bible said he freely gives
[47:42] it but many times we've got to die out
[47:44] to these temptations and snares we're
[47:47] wrestling with with like unbelief
[47:49] hypocrisy or human reasoning
[47:52] sensuality haste irreverence selfishness
[47:56] resistance
[47:58] uh all the pride we might even say
[48:01] and so
[48:02] god is freely offering these and we've
[48:05] got to die out to our our own will
[48:08] and then accept the free gifts
[48:11] most people i know when sister wendy
[48:14] gives them a birthday gift they don't
[48:15] have any trouble receiving it i've
[48:16] hardly seen anybody ever give that back
[48:19] have as have you you have to whisper at
[48:21] your house there and ask it anybody ever
[48:23] give out those free gifts that she gives
[48:24] out so frequently
[48:26] or any gift at your birthday party or
[48:30] a work party school party most people
[48:32] are so happy to receive a gift that's
[48:35] how we should feel with god's gifts yes
[48:38] lord more faith yes lord virtue and more
[48:41] oh i need your knowledge i need to
[48:43] understand this i'll receive it
[48:45] because it comes by promise god you
[48:47] promised to send it thank you lord i
[48:49] know i'm gonna receive it i'm just
[48:50] waiting to receive it praise god
[48:53] that's the kind of attitude we should
[48:54] have because god wants to freely give it
[48:57] to us
[49:00] okay
[49:03] and then and then remember second peter
[49:05] 1 3
[49:06] his divine power has given unto us all
[49:09] things that pertain unto life and
[49:11] godliness not some things
[49:13] all things that pertain to life and
[49:15] godliness see this so we have every
[49:18] every possible
[49:19] gift divine gift you could ever want to
[49:21] receive god is freely offering it
[49:24] but we know
[49:25] as we saw on sunday god works everything
[49:27] for your good for my good and there's a
[49:30] time and season to receive all those
[49:32] gifts god has to teach us all these
[49:34] lessons we must learn all of them so
[49:37] that when we receive the gift we don't
[49:39] take it for granted
[49:40] like i was looking at that today in
[49:41] romans 11. paul said you know gentiles
[49:44] you're grafted into the vine he said
[49:46] don't boast against the branches that
[49:48] are cut off
[49:50] he said because if you don't continue in
[49:51] them you're going to be cut off
[49:53] so there's a tendency
[49:55] when we hear the message we get so
[49:57] thankful we're grafted in there's a
[49:59] tendency though to get complacent and to
[50:01] brag and feel like we're so much better
[50:03] than lutherans or methodists or
[50:05] catholics or presbyterians we've really
[50:07] got to fight against that we've really
[50:09] got to humble ourselves
[50:11] and really gotta
[50:13] find ways to serve others that's why
[50:15] bible club is a way i can serve others
[50:18] uh that maybe don't have the revelation
[50:20] we have
[50:21] uh you know
[50:22] of course preaching to our church you
[50:24] know that's a way i can serve other
[50:25] people
[50:26] making the youtube videos answering
[50:28] their emails and their texts and sending
[50:30] people free books any way we can serve
[50:33] other people
[50:34] at our expense and our sacrifice
[50:37] is a way to keep us humble so all of us
[50:39] need a ministry right all of us we've
[50:41] been looking at that over the last year
[50:43] or two
[50:44] now jesus said church it's hard to
[50:45] believe but jesus said few there be that
[50:47] find it can you imagine most people will
[50:49] take that box of rattlesnakes because
[50:51] it's pleasurable for a season they like
[50:53] to play i don't know how they could see
[50:55] that's pleasurable
[50:56] but satan must disguise it he must show
[50:58] some disguise that make it look so
[51:00] pleasurable
[51:01] that they'll take that death they'd
[51:04] rather love the unbelief
[51:06] than love faith jesus said few will find
[51:09] love for faith
[51:10] this this amazing divine gift that he
[51:13] gives
[51:17] so this is the starting place faith is a
[51:19] starting place for our spiritual journey
[51:23] before faith comes a person is lost in
[51:25] unbelief or spiritual death
[51:28] so without that anointing they're
[51:29] spiritually dead right in their souls
[51:33] ephesians 2 1 says unbelievers are dead
[51:36] in trespasses and sin well church i hope
[51:39] i get a hearty amen from your house
[51:40] praise god
[51:41] that you were dead in sins but now
[51:44] you're made alive in christ jesus amen
[51:47] dead no hope no covenant no promises no
[51:50] nothing but now we have life through
[51:53] jesus christ amen
[51:55] every every person listening to me
[51:57] should know what it feels like to be
[51:59] dead i remember being a slave to sin i
[52:02] was dead i
[52:03] hated going to church i mean i knew it
[52:05] was right but my flesh hated it and
[52:08] ran for 19 years from that
[52:11] but when i saw that six foot four man
[52:13] raised his hands at the athletes in
[52:15] action conference
[52:17] i repented of my sins it was a shame to
[52:19] myself but i found mercy i found
[52:21] forgiveness uh i i found all that i was
[52:25] looking for it all flowed down with me
[52:27] onto me from jesus's cross praise god
[52:30] that's right
[52:34] so see jesus says when you receive faith
[52:36] you passed from death
[52:38] unto life praise god
[52:40] see in heaven your name
[52:42] uh you recognize your name is there
[52:44] praise god because we know all the names
[52:46] are written before the foundation of the
[52:49] world you recognize your name is on the
[52:52] book of life
[52:53] praise god
[52:55] so faith comes when a believer rejects
[52:58] unbelief and repents of his sins
[53:02] trust in christ for forgiveness
[53:06] now in the greek repent means to change
[53:08] your mind
[53:10] for the better
[53:11] to hardly amend with abhorrence of one's
[53:14] past sins
[53:15] so we do three things you're going to
[53:16] change your mind you're going to make
[53:18] amends for your sins
[53:21] try to undo them and then hate your old
[53:24] sins
[53:26] so scripture calls this change of mind
[53:28] he calls it a turning of the heart so
[53:30] malachi and lydia
[53:32] uh that's her america and kate yo yup
[53:34] she's back okay
[53:36] so let's do lydia
[53:38] uh lydia luke 1 17.
[53:45] malachi acts 26 18. so luke 1 17 and
[53:49] acts 26 18.
[53:51] so scripture will call this repentance
[53:53] it'll call it the turning of the heart
[53:56] because the mind changes it used to
[53:58] think one way and go one direction but
[54:01] now it changes and goes a different
[54:03] direction as we know repent means to
[54:04] make a 180.
[54:07] so here's john the baptist in luke 1 17
[54:10] lydia
[54:11] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[54:13] and power of elias to turn the hearts of
[54:15] the fathers to the children and
[54:17] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[54:19] make great people prepared for the lord
[54:22] remember his message was repent repent
[54:24] so repent means to turn the heart
[54:28] your heart was uh
[54:30] grasping for the we'd say the supply of
[54:33] the devil right uh his pleasures and his
[54:35] cares of the world but now you grasp for
[54:38] the su now you're you're going in the
[54:39] direction of god's supplies god's
[54:42] spiritual goods amen thank god
[54:45] malachi acts 26 18 this is about the
[54:48] apostle paul
[54:49] turning people turning their hearts
[54:52] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[54:54] darkness to light and from the power of
[54:56] satan unto god that they may receive
[54:58] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[55:00] among them which are sanctified by faith
[55:02] that is in me
[55:03] praise god so paul was trying to turn
[55:05] them from the darkness to light
[55:10] and that was his commission there from
[55:13] the lord jesus himself praise god
[55:16] so so now you'll see you know now the
[55:18] bible will make a lot more sense as you
[55:21] see the turning of the hearts
[55:24] right the turning of the hearts of the
[55:26] fathers to the children
[55:30] now both jesus and
[55:32] john the baptist their first message
[55:34] they preached was repentance why because
[55:36] that's the foundation that's your
[55:38] starting spot that's where you start
[55:40] following the leadership of the holy
[55:42] spirit or the pillar of fire mark 1 4
[55:45] says john did baptize in the wilderness
[55:47] and preach the baptism of repentance for
[55:50] the remission of sins praise god
[55:54] and then mark 1 14-15 says now after
[55:57] that john was put in prison jesus came
[55:59] into galilee preaching the gospel the
[56:01] kingdom of god and saying that time is
[56:04] fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at
[56:06] hand repent ye and believe the gospel
[56:09] praise god so even god
[56:11] god himself god manifests in the flesh
[56:14] the mystery of godliness he didn't he
[56:16] didn't start preaching where it was way
[56:18] too high over people's head he started
[56:20] right where they were at he said repent
[56:22] for the kingdom of god is at hand it is
[56:25] time for you to repent praise god
[56:28] thank you jesus
[56:32] so jesus says repent he says the gospel
[56:36] and believe the gospel which is the good
[56:38] news
[56:39] that we can be forgiven of all of our
[56:40] sins and become part of god's kingdom
[56:43] jesus says i came to i came not to call
[56:46] the righteous but sinners to repentance
[56:49] praise god oh church have you heard
[56:51] god's call amen most of us have praise
[56:54] god but i know i'm preaching the little
[56:55] children i know i'm preaching to people
[56:57] that will watch it later on the archives
[56:59] and people that may think they're saved
[57:01] and they may not be saved
[57:03] they may be make believers
[57:06] and this is why they struggle so much
[57:08] with living the message because they
[57:09] never really received genuine faith it
[57:12] was never the genuine faith of god
[57:15] uh the supply of faith that produced uh
[57:18] the fruits of repentance right like john
[57:20] said bring forth fruits
[57:22] meat or worthy of repentance
[57:28] praise god so jesus has called us to
[57:31] repentance praise god
[57:33] now at the very moment a person gets
[57:36] saved the anointing of the holy spirit
[57:38] comes drops down a very small anointing
[57:41] into their soul
[57:42] and it's called faith praise god
[57:45] it has to be
[57:46] because you have three parts to your
[57:48] being you have a body human spirit and
[57:51] soul
[57:53] remember uh peter said that lot was a
[57:56] righteous soul
[57:58] all right the bible said how abraham was
[58:02] justified by faith
[58:05] and his soul was saved we know so
[58:07] there's numerous scriptures where people
[58:09] in the old testament are described as
[58:11] being righteous having righteous souls
[58:14] so that has to be a small anointing in
[58:17] the soul
[58:19] it's a faith
[58:21] substance
[58:22] praise god
[58:24] and you get new life when that comes in
[58:27] faith comes in as new life prior to
[58:30] faith remember you used to walk
[58:32] according to the course of this world
[58:34] according to the prince and power of the
[58:36] air the spirit that worketh in the
[58:39] children of disobedience
[58:42] all right
[58:43] so see we used to be anointed to work
[58:46] for satan's kingdom and walk in satan's
[58:49] paths but when you have faith now you
[58:51] change your path you don't walk in the
[58:53] path of darkness you're not anointed
[58:55] with demons anymore you're anointed with
[58:57] faith and it causes you to keep god's
[58:59] commands and walk in the light as he's
[59:02] in the light
[59:04] praise god
[59:08] so let's look at these two examples
[59:10] briefly zacchaeus
[59:12] and the woman the sinner who became a
[59:14] saint at simon's house
[59:18] two examples capture the very moment
[59:21] faith anoints their souls praise god
[59:24] it's beautiful
[59:26] so after zacchaeus learned that jesus
[59:28] was coming to his house
[59:31] and
[59:32] right there jesus we remember called up
[59:35] to him and said i'm coming to your house
[59:36] today zacchaeus
[59:39] and he says he said lord he said if i've
[59:41] done anything wrong i'll restore it
[59:43] fourfold
[59:44] right so four times the amount i stole
[59:47] i'll give it back praise god i think he
[59:49] said half my goods i give to the poor is
[59:51] that right
[59:52] so i think i said a fourth earlier i
[59:54] think he said a half
[59:56] he would give half of his bank account
[59:58] praise god and then give people four
[1:00:00] times the amount he stole
[1:00:02] back
[1:00:05] and i love what jesus said jesus didn't
[1:00:07] say yesterday or next week jesus said
[1:00:10] this day
[1:00:11] he said salvation has come to this house
[1:00:15] for as much as he also is a son of
[1:00:17] abraham for the son of man has come to
[1:00:20] seek and save that which is lost praise
[1:00:23] god aren't you glad that jesus seeks out
[1:00:26] your life uh no matter if you're up high
[1:00:29] in a tree right or you're down in a
[1:00:31] ditch or you're off in the uh you're the
[1:00:33] pig pen of the world jesus will come
[1:00:35] find you praise god he seeks and saves
[1:00:38] that he just had to walk by that
[1:00:40] particular oak tree right uh not oak
[1:00:42] tree
[1:00:44] sycamore tree
[1:00:45] he had a walk right by that sycamore
[1:00:47] tree right down that street he was led
[1:00:49] by the holy spirit he after he had to
[1:00:52] seek out that little lamb he left the 99
[1:00:54] pharisees right to go get that lamb
[1:00:56] praise god
[1:01:00] so see church you and i can know the
[1:01:03] very day
[1:01:04] that we received faith
[1:01:07] because jesus said
[1:01:09] zacchaeus knew this day
[1:01:11] salvation came praise god salvation was
[1:01:13] already written in heaven right but the
[1:01:15] reality of it came and the anointing of
[1:01:18] salvation came on that day and zacchaeus
[1:01:20] received it praise god that anointing of
[1:01:23] faith
[1:01:27] now let's look at this woman at simon's
[1:01:29] house now we're not going to read all
[1:01:30] this of course but in luke 7 35-50
[1:01:34] a sincere repentant woman called a
[1:01:36] sinner she found salvation
[1:01:42] at jesus christ's feet
[1:01:45] praise god what a what a perfect place
[1:01:46] to find it amen
[1:01:48] and she washed jesus feet with her tears
[1:01:51] her faith moved her to do this
[1:01:54] and anoint jesus feet
[1:01:56] and
[1:01:56] then wash it with her hair and then
[1:01:58] jesus pronounced her and said thy faith
[1:02:02] has saved thee
[1:02:04] go in peace notice she didn't save
[1:02:06] herself it was that supply of faith
[1:02:09] right because it's a gift of god
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:13] now this next part i'm going to skip is
[1:02:14] just on water baptism but most of us
[1:02:16] know just like john when john saw faith
[1:02:20] anoint people's hearts he said get him
[1:02:22] to the water to be baptized we know the
[1:02:23] same thing happened with philip and the
[1:02:25] eunuch as soon as eunuch believed he
[1:02:27] said get into the water and be baptized
[1:02:29] faith has entered into your heart
[1:02:31] so go do the natural act and prove in
[1:02:34] the natural what's already happened in
[1:02:35] the spiritual praise god
[1:02:42] of course we see acts chapter 2 3 000
[1:02:45] people
[1:02:46] coming uh into the church now we don't
[1:02:48] know if they're born again or not the
[1:02:50] bible just said three thousand words
[1:02:51] three thousand souls were added that day
[1:03:00] now i did put a little section in here
[1:03:02] here let me uh
[1:03:07] let me just go over this real quick
[1:03:08] again
[1:03:09] um
[1:03:11] staying in the book of acts when people
[1:03:13] got saved they first had to hear the bad
[1:03:15] news
[1:03:16] in order to ex to realize the good news
[1:03:20] right so peter on the day of pentecost
[1:03:22] he gets drunk with the holy ghost praise
[1:03:25] god he's praising the lord he stands up
[1:03:28] there and said this is not what you
[1:03:29] think it is
[1:03:30] it's spiritual wine
[1:03:32] now his preaching is so powerful
[1:03:37] he first says it's not wine it's new
[1:03:40] it's not new wine it's spiritual
[1:03:42] anointing then his very next point is to
[1:03:46] indict
[1:03:47] the multitudes wicked act
[1:03:50] of delivering
[1:03:52] christ
[1:03:54] to be crucified
[1:03:55] so what would that look like today it's
[1:03:57] like when amen came to church you know
[1:03:59] and came up to the altar i spent that
[1:04:01] whole sermon rebuking sin telling the
[1:04:04] bad news
[1:04:05] right that churches and denominations
[1:04:07] were of the devil and and they allow you
[1:04:09] to they give you a license for sin i
[1:04:11] spent that whole sermon telling the bad
[1:04:12] news and then i threw out the net for
[1:04:14] with good news praise god if you want to
[1:04:16] be free here's the you want to be
[1:04:18] delivered from that here's the net come
[1:04:20] come join god's kingdom hallelujah and
[1:04:23] amen responded six people came up right
[1:04:26] i remember that day six one of them
[1:04:28] stayed
[1:04:29] looks like the five might have went back
[1:04:30] we're not sure only god knows
[1:04:33] but see you had to hear the bad news
[1:04:35] first
[1:04:36] and then
[1:04:37] after that
[1:04:40] he quotes psalms where jesus is the
[1:04:43] messiah god would raise from the dead
[1:04:45] psalm 16 david was not speaking of
[1:04:48] himself
[1:04:49] and then he makes himself he said i'm a
[1:04:51] witness of this
[1:04:53] jesus raised and uh the events of the
[1:04:56] the resurrection
[1:04:58] and he said now the events of today on
[1:05:00] day of pentecost were the promise of the
[1:05:02] holy ghost
[1:05:04] and he concludes it by declaring that
[1:05:06] the house of israel he said that god has
[1:05:08] made this jesus both lord and christ
[1:05:10] amen he's both the lord and the christ
[1:05:13] the anointed one so god has become man
[1:05:16] god god is manifest in the flesh praise
[1:05:19] god what a way to end it with the
[1:05:21] godhead praise god
[1:05:23] and that was enough
[1:05:25] he had to preach bad news said i'm a
[1:05:27] witness i know what i know what's
[1:05:29] happened i'm a witness of this
[1:05:31] and then he ends with the godhead
[1:05:35] and over 3 000 people right 3 000 people
[1:05:38] heard the bad news
[1:05:40] they knew they were guilty
[1:05:43] and so that's what preaching real
[1:05:44] preaching has to tell you what you're
[1:05:46] guilty of
[1:05:49] and then let you know the innocent
[1:05:51] messiah died in your place
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:05:55] and
[1:05:56] you spent your life rejecting the savior
[1:05:59] but the good news is that jesus took
[1:06:02] your sin upon him paid the sin debt that
[1:06:05] you owed and defeated death by
[1:06:08] resurrecting and is now at the right
[1:06:10] hand of god and now he's pouring out his
[1:06:13] holy spirit upon believers praise god
[1:06:15] this news was so powerful it convicted 3
[1:06:18] 000 people from 17 different nations the
[1:06:21] bible said it prick their hearts
[1:06:24] in church if we go too long at services
[1:06:27] and our hearts not pricked we are
[1:06:29] backslidden
[1:06:30] we should always have that prick it's a
[1:06:32] sorrowful prick in the greek means
[1:06:34] sorrowful or agitated i see it on
[1:06:36] people's faces all the time
[1:06:39] right you may see it on mine when i'm
[1:06:41] when i'm convicted we when you're
[1:06:43] pricked you get agitated you're
[1:06:45] uncomfortable
[1:06:47] and it also means you're pained in your
[1:06:49] mind so you're
[1:06:51] you're not settled in your mind
[1:06:53] things are uh nerve-wracking right you
[1:06:55] can't get peace in your mind that's what
[1:06:57] pricked in their hearts meant
[1:07:03] so see bad news really hurts
[1:07:06] but it causes you to seek deliverance
[1:07:09] now you either run to the box of snakes
[1:07:12] right drugs alcohol
[1:07:14] sexual immorality uh tv movies
[1:07:18] entertainment uh money spending things
[1:07:21] shopping sprees chocolate right
[1:07:24] mcdonald's freeze
[1:07:25] whatever people whatever they do to try
[1:07:27] to escape the conviction to escape the
[1:07:30] pricking of their heart
[1:07:31] or
[1:07:32] you can say like they did peter what
[1:07:35] shall we do or you can come to the
[1:07:37] author and say preacher i know what i
[1:07:39] must do help me to do pray for me so i
[1:07:41] can do what i know i must do praise god
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:46] that walking on water apostle peter he
[1:07:48] gave him the church's first and only
[1:07:50] creed
[1:07:51] acts 2 38 repent be baptized every one
[1:07:54] of you in the name of jesus christ for
[1:07:56] the remission of sins and ye shall
[1:07:58] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:07:59] praise god if the church ever had a
[1:08:02] creed but abraham said that was the
[1:08:03] creed of the church acts 2 38
[1:08:06] and 39
[1:08:08] now notice faith came after
[1:08:10] god's word convicts us
[1:08:13] of being guilty sinners
[1:08:15] we must admit our guilt
[1:08:18] and turn from our hopeless and wicked
[1:08:20] state
[1:08:21] which is called repentance and desire to
[1:08:24] trust in jesus christ for complete
[1:08:27] forgiveness this is the pattern that
[1:08:29] worked two thousand years ago it's a
[1:08:31] pattern that works today praise god
[1:08:34] hallelujah
[1:08:36] now i'll probably
[1:08:38] lord willing i'll try to uh get a couple
[1:08:40] more thoughts before i close here
[1:08:43] it's already 10 after eight maybe go
[1:08:45] about 20 more minutes by god's grace
[1:08:49] i really want to hone in on this uh
[1:08:51] story i want to get back now to that
[1:08:52] woman
[1:08:53] uh
[1:08:54] at simon's house that found forgiveness
[1:08:56] i kind of want to get ready so turn if
[1:08:58] you get your bibles here briefly here
[1:09:04] okay can you get luke 747
[1:09:09] we'll start with luke 747.
[1:09:11] now i want to use her as an example
[1:09:13] again to what i what i showed
[1:09:15] uh last wednesday i kind of brought it
[1:09:17] back
[1:09:21] every person's decision is based upon
[1:09:23] love love is the very beginning of every
[1:09:26] decision
[1:09:29] jesus said they love darkness the
[1:09:31] condemnation came because they love
[1:09:33] darkness
[1:09:35] and then maokai can you get galatians 5
[1:09:38] 6.
[1:09:40] i just want to prove this again by the
[1:09:42] scripture the church every decision you
[1:09:44] make and i make is based upon love
[1:09:47] either agape love obedience by the
[1:09:50] spirit of god
[1:09:51] or filio love human
[1:09:54] love which is a perverted love it's not
[1:09:55] a faithful love it's a selfish love
[1:10:03] so by watching this woman
[1:10:06] you can uh unveil the origin
[1:10:09] of the order of all works
[1:10:13] they start with love
[1:10:15] then faith then works
[1:10:20] okay so occasionally you read luke 4 i'm
[1:10:22] sorry luke 7 47 second
[1:10:25] wherefore i say unto thee her sins which
[1:10:28] are many are forgiven for she loved much
[1:10:32] but to the rumor little is forgiven the
[1:10:35] same love is little
[1:10:37] praise god
[1:10:39] now notice she was forgiven because she
[1:10:41] chose to love so you have to do
[1:10:44] something to be forgiven you have to
[1:10:46] love righteousness you have to love the
[1:10:48] truth praise god she couldn't be
[1:10:49] forgiven until she loved christ first
[1:10:52] love the gift
[1:10:54] the gift of faith
[1:10:56] uh malachi uh galatians 5 6.
[1:11:01] for in jesus christ neither circumcision
[1:11:04] avail if anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:11:07] faith
[1:11:08] faith which worketh by love
[1:11:10] absolute bible proof
[1:11:13] faith works
[1:11:16] so faith is first then works but before
[1:11:18] faith is love
[1:11:20] right
[1:11:21] faith works by love such
[1:11:24] beautiful uh scripture as my just it
[1:11:27] just amazes me every time i read this
[1:11:29] that god unveils
[1:11:31] the very
[1:11:33] uh purpose of everyone's heart it's love
[1:11:35] they either love the things of god or
[1:11:37] they love the things of the world and
[1:11:39] will be judged accordingly right
[1:11:47] so this forgiven woman first loved jesus
[1:11:51] christ
[1:11:52] which helped her receive faith
[1:11:54] then her faith went to work
[1:11:57] because faith works by love
[1:12:01] so let me go through this quickly
[1:12:03] so where did she get love i we don't
[1:12:05] know church but i'm guessing in her
[1:12:07] sinful state somehow she learned about
[1:12:09] jesus she heard that sweet name jesus or
[1:12:12] a rabbi
[1:12:14] the young rabbi
[1:12:16] uh
[1:12:17] and she must have went and watched him
[1:12:20] preach she maybe she watched him do
[1:12:22] miracles
[1:12:23] uh maybe
[1:12:25] maybe she saw great godly miracles maybe
[1:12:28] people in her family or maybe uh
[1:12:31] you know
[1:12:32] she saw great things or maybe she just
[1:12:34] heard right faith cometh by hearing
[1:12:37] maybe someone just gave a testimony that
[1:12:39] they were forgiven and baptized and
[1:12:40] saved and
[1:12:42] and uh
[1:12:43] and just shared it with her but somehow
[1:12:45] she fell deeply in love with jesus
[1:12:47] christ for his godly character amen
[1:12:54] and not just a little bit because jesus
[1:12:56] said she didn't love a little bit
[1:12:58] she loved much
[1:13:00] do you love jesus very much hallelujah
[1:13:02] do we love jesus very much
[1:13:04] i want jesus to say that about me jesse
[1:13:06] was a man that loved me much praise god
[1:13:09] not just a little not just a little bit
[1:13:12] of love for the message but love the
[1:13:13] message the word of god vindicated
[1:13:16] scripturally authenticated today that's
[1:13:18] the message what god is doing right now
[1:13:21] in the word of god
[1:13:25] jesse is forgiven because he loved much
[1:13:28] oh i that just makes my heart rejoice
[1:13:30] praise god put your name in there you're
[1:13:32] forgiven because you love much
[1:13:36] see it starts with love
[1:13:38] we got to hear a story about jesus we
[1:13:39] got to see jesus do a miracle right to
[1:13:42] see jesus do something
[1:13:44] hear about him the goodness of god right
[1:13:46] the goodness of god
[1:13:47] lepens hear about his goodness
[1:13:50] and that causes us i love that person i
[1:13:53] love this god and any god that would do
[1:13:55] this any god that would save me or spare
[1:13:57] me i love this god
[1:14:03] now because she loved
[1:14:06] she received faith
[1:14:08] because faith works by love
[1:14:13] she had faith she could be forgiven of
[1:14:15] her many sins no doubt she met other
[1:14:16] people saw their people uh receiving
[1:14:19] forgiveness of sins and she saw herself
[1:14:22] as a sin debtor because that's how jesus
[1:14:25] described her condition
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:29] she was forgiven much right
[1:14:31] so she had a huge sin debt
[1:14:35] so her faith in christ moved her to
[1:14:38] prepare to do the work of washing and
[1:14:41] anointing jesus feet we know she bought
[1:14:43] a very expensive aller alabaster box of
[1:14:46] anointment
[1:14:47] or ointment rather to
[1:14:49] brought it to simon's house
[1:14:51] and waited for the right moment to start
[1:14:54] working praise god
[1:14:56] so because she loved she went and sold
[1:14:58] uh
[1:14:59] you know all she had or maybe just took
[1:15:01] her money rather and bought the ointment
[1:15:03] and she waited to do the work church
[1:15:05] that's what we just have to do wait to
[1:15:07] do god's work
[1:15:09] just have just be so full of the love of
[1:15:11] god and just wait until someone needs
[1:15:13] you to pray for them or wait till
[1:15:14] someone needs you to give them some food
[1:15:16] or clothes just be so full of the love
[1:15:18] of god with faith in your heart say in
[1:15:20] your god i know you're gonna use me here
[1:15:22] i am lord i'm just waiting help me to be
[1:15:24] ready praise god and then at that moment
[1:15:26] when you see it it's time that's the
[1:15:28] time to go to work and she just didn't
[1:15:31] do a little half job she really did an
[1:15:33] awesome work job praise god
[1:15:35] because as soon as she gets there jesus
[1:15:37] feet or she starts crying and weeping
[1:15:41] and she uses those tears to wash jesus's
[1:15:44] feet with her long uncut hair what was
[1:15:46] it bob's hair
[1:15:48] it was long
[1:15:49] uncut hair then she starts kissing his
[1:15:51] feet
[1:15:53] and anointing them with ointment
[1:15:56] and then jesus
[1:15:58] tells her what she wants to hear
[1:16:00] he says thy faith has saved you praise
[1:16:03] god
[1:16:05] jesus always sees works
[1:16:09] as faith in action right jesus jesus
[1:16:12] wasn't looking and saying oh boy she's
[1:16:13] really earning this with her works jesus
[1:16:15] saw his faith jesus said she's she's
[1:16:18] expressing her faith and that's what we
[1:16:20] do with our works our works are an
[1:16:23] expression of our faith
[1:16:25] that's what jesus told
[1:16:27] the men that lay that brought that pal
[1:16:30] uh palsy stricken man down through
[1:16:32] peter's roof remember luke 5
[1:16:35] says
[1:16:36] and when jesus saw their faith he said
[1:16:38] unto man man thy sins are forgiven thee
[1:16:41] praise god
[1:16:43] he saw their faith faith is always an
[1:16:46] action faith is always a work
[1:16:49] in fact we know james 2 says without
[1:16:51] faith uh without works your faith is
[1:16:54] dead we don't want dead dormant faith we
[1:16:56] want living faith praise god we want
[1:16:58] faith that people can see we want faith
[1:17:01] that that jesus sees as our works that
[1:17:04] are done for his glory
[1:17:07] praise god let me bring this down to
[1:17:09] close here
[1:17:10] so remember christians are not saved by
[1:17:12] works
[1:17:13] ephesians 2 8 but once saved christians
[1:17:18] recognize god created us to do good
[1:17:21] works
[1:17:22] so uh
[1:17:24] lydia can you get
[1:17:25] ephesians 2 10 for lydia
[1:17:29] see this forgiven woman she was created
[1:17:32] to wash jesus feet amen she was created
[1:17:35] to kiss those feet she was created to
[1:17:38] wash those feet the men couldn't do it
[1:17:40] right the woman had to do with her long
[1:17:42] hair she was created to do that oh
[1:17:45] church let's find what god created us to
[1:17:47] do and let's be so willing to do it
[1:17:49] let's be so full of love waiting to do
[1:17:51] it that we can't wait for the moment and
[1:17:54] then when the moment comes we'll jump at
[1:17:56] the chance
[1:17:57] and we'll do a love work for jesus
[1:17:59] christ
[1:18:01] uh ephesians 2 10.
[1:18:03] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:18:06] christ jesus unto good works which god
[1:18:08] hath before ordained that we should walk
[1:18:10] in them
[1:18:11] praise god
[1:18:13] see before she could do this she had to
[1:18:14] fall in love with jesus
[1:18:16] in church some of you might be created
[1:18:18] uh
[1:18:18] to fast and pray
[1:18:20] to dance around the church
[1:18:23] right to cry at the altar to scream and
[1:18:25] praise god and cast out demons or
[1:18:27] something
[1:18:29] but you got to be so first so full of
[1:18:31] the love of god that you're just ready
[1:18:34] and waiting and willing and then when
[1:18:36] god tells you it's time that's the time
[1:18:38] to do it
[1:18:39] praise god so once full of love for him
[1:18:42] her faith went to work just like ours
[1:18:44] should do as well
[1:18:49] now in closing this section here
[1:18:53] so now faith versus works remember that
[1:18:55] good old debate that age-old argument
[1:18:58] it should be settled is it sound in your
[1:19:00] heart is it faith or works
[1:19:02] well it's faith that works by love
[1:19:06] right
[1:19:07] it has to start with love
[1:19:10] because faith works by love
[1:19:14] church you and i are saved by god's
[1:19:16] amazing grace
[1:19:19] and this experience of salvation begins
[1:19:23] when your heart
[1:19:25] starts loving god
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:28] and this love produces faith
[1:19:31] in his eternal word
[1:19:33] and then faith motivated by love works
[1:19:35] out god's plan for your life
[1:19:39] and then genuine works of obedience
[1:19:42] always originate with a loving heart
[1:19:45] that receives god's supply of faith in
[1:19:47] the soul
[1:19:50] see that that loving heart just says yes
[1:19:51] lord i love faith i love virtue
[1:19:54] i love knowledge i love temperance and
[1:19:57] godliness and praise patience and
[1:19:59] brotherly kindness and charity i love
[1:20:02] the gifts of god so we've got to start
[1:20:04] with love when we don't love the
[1:20:06] preaching of god's word something's
[1:20:08] wrong we don't love sing along with
[1:20:10] brother amen or the song special
[1:20:12] something's wrong
[1:20:13] we got to love it
[1:20:15] if we don't love it we're not going to
[1:20:17] receive anything
[1:20:20] so church it all goes back
[1:20:22] to love
[1:20:23] how many at home want to love the lord
[1:20:24] your god with all your heart soul mind
[1:20:26] and strength how many want to love him
[1:20:28] with all your effort tonight
[1:20:30] let's stand by god's grace so stop a
[1:20:32] little bit early there about just about
[1:20:34] 50 minutes
[1:20:35] of the sermon
[1:20:44] i love him i love him
[1:20:56] oh church i hope
[1:20:58] hope the word was a blessing to you
[1:20:59] tonight i know i've got children
[1:21:01] listening i've got people that
[1:21:03] struggle with their salvation
[1:21:05] like i told you i went to
[1:21:07] a church last fall and
[1:21:09] 50 or 60 year old saint what i thought
[1:21:11] was a
[1:21:12] saint comes crying weeping at the altar
[1:21:15] saying i don't even know if i'm saved
[1:21:18] sat in a message church
[1:21:20] their entire life
[1:21:22] if we don't catch these foundational
[1:21:24] things we'll never
[1:21:27] we'll never get to cadis barnia right
[1:21:30] if we don't cross through that red sea
[1:21:32] and really know i went through the red
[1:21:33] sea with the love of god in my heart
[1:21:38] there'll be questions later on let's
[1:21:40] settle it tonight if it's not settled in
[1:21:42] your heart tonight that you love god
[1:21:44] settle it

[1:22:03] take all your guilt and shame away
[1:22:05] praise god that's the one to fall in
[1:22:06] love with praise god don't fall in love
