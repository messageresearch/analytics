[43:10] God best use being seated there praise
[43:11] God this is part 4 here in the the
[43:19] wisdom series by the grace of the Lord
[43:23] so we'd like to look at the proverbs 31
[43:26] woman I've never preached on proverbs 31
[43:28] woman so this is new to me I'm sure over
[43:30] the years maybe you've heard different
[43:32] sermons on it I I never have I'm always
[43:34] been preaching most of my life so or
[43:36] most of my Christian life so it's the
[43:38] first time I preached it so looking
[43:40] forward to this message we read our text
[43:42] here and just let you know I'm still
[43:44] praying about you know the future series
[43:46] I like to look I look I'd like to preach
[43:47] the whole life of Jesus Christ of
[43:49] Nazareth I like to preach his whole life
[43:50] I'm praying about that like to do a
[43:52] leadership I like to do some rebuttals
[43:54] on the believe the sign false
[43:57] interpretations and so forth I like to
[44:00] preach a series on finding your purpose
[44:02] in life I like to preach that so we're
[44:04] thankful we finished the church age book
[44:05] 68 sermons on the church ages and that
[44:08] was a real blessing and we started Cleo
[44:10] we have started a series on prayer on
[44:11] Wednesday night feeding is a chance to
[44:13] hear that for the home church I think
[44:16] that'd be a blessing to you and also we
[44:18] started wisdom I still want to go back
[44:19] and finish my David series and book a
[44:21] revelation series and the Paul's Gospels
[44:24] so I still keep track of those and just
[44:26] trying to find the leadership of the
[44:28] Lord so let's look at a few just reviews
[44:31] from the first sermon I preached in this
[44:33] series the
[44:34] first and last chapters of Proverbs are
[44:36] very inspired of course all of it is but
[44:38] for us it's a it's a further inspiration
[44:41] we'd say a further revelation than most
[44:43] people can receive because we know the
[44:45] message of the hour by God's grace so
[44:48] chapter one begins with a plea to
[44:50] receive we'd say the seeds of wisdom
[44:52] from a king to his son it's from the
[44:55] King Solomon to his son which is
[44:57] probably rare boom but it could be you
[44:59] know another son and in this chapter
[45:02] wisdom is symbolic the Bible calls her a
[45:05] lady she's crying out in the street
[45:07] she's just crying for anyone well anyone
[45:09] here wisdom if there's anyone that wants
[45:11] to know the truth of God's Word and
[45:13] she's just crying out you know and so
[45:15] chapter 1 lays in the seeds of God's
[45:17] Word now in chapter 31 as we're gonna
[45:21] look at this morning we'll practic a
[45:22] couple sermons on a chapter xxxi woman
[45:26] but in chapter 31 we see the fruit or
[45:29] the result of living a life of wisdom
[45:33] from another king because we started
[45:35] with solomon now this could be our look
[45:39] at this this morning - it could be from
[45:40] another king or actually could be
[45:41] solomon himself and I'll share a little
[45:43] bit about that just a moment from his
[45:46] mother so we end of the book the book
[45:48] begins with a king - his son the book
[45:51] ends with a king sharing the wisdom
[45:54] about what a real woman looks like from
[45:57] his mother the wisdom he learned from
[45:59] his mother so wisdom is now in the flesh
[46:02] it's no longer symbolic and so the word
[46:06] has become flesh how many want that for
[46:09] your life I want the word to become
[46:12] flesh so at the end of my life I'm fully
[46:15] manifesting all of the word that God
[46:18] would have me to fulfill praise the Lord
[46:20] but it starts like in chapter when it
[46:22] starts with crying out you know she
[46:24] wisdom is crying out will anybody here
[46:26] so it starts with us humbling ourselves
[46:28] and coming to lady wisdom to receive of
[46:33] her spirit which is we know is only one
[46:35] spirit the holy spirit praise God and
[46:37] then by the end of the book the word
[46:40] becomes flesh and we see what wisdom
[46:43] produces in a woman's life amen and of
[46:47] course by then
[46:48] look at this poem you know chapter 31 is
[46:50] a poem verses 10 to 31 is actually a
[46:53] poem and it's called an acrostic it's
[46:57] alphabetical a cross stick which we'll
[46:59] get to in a moment as well because each
[47:01] letter uses a different I'm sorry each
[47:03] scripture uses a different letter and
[47:04] uses all the letters of the Hebrew
[47:06] alphabet which is I think pretty
[47:08] inspired while share I'll share why in
[47:10] just a moment
[47:11] now the importance of proverbs 31 to us
[47:13] if we are the wise virgins our lives
[47:18] should be centered around wisdom
[47:19] including that of Proverbs we know
[47:22] there's going to be foolish virgins we
[47:24] know there's going to be wise virgins
[47:25] but we want to be the wise virgins amen
[47:28] and this book majors on wise why is the
[47:31] lie son the wise King the wise woman it
[47:33] majors on what a wise person lives like
[47:36] so if anybody should want to read
[47:38] proverbs and manifest proverbs it ought
[47:41] to be us if we're wise virgins amen we
[47:44] should not be foolish and well that's
[47:46] just another book of the Bible you know
[47:47] we know how books are inspired we know
[47:49] we know where a full word bride but we
[47:51] should especially manifest the wisdom
[47:53] that got his place in the scriptures for
[47:55] us amen
[47:56] so remember chapter 1 began with a
[47:58] symbolic lady wisdom seeking to pour out
[48:01] her spirit chapter 31 ends with a look
[48:04] at a woman who's manifested the spirit
[48:07] and now she's the Word made flesh so
[48:09] goes from symbolic to flesh or from from
[48:12] spiritual to flesh it comes into flesh
[48:15] now the climax or culmination of
[48:18] proverbs this is the very climax of
[48:20] proverbs is this mature fruitful rare
[48:24] woman of wisdom it's so hard to find a
[48:27] proverbs 31 woman hey can the brothers
[48:29] and sisters say men it's so hard to find
[48:32] a man who's virtuous as well we know
[48:36] Psalm is that is harder to find a woman
[48:37] but that's you know Ecclesiastes chapter
[48:40] 7 but that was in his day of course that
[48:44] was in his day so but this is all a type
[48:48] so the book builds to a climax and the
[48:51] climax is this mature woman who's so
[48:53] rare she's so godly she's so holy that
[48:58] she's the very climax she's the very
[49:00] embody
[49:01] of wisdom and that is a type of how the
[49:05] Gentile age climax in a word bride amen
[49:09] the Gentile bride who is just like
[49:12] Christ at Christ's coming like the
[49:14] pyramid symbol she has to fit that last
[49:17] headstone piece perfectly and that's how
[49:20] the bride of Jesus Christ will be at the
[49:22] time of the rapture her life will be
[49:24] just like Christ's life amen
[49:26] it has to because that's the Vettes the
[49:28] symbol God gives us Christ is the
[49:31] cornerstone Christ is the headstone amen
[49:33] that's the symbol that we're given our
[49:35] lives have to look just like Christ and
[49:38] I want to be first to lie and say Lord
[49:40] mold my life change my life
[49:43] can victim or like Christ Jesus amen
[49:47] I've got I've got area to grow I've got
[49:50] I got I've got faith that can rise amen
[49:52] I've got more potentials that are not
[49:54] tapped into yet and help me to tap into
[49:57] the potentials of the Holy Spirit
[49:59] and what will that look like more death
[50:01] to self amen more crucifying the flesh
[50:05] and the affections and lusts thereof
[50:08] more of Christ less of me now let's look
[50:14] at the origin this is what I was
[50:15] mentioning earlier this chapter seems so
[50:17] inspired I think if we if we dig a
[50:19] little deeper by the grace of the Lord
[50:22] look at the origin of this chapter and
[50:24] let's get the author in the background
[50:26] King Lemuel is mentioned as the author
[50:31] it's in verse 1 the words of King Lemuel
[50:34] he's mentioned nowhere else in Scripture
[50:37] and he's the one that wrote or had this
[50:40] prophetic chapter written down and you
[50:42] know this chapter was a prophecy the
[50:45] Bible calls it a prophecy look at verse
[50:46] 1 the words of King Lemuel the prophecy
[50:49] that his mother taught at home I just
[50:52] struck me
[50:53] that's prophetic of you and I'm an
[50:55] Alleluia that's prophetic of the mature
[50:59] bride of Jesus Christ it just struck me
[51:01] I was as I was just thinking how it was
[51:03] prophetic of Solomon but this is
[51:05] prophetic of us amen this is a prophecy
[51:09] that a godly mother taught her son that
[51:13] was going to be King one day
[51:16] hallelujah now who is lemuel there's two
[51:19] thoughts on this first one of the
[51:22] commentary said he's probably a heathen
[51:24] king who was a proselyte into Judaism
[51:28] that's what one commentator says I don't
[51:30] side with that one I'm with this other
[51:32] side I'll get to in a moment but I can
[51:34] be wrong I mean no one really knows for
[51:35] sure but if you notice though his
[51:38] lineage is not even listed okay now a
[51:42] ger who wrote and compiled chapter 30
[51:46] his lineage was at least listed where at
[51:49] least told who his father was
[51:51] he's the son of Jacob looks like in
[51:53] chapter 30 verse 1 so this Lemuel is a
[51:56] very strange character in Scripture he's
[52:00] not listening as having any father or
[52:02] mother you know you don't have any
[52:03] lineage you know it's really striking
[52:05] you know like a type of Christ or
[52:06] something like that
[52:07] which we know Solomon was a type of
[52:09] Christ the Son of David so the second
[52:13] idea is that Lemuel is a nickname for a
[52:16] very famous Israeli King and this is
[52:20] what I believe if you look in the
[52:22] Strong's Concordance this is Hebrew
[52:25] number thirty-nine 27 Lemuel means
[52:27] belonging to God and it's symbolic of
[52:32] the name of Solomon so it's very
[52:36] possible and some scholars really they
[52:37] cite on either side some say this is
[52:39] just a you know a proselyte King because
[52:43] really why would the Jews put some
[52:44] heathen King in their book of wisdom you
[52:46] know saw the Bible said solomon compound
[52:49] had 3000 of verses of wisdom and were
[52:52] compiled and we he all compiled it wrote
[52:55] it down and that's where we got the Book
[52:57] of Proverbs but to me it seems very
[53:00] likely that Lemuel is actually a
[53:03] nickname for Solomon that's what it
[53:04] seems like to me because the name Lemuel
[53:07] means belonging to God Solomon means
[53:10] peace Salman also has a nickname means
[53:14] beloved of Jehovah Jedediah means
[53:18] beloved of Jehovah according to second
[53:21] Samuel 1225 so God loves Solomon let me
[53:25] know that
[53:26] and notice in Solomon's earlier years he
[53:30] loved God he loved wisdom so the Bible
[53:35] said that he was beloved of your over
[53:38] love Solomon because God looked down
[53:40] through time and said this boy is gonna
[53:42] love my word he is gonna love my wisdom
[53:46] I know I know later on when he's older
[53:48] he's gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna offer him
[53:50] anything and he's going to turn down
[53:52] riches and he's gonna turn down kingdoms
[53:54] and the armies he's going to turn all
[53:56] that down just to have the wisdom to
[53:58] judge my people the right way amen God
[54:01] love somebody that wants to treat his
[54:02] his people the right way amen God loves
[54:06] preachers I don't treat the bride the
[54:08] right way praise the Lord Amen because
[54:12] look what the Bible said the Bible said
[54:15] he called his name Solomon and the Lord
[54:16] loved him then his name he called
[54:18] Jedediah and now remember proverbs we
[54:21] preach this a few weeks ago the Bible
[54:23] said I love I wisdom love them that love
[54:27] me so if we want God's love with more
[54:31] manifest in our lives we've got to love
[54:33] Jesus and Jesus said he that loves me
[54:36] keeps my commands amen hallelujah so we
[54:41] must love the Lord we must love wisdom
[54:43] and that's what Solomon did he loved the
[54:45] Lord and so God loved him now we know
[54:49] God got angry at the end of his life
[54:51] we'll look at that just a moment now I'm
[54:52] just doing it if here this is if it's
[54:54] either you know lemon oils either
[54:56] Solomon or it's a proselyte king it's
[54:59] either one of the other if King Lemuel
[55:01] is indeed Solomon then Bathsheba his
[55:03] mother taught him this saying
[55:06] wouldn't that be powerful church that
[55:09] about blew my mind
[55:10] recall that Hebrew boys were under
[55:13] tutors before coming under their
[55:15] father's profession right because that's
[55:18] what Hebrews 4 2 says they're under
[55:20] tutors for a while and then when they
[55:22] pass the tutor then they go to be with
[55:24] their father and work under their
[55:25] father's profession whether he was
[55:27] carpenter or farmer or whatever he was
[55:29] so that means if this was indeed Salman
[55:33] Bathsheba would have taught Solomon
[55:35] these truths
[55:36] before he was taught even by the tutors
[55:39] so Bathsheba if this was actually
[55:42] Bathsheba Bathsheba took this
[55:44] opportunity before Solomon gets the
[55:47] schoolteachers I want to plant
[55:49] prophecies in his heart hallelujah amen
[55:53] hope that's how you feel as mothers and
[55:55] fathers we want God's Word to be planted
[55:58] in the hearts of our children and
[56:00] grandchildren amen whoever this mother
[56:04] was she knew if I can plant this
[56:07] prophecy in my son's heart it's going to
[56:10] impact so many more people she knew I've
[56:13] got the revelation I've got the prophecy
[56:15] of the hour if I can plant it in my son
[56:18] who's going to be king this King will
[56:21] pass it on to everyone else what an
[56:24] impact one woman can have if she stays
[56:27] consecrated to God's Word amen
[56:29] hallelujah if she can believe the
[56:32] prophecy if she can believe the Word of
[56:34] God what amazing impact one woman can
[56:38] have upon generations to come amen
[56:42] now in this chapter this is the wisdom
[56:45] we see from this mother wisdom on how to
[56:48] be a king and then wisdom on how to
[56:50] choose a wife how to recognize what's a
[56:54] godly woman look like remember she's
[56:57] telling this to her son who's going to
[57:00] be king of Israel and she wants him to
[57:03] be able to be a good leader a godly
[57:06] leader and she wants him to be able to
[57:08] recognize this is what a wise woman
[57:11] looks like how many brothers when I
[57:14] won't recognize a wise woman thank God
[57:17] you have if you're married you God God's
[57:19] giving you a real blessing there is a
[57:20] wife he that's find that wife findeth a
[57:23] good thing the Bible says Amen so look
[57:27] at the path of wisdom that God ordained
[57:30] God ordained this path mothers never
[57:32] never never let Satan belittle the
[57:35] importance of your role your roars no
[57:38] roars crucial your your roars is so a
[57:42] critical and important you have the
[57:46] ability to impact hundreds if not
[57:48] thousands of people just by being
[57:51] faithful and
[57:52] Junior children the Word of God amen
[57:56] now just let's not forget the importance
[57:58] of women let's really just recall a few
[57:59] things just for a moment here mothers
[58:01] are the fifth gospel right and Jesus
[58:06] first showed himself alive to women and
[58:08] then the first woman was a former
[58:11] prostitute Mary Magdalene that's the
[58:13] first one he showed himself alive - not
[58:16] Peter with the keys to the kingdom it
[58:19] was a woman who had seven demons a men
[58:22] used to sleep around for money and do
[58:24] all kinds of evil but when Jesus
[58:26] mattered Jesus loosed her of those
[58:28] demons Jesus loosed her of that filthy
[58:31] lifestyle and Jesus thought so much that
[58:34] he will show himself to her the very
[58:36] first person that saw the resurrected
[58:38] Christ amen
[58:39] in his glorified body he chose a woman
[58:42] why he was showing he was going to
[58:44] redeem all the women or the churches is
[58:47] that right seven demons she was redeemed
[58:49] from seven demons were redeemed out of
[58:52] seven filthy Church ages amen hallelujah
[58:56] exactly right and then he still went to
[59:00] women after that he wasn't nun and the
[59:03] guys didn't believe it you know in those
[59:05] days in the courtrooms at the Roman
[59:07] courtrooms or what a man's testimony was
[59:10] always believed more than a woman's she
[59:13] was so low socially she had no she
[59:16] hadn't hardly any you know any trust you
[59:20] could place in a woman they weren't
[59:21] place in a woman and member they would
[59:23] even take her inheritance you know where
[59:25] that they wouldn't even let her have
[59:27] inheritance and financially if she was a
[59:29] widow it was it was almost like a death
[59:31] sentence you had to have someone she had
[59:34] to have someone provide for her so Jesus
[59:37] you know he he rejects all these worldly
[59:39] thoughts and and he lets the first
[59:41] people witness that he's alive to be
[59:44] women that's right now notice King
[59:48] Lemnos mother was seeking this was her
[59:52] desire to shape the Kings destiny by
[59:55] wisdom she knew where she wanted her son
[59:58] to go she knew where or what she wanted
[1:00:02] her son to become so at a young age he's
[1:00:05] trying to teach
[1:00:06] this prophecy about the Word of God hey
[1:00:09] man I mean you like to teach your
[1:00:12] children about the rapture praise the
[1:00:14] Lord
[1:00:14] there is going to be a meeting in the
[1:00:18] area man the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:00:21] first that's what we tell our children
[1:00:23] the dead in Christ will rise first you
[1:00:26] might see people that were dead you
[1:00:28] might see them alive you might see them
[1:00:30] because that's what the Bible said it's
[1:00:32] a reality those are the prophecies but
[1:00:35] we know as that happens we know the
[1:00:37] Bible said we're brother Branham taught
[1:00:39] us that the fullness of the Pentecost
[1:00:41] will be a bride amen
[1:00:43] that's prophecy the bride's got to come
[1:00:45] back to me to being the bride she was at
[1:00:48] Pentecost according to brother Branham
[1:00:49] and then we'll see the dead in Christ
[1:00:51] rise and then we which are alive and
[1:00:54] remain shall be caught up together to
[1:00:56] meet the lord in the air that's not some
[1:00:58] fairy tale
[1:00:59] that's prophecy amen hallelujah that's
[1:01:03] not something we're guessing at that's
[1:01:04] the Holy Scripture amen three thousand
[1:01:08] years old from that word from Joel there
[1:01:10] I will restore saith the Lord this is a
[1:01:12] prophecy and this is what we should rest
[1:01:15] upon this is what ye should teach the
[1:01:17] next generation amen
[1:01:19] that was her desire the Kings choice for
[1:01:22] a life the first lady of Israel
[1:01:24] presumably right would be based upon his
[1:01:28] mother's wisdom the woman sheets that
[1:01:31] woman each O's would then impact the
[1:01:34] rest of Israel so as a mother she
[1:01:36] stepped back and realized I have a huge
[1:01:39] influence on the next generation my son
[1:01:43] is going to influence the next
[1:01:45] generation whether godly or ungodly and
[1:01:47] then his wife is going to influence all
[1:01:50] the women right
[1:01:52] remember with at women with Esther she
[1:01:55] got in there because Vashti was
[1:01:57] influencing the women the wrong way not
[1:02:00] respecting their husbands right not
[1:02:02] listening their husbands not obeying
[1:02:04] their husbands so she had this wisdom I
[1:02:07] if I can train them up if I can teach in
[1:02:09] the prophesy if I can teach in the
[1:02:11] scripture my son will have a major
[1:02:13] impact for God and then his wife will
[1:02:16] impact the females as well and that that
[1:02:19] generation will
[1:02:20] rise up and be blessed say men that's
[1:02:23] exactly right
[1:02:24] remember we read this on Wednesday but
[1:02:26] brother Ram says what a sacred trust
[1:02:28] what a responsibility to a women now see
[1:02:33] why she's a type of the church which has
[1:02:35] the same responsibilities as a woman has
[1:02:37] a sacred responsibility to her
[1:02:40] motherhood sacred this is not something
[1:02:44] we take lightly being a mother is not
[1:02:46] something you can take like oh I got to
[1:02:48] get out in the workforce put that on
[1:02:50] hold put the responsibility of being a
[1:02:54] mother let that be the most sacred thing
[1:02:56] in your life sisters amen that is the
[1:02:59] most sacred thing you have and you have
[1:03:02] the sacred the sake of responsibility of
[1:03:04] keeping your virtue your holiness your
[1:03:07] sanctity and a responsibility to your
[1:03:10] husband just as Christ has our sacred
[1:03:13] responsibility to prayer I'm sorry just
[1:03:15] to the church has a sacred
[1:03:17] responsibility to prayer to the word to
[1:03:19] Christ just the same as the woman has
[1:03:22] hey man hallelujah you see how this is
[1:03:26] something that we can't take lightly I
[1:03:28] know the world wants to try to rush and
[1:03:31] get the mothers out of motherhood as
[1:03:33] fast as they can
[1:03:34] but God tells us this is the most sacred
[1:03:37] thing they can do is raise a child to
[1:03:40] know Christ and to know the prophecy the
[1:03:43] word of the hour that they're living in
[1:03:45] amen hallelujah nothing's more sacred
[1:03:49] than that
[1:03:51] notice the Prophet says your member this
[1:03:53] he says these children he's dedicating a
[1:03:56] baby and he says they're little
[1:03:57] treasures that God has given you the
[1:04:00] responsibility look at all those
[1:04:03] treasures brother John you got next to
[1:04:05] you further back look at that little
[1:04:05] treasure crawl on your lap right there
[1:04:07] you got a responsibility there and I've
[1:04:11] always said it may be this kind of a
[1:04:13] saying to mothers we know written for
[1:04:15] Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but
[1:04:17] there's a fifth gospel unwritten that's
[1:04:19] Mother
[1:04:20] so mother is the good news to her
[1:04:24] children mothers don't want to be good
[1:04:26] news when you wake up in the morning Oh
[1:04:28] where's my mama don't you want to be a
[1:04:30] source of good news to your children
[1:04:33] mom's got a smile or my mom you know
[1:04:35] singing or whistling the gospel song or
[1:04:38] something you want to be a source of
[1:04:40] good news of what Christ has done in
[1:04:43] your life amen
[1:04:45] he says she gets them before Matthew
[1:04:49] Mark Luke and John steam gets to them
[1:04:52] see that's what the mother of King
[1:04:53] Lemuel did for him she got to him before
[1:04:57] the others got to him
[1:04:59] so the responsibilities is placed upon
[1:05:02] you mothers and you father's don't leave
[1:05:04] out the father's there right we're not
[1:05:06] leaving out the dads they have just
[1:05:07] their more responsibility because
[1:05:09] they're the head of the home to raise
[1:05:11] these children for the kingdom of God
[1:05:14] and I'm sure that's your heart's desire
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:18] I could care less if my children are
[1:05:20] millionaires or doctors or lawyers or
[1:05:23] whatever they are I want them to be
[1:05:24] working for the kingdom of God I'll be
[1:05:27] most happy if Malachi Lydia they just
[1:05:30] sit there not sit there but of course
[1:05:31] they'll be doing things you're learning
[1:05:32] and but if they keep their place in the
[1:05:35] house of God that's the most valuable
[1:05:37] thing to me because we seek first the
[1:05:40] kingdom of God
[1:05:41] everything else is added amen we must
[1:05:44] seek to do God's will first and the way
[1:05:47] we get to know God's will is the here's
[1:05:49] word amen exactly right hallelujah now
[1:05:53] remember the reality about children
[1:05:57] children are God's property not ours the
[1:06:01] Bible calls them the heritage of the
[1:06:03] Lord
[1:06:03] that means the possession yeah you say
[1:06:06] well I take care of them I love my
[1:06:08] children but really they're God's right
[1:06:11] and children are your reward you must
[1:06:14] have done something right if God gave
[1:06:15] you children the bat's what the Bible
[1:06:18] says they're a reward and children are
[1:06:22] arrows in a mighty man's hand so see
[1:06:25] brothers we've got to be mighty in the
[1:06:26] scripture and they must be sharp and/or
[1:06:30] trained right that's why I you know
[1:06:34] that's right we don't we don't even
[1:06:35] though many of us homeschool some of us
[1:06:37] know it's alright but at home school
[1:06:38] they're there sometimes reproach upon
[1:06:40] home scores because that they don't
[1:06:42] sharpen their kids as much as they ought
[1:06:43] to they get lazy with school and then
[1:06:46] we'll just take a week off here pretty
[1:06:48] soon it's a month off pretty soon is two
[1:06:50] months off pretty soon there and hardly
[1:06:52] learn it at all that's a shame they need
[1:06:54] to be sharpened those mines need to be
[1:06:57] sharpened they need to be learning
[1:06:58] that's their job in our society is to be
[1:07:01] sharpened but the best sharpening they
[1:07:03] can have at home is love and correction
[1:07:06] amen they must be loved they must be
[1:07:09] hugged and kissed and they must they
[1:07:11] must be complimented but they also must
[1:07:13] be corrected by the Word of God amen
[1:07:16] that's how you sharpen them right the
[1:07:19] key to parenting there's three keys to
[1:07:21] parenting model model and model whatever
[1:07:26] you live before them is what you're
[1:07:28] going to produce right most of time
[1:07:29] because we went over about a few weeks
[1:07:31] ago no matter how close a Rebecca and
[1:07:35] Isaac lived to God Esau was destined to
[1:07:38] be lost right Jacob have I loved Esau I
[1:07:42] hated no matter how close Isaac and
[1:07:45] Rebecca lived to God Esau was still
[1:07:47] gonna be hated by God because God
[1:07:49] foreknew what he would choose so while
[1:07:52] we can't guarantee every child to be
[1:07:54] saved we can train them up and ask God
[1:07:57] and plead with God and pray and
[1:07:59] intercede and as a king of the priests
[1:08:01] we believe God will answer our priestly
[1:08:03] requests amen
[1:08:05] go see the desires of our heart that's
[1:08:10] our responsibility sharpen them train
[1:08:13] their minds especially in the ways of
[1:08:16] God remember this but if your children
[1:08:19] go to public school then they got what
[1:08:21] is it seven times
[1:08:22] they got thirty five hours a week of
[1:08:25] getting sharper in you but we better
[1:08:27] make sure we better ask them what they
[1:08:29] learn each day what you learn on the bus
[1:08:31] that's one of the worst places to learn
[1:08:33] because there's no adult supervision we
[1:08:37] better ask them and make sure they're
[1:08:38] being sharpened the right way because
[1:08:42] the Bible went through many scriptures
[1:08:44] this morning there's scriptures about
[1:08:45] how Satan's lies are like arrows and
[1:08:47] they sharpen his arrows too he's
[1:08:49] sharpening his arrows our arrows they'll
[1:08:51] have to be godly arrows it's exactly
[1:08:54] right now the
[1:08:56] you said also Christians are happy with
[1:08:58] the full quiver of arrows we should be
[1:09:03] happy with the total number of children
[1:09:05] a God gives us amen
[1:09:07] not complain not be burdened not be
[1:09:10] prideful but be happy be thankful with
[1:09:12] the number of children God gives us now
[1:09:15] I've trained righteously the children
[1:09:17] will be bold for Christ in public day
[1:09:20] amen that's all according to Psalms 127
[1:09:23] all that I just pulled out of these
[1:09:25] scriptures right here though children
[1:09:28] are a heritage or possession of the Lord
[1:09:30] the fruit of the womb is his reward as
[1:09:34] arrows are in the hand of the mighty man
[1:09:36] so are the children of the youth happy
[1:09:39] is the man that this quiver full of them
[1:09:40] they shall not be ashamed who these
[1:09:42] children these arrows but they shall
[1:09:44] speak with the enemies in the gate the
[1:09:47] gate was the place of social and public
[1:09:49] interaction amen and if we train our
[1:09:52] children the right way the Bible said
[1:09:54] that when you're not ashamed of me I'll
[1:09:56] be not ashamed of you amen that's
[1:09:58] Jesus's promise if you're not ashamed of
[1:10:00] me on earth than the angels of God and
[1:10:03] the son of God will not be ashamed of
[1:10:05] you in heaven amen
[1:10:07] so we train our children to have an
[1:10:10] answer for the devil's lies hallelujah
[1:10:12] because the Bible said in first Peter
[1:10:15] 3:15 or we ought to always have an
[1:10:18] answer for the hope that we have within
[1:10:19] us amen
[1:10:21] praise the Lord now let's look at this
[1:10:23] prophecy just a moment here
[1:10:26] the prophecy that she taught and whether
[1:10:29] it was a different woman or whether as
[1:10:32] Bathsheba verse 1 the words of King
[1:10:36] Lemuel the prophecy that his mother
[1:10:40] taught him what a great prophecy now
[1:10:43] what's prophetic in chapter 31 now of
[1:10:45] course we went over it I believe it's
[1:10:47] prophetic of the Bride of Christ because
[1:10:49] she's a very culmination of the church
[1:10:51] Ages she's the final voice to the final
[1:10:54] age she's no better than the other ages
[1:10:56] she was just ordained to be the final
[1:10:59] voice she was just just like Enoch he
[1:11:02] was just ordained along with God well
[1:11:04] Noah he was just ordained to go in the
[1:11:06] ark it's what we're all day
[1:11:08] it doesn't make us better than anybody
[1:11:09] it's just what we're called to do
[1:11:11] we just need to accept God's calling for
[1:11:13] our lives amen
[1:11:15] we're no better than anybody it's just
[1:11:17] God that's the blood of Jesus there'll
[1:11:19] be no boasting in heaven the Bible said
[1:11:21] there was only one thing I'm boasting
[1:11:22] that's the cross of Christ amen
[1:11:25] his blood shed for my sins amen he
[1:11:29] redeemed me he bought me he redeemed me
[1:11:31] back to God amen I look at the Bible
[1:11:35] says verse 3 this is her is her first
[1:11:38] words of prophecy to Solomon or Lemuel
[1:11:42] whoever you want to call give not no
[1:11:45] words don't give your strength unto
[1:11:47] women he's talking he's talking to the
[1:11:50] future king nor thy ways to that which
[1:11:54] destroys Kings what a prophecy of this
[1:11:57] is Solomon and Bathsheba what a prophecy
[1:12:00] the very first thing out of her mouth
[1:12:03] you're gonna be Kings son don't give
[1:12:06] your heart to women because the Bible
[1:12:09] said when it came to pass and the older
[1:12:11] days of Solomon when he got older he got
[1:12:12] a little axe on God his wives turned
[1:12:15] away his heart after other gods I was
[1:12:19] reading asterisks and some of those
[1:12:21] Moloch and Balaam some of those gods
[1:12:23] were evil I mean they were just the the
[1:12:26] Israelites sacrificed babies at their
[1:12:29] altar and solemn willingly built those
[1:12:31] altars so they could sacrifice babies
[1:12:34] there now he was so gifted at the
[1:12:37] beginning he was so sure at the
[1:12:38] beginning but he wandered often making
[1:12:41] compromises and pretty soon he finds
[1:12:43] himself on the whole other side God
[1:12:45] loved him at the beginning of course and
[1:12:48] God loved him and Satan we know that but
[1:12:50] he wandered so far church when we feel
[1:12:53] the very least tug of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:55] when we're wrong we need to get back on
[1:12:57] the right path amen sin will take you
[1:13:00] farther than you were to go and keep you
[1:13:03] longer than you want to stay but the
[1:13:05] grace of God will keep you as a seal not
[1:13:08] to tomorrow or next week but to the day
[1:13:11] of your Redemption amen hallelujah and
[1:13:15] that's what Solomon lack didn't have
[1:13:16] they didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:18] Ghost available in those days
[1:13:21] hallelujah we got an amen Christ is
[1:13:25] sealed in Satan's sealed out praise God
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:29] now look did you know rare bones
[1:13:34] struggle with the same thing because
[1:13:36] Salman didn't overcome and Solomon
[1:13:39] modeled marrying many wives to his sons
[1:13:41] as you know Rahab own struggle with that
[1:13:42] too
[1:13:43] rheya bone desired many wives go to read
[1:13:45] that scripture if you like remember
[1:13:49] Abraham like what did Isaac do like
[1:13:54] praise God
[1:13:55] so we got to take heed to ourselves what
[1:13:59] kind of lives and we as parents or
[1:14:01] grandparents what kind of lives are we
[1:14:03] modeling before the children it should
[1:14:05] be our life of godliness and holiness
[1:14:07] Amen ray Obama Solomon's son he was
[1:14:11] actually the first one to rule after
[1:14:12] Solomon passed he may be the my son can
[1:14:16] you imagine how how sad that would be we
[1:14:19] preach on that a few Wednesday's ago
[1:14:20] remember that there's 23 times Solomon
[1:14:23] says my son and if Ray Vaughn was the
[1:14:26] oldest which he might have been that
[1:14:28] means 23 times Solomon sat down and was
[1:14:31] teaching his son said my son don't do
[1:14:33] this my son don't do that my son don't
[1:14:36] do that
[1:14:37] he warned him about women and wine and
[1:14:38] idols and all these things right money
[1:14:41] and all these he warned about all these
[1:14:42] things but then rainbow watches his
[1:14:44] father drift off not living what he was
[1:14:47] preaching oh god help us to live what we
[1:14:51] preach amen
[1:14:52] if we preach it at Sunday morning let's
[1:14:55] go home Sunday and I didn't live in it
[1:14:57] praise God if not it does us no good
[1:15:00] we're just religious hypocrites but we
[1:15:04] got to take what we hear and make it
[1:15:06] live in our homes amen
[1:15:09] 23 times my son don't go to strange
[1:15:12] women my son
[1:15:14] don't keep your honor you know keep the
[1:15:17] integrity of the Lord keep the
[1:15:18] commandments of God and pretty soon
[1:15:20] rainbow and become a man not even fit to
[1:15:24] rule he was the one that member he's the
[1:15:27] one that trusted his younger friends
[1:15:28] more than the old wise saints of God
[1:15:30] what a shame and the Bible
[1:15:34] says the gray hair is the glory of the
[1:15:36] wisdom of man in the book of Proverbs
[1:15:38] so apparently rainbow wasn't paying much
[1:15:39] attention to the wisdom as dad taught
[1:15:41] him because he rejects the gray head of
[1:15:44] wisdom and an honor and purity he
[1:15:47] rejects that for a bunch of renegades Oh
[1:15:50] put the burdens harder on the people
[1:15:52] just mistreat the people they need to
[1:15:54] respect where God was calling for mercy
[1:15:56] have mercy have patience waiting upon
[1:15:59] the Lord but he got the roughs of the
[1:16:01] forcing stiff hand instead of having
[1:16:04] mercy how many want to see the mercy of
[1:16:06] God in your life I want to see it by
[1:16:09] God's grace and this is what he didn't
[1:16:12] learn the thing was he should have
[1:16:14] learned this but he didn't and so we see
[1:16:19] Solomon's his heirs his mistakes we see
[1:16:23] it repeated in the very next generation
[1:16:26] lord have mercy
[1:16:28] now look at this the word the prophecy
[1:16:32] that his mother taught him if this is
[1:16:35] Bathsheba who better to teach Solomon
[1:16:37] about how to best rule as a king and to
[1:16:40] select a godly wife than Bathsheba who
[1:16:45] would know better how a king ought to
[1:16:47] behave than Bathsheba and how to select
[1:16:52] a godly woman how could master even know
[1:16:55] which she would know from her mistakes
[1:16:58] she would learn from her mistakes that
[1:17:03] right
[1:17:05] we know she knew better she should not
[1:17:08] have been bathing on top of a house
[1:17:09] right next to the king's house she knew
[1:17:14] better than that right
[1:17:17] we knew this so she who better to teach
[1:17:21] and instill this who low and have a
[1:17:23] burden in their heart to keep this son
[1:17:27] in those things of God than Bathsheba
[1:17:29] and then read for that Bathsheba saw
[1:17:31] David's sons trying to take over the
[1:17:33] throne multiple times she saw all
[1:17:36] David's previous sons try to kill each
[1:17:38] other
[1:17:40] right she witnessed that they're all
[1:17:42] because partially because of her fault
[1:17:45] of her sin so who
[1:17:48] better to try to warn the next
[1:17:50] generation if it is Bathsheba than a
[1:17:52] woman who would know how a king ought to
[1:17:54] behave and how to select a godly wife
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] it's striking to me Church this this
[1:18:03] Bible is inspired it's inspired now look
[1:18:07] at this here whoever the mother was she
[1:18:09] took time to teach Solomon or Lemuel
[1:18:11] these things I noticed let's go look at
[1:18:13] verses 2 to 9 we'll probably have just
[1:18:14] enough time to baby preach this now look
[1:18:19] at verses 31 to our chapter 31 verses 2
[1:18:22] to 9 this is the mother saying to her
[1:18:25] son the future King look at verse 2 the
[1:18:30] Bible says what my son and what the son
[1:18:33] of my womb and what the son of my vows
[1:18:39] so it seems the king's mother if this is
[1:18:42] Bathsheba made vows to God for a son
[1:18:48] this reminds us of Hannah's prayer for
[1:18:50] vow for a son isn't Hannah known as one
[1:18:55] of the most god-fearing women in all of
[1:18:57] Scripture year after years she went to
[1:19:01] the house of God being mocked and made
[1:19:03] fun of you don't have any children you
[1:19:04] don't have any children and she just
[1:19:06] kept praying year after year I want to
[1:19:09] bring forth seed I would have I want a
[1:19:11] son I want to be a blessing to my
[1:19:14] husband and she endured the criticism
[1:19:16] for year after year after year and
[1:19:19] finally she makes this vial that we
[1:19:21] don't see anywhere else in the scripture
[1:19:22] if you give me a son I'll give him back
[1:19:25] to you she was willing to lose the very
[1:19:28] thing that she wanted why because she
[1:19:30] wanted the reproach taken away she
[1:19:32] wanted everybody know that I'm a mother
[1:19:34] I brought forth fruit and I brought
[1:19:36] forth an heir to my husband's name Amen
[1:19:39] see it was about it wasn't just about
[1:19:41] honoring yourself that's not what it's
[1:19:43] about it was about honoring her husband
[1:19:46] and passing on the godly seed line amen
[1:19:49] the joy of the Jews was seeing the next
[1:19:53] generation raise up and serve God they
[1:19:56] didn't want the name of their husbands
[1:19:58] to die or end
[1:20:00] that was the joy to see the next
[1:20:02] generation so if she had no seed and she
[1:20:05] didn't do her part in bringing forth the
[1:20:07] next generation so she's willing to give
[1:20:09] up anything Lord I'll even give up the
[1:20:11] very gift you give me if you can let me
[1:20:13] bring forth fruit for your name amen
[1:20:17] show us other women it's hard to find
[1:20:19] women in Scripture that have that much
[1:20:22] sincerity before God and the best part
[1:20:25] was she kept her vow
[1:20:26] she didn't make a promise to God and
[1:20:28] forget about it she she kept that word
[1:20:31] amen
[1:20:32] so this was Bathsheba think about think
[1:20:35] about if this was Bathsheba her and
[1:20:38] David let's say they just had their baby
[1:20:39] died David's crying there in the temple
[1:20:41] you know he gets up after he gets the
[1:20:42] news of it if this is mishima at some
[1:20:45] point she got on her knees and say Lord
[1:20:47] don't let me be childless I promise you
[1:20:50] give me if you give me a son I promise
[1:20:52] I'll teach him the prophecy of a godly
[1:20:55] king and a godly wife amen
[1:20:59] if that was Bathsheba think of how
[1:21:01] powerful that is of God teaching this
[1:21:05] woman who made an awful mistake the
[1:21:08] importance of prophecy character the
[1:21:11] next generation and the Word of God
[1:21:13] oh the this is the son of my vow so this
[1:21:20] was personal with this mother God gave
[1:21:23] me this God gave me this child as an
[1:21:26] answer to my prayer I hope every mother
[1:21:28] in here feels like that whether you
[1:21:30] vowed for your children or not I never
[1:21:32] made a vow for all seven of mine I never
[1:21:34] made a vow but I do make a promise to
[1:21:36] God that I'll raise them in the fear and
[1:21:38] admonition of the Lord and because of
[1:21:40] that because it this this shout means so
[1:21:43] much to me this is the this is what I
[1:21:45] wanted
[1:21:45] this was my heart desire I will keep my
[1:21:48] word and I'll let this child be raised
[1:21:50] in your word Lord amen the son of her
[1:21:54] vows in other words she wasn't playing
[1:21:56] games with parenting God gave me this
[1:21:59] child I promised God I would teach this
[1:22:02] child all these sayings about a woman
[1:22:04] and the prophecy and a king I promised
[1:22:06] God if he gave me a son for a king I'd
[1:22:09] raise his king in the fear of the Lord
[1:22:11] God help us to have hearts like that
[1:22:13] ain't
[1:22:13] now raise this child the right way I'll
[1:22:15] do the right thing because God has
[1:22:17] blessed me with this child hey man
[1:22:20] that's a godly woman hallelujah look at
[1:22:23] verses 3 to 7 remember the very first
[1:22:26] thing she says if this is Solomon which
[1:22:29] it may be it may not be the very first
[1:22:32] thing he warns a future king is having a
[1:22:36] lustful eye with women
[1:22:38] verse 3 give not thy strength unto women
[1:22:41] do not pour all your energy into filthy
[1:22:45] websites don't pour your free time into
[1:22:49] dirty magazines dirty movies do not pour
[1:22:53] your energy and strength into that
[1:22:55] that's her first warning remember she
[1:22:57] vowed this to God I will tell him not to
[1:22:59] do that if you give me a son nor thy
[1:23:03] ways to that which destroy earth Kings
[1:23:06] this is pretty powerful you know who the
[1:23:10] Destroyers of Kings have been down
[1:23:11] through the scripture the Bible said
[1:23:13] adulterers were the Destroyers of Kings
[1:23:16] that's what the Bible says polygamists
[1:23:20] were the Destroyers of kings let's read
[1:23:24] that Deuteronomy 17 17 so you got it I
[1:23:26] think I preached that maybe a couple
[1:23:28] years ago I can't member God had clearly
[1:23:32] told all the kings you do not multiply
[1:23:35] wives unto yourself it will ruin you and
[1:23:39] so Solomon just went I'm the king I'll
[1:23:42] just go right over the top of that I can
[1:23:43] do whatever I want I'm the Big Shot see
[1:23:46] how we got to stay humble church no
[1:23:48] matter how gifted we are no matter how
[1:23:50] many blessings God bestows upon you
[1:23:52] we're never above the word we've always
[1:23:54] got to be under the word humble to the
[1:23:58] word there is no compromise with the
[1:24:00] Christian you've got to be uncompromised
[1:24:03] to obey the word of the Lord because
[1:24:06] you'll reap what you sow look at verse
[1:24:09] 17 17 17 neither shall you multiply
[1:24:12] wives to himself that his heart turned
[1:24:14] out away neither shall he greatly
[1:24:16] multiplied to himself silver in his gold
[1:24:19] and it shall be when he sitteth on the
[1:24:21] throne of his kingdom that he shall
[1:24:22] write him a copy of this law in a book
[1:24:24] out of that which is before the priests
[1:24:27] of the Levi
[1:24:27] it shall be with him and he shall read
[1:24:29] therein all the days of his life
[1:24:30] read your Bible every day Solomon wrote
[1:24:34] man said read your Bible every day and
[1:24:36] the church said God told the King make a
[1:24:40] fresh copy the Bible have it written out
[1:24:42] before you every single day amen church
[1:24:46] let the word be fresh
[1:24:47] let it be freshly written upon our
[1:24:49] hearts every single day praise God if
[1:24:52] you didn't read your Bible this morning
[1:24:54] you should have Amen now God understands
[1:24:57] if there's every now and then you know
[1:24:58] when there's trouble or something like
[1:24:59] that the child sick or something like
[1:25:01] that but we were Kings today men we're
[1:25:04] kings and prays to God right now and
[1:25:07] Kings are ruling over sin the world
[1:25:10] Satan the devil and we've got to have a
[1:25:13] fresh copy the word written right before
[1:25:15] us written upon our hearts every morning
[1:25:17] and every night we do it in our house
[1:25:20] every morning every night right now
[1:25:22] we're on page 128 in the church age book
[1:25:24] I think we're trying to read three pages
[1:25:26] a day just we're letting the Holy Spirit
[1:25:30] use that book and write it upon the the
[1:25:31] hearts of the children by the grace of
[1:25:33] the Lord that's sheep food to me I don't
[1:25:35] know about you that's sheep food to me
[1:25:37] glory it is verse 19 and it should be
[1:25:42] with him and he shall read therein all
[1:25:43] the days of his life that he may learn
[1:25:45] to fear see as you go over the scripture
[1:25:47] again I don't care how many times you
[1:25:48] read the Bible keep reading the Bible
[1:25:50] because you it will teach you to fear
[1:25:53] the Lord to keep all the words of Islam
[1:25:57] these statutes to do them that's why I
[1:25:59] love reading the Old Testament the Old
[1:26:00] Testament gave so many examples of cause
[1:26:02] and effect if the King does this this
[1:26:04] happens if the King does this this
[1:26:06] happens it's so beautiful that's what
[1:26:07] proverbs shows a lot of to us as well
[1:26:09] and we know Paul taught it whatever you
[1:26:11] sow that's what you're gonna reap praise
[1:26:14] God
[1:26:15] but this is the destroyer of Kings
[1:26:18] adulterers polygamists and lastly
[1:26:22] dominating females that's what this
[1:26:24] mother this godly mother of the future
[1:26:27] King was trying to instill don't give
[1:26:29] your strength to women because they will
[1:26:33] destroy your kingdom and of course this
[1:26:37] is evil women their queen no sweeter
[1:26:39] woman than a real Holy Ghost field sweet
[1:26:41] crush
[1:26:41] woman praise God and that's what get to
[1:26:43] next week she's the greatest blessing
[1:26:45] you could have absolutely the greatest
[1:26:48] blessing a man can have outside of
[1:26:49] salvation is what a godly wife because
[1:26:55] member what did dominating female what
[1:26:57] did Jezebel do she stirred up King Ahab
[1:27:00] to do evil the Bible said he was a king
[1:27:03] but she stirred him up which means
[1:27:05] enticed him eluard him put thoughts in
[1:27:09] his mind that weren't the right thoughts
[1:27:12] so this this is what she's saying women
[1:27:15] will destroy Kings if the Kings don't
[1:27:18] surround themselves with a proverbs 31
[1:27:20] woman amen it's exactly right and church
[1:27:27] were kings and priests unto God and
[1:27:28] program taught us that you know evil
[1:27:30] spirits any spirit of idolatry is an ID
[1:27:33] I'm sorry adulterous spirit so if you
[1:27:36] idolize money if you idolize preachers
[1:27:40] to idolize your husband idolize your
[1:27:41] wife idolize your children anything
[1:27:44] that's more important than obeying the
[1:27:45] Word of God becomes an idol and that's a
[1:27:48] spiritual spirit of adultery can I say
[1:27:50] like that I wish I could say a little
[1:27:52] better that's all I could say there and
[1:27:55] this is what we're told we got to be
[1:27:58] careful every spirit that we receipt of
[1:28:01] to make sure that that spirit is proved
[1:28:03] by the Word of God that's right prove
[1:28:06] all things are you still proven all
[1:28:08] things or do you let things slip in your
[1:28:10] house we ought to make sure everything
[1:28:12] that comes in our house is godly
[1:28:14] everything in our life comes in is holy
[1:28:17] prove all things the Bible says amen we
[1:28:23] don't want to be destroyed as kings we
[1:28:25] want to reign as kings we want to
[1:28:27] flourish as kings now I got a little bit
[1:28:31] more to go here let me said timer I'll
[1:28:32] try to close that usually preach an hour
[1:28:34] half on Sunday morning I just can't do
[1:28:35] that I wear myself out wear you out so I
[1:28:39] set the timer I'll try to be faithful to
[1:28:41] the timer here now the next thing she
[1:28:43] says verses 8 and 9 let me go back there
[1:28:46] actually I didn't read verse 4 it is not
[1:28:48] for Kings Oh Lemuel oh yeah this is the
[1:28:50] wine section I'm sorry I didn't put that
[1:28:51] in my notes but we can read it verse 4
[1:28:54] it is not 4k
[1:28:55] lemme weld is not for Kings to drink
[1:28:57] wine nor for Prince's strong drink but
[1:29:02] she warns him by prophesy do not give
[1:29:05] place to drinking alcohol don't get
[1:29:08] mixed up with wine right lest they drink
[1:29:12] and forget the law see that the effect
[1:29:14] of drinking wine you forget the word of
[1:29:17] God you lose your ear your restrictions
[1:29:21] you riilu you lose your self-control
[1:29:23] when you start drinking wine too much
[1:29:24] and you forget the word of God and it
[1:29:27] perverts judgment of any of the
[1:29:29] afflicted so see wine will draw you a
[1:29:33] it'll make you more selfish because you
[1:29:34] stop thinking about the afflicted all
[1:29:36] you think about is yourself and this is
[1:29:41] the wisdom a mother is going to give to
[1:29:43] her son who's going to be king don't get
[1:29:46] mixed up with women wrong women and
[1:29:48] don't get mixed up with wine this will
[1:29:51] destroy a king faster than anything else
[1:29:55] look at verse 6 now she this is a
[1:29:58] sarcastic statement just so you know
[1:29:59] this is not this is not saying like oh
[1:30:02] we need to go give alcohol to people in
[1:30:04] the hospital so this is sarcastic is
[1:30:06] that there's a lot of sarcasm in Hebrew
[1:30:08] poetry give strong drink unto him that
[1:30:10] is ready to perish and wine unto those
[1:30:13] that we have heavy hearts so every time
[1:30:15] we see somebody struggling we shouldn't
[1:30:17] say oh you need to have some wine you
[1:30:18] understand what I'm saying here this is
[1:30:21] sarcastic she's telling their son let
[1:30:24] the sinners have the wine that's in
[1:30:26] other words we let them deal with wine
[1:30:27] but you're a king you're ruling
[1:30:30] you cannot pervert your judgment you've
[1:30:32] got to judge things the right way let
[1:30:36] them have their wine if that's what they
[1:30:38] want to have let them have their wine
[1:30:39] but you've got to forsake that you've
[1:30:41] got a commission from God you're a
[1:30:44] leader amen glory you're not a follower
[1:30:47] you're a leader in righteousness
[1:30:50] everybody looks to the king right
[1:30:52] everybody looks to the pastor everybody
[1:30:55] looks everybody looks so that the father
[1:30:56] the family the patriarch the grandfather
[1:30:59] everybody looks to the leader and so
[1:31:02] don't let yourself become selfish where
[1:31:06] you forget about others don't let
[1:31:07] yourself give your
[1:31:08] two things that are not godly stay true
[1:31:11] to God's Word
[1:31:13] look at verse seven see let him drink
[1:31:16] and forget his poverty and remember his
[1:31:18] misery no more now God doesn't want God
[1:31:20] doesn't delight in people getting drunk
[1:31:21] to see where they're just using sarcasm
[1:31:23] here just let if the sinners do that
[1:31:25] just let them do that
[1:31:28] look at verse eight now here's where I
[1:31:31] get to have a little few notes on this
[1:31:33] as king the king the leader the man he's
[1:31:39] the one who's got to open his mouth and
[1:31:41] plead the causes of the of the people
[1:31:45] who don't have much he's got to open his
[1:31:48] mouth this is the wisdom that she vowed
[1:31:51] I'll tell the King to do I'll tell my
[1:31:53] son to do this if you give me a son open
[1:31:57] your mouth for the dumb in the cause of
[1:31:59] all such as are appointed to destruction
[1:32:03] so anyone that's going to be destroyed
[1:32:05] anyone that's going to be killed
[1:32:07] open your mouth for them if they have no
[1:32:09] voice open your mouth for them if you
[1:32:13] see someone who's going to be mistreated
[1:32:14] and they have no voice you're a man of
[1:32:16] leadership you're a man of power
[1:32:18] you've got influence open your mouth
[1:32:20] don't keep silent
[1:32:22] don't let the innocent perish open your
[1:32:24] mouth and say something amen
[1:32:27] don't be a right that's what she's
[1:32:29] telling her son don't be a be a
[1:32:32] man stand up for people who are being
[1:32:34] persecuted say something about it
[1:32:36] amen she vowed to God she would tell
[1:32:42] this to the next generation the next
[1:32:44] generation will have a king who will
[1:32:46] stand there and he'll plead the cause of
[1:32:48] the afflicted and what's that look for
[1:32:52] us what's it look like for us if we know
[1:32:53] somebody's hurting let's speak up let's
[1:32:55] tell tell the deacon tell brother Adam
[1:32:57] tell me let's help them out by God's
[1:32:58] grace I don't care if it's your neighbor
[1:33:01] I don't care if they're the rankest
[1:33:02] sinner let's get some help for the
[1:33:04] people who need help because you never
[1:33:06] know when your kindness will be returned
[1:33:09] to you you never know when your kindness
[1:33:12] will cause somebody to be saved we don't
[1:33:15] see it a lot but we can't give up hope
[1:33:17] and act like it won't do something we've
[1:33:19] got to be Jesus with skin on amen
[1:33:26] stand up for people that are being
[1:33:28] mistreated stand up for him and our day
[1:33:30] a lot of it's children children get
[1:33:33] mistreated and know if they don't have a
[1:33:35] voice they don't believe him well
[1:33:36] somebody hurt me or somebody we don't
[1:33:38] believe them all come on nonsense
[1:33:40] no but be a voice for the afflicted and
[1:33:43] the church said be a voice this is what
[1:33:48] a man needs to be a voice to those who
[1:33:51] are less fortunate don't hold back don't
[1:33:54] keep silent don't get it start drinking
[1:33:56] it or go to women to forget about these
[1:33:57] voices hear the voice of the afflicted
[1:33:59] and do something about it remember
[1:34:02] that's what faith does faith in James
[1:34:03] chapter two if you see somebody cold say
[1:34:05] have a warm night and if you don't get
[1:34:07] them a coat you don't have any faith
[1:34:09] right Church if you're there hungry and
[1:34:12] you say I'll have a good night hope you
[1:34:13] get some McDonald's but you don't get
[1:34:14] them any food then you don't have any
[1:34:16] living face that's some real gospel
[1:34:19] preaching right there that's right
[1:34:22] faith X faith does something with the
[1:34:26] knowledge that it has praise God now
[1:34:29] this seems provide prophetic as well as
[1:34:30] I wrote up there
[1:34:31] Salman later asked the Lord for wisdom
[1:34:33] and judging Israel it's wouldn't this be
[1:34:36] powerful if Bathsheba sat down and said
[1:34:38] honey you're gonna be king someday
[1:34:41] you've got to judge the people the right
[1:34:43] way you can't treat your friends better
[1:34:45] than these old people you can't treat
[1:34:47] your favorite friends better than than
[1:34:49] these these poor beggars on the street
[1:34:51] you've got to treat everybody and
[1:34:53] Solomon there are going to be thousands
[1:34:55] if not millions of Israelites and
[1:34:58] they're all going to look to you for
[1:35:00] judgment I don't know about you let make
[1:35:03] me pretty nervous if I was a four or
[1:35:04] five year old boy the next generation
[1:35:08] rests on you and all of Israel is going
[1:35:12] to look to you to rule like a man I
[1:35:15] don't know about you but that prize
[1:35:17] stick with me in fact it did when I was
[1:35:20] raising up I was really good at sports
[1:35:21] God just gave me that I'm not bragging I
[1:35:23] don't have nothing it don't mean nothing
[1:35:24] at all it just nothing but the point is
[1:35:27] my mom as she saw me get newspaper
[1:35:29] articles and state championships she
[1:35:30] always told me she said Jesse of whom
[1:35:32] much is given much is required
[1:35:35] and so that kept me from doing a lot of
[1:35:37] evil things and I was a sinner in high
[1:35:38] school I think it saved dogs 19 but as
[1:35:41] she planted those seeds in my life I
[1:35:43] never forgot she was basically telling
[1:35:45] me that God has blessed you with gifts
[1:35:46] live the right way because you're gonna
[1:35:49] influence a lot of people and she
[1:35:51] planted that in my heart I'm so glad for
[1:35:53] a godly mom that will plant the word in
[1:35:55] a child's heart amen
[1:35:59] this is prophetic if this was Bathsheba
[1:36:02] and Solomon this was prophetic because
[1:36:05] Solomon was later going to ask this he
[1:36:07] said give your servant see now he sees
[1:36:09] himself as I'm just a servant of God
[1:36:11] I'm not some big bad King that knows
[1:36:13] everything
[1:36:14] just give your humble servant give me an
[1:36:17] understanding heart to judge thy people
[1:36:21] that I may discern between good and bad
[1:36:24] for who is able to judge this by so
[1:36:28] great a people as he was watching his
[1:36:31] dad David rule you know he'd see people
[1:36:34] coming I imagine Solomon you know I
[1:36:36] don't know how I judge that dad huh you
[1:36:39] know he'd probably probably the sin of
[1:36:40] many court cases not sure how to judge
[1:36:43] this and he would watch day after day
[1:36:45] court case court case court case court
[1:36:48] casing there's a lot of people in Israel
[1:36:50] there's a lot of problems in our church
[1:36:52] and the church said or if you got a lot
[1:36:55] of problems in your home what I'm saying
[1:36:57] is that Nomad problems always going to
[1:36:58] be there we just need the wisdom the
[1:37:00] judge right and wrong and that should be
[1:37:04] such a burden on our heart it should
[1:37:06] humble us and say god help me just to be
[1:37:08] a servant I'm just your humble servant
[1:37:10] use me to let the truth rule over the
[1:37:14] lies use me here that that that good is
[1:37:19] exalted over bad help me to never
[1:37:24] justify wickedness help me to never a
[1:37:28] criminal criminalize obedience but help
[1:37:31] me to always exalt wisdom and exalt
[1:37:34] truth that you might be glorified who is
[1:37:38] able my dad wasn't exactly able he made
[1:37:41] mistakes there's times he made mistakes
[1:37:42] David made mistakes who can judge all
[1:37:45] this people if you give me one thing God
[1:37:47] give me the spirit of this
[1:37:48] give me wisdom to judge your people and
[1:37:52] we know God did because here he stands
[1:37:57] up for harlots remember remember his mom
[1:37:59] said you stand up for the unfortunate
[1:38:01] you stand up isn't isn't the scripture
[1:38:04] inspired he said you stand up Simon you
[1:38:08] stand up for the afflicted and hear this
[1:38:10] mother right she didn't lay on her baby
[1:38:14] it was the other harlot she laid on her
[1:38:16] baby the baby died so this harlot
[1:38:18] switched the babies and now she's loose
[1:38:20] gonna lose her baby and Solomon we know
[1:38:23] the story says fine we don't know whose
[1:38:26] baby this is let's cut it in half and
[1:38:28] the the evil heart said fine cut in half
[1:38:31] and the real mother said no don't hurt
[1:38:33] my bait don't hurt the baby give it to
[1:38:34] the other woman
[1:38:35] and Solomon said give her the baby
[1:38:37] because she delights in life she's the
[1:38:40] real mother got some real mothers here
[1:38:43] this morning amen that delight in the
[1:38:45] life of their children and the only life
[1:38:47] of that we really need is the life of
[1:38:49] Christ amen
[1:38:51] the Bible said all Israel heard this
[1:38:54] judgment and they feared the king for
[1:38:57] they saw that the wisdom of God was in
[1:38:58] him to do judgment amen in that
[1:39:02] beautiful church the mother said you
[1:39:05] need to judge righteously and here years
[1:39:09] later sama has given any choice take any
[1:39:11] thing you want in this kingdom and he
[1:39:15] says give me judgment let me judge this
[1:39:17] people the right way and God blessed it
[1:39:21] God blessed it and because of this I got
[1:39:24] five minutes I'll try to keep my word
[1:39:27] here by God's grace I always try to keep
[1:39:29] my word let's look at verse 10 we'll
[1:39:31] just uh proverbs chapter 31 verse 10 who
[1:39:40] can find
[1:39:41] a virtuous woman for a price is far
[1:39:45] above rubies the heart of her husband
[1:39:48] does safely trust in her so that he
[1:39:51] shall have no need of spoil look at
[1:39:55] verse 12 she will do good and not evil
[1:39:58] all the days of her life now let's let's
[1:40:03] look at first of this acrostic poem this
[1:40:06] poem who can find a virtuous woman in
[1:40:08] verses 10 to 31 is an alphabetic
[1:40:09] acrostic this means each verse use the
[1:40:12] different Hebrew letter the alphabet now
[1:40:14] here's where I get into the spiritual
[1:40:16] blessing of this when describing this
[1:40:19] rare valuable woman
[1:40:21] it requires the entire alphabet from A
[1:40:26] to Z and that beautiful this is a type
[1:40:30] of Christ's character Tommy no brother
[1:40:32] branham said Jesus is the A to Z so if
[1:40:37] Jesus is the A to Z he's got to have a
[1:40:39] wife who's A to Z as well praise God
[1:40:42] amen she's not just in their word from a
[1:40:46] to L that's half I'm not just in the
[1:40:51] word a to L I'm all the way from A to Z
[1:40:54] praise God from beginning of the book to
[1:40:57] end of the book I want all of Christ all
[1:40:59] of his character all of his love all of
[1:41:02] his wisdom all of his power I want all
[1:41:05] of Christ's character in me the Bible
[1:41:10] never said he is the Alpha and Omega the
[1:41:12] A to Z which means that he is the A to Z
[1:41:14] the all of it he's everything the
[1:41:17] Almighty the Rose of Sharon Lily
[1:41:19] LaValley the bright morning star the
[1:41:20] righteous branch the father son Holy
[1:41:22] Ghost he is God Almighty God one God
[1:41:26] Christ is everything from A to Z he is
[1:41:29] the word his bride will have the same
[1:41:32] word character as her Lord will prove
[1:41:35] that by the scripture I'll be happy to
[1:41:36] so long to Solomon for seven thou art
[1:41:39] all fair this is Solomon describing his
[1:41:43] first wife thou art all fair my love
[1:41:46] there's no spot in the you're a glorious
[1:41:51] church without spot or wrinkle
[1:41:54] you're washed in the blood of the Lamb
[1:41:57] amen
[1:41:58] this is how Christ would ascribe his
[1:42:01] wife she's just like him she has his
[1:42:04] righteousness and like our Albert Barnes
[1:42:07] said these this is just a Hebrew this is
[1:42:10] the Hebrew alphabet right in order from
[1:42:12] there A to Z their alpha to Omega what
[1:42:15] both of em say make no mistake about it
[1:42:18] a person that's truly baptized by the
[1:42:20] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[1:42:23] receiving the fullness of the Spirit not
[1:42:25] just an anointing for a little time but
[1:42:27] the fullness of the Spirit will be in
[1:42:29] the word all the way this is the
[1:42:33] evidence not a guess so not a hope so
[1:42:37] not a thing so this is the proof of
[1:42:40] being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:42:43] Judas failed multitudes fell right there
[1:42:45] they fail to go on in that word and
[1:42:50] their names are taken off the book of
[1:42:52] life we've all we've all experienced it
[1:42:57] we've all come in the message really
[1:42:58] excited how many can say amen to that
[1:42:59] I came in really really excited really
[1:43:02] really zealous you could ask my wife but
[1:43:06] that's not enough that's not enough in
[1:43:09] fact the true proof of a Christian is
[1:43:12] that they keep going deeper into the
[1:43:16] Word of God they don't let up and take a
[1:43:19] few years off well I'm just not going to
[1:43:21] get much out of service if you're not
[1:43:23] getting anything out of service it's
[1:43:24] your own fault well I take it back
[1:43:27] it could be that the preachers fault
[1:43:29] sorry it could be the preachers spot to
[1:43:30] forgive me because he could be off the
[1:43:33] word then it's his fault but then you
[1:43:36] got the responsibility to go correct him
[1:43:38] praise the Lord
[1:43:39] let me balance that out of it there's my
[1:43:41] timer say it let's stand I better close
[1:43:42] I'm just gonna keep preaching but let me
[1:43:47] just say that let me just say that by
[1:43:49] God's grace if we are not growing in
[1:43:54] Christ it is our own fault because Jesus
[1:43:58] said come to me all you that are weary
[1:44:01] and heavy-laden out give you rest of the
[1:44:02] souls he said li he said learn from me
[1:44:04] because I'm meek and lowly in heart if
[1:44:07] we're not even feeding
[1:44:08] on the Word of God it's because we're
[1:44:10] prideful because when you learn from
[1:44:13] Jesus you must become meek and lowly
[1:44:15] like him you think you know more about
[1:44:18] it than the preacher or in the preachers
[1:44:20] case the preacher thinks it's his like
[1:44:22] he's the one feeding the people it's not
[1:44:24] the preacher
[1:44:25] it's Christ if Christ can get that
[1:44:28] preacher anointed and give him his
[1:44:30] thoughts through the word then the word
[1:44:32] comes forward to you and I and were to
[1:44:34] receive it as the word of the Lord but
[1:44:38] church this is where faintly this is
[1:44:40] where people fail like honest in a
[1:44:46] spiritual idea all of us right now we we
[1:44:48] would say we've left Egypt how many
[1:44:50] could say amen to that I've left the
[1:44:52] things of the world I am NOT a slave to
[1:44:54] the things of the world like I used to
[1:44:55] be but we've got to make sure we keep
[1:44:57] going on until we cross over Jordan amen
[1:45:00] and then when we get in Jordan we got to
[1:45:02] drive out every one of our enemies every
[1:45:05] one of the Giants must be driven out you
[1:45:08] must go further in the word until you
[1:45:10] take your predestinated or we say
[1:45:13] inheritance that land of your
[1:45:15] inheritance
[1:45:16] you must keep going until you can say
[1:45:17] this was promised to me this is my
[1:45:20] inheritance I've driven out the enemies
[1:45:22] and here I stand I'm ready to live in
[1:45:24] the grace of God amen
[1:45:26] I'm ready to live in my predestinated
[1:45:28] purpose in life I've left Egypt I've
[1:45:32] left my addictions I've left the slavery
[1:45:34] of sin I've crossed over I been
[1:45:36] circumcised I've been born again glory
[1:45:39] but now you got to fight the Giants off
[1:45:41] amen and you do that by putting the word
[1:45:45] first you know the Lord next time next
[1:45:50] Sunday by God's grace we'll look at the
[1:45:51] two defining attributes of a proverbs 31
