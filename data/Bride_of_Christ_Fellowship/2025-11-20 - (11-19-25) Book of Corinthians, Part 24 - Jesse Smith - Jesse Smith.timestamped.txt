[0:02] 1 Corinthians 13. I've had this thought
[0:05] for uh sitting here for many weeks just
[0:07] waiting to preach it. So, I feel like
[0:08] I'm going to preach it. Feel like I
[0:10] should preach it tonight. 1 Corinthians
[0:12] 13.
[0:14] What a wonderful weekend, as we said,
[0:16] that we had with our precious brethren,
[0:17] and they're already looking forward to
[0:20] uh Brother Tommy's wife can't wait to
[0:21] come up. Now, think about that. She
[0:22] can't wait to leave her big massive
[0:24] church, drive eight hours to come be
[0:27] with you.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:30] So church member, he said as soon as he
[0:31] walked in, he felt the Holy Ghost. And
[0:33] then he said he just uh knew God's
[0:35] presence was here. And he said that's a
[0:37] very special thing. So I want to thank
[0:39] our young sisters too uh for singing so
[0:42] well. Everybody loves to hear your
[0:43] singing sisters. I guess it's a it's a
[0:46] real blessing by God's grace. You know,
[0:48] we things become common to us, but I
[0:49] just want to thank our little sisters
[0:51] and uh getting to be more mature sisters
[0:54] here. Thank you for singing and it just
[0:56] creates such a beautiful atmosphere. 1
[0:58] Corinthians 13:4, if you have your
[1:00] Bibles here tonight by God's grace.
[1:01] Let's look at the the book of
[1:03] Corinthians. By God's grace, we're
[1:04] slowly getting towards there, aren't we?
[1:05] We're getting closer to the end of this
[1:06] book. By God's grace, and I'll be happy
[1:09] when it's done in one way, just because
[1:11] it feels like that I've reached a
[1:13] destination. You I've reached a I
[1:15] reached a spot where I can say, "I
[1:16] preach what Paul preached." Hallelujah.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; That's what Brother Ram was told.
[1:20] Remember, he heard the millions, Brother
[1:22] Ram told the voice. He said, "I preach
[1:24] exactly what Paul preached." And the
[1:26] million of voices shouted, "We are
[1:28] resting on that." Hallelujah. And I want
[1:31] your souls and I want my soul to rest
[1:33] upon Paul's gospel. Praise God. Amen. 1
[1:37] Corinthians 13:4.
[1:39] Now, Lord willing, tonight I'm just
[1:40] going to preach verse four, five, and
[1:43] seven because I got to watch the time. I
[1:45] want to be done in 45 minutes if
[1:46] possible. So, I'm sure you'll pray for
[1:48] me. Amen.
[1:51] Verse four, five, and six. I'll read
[1:52] four and five. Then we can I'm sorry.
[1:54] I'll read four, five, six, and then we
[1:56] can all read seven. Pardon me. Charity
[1:59] suffereth long. This, remember, this is
[2:01] agape. There's at least five types of
[2:02] love we talked about last time. Charity
[2:05] suffereth long and is kind. Charity
[2:09] envieth not. Charity vaunteth not
[2:12] itself, is not puffed up, doth not
[2:16] behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her
[2:19] own, is not easily provoked, thinkketh
[2:24] no evil,
[2:26] rejoicth not in iniquity, but rejoicth
[2:31] in the truth. Let's read this on three.
[2:33] One, two, three. beareth all things,
[2:37] believeth all things, hopeeth all
[2:39] things, endureth all things. May God add
[2:43] as a blessing to his holy word. You may
[2:45] be seated. You can switch over here by
[2:47] God's grace whenever you get the chance.
[2:56] I'm going to try to watch a time. So,
[2:58] Brother Chris
[3:06] It's not. You're right, brother. Amen.
[3:08] Wonderful. Isn't that a beautiful
[3:09] testament? Let's thank the Lord for
[3:10] that. Amen. That is so true, brother.
[3:13] That's why our musicians and those who
[3:14] sing specials, you know, like uh Brother
[3:16] Austin, Sister Naomi, different ones,
[3:18] our children. That's why they'll hear a
[3:20] good song, but it doesn't quite have
[3:22] that anointing till you bring it down to
[3:24] the people that live holy. Amen. We saw
[3:27] that with so many different songs we've
[3:28] sang here and so blessed by that by
[3:31] God's grace. Wonderful. Brother Chris, I
[3:33] appreciate you sharing that, brother.
[3:36] So, u again, we're so blessed to have
[3:38] our brethren here this weekend. Can't
[3:40] wait to have them back. I'm either going
[3:41] to have them back the first week of May
[3:43] or uh for our 20th anniversary meetings
[3:46] there in June. So, I look forward to
[3:47] having them back by God's grace. I just
[3:49] want to keep that fellowship going
[3:52] and uh
[3:55] you know our family every Sunday night
[3:57] after every every weekend we talk about
[3:59] what was our favorite parts of the
[4:00] service and so my children love the part
[4:02] about the diamonds you know the diamonds
[4:04] being sharpened and u we notice how he
[4:07] preached on Job as I preached on Job you
[4:09] know last month as well we got two now
[4:11] two other preachers come and preach on
[4:12] Job right after I preached on Job so
[4:14] it's trying to get us to understand
[4:16] something that God's going to test us
[4:17] and it's not always our fault fault,
[4:19] right? It was Job. It really wasn't his
[4:21] fault. He was just being tested. He
[4:23] overcame by the grace of God. And uh
[4:25] many beautiful thoughts in there. Keep
[4:28] trusting God because Oh, yeah. And even
[4:29] preach, he even preached quotes from the
[4:31] masterpiece. And this summer, I preached
[4:33] the masterpiece to you. I think I
[4:35] preached five parts on the masterpiece.
[4:36] So, it was really special to see that.
[4:38] That brother was nervous. He was like,
[4:40] I'm not, you know, Saturday, he's like,
[4:41] I'm not sure what to preach. I'm not
[4:42] sure what to preach. And uh nice to see
[4:44] that he found the channel of the Holy
[4:46] Spirit by God's grace. So, I was very
[4:48] thankful for that. And church, again, as
[4:50] I said on Sunday, remember he said they
[4:52] went through 30 years of a church, 30
[4:54] years, and they're just now experiencing
[4:56] the best part of those 30 years. So,
[4:59] what does that tell us? We're 20 years
[5:00] in. We've had some great years, right?
[5:02] But we can still know the best is yet to
[5:04] come by God's grace. And you know what
[5:06] it took, church? It took for the
[5:07] pastor's wife to get cancer to turn that
[5:09] around. Because then he said people
[5:10] started praying with sincerity. and
[5:12] people that had divisions and
[5:14] frustrations with each other repented of
[5:15] it, got everything right, and now the
[5:17] the pastor's wife is cancer-free by
[5:19] God's grace. So, just keep keep that in
[5:22] mind. You know, he's and church, they
[5:24] even had a church split. I don't know if
[5:25] you heard him say that. They had a
[5:26] church split and lots of hard feelings,
[5:28] difficult feelings. Uh and even the
[5:30] church split, that church is 15 minutes
[5:32] away from them.
[5:34] But some of them came back because of
[5:36] the love of God.
[5:38] See, church, no matter what we go
[5:39] through, if you put Jesus first, Jesus
[5:41] is going to take care of his people.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; And as we're going to see tonight,
[5:45] what's the most important gift there is
[5:46] out there? Is it prophecy? Is it being a
[5:48] prophet? Is it being an apostle? The
[5:51] most important gift is the love of God.
[5:54] And so, that's what I felt like their
[5:56] church has displayed that. Now, of
[5:59] course, other churches that are been uh
[6:01] around longer than we have. I'm just a
[6:03] young man. I'm just 45. I'm a young man.
[6:05] You know,
[6:07] I'm sure you'd say you're young, too, as
[6:09] well by God's grace. Uh, but we're young
[6:12] church, you know, so I just thought we
[6:13] could learn so much from these brethren,
[6:16] you know, 30 difficult years and all of
[6:17] a sudden, boom, the miracles start
[6:19] pouring down. But was it was any year
[6:21] wasted in the past?
[6:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; Do do you think did you ever hear him
[6:24] say that we wasted any years? No, he
[6:26] didn't say that. He said God has a time
[6:29] and season for everything. Praise God.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, we read our text
[6:34] and we've, you know, we've gone through
[6:35] this. I'm not going to go through this
[6:36] tonight because I got to watch the time.
[6:38] But, of course, this was a very uh
[6:40] difficult church. This church was not
[6:42] manifesting the love of God. This church
[6:44] was not manifesting charity. That's why
[6:46] Paul had to write about it. Charity does
[6:48] not divide on pre who's the preacher,
[6:51] right? Who's your favorite preacher?
[6:52] Charity doesn't divide that way. Charity
[6:54] doesn't commit sexual immorality, right?
[6:57] When you got the love of God in your
[6:58] heart. Charity doesn't sue each other.
[7:01] Charity doesn't get drunk.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Charity doesn't think,"Well, I'm better
[7:05] because I've got more money or I got
[7:06] better clothes than this person."
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Charity doesn't do that. And charity
[7:11] doesn't go overboard with spiritual
[7:12] gifts. Putting too much on gifts and not
[7:14] enough on love.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, we'll look at love here
[7:18] tonight by God's grace. Now, this was
[7:19] the thought. I know I did it bigger than
[7:21] I wanted to, but this thought I had was,
[7:24] you know, last time I preached on this,
[7:25] I showed how Paul's 16 attributes, I
[7:28] thought they got to be foreshadowed
[7:30] somewhere. They were foreshadowed in
[7:32] Exodus 34 when God passed by Moses and
[7:35] he echoed all those nine things, right?
[7:37] Merciful, long-suffering, visiting
[7:40] iniquity to the third and fourth
[7:41] generation. Remember those? We saw a
[7:43] great overlap. I think they shared six
[7:44] attributes out of those 16. And so what
[7:47] do we see? Jesus Christ is the same
[7:49] yesterday in the days of Moses today and
[7:51] forever. Hallelujah. But then I thought
[7:54] if if charity has 16 attributes, which I
[7:57] think it has 17, I might have this
[7:58] wrong. Well, then all of these have to
[8:01] be found in Jesus Christ because he was
[8:03] God manifest in the flesh. So tonight,
[8:06] let's look at the life briefly of the
[8:08] Lord Jesus Christ. Let's look at all the
[8:10] examples of where we see charity in the
[8:13] life of our savior.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; So it's a thought I never had before.
[8:18] The first attribute is charity suffereth
[8:21] long. If anybody suffered long, it was
[8:23] Jesus.
[8:26] Look at Jesus says he now he's in uh
[8:28] probably the second year of his
[8:29] ministry, his three-year ministry, three
[8:31] and a half years. And I brought to him
[8:34] uh to thy disciples and they could not
[8:35] cure this little boy. Then Jesus
[8:38] answered and said, "Now look, he's he's
[8:39] been with them two years. He's doing two
[8:41] years of miracles.
[8:43] And I want you to see how he suffered
[8:45] long." He said, "Oh faithless and
[8:47] perverse generation, how long shall I be
[8:49] with you?" And now look, he's talking to
[8:52] the whole generation, not just his
[8:54] disciples. He's talking to everybody in
[8:56] this generation. They've been 500 years
[8:58] without without a prophet. And Jesus
[9:01] says, "This is a faithless and perverted
[9:03] generation."
[9:06] What if the preacher come in here and
[9:07] said, "You're a bunch of perverts. Your
[9:09] generation,
[9:10] how would you take that? It was the love
[9:13] of God."
[9:14] It doesn't sound like it. It only got
[9:16] one amen, but it was the love of God.
[9:18] I'm joking.
[9:20] Well, isn't it the love of God, though?
[9:22] You're you're in a generation where it's
[9:24] perverted,
[9:26] faithless, have no faith. And that's
[9:27] what the Lord said,
[9:30] right?
[9:32] He long he said, "How long shall I be
[9:34] with you?
[9:35] How long shall I suffer you?
[9:39] Bring him hither to me. If you can't
[9:41] take him to anybody else, bring him to
[9:43] me. I've got faith."
[9:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So look, he suffers long
[9:48] with the entire generation. He suffers
[9:50] along with his apostles.
[9:53] Hallelujah.
[9:54] So look at this. He's a man who knows
[9:56] how to suffer. Church, if there's
[9:58] somebody bothering you or you're
[10:00] struggling with, keep suffering with
[10:02] them.
[10:04] You'll know like Jesus. You'll know when
[10:05] when it's time like Jesus to be done
[10:07] with someone. Right? The Bible says in
[10:08] heretic reject after the second or third
[10:10] admonition.
[10:12] So, there is a time to move on if
[10:15] someone's really out of behavior as a
[10:17] Christian or uh if you're not sure if
[10:20] they're a Christian,
[10:22] but keep suffering with them. Keep
[10:24] praying for them. Praise God. As we saw
[10:26] with Brother Tommy, he kept running in
[10:27] and out of the message in and out for
[10:29] years and years. And he said just
[10:30] finally in these last few years, he's
[10:32] been able to be stable. He sent me
[10:34] pictures where he was on his deathbed.
[10:36] He sent me the pictures of when he got
[10:37] burned at Arby's. It was front page
[10:38] news. I I I'm not even sure I'd share
[10:41] that with the children. and how burnt
[10:42] and how how awful he looked and look and
[10:45] but that the people did they ever write
[10:47] him off? No, they suffered long.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; So church, suffer along with people. If
[10:51] they're not living the way you think
[10:52] they should, if they're not living the
[10:54] way they know they should,
[10:56] &gt;&gt; keep suffering with them.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; Because Tommy was proof God can save
[11:02] anyone.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; And I was telling sister Naomi on
[11:06] Sunday, church, you're looking at a
[11:08] pastor. I was so ashamed to say this,
[11:10] but because my dad left me, I hated my
[11:14] dad. I would look at my mom sometimes
[11:16] when she wouldn't let me sin and I'd
[11:17] say, "Mom, I hate you." And yet, she was
[11:19] the one who loved me more than anybody
[11:21] else because she never left me. But I'm
[11:23] letting you know what a sinner says when
[11:25] they're not saved. I wasn't saved, but I
[11:28] was so hurt by my dad that I would uh
[11:31] lash out at my mom and say, "I hate you,
[11:33] Mom." And I didn't. But I was just so in
[11:36] pain I had to lash out at somebody
[11:38] because I had unconfessed sin in my
[11:39] life. And that's when you know you got
[11:41] unconfessed sin when you say you hate
[11:43] people. You shouldn't hate anybody.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; You should just hate the devil.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; But see, what did my mom do? She
[11:50] suffered a long time with me.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what did we got today? I
[11:54] got You got a pastor now because because
[11:56] my mom suffered long. Hallelujah. And
[11:59] God did too. Amen.
[12:02] Charity is kind.
[12:04] Jesus went forth. He saw a great
[12:06] multitude. He was moved with compassion
[12:07] toward them and he healed their sick. So
[12:09] church, if you're sick, remember Jesus
[12:11] has compassion on you.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be well.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; But you got to meet the conditions and
[12:17] you got to pass the test
[12:18] &gt;&gt; and also accept the will of God.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; And when it was evening, his disciples
[12:22] came to him saying, "This is a desert
[12:24] place and the time is now passed. Send
[12:26] the multitude away that they may go into
[12:28] the villages and buy themselves
[12:29] victuals." But Jesus said unto them,
[12:31] "They need not depart. Give ye them to
[12:33] eat." So look what love does. Love says,
[12:36] "I'm going to heal their bodies." And
[12:37] love says, "I'm going to give them
[12:39] food."
[12:41] So see, Jesus cares about all your
[12:43] needs, your physical needs and your
[12:45] spiritual needs. You and I should care
[12:48] with the kindness of agape love about
[12:50] people's physical needs and natural
[12:52] needs and healing needs.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, Brother Ram told us
[12:57] what true compassion was. Brother Ram
[12:59] used John chapter 5. Jesus walks in.
[13:01] There's a bunch of sick people. But he
[13:03] goes to one man, one man, one impotent
[13:06] man. And he asked him, you know, why
[13:09] don't aren't you healed? And he said,
[13:10] well, I don't have nobody to take me to
[13:11] the water. And Jesus said, rise up, take
[13:13] up your bed, and walk. Brother Ram said,
[13:15] look, look, look at the wisdom. Look at
[13:16] the compassion of Jesus. Did he heal
[13:18] everybody in there? No. He healed one
[13:20] person. But yet, other scriptures say he
[13:22] would go and heal an entire multitude of
[13:24] people.
[13:26] Right? So, we have to understand God's
[13:27] compassion is doing his will, what he
[13:30] knows is best.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; Don't get mad at him if you don't get
[13:33] your way. Just keep loving Jesus.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; You might be the multitude that gets
[13:37] healed. Or you might be that one that's
[13:39] got to wait, what was it? 12 years, 18
[13:41] years. Church, just keep trusting in
[13:43] God. Like the brother said, don't throw
[13:45] in the towel. You keep waving that
[13:46] towel. Amen. You start keep waving that
[13:48] towel for Jesus. Hallelujah.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; He's fighting for you, church. He's
[13:53] sending his angels to fight for you.
[13:55] Praise God.
[13:56] just keep passing the test.
[14:02] Jesus is kind. Now, here's the here's
[14:04] the balance, church. So, kindness will
[14:06] only go so far,
[14:08] right? He he turns around and looks at
[14:11] the multitude later on. He says he says,
[14:13] "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me
[14:16] not because you saw the miracles, but
[14:18] because you did eat the loaves and were
[14:19] filled." Think about this. At one time
[14:21] Jesus had to turn around and say,
[14:22] "You're only coming to my church because
[14:24] you want a handout."
[14:27] So, see, kindness goes so far. And then
[14:30] it was kindness to tell them you're just
[14:32] after the food or the money,
[14:34] &gt;&gt; right? That's God's kindness.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:39] So, with all these attributes, you have
[14:40] to balance them out and show how and
[14:42] show when to show the other side or we'd
[14:45] say a different form of kindness,
[14:47] correction.
[14:50] And then I love what he says, "Labor not
[14:51] for the meat which perth." You know, he
[14:53] tells them all, "Dude, you're do you're
[14:54] leaving all these things. You're making
[14:55] all this travel. You're spending all
[14:56] this time traveling." He said, "But
[14:58] labor for the meat that endures unto
[15:01] everlasting life." So they would sit
[15:03] through Jesus's long sermons just like
[15:05] they sat through Brother Ram's long
[15:07] sermons just to get something. They
[15:09] weren't really there, though, to do the
[15:11] will of God. Church, I believe you're
[15:13] here to do the will of God.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't come back service after
[15:16] service, uh, week after week. You
[15:18] wouldn't come back except you wanted to
[15:20] do the will of God.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Right? So be encouraged. Keep laboring
[15:25] for the meat that gives you everlasting
[15:28] life.
[15:30] Who gives it to you? The son of man, the
[15:32] Lord Jesus. For him hath God the Father
[15:34] sealed. So Jesus had to be baptized with
[15:37] the Holy Ghost. I know Trinitarians
[15:38] don't believe that, but that's because
[15:39] they don't believe the Bible. That's
[15:41] because they add to the Bible. And I'm
[15:42] sorry, brother Rod, if I offended you.
[15:44] Forgive me. I wasn't thinking about you,
[15:46] buddy. I'm thinking about that
[15:47] trinitarian I debated.
[15:51] Charity envieth not. Jesus did not envy.
[15:54] Look at the centurion. The centurion
[15:56] speaks the word. Right. He said and he
[15:59] he tells Jesus, "Lord, I'm not worthy
[16:01] that thou shouldest come under my roof,
[16:03] but speak the word only and my servant
[16:05] shall be healed." Now, Jesus doesn't
[16:07] say, "Well, boy, maybe I should have
[16:10] done that or something." He doesn't get
[16:11] envious of him. He actually praises him,
[16:14] right? He says, 'When Jesus heard it, he
[16:17] marveled. That's what we need to do,
[16:18] church. We should marvel when we hear
[16:20] those testimonies like we heard on
[16:21] Sunday. Wow, God healed cancer. God
[16:24] raised up, Brother Totty, from that
[16:25] awful heart condition. My God, God can
[16:28] heal a heart when a doctor says you
[16:29] can't lift five pounds, but now he's
[16:30] lifting what? 300. Malachi, what's he
[16:32] lifting now? 300 400 lb. And the doctor
[16:35] said you'll never lift five pounds.
[16:38] Now, which doctor do you want? Jesus or
[16:40] the natural doctor? I'll take I'll thank
[16:42] God for the natural ones, but I want
[16:43] Jesus as my doctor.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, he marvels. He
[16:47] marvels. Wow, this man has great faith.
[16:51] And church, that's what we want to have.
[16:52] We want to rejoice. We should rejoice
[16:54] with the body. We should rejoice when
[16:56] the body rejoices. We should mourn when
[16:57] the body mourns. I'm thankful for those
[17:00] uh testimonies from the brothers down in
[17:02] Kentucky. Now, it should give me a
[17:03] little bit of spiritual covetousness,
[17:05] right? The Bible says covet the best
[17:07] gifts, right?
[17:08] &gt;&gt; But what is the best gift? Again, love,
[17:11] charity is the best gift.
[17:15] So, we have to understand what is God
[17:16] asking us to manifest right now? Charity
[17:18] or does God want to manifest miracles?
[17:20] Laying hands on the sick, they recover.
[17:22] And what what is God trying to manifest?
[17:24] Hallelujah. But we should seek God and
[17:27] God will pour out his blessings on us.
[17:29] Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Charity does not vaunt itself up. Jesus
[17:34] did not vaunt himself up. Remember, he
[17:36] would do so many miracles like in
[17:37] Matthew 8, he healed a lepous hand,
[17:40] right? And then he said, "See that thou
[17:42] tell no man." Don't go put it all over
[17:44] Instagram,
[17:46] right? Don't go. These preachers post
[17:48] themselves walking all over and doing
[17:50] all their Facebook posts and YouTube
[17:51] posts and oh, we're going to have this
[17:53] meeting and that meeting. Jesus would
[17:54] have said, "Don't do that. Don't. It's
[17:57] not It's not time for that." Right?
[18:01] Jesus was never vaunting himself up
[18:03] trying to make him look like he was uh
[18:05] greater than other people. Right? The
[18:07] Bible said he was uh he was not he had
[18:09] no beauty that we would desire him. He
[18:12] never tried to spend a little more time
[18:13] in the mirror. I just tried to do it so
[18:15] the hair don't fall on my face. That's
[18:16] why I try to do it. If it didn't fall on
[18:18] my face, I wouldn't spend time in the
[18:19] mirror. But you got to do what you got
[18:21] to do. Amen. But see, he never exalted
[18:24] himself. But now there's a balance to
[18:26] this too, saints.
[18:28] What he tell the maniac of Gera? Did he
[18:30] say don't tell anybody? No.
[18:33] So, depending on the timing and when it
[18:35] was time to publish it,
[18:38] he uh says, you know, he now look at
[18:41] that. Isn't that something? He's he's
[18:42] begging him, Lord, let me come with you.
[18:44] You would think the God of heaven would
[18:46] let this demon-possessed man who's now
[18:49] healed come with him on a few trips. I
[18:51] mean, just a few trips. Please, Jesus,
[18:53] God. God, please.
[18:56] Can I make a few trip? Lord, can I make
[18:58] a few trips to Africa with brother
[18:59] Angley? And he did. I mean, I wish I
[19:02] could have made some trips with brother
[19:03] Brandham or I wish today I could make
[19:04] some trips different places. But Jesus
[19:07] said, "You're not making any trips. I
[19:10] need you to stay here and be a light to
[19:12] this city.
[19:15] But what if you wanted to travel?
[19:18] It would take the love of God for you to
[19:19] accept God's will."
[19:22] What does he say? Go home to your
[19:24] friends. You're not called to be a
[19:26] missionary, right? You're not called to
[19:29] be an evangelist, at least not right
[19:31] now. And tell them how I love this
[19:34] scripture when he read it. How great
[19:36] things the Lord had done for you and he
[19:38] had had compassion on you.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Church, if God's not calling you
[19:42] overseas, then tell somebody about God's
[19:44] love today.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; He loved me so much, brother Austin. He
[19:47] did this for me. Right, brother Claude?
[19:50] Jesus love you so much, he did so and so
[19:52] for you. Tell people if he's not sending
[19:54] you, let's tell him about Jesus.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; He's sending you here. In other words,
[19:59] stay here.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; See, it doesn't vault himself up.
[20:04] And at the right time, God will do
[20:06] something great for you. And then God
[20:07] wants you to testify about it. Jesus uh
[20:10] charity's not puffed up. Jesus was not
[20:12] puffed up. After that last supper, I
[20:15] love this. He rises up. He lays aside
[20:17] his his outer garment, took a towel, and
[20:20] he girds himself. So he ticks sticks the
[20:22] towel like the girding of girding the
[20:24] loins tucks his robe in there or inner
[20:27] garment
[20:29] and then he pours water into a basin and
[20:31] began to wash the disciples feet to wipe
[20:33] them with a towel wherewith he was
[20:36] girded and brother Brandham said the
[20:38] creator washed the very feet he created
[20:43] right
[20:45] and that song says what condescension
[20:48] bringing us redemption the very great
[20:51] someone who uh is outside of all time
[20:53] and eternity comes down and washes the
[20:56] very feet that he created. That is God's
[21:00] love.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; That's humility.
[21:04] And then church, sometimes we'll
[21:05] struggle. Well, do I have to wash that
[21:06] brother's feet or do I have to wash that
[21:08] sister's feet? You can't can't humble
[21:11] yourself.
[21:12] God humbled himself.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Let's take the Let's take the charity.
[21:16] Let's take that agape and God anoint us
[21:18] and help us to serve other people.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; I'm doing good on time. All right.
[21:24] Praise God. Charity does not behave
[21:27] itself unseemly.
[21:29] Jesus did not behave unseemly.
[21:32] Peter says, "For even here unto wherein
[21:35] or were ye called, because Christ also
[21:38] suffered for us, leaving us an example
[21:41] that ye should follow his steps." So we
[21:44] can clearly see that we're supposed to
[21:46] follow in the steps of Jesus Christ.
[21:48] Yes. Can we learn from David? Certainly.
[21:50] Uh can we learn from Moses? No doubt.
[21:52] Paul, absolutely. Timothy, all these
[21:55] saints. But our main one to follow is
[21:57] the Lord Jesus Christ. Because he did no
[22:00] sin and there was no guile or no
[22:03] pretending in his mouth.
[22:06] And that's how I want to live my life.
[22:07] Don't you church? I don't want to
[22:08] pretend. I just want to tell it like it
[22:10] is. Hallelujah.
[22:13] And this is how we know he didn't
[22:15] pretend. When he was reviled, he didn't
[22:18] get upset and revile right back.
[22:22] When he suffered, he didn't threaten to
[22:25] hurt other people when he suffered. He
[22:27] held back those threats or the
[22:29] temptation to threaten others. Well, she
[22:32] did this to me. Bless God. I'm going to
[22:34] do this to her.
[22:36] Right? He did this to me. Bless God. I'm
[22:39] going to show him who's boss around
[22:40] here. That wasn't Jesus.
[22:44] When he was reviled, he did not revile
[22:46] again. And he didn't when he was
[22:48] threatened, he didn't threaten other
[22:49] people.
[22:51] But what'd he do? He committed himself
[22:52] to God, the righteous judge. Church,
[22:55] that's what brother Bam calls the power
[22:56] of committ. Right? When you don't know
[22:59] if God's going to do this or answer this
[23:01] request, brother Ram said, just give
[23:02] that commit that over to God and say,
[23:04] "God, I'm just gonna have to trust you."
[23:08] &gt;&gt; And church, there's a lot of things God
[23:10] won't even tell us on this side. we
[23:11] won't know to the other side. So, I'll
[23:14] say like this. Let's just get used to
[23:16] trusting God
[23:18] &gt;&gt; and committing everything in our life to
[23:20] God. Why didn't this work out? Why why
[23:21] didn't this go the way I wanted to go?
[23:23] Let's get used to committing things to
[23:25] that. There's a God who judges
[23:27] righteously in heaven and he'll judge
[23:29] what's right. He'll make sure my life is
[23:32] judged the right way.
[23:34] Hallelujah. You know, some people they,
[23:37] like I said, they they hated God. Like
[23:39] the brother said, he knew people that
[23:40] hated God. And I just said how I hated
[23:42] my mom when really I didn't. I was just
[23:44] wanting to sin.
[23:47] But we got to remember that uh we must
[23:49] trust God. God orchestrates every event,
[23:52] right? There's uh there's councils in
[23:54] heaven, right? Because Satan's there to
[23:55] accuse you day and night. Think about
[23:58] that. Satan took time today to try to
[24:00] bring an accusation against you.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; Guess who stood up for you?
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah. Jesus stood up
[24:08] for you.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Now, he might might allow something to
[24:12] happen. He might allow the devil to do
[24:13] this or that, but just trust God. Keep
[24:16] coming to church, giving God a sacrifice
[24:18] of praise.
[24:21] Commit your ways unto the Lord. Behave
[24:25] yourself seemly.
[24:27] Behave yourself righteously.
[24:30] That will prove you've got the love. And
[24:31] a member of church, what does all this
[24:33] prove? What is charity? Charity's love.
[24:35] What is love? God is love. What is God?
[24:38] God's the Holy Ghost. And what are you
[24:39] born again of? The Holy Ghost.
[24:41] Hallelujah. So, what is this? This is
[24:43] all proof. You've got the baptism of the
[24:44] Holy Ghost.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; That's where this actually boils down
[24:49] to. Paul was saying you're not born
[24:50] again.
[24:53] Suing people, sexual immorality,
[24:55] divisions,
[24:57] right? Pride, arrogance, financial uh
[25:00] status higher than others. all these
[25:02] things
[25:03] allowing false preachers to come in and
[25:06] tear up the church. Remember he says
[25:07] that in second Corinthians. He said he
[25:09] he said you're allowing the people to
[25:10] tear you up, deceive you. Now I'm
[25:12] paraphrasing because I can't remember
[25:13] the exact verse, but they were these
[25:16] pastors and and leaders were just
[25:18] letting them get tore up. Maybe I can
[25:19] find it real quick. I don't know if I
[25:20] can uh just by the memory here. There it
[25:24] is. Yep. Go. Okay. Yeah. Go to us if you
[25:26] got your Bible. 2 Corinthians 11 uh 20.
[25:32] a church. By God's grace, I hope you
[25:34] believe I haven't let you be uh hurt and
[25:36] abused by preachers. I've tried to uh
[25:38] invite the right preachers who really
[25:40] have the Holy Ghost. And I try to treat
[25:43] you with love and kindness and respect.
[25:45] I try to show the agape love of Jesus
[25:48] Christ with all that's within me.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Second Corinthians 11:20,
[25:57] for you suffer if a man bring you into
[25:59] bondage. So they allowed preachers to
[26:02] bring them into bondage. Like you've got
[26:03] to do this, you got to legalism, you got
[26:04] to do this, got to do that. They allowed
[26:06] it. They let that go.
[26:10] They suffered. If a man devour you, so
[26:13] let a preacher just take something from
[26:15] you. Oh, you're struggling. You're not
[26:17] born again. They just took that
[26:18] testimony right from you. Oh, you don't
[26:20] you don't got enough faith. You're never
[26:22] going to be healed. Now, see, we don't
[26:23] let preachers like that come around. At
[26:25] least I don't. Well, I I never will by
[26:27] God's grace. I won't allow it. If they
[26:29] ever say it, I won't invite them back
[26:31] for sure.
[26:33] If a man take you, and I'm not sure what
[26:35] that word means. I haven't looked that
[26:37] up lately. If a man exalt himself, if a
[26:39] man smite you on the face, so literally,
[26:41] I would say literally, but symbolically,
[26:43] they would let the preachers just rebuke
[26:45] them right to their face and like smite
[26:47] him on the face. Uh, in other words,
[26:49] speaking really harshly right to them.
[26:52] Now, church, let's balance that. We all
[26:54] need rebukes sometimes, right?
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Right. But look at all the other fruits
[26:58] of these preachers. Brother Chris,
[27:04] this is uh the connection here uh was
[27:08] with these uh these were all the
[27:10] problems that prove Corinthians didn't
[27:12] have love. Remember back to that
[27:13] previous screen, brother uh this one,
[27:16] they suffered false preachers. All these
[27:19] prove they didn't have the love of God.
[27:21] If you love God, you wouldn't let
[27:22] preachers come in and do that to you,
[27:24] right? If if the pre if the pastors
[27:26] really had the love, the Holy Ghost,
[27:28] they wouldn't let preachers in like
[27:29] that, right? Does that make sense? Give
[27:31] them two classes. That's given there,
[27:32] brother. Good. I got 20 minutes. Oh,
[27:35] we're doing we're doing great.
[27:36] Hallelujah. We're doing great. Amen.
[27:40] Now, Brother Chris and I had a good chat
[27:41] on text about Peter. Remember that,
[27:43] brother Chris? So, Brother Chris said he
[27:44] was on Facebook and he was debating a a
[27:47] a Catholic. What a good guy to debate.
[27:50] That'd be right up our alley, wouldn't
[27:52] it?
[27:53] And uh and Chris made a good point and
[27:55] the guy said something along these
[27:56] lines. Correct me if I'm wrong. Uh he
[27:59] said uh when did Peter give you the
[28:00] authority
[28:08] over Peter?
[28:19] Very good. Yeah, cuz he was getting
[28:20] maybe a little out of order. But the
[28:22] point is he's for me for what I what I
[28:24] and I could be wrong but uh the point I
[28:26] got for that he was trying to say look
[28:27] at all the authority Peter had. So why
[28:29] who are you to debate me if God gave all
[28:32] the authority to Peter? And so I told a
[28:34] text brother Chris back and I went to
[28:36] first Peter 3:15 if you got your Bible.
[28:40] Well, you want to talk about Peter?
[28:41] Let's talk about Peter.
[28:43] You want to see what Peter said about uh
[28:46] debates? You want to see what Peter said
[28:47] about authority?
[28:50] Church, you have every right and
[28:51] authority as a Holy Ghostfilled
[28:54] Christian to testify about the word of
[28:56] God that's been revealed to you
[28:58] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of Jesus Christ is
[29:00] the spirit of prophecy. It's also the
[29:02] spirit of revelation.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 3:15. Let's read that.
[29:06] Let's all read together. 1 2 3. But
[29:08] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and
[29:11] be ready always to give an answer to
[29:13] every man that askketh you a reason of
[29:16] the hope that is in you with meekness
[29:18] and fear. Let's talk about Peter. Amen.
[29:20] Who gave me the authority? Peter gave me
[29:21] the authority.
[29:23] Hallelujah. John gave me authority to
[29:26] prove and try every spirit.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. That's good. Chris
[29:30] did a good job. He always does a good
[29:31] job standing up for the pe or this the
[29:33] Christian faith on Facebook there.
[29:34] Hallelujah.
[29:37] Amen. And remember, uh, some people,
[29:40] again, I was Yeah, I was sharing this
[29:42] with brother Chris. Some people
[29:43] criticize people that have debates.
[29:45] Well, you would be criticizing St. Paul
[29:47] because St. Paul went in Thessalonica,
[29:49] I'm sorry, also al also Athens in Acts
[29:51] 17 and he debated until he won souls.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; So debating, as long as you got the
[29:56] right spirit, that's of the Holy Ghost.
[29:58] You are fighting devils when you're
[29:59] debating.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; You're fighting the devils of confusion,
[30:02] false doctrine, all those. Hallelujah.
[30:05] Now, charity does not behave itself
[30:07] unseemly. Here's another chance or
[30:09] another opportunity or here's the
[30:10] balance.
[30:13] Jesus rebukes his own apostles for not
[30:16] accepting the women's testimony of the
[30:18] resurrection.
[30:20] So afterward he appeared in the 11 as
[30:22] they sat at meat. Notice Judas is not
[30:24] there because he sold out Christ and
[30:26] upgraded them with their unbelief and
[30:28] hardness of heart. In other words, Jesus
[30:30] said, "You're so hard-hearted."
[30:33] In other words, that'd be like a
[30:34] preacher saying, "Why are we so
[30:36] hard-hearted?" Now, if it's true, let's
[30:38] just say amen to it.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; I don't think you're hard-hearted. I
[30:41] hope you don't think I'm hard-hearted.
[30:43] If I am, come talk to me about my hard
[30:45] heart. I'll try to soften it by God's
[30:47] grace. But he goes, "Now, we know they
[30:49] weren't born again. That's why they were
[30:50] so hard-hearted." Right?
[30:53] But Jesus rebukes them right to their
[30:54] face and upgrades them, right? And so
[30:59] here, you know, we we might think, well,
[31:02] charity uh charity wouldn't rebuke
[31:04] somebody, would it? Yeah, it does.
[31:07] Sure it does.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; What does upgrade mean, church? It means
[31:11] to this was uh this is what this was
[31:13] what I was saying cast it in one's
[31:15] teeth. It just means right in your face
[31:16] telling you exactly what you're wrong.
[31:18] It's like when Paul told uh Peter you're
[31:20] the guilty one. You shouldn't have
[31:22] separate yourself from the Gentiles.
[31:24] Right in your face. That's an upgrading.
[31:27] Imagine he got right in their face and
[31:29] said you should have believed Mary
[31:30] Magdalene. I don't know how he said I'm
[31:32] just being a little over emotional.
[31:33] Maybe dramatizing a little bit. I don't
[31:35] know how my Lord said that.
[31:37] He rebuked him and said, "You've got
[31:39] hard hearts."
[31:45] So it means to revile, reproach.
[31:49] The Lord did that. So but but was he
[31:51] full of charity?
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. He was full of God. He
[31:55] was God in the flesh. The word was made
[31:58] flesh and dwelt among us.
[32:00] Charity does not seek its own. Jesus did
[32:03] not seek his own. He said, 'The greatest
[32:05] among you shall be your servant. So
[32:08] especially children, think about who
[32:10] serves you, who cooks you food,
[32:12] who buys you things, who buys you nice
[32:14] clothes. That's your servant, your
[32:16] parents.
[32:18] Now you'll have a chance to grow up than
[32:20] you get to be the servant.
[32:22] Hallelujah. Now, let's be honest. Some
[32:24] of us that are older, we like being
[32:26] served. Wasn't it a lot easier being
[32:27] served?
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a lot easier not having to do
[32:31] all those other responsibilities. Those
[32:34] who have the most responsibilities
[32:36] though, they're the servants and so
[32:39] they're given a greater honor in the
[32:40] kingdom of God.
[32:42] Jesus says, "So the greatest among you
[32:44] are those who serve other people."
[32:48] Whosoever you will be the chiefest is
[32:51] the one that serves everybody.
[32:53] That's the chiefest of the great the
[32:57] great ones among us. Now, we don't like
[32:58] to spend too much time on that. In other
[33:00] words, I don't want to start thinking
[33:01] about who's greater in here, who's the
[33:03] greatest in here. Let's just all try to
[33:04] be humble. Praise God. Let's all just
[33:06] try to res respect and serve each other
[33:08] by God's grace. In other words, if
[33:10] somebody if you see somebody not
[33:11] fellowshipping, they don't have any
[33:12] fellowship, go fellowship with them. You
[33:15] see somebody need some food, get them
[33:16] some food. I'm trying to think of things
[33:19] that uh see somebody drop something,
[33:20] just pick it up for them. Praise God.
[33:22] You know, just simple things. Just be a
[33:24] servant to other people. Now, it's going
[33:26] to start sewing pretty soon. And I'm
[33:27] going to tell you, brothers, brothers,
[33:28] let's be servants. you go out there and
[33:30] you uh wipe off uh the snow off of these
[33:32] sisters cars.
[33:34] Okay. All right. So, Chris and Austin
[33:36] and Claude and Patrick, Malachi, you
[33:39] guys be some real men and you go wipe
[33:40] off the snow off their cars. All right.
[33:43] Remember I said that?
[33:45] Be a servant. Go serve somebody. Help
[33:47] them out. Say, "Uh, can I go start your
[33:49] car for you?" Now, don't lock Don't lock
[33:51] the keys in the car. Okay?
[33:54] That's okay if you did. I'm sure they'd
[33:56] forgive you
[33:58] because Jesus Christ did not come to be
[34:01] ministered to. Jesus Christ came to
[34:03] minister
[34:06] &gt;&gt; and to give his life as a ransom for
[34:08] many. So you should take that same
[34:10] attitude. I did not come to this church
[34:12] to be served. I came here to serve.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; And that proves I have the love of God
[34:18] in my heart.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Find some person to serve. parents are
[34:25] there, it's already built into your
[34:26] life, right? Your grandparents is
[34:27] already built into your life. If you're
[34:29] married, it's already built. You got to
[34:30] serve that other person. Serve them.
[34:31] Serve them well. Hallelujah. But if you
[34:34] don't have that, find some way to serve.
[34:36] If you don't know, come ask me. I'll
[34:38] give you lots of ways to serve. I can
[34:39] start with the trash and the bathrooms
[34:41] and the sweeping. I'll start with the
[34:43] brooms
[34:45] and then get here early before before
[34:47] church and sweep all the leaves out so
[34:49] people don't track leaves in the church.
[34:50] I'll give you some ways to serve. If you
[34:51] want to serve,
[34:53] you want to spray down the pulpit and
[34:54] clean dust off everything, I can give
[34:56] you some ways to serve. If you want to
[34:58] be a servant and be like Jesus, find a
[35:01] way to serve.
[35:04] That's God's love. It's not what are you
[35:06] going to do for me, it's what am I going
[35:08] to do for you.
[35:10] I think that's why I love Brother Rod.
[35:12] He's always trying to serve me.
[35:14] And I'm like, how can I serve this guy?
[35:18] Brother Rod, you're a true servant,
[35:19] brother.
[35:21] I love you, buddy.
[35:24] Love does not seek its own.
[35:28] Jesus did not seek his own. He chose to
[35:31] fast 40 days
[35:33] to overcome according to God's test for
[35:36] his life.
[35:39] The tempter came to him and said,
[35:40] "Command these stones." And he said, "I
[35:42] won't do that because man doesn't live
[35:44] by bread alone, but by every word that
[35:46] proceeds out of the mouth of God."
[35:48] He did not come to serve. Well, I'll
[35:50] have big meals. I'll have a I'll get as
[35:51] much as I want to eat. No. If God's
[35:53] called me to fast, I'm going to I'm
[35:54] going to fast.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a lesson we can learn.
[35:57] Brother Rod tried to share that with us
[35:59] with his test. I hope you're learning it
[36:00] by God's grace. I am. Hallelujah.
[36:07] Jesus did not seek his own. He said, "My
[36:09] meat is to do the will of him that sent
[36:11] me and to finish his work."
[36:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm here to do God's
[36:17] will.
[36:19] Now, everybody can see it as a pastor,
[36:20] you know, everybody can see me. God sent
[36:22] me here to preach, right? And so, for
[36:24] me, it's easy to see God might send me,
[36:26] maybe he'll send me some other place
[36:27] someday. I don't know. But you got to
[36:29] look at your life, too. God sent you to
[36:31] Akran to be a blessing in the church
[36:33] here to serve in the church. But you got
[36:37] also also got to be open, too. God might
[36:39] send you somewhere else. And one way,
[36:41] you know, is you'll be able to obey all
[36:43] the word of God where he's sending you.
[36:45] He won't he won't send you to a place
[36:46] that has no church unless he's calling
[36:48] you to start a church and then you
[36:50] become the servant. You really become
[36:52] the servant. Then like the brother told
[36:55] me, he said he said, "Brother Jesse, you
[36:56] want to start a church?" I'm like, "I
[36:58] feel led to start a church." I said,
[36:59] "What advice you got for me, brother uh
[37:01] brother Brownie?" He said, "You're the
[37:04] church.
[37:06] You've got to do everything." That's
[37:07] what he told me. I'm like, "Okay, sounds
[37:10] good to me.
[37:11] All right, I'll do it. Nobody else wants
[37:13] to do it. I'll do it. You know why?
[37:15] Because I love Jesus.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:18] And he said, 'The church will do
[37:20] whatever you do.
[37:22] Amen. They'll follow your example.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; So if you serve, you'll have servants in
[37:27] your church.
[37:33] And I love this. He was not seeking his
[37:35] own. He look, he didn't even want his
[37:36] own will. He didn't even want to I'm
[37:38] sorry.
[37:40] his he wanted to live longer but he
[37:42] wanted to do God's will more than his
[37:44] own will because in his own will he
[37:46] wanted to keep living. He said Lord if
[37:48] it be possible remove this cup from me
[37:50] but nevertheless not my will but thine
[37:53] be done because the love of God does not
[37:55] seek its own desire. The love of God
[37:58] says I'll take God's way.
[38:01] And church, you know what it is? It's
[38:02] usually the harder way.
[38:05] It's a really good clue there. If you're
[38:07] wondering which way is God's way, uh,
[38:09] it's probably the harder one.
[38:12] Stay with the word of God.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Charity is not easily provoked. Jesus
[38:17] was not easily provoked.
[38:19] Look, the chief priests and elders were
[38:21] accusing him. Oh, that's right. When he
[38:23] was there in Caiaphas's house,
[38:26] and Pilate says, uh, hearest thou not
[38:29] how not many things they witness against
[38:30] thee. and he answered him never a word
[38:35] in so much that the governor marveled
[38:37] greatly.
[38:38] So Jesus kept himself so composed
[38:42] after all these accusations. He didn't
[38:44] say one word that the governor was
[38:45] marveling like how can this guy not be
[38:48] provoked.
[38:50] They're saying all these things against
[38:51] him. Malachi's getting so teased at
[38:54] work, yet he's not being provoked. And
[38:56] right,
[38:59] the children at school, you're getting
[39:00] maybe mistreated, but you're not easily
[39:02] provoked. You can just walk on and still
[39:03] love them.
[39:06] The neighbor girl comes over and tries
[39:08] to get mad at you, but you don't get
[39:09] easily provoked.
[39:11] That's the love of God.
[39:15] That's love. That's the Holy Ghost.
[39:17] Brother Jess, I want the Holy Ghost. I
[39:18] want the Holy Ghost. Right. Here's what
[39:20] it produces right here.
[39:22] do this and then you'll know you got it.
[39:24] Praise God. Because anybody can say they
[39:26] got it, but your life proves if you got
[39:28] it or not.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; I'm under 10 minutes here and I'm going
[39:34] to keep my word.
[39:37] Let me set another timer so I don't
[39:39] forget there.
[39:42] This is real love. Love is not easily
[39:44] provoked. Oh, that one brother sent me
[39:46] one email. Oh, yeah. I just had a good
[39:48] testimony. Yes, I had a good testimony.
[39:49] a certain uh brother called me up and
[39:51] explained the situation and he was angry
[39:54] at another brother and I said, "Well," I
[39:56] said, "I've been through this recently."
[39:57] I said, "Do Matthew 18 with him. If you
[39:59] got any concerns, go to oneonone."
[40:02] And then I sent him the letter that I
[40:04] wrote to uh individuals in our church
[40:06] when they sinned against me. So, I
[40:08] shared that with them so they could see
[40:09] that. And I got a message back from this
[40:11] brother, this precious brother, and he
[40:13] said, "I want to tell you, brother Jess,
[40:14] thank you for talking with me. I was so
[40:16] angry, but all my anger towards that
[40:18] individual has gone away
[40:22] &gt;&gt; because love doesn't get easily
[40:24] provoked.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; And we're all we're all tempted to get
[40:28] provoked, but then God, hey, you know
[40:30] what? That brother called me. That
[40:31] brother never calls me, brother. This
[40:33] guy called me all the loose. I know this
[40:34] is God. If he never calls me and he
[40:37] calls me and wants to talk to me, I'm
[40:40] not even his pastor. He wants to talk to
[40:42] me, it must be God. But I see the fruits
[40:45] of it now because he the devil's trying
[40:47] to get him really quickly provoked. But
[40:50] the Holy Ghost stepped in.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; It says, "Now I just I don't feel that
[40:53] anger. Now I feel the love of God."
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not easily provoked.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I like this one. He tells him,
[41:05] "You you have the key of knowledge and
[41:07] you're keeping people out and you're not
[41:09] even entering in yourself. You're
[41:11] hindering people from getting to
[41:12] heaven." And the church said, "There's
[41:14] all these preachers hindering people
[41:16] from actually getting to heaven or
[41:17] getting sanctified or getting the Holy
[41:19] Ghost."
[41:22] &gt;&gt; And he said these things unto them and
[41:23] the scribes and the Pharisees. Now look,
[41:25] they began to urge him vehemently, which
[41:27] means they're using all this emotion.
[41:29] Come on. Come on, Jesus. Answer this.
[41:30] Answer this. And provok him to speak on
[41:33] many things. They were lying in wait for
[41:35] him trying to catch him and catch
[41:36] something out of his mouth that they
[41:38] might accuse him. They were only, See,
[41:39] that's why people are only, the devils
[41:41] are only trying to argue with him, fight
[41:42] against you to get you to say something
[41:44] wrong. They're just trying to stir you
[41:46] up. But love will avoid that.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let them stir me up.
[41:51] I'm gonna say, "Sir up for Jesus."
[41:54] Hallelujah.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; See, church, there's a time God calls
[41:58] you to fight against them or debate,
[42:00] there's a time to be silent as well.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Look at these. They're urgent and
[42:04] they're just, "Come on, Jesus. What
[42:06] about this? What about Moses? What about
[42:07] this?" Jesus just waits.
[42:10] You're not going to provoke me. Now, we
[42:12] should tell the devil that tonight.
[42:14] You're not going to provoke me, Satan.
[42:16] You're trying to get my emotions all
[42:18] stirred up. You're trying to uh
[42:19] frustrate me. You're not going to
[42:21] frustrate me.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to commit my situation to God.
[42:24] Amen. Amen. I'm going to commit commit
[42:27] my soul to the righteous judge who sits
[42:29] at the right hand of the majesty on
[42:31] high.
[42:33] Not going to provoke me, Satan. Get
[42:35] behind me, Satan. Hallelujah.
[42:38] I'm almost done. I got five minutes
[42:39] here. Let me see where I'm at just
[42:40] because I I do have a place I want to
[42:42] end. Okay,
[42:46] thinkketh no evil. Jesus thought no
[42:48] evil. Even when Judas kissed him, he
[42:51] said, "Friend, wherefore out thou come?"
[42:54] He knew why he was coming, but he wanted
[42:56] to hear the hear Judas say it. But even
[43:00] this, he calls him friend.
[43:03] Church, I mean, I guess I could balance
[43:05] this one. I didn't have a slide for but
[43:07] Jesus also called people serpents and
[43:09] children of their father the devil.
[43:12] So there's a balance to this too.
[43:15] Charity will not think any evil. Now I
[43:18] just thought about this brothers with
[43:19] our mind battles with lust we should
[43:21] think no evil.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; I just thought of that.
[43:27] Jesus I love this. I just preached on
[43:28] this. Remember a couple weeks ago when
[43:30] Jesus lifted up himself from the woman
[43:31] caught adultery. Look he thinks no evil.
[43:33] He says where are your accusers? Hath no
[43:35] man condemn thee? And she said, "No man,
[43:37] Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither
[43:39] do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more."
[43:42] Jesus didn't think, "Oh, this woman
[43:44] probably did this and she's such an
[43:45] awful whoremonger and she's all these
[43:47] things and she's such a He didn't think
[43:50] no evil." He just said, "He that never
[43:53] committed sin, go ahead and cast the
[43:54] first stone." And the smartest and
[43:57] oldest man walked away first.
[44:00] God give us grace to be wise.
[44:01] Hallelujah.
[44:03] Jesus didn't think evil. Well, she
[44:05] probably did this. She probably did
[44:06] that. She probably did this. She
[44:07] probably deserves this. He didn't think
[44:09] no evil. He let the word discern who's
[44:12] not guilty.
[44:14] Hallelujah. Who hasn't sinned before?
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Charity church. The love of God rejoices
[44:24] not in iniquity.
[44:26] Jesus did not rejoice iniquity. He was
[44:28] burdened for Jerusalem. He said,
[44:30] "Jerusalem, that which killst the
[44:31] prophets, and sownst them which are sent
[44:33] unto thee,
[44:35] how often would I have gathered thy
[44:37] children together, even as a hen
[44:39] gatherth her chickens under her wings,
[44:41] and ye would not," Brother Chris,
[44:48] no problem, buddy. Thank you, sir.
[44:50] So Jesus was not rejoicing in the fact
[44:53] that Jerusalem rejected him as Messiah.
[44:56] He was burdened for them. He said, "I
[44:58] tried. I tried to love you. I tried to
[45:01] bring you into this, but you wouldn't do
[45:03] it. You wouldn't follow along with me."
[45:05] He didn't rejoice in their iniquity. And
[45:07] I love this. I mentioned this a few
[45:09] weeks ago. I love this was a good meme I
[45:10] found. I guess it's kind of a meme.
[45:12] People say, "Oh, you need to be so
[45:15] loving that you don't call people
[45:16] names." And they say, "Jesus never
[45:18] called anybody names. Uh, you forgot to
[45:20] read the book of Matthew and Luke and
[45:22] John."
[45:24] Jesus called people hypocrites, fools,
[45:26] blind vipers. He called them dogs. He
[45:29] said, "Don't cast your pearls before
[45:31] swine."
[45:33] He called Herod a fox.
[45:36] Now, church, I'm not telling you to use
[45:38] all these name calling things all the
[45:39] time, but I'm just letting you know
[45:40] there are times God allows people to
[45:42] name call if they're under the spirit of
[45:44] the Lord.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; But you shouldn't be looking for that
[45:47] opportunity. I can't wait to call
[45:48] somebody a swine.
[45:50] That's that's not the right attitude,
[45:52] right, church?
[45:54] But Jesus was speaking on spiritual
[45:56] terms, right? And he knew by God would
[45:58] let him know with certain individuals
[46:00] which way they were going. Remember, he
[46:02] didn't he didn't know who touched him,
[46:03] right? The woman with the blood, he
[46:04] didn't know. He said, "Who who touched
[46:05] me?" He didn't know that. He didn't know
[46:07] all things. He didn't even know the day
[46:09] or the hour he was going to come back in
[46:10] the rapture, right? But God let him know
[46:13] very much. He knew so much, but he
[46:15] didn't know everything because he in his
[46:17] humanity, the human side was fully
[46:18] human, yet it had a word divine nature.
[46:23] In his soul, he had the fullness of God
[46:24] in his soul. The fullness of God had
[46:26] dwelt in him bodily. But I just want to
[46:28] encourage you with that. Somebody says,
[46:30] "Well, you shouldn't call people names.
[46:31] You don't have the love of God." You
[46:32] haven't read your Bible enough. Jesus
[46:35] had the love of God and he called names
[46:36] numerous times. That's a small list.
[46:39] I'll tell you that. That's a small list
[46:41] because he called the Pharisees, "You
[46:42] two-fold sons of hell than your
[46:44] fathers."
[46:46] Right? He really rebuked them by
[46:50] I'm coming up on my time here. Okay, so
[46:51] let's see. Um
[46:53] yeah, and remember he said uh he he
[46:55] didn't rejoice in iniquity because he
[46:56] tells these people that did miracles but
[46:58] they lived in iniquity, "I never knew
[47:00] you. Depart from me, ye workers of
[47:02] iniquity." In other words, I don't
[47:03] delight. I'm glad you do miracles, but I
[47:06] don't delight in your life if you're not
[47:08] living and obeying the word of God when
[47:09] you leave the church or leave the
[47:11] campaign or leave the uh the big meeting
[47:14] or the revival services. You need to
[47:16] live holy when you leave the revival
[47:18] service. You got to keep the revival
[47:20] going. Hallelujah.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; And then here's what he says. So this
[47:23] proves, church, this proves we're not
[47:25] workers of iniquity because we hear the
[47:27] preaching and what do we do? We go live
[47:29] it.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Then when you live it, it becomes your
[47:35] foundation. It's the rock that you build
[47:37] your testimony on. I heard brother Jesse
[47:40] preach it. I heard brother Brad preach
[47:43] it. I'm not I'm going to go live it now.
[47:45] Now you're standing on a rock. And
[47:47] you're not a worker of iniquity. You're
[47:49] a worker of righteousness.
[47:52] I'm going to close with this. Uh that's
[47:55] I'll save that for Sunday.
[47:58] Oh my.
[48:01] All these attributes. Where are they all
[48:02] at, church? They're all where? They're
[48:04] all in Jesus. All these all these
[48:07] attributes of love. I want to be a
[48:09] loving Christian and I want the love of
[48:10] God. I want the greatest gift. Do you?
[48:13] If you do, you got to get it from Jesus.
[48:14] Hallelujah. Because they're all in
[48:17] Christ. And Christ comes to us in the
[48:19] form of the Holy Ghost.
[48:22] The Bible said there's one God,
[48:25] the Father, and we in him. Oh, that
[48:27] clock's off. Is that right? What's your
[48:28] clock say? But you got to watch them.
[48:29] Mine says 7:40. Anybody got to watch on
[48:33] that says 7:45? Am I blind? Okay, that's
[48:37] a little fast there. A fresh battery in
[48:39] there. But there's one God, the Father,
[48:42] of whom are all things. So where where
[48:43] does all things come from? The Father.
[48:45] And we are in him. Aren't you glad
[48:47] you're in God? Hallelujah. You're in the
[48:49] mind of God.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are
[48:53] all things and we by him. So we are in
[48:57] God's mind. Right? We are we came from
[48:59] God's mind. And I'll say it like this.
[49:01] We're also in his book.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Our names are written in his book,
[49:05] church. Amen. And what does Paul say?
[49:08] Paul says in Christ are hid. Well, what
[49:11] does that mean? You got to go find them.
[49:13] Who didn't like a good uh uh scavenger
[49:16] hunt when you were in school? Who didn't
[49:17] like going outside and doing a scavenger
[49:18] hunt, right? That that's what that's
[49:21] what the Bible's saying here. All these
[49:23] treasures are hidden Christ. You got to
[49:25] go find them. You got to get on your
[49:27] knees and pray.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; You got to get in your Bible. You got to
[49:30] open up that Bible and read. You got to
[49:31] listen to Brother. You got to read the
[49:32] church age book. There's all these
[49:35] treasures. Where are they hiding?
[49:36] They're in Christ.
[49:39] All these attributes of love. How can I
[49:40] be more long-suffering? How can I
[49:42] overcome my envy? How can I overcome uh
[49:46] my impatience? How can I overcome these
[49:48] things? By finding the treasures in
[49:50] Christ. That's how you overcome.
[49:54] And church, is it some treasures or is
[49:56] it all treasures? So, anything you need
[49:58] tonight, you can find it hidden in
[50:00] Christ.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; The question is, will you go find it?
[50:05] I know you're going to I know at least
[50:07] you're getting something here.
[50:08] Hallelujah. But we got numerous days in
[50:10] between our services. So tomorrow, let's
[50:12] go find some hidden things in Christ.
[50:14] Oh, thank God. Amen. Hallelujah. This is
[50:17] my last two script last three
[50:18] scriptures. For it became Jesus for whom
[50:22] are all things. All these attributes of
[50:26] charity. And by whom are all things in
[50:30] bringing many sons of glory. How many
[50:32] sons and daughters have come to glory?
[50:35] &gt;&gt; I have. You have. Amen. He's brought us
[50:37] from glory unto glory. Hallelujah.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:41] to make the captain of their salvation
[50:44] perfect through suffering. So Jesus is
[50:46] the captain and we carry out all of his
[50:49] orders. Hallelujah. He's our captain.
[50:53] He's our example. We follow him. If he
[50:55] loved like this, we love like that. If
[50:58] he gave if he ministered like this, we
[51:00] should min like minister like this, too.
[51:03] I love this. For both he that
[51:05] sanctified. So Jesus that sanctified and
[51:07] they who are sanctified
[51:10] are all of one. That's how you know
[51:13] you're one with Christ. You live a
[51:15] sanctified life. You love the way Christ
[51:18] loved.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; It's not always loveydvey like that's
[51:20] okay if you keep doing that. Sometimes
[51:22] it's like why are you just asking me for
[51:23] food all the time, right? Why don't you
[51:26] try to get closer to God? What are you
[51:27] going to fast and pray? And the church
[51:29] said
[51:30] &gt;&gt; sometimes that's hard.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; But that's love. That's God's love. At
[51:36] some point, you have to call out
[51:38] people's desires. If they're wrong, call
[51:40] them out and try to get them into the
[51:42] truth. They have the wrong desires. You
[51:45] should be kind. You should give food.
[51:46] But there should be times you should
[51:48] say, "When are you going to get right
[51:49] with God?"
[51:53] For which cause Jesus Christ is not
[51:55] ashamed to call you his brother.
[51:59] He's not ashamed because you've kept his
[52:01] word.
[52:03] You kept his word. Brother Chris, you've
[52:04] seen your life cleaned out, sanctified.
[52:06] Hallelujah. So, he's not he's not
[52:08] ashamed to call you. You're my brother.
[52:11] Hallelujah. God knew you. God chose you
[52:13] in his mind. Your whole family, God
[52:15] chose you first, Chris, to come to the
[52:16] truth of the gospel. Right, Sister
[52:18] Beatus? God chose you. Amen. To come to
[52:21] this message. Come to the truth of the
[52:23] Bible. So, he's not ashamed because
[52:25] you've left that because he you've let
[52:27] him sanctify you, clean out your life.
[52:28] He's not ashamed to say, "These are my
[52:30] brethren. These are my children. These
[52:32] are my people. This is my family. Last
[52:35] verse. And this is just what I read in
[52:36] the church age book this morning. Jesus
[52:39] said, "I'm alpha. I am omega. I'm the
[52:43] beginning and the end, sayeth the Lord.
[52:45] I am which is, I am which was, and I am
[52:49] which is to come, the Almighty." Brother
[52:52] Ram said, "Jesus Christ is all of it."
[52:55] &gt;&gt; So anything we need out of those 16
[52:57] attributes, church, we can find it one
[53:00] place. Where can we find it?
[53:02] Jesus. Let's stand to our feet.
[53:03] Musicians can come. It's 7:44.
[53:08] How many enjoyed hearing about Jesus
[53:10] tonight?
[53:11] &gt;&gt; How many want to love like Jesus?
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] You got a song in your heart now. Did
[53:20] you? Which one was it? Yes. I was gonna
[53:24] say I want to live the way he wants me
[53:25] to live. That's Yeah, I like that. To be
[53:27] like Jesus. Oh, I just want to be like
[53:29] Jesus church. That's all I want. I just
[53:32] want to love like Jesus Christ.
[53:36] Sometimes it's rebuking. Sometimes it's
[53:39] being silent. Sometimes it's being
[53:40] silent, just saying nothing at all.
[53:45] Sometimes it is pouring out compassion.
[53:52] There's hope for each one of us that we
[53:54] can show the love of Jesus Christ if we
[53:56] repent of our sins, receive his word,
[53:59] and church, if we go act on that word,
[54:01] we can manifest the love of Jesus Christ
[54:03] tonight.
[54:06] Let's pray.
[54:13] Lord Jesus, I love you.
[54:16] I love that you were so loving. You were
[54:20] completely, holy, fully loving.
[54:25] If anyone ever loved perfectly, Lord
[54:28] Jesus, it was you. We know you're the
[54:31] only one who never sinned.
[54:34] So, we come to you tonight. We know you
[54:37] sanctified us, Lord God.
[54:41] And so, we know we're your children
[54:42] tonight. Help us, Lord. I pray you'd
[54:45] continually sanctify us, Lord. We know
[54:47] the the human mind needs a daily
[54:49] sanctification. Lord God,
[54:52] Paul said, "Be renewed day by day in the
[54:55] spirit of your mind."
[54:58] So God, I pray for this church. Thank
[55:00] you for our faithful saints that keep
[55:01] coming back. We're so thankful for our
[55:03] visitor, Brother Rod. Lord Jesus, Lord,
[55:07] let each person hunger and go find the
[55:10] hidden treasures in Christ. May they
[55:13] hunger to be more loving. May they
[55:15] hunger to be more like Jesus. God, I
[55:17] want to be like you. I want people to
[55:18] see Christ in me. Lord God,
[55:21] thank you that that brother saw Christ
[55:24] in me to take away the anger.
[55:27] But Lord, I know I don't live it right
[55:29] every single day, Lord God. And I want
[55:31] more love in my life, Jesus. I want more
[55:34] love tonight, God. So I ask you, help me
[55:36] to love you more, Lord God. Help me to
[55:39] repent in any area of my life so I can
[55:42] have the love of God flowing through me.
[55:45] Lord, I pray for the your people
[55:47] tonight, your brethren. I pray for the
[55:49] church. They would not envy. They would
[55:51] not puff themselves up. And I pray the
[55:53] same for me. Help me not to be prideful.
[55:58] Help us to think no evil. Dear God, help
[56:02] us to suffer long. Help us to be kind.
[56:05] Help us to show the love of Jesus
[56:08] Christ. Oh God,
[56:11] this is such a beautiful lesson Paul
[56:13] gives a church that is embroiled with
[56:16] problems.
[56:18] Problems everywhere you look. And he
[56:22] says there's one answer to this. It's
[56:24] the greatest gift and it's not tongues
[56:28] and it's not interpretation and it's not
[56:30] wisdom. The greatest gift is the love of
[56:33] Jesus Christ. God, may we have the love
[56:36] of Jesus Christ in this church, Lord
[56:38] God. Oh God, thank you that the brothers
[56:42] see it, Lord. Thank you that the sisters
[56:44] see it when they visit, Lord God.
[56:50] Oh God, that's my one request. Keep us
[56:52] little, humble us, whatever you have to
[56:53] do to keep us walking in the love of
[56:55] Jesus Christ. May we seek for those
[56:58] hidden treasures of love. I did not get
[57:01] through all 16 or 17 attributes. So
[57:04] Lord, if you should terry, help us to
[57:05] continue looking at these to make sure
[57:07] our lives have these type of attributes
[57:13] because I want to be like Jesus on
[57:16] earth. I long to be like him. God, help
[57:19] me to be like Jesus.
[57:21] Help me to be like you, Lord Jesus.
[57:25] Help your people here to be like you
[57:27] today. May I pray for them?
